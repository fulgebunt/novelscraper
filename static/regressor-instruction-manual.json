    "Chapter 1": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay[Start the tutorial.]\u201cWhat is this\u2026.\u201dI spat out curses while I looked around at the interior of a darkened structure.In the dim light, I could see some unknown patterns.It was a completely different shape than any building on Earth. It was the first time I\u2019d ever seen anything like it, so naturally, my mouth fell open.I\u2019ve never been inside a pyramid, but I\u2019m sure it would look like this.In this unrealistic situation, I took a moment to roll my eyes.My last memory was of eating with my sister.\u2018What happened? What the hell\u2026.\u2019If I recall, it was like this.I got an unfamiliar Kakaotalk message on my phone.1-Do you want to join the game?-I thought it was a game invitation from a friend, and I just clicked the button without thinking about it.That was it.That was the only thing I could remember.My legs were trembling. I couldn\u2019t comprehend the situation.Suddenly, I found myself somewhere I\u2019d never seen before in my life.It was no wonder that I couldn\u2019t understand it.What stood out was the atmosphere here.It was like a horror movie that would terrify most people.Before I could think of anything else, I heard several voices around me.\u201cHey, where are we?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWell, is anyone else here? What the hell is this place\u2026 And why are there swords and weapons here?\u201d\u201cIf I knew that, would we be doing this? I think we\u2019re all in the same situation. Do you remember anything?\u201d\u201cHey! Is anyone there? Hey!\u201dPeople started talking.Someone was sitting on the floor, pinching their cheek to see if this was a dream.They were all different.\u2018It\u2019s not a dream.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a dream, and I wasn\u2019t alone.It seemed ridiculously smooth.When I swallowed for a moment, a sound rang in the small cave.[Players are invited to this world. We sent an invitation to the player, and the player accepted it. You were chosen as a hero to save the dying continent.]\u201cMy god! What a hero!\u201d\u201cQuit messing around in there and come out, you bastards!\u201d\u201cSir, I\u2019ll call the police. Sir, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d\u201cIs there a hidden camera? I\u2019ll sue. This is a complaint!\u201d[But not everyone can head to the continent. The only people eligible to go are those few who passed the tutorial.]\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d[Please pay attention to what I say next. It\u2019s directly related to your survival.]I suddenly sobered up.Because in this weird atmosphere, I heard the word 'survival\u201d.[Let me repeat that. Only those who survive this tutorial will be allowed to go to the continent.]\u201cWhat\u2026 Are you saying you\u2019ll kill me?\u201d[It\u2019s up to you, too. What I\u2019m talking about now is your survival. It\u2019s essential if you want to keep living. This is not a dream. This is reality you\u2019re faced with. I wouldn\u2019t recommend denying it. Because I have an obligation to help you as your guide in this tutorial.]\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me! Christ!\u201d\u201cPlease let me out of here. I\u2019m begging you.\u201dI heard a number of voices, but that damn woman\u2019s explanation kept going calmly.[The guide will now begin. Firstly, where you are now is a starting point where you can wait before you begin the tutorial. You can think of it as a waiting room. The starting point contains essential items for you. Water, food, and the weapons you\u2019ll be using later. Weapon rarities can range from common, rare, heroic, and legendary, but all of the ones here are inferior to common weapons.]2Some things definitely stood out. The water bottle placed in the corner was made out of leather, rather than plastic like it would be on Earth.That wasn\u2019t all.Of course, having never seen them before, the weapons were the most conspicuous.Bows and arrows, swords and shields, spears and maces.The presence of a wide variety of weapons that would be used in the Middle Ages was certainly alien.\u2018These are the real deal.\u2019They weren\u2019t fake.For the most part, the swords were dull and the weapons were old, but there were a few sharp ones.A sense of reality began to set in.[You can protect yourself with the weapons here. The goal of this tutorial is to survive and attack. Besides you, there will also be monsters, the inhabitants of the continent. They will be targeting you, and you\u2019ll have to fight them.]It was just like a fantasy novel.What was interesting was that fewer and fewer people were shouting.I began to focus on the sound of that voice.Well, I felt nauseous occasionally, but that was all.[Of course, it might be difficult to face them with your own power. But don\u2019t worry. This is not the only thing prepared for you.]\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026.\u201d[You are the chosen players. You came here with different personalities and from different places. This place will make your characteristics stronger and help you grow. You\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about if you say status window.]For now, I didn\u2019t say 'status window\u201d.I felt like I should proceed carefully in situations where I didn\u2019t know what would happen.As expected, someone was muttering it in a timely manner.\u201cStatus window.\u201d\u201cStatus window? Huh? What\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cKyaak!\u201dA woman screamed, shocked by what she saw in the air.[The status window shows your current condition. Depending on how much you try, your stats may go up or down. Next is your class. You can be a warrior, mage, priest, or archer, and there are branches based on your later achievements. For example, a warrior can become a barbarian, and a barbarian can advance into a berserker. There are countless paths, and it\u2019s up to you which one to take.]\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d[Class grades are common, rare, heroic, and legendary. However, if you are a mage or priest, you will inevitably need an affinity for holy power or magic. Please also understand that some classes cannot be selected. You\u2019ll be able to choose a class when you get missions, hidden quests, or enough experience.]\u2018A class.\u2019The more I listened, the more similar it was to a story I\u2019ve heard somewhere. It would be best to call it a system similar to a video game.It could be said that priests and wizards were uncommon here.If there really were monsters heading to this side, I thought most would avoid warriors.No one would want to fight on behalf of everyone else.I opened my mouth right away.\u201cStatus window.\u201d[Name: Lee Ki-young][Title: None. You should try a little harder.][Age: 25][Disposition: Careful strategist][Class: None][Stats][Strength: 10][Agility: 11][Stamina: 11][Intelligence: 19][Endurance: 12][Luck: 21][Magic: 00][Equipment: None]I wasn\u2019t used to seeing the sudden floating screen.When I quietly opened my mouth, feeling like I was in a game, I heard a woman\u2019s voice again.[The last thing is your attributes. Every time you get to a certain level, you get a new attribute. Attributes will vary from player to player and, like your class, are determined by your personality. The most important thing is the player\u2019s personality. As with classes, there are four grades: common, rare, heroic, and legendary, and as you go up, you get better performance.]\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d[Attributes are also gained similarly to classes. As with your class, your attributes can also have a huge impact on your growth, so please choose carefully.]In fact, I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the last part.Because I could see the letters displayed on the bottom of the status window.[Attribute: Heroic grade: Do you want to read it?]\u2018Huh?\u2019The words \u201cHeroic grade\u201d were shining in purple.The attributes were clearly categorized into common, rare, heroic, and legendary grade. It was an attribute that could be developed later, depending on the player\u2019s personality.\u2018Okay.\u2019I didn\u2019t know why I had this in the beginning, or if this was even real, but it wasn\u2019t a bad start.[Attribute][Mind\u2019s Eye: Heroic][You can view statuses for yourself and others and see hidden talent ratings.]I didn\u2019t know if this was good or not, but getting something at the start gave me a big advantage.The woman clearly said the goal was to survive.\u2018Survival.\u2019We had to survive.You absolutely must survive.It was natural that I felt I had to do whatever I could, regardless of whether this was a lie.\u2018Yulha\u2026.\u2019When I thought of my sister who would be left at home alone, I bit my lip.All the reactions around me were different.Some people talked about their attributes with others, and I saw men touching swords or looking for shields.We didn\u2019t know what was going on, but the fact that there was a threat approaching meant we had to look for a way to survive.There was a woman sitting down and crying.A middle aged man who kept yelling.I even saw a kid who still looked like a student.I also wanted to sit down and scream. But there was no time to sit down.\u2018Talent?\u2019I didn\u2019t know exactly what it meant, but it couldn\u2019t be a bad idea to check.It was a great achievement just to have an attribute.You were standing at a different starting point than the others.I had a strange expectation I\u2019d be like the hero in a shonen anime or a fantasy novel, but I quickly shook my head.\u2018That\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019[Check the talent levels of the player Lee Ki-young.][Name: Lee Ki-young][Strength: Growth potential: common (below average)][Agility: Growth potential: common (below average)][Stamina: Growth potential: common (below average)][Intelligence: Growth potential: common (below average)][Endurance: Growth potential: common (below average)][Luck: Growth potential: common (below average)][Magic: Growth potential: common (below average)][Overview: The player has the lowest talent levels. There\u2019s no point in making an effort. No matter how hard you work, you\u2019ll never become more than third-rate. Almost all the numbers are hopeless. It will be hard to develop when it comes to strength or magic power. At least intelligence and luck are fine, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 The player\u2019s future is deeply concerning. You don\u2019t have to wield a sword or try anything else. It\u2019s obvious what will happen anyway.]I had felt a little anticipation, but this wasn\u2019t at all what I expected.The results didn\u2019t change when I rubbed my eyes and looked at them again.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe ultimate goal was to survive.I never expected to be the main character anyway, and I made a clear distinction from fiction and reality, but those wretched figures still made me disappointed.\u201cDamn it.\u201dMy talent levels were below average.Notes:1. Kakaotalk is a messaging app for smartphones.2. It\u2019s pretty common in video games to have item tiers like this. See https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedItemTiers for examples. Basically, the tutorial weapons are weaker than the worst weapons you\u2019d find in the wild.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The starting point will open soon. Monsters will attack, so please be careful.]\u201cDamn\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t keep up with it all.It was because there were so many things happening, and I couldn\u2019t even get the chance to feel sorry for myself.The sounds of unknown beasts could be heard from outside.Frightened people began to cling to the wall, while those who were armed tried to protect their bodies.It was the same for me.Weapons weren\u2019t by any means scarce.So it was only natural that I ran straight away to pick up a spear.There were still swords left, but I refused to fight monsters from up close.\u2018What should I do?\u2019\u2018Shit, what to do?\u2019I thought about various different things.I\u2019m not the only one to be flustered, of course.There were screams all over the place.The cries of the animals outside, combined with this closed space, created a scary atmosphere.\u201cHelp me!\u201d\u201cPlease, get me out of here. Please\u2026.\u201d\u201cQuit playing around. Can\u2019t you just open the door? I\u2019m going to sue all of you! I\u2019ll sue you! Come on and open the door!\u201d\u201cWah wahh\u2026 Please let me live. Please\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m calling the police! The police!\u201d\u201cGrab your weapons! Can\u2019t you hear the sounds outside? Grab your weapons!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you hold it! You! Men should quickly raise a shield. Hurry up!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing! Now! Can\u2019t you just end this fucking prank instead of making things weird?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding? Didn\u2019t you see the window in front of you? Go get a weapon! Hey, old guy! You think this is a joke?\u201d1A bulky man, who had been loudly shouting, raised a wooden shield.There were many calling for a fight, but this guy was a little more aggressive.Before I even activated anything, his information came into sight.[Check the status window and talent levels of the player Park Deok-gu.][Name: Park Deok-gu][Title: None. You should try a little harder.][Age: 23][Disposition: Enthusiastic musclehead][Class: None.][Stats][Strength: 21/Growth potential: heroic (ideal)]2[Agility: 16/Growth potential: rare (below average)][Stamina: 21/Growth potential: heroic (ideal)][Intelligence: 10/Growth potential: rare (below average)][Endurance: 30/Growth potential: heroic (ideal)][Luck: 11/Growth potential: common (below average)][Magic: 00/Growth potential: common (above average)][Overview: Overall, it\u2019s well-balanced. You will grow well as a warrior with your high growth potential for strength and endurance. The potential for strength and endurance in particular are exceptional. It\u2019s not good to have low magic and agility, but they can be compensated for with other stats, right? Compared to player Lee Ki-young, you have great potential.]\u2018You didn\u2019t have to tell me that\u2026.\u2019I couldn\u2019t believe this guy was 23.Although he had a huge height, size, and weight, he didn\u2019t really look fat.It was more like his whole body was covered in muscles.Unlike me, who only had 10 points in strength and endurance, he had 20 points in strength and 30 in endurance.I quickly realized that not only were my talent levels at the lowest, my stats were also at the bottom of the barrel.Like I read with Mind\u2019s Eye, he\u2019d be useful as a warrior or a meat shield.3If you pretend to be friendly, you can definitely buy him as an ally.First off, I\u2019ll hang around him with a spear in my hand.When I practiced a movement with my spear, Park Deok-gu looked pleased and began to speak.\u201cAre you going to fight too?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I think so. Seems like there\u2019s something out there\u2026. It\u2019s better to do something instead of just sitting around.\u201d\u201cYou just said something pretty cool, hyung-ssi. Even though you look so weak.\u201d\u201cThank you. Let\u2019s get ready for now.\u201dWhat he said was rude, but he looked satisfied.Just exchanging a few words was effective.I opened my mouth again.This time, I was talking to everyone.\u201cDenying the situation won\u2019t change anything. First, we have to deal with what\u2019s ahead. Outside, you can hear the monsters crying. Whether it\u2019s real, or hidden cameras, or a dream, we have to do something. We all have to take up arms. We have to make a stand.\u201d\u201cStop messing around!\u201d\u201cI mean it. I wouldn\u2019t play this kind of prank, and I want it to be a joke too. Everyone, please pick up a weapon. Later if it turns out to be a joke, we\u2019ll deal with it then.\u201dThere should be many people who can fight.It\u2019s unknown how many enemies will come, or what type.Someone muttered something.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get a weapon for now. I guess we have to take care of the things out there first and then look at the situation. Since this guy said he can win, I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that will happen.\u201d\u201cRight, yeah!\u201d\u201cFor now, let\u2019s fight!\u201dNo one here was used to fighting, of course.But one by one, they started to lift up swords. Some were simply swayed by the atmosphere, while others armed themselves for protection.The mood in the room was gradually improving.\u2018Not bad.\u2019The way things were going really wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cWomen should also pick up weapons.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying you should go out and fight. But I can\u2019t predict what will happen. You need to carry a weapon. You can\u2019t expect someone to always be there to protect you. That\u2019s reality.\u201d\u201cOh. Yes, yes\u2026.\u201dI knew what I was saying.In the end, they looked unhappy raising their weapons, but that was all.There were still a number of people hanging around that weren\u2019t convinced.But I couldn\u2019t say that openly here. In the end, I swallowed nervously and waited for the enemies to come.\u2018Can we win?\u2019Of course not.But at least I was sure I could survive.The death toll would probably be high, but it was important to keep this base for now.\u2018Tutorial. She said it was a tutorial.\u2019The atmosphere was good, and everyone was willing to fight. Everyone\u2019s eyes shone with a desire to survive.\u2018I can do it.\u2019[The starting point will open in a moment. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.][The starting point has opened. Good luck to all participants.]But it was only my imagination that we would be able to do something, to be able to win, or to just somewhat hold on, or to expect a miracle to happen.\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201dInstead of in the front, a stone gate opened in the back of the room, and a human-like monster bit a woman\u2019s neck as she tried to escape.Blood flew from the back over to here.Before anyone could register it, monsters rushed in from every direction.\u201cAaaaah! Help me!\u201d\u201cRun away!\u201d\u2018Fuck!\u2019Screams rang out in an instant.It was seriously pandemonium.Even that jerk Park Deok-gu, who had been encouraging us to fight, just watched vacantly with his sword and shield, perhaps because he hadn\u2019t expected such monsters to come.We were ordinary people who had never held a sword and weren\u2019t used to fighting.There was no way we could survive this.It was hard for everyone to face the reality before us.I started to speak to Park Deok-gu, who was staring forward in a daze.\u201cWhat are you doing? You want to die!?\u201d\u201cHyung, hyung-ssi!\u201dHe was shaking, whether it was his legs or the hand he held a weapon in.But he bit his lip and swung the blade.It penetrated a monster\u2019s head with precision.Park Deok-gu held up his shield and pushed away the monster.It wasn\u2019t long before the formation collapsed.In a moment, a mix of allies and monsters ran out into the open space.\u2018You have to run.\u2019If I stayed here, I would die.\u2018Death.\u2019I would certainly be annihilated.\u2018I\u2019m going to die.\u2019There wasn\u2019t time for other thoughts.\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cHuh? Huh? Huh?\u201d\u201cYou fucking pig! Run! Can\u2019t you hear me?!\u201dHe started to shout at someone he saw.Park Deok-gu\u2019s voice seemed to wake that guy up, and he picked up his shield and fled.I, too, threw myself out of that narrow space.\u2018Ah!\u2019I remembered the issues of food and water as I was on my way.It was a relatively close distance.It was impossible to know if there were any other shelters here, so we had to keep those things safe.\u201cHyung, hyung-ssi! Where are you going!\u201d\u201cGet some water!\u201d\u201cAl, alright!\u201dThe screams were clear even through the mixture of voices.I caught sight of a woman who was bitten on the shoulder by a zombie.\u201cS, save me\u2026.\u201d\u201cShit.\u201dI felt troubled all of a sudden.But my two hands which held a spear didn\u2019t move to save her.I didn\u2019t look at her despair-filled eyes. As I picked up two or three leather bags, I turned my head to see monsters rushing like a pack of dogs onto her.It was thanks to her that I could leave, so it would only be right to express some gratitude.\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019After I muttered in my mind a half-hearted apology, I moved on.\u201cHyung-ssi!\u201dAs I turned my head towards Park Deok-gu\u2019s shout, I saw a monster flying towards me.\u201cShi\u2026.\u201dPuuk!\u201cGeuk!\u201dA sword flew from somewhere into its head.It was unclear if my luck stat had anything to do with it, but I definitely felt lucky.I felt like I made eye contact for a moment with the man behind the sword, but I didn\u2019t have the chance to check his information.What was for certain was the strange feeling I got.\u2018What was it?\u2019His face wasn\u2019t scared, nor were his eyes filled with a fear of death. He looked desperate, but he wasn\u2019t driven by just survival.\u2018Did I imagine it?\u2019It had been a very memorable face.As I passed him by, I saw Park Deok-gu waiting for me with his shield raised.\u201cDid you get the water?!\u201dI didn\u2019t hear an answer.But looking at the leather pouch in his right hand was answer enough.He was the type who was good at doing what was asked of him.\u201cI, I think there\u2019s still somebody inside!\u201d\u201cShut up and run if you don\u2019t want to be left behind! You son of a bitch! Can\u2019t you see the monsters back there?\u201d\u201cI, I see. Hyung, hyung-ssi!\u201dIt was only a matter of time before we emerged onto a wide expanse.I could see both those who were caught while escaping and those who never got out.When I looked back, there weren\u2019t any monsters following usThey were all focused on their prey inside.There were intermittent screams, but I didn\u2019t want to hear anything, so I covered my ears.\u201cSa, save me!\u201d\u201cFight baaaack!\u201d\u201cGeuk!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d\u201cHelp me. Wah wahh\u2026 Help me. Wahh\u2026.\u201d\u201cEuaaaaak!\u201dWhen I closed my eyes, I saw the people I left behind.\u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty. You didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\u201cYeah, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t help it. It wasn\u2019t your fault\u2026.\u201dIt was a situation where you couldn\u2019t do anything.He must have known that too.\u201cDamn it\u2026.\u201dBut that didn\u2019t stop a curse falling from Park Deok-gu\u2019s mouth anyway.1. Fun fact, \u201c\uc544\uc7ac\u201d is slang for a middle-aged man. Now you, too, can yell at your dad in Korean.2. Turns out these use the same words as for weapon rarities/class grades so I\u2019ve gone back to edit the first chapter to match.3. Common gaming term for tanks, or characters with high health/defense who stand in the front, since they can take more damage than more fragile damage dealers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWha-what should we do now, hyung-ssi?\u201cIf I knew what to do, would I still be standing around here?\u201dI was still in a state of shock.When I gave him this unconfident answer, Park Deokgu shut up and quietly observed me.Seeing that he didn\u2019t speak anymore, despite his non-stop chattering since the starting point incident, it seemed like he decided to acknowledge my words.\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what this place is for now. We need to look around first.\u201d\u201cY-you want to go outside?\u201d\u201cNot right now.\u201d\u201cThe-then you are saying that someday we will go outside?\u201d\u201cI told you, not right now.\u201dWe were in a hidden corner by a wall, which was hard to find in this maze.It was a little cramped for me and him to squeeze together in here, but it wasn\u2019t so bad.At least for now, it seemed like it could provide us with a minimum assurance of safety.\u2018Water, food and weapons.\u2019We had those things, but I didn\u2019t know if it was enough.The question is, for how long will we have to endure being here?And is it really safe here?I had a lot to think about.\u201cI never thought something like this could happen\u2026\u201d\u201cYou saw the status window and the monsters. It\u2019s not an illusion. It\u2019s not a video game. It\u2019s reality\u2026 but I also wish it were a dream.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dThe situation we were facing was, in fact, reality. I didn\u2019t mention the events that happened at the starting point. I\u2019d actually seen people die, and I\u2019d even seen monsters I couldn\u2019t even begin to describe.Denying reality wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201cThe-the main goal of this tutorial is survival, right? I-I think that strange woman said so\u2026 Then if we keep hiding here\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d\u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t know how long this will last for. We took some food and water, but it\u2019s not enough for us to sit here for a week\u2026 And there\u2019s no guarantee that this place is safe. Who knows where those monsters we saw earlier are hiding.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cYes, I think so. And even if we leave the tutorial now\u2026 how do we survive afterwards?\u201d\u201cW-what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not absolutely sure about it, but after this tutorial, we\u2019ll enter a place called the continent. I mean, this dungeon could be like heaven compared to that. There is no guarantee that the place we will end up in later will be safer than here. Simply hanging around here isn\u2019t going to cut it for sure\u2026\u201dHe clamped his mouth shut, because he couldn\u2019t deny my words.Of course, no one knew what would happen after this. But like that woman said, if we were really chosen to save the continent, it won\u2019t end simply with us waiting the tutorial out.Not only may we have to face the monsters we saw earlier, but also fight with each other.And we might face even more dire situations in the future.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re huddled up here, but when we finally leave, there\u2019s only one outcome anyway. \u201c\u201cWha-what do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat we will have to fight.\u201d\u201cWith those monsters?\u201d\u201cHave you ever played a video game?\u201d\u201cI-is there anyone in the world who has never played a video game?\u201d\u201cA Status Window, Stats, Titles, Equipment, Class. Don\u2019t you think these terms sound familiar? Imagine that you are in a game now. What do you think we should do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cLevel-up. Become strong enough to defend ourselves. Strengthening your body and killing monsters will raise your stats and get you a class, like that woman said. The attributes will naturally unlock, and while it will be hard, we won\u2019t have to avoid those monsters anymore.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cBefore we ran away, we picked up weapons, drinking water and food. Our situation is little better than others.\u201d\u201cYe-yes, but\u2026\u201dI knew he didn\u2019t like the idea of leaving this safe corner.In fact, all humans were the same.What normal person would want to face man-eating monsters?But there was no choice. Eat or be eaten. Otherwise, you won\u2019t survive.\u201cThis is what I think.\u201d\u201cDo you have any solution for this?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a solution, you have to create one.\u201dIf you don\u2019t have a solution, you should create one. No, actually the solution for this problem is easier than one would think.\u201cWe can kill them.\u201d\u201cBut how do you defeat a man-eating monster\u2026?\u201dIf you think about it, it\u2019s not like we have no way to win against them.I didn\u2019t remember much from the first battle.Anyone would be scared stiff, if a wave of monsters suddenly attacked from all over.However, I still vividly remembered that sensation passing through my hand.That creepy feeling when a spear pierced flesh. I didn\u2019t stab at it with much strength.But my spear still pierced its skin so easily.My mind was just clouded by fear. In that moment, I was scared of monsters I\u2019d never seen before and lost the will to fight.I lost it, Park Deokgu next to me lost it, and everyone else also lost it.\u2018But it\u2019s not like we have no way to win against those monsters.\u2019If you think about it rationally, it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t win.\u201cYou have to think about it in a simple way. As simple as possible.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. You need to look at them the way they are. Of course, it won\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m also shaking right now, and I don\u2019t know what to do exactly. You and I are the same. But if we are not surrounded or ambushed from behind, we stand a chance. Their skin is soft and they aren\u2019t particularly athletic. None of them followed us when we ran away. All of them rushed in at once into that room we were in before. Many people died at that starting point or whatever, because they were outnumbered. Everyone was also terrified and so couldn\u2019t react in a timely way.\u201dNothing was certain until I saw it with my own eyes.But I think my guess might be right.Compared to the physical abilities of humans, they were equipped with sharp jaws and claws.Those are their physical advantages.Unlike those butt-naked monsters, we had spears and swords within the reach of our hands. In fact, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that we were ahead of them in everything.\u201cIf you think about it calmly, we can win.\u201dThe problem was that Park Deokgu couldn\u2019t see the big picture.Even after my explanation, he was anxiously swallowing his saliva.\u2018Idiot.\u2019It was then.\u201cGeeek.\u201dI heard voices from somewhere.My natural reaction was to hold my breath. Park Deokgu did the same.\u201cGeeek!\u201dWe didn\u2019t know if they were creatures which moved in herds or separately.But the sound was getting closer.\u201cIt\u2019s coming here?\u201d\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019I cursed in my head.\u2018Can I do it?\u2019We would have to face it anyway.It felt like someone was squeezing onto my heart, but I ignored it and bit my lip.Because I knew that if we avoided this now, we would never escape this predicament of fear.[Checking the status window of Monster Crawfish.][Name: None][Title: None. You should try a little harder.][Age: 5][Disposition: Instinct][Class: None][Stats][Strength: 11][Agility: 15][Stamina: 14][Endurance: 12][Luck: 10][Magic Power: 00]I checked its information through the narrow gap where we were hiding.\u2018It worked.\u2019This ability could also be used on monsters.That was a tiny piece of good news.\u2018I can win.\u2019I had to overcome my fear.I didn\u2019t get a good look at it before, but now I could tell it definitely looked gross. Apart from the naked torso and lower body, it had green eyes and protruding jaws and teeth.I recalled in my head how, earlier, the same kind of monster bit the neck of a woman whose name I didn\u2019t know with those jaws and teeth.\u2018However.\u2019Those are some terrible stats.It\u2019s not like I was in position to judge those stats as terrible, but they were definitely lower that I imagined.That should do it.I put more strength into the hand holding a spear.Park Deokgu looked at me nervously, but I had no intention of backing off now.I had to show him that we could win.\u201cMa-maybe it\u2019s better to not go out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t answer.Because my back was soaked with sweat. My hands and legs trembled.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019If I make a mistake here, I will die.But I can\u2019t stay like this forever. Sooner or later, eventually\u2026 I would have to face those guys.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t go out, I will die.\u201dI took a deep breath, and immediately rushed out.\u201cGeeek!\u201d\u2018Damn it!\u2019I expected it to notice me at some point, but it was faster than I thought.Naturally, I thought I should swing the spear at the same time when it moves.But my hands didn\u2019t move as I wished. Fear stiffened my body.\u201cAhhhh!\u201dIn the end I had no choice but to raise my spear toward the head of the approaching monster, screaming like some kind of devil-worshipper.As if it expected this attack, the monster leaned straight down.Changing the course of the spear wasn\u2019t easy. As I tightened my trembling hold on the shaft and lowered the spear again, I accidentally struck it in its shoulder.\u201cGaeeek!\u201dPhew!The feeling of tearing through flesh was unsettling, and I almost dropped my spear, but I didn\u2019t have time to be dazed.\u201cAhhhh!\u201dWhen I pushed the spear deeper, the monster jerked and hit the wall.I frowned at the sight of the struggling creature, but without wasting any more time, I grabbed a nearby stone and started smashing its head with it.Although I broke my fingernails while doing it, I didn\u2019t feel any pain.\u201cShit! Shit! Shit!\u201dSmash!Strange mucus and blood splashed on my hands and body, creeping me out.I couldn\u2019t stop moving my hand.\u201cShit!\u201dSmash!\u201cDie!\u201dSmash!\u201cGaeeek\u2026\u201dSmash!\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dAfter its face had turned into a bloody mess, I was finally able to drop the big stone I was gripping in my hand.\u201cHaah\u2026 haah\u2026\u201dMy heart was beating fast and my breathing was heavy. My arms were covered in its saliva and blood.It was the first time I\u2019d killed something alive.When I shakily raised my head, my eyes met with Park Deokgu\u2019s who looked at me through the narrow gap in the wall.There was surprise in his eyes.He really didn\u2019t think I could do it.I also didn\u2019t think I could.[Strength stat increased by 1.]My expectations were correct.Park Deokgu cautiously opened his mouth and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cLee Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cKi-Kiyoung, can I call you hyung-nim?\u201dInstead of answering, I gave him a small nod.He was looking at me in a strange way. I looked straight at him and said.\u201cIf I can do it, you can do it too. No, you can do it better.\u201d\u201cI think I know what you mean. Kiyoung hyung-nim, leave it to me. Then, what do we do from now on?It seems this guy I picked wasn\u2019t so bad after all.There was still a lot of work to do.I looked at him, and opened my mouth.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s try to escape from here.\u201dObtaining a class.

That\u2019s the first thing on the list.\u201cHow do we get a class?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dPark Deokgu looked at me with a shocked face.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? I\u2019m not so smart that I\u2019d know everything.\u201d\u201cNo, you are smart, aren\u2019t you, hyung-nim? At least you seem to be more trustworthy than those who only know how to study. Even though you look like a nerd.\u201dHe was half right.Just, I wasn\u2019t a very good student.\u201cSo, how do we gain our classes?\u201d\u201cFor now, the only way seems to be by hunting monsters. That woman said that our class will depend on our hard work.\u201d\u201cOh, I think I heard that too\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst, we have to act to make a difference, whether it\u2019s just swinging your sword while standing in place or catching monsters. If we stagnate here and do nothing, we will die.\u201dSaying this, I poured out everything I had in my leather bag on the ground.Park Deokgu looked at me as if wondering what I was doing, but when I started to put leather on him, tying it up with sneaker laces, he seemed to realize my intention.He looked at me with a slightly moved face.\u201cIt looks like armor\u2026 But hyung-nim, don\u2019t you need it more than me?He would be the one fighting in the front anyway, so I didn\u2019t have to make one for myself.It was at least one more layer of insurance to protect my own neck. Just now, I didn\u2019t go ahead of you only to gain nothing.However, it wasn\u2019t necessary to explain this to him.\u201cYou are taller than me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I might not live up to your expectations, but\u2026 I will try my best.\u201dI nodded at his words.***He definitely lived up to my expectations.In fact, even only looking at Park Deokgu\u2019s basic stats, you could tell he was somehow strong.I didn\u2019t quite understand how our bodies affected our stats, but his stats were nearly twice as high as mine.I felt especially embarrassed when looking at his 30 points of endurance.His strength, shield and sword put together made his large body seem even bigger.Adding to this the clumsily made leather armor, and he looked just like a gladiator from some movie.But it was a very natural look for him. It was really not bad.However, this guy who finally gained some confidence, exceeded my expectations.\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe back of this big guy, who pushed two monsters away with his shield, came into my view.His face was still pale with fear, but even in this state he still hit them with his shield.He was just pushing forward with all his might, but monsters wedged between the wall and his shield could only aimlessly flail about with their clawed hands.While Park Deokgu was holding them in place, I raised my spear and stabbed it into the monster\u2019s face, once again frowning at the strange sensation under my palms.\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019\u201cHaaa!\u201dPark Deokgu wielded a sword in one hand, as he let out a short scream.He frowned, but didn\u2019t relax his grip on the sword. It was because from previous experience we learned that carelessness could get us hurt.\u201cGaeeek\u2026\u201dWhen the creature finally drooped down without any strength, I pulled back my spear.\u201cHaah\u2026 haah\u2026\u201d\u2018It\u2019s hard.\u2019It looked simple, but it definitely wasn\u2019t simple in practice.With Park Deokgu\u2019s help it was much better compared to my first time, but there was originally a big gap in our basic stats.Spending a few minutes dealing with those guys was enough for me to be covered in sweat.\u201cHere, have some water.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWith a little sigh, Park Deokgu made a worried face and opened his mouth.\u201cIsn\u2019t your stamina a little too low?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never exercised before.\u201dAt least my stamina had increased since we started killing monsters.\u2018Only by 1 though.\u2019Park Deokgu\u2019s situation was a little different.His original 30-point endurance had turned into 33 now. Compared to me, it was a huge achievement.I wasn\u2019t sure if talent affected the rate stats rose, but looking at it, I guess that was it.His endurance stat growth potential allowed him to reach the heroic grade and even beyond if he put his mind to it, so climbing higher at first shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for him.\u2018Damn it.\u2019Of course what I was feeling wasn\u2019t needless jealousy.What worried me was that Park Deokgu might not need me.Looking at his innocent face, he didn\u2019t seem to think this way yet.I came to the conclusion that it would be in my best interests to survive while relying on him.\u201cBy the way, maybe today we could look around a little more, hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cLook around a little more\u2026 By the way, when you speak, keep your voice down.\u201d\u201cDo we really need to be so careful?\u201d\u201cI think noise was the reason why so many monsters appeared at the starting point.\u201d\u201cThat female guide also talked a lot\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t think that was the main reason. Those monsters seem dull but are sensitive to sound. It\u2019s only natural that they poured into that room, since people there were yelling at each other for so long. Perhaps, half of those people could have survived if only we started the tutorial quietly.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cYes. So while in a fight, we need to turn down the noise a little. For now, we are dealing with only one or two at time, but when four or five of them gather, we\u2019ll die. The reason we keep moving is that if we stay in one place, we might get surrounded.\u201dHe cast me a look of peculiar admiration. If only you used your head a little, anyone could realise this.However, the fact that this innocent guy was looking at me like that made me want to laugh.I nodded and continued.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that all the monsters from this area were lured to the starting point. Perhaps everyone else who managed to run away at that time, are in a similar situation as us.\u201dI thought the best way to organize information in my head was to discuss it in points like this, one by one.\u201cLet\u2019s stop for a while and eat.\u201d\u201cYup, good idea.\u201dIt was when I was sitting on the floor, quietly munching on tasteless food that I wouldn\u2019t even feed a dog that\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026I heard a faint voice from somewhere.I wanted to pretend I didn\u2019t hear anything, but Park Deokgu raised his head and opened his mouth.\u201cIsn\u2019t this a human\u2019s voice?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cAhhhhh\u2026! Help me!\u201dThe voice was getting closer.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019They had realised that there were other people here.\u2018It was mistake.\u2019It certainly was a mistake.It was a mistake to carve out those marks on the walls with a dagger to prevent us from getting lost.I actually hoped that someone would come, but I never imagined it would be someone yelling at the top of their lungs, as if to wake up a whole town.\u201cH-hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cPick up your sword.\u201dIt was too late to avoid it.\u201cGeeek!\u201dLuckily, the monsters weren\u2019t many in number.It was nice to have new people join us, but it was also a very unwelcome situation.\u2018It would be a different story if they had drinking water and food\u2026\u2019There was the problem of limited resources.This wasn\u2019t a charity.I needed comrades in arms, not a new burden.It would be ideal if they were someone willing to fight, with drinking water and food, and only a small number of them.And by the sound of this voice, they had already failed one of those conditions.It wasn\u2019t someone who was willing to fight.\u201cHow annoying\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry too much, hyung-nim. It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of them.\u201d\u2018Easy to say for you.\u2019Park Deokgu ran forward with his sword and shield. I also immediately followed behind him with my spear.When I stepped closer, I could see a woman being chased by three monsters.Half torn clothes and overall a pretty face, but that was all her appearance had to offer.\u2018A civilian woman.\u2019I didn\u2019t care if she was scared and running away.She had no weapons and no food.After checking the abilities of monsters behind her, I used Mind\u2019s Eyes to observe the woman.[Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Jung Hayan.][Name: Jung Hayan][Title: None.

Rather, it\u2019s him who seems to be experienced with this\u2026 Didn\u2019t you see how he stabbed that monster in the head just now?\u201d\u201cI was lucky.\u201dAt Park Deokgu\u2019s words, this guy\u2019s gaze turned to me.\u2018Useless blabbing\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t easy to pretend to be innocent.Especially when I had ulterior motives in my mind.When I met his gaze, I felt as if he was looking right through me.I felt like I was standing here naked, and it wasn\u2019t a good feeling. My body trembled at this strange sensation.\u2018Is it just my imagination or some kind of magic?\u2019I didn\u2019t know which one it was, but it didn\u2019t matter anyway. The one thing I did know, and could sense, was that there was something wrong.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u2018Maybe he knows that I was reading his status window\u2026?\u2019If you look like you are reading something in the air, surely it would look unnatural for others.His disposition in the status window suggested that he was \u201cwell-meaning\u201d.However, the human heart wasn\u2019t just black or white.He returned to the past for some purpose. It was unlikely, but in the moment he decides we are his enemies, he might just swing his sword at us.No, I didn\u2019t want him to doubt me in any way.Just then, Park Deokgu opened his mouth with a smile.\u201cHyung-nim, why do you keep staring at your status window? Did you get a class?\u201d\u2018Nice, Park Deokgu.\u2019\u201cSort of. I will tell you in a minute.\u201dMy heart was still feeling uneasy.Instead of talking straight to this guy, I set my eyes on that woman named Jung Hayan.Her eyes were wide open and she breathed heavily. When she saw I was looking at her, she opened her mouth.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We were also looking for survivors.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cGet up. I will help you.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t want to cause any more trouble\u2026\u201dBut she was already at her limit.I reached out to her without a word, and then she held my hand as if she couldn\u2019t help it.My face felt sore because of Kim Hyunsung, who was looking this way.I quietly said to him.\u201cThank you for your help. I\u2019m Lee Kiyoung. That was the first time I\u2019d encountered three of those monsters at once\u2026 If not for you, we would\u2019ve been in trouble.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kim Hyunsung. I remember your face from somewhere.\u201d\u201cYou helped me a little at the starting point. I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 it was then\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Back then I was running away. It was insane\u2026\u201dActually I didn\u2019t remember much from then.Thinking about the situation at that time, it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to not remember.Suddenly, the scene of a woman being eaten by monsters flashed through my head. It was that woman I couldn\u2019t save.I shook my head, and said.\u201cAre you alone? It must have been hard for you\u2026\u201d\u201cFor now yes\u2026 but I\u2019m gathering survivors. Some of them are moving in groups.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gathering survivors. I heard a scream as I was passing by\u2026 Let\u2019s go together for now. We\u2019ve set up camp in a safe place.\u201dI saw Park Deokgu looking at me quietly. He was wordlessly asking me what to do.Kim Hyunsung opened his mouth again, as if he realized his words just now were a little rude.\u201cOh, excuse me. Would you like to come with me?\u201dOnly then did Park Deokgu nod his head.But I still had some reservations.\u201cHow many people are there?\u201d\u201cAbout 30, I think.\u201d\u201cWhat about those who can fight\u2026?\u201d\u201cNot many. If Deokgu-ssi and Kiyoung-ssi join, things will get a little better. I hope that you can come.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s worrying\u2026\u2019Just as I expected.I didn\u2019t know how well one\u2019s disposition in the status window reflected the heart of the person, but he was truly fit to be a Well-Meaning Arbitrator.\u2018What a slob.\u2019To put it nicely, he was an angel. Looking at it another way, he was a pushover.If the only thing those people at the survivor camp could do was scream, then the situation would rapidly deteriorate.Perhaps they have no way to eat properly there, and live in fear all the time.Increasing the number of people wasn\u2019t necessarily advantageous.When five people gather, there would always be one fool amongst them. In a gathering of 30 people, the problem would be even worse.Obviously, that\u2019s not the end of it.The power to cope with sudden crises will increase, but if there are too many people to protect, it will only get more chaotic.However, in reality, I had no other choice but to nod my head.It was because I was full of questions.What is regression, how did you get a class, how did you manage to start in a different way compared to others, how do you use magic and what is the method of clearing this tutorial?Kim Hyunsung knew how to attack this dungeon properly and, furthermore, had information about the continent.No matter how you look at it, it was best to follow him.\u201cI will go.\u201d\u201cGood decision. Let\u2019s get going then. More monsters may come here soon.\u201d\u201cYea.\u201d\u201cOh, right. This person is\u2026?\u201d\u201cMy name is Jung Hayan. Um, I\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Kim Hyunsung. \u201cWe roughly greeted each other.While supporting Jung Hayan, I started to slowly read this guy\u2019s face.His expression seemed a little different from when he was looking at me or Park Deokgu.His gaze remained on Jung Hayan for a long time.It was a little surprising.A strange sense of accomplishment was hidden in Kim Hyunsung\u2019s gaze. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a good analogy, but he looked like a man who had found an oasis in the desert.Or as if he had found his long lost family member.Maybe she noticed his intense gaze, because Jung Hayan also looked at him with caution in her eyes.If you stare at someone in this way, anyone would notice and become wary.He looked as if he was thinking \u201cI was looking for you\u201d. No, maybe he was indeed looking for her.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cPlease, let me know if there\u2019s any inconvenience.\u201d\u201cN-no, I\u2019m fine. J-Jung is really okay.\u201dLeaving those two to talk with each other, I started thinking.\u2018Let\u2019s assume.\u2019It was a little funny to think like this, but let\u2019s just assume.If I were to live the same life all over again.I didn\u2019t know how this guy ended up in his first life.Maybe he was happy with it or maybe unhappy. However, if this regression was done on purpose, it\u2019s very likely that this guy has regrets from his previous life.The One Who Failed.It was one of his titles.Even if it wasn\u2019t his intention.Humans are creatures of regret. Even if it was me, I would think about the what-ifs like if I could save that woman I saw at the beginning.If I had the strength, I might have made the choice to take that woman and escape together with Park Deokgu.What if I knew what would happen, and also knew about all the talented individuals that will be important in the future?In my case, I would try to change things that I regret. But of course, I wouldn\u2019t do only that.From the very start I would take advantage of everything I could.I would gather talented people, treasures, classes, and all other things that could be used.And I would eliminate all enemies or threats that I might encounter in the future.\u2018It\u2019s funny, but\u2026\u2019In this sense, if he has no reaction to me and Park Deokgu, it means that we are not important characters in the future, nor are we a threat to Kim Hyunsung in the futureWe must have been just passersby for him.\u201cMay I call you Hayan-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes. Thank you, and please call me as you like.\u201dBut this woman who was blushing at me now was different.Jung Hayan.A woman with explosive potential as a wizard or priest.If you think about it in connection with what I saw with my Mind\u2019s Eye, it is immediately obvious.\u2018She\u2019s a treasure.\u2019Now she didn\u2019t look like much.However, by aggregating the minute pieces of information so far and inferring further, I could come to a plausible conclusion.This civilian girl will rock the world in the future.I wasn\u2019t sure what she would do, but it was guaranteed that her position would be very important.It could also only be my delusion.Maybe Kim Hyunsung owed her something or had regrets around not saving her in his previous life.She might be just one of many passersby, just like me and Park Deokgu.But it\u2019s worth it.\u2018This woman.\u2019She was no longer a nuisance, but rather a precious treasure which had come rolling in.Right under my feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn fact, Jung Hayan wasn\u2019t the only treasure.The same applied to Kim Hyunsung as well.After all, he was someone who had probably once seen the end of this world.He knew what was going to happen and was willing to use this information to change the future.In a fantasy novel setting, he was kind of like the \u2018chosen warrior\u2019.There was no reason to not maintain a good relationship with him.\u2018I\u2019m jealous of this bastard though.\u2019I wasn\u2019t jealous of all of the baggage he was carrying on his back.I was jealous of what he was going to get or use.It was already set in stone that he would climb high.I thought I should benefit from him as much as I could.\u201cHow much further is it? Are you sure this is the right way?\u201d\u201cYes, we are almost there.\u201dPark Deokgu muttered bitterly, and Kim Hyunsung answered him with a nod.It was strangely novel for me to witness how he observed our surroundings without even slowing down.He was also watching out for monsters.Clearly, his stats weren\u2019t that high for now.Taking into account the fact that he had an attribute, class and magic power, he was already on a much higher ground than anyone else here. Yet, if a group of monsters surrounded us and attacked together, even he wouldn\u2019t be able to cope.\u2018That\u2019s why you failed to protect those people.\u2019If it had been possible then he would have made sure there were no casualties at the starting point.\u201cBy the way, there are more survivors than I imagined. I was pretty sure most of them would have died\u2026\u201d\u201cIn fact, more people could have been saved. At first, I didn\u2019t know the weak points of those monsters, so I couldn\u2019t face them properly. If only there were more people who could fight\u2026\u201d\u201cYea, I feel the same way. At that time, running away was all I could do\u2026 If not for hyung-nim, I would be dead right now. Are all 30 people from there?\u201d\u201cAh! Actually, no. It seems like there were other starting points at different locations. But they were quite far away from ours\u2026\u201d\u201cMhm\u2026 So we are not the only ones here.\u201d\u201cYes. Perhaps, if we expand our search, we will hear more good news. Just now I was looking for traces of other people.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how the hell you could call that good news.\u201cYou are looking for more survivors?\u201d\u201cOf course, I think that\u2019s what we should be doing.\u201dFrom his eyes, I knew he was telling the truth.The word \u201cgood\u201d attached to his disposition wasn\u2019t there only for decoration.I had no way of knowing the full picture, but my head hurt just thinking about how those 30 people were supposed to survive together.\u2018This son of a bitch\u2026\u2019Just from this, I could imagine how the survivor camp was running.\u201cYou don\u2019t look good. A-Am I too heavy\u2026?\u201dJung Hayan asked me, after seeing my darkening expression.\u201cOh, that\u2019s not it. I just thought about something\u2026\u201d\u201cI-If you feel uncomfortable\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s a little late, but thank you\u2026 for saving me.\u201dI smiled slightly at her words of gratitude.Supporting her was quite burdensome, but it didn\u2019t matter.It was because I thought I should score every little point from her while there was an opportunity.Jung Hayan\u2019s face was strangely red. It seemed like she wasn\u2019t used to making contact with the opposite sex.Rather than sticking too close to her, I tried to maintain a certain distance to lower her vigilance.While I tried to keep the smile of a good person on my face, Jung Hayan became more willing to lean on me.After we walked a bit further, we arrived at a wide space.\u2018Not bad.\u2019It was a pretty good place.There was only one entrance, what wasn\u2019t bad at all.There seemed to be some way to prevent monsters from entering, but I couldn\u2019t see it clearly from the outside.\u201cAmazing. How did you find this place?\u201d\u2018You already knew about it.\u2019\u201cI somehow stumbled upon it while I was looking for the right place for survivors to stay.\u201d\u201cYou are very lucky\u2026\u201dHe probably used this place in his previous life.It was different from the starting point where monsters could enter from every direction.It was a little crude, but very much like a sturdy castle.It was highly unlikely he found this place by accident. It was way too far away from the starting point.Little by little, I was more and more confident that this guy really came back in time.\u201cIt looks great. Doesn\u2019t it, hyung-nim?\u201dI nodded slightly.\u201cI think this place could even fit more than a hundred people.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cM-Maybe I exaggerated.\u201dWith enough people, we should be able to stop monsters from entering. However, the lack of a way to retreat was also a weakness.If a big number of monsters attacked us, it would end in slaughter.All but a few lucky ones would die. I looked at Kim Hyunsung, and slowly opened my mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s blocked from every other side. What if a large number of monsters try to invade through this one entrance\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we are acting as carefully as possible. We are also dealing with monsters in the nearby area.\u201d\u201cYou go hunting regularly?\u201d\u201cYes. Until we can find some other clues\u2026\u201dI was very curious. Just who else was up for this regular hunting?As we gradually approached the entrance, I could see some woman coming out to greet us. She was a little short, but gave an overall charming impression.\u201cHyunsung oppa, you are back? Ah, there are new people.\u201dI saw how she flinched a little at the sight of Park Deokgu, who had a robust body and was armed with sword and shield, but surprisingly, she didn\u2019t lose her smile.\u2018Nice reaction.\u2019She gave a good first impression.\u201cJihye-ssi.\u201d\u201cYou were running a little late, so I was worried about you.\u201d[Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Lee Jihye.][Name: Lee Jihye][Title: None.

She was trash to the extent that she was even further beyond help compared to me, but at the same time she was very similar to me.[Overview: Congratulations, player Lee Kiyoung. You have finally found your soulmate. It\u2019s possible that the two of you will be the perfect match for each other. Low stats, low potential. Trying to wield a sword or wand is not recommended. Alternatively, it might be a different story if, captivated by each other\u2019s lousy talents, the two of you choose to live out the rest of your lives together quietly. But I don\u2019t want the two of you to get together. I would feel sorry for the 2nd generation born from your union.]I tried hard to ignore all the insults packed in there. It was clear that the status window message was trying to provoke me.I quickly turned off the status window, and then recalled this woman\u2019s information in my mind.Her disposition was very eye-catching when paired with her lousy talent level and poor stats.\u2018Selfish Ambitionist.\u2019Maybe she was the same type of person as me.Unlike other people in this place, her way of interacting with Kim Hyunsung was very conspicuous.She had chosen to rub onto Kim Hyunsung in order to survive.\u201cHehe. May I know your names?\u201d\u201cPark Deokgu.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Lee Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cJ-Jung Hayan. Please, take good care of me.\u201d\u201cYes, nice to meet you all. In a moment, I will lead you to a place where you can rest. Are you okay, Hyunsung-ssi?\u201d\u201cOf course. Please, take care of them, Jihye-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes, leave it to me, Hyunsung oppa.\u201dShe clenched her fist in a cute manner, but knowing her disposition, I couldn\u2019t feel any warmth from it.Seeing how she scanned me, Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu up and down, maybe she was also calculating what role we would play after joining this place.In the case of Park Deokgu, who was carrying a sword and shield and had a huge body, it was an instant pass.As for Jung Hayan, who stumbled on her legs, and the miserable I, who supported her, it was most likely a failing grade.It was funny how she instantly stuck to Park Deokgu and chirped.\u201cHave you seen any monsters on your way here?\u201d\u201cNot only did I see them, but I\u2019ve already killed a few.\u201d\u201cOhhh\u2026 You weren\u2019t scared?\u201dA deliberate, slightly surprised expression.\u201cW-Well, of course I was scared, but\u2026 In fact, if not for hyung-nim, I wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201dAt the moment Park Deokgu uttered those useless words, Lee Jihye\u2019s gaze shifted to this side again.I didn\u2019t know if she was the same as me, but I could see what she was doing right now.\u201cAh. So you fought together with Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cSure we fought together! Every time hyung-nim stabbed with his spear, one monster bastard dropped dead.\u201d\u2018Shut up, you pig\u2026\u2019I wanted to shut up Park Deokgu\u2019s mouth.I guess he thought he was making me look more impressive in this way, but to me, it was way too much favouritism.At least I didn\u2019t have to worry about being backstabbed by him, but still, it was very embarrassing for me.Lee Jihye was amending her evaluation of my person.As Park Deokgu\u2019s hyung-nim, I was more important now.\u201cOh, I see. I\u2019m really glad to hear this. Our shelter will be a little safer now.\u201dA slightly raised tone of anticipation.However, I didn\u2019t feel good about it. Because, right now, other survivors were also staring at us.I checked all of them with my Mind\u2019s Eye, but there was no one special in my field of view.From this, I was able to identify just what kind of gaze those guys were sending our way.\u2018Relief.\u2019They were all relieved. The appearance of two guys with a spear, sword and shield made them sigh with relief.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dI expected something like this, but seeing it with my own eyes made me sigh.Kim Hyunsung made this place very safe.For them, not for us.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lee Jihye, who was laughing while standing in front of me, was probably the same.People nodded at us, obviously pleased to see two warriors, one with spear and another with sword, join them.\u2018That\u2019s not right\u2026\u2019At this rate I would become a meat shield.\u201cWell, I said I would lead you to a resting spot, but honestly, there\u2019s not much to show. There\u2019s only two sections here. One for men and another for women to live separately.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. And it\u2019s proper.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying that. I was a little worried\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about such a thing. Thanks for being our guide.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you. Hehe. Can I call you Deokgu oppa?\u201d\u201cI-If you want to\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are such a nice man.\u201dThis naive Park Deokgu was already half-way into the honey trap set by Lee Jihye. He sure felt good about being called \u2018oppa\u2019 by a woman six years his senior.\u201cAre you okay, Kiyoung-ssi?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so formal, call me as you like.\u201dFrom the corner of my eye, I noticed Jung Hayan\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t looking good.\u201cThen I will call you Kiyoung oppa. Hehe. Ah! Hayan-ssi, please, come this way. We have no set rules for living here, but Hyunsung-ssi will tell you everything you should know. I will take Hayan-ssi with me, and teach her a few things. Have a good rest.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 okay. Kiyoung-ssi, see you later then. Thank you so much for today.\u201d\u201cYes, see you later.\u201d\u201cYup!\u201dJung Hayan bowed her head, and then went to the women\u2019s section together with Lee Jihye.It seemed like there were a variety of unspoken rules here, but frankly, I wasn\u2019t very interested in this.What interested me was how we would now proceed.\u201cHyung-nim, don\u2019t you think this place seems quite lively?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Just\u2026\u201d\u201cJust\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so\u2026\u201dI wasn\u2019t happy with the idea of becoming a meat shield to keep this place safe, but if I changed my perspective a little, it actually wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.\u2018Only in this manner can I get what I need.\u2019This place offered endless opportunities.Safe hunting with Kim Hyunsung, help with getting a class and roping Jung Hayan onto my side.Perhaps it won\u2019t be smooth sailing, but that was a minor issue.The next morning, Kim Hyunsung called out Park Deokgu and I.\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d\u201cYea, thanks to you.\u201dPark Deokgu responded briefly to Kim Hyunsung\u2019s question.When it was only me and Deokgu I couldn\u2019t sleep properly, so it was the first night in this place where I could relax a little.I roughly knew what this guy was trying to get at. Instead of getting dragged into this by him, I bit the bullet, and opened my mouth first.\u201cI didn\u2019t see many people who could fight here. Most of them are women or injured. Or those who have no will to fight.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s quite embarrassing to admit.\u201d\u201cHow is this place holding up?\u201dIt was a pointed question to ask, but I was really curious about it.Only after a while did Kim Hyunsung slowly start speaking.\u201cActually, we are not doing that great.\u201dAs I expected.I rubbed my chin and said.\u201cThe lack of food and drinking water. No one to fight. And you, who has to take care of those 30 babies. Maybe even more, because their number will increase in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo far, you have been holding on, relying on food and drinking water you had stored in advance, but these resources will dwindle very soon, and there will be a need to find other solutions. Isn\u2019t that right? It will be very hard to get resources from the starting points scattered all over the place. Right now we have to deal with monsters in front of us, and yet, the unable-to-fight-burdens behind us are increasing in number.\u201d\u201cThey are not burdens.\u201d\u201cThey might not be burdens in the future, but right now they are.\u201dKim Hyunsung didn\u2019t answer, maybe he agreed with me to some degree.\u201cTo be honest, taking into the account the circumstances, leaving this place doesn\u2019t seem like a bad choice.\u201d\u201cYou are going to leave, Hyung-nim?\u201dI shook my head at Park Deokgu\u2019s words, and said,\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. But if we stay here, it won\u2019t do us any good.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHyunsung-ssi, I wouldn\u2019t say that this friend of mine and I are that great. He might be helpful, but as for me, not so much. Actually, all I can do is to stand in place and stab my spear forward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut still, I can fight together with others and serve as support. The same goes for this guy.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI pretended to be casual, but it was quite difficult.We were tired, both mentally and physically, and I suspected we might reach our limit soon.Although you didn\u2019t seem to know me and Park Deokgu, you must have been overjoyed to meet us.\u201cI\u2019m not a volunteer.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I roughly know what you wish to accomplish. Maybe all you want to do is let everyone survive and be safe. I can understand this way of thinking, but I\u2019m not like you, Hyunsung-ssi. I\u2019m not someone who is willing to be sacrificed for someone else who won\u2019t even share my hardships. You may call it selfish, but that\u2019s how I see it\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I understand. Of course, you have your own needs.\u201dCommunicating with him was smoother than I expected.I was worried he would stick to his righteousness, but thankfully that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cAlright. Then, firstly, we want dibs on a portion of the resources we find during future trips.\u201dHe nodded slightly.Probably, he thought that wasn\u2019t such a big demand.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d like to be included in your plan for the future.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s face stiffened a little.A moment later, he looked at me with an odd expression. He seemed to be a bit surprised.However, soon after, a faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cSo you knew.\u201d\u201cThat strange woman from the starting point gave us two big clues: attack and survive. It\u2019s just my personal view, but this second option seems impossible to achieve. Uh, well, if a small number of people monopolized a lot of resources, then maybe it could work. But I don\u2019t remember her saying anything about the exact duration we would have to live here for.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s no set time limit, gathering survivors isn\u2019t a good choice. Sure, they wouldn\u2019t get eaten by monsters, but they would starve to death. It\u2019s a forgone conclusion.\u201dI knew he was a regressor, so I was just telling him everything he should already know about.However, this guy seemed to admire my reasoning and the fact that I could deduce so much just by putting together small pieces of information.In fact, when I raised my eyes, I could see him lowering his head a little.I was right.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m happy to work together with you.\u201d\u201cLikewise\u2026\u201dI held his outstretched hand. There was a strange sense of trust in his eyes.He was aware that I wasn\u2019t strong enough.But in his mind, I might be the shining example of a useful talent now.For example, as a type of person fit to be an analyst or administrator.***\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dEver since Kim Hyunsung joined us, hunting had become much easier.That wasn\u2019t all.Now I held even more faith in what Mind\u2019s Eye was showing me.\u201cDeokgu!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dObviously, Kim Hyunsung seemed to be very experienced in using the sword.Sometimes he deliberately made mistakes, as if he wanted to hide his skill level, but the way he reacted every time Park Deokgu was in danger made it hard to see him as a person who only recently started using the sword.\u2018Good.\u2019While Park Deokgu was holding several monsters in place, Kim Hyunsung and I were dealing with them from the sides.They were sensitive to sound, so to get their attention Park Deokgu was hitting his shield with his sword.I was still unused to wielding a spear, and my hands trembled.As I stabbed a monster rushing at Park Deokgu, the spear fell out of my hands.But then Park Deokgu finished it with a slam of his shield.\u201cHaa!\u201d\u201cLooks like a few more are coming. Let me take care of them. In the meantime\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. Deokgu, let\u2019s grab the food.\u201d\u201cI already took it, Kiyoung Hyung-nim\u2026 What do you think he was doing when he lived on Earth?\u201d\u201cNo idea. But I doubt he was using swords there. His skills are probably the result of acquiring a class.\u201d\u201cOh well, you have to admit he is hella good at this.\u201dUsing his high agility, Kim Hyunsung was avoiding every strike and cut down enemies with precision.From far away it seemed simple, but in practice it wasn\u2019t simple at all.The reason why Kim Hyunsung was going ahead alone sometimes was because Park Deokgu already knew that he had a class.Ever since hearing about this, Park Deokgu seemed to be a little nervous.He had yet to unlock any class, and he was feeling stressed about this.\u201cHaa!\u201dWhile Kim Hyunsung killed the remaining monsters, Park Deokgu observed him quietly.His eyes were full of amazement.\u201cAh, there are fewer monsters than I expected around this starting point area.\u201d\u201cMaybe he cleared this area before.\u201d\u201cYou mean Kim Hyunsung?\u201d\u201cYea. There\u2019s a lot of food here, but it seems like no one survived\u2026 Well, if there were survivors, there would be no food left.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t really think the three of us would be enough to secure resources from the starting point.\u201d\u201cYou helped a lot.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do much, did I? It\u2019s all thanks to that guy.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not only thanks to him. If not for you, it would\u2019ve been much harder for us to get here.\u201dI didn\u2019t say those words only out of comfort.It was true that Park Deokgu made it much easier for us to come all the way here. No matter how good at fighting Kim Hyunsung was, he was only a single person after all. It would be difficult for him to tackle all the monsters attacking him from every direction alone.Although Park Deokgu was still in his growing phase, it was clear that his potential would allow him to become someone who could lift a heavy burden off his allies in battle.It was when I was checking my status window to see if any of my stats had risen that\u2026\u201cHuh? Hyung-nim.\u201dI heard Park Deokgu\u2019s startled voice at the same moment I saw a new message in front of me.[Several classes have been unlocked. Please select the class of your choice.]\u2018Good.\u2019It was faster than I thought.[View unlocked classes.][Warrior (Common)][Archer (Common)][Wizard (Common)][Commander (Rare)]One very attractive class came into my view.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018A [Commander]?\u2019This one line glowed blue, while the other three were white.I guess it was because of the rare grade. For now, I began reading the class descriptions from top to bottom.[Warrior (Common)]A capable warrior fighting at the forefront of a battle is a must-have for every party. After changing to this class, you will gain basic knowledge on using all kinds of melee weapons such as swords, spears, axes and so on. Afterwards, you will be able to unlock other melee classes, such as [Barbarian], [Knight], [Paladin], [Cavalryman], [Mercenary] and more. Strength, vitality and endurance are increased by 1 point each.[Archer (Common)]An archer specialises in ranged attacks. After changing to this class, you will gain basic knowledge on using bows and arrows. In addition to being able to unlock adjacent class paths such as [Thief] and [Assassin], you will also have a chance to advance to a higher grade [Archer] class such as [Spirit Archer] or [Magic Archer]. Agility is increased by 3 points.[Wizard (Common)]A [Wizard] is a long range class with the ability to use magic. After changing to this class, you will gain basic knowledge on using magic. Later on, you can unlock other classes such as [Warlock], [Alchemist] or [Summoner]. Magic power is increased by 3 points.The first three options didn\u2019t look too bad.Choosing [Warrior] would improve my three stats that were the most difficult to raise, while choosing [Archer] would allow me to learn how to use ranged weapons\u2026 For someone like me, who just wanted to chill at the back, it was a very appealing class.Likewise for [Wizard]. It would boost my magic power, which was still an unknown factor for me.However, what I was the most curious about, was the rare class that appeared, [Commander].[Commander (Rare)]This class has little to do with combat skills. Instead of participating in actual combat, a person with this class reads the situation of the battlefield and gives orders from behind. Changing to this class would provide a wider field of view. It\u2019s not known what other classes you could unlock later. Intelligence is increased by 1 point.Honestly, until I read the description, my mind was set on [Commander].However, now that I had learned the pros and cons of all the classes available, I felt a headache incoming.A [Commander\u2019s] abilities weren\u2019t that bad.\u2018But what\u2019s the point of having a wider field of view here?\u2019And it only increased my intelligence by 1 point.When you take into account that all other classes offered me 3 extra points, I would lose out on 2 points.And that wasn\u2019t all.\u2018What about my path of development for the future\u2026?\u2019It was unsettling that there were no mentions of any possible class to be unlocked afterwards.I then remembered that Kim Hyunsung\u2019s class was also a common grade one, [Swordsman].It was very possible that he had unlocked some other classes with a rare or even heroic grade.However, as someone with the Sword Expert attribute, he set his sights on being a [Swordsman]. He probably tried to follow the path he already knew instead of trying something new with lower efficiency.While I was thinking about this, I saw Kim Hyunsung coming this way.\u201cLooks like you guys unlocked some classes.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFor this guy, who already knew his own direction of growth, choosing a class was just a formality. On the other hand, I had a lot to worry about because this choice would decide my future. Park Deokgu then opened his mouth, asking for advice.\u201cHyung-nim, this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just not sure about this. I have Warrior and Priest as options, both of which are of common rank. I also see a rare grade class, Shieldman, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cYou have Priest in your options?\u201d\u201cFor Priest, I could change to Paladin afterwards\u2026 and it seems like Warrior can change to Berserker, but\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a rare class at first?\u201dConsidering Park Deokgu\u2019s potential was the highest for vitality and endurance, [Shieldman] indeed seemed like the right choice for him.\u201cShieldman\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it says that this class is all about defense. It explains that there are bonuses to using a shield, but the problem is that it\u2019s unknown what other classes I could unlock later. Oh, and I would lose 2 points of my strength\u2026 but at the same time I would gain 3 points in endurance and vitality.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound bad.\u201dIt was Kim Hyunsung who spoke before I could even open my mouth. He offered his advice even though he wasn\u2019t asked.\u201cYou seem to be someone who has high endurance\u2026 Your strength would drop, but such a big rise in endurance and vitality would be amazing. And even if you lose 2 points of strength, you will still be 4 stat points ahead.\u201d\u2018Indeed.\u2019In an online game, the presence of a tanker, a warrior who fights in the forefront, would be essential.Seeing Kim Hyunsung\u2019s reaction, the system here wasn\u2019t that much different.Not only priests, but tankers were also valuable here.\u201cHmm\u2026 You think so?\u201d\u201cHave you unlocked any attributes yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cAs for me, I have a common grade class, Swordsman, and an attribute that boosts my damage. At first, I wanted to choose Warrior to increase my strength, but I had a hunch that a swordsman with great increase in agility would be a better option for me. Afterwards, I unlocked an attribute by accident, so I think my choice of class was the right one.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHe was the type of guy who expressed his opinion openly.The quality of the class itself wasn\u2019t too important. The most important thing was how well this class balanced itself with the stats, attributes and abilities of a person.So it was all about what had the best efficiency.Although he didn\u2019t insist on it too strongly, Kim Hyunsung clearly wished for Park Deokgu to choose the rare grade [Shieldman] class.\u201cWhat do you think, Hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cMy opinion is similar. It\u2019s unknown if in the future you would get any attributes that increase your damage, but we have Hyunsung-ssi after all, and he can make up for your lack of attack power. And it would be nice if you could increase your stats by 4 points\u2026 But still, the choice is yours.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about Priest then\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the worst choice.\u201d[Priest] was the worst option here.I just couldn\u2019t imagine him with this class. Maybe it could work if he later changed to something like [Paladin], but\u2026Park Deokgu\u2019s talent for magic wasn\u2019t particularly great.After a while, for a short amount of time, Park Deokgu\u2019s body shined with a blue light.He had successfully changed his class.\u201cWhat did you choose?\u201d\u201cJust as you said, Shieldman seems to be the most suitable class for me.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI think that even now I can protect you pretty well, Hyung-nim, but it would be nice if I could do so even better. And as for the offensive, I guess it\u2019s not bad to leave it to others. Playing with magic seems to be dangerous, what if I explode because of it? That said, being on the frontlines is a little scary, but I think I can handle it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good choice.\u201dKim Hyunsung also approvingly nodded his head, then turned to me.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I ask what Kiyoung-ssi chose?\u201dI was silent for a moment, before answering.\u201cI haven\u2019t chosen anything yet. I have three options for common grade classes: Warrior, Archer and Wizard, and also one rare grade class: Commander.\u201d\u201cCommander\u2026\u201dI noticed his facial muscles stiffened for a second.\u2018It\u2019s a trap card.\u2019This barely perceptible reaction made me convinced that [Commander] was a trap card here.\u201cUm\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cOh my god, Hyung-nim! Commander! This class would be perfect for you! I just know it!\u201d\u201cY-Yes?\u201d\u201cI mean, aren\u2019t you totally like some cool commander, Hyung-nim? Just imagining you giving orders from behind like a boss\u2026 Khh\u2026 Under Hyung-nim\u2019s command I will surely win every battle!\u201dPark Deokgu was full of excitement, but honestly, I didn\u2019t see myself as a commander type.And also\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t know anything about war strategy.\u2019I had never ever read any book about the art of war.I wasn\u2019t very good at playing chess or Go, and I didn\u2019t have a particularly outstanding mind compared to others.If you asked me about my experience in this area, I could only think about this short time in the distant past, when I played some online strategy game. I don\u2019t even remember what its name was now.In fact, with my character, I was more fit to be a scammer rather than a commander. I guess [Thief] would be quite a fair option for me.\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to give me orders, Hyung-nim!\u201d\u2018This bastard\u2026\u2019He was cute.Apparently, he already thought I would choose [Commander].\u201cIt says this class would provide me with a wider field of vision and 1 point increase in my intelligence. As for other classes, you guys probably know about them.\u201d\u201cWith this class, there\u2019s little to no gain. At least the other three would increase your starts by 3 points\u2026\u201dI felt my throat getting dry. Becoming a rare grade [Commander] was definitely a trap.\u201cYou have to be a Commander! Commander!\u201dI decided to ignore this idiot who was getting all excited by himself, and pondered more deeply on this problem.\u201cHaving a rare grade class for now would be nice, but I\u2019m also worried whether this class would enable me to advance to something better in the future. All the other classes are of common grade, but it\u2019s obvious they won\u2019t stay like this. Choosing your first class is very important, so\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you Hyung-nim, you should be a Commander! Commander! Please, command me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think the Archer class wouldn\u2019t be so bad for you, Kiyoung-ssi. It would help us a lot, if you could attack from a distance\u2026 and later on you could change to something like Thief\u2026\u201cHyung-nim, choose Commander! Commander! Let me follow you!\u201d\u201cFor now\u2026 it would be more helpful to increase your stats.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to argue about here! Hyung-nim was born to be a commander! He has to be a Commander no matter what!\u201d\u201cArcher would be better for him\u2026\u201d\u201cCommander is better!\u201d\u201cArcher\u2026\u201d\u201cCommander!\u201d\u201cArcher\u2026\u201d\u201cCommander!\u201d\u201cArcher!\u201d\u201cCommander!\u201d\u201cArcher is better!\u201d\u201cCommander is even better!!!\u201dThey were just making me more confused.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019I left those two guys to argue by themselves.Kim Hyunsung seemed to know a little about the disadvantages of being a [Commander], and he wanted to recommend the [Archer] class to me. However, he didn\u2019t know about my poor talent.\u2018Should I choose [Archer].\u2019Choosing [Commander] went hand in hand with some potential problems, but [Wizard] was actually quite tempting for me. Although my magic power was truly a sad sight, I felt I could work around it, relying on my high intelligence.[1]\u2018What should I do?\u2019The most important thing was to make the best use of my strong points. Anyway, my Mind\u2019s Eye already told me that I was a hopeless case.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIn the end, I had to choose a class that seemed to be the most efficient for me.As I made my decision, I closed my eyes and with a flash of light I could feel how my body changed a little.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dI successfully changed my class.Kim Hyunsung and Park Deokgu spoke at the same time.\u201cCommander?\u201d \u201cArcher?\u201d***[1] To lessen your confusion. In chapter 1 by other translator Kiyoung\u2019s potential for all stats was \u201ccommon grade\u201d but it wasn\u2019t right. He has \u201cheroic grade\u201d for intelligence and luck. In next chapter we will have update of his status window so you can see it more clearly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kim Hyunsung was obviously a little dejected, but otherwise didn\u2019t seem to think it was a bad decision.Although an [Archer]\u2019s ability to use bows was very attractive, my low agility wouldn\u2019t allow me to utilise it well. I didn\u2019t know if changes could happen in the future, but right now my ability stat had little potential for growth.There was no point in forcing myself to do something that didn\u2019t suit me.Naturally, even if I had chosen [Archer] and became a [Thief] later on, I would still have to worry about this very same thing.In fact, the same could be said about the [Wizard] class. I already knew that I wasn\u2019t going to be a skilled magic user, but\u2026\u2018I have to take advantage of my strengths.\u2019I figured that the best path forward would be to make use of my high intelligence. Considering the various ways this class could branch out, there had to be a class where high mana wasn\u2019t a barrier to growth.\u201cMay I ask why you chose Wizard?\u201dI shook my head slightly, and said,\u201cJust a hunch.\u201dI had no other choice.Even if I had chosen [Commander], I would\u2019ve only gained 1 extra stat point.Gaining a three point boost to mana, which was still uncharted territory to me, seemed like a boon in comparison.\u201cI see.\u201dHe seemed to have been convinced.I felt a little bitter. If only he could see my growth potential, he would know there was no hope for me.[Acquired basic knowledge of elementary magic.][Due to the effect of the class, the mana stat increased by 3 points.][Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Lee Kiyoung.][Name: Lee Kiyoung][Title: None.

But I applaud you for getting a class. Selecting [Wizard] may well be a very good choice for you. If you hadn\u2019t, it would be difficult to feel magic given your talent. The extra 3 points of mana may look promising, but I recommend that you don\u2019t raise your hopes on being a good Wizard. You will only be left with disappointment.]\u2018This son of a bitch\u2026\u2019For some reason the overview message didn\u2019t criticize my choice as much as I thought it would.It was still insulting, but at least I got an approving nod for learning to use mana.There were many changes to my status window.I also felt like I roughly understood what it meant to acquire knowledge on the basics of magic.New knowledge poured into my head.All of it was literally only foundational knowledge, so there was nothing too complicated. It explained the concept of magic, how to move mana, how to cast spells by using mana, and it also provided an introduction to the concepts of chimeras and incantations.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201dIt was a little different from what I had imagined.I couldn\u2019t quite pin it down in words, but I felt like I was solving some formula I\u2019d never seen before, or like I was building a tower with my mana.Knowledge of things that were completely unfamiliar to me, such as chimeras and incantations, continued to accumulate in my mind.\u2018For now, at least, it seems like it was worth it.\u2019Unlike the benefits of the [Commander] class, I could use this power as soon as I adapted to it.When I slowly closed my eyes and felt the mana inside me, it welled up immediately.My level of mana was only in the single digits, so I felt really grateful that it moved according to my will.While I was still operating mana in my mind, Kim Hyunsung, who had been observing me, opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s go back then. We\u2019ve already been delayed by a lot. As for food\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo bags are enough for us.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter packing up two bags, Park Deokgu handed the rest over to Kim Hyunsung.He nodded, and revealed a look of gratitude.Perhaps he thought we were being considerate of him.We had retrieved about 12 leather bags full of food from this starting point. If you thought about Park Deokgu\u2019s contribution in attracting the monsters\u2019 aggro, only asking for 2 bags was a bargain.\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s no need for thanks. Without Hyunsung-ssi, we wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to even get these two bags\u2026 Given everything you\u2019ve done for us, it\u2019s only natural that we repay your help in kind.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go feed the people.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do about the others, by the way? We can\u2019t keep helping them like this.\u201d\u201cThose who aren\u2019t willing to fight would only get in the way. I don\u2019t want there to be any unnecessary victims\u2026 It may be good to put them through training to adapt to the circumstances then take them to hunt monsters one by one.\u201cI don\u2019t think that would work.\u201dIf you thought about it, Park Deokgu had also completed this kind of training to adapt.But I didn\u2019t bother to say this out loud.\u201cIt might not work. But for now, I think we could try it out with just one other person, with your permission of course. Would you guys be okay with that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind\u2026 But how about you, Hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also okay with this. Just, can I suggest someone right now?\u201d\u201cDo you have anyone in mind\u2026?\u201d\u201cI was thinking of Jung Hayan, if she\u2019s fine with it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dKim Hyunsung nodded his head happily.It was no exaggeration to say that Jung Hayan was like a lottery ticket that was certain to win a jackpot.I had already confirmed her talent with my Mind\u2019s Eye, and Kim Hyunsung most likely knew about her future achievements.I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when I saw his delighted expression.The way back to the shelter was quite comfortable. Due to the fact that we would inevitably leave the shelter unprotected whilst we travelled to the starting point, we had cleared out the area beforehand.As we approached the shelter, several people, including Lee Jihye, ran out to greet Kim Hyunsung.\u201cAh, Hyunsung-ssi! Deokgu oppa and Kiyoungie oppa also worked hard. Let us take those for you\u2026\u201dI could see those guys taking bags from Kim Hyunsungie as though it were only natural.One man, who seemed to have an injured leg, snuck his hand towards our side as well, so I shook him off, and said,\u201cWe will carry our bags ourselves.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026\u201dI drew a clear line between us and their system of distribution.Funnily enough, I could clearly see an expression of disapproval on his face.He seemed to be thinking something along the lines of, \u2018Who do you guys even think you are?\u2019The corners of my mouth rose for a moment, but he likely didn\u2019t see it. Not minding my actions, Kim Hyunsung was quietly speaking with Lee Jihye.\u201cThis is the food that we obtained from the starting point. I want Jihye-ssi to distribute it amongst the people inside the shelter.\u201d\u201cAlright! Leave it to me, Hyunsung-ssi. By any chance, were there any survivors\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cI-I see. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d\u201cMaybe some of them are still alive nearby. Sooner or later, we\u2019ll have to search that area again.\u201d\u201cAh! Right\u2026\u201dThere probably wouldn\u2019t be enough food. Kim Hyunsungie had only brought ten bags.Thirty people wouldn\u2019t be able to eat their fill after sharing it amongst themselves.I could still hold out for now, but I was already feeling hungry myself.Park Deokgu and I, carrying our two bags, walked past the leeches surrounding Kim Hyunsung and headed inside.Inexplicable gazes followed us all the while.While walking, Park Deokgu spoke with a hint of uneasiness.\u201cHyung-nim, you really won\u2019t share with them?\u201d\u201cWe are not volunteers.\u201d\u201cWell, I know that but\u2026 I don\u2019t feel very good about it. And the expressions of those people who went out to greet us were kinda\u2026\u201cWhy do you care about how they look at you?\u201d\u201cI-I just don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who should be thanking us for risking our lives and bringing them food, Deokgu. The idea of even supporting baggage like them is laughable. The place we\u2019re staying in right now is Kim Hyunsung\u2019s shelter. We\u2019re not one of them. We helped them as much as we were helped, and we even gave up some food that we were supposed to get. It\u2019s the least we could do. Kim Hyunsung knows that, which is why he hasn\u2019t said anything\u2026\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIf they want better treatment, they can also pick up a sword. Well, maybe if I were in their shoes, I would also have had a hard time doing that\u2026 Maybe Kim Hyunsung wants them to be motivated by us. I\u2019m not sure what the outcome will be.\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 So when they see us taking so much food, they would realise they also have to fight to be treated likewise?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the desired effect.\u201dThat guy wasn\u2019t stupid. It was possible that he was hoping for something along those lines to occur.While we were trudging over to the place where we usually stayed, I couldn\u2019t see Jung Hayan anywhere.I had wondered if there was any work for those who didn\u2019t go out hunting, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone who was actually idle.Some were cleaning up their surroundings, while others moved heavy stones to fortify the shelter.Perhaps Jung Hayan was also doing some kind of work. It was obvious who had managed this place while we were gone.\u2018Lee Jihye.\u2019She was in charge of these people.It was her job to distribute food and report any issues to Kim Hyunsung.She was also the first to come out to greet him.While thinking about this, I felt the corners of my mouth rising up for a moment.\u201cDeokgu-yah.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDo you remember Jung Hayan?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the lady with the injured leg who was clinging onto you earlier?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI took out some food from my bag and handed it to Park Deokgu.\u201cI want you to give this to her, and see if she\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cHyung-nim, why are you\u2026 ah\u2026\u201dSomething about his expression didn\u2019t seem right.\u201cI understand. Very well, you can leave it to me!\u201dThis guy caught onto my intention at once.We hadn\u2019t been together for long, but he was already starting to get better at understanding what I wanted from him.He understood that I was trying to get her.Of course, I didn\u2019t mean it in a romantic way, but it was surprisingly easy to make people think otherwise.Especially in a situation like this.From what I could remember, Jung Hayan\u2019s disposition was \u2018Pure Advocate\u2019.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s disposition, \u2018Well-Meaning Arbitrator\u2019, appeared to be slightly similar, but the two were clearly different.\u2018Pure\u2019 and \u2018Well-Meaning\u2019 were clearly different.\u201cPure things are easily dyed.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dPerhaps this small experiment would be enough to prove what I had said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would be stranger if, in a situation like this one, there were no subtle differences in ranks.As long as it was a place people inhabited, it was a natural outcome.\u201cFirst of all.\u201dAt the very top of the pyramid was Kim Hyunsung, the man who had built this place.I didn\u2019t know what had occurred whilst finding this shelter, but the people here certainly placed a lot of trust in Kim Hyunsung.I would have had a similar reaction.Of course, it was a natural reaction for someone who had suddenly fallen into an unknown land crawling with monsters.The fact that there was a guy willing to pick up a sword and stand up against those monsters was very reassuring, especially since that guy was foolishly kind.It was no wonder then, that people admired him.Next up was Lee Jihye. A woman who had an unexpected windfall from being with Kim Hyunsung.Unlike Kim Hyunsung, who frequently roamed outside, she spent most of her time in the shelter, managing food distribution, guarding the shelter, and other essential tasks.There were also some people who could be considered part of \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019s Unit\u2019 that held significant authority.Of course, while Kim Hyunsung was here, they couldn\u2019t abuse or openly take advantage of their power, but it was inevitable whilst he was gone.\u201cThen where are we, Hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cYou could say that we\u2019re right under Kim Hyunsung, because we have the strength to fight and retrieve food.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probable that they\u2019re dissatisfied with us right now.\u201d\u201cBut at first\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, they were sweet to us at first. But I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t like what happened yesterday. It was like implying that we want to be independent. To put it bluntly: \u2018It\u2019s not our job to feed you.\u2019 That was likely the last nail in the coffin.\u201d\u201cBut part of the food they took was ours. Isn\u2019t it natural to say, thanks, instead?\u201d\u201cOf course, there are people like that too, but\u2026 It\u2019s human nature to try to keep new powers in check. Even if it\u2019s just within a small group of people.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that Kim Hyunsung is keeping us in check?\u201d\u201cNo, Kim Hyunsung doesn\u2019t think of this place as his own in the first place.\u201d\u201cThen who the hell is so wary of us\u2026?\u201d\u201cPeople who think this place belongs to them.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Kim Hyunsung who was pretending to rule. It was Lee Jihye, the one who was profiting off of him.\u201cI think I know what you mean.\u201d\u201cKim Hyunsung is the figurehead of this group, but she\u2019s the one controlling it. In the first place, Kim Hyunsung doesn\u2019t have time to manage this place since he spends most of his time outside. Where might is required, the one with strength is king, and where food and shelter are a priority, the one grasping them is king. Kim Hyunsung has power, but it\u2019s that woman who has food and shelter.\u201d\u201cYou mean Lee Jihye?\u201dI nodded slightly.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOne more loaf of bread is enough to win people over and you can send away those you\u2019re wary of. Power is created by discrimination. Jung Hayan is probably one of the ones who aren\u2019t favoured by Lee Jihye\u2026 That\u2019s why she was separated from the group and sent out to do rough work.\u201d\u201cSince when have you been paying so much attention to Hayan-ssi?\u201d\u201cIn the future we will have to keep an even closer eye on her.\u201dPark Deokgu nodded quietly.Watching over Jung Hayan was just the beginning.It was an impulsive judgement based on Lee Jihye and Jung Hayan\u2019s dispositions, \u2018Selfish Ambitionist\u2019 and \u2018Pure Advocate\u2019. Even so, I thought that I could perhaps really achieve the results I wanted.***\u201cHayan-ssi, you need to do your job properly.\u201d\u201cYes? Okay\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone is working hard. Hayan-ssi isn\u2019t the only one who has it difficult. In a situation like this, we all have to work together\u2026 If you keep up this attitude, we\u2019ll have no choice but to reduce your rations.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019\u2026 As you may have heard, things aren\u2019t looking bright. It\u2019s not easy to get food from other places, and we also don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have to stay here. If a monster comes while Hyunsung-ssi is out, we\u2019ll be slaughtered. That\u2019s why building walls is so important.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u201cTsk. If you don\u2019t want to get kicked out, don\u2019t slack off and work hard. As more survivors are found, there won\u2019t be any space left for Hayan-ssi. I just don\u2019t understand why people who\u2019ve just joined are so selfish\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just do your job properly.\u201d\u201cYes, okay. I understand.\u201dShe could see the man who anxiously spoke out turning away.Subconsciously, she lowered her head.She wasn\u2019t sure what she had done wrong in his mind, but he didn\u2019t seem to like anything she did.No, it was natural to not like it.It was no wonder he was unhappy. It has been a few days already, and she still wasn\u2019t able to fulfill her assigned workload.\u2018Stupid.\u2019She had always heard words such as \u2018slow\u2019 or \u2018slug-like\u2019, but she hated herself for not being able to move faster even in this situation.\u2018It hurts.\u2019She looked down slightly, and saw her ragged hands. Her fingernails were almost gone. It was painful, but she could definitely empathise with what she had just been told.\u2018Everyone is working hard.\u2019Everyone was doing their best to survive.Hyunsung-ssi, Kiyoung-ssi and Deokgu-ssi, who were out fighting against monsters, as well as the people who were building walls together.Compared to before, when she had been frantically running around on her own, not knowing when she would die, this place was akin to heaven.If Kiyoung-ssi hadn\u2019t helped her at that time, she would have been killed by monsters.As she remembered how she had clung to him almost the whole way here, her face flushed red.That was the first time she had been in such proximity with a man.As she recalled that memory in a daze, she raised her head when she heard a voice coming from beside her.\u201cHayan-ssi, I know you have it hard. Let me take that.\u201d\u201cAh, Seokwoo-ssi.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably also been under a lot of stress lately.\u201d\u201cI-Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes, Hyunsung-ssi has been going out a lot lately, so building fortifications is very important right now. Jihye-ssi must be thinking the same thing. We don\u2019t know how long we are going to be here, so we have to do everything we can. You\u2019ll have to understand.\u201d\u201cAh, I-I know.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be particularly sensitive today. I think Hayan-ssi is one of the hardest working people here\u2026 I\u2019ll talk to him later. Let\u2019s go eat together first.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cI heard yesterday that Hyunsung-ssi got food from the starting point.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard it from Jihye-ssi, so it must be true.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief, hehe.\u201dYoo Seokwoo.He was a man who spoke his mind.Of course, since he was in charge of her, helping her benefited him too, but most of the time he seemed to just want to chat.\u201cBy the way, isn\u2019t this work hard?\u201d\u201cO-Of course it\u2019s hard, but there are definitely others who have it rougher.\u201d\u201cBut still, it\u2019s not an easy job\u2026 You know, you could cheat a bit.\u201d\u201cNo. I can\u2019t even finish the work assigned to me in the first place\u2026 I can\u2019t cheat. Seokwoo-ssi is injured, but you still work with us\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m overseeing everything, so I don\u2019t have to do much, haha. Actually, I have no problem with this, haha.\u201dWhile chatting about various things, they arrived at the food distribution table.She could see a few people lining up.Park Deokgu and Lee Kiyoung were nowhere in sight. It was possible that they had already finished their meal or had left to go elsewhere.\u2018It hasn\u2019t been long since they came back from hunting.\u2019Surely they would want to rest.\u201cLine up and stand here. You can wait for your turn.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAh. Yes.\u201dAfter receiving the food, they settled down in a nice spot. She could see others who were gathering together to eat.A brief thought crossed her mind to sneak over and join them. However, perhaps because of her timid personality, it wasn\u2019t easy for her to talk or hang out with others in the first place.\u201cThese circumstances are hard for them as well.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI mean the others. It\u2019s tough for everyone. No one can afford to take care of anyone else, and in the case of Hayan-ssi, who came here a bit later, they\u2019re probably even more reluctant.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I-I guess so. A-And I can\u2019t do my job properly\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Hayan-ssi, you work harder than anyone else. With time, when you get used to it, everyone will accept Hayan-ssi. Just like I do now.\u201d\u201cT-Thank you for taking such good care of me.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I just want to get closer to Hayan-ssi.\u201d\u201cOh! So do I. Thank you for always helping me.\u201dNow that she thought of it, she had received a lot of help from this person.From the very beginning, he had been the first to approach her and help her make connections. He had made her time here a lot smoother.\u2018Thank you.\u2019It happened while she was placing a piece of bread into her mouth. She could feel Yoo Seokwoo grabbing her hand.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dShe tried to pull back, but he didn\u2019t let go.She turned her head and saw Yoo Seokwoo looking at her.\u201cL-Let go of me. P-Please\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cL-Let go. Why, all of a sudden\u2026?\u201d\u201cBut just now\u2026\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dShe looked around hurriedly, but there was no one else there. It felt like Yoo Seokwoo\u2019s always-smiling eyes had changed a little.His smile was nowhere to be seen and a look of ridicule had taken its place.\u201cHayan-ssi.\u201d\u201cY-Yes?\u201d\u201cDid you think that I was doing you a favour?\u201d\u201cW-What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIf you are taking something, you also have to give something back. You really don\u2019t know shit.\u201d\u201cW-What are you saying. W-Why are you being like this\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know how much I\u2019ve done for you, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI-I don\u2019t know much about that. I appreciate your help, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Are you really that stupid? Or are you just pretending to be stupid? Should I be more direct?\u201d\u201cJ-Just let go of my hand now. Ah, it hurts. It hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you want your time here to stay pleasant in the future, you better be nice to me. You stupid woman. You still haven\u2019t figured it out?\u201dHis eyes were scary. She had never seen anyone look at her like that before.She didn\u2019t even know why things had turned out this way.What she knew for sure was that she wanted to get out of there.As she desperately tried to pull her hand away, she heard a loud voice from behind her.\u201cHey, Hyung-ssi. If you don\u2019t want that hand of yours to be broken, you better let go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Alright, it\u2019s not broken, so don\u2019t be such a crybaby.\u201d\u201cAaaaagh\u2026\u201dA large fist cut through the air once more. The sound of an impact rang out as the blow fell precisely on Yoo Seokwoo\u2019s head.It was almost unreal to see him sent sprawling to the floor as though a heavy, blunt weapon had struck him.\u201cAhhhh! Uh\u2026 Uhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cQuit pretending. I didn\u2019t even hit you that hard\u2026 Someone might think you were a wailing newborn with all the racket you\u2019re making.A big foot struck out, and Yoo Seokwoo\u2019s body was thrown into the air.He had been kicked.Seeing him crashing into the wall, Jung Hayan was afraid that the situation would spiral into something bigger.\u201cI-It\u2019s okay now, so please stop. You\u2019re going to hurt him. Deok-Deokgu-ssi.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe glare he shot in Yoo Seokwoo\u2019s direction was vaguely terrifying.However, if she didn\u2019t stop him now, then perhaps Yoo Seokwoo\u2019s death would really come to pass.Seeing Yoo Seokwoo hunched over and trembling on the ground made her anxious.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Noonim. All I did was give him a little shove and a kick. Well, this Hyung-ssi is just a cry-baby\u2026\u201dThat wasn\u2019t why she was anxious.She could see some people rushing over after hearing Yoo Seokwoo\u2019s screams.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Seokwoo-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dThe most conspicuous of them was, of course, Lee Jihye. As she led her herd towards them, abject confusion shone in her eyes.\u201cHey, what the hell is going on here? Violence is forbidden within the shelter.\u201d\u201cThat man sexually harassed Hayan-ssi. So I gave him a beating.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cI saw it with my own two eyes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026not.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cO-of course, it might have looked misleading because I grabbed Hayan-ssi\u2019s hand\u2026 B-But he was mistaken\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still running your mouth.\u201d\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough, Deokgu oppa. Like I said, violence is prohibited here. Even if Seokwoo-ssi did something wrong, hastily swinging your fists at someone without hearing them out first creates disharmony amongst group members. This way of doing things\u2026 is not right. Before anything else, you need to determine if anything wrong is even taking place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSeokwoo-ssi, did you really grasp Hayan-ssi\u2019s hand to then sexually harass her?\u201d\u201cN-n-n-no. A-absolutely not. I never meant to do such a thing.\u201d\u201cThen what Deokgu oppa saw\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding. O-of course, it\u2019s true that I expressed my feelings towards Hayan-ssi, but I mistakenly thought that Hayan-ssi had accepted them\u2026 I-I think that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026 R-really.\u201d\u201cPlease repeat exactly what you said.\u201d\u201cI told Hayan-ssi I wanted to get closer to her, and Hayan-ssi reciprocated\u2026 I guess I was just mistaken.\u201d\u201cHayan-ssi, please clarify. Is what Seokwoo-ssi just said true?\u201dSeveral gazes landed on her. Of course, this wasn\u2019t something she could suddenly get used to.It was because their gazes were far from being friendly.She quickly realised that there was no one on her side.As her arms and legs started to shake from tension, Lee Jihye\u2019s face, and her stare as though urging her to hurry up and speak, came into her view.For some reason, she had trouble opening her mouth.\u201cT-that\u2019s true. B-but after that, Seok-Seok-Seokwoo-ssi\u2026 F-forcibly pulled my arm, and\u2026 that if I want to have a pleasant time here\u2026 H-he spoke like that\u2026 I-I was a little surprised\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease speak properly, Hayan-ssi. I can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Take it step by step.\u201d\u201cS-so\u2026\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s true that Seokwoo-ssi said he wanted to get closer to Hayan-ssi and you agreed?\u201d\u201cSorry? Yes\u2026 B-but I didn\u2019t know what he meant\u2026 I-I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cI asked whether it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s true. B-but\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me, Hayan-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSo isn\u2019t it Hayan-ssi who acted misleadingly and allowed this situation to develop? Come to think of it, you\u2019ve been hanging out with Seokwoo-ssi ever since you came here. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 It was always\u2026 Seok-Seokwoo-ssi who approached first\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is what happens when your behaviour is problematic.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Well, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think it is acceptable to create this type of misunderstanding and then back down like that? The same goes for Deokgu oppa. I can\u2019t believe you hit a person without even considering the actual situation\u2026\u201dWhen she turned her head a little to look at Park Deokgu, she noticed a tinge of confusion on his face.He was likely thinking, \u2018Maybe I made a mistake.\u2019\u201cIs he telling the truth? Noonim?\u201d\u201cI-I did agree that we should get closer\u2026 B-but\u2026\u201dShe was so bewildered she didn\u2019t even know where to begin.She had no idea how to respond to this situation which had popped up out of nowhere, or how she could fix it.Her face flushed and her eyes filled with tears.\u201cDo you think crying will solve anything?\u201d\u201cI- I\u2019m sorry. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of whether you\u2019re sorry or not. To be honest, the mood in the shelter hasn\u2019t been good recently\u2026 Deokgu oppa\u2026 Of course, I appreciate you giving a helping hand to a woman in a situation like this, but don\u2019t act so rashly unless you know what\u2019s going on. I think you were a little\u2026 too reckless this time.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cEspecially when it\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s unclear who the victim and perpetrator are\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cAm I the one you should be apologising to?\u201d\u201cApologise directly to the victim, Seokwoo-ssi.\u201d\u201cS, S\u2026 Sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d***\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dI already knew the answer.It was a situation that I could read with ease.I was expecting something to happen sooner or later, but not like this.I had never imagined that they would launch an offensive filled with accusations at this scale.Park Deokgu wore an embarrassed expression and seemed to be on the verge of tears. Meanwhile, Jung Hayan was shedding tears like a waterfall.Of course, there was no such thing as \u2018justice\u2019 here.At a glance, the assailant and victim were clear.Well, it was none of my business if Jung Hayan really tried to take advantage of Yoo Seokwoo, however the fact that Jung Hayan was in a tight spot was a matter of considerable importance.At my appearance, Lee Jihye was the first to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Kiyoung oppa. Presently\u2026!\u201d\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cJihye-ssi, are you out of your mind?\u201d\u201cW-what are you\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think this is some kind of local playground? Do you think no one will hear you when you\u2019re making such a large commotion? Just because we leave the shelter regularly to clear outside, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t take care of internal matters as well.\u201dShe seemed to have realised that she had made a mistake.\u201cAh\u2026 So the situation right now is\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw it from afar, so I roughly know what\u2019s going on, Jihye-ssi. Just as Jihye-ssi said, in a situation like this, where the assailant and the victim have yet to be clearly identified, even I would be scared if I were cornered by a group such as this. And yet, what situation do we have right now?\u201d\u201cBut that woman is clearly the one at fault\u2026\u201d\u201cJihye-ssi, can you say for sure that Seokwoo-ssi is wholly innocent?\u201dI was fairly certain that she couldn\u2019t.The moment those words left her lips, it would become her, not Yoo Seokwoo, who would bear the responsibility for them.And so, she had grown hesitant, displaying an anxious and flustered appearance.\u201cAnd based on Hayan-ssi\u2019s reaction, I don\u2019t think that is the case\u2026. But most of all, Hayan-ssi isn\u2019t that kind of person. I can guarantee that.\u201dMy \u2018guarantee\u2019 was over the top. Completely over the top.Right then, I was just talking nonsense.It was such an embarrassing remark, even I wanted to laugh at it.Jung Hayan, who probably felt that she wasn\u2019t worth the hassle, was likely extremely grateful for a statement in her defense.But others wouldn\u2019t feel the same.When on Earth would I have gotten to know her so well that I could even vouch for her?Aside from her Pure Advocate disposition, I had no other reason to vouch for her.As a matter of fact, there were many points worthy of mention.In the first place, it was wrong to question the victim from a standpoint that they had done something wrong when the crime involved sexual harassment.There was no way that Lee Jihye, a woman, wouldn\u2019t know that. Her insistence on siding with Yoo Seokwoo was likely done with the intention of furthering the exclusion of outsiders and consolidating her existing power.Or maybe the goal was to screw with Jung Hayan from the start.I wouldn\u2019t mind refuting her logic, but simply pushing my agenda forward in this case would work just as well.No, not \u2018just as well\u2019.Because\u2026\u2018I\u2019m in control.\u2019I was the one in power here.What I meant, was that my authority was heavier than anyone else\u2019s here.\u201cHayan-ssi doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2026\u201dThere was a great contrast between Jung Hayan, who stared at me whilst wiping her tears, and those who glared at Jung Hayan with hostility clear in their gazes.Perhaps in their minds this was a very unreasonable situation. Someone who appeared out of the blue and browbeat them into letting go of the situation, was also seemingly overly partial to one person.Of course, I wouldn\u2019t be the hated one.I looked toward Jung Hayan.A woman favoured by the powerful.She was bound to become an object of hatred; a person whom everyone else could not help but direct their dissatisfaction at.Especially for someone like Lee Jihye.\u201cEveryone\u2019s still just standing around\u2026 Yoo Seokwoo-ssi needs to get his injuries treated. However, after that, I will ask him to explain the exact situation again. For now, let\u2019s move Seokwoo-ssi first.\u201d\u201cY-yes sir.\u201d\u201cJihye-ssi, please clean up this place quickly, so that you can start your daily activities. It will soon be time for Hyunsung-ssi to return. Monsters might start rushing in at any moment, so Deokgu, please patrol the surrounding area.\u201d\u201cA-alright, Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026 Hayan-ssi, I\u2019d like to speak with you for a second.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSome people were whispering, Lee Jihye was biting her lips, and Yoo Seokwoo seemed to be rather fretful.I could clearly see what all of them were thinking.I could make out some of their words, but no one openly disapproved of my actions.\u201cWhat\u2026 that woman.\u201d\u201cBitch.\u201dThere was a much better \u2018prey\u2019 than me, after all.\u201cCome with me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes.\u201dRather than someone powerful, the kind that was easy pickings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As she wiped her tears away, shoulders shaking, she looked a little like a young child.In the first place, she was an ordinary 21-year-old girl.She had never experienced such a situation before, so it was no wonder she was like that.I couldn\u2019t fully comprehend exactly what it was that she was feeling, but it seemed like she hadn\u2019t really understood what had happened yet nor come to terms with the situation at hand.\u201cI\u2019m, hic\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you are apologising for.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m the one who, hic\u2026 who.\u201d\u201cHayan-ssi didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Of course, I didn\u2019t see what happened, but\u2026 For now, could you go through what happened?\u201d\u201cI, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. J-just\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. Please, just tell me what you can. Take your time.\u201dAs I smiled and spoke to her, she slowly began to speak.In fact, I already had a rough idea of how the story went, and it was rather predictable.The problem was that I couldn\u2019t understand her words at all.It was hard for me to figure out what she was saying through all the sobbing and tearsThanks to the system, I knew her level of intelligence wasn\u2019t low, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t based on simple thinking capability.\u201cS-so Seokwoo-ssi suddenly\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cH-he grabbed my hand and I screamed.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dBut it didn\u2019t matter whether I could understand her or not.It was more important to empathise with her.It was more important to listen to her reasons, why she was crying and why she was upset, than to judge who was at fault.\u2018I\u2019m on your side.\u2019I didn\u2019t say it out loud, but she probably thought that way.\u201cTh-that\u2019s what happened\u2026 A-and all of a sudden, Deokgu-ssi came, and\u2026 he hit him, and then Jihye-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cA-and at that moment, Kiyoung-ssi came\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe issue was that this lamentation of hers was taking quite a long time.Finally, after a few more minutes, her tedious story came to an end.\u201cIt must have been difficult.\u201d\u201cN-no. I-I\u2019m a little better now.\u201dIt definitely seemed like she was a little calmer now.Her shoulders which had trembled occasionally were set back in their original place, and her tearful expression was replaced with a slight smile.She had regained some composure.\u201cThank you, Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. It\u2019s just the circumstances\u2026\u201d\u201cN-no. I mean, you said you believed in me before\u2026\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d\u201cY-you\u2019ve been helping me ever since we first met\u2026 I-I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything for you\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cM-may I ask why you\u2019re so nice to me?\u201dIt was difficult to decipher the origin of this question.I wasn\u2019t sure if she was simply interested in me or wary of me.I thought it was probably the latter.Most likely, Yoo Seokwoo approached her in a similar manner.Let\u2019s give her a reasonable answer.\u201cI just did what I thought was right, but if I had to give a reason\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI have a younger sister at home. Perhaps it\u2019s that Hayan-ssi reminds me of her.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t really think this.Yulha\u2019s personality was completely different from that of Jung Hayan before me, and it was hard to find any resemblance other than age.But I thought that it would be the appropriate response.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s probably around the same age as Hayan-ssi.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\u201cHayan-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I have two older sisters, but\u2026 I lost contact with them a long time ago\u2026\u201dA dark expression surfaced. I thought it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if I pried a little more.\u201cYour parents\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-they are not around.\u201d\u201cWe have something in common.\u201d\u201cYou too, Kiyoung-ssi?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe looked oddly delighted.\u201cW-we are a little alike.\u201d\u201cYes. It seems so.\u201dIt was good for us to have something in common.The corners of my mouth went up when I saw her quietly clasping her hands.I considered whether it would be better to be more active or step back from here, but unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t sure of the correct answer.After thinking it over for a short while, I continued from my earlier train of thought.\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like you to be a little more comfortable with me. It\u2019s purely my selfishness but\u2026\u201d\u201cAh? Ah? Yes! H-ow?\u201d\u201cWe can start by speaking more informally.\u201d\u201cYes? Alright\u2026 Th-then informally\u2026\u201d\u201cJust speak casually.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I mean, umm. A-alright, O-O-Oppa.\u201dShe seemed to be shy.I was able to confirm once more that Jung Hayan wasn\u2019t skilled in socialising with others.As I quietly faced her and observed her with my Mind\u2019s Eye, her overall stats came into my view.[Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Jung Hayan.][Name: Jung Hayan][Title: None. You should try a little harder.][Age: 21][Disposition: Pure Advocate][Class: None][Stats][Endurance: 11/Growth potential: rare or lower][Agility: 11/Growth potential: rare or lower][Vitality: 14/Growth potential: heroic or lower][Intelligence: 22/Growth potential: heroic or higher][Endurance: 14/Growth potential: rare or lower][Luck: 23/Growth potential: heroic or higher][Mana: 10/Growth potential: legendary or higher][Overview: This person has the potential to improve their magical abilities beyond legendary grade. While their overall physical ability is low, they can experience explosive growth as a [Wizard] or [Priest] in the future. They are currently unaware that they can sense mana. Even if the both of you become Wizards, it\u2019s inevitable for them to become a Wizard on a totally different scale from player Lee Kiyoung, so don\u2019t lose sleep over it.]Her strength and vitality had increased by 1 and 2 compared to what I\u2019d seen before. It seemed she\u2019d been hard at work fortifying the walls.It was also interesting that her mana value was at 10 points.Unlike me, who only gained mana after becoming a Wizard, she had had it from the moment she was summoned here.She couldn\u2019t feel it yet, but it was possible that I could do something to help with that.It happened while I was thinking about discussing mana and magic.\u201cE-excuse me, Kiyoung oppa\u2026 C-could I speak with you for a minute?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Jung Hayan\u2019s voice.The owner of this voice coming from behind me was Lee Jihye.The expression on Jung Hayan\u2019s face shifted to anxiety.In fact, I had predicted that Lee Jihye would approach me.It was just a little faster than I anticipated.\u2018Certainly\u2026\u2019This woman had a good head on her shoulders.\u2018Are you going to switch to my side?\u2019The side which was more advantageous had already been determined by the events which had taken place earlier.On the surface, it may have appeared to simply be a case of judging who was wrong between Yoo Seokwoo and Jung Hayan. However, it had also been a power struggle between Lee Jihye and I.It was likely that Lee Jihye knew that too.No one had sorted us into a hierarchy, but she had realised nonetheless that I stood above her.Disposition: \u2018Selfish Ambitionist\u2019.There were two patterns of behaviour that emerged when someone like this woman or like myself encountered a new power.To reject it.Or to join it.She\u2019d acted faster than I had expected.She wasn\u2019t losing out by siding with us, but that shouldn\u2019t have been a decision made lightly.I opened my mouth and spoke quietly, looking not to Lee Jihye but to Jung Hayan.\u201cCould you excuse me for a moment? I think Jihye-ssi and I need to talk.\u201d\u201cAh. Okay. I understand. O-Oppa.\u201dIt seemed she was a bit nervous as she placed a small amount of emphasis on her last word.Eventually, Jung Hayan stood up and Lee Jihye took her place. I caught her looking back at us again and again; apparently, she had enjoyed our conversation.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 I just wanted to apologise. That, I\u2019m sorry for the commotion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. In reality, Jihye-ssi did nothing wrong.\u201d\u201cNo, Kiyoung oppa. It was my first time dealing with a situation like that, so I was a bit too impulsive and didn\u2019t consider the situation outside. I didn\u2019t think about you and the others struggling beyond these walls. It would have been better to resolve this manner quietly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I would also have been flustered if I were in Jihye-ssi\u2019s shoes. On the contrary, I think I should be the one apologising for being too sensitive.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Oppa just did what he had to do.\u201dAlthough she was fairly young, I wasn\u2019t used to being called oppa by a woman older than me.\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cRegarding Seokwoo-ssi.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans for what to do about Seokwoo-ssi at the moment. Anyhow, his treatment comes first\u2026 There are other things that I need to get done in the meantime.\u201d\u201cAh. Well, that\u2019s a relief. I\u2019m sorry to have troubled you with this. I was so flustered earlier that I couldn\u2019t make a proper judgement. I\u2019d like to be the one to resolve this, if you\u2019d let me. Could you leave this to me?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but worry.I hadn\u2019t yet figured out how to deal with Yoo Seokwoo.There were neither laws nor police here, so I wasn\u2019t sure whether to punish him, or even how.\u201cHayan-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cNow that I think back, I believe I was also overly critical of Hayan-ssi. If you let me handle this\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead. It was my understanding that Jihye-ssi was the one managing this place to begin with\u2026 I apologise for stepping in presumptuously.\u201d\u201cAh! No. That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know what you\u2019re trying to say. I hope you don\u2019t mind what happened earlier.\u201dThe point was that I also recognised some of her authority.This woman must have understood the implications of my words.\u2018I have no intention of stopping you.\u2019So, don\u2019t do anything to get on my nerves.Just lie low and stay out of my way.When I had finished speaking, I could see that her hand was furtively reaching forward.Objectively speaking, Lee Jihye was a beauty. I tried to keep my heartbeat steady, but it was difficult to keep still when someone was so close to my body.Rather, I was more curious about why she had approached me in this manner.\u201cI\u2019m sure that it\u2019s hard enough for you to leave the shelter\u2026 Thank you so much for taking care of us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help you, I\u2019d like you to let me know please. Anything.\u201dSaying that, she stroked my thigh.At this point, of course, I could tell what this woman wanted.\u201cAnything?\u201d\u201cYes. Whatever that may be.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but be embarrassed seeing her coming on to me so much more aggressively than I had expected.This woman might be foolish, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. I don\u2019t think that anyone could mistake her for a moron.Her eyes showed a strange look of desire.\u2018A hunger for power? Ambition?\u2019It didn\u2019t matter either way.\u201cI like ambitious men.\u201dTo me, having power or ambition was a way of protecting myself. Of course, my motives didn\u2019t matter to Lee Jihye.All she cared about was the result.The question was, would getting closer to this woman benefit me?The only thing she had going for her was that she could control the gaggle of idiots.There may be other uses for her, but that was it for now.She must have approached me because she was well aware of that fact.The group may not be much use in the first place, but there was no harm in having it.Actually, there might be something useful to gain from her side after all. Perhaps the connection with Jung Hayan\u2026.\u2018What should I do\u2026.\u2019I was pretty sure that she hadn\u2019t actually fallen for me.If I couldn\u2019t realise that much, then I would still be thinking that she was just a thoughtless, dumb bitch.\u2018That\u2019s not it.\u2019Was she aiming for a contract? A simple relationship?There was quite a lot that Lee Jihye stood to gain.Reconsolidation of her power after it may have been shaken, as well as forming a bond with someone whose authority might be second only to the strongest within the group.It could also be useful to make the public believe that we weren\u2019t on bad terms.There was nothing wrong with getting closer to each other.Breaking people down into enemies or allies was a stupid way of thinking.\u201cWhat do I get out of this?\u201d\u201cHmmm. How about Hayan-ssi?\u201dThe corners of my mouth raised and I pressed close to her.I could see that Lee Jihye\u2019s face held a strange mixture of excitement and anticipation.\u2018Good.\u2019It was a sensation I hadn\u2019t felt in a while.Our lips brushed against each other. It might have looked romantic at first glance.But our thoughts were different.\u2018Let\u2019s use each other.\u2019I smiled slightly as I said, \u201cWe seem to be a little similar.\u201d\u201cYes. I think so too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019ve finally met with misfortune. The perfect couple, forged from low stats and terrible potential, has been born. Make sure to use contraception. If the two of you really conceive a child together, I would feel sorry for the 2nd generation born from your union.]\u201cWhat couple.\u201dThis woman was a little smarter than I\u2019d previously thought. No, to be more exact, it wasn\u2019t that she was exceptionally brilliant.However, her ability to read the situation, decisiveness, and willingness to act were worth taking a look at.I understood why Kim Hyunsung had entrusted the group to this woman.She was quick-witted and knew how to respond appropriately.The fact that she had thrown Jung Hayan, who she had been keeping in check over the past few days, over to me gave me a rough idea of what she wanted.She likely wanted to hold onto the main body while cutting off any loose ends.Of course, she may have other reasons, but I didn\u2019t need to know about those.I swallowed and examined Lee Jihye\u2019s stats once more.Her rate of growth wasn\u2019t bad. Compared to the last time I\u2019d seen her, her vitality had risen by 1 point, her intelligence by 2, and her luck by a total of 3 points.\u2018How did she do it?\u2019The question was how she had increased her stats.In the case of intelligence, it was possible to infer that this stat wasn\u2019t based simply on one\u2019s critical thinking ability or existing knowledge.For instance, Jung Hayan, despite having high intelligence, was lacking in some aspects.On the other hand, Lee Jihye was the opposite. She was shrewd even though her intelligence stat was lower than Jung Hayan\u2019s.Perhaps one\u2019s magical aptitude or ability to understand the relevant knowledge was the basis of the intelligence stat.Her luck increase was strange as well. When I had last checked, her luck stat was 12.I didn\u2019t understand how her luck would have increased overnight.I had a hunch that it was connected to my high level of luck, but that was just a guess.I had to do a little more thinking about the way stats worked.\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d\u201cBecause I have a lot to think about.\u201dLee Jihye stood next to me, making no effort to hide the fact that she was staring.She had seemed fine yesterday, but her expression seemed a little clearer than before.\u201cDeal with Yoo Seokwoo and keep an eye on Jung Hayan. If anything out of the ordinary happens to her, inform me right away.\u201d\u201cShould you be saying that to the woman you\u2019ve kissed\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense\u2026\u201d\u201cWell. I\u2019ll take care of it. I think I know what you\u2019re planning, but what\u2019s special about this woman?\u201d\u2018She\u2019s a calculating bitch.\u2019\u201cNoona doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dI could see her face flush red when I called her noona.Her age was probably a sensitive topic.Lee Jihye bit her lips slightly.We hadn\u2019t turned into a loving couple nor teammates who would guard each other\u2019s backs overnight.To a certain extent, this was a contractual relationship.There had been no itemised list of terms, but we had both tacitly agreed to make use of each other and went through the process of forming that arrangement.It was a contract that could easily fall through at any given moment, but for the time being, it would let us believe in each other at the very least.The question was how long this relationship would last.There was no problem if we respected each other and kept each other in line, but no one could say what the future held.I sighed lightly and began to speak.\u201cBy the way, why did Jihye-ssi choose me?\u201d\u201cI told you, Kiyoung oppa. I like ambitious men.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t the only one who had to live up to expectations.Just as I could discard her at any moment, she could easily do the same.What mattered for now was my own growth and Jung Hayan.Lee Jihye wouldn\u2019t brag about our \u2018relationship\u2019 randomly.Because it was in her favour too.But she might hint at it if she was in the mood while working.It was important to know how it would affect Jung Hayan.Being socially inept meant that she inevitably struggled with expressing and being receptive to emotions.She didn\u2019t have any parents, and lost contact with her sisters a long time ago.In other words, Jung Hayan was not only unfamiliar with forming relationships with others, but was likely starved for affection.I had to increase her attachment to me and in the process, her dependency.Lee Jihye would help me with that.* * *Things were handled faster than expected. There had been no trial or anything of that sort for Yoo Seokwoo.I wasn\u2019t sure if he knew that Lee Jihye had sided with me, but Yoo Seokwoo quickly admitted that he was at fault, and was given a suitable punishment that everyone agreed upon.Of course, to some extent, Lee Jihye\u2019s influence played a role in this outcome. What was amusing was that she stuck to an attitude of \u2018I was powerless in this matter\u2019.In addition to directing their anger towards me, she stealthily began to manipulate public opinion into believing that some of the blame rested on Jung Hayan\u2019s shoulders.\u2018I was unable to help because of Lee Kiyoung.\u2019\u2018He values Jung Hayan.\u2019Those were the unspoken words that could be inferred from her behaviour.Due to this, Jung Hayan was forced to bear the hatred of everyone else. While watching Lee Jihye\u2019s process of manipulation, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that Lee Jihye was more awful than I\u2019d thought.\u2018This is a woman who\u2019s good at bullying.\u2019If I could describe this in terms of a stats, then it would be beyond legendary.I didn\u2019t lift a finger to stop her.Ultimately, this process succeeded in providing the optimal environment for Jung Hayan to be thoroughly isolated and harassed by those around her.In this situation where everyone hated Jung Hayan, there was nothing she could do to redeem herself.Eventually, there was only one place she could turn.Thanks to this, I had been listening to Jung Hayan\u2019s weeping for days.\u201cS-so\u2026 hic\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m fine\u2026 Thank you. O-o-oppa. I\u2019m too much of a\u2026 I know you\u2019re busy\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, not at all. Thank you for telling me this. If you work a little harder, the others will likely recognise your efforts. Of course, I already know that Hayanie is doing her best.\u201dTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t easy to pretend to be a good person.\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright. We\u2019re going to go hunting together from now on. I\u2019ve already discussed it with Hyunsung-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s just someone like me\u2026 Will that be okay?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI smiled slightly and patted her on the head.What I\u2019d accomplished so far could be called an achievement.It seemed that the time I\u2019d spent wasn\u2019t meaningless, if she was this scared by the thought of interacting with others.I had the urge to take a picture to commemorate this before we left.But I already knew that I couldn\u2019t hurry this process\u2026\u2018Slowly.\u2019I didn\u2019t want a relationship that could crumble as easily as a sand castle.The ties binding us together needed to be stronger.\u201cO-oppa, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I-if I were alone\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t know how relieved I am to have Hayanie next to me. How is your mana circulation going? Have you made any progress?\u201d\u201cYes. It seems to be working for now. I think I can feel it inside me. If I send it through my arms, I might be able to strengthen\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat about casting magic spells?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m still not sure.\u201dIn fact, chatting with Jung Hayan wasn\u2019t just for the sole purpose of improving our relationship.Much like Park Deokgu, who was struggling to get used to his new class and familiarising himself with shields, I needed time to acquaint myself with the [Wizard] class.The frequent excursions Kim Hyunsung had been taking on his own recently may have been made with the intention of giving us that time.\u2018Visualise.\u2019Magic was the result of visualising what one wanted to do with mana.The process of spell-casting was an essential aid to visualisation.I also had a hard time implementing magic for the first time. The basic knowledge was in my head, but I found it difficult to achieve the result I wanted.I needed to build a tower with my mana. A solid tower without any cracks or air inside.At the same time, I thought of the action that I wanted to realise in my head.I pictured flames rising from my fingers.\u201cHear my voice. Respond. Flame.\u201dAt the same time, a small flame rose from my finger.Jung Hayan watched it with a slightly surprised look on her face.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s important to clearly define what you want to achieve in your mind. It\u2019s more convenient if the spell is simple but I don\u2019t think it matters if it\u2019s a little long\u2026 The point is that it coincides with your thoughts.\u201dThe disadvantage was that most spells that were easy to visualise were useless.Thinking about those spells that could only be dubbed chuuni-like[1], I felt my face heating up.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIn my case, rather than manifesting magic itself, I\u2019m thinking of harnessing mana to enhance myself\u2026 You\u2019ll probably find your own preferred method as well. I mean, it may seem difficult now, but it\u2019ll be a bit easier if you get a class.\u201d\u201cAs expected\u2026 I understand.\u201dIt might not be possible to use magic unless you have a class.Given that Kim Hyunsung, who had quite a lot of mana, was unable to use magic, it seemed that you couldn\u2019t overcome the limits of your class.The reason for giving Jung Hayan all of this knowledge, despite that fact, was obvious.\u2018I favour her.\u2019There was no easier way to get close to someone than by teaching or learning from them.Even if I told her in advance what she would later learn, I wouldn\u2019t lose out.\u201cYou might not be able to use magic until you get a class. Still, let\u2019s practice building up your mana step by step.\u201d\u201cYes. L-leave it to me. O-oppa, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dI nodded naturally.[Mana has increased by 1.][Intelligence has increased by 1.]\u2018Good.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the more you use it, the more mana you\u2019ll have in the future. Personally, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cYe-yes.\u201d\u201cThen, shall we stop here for today?\u201d\u201cA-a-actually, there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cYeah. I-I mean recently, I\u2019ve had another surge in my mana\u2026\u201dAs I listened to her explain, I checked out Jung Hayan\u2019s stat window.I was curious about the progress she\u2019d made so far.[Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Jung Hayan.][Name: Jung Hayan][Title: None.

Mana has permanently increased by 2 points. The potential for growth has increased explosively.]\u2018What the hell is this\u2026\u2019Even her attributes were over the top. As soon as she understood the underlying principles of the class, she received an attribute associated with it that was heroic grade.It felt like a slap in the face.This was the first time I\u2019d ever seen someone, who, just by comprehending the basics of magic, gained not only a class but also a new attribute.If it was possible for others, Kim Hyunsung would have chosen this method.Jung Hayan had to be a unique case.As I fell into thought for a while longer, Jung Hayan began to look at me showing traces of anxiety.\u201cUm\u2026 O-oppa?\u201d\u201cAh, sorry. I was just thinking\u2026 You asked me about mana circulation, right?\u201d\u201cY-yes! I tried what oppa said, but it\u2019s still really hard\u2026\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be difficult.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the amount of mana you\u2019re using is a little bit too much\u2026 That\u2019s weird.\u201dI could see her hand reaching forward.I grabbed Jung Hayan\u2019s slightly outstretched hand and began to pour in my feeble mana resources.I tried to push through and gather up her mana, but Jung Hayan\u2019s mana did not even budge.It wasn\u2019t simply because my mana was lacking.\u2018She\u2019s blocking me.\u2019My attempt to help her circulate her mana was intentionally suppressed.It was only when I began to frown that I felt Jung Hayan\u2019s mana moving in the direction I wanted.\u201cA-as expected, you\u2019re amazing, Oppa.\u201d\u2018Seriously\u2026\u2019\u201cTry to imagine it.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cImagine the spell. Something like a flame rising from your hand\u2026 You can do what I did before, right?\u201d\u201cAh! Y-yes!\u201dThe amount of mana required to fulfil the conditions for using this spell was perfectly accumulated.It should have been easy for her to imagine a small flame after getting to this point.But then her mana instantly fell apart. It wasn\u2019t because she had taken too long or simply failed. Jung Hayan, herself, deliberately broke it down.\u201cI-it\u2019s still too difficult. W-why am I like this\u2026? Oppa is trying so hard to teach me\u2026\u201dEven her tearful act was a sight to behold.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201cNo, it could be because you are still classless, so it\u2019s normal to fail. If we go out hunting, you\u2019ll improve. Okay?\u201dShe didn\u2019t react to the word \u2018classless\u2019 that I had snuck in.\u201cC-can we try it again?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s already pretty late. Let\u2019s call it a day. I have work to do for the time being.\u201d\u201cD-do you have plans or\u2026 A-are you seeing Hyae-Hyaeyoung-ssi\u2026 t-today as well?\u201dPark Hyaeyoung was a woman that Lee Jihye had attached to me.After what happened that day, Lee Jihye sent me a person who could act as a link between us.I\u2019d been told that she would be useful for me in many ways, but that was something I had yet to witness.Until now, all I had heard from Park Hyaeyoung were stories about the group\u2019s situation and internal affairs.As I was debating on how to respond, I heard another voice.\u201cKiyoung-ssi? Do you have a minute?\u201d\u201cAh. Just give me a moment, please.\u201d\u2018Park Hyaeyoung.\u2019I couldn\u2019t tell whether her timing was good or bad.However, I saw that Jung Hayan didn\u2019t show much of a reaction.\u201cAh! Y-you already had something planned. I-I wasn\u2019t aware\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t make any arrangements to meet with Hyaeyoung-ssi. Something must have happened. Would you excuse us, please?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes.\u201dJung Hayan slowly withdrew from her seat and then Park Hyaeyoung came in.I didn\u2019t remember calling for her, so I wondered why she had sought me out.I could feel Jung Hayan staring at Park Hyaeyoung. I did want to take advantage of her jealousy, but not in this manner.\u201cHayan-ah, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAh! Yes!\u201dAs soon as Jung Hayan disappeared from view, Park Hyaeyoung sat down quietly.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard something interesting.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cLike the fact that the next time you go hunting, you\u2019ll take a few of the people here to accompany you.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, could I be one of them?\u201dShe was quite direct.Naturally, I\u2019d already scanned Park Hyaeyoung with my Mind\u2019s Eye, but there was nothing particularly outstanding when it came to her abilities.[Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Park Hyaeyoung.][Name: Park Hyaeyoung][Title: None. You should try a little harder.][Age: 27][Disposition: Calculating Diplomat][Class: None][Stats][Strength: 10/Growth potential: heroic or lower][Agility: 11/Growth potential: rare or higher][Vitality: 20/Growth potential: rare or higher][Intelligence: 10/Growth potential: rare or higher][Endurance: 10/Growth potential: common or lower][Luck: 09/Growth potential: common or lower][Mana: 00/Growth potential: rare or lower][Overview: This isn\u2019t the time to be disappointed about the lack of people with prominent stats or unique characteristics. Overall, this person is well-balanced. It seems likely that they could grow well as a melee fighter or as a long-ranged class, such as [Archer].]Her disposition was \u2018Calculating Diplomat\u2019.Even without reading into her status too deeply, I could roughly guess what kind of person she was.I observed her for a while and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I recommended Hayan-ssi at first, but\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you the type that prefers younger women? I could be even better. Isn\u2019t it boring to play with such a little kid?\u201d\u201cRegardless of your thoughts on the matter, that is not the case.\u201d\u201cHow about you just give me a chance? I think our relationship would be so much more beneficial\u2026\u201dI had no clue what relationship she was talking about.By the looks of it, it seemed she\u2019d overheard our chat earlier.Park Hyaeyoung seemed to believe that I was very interested in women.Certainly, her abilities were pretty good, and her growth potential didn\u2019t seem too bad either.If she was able to develop and grow stronger, she would possibly be of use, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of her \u2018Calculating\u2019 disposition.However, she should at least understand that all arrangements need to be reciprocal.\u201cFor what reason?\u201d\u201cAfter all, you need someone who can fight, right? Thanks to Deokgu-ssi and Kiyoung-ssi, the situation here has changed somewhat since you arrived. There are only a small number of us still waiting on Hyunsung-ssi to help us. This place is one where women can be as strong as men, and we can use the system to enhance our physical abilities.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cEveryone is afraid of the monsters, but more and more people are beginning to think that they can do something about them. They\u2019ve been banding together to go out as well. From Kiyoung-ssi\u2019s perspective, it can\u2019t be a bad thing to have more people who\u2019re able to fight for themselves on your side. If Hayan-ssi is able to return stronger with special abilities, then the state of affairs will surely accelerate.\u201d\u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m dividing everyone into different factions.\u201d\u201cDid I hit the nail on the head?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t really care about things like that. Is Jihye-ssi aware that you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cShe probably does? Who knows what Jihye-ssi is thinking?\u201d\u201cAnd the reason you\u2019re here to speak with me is\u2026.\u201d\u201cI just thought it would be nice for us to talk. I dislike the fact that you only favour that Jung Hayan girl, and if you refuse to take me on then I\u2019ll have no choice but to wait until my turn\u2026.\u201d\u201cI see where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019ve said so far has been reasonable as well.\u201d\u201cI believe that we might be able to work something out once Hyunsung-ssi has returned. I\u2019ll try to speak with him about it. However, if Hyunsung-ssi decides that it\u2019s infeasible then this proposal may be rejected, so please don\u2019t set your hopes too high.\u201d\u201cJust hearing you say that is more than I could hope for.\u201d\u201cI look forward to cooperating with you, then.\u201d\u201cLikewise.\u201d* * *\u201cThat\u2019s hilarious. Seriously.\u201d\u201cShh. Listen. Hey.\u201dThere were voices all around her, but she couldn\u2019t make out their exact words.Instead, she was more concerned about Kiyoung oppa.\u201cHayan-ssi! What are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cAh, ah! I mean. It\u2019s nothing\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can take a break if you\u2019re tired. You must have a hard time using your body that way\u2026 Phew. Won\u2019t working here be too difficult for you?\u201d\u201cS-sorry?\u201d\u201cLook at you pretending you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dShe might have been unsure of the meaning behind their words, but she could sense their hostility.It wasn\u2019t overt or very strong. However, this was something that she was extremely familiar with.In retrospect, it had been like that ever since she was young. Compared to her two sisters, she had been much more foolish, slow and incompetent.Her eldest sister had always taken care of her and her second sister had been incredibly intelligent. After so many years of watching out for her, the reason they\u2019d cut off contact with her was probably because she was so dumb.\u201cUgh\u2026 Something reeks.\u201d\u201cHe has a pretty unique taste. She\u2019s not that pretty\u2026 Pretends she doesn\u2019t have a clue\u2026 In the end, she\u2019s just a fox.\u201d\u201cShh. Stop it. Hey, he\u2019ll hear you. What are you going to do if he runs over here?\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s see if he does. He\u2019s probably already tired of her. No, doesn\u2019t it make sense that he\u2019d be tired of her?\u201dHer hands shook subconsciously at those words.\u2018Kiyoung oppa.\u2019He was the only person she could rely on in this entire place.Remembering the way they\u2019d held hands earlier, her body began to tremble.Tired of her?Oppa wouldn\u2019t treat her like that.He was different.\u2018My heart is pounding.\u2019Her heart was racing as though it were about to explode.\u2018You remind me of my little sister.\u201dThe thought of what she\u2019d heard brought her a subtle sense of pleasure.It was an unfamiliar sensation. She\u2019d never felt like this in her life.Her heart was pounding badum badum in her chest and her legs felt jittery.It was hard for her to get a hold of her emotions.\u2018We can meet again tomorrow.\u2019They could meet again tomorrow.Just the two of them once more; they could talk, and she could act cute towards him.It felt like she was experiencing the same warmth she\u2019d received from her family once upon a time.It was addicting, like a drug.The reason why she\u2019d kept her class and ability hidden was because she wanted to spend more time with Kiyoung oppa.Her heart twisted at the lie, but she was scared of the consequences if he found out.As she looked subconsciously in the direction of Kiyoung oppa and ignored the voices of those around her,\u201cOh my. Were you waiting?\u201dPark Hyaeyoung, who had been with her oppa just a moment before, appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a face like that, your skills must be better than I thought\u2026 I don\u2019t get it. No, maybe he\u2019s the one whose taste is peculiar\u2026 You know, there are people like that. People who are only interested in the incompetent and dim-witted kind. Phew.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t fully understand Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s words.\u201cYou are making that face again. I really don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cI-I-I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you sorry for? You\u2019re making a fool of everyone here regardless\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s not it. I just\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you really think that Kiyoung-ssi likes you? You think he cares about you?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, you dumb bitch. It\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019re so fortunate. You just happened to be at the right place at the right time to catch his eye. You might not be able to see it, but I know exactly what kind of person he is. People like Kiyoung-ssi don\u2019t trust others too much to begin with. They tire of others easily, and throw them away when they\u2019re no longer needed.\u201d\u201cO-oppa isn\u2019t like that. And\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just what you want to believe. Because it\u2019s in your favour. But what can I do if you\u2019ve already made up your mind? I think I\u2019m right\u2026 It might be okay for now, but things will change soon enough. From my point of view, you\u2019re rather boring, the kind one easily gets sick of. Phew. No one\u2019s ever told you that before?\u201dJung Hayan bit down hard on her lips.She felt so confused.Her face felt hot. She wanted to shout \u2018What are you talking about\u2019 and argue against Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s nonsensical speech but words escaped her.However, her body kept shaking.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you make a face like that before? Are you mad? I must have hit the nail on the head. You\u2019ve always been abandoned by the people around you, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cN-n-n-n-no.\u201d\u201cNo? It\u2019s written all over your face. If not, do you always have things snatched away from you? Either way, you\u2019re just pathetic. Do you really believe you\u2019re always going to be his first priority? What do you think will happen out there when you\u2019re not paying attention?\u201dPark Hyaeyoung\u2019s face slowly drew nearer. Before long, Jung Hayan heard a faint whisper near her ear that caused her to exclaim subconsciously.\u201cKiyoung-ssi\u2026 was better than I thought.\u201d\u201cD-don\u2019t lie to me!\u201d\u201cOh, you fell for it.\u201dJung Hayan\u2019s eyes were filled with tears.She wanted to say something to refute Park Hyaeyoung, but she felt choked up.This woman was right.She had been abandoned by her parents and her older sisters.All of her loved ones and the friends that had been with her for so long had drawn away from her.Maybe she really was the type of person that others got sick of.She always made mistakes and had trouble speaking properly.Being bullied had become a part of her daily routine, so it was more convenient for her to just be alone.Still.\u2018Not Oppa.\u2019Her Oppa wasn\u2019t like that.He wasn\u2019t the least bit similar to the others. His very nature was different from everyone else she\u2019d met before.He said that she was like a family member to him. That she reminded him of his younger sister, and he wanted to look after her.He was always mindful of her and was taking care of her every day. Deokgu-ssi also told her that.Every day, her Oppa would tell her that he cared about her.He was always supporting her, saying that she could do better, even if she made a mistake.Even when she asked silly questions, he would smile and answer her patiently.\u201cTh-that can\u2019t be true.\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s what you\u2019re hoping for? I\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s likely that what I\u2019m saying will happen. I\u2019m going to give you a warning, dongsaeng. If you want to gain anything out of your current relationship, you\u2019d better leech it out quickly before you\u2019re discarded. Otherwise, everything will be snatched away from your grasp.\u201d\u201cS-s-stop it. O-oppa wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cHow annoying.\u201dPark Hyaeyoung\u2019s mouth curved into a smile, and, at the same moment, Jung Hayan felt a pressure on her shoulders.She had been pushed down.Jung Hayan fell on her bottom. She looked up but all she could see was Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s back, who was already walking away.At the same time, voices poured in from all sides.\u201cServes her right.\u201d\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d\u201cAnyways, it looks like our naive whore will be abandoned soon.\u201d\u201cStop it. Hey, she will hear you.\u201d\u201cStop what? Didn\u2019t you hear what just happened? Soon, she\u2019s going to be all alone again. Who is she going to cling to then? Ah! I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone else who would compete for her anymore. It would have been better for her to just stay with Seokwoo-ssi\u2026 She should have known better. That\u2019s why she\u2019s all alone.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s she going to do now that she\u2019s on her own?\u201dThat couldn\u2019t be true.\u2018It can\u2019t be true.\u2019There was no way Oppa would ever forsake her.There was no way her Oppa, who had said he would always be with her, would ever abandon her like that.There was no way that Oppa, who told her she was like a family member to him, would abandon her.\u2018Well, is that really the case?\u2019But Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s voice resounded in her ears.\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d\u201cWhat was that? Just now.\u201d\u201cDid she just yell? She must be really angry\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about time for her true nature to show up. Tsk.\u201dThat couldn\u2019t be true. Oppa would never just abandon her.Oppa was different from the others. He was always warm and kind.\u2018Your sisters abandoned you, too.\u2019\u201cN-no.\u201d\u2018No, your parents also abandoned you.\u2019\u201cHe isn\u2019t like that. Oppa is different. Oppa is different.\u201dSurely, he was different.It was very difficult to calm down her heart. She felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe.She was short of breath and her mind went blank. Tears welled up in her eyes, but they didn\u2019t flow down her cheeks.She heard people laughing to themselves.The sound no longer bothered her. It would have to be something even worse to faze her.Her steps were headed towards where her Oppa had been.\u2018Wait a minute, okay? There\u2019s something I want to find out first, so I\u2019ll meet you after.\u2019She was sure that he would meet with her.Jung Hayan felt like she needed to see his face to calm down.As she was frantically hurrying over, she heard a distant voice.It was Lee Jihye.\u201cPlease gather for a moment, everyone.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen Hyunsung-ssi, Deokgu-ssi and Kiyoung-ssi leave tomorrow, they plan on recruiting someone to go with them. I believe Hyunsung-ssi will provide more details, and the person who is nominated today should also prepare themselves.\u201dNow that she thought of it, she\u2019d heard that they would be heading out together.Naturally, this meant that she could be with him a little longer.Jung Hayan wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d forgotten that. Now there was more time for her to stay by Kiyoung oppa\u2019s side.\u2018That\u2019s a relief.\u2019As she turned to look closer, she saw Kim Hyunsung, Park Deokgu, and Kiyoung oppa approaching together from behind Lee Jihye.\u2018Oppa.\u2019He had a serious expression that differed from his usual demeanour, but seeing him made her feel more steady.Her heart thumped badum badum, but she didn\u2019t have a headache nor feel dizzy.The lingering feelings of frustration vanished just from making eye contact with him.Though she didn\u2019t understand why, her face turned red.\u2018He saw me.\u2019He was definitely looking in her direction.Once the chatter had died down, Kim Hyunsung quietly began to speak.\u201cI apologise for bringing you here while you\u2019re all so busy. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re aware that it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to survive in this location. Food rations are decreasing day by day, and the number of survivors joining us continues to rise. We have food and drinking water scavenged from the starting point, but it\u2019s not enough. We believe we need to widen our range of activity.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe need more people who can fight. Of course, I know you\u2019re scared of the monsters. Some of you aren\u2019t used to fighting, and others may not want to leave this place. But for now, you have to take action. I don\u2019t want to jinx it, but if this doesn\u2019t happen, in the long run we\u2019ll all suffer. So, we\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s better to take each of you out one by one.\u201dAfter Kim Hyunsung spoke, Kiyoung oppa stepped forward.\u201cKiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand that you\u2019re afraid. However, there are some things that can only be gained by fighting. As you know, this is not like the Earth that we knew. I\u2019m sure you all recognise what the status window, system attributes, and class mean. Flame.\u201dFlames rose from the palm of his hand.The eyes of those around Jung Hayan widened.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how it happened, but my status window reports that my class is Wizard. I don\u2019t have much magic to work with yet, but I\u2019m no different from you. I was afraid of the monsters, so I ran away and hid because I didn\u2019t want to encounter them. At first, it was just by luck, but you can succeed if you set your fear aside and fight. When the group gets stronger, we all get stronger, and eventually we\u2019ll be able to leave this place. We need to take the initiative.\u201d\u201cOhhhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cFor now, we\u2019ll pick some people to lead by example. Hayan-ssi.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd Hyaeyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes. I look forward to working with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m taking these two with me for now. Once they reach a certain level, we\u2019ll regroup and take the next person. Do you have any questions?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you could explain what the criteria was.\u201d\u201cTo relieve your anxiety, the selection criteria is random.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go hunting by ourselves instead\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t prevent you from doing so, but I cannot recommend it.\u201dThe buzz of the crowd grew louder, but Jung Hayan could no longer make out their words.Instead, her eyes were locked on Park Hyaeyoung.She\u2019d known that other people would be going with her, but she hadn\u2019t expected it to be that woman.\u201cCongratulations, Unnie.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201cHyunsung-ssi, Kiyoung-ssi, and Deokgu-ssi will be with us, so it\u2019ll probably be okay. It\u2019s a little scary, but we need to push past this. It\u2019s better if we have more people who can fight.\u201dJung Hayan wasn\u2019t envious of the fact that Park Hyaeyoung was surrounded by people who were congratulating her. However, she felt odd for some reason.\u2018Don\u2019t take her.\u2019As she quickly glanced up at the platform once more, she saw that Oppa was also looking at Park Hyaeyoung.There was a faint smile on his lips.The voice she had heard earlier resounded in her ears, and her breathing became shaky.\u2018He\u2019s the type to tire of others easily.\u2019Park Hyaeyoung hurried onto the platform and began shaking hands with the others.\u2018You\u2019re going to be thrown away\u2019\u2018To have him taken away from you\u2019\u2018Your sisters left you too.\u2019\u2018Your parents as well.\u2019\u2018Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.\u2019\u2018You\u2019ll end up\u2026.\u2019\u2018Stop\u2026\u2019\u2018Thrown away\u2026.\u2019\u2018Hated.\u2019At that moment, Kiyoung oppa held Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s hands.Something collapsed inside Jung Hayan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Not bad.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a bad choice to show them magic.Kim Hyunsung and Park Deokgu were definitely strong. However, the line between whether that strength came from the system or from their own inherent physical abilities wasn\u2019t particularly clear.When pitching the possibility of gaining new powers right away, it was only natural that merely picking up a shield wouldn\u2019t appeal to them as much.Magic, on the other had, was a bit different.A ball of fire formed from nothing.It was a sight that completely went against common sense, enough to cause anyone to doubt what they had seen.That was the best way to get them to stop hiding in this shelter.When Kim Hyunsung saw the crowd quietly gaining enthusiasm, he murmured,\u201cIt was a success.\u201d\u201cThere might still be difficulties lying ahead. Those adverse to fighting will still be afraid\u2026 There will also be some people who overcompensate, thinking they\u2019ll be able to get new powers.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still better than them falling behind and starving, Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cYeah. That may be true.\u201dPark Hyaeyoung approached the podium, receiving words of congratulation every step of the way.\u201cIf Hyaeyoung-ssi and Hayan-ssi return successfully, perhaps the status quo will change at a faster rate than expected. \u201dThe result of this expedition was incredibly important to Kim Hyunsung.I wasn\u2019t sure whether our attempt to clear the dungeon would succeed, but Kim Hyunsung was correct in thinking that he alone wouldn\u2019t be enough.Firstly, he was only slightly superior to Park Deokgu in terms of ability.His mana was powerful, but not to the extent that he could deal with dozens of monsters at once.As much as he might want to take matters into his own hands, taking care of the shelter should be left as the responsibility of the people within it.\u2018It\u2019s an unnecessary burden.\u2019If it weren\u2019t for his predisposition, Kim Hyunsung might have advanced even further.While I was lost in thought, Park Hyaeyoung had come up to us and shook our hands one by one.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cSame here.\u201dI had to admit that she was quite good at socialising. Looking at her with a business-like smile, I could feel Park Hyaeyoung touching the back of my hand to send me a signal.Jung Hayan was still the priority over her.As I turned my head, I saw Jung Hayan staring at me quietly.\u2018What.\u2019Her expression was subtly different from anything I\u2019d seen so far.Jung Hayan\u2019s tranquil eyes as she watched Park Hyaeyoung sent a chill down my spine.\u2018Damn it.\u2019I had goosebumps all over my body.\u2018What. What was that just now?\u2019\u201cHyung-nim, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019ve broken out in a cold sweat\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little under the weather, so\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, tomorrow\u2019s the day of our expedition, so get some rest. It\u2019s not as though you need to study here every day.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cTsk. Who said they weren\u2019t a nerd\u2026 He\u2019s not eating enough nowadays? I-It\u2019s not like I\u2019m worried about hyung-nim\u2026 Well, my share isn\u2019t a lot but it\u2019s a little better than nothing\u2026.\u201dWhatever Park Deokgu was muttering didn\u2019t interest me much.I quickly turned my head to glance at Jung Hayan once more.She looked the same as usual.I asked myself if it had just been my eyes playing a trick on me, but I was sure that hadn\u2019t been the case. I could see her looking at me and smiling foolishly.\u2018What.\u2019Something was wrong.I couldn\u2019t pinpoint it exactly, but I swallowed with a sense of unease.* * *\u201cLet\u2019s go over this one more time. Deokgu-ssi will be in front, followed by Hyunsung-ssi and Hyaeyoung-ssi. Hayan-ssi and I will bring up the rear. Our plan of attack is simple. Block them with a shield in front, and we\u2019ll ward them off at the back. There aren\u2019t many of them around the shelter right now, so we\u2019ll go a little further out and hunt. Any questions?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cNone here.\u201d\u201cO-okay..\u201dWe had already run through the same briefing several times.It was different from when Park Deogku, Kim Hyunsung, and I had first gone out.This demonstrated the importance Kim Hyunsung placed on this expedition.It wasn\u2019t just about bringing along two new recruits.The success of this hunt would impact the future course of the group in the shelter.If everyone returned safe and sound, those in the shelter would gain a little more confidence, and as a result, more complex attack and incident response arrangements could be formed.The hidden objective of increasing the number of people on his side would be achieved as well.\u2018You want to even the odds.\u2019Kim Hyunsung\u2019s goal was quite similar to mine.To win over Jung Hayan.Of course, logically speaking, he wasn\u2019t actually after her specifically. His purpose was to build lasting relationships with those he knew would become strong in the future.\u2018Jung Hayan.\u2019In conclusion, there were two objectives: the group\u2019s safe return and becoming closer to a wizard with legendary talent.There was no reason to oppose the current plan or to act impulsively.\u2018We need to monitor the situation.\u2019The look I\u2019d seen in Jung Hayan\u2019s eyes put me on edge.I hoped it was just my misunderstanding, but I felt a need to keep them separated and a watchful eye on Jung Hayan.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to put Hayan noonim in the centre? Being in the same position as Hyung-nim is the most\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019ll keep it as is. This is the best placement for her.\u201d\u201cWell, if Hyung-nim says so, hey\u2026.\u201d\u201cHyunsung-ssi is stronger than we think. To begin with, solely hunting them from the front is ideal. If Hayanie is at the back, she\u2019ll have Hyunsung-ssi\u2019s protection as insurance. So long as we\u2019re not surrounded, this will be the most efficient way to proceed.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s correct.\u201dKim Hyunsung nodded as though he agreed with me.I didn\u2019t know if he felt otherwise, but I didn\u2019t care.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s brow furrowed as he looked at Jung Hayan, then spoke quietly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201d\u201cPardon? Ah\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cThen do I just need to chill with Kiyoung-ssi?\u201d\u201cHyaeyoung-ssi, please provide assistance to Kiyoung-ssi. A spear would be a good fit for you.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get going then. Like I told you before\u2026\u201d\u201cW-where\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201dI already had the layout of this place mapped out in my head.Park Deokgu gave me a look of gratitude.I didn\u2019t know if it was because he lacked interest in his surroundings or if he was too reliant on me, but it seemed like he was too lazy to use his head.He looked very reliable when he stood holding a large wooden shield.In terms of appearance, I would give more points to Park Deokgu over Kim Hyunsung.His equipment consisted solely of the sloppy leather armor I had put together and the shield I had picked up at the starting point, but he didn\u2019t look too shabby.\u201cLet\u2019s get started, then.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do our best.\u201dEveryone gave a slight nod.Both Park Hyaeyoung and Jung Hayan seemed to be a little nervous.It was only natural that they\u2019d be afraid of meeting the monsters they had encountered at the starting point in person.I passed some words of comfort to Park Hyaeyoung, who was right next to me.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t overwhelm us like they did at the starting point. We\u2019ve already cleared out this area to some degree, so all you need to do is remain calm and stab the monsters that Deokgu blocks with your spear and then it\u2019ll be over. I know it\u2019s scary but it\u2019s possible for us to make it through fine.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a lot nicer than I thought.\u201dOf course, I had to be.\u2018If you panic, I\u2019ll be the one who dies.\u2019Who knew what would happen in the midst of battle. It was possible that, while blindly attacking with her spear, this woman would stab me.Glancing behind me, I saw Kim Hyunsung speaking with Jung Hayan.As expected, he seemed to be asking about various things, but Jung Hayan didn\u2019t look to be interested in Kim Hyunsung at all.She looked to be having a hard time communicating, as she kept her head lowered and answered his questions with short responses.It reminded me of how hard I had worked to get closer to Jung Hayan.I smiled when our eyes met and Jung Hayan nodded with a happy expression.It made me feel better, at least, to think that I had the upper hand in my relationship with her.\u201cOh, are you going blind? I\u2019m not your partner.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just checking our rear formation for a moment. Also, don\u2019t talk too much while we\u2019re on the move\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes. I know.\u201dIt was then.\u201cThere\u2019s one. Get ready.\u201d\u201cHuh, understood.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s voice came from the rear and Park Deokgu murmured a reply from in front.Park Deokgu\u2019s body seemed tense.\u201cWhile Deokgu-ssi is keeping it at bay, Hyaeyoung-ssi will take care of it. Kiyoung-ssi, be prepared in case anything happens.\u201dWe nodded.Though Park Hyaeyoung looked calm, she still showed signs of fear and tension.We were present too, but Park Hyaeyoung was the one who would have to finish it off.It would\u2019ve been strange if she wasn\u2019t afraid.We could only hear one voice coming from the left.\u201cDeokgu-yah, it\u2019ll be coming from the left.\u201d\u201cI understand, Hyung-nim.\u201dPark Deokgu immediately rounded the corner and pushed it back with his shield.Gwajik!As this sound rang out, the creature was stuck between the dead-end corridor and the shield.Park Hyaeyoung followed behind, flustered.\u201cGaaaaaaeeeeeeek!\u201d\u201cShit\u2026 Its face is as irritating as ever.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHer arms trembled and her legs shook.I could tell from a glance what had happened.Even a dog that couldn\u2019t piss would be more useful in this situation.\u201cH-how.\u201d\u201cJab it.\u201d\u201cHey, take care of it quickly. It\u2019s hard to hold out like this.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThe calm look she had been sporting earlier was nowhere to be found.Her eyes were alive, but her body didn\u2019t seem to react.In this kind of situation, no matter who it was, even if they were aware that they weren\u2019t moving, they would still be unable to act on that fact.\u2018Idiot\u2026 You were only pretending to be strong.\u2019I loosely grasped her arm from behind. As I held Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s trembling hand gripping the spear, the tremors in her limbs began to slow.I figured it would be more effective to deliver my message quietly than to scream in this kind of situation, so I whispered in her ear.\u201cIf you do something like this again next time, we\u2019re all going to die. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cStrengthen your grip.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI pressed her hand tighter\u2026The spear slowly moved towards the torso of the punk Park Deokgu was blocking and Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s arm followed.I was the one pulling it forward, but the sensation should have transmitted to her hands as well.Puuuk!With that sound, unknown liquids began to gush out.Repulsed, Park Hyaeyoung tried to let go of the spear, but I grabbed her arm once again.\u201cIt\u2019s not dead yet. Don\u2019t relax.\u201d\u201cGaaaaaaaaeeeeeek!\u201dThat punk, out of pain or anger, was still struggling, and tried to scratch Park Deokgu as he kept it back.I gripped Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s hand again and jabbed the spear from above.As expected, it was a horrible sensation.\u201cThink of it as meat.\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dPuuk!Gwajik!I struck with the spear over and over again.It had long stopped twitching but this method was effective enough in forcing her to adapt to the situation.After a while, Park Deokgu set down his shield and moved away from the monster.I also loosened my grip on Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s hand.The monster had fallen apart. Even so, she continued to stab the spear into it.It was unknown whether it was to free herself from fear, but her lips were pressed tight and her knuckles were white around the shaft of the spear.\u2018I understand.\u2019The very act of taking away life was a foreign concept to begin with.No matter how much you told yourself that your opponent was a monster, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference.It was only after a long stretch of gruesome noises that there was an exhausted gasp.It was natural that she would have all sorts of thoughts running through her mind.I approached Park Hyaeyoung, who had collapsed to the ground, and spoke carefully.\u201cWell done.\u201dShe didn\u2019t reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If not, it\u2019s possible that they were driven away.\u201d\u201cYou mean there might be another group of survivors?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d That Park Deokgu fellow mumbled as if anxious.It was just a guess, but it wasn\u2019t without cause.Given how quiet our surroundings were, it wasn\u2019t wrong to assume that they had been attracted by a commotion elsewhere and flocked there instead.Kim Hyunsung seemed to have similar thoughts, but of course, he probably felt that it would be unreasonable to take Park Hyaeyoung and Jung Hayan with us to scout out the situation.He likely judged that it was too dangerous for us to progress hastily without knowing how many of them were clustered together, their exact numbers or location.Finally, Kim Hyunsung gave a slight nod and said,\u201cI think it would be best if we camped here today.\u201d\u201cYes. We should.\u201dWe were able to find a good spot to set up camp and rest fairly quickly.Of course, we didn\u2019t have any tents, but having an enclosed space gave us a certain sense of security.\u201cHyaeyoung-ssi and Kiyoung-ssi will take first watch, followed by Hayan-ssi and myself. Lastly, I will also take the final watch with Deokgu-ssi.\u201d\u201cWill you be alright?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dThere was no reason to stop him if he chose to take that on himself.\u2018Taking the first watch isn\u2019t bad.\u2019Unlike those with high physical attributes, I, with lousy abilities, needed to get a lot of rest.Given Kim Hyunsung\u2019s physical strength and mana, standing guard overnight wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him.\u201cGet some rest.\u201d\u201cHyung-nim, thank you in advance for your hard work.\u201d\u201cT-take care.\u201dI nodded brusquely hearing their voices.Once everyone else, including Jung Hayan, had entered the inner stone chamber, Park Hyaeyoung slowly began to bawl.It was as if she was losing her mind.She pretended to be indifferent, but personally, I expected it to be a big shock to her.The monster\u2019s screams, the terror of being guided into killing, the impact of a striking spear, and the sensation of doing it with her own hands.It made sense that she would be scared.Perhaps she was reminded of her time at the starting point, or the sight of blood and guts spilling out from the monster\u2019s body was too shocking.There was still time before our watch began.I thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to give a few words of comfort.\u201cDon\u2019t think of it as a big deal.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNow that we\u2019re here, it\u2019s something that everyone will have to go through. It would be better to think of it just as an experience you\u2019ve had a little earlier than the others.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCompared to when we\u2019d started out, she seemed rather lifeless.\u201cAt first, I thought I could\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt will be the same for everyone. You\u2019ll probably feel better once you\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d\u201cWhat was it like for Kiyoung-ssi?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really remember it. The only thought in my mind was that if I didn\u2019t do something, I would die, so I took it down with a rock. It was terrifying\u2026 But looking back, it was what I needed to do. My hands and entire body were covered with brain matter and guts, and the smell made me gag.\u201dWhen it came to living or dying, there was no choice.Doing things half-heartedly, when my life was on the line, was a gamble I didn\u2019t want to take.I figured that Park Deokgu wouldn\u2019t run away without me, and I wanted to inspire him into action.At that time, blood had rushed to my head.\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s funny, I thought you wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by it.\u201d\u201cWell, since you\u2019re helping us out, I\u2019m saying that you don\u2019t really have a choice in this.\u201dAs I\u2019d expected, she seemed to be a little bit disappointed.\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying, I thought I would\u2019ve been able to do as well as you wanted me to\u2026.\u201dI thought so too.Her disposition wasn\u2019t bad and she acted within her abilities. I thought there would have been some returns if I showed her kindness, so I had forced one more person into our group. However, reality left a lot to be desired.Seeing Park Deokgu, Kim Hyunsung, and I casually going back and forth outside, what we had set out to do might have seemed easy.From my point of view, there was no reason to invest in Park Hyaeyoung.I had Park Deokgu, who was a strong guy. Though he was a bit nervous at times, he could hold his own.I\u2019d only intentionally tried to help Park Hyaeyoung as insurance.However, if she kept getting frightened like this, she wouldn\u2019t be of much use to me either.\u201cI was a little happy when you held me from behind earlier.\u201dThinking back to it, I also remembered her shaking and trembling like an idiot.At that time, I had been cursing her out in my mind as well.But I couldn\u2019t do anything but nod my head sharply.\u201cI was a little out of it, so I might have come across a little coarse\u2026 I hope for your understanding.\u201d\u201cYes. O-of course.\u201d\u201cIn addition, that will be the first and last time I\u2019ll help you. You will be on your own next time.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dI could see Park Hyaeyoung watching me.Well, I didn\u2019t know if she wanted to have a staring match.The silence stretched on. After a while, when I was about to speak again, a voice came from behind us.\u201cO-oppa\u2026.\u201d\u201cKiyoung-ssi, Hyaeyoung-ssi. It\u2019s time to switch.\u201dKim Hyunsung and Jung Hayan came out. I hadn\u2019t expected time to pass by so quickly.\u201cYou\u2019re here a bit early. You should sleep a bit more.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I just woke up\u2026 I\u2019ll try to wake you up in the morning.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Hyunsung-ssi.\u201dI approached Jung Hayan, who stood at a bit of a distance from Kim Hyunsung, and patted her head lightly. She ducked her head and blushed.Jung Hayan was back to normal.Seeing that the look in her eyes when she saw Park Hyaeyoung didn\u2019t seem unusual, perhaps what I had seen last time was just my imagination.\u201cThanks in advance, Hayan-ah.\u201d\u201cSorry? Yes\u2026 Yes, Oppa!\u201dHer exclamation was a bit loud. She clasped her hands over her mouth, perhaps out of surprise. It was a little cute.Nodding faintly, I immediately moved inside. At a glance, I could see Park Deokgu snoring away.\u2018You sure sleep peacefully.\u2019It would be a blessing to be able to sleep like that in this kind of environment.Park Hyaeyoung went over to the spot she had claimed earlier and lay down, and I also settled down a little ways away from Park Deokgu.My head was full of idle thoughts.I wondered if, after this hunt, the group in the shelter would follow in our footsteps.What Kim Hyunsung was thinking.If there really was a way out of this place.When it came to our final assault on this place, what would we do and how would it turn out?Jung Hayan, who had already gained a class; the truth about Kim Hyunsung\u2019s regression, what had happened in the past, what kind of relationship I would have with Lee Jihye after the tutorial\u2026I asked myself what I would do if I was unable to fall asleep, but I guess that concern was completely groundless.We\u2019d walked a lot to begin with, and mentally, I was a little stressed, so my eyes closed quickly.\u2018What time is it.\u2019Perhaps because my bed was slightly uncomfortable, I woke up in the middle of the night.I could hear Park Deokgu slowly getting up. He was probably going outside to stand guard with Kim Hyungung.There was the sound of Park Hyaeyoung tossing and turning for a while, and then that of Jung Hayan coming back inside once more.\u201cSleep well, Noonim.\u201d\u201cDeok-Deokgu-ssi, thank you in advance for your hard work.\u201dI felt like they talked a little more after that, but my eyes had slowly drifted shut once again.As their voices grew quieter and quieter, my consciousness grew dim.What woke me up again was a strange sensation on my lips.It was as if there was something gripping onto my hands. I tried to get up right away, but I couldn\u2019t move my body. Rather, there was a sense that someone was staring fixedly at me.Jung Hayan\u2019s voice came to me in an almost imperceptible whisper.\u201cMm\u2026\u2026 Ahn\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t make out what she was saying because I wasn\u2019t fully awake.Of course, at that point I realised who was watching me.My hazy mind became clear.Naturally, my drowsiness fled instantaneously.I opened my left eye slightly and, glancing upwards, I made out a black shadow looking down at me.I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I wasn\u2019t so stupid as to get up in this situation.I knew then that Jung Hayan\u2019s quiet whisper didn\u2019t mean she was talking to me.\u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019Even after I tried to squeeze my eyes shut, I kept hearing noises.There was the sound of rustling clothes, the sensation of a body brushing against mine, and even the soft touch of lips.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa.\u2026\u201d\u2018What is this.\u2019I had never been so bewildered.I wasn\u2019t sure if she had some strange kink or if this was a side effect of being pushed too hard lately, but one thing for sure was that she was having a really good time.\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201dOnly it was a little too much of a good time.For now, it seemed best to cheer her on.It wasn\u2019t a bad result, as building a close relationship with Jung Hayan had been the top priority in the first place.However, the ideal relationship I\u2019d had in mind was that of Oppa-and-Dongsaeng.I never wanted to be in this kind of situation.It wasn\u2019t until a little while later that Jung Hayan collapsed a little way away from me.There was a rustling sound that kept me awake.Whether it was a good idea or not, out of curiosity, I opened my eyes slightly.I could see Jung Hayan\u2019s back as she silently looked down at Park Hyaeyoung.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe watched Park Hyaeyoung sleep for a long time.She just stood there, staring at her, without moving an inch.\u2018Is she sleepwalking, or what.\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure when things had started to get messed up, but it was clear that something had gone wrong.First of all, there was the fact that she hid the truth about her class. The look on her face when Park Hyaeyoung was selected to go on the expedition with us was also on my mind.At that moment..It occurred to me that there had to be a cause for this abnormal behaviour.It was then that Jung Hayan\u2019s head swung in my direction.It was only for a second, but our eyes met.I felt a familiar sensation.A shiver ran down my spine.\u2018Gah\u2026.\u2019I shut my eyes reflexively, but I couldn\u2019t tell if I\u2019d been caught or not.Wait, but why was I hiding?\u2018Why am I afraid?\u2019I didn\u2019t know why, but I had flinched.Was it the influence of mana? If not, was this similar to the concept of killing intent shown in manhwa?Subconsciously, my mind kept replaying the expression that Jung Hayan had worn before.Since she wasn\u2019t saying anything, it seemed like she hadn\u2019t realised I was awake. Still, something felt off within this space, which had fallen terrifyingly quiet.\u2018Shit\u2026.\u2019I didn\u2019t understand how things had turned out this way.I couldn\u2019t hear the sounds of rustling, breathing, moans, or movement that I had heard before.I could hear Park Hyaeyoung breathing intermittently, but no sound left Jung Hayan\u2019s mouth.I tried to fall asleep, but something kept me awake.Not far from me, I could sense someone quietly lying down.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dPerhaps it was Jung Hayan.A second felt like a minute.After who knows how long, a voice came from outside that spelled either fortune or disaster.\u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d_____________________________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Understood.\u201dThe first one to rise was Park Hyaeyoung.After that, I could hear Jung Hayan tossing and turning.As I was deliberating on when to get up, I felt a touch on my shoulder.\u201cHyung-nim.\u201d\u2018Park Deokgu, nice.\u2019His timing wasn\u2019t bad.Perhaps because I wasn\u2019t able to sleep well, I suddenly felt a wave of tiredness wash over me. Even so, I squinted my eyes open and sat up.\u201cIs it time already?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re planning to get going a little bit earlier today. We\u2019ve decided to venture a little further out for hunting before returning to the shelter.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dI deliberately didn\u2019t let myself turn away from Jung Hayan. I knew it would be more awkward to avoid her.When I glanced at her I could see that she was smiling brightly in my direction.She seemed so different from the day before.I couldn\u2019t believe they were the same person. It was like she was another person.\u2018Which one is real?\u2019I didn\u2019t know if her current expression was genuine, or if what I\u2019d seen last night was her true self.For now, I thought it was best to cool off, so right after shooting her a small smile, I began to compose myself.\u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019Since I couldn\u2019t sleep well at night, my mind was blank.When I went outside, Kim Hyunsung looked in my direction and began to speak.\u201cYou look tired.\u201d\u201cJust a bit, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cIt would be good for us to go further out today. Would that be all right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to be a problem. Currently, there doesn\u2019t seem to be many creatures nearby. I\u2019m a little bit worried about the people staying at the shelter, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely for anything to happen to them in the meantime. However, if we think there will be too many for them to handle\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes. Of course, we\u2019ll make sure to head back right away.\u201dThat was a reasonable judgement call.\u201cBy the way, which way\u2026.\u201d\u201cI scoped out the left path last night, and it wasn\u2019t any different.\u201dNot only did he take the watch twice, he even searched ahead.\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201dIf there are workers who are as diligent as this, someone like me gets to have a good time.I thought that it was possible for there to be something on the right pathway, but it was still too early to tell.\u201cHyaeyoung-ssi and Hayan-ssi..,\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all set too.\u201d\u201cIn terms of positions, if we find monsters like yesterday, then Hayan-ssi will come forward to replace Hyaeyoung-ssi instead. All right, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt seemed like the march ahead would be a tiring one.What worried me the most was Jung Hayan\u2019s presence.I had no idea what was going on, but the behaviour Jung Hayan had demonstrated recently was abnormal.It was so out of the ordinary that anyone would notice.Her appearance was at odds with my impression of her.My top priority was to determine the root cause of it. I had an inkling of the cause, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit perplexed.\u2018Jealousy?\u2019The problem with this idea was that Jung Hayan and I had barely spent enough time together for me to jump to that conclusion.The strength of relationships weren\u2019t always proportional to the time spent together, but it was undeniable that that was still an important factor.Of course, the situation we both found ourselves in was somewhat special.This place wasn\u2019t some caf\u00e9 or restaurant.In a cheap B-list movie, for instance, a man and a woman facing a crisis would develop feelings that seemed like love over a short period of time.Perhaps her feelings were the same.Jung Hayan\u2019s past came to mind.Looking back at her personal history, it was possible to form some reasonable deductions.Her parents were gone, and she lost contact with her sisters a long time ago.Given that she had been abandoned by her family, I understood why she wanted to lean on me a little more.She wouldn\u2019t have grown up in a kind environment.\u2018It\u2019s a simple deduction.\u2019However, for some reason, I had become a lifeline for her to clutch onto.I would have been a kind person she could always trust and rely upon.Perhaps those feelings had evolved from mere emotion to obsession.Originally, what I had also been aiming for was to take on the role of her confidante.It was easier to draw in a person with cracks in their heart.\u2018Shall we test it out?\u2019It was a classic, clich\u00e9 approach, but it was worth a try.While walking side by side next to Park Hyaeyoung, I slowly opened my mouth and pulled her shoulder slightly.\u201cCareful.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes.\u201dShe looked a little nervous.It looked like she thought I had prevented her from almost tripping over a rock.She seemed to be trying to thank me for it, but my goal wasn\u2019t her reaction.I glanced at Jung Hayan from the corner of my eyes.It was only natural to see that she was staring at Park Hyaeyoung.Kim Hyunsung and Park Deokgu didn\u2019t seem to notice, but perhaps because of the effect of my attribute, I could see it clearly.Jung Hayan\u2019s eyes were filled with some kind of indescribable emotion.\u2018I can use this.\u2019Her animosity wasn\u2019t directed at me.I thought it might be a bit too excessive to call it ordinary jealousy, but if you considered Jung Hayan\u2019s sincerity, it was still within a tolerable range.If I gave her carrots and sticks in moderation, Jung Hayan would be a faithful family member who would throw herself away for my sake.Numerous thoughts filled my head as we walked. Before I knew it, we had covered quite a fair distance.\u201cI think there are some nearby. From here on in, we need to keep our guard up.\u201d\u201cAhem. Alright, Hyung-ssi.\u201dPerhaps from this point, everything in this area had already been seen by Kim Hyunsung once before.It certainly smelled different from before.It felt like the strange stench emanating from those creatures was everywhere.What stood out more than that, however, was the faint trace of mana I could sense in the distance.I didn\u2019t know what type it was, but I could definitely feel something different about it.Perhaps this was what Kim Hyunsung was after.\u201cI think I sense something.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Hyung-nim. Do you see them?\u201d\u201cI can feel a faint source of mana ahead of us. I\u2019m not sure what it is\u2026 Anyway\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s suffocating to have no magic. Hyung-ssi, can you feel it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but since Kiyoung-ssi is a wizard, he would be more adept at sensing differences than us. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to check it out for now. There may be some hints on clearing this place.\u201dKim Hyunsung certainly lacked the talent for acting.The faint mana ahead of us seemed to be related to clearing this dungeon.\u201cWell, we\u2019re heading in that direction anyway, but there\u2019s no harm in being more cautious, so I\u2019ll take the lead.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201dThere was no need for caution.If Kim Hyunsung had sensed that there was something wrong with this place, we wouldn\u2019t still be here.As I carefully stepped forward, I could see at a glance what the source of the mana was.\u2018Stairs.\u2019\u201cThose stairs lead down.\u201dThey were literally just stairs that went down to a lower level. It was only then that I could see that this dungeon had multiple levels.Looking at Kim Hyunsung nodding, he seemed to believe that his contrived setup was convincing.As ridiculous as it was, it didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea to play along.\u201cIt\u2019s a common set-up, but does this mean that the further down you go, the more difficult it gets? I think that there might be some connection to clearing the dungeon here.\u201d\u201cUm, do you think so? Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still unsure, but we haven\u2019t found any other clues so far at this level, where there\u2019s the starting point. Dumping us in this vast place only for us to deal with monsters when they told us to clear the dungeon seems unreasonable. It\u2019s highly likely that going down from here is only the beginning. I don\u2019t know what will happen, but at the very least there may be more clues than what we currently have.\u201dKim Hyunsung listened to me and nodded when he heard my words.\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d\u2018Just.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s too much for us right now, so let\u2019s start with keeping note of this place for now and go down another time. We didn\u2019t come here to clear the dungeon today. We might find something that could help us down there. It\u2019s also possible that there are different monster species below.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d hate for even more irritating punks to come out.\u201dMe too.Regardless, Kim Hyunsung had successfully alerted us to the existence of the underground entrance without acting unnatural.For someone like him, this might feel like a big achievement.However, the growth of Jung Hayan and Park Hyaeyoung was more urgent. Only when we had readied a number of people able to fight, could we go down.\u201cThe road.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve roughly got it down in my mind.\u201d\u201cThen, from now on, will we be scouting for monsters around here?\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019d better do that. Let\u2019s start a little way from this point.\u201d\u201cOkay, Hyung-ssi.\u201dLike yesterday, we looked for those creatures with our eyes blazing, and were able to find some in our immediate vicinity.Perhaps these monsters had originated from here and had spread out as they got further away.There were three monsters close by.I glanced at Kim Hyunsung and saw him nodding.\u201cIf Deokgu-ssi takes on two of those guys, Kiyoung-ssi will quickly take care of one of them and I\u2019ll handle the other. We\u2019ll use the last one as a training dummy. Hyaeyoung-ssi and Hayan-ssi can take a similar position to Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dPark Deokgu and I clenched our teeth and sprung forward.Park Deokgu took the lead to see if he could draw their aggro.I also ran ahead, leaving behind Park Hyaeyoung and Jung Hayan who both looked nervous.I watched from behind as Park Deokgu pushed one back with his shield and fended the other off with his leather-covered arm.Kim Hyunsung looked somewhat relaxed as he ran towards one of them and succeeded in cutting off its arm.\u2018He\u2019s extremely fast.\u2019I\u2019d expected him to be a little faster because of his high agility, but his speed was beyond my imagination.At the same time, I applied a bit of mana to the end of my spear and threw it at the one Park Deokgu was holding on to.Puuk! Blood gushed out as the sound resounded, but I couldn\u2019t afford to relax just yet.\u2018It\u2019s not dead yet.\u2019When I went to stab it with my spear again, Park Hyaeyoung was next to me, holding onto her spear as though she wanted to do something.\u2018Not bad.\u2019For now, the most important thing was that she had the will to act.There was no need to look over at Kim Hyunsung.Perhaps he would try to take it down with a moderate amount of strength so that he wouldn\u2019t appear strange.That just left the one we would be using as a training dummy.Even before Park Deokgu had moved to capture it, Park Hyaeyoung, who seemed excited, began to extend her spear.\u2018Dumbass.\u2019She was obviously stupid.As you\u2019d expect, the monster was outside of Park Deokgu\u2019s range when the spear was deflected.\u201cAck! I-I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cGah.\u201dIn every five-man band, there will be one dead weight.\u201cDeokgu-yah.\u201dThis saying I\u2019d heard somewhere had some truth to it.\u201cGyaaaaaaaaaaak!!\u201d\u2018Dumb bitch!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cKyaaaaaaak!!\u201dIt was only natural that she was surprised. The monster\u2019s mouth opened wide as it lunged forward to devour her.If she hadn\u2019t suddenly run out, spear in hand, she wouldn\u2019t have drawn its attention.Those things weren\u2019t intelligent and anyone observing the situation clearly would be able to see that Park Deokgu was able to hold back the attacking monster.However, instead of staying level-headed, Park Hyaeyoung, this fucking bitch, chose to air out her fears like this.\u201cDamn it!\u201dPark Hyaeyoung had completely flipped the situation on its head.Those things were sensitive to sound.An ordinary conversation wouldn\u2019t carry far, but such a loud scream would naturally make them aware of our presence here.All the monsters in the vicinity would probably come running.Perhaps Kim Hyunsung thought the same as he promptly smashed in the head of the monster he was dealing with, then stabbed the one Park Deokgu had captured in the chest.His speed seemed a bit outside the boundaries of human capabilities, but Kim Hyunsung likely didn\u2019t have the luxury of paying attention to that when the situation was rapidly deteriorating.I could see that monstrous thing still quivering but that wasn\u2019t the issue right now.\u201cWe need to get out of here right now.\u201d\u201cDamn it\u2026.\u201d\u201cS-sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cKiyoung-ss, Hyaeyoung-ssi, Hayan-ssi\u2026 If anything happens, we\u2019ll have Deokgu-ssi cut a path\u201d.\u201cWell, what about Hyung-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to draw the monsters away. If you leave a mark, I\u2019ll find you. Kiyoung-ssi, it would be better for you to take a detour rather than heading straight to the shelter.\u201dI nodded sharply.If we led all the monsters after us to the shelter, it would be like offering them an all-you-can-eat buffet.Kim Hyunsung seemed to be trying to solve this situation on his own but his expression didn\u2019t seem to be good.Even though Kim Hyunsung was a regressor, he was still a rookie at this point.He might be capable of dealing with them to a certain extent, but if they overwhelmed him with numbers, it would be extremely difficult to take care of them in such close quarters.\u201cHyung-nim, which way\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to turn around a bit before returning.\u201d\u201cA-alright.\u201dSeemingly realising the severity of her mistake, Park Hyaeyoung looked at me, her face pale.She likely realised that if she messed up further, there would really be an opportunity to scream her lungs out soon.\u201cGet up.\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026.\u201d\u201cStick together and run as fast as you can.\u201d\u201cI-I understand.\u201dJung Hayan was silent.She was looking around blankly, with an expression as though she were thinking hard about something.\u201cHayan-ah.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes! Oppa.\u201dHer body language suggested that she wasn\u2019t particularly scared.Seeing her like this, I was reminded that Jung Hayan would become a strong Wizard in the future.Jung Hayan was also a Wizard so, should the situation become too much for us to handle, she might be able to help us.\u2018Our chances of survival are high.\u2019We could make it through this.\u201cThen, I pray for your success[1].\u201d\u201cWell, be careful, Hyung-ssi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be alright.\u201dPark Deokgu immediately took up his shield and began to run.Park Hyaeyoung also followed us with a look of terror on her face.Though I still felt irritated, now was not the time to argue.Instead, I began to construct spells.Concentrate mana into a tower. I had very little to speak of, but it might save us if the situation took a turn for the worse.\u201cCan you run and cast? Hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me. My head hurts.\u201dThat was how hard it was to concentrate on spells.Trying to move your feet and hands to do one thing while completely thinking of something else would be difficult for anyone.\u2018It\u2019s difficult\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy, wish\u2026.\u201dThe tower of mana I kept trying to build collapsed. I couldn\u2019t concentrate properly. It felt like my head was going to explode; my brain was being overloaded.\u2018Just make one slowly.\u2019It was feasible enough if I pretended there was nothing around me while I wove the spell.I slowly built the tower up once more.We hadn\u2019t even met those fucking monsters yet anyway.There was plenty of time to construct it.\u201cLord, my, wish, answer, my call, please give me, the strength, to burn my enemies.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but lengthen the invocation. It was annoying as hell but the spell, which was clearly imprinted in my mind, was manifested in my hand.A sphere of fire. The fire sphere, which was the size of a human skull, appeared in my hand.\u201cOh, that\u2019s amazing! When did you learn something like that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me, Deokgu-yah. It\u2019s hard to concentrate.\u201dIt was hard work to construct spells and keep them going.The wobbling tower of mana needed to constantly be repaired and balanced to prevent its collapse.\u2018It\u2019s extremely complicated.\u2019In media such as manhwa, anime, or novels, this kind of magic always looked like something you could do easily.But in reality, my head felt like it was about to split apart when I used it.It made me wonder if intelligence was a more important prerequisite than mana when it came to becoming a Wizard.\u201cWhere next?\u201d\u201cLeft.\u201dI was irritated that even in this situation, I had to give directions to Park Deokgu.\u201cGaeeeeeeeek!\u201dI could hear the voices of monsters in the distance. They were still a fair bit away so I couldn\u2019t really distinguish their exact numbers.\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cAbout two.\u201d\u201cTake care of it on your own.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try, Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cEven if you can\u2019t kill them, it doesn\u2019t matter; just clear a path.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dKwajik! Puuk! These sounds rang out.Naturally, Park Deokgu\u2019s back felt quite reliable as he continued to run forward.He seemed a little like a tank.\u201cNext!\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cGaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeek!\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s no end to them\u2026.\u201dI stretched my arm out right away.\u201cFireball.\u201dThe sphere of flames that I had been holding in my hand halted then began to fly in a straight line.I hadn\u2019t expected it to recoil then move in a line.Perhaps because of wind pressure, my hand was buffeted towards the sky for a moment. However, even as the enchantment flew forward, my mind didn\u2019t stop casting the spell.I didn\u2019t want the spell I\u2019d worked so hard to build to fly off somewhere weird.Boong!The sphere impacted the body of one shitty monster then spread out in all directions.Kwajik!As they were struck by the sphere, the monsters were blown into the air by the flames.Wind rushed towards us in the aftermath of the explosion.Naturally, Park Deokgu blocked it with the shield.Seeing the majority of the monsters flung to the walls, screaming as they caught fire, or incapacitated, he looked at me with an expression of surprise.It was a tight space, and luckily they had all been crowded together, but I was surprised by the scale of damage from the magical attack.\u201cWoah\u2026 Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cHooo\u2026 Hooo\u2026.\u201dLeft drained of mana for a moment, my legs began to shake.However, we somehow managed to clear the way.\u201cAgain.\u201dThat\u2019s when I felt that something was weird.\u201cAh!\u201dPark Deokgu also subconsciously looked back, and stared at me with a look of shock.\u2018Jung Hayan, Park Hyaeyoung.\u2019The two of them were no longer with us.\u201cWhen was\u2026. The last time you saw them?\u201d\u201cO-only a moment ago I-I thought they were following us\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou.\u201dI contained my surging irritation and bit back the curses that were about to spill from my mouth.This was my fault.I had no idea when the two of them had been separated from us because I was busy trying to construct the spell in my head.The fact that even Park Deokgu didn\u2019t notice was a bit unexpected, but I was sure that they weren\u2019t far behind.The important thing was whether they knew the way.Jung Hayan might remember, but I wasn\u2019t sure about Park Hyaeyoung; I felt that that bottom feeder wouldn\u2019t have memorised the path.Just following us must have been hard enough for her.\u201cH-how could I\u2026. I-I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Deokgu-yah. I should have paid more attention. Shoot[2].\u201d\u201cWhat do we d-do now?\u201dThat was a question I wanted to ask myself.If Park Hyaeyoung was the only one who had been separated from us, of course, I would have abandoned her.The issue was that Jung Hayan was with her.She was a lottery ticket that was guaranteed to win big. Losing her in a place like this was so absurd, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to laugh.I didn\u2019t like gambling.But when necessary, you had to act.\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re still alive.\u201d\u201cT-then.\u201d\u201cIf they were thinking clearly, they\u2019d have made a mark for us to spot. Let\u2019s turn back for now.\u201d\u201cGood thinking, Hyung-nim.\u201dThere was a high probability that Kim Hyunsung was taking care of the monsters trailing behind us.What we had to focus on was the hungry swarms closing in on us from all sides.It was hard to recite spells.My mana levels were already at rock bottom, but I thought it might be possible for me to do something once more if I squeezed out every last drop.\u201cCan you think about the last time you saw them?\u201d\u201cT-the last thing I remember was them running away with us. I-I saw\u2026 I didn\u2019t hear any screaming\u2026.\u201dI also couldn\u2019t recall it that well.I remembered that the two of them had been following me when I was reciting the spell.It seemed safe to assume that they had disappeared while I was maintaining the magic.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI was anxious at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt that something was strange.Although Park Deokgu was dimwitted, he wasn\u2019t so stupid as to miss the two people following us suddenly disappearing.Neither was I.In the first place, Park Deokgu\u2019s agility stats weren\u2019t high. I wasn\u2019t sure about Jang Hayan, but it certainly wasn\u2019t to the point where Park Hyaeyoung wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep up.It wasn\u2019t a situation where a monster would grab them by the ankles.They may have been caught by a trap in the dungeon itself, but the probability of that was low.This was the road we\u2019d passed through in the beginning.If there was a trap here, Kim Hyunsung would have given a word of warning.Suddenly, I remembered the way Jung Hayan had looked at Park Hyaeyoung.\u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it.\u2019It was too early to reach a conclusion, but if Jung Hayan had wanted to keep her away from me, it would explain things somewhat.She couldn\u2019t have been able to tell which spell I was casting, but there was a chance that I wouldn\u2019t have noticed her weaving a different spell while I was concentrating on mine.At that time, I couldn\u2019t have spared any attention to anything else while I was trying to maintain the spell.Park Deokgu, who had no mana to begin with, wouldn\u2019t have noticed what Jung Hayan was doing either.Kim Hyunsung, who was far from us, was out of the question.I hated to think about it, but I thought I could make a guess on the prime candidate who would want to create a situation where Jung Hayan was alone with Park Hyaeyoung.\u2018The question is why.\u2019I didn\u2019t want to assume the worst, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy.As I was running forward with Park Deokgu, I began to feel a faint trace of mana just like when I had found the entrance to the dungeon below.\u2018Bitch\u2026.\u2019\u201cDeokgu-ya, hurry up.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dIt had just been a rough guess.However, the faint sense of mana was strengthening my hypothesis.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please listen to what I have to say.\u201d\u201cGo with Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI believe it would be advantageous to make things more convenient for people like Kiyoung-ssi in various ways. Not just today, but going forward as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe decision is all yours, Hyaeyoung-ssi. You can do whatever you think is manageable. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re just a pack mule\u2026 Ah! You wouldn\u2019t make a bad handmaid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat last bit was just a joke. But thinking about it seriously might not be a bad idea\u2026. The situation here isn\u2019t that good. Not only are we lacking in rations, but there are a limited number of people who can go hunting. Hyunsung-ssi has been helping us by disposing of the monsters around here regularly, but who knows what the future holds. The reality is that we can\u2019t afford to make assumptions about the future. We have to think about the possibility that the men who go hunting might die and never come back, and ask ourselves what we would do afterwards.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to get acquainted with a capable man. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better for people like us to take out an insurance policy? If things go well, you never know what might happen. Perhaps you could get special treatment like Jung Hayan-ssi\u2026.\u201d\u201cI see what you mean.\u201d\u201cAh! There\u2019s a rumour that they\u2019ll be taking Hayan-ssi out on the next hunt. Wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea for Hyaeyoung-ssi to give it a try?\u201d\u201cThank you for giving me so much advice, but\u2026 is there a reason you\u2019re being so nice to me?\u201d\u201cWell. It\u2019s just a passing fancy. But if things go well, I\u2019d like you to return the favour. I\u2019m not the kind of person who likes to gamble.\u201d* * *\u2018Shitty bitch.\u2019Lee Jihye, that fucking bitch.She continued to curse out Lee Jihye internally, not that it changed anything.After all, she had been the one to make the mistake. Rather, everything had been her choice to begin with.Both agreeing with Lee Jihye\u2019s words and following Lee Kiyoung as a guinea pig, everything had been done with the expectation that it would work out.She had done something stupid right off the bat and had made up her mind to make up for the mistake.Pushing herself to seem like a useful person by wielding a spear had been a huge blunder.Unbeknownst to her, the scream that had then erupted from her mouth had been an even greater mistake.She could see Lee Kiyoung and Park Deokgu continuing forward before her.Lee Kiyoung never stopped chanting spells aloud and Park Deokgu rebuffed the monsters lunging at them with his huge shield.Maybe because of her fear, her legs felt wobbly, but naturally, collapsing was out of the question.\u2018I\u2019ll die.\u2019She knew that she would die if she stopped running.Glancing to the side, she saw that Jung Hayan was also following behind, muttering quietly to herself.\u2018Idiot\u2026.\u2019She was lucky enough to catch Lee Kiyoung\u2019s eye, and lucky enough to gain her current position amongst this group.No other woman would be as lucky as her.After making such a big mistake, if they made it back alive, then it was almost certain that she would have to resign from this group.When Park Hyaeyoung thought that she was just a teaching aid for Jung Hayan, she tasted something bitter in her mouth.In the first place\u2026.She didn\u2019t know how Jung Hayan could be so calm.Kim Hyunsung, Lee Kiyoung, and Park Deokgu, who continued to unflinchingly attack with swords and spears, even in front of monsters, were also incredible.In her case, Park Hyaeyoung couldn\u2019t overcome the feeling of killing or her fear of dying.It was laughable that she had thought it might be easy.However, Jung Hayan\u2019s case was a bit different.It was her first time here, just like Park Hyaeyoung, and the first time she had was directly facing the monsters in person.The lack of fear in that quiet gaze was unmistakable.Park Hyaeyoung had wondered if Jung Hayan was crazy when she kept talking to herself, but she didn\u2019t seem to be shaken.\u2018You can\u2019t break down like this.\u2019In this new reality called the tutorial, they had to build up their strength to survive. She took advantage of Lee Kiyoung and Kim Hyunsung because she knew it was impossible to do so by herself.If you think about it, anyone branded with the label of being unable to hunt obviously would not be able to grasp the same power those two held, and over time, would become just like cold, leftover rice.Only one option remained.\u2018I have to get close to them somehow.\u2019If she made it back alive, ties with Lee Kiyoung had to be made at all costs.She had to stick to him by any means whatsoever.Of course, the presence of Jung Hayan next to him was annoying, but over time he would recognise her worth.It was obvious that she was better than that stupid woman.Park Deokgu and Lee Kiyoung, who were gritting their teeth and never stopped running, veered to the left.At that moment, she realised that she could no longer see them.\u2018Huh?\u2019She felt as though she had been possessed by a ghost. She didn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u2018When did that happen?\u2019Obviously, she had been running after them.This kind of situation could be called nothing but running into a ghost wall.[1]She couldn\u2019t remember when or why they had vanished.Jung Hayan was also quietly staring at the wall blocking off the passage.\u201cDo you know where Kiyoung-ssi and Deokgu-ssi went?\u201dShe cautiously tried to speak with the other woman but didn\u2019t get a reply.It had been a mistake to ask in the first place.\u2018She\u2019s as dull as a doorknob\u2026.\u2019Even Park Hyaeyoung had lost sight of them in an instant.If she couldn\u2019t tell where they had gone, there was no way the blind bitch next to her would be able to.This woman had probably only been trailing after her.\u201cGaaaeeeeek.\u201dThe voice of a monster sounded in the distance.Naturally, she began to tremble instantly.She knew that she needed to leave this area but her feet were glued to the spot.Because she couldn\u2019t figure out where to go.Perhaps by now, Kiyoung-ssi had noticed that they were lost.If they hung around a little longer and waited, those two would surely come to find them.She was sure they would.At the ridiculous sight of Jung Hayan, who was muttering nonsense even in this situation, Park Hyaeyoung could barely hold back her laughter.\u201cThe power, to protect myself, from my enemies, who try to steal from me.\u201dIt seemed to be a prayer to someone, but her actions were completely beyond comprehension.Lee Kiyoung, who had concerned himself with a woman like this, also seemed to be out of his mind.\u201cWind blade.\u201dShiik-She heard a sound as though the air was ripping apart.\u201cShut up, you moron. Can\u2019t you hear the monsters?\u201dIt was when she tried to take a small step forward.\u2018Huh?\u2019Her balance gave way out of nowhere.Against her own will, her body crumpled to the ground.At the same time, she felt an unbearable pain in her left leg.Bright red blood began to spurt from her leg and splash to the ground.She could see her left leg had been separated from her body and was lying away from her.\u2018What\u2026 Happened\u2026.\u2019A scream tore free from her mouth before she could even think.\u201cGyaaaaaaaaaaaaa! S-somebody! Anybody, please\u2026 P-please help me. He-help!\u201d\u201cI-I-it\u2019s useless. Hyae-Hyaeyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cM-my leg\u2026 My leg\u2026.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019ve b-blocked off the surrounding sound with mana. I\u2019m not sure if you can hear me. Y-you don\u2019t need to worry about the monsters coming here. You can relax.\u201d\u201cPlease h-help me, please\u2026.\u201d\u201cY-you\u2019re m-more stupid than I thought. Hyaeyoung-ssi\u2026. Y-you caused trouble for Oppa\u2026 And y-you ruined my outing.\u201d\u201cShut up. Fuck! It hurts\u2026 It hurts! Can\u2019t you see my leg right now? Quickly bring Kiyoung-ssi here or\u2026\u201dPark Hyaeyoung continued to grip her burning leg with her hands.She couldn\u2019t think clearly because of the blood pouring out from her body.She took off her jacket and tied it around her leg to stem the bleeding, but it was hard to tell whether this rough treatment would be enough.Her jaw shook.It was only natural for her body to tremble.She couldn\u2019t understand why her leg had fallen off in the first place.She didn\u2019t even want to comprehend the truth.However, figuring out whether this was a nightmare or reality was a more pressing matter.The pain continued to burn as though her body was on fire.Her vision became blurred by her tears.When Park Hyaeyoung looked up slightly, she saw Jung Hayan smiling brightly at her.\u2018Huh?\u2019She was holding something in her hands that was made of some strange material.\u2018Wind blade.\u2019Suddenly those words flickered through her mind.Park Hyaeyoung was in disbelief, but it was clear that an emerald green wind was swirling around Jung Hayan\u2019s hands.\u2018For what reason? Why? How could she?\u2019 Even before those thoughts ran through her mind, she was filled with an instinctive fear.\u201cAh\u2026 Ha-Hayan-ssi\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes. Hyaeyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cW-why are you doing this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI-I didn\u2019t w-want to do this. I-I couldn\u2019t help it though. Because you keep trying to take m-my Oppa away from me. I-I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019m not d-doing this because I like it.\u201d\u201cW-what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI hate it when you pretend you\u2019re clueless.\u2026 Hyaeyoung-ssi, y-you should have known you were f-fawning over my Oppa, didn\u2019t you? Y-y-you should have realised you were trying to take him away, didn\u2019t you? You said you were going to take him away, didn\u2019t you?\u2018In\u2026sane.\u201dShe was out of her mind.Park Hyaeyoung was baffled that she somehow hadn\u2019t noticed it before.The woman before her was definitely crazy. The corners of her mouth lifted up and her eyes seemed to be filled with the light of madness.\u201cIt was\u2026 It was just meaningless chatter. \u201c\u201cLies.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying. D-do you know how much you hurt me? I-It felt like my heart was broken when you talked with Oppa, held hands with O-oppa, and leaned on O-oppa. Maybe y-you can\u2019t even comprehend how I felt.\u201d\u201cI-I can understand. Uhuh\u2026 I-I can understand. So, h-help me. I-I won\u2019t appear in front of y-your Oppa ever again.\u201d\u201cS-sorry. No matter how much I think about it, I can\u2019t even look at you. Hyaeyoung-ssi, you should hurt as much as me. I really can\u2019t forgive you for trying to take my Oppa away. And if you\u2019re alive, I-I\u2019ll feel so nervous\u2026.\u201d\u201cGyaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201dThere was a gruesome sound as her other arm was cut off.She felt a great deal of pain.She writhed, but nothing changed. All she could think about was that she had to get out of there somehow.Though she struggled to crawl away, it was impossible through the pain and fear.\u201cSa-save me. Please\u2026 Please, I was wrong. Help me. Please\u2026 Ahhhhhhhh.\u201d\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do that. It will only m-make you weaker.\u201d\u201cPlease, I was completely wrong. It\u2019s all my fault! It was because of my mistake. Mmf! Mm!\u201d\u201cMa-magic can do this too. It\u2019s better to keep your mouth shut because you\u2019re so noisy.\u201dHer voice couldn\u2019t escape.It felt like something was strangling her. Tears began to pour from her eyes. She continued to struggle because of the pain wracking her body, but it was futile.\u201cMm\u2026 Mm! MM!\u201d\u201cT-then, I-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAs she continued to struggle, she could hear a voice from somewhere beyond her line of sight.\u201cHayan-ah?\u201d\u201cO-oppa.\u201dIt was the man responsible for all of this, Lee Kiyoung.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was also caught between two options.\u2018Is it fine if I run away?\u2019If not.\u2018Would it be better to feign ignorance?\u2019I had to consider this issue carefully.My body, feeling the sense of danger, was screaming at me to keep walking, but my brain betrayed that expectation.I began to weigh the pros and cons.I was sure that Jung Hayan definitely felt goodwill towards me.In addition, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that her feelings had become excessive over time.The motive behind her attempt to kill Park Hyaeyoung was also likely related to me.Rather, it had to be related.Maybe, before[1], there would have also been bad blood between her and Park Hyaeyoung, but based on her behaviour, there was currently only one answer to this whole thing.If I hesitated in front of Jung Hayan here.Perhaps her blade would turn on me.I refused to scuffle with a crazy woman who slung around spells I didn\u2019t know like it was nothing.I\u2019d been going around in circles for so long it almost felt unnatural.In the end, I had no choice but to open my mouth carefully.It was the most reasonable choice.\u201cHyae-Hyaeyoung-ssi how\u2026 did this happen?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dPlease don\u2019t waste the opportunity I\u2019ve given you.Please tell me the right answer.I can\u2019t help you any more than this.\u201cWhy are her arms and legs\u2026 What happened?\u201dDon\u2019t forget to cover your mouth with your hands. You can\u2019t leave out the disbelieving expression.It was then that Jung Hayan\u2019s face brightened slightly. Contrary to her expectations, she seemed to think that the worst-case scenario she had imagined hadn\u2019t arrived.She must have thought that I didn\u2019t know she was behind this.The choice of what to say was very simple.She should be able to find the answer easily.\u201cI\u2019m also not sure about the details. Oppa\u2026 A-all of a sudden\u2026\u201dTrembling hands and legs, quivering lips and a shaky voice.She wasn\u2019t frightened at all.She just didn\u2019t want to let me know that she was the culprit.Perhaps it came from being unaccustomed to lying. Nevertheless, Jung Hayan continued to speak.\u201cWhen I opened my eyes, I saw that I had been separated from everyone, I-I don\u2019t know how. When I came here, I found Hyaeyoung-ssi\u2026 L-like this.\u201d\u2018Not bad.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a bad excuse. I took Jung Hayan\u2019s hands into my own trembling fingers and pulled her into my arms.\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt anywhere, are you?\u201d\u201cO-oppa.\u201dI was the one who had to worry about getting hurt.My heart was pounding like crazy.Not only was I constantly checking to see if she was casting any spells, I was also gripping tight onto my spear.As I did so, Park Hyaeyoung was looking at Jung Hayan in horror.\u201cMmf! Mmm! MMM! Mhm! Mm!\u201dI could hazard a guess as to what she was trying to say.\u2018Run away.\u2019Or.\u2018Save me.\u2019There was a high probability it was the latter, but unfortunately, there was nothing I could do.To antagonise or disregard Jung Hayan here would be an act of suicide.Her mind was definitely more worn out and fractured than I had assumed.She liked me, but since her obsession had led to hostility and murder, I had no idea how she would react if I said I didn\u2019t believe her.Perhaps that anger would extend towards me.I\u2019d been handed a ticking bomb, but between someone who had useful talents and a piece of trash who wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, who should I choose?The answer was obvious.Anyone with eyes would know that it was rational to side with Jung Hayan.That wasn\u2019t the only issue.\u2018I can\u2019t save her.\u2019I had no ability to save Park Hyaeyoung as she slowly died.Even if she was really a useful card, I had no choice but to discard this hand.I could empathise, but I was desperate, too.\u201cMmm! Mmf! MMMMM! Mmmf!\u201dIt was hard to turn away from someone who was desperately begging me to save her and not abandon her.I rushed up to her and began to use my clothes to tie the wounds.Jung Hayan made an expression as though she was frightened out of her wits but I was sure she knew.\u2018Park Hyayeoung is dying. She\u2019s likely going to die very soon.\u2019The bleeding was already too excessive. There were signs that she was slowly losing consciousness and her eyes were no longer focused.\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that the traps in the dungeon were activated. You weren\u2019t able to notice it though because we passed through a wall of mana.\u201dJung Hayan had created the barrier.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cConsidering the mana I felt near the entrance to the level below, there could be trap devices scattered around us. I hadn\u2019t accounted for that.\u201dThere were no such devices on the first floor. I could be sure of that.\u201cMaybe the trap was triggered in the process of me casting my spell. There\u2019s a high possibility that the magic that\u2019s blocking her mouth is some other unknown trap\u2026 Fortunately, I don\u2019t feel any other mana around us, but\u2026.\u201dJung Hayan had been the one to invoke the spell.\u201cYes\u2026 You\u2019re right\u2026.\u201d\u201cMMM! mMm!\u201dI had already come up with a plan starring Jung Hayan.The question was whether this bullshit would work on Kim Hyunsung.That guy had already been here once, so he had to know that there were no traps on the first floor.Talking nonsense would just earn his suspicion.I had no idea whether I could help Park Hyaeyoung like this.How would he react when he found Hyaeyoung-ssi?\u201dCaught in a trap?There were no traps here to begin with, and he was well-aware of that.Struck by a monster?The cuts were too neat. Anyone who saw her would be able to tell that Park Hyaeyoung hadn\u2019t been attacked by a monster.The faint trace of mana around her body, as well as the mysterious magic still sealing her mouth, were definitely signs that Park Hyaeyoung was killed by something other than a monster.Kim Hyunsung was definitely, definitely going to notice.I kept trying to bind the wounds, but it was a far cry from actual first aid.I had never learned basic haemostasis or first aid.The most I could do was pretend to do something.\u2018Damn it..\u2019In the end, I felt Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s movements, as she jerked and squirmed, begin to weaken little by little.\u2018Just don\u2019t get discovered.\u2019Kim Hyunsung couldn\u2019t be the one to find her.The best method was for monsters to come across her first, but that was something I didn\u2019t want to think about.Above all.\u2018I don\u2019t want that.\u2019I was reluctant to let that happen.You\u2019d be right to think that this was the last shred of my conscience.I could see her starting to gasp. She was struggling to breathe.I quietly began to chant a spell.\u201cLord. The power, to ward, with burning flames.\u201dJung Hayan looked at me with an uneasy expression.\u201cFire wall.\u201dIt was magic that was invoked by drawing out mana that I didn\u2019t have.I was overcome by dizziness at that moment, but I bit down harshly on my lips to concentrate on maintaining my magic.\u201cO-oppa.\u201d\u201cIt would be hard to take her away from here. She\u2019s already bled too much. If we all try to leave together, we\u2019ll die. I can\u2019t lose you too\u2026. So for now, we need to hurry and get out of here as soon as possible. We can\u2019t take the body with us. At least, like this, we can send her off properly. Yeah, this is the right thing to do.\u201dPark Hyaeyoung was already on her last breath as the flames began to cling to her and swallow her up.The surging flames seemed to resemble a rowdy party.I stared blankly at the scene.\u2018It was the best choice.\u2019It was the most logical decision.Glancing at Jung Hayan\u2019s face, I had a feeling that she was struggling to hold back a smile. Nausea rolled in my stomach, but she wasn\u2019t the only one who had become a monster.I was just like her.For some reason, I felt ashamed.I wanted to watch the fire a little longer, but it would be suicide to stay here.Maybe because of the flames I had called, Jung Hayan\u2019s magic wall was torn down.As soon as I moved forward, I could see Park Deokgu waiting there.\u201cWhere\u2019s Hyaeyoung-ssi? Noonim isn\u2019t hurt\u2026.\u201dWhen I shook my head wordlessly, he nodded as though he knew what had happened.He had smiled slightly at finding Jung Hayan, but when I hinted that Park Hyaeyoung was dead, his face became stiff.\u201cWhat about the other monsters nearby?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen that many, so I think that Kim Hyunsung hyung-ssi might have led them away\u2026 He\u2019s quick on his feet, so he can survive one way or another.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThat was truly a relief. The fact that he was so far away from us was a huge relief.\u201cBy the way, w-what happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long explanation. I\u2019ll explain it to you later. It\u2019s a little hard to tell, and\u2026.\u201d\u201cI-I understand, Hyung-nim.\u201dTo Park Deokgu, it wouldn\u2019t matter if I gave him a rough explanation.I thought it would be better not to talk about Jung Hayan\u2019s story if possible, and as I kept running, I saw some monsters rushing towards us.\u201cHyung-nim, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m out of mana.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t strain yourself.\u201dPark Deokgu pushed them away from our group as we ran so that we were able to escape.My lungs felt like they were going to burst.Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan were no different. We all looked exhausted.To be honest, I felt like I was going to pass out.Still, I knew I couldn\u2019t lose consciousness.I had to see this through to the end.Looking back with a slightly somber look on her face, Jung Hayan furtively spoke to me.\u201cA-as expected\u2026 Y-you\u2019re sad?\u201dHer expression was poor and held traces of anxiety.Of course, I knew the correct answer to that question well.\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt.\u201dThe corners of Jung Hayan\u2019s mouth rose at my words. She smiled widely.\u201cO-o-oppa.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re alright.\u201dI only half meant it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that Hyung-ssi, Kim Hyunsung, is safe.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201dOnce we had broken through the encirclement, Park Deokgu bluntly spat out his worries.He gave off a keen feeling of apprehension.Ever since he had been told directly that Park Hyaeyoung hadn\u2019t made it back, he seemed a bit restless.He looked worried about Kim Hyunsung, who had drawn all of those other monsters away on his own. Perhaps he thought Kim Hyunsung would meet the same fate as Park Hyaeyoung and wouldn\u2019t survive.However, it was hard to imagine Kim Hyunsung being cornered by monsters, no matter how outnumbered he was.When he was in action, it was hard enough just to follow him with your eyes, so it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to evade a bunch of monsters.There was a high probability that by now, he had escaped from that area and was worrying about the same things I was.One person ended up dead from a hunt which he had taken great pains to propose.Perhaps it would provide a convenient excuse for those in the shelter to curl up and hide a little bit longer.This expedition was one which should have been carried out without a hitch.Of course, Kim Hyunsung didn\u2019t know that Park Hyaeyoung was dead yet, but I thought that just the incident alone would be enough to cause a headache.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. I wasn\u2019t close to Park Hyaeyoung, but I think she was trying to do her best.\u201d\u201cShe almost got us killed, so if the worst that happens is her death, it can still be considered a success\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s true, but.\u201d\u201cYou should be grateful for the fact that we\u2019ve come out of this alive. It couldn\u2019t be helped. She was at fault for pulling aggro from you while she ran wild without listening to us, and it was her who screamed and brought every monster within earshot running. To put it bluntly, if you or Hayanie had died instead of her, I wouldn\u2019t have forgiven her.\u201dThat wouldn\u2019t have been something that I could stop at calling \u2018Unforgivable.\u2019I might have ended up wanting to kill her myself.Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan were a priceless pair.When I looked over, it wasn\u2019t only Jung Hayan, but also Park Deokgu, who was looking at me with a strange expression.Jung Hayan seemed moved, while Park Deokgu looked to be embarrassed.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, t-the same would be true for me.\u201dIt was Jung Hayan who had killed Park Hyaeyoung, but I didn\u2019t want to think about such things at the moment.With the exception of Kim Hyunsung, these were currently the two people I could rely on the most.Park Deokgu, a meat shield with high endurance and stamina, and Jung Hayan who had immeasurable potential.There was the downside that they were both too dependent on me, but in a way, that could also be said to be an advantage.The problem was that one of them was a ticking bomb that I couldn\u2019t control, but at the same time it was highly likely that her disposition would make her a powerhouse on my side.\u201cBy the way, how will you explain this to the people in the shelter?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t explain, and sleep. There was a mistake and one person died. That\u2019s all. If they\u2019re scared due to this\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019re scared?\u201d\u201cHowever much we might want to help, people will still die in the end. You have to remember that the fact is, right now, we\u2019re in the middle of the tutorial. We have to assume that the main game is several times more dangerous than anything we\u2019re going through now.\u201dSometimes, I forgot that what we were facing right now was a tutorial.Because of the tension that if something went wrong, we\u2019d croak.We had only just begun.One way or another, if Kim Hyunsung entered the main game, it might be teeming with weaklings, or there might be a lot of bastards who couldn\u2019t even be placed on the same level as the monsters we\u2019d been facing.\u2018We can\u2019t become complacent.\u2019If we became complacent like the people in the shelter, we would die.With the exception of Lee Jihye, who seemed to understand this fact, most of them were idiots.It was unsettling that not a single one of them could be useful.I couldn\u2019t understand why Kim Hyunsung was obsessed with those guys.I had thoughts that it might be related to his past life, but I couldn\u2019t afford to dig into his past now.\u201cWe\u2019ll sleep here tonight.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not returning to the shelter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too far.\u201d\u201cI thought we were almost there\u2026 Hng. I don\u2019t know how Hyung-nim can memorise the way so well.\u201d\u201cThis is pretty normal. I left a mark for us to spot when we started out.\u201d\u201cYou even left a mark?\u201d\u2018This son of a bitch\u2026.\u2019I hadn\u2019t expected Park Deokgu to use his brains to begin with, but at this rate, I was sure he was just a muscle head.I was so dumbfounded that it might have leaked into my expression, as Park Deokgu flinched and Jung Hayan hurriedly began to speak.\u201cHe-here.\u201dThere was a scratch which looked to have been made by a spear.A very small cut on the wall was clearly visible.\u201cNoonim knew too.\u201d\u201cYou need to pay better attention to your surroundings. What are you going to do if there\u2019s a situation where you and I are separated like earlier?\u201d\u201cHem. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen\u2026.\u201dIt was a bit disconcerting to see him always trailing off at the end of his sentences.I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he was flustered, but his eyes kept darting around to avoid mine. It was quite a spectacle to behold.It wasn\u2019t my intention to nag him there and then, so I followed suit and slumped to the ground, feeling drained.Jung Hayan clung to me like a cicada glued to an old tree.Park Deokgu\u2019s expression looked somewhat wicked.\u201cAhem\u2026. Then, I\u2019ll look around for a moment, Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cIs that necessary?\u201dIf possible, I hoped that Park Deokgu wouldn\u2019t leave his spot.\u201cWho knows if there are any of those monster bastards around here looking for us.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201cWell, Hyung-nim has used a lot of mana\u2026. Noonim, I think it might be better for you to take care of him a little\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh! L-leave it to me, Deokgu-ssi.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get lost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just be taking a look around.\u201dI nodded brusquely.Seeing him leave our current position quietly, I was mindful of the fact that I would be left alone with Jung Hayan.I knew she wasn\u2019t crazy enough to sling magic at me, but the scene I\u2019d witnessed earlier kept coming to mind.Jung Hayan\u2019s hysterical grin as Park Hyaeyoung writhed on the ground with her limbs cut off.There was no way I wouldn\u2019t feel scared.\u201cStatus window.\u201dWithout thinking too much, I summoned the status window, and naturally saw my information.[Checking the status window and talent levels of the player Lee Kiyoung.][Name: Lee Kiyoung][Title: None.

Nice boat [1].]I had opened Jung Hayan\u2019s status window, just in case, but I couldn\u2019t find anything vastly different from before.What caught my attention was that her mana level had risen by three. Her disposition as a Pure Advocate remained. If it said she was pure, then she was pure. I didn\u2019t have any complaints about that, but it would be nice if she could make it a bit more apparent.\u2018What the hell is this overview?\u2019For some reason, the words rang ominously in my ears.\u201cI-it\u2019s all thanks to O-o-oppa.\u201d\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t actually help you that much.\u201dI hadn\u2019t contributed much to her ability growth.When I laughed quietly, Jung Hayan also began to smile brightly.Her smile was a bit scary-looking, but I couldn\u2019t make that obvious.When I patted her head, she bowed her head slightly. Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s torn off limbs and her appearance as she smiled like a crazy bitch was no longer present.Once again, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that she liked me.At the moment, Jung Hayan was the person who concerned me the most.Because I needed to find a way to control this uncontrollable bomb.\u2018There are two options.\u2019Option one: Push her away very slowly.I didn\u2019t mean it in the sense of pushing her out of my reach.Rather, I would push for us to have an Oppa-and-Dongsaeng relationship, rather than one of lovers.This would reduce the intensity of affection to one between siblings instead of between men and women.It wouldn\u2019t magically get rid of her jealousy.In fact, it was the safest and most reasonable path.Option two: Quickly drag her to me.The second option was based on the affection between men and women.Not only believing, trusting, and following me, but further developing a relationship where she would unconditionally accept anything I said.It was a boatload of shit but it didn\u2019t seem impossible considering Jung Hayan\u2019s present state.Actually, what I had in mind was the first option.I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy, but there was still room for improvement in our relationship.As I stroked her head again, she gripped my hand on her head.Honestly, I was a bit taken aback.\u201cHum\u2026 Hum\u2026.\u201dPark Deokgu, who had gone out on patrol, had returned.\u201cOh, what a nice atmosphere.\u201d\u201cEh? Sorry? Ah\u2026 No. It\u2019s not that\u2026.\u201dJung Hayan was a bit too flustered.Park Deokgu spoke to Jung Hayan with the same shrewd smile as before.\u201cI thought I asked you to take care of Hyung-nim, but Noonim is a little sly, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s not like that.\u201dPark Deokgu snickered and smiled excessively while Jung Hayan rose from her seat and crept over to the corner.Seeing her appearance, Park Deokgu smiled widely and didn\u2019t hesitate to flop down right next to me.\u201cOh, did I come back too early?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about.\u201d\u201cWell, aren\u2019t things going well with Noonim?\u201dI had no idea what the hell he was talking about.Rather, come to think of it, he was 23 years old. Jung Hayan was 21 years old.I couldn\u2019t understand why he would call Jung Hayan \u2018Noonim\u2019.Anyone could see that Jung Hayan looked younger than Park Deokgu.\u201cYou know that Jung Hayan is younger than you, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. Even so, what kind of Dongsaeng would treat his Hyung\u2019s woman disrespectfully?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201dThe word \u2018bullshit\u2019 almost popped out of my mouth.Now that I thought about it, something was weird.What I wanted from Jung Hayan, in the first place, was a bond, not a love affair.It may be true that her environment had led her in a strange direction, but nevertheless, there was still a missing piece to the puzzle.I felt like the last piece had slotted into place.It was this.\u2018Shit\u2026.\u2019A cupid.\u201cDon\u2019t forget me if it goes well later. Actually, I didn\u2019t tell you, but since Hyung-nim asked me to take good care of Noonim, I\u2019ve been pushing her little by little.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 How can you\u2026.\u201d\u201cHem hem\u2026 You look good together and it looks like she likes Hyung-nim. You used to sneak peeks at Noonim. I\u2019ve seen something like this happen so many times, I can\u2019t remember\u2026Fufu\u2026. So you don\u2019t have to be too thankful\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI thought your taste was a bit unusual, but\u2026 Hem! If Hyung-nim says so, then it\u2019s only right for me, the dongsaeng to help! In my opinion, I think the goal is in sight. Actually, even though I look like this, everyone knows Park Deokgu, the love doctor in Gangwon-do.\u201dIgnorant of my feelings, the corners of Park Deokgu\u2019s mouth raised as he poured out his pride.I couldn\u2019t even speak because I was so flustered.I had no choice but to realise that it was meaningless to distinguish between the first and second option.\u2018Park Deokgu you pig bastard\u2026..\u2019An almost flawless checkmate.I couldn\u2019t think of anything to stop the designs of a pig, whose brain was full of nothing but muscles.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to Park Deokgu\u2019s designs, Jung Hayan would be repulsed just by me choosing the first option.Rather, no matter what my thoughts were on the matter originally, it was highly likely that Jung Hayan was sprinting towards the second option on her own.\u201cZzzzzzz.\u201dWhen I heard Park Deokgu snoring beside me, I felt myself growing increasingly upset.In the first place, there was no way I could even entertain the idea of dating here.In this kind of place, where no one knew when they would die, it was senseless to consider feelings of that nature.Getting into a relationship was a whole other can of worms.I wanted to wholeheartedly reject the notion of an intimate relationship with a woman who might one day decide to tear me apart, but\u2026\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019Ironically, the only way to avoid the ending where I was torn to death was to get closer to her.The most dangerous person was, at the same time, the most reliable person.I didn\u2019t enjoy gambling, but I was ready to throw the dice if necessary.I gave a brief nod to the reality I didn\u2019t want to acknowledge, and spoke to Park Deokgu who was still snoring away.\u201cGet up.\u201d\u201czzzzzzzzzz\u2026..\u201d\u201cWake up, Deokgu-yah.\u201d\u201cUnnnngh\u2026 What. Morning already?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re starting a bit early.\u201d\u201cHey, Noonim. Please wake up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt looks like she\u2019s fast asleep\u2026 Noonim, it\u2019s time to get up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026 It looks like Noonim has turned into Sleeping Beauty\u2026 Maybe she needs a kiss from her Prince Charming?\u201d\u2018Son of a bitch.\u2019He had taken on a teasing tone without knowing how I felt about it.I wanted to stuff his mouth with a fireball.Most of my mana had recovered just in time. I didn\u2019t know why but just hearing that throwaway line was enough to drive me up the wall.Still, I had to wake up Jung Hayan, so I had no choice but to take a slight step forward.\u201cHayan-ah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHayan-ah, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d\u201cUnngh\u2026..\u201dOnly when I patted her head lightly did she rise, blearily rubbing her eyes.It seemed she wasn\u2019t fully awake yet.Even though I could see her startle and become flustered after seeing me, I still felt an inexplicable, lingering fear when I looked at her.\u201cAh\u2026 Oh! Yes, Oppa.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to head back to the shelter as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have a light meal and get going.\u201d\u201cHem. Leave the arrangements to me.\u201dAfter a really simple meal, it didn\u2019t take long for us to get ready to move on.There\u2019s a saying that humans are adaptable creatures. Seeing everyone greet the morning in their own way, I could see that it was indeed the case.\u201cI don\u2019t know if that Hyung-ssi, Kim Hyunsung, and the shelter are okay. We\u2019ve been away for a while.\u201d\u201cThey should also be alright. So long as those guys don\u2019t pointlessly decide among themselves to go out to hunt.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it good if they can? We need more people to fight anyway\u2026.\u201dOf course, there was no reason to stop them if they could hunt properly.\u201cYou think those guys, who\u2019ve been hiding in fear all this time, would suddenly turn over a new leaf just because they\u2019ve had a change of heart? Not only is it unlikely that they would band together to hunt, even if they did go out, they would all wind up dead if they couldn\u2019t get it together and do it properly. In fact, that would be the better outcome.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying that we have to hope that things don\u2019t turn out the way they did with Park Hyaeyoung.\u201dThe probability that those in the shelter would go out hunting was low.However, if they did form a party of their own and leave to look for monsters by themselves, then there was another, even worse possibility that we had to consider.Of course, I couldn\u2019t claim that my judgment wasn\u2019t flawed but\u2026.\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that they panic, start screaming, and lead all the monsters to the shelter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe people in the shelter would be none the wiser to the impending danger. They would all be busy with their lives. Terrified humans can\u2019t make rational decisions\u2026 And, ultimately, they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop the horde of monsters storming in, the entrance would be breached, and that would be the end of the shelter.\u201d\u201cWell, just imagining it is horrible enough.\u201dIt really was horrific.\u201cThat\u2019s probably why Hyunsung-ssi ordered us to return separately from him. There may still be some monster bastards that are still after us.\u201d\u201cWell, the more I think about it, the more I think that Hyung-nim is really smart.\u201dI was never smart.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dIt was just that I was constantly thinking about worst-case scenarios and how to react to them.As my feet rose and fell unceasingly, I instinctively felt a rising sense of apprehension. Just imagining the situation I had just described really happening made my mouth go dry.To be honest, it wasn\u2019t that I cared about what happened to anyone in the shelter, but the loss of economic or natural resources there would be a waste.At best, it was a well-established place.Since we still didn\u2019t know how long clearing the dungeon would take, the shelter was still a necessity.My mind was occupied by various thoughts as we walked down the eerily quiet pathway.This kind of silence was a bit heavy, so I chatted with Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan and the shelter came into view not long after.Strangely enough, the entrance had been barricaded.Lee Jihye must have spotted us, as she emerged and began to clear away a heap of rubble.It must have been packed together tightly as it took a while before she was done. Lee Jihye approached us slowly, a customary smile on her face, and began to speak once she had drawn near.\u201cKiyoung oppa and Deokgu oppa are here? Hyaeyoung-ssi and Hyunsung-ssi\u2026.\u201d\u201cPark Hyaeyoung is dead and Hyunsung-ssi will be back soon.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dAfter hearing my calm response, Lee Jihye closed her eyes for a moment before nodding her head and continuing to speak.\u201cBy any chance\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. In the meantime, did you have any trouble at the shelter?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 May I speak with you in private?\u201dThat had to mean that she wanted to speak freely. .Lee Jihye\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look good. Something was going on.Why was it that bad feelings were never wrong?When I turned a little and glanced over at Park Deokgu, I saw that he was nodding as if it made no difference to him.In the first place, he would want to hear it from me later, so it didn\u2019t matter, but what concerned me was how Jung Hayan would respond.However, since it was also essential for me to hear what Lee Jihye had to say, I had no choice but to pat Jung Hayan on the head once and speak to her.\u201cDo you want to go inside first and wait? I\u2019ll be there in a bit.\u201d\u201cAh! Alright\u2026 Okay. Oppa.\u201dThis was just because I was worried that Lee Jihye would be torn limb from limb otherwise.For some reason, the way she kept glancing back at me over and over again as she went into the shelter made me remember Park Hyaeyoung.It was only when the two of them were no longer in sight that Lee Jihye slowly began to speak.\u201cHow did Park Hyaeyoung die?\u201d\u201cShe brought it on herself. Screaming in a place where there were a shit-ton of monsters. That\u2019s why Kim Hyunsung isn\u2019t with us right now\u2026 Want to know the details?\u201d\u201cNo, thank you. I can roughly imagine what happened.\u201dI noticed her glancing furtively at me. I didn\u2019t know if she was thinking about the way Jung Hayan had left, but I had the inexplicable feeling that she had a rough idea of what had happened.Of course, it was only a guess, but it meant that Lee Jihye caught on faster than I expected.\u201cI\u2019ll sum it up quickly.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYoo Seokwoo, as well as a few others, went outside.\u201d\u2018I knew things would turn out like this.\u2019\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cYesterday morning.\u201d\u201cYou.\u201d\u201cI know as well. I couldn\u2019t let them leave without permission.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Why.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, ever since Kiyoung oppa and Hyunsung oppa left together, they constantly told me that they wanted to go out to hunt. I don\u2019t know if he made up his mind after seeing Kiyoung oppa\u2019s magic, or if he had had enough of the situation he was in, but he left to go hunting with a few, like-minded men. Idiots\u2026. Of course, at first, I was able to convince them that it made more sense to go after Kiyoung oppa returned, but\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a powerless woman, aren\u2019t I?\u201dI now had a rough understanding of the situation.It seemed that my display of magic in front of them had adverse side effects.To begin with, Yoo Seokwoo was at a disadvantage after the trouble he had caused for Jung Hayan.It was no wonder, then, that he would consider his options given his status had dropped.Not only would he think about gaining incomprehensible powers, but he, himself, must have secretly thought about wanting to be like us.With the exception of Lee Jihye, who was considered to be a manager, the power of Kim Hyunsung, Park Deokgu, and myself, was absolute here.I sighed briefly before speaking again.\u201cWasn\u2019t it your job to prevent this?\u201d\u201cI tried my best to stop them. Kiyoung oppa\u2019s return was later than expected, so people got nervous\u2026 How could I refuse to let him go when he said they wanted to send a rescue team?\u201d\u201cRescue my ass\u2026 Usually, those shitheads wouldn\u2019t give a fuck\u2026. Is that why you barricaded the entrance?\u201d\u201cYes. We don\u2019t have to die together, do we?\u201dThat explained why the entrance was completely blocked off.If Yoo Seokwoo and the other self-proclaimed rescuers were pursued by monsters, they might have thought to ask the shelter for help.Seeing as she had blocked up the entrance and kept it shut tight, Lee Jihye also seemed to be thinking of protecting the shelter in her own way.\u201cI wish those stupid, trouble-making fuckers would just die\u2026 It seems like the wrong person died. What to do\u2026 People are definitely going to be scared\u2026. People who can fight, do you still need more of those?\u201d\u201cThe more the merrier.\u201dTo be honest, the one attacking the dungeon was not me, but Kim Hyunsung.The person who thought it feasible to fight and that we needed to bolster our forces was not me, but Kim Hyunsung.He seemed to believe that we had no choice but to expand our forces before progressing to the lower floors.\u201cWhat about you?\u201dEven though my Mind\u2019s Eye had evaluated Lee Jihye as trash, she was better than that bitch Park Hyaeyoung.I didn\u2019t think she would be stabbing her spear willy-nilly or that there would be any screaming halfway through.Rather, it was highly likely she would calmly do her job behind Park Deokgu\u2019s back.\u201cI would like to decline.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying and I don\u2019t want to get caught up in anything fruitless. The power that Kiyoung oppa has shown is definitely amazing\u2026 Of course it\u2019s desirable, but needless greed is a shortcut to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you think a baepsae can be like a stork? The baepsae will have its own baepsae way of life.\u201d [1]I think I knew what she meant.For some reason, Lee Jihye\u2019s story sounded just a bit like something that I could have written as well, and her thoughts were also reasonable.\u201cRather than living on the battlefield, where I wouldn\u2019t even know when I\u2019ll die\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be best to be with a capable man and live in peace?\u201dIt was while we were talking about one thing or another that I sensed the presence of someone else somewhere.I turned my head naturally and saw that several figures were coming towards us.\u2018Yoo Seokwoo?\u2019The one walking in front had to be Yoo Seokwoo.However, the three figures behind him were humans I had never seen in the shelter before.\u201cI guess the one guy who wanted to die the most came back alive. He even brought back baggage\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This person could be too dangerous for player Lee Kiyoung.]\u2018Battlemage?\u2019Just a glance at his abilities was enough to gain a rough understanding. His stats were perfectly balanced, and what stood out most was the existence of mana and his class.\u2018Mana?\u2019This was the first time I had seen someone who still had mana despite not being a Wizard, outside of Kim Hyunsung.My eyes were constantly drawn to the rare grade class, Battlemage.His mana stat was eight, even higher than mine.The mere fact that he had mana meant that he had the capacity to ascend to the ranks of the strong.The most noticeable piece of information was his disposition.Calculating killer.I had seen many dispositions thus far, but this was the first time I had seen such a disposition.The two guys next to him weren\u2019t much different. Their stats in themselves were only either better than mine or slightly below Park Deokgu\u2019s, but overall, their abilities weren\u2019t bad.These guys\u2019 dispositions also did not seem to be as positive as Well-Meaning Arbitrator or Pure Advocate.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to prepare to receive some guests. They look like people who are capable of fighting\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this will turn out well.\u201d\u201cGo inside and get Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cQuickly.\u201dInstead of responding to her question, I grimaced and immediately began to cast a spell.Thinking about what might happen, Lee Jihye\u2019s expression also hardened and she began to head into the shelter.I also backed up little by little.\u201cLord, answer, my, wish, my call, please give me, strength, to burn my enemies.\u201dThey didn\u2019t seem to have any particular animosity as of yet.For starters, it looked like they were at ease whilst walking towards us.Just as Jung Hayan possessed a disposition of Pure Advocate, there was a possibility that there was a discrepancy between their dispositions and actual behaviour. However, I thought it was better to be on guard for the time being.\u2018Shit.\u2019I had already built up a tower of mana and chanted the spell.In this case, all I had to do was say the spell, but I suppressed myself from saying it.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is Jung Jinho.\u201dIt was because he said hello from a distance. When I saw him take a step towards me, I took two steps back.\u2018Range.\u2019I was well-aware of just how fast someone whose agility level was in the 20s could move.In reality, even this distance was dangerous.The two people at Jung Jinho\u2019s side may not have noticed the mana I was restraining as much as possible, but Jung Jinho, who possessed mana, had to be aware that I was suppressing a spell at that moment.At his greeting, I responded while maintaining the distance between us.\u201cPleased to meet you. My name is Lee Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cAh! I\u2019ve heard a lot about you from Seokwoo-ssi.\u201d\u201cPardon me?\u201d\u201cI heard you became a Wizard this time. You made flames rise from your hands\u2026 I\u2019d really love to see that just once.\u201d\u2018Yoo Seokwoo, you douchebag. Useless son of a bitch.\u2019\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt really is amazing. I already knew that this place gave us new abilities, it\u2019s just\u2026 This is my first time seeing a wizard\u2026 Ah! You don\u2019t have to be so wary.\u201dIt was a strange situation where one wrong move could land me dead. It would be more strange if I wasn\u2019t on my guard.The sword, spear, and bow they were carrying agitated me.When I snuck a look at Yoo Seokwoo , he had a slightly nervous expression on his face.I didn\u2019t know the cause behind his nervousness, but I thought it couldn\u2019t be a positive sign.\u201cReally, this place is amazing. I had heard that there were a lot of survivors remaining, but I didn\u2019t believe it. If it\u2019s a place like this, it makes sense that over 30 people could survive together.\u201d\u201cI was also very surprised when I first saw this place. It\u2019s all thanks to Hyunsung-ssi. How did you\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh. Actually, I found Seokwoo-ssi along with a few other people surrounded by monsters nearby. Unfortunately, I discovered them too late to save the rest of them, but\u2026 Somehow I was able to save Seokwoo-ssi. It was good fortune.\u201dWhen I looked at Yoo Seokwoo once again, that punk\u2019s nodding face came into view.\u2018Really\u2026.\u2019Out of everyone he could have brought back, the fact that he had brought these bastards was almost embarrassing.There was an ominous feeling emanating just from his person alone.That kind of ominousness was in this guy.Perhaps it was an effect of the luck stat. My senses were screaming at me to not get close to him.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Actually, I was extremely worried when I heard that Seokwoo-ssi had left to go hunting. The rest of them\u2026 It can\u2019t be helped\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf I had found them a little earlier, I could have saved them all\u2026 It really is such a shame.\u201dWhile I was glancing around restlessly, I could sense Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu coming out.\u201cWhat happened? Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re newcomers.\u201dOnly then did I relax a little. The way this guy looked, emerging with a heavy shield, was definitely a menacing sight for others.Of course, that was without even mentioning his stats. I thought that even Jung Jinho might not be able to overcome his endurance and vitality levels.Lee Jihye\u2019s profile, as she made a statement of siding with me, clad in shoddy leather armour and showing hostility to the three men before us, was quite reliable.Jung Hayan was also muttering something with her head lowered.I couldn\u2019t feel any significant amount of mana yet, but she had to have been preparing herself for whatever happened.\u201cI thought we\u2019d be welcomed\u2026 This is a little unexpected.\u201dIt was then that I realised I was making it too obvious that I had my guard up.\u201cMy apologies. Given the circumstances\u2026 Even without realising it, I can\u2019t help but be wary of those I meet for the first time. If I was rude\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Kiyoung-ssi. I completely understand. We have also been attacked by people looking for food.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a group of bad guys moving around this area. We just barely managed to get away from them, but I don\u2019t think the same was true for their other victims. I spotted many murdered women on the way here.\u201dI wanted to ask if these guys had been the ones responsible.My attribute didn\u2019t tell lies.I didn\u2019t know whether this guy really had blood on his hands, but there was definitely a possibility that Jung Jinho would cause trouble somehow.To claim that a normal person could have a disposition like Calculating Killer was incomprehensible.\u201cIt really was a terrible sight. The corpses were already half-eaten by monsters, so I couldn\u2019t check them properly, but I could see marks that were made by humans, not monsters, all over the bodies. There\u2019s no doubt that they were knife-wounds.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. There were also traces that arrows had been lodged in the back, perhaps while they were trying to escape. There were signs of resistance\u2026. One of the bad guys had to have been an archer. There were also stab wounds, possibly from a sword\u2026 It\u2019s probably fair to say that one of them was carrying a sword. By any chance, have you seen anyone matching this description?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe guy quietly holding a bow next to him was, naturally, in my line of vision.I couldn\u2019t grasp his intention in making that remark. However, one thing for sure was that a strange tension was forming.\u2018Are you picking a fight with me?\u2019I wondered if he really wanted to start a fight.Park Deokgu must have seen my expression, as he also stealthily took up his shield and moved forward.I moved aside to let him go in front of Jung Hayan and I.I wondered if he couldn\u2019t see Park Deokgu.Maybe this guy\u2026.\u2018Are you confident?\u2019It was highly likely.Perhaps it was nothing but a figment of imagination, but it definitely felt like his target was me.The way Jung Jinho\u2019s arm kept moving to his waist bothered me. Park Deokgu was probably also paying attention to that guy\u2019s arm.\u201cPerhaps they\u2019re active in an area where Kiyoung-ssi\u2019s men don\u2019t frequent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. I\u2019ve never heard stories about those kinds of people, nor seen any signs of them.\u201dAt that moment, he was touching his waist, and his arm moved towards the handle of his sword.I spat out the spell right away.Rather, to be exact, I almost spilled out the whole spell.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s voice was the only thing that stopped me from summoning a fireball.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThat guy\u2019s hand, which had stealthily been heading towards the handle of his sword, moved to the side.It was quite a spectacle to see him wipe his hands on his pants then approach me with his hand outstretched for a handshake.I wasn\u2019t sure if this had been his intention from the start, but it was certainly true that Kim Hyunsung\u2019s appearance had changed the mood somewhat.I cancelled the spell I had been preparing, then clasped that guy\u2019s hand.\u201cRegardless, it was a pleasure to meet you, Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cThe pleasure was all mine. Jinho-ssi.\u201dI turned my head slightly and saw Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face as he came towards us.He must have had a hard time during the past few days, but he didn\u2019t look very tired.I could see his eyes trained on all of the people who had come with Yoo Seokwoo with an indifferent expression.\u201cIt seems nothing happened. It\u2019s a long story. Seokwoo-ssi brought these\u2026.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Jung Jinho.\u201dIt was then that I thought that the look on his face seemed off.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expression as he looked at Jung Jinho was a bit stiff.I had a strange sense of deja-vu. His expression was a bit different, but it was similar to the time when he had met Jung Hayan.\u2018Do you know him?\u2019Kim Hyunsung might know the Jung Jinho of the future.Of course, I had no way to confirm this, but the rigidity of his expression and the anger in his eyes gave me a bit more certainty.Even his body was shaking.\u2018Kim Hyunsung\u2026 Why\u2019s he acting like this?\u2019He looked a little different from the Kim Hyunsung I knew.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My name is Kim Hyunsung.\u201dThe scene of Jung Jinho and Kim Hyunsung shaking hands slightly came into view.For some reason, that clenched fist kept catching my eyes.\u2018Killer\u2026 He\u2019s a killer\u2026.\u2019Jung Jinho\u2019s disposition, Calculating Killer.The delicate confrontation that had taken place before Kim Hyunsung arrived.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s reaction to Jung Jinho.I could make several guesses.They were inferences that could be formed based on the presumption that Jung Jinho was a psychotic killer.The first possibility was that Jung Jinho killed Kim Hyunsung or those close to Kim Hyunsung.The second possibility was that he had never directly encountered Jung Jinho, but he had heard rumours or stories about him.The probability of the first idea having happened was relatively low. If Kim Hyunsung could show such self-control in the face of someone who killed him or his friends, I wouldn\u2019t call him a pushover, I\u2019d call him a saint.By my standards, even now, he was close to a saint, but that wasn\u2019t relevant to the current situation.Perhaps he was conscious of the eyes of myself, Park Deokgu, Jung Hayan, and the others inside.If he was indeed conscious of us onlookers, then he might have already torn Jung Jinho into shreds dozens of times in his mind.That\u2019s what I would have done in his shoes.\u201cLet me introduce myself once more. I\u2019m Jung Jinho. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you from Seokwoo-ssi. You\u2019re the one in charge of the shelter\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe just happened to come across survivors, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cI heard you\u2019re working hard on continuing rescue efforts.\u201d\u201cAh. Yes\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou really are incredible. Seokwoo-ssi has been telling us over and over again that you\u2019re a powerful man, but\u2026 Really\u2026 It seems that you\u2019re stronger than I thought. By any chance, may I ask what your stats are?\u201dYoo Seokwoo, that worthless punk, there wasn\u2019t a single thing he left unsaid.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say.\u201d\u201cAh! Of course, you don\u2019t have to tell me if it\u2019s inconvenient. We\u2019re a little further off from the starting point. We couldn\u2019t find any survivors, so we\u2019ve been wandering around, and stumbled upon Seokwoo-ssi.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Speaking of which, I mentioned it to Kiyoung-ssi not long ago, but I never imagined that there would be so many people alive here.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s expression remained unruffled.There was no vigilance or animosity. It was his normal expression.It might have been because he had already experienced this shit once so he was used to hiding his own feelings, but Kim Hyunsung was calmer than I had expected.I really wasn\u2019t sure why he was taking care of people around him like a pushover, but perhaps some unknown past was weighing him down by the ankles.I needed to reconsider the idea that the first possibility was relatively less likely.Kim Hyunsung was more used to controlling his emotions than I had thought. Nevertheless, I personally wanted to rate the possibility of the second inference higher.\u2018Rumours or stories about Jung Jinho.\u2019Jung Jinho\u2019s potential was capable of going through the roof.To use a gaming analogy, it was as though the foundation for a ranker had already been laid down.My Mind\u2019s Eye also believed that this guy had a high chance for growth.Considering this fellow\u2019s disposition, there was a high chance of him becoming a famous murderer or criminal in the future.He would have stirred up quite the storm.The second reason was that Kim Hyunsung, who would also play a large role in the future, had, to some extent, heard about or seen Jung Jinho, who would become a famous criminal in the future.Of course, there was a possibility that those roles were actually flipped, but given their dispositions, I thought the probability of that was weak.It was hard to picture Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face enjoying murder.\u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, would you mind if we stayed here as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe have some food supplies. If we shared with everyone, it might last for a few days. Of course, if Hyunsung-ssi doesn\u2019t like it\u2026.\u201dThere was a moment of deliberation.However, Kim Hyunsung soon nodded.\u201cNo. Survivors are always welcome. I\u2019ll help guide you separately.\u201d\u201cAh. Thank you.\u201dI thought it was an unexpected decision.\u201cDeokgu-yah, you and Jihye-ssi will guide these people\u2026.\u201d\u201cHyung-nim. Is that okay? We just\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Deokgu-yah. Call me right away if anything happens.\u201d\u201cUm. If Hyung-nim says so\u2026. Follow me. It\u2019s not the most comfortable place, but it\u2019s better than roaming around out there.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s decision was both unexpected but reasonable.Kim Hyunsung also knew that it was best to keep your enemies close.I also wanted to give him a welcome in part.If he were simply a lunatic psycho, it would be better to not let him in, but considering the way he had tucked his tail between his legs after seeing Kim Hyunsung, Jung Jinho was also the type of guy who knew how to pick his battles.Instead, he was a bit crafty.The ominous or vaguely unsettling atmosphere I had felt around this bastard earlier had already vanished.He had judged that there was no chance of winning with Kim Hyunsung present, and took a step back. Perhaps he didn\u2019t have any intention of attacking Park Deokgu and I at first, but the anxiety I felt before Kim Hyunsung came was real.\u2018Thanks,\u2019Nevertheless, I was very grateful towards him.The corners of my mouth lifted automatically and formed a faint smile.If this fucker was calculating, then somehow or another, I could use him.\u2018It\u2019s advantageous. This situation can definitely be exploited.\u2019It was a little out of the blue, but it wasn\u2019t a bad thing. Rather, the luckiest person on Earth might\u2019ve been me.All thoughts of killing him had already vanished from my head.\u2018Thanks, Jung Jinho, you motherfucker.\u2019In a way, that guy showing up here was a huge stroke of luck for me.When I turned my head slightly, Kim Hyunsung came into view.This guy\u2019s expression looked a bit dazed.\u201cLet\u2019s go in together, Hyunsung-ssi.\u201d\u201cI might be outside for a while longer. You can head in first.\u201dHe seemed to be preoccupied with his thoughts.The same was true for me.However, right now, I needed to keep my conversation with this guy going.That would be more effective.\u201cDid you know that person?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just asking because for some reason or other, the look on your face makes it seem like you do.\u201dHis expression was a bit concerned but he soon nodded and continued to speak.\u201cA little\u2026 You\u2019re correct to think that I know him. I\u2019d bet that he probably doesn\u2019t know me. I only had a brief brush with him once, a very long time ago.\u201d\u201cAh, you have that kind of relationship.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with fate. That one encounter was literally all I\u2019ve seen of him. To Jung Jinho-ssi\u2026.\u201d[1]\u201cYeah, I won\u2019t mention it.\u201d[2]The most important thing when counselling was to keep things confidential.I spoke again with an indifferent expression on my face.It had seemed in the beginning to also be in formal speech.At my words, perhaps that guy realised I had also been impolite[3], so I hurried to continue speaking. My mind that had run away from me returned as I came back to my senses.\u201cI had thought you would be fine, but you really came back. It really is incredible.\u201d [4]\u201cNo. I was lucky. It was a bit tough but\u2026 I was able to come back because I detoured as much as possible. Come to think of it, it\u2019s a relief that Kiyoung-ssi was also fortunate. Did you have any trouble returning here?\u201d\u201cActually, there\u2019s something I would like to talk about with you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHyaeyoung-ssi is dead.\u201dIf I was going to get hit anyway, it was better to strike first.Rather, in the present situation, it was most reasonable to bring up the problem of Jung Jinho that had forced my brain to work in overdrive.His face looked a bit shocked, but this fucker was used to people dying, so he nodded slowly.Fortunately, he didn\u2019t show any signs that he was suspicious of me.Kim Hyunsung hadn\u2019t checked Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s body, so he couldn\u2019t have known if there were any issues before.\u201cI see. How\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was magic.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cIt was an unknown magic.\u201d\u201cIt was magic?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI then said, \u201cIt\u2019s likely the case. My level is still low, so I can\u2019t judge precisely what it was, but it was definitely magic. I don\u2019t know whether there was any residual mana left but\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhile Deokgu and I were hurrying back, I noticed that Hayan-ssi and Hyeayoung-ssi had been separated from us. In that situation, I was concentrating on casting a spell, so I wasn\u2019t able to keep track of what was going on around me. At the time, maintaining the spell I had cast was my limit\u2026.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI arrived too late, and found Hyaeyoung-ssi dying with her limbs cut off. It felt as though there was something magical in the area and\u2026 I was somehow able to find Hayanie nearby\u2026 She didn\u2019t seem to know the details.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying her limbs were cut off?\u201d\u201cYes. She had been dismembered. I\u2019m thinking it was a dungeon trap that did it, it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201dThere hadn;t been anything like a trap.The guy who was well-aware of that mused over my words once again.\u201cA trap\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes. Honestly speaking, I wanted to bring Hyaeyoung-ssi\u2019s body with us, but we didn\u2019t even have time to think. Rather than letting her be eaten by monsters, I thought it was better to burn it. So\u2026.\u201dHe should understand what I was talking about.I had burned Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s body.\u201cAh. I see. It must have been difficult.\u201dIt was best to speak as sincerely as possible.Things had changed from the day before.Rather than our gentle, well-behaved, and meek Jung Hayan, a better suspect had appeared.I murmured once again in my mind.\u2018Thanks, Battlemage Jung Jinho.\u2019The criminal had been decided.Psychotic killer Jung Jinho, this bastard would be the culprit.1 For this exchange to make sense, you need to know that the Korean language uses several different ways of speaking, which vary in levels of politeness and formality. The first sentence Kim Hyunsung uses here is in very formal and polite speech, used between people you\u2019re not familiar with such as colleagues, and is the normal way he speaks with Lee Kiyoung. However, the second sentence uses polite but less formal speech.Using that form is not in itself a disrespectful thing \u2013 Park Deokgu, Lee Jihye and Jung Hayan use this form (Haeyoche) when speaking with Lee Kiyoung and it\u2019s completely normal. Haeyoche is also a common way of speaking between strangers. However, Kim Hyunsung and Lee Kiyoung aren\u2019t that close and . they\u2019ve been using the more formal level all this time so a sudden change is a bit disrespectful.If you want to know more about Korean forms of speech, here\u2019s a handy link. [return to text]2 Lee Kiyoung matches Kim Hyunsung\u2019s speech and slips into informal language. [return to text]3 Again, Lee Kiyoung refers to the change in speech. [return to text]4 Lee Kiyoung basically does the opposite of what Kim Hyunsung did earlier, using polite+informal speech in the first sentence, then polite+formal in the second. Both of them use this speech level for the rest of their conversation. [return to text]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was enough to be consistent with my attitude for now and let Jinho fall into a trap.\u2018That will be good for all of us.\u2019Hyunsung was a reasonable partner who would rather doubt Jinho than to doubt me in such circumstances. The mischief he would inevitably do in the future would also help Kim Hyunsung reach a logical conclusion about him.As time passed, Kim Hyunsung often spent time alone, constantly observing and checking.He watched Jung Jinho carefully and sometimes even observed me quietly. I thought I knew what he was thinking as he did so.Whenever he wore a cold expression, I thought Kim Hyunsung was thinking about how to kill Jung Jinho.\u2018He is the enemy of the future, the calculating killer, the murderer who killed Park Hyaeyoung.\u2019There was no single reason for Kim Hyunsung to remove Jinho from the shelter immediately. No matter how much Buddha-level compassion he had for others, he definitely wanted to get rid of what would surely become an enemy in the future.But how could he get rid of this problem?From Kim Hyunsung\u2019s point of view, he would love to deal with him as quickly as possible, but he still had many other things to worry about. It seemed difficult to find the right opportunity, and there were many things to consider before that.For example, one of them was the problem of proceeding down the dungeon.\u201cHow about we go down together to lower levels?\u201d\u201cTogether\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d\u201cYes, Hyunsung-ssi. Jung Hayan is about to finish her training as a Wizard\u2026 Jinho has also joined us so I think there will be enough people to lead an attack. Seokwoo seems to have found a class too\u2026 I would also want to advance a little more slowly and cautiously, but I think the time has come to make a choice as food is running out. Our purpose to train others was to attack the monsters on the lower levels.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t always live here. Even if I\u2019m anxious, I think we should try.\u201dIt looked like his head hurt a little when I proposed this.We had no choice but to attack the dungeon with a party that was destined to be divided up in the future. In fact, I had to lay down the scene before him, and it was for Kim Hyunsung to decide.He had to decide whether he was confident enough to break through the lower levels of the dungeon with them and then also take responsibility for what happened afterward.If Kim Hyunsung himself was confident, the situation would eventually turn out in their favor no matter what happened.\u2018We could lead an attack on the dungeon along with the death of the murderer who had killed Park Hyaeyoung.\u2019In other words, we would be able to use Jung Jinho up to the marrow of his bones.If he was going to be killed anyway, it was better to use him to the fullest.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to go hunting again with the new people who joined recently. We don\u2019t know when something like what happened with Park Hyaeyoung would happen again\u2026 Yet I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to go out once and scavenge the area for supplies, rather than to just wait like this. Both food and drinking water are scarce right now. If we choose to settle down without venturing further, we will all eventually die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKim Hyunsung was quite cautious.It seemed that he had guessed it was a little too dangerous to act on such a plan, after seeing Jinho appear out of nowhere like that. Maybe he thought it was impossible to deal with Jung Jinho while he was with us.When I was about to fan the flames again, Kim Hyunsung slowly replied.\u201cI think it will be okay for us to go out once again.\u201d\u201cYou do?\u201d\u201cYes I do. Let\u2019s go down to the lower levels of the dungeon. You probably still have a little time to prepare. We haven\u2019t worked together with Jung Jinho\u2019s party yet, so it would be better for both the parties to practice a little with each other.\u201d\u201cYeah. I think so, too.\u201dI would hate to let my guard down before a killer. It was the same for Kim Hyunsung.\u201cI will call Jinho, Hayan and Deokgu and then talk to them together about it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cOn second thought, would you please go ahead and inform Hayan and Deokgu about this instead of me?\u201d\u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d I really wanted to tell them about this as soon as possible. I thought that this might be some pretty good news, so I had volunteered to tell them about this myself.As I hurried over to them, I started noticing the beautiful scenery around me. Then I saw a very heartwarming sight I had not seen in the shelter recently.\u201cThank you, Jinho-ssi.\u201d\u201cThank you, Jinho Oppa.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me. We all have to help each other in order to survive and live on.\u201dJung Jinho was trying to build good connections with the weaker people.But all of this was going to be meaningless. He was trying to win them over with his totally pointless mind games.\u201cIf you ever need help with something, you can always tell me.\u201d\u201cWe have to usually go out and search for food, but we have all this food now which you have given us. Jinho Oppa, please take a break. Until then we\u2019ll distribute the food among the others.\u201d\u201cLet me help you too. It\u2019s not a very difficult task, and wouldn\u2019t it be better for everyone to live under a sense of sacrifice and brotherhood too.\u201d\u2018That sounded funny.\u2019I couldn\u2019t hold back my laughter as his words.\u2018These stupid people\u2026\u2019In this world, no one did any favors for free. There was always a price.Perhaps Kim Hyunsung also helped these people because of feelings of sympathy and self-satisfaction that he felt afterward.As far as Kim Hyunsung was concerned, the situation in the shelter was not that bad.However, in my view, what Jung Jinho really wanted, in reality, were the lives and necks of those who were laughing and talking with him right now.But thanks to him, the evil gazes that Park Deokgu and I were attracting since we expressed our intention to move independently had now become even more explicit.The people were starting to compare us with Jung Jinho.\u2018Who do you even think you are?\u2019I assumed that was what they were thinking about us currently.Jung Jinho not only shared the food he had brought with himself but also did even the smallest of chores. He was different from us, who kept our share of food to ourselves. It was not unreasonable for them to compare him with us.Me, Park Deokgu, and Jung Hayan seemed to be becoming increasingly selfish and worse in their hearts, but I thought there was no need to start imitating the hypocrite Jinho.The power to direct and control the people didn\u2019t come from acting helpful in front of these weaklings.Authority wasn\u2019t proportional to closeness. That was what drove these kinds of people.Actually, It might not just be some meaningless acting on his behalf after all. Nevertheless, it was difficult to understand what he was aiming for while looking at his actions.I was worried about whether I had gone ahead and sprinkled red pepper powder on the psychopath killer Jung Jinho that had angered him in the beginning, as it was also possible that he hadn\u2019t even committed a crime. Perhaps he was trying to live as peacefully as possible while suppressing his original disposition.However, the dice had already been thrown.\u201cLet\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cAh! Seokwoo Oppa, thank you.\u201dYoo Seokwoo, who had recently been triumphant in finding a class while traveling with them, also came into view. It looked like he had decided to hang out with Jung Jinho\u2019s party. Sometimes he looked very anxious, but he got what he wanted anyway. And now he had a good place within this humble shelter.I had no choice but to turn my gaze away from these people who did not realize the true value of hard work.I didn\u2019t want to keep looking at the heartwarming scene, which was a curse in disguise.As I walked a little more, I saw Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu together.\u201cHayan-ssi.\u201d\u201cOh, Oppa.\u201dWhen I went nearer, Jung Hayan, who was testing a simple magic spell, ran over without hesitation and grabbed onto my sleeve tightly.Park Deokgu was smiling when he saw this.\u2018Well\u2026\u2019\u201cAre we going outside then Oppa?\u201d\u201cWhat? Yeah, maybe\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dWe hadn\u2019t been dating and didn\u2019t even have such a relationship yet, but the people in the shelter seemed to have already accepted the relation between Jung Hayan and I as an established fact.Whether she was aware of it or not, Jung Hayan had been holding my hands and getting closer to me more frequently.I felt encouraged when these friends of mine didn\u2019t show much rejection, unlike the other people of the shelter. Of course, I still had problems because of her when everyone else was sleeping.My heart started beating fiercely every time I woke up from my sleep in a surprised state because Hayan was getting bolder with her actions.If it wasn\u2019t for Park Deokgu, we would have been even closer than we were before.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were going to meet Kim Hyunsung-ssi? I think you came back a little early\u2026 Did the story work well?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve just come back from meeting him. It seems like we have something on our hands\u2026 Is there time?\u201d\u201cThere is still some time remaining, Oppa.\u201d\u201cCan I ask what\u2019s going on, Hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cOf course, I think we\u2019re going to go to the next levels of the dungeon sooner or later.\u201d\u201cWe are finally going down?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know much for now, but I think more people will follow Jinho.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 They won\u2019t appreciate him for very long\u2026\u201d\u201cI think so too. Still, we can\u2019t help it because it\u2019s important to attack together, immediately. Hyunsung-ssi has also realized the importance of this strike.\u201d\u201cBy the way, can we even succeed in attacking this dungeon, Hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cWe have a good chance in surviving. I think so, yeah.\u201dKim Hyunsung believed that we could certainly attack this place.\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you, as you already know, that it would be better to keep a distance from the group of people who follow Jung Jinho. Of course, on the outside you can appear to be cordial with them\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t worry too much about us, Hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for Hayan.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand, Oppa\u2026 I won\u2019t be tricked by him.\u201dThat sounded hilarious. She was definitely going to be tricked by him in one way or another.Park Deokgu was a little better, but in the case of Jung Hayan, one never knew when she would explode since she was like a ticking bomb. Therefore, she needed continuous careful management and mental grooming.If she again acted unexpectedly like in the situation with Park Hyaeyoung, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything this time.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about Yoo Seokwoo.\u201d\u201cOh God, I don\u2019t care about him, even a little.\u201d\u201cIf so, then that\u2019s good, Hyung-nim.\u201dWith Park Deokgu at the lead, I slowly walked down a path, and once again, my gaze fell upon the group huddled around Jinho. I was dumbstruck.People who were doing nothing other than hogging onto free food that Jung Jinho had brought were looking at us with strange expressions.I thought I was going to be overwhelmed.I just had to act casual in front of them.It wasn\u2019t that anything had happened yet. I was just going to have another meeting with Kim Hyunsung.After ignoring their gazes, I started heading to the place where Kim Hyunsung was. Before long, I could see his figure taking something out of his bag.My mood elevated. The empty equipment window that I was always concerned about whenever I looked at my status window was finally going to be filled with something.I imagined that one day I would be able to see or wear some equipment with various stats and other items, but the opportunity had emerged far soon than I had expected.All of us definitely required an upgrade before going underground.Kim Hyunsung was handling them just to relieve his own anxiety. It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t giving them out to us just for the dungeon attack, but also to win against Jung Jinho if they faced them.Kim Hyunsung was trying to raise our strengths in order to prepare for any accident beyond our anticipations.\u201cI have something to give you.\u201d\u201cWere you hiding these from us, Hyung-ssi? Your expression is like a grandmother who is giving out some old toys.\u201d\u2018This pig\u2026\u2019Even if I wanted to shout out aloud, I knew I could not do that. Kim Hyunsung was also a little embarrassed. He replied with a good-natured smile.\u201cThese are helping items.\u201dOf that, I was sure.The edge of my lips curled into a little smile. It was not an item like a common sword, spear, or a shield.What he took out of his bag were a bracelet and two rings. They looked crude, but I felt mysterious magic emanating from them.\u2018Thank you, Hyunsung-ssi. These would be phenomenal.\u2019I thought there would be some insurance going underground with him, but it turned out to be much better than I had thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some of them are pretty useful.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you anything before, but in fact, right after the incident, I accidentally found a box.\u201d\u201cBox?\u201d\u201cIt would be appropriate to call it a treasure chest. It was like a wooden box that people used in the past.\u201d\u201cOh, it looks like they\u2019re really special Hyung-nim, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dThe authenticity of such a claim could not be verified, but since they were in a dungeon, there was a high possibility of a treasure chest containing such items here.Personally, I was thinking of the possibility of whether these were items that Kim Hyunsung owned personally, but I found no valid reason for him to share his own things with us.What items Kim Hyunsung currently had and what we could get from him were what really mattered right now.\u201cThis is amazing. If there are more such boxes around here, I would love to find them\u2026 Perhaps the number of chests spread throughout the dungeon is limited and the box that Hyunsung found could be the first and last of its kind. But, who knows? There can also be similar things underground\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right, Kiyoung-ssi. I had already searched around there, but this was the first time that I found a box. I couldn\u2019t search any further, but\u2026 Anyway, let\u2019s take a look at these.\u201d\u201cYeah, sure.\u201dI was definitely going to see what we had on our hands.There was no need for me to trigger the Mind\u2019s Eye. As soon as I lifted them up with my hand, information about them poured into my mind.It would have been nice if I could check the items\u2019 detailed stats, but I sighed in regret when I went through them.[Iron Dwarf\u2019s Steel Bracelet \u2013 Common Grade][This is a trinket made by the fallen iron dwarf race. Unlike its crude appearance, it is a bracelet with very technical work done on it. When it is worn, the stamina, endurance, and strength increases by 1 point each.]The owner of the bracelet had already been decided. It seemed that Park Deokgu was the right wielder for this.The total number of stats that were raised by this item was 3. It was almost equal to the stats you got when you acquired a class.This was a normal grade item.Then a thought came to my mind. Maybe heroic and legendary equipment that was even better than this would have features that I could not even begin to imagine.\u201cOh, oh\u2026\u201dMy expression was the one someone would make when receiving money from their grandmother.The problem was what came right after this.[Magic Shield Ring \u2013 Rare Grade][It cannot be confirmed where it was made. This item is ancient. It is an accessory that can be used to create a magic shield by storing magic power in the ring twice a day. You must recharge its power yourself. (2/2)][Sacred Healing \u2013 Rare Grade][It can not be confirmed where it was made. This is a ring that contains divine magic powers and healing abilities on a smaller scale. It can be used once a day. (1/1)]The other two items were Rare-Grade rings.As soon as I checked them, my eyes widened unexpectedly.\u2018I love this.\u2019I thought that by following Kim Hyunsung, I would be able to get some bean sprouts, but I couldn\u2019t even imagine that I would get to eat a whole feast instead.These were Rare-Grade rings!I was also surprised by their functions that seemed excellent.They didn\u2019t raise the stats directly like Park Deokgu\u2019s item, but these items were much more valuable than his.For example, assuming that the magical power consumed to memorize the magical shield ring\u2019s spell and form the shield was about 4, this item gave an efficiency of +8 to the stats. They could not be compared with any ordinary Common grade item that had an efficiency of +3.\u2018I\u2019m in luck.\u2019The same was true for divine healing.Seeing that the item was Rare grade, this item would also have at least +6 stat efficiency. They had the ability to protect yourself with a shield twice a day and also cure wounds, which served as insurance.When Kim Hyunsung chose to go down to the dungeon, he made sure he was well-prepared for any and all unforeseen circumstances.\u2018Preparing for everything beforehand is a smart move.\u2019As I was nodding my head, Park Deokgu slowly touched the bracelet.\u201cI think it\u2019s too precious\u2026 Can I really have it?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cGreat\u2026 Well, then, the bracelet is mine. Thank you, Hyung-ssi. I haven\u2019t done much around here, and I\u2019m sorry for that\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d\u201cNo. I should repay you.\u201d\u201cAlright, then thank you in advance.\u201dThe owner of the bracelet had been decided, but the problem was with the other two rings.In fact, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea to have any one of these rings, but if I had to choose between them, then self-protection obviously came first.If Hayan wore the divine healing item, there was a high probability that she would be able to use the divine magic inside properly.\u2018I sure can\u2019t use it.\u2019I felt like totally useless trash, but I couldn\u2019t help it.Unlike her, who could use various magic types, I usually got exhausted just by using the same spell twice.When I was struggling with these thoughts inside my head, it was Hayan who spoke first.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take this then.\u201dWhat she chose was the divine healing item.I didn\u2019t know if she noticed my reaction, but she definitely did what I intended for her to do.\u201cThen I will take the item that is left.\u201d The corner of my mouth rose up into a smile. I couldn\u2019t get in a bad mood after being blessed in such a way.I had obtained a life-saving trump card that could be used twice a day. Without making any effort or taking any risks, I acquired an item of the Rare grade.\u2018This is awesome!\u2019\u201cBut can we really accept something like this\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I also have one\u2026 In the case of accessories with special stats, it seems that the amount of items you can equip is limited. If it could be helped, then of course I would have worn more of them, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201dThat was useful information.\u201cDo you mean to say that the ability of only one ring can be activated at a time, even if I wore two rings?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dI thought I needed to experiment with this later.I then smiled a little and expressed my gratitude again.\u201cThank you so much, Hyunsung-ssi. As Deokgu said, we haven\u2019t done anything to deserve this\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, thank you\u2026Hyunsung-ssi.\u201d\u201cNo, no. You don\u2019t have to thank me Kiyoung-ssi and Hayan-ssi as we are friends after all.\u201d He was wearing a big smile.Perhaps he thought that he had indebted us all in a way. He seemed really convinced of that, after seeing the expressions on mine, Park Deokgu\u2019s and Jung Hayan\u2019s faces as we all looked at him gratefully.He seemed to think that he could have faith in us and trust us totally. Sensing that, I was a little relieved. In fact, it really helped boost my confidence.\u2018We\u2019re going to go together underground.\u2019Because we were friends.Kim Hyunsung was planning to go with me, Park Deokgu and Jung Ha-yan. In the case of Jung Hayan, she was a talent that Kim Hyunsung wanted to win over to his own side the most.She was a wizard whose future was already known to him. It could be said that any effort put into winning her confidence was worthwhile.Then there was Park Deokgu. He wasn\u2019t that bad either.As was the case in almost every game, a strong tanker was always helpful.The judgment, stability, and ability potential that had been shown by him in hunting so far could be said to be lower compared to those of Jung Hayan or Jung Jinho, but his current stats were still very good.Park Deokgu\u2019s growth limit could easily be surpassed by real fighters such as Kim Hyunsung, Jung Jinho, and Jung Hayan, yet he was still quite good enough.The only oddball around was me.It could even be said that I had entered Kim Hyunsung\u2019s group by mistake.Kim Hyunsung had developed close relations with Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan, with Park Deokgu relying on him and thinking of him as a brother.For Jung Hayan, he had feelings almost similar to a lover\u2019s.If someone wanted to take away Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan, they had to take him too now, for they were inseparable.Thus, it was a good performance on my part that I did not make any mistakes while hunting and that my brain worked better than others. However, people like me were scattered all across the continent.I should probably earn myself a good position in Kim Hyunsung\u2019s kingdom, which he would obviously establish in the future with the pace he was growing.Of course, I did not want to live a puppet\u2019s life like that of Lee Jihye, but sometimes you had to lower your head in order to move securely and protect yourself.\u2018It may not be that hard to follow him.\u2019I thought I had to go ahead and take advantage of this situation. And so, I opened my mouth to speak.\u201cThat\u2019s right, we are colleagues.\u201dWe were companions who protected and cared for each other.It felt a little odd to say that aloud.\u201cThat sounds wonderful, Hyung-nim. Yes\u2026 colleagues! Ah. So when do we go down to the dungeon?\u201d\u201cI think maybe quite soon. I haven\u2019t told \u2018them\u2019 yet\u2026 Maybe they\u2019re willing to go hunting with us.\u201d\u201cWell. Yes, there were times when I also wanted to go hunting together, but I refused because Hyung-nim had told me to be aware of them\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dKim Hyunsung looked at me once again.He had adequate vigilance for newcomers. That was confirmed, but I still thought he was quite satisfied with me.\u201cWell, that\u2019s a story for another time, so\u2026 lets focus on the other things.\u201d\u201cWell, you sound the same as Hyung-nim now. Hm, yes, there must be all sorts of smart men in this world.\u201d\u201cEven if we are attacking the dungeon together, we must be on our guards to some extent. As we don\u2019t know what may transpire at any moment, so it\u2019s definitely the right thing to be cautious. There is also the possibility that something may happen to us as it did to Park Hyaeyoung, so let\u2019s just be a little more careful this time.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand what you mean.\u201dAfter I said that, not only Hayan but also Kim Hyunsung himself nodded.\u201cKiyoung-ssi is right. But if we really have to be cautious\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI want all of us to consider that we may be facing them as an enemy there.\u201dEveryone nodded.\u201cAn enemy?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKim Hyunsung nodded once again and finally seemed to decide to tell us some more things.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much about that right now. Still, it would be better to prepare yourself. I don\u2019t know what will happen in the dungeon with all these new people.\u201d\u201cIt would be correct to assume that the level of difficulty would be higher than the first floor.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s probably like this, but I have to go tell Jinho now. We have to leave as quickly as time permits us.\u201d\u201cWhy hurry so much?\u201d\u201cWe can also prepare on the way to the dungeon.\u201d\u201cAh. I see.\u201dJung Jinho would not refuse this either.If their purpose was to survive here or start some other secret and evil plans or whatever, it was advantageous for them to go out together with us. Jung Jinho was already aware of the difference between his level and Kim Hyunsung\u2019s to some extent.That\u2019s why he kept agreeing with him.Variables were the most important in a fight, especially if you knew they were inherently disadvantageous for others.The dungeon attack expedition was likely to create the variable Jinho wanted. It could lead to a situation in which a different future may unfold if Kim Hyunsung was somehow removed.If he really was a killer, this shelter was the happiest place for him, so there was a high possibility that he would gamble and take this risk.If I was in his position, I would want to kill Kim Hyunsung and the rest of us at any cost. It was a good opportunity for him that had been provided by Kim Hyunsung himself.I kept putting up a faint smile on my lips.Kim Hyunsung was going to be used anyway, either by me or Jung Jinho.It was the best choice to make the most out of him in every way possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt will be hard for you, but you have to hold on.\u201d\u201cAre you really leaving for a very long period of time?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m actually worried about the fact that I may not come back at all, okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. It won\u2019t be like that. Of course, I believe in Hyunsung-ssi and Kiyoung, but\u2026 we can\u2019t always predict what will happen. By the way, it seems to me that Hayan-ssi keeps looking over here. Is she okay?\u201dWhen I looked back, Hayan came into my view. She wore a calm expression.She wasn\u2019t looking at me as she was at the time of Park Hyaeyoung\u2019s death that had caused her to be more passionate about me. I wondered what she was thinking. I was worried that she\u2019d begun to harbor negative thoughts about me, but there was no way I could know that.It would be a fine idea to have a conversation with her at the moment.If we talked while holding hands, then the situation may have been entirely different, but talking from a distance wouldn\u2019t seem intimate to anyone.When I turned back to look at her, Lee Jihye spoke again.\u201cYou made quite the big decision.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI thought you were the type that hated gambling.\u201d\u201cI do hate that.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not foolish enough to not throw the dice in a winning game.\u201dAfter considering all of the variables, the possibility of winning here was overwhelmingly high. I had information about the dungeon, the party members\u2019 overall specs, and the ability to return at any time I wanted.The chances of dying were negligible.Of course, there were many other things to be considered too, but this was a rare opportunity for someone like me who had trashy stats to begin with. We could win if we all worked together.And\u2026\u2018We could also be rewarded for attacking the dungeon.\u2019There was definitely a big reward for that. I thought about the box that Kim Hyunsung said he had found, and wondered if it was also that sort of a reward.Lee Jihye listened to me for a while. She became silent for a moment, but then she smiled and spoke.\u201cI really like your way of handling things.\u201d\u201cOh, really now?\u201d\u201cAnyway, come back soon, Kiyoung Oppa.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe small wrinkles were clear on her face.Despite the fact that she looked quite young for her age, she was still quite worried about her appearance. Apparently, she seemed to think that the little girl was prettier, so Jung Hayan had a greater advantage to survive in this place.As I moved away from her and approached Hayan, I could see Hayan moving quickly towards me and grabbed my sleeves\u2019 ends. She didn\u2019t say anything to me, but she seemed quite anxious.Park Deokgu burst into laughter, and Kim Hyunsung just nodded his head.The four men, including Jung Jinho and Yoo Seokwoo, were also quietly waiting for me.\u201cShould we go then?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThere were a total of 8 people.If you really thought about it, this was still a large number of people.Four of us were on one side and four on the other. If the other party was centered around Jung Jinho, then our party was centered around Kim Hyunsung.We were walking together along a twisting path. I couldn\u2019t hear much of the others\u2019 conversation.Most of the time, Jung Jinho talked to them all as he gave them instructions and orders occasionally. Other than that, they chatted with each other or spent their time looking and listening for monsters.\u201cBy the way, it looks like you\u2019ve been searching around a lot. We never thought there would be a new entrance here.\u201d\u201cIt was discovered unintentionally. As you may have also heard at the starting point, the basic condition to getting out of this place was survival, whether by attack or defense. I don\u2019t know how long we will have to survive here, so I thought it was stupid to lean on the former\u2026 Then, I decided to try to explore and attack as much as possible.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cMaybe the period of survival will end when a person successfully attacks the dungeon.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think about that, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a guess.\u201d\u201cIf it really is like that, does that mean that we need to attack the dungeon so that even those in the shelter can get out of this place?\u201d\u201cYou can think of it that way. Well, no matter how you look at it, it will not change the fact that attacking this dungeon is the most reasonable option for us right now. Anyway, thank you very much for agreeing to the offer.\u201d\u201cNo need for that. I also want to get out of this place. In fact, I want to thank you for making this opportunity for us. We were also a little anxious about this survival period situation as we did not know when it would end\u2026\u201dThis guy looked really good while smiling.It was a kind of smile that would unwittingly cause a person to lower his guard, but I knew this guy\u2019s disposition, so it was not going to work on me.Rather, we were in a situation where I had to get this guy to lower his own alertness level.Just sharing useless stories could help a lot with that objective of mine.I started telling them stories about Earth, stories about dungeons, and the woman\u2019s story at the starting point. Consequently, a rather embarrassing topic emerged.\u201cIt seems that Kiyoung often hangs around with Hayan. Perhaps\u2026 You two\u2026\u201dIt was something that no one had ever asked me. It was totally normal for me to be a little embarrassed. I looked around and noticed several people looking at me, waiting for my response.Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung both seemed to be listening too. Yoo Seokwoo, who had once flirted with Jung Hayan, was looking straight ahead.In the case of Hayan, she was bowing her head and pulling my sleeves.Jung Jinho seemed to be very curious about the topic.\u2018It can\u2019t be like this\u2026\u2019So not only were there pigs whose brains were full of muscles, but the calculating killer was also able to figure out that they were in some relationship.\u2018A relationship that was still developing?\u2019This was not possible.No matter how much I thought about it, these excuses looked like the ones that a celebrity with dating rumors would make.Obviously, my relationship with Jung Hayan was much closer than before.I thought about it a bit, and it didn\u2019t take long for me to come to a conclusion about what to answer.I just grabbed Hayan\u2019s hand with which she was holding my sleeve and said.\u201cI can\u2019t really can\u2019t say anything for sure yet\u2026 but, what you think about us personally is probably right.\u201d\u201cOh oh\u2026\u201dPark Deokgu\u2019s mouth was left hanging open. Meanwhile, Kim Hyunsung nodded.In his case, he seemed to think that Jung Hayan\u2019s relationship with me would be better for her.But what was truly interesting was Hayan\u2019s reaction. She was just looking at the ground with a very reddish face, but she was actually crushing my hand.\u2018Damn\u2026 that hurts.\u2019 My weak endurance was unable to withstand her strong grip.After thinking about many possible responses, I settled on this reply because it felt like the best one. The reason why I said that I couldn\u2019t define anything as of the moment was because I hadn\u2019t conveyed my true feelings to Jung Hayan yet.I thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if I just confessed to her right now, but then I thought that we should connect the bond in a more memorable way.It would be more effective to properly convey my sincerity afterward rather than just rushing everything.When I turned my head over to the side once more, I saw Hayan, who had a big smile spread across from her face.The other people looked like they were experiencing goosebumps, but Yoo Seokwoo just had a distorted expression on his face. One of the two people who were most interested in my relationship with Jung Hayan was him, and the other was Park Deokgu.I thought he might have a bad reaction to my statement, but he was really taking it quite well.I personally thought of Yoo Seokwoo as the real trash amongst ourselves, so I looked at him directly while stroking Jung Hayan\u2019s hair.We continued walking as we talked about other things.One of Jung Jinho\u2019s guys, the archer, was good at reading the tracks or discovering the signs of monsters, perhaps because of the effectiveness of his class, but there was no reason for us to disregard his ability.Jung Jinho seemed to be hiding his power, but it wasn\u2019t too hard to deal with the monsters here, and it was the same with the others who were already used to it by now.The thing that was a little surprising was that Yoo Seokwoo was also quick to adapt.Contrary to what I had thought that he would show a sorry figure as Park Hyaeyoung did, he actually swung his sword quite steadily.The others were by no means bad either.Not everyone was a calculating killer like Jung Jinho, but at this point, I thought that theirs was an ideal party as everyone was doing their job well.\u2018They act fast and play safe.\u2019It could be said that our current situation was a whole lot different from when Kim Hyunsung, Park Deokgu, Jung Ha-yan, and Park Hyaeyoung, along with me, were attacked. Jung Jinho and Kim Hyunsung took care of every monster jumping out of the bushes, while Park Deokgu blocked the front.Jung Hayan and I were providing rear support, but the archer\u2019s arrows and Jung Jinho\u2019s attacks were much better than ours.I could not help but feel a little regret for some reason, especially in the case of Jung Jinho.Contrary to Kim Hyunsung, who used a single sword, Jinho also used a small shield on his left arm to keep his opponent in check.If he could also use magic here, then that would be even more surprising.I felt like I knew why he didn\u2019t care about Park Deokgu, me, and Jung Hayan earlier.He was definitely strong on his own.I wasn\u2019t dissatisfied with Park Deokgu, Kim Hyunsung, and Jung Hayan, but if I could use Jung Jinho in the long term instead of just using him temporarily, it would be even more satisfying.\u201cYou are quite strong.\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s all thanks to everyone\u2019s help. How much farther do we need to go?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201dWhen I looked at Kim Hyunsung, he nodded at me.There they were. Some kind of mana was emanating from them. I could sense it like before.I didn\u2019t know what exactly it was, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out unless I went in.In fact, I wanted to ask Kim Hyunsung for a more accurate explanation, but there was no way I could do that.\u2018What is in there?\u2019The original question was why Kim Hyunsung, who had entered this dungeon, had judged it impossible to pass it alone with his current abilities.Curiosity and anxiety filled up inside me, and then\u2026\u201cAlright\u2026 we should enter.\u201dGiving up now was stupid.The path going down the stairs was dark. As I went down the long stairs, I saw an enormous iron gate.Park Deokgu, standing at the very front, slowly opened the iron gate, and soon we entered a room where a familiar voice rang out in our ears.It was the voice of the woman I had heard at the start point.[You have reached the underground dungeon. Rare level compulsory quest is activated.][Rare Grade Quest \u2013 Survival (0/1)]\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cOh, Hyung-nim\u2026\u201d\u201cPrepare yourselves for battle.\u201d\u201cEveryone, get ready to fight with your weapons!\u201dKim Hyunsung didn\u2019t need to shout it out, as everyone was already holding onto their weapons dearly.\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-ee-ee-e-ee\u201d\u201cKie-e-e-e-e-ee-ee!\u201dVoices much like barking dogs were heard from far away.\u2018Shit! Shit!\u2019I thought I had to take only some risks, but this was a bit more difficult than I thought. I realized now why Kim Hyunsung thought there should be a large number of people before attacking this place.\u2018I have to defend myself.\u2019From the voices that we were hearing, they were certainly not monsters, as we had seen before.\u201cThe gate\u2026 the iron gate is blocked!\u201d Someone exclaimed.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to run away. We\u2019ll be able to win this thing.\u201d\u201cWe can do it!\u201d\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee!\u201dI could hear them rushing to this place.Even the ground was rumbling.I immediately started to create spells in my anxiety.Jung Jinho\u2019s party also seemed to be a little surprised due to this situation. However, all of them were still organized around Jung Jinho.\u2018We can\u2019t stop all of them.\u2019It was embarrassing to admit, but it could not be prevented. Was it really possible for us to win with this level of power?\u201cOh, damn! There\u2019s a lot.\u201d Exactly like at the starting point, Park Deokgu could not control himself and spat out a curse for the third time.Of course, the battle was unavoidable\u2026 And this time, it was really going to be the most brutal one yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMonsters were flocking in from all directions and surrounded us.The monsters weren\u2019t so strong individually, but they were so large in numbers that I kept thinking we had unknowingly landed ourselves in a fatal situation. Now I understood why Kim Hyunsung had felt that the number of people to enter this place was insufficient before Jinho came along.No matter how strong Kim Hyunsung and Park Deokgu were, they had not reached a level where just the two of them could fight off these many monsters. The expression on each member of Jung Jinho\u2019s party had also gotten uglier after witnessing this.It seemed to me that they were also thinking about whether they could survive this ordeal today. Only Jung Jinho didn\u2019t seem that affected by the current situation.\u2018I can survive this.\u2019If we could survive this, then it was enough. It would also be smarter to conserve my magic power to use later.While constantly preparing spells with my mouth, I held my spear firmly with both hands.\u201cDeokgu.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dPark Deokgu, Kim Hyunsung, and Jung Jinho were going to be the first line of defense.Park Deokgu was supposed to properly block the center of their front and protect the defensive formation as much as he could. The two groups that had different ideas, in the beginning, began to unite for the sake of their survival.I was worried about being stabbed in the back by them right now, but Jinho\u2019s guys were not stupid enough to attack us in this situation.The same could be said for Kim Hyunsung.At this moment, the only thing going through everyone\u2019s minds was to survive the incoming onslaught. We all grabbed our weapons and prepared to ram the monsters that were running straight at us.Bang!\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee\u201d\u201cThese bastards!\u201dIt was completely normal for two or three of them to come up at once. Park Deokgu was holding up his shield and was trying as best as he could to maintain his position and stop them.We didn\u2019t have to worry about aiming our attacks, because the targets were coming in from every direction. I could feel the fleshy texture from my spear, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I hoped that Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung would not get tired from the repetitive attacks.\u201cStay as close as possible! Gather up!\u201d\u201cBrothers and sisters, stay strong! I don\u2019t know what will happen if we fail.\u201d\u201cAlright then, keep fighting!.\u201d\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee!\u201dIt was hard to withstand the constant flow of monsters. It felt like we were going to get pushed against the iron gate.Park Deokgu swung his shield with that huge body of his to create a space where we could move and take a breath. Kim Hyunsung and Jung Jinho were also slowly stabbing and pushing back the monsters that rushed to them with their weapons.\u2018They\u2019re strong.\u2019They were very strong.Jung Jinho, who was blocking with the small shield and stabbing with his sword, was concerned about Jung Hayan and I, and was constantly looking back at us. Kim Hyunsung did the same.They were worried about whether we would get hurt by the monsters.\u2018There is nothing to worry about, kids.\u2019\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dJung Jinho\u2019s lackeys were also attacking desperately. However, there was no room to aim properly from this distance.We bit our lips tightly and tried our best to stop the monsters that were trying to aim for our throats. The blood of the monsters continued to splatter on our faces and our weapons. Body organs, such as intestines, fell to the floor and became slippery.I would have frowned at this disgusting scene, but I could not spare the attention for that at the moment.\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!\u201dThe annoying sounds of the monsters and the screams that erupted from fear merged into each other.\u201cHey!\u201dBang!Whenever Deokgu swung his shield, the spectacular scene of a monster falling could be seen.\u2018This pig is actually very good!\u2019His potential wasn\u2019t that high, but Park Deokgu was really tough. It was a slightly different kind of strength from Kim Hyunsung and Jung Jinho, but the endurance ability that was in line of the 30s was so great that words could not describe it.Some types of attacks that were thrown at him were simply absorbed by his body.\u2018I underestimated him.\u2019I had judged him only by his talent up until now and ended up underestimating him.Actually, it was Park Deokgu who appeared to be more threatening than even Jung Jinho and Kim Hyunsung. An overwhelming presence emanated from his huge body.Although he did not have magical powers, his strength was truly remarkable. This shield soldier standing before me was not just a meaty shield.He knew when to advance and attack, and when to retreat.There was no sign of discomfort in his face, even though his body had endured countless attacks.\u2018Is he even human?\u2019I thought about it without even knowing.Of course, it was not that Park Deokgu was unafraid. He was scared, same as the first time he had gone hunting together with me.Nevertheless, he did not run away. He did not hide behind me as he had in our first encounter with the monsters outside. He was not worried about attacking ahead or breaking formation. That way of thinking didn\u2019t suit that muscle-filled brain of his.It was just my guess, but it seemed that Park Deokgu didn\u2019t want me or Jung Hayan to get hurt or die.\u201cDon\u2019t fall, Hyung-nim! Don\u2019t fall okay!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still behind you, pig. Concentrate.\u201d\u201cYou have to survive, okay!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dI could feel his concern just by seeing how he kept asking me about my health constantly.\u2018Baby pig\u2026\u2019What had me a little worried was that the monsters\u2019 attacks were too concentrated towards Park Deokgu.It didn\u2019t look like he had any major wounds yet, but there were some big and small cuts.This didn\u2019t look very good when I thought about what was supposed to happen afterwards, other than the fight here.It was exactly then that Hayan cast a spell.\u201cWind bomb.\u201dBang!It popped out loud, accompanied with a deafening sound.Some monsters were smashed into the ground and others on the ceiling due to the fierce wind, but it wasn\u2019t that effective.\u2018We have to save our strength\u2026\u2019I had decided that Hayan and I should conserve our magical powers as much as possible. Of course, Hayan had more magical powers than me, but still, it was not possible to use magic indefinitely.We couldn\u2019t lose our strength before Jung Jinho\u2019s group did. We had to minimize the consumption of our power while defending ourselves.While I was thinking for a moment about what to say, a smile formed on my lips when I saw the battlefield.\u2018Puh hah.\u2019Perhaps this was intended.The good thing was that the place where Hayan\u2019s magic fell, was where the monsters that Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung were blocking were located.In other words, the left side blocked by Jung Jinho\u2019s group did not receive the help of her magic. It looked like the burden was increasing on Jung Jinho\u2019s party and others who were becoming the targets of the monsters.I felt pity upon seeing these guys who were using all their power while blocking the monsters.Compared to that, we had some breathing space for ourselves.Thanks to Hayan\u2019s magic, the number of monsters attacking us had greatly reduced, and even though it was a brief gap, it allowed us to take a short break.\u2018Nice work, Hayan.\u2019Sometimes I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough, and that Hayan was way smarter than I thought.Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung, who had become more relaxed, of course, had no intention of going to the left.\u201cWe have to stay in line!\u201dIt appeared that staying in line was not possible. As another horde of monsters started attacking from the left side.\u201cLet\u2019s help them, Deokgu-ssi.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we can. I am only alive because of you, Hayan-ssi.\u201dAt this point, it was Jung Jinho who was the busiest. Jung Jinho could also use magic, but he wasn\u2019t using it in front of his men as he wanted to hide the fact that he was a Battlemage.Eventually, people from his party began screaming.\u201cPlease help!\u201d\u201cHelp us, please!\u201d\u201cPlease, just use the same magic!\u201dThey were hoping for Hayan to use her magic spell again.Hayan was staring at me, but I shook my head quietly.If Jung Jinho wanted, he could still protect all of them. They may get bitten on their arms or get other minor injuries, but that was manageable.Yoo Seokwoo also screamed at Hayan.\u201cHayan-ssi!\u201d\u201cAlright, wait a second. Eh, I\u2019m filling up my magic power\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn\u2026 Ahhhhhhhhh!\u201dIn the meantime, a monster appeared out of nowhere and bit his arm.Nevertheless, they did not stop fighting.Why? Because they knew that they would die if they stopped. It was regrettable that I couldn\u2019t laugh out loud, because things were going on so perfectly.\u201cI can\u2019t hold on!\u201dThe left lineup began to accumulate wounds one by one.\u2018This is happening exactly how I wanted it to be.\u2019Jung Jinho was also beginning to sustain some injuries. No matter how strong he thought he was, this was a place that even Kim Hyunsung was reluctant to enter alone.So, it was impossible for Jung Jinho to take care of everything on his own with these stats.I shouted loudly.\u201cYou can endure this! I know you can! Everyone!\u201d\u201cIs it Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cJust a little bit more\u2026\u201d\u201cQuickly help us!\u201d\u201cYou can hold on. You can definitely stop them! Please wait a little longer.\u201dI screamed as I swung my spear urgently at them, who were under too much pressure. The situation over there had already made it difficult for them to turn their heads and even reply to me.\u201cAhhhhhh! Damn!\u201dAnother guy\u2019s leg was bitten. Thus, he was left with no choice but to fight the rest of the battle with a limp.\u201cCast it! Quickly! We need magic!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost done!\u201dIn fact, I thought about the magic that had already been cast a while ago, and how I could use such a spell only once, so I was still a little reluctant to help them.The maximum number of magic spells I could cast was two. Three times was the limit at which I exhausted all my mana.I had to help, but at the same time, I also had to put some burden on them. Whenever five humans gathered, there was at least one trash among them.Perhaps I was going to be perceived as today\u2019s trash.\u201cFireball!\u201dKwakwang!\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee\u201dA huge fireball fell before the formation on the left.There was a huge bang, leaving the left party stunned for a while.Not only did it turn the monsters into flaming balls in an instant, but those who were hit by the fragments of the spell were also affected.The power of the flame-based spell really was great.As I had used up a lot of magical power, it would have been a little disappointing if it didn\u2019t have that effect.Jung Jinho\u2019s group, who clearly saw the magic annihilate the monsters instantly, felt that they were fortunate. They had found some time to rest too.However, the aftermath of the spell did not end there.\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee!\u201dWe all relaxed a bit.Everything was perfect. The magic had finally given all of them some room to rest for a while.However, there was one problem: the fire was spreading to the rest of the crowded monsters. Monsters, burning in fire, entangled with each other, creating spectacular fireworks. They became maddened and kept rushing to the direction they were going in before, but with a little more madness this time.\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-e-ee-ee!\u201dIt was truly spectacular to see the group of monsters rushing to the group of Jung Jinho as balls of fire. I didn\u2019t know for sure whether they were screaming with pain or roaring with joy.\u2018Burn! You monsters!\u2019\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cI am so sorry! About what happened\u2026\u201d I had created monsters of a new kind. They had to deal with these new burning monsters now.\u201cSorry again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a chance that we would also die if we went too close or got entangled with them.The reason this party was able to hold their defenses until now was because they were maintaining their formation, despite the relentless attacks they were receiving.As Jung Jinho\u2019s group had also done their fair share of hunting, they surely knew of this. That was why they were able to bear the hordes of rampaging monsters.\u201cShit!\u201dThose guys weren\u2019t backing down and were still doing their best to fight off the burning monsters. It was a fascinating sight for me.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201dOnly trash like me could enjoy such horrendous circumstances.As the number of monsters decreased, the actual burden on us was supposed to be reduced, but those guys still did their best to stave off an entirely new kind of monster, which was definitely heartbreaking to see. Although they were pushing the burning monsters as far away from themselves as possible, the problem was that they couldn\u2019t do anything about the flames that burned their bodies.The considerable physical exhaustion and the burning heat continued to eat away at their stamina.The temperature was rising in the dungeon.There was no telling how much direct flames or heat Jung Jinho\u2019s group was facing.\u201cAhhhhhhhhh!\u201d[Checking the status window of the Monster Burning Maw.][Name: None][Title: None. You should try a little harder.][Age: 5][Disposition: Burning Instinct][Class: None][Stats][Strength: 12][Agility: 15][Stamina: 05][Endurance: 15][Luck: 10][Magic Power: 01]I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening, but I could see some changes in the monster\u2019s status window.Their health seemed to be decreasing rapidly, but their magical power had increased by one point. It could have been due to the flame that I had fired at them.\u201cExtinguish the fires, motherfucker!\u201dEven Buddha, could not help but swear furiously in such a situation.\u201cSorry! Just a little bit now! Please hold on a little!\u201dIt felt as if some kind of holy warriors were fighting against armies sent directly from hell.After some time, it became clear that they had to sacrifice something in order to get rid of the monsters for good.It depended on their stamina, or on the tricks that Jung Jinho was hiding from the rest.As I couldn\u2019t hear him cast any spells, Jung Jinho had probably decided to keep them hidden for the time being.\u2018He will hide his skills until the right opportunity comes.\u2019It was good judgment on his part to hide the true extent of his powers until the very end.And it wasn\u2019t just me. Kim Hyunsung also knew about these things already.\u2018Such pitiful behavior!\u2019He was acting so stupidly that I actually wanted to laugh out loud. Of course, Kim Hyunsung knew that Jinho could use magic.I didn\u2019t know what kind of class he would have been promoted to in the future, but he must have achieved a higher level of the same Battlemage class that he had now.I had come to know about his class as a Battlemage through my ability, and the guy from the future was, of course, already aware of his secrets.The cards that Jinho thought he was hiding right now were those that some of us knew about. It was like playing poker when all of your cards were already known to the opponent.Even though I knew that he had more than one card up his sleeve, it made me laugh whenever I saw him biting his teeth while trying his best to hide his abilities.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s idea was really worthy of him being a time-traveler.As if making fun of his judgment, the situation began to get even worse.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cDamn! Kichul!\u201d\u201cPlease hold on!\u201dLee Kichul was the name of one of Jung Jinho\u2019s lackeys. We didn\u2019t know that before now.Then a Burning Maw caught him.They were screaming and trying to grab his arm to get him away from the monster, but of course, there was nothing they could do to save him.In the end, Lee Kichul was dragged into the mass of the fiery monsters.The sight of him being swallowed up by the monsters, who were filling up the narrow corridor, made me frown unknowingly.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh! Help me! Help me!\u201d\u201cKiyoung! Hayan!\u201dIt was impossible to use my precious magical power again to protect Jung Jinho\u2019s partner as I could only use it once more.I was a little nervous, but\u2026\u201cA little bit! Just a bit more!\u201d\u2018I will not falter.\u2019As long as Jung Jinho was present, I couldn\u2019t falter.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh! Stop! Stop! Oh, you son of a bitch! Stop!\u201dThere was no way to check from here whether his intestines were being eaten or his limbs were being ripped apart.One thing was for sure; it was very painful to hear his voice. He let out blood-curling screams.The pain of being eaten alive and the pain of burning flesh would be torturous to feel at the same time when you fell to the monsters, so I thought his reaction was quite natural.\u2018One guy is done for.\u2019Even in the midst of all this, the thought that I had just killed a person still disturbed me, but I didn\u2019t feel any guilt either. It was probably because of the excitement or the battle circumstances.Rather, this was something that I very much wanted to see.The edge of my lips rose up to form a smile.\u201cWe can do this!\u201d\u2018It\u2019s going to get better.\u2019His death had made the situation even more favorable for us.\u201cAhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cShit! Shit! Kichul!\u201d\u201cHyung-nim, isn\u2019t this getting too dangerous?\u201d\u201cNever mind that. The monster won\u2019t be able to get through their formation.\u201dWe were going to watch this massacre until the end.If we could fight off the monsters, we would definitely be able to survive. Unlike Jung Jinho, Kim Hyunsung wasn\u2019t nervous at all. I thought I knew why.\u201cHey!\u201dMy attacking style was simple and repetitive, which consisted of just aiming at the blocked monsters and then stabbing them with the spear.I started feeling exhausted.Not only did my spear hand start trembling, my breathing also got rough and unsteady. My whole body was covered with sweat, and it was increasingly getting difficult to breathe.I wanted to lay down on the ground and rest for a moment, but those monsters that kept running towards us did not give me that time to take a breath.\u2018Will we survive?\u2019Park Deokgu\u2019s condition was remarkably good. The same was true for Kim Hyunsung.Jung Jinho could also be counted among them, although he had holes burnt into his clothes.Yoo Seokwoo and the remaining archer seemed to be struggling a lot, but they didn\u2019t look like me yet.The monsters\u2019 corpses were beginning to pile up like a wall, but still, more monsters stepped over the corpses and attacked us.Park Deokgu blocked them, and I stabbed them repeatedly.\u2018How much longer can we hold on?\u2019I pretended to be okay, but on the inside, I was feeling quite anxious. I couldn\u2019t figure out how many monsters were still left.But one thing was certain; the roars that could be heard were getting lesser.Instead, a loud voice rang in my ears.Something like, \u2018Please hold on!\u2019I didn\u2019t know who had said that in all the commotion.\u201cWhew!\u201dI struck a spear into a monster, squeezing all of my remaining strength into it.Park Deokgu also pushed back with his shield with a loud roar.\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!\u201dFinally, when Kim Hyunsung slowly put his arms down to his sides, I realized that the hellish trial was over at last.\u201cThey are finished.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d I sank to the ground without even thinking about it.It was Kim Hyunsung who spoke at this moment while everyone was still breathing roughly.\u201cWe have to move away immediately.\u201d\u2018Damn it\u2026\u2019\u201cThe quest we are on hasn\u2019t been completed yet. I think it would be better to start moving right away.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Hyung-nim. If you can\u2019t walk, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cStop, Deokgu. I can walk. Hayan\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you but I\u2019m alright, Oppa.\u201dAt that moment, another problem presented itself in front of them.The body of the guy named Kichul, who had been dragged and killed by the monsters, was barely recognizable.The badly mangled body was a truly horrific sight to witness.As I saw the terribly torn up body of a dead colleague, I eventually lowered my head, but I couldn\u2019t forget his hostility to our group.Jung Jinho was standing expressionless.Yoo Seokwoo was wearing an extremely hostile expression.\u201cDo you see this!\u201dMost of his hair had burned, and the body was covered with scars. It didn\u2019t need any confirmation that the guy named Kichul had died a very miserable death.Looking at his body\u2019s state, it could be said that it had been pretty painful for him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\u201cDo you think it can be forgiven by simply apologizing? Bastard! \u201d\u201cThat, but\u2026 Uh, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt was an unavoidable situation. I am not familiar with magic other than flame magic yet, and if my magic spell hadn\u2019t been cast correctly then that would have caused even more casualties. Hayan didn\u2019t have enough time to use her magic powers, and I didn\u2019t think the monsters would stick to each other and spread the flames. It was the best option at that time. That and\u2026 the number of monsters was also significantly reduced because of it.\u201dI spoke calmly, but the message behind my words was clear.If it weren\u2019t for me, they wouldn\u2019t even have been able to survive up to this point in the first place.Of course, only Hayan and I had the magical ability to get us all out of that sticky situation, but using magical powers to save them would have been more detrimental to us than beneficial.Jung Jinho would have arrived at the same conclusion.Of course, Jung Jinho\u2019s point of view, he hadn\u2019t known that Kichul would die so quickly. That was his mistake.The magic was a little too powerful, and it was true that Kichul died because of the spreading fire.It was also true that I spread the fire on purpose, however\u2026He didn\u2019t know that.\u201cNow what are we going to do\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t help it. Kichul\u2019s death is a pity for me too\u2026 But now\u2026\u201dThe other guy in Jinho\u2019s group was getting angry. It wasn\u2019t completely unreasonable of him to feel that way.It seemed like he wanted nothing better than to aim a bow or a spear at me right now. Thus, it was a bit scary to see the guy approaching me with a frown.I shook my head while glancing at Park Deokgu.Park Deokgu nodded. I had signaled him not to intervene.\u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. Nevertheless\u2026 It was inevitable.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 this\u2026 \u201dWhatever I said, it appeared as total bullshit to him. I knew the characteristics of these sorts of guys very well.\u2018Angry weaklings.\u2019They were weak people controlled by their anger, and they only attacked those in their fury who they considered to be weaker than themselves.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for your loss and everything that happened. We don\u2019t have to fight.\u201dHe raised his fist to the highest point he could, and then he fiercely swung down.Of course, I did not avoid it.Some degree of acting was necessary on my part too.The blow landed on my face, and I fell to the side with tremendous force.I felt dizzy, and I was spitting blood.In that instant, I didn\u2019t even have to act. My body, which was too fragile, fell to the ground by itself.\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d Park Deokgu was startled.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Deokgu. I made a mistake.\u201dI tried as hard as I could to play the victim and stopped Park Deokgu.\u201cJaejoon, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to go. Everyone understands what happened, but more fighting will avail nothing.\u201d\u2018Right. Conflict won\u2019t amass to anything.\u2019Even from Jung Jinho\u2019s point of view, it was a really bad idea to start fighting in such a dangerous place right now.I coughed and spat out one tooth along with some clotted blood.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019\u201cAre you okay? Kiyoung-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. It\u2019s okay, Hyunsung-ssi. This was my fault. I couldn\u2019t help them.\u201dThe punch had been really painful, I\u2019ll admit that.However, I could not say that to Kim Hyunsung. I knew that I wasn\u2019t at fault, and the other group\u2019s level of vigilance towards me had dropped by now.I sensed warmth and protection in the eyes of the people around me. This alone gave me confidence, and momentarily, it felt as if I was in the world\u2019s safest place.And now I could see death in one of their eyes.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019It was Jung Hayan, who was staring at Jung Jinho\u2019s lackey, Kim Jaejoon, with an expressionless face.\u2018What the hell is going to happen now?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnyone who would have seen the battle would say that the situation had gotten a lot worse. It was comparable to a trashy piece of art.I bet even if Solomon himself came and made a judgment, then even he would have declared me to be a sinner. The gamble that Kim Hyunsung had decided to do with his own reputation certainly didn\u2019t end badly for him.The monsters had mercilessly devoured Lee Kichul, and Jung Jinho\u2019s lackey\u2019s rage made him whimsical enough to kill me.But there wasn\u2019t any further conflict, and Kim Hyunsung had handled the situation quite well.I didn\u2019t know if I had done my part or not, but I was happy enough with the results. Without even using my hands, I had sent a man to his merciless death.Even though I lost one tooth as I was acting to become the victim, I achieved some advantageous and desirable results that earned my beloved and precious colleagues\u2019 warm attention.However, Jung Hayan\u2019s expression had changed unexpectedly. Had it become taboo to engage in any brawl with someone else for her?\u2018Don\u2019t tell me, really?\u2019Had it also become some weird kind of taboo for someone to touch my body?After a moment of biting her nails, she quickly approached me as if she had suddenly noticed that I was still lying on the floor.However, her expression was still hostile.\u201cOh, Oppa!\u201dAfter she saw me bleeding from my mouth, she forgot about everything.She used her ring and tried to send magical power through it. The sight was spectacular. However, divine power ring that Hayan was wearing was not intended to heal such wounds.When I grabbed her left hand slightly, she stopped chanting the spell, as if she knew what I meant. Her big eyes were full of tears, and after a moment, they started falling relentlessly.\u201cAre you okay? What can I do\u2026 What should I do?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m okay. It was my fault after all\u2026\u201dThere was a bitter taste in my mouth.One of the teeth had flown away, and one side of my cheek was tingling, but I wasn\u2019t feeling that much pain.That was because if I did anything but display my stiffness, it seemed that Jung Hayan would start casting magic spells out there.\u2018Be patient Hayan\u2026 Please, please.\u2019Shooting magic at Jung Jinho\u2019s party was definitely not a bad option, but it was better to play the victim right now. As I could see that Kim Hyunsung hadn\u2019t made a move yet, it looked like he was also hoping for it.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dShe kept touching my face as if I had lost my skin or something. Seeing that she was struggling with her words in her panicked state, I wondered if Hayan was actually sane. Tears were streaming down her face, and she had a bloody nose.It was as if I was already dead. Her reaction was too passionate about the fact that I had lost only one of my teeth.\u201cAre you okay, Oppa? Are you alright?\u201d\u201cYes I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s not a big deal. Don\u2019t mind me, Hayan. I\u2019m really okay. It doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201dIt did hurt, but it wasn\u2019t a big wound.It was nice to have this reaction for this kind of wound, as it seemed a little scary to think about what would happen otherwise.\u201cThis guy! How dare you!\u201dBecoming easily incensed was natural for Park Deokgu, and it was the same as eating and drinking for him. The reactions of Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu had exceeded my expectations. At this point, I thought Jung Jinho would also be embarrassed by this situation.Of course, the guy who was more embarrassed than anyone else was the one who had hit me.He sensed the sudden ominous change in the harsh atmosphere. What I had done had instantly turned me, the perpetrator, into a victim.Yet something even more magical happened.\u2018Arghh.\u2019Even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t do this, my mouth continued to curve into a smile. I kept grinning.In the end, it was Jung Jinho who bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u201cI have nothing to say. I know you didn\u2019t do it with bad intentions. If you hadn\u2019t used magic, something even worse would have happened. Jaejoon is saddened that Kichul, who had been with us for a long time, has died. I hope you understand. Jaejoon?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cJaejoon. You have to apologize. It was an unavoidable situation and it was the best option. If it weren\u2019t for Kiyoung, we might all be dead.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if it was due to seeing Jung Jinho\u2019s expression, but the guy named Jaejoon, who had constantly been furious up until now, also bowed his head slightly.\u201cI\u2026 It seems I got out of control for a while, sorry\u2026\u201dHis fists were shaking.He was not looking at me properly, and it was not difficult to know why. I thought I had to be the one to apologize in this situation, but my mouth wouldn\u2019t open if I wanted it too.In fact, he still looked as red as an apple, and he wasn\u2019t apologizing wholeheartedly. Rather, it came off as if he was just trying to control his anger.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jaejoon. I can understand. I was also a little frivolous\u2026 I cannot comfort you with any words, but I sincerely apologize.\u201dOf course, I wasn\u2019t serious either.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry,\u201d I could see that he was forcibly lowering his head.I didn\u2019t really feel like I was getting an apology, but it felt good apart from that.\u2018Phew.\u2019If he hadn\u2019t been angry in the first place, it would have been me who had to bow to him.In fact, what was more worrisome than that guy was, of course, Jung Hayan.\u2018What am I going to do with her\u2026?\u2019If she was thinking about doing the same thing as she had done to Park Hyeayoung, this would turn out pretty bad.The title of the culprit in the case of Park Hyeayoung had already been nailed to Jung Jinho.But if this guy was to disappear suddenly somewhere right after, Kim Hyunsung might get suspicious of Jung Hayan. It would certainly increase the suspicions if this guy was found dead with his legs and arms amputated. Of course, I would also be on the suspects list by then.I wanted to calm her down. From her expressions, it felt like she wouldn\u2019t be returning to normal anytime soon.When I looked at her palms, they were bleeding due to her nails as she had clenched her fists. Now I was almost certain that Jung Hayan\u2019s attack was unavoidable.\u2018Let\u2019s see where this goes.\u2019If I thought about it a little more positively, the scenario wasn\u2019t that bad, actually.The fact that Jung Hayan would attack him directly was also something that could prove to be helpful in the future.If Kim Jaejoon died, Jung Jinho would have lost both his companions.\u2018What is she doing\u2026\u2019However, the appearance of Hayan secretly picking up my fallen tooth was giving off the feeling of a ticking bomb that you never knew when it would explode.\u201cI will get you up, Kiyoung Oppa.\u201d\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do that. Sorry for the disturbance.\u201dShe grabbed me by my arms, and I was able to stand up again. It didn\u2019t hurt that much.Now, the next best thing to do was to strike first.The timing of the first attack had to be determined by our side.I did not like Jinho being around me, and maybe he would attack right away if he got the chance.\u201cCan you walk?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cIf you have any trouble\u2026 \u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s really okay. Hyunsung-ssi. As you said, let\u2019s get out of this place first.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201dThe huge iron door was still tightly closed.Either it wouldn\u2019t open until the quest was over, or it might only be opened from the outside, but one thing was certain: in order for us to survive, we had to find a way to complete the quest of this dungeon.Unfortunately, the name of the quest itself was survival.\u201cMaybe when the woman, in the beginning, was talking about surviving, she was referencing to this quest here.\u201dJung Jinho\u2019s words lightened up everyone\u2019s spirits.We were listening to everything he said.This was because everyone, including Jung Hayan, was on the lookout for Jung Jinho and his hostility if he ever happened to show it.It was a natural for him now to try and get close to us in order to live.I thought I would be the one to do it as I had been thinking similarly.\u201cI thought of the same thing. The first floor actually has no other purpose and it seems that survival and attacking the monsters here are the main objectives. If survival is a condition that needs to be accomplished in order to escape from this dungeon, then we have to avoid or overcome the monsters. In this way we can kill two birds with one stone. If this hypothesis is correct, we don\u2019t have to worry much about the first floor.\u201dIt meant that whether we were focusing on attacking or surviving, it was necessary to strategically use survival skills. Kim Hyunsung seemed to be thinking along the same lines.I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the conversation because I was trying to find my way towards the front, but seeing that there was no dissenting voice, it seemed that my hypothesis was correct. Both survival and attacking that the woman talked about in the beginning tutorial took place here.\u201cI understand the survival part, but\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, there may be something like a boss monster here.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s common under such conditions. If you look at the status windows or classes, this place is quite similar to an online game. If it wasn\u2019t for the tutorial, there could be various methods for the attack, but this is a dungeon that is simply focused on survival and attack, so we might be facing a slightly different problem. Killing that monster is probably the main thing we have to do here.\u201d\u201cI was thinking the same thing, Kiyoung-ssi.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a guess. Secondly, we also have the option of finding our way out.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt could be our way out of this hellish dungeon, or there could be another method that could get us all out. There are a few more things, but I can\u2019t remember them.\u201dThis was just reasoning that anyone could easily formulate. Jung Jinho and even Yoo Seokwoo might have been thinking of the same thing, so there was little suspicion on who worded it first.\u201cYou really are thinking ahead, Kiyoung-ssi\u2026 \u201d Yoo Seokwoo muttered.He was also angry. He seemed to be thinking whether I had thrown the fireball there on purpose, but I just laughed in my mind at that thought.He wasn\u2019t the only guy that wanted to kill me.\u201cOh, these are just some of my thoughts\u2026 \u201dIn fact, these were simple deductions.As I continued walking, I couldn\u2019t see the monsters anymore.Of course, there were some others scattered around, but they weren\u2019t of the same level as the ones we were fighting before. We killed them as quickly as possible because they could cause unforeseen problems, and then we would have to face the same kind of battle again.Most of our stamina had been drained, so we were moving very slowly. We repeatedly had to stop to catch our breaths.In the meantime, our magic powers were passively recovering, which was a good thing for us.There were occasions when Kim Hyunsung frowned, and Jung Hayan kept staring at Kim Jaejoon, but fortunately, nothing big happened.Particularly in the case of Hayan, whenever she saw me with my swollen mouth, she got even more frustrated and angry. Sometimes she would start crying all of a sudden and shake her head while muttering to herself.Park Deokgu appeared to be a bit affected whenever she cried involuntarily.Contrary to the rumors that I was \u2018good\u2019 with women, I didn\u2019t seem to have any idea on how to comfort Jung Hayan. This whole sequence of events had been bizarre.Then she bowed her head and whispered in a small voice. Her voice was so low that I couldn\u2019t hear it properly even after getting close to her.Thus, I tried to guess what she was saying\u2026It sounded like \u2018I have to kill him\u2019, but I didn\u2019t let my expression show that I had heard her. In the end, this would benefit me too.\u201cI will take revenge.\u201dI pretended as if I didn\u2019t hear that either.This could turn out better than I had originally anticipated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This had become a regular occurrence now.Jung Hayan was staring at me and couldn\u2019t hold back her tears.It wasn\u2019t as passionate as the first time, but every time I saw her tears falling like that, I felt a little strange. Of course, the situation itself was not that good.It was because Kim Jae-joon and Jung Jin-ho kept looking at this side.In order to ruin the atmosphere of the party even more, during various conversations, Jung Hayan cried out in this way, and it was unavoidable that the atmosphere became a little quiet. Someone would have thought it was me who died, not Lee Ki-cheol.In fact, it became a routine for Jung Hayan to stare at Kim Jae-joon. Nobody could imagine how uncomfortable Kim Jae-joon was.They were already in a position to stand on our side.As Lee Ki-cheol suffered an unexpected accident, the balance of power that had been maintained collapsed. Jung Jin-ho\u2019s party actually seemed to have given up trying to hunt us.Jung Jin-ho might have decided that it would be better not to launch an attack as long as there wasn\u2019t any good opportunity to do so.\u2018I would have done the same thing.\u2019Even if I was in Jung Jin-ho\u2019s position, I would have completely canceled the plan to kill Kim Hyun-sung\u2019s party. This was why they were sensitive to even the slightest conflict.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, Mr. Jinho. That\u2019s a little embarrassing. In fact, I am the one who should apologize.\u201dHe had been apologizing like this over and over again.\u201cI\u2026 I was just excited.\u201d\u201cOf course you were excited. I also apologize again.\u201dI don\u2019t know what the two had talked about, but whenever Jung Jin-ho apologized, Kim Jae-joon also expressed his apology.The problem was that, little by little, Jung Hayan was showing hostility.\u201cI, why did I do that, I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201dMore often than not, they talked about this among themselves as if it was not for us to listen. I was not worried about them talking about attacking us, as I could discern that much.What humored me was Yoo Seok-woo\u2019s reaction.\u201c\u2026.\u201dFrom the time I first revealed that I was close to Jung Hayan, he seemed to be in a bad mood. As expected, when Jung Hayan and I started to hang around, he often showed signs of discomfort.In particular, it seemed to him that Hayan had swollen eyes because she had been crying for me. That was how much Jung Hayan was thinking of me.\u2018Yoo Seok-woo\u2026.\u2019In the first place, he was nothing more than a rapist for Jung Hayan.In fact, even if he had only tried to do it once, it was still correct to say that him being here was slightly absurd.Considering what he had done before, it would not have been possible for him to hang out with their group, but it seemed that Jung Jin-ho had made a deal with him. That was also why he had got that job and gained experience by sticking with them.It was his deranged illusion if he thought that he could get my beloved and get away with it, but as the plan had been canceled already, I sufficed by sending him a hateful gaze.In any case, this party was heading in a good direction with respect to friendliness, at least superficially. It was the dream party that forgot old disputes and did not fight.All of this was an atmosphere created by Jung Jin-ho and Kim Jae-joon, but unfortunately, I didn\u2019t want to be so embarrassingly peace loving like they were.Kim Hyun-sung sometimes seemed to be thinking about something. I hoped that it was something about how to dispose of Jung Jin-ho, as they were the murderers who killed Park Hye-young. I thought it was right for them to die here.In fact, if you considered the reaction that Kim Hyun-sung showed when he first saw Jung Jin-ho, there was a big possibility of that.Jung Jin-ho, Yoo Seok-woo, and Kim Jae-joon were still wearing pretentious smiles.Kim Hyun-sung, of course, looked as if he were about to go crazy. This guy would probably be the first one to attack.At least for Park Deok-gu, Jung Hayan and I, he was looking for a cause or good opportunity, as it was certain that he did not want to let the other party know his true intentions.No, that was certain.A good opportunity to kill them, or a justification to attack, from Kim Hyun-sung\u2019s occasional frown, he seemed to be thinking about these things.\u2018Can I help him?\u2019 Kim Hyun-sung was implicative of needing help.We needed a situation where we had a total moral high ground and could attack them.For example\u2026\u2018I get attacked first,\u2019 What would they do then?Perhaps that was an ideal situation.The warriors of justice fighting against a group of cowardly criminals who had attacked suddenly gave a pretty good feeling.The problem was that Jung Jin-ho and his lackeys would not attack us. However, considering that one was an angry bufoon and the other was feeling jealous, it was not difficult.Maybe it was as easy as a yawn.\u2018Provocation, after all, is my specialty.\u2019In particular, in the case of Yoo Seok-woo, there was a possibility that Jung Jin-ho may behave unexpectedly as well, as he had just entered Jung Jin-ho\u2019s party. These thoughts went through my head in an instant.First of all, it didn\u2019t appear to be a bad idea to use Hayan to disturb them. I didn\u2019t have any other plans.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThis would be enough.\u201cOppa\u2026.\u201dHayan whispered in a small voice.It seemed a little embarrassing, but I didn\u2019t dare to move my hand. She had been trembling just because I had put a hand on her waist.Someone might think that I was walking with Hayan for support. The only ones that felt the ambiguity of the hand\u2019s position were Jung Hayan and Yoo Seok-woo.It was neither the waist, nor the pelvis, nor the buttocks. The reaction came just by holding the boundary line between the sensitive areas.\u2018Pop\u2026.\u2019I could feel his anger from over here.\u201cAh, Hayan. Sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a comfortable place\u2026 You can grab it\u2026.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026.\u201dThe expression as if his beloved girlfriend was stolen looked horrible.While Kim Hyun-sung, Jung Jin-ho, Park Deok-gu, and Kim Jae-joon were talking about the dungeon, he was looking only at this side.As I slightly lowered my hand, Jung Hayan bowed her head.\u2018I like it so much\u2026.\u2019This reaction was not expected, but on the contrary, Yoo Seok-woo had a face that signaled he was close to blowing up.We had eye contact for a second, and I did not forget to have a smile on my face.\u2018I dare you,\u2019 that was what my face covertly expressed.I did not have to settle with a verbal message. Actions and facial expressions are sometimes a great means of communication.\u201cThank you, Hayan. Isn\u2019t it difficult?\u201d\u201cAh! No. Compared to what my Oppa helped me with, this is nothing,\u201d Jung Hayan actually still wanted me to hold on to her.I was holding onto her really smoothly, so it was not unreasonable for her to have such a reaction.It didn\u2019t matter if Yoo Seok-woo was serious about Hayan in the first place or not. If he thought about my actions, I think he might have to get serious, but\u2026\u2018Good.\u2019It was a seed that had been sown.Besides this, there were also other things that were going on. Like Hayan\u2019s eyes or sweet voice, and the way that she was worried about me right now. Of course, it didn\u2019t sound sweet to me, but I knew that a voice that seemed like it was covered in honey would crush his pained heart even more.\u2018Hold her hand.\u2019\u2018Pull her body close.\u2019\u2018Put your hands on her back or shoulders, and maintain moderate tension.\u2019\u2018Let\u2019s have a nice time.\u2019It was a method that triggered sexual tension.The situation was such that Jung Hayan\u2019s face had already turned red.Nevertheless, the smile hanging from the corner of her mouth never disappeared. I thought I had to stop because her breathing seemed to be getting rougher\u2026I could not stop myself.In the end, I asked her whether she was comfortable.\u201cHayan, you look very difficult\u2026 My, I\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dThe sound of laughter came out from my mouth unintentionally. This was because I saw that Hayan completely ignoring Yoo Seok-woo.You could see Yoo Seok-woo\u2019s face turn red for a different reason than that of Hayan.Kim Hyun-sung, Jung Jin-ho, and Park Deok-gu looked back at the little fuss that was happening behind them.Park Deok-gu immediately opened his mouth when he saw Jung Hayan breathing out a little harshly.\u201cOh, my sister, are you hurt?\u201d\u201cNo, Hayan. Actually, I am not hurt that much\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh! No! I\u2026 I will help you\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, it seems like my sister wants to be with her older brother\u2026 If it gets hard, you have to tell me.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dPark Deok-gu intervened at a pretty good timing. He was indirectly letting me know that Jung Hayan wanted it. Not that I wanted that, either.As I put my hand on Hayan\u2019s waist and looked back, I met Yoo Seok-woo\u2019s eyes again.Seeing my smile, it must be difficult for him to hold back.\u201cSo sweet.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Hayan.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026.\u201dYou could see the guy shaking slightly.He should have behaved quite naturally if he had been a person that had good self-control in the first place, but then he would not have done what he did in the shelter.If Jung Jin-ho was alone, this would have been more difficult.Seeing that he was holding his sword tightly, he seemed to want to poke me with his sword right now, but for the moment, I wanted to compliment him for his patience. I didn\u2019t know if the stimulus was a bit lacking or if he was waiting for an opportunity, maybe it was both.It was when I looked back and grabbed Hayan\u2019s waist once more that something happened.\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee!\u201d\u201cPrepare for battle.\u201dGood opportunities come with good timing.I lifted the spear with a weak expression, and Hayan also got away for a while and began to prepare a spell.Park Deok-gu, Jung Jin-ho, and Kim Hyun-sung were focusing their eyes on the front.\u201cFuhhhhh\u2026.\u201dI began to mutter quietly in a voice that could only be heard by him, \u201cYou are envious, right?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201d\u201cShe was really soft. Our Hayan,\u201d the corners of my mouth could not stop from forming a smile on my mouth\u201cThere are five of them. Prepare for battle as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dHe suddenly lifted his sword.I was wondering if I should run because I could see the blade coming towards me directly\u2026\u2018It\u2019s better to get hit,\u2019 I knew I could endure it.As Jung Hayan had the healing ring, I would be able to easily recover from the wounds I would receive. I began to feel a creepy sensation along with a rumbling sound.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dThen came the pain that was incomparable to being hit in the face. A scream erupted from my mouth, unknowingly, because of the searing pain that burned through my body.It was no wonder that everyone\u2019s eyes were focused here in an instant.Jung Jin-ho and Kim Jae-joon look like they could not speak. However, they could understand that something had happened.Yoo Seok-woo had stabbed me.I was worried that Jung Jin-ho would treat Yoo Seok-woo as a madman and throw him away to keep being friendly\u2026Then I realized that my worries were useless due to his shouts.\u201cI\u2026 I! I did it! Jinho-ssi!! Jaejoon-ssi!! I\u2019ve done it!\u201dOf the cards, Jung Jin-ho had, at least one was this idiot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seok-woo!\u201d\u201cI did it! The dog, motherfucker! I stabbed him! Brother!\u201d\u201cThis crazy bastard!\u201dThe place erupted into chaos.Jung Jin-ho immediately pulled out his sword. Of course, I thought it wasn\u2019t for the intention to attack us.\u2018He\u2019s trying to kill him.\u2019He seemed to be trying to correct this situation by killing Yoo Seok-woo.It was as if he would kill him to shut his mouth, and then clear up the situation later. Right now, that was the only thing Jung Jin-ho could choose.It was clear that he did not want to fight with our team in a place like this.If it was Kim Hyun-sung or Park Deok-gu that was stabbed by the sword, there might have been a chance, but unfortunately, the weakest, Lee Ki-young, was the one who had gotten hurt.\u2018You can\u2019t kill him.\u2019When I looked at Kim Hyun-Sung instinctively, I could see that he was also moving quickly.Jung Jin-ho\u2019s lackey Kim Jae-Joon, who seemed to have a remarkably inferior ability to grasp the situation, started running towards our side with a dagger. He thought that Jung Jin-ho running out was a signal of battle.\u201cThis beggar trash! You killed him! You killed Ki-cheol!\u201dOf course, I killed Lee Ki-Cheol.Even so, I couldn\u2019t imagine that he would actually leave Deokgu next to him and run over here to me.It seemed that I had become the official celebrity of this party during this attack. I, who should have been safely protected from the rear, quickly became the main tank.What was unexpected was that Park Deok-gu\u2019s ability to judge the situation was a little slow.At least I thought he would block the second attack, but he couldn\u2019t prevent Kim Jae-Joon from rushing to my side with his dagger raised.\u2018Damn.\u2019The dagger fell at my back as I crouched reflexively. It seemed as if he was precisely aiming at my neck.\u2018Hurts!\u2019\u201cAhhhhhhhhh!\u201dIt was too painful. Park Deok-gu came to his senses right after the second attack fell. As well as pushing him with his large shield, he began to block me with a pale, stiff face.Yoo Seok-woo in the back looked a little bit stunned by the sudden situation. He held the dagger he had used to stab me and was shaking relentlessly.He was also not used to stabbing someone. Of course, Jung Jin-ho and Kim Hyun-sung were more important than this fearful trash.\u201cIs this just a misunderstanding\u2026.?\u201d the two\u2019s swords collided before the voice came out.\u2018Done.\u2019Bang! As soon as I heard the sound, the sight of Jung Jin-ho being blown far away could be seen.The battle had already begun. The goal was achieved, and the two were put against each other.All that remained was to correct this situation.I wanted to ask for a quick treatment, but the problem was that I couldn\u2019t speak.There was no voice other than screaming that came out due to pain I felt for the first time in my life. When I thought I would hear the Healing magic from Hayan, I actually heard a scream of rage from Hayan\u2019s side.\u201cI hate you!\u201d\u2018Hurt\u2026.\u2019\u201cThese guys!! Hyung-ssi!\u201d\u201cI hate you! I hate you!!\u201dI quite honestly hoped she would heal me instead of screaming. The situation was so urgent, and I couldn\u2019t get up, either.Monsters were running in from the front of them, and Jung Jin-ho and Kim Hyun-sung were fighting with their swords.It seemed that Park Deok-gu had not yet been able to find out whether he should block the front or the back where Yoo Seok-woo was, but he was trying to protect himself as much as possible.\u201cOppa! Oppa!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not dead yet\u2026.\u201d\u201cSister! Ring! Ring! Use the ring quickly! The ring!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oppa! Oppa! Oppa!\u201d\u201cCalm down and use the ring!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dI expected Jung Hayan to panic, but things were a little more serious than I had thought.Only after Park Deok-gu held Jung Hayan\u2019s hand tightly did she remember what she was capable of doing, \u201cOh\u2026 the cure!\u201dThe light came pouring down on me. My body didn\u2019t recover in an instant, but a strangely pleasing light was surely healing my wounds.The pain was still there. However, there was no sensation of tingling and bleeding from the wound.\u2018I almost died.\u2019If it was a little later, I would have bled to death right then and there.\u201cOppa\u2026 Oppa\u2026 Oppa.\u201d\u201cBrother, brother!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026 Ah,\u201d with a slightly trembling body, I look around again.Kim Hyun-sung and Jung Jin-ho were fighting without a word. Whoever saw it, would know that Kim Hyun-sung was stronger.Of course, you couldn\u2019t hear his curses.Eventually, our main villain abandoned Yoo Seok-woo, and Kim Jae-Joon turned his back and ran to leave this place.Kim Hyun-sung, who looked this way for a while, nodded and spoke urgently.\u201cDeok-gu! Please look after Hayan and Kiyoung-ssi. I\u2019m going after Jung Jinho.\u201d\u201cOkay, I see!\u201d he had judged that we would have the ability to organize the situation.As he was quite fast, he disappeared from our view in an instant.Kim Jae-Joon also seemed to be trying to get out of the place immediately as if he understood that the situation was twisted, but that guy also did not take Yoo Seok-woo with him.In this situation, Park Deok-gu could stop the monsters.\u201cThese guys!\u201dOnce again, I could see Yoo Seok-woo swinging his sword. Of course, it didn\u2019t hit me this time because Park Deok-gu struck him with a shield.Puck!Yoo Seok-woo\u2019s body floated through the air and was hit against a wall, but at the same time, monsters rushed to the place.\u201cMagic Shield!\u201dThe second insurance prepared by Kim Hyun-sung blocked their path.At the same time, I was memorizing spells in that instant.Kim Jae-Joon and Jung Jin-ho had already disappeared from view, but Kim Hyun-Sung could not catch both.\u201cHyung-ssi, Hyung-ssi sister is gone\u2026.\u201dJung Hayan had gone to catch Kim Jae-Joon.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Deok-gu. First, take care of the monsters in front of us and follow her immediately. I know where she went.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad then\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t see when and how she disappeared.She prepared a new spell and just followed Kim Jae-Joon.I didn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be able to catch up to the guy with high agility, but seeing that she\u2019s was rushing without any sense of direction, she\u2019ll probably come back after solving her problems.Park Deok-gu\u2019s face was also filled with tears, perhaps because he encountered an unexpected situation. I looked at him and spoke as it seemed to be quite shocking to see me bleeding.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Piglet.\u201d\u201cWho, who cried?\u201dThanks to the guy\u2019s pushing, the dagger got stuck in my body once more, but it wasn\u2019t that bad.* * *\u2018Shit.\u2019It was hard to understand what was going on and why.\u2018Yoo Seok-woo is a stupid guy. He is trash.\u2019There was no hope for him.No, actually, Yoo Seok-woo wasn\u2019t alone in that. The same could go for myself, who accepted Jung Jin-ho\u2019s sword as an attack signal and put a dagger in that other trash.I thought it should have been the right thing.Lee Ki-Cheol was a friend of his who had moved together with him for a long time. He could not control himself because Kiyoung had killed his friend.\u2018I knew the plan was canceled\u2026.\u2019Yet it was all because of that guy who showed a smile while saying sorry. I knew I had to restrain myself, but I couldn\u2019t help it.That expression\u2026.that expression was the problem.That expression that seemed to laugh.That openly provocative look.The problem was how this guy regarded me. He seemed to look down on me from the inside. Still, I left that guy stabbed and helpless.Even in that situation, the moment I saw the expression of that guy watching the situation with a strangely pleasant expression, I couldn\u2019t keep my reason.Jung Jin-ho, that motherfucker was also a problem.In the first place, I thought I had no friendship with him, but I didn\u2019t think that he would throw me away as if I were not important at all.\u2018I do not care.\u2019But that didn\u2019t matter anymore.Anyway, I was with him because I needed him. I used him as much as he used me. It was a simple story.\u2018First.\u2019First off, I need to get out of here.Jung Jin-ho had just decided that there was no opportunity in this situation. As the path was fresh, I could fully follow the path that Jung Jin-ho used to run away.Even now, the traces of him running away were clearly visible. After following Jung Jin-ho, I had to deal with Kim Hyun-sung. This time everything was a lot clearer.Lee Ki-young will not be relieved without tearing and killing the motherfucker.It was just at that time when I tried to move as fast as possible while carrying a bow and arrow, that I noticed something.\u2018What?\u2019It was different from the path I memorized. This was certainly not the way I knew.This was the first time this happened since I changed my job as an archer.I was wondering if there was something wrong with the dungeon itself, but it was certainly not the case. The traces of Jung Jin-ho and Kim Hyun-sung also felt odd.\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201dWhen I looked around a little, I felt a harsh and sudden wind blowing from an unknown direction.\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was after some time that I felt that one of my legs had been cut off.\u201cAhhhhhhhhh!!\u201d\u2018What\u2026. What is this\u2026. what!\u2019I could not make a good judgment. It did not take long for my other leg to get cut off.You were the most afraid when you didn\u2019t know what attacked you.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dAfter the wind blew again, a hand was cut off.\u201cWhat! What\u2026 Ahhhhhhhhh!\u201dWhat came to my mind was magic. As I looked around desperately once again, a woman appeared from the dark, dimly in my sight.I thought it was the first time I saw her, but it was definitely not the first time.\u2018Hayan?\u2019She had a reddened expression.\u2018So snowy\u2026.\u2019Her eyes were weird. Her hair was scattered, and her clothes were messed up. You could see she was wiping the flowing tears with her hands.\u201cI hurt you\u2026 I won\u2019t apologize.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cI can never forgive this\u2026 dummy! I have to kill them all. I have to kill all humans who harm my Oppa.\u201d\u201cWhat bullshit\u2026 Ahhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cYou shut up! And I mean it, shut up! This\u2026 This\u2026 Fool! How painful it must have been for my Oppa.. How painful it must have been! Even when he was first hit\u2026 It must have been painful!\u201dI was quick to figure out the situation. This woman in front of me was not normal.\u2018Fuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026 .\u2019It was in an instant that I realized I was wrong.Although she seemed to be weirdly obsessed with the motherfucker, I couldn\u2019t even imagine she would be this crazy a bitch. I could hear a spell being prepared.No wonder my body first sensed the ominousness.I wanted to get out of this situation by crawling somehow, but there was no way I would get out. This place was too wide to crawl and escape.I could feel the woman\u2019s arms grabbing my hair and lifting my face.\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have time, so I\u2019m so sorry to have to finish it quickly. My Oppa\u2026 I have to return as my Oppa has already suffered dozens of times\u2026 I can\u2019t do anything more\u2026\u201d\u201cHelp me\u2026 I\u2026 I just did what he told me to do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe liars\u2026. Air bomb.\u201dWhat was held in her right hand was magic I had already seen before. The magic that made several monsters turn into lifeless corpses.Unlike the time when it was the size of human heads, what I saw this time was very small.When I couldn\u2019t understand what she was doing, I heard the crazy woman\u2019s voice once again.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 What\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Do it. Dang, you should feel the same way. You should feel how much pain my Oppa felt.\u201dI stubbornly closed my mouth. If something like that came inside\u2026However, the crazy bitch forcibly opened my mouth with her hand and eventually put the small bomb inside. I couldn\u2019t get used to the feeling of a foreign substance as it entered.The cold sweat continued to flow, and my body was trembling.That was when the brain-shaking explosion was heard before I could even begin to imagine what was happening.Bang!\u201cAhhh ae ae ae!\u201dFragments of teeth burst along with the mouth \u2013 the tongue, throat, and cheeks. It was hard to understand what happened, but one thing was certain: the pain seemed to melt my brain.\u201cIs it painful? You are hurt too. But why\u2026 you did it to him!\u201d\u2018Mad girl\u2026 Crazy bitch\u2026 Crazy bitch\u2026 \u201c\u201cYou splattered blood on me, idiot.\u201d\u201cI am alive\u2026 Ahh\u2026.\u201dEven her appearance of tidying up was grotesque.She carefully tidied up the sporadic hair and wiped the blood splattered on her face with her sleeves.\u201cBecause we have to finish it quickly\u2026 This is the last one. You can\u2019t do that next time.\u201d\u2018Please don\u2019t do this.\u2019\u2018Please, it reminds me of hell.\u2019The words weren\u2019t properly spoken out of fear, but my consciousness was getting blurred.When I thought I would be able to live somehow, a voice that was my last, resounded.\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m dead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it was undeniable that I almost died.When I thought about it, it was even more absurd, \u2018I almost died.\u2019According to my thinking, Park Deok-gu should have stopped Kim Jae-Joon before the second attack, and Jung Hayan should have put magic into the healing ring before screaming.I could only say that I was lucky. Because I shed so much blood, my mind had blurred.It was also when I realized that even the smallest elements of my calculations could be ruined, and I realized that I shouldn\u2019t gamble at will.\u2018I should gamble only when necessary\u2026.\u2019I realized that I had to prepare more thoroughly before throwing the dice. It was unfortunate, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. After all, it was normal to panic in a sudden situation.One could suggest that it was a natural reaction for innocent Park Deok-gu or Hayan to have this appearance.Maybe I should be grateful that it was over.This was still a tutorial, and if we compared it to the game, we would still be beginners. Perhaps time will solve the problem of Hayan and Park Deok-gu.\u201cBrother, I\u2026.\u201d\u201cI think I can just hold off Yoo Seok-woo.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Will you be okay?\u201dHe simply nodded.A very rare item, the magic shield ring, protected me.Those who were visible with the mind\u2019s eye had no power to penetrate the magic of this magic shield.Suddenly, I was grateful to Kim Hyun-Sung. The item\u2019s effect was better than I thought.\u2018Magic shield.\u2019\u201cKie-e-e-e-ee-ee-ee-ee-eeI saw monsters constantly tapping on the translucent membrane, but I didn\u2019t feel scared. In the meantime, I started to prepare more spells.\u201cLord, I pray, listen to my voice, answer, burn my enemies, give me strength\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cFireball.\u201dMy head was a little dizzy. This situation was probably because of my low magic power, but probably also because I had bled and lost a lot of blood.The wound was healed, but the damage remained.When I recited the spell, a large fireball appeared in front of my eyes, dismantled the shield of magic, and reached outside.Bang!It was a perfect direct hit, but Park Deok-gu positioned himself in front of me, wondering if there were any survivors.Simply put, I had created destruction.\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201d\u201cHyung-ssi, is your body okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI was a little dizzy, but it was no problem. Rather, it felt very refreshing. It was almost because I died and came back to life, and things were currently running pretty well.Kim Hyun-sung will kill Jung Jin-ho, and Kim Jae-Joon will be held onto by Hayan, having a happy time.What mattered was Yoo Seok-woo.It didn\u2019t mean that they were free and had nothing else to do. However, it was natural that the complete problem should be solved.Park Deok-gu tied that guy up and held him down.That would have been a poor leash, but it was better than none. No, in the first place, he couldn\u2019t break such a leash with the strength he had now.\u201cLet me go! What do you want to do?\u201dYoo Seok-woo had started to resist the moment he came to his senses, but there was no hope for him. He was struggling while lying on the floor, and Park Deok-gu was holding him down with sheer force.\u201cBitch!\u201d\u201cYou, Lee Ki-young, you little mouse! Can\u2019t you release me right now!?\u201d\u201cBitch.\u201d\u201cThe others will come here. Kim Hyun-sung is going to come right here after getting rid of that motherfucker, and stick a knife in your throat. You guys want to be saved? Dream on.\u201dHe was talking willingly, but he couldn\u2019t even say anything else because he was overwhelmed. The world of delusions in his brain was deeper than I thought.\u201cHaha.\u201d\u201cAre you smiling? Is this funny? Do you think you can keep laughing like that? Lee Ki-young! And the pig next to him\u2026 I can\u2019t forgive that Hayan also. Never! I will make you regret it every day\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hear you well?\u201dIt\u2019s no wonder that he was so mad. As I gently brought my hand to my ear, putting my face out, and raised his mouth, the face of the guy biting with anger was visible.\u201cThis\u2026 Lee Ki-young, this trash!\u201dIt is always fun to see such excitement.\u201cYou must be pretty confident.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cThe older brothers you love seem to have abandoned you and run away from everyone.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHave you even heard from Jung Jin-ho? From the time Lee Ki-cheol died, the plan was canceled here\u2026 No, it was that they were getting friendly instead.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA face of embarrassment entered my line of vision. It seemed that he did not know it.This was the scene that I wanted to see.I wouldn\u2019t be able to know this without my \u2018Mind\u2019s Eye,\u2019 or Kim Hyun-sung\u2019s reaction.I would have thought, \u2018You just have to be a little careful moving with a bad group.\u2019I was not very interested in whether I was right or wrong. Looking at his expression, it seemed to have been correct to some extent, but that didn\u2019t matter now.Of course, there was no reason to explain the situation to him.\u201cWhat\u2026 What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cBitch.\u201dI kept laughing. This was so much fun. The way this stupid guy moved reminded me of a doll or a shogi horse.It was fortunate that Jung Jin-ho just thought of him as insurance.\u201cWhat is it like?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dI did not necessarily explain. Instead, I pleasantly smiled, \u2018If you\u2019re not stupid, you\u2019ll know.\u2019However, Yoo Seok-woo just kept staring up at me blankly. Maybe he really was stupid.Since I first suggested attacking the dungeon\u2026 The magic used for blocking the monster wave for the first time, the death of Lee Ki-Cheol, was indeed a little absurd.He may even be realizing that everything was a well-crafted play, even when he had provoked on purpose. The stupid guy was now guessing why I was openly fiddling with Hayan.There was no reason to just laugh at him and have a good time with Hayan. Everything was a petty trap set for himself.He probably won\u2019t even believe he had already taken the bait.No matter how poorly humans controlled their minds, he really was such an anomaly.Park Deok-gu looked at me with a startled expression, but he didn\u2019t necessarily give or ask another explanation. This was because the face of the guy who wanted nothing more than to kill me was still in sight.\u201cThis\u2026 Lee Ki-young, this trash! You\u2019re crap!\u201dIt was laughable that he was waiting for his brothers.Jung Jin-ho decided that his power was insufficient, so he recruited Yoo Seok-woo and came down to the dungeon to create a variable.In conclusion, he was nothing more than that.It was so natural that you could tell even if you thought about it a little coolly. Yoo Seok-woo must also have realized that he made a mistake.\u201cThis\u2026 this!\u201d\u201cThank you, Seokwoo. I am grateful to you.\u201dI wasn\u2019t scared because his hands and feet were already tied up, but I frowned at the fickle, unbecoming scene.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you! I will kill you!\u201d\u201cI can say the same.\u201dTo kill or not, I held the reigns.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI am not a good person. Of course, I am a little reluctant to kill people. But\u2026 seeing that I entered a place like this, I think I need to experience it at least once. You hear me? Experience.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlthough I like to leave it to others\u2026 I can\u2019t borrow someone else\u2019s hand forever, and it\u2019s better to share the original sin.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 You are crazy\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are the same. Even if things were a little more twisted, I would have been lying here. Maybe it would be Hayan or Deok-gu.\u201dI slightly lifted the spear he held in his hand.\u201cHyung-ssi,\u201d A little embarrassing voice rang out.Of course, I had never committed a murder before.Park Deok-gu seemed to be asking if I could do it. Maybe if he held me back, I would have quit here. It was not that easy to do this.Of course, the hand with the spear trembled. It was because I felt afraid to kill a human. On one hand, I already made up my mind, but it was quite difficult to implement.I was different from Hayan, whose personality was a little twisted, or Kim Hyun-sung, who had killed countless numbers of people.To be honest, I was still a little reluctant.Nevertheless\u2026\u2018Natural Selection.\u2019I thought it was most reasonable to experience it here anyway.\u201cAh, save me.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dThe hand holding the spear stopped trembling.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see it, close your eyes, Deok-gu.\u201dI didn\u2019t look at Park Deok-gu\u2019s expression. I thought that he would have closed his eyes.\u201cAh\u2026 Save me!\u201dIn that instant, the spear pierced through his throat. The unpleasant feeling that went through my hands made my body tremble all over.\u201cKek\u2026 Keck\u2026\u201dYoo Seok-woo struggling to speak; nevertheless, his status entered my line of vision. I wanted to turn my head, but I know I couldn\u2019t deny it.I pulled the trigger, the bullet I fired.My arms and legs continued to tremble.It was not the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a person die, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever done it myself.\u2018I can think of it as the same as Park Hye-young.\u2019It was true that I killed him too.No, as a matter of fact, I did kill him. The woman I saw at the start point too, may have been killed by me. I chose to turn away from her when she needed help.There was no need or reason to panic now. I just had to accept the situation as calmly as I did then. It was necessary because it could not be helped.It was not easy to see a life silently die, but\u2026\u201cLord\u2026\u201d\u201cKek\u2026 flesh\u2026 Ryeo\u2026 .\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dHis face was distorted with pain. The damned guy kept trying to speak, and the blood spitting out wasn\u2019t visually pleasing at all.As time passed, his face became more comfortable.\u201cFlesh\u2026 Ryeo\u2026 Um\u2026 hemp\u2026\u201dEventually, the guy who had looked this way became quiet, and silence began to reign over the place.\u201cIf I can do it\u2026 You can do better,\u201d these were the same lines spoken when I first hunted with Park Deok-gu and caught a monster.Unlike the first time, there was no answer in this situation. Instead, a slightly erratic voice came. From Park Deok-gu\u2019s point of view, now was a good time to speak up and divert my attention.\u201cHyung-ssi\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWas he Christian?\u201dAn embarrassing question that doesn\u2019t suit the situation; I laughed and said what I thought.\u201cThere is no such thing as God.\u201d[A new job has been opened.

Of course, it was difficult to obtain valid data, but I had seen stats rise even for personnel in the shelter.I thought about taking various directions for magic to boost my intelligence, and even going so far as to use magic-boosting magic. However, all stats, such as stamina and agility, would continue to stay the same.I thought maybe this job would be similar.[A new job has been opened. Please choose the job you think you need.][View open jobs.][Summoner-Rare Grade][Magician-Rare Grade][Warlock-Rare Grade][Alchemist-Rare Level][Flame Wizard-Rare Grade]\u2018There are so many options.\u2019I was a little worried about what to do if there was a scammer job, but there wasn\u2019t. Rather, I felt very fortunate. I feel like giving points for all rare classes that presented themselves to me.I didn\u2019t take a closer look, but it seemed like no job seemed remotely bad.Above all, I was most fortunate to have no commander class.Of course, this may not be the case, but I was worried that Park Deokgu, who found out about my former job information, would become the commander\u2019s parrot once again. I didn\u2019t say anything, but I thought about it for about three times thanks to Park Deokgu\u2019s words, who made it seem surprisingly appealing at that time.In fact, I still wondered what it would have been like if I chose to be commander. However, I was also a little grateful that I was now completely out of the commander\u2019s grip.I couldn\u2019t see the status window continuously, so I had to focus in order to take a quick look at it.As I glanced at the status window, various information poured out.[Summoner-Rare Grade][Summoner is not a job to go ahead and fight. It is a group of professions that fight using summoned ministries or spirits or exchange contracts. After that, you can change jobs to summoner-related jobs such as Tamer, Elementalist, and Summoner. Health will increase by 1, intelligence by 1, and magic by 2.]\u2018Not bad.\u2019I found myself liking what the Summoner had to offer. The idea of having a spirit fight on my behalf sounded like a great insurance.I didn\u2019t know if I had the talent or affinity that usually came out in novels or games, but seeing that a summoner came out as a job, I thought it would fit my disposition well.[Magician-Rare Grade][This is a medium-range job that uses magic and spears at the same time. Magician, who holds the center of the battlefield, uses magic and spear at the same time to directly influence both large and small battles. Gain intermediate knowledge of spears and magic. The occupational groups in which you can change jobs in the future are unknown. Agility will increase by 2, magic will increase by 2.][Warlock-Rare Grade][This is a ranged job that can use black magic. Black magic is a new level of magic that completely overturns the existing magic\u2019s common sense. Because of the concept of borrowing power from the devil, some religious groups feel strong resistance to black magic, but their destructive power is overwhelmingly higher than that of other professions. Learn basic black magic. Magic will increase by 4.]I would definitely pass up on the Magician.The more I go up, the less I can do. If you swing a spear with weak strength or agility, it wouldn\u2019t be efficient.However, I felt differently for the Warlock. It was also true that the magic stat of +4 can be coveted and could overturn the existing magical common sense.\u201cHmm.\u201dHowever, I was a little worried about making people feel the backlash from religious groups.If the place I\u2019d go to after the tutorial was a fantasy world based on the Middle Ages, maybe a crazy religious group would form a mob and chase after me.The safest thing for me to be in such a situation is, after all, a specification.[Alchemist-Rare Level][Alchemist is a profession that basically studies and studies magic chemistry. They are always looking for new directions and developments in magic, magic, and magic. Homunculus Alchemy knowledge and basic knowledge of alchemy are acquired.

This is a long-range job that supports allies with strong firepower. Although it consumes a lot of magic, its firepower is beyond imagination. It will surprise enemies and allies alike. After that, you can change your job as an explosion wizard or bomb magic expert. Magic will increase by 5.]Of course, flame magic experts passed unconditionally.There was no room to think about it. The fact that it boosted magic by 5 already earned it points, and the words of firepower beyond imagination also attracted attention.It could be used well once or twice, and the shortcomings were obvious, but somehow it felt like it wasn\u2019t bad all in all.\u2018Alchemist?\u2019In fact, even the alchemist doesn\u2019t look so bad.In the first place, it can be said that it suited me best with high intelligence compared to magic.Although my combat ability seemed to be a bit inferior to other occupations, occupations like homunculus expert, alchemy magic, and some suspicious drug maker seemed to be able to fill my lack of magic.One thing that can definitely be excluded is Magician. All other jobs had their own strengths and weaknesses. I thought it would be a little easier than the first choice, so I felt stupid.The choice now was far more important than when I had to choose before. One could even compare it to choosing one\u2019s major in college!My head hurt at the thought that this one choice might determine my position moving forward. Of course, it was not urgent, so we could wait a bit more. But among the numerous majors, worries began to emerge.That was when I heard a voice right next to me.\u201cHyung?\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019m sorry, Deokgu. I have to go looking for something first.\u201d\u201cDid you get a new job?\u201d\u201cHuh. Yes, although it\u2019s a little sudden. It seems that even if you kill the same human, your experience will increase.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I saw Park Deokgu struggling with his words.Fortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to be shocked. I was worried if he began to think of something else, but fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like that.Until now, I used to call him a muscle-brain, but now I had second doubts about that.Of course, they didn\u2019t narrow in on him, but on me as well. I had been trying my best, but today\u2019s memories would probably be unforgettable.Deokgu also decided to accept the situation. He opened his mouth again in an attempt to stifle the suffocating silence.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Hyung Kim Hyunsung is safe.\u201d\u201cOf course they will be safe. For Kim Hyunsung, of course, I can say that much.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so sure? Is it because of that magical power?\u201d\u201cSimilar. It\u2019s harder to detect as the distance increases, but maybe you can understand to some extent if you also have magical power.\u201dOf course, it didn\u2019t mean that they were automatically safe by magical detection. If you were to think about their specs and tendencies, then the answer would come.One was a returner, and the other was a genius wizard and a monster. I was already quite sure they were finished with their work and were coming this way.As expected, I took a little step. I could see a familiar figure.As soon as we had a closer look at her, I admitted it was a little cute to see her running with her big eyes open, but it wasn\u2019t that nice to see the blood on her sleeves.\u201cOppa\u2026 oppa! Oppa! Oppa!\u201dHer usual act of running up to me and hugging me tightly felt a little more intense than usual. The fact that she had the energy to worry this much about me made me feel a little better.\u201cWhere were you injured? Are you sick? Are you okay now? Ugh\u2026 Yoo Seok-woo\u2026 That\u2026 How does that person even\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\u201cAh, ah, ah. That\u2019s fortunate.\u201dI didn\u2019t think Hayan would be shocked, but it felt a little disconcerting to see her accept this fact so calmly.I didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion or not, but I daresay there was a hint of regret.Rather than asking why she was looking closely at the scene came from, all the while sweeping dust off of her clothes.\u201cSister, where did you go?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 That\u2026 Without knowing\u2026\u201d Quite frankly, this conversation sounded dumb at the moment.I didn\u2019t bother trying to contribute to it at the moment.For now, I was trying my hardest not to be reminded of what I had done.However, it felt quite rude not to give acknowledgment to what I had noticed. With a face that sported my embarrassment, I thought that I should speak again, and opened my mouth,\u201cYou went to help Hyunsung, right?\u201d\u201cNo, oppa. That\u2026 it\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m not very interested\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Mr. Hyunsung.\u201dYou are reacting more obviously than you would want to think.It seemed like she hated to be misunderstood about her true intentions, but of course, I did not bother asking further.\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 So angry\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI just felt so angry with that person\u2026 I did it without knowing it.\u201dIn fact, it was Yoo Seok-woo who put the sword in the ship first, but Jung Hayan did not see the scene properly. It was even more impressive to see the guy who hit me with a fist or put a dagger on his back, dare to try it again.Tears started to build up in my eyes once again as I remembered the memories back then.Recognizing my expression for what it was, Park Deokgu looked at me with a very embarrassed expression. It didn\u2019t look very suitable for a Gangwon-do Casanova. I could see his line of thought clear as day.\u2018He\u2019s still trying to play love doctor at this stage\u2026?\u2019\u201cNo, no. no. I guess you know what you\u2019re talking about, sister. In fact, I also wanted to run out right now\u2026 hyung, do that, but how can you\u2026\u201d\u201cHm. That\u2019s too\u2026 I keep thinking about it\u2026\u201d\u201cSister, everything is fine now, so don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. Now that it\u2019s all over\u2026 You and your hyung are both okay, can\u2019t you see?\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cGosh\u2026 Hyung! How can you\u2026 My eyes were swollen already\u2026 How is this\u2026.\u201dWhen I saw the guy gently looking at this side and asking for comfort, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It felt like the pounding in my head had slowly begun to clear.In the end, I could see my shoulders shake as I hugged the girl slightly according to her wish.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Oppa\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t know what she was sorry for, but I continued to pat her back.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Oppa!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dRather, I should have responded with a thank you. This feeling felt warm to the touch.I feel a little better when I was dirty.It was when I looked at Park Deokgu slightly while comforting Hayan did I see the guy sporting a strange smile.\u2018That pig\u2026\u2019No matter how much I thought about it, it was ridiculous. Of course, Jung Hayan had calmed down, and he started smiling in response.Of course, it was not the warm smile that came from seeing me with Hayan.\u2018Is it a scheme\u2026?\u2019This ominous feeling was similar to how I felt when I faced Yoo Seok-woo.\u2018That\u2026\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s a very good pair, sister.\u201dGangwon-do loved doctor Park Deokgu.I had to do something to try and see if my hunch was true or false.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe smiling face of Park Deokgu seemed very transparent to me. I roughly knew what he was thinking.He seemed to think that I now felt a lot more refreshed. I believe his intention was to distract me with an entirely different set of feelings, this time, romantic. However, this was not a good thing for me.Because his solution came in the form of a trembling girl in my arms.\u201cOppa\u2026\u201dDuring the time I\u2019ve known Park Deokgu, I could tell that he hardly thought about himself. He would soon rather focus on the welfare of others than even his own body odor.Perhaps if Kim Hyunsung had not arrived in time, he would not have been doing that for hours.\u201cYou are here.\u201dHe came a little later than I originally thought. In fact, I expected him to arrive earlier than Hayan.He looked relieved to see us all in one piece. However, the battle with Jung Jin-ho wasn\u2019t as easy as it looked, what with his clothes being slightly burned, as well as the small stab mark on his cheek.Kim Hyunsung had the specs that could warrant him being called a monster, but Jung Jin-ho was also not far from him.\u2018Monsters.\u2019However, it was probably one-sided. No matter how long Jung Jin-ho flew, the difference between their basic stats and experience was clear.Only the variables in magic could have made a difference.Looking at Hyunsung\u2019s expression, it seemed that Jung Jin-ho was no longer alive.\u201cThe others\u2026\u201d he trailed off. This was a slightly sensitive question.Before Hayan could open her mouth to speak, I hurried to talk.\u201cI killed them.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dOf course, I wasn\u2019t going to accuse Jung Hayan of being a murderer here. It was a cleaner choice to admit to even her kills at this point than have her wallow in regret for what she did.Kim Hyunsung was a guy who had a tendency to be a bona fide mediator, but he knew better than me that he shouldn\u2019t keep these people alive.\u201cJung Jin-ho\u2026\u201dAt my slight prodding, he nodded without saying anything.Park Deokgu\u2019s expression was a little gloomy, and I was sure my and Hayan\u2019s faces would have sported similar expressions.The whole party felt a little daunting overall.Of course, in the case of Jung Hayan, it was a little different, but it was natural to assume that she\u2019d be depressed by the shock of her first murder.Eventually, Kim Hyunsung nodded and opened his mouth, \u201cIt was necessary.\u201dThis trusted party leader had begun to take care of his colleagues\u2019 mentality.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\u201cI seemed to have been aiming for this from the beginning. It is not known how they took over Seok-woo, but it seems that Seok-woo also joined their plan in the middle of it. Perhaps if we were successfully targeted, those in the shelter would not have been safe either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt may be difficult, but I want you to know that you did the right thing.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cYou did the right thing. Maybe this will become more frequent in the future. This place we are in is just a tutorial and it might be harsher outside. It must have been difficult, but no one will criticize this decision. Not only now, but also in the future. I don\u2019t know if this comforts you, but\u2026 I hope you overcome it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Thank you as well.\u201dIt was a great speech in its own way. In fact, Kim Hyunsung was correct.None of us ever did anything wrong.If we let them live, not only would the shelter become dangerous, but they would also have created many victims after going outside.Even though Yoo Seok-woo became a foothold for my unpleasant experience, what Kim Hyunsung said was an undeniable fact.\u2018You removed the trash.\u2019There was no reason to feel guilty.\u201cIs Ki-young okay?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Maybe if I didn\u2019t have the ring that Mr. Hyunsung gave me as a gift\u2026 I should have already died. I was saved twice. I will not forget this grace.\u201d\u201cThe wound is\u2026\u201d\u201cFine. I was completely healed.\u201dAfter I finished speaking, Kim Hyunsung seemed to feel a little better. There was no reason to impress him at this point, as things had already worked out the way he wanted it to be.I didn\u2019t know what he was thinking in detail, but I felt a little proud of what we managed to accomplish.We dealt with the group of Jung Jin-ho as planned, and because of that, we even got something better than we expected.We might have thought of each other as colleagues who decided to move together for the time being, but it seemed that this incident has helped us become closer.It was the same for me.We suffered together, went through a crisis together, and overcame it together.I was sure that we four will certainly have a good relationship, even if we went outside.Just imagining that you were riding on a stable and comfortable Kim Hyunsung bus would make you feel drowsy.No, that wasn\u2019t the right word. It would make you feel relaxed.Even though Park Deokgu and Hayan were already safe, there were also other things to focus on, such as our current statuses.\u201cYou seem a little tired, so for now, I think it would be better to take a rest nearby.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s good too. So is my Hyung\u2026 Because your sister also looks a little tired.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn the case of Hayan, I knew she still had some amount of magic within her.I roughly nodded and turned towards Kim Hyunsung, who started to walk towards us. From his expression, I knew he knew it as well.Of course, it was up to me to choose, but I thought it was natural to think of Kim Hyunsung as someone who knew the future.\u201cHyunsung.\u201d\u201cYes. You tell me.\u201d\u201cA new job has opened up.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dOf course, his expression was a pretty happy one.\u201cYou\u2019ve caught up fast.\u201d\u201cYes. Somehow I used magic to catch monsters\u2026\u201d\u201cWould I be able to hear what jobs are open?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dPark Deokgu, as well as Jung Hayan, looked at me with expressions that showed interest.It was a good topic to talk about while looking for a place to rest for the night, and I was also interested in finding suitable materials that can cozy up the atmosphere of our little party.\u201cSummoner, Wizard, Warlock, Alchemist, and Flame Wizard. There are many options.\u201d\u201cIt certainly seems like a lot.\u201dSince there wasn\u2019t a suitable place nearby, I started talking about the shortcomings of each job and what I planned on choosing later.For example, a flame mage needed a lot of magic, or in the case of a magician, there was no job that you couldn\u2019t go after.I hadn\u2019t revealed the exact stats yet, but maybe Kim Hyunsung knew how much spec I had.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Kiyoung has a little magical power\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know in detail since I haven\u2019t met the other wizards, but the magical power itself seems to be low. It doesn\u2019t seem that high compared to Hayan\u2019s.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dIt was essential to disclose a certain amount of personal information for a detailed consultation.There was no reason to hide what was lacking if they had the goal to craft them into advantages.\u201cProbably, in the case of a flame wizard, it would be better to think a little more. It doesn\u2019t seem that the compatibility between Ki-young and the Flame Wizard is bad, but if you aim for high magic power, there will be room for problems later.\u201d\u201cOh, I have a similar idea.\u201dPark Deokgu looked really cute, trying to piece together the bits of information he was receiving. I didn\u2019t know how old he was, but I knew for sure that he was younger than me.\u201cMagician too\u2026.\u201dI knew I shouldn\u2019t speak so openly, but I couldn\u2019t help but put in my two cents.\u2018You\u2019re not good at chanting.\u2019Still, I thought that I had been playing the role for one person enough, but my acting was certainly not that polished.Anyway, Magician was one job that I did not plan to choose, but seeing Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expression like that, I began to have second thoughts.\u2018Now, I\u2019m even more confused than before.\u2019\u201cPersonally, it looks a little better to choose from Summoner, Alchemist, and Warlock, but it\u2019s hard being a Warlock, so I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but you could be in a dangerous situation. At least Lee Sang-chang doesn\u2019t lie to us.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need magical power to keep your familiar, but I don\u2019t know how much magical power you need. Rather, it seems that the alchemist is not bad. It will be appropriate for Ki-young, who has high intelligence.\u201d\u201cActually, I was thinking similarly. It seems that alchemy may trigger magic complete with a catalyst\u2026\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be as bad as you think it is. You can make potions and many more. If you need a pet, there is also an alternative method called \u2018Homunculus\u2019 afterwards, which will be more advantageous. A creature created other than a summoned creature will not have much magic power.\u201dAs Kim Hyunsung spoke, his excitement rose. As such, I thought that his recommendation was also reliable.Above all, seeing his expression of giddy happiness, I began to feel more and more inclined. After all, those who have the profession of Alchemist were rare.Occupations may not have been well received, or people may not have a good choice, but anyway, the Alchemist profession itself is seldom obtained.Similarly, assuming that priests are also rare, the value of potions will increase a little more.If you consider that there are limits to the divine power of a priest in the first place, a quality potion is a must.Summoners are also attractive, but if you think about having two similar ones, you might be able to get other summons afterward.At this point, my thoughts went all over the place.Park Deokgu, who had been listening to the party\u2019s ramblings for a long time, shook his head and participated in this consultation.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course, if you are a true hyung, you should be a warlock.\u2018\u2026\u2019\u201cWhen I think of a warlock who exterminates the monsters by sprinkling the power of darkness, of course, I can only think that he fits Ki-young very well\u2026 Doesn\u2019t he resemble a warlock in the making?\u201dThere was no logic behind Park Deokgu\u2019s words, but he spoke as if he truly believed in what he said. He seemed to have forgotten his earlier insistence for the Commander class.This time, he seemed to be stuck on the idea of me becoming a warlock.\u201cWell, what does it matter what the public thinks? I think it doesn\u2019t matter much because I\u2019ll blow away the guys who are looking for you. My hyung\u2019s character and the warlock don\u2019t really match, but imagine him wearing a black robe\u2026 I think it would be cool just to imagine!\u201d\u201cThe Alchemist would be a better option.\u201dAt this point, Kim Hyunsung\u2019s voice also became quite urgent.He noticed that Park Deokgu had a strange resonance in his cry.\u201cNo! My Hyung is a warlock by nature!\u201dPark Deokgu, who was previously a commander parrot, suddenly began to evolve into a warlock parrot.\u201cAlchemist is definitely better.\u201d\u201cUnconditionally a Warlock!\u201d\u201cAlchemist\u2026 .\u201d\u201cThe Warlock! I want to see Ki-young displaying the power of darkness.\u201d\u201cAlchemist!\u201d\u201cWarlock!\u201d\u201cPension!\u201d\u201cBlack!\u201d\u201cKite!\u201d\u2018They\u2019re making no sense at this point.\u2019I thought this situation would come again for some reason, but it was embarrassing to see the two heated up more than ever.Somehow, the power of darkness appealed strongly to Park Deokgu\u2019s heart.As he turned his gaze to Jung Hayan in the same manner as one would ask a doctor for confirmation, Jung Hayan also shook her head vigorously.\u201cI can\u2019t choose either. An intelligent oppa who practices alchemy, or an oppa who uses the power of darkness?\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t ask for that.Nevertheless, this unidentified debate seemed to be getting more and more intense.In the end, Kim Hyunsung had to resort to opening his bag.\u201cVery accidentally\u2026 Quite accidentally\u2026 This is the product you found. It looks like an Alchemist-only item. If you choose to become an Alchemist, I\u2019ll give you this as a gift.\u201d\u2018Where did that come from?\u2019Now. I could say for sure that the leather bag Kim Hyunsung carried was a magic bag. I couldn\u2019t even imagine he would bring out such an item so urgently.Thanks to this, I could be sure that the Warlock\u2019s perception would not be very good, but apart from that, the moment we checked the item he pulled out, we ended up having to abandon our party\u2019s, Warlock Parrot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a member of the Republic\u2019s military, he has earned his reputation as a leader in the field of biological and potion synthesis, but it is known that it was all purged one day for some reason.Although he died, the knowledge he left behind is still being passed on.Ramus Tucker\u2019s Introduction to Alchemy is one of the highly complete books that can be seen as a compilation of his research work. It contains a variety of alchemy knowledge not included in Basic Alchemy Knowledge.Acquires knowledge of hero grade alchemy that is unknown as a basic class. Magic increases by 1, intelligence by 1.]\u2018Hero level?\u2019Since this item was currently in front of me, it did not seem unreasonable to forsake Park Deokgu\u2019s enthusiasm.In fact, it cannot be said that there would be so many stats to raise.1 Magic and 1 intelligence.However, since the item\u2019s value was said to be of the hero level, I expected that it would contain more knowledge than I imagined.As Kim Hyunsung said: Ji-Chang does not lie.If that book is a hero-graded item, it will surely contain the corresponding knowledge.\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt felt a little embarrassing as to how this item came out so suddenly. Looking at Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face, he seemed to realize that he also made a mistake.It was natural to make mistakes as he was also a human being, but even he seemed confused about how he had just exposed himself.\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d\u201cIt was the book that was in the box at that time. I thought there was nothing to it at first, but now it seemed like a good timing\u2026\u201d\u201cBut Hyung would look better as a warlock\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hero-grade item. I couldn\u2019t read this book because I\u2019m not an alchemist, but it\u2019s probably more than expected. If you think about it being an item just below the legend level, this would be your best bet. Most of all, these items are not corrupt.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026 The Warlock\u2026 Hyung\u2026\u201dEven in this situation, Park Deokgu kept muttering about me being a Warlock.It sounded ridiculous to me.There was a high probability that the ring that was given to us in the first place, or the bracelet presented to Park Deokgu, were also items that cannot be normally found here.The story that a treasure chest suddenly popped out from somewhere sounded suspicious to me.Even if you tried it a hundred times and obtained it without an accident, it is certainly not convincing to have such a book here.However, after looking at Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face, I could guess that he was still trying to keep up his innocent fa\u00e7ade.I didn\u2019t know if he was using some type of inventory, or if he was using something akin to a store that was not open to us yet, but I thought that leather bag contained more than what met the eye.There were so many explanations to consider. Even if one were to look at it, the explanations I had thought up for its validity didn\u2019t seem all that unusual.Thinking that it was meaningless to worry any more, I immediately nodded.\u201cActually, although the Warlock was appealing, I think Alchemists would be good.\u201dOnly then did Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face begin to light up.\u201cYou chose well.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d[You have changed your job as an Alchemist.

I have nothing to say, but seeing your hard work makes my heart ache. Yes. Really. It seems to you that you have gotten some undeserved items. We hope you have the ability to understand Ramus Tucker\u2019s alchemy. Hero-grade items are too precious to simply be used as a display.]After my body flashed in a blue light for a moment, I could see that I had definitely changed my job.In an instant, the knowledge of the basic alchemy poured into my head.\u2018Not bad.\u2019It was difficult, but not to the extent where I couldn\u2019t understand. When I smiled satisfyingly, Kim Hyunsung seemed to sport a different expression.It seemed that his internal evaluation of my worth had risen considerably. It must have changed from a usable administrator to an Alchemist who needed to be well raised.\u2018That actually spells good news.\u2019That means that I have become precious to whatever his plans were.\u201cCongratulations, Mr. Ki-young.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Unfortunately, only if Hyung\u2019s choice was\u2026\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Oppa.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you, Deokgu and Hayan. I will be grateful for the gift, Mr. Hyunsung. You just keep giving them to us so generously.\u201dIn truth, I received this gift thanks to Park Deokgu\u2019s insistence.\u201cNo. If Ki-young becomes stronger, it is natural that our entire party will also become stronger. Rather, I feel better because I can help.\u201d\u201cI will meet your expectations.\u201dOf course, as long as this was the case, one had to work to continually meet the leader\u2019s standards.As much as Kim Hyunsung felt compelled to invest in me, he would continue to invest only if I continued to give such results.As such, I was his current investment.Kim Hyunsung put money in an investment called Lee Ki-young, and he must be hoping that he\u2019d get his money\u2019s worth.Even if I fell to the bottom, he wouldn\u2019t abandon me, but it would be natural to assume that he would stop trying to invest in me.In order to continue being invested in, I had to continually show that I was getting better.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Haha. For now, let\u2019s rest here. If you can\u2019t see a suitable place after walking this much, it seems that there is no place to camp in the dungeon.\u201d\u201cYeah. I will do that. Deokgu?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come after cleaning up the surroundings.\u201dHyunsung nodded roughly in response. This place was uninhabited, but it was still right to clean up the surroundings.Even the long tutorial felt like it would soon come to an end.Although the survival quest had not yet been completed, it felt correct to guess that Kim Hyunsung was not showing much impatience, so this dungeon strategy must actually be the final stage.Whether it was finding the entrance or taking care of the dungeon\u2019s owner, this party would go through it successfully.As I turned my head a little, their images appeared in my view.I laughed when I saw Jung Hayan, who was dozing off, and Park Deokgu, who was already snoring.On the other hand, I didn\u2019t fall asleep even though I knew I had to sleep for tomorrow.No, to be precise, I couldn\u2019t sleep at all, even if I wanted to.\u2018Alchemy.\u2019This was because I had to organize my new knowledge.First of all, this was not an ability I could use right away. In order to perform alchemy earnestly, various types of equipment were required. There was no catalyst here that could use alchemy magic.However, it was also natural to study in advance. As it took time to organize basic alchemy knowledge, Ramus Tucker\u2019s Introduction to Alchemy has decided not to unfold itself to me yet.\u201cAre you not going to sleep?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201dTo survive, you had to level yourself up.It would be appropriate to say that this passion was created by the idea that I should not settle down in one place, of course, to train myself.There was nothing like potion softness, basic knowledge about Homunculus, and the correlation between alchemy catalyst and magic.I felt Kim Hyunsung staring at my side, but of course, he was not aware that I noticed his gaze. I could feel the high hopes and expectations that he began to place on me.\u2018I\u2019m working hard, investor,\u2019 it was an advantage to show such bravado on my part.I felt more satisfied when I saw Kim Hyunsung nodding with a satisfactory expression.It felt like it happened in no time at all, but soon, morning came. I couldn\u2019t even find it in myself to sigh, but I didn\u2019t regret not sleeping at all.The party members slowly woke up and began to stir up a small, steady stream of chattering.Rather than a gloomy atmosphere, it felt a little relaxing.In the middle of the way, Kim Hyunsung threw a joke, and Park Deokgu laughed at the joke as if we weren\u2019t currently in a dungeon.Kim Hyunsung seemed to have given himself some time to rest.\u2018There is no dungeon boss?\u2019From the looks of it, probably not.Hyunsung was vigilant enough, but he wasn\u2019t looking for a horrific battle.\u2018It\u2019s just the beginning.\u2019It was not over yet.At first, it seemed like a hassle to walk around so much, but this party gradually managed to escape this hellish place.Sometimes battles happened, but they weren\u2019t all that dangerous.After walking for a while, I could see a slightly different entrance in front of me.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a monster popping out.\u201d\u201cI will enter after preparing for battle.\u201d\u201cHyung, let me take the lead.\u201d\u201cPlease do.\u201dA large door opened, and a familiar voice rang through my ears.[Rare-grade forced quest is activated.][Rare Grade Quest Strategy (0/1)]We looked around as soon as we got in, but there seemed to be no monsters.What we saw in front of us was a place that looked like a temple.A strange magic circle could be seen in the center, and another door was seen on the other side.Park Deokgu ran to the door and tried to push it, but the door did not open.\u201cThe door doesn\u2019t seem to open.\u201d\u201cMaybe there are some conditions we need to meet. Leaving out of this place would be a sound strategy.\u201dIt was then that I thought that the situation changed a little.Unlike me, Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan both hesitated a little, and Kim Hyunsung slowly raised his hand as if he were seeing something very familiar.Magical power was gently sent to the magic circle in the center, and the magic circle in the center soon began to emit light.Looking around me now, it seemed a little funny seeing everyone so transfixed on the light.\u201cThis is\u2026 magic.\u201dThere was no such thing as a great quiz in the form of a monster we needed to attack.The answer to the quiz was magical power itself, which can be said to be a medium far from where we lived.[Rare-level compulsory quest has been completed.][Rare Grade Quest-Strategy (1/1)][Rare Grade Quest-Survival (1/1)]\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s expression with clenched fists showed that he seemed to have done something. He didn\u2019t show much of his emotions, but from what I could see, what he had been doing seemed to be going as planned.At first glance, he actually seemed to be crying, but this wasn\u2019t the case at all.Unlike the intermittently trembling shoulders, there was a tremendous sense of accomplishment just from the subtle facial expressions, so I knew I was right.\u201cIt\u2026 it looks so pretty.\u201d\u201cIt does.\u201dThe light finally gave way to what seemed to be an intricately designed palace.The lights emanating from the ground rose above the high ceiling, and the lights above the ceiling filled up the place.Looking at the door on the other side slowly opening, I could see that I was really leaving this dungeon.Sunlight completely different from artificially created light began to pour out.\u2018Sunshine.\u2019It was not the landscape that we automatically focused on, but those carrying armor and weapons. I saw a woman who seemed to be a representative approaching quietly.\u201cCongratulations on your life in the tutorial. I\u2019m Lee Sang-hee, and I\u2019m in charge of this tutorial dungeon.\u201dWe survived. It took us a moment to realize that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Lee Sang-hee, and I\u2019m in charge of this tutorial dungeon,\u201d Lee Sang-hee\u2019s tone was quite polite.Upon looking at her quietly bowing her head and smiling slightly in our direction, I at least could see that Lee Sang-hee and the other people with her did not harbor hostile feelings toward us.On the contrary, the atmosphere felt a little friendly.\u201cWhat do you mean by being in charge of the tutorial dungeon?\u201d\u201cTake it by its literal meaning. As a sub-guild master of the Free Guild of the Benigoa Empire, Blue, I am managing the tutorial dungeon for this episode.\u201d\u201cDo you mean you have called us here?\u201d\u201cNo. We are also in the same position as you. One day, I was suddenly summoned to a tutorial dungeon and went through the same test. We just came here a little earlier than you. I don\u2019t know why this happened, or why the summoning ceremony began.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cOur mission is to take you after this tutorial dungeon is over and rescue the survivors who are still inside. Moreover, it is important not only to adapt and educate you, who have to live in a new environment, but also to guarantee a basic living right.\u201d\u201cYou mean the basic living space?\u201d\u201cYeah. This is a basic living area.\u201d\u201cI see. Does this mean that you can only enter this place after the attack is over?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The tutorial dungeon door is open for about 3 days right after the attack. After exactly 3 days, the dungeon door will close again. We still haven\u2019t figured out why, but\u2026 Anyway, you\u2019re here. Let\u2019s go inside before we divulge a more detailed story.\u201dSimply put, I felt dumbstruck. I had never imagined that I would be able to experience this kind of a world. Moreover, there was something about Lee Sang-hee\u2019s attitude that I couldn\u2019t fathom.[Check player Lee Sang-hee\u2019s status window and talent level.][Name-Lee Sang-hee][Title-Iron Blood][Age-33][ALIGNMENT-Ideal Mediator][Occupation-Sacred Knight][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of Basic Sword Skills][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of Basic Shield Knowledge][Occupational Effect-Intermediate Swordsmanship Knowledge Acquisition][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of Advanced Sword Skills][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of Basic Divine Knowledge][Occupational Effects-Intermediate Divine Knowledge Acquisition][Capacity][Strength -82/Growth Limit: Hero or higher][Dexterity-52Growth Limit: Rare or higher][Health-90/Growth Limit: Hero or less][Intellect -30/Growth Limit: Normal or less][Endurance-91/Growth Limit: Hero or higher][Good Luck -33/Growth Limit: Rare or less][Magic -77/Growth Limit: Rare or higher][Equipment][Saint Caliber-Hero class][Iron-Blooded Shield-Hero Grade-Knight Only][Strength Band-Rare Grade][Talent-Iron Blood][Overall review-The stats themselves are very good.

The same went for the other people with her.Judging from the stats, there was a difference between us that could not even be compared. If they wanted to, they could kill us in the blink of an eye.Nevertheless\u2026\u2018Act friendly.\u2019I felt like I was acting too amicably. No, it felt like I was trying to lower my pride for the sake of pleasing them.\u201cHwayeon?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cLet me start searching for the survivors inside. It\u2019ll take some time to find them.\u201d\u201cYes. Okay.\u201dSeeing the soldiers entering the dungeon, I thought it would only be a matter of time before all the other people, including Lee Ji-hye in the shelter, would be rescued.Here, I could see people of all ethnicities, not just Koreans.When I compared what we were wearing to theirs, it felt like it was us who had adapted to an outdated style, while they were the modernized people. They probably thought of themselves as the locals of this world.While walking on the street and looking around warily, Lee Sang-hee opened her mouth to speak.Kim Hyun-sung replied to her, and from my distance, it was hard to hear what they were talking about. I thought that it would be better to listen to their conversations and gather information rather than participate in the conversation in person, so I drew nearer and quietly listened to their voices.\u201cYou seem to have completed the attack very quickly.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it usually like this?\u201d\u201cYes. Usually, the attack ends in about six months. It is certainly unusual to complete a dungeon attack within three months. Perhaps the dungeons here were attacked much faster than the dungeons elsewhere.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean there are other dungeons?\u201d\u201cYes. Several tutorial dungeons are also managed by the Republic or Kingdom Alliance. In the Holy Empire of Benigore, where we belong, we manage a total of three tutorial dungeons. It\u2019s not just Koreans. Races of various nationalities are usually summoned at their designated locations and take the tutorials.\u201d\u201cI see. This is the fastest way for us to attack the dungeon.\u201d\u201cFor an easier explanation, then yes. It\u2019s usually taboo to ask what happened inside, but I\u2019m really curious about how you were able to break through it so quickly. That too\u2026 A small group of only four people.\u201d\u201cThere were many circumstances. It\u2019s hard to tell everyone, but\u2026 There wasn\u2019t a big crowd. It was a possible strategy because the people that\u2019re with me \u2013 that is, Lee Kiyoung, Jung Hayan, and Park Deokgu \u2013 played their roles very efficiently. Oh, and there\u2019s also a makeshift camp on the ground floor. Please rescue the personnel there as well.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shelter that we made. I took the survivors who I knew could fight, and I left people who couldn\u2019t hunt. We ran a separate raid team. We\u2019ve built and operated a bunch of walls in a safe place, so they\u2019re probably still alive. We also made sure there was enough food.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Lee Sang-hee once again sported an unreadable expression upon hearing Kim Hyunsung\u2019s explanation.\u2018Mm-hm,\u2019 now, some things began to make sense to me. I was beginning to comprehend what exactly the circumstances surrounding us are.\u201cThat\u2026 I see.\u201dLee Sang-hee\u2019s expression showed that she was struggling to keep up with the poker-faced fa\u00e7ade.\u2018Kim Hyun-sung, you fox.\u2019Perhaps the ace and protagonist of our party had been trying to hide his true power by disguising it with verbal humility and commendable acting.As I swung back and looked at the tutorial dungeon, I saw people back from the dungeon appearing one by one.They seemed to be the types of people who chose to hide by themselves, not with the group we had left.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that they could maintain their bravado. Some people were crying, and others were anxiously asking where this place was. It was normal to feel this way, after all.Even the attitudes of those who were armed compared to others who weren\u2019t, were strangely different from this debacle.They all looked a little coercive, and were looking down.\u201cWhere is this? I thought\u2026 why\u2026?\u201d\u201cMom\u2026 Mom\u2026 Uh huh\u2026\u201d\u201cThis will allow us to regroup later right away. I\u2019ll give you a valid explanation later. First, we must go outside together. Hey! Hey there! Can you not quiet down?!\u201d\u201cHey! Where are we?! Where is this place?!\u201d\u201cHey! Let us out now! \u201d\u201cLet us go!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 Where is this?\u201d\u201cI told you that I can give explanations once we have all been settled down. Please control yourselves. First of all, you must all calm down! You are safe. There is no more danger. Please calm down.\u201d\u2018Good.\u2019How they treated the other survivors were totally different from how they had treated us. After all, theirs were the general reactions.It would be common to cry, blow, and panic asking for help. However, our party was a little different.Kim Hyunsung, who seemed too calm, as well as Jung Hayan, were just sticking to my side and were not responding to the new and noisier environment.The same could be said for Park Deokgu, which was a surprise considering his stressful tendency to relentlessly ask questions.From Lee Sang-hee\u2019s point of view, it might be a little embarrassing to show our true, weird personalities at this point in time.After all, this was the party that had cleared the tutorial dungeons spread all over the world in the shortest time, and with only four people!That wasn\u2019t even all.In addition to being visibly calm, we had also used our wits enough to form a makeshift shelter for the rest of our fellow survivors.I understand how Lee Sang-hee could also feel embarrassed upon her initial treatment of us.The way they regarded us differed from how they treated those who chose to \u2018survive\u2019 without fighting, hiding, and running away.Just by participating as a target team in the first place meant that you could adapt well to this environment.If this was a system that centered on a republic and on guilds, then the locals here must have been looking for people who could conform to their society. I didn\u2019t know if this was an appropriate example, but it was like we were rookie sports players whose worth had all risen, and people like Lee Sang-hee were the clubs that were trying to scout us.Assuming that there weren\u2019t many players like us, there was one thing you can expect if the number of clubs was high.\u2018We are the best.\u2019Right now, we were the rare players they needed on the team. This would also explain why Kim Hyunsung was trying his best to hide his true talent until now.Like a cunning fox, it seemed that he wanted to raise our worth even higher by explaining what we had done in a manner that seemed as if doing all these was natural to us.If you were going to sell, you might as well bring up the price to the highest attainable range.Of course, there was no way for us to know what Kim Hyunsung\u2019s plan was right now, but I knew it had something to do with how we were going to be regarded in this world.I couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u2018Feel so good. I knew I made the right choice.\u2019\u201cCome in.\u201dThe room where Lee Sang-hee guided us to had a luxurious interior. Its design was so colorful and vibrant that it was hard to believe something like this could be situated so near a dull dungeon.\u201cThe drink\u2026 Oh, if necessary, we will serve you meals as well.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything we can eat?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a little different from what you eat on Earth, but it\u2019s probably much better than what you eat in the dungeon.\u201d\u201cThen please.\u201dThe blue flag and props in the room seemed to try their best to show the status of the blue guild managing this dungeon as much as they possibly could.I felt like I\u2019d been too observant today.I also didn\u2019t know what my next plan would be. Do I try to make myself seem as elusive as possible to increase my own worth? But then again, what about Kim Hyunsung\u2019s plan?\u201cAh. Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t catch your names. If it isn\u2019t too much of a bother, may I ask for your names?\u201d\u201cI am Kim Hyunsung. I am a prosecutor.\u201dIt was quite surprising to hear Hyunsung state his job so casually.Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan both took this as encouragement to introduce themselves right away.\u201cShield soldier, Park Deokgu.\u201d\u201cI am called Jung, Jung Hayan. My job is a wizard\u2026\u201dNaturally, Lee Sang-hee\u2019s gaze fell upon me.I wondered if it would be good to hide my job, but I decided that it was not necessary for the moment.Thinking that it would be better to join this rank of ransom raising, I nodded before speaking.\u201cLee Ki-young. I am an alchemist.\u201dUnlike the other three, I was already on my second job.While I thought this would prove to be satisfactory to hear, Lee Sang-hee\u2019s regretful expression seemed to tell me otherwise.\u2018Huh?\u2019Her expression was a dead giveaway. It disappeared as quickly as it had come, but thanks to my observing skills, it was impossible for me not to catch it.\u201cAh, that sounds sweet. You\u2019re already on your 2nd job change\u2026\u201d her tone of voice was different from the awe-inspiring one I was hoping for.Naturally, I looked towards Kim Hyunsung.\u2018You said being an alchemist would be good, you bad guy\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlaming Kim Hyunsung was the first thing that popped into my head.Although I was automatically suspicious by nature, I thought that Kim Hyunsung had no reason to deceive me.I knew there must be a reason for recommending the Alchemist job to me. Otherwise, there would be no merit for him in giving me a hero-grade item. It may have been a small investment for him, but Lee Sang-hee also only had two hero-grade items from what I saw.I don\u2019t know how many years she had been on this floor, but if you thought about her, who had already changed her job several times and has reached her growth limit, the hero-grade item was definitely\u2026\u2018It\u2019s worth it.\u2019Maybe Kim Hyunsung wanted his own personal potion-making factory? Considering his attitude, it didn\u2019t seem that way.\u2018You have to believe in him.\u2019It was probably a job that seemed to irk a lot of people.In the future, a time will come when an alchemist would become precious in some way. If not, it could be a job that would show efficiency later in terms of growth.Kim Hyunsung and I had gone through a lot together alongside Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu. I saw no reason for him to harm me.He wouldn\u2019t be an idiot with his line of thinking, so I knew there was definitely a reason why he chose this job for me.\u2018It\u2019s not just about me becoming a potion factory.\u2019Although, I knew that would be considered a bonus.While I was stuck in deep thought, our meals came, and the atmosphere once again shifted into something that felt more ambiguous.Although these people were clearly friendly, I knew they were all secretly looking for people with abilities that suited their interests.Park Deokgu, ever the carefree one, had already started digging into his meal with gusto. Kim Hyunsung and Lee Sang-hee, on the other hand, seemed to be in deep thoughts.Painfully oblivious to this, Park Deokgu began to talk in an attempt to maintain the cozy atmosphere.\u201cThis is delicious. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve eaten hot food.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d\u201cMy grandmother told me not to trust anyone who gives me free food\u2026 I guess the Korean affection is still alive! Isn\u2019t it, Hyung?\u201dI was sure my expression right now would resemble that of a recently stabbed person. My cheeks flushed in embarrassment.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dKim Hyunsung spoke up urgently in an attempt to save face.\u201cI think it is. This is exactly what Deokgu said. Thank you for your good treatment, but I wonder why you are being so good to us. Of course, I don\u2019t mean that in an offensive manner. It just\u2026 It just feels like overkill as an after-tutorial celebration. I apologize if I have offended anyone.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I am\u2026 Sorry. That\u2019s right. Everything will be confusing. It seems that I couldn\u2019t read your minds because you all were acting too calmly. When I think about what happened inside, it makes sense that I can\u2019t easily trust people. After all, I\u2019ve gone through the same thing, too. We are sorry for not being able to give you a more detailed explanation in advance.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I did not say this with that kind of intention.\u201d\u201cI think it would be better to explain the background of this place first.\u201d\u201cYes, please. Thank you.\u201d\u201cThis place is a little different from Earth, but it has a similar structure. There are three countries living in balance: The Kingdom Union, the Republic, and the Holy Empire to which we belong. Of course, there are free countries and other kingdoms that are not included here\u2026 It is the three countries I mentioned earlier that have the largest scale.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cObviously, it was not us who made this country. In addition to us, there are locals who have lived here. The relationship between us from Earth and the residents who lived here is entangled with complex interests.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cOur Blue Guild, technically speaking, belongs to and not from the Benigor Empire. We are free from their laws, but we live in their land and have their cooperation and support. It\u2019s not just Blue. All the groups established here are working through a contract with the Holy Empire of Benigor.\u201dThis roughly made sense to me.This was a situation that seemed fortunate to me in many aspects. Each group had some degree of autonomy beyond the influence of the empire. Of course, they had to exchange other stuff in return for their freedom.For example, they would be drafted in the event of a war\u2026 Or they would also have to deal with complicated stuff like taxes.If one were to look at the fact that the country had not been turned upside down at once, the three countries mentioned above might have something that did not let them feel threatened by the sudden appearance of the guilds.Guilds that exercise autonomy still need things like support or resources. They would still need to be bound to their respective countries in some way.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThe tutorial dungeon is held once every year. In the Holy Empire, we took over the management of the tutorial dungeon to our Gentiles.\u201d\u201cIs that the Blue Guild?\u201d\u201cNo. Management is based on a rotation system. Several large guilds and small and medium-sized guilds gather to decide whose turn it will be. That\u2019s what it means to be in charge of the dungeon this time. Our Blue Guild got the first right to bargain with you as well as the management of this round.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201dThat fairness would have only been made possible by the Holy Empire. For some reason, I couldn\u2019t imagine how the people of Earth could decide the order if the situation were reversed.Perhaps there were more complex interests beneath the surface, but for now, I found no reason to know them right away.\u201cSo what does this mean? Does this mean that we belong in your guild?\u201d\u201cNo. I have only mentioned the first right to bargain. It will be easier to understand if I say that we are a company, and you are the people who are waiting for the job and salary negotiations on this planet.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAs expected\u2026\u201cYou can think of this large room and food as our version of a bribe to you. Yes. That\u2019s what it is,\u201d Lee Sang-hee sported a bitter smile.All my guesses had been true thus far, but what I didn\u2019t expect was Lee Sang-hee\u2019s honest reaction.\u2018She\u2019s being too honest.\u2019Honestly\u2026In fact, if it were me who was in Lee Sang-hee\u2019s place, I would have lied about more than half of the story.The only truth I could have stated was that it only described the reality surrounding the continent rather than individual subjective opinions.This woman was too straight. Such honesty and uprightness must have been garnered through her personal experiences.Perhaps she was trying to make us feel that if we were to join the Blue Guild, we would enjoy a transparent community.\u2018This means that they are desperate.\u2019It was the only explanation I could think of. At this, I immediately opened my mouth.\u201cI have a question.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat is the Blue Guild\u2019s position in the Benignor Empire?\u201dLee Sang-hee hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she nodded and began to respond.\u201cThe Blue Guild was one of the guilds representing the Holy Empire. I couldn\u2019t say that our influence was big, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou mean, it was big in the past.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I have nothing to say except that there were unavoidable circumstances we couldn\u2019t get over. However, I would like you to think about the possibilities in the future. Not only does it have the same growth potential as other large guilds, but also the amount or conditions to be presented to you will not be pushed by other guilds.\u201dThis would be a risky decision. We did not know how much we had to give in order to gain something in return.If she paid a large sum of money to recruit us and we ended up not meeting their expected results, then I knew there would be hell to pay.Of course, they also had to consider the fact that we just passed the tutorial dungeon.Even though it wouldn\u2019t be bad to invest in us, given the various possibilities, such as the fact that four people made incredible results, they seemed to want to take the earliest opportunity to grab us before the other guilds could.\u2018They really are desperate.\u2019I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but it was clear that the current situation for the Blue Guild wasn\u2019t good at all.Otherwise, there would be no reason for them to gamble like this.\u201cI know the information I\u2019ve given you so far doesn\u2019t seem sufficient. However, you shouldn\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll tell you all the details soon enough.\u201d\u201cAh. Thank you.\u201dHyunsung Kim emitted a positive aura as he responded. Because of this, I felt that it was okay to listen to the story as well.It would be better to know my options more, seeing as I still did not have a plan as of yet.\u2018Am I still being considered as a candidate?\u2019A guild that was once at its peak, but was now declining, was a plausible prey.Anyway, as our side took a favorable position, Lee Sang-hee\u2019s face brightened.\u201cThen take a good rest today\u2026 And then tomorrow\u2026 Would you mind?\u201d\u201cYeah. We will,\u201d Kim Hyunsung nodded slightly.Lee Sang-hee smiled in response and began to guide us to their respective quarters.Unlike the sticky and unpleasant ground floor, seeing a room with a tempting-looking bed was like heaven.However, like Lee Sang-hee had admitted, this was just a bribe.The moment we agree to sign a contract with them would be the moment we would start to lead an uncertain life. However, if the merits looked this good\u2026\u201cIf you have any complaints, please do not hesitate to call me. I won\u2019t be far.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you for caring for us.\u201dAs she walked out, her gaze landed on me for a moment. I still did not know how I was faring in her internal evaluation of our worth.The main, delectable choice was Kim Hyunsung, but I opened my mouth anyway, pretending not to notice her. Instead, I zeroed in on Park Deokgu.\u201cIt\u2019s a little sudden, but\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine we\u2019re being treated like this. This kind of VIP treatment confuses me a little.\u201d\u201cI am too, Hyung. No\u2026 It\u2019s a world full of contracts, empires, and headaches. Did you understand a little?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Roughly\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can think of it simply. Mr. Deokgu, Mr. Kiyoung, we are in a position to be treated favorably now. In fact, I can dare to say that if it were another guild in charge of management right now, we would still be treated the same. After these first negotiations are over, there may be several proposals coming from elsewhere.\u201d\u201cAll of this hurts my head.\u201d\u201cPlease take your time. Think about where it\u2019s best to go. Rather, this might be better than a large guild. The conditions may be a bit bad, but it\u2019s a place that needs us right now, so our comfortable treatment will be guaranteed to some extent.\u201d\u201cAh. Do you mean we should go to a place where people find us of any use?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a simple feeling, but Lee Sang-hee\u2026 She doesn\u2019t look like a bad person. The same goes for the Blue Guild. I don\u2019t know for what reason it fell, but I don\u2019t think it will make me feel so sad as I care about rebuilding the guild.\u201dPark Deokgu simply nodded at Kim Hyunsung\u2019s words.However, it was apparent that Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan were not interested in what was happening, nor did they have an inkling of what the circumstances truly were.It seemed that Kim Hyunsung and I were the only ones who had an idea here.What was a little surprising to me was that Kim Hyunsung didn\u2019t seem to want to become independent. In fact, he seemed to have warmed up to the Blue Guild almost immediately.\u2018Lee Sang-hee?\u2019She seemed like a person who didn\u2019t have any big connections, but considering the possibility that Kim Hyunsung may have been active in this guild during his first time, it will not seem bad to be active here again.\u201cAre you going to stay with this guild?\u201d\u201cOppa?\u201d\u201cI need to think a little more about that. You\u2019ll know when tomorrow comes. I haven\u2019t decided what path I should take yet. It would be better to have a little spare time.\u201d\u201cYeah. You have to think about all the different possibilities. Yes. Indeed, there are many to choose from.\u201dThe atmosphere now was a mix of wariness and coziness.I couldn\u2019t figure out what Kim Hyunsung was thinking, but for now, I had no choice but to lie in bed.I stayed up all night last night, and now my drowsiness was slowly catching up to me.As I said before, the surrounding area was quite busy the next morning.I didn\u2019t know where Lee Ji-hye or the others who were in the shelter were, but they were probably rescued safely and stayed in a different place than us.I had to focus on what was important right now.\u2018Bargaining\u2026\u2019I would have to think about how much money and support should be given to recruiting all four of us.To the Blue Guild executives, I thought today could be seen as the most important day.After eating breakfast and washing up, I waited impatiently for something to happen. Finally, I saw some people calling out to us.I thought about whether we would negotiate as a group, but I knew it wasn\u2019t bound to happen.\u201cHyunsung.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe first choice would obviously be Kim Hyunsung.I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but after Kim Hyunsung entered, the sound of applause could be heard from a mile away.I knew Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu would garner the same attention as him.After all, they passed the initial screening of what I had begun to call the \u2018interview.\u2019\u2018I hate this atmosphere\u2026\u2019I felt like I was the only blight in this otherwise perfect team.I envied Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan. Both looked blissfully unaware of what exactly was happening. My stats compared to them were horrible beyond repair.If I let them know that I used magic, I would probably be considered a trap card.However, the ability to use magic was by no means bad stat. My growth was limited, but at this point, I was sure I could become a highly capable Alchemist.I had high intelligence and could craft a magical power that no one could compare to. As I began to indulge myself in a disillusioned situation where I could be considered of use, a voice rang out,\u201cMr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dThe door opened to reveal Lee Sang-hee, along with other people whose faces looked unfamiliar to me.One of them must be the guild\u2019s executive or personnel manager. One particular man, who wore glasses and looked a little old, opened his mouth\u2026\u201cAh\u2026 Mr. Kiyoung must have a job\u2026 Ah. You said you were an alchemist.\u201d\u201cYes. When the second class opened, I chose to follow the path of the alchemist,\u201d I felt a bit embarrassed by the atmosphere as if I was already doomed to fail.Lee Sang-hee could now properly keep her poker face in place, but the slight disapproval was evident on the other people\u2019s faces.Upon observing this, my hopes were shattered. I knew I would not be as welcomed here.Unlike Kim Hyunsung, Park Deokgu, and Jung Hayan, there was no room in this Guild for me.It felt like I had already lost the talent show before I could even showcase my talents.Lee Sang-hee looked towards me and smiled widely as if trying to lighten up the atmosphere.\u201cThe down payment is 1,500 gold. That is 150 million won in Korean currency. The contract period is 700 gold for 7 years. It is the same as how we charge other people\u2026 How is it? Of course, we will not only renegotiate the annual salary afterwards, but also provide maximum support for the items you\u2019ll need.\u201dThe old man next to her looked stubborn, so it was a miracle that Lee Sang-hee even bothered to assign me a contract as well.At this point, one could see what was going on.\u2018These beggars\u2026\u2019Did these guys really see me as an idiot?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis was, by no means, a bad story.In the end, I was offered a contract with a sum that totaled 150 million won.The currency here summed up to having 1,500 gold as down payment and an annual salary of 700 gold. The annual salary in itself was a whopping 70 million won in Hanwha. I still didn\u2019t know how much evaluation the newcomers to this place got, but I honestly felt like I got a significantly heftier sum than most of them did.However, even with this tempting bribe, I knew that they did not genuinely want to recruit me. There could have been many reasons, but the main thing I could think of was that my potential was way below average. Compared to my companions, I was seen as the weaker one that needed to be carried everywhere he went.My chosen job as an alchemist, along with my low magic, were surely the reasons why my evaluation had lowered considerably.I wanted to speak up but found myself frozen in place. My body suddenly felt like heavy lead, and I felt like puking the remnants of what I ate the day before.\u2018Right\u2026\u2019This situation made me wonder just how much they were willing to sacrifice to have the whole team recruited. They knew the others would not agree if I weren\u2019t a part of the recruitment.Lee Sang-hee once again opened her mouth. I knew she sensed my uneasiness and embarrassment.\u201cYou won\u2019t be getting just that. I can\u2019t explain everything right now, but there are also many welfare plans available. You can think of these as incentives, like on Earth. Typically, it is possible to use various basic insurance such as accident insurance and death insurance. You are also free to use the facilities in the guild. I will also assign you a personal coach. Ah! Even if you get married or have a child, you will be paid basic support. In fact, there are not so many people who are getting married these days\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. Is there any reason?\u201d\u201cPerhaps it is because being in a guild exposes you to unknown dangers. The situation now may be better than the tutorial dungeon itself, but one can never be too careful. The Blue Guild mainly maintains the guild through dungeon exploration or monster hunting. Of course, as much as we go hunting, we also operate a performance system. The by-products of monsters that appear after the hunt is over are divided between the guild and the hunting party at a rate of about 40% to 60%. The exact figure is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt makes sense that you are exposed to danger. Does the down payment and annual salary include the risk allowance?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s probably a bit larger than what you imagine,\u201d again, she answered honestly. On the other hand, I felt like quite the professional to ask questions like these.I don\u2019t know how long it had been since the Earth\u2019s people have been here, but I felt like it had been a very long time. How else would they think of such long-term backups such as insurance?\u2018You smart aleck.\u2019\u201cAs an alchemist, we will provide you with the catalysts you need as much as possible. Of course, it may be difficult to support expensive items, but\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Sang-hee\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is good to be honest.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is everything that Blue Guild can offer you.\u201dI liked how Lee Sang-hee had chosen to present herself to me. She showed me respect and gave me ample time to process everything.However, the elderly members sitting on either side of her were the problem. I could feel their disapproval from a mile away. These were undoubtedly the types who were openly judgmental. However, one problem still stood for them \u2013 they did not know just how emotionally attached I was to the other three.I thought that teaming up with these people would be a short-term plan, but it turns out that I was being carried more than I thought possible.\u2018Perhaps some parts of them could feel, after all.\u2019Did these people see too many scenarios with loss? Did they experience it themselves?I could say for sure that they also had colleagues in the past that they fought together with, and were now dead. That must have been traumatic.Even on Earth, seeing brothers, families, and undivided friends collapse because of their interests, the circumstances of such an adult will be the same here and there.\u2018However, even if they choose to set aside emotions, my friends will not.\u2019Absolutely not.There was no way Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan would agree to kick me out of the team. I could also say the same for Kim Hyunsung, who already chose to make me one of his investments.We were closer than these elders would like to think, and we all had our individualistic interests that they would never know.I found their open hostility ridiculous.It was commendable that they had chosen to include me and had gone so far as to present a heftier sum as a bribe, but the lingering stares of disapproval made me feel quite bad all the same.Not too bad, mind you.Rather, this kind of situation exuded more pleasure than embarrassment.\u2018You idiots.\u2019Soon enough, these elders will know to respect me and not look down on me.They would eventually know how advantageous it would be to be on my side.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it looks like a good deal all the same. I know you thought about this carefully.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d\u201cIs there a noncombatant army in the Blue Guild?\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201dA beat passed before one of the elders spoke to me.\u201cYes, Mr. Kiyoung. In fact, strictly speaking, alchemists are classified as noncombatants. And there will be no other guild offering such contract terms for an alchemist.\u201d\u201cAh. I see. That\u2019s kind of weird. I thought something like alchemy magic would exist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not very efficient, you see. Although it is said that this type of job uses a catalyst to activate magic\u2026 Well, monster by-products are expensive. Yeonseongjin, which is often used by alchemists, is not very efficient for us.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIf the alchemist himself has enough magic power, the story will be a little different\u2026 May I ask you how much magical stats you have?\u201d\u201cI have 8.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too high for a second job change. Maybe the growth of magical power was a little slow\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s rising fast compared to intellect, or when you compare it to fellow wizards.\u201d\u201cAlas\u2026 I see, okay, okay.\u201dI could see the look in his eyes and knew what it meant. My worth went down a little lower from our brief conversation.However, I knew he was willing to accept me because if he didn\u2019t, he would not get Kim Hyunsung or Jung Hayan onboard as well.\u201cSo, how is the contract turning out for you?\u201dNevertheless, he had to keep up with this infuriating fa\u00e7ade until all of our contracts were secured.Once I glanced at the contract, I began to speak slowly.\u201cI do not know. I think I need to think a little more.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. First of all, I would like to say that I find your offer very good, but I want you to give me some more time to think.\u201d\u201cAhhh. I would like you to give you an answer relatively quickly. We don\u2019t have time left either\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I will think about it as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cAnd I would like you to talk this over with your friends as well.\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dAt this, Lee Sang-hee began to speak once again. Her voice this time sounded urgent.\u201cAll of these are included in the catalog and contract of the Blue Guild. If you read it while you think\u2026 It will probably help.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you. I\u2019ll read it later.\u201dThe truth was, I knew it would not be worth reading.\u2018Everything will be reversed within a few days anyway.\u2019When I went outside, I saw Park Deokgu, Jung Hayan, and Kim Hyunsung waiting for me. The curious looks on their faces made me laugh.\u201cDid you not take any special exams?\u201d\u201cWhat? No!\u201d\u201cActually, the treatment looks pretty good.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, Kiyoung. Personally, I did a little bit of research, but it seems that other large guilds do not offer this level of condition. What they say is true. Even though our growth potential was not clearly seen, they were kind enough to offer us this much\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. They also seemed like good people, Oppa.\u201d\u201cPerhaps they are gamblers in their own way. There will be pressure to successfully complete this recruitment. They are the types who think that people are precious resources.\u201dTo be honest, didn\u2019t look like the guys were thinking that way.\u201cIt may be an early judgment, but what about it? It would be a little better to get solid support here than to be in a large guild.\u201d\u201cIf you like it, then I\u2019m joining.\u201d\u201cMe, too\u2026\u201dAfter all, our loyal Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan would never betray me. However, it seemed to me that Kim Hyunsung already had his mind set on joining the Blue Guild.It even felt like he was being urgent about it.I knew he was thinking that it would be safer to have a backup than forming a personal force.Like him, I would have made the same choice.There were certainly advantages to forming a force personally. Not only would it move according to our will, but there were also a lot more options to choose from.However, entering the Blue Guild also had its own set of advantages.One could enjoy the establishments and facilities already put up by the guild. If it was Kim Hyunsung and Jung Hayan, it wouldn\u2019t be a job for them to become the guild\u2019s main force.His choice was, all in all, certainly reasonable.\u201cOf course, there is no reason to be in a hurry. I think it would be better to talk a little more and think about it\u2026 I like this guild a little.\u201dKim Hyunsung opened his mouth, careful not to show that he was feeling nervous, \u201cI think it would be better to think about it a little more.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d\u201cNo. I mean yes I do, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cThey could have offered us a little more money.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cPerhaps there is a way to raise the payment some more.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIf Kim Hyunsung truly valued the Blue Guild, he would have accepted the offer as fast as possible. However, it seemed like this wasn\u2019t the case at all.Like me, he was looking for a way to garner more power.Kim Hyunsung blinked. He seemed to realize just how much he had exposed himself. Honestly speaking, I didn\u2019t know what his plan was, but what he said was sound. Our party had more time to think about it.As soon as we came out of the tutorial dungeon, there would be no setbacks in the scenarios in his head.\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026 Oh, I think I know.\u201d\u201cYeah. There is no need to rush the contract, Mr. Hyunsung. The more you drag on, the more anxious they will be about us.\u201dKim Hyunsung clearly understood what I was talking about.\u201cThen\u2026 You mean you can get more for us there? Actually, money doesn\u2019t really matter that much\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, right.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026 Are you thinking about going somewhere else?\u201d\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be, Oppa!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I want to be with all of you too. Of course, I want to be with Hyunsung as well. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYes. Even though this strange place has a bond\u2026 I want to go with Kiyoung, Deokgu, and Hayan.\u201dThe atmosphere once again shifted into a cozy one.When I looked at Kim Hyunsung again, an involuntary laugh came out of me.\u2018I\u2019ll make you make a lot of money, Hyunsung.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was like winning a scratch card lottery, minus the scratching.I had to hand it to them. They made sure to give us an offer that would feel like a major loss if we were to refuse it.Yes, it was surprising for them to find out that the group who would finish the tutorial dungeon in the shortest time would only consist of four people, but they were also smart enough to act on this surprising fact as fast as possible.\u2018I\u2019m not stupid.\u2019Rather, it could be said that they were really the competitive types.Returning back to reality, I caught sight of Park Deokgu reading something. Tilting my head, I asked him, \u201cAre you reading the catalog?\u201d\u201cWell, yes. We might end up staying here one way or another, so I figured finding out more about them wouldn\u2019t hurt. Their guild restaurant sounds so nice!\u201d\u201cWell?\u201d\u201cWell, when I was on Earth, the star chef Rayman Park, my grandfather, had been in charge of our restaurant\u2026 Just looking at his food would make me drool\u2026\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why the guild\u2019s accommodations seem awesome to me. Maybe I could be just as much of a successful chef as my family members. My grandfather would be proud\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t know if this was an appropriate thought, but I almost felt sure that Park Deokgu\u2019s grandfather wouldn\u2019t want him to be living in a world like this.\u201cI think the guild is very intriguing\u2026 How big are the other guilds?\u201d\u201cIt probably won\u2019t make much of a difference if we compare Blue Guild to the others. They said it wasn\u2019t the same as before, but even if a rich man lost his business, he can still last three years. If one was able to accumulate so much over the span of many years, then they must also know how to survive. I\u2019m not sure if they want to recruit us because they want to regain their former glory\u2026\u201d\u201cSame here. I feel like I\u2019ve become a special person because of the way I\u2019m being treated, and I don\u2019t think I feel bad about it, Hyung.\u201d\u201cIn the future, you will be treated with more respect.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cSure, you will.\u201dHe was right about that part. It definitely wouldn\u2019t take long.After all, we were lottery tickets whose potentials have not yet been scratched. Anyone here with any sense would know that there was a high probability of winning if they recruited us. That was the whole reason why they were willing to give us more compensation than what was necessary, after all.\u201cI didn\u2019t think Hayan would be so treasured here as well. I also didn\u2019t think she would be so attached to you. I suppose wherever you choose to go, she will follow.\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t say that, you yourself are doing well enough. I am only following these guild procedures because they\u2019re necessary.\u201d\u201cStill.\u201d\u2018You don\u2019t have to say it like that\u2026\u2019Even if Park Deokgu didn\u2019t say it, I already knew how important Jung Hayan was. She was one of the biggest reasons why we were such a desirable team to have.In the future, once they achieved legendary magical stats talent, Jung Hayan would be an Archmage, and Kim Hyunsung would be, for lack of a better term, a regret-free returner.Potential ability was not simply the limit of ability. It was not a fixed measurement of how much one could grow, too. Players with enough determination could surpass their own set limits depending on how far they were willing to go.This was where intelligence and luck came in.In the case of Jung Hayan, she would have already completed her second job soon; what with her scary capacity for magic power, it was expected.\u2018The Elemental Wizard.\u2019That would be the second job I would recommend for her. I knew Kim Hyunsung would agree with me.Unlike me, Jung Hayan seemed to have an affinity for all elements. Even the alchemist job could not be found on her former job list.In the first place, she had no reason to choose such a job. Right from the start, Jung Hayan\u2019s stats were already pretty obvious. She was a wizard through and through.Considering how much we had gone through, and how easily she had supported us throughout the entire tutorial dungeon, she was already growing at a very fast pace.What she needed was the slightest opportunity, and her stats would skyrocket.I don\u2019t know if what happened in the dungeon became traumatic for her, but I had to make sure I took advantage of this and have her attached to me.Because of this, I had created an unspoken rule that could be placed between Jung Hayan and me. This, in itself, made sure that I would be able to reap the rewards alongside her.\u2018\u2026\u2019Of course, the effect was more than I imagined.I had only started off with simple praises, gradually increasing my attempts to deepen our relationship.At first, all I had to do was stroke her head and hold her hand, but as I raised the level little by little, I started to obsess even over her performance.Over time, she had proven that her real goal was not to achieve pure strength or fame but to continually receive praise from me. The fact that I showed no approval whatsoever when Jung Hayan did nothing also made her quite desperate and determined.Perhaps the reason Park Deokgu said that was because of our current situation. He hardly saw me during the demonstration and had correctly guessed that something was off.Among us, it was not Park Deokgu, Kim Hyunsung, nor I, but Jung Hayan, who spent the most time on personal training.\u201cI\u2019m probably the one in the team who always causes blunders and gives everyone a hard time.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true\u2026\u201d\u201cThis demonstration where our statuses determine how the Blue Guild or other guilds perceive us is very important. If I mess things up for everyone\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019m glad they decided to accept us as a team.\u201d\u201cOh, please. You are doing great yourself.\u201d\u201cOne has to learn how to set themselves apart in this kind of thing. I can\u2019t be stuck forever. This is a good moment to talk about this.\u201d\u201cThen why are you doing this demonstration in the first place?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost a routine for athletes. They need to know how much we\u2019re worth so they can set the correct price. It\u2019s a little bad, but\u2026 It would be worse if I mess things up for everyone.\u201d\u201cOh, the more I think about it, the more I think I know why Hayan really likes you.\u201dI held the urge to laugh. Park Deokgu was so innocent that it was actually kind of endearing. Little did he know that Jung Hayan\u2019s feelings had already gone past just liking. Most of that was thanks to Park Deokgu\u2019s active intervention.At this point, I started wondering if Park Deokgu really was as clueless as he seemed, or if he was just trying to hide how much he really knew.I shook my head and responded,\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOkay, Hyung.\u201d\u201cWalk faster.\u201d\u201cWhat? No\u2026.\u201dWe took note of our surroundings as we started to move. The lush scenery was such a stark contrast to the drab tutorial dungeon.This felt luxurious, safe, and treated.Looking out the window, I could see that the people rescued from the shelter were gathering and doing something. Perhaps they were receiving mandatory education that was required by this new world.Lee Jihye saw us for a moment, but she quickly focused on something else. Following her gaze, I saw what caught her eye. It was an internal smokehouse.There were quite a few people already gathered around.The clothes worn by these people looked quite luxurious, regardless of their rank or status. Apparently, it was not just the Blue Guild executives who dressed this way.Those with different flags, looking somewhere around the training hall like a director of a large company, certainly looked like people from other guilds.\u2018Scouter?\u2019Yes, these people were probably looking for talents.Peering closely at their faces told me what I already knew. These people were anxious to find someone worthy of bringing back to their guilds.It was already a week ago that the demonstration had been done, with the Blue Guild having first dibs on whoever they deemed fit to recruit for themselves.Except for when I checked how she was faring, I hadn\u2019t seen Jung Hayan in three days.I felt particularly fine as I had other things to think about for these past days, but it seemed that it had been excruciating for Jung Hayan.\u201cDoesn\u2019t she seem a little\u2026 sad?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201dActually, I looked like she was more tired than sad.She said he would come to see the day of my demonstration, but it seemed like she herself wasn\u2019t doing too well.Seeing as she kept looking around, I guessed that she had been looking for me. Someone then approached her and spoke in a lower voice. Startled, Jung Hayan turned to the person and immediately reddened.\u201cOppa! Oh\u2026 Oh, s-sorry! I was hoping\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you look a little weird right now?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s because I\u2019m feeling nervous. And\u2026 It hasn\u2019t been long since I left the dungeon. I don\u2019t know what to expect yet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. I\u2019m sure everyone here knows how traumatic the experience has been, so they won\u2019t be too hard on us.\u201dI didn\u2019t know who spoke in response to Hayan\u2019s words, but I was glad that someone else could understand the situation correctly.\u2018However, the rest of these people\u2026\u2019All I could see were people shifting restlessly wherever I looked.I wondered if anyone here felt confident at all, but I was pretty sure I would find no one like that here. Shrugging, I raised my hand high in the air. Jung Hayan spotted me in an instant.\u2018You can\u2019t ruin it,\u2019 this was an important event.-Alas. If you are ready, Jung Hayan, give a signal.At this, Jung Hayan nodded.If anyone here were to appear as if they were preparing in advance by memorizing spells, they could potentially be deemed unsafe.Seeing those who, in turn, saw me, clicked their tongues, I thought maybe my deemed plan would fail.\u2018Is it too hard\u2026? The moment I experienced regret, I felt the flow of magical power that I could not even imagine.\u2019\u201cHuh?\u201dIt looked ridiculous, but you can see the dust scattering around Jung Hayan. It was surprising to see that a simple action such as moving one\u2019s magic power within the body could give such an effect.As I stood there, speechless, Jung Hayan continued her incredibly long chant. All the executives of the large guilds began looking at her with dumbstruck expressions.Amidst the crowd, I could hear a flurry of sheepish voices.\u201cReport this now! Quickly!\u201d\u201cHey! Get her profile here as fast as possible!\u201dEverything was going according to plan.Actually, everything was going better than I had originally expected. Indeed, I expected some achievement, but I couldn\u2019t imagine it would reach this extent.The longer the spell got, the louder the humming became.From where they were situated, Lee Sang-hee and the other members of the Blue Guild looked dumbstruck. I found out what they were thinking. Jung Hayan had not displayed this type of power to them.It wasn\u2019t this much a week ago.\u2018What, really\u2026?\u2019It was during this time that Jung Hayan finally finished chanting,\u201cMaterialize, elemental bomb!\u201dQaw ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!The reverberation emanated from Jung Hayan\u2019s hand with a tremendous sound. Even I had to cover my ears. Due to the intense vibrations, I made sure to coat an extra layer of magical protection so as to not damage my eardrums.The mysterious magic Jung Hayan created immediately flew to her desired target \u2013 one of the objects found in the middle of the martial arts sector.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201dQaw ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!Upon reaching it, the target disappeared without a trace in an instant after the second explosion.There was no cheering, only silence.However\u2026For some reason, the silence had become a louder sound than if the people around us had cheered.\u201cShe\u2026 What\u2026\u201dPark Deokgu turned to me, \u201cHyung.\u201dI did not deem to respond.\u201cAre you seeing the same thing as I am?\u201dAgain, I did not respond. However, a smile had begun to spread on my face.I didn\u2019t know just how lucky I was to get hold of such a prize.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed that I was not dreaming after all. Jung Hayan\u2019s performance really guaranteed a better outcome than what I expected.It was natural that a general buzz of noisiness descended upon the crowd after the initial pause of silence.\u201cDid you bring her profile?!\u201d\u201cHow did you say the negotiations with the Blue Guild were going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an unconditional recruitment. Who is the guild master?\u201d\u201cYou said that the down payment doesn\u2019t matter. It has already been granted.\u201d\u201cWhat were the personnel in charge of the guild doing? No more detailed data? Didn\u2019t you get anything from the Blue Guild?\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cFuck. Will this problem end with a simple sorry? Son of a bitch \u2026 Useless babies\u2026\u201dIt seemed that there was also a system that allowed one to communicate with a distant partner.This is exactly what I expected. No, this was more than that.You could see the guild executives gathering around, excitement showing on their faces as they hustled and jostled in an attempt to find out more about Jung Hayan.Looking at Jung Hayan\u2019s profile was only the first step. I could already see these executives trying to work out just where she would be and how much she could achieve if she were to join their respective guilds.The other guilds were also approaching the Blue Guild at this point. As they had the primary bargaining power, some of the others were thinking about bargaining with them.Of course, Lee Sang-hee and the executives of the Blue Guild would be agitated.I knew our team quite the catch, but I did not expect to receive this much desire.I caught a glimpse of Jung Hayan\u2019s expression and could see that she was indeed feeling happy. She knew she had succeeded. She looked a little cute, staring at me like that with her hands clasped together.I was curious as to what extent she had grown, and when I looked into her status window with my ability, her stats revealed themselves to me.[Check player Jung Hayan\u2019s status window and potential.][Name-Jung Hayan][Title-None. You should try a little more.][Age-21][Propensity-Pure Advocate][Profession-Elemental Wizard-Rare Grade][Job Effect-Acquisition of Basic Magic Knowledge][Job Effect-Intermediate Magic Knowledge Acquisition][Capacity][Strength-11/Growth Limit: Rare or less][Agility-11/Growth Limit: Rare or less][Health-16/Growth Limit: Hero or less][Intellect-29/Growth Limit: Hero or higher][Endurance-14/Growth Limit: Rare or less][Luck-25/Growth Limit: Hero or higher][Magic Power -31/Growth Limit: Legend or higher][Equipment-Divine Healing-Rare Grade][Talent-How to Become a Wizard-Hero Grade][General comment- Very good. The growth of the magic power point is most noticeable. It is showing an incomprehensible rate of growth, but there is a drawback, although not a big one, that the stats have not grown evenly. Player Lee Kiyoung is lucky. Make sure you don\u2019t lose her. That\u2019s the right way to survive. You just need to be careful riding on a good boat.]\u201931 magic power?\u2019That was a ridiculous number.In fact, you could not accurately determine whether it was high or not. Those who appeared to be Wizards have quite a variety of magical powers. They ranged from as low as 60 to as high as 80.I didn\u2019t know how much she practiced, but one thing was for sure \u2013 Jung Hayan\u2019s growth was immense.\u2018Is it possible to produce that level of power in such a short time?\u2019Taking this into consideration, it was highly possible that Jung Hayan had decided to be flexible with her abilities. She looked a little tired now, so that little spectacle must have cost a lot of magic. Nevertheless, if you looked at the noisy surrounding atmosphere, what Jung Hayan was showing now was a story that was difficult to explain in common sense.-That\u2026 The demonstration is over\u2026Even before the moderator had finished talking, Jung Hayan had already started running in our direction. Although the crowds flocked to her, she seemed to have ignored them all.\u2018I will accept business cards\u2026\u2019\u201cOppa!\u201d Jung Hayan\u2019s face glowed. She was obviously expecting praise from me.Since I didn\u2019t see her properly this entire week, it was not unreasonable for me to show her a little approval.\u201cYou did a good job, Hayan.\u201d\u201cThank you, Oppa\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you have a hard time?\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t!\u201d there were tears in her eyes.I was a little worried about whether it was okay to show such affection in such a crowded place, but both the Blue Guild\u2019s head and the large guilds\u2019 executives were looking at us.\u2018This isn\u2019t so bad. Rather, it\u2019s actually good.\u2019It was not bad to show off that you had close friends. I opened my arms a little and hugged her tightly. Jung Hayan positively glowed.As time passed, the heavy gazes in our direction started to become burdensome to the point where I started feeling embarrassed.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Of course, I was not that cunning as to show public affection in such a place.\u201cOh, Oppa! Give me a hot kiss!\u201d It was Park Deokgu who had jokingly spoken.\u2018Stop it, you pig!\u201d\u201cOppa! Oppa! Oppa! You\u2019re so hot as a man!\u201dAs Park Deokgu continued to joke around, Jung Hayan\u2019s expression eventually shifted. It was obvious that she was expecting more.\u2018Jung Hayan\u2026\u2019I always say, \u2018Jung Hayan can\u2019t be this stupid\u2019. I didn\u2019t talk out loud, but I was sure\u2026\u2018I\u2019ve done this much, so I have to get a decent reward. I\u2019ve been patient for a week.\u2019 I felt like that was what she was saying.It didn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea. I wanted to announce, \u2018She\u2019s mine.\u2019 in front of everyone.I had to be careful, but I also had to do something.After thinking about it, I gently grabbed her face with both hands and puckered my lips. I thought that a slow move would be the best way.When I kissed her lightly on her forehead, I could feel Jung Hayan trembling.It was only my lips touching her forehead, but the effect was more than I had imagined.\u2018What\u2026\u2019Not only was she hugging me tight enough to hurt my back, but her legs also started trembling. I glanced down at her and saw a face, reddened beyond imagination.The appearance of her parted lips looked dangerous, but I thought that it didn\u2019t matter. The entire time, I could feel the heavy gazes coming from the executives.It didn\u2019t matter who saw us; we gave off the perfect scenario as lovers.At this point, the moderator seemed to be confused. The Blue Guild\u2019s head had also noticed that something was wrong.-That\u2026 Jung Hayan\u2019s demonstration is over. VIPs, please do not leave your seats and act according to the procedure after all the schedules are finished. Likewise, there will be a demonstration of Kim Hyunsung, who participated in the first tutorial dungeon as a strategy team. The content of the demonstration is a duel\u2026\u201cHayan, I\u2019m going to see Mr. Hyunsung now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes, yes of course, Oppa.\u201d Jung Hayan looked up at me and smiled. Although I felt uncomfortable, it was not unbearable. Rather, this would be appropriate as a reward in return for Jung Hayan\u2019s performance.Sure, it was burdensome as she was constantly trying to bury her face into my chest, but when Kim Hyunsung came out with a sword in the center of the training center, attention began to shift from us to him.\u201cWell, I feel alienated for no reason\u2026 Should I also get a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cConcentrate on the duel, Deokgu. It\u2019s probably quite worth seeing.\u201d\u201cEven if my Hyung doesn\u2019t say that, I\u2019m not taking my eyes off it. I want to watch Kim Hyunsung too.\u201d-If you are ready, I would like you to send a signal.Slowly, Kim Hyunsung raised his hand.-Then, let\u2019s get started.I knew that the warrior series were going to demonstrate through sparring, while the wizard series would demonstrate magic, but the opponent did not look easy at all.First, the stats themselves are higher than Kim Hyunsung\u2019s own stats.Of course, Kim Hyunsung would think otherwise.The opponent\u2019s expression slowly hardened upon looking at Kim Hyunsung, confidently holding his sword.Jung Hayan was already a big hint that our party was not normal, but Kim Hyunsung? He was definitely taking us to another level altogether.In an instant, he and his opponent disappeared from sight.A battle unfolded that couldn\u2019t even be caught up with normal eyes.This was yet another spectacle, second only to Jung Hayan\u2019s performance.It seems that the distinguished guests who came to watch would be more than pleasantly surprised.As the duel continued, I could see the audience\u2019s eyes slowly widening.\u2018Is it because you thought the only talented one was Jung Hayan?\u2019Well, they were obviously wrong.\u2018Puh!\u2019When I saw the VIPs with their mouths hanging open, I could not resist smiling. However, I could only hear the sound of swords clashing.\u2018Well done!\u2019We already knew that our lovely regressors would be strong, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen them fight properly.The difference in stats was easily distinguishable.However, if you looked at the face of his opponent, the answer would come out.He now felt nervous. Kim Hyunsung had proven himself to be a formidable enemy.\u2018He\u2019s strong.\u2019Soon after, the opponent\u2019s sword flew into the air. Kim Hyunsung did not bother retrieving his sword. He knew that he had already shown his worth.The opponent, however, didn\u2019t give up and swung his fist, but the moment the opponent pushed Kim Hyunsung with the same arm that dropped the sword, a roar resonated.Kim Hyunsung bounced off to the other side.\u201cAh!\u201dQuaang! It was safe to say that he could have broken a lot of bones after landing against the wall in such a rough manner, but when Kim Hyunsung simply got up and brushed the dust off his sleeves, it seemed that he wanted to show that his durability ability wasn\u2019t bad either.\u201cI lost.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s neat. This foxy guy is so strong!\u2019It did not matter. They had managed to show off all their strengths.If the guy who just came in had overcome the veteran casually, the distinguished guests here would have thought it was strange.Showing his skill through the duel had been a smart move for Kim Hyunsung.Slowly, the applause started to fill in from the crowds. I could see the executives from the other guilds looking positively hungry.In terms of impact, I would like to say that Jung Hayan would be one of the top rankers, but the demonstration that Kim Hyunsung showed definitely stood out.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cGenius\u2026\u201d-That\u2026 Kim Hyunsung\u2019s demonstration is over\u2026 Please, distinguished guests, follow the procedure\u2026The voice of the moderator did not seem to reach our distinguished guests.As soon as Kim Hyunsung\u2019s battle was over, a lot of people jumped from their seats to approach Kim Hyunsung.Nice try.It wasn\u2019t just Kim Hyunsung who became a star at this point.\u201cWould you mind talking for a minute?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Kiyoung, was it? And Jung Hayan. If it doesn\u2019t bother you, can we take some of your time? This is Cha Hee-ra of the Red Mercenary Guild.\u201dI had also become quite the star as the pillar of a talented genius wizard.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019This was a situation where you couldn\u2019t hide your humble smile.The one who approached me was an unusually red-haired woman, offering out her hand for a handshake.I didn\u2019t know if I was just caught off guard, or if it was because I was, after all, a man, but my eyes were automatically drawn to her bold outfit.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Be careful, or she might end up biting your head off.]Her job was a hero-level mercenary queen, with her title being a \u2018Blood Mad Madame\u2019.Of course, it didn\u2019t feel like she was up to anything good, given how she approached us. The fact that she was also an unpredictable innovator added to my unease.\u2018But these stats\u2026\u2019Her strength at 90 and her endurance at 97 were highly impressive. She was even stronger than Lee Sang-hee!However, if I were to compare her to the other female executives present, I could safely say that having such high stats and hero-graded jobs were the norm. I shouldn\u2019t have to be so inclined towards her.Honestly speaking, it was the attractive smile and the confident outstretched hand that drew me to her.However, I knew that this simple scenario could undermine me.Shifting slightly beside me, I could feel Jung Hayan\u2019s discomfort. Of course, knowing her, she was trying her best not to show it.She must be aware that not shaking her hand would be an outright disrespect for such a powerful person.I thought Jung Hayan could find it in her to be a little more mature, but the way her hand had tightened around my arm meant she childishly did not want me to take the handshake.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019Cha Hee-ra was a VIP of another guild. I had to remember that fact.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Jung Hayan\u2026\u2019It was a little difficult to move my arm into position because of Jung Hayan trying her best to stop me from doing so, but after silently asking for understanding this once, I held Cha Hee-ra\u2019s hand tightly.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Lee Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really an honor to get to talk to the stars of this demonstration.\u201d\u201cAh, all the credit goes to Jung Hayan here\u2026\u201d\u201cJung Hayan, that demo was really impressive.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d Jung Hayan\u2019s voice had become dangerously low.Once I dropped Cha Hee-ra\u2019s hand, Jung Hayan\u2019s grip thankfully loosened.\u201cThe two of you are really close. Is there any chance that you\u2019ve developed your relationship outside?\u201d\u201cAh. Not like that. The first time I met her was in the tutorial dungeon, and after that, we got closer to each other and made a good relationship.\u201d\u201cI really envy you.\u201dIt was really hard trying to read this woman\u2019s gaze.\u2018Aren\u2019t you embarrassed?\u2019Of course, it seemed that the source of her self-confidence was not her appearance.It might be her taste to go around with more than half of her breasts exposed, but the real reason behind her confidence was because she was called the Mercenary Queen Cha Hee-ra.She was simply that strong\u2014the strongest out of everyone I had seen so far, even. And I wasn\u2019t just basing this off her stats.I\u2019ve also based this off of the fact that no one else dared to approach us in her presence.\u201cAh\u2026 I think I should introduce myself one more time. I am the leader of the Red Mercenary Guild. My job is called Mercenary Queen Cha Hee-ra.\u201d\u2018Also\u2026\u2019\u201cYou came in person.\u201d\u201cYeah. I am a little interested in talent. Especially this time, I heard a lot of talented people coming in, so I just had to see for myself.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Thank you so much for giving us such importance.\u201d\u201cNo. It is natural.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay to talk. As far as I hear, the Blue Guild has the right to bargain. .\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Negotiation. I\u2019m just talking about it. Of course, we have to tell you about the recruitment, but our Red Mercenary Guild respects the bargaining rights of the Blue Guild. It would be right to think of it as an advisor to help you make reasonable choices.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIn other words, it meant that I wasn\u2019t part of their choices yet. I was not on their table for now.They were still trying to see how important I was and how I was going to fit in.It wasn\u2019t just us. Park Deokgu was also talking to a man who suddenly approached him, and Kim Hyunsung was openly surrounded by people.I knew the Blue Guild could feel their potential loss if they let us get taken away. This was exactly how they knew they were a guild without power.If they had the power to control the VIPs, this would not have happened in the first place.Of course, I was not sympathetic.It was a story that had nothing to do with me as an independent person, and making strings here was a more reasonable \u2013 and safer \u2013 option.\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know a lot about this kind of thing. Guilds that usually have primary bargaining rights have a strong tendency to control information regarding the other guilds\u2026 About the red mercenaries I run\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u201cOh, then I guess I have to explain a little bit. Our Red Mercenary is a guild made by melee workers. As the name suggests, it is easy to understand that it is a guild that moves through various quests, as well as dungeons, monster hunting, and even small battles or war quests.\u201d\u201cAh, melee\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. To be precise, it was a mercenary guild made up of melee soldiers.\u201d\u201cYou mean you are pursuing change.\u201d\u201cYeah. It is difficult to tell in detail, but there is a movement within the guild to train wizards and priests and invest in auxiliary occupations. It\u2019s a bit different, but it\u2019s a situation where a lot of the budget is being spent. It\u2019s a bit late compared to other guilds, so why are the executives urging you to invest more? Actually, the reason why I\u2019ve come this far is because of our investors\u2026\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dI think I know what she was talking about.\u201cI\u2019m curious as to how much you plan to invest.\u201d\u201cWould you be comfortable speaking in Hanwha?\u201d\u201cYeah. Still on the side\u2026\u201dCha Hee-ra laughed and spoke again.\u201c2 billion.\u201d\u2018What\u2026\u2019\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201c2 billion per person. We are also preparing an additional budget in case you don\u2019t know. Of course, we will continue to invest in the future. At least 500 million won a year, even. Does that sound fine?\u201dRoughly interpreted, it was a down payment of more than 2 billion and an annual salary of 500 million.Based on this, the down payment would be 20,000 gold and an annual salary of 5,000 gold.I felt so embarrassed, I couldn\u2019t even speak.\u20182 billion?\u2019Compared to the amount presented by the Blue Guild at first, the gap was too large to even be considered.I expected the price to jump by a bit, not by twenty more times! In the case of annual salary, I\u2019d say it jumped by 5 times.At this point, I began to wonder just how the Blue Guild saw us and began to understand why so many of the other guilds wanted to get us.If the amount is this much, it was unreasonable to refuse them outright.It was a whopping 2 billion!An amount that the average person cannot collect even after working a lifetime.Even at this point, I was already calculating which one would be the better option to take!\u201cBut\u2026 It may be a little difficult to invest in close-knit workers. We are new to this sort of thing, after all.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cThere are really many talented people in our guild. Of course, it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t considered Kim Hyunsung or the others\u2026 it\u2019s just that we want to focus on only one place.\u201dThis did not sound good.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cBoth Mr. Kiyoung and Ms. Hayan seems to be interested in this project of our guild\u2026 I want to ask what you think.\u201dThis was basically a question of whether or not we were willing to abandon Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung.Probably, as it was a guild that had already been strengthened as a melee force, the prosecutors and tankers were already seasoned members.Therefore, I could understand why they did not choose to invest in Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung. They already had people in place that could act as the perfect shield and sword.Even if I was in her position, my focus would literally just stay on the magical side.\u201cThe project itself is really interesting, but I\u2019m a little worried if we can help. I was intimate with my friends whom I attacked the tutorial dungeon together with. To focus on one place is\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s surprising.\u201dShe looked even more intrigued at this point. It almost felt like a game of cat and mouse to me.\u201cIt would have been really nice if I had the opportunity to invest in only the two of you\u2026 Our guild is also difficult to handle these days. We want to make this guild a better place, see, and to compensate for our past losses. It\u2019ll be such a shame not to get you or Jung Hayan.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a gift.\u201dI could feel Cha Hee-ra pulling an item out, and I immediately stiffened.\u2018Was this a bribe?\u2019Probably not. It actually felt like a gift.However, my unease did not go away entirely.On the other hand, since this was a gift from a leader of such a large guild, I knew it was a valuable item.\u201cIf you change your mind, you can talk to me anytime. If not, I still want to keep in touch. Since you belong to the same empire as us, wouldn\u2019t there be a lot of time to go into dungeons or stand on the front line together? And\u2026 Well\u2026 Jung Hayan?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe young miss must also learn how to kill a little bit of life.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dCha Hee-ra suddenly came to this direction in an instant. I could feel the moisture on my lips from when she had kissed me without warning.\u2018This crazy\u2026\u2019I couldn\u2019t get my mind to react fast enough to the sudden action.I tried pushing Cha Hee-ra away, but there was no way I could rival her strength stats with my own weak body. I could hardly even make a single noise.I struggled to look at Jung Hayan, but could no longer feel any trace of her magic or presence beside me.\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019I was not expecting this at all!\u201cThis is also a gift. Then see you next time.\u201d\u2018Shit!\u2019I noticed everyone had begun to look this way with stunned faces. Even Park Deokgu had a startled expression.No one had to tell me what just happened. The only thing I was worried about was losing Jung Hayan.\u2018Fuck, I\u2019m screwed.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay-Kiyoung Lee, please send a signal when you are ready.As I raised my hand slightly, I immediately felt the eyes looking at me. On the second floor, Kim Hyun-sung, Park Deokgu, and Jung Hayan were also intently looking at me.I was a little nervous as everyone here was so focused on what I could do, but honestly, I didn\u2019t feel the burden of having to prove myself.In the first place, I knew that the guild executives weren\u2019t expecting me to do something worth their time.\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201dRather, it was Jung Hayan who had me feeling unsettled. Ever since that incident with Cha Hee-ra, she hadn\u2019t been herself.That strangely quiet appearance had me sweating.Next to her, Park Deokgu was sporting a displeased expression as well. Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expression was generally unreadable.\u2018I\u2019m anxious\u2026\u2019I had an inkling that I knew the reason why the madwoman had done that to me, and I didn\u2019t like the reason at all. She probably did it to spite Jung Hayan.Of course, it could also be a warning, but I hardly felt like this was the case.I think I was even expected to thank her, all for not pulling the sword and beheading me for not accepting her offer right away.I shook my head and began to focus on my magic, which was getting a little more complicated, and slowly began to draw a circle on the floor.It was a rather complicated process, but the magic circle itself was ready.\u2018It\u2019s at least efficient.\u2019It not only costs less magic power, but it would definitely do the trick.In an instant, the magic circle was completed.From the nods I saw in the crowd, I knew they found this type of magic familiar.\u201cLord, I hope you answer my voice.\u201dThe magic circle was the one responsible for building the tower of magic. Even memorizing the chant would drain you of your magic power.\u201cFire pillar.\u201dAt my words, a pillar of fire rose up from the magical circle that I made.This was not possible to do with my meager amount of magic power. However, with the help of a little extra effect and the magic circle, the outcome of my magic had become something more impressive than what it should have been.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t hear the cheers of Park Deokgu, Kim Hyunusng, or Jung Hayan as I would have heard them in the past.However\u2026Clap, clap, clap.I started to hear the sound of applause spreading throughout the venue.It was not a bad demonstration, but of course, it was not bad enough to not be applauded for.They\u2019ve probably figured out by now that I was the weakest out of my entire party, but I knew for a fact that I was not automatically useless.\u201cThank you.\u201d-Lee Ki-young\u2019s demonstration is finished. All the VIPs, please move according to the procedure.However, just like yesterday, these people refused to follow.You could see distinguished guests and scouts flocking here, much like dogs answering to their master.\u201cI am Lee Yeon-hee, who runs the Saseong Guild. Let\u2019s talk for a second\u2026 No, I\u2019ll give you a business card first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Clan Master Jeong Jong-cheol. If you can\u2019t excuse me\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is Youngsoo Ko. Our clan is a new clan created during this time, and the conditions are somewhat insufficient, but the growth potential is better than any other clan or guild\u2026\u201d\u201cI am Park Hye-soo, the representative of the Magical Guild. I want to talk a little bit\u2026\u201dIt felt tiring just to respond to every single person. Each and every one of them was, after all, a valuable prospect. Whether it\u2019s a newly created clan or a fallen guild, everyone mattered. Therefore, willingly receiving business cards and holding formal conversations was a must.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a contract with the Blue Guild yet\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. We will look forward to seeing you all together later.\u201d\u201cOur guild too!\u201d\u201cYes. Whenever the time comes, let\u2019s have a meal together.\u201d\u201cI hope to maintain a good relationship no matter which guild you go to in the future.\u201d\u201cYeah. I will try to contact you first.\u201dFor all that I was worth, I didn\u2019t think my responses were that bad. I knew the importance of maintaining good relations, after all.\u201cThat was a fun demonstration.\u201d\u2018Fun? Why do I have a feeling you find it funny\u2026\u2019\u201cIt seems to have changed our perception of alchemists. Hahaha.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s a lie.\u2019\u201cThank you all. It\u2019s a little embarrassing because this is nothing compared to my other party members.\u201dHowever, I still had to keep up with the pretense. This was, after all, how social conventions worked.As I broke through the crowd, I could see Lee Sang-hee and the other Blue Guild executives looking down at me. All of them sported disturbed expressions.They had just now recognized that the negotiations were twisted from the beginning.In just a week, we learned that there were more and better opportunities in store for us from other guilds, contrary to what we were told.If one had seen our party engage in everyday conversations, of course, they could only come to one conclusion.\u2018The position of Lee Kiyoung in Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party is higher than expected.\u2019\u201cWould you mind talking for a minute? I think I have to tell you the terms of the negotiation again\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, Lee Sang-hee. You\u2019re more than welcome to.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take you inside.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d I tried my best not to smile too much.Looking back, I saw Jung Hayan, Park Deokgu, and Kim Hyunsung seemingly busy talking to others.When I entered the room where I had negotiations the last time, I honestly felt a very different atmosphere compared to the previous one. The elderly executives had now begun to pay more attention to me.\u2018Good.\u2019I liked the feeling of power.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to apologize for the hasty adjustment of the terms of the first negotiation. In fact, I thought the terms of the contract would be too generous for regular newcomers\u2026 Looking at the appearances you all showed at the demonstration, I thought that we have underestimated your potential.\u201d\u201cAlas. Fine. Of course you can understand. It is natural to avoid investing in people who are not verified by the way of standpoint of running a group. It is an extremely reasonable judgment.\u201d\u201cAh. Thank you so much for understanding.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cUnknowingly, you must have also received offers from several places.\u201dI thought there was no reason to lie. It\u2019s a fact that they already know, that I know, and that everyone knows.\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of proposals you received from other guilds, but our Blue Guild\u2026\u201dWhat I was going to hear was so obvious that I no longer needed to fully listen. They would say that the amount they could afford may be insufficient, but the truth was that this was a story of growth potential.The distinction of the Blue Guild, the special conditions that can be supported, plans for how to grow us, and how to support us; All of this, I knew I would hear time and again.\u201cYou may feel that the amount is insufficient compared to other guilds, but the Blue Guild is still one of the named guilds in the Holy Empire. If you become a member of the Blue Guild, you will have a specific budget for the party\u2026 Oh, and it\u2019s not just that. The Blue Guild\u2019s executive job\u2026\u201d\u201cSpecifically\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give you a specific answer yet, but I will do my best\u2026\u201d\u201cI see. May I hear more specific contract details?\u201d\u201cAh! Of course,\u201d Lee Sang-hee looked a little happy at this.\u201cWe offer a payment of gold and a 3,000 gold annual salary. These are the conditions we can meet. The contract period is 10 years\u2026 Salary negotiations allow renewal every year\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s 1 billion won in Korean currency.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dCompared to the Red Mercenary, this was half off the mark.Of course, in the case of the Red Mercenary Guild, Kim Hyun-sung and Park Deokgu would not be included. It was because they knew hiring an alchemist would be very expensive.However, one notable fact within Lee Sang-hee\u2019s words was that the contract had extended to three years. I now knew they were genuinely interested in our growth.If the amount you paid for the first time was already quite large, chances were, you had the potential to raise the price a little more.This was probably true, even in the case of such a large amount such as that presented by Cha Hee-ra.I smiled and began to speak.\u201cThe down payment is 15,000 gold. 1.5 billion won by Hanwha. These are the terms and conditions we are looking for.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition, I would like you to provide the minimum hero-level alchemy tool support and the adjustment of the byproducts of hunting, the hero-level spellbook for Jung Hayan, and the basic hero-level equipment for Park Deokgu and Kim Hyunsung as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can think of it as an investment. Our party will grow even further. There is a reason why I am not obsessed with salary. As our growth accelerates, the Blue Guild will also grow. I know other guilds will be willing to offer the investment we seek.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s our reason\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you need gold, you can simply sell the first bargaining right to the other guilds. However, for the Blue Guild, gold is not important right now. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dFrom Lee Sang-hee\u2019s expression, I knew I had hit the mark.\u201cGuild Master.\u201dAs expected. Of course, the Guild Master would only appear when things seemed hopelessly out of control.Nevertheless, if you couldn\u2019t even see the Blue Guild Master, you\u2019d know right away that something was wrong with the current guild.\u201cCan someone\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a simple reasoning. Take it as a suggestion, if you will.\u201dI felt like something in the atmosphere had changed.If there was a problem with the guild\u2019s executive abilities, then our growth potential would also waver. It was then that I felt like I made a little mistake.\u201cHow cheeky\u2026\u201dThis voice did not belong to Lee Sang-hee.Rather, it belonged to the voice of the old man next to me. He was staring at me with overly eager eyes.\u2018Hm?\u2019\u201cWe are not investing in you, alchemist.\u201d\u201cSeolho! What have you done!\u201d\u201cOur Blue Guild hasn\u2019t collapsed to the point of being ordered around by that guy, Lee Sang-hee.\u201d\u2018That\u2026\u2019\u201cIsn\u2019t this just a child who has not yet been in this place for a year? Yes, I am willing to bend, but not to someone like him.\u201d\u201cHold in your magic!\u201d\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019Now I understood what being on the brink of death was like.Perhaps it was because of the magic power of the old man who occupied the room, but my body had begun to tremble, and even breathing became a challenging task.The thought of dying in this room kept coming into my mind.\u201cI told you to hold in your magic power! Seolho Lee!\u201d\u201cThis crap guy\u2026 I know guys like you very well. You are the type who runs wild even when you know you cannot offer anything in return. There are a lot of different people here. Do you think I haven\u2019t seen a rat like you while living on this continent?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will not be a hassle to kill people like you. Threats always flow over this continent. No one knows when and where what will happen. This place is different from Earth. Stupid kid\u2026 Do you really not know when to tread carefully? How dare you!\u201d\u2018I\u2019m going to die,\u2019 the thought flashed in my head. It was getting harder and harder to breathe.I didn\u2019t really understand what the heck was happening.\u2018Like a beggar\u2026 Old man\u2026\u2019I wanted to run out of the door right now, but I couldn\u2019t even move my body.When I was at a point where I had to choose anything, anything at all to save me, I made my move.\u201cDo it, crazy old man.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTry it. If you can kill me, then kill me.\u201d\u201cYou dare to-!\u201d\u201cLee Seolho! Do my words really fall on flat ears?!\u201dEven with Lee Sang-hee\u2019s shouting, I let insults pour out of my mouth.\u201cA crazy old man\u2026\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cIf I die, do you think Cha Hee-ra will let you off?!\u201dThe old man shut his mouth at my words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Cha Hee-ra was here, she would have laughed. She and I had hardly talked, but it was enough for me to get a glimpse of her personality.What I spouted was some ridiculous bullshit, but it was something that the old man took at face value.Perhaps something like this had happened to him in the past.Regardless of whether they were willing to provide for us or not, I had already made it a point to possibly contact Cha Hee-ra again.Seeing that the old man was still silent at this point, he still must have been mulling over in his head. I was torn between wanting to and not wanting to know the scene that must have been playing in his head.\u201cWhat\u2026 what is this bullshit\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see if it\u2019s bullshit or not. Do you want to find out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt had gotten pretty quiet. I thought I might have gotten through him.The weight from the name, Cha Hee-ra of the Red Mercenary Guild, really did seem to be heavy. The fact that the Red Mercenary Guild had little friendly relations with the Blue Guild also did not sit well with them.Nobody wanted to mess with that monstrous clan, and it wasn\u2019t just because of the legendary stats they possessed. They were one of the largest guilds in the Holy Empire, and she was the one who had the highest stats and combat abilities among everyone we had seen today.Putting myself in the old man\u2019s shoes, killing an arrogant little boy was hardly worth gaining the potential ire of such a person. The status of the Blue Guild now seemed like a candle waiting to be extinguished by the wind.\u2018Huh. So this is how it is.\u2019A frightened dog barks the loudest, after all. This is what my grandfather has taught me.\u201cWith Cha Hee-ra\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what you need to know. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we had a relationship from Earth or whether we love each other or not. The important thing is that the Blue Guild, which has the right to bargain, threatened the new recruit who had just entered this place with force, and this should not be known outside. After all, even the Blue Guild flinches at the mention of a scary force like the Red Mercenary Guild.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how this place works, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there are enemies around\u2026 . You don\u2019t want to hand over the bargaining power you have to other guilds, and I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t take this attitude. I did not come here to fight, but to negotiate. No matter how drunk on the glory of the past, doesn\u2019t anyone seem to have a problem with this attitude, even ignoring the words of their superiors? Or, is your ability to judge the situation so low that you can\u2019t even recognize the problem now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dI stretched out slightly, finding out that I could move now. This was because the magical power that occupied this place from the moment Cha Hee-ra\u2019s name came out had faded.I slowly opened my mouth while maintaining a poker face as much as possible. It was crucial for me to hide my excitement now. I knew that in the case of this meaningless argument, the overly excited side loses.\u201cIf you want to show that the Blue Guild is free and has an atmosphere similar to that of a family, then congratulations \u2013 it\u2019s a big fucking success.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe problem is that someone you don\u2019t like runs the group.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are things you can see even if you try not to show them, Seolho Lee. It doesn\u2019t really matter how you rate me. I also know very well that Kim Hyunsung and Jung Hayan are the ones you find of worth. I understand that you don\u2019t like me. Yes, you haven\u2019t done a good job hiding it at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, you should have limited your actions. No matter how much power you have in this continent, your actions are still considered rude. I am not yet your subordinate.\u201d\u201cThis guy is still so cocky!\u201dThis was it. Someone had overworked themselves with excitement.Bang!My head automatically turned to the source, as did Lee Seolho.From a first glance, what happened was obvious. Lee Sang-hee, who couldn\u2019t be more than a subordinate, had hit the desk with her fist.\u201cLee Seolho.\u201d\u201cLee\u2026 Lee Sang-hee\u2026 .\u201d\u201cDo you know what you are doing now?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s serious.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re officially on probation. Get out and go back to the guild. Of course, right after you apologize to Kiyoung.\u201dI roughly expected this would happen.There was only one action she could take to compensate for the old man\u2019s actions, as he was obviously still drunk on their guild\u2019s long-passed glory days.\u201cI am\u2026 For the guild\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you to apologize. I won\u2019t tell you twice, Seolho Lee.\u201dAs expected, you could see a crumpled expression on the old man\u2019s face. It was too complex of a reaction. There was betrayal in there\u2026 and something else, something I couldn\u2019t quite place.However, I knew only Seolho Lee would truly understand this situation.It was only a matter of time before he would speak again.\u201cI apologize\u2026 for my rude speech\u2026 it was unreasonable\u2026\u201d\u201cI will take it, seeing as I was also a little excited. Let me apologize.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding.\u201dHis expression was not the expression of someone who was genuinely apologizing. Upon saying this, Lee Seolho hurried out of the room. I tried my hardest not to smile.As I looked at Lee Sang-hee with a gentle expression, I saw her also bowing down.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. It was due to my carelessness that I could not properly control the guild members. I really do apologize.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI could not quite get Lee Sang-hee at this point. She had been so openly inviting and genuine ever since we first met her.It wasn\u2019t just a front.It was rather embarrassing for someone like her to bow her head to a rookie, but she did it anyway and without hesitation.Unfortunately, it would be a reasonable judgment to finish at this point.\u201cNo, I\u2019m also really sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it was entirely our fault. Please\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a contract-related problem, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI was being rude.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI seemed to have come up with a story without thinking properly about the pride of the members of the Blue Guild. It was for negotiations, but I couldn\u2019t say anything that would hurt the guild. I can\u2019t justify Lee\u2019s actions no matter what, but I can\u2019t say that I did better than him.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Maybe with Cha Hee-ra\u2026\u201d\u201cI just made a small bond with luck. Getting acquainted with her will probably also help us.\u201d\u201cWould that mean\u2026 May I accept it as a means of accepting the contract positively?\u201d\u201cOf course. The terms of the contract will also be agreed with 10,000 gold instead of 15,000 gold. However\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI would like you to reconsider the holders of the main executive positions of the Blue Guild.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI think you can understand why I am making this proposal.\u201dThere was no guarantee that a dog-like situation like the one before will not happen again. There was also no guarantee that Seolho Lee would be the only man to act like that.I did not intend to fall victim to any old geezer who wanted to try and crush me.If it were a political fight, I would welcome it. However, this situation could make or break me.\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s simply a position of words.\u201dI\u2019m guessing my value has risen more than before.First of all, the biggest reason was that this side now had contact with the Mercenary Queen Cha Hee-ra. Recruiting our party would provide room for the Blue Guild to rub against the Red Mercenaries.Of course, that was a big, fat lie. There was no reason for blue to start mixing with red.If so, holding hands was an advantage that could not be converted into true value. It wasn\u2019t just that either. They may also be thinking that we were suitable as a control force against the stagnant water that gnaws at guilds.Perhaps, for her, the out-of-control gangs would be quite a headache. Considering the sudden behavior just minutes before, this guild had several problems.It was for me, for her, and for the guild, that I proposed for them to give up a major executive position.It was like saying, \u2018I\u2019ll fix this for you.\u2019Of course, there must be a difference between the outcome I wanted and the outcome she wanted, but I thought there would be no disagreement over the need to purify the rotten water.\u201cIn fact\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIn the case of down payments, we can make the most of it. I didn\u2019t even think about the major executive positions\u2026 I\u2019m just cautious because it seems like you\u2019re asking for a slightly larger rank than I think. Am I right?\u201dThere was no need to lie.I nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAs well as\u2026 I would like to tell you in advance that it can be difficult right now in the case of hero-grade items. It would be possible if you provided some time, but right now\u2026\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u2018So, they are more valuable than I thought.\u2019I didn\u2019t know if it was because of Ramus Tucker\u2019s Introduction to Alchemy, which casually popped out of Kim Hyunsung\u2019s magic bag, but I started to look at the top-level items a bit humorously.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay for the item right away. Unless our equipment is available right now\u2026\u201d\u201cAh! If so, can I tell you after the internal meeting? It won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not an easy decision, so you can take your time.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dThis was the outcome I was expecting right from the start, anyway. The only remaining issue would be what items are paid and how high the status would be guaranteed.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be on my way now.\u201d\u201cYeah. Thank you, Kiyoung. And once again, I apologize for the rudeness.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I am also very sorry.\u201dI knew I also had to talk to another person before the day ended.\u2018Cha Hee-ra\u2026\u2019Was I playing with fire? I really didn\u2019t know what could happen on this continent.Kim Hyunsung, who was well-known, may suddenly be preyed on, or some crazy old man, like Seolho Lee, might make an elaborate plan to victimize me.The reality was that we would not be safe with whatever we picked as a party.\u2018I need to have a backbone from now on.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, it was just that I wouldn\u2019t ever join the Blue Guild. In my view, it was a guild that was already stepping on the train to ruin. Not to mention, it was run by a group of old guys whose contributions only weighed as much as a pile of dung.If one were to think about this rationally, it was completely irrational to pick Blue Guild.I knew it was because of people like Lee Seolho, who brought down the guild. Even Lee Sang-hee was at fault for allowing her guild members to be so unruly at just the slightest insult.No wonder they were often ignored by other guilds. They truly made it look like joining the Blue Guild was like joining a sinking ship \u2013 doomed right from the very beginning.It must be so fun and exciting to join a guild such as the Red Mercenary and watch as the Blue Guild fall to its ruin, but I wasn\u2019t overly confident with my own skills, either.We couldn\u2019t expect change to come just because we joined the Blue Guild. That would be the same not only for me but also for Kim Hyunsung. Our crafty leader was still very careful.Nevertheless, Kim Hyunsung obviously wanted to join Blue. That had been a fact since the beginning.Of course, it didn\u2019t seem like I didn\u2019t think about any of the other options, but until this moment, everyone thought it would be the best decision. I was only sure of one thing.Whether it was the distant or the near future, joining Blue would be much more beneficial than joining Red.We would already be treated as a team with high potential, so there was no need for us to look for another route just because the path we were presented with would prove to be rocky. On that same note, it would be absurd for me to back out just because of a few crazy old men.Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that I would completely disregard this fact.\u2018My safety.\u2019My safety was the most important. The reason for finding Cha Hee-ra in the first place was to ensure my safety. Her name weighed heavily on everyone here.I could not rely on Kim Hyunsung\u2019s plans forever. I also had to find other ways to protect myself.\u2018I can handle it.\u2019A guild filled with senile old men? I could handle that. I hated gambling, but felt like now was the necessary time to play.\u201cYou mean the Red Mercenary?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going back to her for a while.\u201d\u201cWhy all of a sudden\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something to talk about with the Mercenary Queen.\u201d\u201cWith Cha Hee-ra? Are you serious?\u201dI nodded roughly.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expression showed his uncertainty while Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan seemed positively opposed to the idea.Their reactions were not unreasonable, and I knew it too. After all, why would I bother going back to the same, dangerous woman who had openly kissed me in front of everyone?Jung Hayan seemed to be the most affected, as her skin had turned into a ghastly pale color.\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, Hyung\u2026 Why must you do that?\u201d\u201cIt would be helpful for the party.\u201d\u201cEven though\u2026 to that woman\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, Oppa\u2026\u201d Jung Hayan\u2019s stricken expression worried me. I hadn\u2019t yet cleared things up with her ever since the incident, after all, and now, hearing that I would talk to Cha Hee-ra again spelled bad news.Honestly, I was anxious about what kind of conversation we would have, but if this meant that I would gain another safety backup, then I would willingly take the risk.\u201cCan I ask why?\u201dThere was no reason to lie in this scenario.\u201cI thought I needed someone to look behind me. I\u2019ll tell you a little more about it after things go well.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see,\u201d Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expression showed that he did not disapprove of my plans. He probably knew why I was doing this, and thus felt no reason to stop me.Jung Hayan, however, still sported a frightened expression. She might be thinking that I would have her replaced, but of course, that was not the case.Her lips were parted, almost as if she wanted to intervene between my conversation with Kim Hyunsung. However, with much restraint, she did not speak. Park Deokgu was practically the same.I had no choice but to calm Jung Hayan down by holding her hand for a moment.\u201cI won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 o-okay.\u201dSeeing Jung Hayan\u2019s normal reaction \u2013 which was to blush \u2013 had some of the color return to her cheeks. Park Deokgu seemed to have cheered up upon hearing this as well, and a smile spread across his face. He had started to turn and walk away with her when she spoke again.\u201cOppa\u2026 Don\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cTrust me. I\u2019m just going to share our story with her. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 Oppa\u2026 I\u2019ll go, too.\u201d\u201cIt would be better for me to go alone.\u201d\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d her voice gradually trailed off.It was a slightly expected situation, but even I felt a chill when Jung Hayan settled for silence. However, it was important for me to do this, as this would also help the party.As talented as she was, Jung Hayan could not protect me as she was right now.I gently pushed her against the wall. From her startled expression, she wasn\u2019t expecting me to do so.\u201cO-Oppa\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t speak. Instead, I lifted her chin up with one hand.Jung Hayan immediately turned as red as a tomato upon my bold action. She blinked up at me, once, twice, trying to understand what it was that I was planning to do.\u201cOppa\u2026 Oppa\u2026\u201dI slowly began to bring my face closer to hers, gazing down at her so tenderly that she could hardly react.And then, I kissed her.There was genuinely no emotion. It was just a simple little kiss, but it seemed to be enough for Jung Hayan. After I wrapped my arms around her, our tongues began to entangle themselves as the kiss began to deepen.I hadn\u2019t planned to take it this far yet, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. I had to appease her in one way or another.The hands that gripped my hair pulled, and it became a painful sensation, but there was something about the kiss and the way she held onto me that seemed to make this into a pleasurable feeling all in all.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI only planned on kissing her, but it seemed that Jung Hayan had other plans. She was relentlessly nibbling away at my bottom lip and holding me close, her hidden desires coming up to the surface. Because of this, it was hard to break free from her.It was only after she realized that I needed to catch my breath that I was able to step back. However, Jung Hayan\u2019s wanting expression had successfully drawn me in once more.\u201cOppa, oppa, oppa\u2026\u201dI kissed her again. There was no reason to avoid her want for intimacy. If there was a time for foolishness, then that time was now.I didn\u2019t know if it was intended, but Jung Hayan had started biting and suckling on my tongue. A slightly sore feeling emerged from the sensation. Although I didn\u2019t necessarily like it, I did not complain about it, either.It was only after a few seconds that Jung Hayan realized what we were doing, and she drew back to look up at me in surprise. Smiling down at her, I leaned in to whisper softly right into her ear.\u201cI like you.\u201dUpon hearing my words, I could see her struggling to contain her joy.\u201cMe too\u2026 I\u2026 I love you\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to be able to protect what we have now.\u201dHalf of what I said was sincere. Too bad, she didn\u2019t know the hidden message I wished to convey with my words.\u201cMe too\u2026 Me too\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to get hurt.\u201d\u201cMe, too!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why this is necessary. We need to have a good relationship with Cha Hee-ra because we are not strong yet.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not strong, either\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you get why I\u2019m doing this now?\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will be fine. Please, trust me.\u201dJung Hayan shut her mouth, her expression shifting into a more complicated one. I could guess what she was thinking, but I didn\u2019t try my best to decipher it properly.Instead, I squeezed her hand and gave her a light kiss.This was no big deal. She would understand.Jung Hayan seemed to know that I was in a position of being sold out, but I was only planning on holding a conversation with Cha Hee-ra. I didn\u2019t bother explaining.\u2018Good.\u2019After all, one couldn\u2019t really believe an unpredictable woman.Anyway, after the steps I had taken today, Jung Hayan would definitely be immersed in her growth a little more from now on. However, I knew she was still worried about me going to see Cha Hee-ra.I couldn\u2019t help it; I had to laugh. She was getting so anxious over nothing.\u201cThe same thing won\u2019t happen this time.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Alas\u2026\u201dI had never said these words out loud before, but it seemed to have done the trick. Jung Hayan\u2019s legs wobbled, almost as if she was on the brink of falling to her knees.After I kissed her on the forehead once more, I began to walk away.Some of my plans did not go as intended. I ended up rushing my relationship with Jung Hayan because of the circumstances that presented themselves to us.Of course, this did not necessarily mean that it was a bad thing. Our relationship had gotten stronger, which meant a stronger attachment. This would serve me well in the long run.\u2018Crazy old man.\u2019It was not only Jung Hayan who lacked proper strength. It was also me. Therefore, we had to find a way to get past this shortcoming.Shaking my head to rid myself of these thoughts, I continued making my way out, my mind already set into analytical mode.It wasn\u2019t long before I reached the place where the Red Mercenary Guild was staying. A guild member who saw me with his startled eyes began to rush over.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI came to see Cha Hee-ra.\u201d\u201cAh! Could you wait a minute?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dIt almost felt like they had been waiting for me all this time.\u201cYou just have to go inside. She is in the last room.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you.\u201dAs I walked, I tried to find the right words to say. However, it wasn\u2019t easy to do so in a situation like this.\u2018You shouldn\u2019t be so interested in Cha Hee-ra, Lee Kiyoung.\u2019If I really planned on joining the Red Mercenary Guild, then maybe the situation about how I felt would have changed. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case.I knocked on the door. A voice immediately came from inside.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs I opened the door, I saw a familiar woman lying in bed and yawning. She was still wearing the same bold attire, her red hair as daring and unruly as ever.Like last time, I fumbled about where to look, but I was faster to regain my senses. I decided to stare at her eye to eye.\u201cDid your thoughts change?\u201d\u201cNot like that.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 You have to explain why you chose to come here alone. I was having a pleasant dream until you came. Honestly, this is a little unsettling. I can\u2019t just calmly sit around watching as the younger girl you came with gets to have you as her lover.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euI blinked. I suddenly forgot how I planned to start my story. I couldn\u2019t, for the life of me, understand this woman at all.Did one automatically become immune to embarrassment once they were aware of how they looked? I did not know.As I was in the position to make an offer, I needed to be just as confident as her. Taking a deep breath, I collected my thoughts and blurted out what I had planned to say all along.\u201cI want you to be a sponsor.\u201dThere was a stunned silence.After a few seconds, Cha Hee-ra recovered from her surprised expression and faced me with an expression that showcased her newfound interest.\u201cHmm\u2026 you are indeed very interesting.\u201d\u2018What was she talking about\u2026?.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It might not look that good-looking to a lot of people, but it looks attractive to me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, it doesn\u2019t mean that my desire to buy you has disappeared. Still, I think I should try and see if you can be a product I can trust and use\u2026 What do you think?\u201dWith her legs crossed, she calmly and invitingly patted the empty space on the bed next to her. Only then did I find out what she meant for me to do.My face turned red in an instant.\u2018What\u2026\u2019Was she really going to go about the matter at hand in this manner? I knew it would be a mistake to think of her as a dumb woman, but I honestly didn\u2019t expect her to make this kind of offer.\u2018Is she really not taking this seriously?\u2019She probably was.I brought my hands up as a sign of deference, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d\u201cThen what did you mean by that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cKiyoung Lee, my investment in you is the only story I was willing to hear when you came to our guild. Of course, if you came with your lovely lover, then I wouldn\u2019t mind. However, even if you come alone, I\u2019m willing to accept you into my guild. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very talented, but\u2026 I\u2019m not very negative about alchemy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to have a good relationship.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s ridiculous to ask for this investment even after you move to another guild. That\u2019s not my role. It\u2019s your guild\u2019s job. Would you invest in someone who will give you nothing? Rather, it seems like a more profitable business to give money in exchange for playing with you in bed several times a month. You give me service, and I can compensate you for it. Do you understand?\u201d\u2018Damn.\u2019The facts that had come up hit too hard.In other words, Cha Hee-ra was basically saying that she\u2019d rather invest in my body than in my own personal growth. Honestly speaking, though, it didn\u2019t seem like such a bad proposal.I didn\u2019t know if she was acting or not, but she seemed to want me as of the moment. Of course, I had to consider the fact that she thought of me as a toy, not as a person.I hated myself for my pride \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 for debating whether or not it would be better for me to simply be her pet, following her every beck and call.Nevertheless\u2026\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019I couldn\u2019t simply devalue my worth in that manner. Once Cha Hee-ra is tired of me in bed, she\u2019d get tired of me as an investment, too.I didn\u2019t want anything like that.\u201cOf course I can understand, Cha Hee-ra. I am not asking you to be a personal sponsor. I\u2019m asking for you to be the sponsor of our party, which was the first to finish this tutorial. Kim Hyunsung and Jung Hayan will surely grow. One of them may grow up to be the strongest within the continent.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cSo what? Whether they grow up or not, it has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m already one of the strongest this continent can count on. Our guild\u2019s members are also superior to most. Although we lack wizards, it is easy to dazzle some with the amount of gold we have. The Red Mercenary is the type of guild who doesn\u2019t lack the financial means to do so. Even if Jung Hayan grows, it will take at least three years before then. Why would I be sponsoring you for that long a time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAll I need are wizards for my guild. I don\u2019t need anything else. If you\u2019re going to keep spouting out nonsensical things, then why don\u2019t you come over and show me your charm instead? I\u2019ll give you a good price so you don\u2019t feel disappointed, and I\u2019ll bring you gifts often.\u201d\u2018Damn, she really wants me to be her pet\u2026\u2019It felt embarrassing for her to explicitly state giving me money and gifts in exchange for bed service. I felt like no matter what I said, she would take it as a joke.Slowly, I took out an artifact that I had been hiding and held it out to her.Cha Hee-ra looked on, curious as to what I was bringing out. However, upon closer inspection, her face registered recognition.It was the item she put in my arms when I first met.[Magic Pendant-Rare Grade][It is a pendant that increases magic power by 3. It has a function that amplifies the magic effect. It is not known exactly where it was found.]\u201cI don\u2019t need anything like this.\u201dIn an instant, the pendant had been knocked askew, landing onto the bed. I didn\u2019t know what was going on in her mind now.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dIt was certainly irrational for me to continue, but I had to take the risk.\u201cNot gold. I don\u2019t need gold.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat I need is your reputation and strength. You have a reputation as the Mercenary Queen Cha Hee-ra, but I don\u2019t care about those things, either.\u201d\u201cYou, do you understand what you are doing now? Not touching new recruits is something that everyone has implicitly agreed upon, but coming out in such a bold manner will not be good for you. Since good offers keep flying in your direction, it seems that you have become more determined than before.\u201d\u201cOf course I still know where I stand. This world is the kind of world where you can be admired one day, and then murdered in the next, all without a lot of people knowing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo. What do you say?\u201dLife and magic began to fill the room as I looked up to stare at Cha Hee-ra. The pressure was more than Lee Seolho could ever emit. This was, after all, the power of the Mercenary Queen. However, unlike the old geezer, she did not intend to harm me with it.\u201cI find this fun. I think I\u2019m more annoyed because I know where you\u2019re coming from, and how you should go about it. It\u2019s been a while, but my interest has been piqued because I can see just what type of personality you have. To be honest, I really like it. There are not a lot of men who can be this confident in front of me\u2026 I don\u2019t know the last time I\u2019ve been treated like this. And to think, it\u2019d be a newcomer who would dare treat me this way\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut are you aware that the degree that you\u2019re asking for is a little bit too much? Hey. Originally, alchemy is said to be an equivalent exchange. If you\u2019re going to use me as your shield, you\u2019ll probably have a product equivalent to what I can offer, right? If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be responsible for what you did.\u201dI almost forgot about the pressure in holding a conversation like this. However, it wasn\u2019t going as badly as I expected it to go.After all, Cha Hee-ra was actually willing to listen to what I had to say.\u201cWell? Say it.\u201d\u201cThis is the stake in the potion that I will make in the future.\u201dWith a trembling hand, I took out a hero-grade book from my chest and threw it on the ground. A curious expression emerged in Cha Hee-ra\u2019s face.\u201cIt sounds like you can actually be capable\u2026 I don\u2019t know where you got the hero-grade book, but is that all I\u2019ll be getting?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you one percent.\u201d\u201cOne percent?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You will be sitting on the money cushion soon enough.\u201dIt could have very well been a lie or a bluff on my part, but I knew she would find it in herself to trust me. Why?Because there was no reason for me to risk my life on such a lie.\u201cSecondly, you will be able to establish a friendly relationship with our party.\u201d\u201cI already told you. I am not interested in things that are not mine.\u201d\u201cWe will grow beyond your imagination.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try and scam me.\u201d\u201cI am not kidding. We will be strong and we will soon be representing this empire. If we establish good relations with the Red Mercenaries, then we will always be with you. With a small investment, you will be able to build a good relationship with us in the future, before any guild or faction comes in the way.\u201d\u201cDo you know that what you\u2019re talking about is the bravado of snake-tongued men? Even if there is no investment cost, there is no guarantee that your potion will be of any value or that your party can grow.\u201d\u201cThird.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you the wizard you need.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d\u201cOut of the people who came out after the end of this tutorial, I will select the people who can achieve proper efficiency within at least three years- no, make that two years. I will make a chart and give the list to you.\u201dI saw her quietly mulling this over.If the Red Mercenary Guild\u2019s project was just beginning, my suggestion would definitely be appealing to her.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, but\u2026 is it possible?\u201d\u201cThe main reason why I am confident is that I will soon become a Blue executive with bargaining rights.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThe second reason is\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter all, alchemy was originally said to be an equivalent exchange.\u201dOf course, I would never tell her how exactly I would be able to distinguish the talented ones.Her protection was important, but it still wasn\u2019t worth my secret.Cha Hee-ra remained silent.I knew she must still be thinking that her compensation still weighed heavily compared to my offer. I kept myself carefully composed. I knew there was a high chance that she\u2019d give in.However, at the same time, I knew she might not.I could see her trying to work out the pros and cons in her head,\u2018Shit.\u2019Was she really not going to consider our offer?I thought I convinced her that our party was set to grow and that I would be able to offer her the best wizards among this batch.It wasn\u2019t a perfect set of conditions, but I could see that it was good enough to work on.\u2018Has she looked into this too much?\u2019 I bit my lip out of nervousness.\u201cThe share of the potion you will make is 3%, not 1%. I\u2019ll make sure to get a list of melee workers as well as a list from the wizards. And, I\u2019ll decide how to go about this.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you not need my protection? No one will ever touch you. However, that means I must be the one to decide.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find out about that today. So, are you going to do it or not?\u201dOf course, there was no reason to refuse.\u201cPlease take good care of me.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take some time to talk again later. Separately.\u201d Cha Hee-ra gestured to the door, and I knew she meant for me to leave. However, there was a satisfactory expression on her face.\u201cI realized that I liked this offer way more than I should\u2019ve.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s a success!\u2019At the same time that I exited the room, a bunch of people out on the hallway rushed inside. All of them appeared to be in the higher positions within the Red Mercenary Guild. Sure enough, when I used my abilities, I was correct. Were they this excited to know how our meeting had turned out?Cha Hee-ra had already agreed to protect me at a price. However, how exactly would she go about with this protection?The moment I exited their quarters, the answer came to me. A status window popped out of the blue.[You have obtained a title.]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Title-The Gigolo of the Mercenary Queen]\u201cShit.\u201dIt was my first-ever title.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNegotiations with the Blue Guild proceeded smoothly.Almost immediately after opening up a personal account, our down payment came flowing in. It went exactly as Lee Sang-hee promised. The plan had always been to join Blue, but now that I\u2019d gotten the most out of the rewards that we could receive, it seemed an increasingly better choice.Compared to the Red Mercenary Guild, whose authority rested solely on the Guild Master, Blue\u2019s organization system was subdivided and more complicated than expected. There were Guild Masters and Sub-guild Masters. Each comprised six teams under them, along with several administrative positions.To put it simply, the Blue Guild was made up of six sub-guilds, each party ranging from five to fifteen people. Because of this, I had a clue as to why Kim Hyunsung liked Blue.\u2018It\u2019s more comfortable to move together in a guild with a system like this.\u2019As soon as we entered the guild, however, the number of sub-guilds was bumped up to seven. The leader of the newest sub-guild was, obviously, Kim Hyunsung. Although our party technically didn\u2019t have an official position within Blue yet, they had assured us that it would get taken care of soon enough.That was everything that Blue Guild had provided for us.What remained in the agreement were the hero-grade items that were not yet given, and the guild position that I deserved.I was quite worried about where Lee Sang-hee would place me. I did not want to be put in a position where I would have to face rotten old chaps like Lee Seolho, who would probably judge me the minute I walked through the door.Fortunately, the position that was entitled to me shortly afterward did not have any arrogant executives that would boss me around.\u2018Non-combat military special administrative officer, huh?\u2019At first glance, it was a position that seemed vague and entirely unimportant \u2013 a placeholder position, if you will. However, Lee Sang-hee decided to place me into an executive position on my own, even though normal party members weren\u2019t supposed to be allowed that.\u2018Anyway, this is good.\u2019Because of my proposal, the Blue Guild had taken another aspect that would soon inform them of its importance. Aside from this, my position as a non-combat military special administrative officer would also pave the way for my team\u2019s future growth.I didn\u2019t exactly know what kind of jobs my position would have me doing, but I figured it could wait. I also knew there was something Lee Sang-hee was trying to achieve. Otherwise, why would she be in such a hurry to grant me a position?\u201cMr. Kiyoung, a gift has arrived outside for you.\u201d\u201cAh. Thank you, Mr. Hyunsung.\u201dI knew what kind of \u2018gift\u2019 this was. It was courtesy of my position as the Red Mercenary Queen\u2019s Gigolo.\u2018What would she be giving me this time around?\u2019I knew I made it seem as if I was highly confident about what I could bring to the table, but the truth was I was slightly worried about what Cha Hee-ra had planned for me. At first, I thought it was the madwoman planning to take revenge on me, but when valuable gifts and handwritten letters came, I knew she had decided to take this investment seriously.Our talk had, after all, become a success. There would not be a single lunatic in the continent who would dare attack the Red Mercenary Queen\u2019s Gigolo.\u2018Still\u2026.\u2019\u201cThis is not it.\u201dHer method of showing her protection was not what I had been expecting at all.Of course, unlike me, who felt a little disturbed, the Blue Guild seemed to warm up to the idea of Cha Hee-ra giving me gifts. To them, it probably seemed as if she was also trying to get closer to the guild, eventually leading to relations that would help in the future, which was helpful for my position in the guild. I knew my position and influence would only continue to rise from here on out. However, I was also bound to receive unwanted attention, whether from inside or outside the guild.\u2018There\u2019s been a rumor that Cha Hee-ra, the Mercenary Queen of the Red Mercenary Guild, had been unable to escape the charms of one of the dungeon newbies. Therefore, he has become her latest conquest.\u2019Aside from this disgusting rumor, there were also countless other hearsays, one being more scandalous than the next. I was either a two-timer, an irresistible lover in bed, or that I knew Cha Hee-ra from my time on Earth.I could bet that the Red Mercenary Guild members themselves had started all these rumors. Seeing as it was such a large guild, I knew that the gossip would eventually reach even the doors of the Holy Empire.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019Kim Hyunsung stood next to me; both eyes shaped like startled \u2018O\u2019s as he regarded the pile of items Cha Hee-ra had sent.I could not stop myself from blushing with embarrassment. I did not want to know what he was thinking.\u201cCan you tell me what both of you talked about?\u201d\u201cNothing much. I asked her to sponsor us, and she agreed. This is probably her idea of a bad joke.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Maybe so. However, looking at the gifts, it seems that my dear friend Kiyoung certainly left a good impression on her.\u201dLooking at the items piled up in front of the building at Kim Hyunsung\u2019s words, I had no choice but to realize why this kind of misunderstanding seemed to spark his skepticism.[Ancient Republic\u2019s Drug Manufacturing Alchemy Kit-Hero Grade][This is an alchemy kit that has been passed down as a tradition in the ancient republic. These basic pieces of equipment found in underground laboratories remain in good shape even today. Although it seems to have been treated with special chemicals, this item is excellent in quality and performance described as simple equipment. Potion production success rate increases. This temporarily raises the user\u2019s luck value.]It wasn\u2019t just this that was in a pile.[Minotaur\u2019s tendon-Rare grade][Benshi\u2019s Magic Essence-Rare Grade][Troll\u2019s Blood-Rare Grade][Unidentified Monster Blood-Rare Grade][Holy Water of the Holy Empire-Rare Grade]All kinds of catalysts used in alchemy were neatly stacked inside boxes.To make matters worse, a letter piled neatly on top of the boxes, handwritten and openly affectionate in its wording.\u2018This is a token of my appreciation. It\u2019s no big deal, but I hope you\u2019ll accept it. Sending love to my best friend in the world, Cha Hee-ra.\u2019\u2018This\u2026 shit\u2026\u2019Of course, I didn\u2019t hate the gesture. It wasn\u2019t every day you were showered with such rare and dazzling items that you could use to your heart\u2019s desire. I could care less about the rumors that people would spread about me.The problem was Jung Hayan.Of course, she had always been the only problem in most of my endeavors.When the first gift arrived, and the rumors began to spread, her expression was beyond words.I was worried about what Jung Hayan would think, or how she would act once the first present came sailing through the door, but she eventually had to accept the fact that she wouldn\u2019t be able to do all these things for me \u2013 at least, not yet.Of course, I had no intimate relationship with Cha Hee-ra. I spent a lot of time trying to persuade Jung Hayan of this, complete with a ton of \u2018I love you\u2019s and hugging, but Jung Hayan also spent a lot of time to herself and thinking alone.Once I had turned my attention to my priorities, I worried that immediately immersing myself in magic training would overwhelm me. I spent a measly amount of time sleeping and spent the rest working on my power and influence.I knew if this continued, Jung Hayan would eventually break from her doubts.It was a time to reaffirm each other\u2019s feelings, but for her, it was also a time to make sure I stayed away from such dirty things as those stated in the rumors.\u201cJung Hayan\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Hayan will probably be at the lake in the back. It seems that she is currently training for water-based magic. Therefore, you will probably find her over there. Mr. Deokgu, on the other hand\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHe seems to be building a boat on the shore. He\u2019s been at it since this morning.\u201d\u201cA boat?\u201d\u201cYeah. It seems that Miss Hayan has been looking at the lake and is thinking about doing some boating. I thought it would be helpful for their training, so I left them to their own devices.\u201dA shiver ran down my spine at this.\u2018Park Deok-gu\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t know what he was trying to do at this point, but I felt like it wasn\u2019t anything good. As I tried to force myself out of my thoughts, Kim Hyunsung spoke to me.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the guild these days? Do you know?\u201d\u201cYeah, of course I do. Admittedly though, it\u2019s been a little hard keeping up with the meetings, but I know a little about what\u2019s happening. It seems that tutorial dungeons are now opening in other places as well. The transfer market will also open sooner or later, but unfortunately, Blue did not have the capacity to invest in the attack group. There will be at most one or two new recruits coming to join our party. I saw some survivors that had more potential than the rest, so I think we should invest in them.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Their optimism is probably because of us.\u201dThat was perfectly correct.\u201cYes, I agree. However, if possible, we are thinking about using a down payment for the people who will join our party\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea. I think our team will be a little happier with more members.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad then. How about you? What\u2019ve you been planning?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of entering the dungeon by collaborating with the other parties in our guild. It would be a good way for Blue to grow in terms of stats. Of course, it will be after all this work is finished, but it would be better to prepare in advance.\u201d\u201cWhich dungeon?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been decided yet. Personally, I think it will be an experience to search for a dungeon that has not yet been discovered, but it seems that the guild is thinking of starting with basic hunting.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cWe have a meeting now, so let\u2019s go in first. Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cAh. Alright. You go ahead.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then we\u2019ll see you in a minute.\u201d Kim Hyunsung nodded at me.I still acknowledged Kim Hyunsung as the leader, of course, and I helped with whatever he needed when it came to external relations.After the tutorials, we brought in those who weren\u2019t selected or selected before but were now on the market. Since I knew Kim Hyunsung would be busy with other matters, this job would probably fall to me.I knew he was thinking that I was doing my job better than he first imagined.We had only known each other for a short period, but it was nice to know that he was satisfied with what he had chosen to invest in.\u2018He\u2019s probably thinking about trusting me a little more.\u2019It is better for him to think that I could be useful in many different ways. I knew sooner or later, Kim Hyunsung would slowly reveal a little more of whatever he was planning.Going back to reality, I knew my next choice of action would be to head to the training center, where all the \u2018newer\u2019 newbies were gathered. It had served as the temporary quarters of the new dungeon survivors.If I were to measure the time it had taken for my conversation with Kim Hyunsung to take place, I could guess that their briefing was over.It was natural for me to prepare for recruitment. After all, part of the deal was to prepare a list to be sent to Cha Hee-ra. Therefore, I needed to arrive earlier than others.\u201cToday, the executives of the Blue Guild are scheduled to visit. You will have to complete short or long training and receive offers or apply to each guild. We would be grateful if you could act accordingly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe training to be held today seemed to be a much-awaited event. As I stepped forward, people automatically came up to greet me.\u201cYou are in trouble.\u201d\u201cAh! No, team leader.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t even officially appointed you yet, Instructor.\u201d\u201cHaha. Still, Mr. Kiyoung will soon become the Blue Guild\u2019s new pillar.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying so.\u201d\u201cRather than that\u2026 There is still some time left before the training event starts\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. I think it would be better to take a look at the survivors in advance. Because you gave me an undeserved position, I have to do my best to prove my worth.\u201d\u201cIndeed\u2026\u201dIt was only a brief conversation, but I could already deduce what these people were thinking.Those who didn\u2019t know me were just nervous about having a person with such a high position come, but the people who knew me back at the shelter couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on.\u2018I could get used to this feeling of power.\u2019Those who had expressions of disbelief marked on their faces were laughable. After all, we came from the same tutorial dungeon. We all stayed in the same shelter. We all managed to escape.With this in mind, why was the difference between them and me so big?I let my eyes roam over the venue, my lips curling up into a discreet smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWe were in an ironic situation where one had become a guild\u2019s executive, and the others were looking for someone to take them in, even though we all started together.I couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved that I did not become one of them.When I looked around, I saw Lee Ji-Hye and other familiar people from back in the shelter. They didn\u2019t look all that bad. Considering that I\u2019ve been through some pretty hard training myself, I was also in good shape. We were the newest investments of the Blue Guild, after all. It was only normal that they would work hard to manage our improvement.When I thought back to the time where I couldn\u2019t adapt initially, I realized that I\u2019ve come to accept this world\u2019s reality, almost forgetting that this wasn\u2019t the world where I came from. I couldn\u2019t believe that I\u2019d been so preoccupied that I\u2019d forgotten about this fact.Except for those I\u2019d interacted with inside the shelter, I did not recognize the other people crowded around. It did not take long for me to access their stat information and potential with my ability. These were not easily noticeable from every person\u2019s outward appearance, so I was beginning to feel glad that I had the ability with which I could use to gauge their power.Although there were a few rare ones, I knew Cha Hee-ra would not deem them worthy enough. Still, I found it important to go through everyone so I wouldn\u2019t miss out on a good investment.\u201cI think everyone looks promising.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt was the expression of the trainees and the expression of the assigned instructor that made me feel good about myself. They were all painfully aware of the new power I wielded and thus felt wary around me.Among the seven parties operated by the Blue Guild, they were not worthy enough to be chosen after all. If I were them, my best course of action would be to band together and prove my worth by getting stronger. Getting into a guild wasn\u2019t all about the gold. It was also about getting your support system in any situation.With the instructor, I could guess that he felt too arrogant in being chosen by the Blue Guild but ended up getting the meager task of becoming their errand boy. Little did he know that the real investment the Blue Guild participated in were for people with real potential.The recruitment system also made individuals devalue themselves after not being chosen when they could be talented all on their own.When I looked at the instructor through my ability-activated eyes, I took careful notice of his growth limit.\u2018His stats are low overall\u2026\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not been long since I came here, but\u2026 I\u2019m curious about how education works here.\u201d\u201cOh? I can explain it to you if you want me to. It\u2019s not that hard to understand.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the first place, the goal is to get the people here their jobs, but in fact, there are only a few who actually achieve this. I guess you know that these few are the talented ones in the batch.\u201dAt his mentioning of \u2018talented ones,\u2019 I knew Jung Hayan would be a prime example of this.\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cPeople who have survived the dungeon without indulging in any combat have a hard time finding their aptitudes, so they receive training almost immediately. In the case of wizards and priests, they usually check whether they have the potential for magical power. If not, they are automatically transferred to melee. Those who judge that they cannot fight, whether through basic combat methods or other tactics, will enter the non-combat army and receive separate vocational training.\u201d\u201cVocational education\u2026\u201d\u201cThat means cooking, cleaning, among many others. Some are employed in restaurants and forges run by the imperialists, while others are engaged in service jobs like beauty salons by utilizing their specialties from Earth.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. Sometimes, the guilds also recruit for vocational purposes. Cha Hee-ra of the Red Mercenary Guild also has a hair designer in the guild.\u201d\u201cAhhh. Yes. I know.\u201d I nodded as if I knew, although, in reality, I had only heard of this now. It surprised me. I knew women were particular about their looks, but I never took Cha Hee-ra to act in that manner.\u201cThen, in the case of those who fall into the non-combat army\u2026\u201d\u201cI usually respect all choices, but I don\u2019t recommend it at the training center level. If you are pushed to the continent without a clear aptitude, the result won\u2019t be very good. Chances are, you won\u2019t get recruited. Though you can find somewhere else to offer your services and receive adequate payment\u2026 Well, most people still want to belong somewhere, you know?\u201cThat sounds understandable.\u201d\u201cYeah. Most of them want to go to a medium or large guild, but\u2026 Guilds have already established their standings aren\u2019t interested in recruiting, rookie or not rookie. However, fret not Kiyoung, you\u2019d be a hot commodity regardless.\u201dI blinked. I had heard this a lot. Was it flattery, or was there a meaning hidden underneath?\u201cHow about small to medium clans?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say about them, but the situation is worse for small and medium clans. Most of those who did not receive contact from large or medium-sized guilds end up entering the smaller ones. It cannot be said that the survival rate of new recruits in small and medium clans is high.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason why?\u201d\u201cCompared to the large guilds, there is hardly any available space, so the first reason is forceful eviction. Although it may vary from guild to guild, there are quite a few of those kinds of clans here, just as there are black companies on Earth. Accidents that arise from excessively outsourcing of large guilds are also common accidents\u2026 There are more and more Guild Masters who exploit guild members to achieve desired results. Those who die without a granted insurance are also another reason.\u201d\u201cI see what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t think I need to hear more.\u2019You can see how this continent worked and operated. In truth, the harshness of it was the perfect twin of modern society back in my old world.Large guilds are the object of everyone\u2019s envy, and small and medium-sized clans take those considered the \u2018leftovers,\u2019 most of the time having to throw them in the end. I knew for sure there was a difference in salary as well.If the tutorial dungeon proved to be hard, then the continent itself was hell.What interested me were the non-combat and vocational choices that the instructor had mentioned. I took a mental note to check these people out.After all, there may be people who were selling bread lazily without realizing their inner talents.\u201cOther than that, we have time to educate ourselves on the general common sense of the continent. The relationship and history of the guild, the Holy Empire and the Republic, and the Kingdom Union.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a part of this world we haven\u2019t learned properly yet.\u201d\u201cIn the case of the team leader, training will be conducted at the guild level. The same goes for trainees. Even if someone among the remaining members enters another guild or clan, training will still be separated for each guild. You see, we have a separate training period to grow new recruits to their true potentials.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the case of Blue, training is relatively loose and easy to understand, but in the case of other guilds, it is a bit tricky.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you for informing me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure. I\u2019m very happy to be able to help.\u201dWith this, I tapped him on the shoulder. It may have been just a simple, cheeky act, but the instructor\u2019s mouth hung open.\u201cI will repay you for the story you gave today.\u201d\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no. Thank you very much.\u201dIt was for my benefit as much as his. I knew chumming up to common folk would help me out later.As I let my eyes roam over the throngs of people crowding around, I saw Lee Jihye glancing my way with a strange expression.\u2018Shall I approach her?\u2019Of course, I had no intention of bringing her in as a party member. However, I decided I was too busy. I still needed to make the list for Cha Hee-ra and find worthy party members of Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party. I also needed to make time for my training as well as administrative work.And my list of priorities didn\u2019t even stop there!\u2018There\u2019s also exploration and potion manufacturing.\u2019The dungeon strategy Kim Hyun-sung was planning and the products to be released in the Holy Continent also needed my attention. With the rate that I was working, I was bound to collapse from overwork sooner or later. At the very least, I needed team members to help me out with my work.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you have anything you need?\u201d\u201cNo thank you, I do not.\u201dI looked around the venue again. This time, I saw familiar faces entering the training center.\u2018Lee Sang-hee\u2026\u2019 Kim Hyunsung was with her.My lips curled in distaste as I also caught Lee Seolho entering, trying his best to remain unnoticed. As long as he was on probation, he wouldn\u2019t dare stir up trouble again. Several administrative team leaders went to greet them, and they bowed in response.This type of greeting was natural. They were, after all, on the same rank. Of course, it was different for normal guild members and instructors. Their greetings fell upon deaf ears.The exception was Lee Sang-hee, who readily greeted each of the guild members face to face. She then approached me afterward.\u201cYou were here first.\u201d\u201cYes, Lee Sang-hee.\u201d\u201cThis is what I said to Mr. Hyunsung, but I will repeat it again. If there are any necessary personnel, I will allow him to recruit them. We will do our best to help you with whatever aspects of the guild you see fit to work on.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI saw Lee Sang-hee smiling at my words.\u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll work hard.\u2019Unlike other people where I had to continually stay on the high alert, it was quite reassuring to be with Lee Sang-hee. It was inappropriate to describe her in this way, seeing as she was only thirty-three, but she felt just like a mother to me.\u201cThank you very much for your hard work.\u201d\u201cNo, it is my pleasure.\u201dAfter exchanging my greetings, I took a seat in a place I found suitable. Trainees wearing nervous expressions came trailing in not long after. They must be thinking about whether they would get an offer too.In their eyes, we were the high rankers they needed to impress.The Blue Guild Master quietly stood on the podium and opened his mouth to speak.\u201cYou have worked hard so far. Everyone who was brought here, even those who did not understand English and had a hard time endured well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn my heart, I would like to educate you a little longer until you can safely settle in the continent, but I would like to express my apology for not being able to do so due to various circumstances. You will soon leave this place and head for the Holy Empire of Benigore. Today, some of you may be contacted by guilds or clans. In addition, there may be people who might come together to form their own clan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOtherwise, there will be some of you non-combat soldiers who will be drafted into the Holy Empire. Each person lives differently, but there is only one thing I can tell you.\u201dThe venue stayed quiet at this.\u201cStay alive.\u201dWhat an ominous phrasing.\u201cOur Blue Guild has a guild house in the western part of Lindel, the free city. We are always waiting for your support.\u201dI knew the hidden meaning beneath his words, and embarrassment flooded through me at the realization.\u2018Not even one\u2026\u2019The Blue Guild had no intention of recruiting any new personnel today. These survivors decided that it was not worth sacrificing the guild\u2019s money and manpower.\u2018So cruel\u2026\u2019Just like modern society, this continent was not free from selfish interests.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, I couldn\u2019t blame them. Considering the time, money, and effort needed to cultivate effective personnel, they could barely recruit more than a few members to improve their guild.If the Blue Guild hadn\u2019t recruited our party, they might have had a chance, but they had already paid a high price to have us. This meant that the others had an almost zero chance of being chosen.\u2018Thank God I haven\u2019t shown any hint of incompetence\u2026\u2019\u201cThen\u2026\u201dUpon this announcement, the trainees hung their heads. However, some of them had chosen to look straight up at us, right into one particular member.\u201cHyunsung!\u201d One of them shouted.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat we\u2026 You were together with us\u2026 Take us in\u2026 Please.\u201d\u2018This is absurd.\u2019Of course, I knew who spoke. It was one of the guys we were with back at the shelter. However, I couldn\u2019t remember his name. He was one of the people Kim Hyunsung readily fed and disliked Jung Hayan with a passion. Not only did he refuse to help one bit, but he had been the closest to Jung Jinho back when he was still alive.I knew the man had a shameless streak, but this was embarrassing. Back in the tutorial, all they did was take up space in the shelter and waste the food we had accumulated. Now he dared to ask Kim Hyunsung to take him in again? Even the instructors seemed embarrassed by him.In a sense, wielding power over a man like this felt great. This was because, in reality, my stats were weaker. However, even if our roles were reversed, I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to speak like that.I didn\u2019t dare open my mouth. This wasn\u2019t my battle to fight; it was Kim Hyunsung\u2019s.\u2018Hyunsung wouldn\u2019t be that soft-hearted\u2026 would he?\u2019Worry gnawed at me.I knew Kim Hyunsung knew his responsibilities as a new member of the Blue Guild. However, no ordinary person would willingly create a shelter for his fellow survivors inside a dungeon.\u201cIn the end\u2026 You have to take responsibility for us\u2026\u201d\u2018What bullshit is this man talking about?\u2019Desperation could make a man stiff sometimes, but would only end up making him look stupid at most.Lee Sang-hee slowly and quietly turned to look at Hyunsung, curiosity plastered onto her expression. She seemed to wonder how he would treat his friendships back in the tutorial dungeon.\u201cYes, together with us\u2026!\u201dThanks to the man responsible for the first outburst, more and more people began to echo his words. I resisted the urge to scoff.\u201cYou won\u2019t throw us away like this, right?\u201d\u201cHyunsung!\u201d\u201cHyunsung, take us with you\u2026\u201dKim Hyunsung slowly stepped towards them.I was anxious, but the moment I saw him biting his lip, I began to relax. I knew this reaction of his. And who could blame him? In a situation like this, even a monk would feel angry.Not surprisingly, Kim Hyunsung lowered his head slightly and began to speak.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s the end of my relationship with you.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly mean\u2026\u201dFor a moment, I thought laughter would come bursting out. This spectacle turned out to be more interesting than I thought!\u201cIt would be better to live your own life in a new environment than to go with me. It was a short time, but I enjoyed it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 Such a thing\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps the city will be a safer place for you.\u201d\u201cHow irresponsible of you\u2026\u201dIrresponsible? He dared to call Kim Hyunsung irresponsible? I shook my head and stepped in.\u201cWe have no obligation to be responsible for you anywhere else.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt will be safe in the city. Although it may be far from comfortable living, at least you will not be threatened with your life.\u201d\u201cN-Nevertheless\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce again, I\u2019m not obligated to take care of you. Neither is Hyunsung.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though I tried my best to explain kindly, the man didn\u2019t seem to understand. Rather, he sported an expression that showcased just how unfair he found this whole situation.\u2018How stupid.\u2019Didn\u2019t they know? If you didn\u2019t sacrifice anything, then you wouldn\u2019t gain anything, either. From my perspective, it would take a long time for this guy to realize this.Sighing, I figured the least I could do was to show some last bit of kindness. I took out some money from my pocket and handed it out to him.\u201cThis is just little, but I hope it helps you out in the long run.\u201d The guy\u2019s expression was hilarious. He still had a betrayed expression, but he was still careful to put the money in his pocket.I resisted the urge to laugh again. That was just a small sum. Nevertheless, there was gratitude in his expression.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI wish the best for you. Please do your best to survive.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dHe still hadn\u2019t realized what I was trying to do.Didn\u2019t he know there was no surefire way of staying protected even in the city? In my opinion, I had just given him an additional reason to get robbed.Lee Ji-Hye stared up at me with a stunned expression. Unlike the man, I knew she knew what I had just done. I was a little puzzled as to why she had not joined in the pleading until I finally realized a probable reason as to why.\u2018Lee Ji-hye\u2026\u2019She must have received an offer from another guild. Knowing that she could be just as resourceful as me, I knew this was a possibility.\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2019It felt like a waste to let her go, but I knew she wasn\u2019t needed in the Guild. However, I also remembered all those times where she had flaunted off her self-confidence back in the dungeon.\u2018I don\u2019t have to be with you.\u2019It felt like she was telling me this. However, after a quick run-through with my ability, I knew she still had less than I did.Still looking at her, I began to speak. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah.\u201dIt was the man I had spoken to, but she knew I was talking to her.Lee Ji-Hye, who deliberately maintained eye contact with me, nodded slightly.I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to apply for Blue, but I\u2019ll see you someday, her facial expression seemed to say.Before I could even retreat, I heard voices once again.\u201cKiyoung is really warm. Of course, the basic living support fund from the guild doesn\u2019t seem that bad, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHm. Still, they lived together in the tutorial dungeon. So, are you going to Lindel right now?\u201d\u201cYes. The cleanup has already been roughly finished. Actually, I want to have a little more time, I have a lot to prepare for.\u201d\u201cAh. The trainees\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be heading with us straight to Free City. Let\u2019s go first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWith this, I felt like my life back in the tutorial dungeon was over. I wasn\u2019t very fond of it, but life in a completely new city seemed just as scary.I also noticed that some of the guild members were sticking around, trying to see just how many gifts I had gotten from Cha Hee-ra.\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cOppa!\u201dOf course, Park Deok-gu and Jung Hayan were also preparing to leave.Jung Hayan, looking a little shy, approached my side, and Park Deokgu began to speak.\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were going to move this early on. What a pity\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cI mean this!\u201dHe pointed towards a small ferry tied to a rope by the shoreline. It wasn\u2019t finished yet, but it looked very promising.Surprisingly, I don\u2019t know if Park Deokgu had agility built-in, but it looked pretty good as it was.\u2018How did he make it so well?\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I had a little more time, I was thinking of boating at a nearby shelter\u2026 It was hard to make, so I decided to take it along with us.\u201d\u201cThere must be a lot of luggage\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with luggage, apparently. In fact, carrying this around will be more or less like exercise for me. If your brother is having a hard time walking, can\u2019t I help you if you ride with Jung Hayan?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that far. You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to ride it as of the moment.\u201cOh, I heard that there is no lake near the Free City\u2026 Pity.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s ride together later\u2026 Oh, Oppa\u2026\u201d\u201cFine. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d Jung Hayan brightened at my words, and I felt relieved upon seeing her looking better than before. I wasn\u2019t sure, but it seemed that she talked to Park Deokgu about me.Worry again began to gnaw at me. It seemed that Park Deokgu also had a firm grip on Jung Hayan\u2019s mental state.\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave soon.\u201d\u201cYes, Hyunsung.\u201dAnd thus, the entire Blue Guild began to walk. It felt like such a hassling physical activity, but it was fun all the same. This was because I spent some time with Park Deokgu, Jung Hayan, and Kim Hyunsung.\u201cSo\u2026 I tried a new magic spell today\u2026\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cI saw it myself and it seemed really great\u2026 Ooh, the lake suddenly cracked when Jung Hayan chanted the spell. It reminded me of one of those stories that the neighborhood Ajimae told me in the past. I forgot it though\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe it was the story of Moses.\u201d\u201cAhhh! Yes, I think it was that man. Hyung is very smart. Anyway\u2026\u201dPark Deokgu continued to ramble on while Kim Hyunsung wore a pleasant expression. Jung Hayan walked while holding my hand tightly. I had quite a hard time focusing, but I made sure to keep up with them, squeezing Hayan\u2019s hand now and then.After walking for quite some time, a tall clock tower began to show up in our line of vision. I glanced to my side and saw Kim Hyunsung with a peculiar expression on his face.It was a start for me, but it was a start for him too. I couldn\u2019t figure out the complicated expression on his face, however.I didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, but I knew he had some worries about what happened in the past and what would happen in the future, with Blue Guild and our party.In the meantime, Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu stared up at the tower with open mouths.\u201cThere\u2026\u201dThis was the place where the people of the Earth resided within the Holy Empire.\u201cLindel\u2026\u201dThis was the Free City of Lindel.\u201cLindel, Park Deokgu is here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOh, my\u2026\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dBoth Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan looked at the Free City of Lindel with awe plastered on their faces. The executive members of Blue Guild couldn\u2019t help but smile at their reactions.As soon as the western gate opened, we walked into a majestic-looking city.The basic architectural style seemed to be based on Western culture, and the whole place buzzed with people I knew all came from Earth. Above all, I noticed that the majority of the people had dark hair.\u201cThe Free City of Lindel is where most of the Koreans are located.\u201d\u201cAlas. After that, I heard that people from other countries are also being summoned.\u201d\u201cYeah. In the case of tutorial dungeons owned by the Holy Empire, the Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese are being summoned. They too are living with their roots in cities within the Holy Empire. You can also see Japanese and Taiwanese people in Lindel. Because they are from the same district, they live in exchange with each other.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dTrue to this fact, I could see Japanese people within the bustling crowds. Even some of the Blue Guild members, I had noted, were Japanese.\u201cThe Republic\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Chinese and Russians are being summoned.\u201dStill, it felt better being summoned here than there. I looked around again and let the bustling scenery please my eyes. There were multiple stalls with their respective owners, and I could even see a party going out to hunt.\u201cI\u2019m looking for a priest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for a priest to go hunting with.\u201d\u201cWho wants this? It\u2019s a rare, one-of-a-kind item!\u201dEven the main square reminded me of reality. The whole city made me feel like I was back on Earth, albeit a different time period.This was probably the reason why Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan kept looking around in awe. There were no high-rise buildings. Instead, the infrastructures had an antique and rustic touch. I could see gorgeously-decorated shops and restaurants with people eating out on the terraces.It didn\u2019t feel like I was in another world. It felt like I had gone overseas. Laughter erupted from the crowds of people, and I caught a hint of a language I did not understand.Of course, the city wasn\u2019t all just riches and glory.\u201cHmm\u2026 There are also slums.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dIn the direction opposite of where we were supposed to go, I caught sight of rundown buildings and people wearing clothing of less quality than the rest. I couldn\u2019t see enough to observe how they lived from this distance, but I could already guess what it was like.Even the gap between the rich and the poor existed here.\u201cThe city has its own welfare policies, but its effects are insignificant, as you can see.\u201d\u201cAh. No wonder.\u201dIt had nothing to do with me, so I shook my head and averted my gaze.As we left the entrance and passed through the plaza, a large building came into view. Lee Sang-hee, who had been looking at Park Deokgu\u2019s awed expression, smiled.\u201cWelcome to the Blue Guild.\u201d\u201cOh! Oh, my!\u201dThe Blue Guild owned a building that was of a larger scale than I was expecting. It did not appear to be a guild that was facing the possibility of ruination. I could think of why, though. They might be more peculiar with their appearances, especially now that their status was sinking.Lee Sang-hee looked over at the rest of us, the smile on her face never leaving.\u201cI will guide you directly.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cThe first floor has a lobby and a shelter. It would be convenient to think of it as a place where you usually receive requests from other guilds or groups. Not only that, it also has a place where you can relax. If you\u2019re going for a simple dinner, you can do it at the tavern on the first floor. Other parties and guild members often gather there, so I hope you use them often.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you. That\u2019s noted.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Oppa, it looks like you can drink alcohol here.\u201d\u201cYeah. You can be confident that it will be much better drinking here than at a random bar. There is a guild restaurant in the basement, so you can use it anytime. Of course, it\u2019s also free.\u201d\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good\u2026\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re the seventh generation, you can also use the second floor.\u201d\u201cThe second floor?\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go up together.\u201dThis felt like we were visiting our new home.We nodded in response to the receptionist\u2019s greeting, standing quietly in the main lobby on the first floor and went up to the second floor. A fairly large space entered our line of sight.\u201cThere are many empty rooms, so you can choose the one you like.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI had expected that the second floor would also be large from what I could see on the first floor, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be of this scale, either. The corridor itself was widely-spaced, and even the rooms did not disappoint. Of course, this was probably because our party was still small. The space seemed too big for a four-person group.The interior of the room, I noted, also looked pretty good.Some beds seemed like they could accommodate two people instead of one. The room seemed a little open as there were only basic furniture installed, but knowing that we could personalize it sooner or later made me feel better.\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d Jung Hayan stared up at me expectantly. Did she expect us to share a room?!\u201cI think there are too many rooms\u2026 I think we can only use three. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect if I and Kim Hyunsung get our own, and if Jung Hayan and Hyung Kiyoung use one together.\u201d\u2018Park Deokgu, you pig!\u2019\u201cAh\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter if you do that, but\u2026\u201d\u201cGreatness\u2026 I think the room next door would suit the two of you better.\u201d\u201cYeah. You can do whatever you are comfortable with doing.\u201dI struggled to contain my emotions. One look at my face made both Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu anxious.Eventually, Jung Hayan took over the room next to me, and Kim Hyunsung and Park Deokgu took the rooms across from us. I was a little worried that Jung Hayan would be sleeping in the room next to mine, but I was careful not to show it. It would be better to check up on her while the rest were busy or asleep, but I hoped she wouldn\u2019t sneak into my room.\u201cThe training room and grounds are behind the building. There is no private practice room, but there is a joint training center that can be used by the seventh generation. If you want to use the studio personally, you can apply at the lobby and use it.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cAnd Mr. Kiyoung\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere is a separate space for you.\u201d\u201cWait, really?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\u201cYeah, okay.\u201dI followed Lee Sanghee with a slightly pleased expression. Park Deokgu, Jung Hayan, and Kim Hyunsung trailed behind us with curious expressions on their faces.Upon entering the room at the end of the second-floor corridor, my jaw unconsciously dropped. This was the first time I was truly in awe after entering Lindel.\u201cYou can work here in the future.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThere was a mountain of books stacked on one side of the room, but what stood out more to me was the multitude of alchemy equipment that filled the space. There were items used back in modern times, such as beakers and flasks and basic alchemy tools that I was already knowledgeable about.On one side, the catalysts and other materials were systematically organized according to their types, and I could see other bits of machinery that I was not yet familiar with.Most of the items presented by Cha Hee-ra were neatly placed in the room. The ancient republic\u2019s drug-making alchemy kit was also properly stacked on one side.This place\u2026\u201cThis is the alchemy workshop you will use.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIn fact, I wanted to increase the scale a little more, but it was the first time I had prepared such a place for non-combatants\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 This is\u2026 This is actually more than enough\u2026\u201d\u201cI was told that the experiment shouldn\u2019t contain other impurities, so I installed artifacts that included disinfection magic throughout the room. It\u2019s at the end of the room and has other artifacts installed to make it easier to ventilate, so you\u2019ll be able to use it comfortably. Defensive magic is also installed by default because there may be unexpected accidents.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what I was feeling. It was my first time having my own space. I never had one back on Earth.\u201cIt feels like a laboratory used by scientists, Hyung.\u201d\u201cIt looks so cool, Oppa!\u201dCha Hee-ra\u2019s gifts were still the most valuable items here. However, the Blue Guild had also done its best to make me feel like I wasn\u2019t being neglected. I suddenly wanted to find out if any alchemists had also managed to start this well.There were hero-grade books, hero-grade alchemy kits, plausible workshops supported by guilds, as well as numerous materials and catalysts given to me not just by one, but by two guilds.I knew that if I couldn\u2019t produce results with such high-level equipment, there would be serious consequences. However, the atmosphere of my workspace made me feel like I could achieve anything. My confidence had been boosted.I knew everyone here considered alchemy as an inefficient skill. The gold required to craft items were not worth the results, and other forms of magic were more desirable to the townsfolk than this. I knew Lee Sang-hee had taken quite the risky jump of investment for me.However, she wouldn\u2019t need to be disappointed. I could make anything with the equipment that was provided for me!\u201cHyung! We\u2019re heading out to eat now.\u201d\u201cYou can all go ahead first, Deokgu.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI want to experiment with a few things. I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Please take Hayan with you.\u201dPark Deokgu showed a slightly regrettable expression. Nevertheless, he nodded. Lee Sang-hee, however, was pleasantly taken aback. From her motherly point of view, her newest child had just shown enthusiasm to work, which pleased her greatly.How could I not? They had arranged everything in such a motivating manner that eating was the least of my priorities now. A day off sounded nice, but my excitement proved too much to resist. There were a lot of things I wanted to try out right away.\u201cNo\u2026 .\u201d\u201cActually, I was thinking of hosting a simple dinner today, but I think I should put it off for next time. All the other parties are present, so these times seem most appropriate. If you need anything, please tell us in the lobby on the 1st floor. We will explain the various facilities in the guild that we could not explain today by then. I will be taking my leave.\u201dThe giddy smile on her face seemed cute.\u201cNo. I need to do some training too. I also need to organize my stuff. What will Jung Hayan do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 Well\u2026 Me, too, I\u2019m also going to practice\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about Hyung Kim Hyunsung?\u201d\u201cI think I would want to look around the city.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI want to take a tour and see everything, from the temples right to the slums.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dI felt a little worried. I would be too weak to defend myself if I dared to venture to the slum area by myself and met with some ruffians. However, I knew Kim Hyunsung was strong enough. I had a lot of trust in both his intellect and strength.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI saw a lot of people in the plaza earlier.\u201d\u201cI think most of them are people who are also looking for party members.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cYeah. We might find our newest member there.\u201dIt was only then that I could roughly understand what he planned to do.\u2018Oh\u2026\u2019Whether he found the person from the temples or the slums, I somehow knew Kim Hyunsung would look for the fifth member of our party.The only question was whether he would be able to find him right away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have succeeded in a new catalyst combination.][Combines Poisonous Grass and Orc Molar. New catalyst combination failed.]Alchemy wasn\u2019t that difficult. Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that the logic found in technology didn\u2019t apply to my craft. The timing of using the synthesis magic circle, the type of the magic circle that would vary by material for each catalyst, the amount of magical power entering the magic circle, and the combination of catalysts and materials\u2026One had to think about every little aspect, understand them, and work on them. This reminded me of doing experiments more than anything else. Along with experiments came the large probability of failure.This was why one had to be prudent when it came to alchemy.Considering the gold spent on one experiment as the materials needed were expensive, various hypotheses had to be made after digging into theories on potion making or catalyst combinations.Based on one\u2019s hypothesis, a virtual experiment would be conducted, and based on the success of the virtual experiment; the scientist would decide when it was the right time to strike.This was basically how alchemists did their alchemy.However, this type of methodology didn\u2019t work on me.Why? Because I had a lot of money to spare.I planned to use them for virtual experiments to immerse myself within countless combinations of catalysts and potions. I would put away crafted theories and hypotheses and would solely focus on the results I would receive on my own logical accord.Of course, I also had to consider that my efficiency would differ from that of a normal alchemist, who would have practiced on a rare catalyst before attempting anything else.[Failed.][Failed.][Failed.]\u2018Damn\u2019I knew I shouldn\u2019t waste time trying to find the reasons for my combinations. Instead, I had to focus on how exactly I could reverse my failures.[Successful.]I didn\u2019t know how much exactly, but I could surmise that about a thousand gold had already been spent just this past week. However, it didn\u2019t mean that it was all spent on nothing.It wasn\u2019t immediately noticeable, but the potion recipes sold in the market by default were already stored in my head, and above all, I was able to increase my intellect and magic stats.In other words, I had bought my increased stats with the gold that I was given.Once again, as I was about to pour gold into my alchemy kit, I heard a voice from outside.\u201cOppa!\u201d\u201cAh. come in. Don\u2019t forget to disinfect with the artifacts\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe door opened to reveal both Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan. I wasn\u2019t surprised at this point. As I saw some of the bags in their hands, I could roughly guess why they came.\u201cWhy are you bringing this in? Other members of the guild have already decided to help me organize my luggage. I also already informed the lobby attendant, so you don\u2019t have to move it yourself next time.\u201d\u201cNo. If we don\u2019t do this, then we won\u2019t have any excuse to see you, Hyung. I don\u2019t know how we can live on the same floor but never see each other. Can I put your luggage down here?\u201d\u201cYes, you can leave it there. Thank you, Deokgu.\u201d\u201cHuh. Well, this is not a big deal for me.\u201d\u201cOh, Oppa. Have you already eaten?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dCringing slightly, I turned to look at the time. I had been so focused on the work that I had lost track of how much time had passed.\u201cMy\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve been a little too busy\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. Then, let\u2019s eat together!\u201d\u201cThat sounds great!\u201dI laughed at the cheerful expressions of my two friends. Pausing briefly, I went to check the luggage. It seemed that all my ordered goods had arrived properly.\u201cBy the way, where did you order all those items?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a catalyst for each alchemy.\u201d\u201cOh. This potion that you made\u2026 Can you save people who are dying with this?\u201d\u201cNo. It only heals basic wounds. Oh, Hayan! Anything over there shouldn\u2019t be touched. Don\u2019t even think about drinking it.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about alchemy, so\u2026 What are you trying to make?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 for now\u2026\u201d\u201cMmhm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to make money.\u201dI resisted the urge to laugh at the confusion my words brought to both their faces. However, what I said was the truth.Money was the most important thing to me. It was only natural to earn as much as I spent. If I wanted to be a good investment, I had to bring lots of money to the table.After all, it wasn\u2019t just Kim Hyunsung who invested in me. There was also Cha Hee-ra.I had already handed her the list, but it was natural that I should still appear useful to her.Of course, what I was making was a secret. Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan didn\u2019t need to know about it,\u201cBy the way, what is Hyunsung doing these days?\u201d\u201cSame. I think I haven\u2019t seen Hyunsung for a long time.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 We train together at the training center, but after the training, he always runs to the slums with some food in hand.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOh, I knew that I was a good man, but is he really that angelic? I don\u2019t know what kind of volunteer work he\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s already been a week since he started\u2026 goodness. Well, it seems both respectful and bad.\u201d\u201cYou mean he plans on doing it every day?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Ah! I think there are times when I also hear tales of new dungeons\u2026 Anyway, Hyunsung\u2019s been walking around the city and seems to be looking for either someone or information. One thing is certain, Kim Hyunsung is really nice.\u201d\u2018Volunteer?\u2019Of course, it suited him.I thought he would bring in new talent, but it seemed that it would take longer than I expected. If we could recruit quickly, there would be no reason to do volunteer work there yet.\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you think of the people there, but sometimes frowning is not the only worry.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019I felt like something was going to go wrong soon enough.\u2018Shall we go even just this once?\u2019It didn\u2019t seem like anything too bad would happen.Anyway, my craft had reached its final stages, and I was really curious about what my fellow party members were doing.Looking up at the faces of Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan, I made up my mind.\u201cI should go once too\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little curious. I wonder how it\u2019s like in the slums.\u201d\u201cWell, go with me, Oppa.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah!\u201dPark Deokgu seemed to want to go, too, but he seemed to be stuck between ruining my time with Jung Hayan or not. I smiled to myself and turned to Jung Hayan.\u201cThen shall we go now? Are you ready, Hayan?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah!\u201dIt felt nice to just up and do whatever we had planned right on the spot. I hadn\u2019t even gotten the chance to do much exploring since I\u2019d been so busy, so this felt nice.Climbing up the carriage that would take us to our destination, I held Jung Hayan\u2019s hand. She positively glowed at this. It felt like we were enjoying a city tour.The scenery we passed by all looked interesting. However, the glorious feeling did not last long.As the carriage wheeled us slowly, the scenery also changed from rich and majestic to shabby and dull. Even the coachman himself could feel the unpleasant change in the atmosphere, and he seemed uncomfortable. The air itself felt humid.\u201cWhy are you going to this place?\u201d The coachman couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cNothing special. In fact, it hasn\u2019t been long since I entered the city. I\u2019m curious about what this place is like.\u201d\u201cAh. It looks like you received an offer from a guild on good terms.\u201d\u201cHaha. It\u2019s embarrassing, but I have.\u201dIt was then that I saw a young man walking by the sidewalk. He moved with his head down, but I could see his anxious expression when he regarded us. Was he afraid we might suddenly hurt him?Were the people who lived here the ones who got rejected from receiving any guild offers? Or were they simply too afraid to join one?The circumstances of each person we passed by were unknown to us, but one thing was for sure \u2013 this was a very unhappy place.\u201cThe atmosphere is a little different from the West Square, Oppa.\u201d\u201cHuh. You feel that too?\u201d Now I felt truly worried. With a carriage to wheel us around, it was almost as if Jung Hayan and I were flaunting our financial difference to the slums.However, I also knew that no one would dare to attack us. Whether it be from their fear or the fact that they knew we were in a guild and therefore were stronger, they all had hesitation on their faces.The threatening situation felt the same as Jung Hayan and I got down from the carriage. I made sure I was protectively around her, as I was worried about what these people could do.I then caught sight of a woman in high-quality clothing with people in filthy clothes crowding around her.[Check player Sun Hee-young\u2019s status window and talent level][Name-Hee-young Sun][Title-Saint of the Forsaken][Age-32][ALIGNMENT-Ideal volunteer][Job-Priest of the Sun-Hero Level][Occupational Effects-Acquisition of basic divine power knowledge][Occupational effect-intermediate knowledge acquisition of divine power][Capacity][Strength -30/Growth limit: Normal or less][Agility-28/Growth limit: Normal or higher][Health -30/Growth limit: Hero or less][Intellect-45/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Durability-32/Growth limit: Rare or less][Luck-45/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Holy-69/Growth limit: Legend or higher][equipment][none][Talent-Saint\u2019s Prayer][General review-It is not an exaggeration to say that she was born to become a priest. The difference between her and Lee Kiyoung, a rotten player, is also very clear. Please do not think about approaching her by any chance. Unlike Lee Kiyoung, she is a clean person.]With this information, I made sure to regard the woman with closer and more focused regard.\u2018Mhh\u2026\u2019My eyes widened. This woman had legendary divine stats.Surprisingly enough, she reminded me of Jung Hayan.I caught sight of Kim Hyunsung amongst the crowd. However, he wasn\u2019t the center of attention. Rather, Sun Hee-young was.I noticed that Sun Hee-young\u2019s outfit and flag were greatly different. I didn\u2019t know what Kim Hyunsung was up to, but one thing was for sure \u2013 she was probably his intended target.Some would wonder why so many people were crowded around her. But to someone with observer skills such as mine, it was obvious why.\u2018Ah, is everyone trying to recruit her?\u2019I felt pretty sure that this was the case.It seems that the talent Kim Hyunsung wanted to attract this time wasn\u2019t someone only he wanted. It was a talent that everyone desired.It was shocking that someone of Sun Hee-young\u2019s stature would be unaffiliated, but she was. From this, I understood why Kim Hyunsung visited this place often, and why there were many members of the clan who seemed to be unrelated to volunteer work.Everyone was busy pretending to be good. The appearance of everyone volunteering collectively to catch her eye was quite a spectacle.\u2018The saint of the outcast?\u2019In my eyes, they looked like pigs who didn\u2019t want work but had to for the sake of self-interests. If there was one thing I didn\u2019t expect, it was that Jung Hayan had the same opinion as me.\u201cThey look like pigs trying to butter up.\u201d\u201cYeah. Hyung! They look\u2026 They look like pigs!\u201dUnlike my quieter tone, Jung Hayan\u2019s louder voice attracted the attention of the people nearby.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI could guess how Jung Hayan and I must have seemed to them.Jung Hayan even seemed to be pampered in skincare products because of the difference in fairness. That was how large the difference was.However, I knew that with me in the mix, it would also seem like we were a young couple who had wandered into the slums because we were curious about it.In the end, though, I knew that whatever prejudice was held against us, the poor would not dare to face off against us entirely. In the Free City of Lindel, wearing neat clothes meant that you were strong, powerful, and had a lot of gold.However, it wasn\u2019t just the poor looking at us with eyes filled with hostility.\u2018This\u2026\u2019It was not good news that Sun Hee-young was among those who looked on with disapproval. This was backed up by the fact that Kim Hyunsung was interested in her. Meanwhile, Jung Hayan had only now realized what mistake she had committed.Sun Hee-Young eventually broke through the crowd and began to stride in front of me. I didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s an appropriate expression, but it felt like a church sister for some reason.With long hair and big eyes, she looked like she had never before endured distress.Sun Hee-young immediately opened her mouth before Jung Hayan could avoid thinking about dealing with this situation while evading her gaze.\u201cApologize to them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cApologize. No one here deserves to be insulted by the likes of you.\u201dThe guild scouts immediately backed up her words. I had to laugh at this absurd situation. Of course, they would take her side.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you think you are, but I think you should apologize.\u201d\u201cI want you to cancel that rant immediately.\u201d\u201cAre you from the Blue Guild?\u201dRed Mercenaries and other large guilds were not among them. Was this really how those of the smaller clans dared to talk to us?It was understandable for someone like Sun Hee-young to address us in this manner, but them? The audacity!\u2018A selfish, ambitious person.\u2019\u2018Computational analyst.\u2019However, I knew that whoever saw this scene would think that we were the biased couple, and they were the bringers of justice. It was a situation where the good and the bad were divided \u2013 and warped.\u2018A mistake?\u2019No.This could never be called a mistake.I didn\u2019t know when that recruitment war had been going on and how much progress Kim Hyunsung had managed to make so far, but there were so many competitors in the first place that there was no way we could make a good recruitment offer.Anyhow, her top priority seemed to be to help the poor. Since she was adamant about it, there seemed no way for her to even think about joining a guild.It was in that instant that a whole new way for her to join us came to mind.I slowly opened my mouth as I pulled the white shoulders, which seemed a little dead to this side.\u201cI will not withdraw the statement.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said I would not withdraw.\u201d\u201cWhy is that\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to say that they are like dog pigs when they do nothing and eat what others give.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2026 You\u2019re from Blue Guild!\u201d\u201cMy affiliation and my words have nothing to do with it. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m from Blue or not. It\u2019s a very, very personal thought that has nothing to do with what my guild stands for.\u201d\u201cThere are things you can and shouldn\u2019t say. You don\u2019t know anything about this place. You don\u2019t deserve to blame them simply because you\u2019re in good clothes and are in a good position!\u201d At this point, I knew Sun Hee-young was gaining momentum from the way she spoke.\u201cThey are not here because everyone is good. They were forced to flock together because of their own circumstances. A small mistake on this continent can cost you your life. There is no way a person who has a special talent like you, who is being contacted by a good guild and is living well, can understand them.\u201dWhen a special talent came out, I had to hold in my laughter. If only she knew.\u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t been here for a while, but at least I\u2019ve lived ten times more intensely than those over there. I can probably say the same for all of you here. The same goes for the guild member you see over there. He must have earned that position not only by risking his life to go hunting, but also by indulging in nasty or hard work. No one wants to die. Likewise, no one wants to work.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThe same is true of me. Overcoming the risk of dying many times, I was able enter Blue. But what about these other people?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. These are\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I know roughly why they are like that.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt is you who made them that way.\u201dSun Hee-young\u2019s expression was dangerous. But if one were to think about this calmly, they would see the logic in my words.\u201cIt is you who have tamed them. You who tamed them, who provided a place to feed and gave them clothes to wear. You made them losers.\u201d\u201cDo you know what you are talking about? You just said that you haven\u2019t been here for a long time yet. Knowing the exact state of the city\u2026 If you say something like this so recklessly\u2026 It\u2019s not because of me that the people here are living like this. It\u2019s because of people like you.\u201dSure, I didn\u2019t know about these people in detail, but I knew just what type of humans they were.\u201cAhhh. Like me? You mean those who choose to work hard to be able to live.\u201d\u201cI am not talking about a person who works hard. When I say people like you, I mean people who ignore and despise those who are below you. You are what makes Lindel rot.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t entirely wrong, either. However, her resolve was na\u00efve.\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything wrong to others. Maybe some humans might feel that way, but I have never done that to take advantage of them. It is not the people here that you need to help. There are adventurers who risk their lives on expeditions, and workers working in difficult places.\u201dOf course, I was not dissatisfied with the idea of volunteer work itself. I respected these people and what they stood for. However, this woman\u2019s method was wrong.\u2018Did she think she was the ideal volunteer?\u2019\u201cI guess I know what you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s obvious that you don\u2019t give them fish, but tell them how to catch fish\u2026 You want to do it. You, at least doing nothing, don\u2019t deserve to say that. You don\u2019t do anything for these people\u2026 Words aren\u2019t convincing.\u201d\u201cI came to act.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dI slightly raised my hand and opened my mouth.\u201cAll these people here, I will hire you.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll hire everyone here. It won\u2019t be dangerous, but it could be hard work. You don\u2019t have to worry too much. Those who can move their bodies can do it. The hourly wage will also be above the basic hourly wage.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to get out of your current state and recover. We cannot provide accommodation, but we do provide lunch.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cIt is up to you to choose whether you will remain here as people who continue to depend on others, or become a true member of a stately society. It\u2019s time to get up on your own, everyone.\u201d I quietly started looking around.The whole place had become silent.However, a question came from someone who dared to ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s the job about?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very simple and not dangerous. We can promise that there will be absolutely no risk. It would be comfortable to think of it as simple labor.\u201d\u201cThe hourly wage\u2026\u201d\u201cI will give you 1 gold. If additional work is incurred, we will be able to pay a separate allowance. It would be better to set the working hours to be 8 hours a day.\u201d At my words, I could hear murmuring all around.\u201cIf you can\u2019t believe it, I\u2019ll take this person here,\u201d I gestured to Sun Hee-young, \u201cas an advisor to our company. This will serve as your assurance.\u201d\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cShall I have you watch what I\u2019m doing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for you. Even those who are not entirely physically able can do it.\u201dIt would have been quite decisive to have Sun Hee-young as an advisor to the company. People slowly started to raise their hands.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 I will do it, too.\u201d\u201cMe, too\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you leave me in charge, I will definitely work hard.\u201dIt felt good to have all these people raise their hands in response to my offer. Sun Hee-young and the other guild scouts continued to look at me with absurd expressions.\u201cI will start work right from tomorrow. It\u2019s a simple task, so you just need to come by 9 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cYes, okay.\u201dAt this point, Sun Hee-young seemed to have been embarrassed by what she had just said. However, her expression also indicated that she didn\u2019t entirely believe me.It didn\u2019t matter whether she believed me or not.As she stroked Jung Hayan\u2019s hair, the latter seeming to be a bit alert to Sun Hee-young\u2019s presence, and turned without regret, she quietly approached this side and very slowly opened her mouth to me.\u201cWell, what should I say\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do, but\u2026 Thank you for work. Nevertheless\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re grateful for. There is no need to be grateful. anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be much difference.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you before.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt is you who tamed them.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter whether those people were tamed by Sun Hee-young or not.What mattered was that she would eventually think she did.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Honestly, I just want to show you that what I said is right.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it at this point \u2013 I laughed.\u2018What money..\u2019The sole fact that I hired all these people would prove to be quite problematic for me financially. The catalyst I was gaining from my alchemy right now was inadequate for a continuous payroll. I wasn\u2019t in a problematic situation as of the moment, but I knew I could have used the money for better things.However, I also found this situation an ideal event to conduct clinical trials very cheaply, and I knew the smug feeling from proving Sun Hee-young wrong would be worth the money. After all, business benefits could be found in many aspects.\u2018Why did I have to go this far to break her line of thinking? One may ask. That was because this was my plan to recruit her into my party.\u2019\u2018I have been in this place for three years. It was two years ago that I began to be called the Saint of the Forsaken. I started as a member of the temple, not a clan or guild, and after leaving the temple, I continued to devote myself to volunteer activities. I have been rejecting offers from large guilds or small and medium-sized clans for two years.\u2019This was her brilliant backstory.Despite being able to ride the elite course like me, she had still chosen the path to the temple. Because of her upbringing, I knew why she had chosen to live a life like this. The people who considered themselves saints of the forsaken made it their ultimate mission to relieve the poor from their sufferings.Proof of this manifested itself in Sun Hee-young, for she had refused any contracts or treaties with any guilds or clans for two years. I couldn\u2019t even imagine the number of offers she must have received in her lifetime.Of course, some of the desperate offers may have included full-scale relief for the poor. Nevertheless, she had refused even those, and the reason was quite obvious.It was because she thought she had to do it herself.Honestly, I didn\u2019t know why she had such an attachment to these people when she barely even knew them, but I couldn\u2019t find it in me to care about that as of the moment. The first task was to separate her from the poor.Looking ahead, I could see people who were working quite hard on their tasks. Some also looked quite motivated.I thought maybe my plan would get ruined, but I didn\u2019t feel worried at the moment.\u201cThere are people in the slums who have yet to find work\u2026 Are you not going to hire them?\u201d\u201cJust wait. I will go when the right time comes.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything else to say? This is just a simple labor of moving rocks. The weather will be a little hot because of the sunlight, but it will be a valuable drop of sweat for them after a long time. Seeing those who feel the true value of labor, I feel like I want to join them in moving rocks.\u201d\u201cSounds like a taunt.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken.\u201dOf course, it didn\u2019t look like she took my side very well. If I were in her position, I wouldn\u2019t like myself either. I was a man that defied her values.This, of course, turned the tides in my favor. My way was effective because it was an entirely different approach from how most people would usually approach Sun Hee-young.\u201cWhat on earth do you mean that it is I who have tamed them?\u201d\u201cTake it literally. These people are all capable of working, they just don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see that they are working right now?\u201d\u201cI can see what\u2019s happening in front of me quite well. The question is\u2026 can you?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the Free City of Lindel, these kinds of jobs are widespread.\u201d\u2018Although\u2026yes, it\u2019s a bit dangerous.\u2019\u201cOf course, it\u2019s undeniable that working with me is beneficial, but\u2026 There are many similar things to this kind of work. The eastern region has undergone redevelopment, and the Red Mercenary Guild is said to be seeking handymen needed to make the tower this time. Not only that\u2026 Did you know that there is currently a large-scale construction going on near the tutorial? Maybe even these people know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI gave them the motivation to start working today. They wanted to prove they weren\u2019t lazy pigs. You may want to back off a little bit for their true colors to shine.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cThey were agitated. They probably didn\u2019t realize this since I riled them up in a positive manner instead of a negative one. Well, I still stick to what I\u2019ve said.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cHuman nature doesn\u2019t change so easily. They may be motivated right now, as what you and I both can see. But this won\u2019t even last a month. These people will eventually miss hanging around in the slums instead of working hard under the sun. They\u2019ll miss the free relief goods they get instead of working for their keep. No one wants to experience the pain and exhaustion of always working.\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but you\u2019re wrong. People can change if they want to.\u201d\u201cThen what about my reasoning that the Saint of the Forsaken has changed them? In the end, they are just dogs that feed on ordinary people.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u2018Did I go too far?\u2019I could see Sun Hee-young trembling on the spot, and quite frankly, I could feel a tremor of fear running down my spine. Her big eyes had begun to fill with tears.I thought about whether I was pushing a girl who didn\u2019t know anything, but I also thought this kind of stimulation was necessary. Even though she believed I was wrong, I successfully planted seeds of doubt in her mind.\u2018What if that man\u2019s words are true?\u2019Even if such small doubts arose, a woman who served others and sought value would be ruined. Our dear little saint right here looked a little weak.\u201cIt won\u2019t work the way you think. It is arrogance and self-righteousness that urge these people to do their job. The world never works the way you wish for it to be.\u201d\u201cI do not know about that.\u201d\u201cJust wait. They will show you their true colors and you\u2019ll have a reason to think differently afterwards.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason to think like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a part that can be seen so obviously when you have a realistic point of view.\u201dAt her silence, I began to speak again.\u201c\u2026Did you ever hear of the underdog effect?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is a word that refers to the basic error of distinguishing a good person from an evil person by the difference in strength.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn short, being poor doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019re a good person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s just a simple and kind person in front of you. Playing victim is obviously the best approach when it comes to softhearted and stronger individuals. But they are also perpetrators from somewhere. The slums are not a heaven where the angels live. It is still part of the society we live in. A society where all kinds of dirty and unbelievable things are common.\u201d\u201cIf societies are like what you think\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rotten. Where humans are, there is always conflict. If you can\u2019t believe it, I\u2019d recommend a little experiment.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou try to be the poor yourself. Not from the position of a saint who saves them, but to live in the same position as the poor. Then there will be something to feel. Why don\u2019t you try it for one week? No, just one day will be enough.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about. You\u2019re worried about people who might be hungry without you. But it\u2019s okay to disappear for a day or so. Don\u2019t you have wonderful friends who are following you in this kind of service?\u201d\u2018Of course, your friends are the type of people who only go because of you.\u2019At her hesitation, I raised an eyebrow challengingly and smirked. \u201cOr are you just not confident?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026 I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll do the preparations here.\u201d\u201cYou really\u2026 You are a disgusting person.\u201d\u201cWhat was that? Can\u2019t you respond more confidently?\u201d\u201cWhether or not I respond with confidence does not matter. You are treating them like zoo animals!\u201d\u201cYou will respond. You won\u2019t respond. Both do matter. You think this is an opportunity to be able to help the less able. You are correct.\u201d\u201cYou will regret this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 It will be you, not me, who will end up regretting.\u201dSeeing Sun Hee-young biting her lips in doubt and turning away was quite the spectacle.\u2018I\u2019m so naive\u2026\u2019 I could hear her cognitive functions whirling.Certainly, maintaining that kind of na\u00efvet\u00e9 in such a place was a blessing, especially for someone who came from Earth.Looking back at the scene before me, I could still see the people trying their best to work hard, sweat pouring down their faces as they moved the stones.\u201cHey there!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I can transfer this\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will have enough strength if everyone gathers together.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHey, Kim! Come on, quickly!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just finish this and go!\u201dAs soon as Sun Hee-young moved away, Jung Hayan worriedly rushed to my side. Her quick hug made me feel a little better.Judging by the notebook she was holding in one hand, she seemed to have worked hard on the work entrusted to her.\u201cOppa.\u201d\u201cAre you doing well?\u201d\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d\u201cShall we listen to what you have to say?\u201d\u201cYeah! So, um\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cTest 13 seems to be a little helpless. I think he got angry more than a couple of times\u2026 Numbers 7 and 8 seemed to be working hard.\u201d\u201cI heard a loud noise from the inside a little earlier.\u201d\u201cThat was number 56 and number 75. There seemed to be something that happened between them while working. I didn\u2019t pay enough attention, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, just knowing that there is a problem is enough. How about number 38?\u201d\u201cAh. Number 38 was fluctuating. He didn\u2019t seem motivated enough to continue on. He also said he would quit soon. Numbers 93 and 95 agreed with the words of number 38.\u201d\u201cAhhh. I like that. That\u2019s a good outcome.\u201d\u201cMmhm, yeah.\u201d\u201cI had a hard time, Hayan, but thanks to you, my work became easier.\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s fine, Oppa.\u201d\u201cAnd just in case\u2026 Is there a type of magic that can change one\u2019s appearance?\u201d\u201cYes, there is.\u201d\u201cIt will be enough to change the facial structure slightly with magic. Will it be difficult to do?\u201d\u201cAh! I think that\u2019s possible to do. But why?\u201d\u201cI think I should show a princess who doesn\u2019t know the world about how dirty people live.\u201dJung Hayan began to smile at my words. \u201cI see what you mean.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wasn\u2019t angry. I just found it hard to understand.\u2018I\u2019m not wrong.\u2019Of course\u2026 it was natural to want to help people.\u2018He doesn\u2019t know anything.\u2019No one lived in the slums because they wanted or chose it. Every one of these people had their own sad stories to tell.Some have not been contacted by guilds or clans, while others had become disabled from hunting in the past. Some were driven to the streets because of sick family members, while others were simply unable to find work.In other words, society has led them to this place.Lindel, the Holy Empire\u2026 No, this entire continent itself is wrong.This was a society that did not know how to care for the weak. It was a selfish community. Although they promised welfare benefits to most of its citizens, the poor did not receive any.On this continent, where people only worked for their interests, someone had to step forward.\u201cIt will be dangerous.\u201d\u201cNo, it won\u2019t be dangerous.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026As a priest, you have the freedom to choose how you think. However, it would be good to have a minimum of safety devices. I don\u2019t know when and how something will happen.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cRather, I want to ask why you don\u2019t think the same.\u201d\u201cThe reason you don\u2019t understand me is because you\u2019re not looking at them properly.\u201d\u201cMy answer is the same. Rather, it is you who is not looking at them properly. There are not just those who are poor and need help. Who needs help are those who try to stand up, not those lying down.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that kind of talk anymore.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, fine. I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\u201cThen, I will just leave as you said. I want you to keep what you promised.\u201d\u201cYeah. Whether or not. By all means, goodbye.\u201dIt was not even worth answering him. Even if I were to accept his offer and act as one of the slums\u2019 people, nothing would change.I didn\u2019t even have to respond to such a non-playful offer. Nevertheless, I had one reason as to why I was willing to enter the slums alone.\u2018I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u2019I wanted to prove to that man that I wasn\u2019t wrong. There was certainly a difference between simply watching from a distance and breathing and living with them.There was an old couple who had given me thanks while weeping for help, and there was a little child who plucked me some flowers in return for my help.I\u2019d seen so many things that this man hadn\u2019t for nearly two years. The people and I had spent a long time communicating and talking together.As I continued to step forward, I could slowly feel the atmosphere getting darker.What was wrong? I always walked down these streets and was very familiar with it, but I could feel that something had changed.It was the time of the day to eat, yet no one openly loitered around the streets. This place is always the same.I could feel the familiar, unpleasant smell of the slums fill my nostrils, but I had long since adapted to it, so it did not bother me anymore. As I continued walking around, the helpless people I had always helped came into view. Some of them were chatting, and the rest were just looking around the area.The people taking care of their children caught my eye, as well as the lovers walking with arms folded together.The man was at least right in this aspect. This was also a place where people lived, albeit with no convenient facilities, no decent restaurants, and no decent homes.\u2018Good.\u2019As I stepped in a little further, a crowd of people caught my eye.\u2018This is the plaza\u2026\u2019It cannot be deemed as a decent square. It was an empty field with nothing, and it was just called a plaza because it was a space where people naturally gathered together. In other words, it is a symbolic space that the poor called their shelter.As I quietly settled on one side, a familiar face caught my eyes.This was one of the men that that man had hired.I didn\u2019t know why he was here, who should be at work, but perhaps something had happened?When I was looking around so quietly, a loud voice began to come into my ears.\u201cKim! Why didn\u2019t you go out today?\u201d\u201cYeah, why didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cBecause that guy had hired me\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhh. I see.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was very difficult. It\u2019s just moving rocks, but somehow I feel like it doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you say you would start your life anew now?\u201d\u201cYes, I did say that, but\u2026 I really didn\u2019t like working there. I thought about it, and I felt no difference whether I worked there or ate her food here.\u201d\u201cIf someone she knows hears you\u2026 Be careful, man.\u201d\u201cListen. I don\u2019t think I will come today\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m freaking out about working for nothing.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see the priest today. Is she still coming?\u201d\u201cDoes it make sense that the priest would be sick?\u201d\u201cIt could be that day. No matter how much of a priest she is, she\u2019s still female. She\u2019s probably on her natural monthly cycle or something.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019Blinking, I strained my ears to make sure I was hearing them. I could hardly comprehend the words they so casually put out.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019\u201cWell, that\u2019s shit\u2026 I\u2019ll just go hungry and die\u2026 I\u2019m also feeling very sleepy\u2026\u201d\u201cWell then, that\u2019s an expression I haven\u2019t heard in a while.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAfter roughly covering his face with one hand, the man who should have gone off to work left the square. I didn\u2019t know why they went away.I just felt like I shouldn\u2019t stay there.To be precise, it was because I didn\u2019t want to hear their conversation anymore, but I couldn\u2019t afford to think about all these things at once.\u2018You tamed them.\u2019\u2026The man\u2019s voice came into my head.As if his words had conjured a magical spell, I began to notice things I had not noticed before as I continued walking deeper into the slums,\u201cI\u2019ll make it cheap for you.\u201d\u201cThe smell of money is amazing.\u201dLovers walking while holding hands no longer looked like lovers. With horror, I realized that this was a middle-aged man and a prostitute.\u201cIs this just this?\u201d\u201cYeah, sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cThe little ones are missing\u2026 .\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dIt turned out that the man who I thought had been looking after the children were not looking after them at all.The bums on the street were drowning themselves with cheap rum, and the voices I heard were either criticizing something or someone. Some men also harassed women.\u201cHey!\u201dA plethora of swear words also rung out from every corner of the street.\u2018It sounds so natural for them to utter such words\u2026\u2019It was the same scenario everywhere I went. People who I thought I knew turned out to have completely different characters and personalities.However, as this thought suddenly came, my nerves began to pull at me.\u2018What if the man is right?\u2019\u2018What if I am wrong?\u2019\u2018What if what I saw was just part of the slums and what he saw was everything?\u2019\u2018Was it me who had failed to see everything clearly right from the start?\u2019 My thoughts were all over the place.I hadn\u2019t seen these kinds of things before. When I was in a position to help these people, I didn\u2019t notice them at all.\u2018They would be perpetrators somewhere.\u2019The man was right.Even those who I thought were weak turned out to be harassers to others.Until now, I had been mad at myself because I had always been above them.The reason I hadn\u2019t been a victim of that sort of treatment until now was that a group of strong people surrounded me in good clothes.However, this was a different situation. I had taken on the form of somebody else. At that moment, I realized just why that man said that this endeavor might be dangerous.\u2018I have to go.\u2019With this thought in mind, I made to turn around, but a sinister voice behind me made me freeze.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to get stabbed, don\u2019t move.\u201dChills went down my spine. What made me feel more anxious was the presence of the blade that I felt behind my back.\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\u201cFuck you.\u201dAt this, I fell silent.\u201cDid you think you wouldn\u2019t know you were a girl if you were tightly wrapped in a hood like that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 What do you plan on doing?\u201d\u201cAre you asking because you really don\u2019t know? I doubt that.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 Don\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cDo you know how dangerous it is to wander alone on a night like this?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t kill you, rest assured. I have other plans for you\u2026\u201dI could roughly understand what was going on, even as the cool blade was ominously aimed at my back. I knew I could have easily said a spell to save myself, but my mouth refused to utter the words. It was a very unexpected situation, and my legs trembled in the first situation.When I did not move for some time, the man behind me struck me hard.\u201cAh!\u201dI was flung sideways from the exerted force, and I couldn\u2019t help but gasp.Before I could even attempt to get up, I felt a strong hand holding my hair. Although I was desperately rolling my eyes for help, the men who came into view were looking at me as if they found this entire spectacle fun.\u201cPlease\u2026 help\u2026\u201dI could see faces I knew. I had helped some of these men with relief goods. These were the people I had talked with and knew.Of course, I thought they would help me. Surely they knew how wrong this was.However, none of them were reaching out to help. They were avoiding my gaze while trying not to laugh, all the while pointing fingers at me. All the reactions they showed were the same.\u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please save me\u2026\u201dA fist then hit my abdomen. I couldn\u2019t even scream from the pain because of the immense fear I was feeling. When I tried to utter a divine spell, a large fist shook threateningly in front of me.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do this. Someone, please help. please\u2026 Help.\u201d\u201cThe guys here all want the same as me, and you ask them for help? Are you new here?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 No.\u201d\u201cDid you come in here alone, not knowing how dangerous it is? How clueless are you?\u201dFrom what he said, I knew he was not referring to the entire slums. I realized that the man was simply talking about the western side of the area.I couldn\u2019t understand why this area was a place that shouldn\u2019t be entered. It was a place where I always hung around during my volunteer days.Before I even organized my thoughts, a large face hung right in front of me.\u201cI think I can sell you at a good price\u2026\u201dThe man who had spoken sported a visibly noticeable burn on his face. It looked like it had not gotten proper medication.The odor from his mouth and body made me feel nauseated.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cShe seems disgusted by you.\u201d\u201cAh! N-No\u2026\u201dOnce again, my head spun. The pain began to blossom on the left side of my cheek.\u201cAre you disgusted by me?!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cAnswer me! Am I disgusting?!\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 Please save me! I\u2019m going to die here\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will look more disgusting than me in the future, rest assured. Don\u2019t have such a weak stomach now. It\u2019ll be nice to have fun with you first before we sell you off.\u201d\u2018Help me.\u2019\u201cPlease help\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss, I don\u2019t know what you keep asking for help\u2026 Who do you think can help you here? If you need help, you should go to the nearby clan vigilante and ask for help. No one among us here will help you\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a stupid bitch. Tsk.\u201d\u201cHelp me\u2026\u201dThe people who had crowded around us all sported intrigued expressions. No one looked like they were planning to help me out.\u2018It will be dangerous.\u2019\u201cNo\u2026 No\u2026\u201d\u2018They would be perpetrators somewhere.\u2019\u201cHelp me. Someone, please\u2026\u201d\u2018People who need help are those who try to stand up, not those lying down.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m sorry. please\u2026 Help me.\u201d\u2018You are the one who made them lazy pigs.\u2019\u201cSave me. I\u2019m sorry! Please! Ah! Stop! Stop!\u201d\u201cSo what did I say, Priest? Just because someone is poor, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re good.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs I turned my head, I saw the face I hated the most.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSo what did I say, Priest?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cNot all the poor are good.\u201dAs I approached her, I could see just how badly she had been roughed up.Of course, I knew what had happened. After all, I had been watching this young woman\u2019s adventure from start to finish.She currently wore an expression filled with tears and a runny nose. Her entire demeanor screamed out that she felt an immense type of fear. I made sure to keep my expression sympathetic, though, of course, I did not feel much sympathy for her. At this point, I probably looked like help sent from heaven.What had been the most interesting thing to me was how she had turned a complete 180 from the Sun Hee-young that I had just seen this morning. One side of my lip curled up.\u2018As expected, humans are funny.\u2019Everything had turned out to be the opposite. The poor people she had so readily defended ended up being the perpetrators in this scheme, and the man she despised the most ended up being her savior.Because of this, I found it hard trying to reel in my laughter.In contrast to the neat and haughty Sun Hee-young that I had just seen this morning, the girl in front of me sported a bruised, swollen face and torn-up rags for clothes. I knew that if I hadn\u2019t shown up any sooner, she would have been in big trouble.\u201cAlas\u2026\u201dThe tears that I had intentionally accumulated in my eyes fell at that moment.I could feel the man who was pulling Sun Hee-young\u2019s hair and the bums who seemed to be waiting for their turn looking at me.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cThat you don\u2019t need to know, scum.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to play cocky with me, bastard. I\u2019m asking who you are.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t have the confidence to go ahead and kill everyone here. I was still admittedly a weak wizard, and there were a lot of them surrounding me.I didn\u2019t believe that Jung Hayan would currently handle the lot of them at this moment, even though she was already preparing spells behind me. I had to stall for time.However, the fact that we were against these types of people made me feel confident about myself. These were the types who acted weak against the strong and strong in front of the weak.Sure enough, I could see cautious expressions spreading from the entire crowd. My and Jung Hayan\u2019s anonymity was enough of a reason to make them anxious.\u201cW-Where are you from\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dJung Hayan began to utter the spell she had memorized the moment I looked behind me. Even before her voice burst, the new magical power that encroached everywhere began to trap them.Screams popped up from place to place in an impossible situation.Sun Hee-young, who was trembling with her round eyes open, started to run towards us. She had realized that I was the only one who could save her from her current predicament. Meanwhile, screams erupted from the hordes of people who did not know what was happening.Everyone here was aware that we were the ones responsible for the explosion, and she knew going towards us was where she would be protected.\u201cI told you it was going to be dangerous, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you. Thank you for your help.\u201d\u201cYou can relax now, priest. You\u2019re safe.\u201d As I spoke, I looked over at the man who had taken ahold of her first. His genitals were exposed for the whole world to see.\u201cHow was going around the slums on your own? I see you\u2019ve done a little sightseeing.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you for your help. Quick, let\u2019s go.\u2026 Please\u2026 Let\u2019s get out\u2026\u201dFrom what I could see, Sun Hee-young currently did not have the mental capability to speak properly. Her instincts told her to get out of the area. I had no idea how this woman managed to survive the tutorial dungeon if she had gotten traumatized just from this situation.However, I wanted to have a serious conversation with her first. This was the whole reason why I even proposed her choice of action, after all. Seeing her traumatized expression made me feel like I stepped on a pile of shit.\u201cLet this go.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a woman who doesn\u2019t want the world to know of this. Please\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cNow that you\u2019ve disguised yourself as someone poor, you\u2019ve seen how they truly are, right?\u201d\u201cYou are right. You were right. Everything you said is correct.\u201dHowever, I knew she wasn\u2019t thinking properly. All I could see on her face was an expression of urgency. It was not a mask of regret for her line of thinking, but a desperate cry to escape this situation.\u201cHayan, release the magic.\u201d\u201cOkay, Oppa.\u201d\u201cDo not do it! Please don\u2019t!\u201dOf course, the magic I had asked Hayan to release was not the trapping magic she had laid upon the men, but the psychedelic magic that she had cast on Sun Hee-young. It was to reveal her true facial features.As Jung Hayan slowly undid the magic, Sun Hee-young\u2019s features slowly shifted into view.\u201cLook straight over there.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201dThe faces of the trash who had attempted to harass our precious priest began to turn blue. They had just now realized who they had just manhandled. Though there were looks of regret on their faces, the fact that they had touched the wrong person remained blatantly obvious,They had just harassed a girl every clan wanted to have.Seeing them shit their pants and turning pale, I couldn\u2019t resist myself from laughing.\u201cDo you guys still want to live?\u201dSince I saw people nodding their heads, I continued speaking.\u201cThis woman\u2026 Are you willing to kill her?\u201dThe man sported a fearful expression that signaled he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, so I delved into a deeper explanation.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to actually let you kill her. I\u2019m just trying to make this woman realize your true personalities. She\u2019s taken care of you for so long, after all. What is it that she\u2019s been called? The Saint of the Forsaken\u2026?\u201dThe man nodded, a little stunned.\u201cWhy\u2026 Why are you saying this?\u201d Sun Hee-young stammered.\u201cPersonally, I feel bad for this woman. She had given her entire time trying to help people like you, only for you to personally prove her wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you refuse to admit this, you die.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, we\u2019d be willing to.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dSun Hee-young was now standing with a poker-faced expression.\u201cW-What\u2026 Why\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and listen to what I tell you, you bastards. Nothing will change anyway.\u201d\u201cCan I really do whatever I want to do\u2026?\u201dI nodded my head and continued. \u201cSure. It doesn\u2019t matter if you finish what you were trying to do.\u201d\u201cIs this true?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m lucky or not, but first of all, thank you for saving me.\u201d Sun Hee-young interjected, who looked as if she felt a mix of relief, sadness, and fear.\u201cSir\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up, you bastard. Anyway, you\u2019re all the same. Just a bunch of lazy pigs who take great pleasure in tormenting others. Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourselves?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that in\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it in what? You all thought our lovely priest had gotten sick, so you all decided to skip work and fool around at night.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Even in this situation, the man sporting the burn marks had the cockiness to still speak so confidently. Just by looking at his appearance, I knew he was a motherfucker by birth.Sun Hee-young was no longer shaking in fear at this point. Rather, she now sported a defeated expression. I did not know what she was feeling right now, but she was probably feeling more embarrassed than afraid.I\u2019m not sure how it feels to be denied by a purpose that I\u2019d dedicated my whole life to, but it probably feels the same as losing one\u2019s identity.Finally, the expected result came.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dA sorrowful cry burst out from the silence.\u201cFuhhhhh.\u201dI stepped towards them slowly. It was no wonder that those who tried to surround Sun Hee-young earlier slowly stepped back as I approached them.As I slowly returned my gaze to Sun Hee-young, I could see her looking at me with an expression that was difficult to describe.\u201cUgh\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u201cNow, can we have a proper conversation?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cI was only helping you realize the reality of this place. So, was I right all along?\u201d\u201cYou were right. Ugh, you were right, and I was wrong. I\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are not wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cTake it literally, Sun Hee-young. You are not wrong. You are simply being noble. Being able to sacrifice for others is something ordinary people cannot do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI respect you. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get up every day and serve these people. You did it without expecting something in return. Despite being able to receive offers from guilds or clans, you did not focus on the rewards and stuck to your own values.\u201dWhile I spoke, the other men sported confused looks. She didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201cYou are in a lower position than others. Excuse me, but I have watched where you are. If you think about your social position, it\u2019s definitely not a suitable place. You abandoned everything. Literally everything. Other people also moved. You made other clans and guilds interested in the poor. Yes. You are noble.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t make them lazy pigs. What I said before was out of jealousy at you for having something I didn\u2019t have. Your sublime, beautiful, and sincere character is something I don\u2019t possess. It is me who is twisted.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI could see her clenching her fists.I didn\u2019t know if she felt comforted or still in tears over her current situation, but she could at least recognize that her thinking has changed.\u201cYou were never wrong.\u201d\u201cYes, I guess\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are sublime.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are a person to be respected.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThe one who is wrong here is\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNow, you know how worthless it is to sacrifice for pigs who do not even know how to appreciate you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe ones who betray you without knowing what they have received are really wrong. These people corrupt Lindel, the Holy Empire, and even society. Even if the nobles continue to contribute to society, it does not improve because these types of people remain. Yes. It\u2019s all because of them that the slums don\u2019t improve, that you get useless misunderstandings, that you don\u2019t get what your noble light hopes for.\u201d\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d\u201cI do not condemn those who try to stand up, but those who don\u2019t even think about standing up. They make this place rot.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cOkay, then\u2026\u201dSun Hee-young continued to look up at me in silence.\u201cLet\u2019s begin service in the true sense, Priest.\u201dThere was no suitable answer to the bullshit I had just spouted.However\u2026Sun Hee-young slowly straightened and took the dagger that I was handing out to her.\u201cLet\u2019s make Lindel beautiful together.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLet\u2019s make Lindel beautiful together.\u201dAn indecipherable expression formed on Sun Hee-young\u2019s face at my words, and a moment of what seemed like clarity passing through her eyes. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t expecting her to shift this easily. She looked as if she\u2019d been given a new burst of motivation.She had been exposed to a scenario that was both frightening and life-threatening, so in a way, I also found this sudden turn understandable. However, I had been expecting her to be all frightened and shaky. It seemed that she had a different response in mind.\u2018She\u2019s trembling\u2026 Poor thing.\u2019Of course, as I assessed her, Sun Hee-young was indeed still shaking and trembling from what she had just experienced. I knew somehow it would have been impossible to get her to admit defeat in her normal state of thinking. Her frightened disposition had worked in my favor.\u2018Good.\u2019Something new bloomed in Sun Hee-young\u2019s expression then \u2013 a sense of purpose. From beneath the shaking exterior was a feeling of determination blossoming within her eyes.She had started walking slowly, a dagger expertly held in one hand. In a way, this was both a beautiful and disturbing scene, almost like a religious ritual. What was even more disturbing about it was the fact that it looked as natural as praying for her.Inwardly, I knew she did not blame these people outright for what they did.\u2018However\u2026\u2019\u201cPriest\u2026 We\u2026 We were wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what has come over me\u2026 Please forgive us\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease spare me, Priest\u2026 I beg you\u2026\u201d\u201cY-You said you\u2019d save us\u2026\u201d\u201cForgive us just this once, please?\u201dAt this point, the perpetrators, now at our mercy, had started begging Sun Hee-young to let them go. I looked over at them, smiling to myself. This was indeed an entertaining sight.Sun Hee-young paused and looked towards us, specifically at Jung Hayan, responsible for the magic trap.\u201cReally\u2026 Can I do it?\u201dShe sounded like she was waiting for confirmation. Of course, I had no intention of letting her stop.\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t need to worry. Think of it as the same thing you\u2019ve been doing so far. It is definitely helping others. If there is trash, it is only correct to remove it.\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201dSun Hee-young was indeed a talent that should join the party.Smiling brightly, she approached the men and raised the dagger high in the air. The screams erupted once more.The way she handled the dagger looked beautiful to me for some reason, not at all grotesque.\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cPriest! Please save-\u201d\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dAny passerby that happened to stumble upon this scene would feel highly disturbed, if not frightened. The grotesque sounds of blood splattering on concrete, mixed with the screams of those affected, rung in the ominous air.No one responded to the voices asking for help. Of course, that may well be because of Jung Hayan\u2019s sealing magic masking us, but I was sure that even if we hadn\u2019t gone through the hassle of doing so, no one would have come to their aid.As they had said themselves, asking for help here was stupid. Everyone in the slums was too busy with their own lives.When I remembered the Sun Hee-young from this morning, the one who would have scoffed at my words and would\u2019ve helped the poor without batting an eyelash, I supposed the Sun Hee-young now was not that different in a sense. She still did not blame them \u2013 she just genuinely believed she could help them in a new manner.\u201cPriest! Priest! Please\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bitch! Are you even human?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 Please!\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201dAs Sun Hee-young moved, I couldn\u2019t help but observe her. I had a feeling this woman was already abnormal since the start. There was no other way to explain her level of altruism.Sun Hee-young remained silent during the whole ordeal. After a while, the screaming gradually subsided. She was still wearing that strange, creepy smile as she panted slightly.\u201cSo, how did it feel?\u201dAlthough her face was still swollen and bleeding from what she had suffered earlier, she did not seem to mind.\u201cThat felt\u2026 rather rewarding,\u201d she responded in a creepy voice. Nevertheless, there was a quality to her that seemed beautiful to me in its entirety. Her state of mind might seem worrying, but I knew she would be fine. I had just helped her out by broadening her perspective, after all.\u2018My plan is working.\u2019\u201cShall we go, then?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2026?\u201dI did not offer her a direct proposal. Instead, I reached out and took her hand in mine as a response. Jung Hayan shifted uncomfortably behind me, but I knew that this shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201cThis new meaning of service is not something you can do alone. And unlike before, you need to be a little more discreet. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cTogether\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. Together. There will be many problems when it comes to realizing your values. It\u2019s something the average person won\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to prove you weren\u2019t wrong.\u201d\u201cYes, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cFirst of all\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can do it myself.\u201d Sun Hee-young quietly began to memorize the spell. It was daunting as to how quickly she was able to heal herself.Because of the ring that Jung Hayan wore, I had already experienced the effects myself once before, but Sun Hee-young\u2019s magic capabilities made recovery more effective from its looks.\u2018She\u2019s good.\u2019I now understood just why priests were considered very precious. It was difficult to find a person who would fit the priest\u2019s aptitude, and it was also difficult for them to stay a priest. This was why it felt good thinking about having such a powerful ally by my side.All that remained was to bring Sun Hee-young back to the guild.Jung Hayan stuck up to me closely, and I knew she was worried about the gentle kindness that I had dared show Sun Hee-young. At this, the woman in question leaned away but began to speak to her in turn.I let them host a little conversation. It felt a little ironic to have a daily conversation if one were to think about what had just happened a few minutes ago, but seeing Jung Hayan respond to Sun Hee-young\u2019s words eased what little anxiety I had. The two didn\u2019t seem to feel hostility towards each other.It was then that I saw a familiar figure making its way towards us.\u201cHyunsung?\u201d\u201cOh, if it isn\u2019t Kiyoung. It\u2019s a coincidence to meet you here. I thought you were in the lab\u2026 Did you come out with Jung Hayan?\u201d\u201cAh. The fact is\u2026\u201dWhen Kim Hyunsung caught sight of Sun Hee-young, the priest smiled brightly and spoke.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Sun Hee-young, here for a little volunteer activity\u2026 .\u201d\u201cAh. It\u2019s also nice to meet you. I am Kim Hyunsung.\u201dAt their exchange, I felt a little confused. Wasn\u2019t Kim Hyunsung here for Sun Hee-young?Then I saw a little kid peeking out from behind Kim Hyunsung. It was a little difficult to properly distinguish whether the child who had not yet taken off her oversized tee was a man or a woman.There was an unknown poison in the kid\u2019s eyes, and her face covered in broth seemed to explain that she had come from the slum area.\u2018Perhaps\u2026\u2019I quickly activated my ability to find out more about the kid.[Check player Kim Ye-ri\u2019s status window and potential.][Name-Kim Ye-ri][Title-None. You should try a little more.][Age-14][Propensity-A wounded thief][Job-Archer][Job Effect-Acquisition of basic archery knowledge][Capacity][Strength-10/Growth Limit: Hero or higher][Agility-31/Growth Limit: Legend or higher][Health-12/Growth Limit: Hero or less][Intellect-15/Growth Limit: Hero or less][Durability-14 /Growth Limit: Hero or less][Luck-15/Growth Limit: Hero or higher][Holy-10/Growth Limit: Legend or higher][Overall Review-Has a stat limit above the legend level. Agility and magic power have legendary potential. The potential of other stats is also incomparable to player Lee Kiyoung. Please move carefully so as not to adversely affect children. She has gotten hurt, but she is still a pure child. The kid is quick to notice, but please don\u2019t hate her for it.]\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019This was the first time I saw anyone whose stats referred to heroes and legends except for Kim Hyunsung\u2019s. I immediately realized that Sun Hee-young was not who he was aiming for.The reason he headed to the slums in the first place was to bring in this child.Looking down at the kid, I also noticed that Sun Hee-young was looking at the little kid with distaste. Nevertheless, she did not act out of line.\u201cAh. This kid\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a child I met by chance here in the slums that looked so talented, so I brought her with me with the intention of teaching her. She still seems a little too young to go hunting herself\u2026 Ah! She\u2019s also a little shy, so it will take a little while for her to get acquainted with you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cWhat about you, Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cThe same is true for me. I was walking around the slums and accidentally came into contact with Sun Hee-young, the priest. We eventually got around to talking.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Kim Hyunsung blinked and seemed to be regarding Sun Hee-young for the first time since he approached us. Silence reigned as he inwardly weighed her.\u2018What is this feeling\u2026\u2019If I were Kim Hyunsung, I would have also tried to recruit her somehow while also focusing on the kid. The limit of her divine talent was beyond legendary.It didn\u2019t make any sense. Although the slums were generally a large place, it would be impossible not to bump into her at least once.This could only mean one thing. Sun Hee-young did not give off the same impression as the kid did to Kim Hyunsung.\u2018Why not?\u2019She was a priest guaranteed a bright future. As of now, she had the potential to grow even stronger if she was given the right kind of training.It was then that I suddenly had a strange thought. Could Sun Hee-young have gotten herself in a dire situation in the future? Is that why Kim Hyunsung did not bother trying to recruit her?However, they might not have met until now, so he had not tried to get her. Lindel was, after all, a big place, where events transpired almost everywhere.If Kim Hyunsung had been busy hunting to survive or had been stuck in training somewhere, he may not have heard the stories. This was also a possibility I had to consider. I shouldn\u2019t have panicked so fast.However, the thought that Sun Hee-young could have died for nothing came into my mind and refused to leave. Of course, I had no way of knowing how she would have died.After accepting a clan or guild\u2019s offer, she may have died in the middle of exploration, or maybe war would break out shortly and would sweep her away. She may also have fallen ill or may have been damaged by her chosen guild out of its selfish interests.But perhaps\u2026\u2018Perhaps she also died because of the poor\u2026\u2019As I said, I had no way of knowing.There was nothing I could do except to anticipate, but for some reason, I thought that Sun Hee-young had a bitter life in her previous lifetime.No, I didn\u2019t think. I was almost sure she did.\u201cThank you in the future, Ms. Hee-young.\u201d\u201cLikewise\u2026 Thank you very much, Mr. Hyunsung. I think I\u2019ll be in your debt for a long while.\u201dAh, Sun Hee-young. Always the ideal volunteer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTo summarize, both the kid Kim Ye-ri and the priest Sun Hee-young ended up joining our party.In all honesty, only the authorization of Kim Hyunsung was needed for the two people to join our team. However, the guild\u2019s higher-ups seemed to want to dispute this because we did not consult with the administrative team beforehand.For other parties, this would have posed little problem. However, our party was new, and Kim Hyunsung had been a member for less than a year.However, apart from this negative outlook, the fact that we had gotten someone like Sun Hee-young \u2013 someone who the other guilds and clans desperately wanted for themselves \u2013 had more than made up for their misgivings.\u2018We\u2019d also gotten her for a low bargain.\u2019It was no wonder her valuation within the guild shot up when Sun Hee-young announced that she would not join any other clan or guild.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party, which was admittedly still in the spotlight, once more became the subject of the Free City of Lindel\u2019s attention. I admittedly did not know the history of every survivor that had reached Lindel, but I was fairly certain no one had received as much attention in the past as our party.\u201cHyung! It\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dWhile I was still immersed in my experiments within my workshop, Park Deokgu slipped through the door after knocking.Recently, the party had made it a point to eat together during every meal. This was to become more acquainted with Sun Hee-young and Kim Ye-ri and discuss plans for our party. Compared to the four of us, who had been close since the start, it took some time for Kim Ye-ri and Sun Hee-young to warm up to the gang.Surprisingly, Jung Hayan and Sun Hee-young seemed well-matched, and the two became close friends. Meanwhile, I hadn\u2019t had the chance to converse with Kim Ye-ri, for she was always hiding her face and shying away.\u2018She\u2019s such a quick-witted kid, though\u2026\u2019Although she was freakishly quiet, she dutifully stuck to Kim Hyunsung, almost as if she could sense security within Hyunsung\u2019s power. I knew that it would take some time for her to warm up to us, but it also felt frustrating to see her being so unresponsive to me.Wanting to ease the slight awkwardness, Park Deokgu opened his mouth to speak.\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s Hyung so busy with? I hardly get to see you outside of meals.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot to do. I\u2019m doing so much at once, so I can\u2019t really focus on one.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me just one of them? My curiosity is driving me crazy. It\u2019s been so long since you started, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to tell me one of your secrets?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t do that suspense thing. Just tell me.\u201d\u201cThe most recent thing I was doing was a potion to control my emotions\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d\u201cIt was only a theory, but you can think of it as virtually impossible. I just thought I\u2019d try and see if I can touch the basic human needs\u2026\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201d\u201cSomething like sex, sleep, or appetite. In fact, if I get it correctly, it won\u2019t ever hurt your emotions. It\u2019s all about simply making you drowsy or feeling tired of your body\u2026\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 It\u2019s technically not controlling your emotions?\u201d\u201cThis is why touching emotions is fun. For example, suppose you created a potion that relaxes your muscles as well as your body. If you say you added something magical to it, the affected human would feel drowsy. This is because the brain interprets the body\u2019s signals at will.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is the same in other cases, like applying heat to the body or making the heart beat a little faster. You just need a little stimulus or plant a seed of thought in someone to make it work.\u201d\u201cIt sounds scary for some reason\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you have low intelligence, it will work a little better on you. Or\u2026\u201d\u201cOr\u2026\u201d\u201cOr if you\u2019re a little unsafe or unstable.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Park Deokgu hesitated, an expression similar to fear crossing his features. It might have been quite unsettling to hear about the possible creation of a potion that could control people\u2019s emotions.It had been pretty fun trying to make it, but it wasn\u2019t suitable for us. There were a lot of dramatic situations, and different materials were required for its creation.In short, it was a situation that did not yet seem to be viable.The one I had now was only a prototype for the final version of my desired product. Nevertheless, I couldn\u2019t say that this was useless.\u201cIt\u2019s just a joke.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. There\u2019s no way a potion like that could exist.\u201d\u201cAh, hyung!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just trying to imagine it. Originally, all experiments start with one\u2019s imagination. It means that every idea matters.\u201d\u201cSo, is it possible to visualize even the wrong type of idea?\u201d\u201cOnly if the situation fits.\u201d\u201cYou mean like the idea of a love potion?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an extension to the potion I said before.\u201d\u201cThen how about a potion that increases your stats when you drink? Or something like a potion that makes the user invisible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, a potion to become a monster! Is that possible?\u201dI didn\u2019t know if he was babbling or not, but the potions Park Deokgu had been mentioning were the ones I\u2019d been studying.As I looked at him with an expression of surprise, he smiled and began giving out more ideas. Some of them were things that I\u2019ve never even thought about, so I began to see him in a new light.For now, I only had theories I wanted to bring into reality, so I also ended up taking mental notes of unique ideas that came out of Park Deokgu\u2019s mouth.As I slowly went down to the guild house\u2019s basement, those who were gathered came into sight.\u201cOppa, are you here?\u201d\u201cKiyoung-nim.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s all sit down.\u201dJung Hayan looked up at me as she sat, and Sun Hee-young was also sitting in front of the table. Meanwhile, Kim Hyunsung nodded and welcomed me, and Kim Ye-ri, the youngest, was still looking around warily.\u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201cYes, good morning.\u201dAs I sat down, Jung Hayan brought my meal over to me. Sun Hee-young handed me my water.Interestingly, Sun Hee-young\u2019s propensity had not changed. She still saw herself as the ideal volunteer, embarrassingly enough.Perhaps it was possible because I thought I could change her with the course of events that had happened, but it seemed that the inclination to become the ideal volunteer would still stay with her.Instead, her job had changed.[Dark Priest \u2013 Hero Grade]The current job of being a priest of the sun was changed into being a dark priest. I thought it was probably the effect of what happened at that time, but there had been no difference in abilities or spells upon observation. Sun Hee-young was still able to memorize divine magic, and even Kim Hyunsung felt surprised by her ability.Of course, even the growth in Jung Hayan\u2019s case was distinguishable. In the case of the lovely returner Kim Hyunsung, there was no need for other explanations in the first place.Rather, it was with Park Deokgu that the growth rate had been a little slow. His endurance level continuously rose, but his muscle strength and stamina\u2019s growth rate were slower in comparison. His agility stats seemed to be the slowest out of everything.Although he seemed to be frustrated about it, I knew he understood why his growth had been like this, even with immense training. He and I had low growth potentials, and we just had to make do with what we had.Once everyone had settled in, Kim Hyunsung began to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s start eating.\u201d\u201cEnjoy your meal.\u201dSince Kim Hyunsung was the designated leader of our party, it was natural to show him respect before the meal. After his signaling nod, we began to eat in silence. However, after a few moments, some of them had started striking up a conversation with each other.They covered the most random topics, but I couldn\u2019t say I objected. This was my only break from my work, so it proved to be a pleasant distraction.However, one look at Kim Hyunsung informed me that an important announcement would be coming soon.\u201cI have something important to tell everyone.\u201dThe atmosphere became quiet in a second.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI got an offer from the Vice Guild Master this morning.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the offer about?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for a dungeon strategy. It seems that not only our party, but also parties of nearby large guilds will enter. I\u2019d love to hear what you think.\u201dThis was a little unexpected.Of course, I expected that we would be going hunting or dungeon-exploring someday. However, our party was still considered as a newcomer and would need some time to grow. We currently had six people, and if the little kid Kim Ye-ri went with him, it wouldn\u2019t be called bad timing because Kim Hyunsung had managed to get enough members in time.What came as a surprise to us was the fact that we would be joining another guild.Sometimes, dangerous and unexpected events could occur within dungeon explorations, so one needed to go with people they trusted. This was why the thought of joining up with other guilds hadn\u2019t crossed my mind.I couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cCan you tell us more?\u201dKim Hyunsung smiled slightly and answered. \u201cOf course. I haven\u2019t gotten a lot of details, but one of the mid-sized parties has found a new dungeon in the area near the tutorial dungeon.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2026\u201d\u201cThe problem is the members of the party. It was a dungeon that was discovered during a gathering of several guilds and not by a singular party, so the discussion about which guild will own it has become a little ambiguous.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019With this, I could understand just what was going on.\u201cAren\u2019t they directly involved in the attack?\u201d\u201cYeah. It seems that there is no need to attack the dungeon, as the results of the investigation reveal it to be a normal grade type. However, this is still considered as a rare discovery. They probably want to separate the rewards within instead. We also decided to share some of the stakes in the dungeon where the attack was completed.\u201d\u201cRather than attacking directly\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must have been decided to be used as an investment which will be supported by each guild and clan.\u201dTo put it simply, it meant that the fellowship party of each guild member had accidentally discovered a rare dungeon. The problem was that the dungeon level felt a bit low for the members of this social gathering to enter. Therefore, they probably thought it prudent to give the dungeon exploration to those who could use it for their growth.\u2018I guess Kim Hyunsung has made good relations with whoever\u2019s in charge.\u2019It felt a little strange that guilds were able to discuss without undergoing disputes over ownership. In fact, for the guys who discovered the dungeon, it would be a favorable situation for them because they could receive rewards from each guild and even receive some of the dungeon\u2019s shares.\u201cOne party from our Blue Guild, one from the Red Mercenary Guild, one from the Magic Guild, and finally, one from the Black Swan Guild will come together. Although it is a rare dungeon, it is said that there is no problem with all parties moving together because the dungeon is a bit large. The end rewards would probably be distributed according to the contribution of each party, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the degree of contribution?\u201d\u201cYeah. However, the purpose of this dungeon line is not to gain items or goods. It\u2019s to gain experience.\u201dI knew what Kim Hyunsung was trying to say. We would just be using this opportunity for our growths, and not for any other purpose. Any extra rewards would just be considered a bonus.Because of this line of reasoning, there was no reason to refuse.\u2018Thank you, Hyunsung.\u2019It was time to board the regressor bus and take action.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe announcement was a little too unexpected, so I found myself getting way more occupied.Our guild mother, Lee Sang-hee, was in charge of educating our party about the exploration, and what was left of our spare time was spent trying to achieve our daily tasks.The sad fact stood \u2013 our party had zero experience when it came to hunting or dungeon explorations. We could have said that the tutorial dungeon gave us some notion, but survival dungeons wouldn\u2019t be considered as experience by other people.In other words, our party had skipped the typical beginner\u2019s growth process. They had chosen for us to enter an advanced type dungeon without stopping to consider our experience.Of course, it might have been possible for people to overlook this as we had been quite the popular party in Lindel, but we all knew within ourselves that we were still newbies to this sort of thing.This was why we tried our absolute best to pile up as much basic dungeon knowledge as we could before the due date came.When a party moved together, the best practice would be to practice formation to prevent the weakening of defenses and memorize monsters\u2019 types and characteristics.In short, we were cramming both mental and physical training in preparation for the dungeon exploration. Thus, we were receiving special attention from the Blue Guild. Every member wanted to make sure we were in tip-top shape so as not to get left behind.\u2018I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to do this successfully, but\u2026\u2019We were indeed very lucky to have been given a chance to join a joint exploration this quickly, considering that we were newbies. It also felt weird to move with parties from other guilds, but looking from a different perspective, it meant that our safety was guaranteed. Plus, we would also learn a thing or two by watching their formations and react to certain situations within the dungeon.However, that didn\u2019t mean I was underestimating my party. In actuality, our fellow guilds\u2019 levels weren\u2019t that high compared to ours. It was just the experience in dungeons that separated us from each other.In short, we were still very lucky to be given this opportunity.\u201cBy the way\u2026 Are you really going to take Kim Ye-ri with us?\u201d\u201cYeah. It may be dangerous, but it will be a great experience for her. Being young and new to this sort of thing is both an advantage and a disadvantage.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt was quite surprising that Kim Hyunsung had also chosen to take Kim Ye-ri with us. However, I knew that he must have decided to do so for a reason. Kim Hyunsung wasn\u2019t the type to take a risk when he knew that it might put the whole team in danger, after all.In any case, our party rushed to complete our preparations before the due date came.Kim Hyunsung was the one who was particularly assigned to attend the meetings outside, and it was through this that I could feel that our first expedition as the Blue Guild\u2019s Seventh Division Party was fast approaching.Finally, the day of the dungeon exploration came.\u201cDeokgu, have you packed everything that we need to bring?\u201d\u201cOf course. Well, some of the guild members already packed their luggage in advance\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Hee-young, can you check if there is anything still missing? I\u2019m also not sure if the others are in good shape to move.\u201d\u201cYes, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cJung Hayan, please make sure all the food, drinking water, and potions are ready to go.\u201d\u201cYes, oppa.\u201dIn truth, I was the busiest. I was the one pulling strings behind the scenes, making sure everyone would be properly prepared in time for the exploration. I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience Kim Hyunsung by having him think of everything, after all.It was crucial for someone to be in charge of all the basic needs. This included checking the necessary supplies, preparing for the expedition in advance, etc.In other words, I took care of the less fun parts that came with planning for a guild expedition.\u2018I will prepare everything, Hyunsung. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u2019As expected, Kim Hyunsung was very appreciative of the way I had stepped in to handle things. It was important for me to show that I was still worth the investment. I might be lacking in power or growth potential, but at least he would see me as someone useful to have around.\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t leave out any equipment. Hayan, when you\u2019re done, bring the equipment you decided to rent from the guild warehouse\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, oppa.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring the arrows along for Ye-ri.\u201d\u201cYes, of course!\u201dI might be busy, but it was also important for me to look busier. As it was my first expedition, I had to make sure I made my position within the party clear in advance.If the party\u2019s father were Kim Hyunsung, then the party\u2019s mother would be me, Lee Kiyoung.It wasn\u2019t all that hard to do. All I had to do was check the list for anything we might be missing, and make sure that the preparations were all in place.When I saw Kim Hyunsung come into sight, whistling, and in a good mood, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cI think I\u2019m somewhat ready. You should also check yourself before we go, Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kiyoung, I\u2019m okay. There will be no other problem. Another party will be waiting outside. Let\u2019s start soon.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThis tedious job felt less hassling when I knew that the leader trusted me enough to take care of this sort of thing. I couldn\u2019t help but let a smile overtake my features.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, sure.\u201dAs we headed outside, we could see unfamiliar faces waiting. They had all their attention on us, presumably trying to size us up.\u201cOh, that\u2019s Sun Hee-young, am I right?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the party that the Blue Guild decided to assign?\u201d\u201cWell, I can understand why they had to get them at an expensive price. You can see their potential even by just looking at them.\u201d\u201cI kind of feel jealous. Their starting line is different from ours\u2026\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t even shown their true abilities yet\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the whole reason for the hunt?\u201d\u201cSo, does that mean we\u2019ll have to support them?\u201dAmidst all the looks we were receiving, one expression in familiar stood out \u2013 the expression of jealousy.We had rented equipment from the guild warehouse, but the difference was that the ones we were given were of good quality. Most of the equipment our would-be expedition members were wearing were worn-out and dull-looking in comparison.I couldn\u2019t blame them. If I were in their shoes, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from comparing, either.One could see it just by looking at Park Deokgu.Instead of the fragile wooden shield that he used back in the tutorial, he was now holding an iron-encrusted shield that not only looked pretty good but also had higher defense stats compared to regular type shields. He was also wearing chain armor instead of the customary leather armor that was normally used for shoelaces.If Park Deokgu\u2019s strength stat had only been a little higher, he would have also been able to wear a whole body-plated armor.None of us were wearing any hero-grade equipment, but we weren\u2019t using items that screamed \u2018beginner,\u2019 either.As we slowly approached them, I couldn\u2019t help but notice each guild\u2019s emblem imprinted on their respective members.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too.\u201dHaving met several times in advance, the party leaders were well-acquainted with each other.Another notable thing to observe was that one of the Red Mercenary Guild members looked at our party with a favorable expression.\u2018Oh? He seems interesting.\u2019\u201cNice to meet you. I am Choi Young-ki of the Red Mercenary Guild. I heard a lot about you from the master.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I am Kiyoung Lee.\u201dOf course, it was only natural for Cha Hee-ra to employ people who would report back to her about my current standing and how this expedition would go. The Red Mercenary Guilds were very easy to distinguish, as they were all wearing red.Meanwhile, one of the other men who were busy greeting Jung Hayan looked like the Magic Guild members. He was wearing a badge that looked like a magic circle, and he had already struck up a conversation with her, seemingly having a lot of questions he wanted to ask.Those who went to greet Kim Hyunsung, in particular, were the members of the Black Swan Guild. As expected, they were wearing their guild badge. Their party consisted of five women and one man.\u2018Ah, so the rumors are true.\u2019Most members of the Black Swan Guild were said to be women. There were little differences, but they formed quite the formidable party.Since there were so many guilds, each with their respective parties, it was hard to greet everyone successfully. Of course, the most popular person in the entire crowd would be our very own priest, Sun Hee-young.\u201cYou finally decided to go active.\u201d\u201cYeah. Some things happened, and I found myself joining Blue Guild. Please take good care of me, everyone.\u201d\u201cHaving you as part of this team is very reassuring, haha.\u201d\u201cOh, no. In fact, I am not familiar with the ins and outs of the dungeon, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be of much help. I\u2019ll still try my best, regardless!\u201d\u201cYes, sure. Then let\u2019s go as soon as we\u2019re ready.\u201dDue to the atmosphere, the Red Mercenary\u2019s Choi Young-ki decided to lead this expedition. Seeing as he had the best stats and came from the best guild among every guild present, it was completely understandable for him to do so.Though he did not have hero-grade stats, he had put a lot of effort into trying to make sure his stats were as high as possible.To me, it felt like Park Deokgu had a higher potential rate, and if Park Deokgu were to train without giving up continuously, he would probably grow to be as strong as Choi Young-ki, if not even stronger.\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to see the rumored party in person, Mr. Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cNo, we are the lucky ones. This is also my first expedition. I came with the mindset to learn before anything else.\u201d\u201cHahaha. In fact, I was also one of the ones who watched your demonstration before. My goodness\u2026 I really thought of you as a genius. Your excessive humility is poisonous.\u201d\u201cThank you so much for watching me.\u201d\u201cI just had to. Even Miss Jung Hayan showed great potential.\u201dChoi Young-ki exhibited quite a pleasant personality. His other party members were the same for the most part. Meanwhile, the Magic Guild struck me as the quiet type.I didn\u2019t know what the Black Swan Guild people were thinking, but they didn\u2019t seem to be wary of us.However, this didn\u2019t mean that we were completely free from judgments. Our judgment came in the form of Kim Ye-ri. After all, she was still just a child.It was then that one of the people from the Black Swan Guild spoke.\u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about you bringing young children to the expedition, Mr. Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cHe will not interfere. Before being a child, she is also a talented archer. I will make sure she isn\u2019t a nuisance to the expedition.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dI knew tension would be inevitable between guilds. We just needed to give them an opening to take. However, we couldn\u2019t just back down from the taunts either. We needed to assess them first to see where we would end up standing.I had already looked at everyone\u2019s stats from the first moment that I laid my eyes on them, but I thought I had to look at them one more time. Thus, I slowly activated my ability.[Check player Yura Jung\u2019s status window and potential.][Name-Jung Yura][Title-None. You should try a little more.][Age-29][Propensity-Calculating Strategist][Job-Assassination Thief-Rare Grade][Job Effect-Acquisition of basic archery knowledge][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of basic dagger skills][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of basic trapping knowledge][Job Effect-Acquisition of Basic Assassination Knowledge][Capacity][Strength -41/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Agility-55/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Health -43/Growth limit: Hero or less][Intellect -40/Growth limit: Rare or less][Durability-20/Growth limit: Rare or higher][Luck -23/Growth limit: Rare or less][Holy-43/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Overall Review \u2013 Has the stats and potential to be useful as an assassin. It is noticeable that the disposition, occupation, and stats are very well matched. Must have the talent to grow smoothly. If you assume that she gets a legendary item or job, she is a talent who can grow explosively. However, her personality doesn\u2019t look as good. Of course, compared to player Lee Kiyoung, she still looks like a saint.]\u2018Ah, so she\u2019s okay.\u2019I\u2019ve seen so many monster-like stats, so hers weren\u2019t all that impressive, but her possible growth rate still showed much promise. It also looked like she was doing a very good job as an assassin.From an in-depth assessment, I could guess her role to center around trap dismantling or rear disturbance. Therefore, I could understand the snarky tone. Her responsibility was also to make sure that we wouldn\u2019t be ambushed or caught off-guard. This also meant ensuring that there were no possibly weak links in the party.\u201cWe aren\u2019t here to look after you\u2026\u201d A voice muttered from behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOf course, I could understand where they were coming from.From the other guild parties\u2019 perspective, they had already sacrificed a lot just to let us \u2013 a lower spec party \u2013 join the expedition.Our party was the least experienced here. It wasn\u2019t only our first time doing a dungeon exploration, but it was also our first time engaging in hunting activities, and all of them here knew it. Thus, if we were to bring Kim Ye-ri, who was a kid, with us, it would mean lugging around baggage that was twice as heavy.\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that, we can still have fun.\u201d\u201cHow can you make dungeon exploration fun, Choi Young-ki? This is not a joke. No matter how many people are involved\u2026 It was natural to be worried about our wellbeing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though our overall specifications are high, please remember that we are not here for sightseeing. You have to be aware that any dungeon can become dangerous at any time.\u201d\u201cWe will work harder.\u201dEven in the midst of that, Choi Young-ki still chose to take our side. Perhaps Cha Hee-ra had said something to him beforehand.\u201cAh, well, we\u2019re not saying that we don\u2019t have faith in the Red Mercenaries\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, the atmosphere feels a little uncomfortable now. Well, I suppose it\u2019s time to give a briefing.\u201d\u201cYes, okay.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cAs you\u2019ve heard, the dungeon we are entering is a rare find. The name of the dungeon is Garden of Terror, and the guild\u2019s analysis is that plant-type monsters will dominate the entire area.\u201dThis was something we already knew. It seemed that this \u2018briefing\u2019 was only brought up for the sole purpose of lightening up the atmosphere.As we were walking, I could see that Choi Young-ki\u2019s disposition wasn\u2019t so bad. Rather, he was exerting quite the effort to alleviate the nervous mood within the group.\u201cHyung, doesn\u2019t he look like a good person?\u201d\u201cHuh. It also seems that way to me.\u201dPark Deokgu had also seemed to notice, and a part of me agreed. I felt comfortable knowing we had such a tanker as a leader, someone who was considerate of his comrades.He was calm, knew how to communicate with people, and was good at skills. Choi Young-ki was a pro when it came to reading the atmosphere and minimizing any form of conflict. He was the type of tank that Park Deokgu should aspire to be.As we walked and talked, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long until we\u2019d arrive at our destination.It was a little annoying to pass through places where enormous thorn bushes had gathered, but the slowing of the pace had given me ample time to observe the entrance of the dungeon.\u2018Why\u2019s it so small?\u2019The entrance itself was indeed a small opening where only one or two people could enter at the same time. However, it exuded an ominous, magical aura, almost beckoning any passer-by to enter it. It looked both dangerous and magnificent at the same time.I never imagined a dungeon entrance could look so enticing.After gazing at the entrance for some time, Choi Young-ki nodded and turned to us.\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to go in slowly. The order of entry will be in this manner: Black Swan, Magic, and Blue. As there is a possibility that a battle may start as soon as possible, we will try to get in as quickly and efficiently as we can. Am I understood?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFollowing Young-ki\u2019s command, people split into pairs while categorizing themselves according to their respective parties. I was at the very back, my hand holding Jung Hayan\u2019s firmly.Upon entering, I felt like the air had changed, and after a while, I heard a familiar message.[You have entered the Garden of Terror, a rare dungeon. Number of people [24/30] checked.]Right after this, I could hear a voice from the front. \u201cFan out! Put some distance, quickly! Our first opponent is here. Be careful not to get in anyone\u2019s way or formation!\u201dI found it a little silly to come face to face with a monster right off the bat, but I knew I should have expected it. This dungeon positively oozed infinite magical power.The Red Mercenaries immediately took up the front positions and were blocking the monsters trying to break through their formation as best as possible.I observed the monsters\u2019 physique. They were grotesque-looking plant giants that were about twice the size of a regular human. With every step they took, the ground shook slightly. This signaled that, unlike normal plants, these weighed as heavy as iron. It wasn\u2019t easy to understand how they could move so efficiently as their bodies were made of stems and roots, but I knew now was not the time to question this.I lightly knocked Deokgu on the head, seeing the guy looking up at the monsters in a trance.\u201cDeokgu.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like he was scared. Rather, he had just felt an initial shock upon seeing the monsters. Coming to his senses, Deokgu rushed forward to take his position as a shield tanker. The rest of the parties\u2019 tankers were also doing the same to give their fellow party members ample time to attack.It was difficult to maintain a solid formation due to the cramped space, but they were trying their best to provide somehow enough space for swordsmen and spearmen to move.\u201cI will keep pushing. Please start attacking slowly.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dAt that time, Park Deokgu, who had courageously jumped out first, suddenly lost focus. He was unable to withstand the attack and lost his balance.\u201cPriest!\u201d\u201cOn my way.\u201dSun Hee-young immediately uttered a spell to support Park Deokgu, and Kim Hyunsung stepped forward in an attempt to help.However, we were a tad too late. A monster came rushing through the gap that Park Deokgu had opened up, and it was rushing straight towards us.\u2018Fuck.\u2019The formation had already collapsed.I thought about uttering the spells integrated within my ring, but it felt like such a waste to use them at the very beginning of the dungeon.Seeing Kim Hyunsung leaping up to stand in its way, it seemed like no one would get hurt, but I still felt anxious.However, before anyone from our party even took the first offensive stance, the incoming monster was slammed sideways. Our savior turned out to be Choi Young-ki.Quang!\u201cSupport is needed here!\u201d\u201cNoted!\u201d\u201cWho\u2026\u201dHis intervention had sparked a change. Order began to spread throughout the parties once more, and the other guild parties were efficiently ridding the dungeon entrance of its monsters.Of course, Kim Hyunsung was able to steadily inflict damage in the midst of that, but the problem was that Jung Hayan and I could hardly help with how efficiently he took them out.This was the moment where I could see the difference between guild parties. It wasn\u2019t just about the difference in our stats; it was also about our experience in teamwork.\u2018We aren\u2019t working together properly.\u2019As soon as the first wave of opponents had been cleared, Choi Young-ki addressed a breathless Park Deokgu.\u201cIt seems you moved too quickly.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 That\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201d\u201cThis often happens when you lack experience. It would be better to put some strength on the lower body.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take note of that.\u201dMy gratitude towards Choi Young-ki began to rise as he simultaneously calmed Park Deokgu down and even gave him helpful advice.\u201cThen, we will organize the surroundings together.\u201d\u201cYes, okay.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like Park Deokgu had received a major injury, but the wounded expression on his face revealed that the real source of pain came from his failure.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, everyone\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to be sorry for. Deokgu. This is an experience for all of us who are newbies.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cHyunsung is right, Deokgu. There is no need to be so somber. Just continue to work hard with the intention of learning throughout this expedition. You will soon get better.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 I shall try my best.\u201d\u201cAs you are now, the attack will feel a little heavier for you. It would be nice to lower your posture a little, so you\u2019ll be able to stand your ground.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIt may take some time to get used to, but you will be able to do it well.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll try.\u201dI felt a little worried about seeing Park Deokgu\u2019s gloomy disposition. The fact stood that he had the potential to become an amazing tanker, but at his current state, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the more experienced types, such as Choi Young-ki. He was feeling a lot more pressure as the person tasked with the role of standing in front, too. He knew that losing formation could mean the downfall of his team.He was such a simple guy; I knew dungeons would easily be able to bring his mood down.\u201cHey, Young-ki Choi.\u201d\u201cYeah? Do you have anything to say, Yura?\u201d\u201cThose from the Blue Guild\u2026 I think it would be better to place their tanker over there in the rear.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cHe still seems a little off with his physique. He might bring more damage if he is to stand at the very front. At least he can shield us from any potential rear ambushes.\u201dIt was, once again, the Black Swan brat who had spoken.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019Park Deokgu stepped forward.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that you want to prove yourself, but this isn\u2019t the time and place to do so. As it is, the difference in stats and experience is too high.\u201d\u201cHe will probably get used to it soon. He seems to have good durability\u2026 Given enough time\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. If he falls out again, Choi Young-ki will have to help them. As a result, the formation itself becomes dangerous. Unlike the Red Mercenary Guild tanker, which has good durability stats, the other parties have a low durability except for our tanks. The unexpected can always happen. I think you know what it means if you get swept aside?\u201d\u201cNevertheless\u2026 Even if you tell me that\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I suggest you take to the rear. I think even the Magic guild agrees.\u201dChoi Young-ki was defending us against Yura\u2019s harsh words, but I had a feeling it wasn\u2019t just because Cha He-raa had ordered him to. It felt like he wanted us to improve.However, it wasn\u2019t only because of this. Even though Choi Young-ki was the de facto leader of the entire group, the authority of where to place Park Deokgu still rested on our party, and no one else\u2019s.Even if it was appropriate to give such an opinion, it still felt disrespectful all the same. It should have been one of us who made this suggestion instead of another party guild member.In short, this kind of behavior would only cause unrest and conflict among guilds.\u2018This bitch\u2026\u2019I had suspected what kind of person she was right from the start, but we hadn\u2019t even been inside the dungeon for long, and she was already getting on my nerves.\u2018Computational strategist, my ass.\u2019It felt like she was trying to cut our party down for the heck of it rather than thinking of the safety of the party expedition itself. I knew why \u2013 she wanted to harvest more of the end rewards for herself, and the only way to do that was to criticize another party\u2019s contributions.However, our party genuinely only wanted the experience. Gaining items was just a bonus.Her method had started to piss me off, though. Why was she employing such political tactics on a guild expedition? This was such bullshit.My mouth started to itch.She wanted to resort to these types of tactics? Two could play that game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the kind of political tactic Yura was trying to employ, understanding the situation around you was paramount. This meant that the opinions of those who had the right to vote were important.As this was a fight for the public\u2019s approval, now was hardly a good time to go against her.Unlike Jung Y-ra, who had already established a firm standing as both an experienced member and explorer, I was still just a newbie party member who hadn\u2019t proved anything yet. Although the Red Mercenary people regarded me highly, they would not risk extending their hand out so far to help me.Therefore, I had a new top priority. I had to establish my standing within this party to prove to everyone that I, along with the rest of my party members, were not useless like they thought.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I started, bowing slightly.The first thing to do in a situation like this was to apologize. Much of the group members\u2019 attention was on me now. I continued speaking.\u201cI know anything unexpected can happen in an expedition, which is why I understand your anxiety. We also understand that you already have yourselves to focus on, and you can\u2019t do the same for our party. However, please give us one more chance to prove ourselves.\u201d\u201cBut this is\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you are concerned for our well-being. Please, just give us one more shot. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d I was careful to keep my tone sincere. This was the best way to get the hearts of my audience.As expected, many of my fellow group members nodded and showed preference to my words. They respected my choice to prove the usefulness of my party once more.Jung Yura, too, looked a little embarrassed, and the expression on her face was as clear as day.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Even Park Deokgu had begun to bow his head in apology, adding Jung Yura\u2019s embarrassment even more.I didn\u2019t think he should apologize. He had just stumbled by accident, and it was his first time. Since it was our blunder, we would be the ones to die first, and they could still have the time to escape.However, I knew this kind of reasoning would not work well with the others, so humility was the best option we could take. Jung Yura began to speak.\u201cDungeon strategy is not a joke. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t say I like giving second chances in dangerous situations like these, but\u2026 I guess I can give you another chance.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d With this, I lowered my head even further. Park Deokgu seemed both moved and sorry with my initiative to step in for him.\u201cHyung\u2026 I really have nothing to say except sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, Deokgu. Anyone can make mistakes. Don\u2019t be scared. Try again. You\u2019ll be able to do it successfully the next time.\u201dI neglected to say that Jung Yura would have gained the upper hand if something did happen during his blunder. If we so much as had a casualty on our hands, the fault would lie entirely on our guild party and our guild party alone. An apology would not work in that kind of situation.However, since nothing bad had happened, the entire group found our blunder easily forgivable. No one suffered any major injuries, and we could still repel the first wave of monsters. On the contrary, most of the other people had begun to approach a gloomy Park Deokgu to offer comfort words.\u2018Everyone here knows what it\u2019s like to be a beginner, so they must be sympathetic.\u2019Everyone had been a newbie at one point. It was a normal occurrence to make mistakes if one was inexperienced. This was especially true for a new tanker like Park Deokgu, whose role garnered the most pressure. He needed to stay in front, soak the damage, and ensure protection to his allies. Failure to do so might result in the death of a team member.Thus, it was not unreasonable to think that the pressure might hinder his effectiveness.\u201cIt is important to prevent attacks, but it would be better to think of deflecting them, juniors.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cAnytime, anywhere, just remember, huh? It\u2019s important to hold on to your lower body.\u201d\u201cOkay, senior\u2026 I\u2019ll remember.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I understand. When dealing with such large beasts, it\u2019s normal to mess up when you feel scared. I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, my friend here first encountered a medium-sized monster when he was new and got so scared that he couldn\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cHey, didn\u2019t I tell you to keep that a secret?!\u201dChoi Young-ki ignored his party member. \u201cActually, it\u2019s proof that you\u2019ve come a long way, junior. You needn\u2019t be so gloomy. Instead of standing still, instinct drove you to stand in front. Even if you feel pressured, you must remember you are not alone. Your party members won\u2019t be weak, either. It is important to trust your colleagues behind you and hold on to the end. If you have that kind of mindset, you can do anything.\u201d\u201cThank you, senior\u2026\u201d\u201cBe strong.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t move so quickly next time, however.\u201dSeeing that our so-called seniors had known each other beforehand had worried me. I thought they would shut us out and disregard our potentials, seeing as we were still inexperienced.This was why seeing Park Deokgu being comforted by everyone made me feel happy.I didn\u2019t want to join the crowd as I was not in the mood for socializing, but it was heartwarming to watch from a distance. If I were in their shoes, I would have reacted differently.\u2018This kind of softness can lead to their downfall, however\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t ponder too much on the thought. Seeing Park Deokgu with such a bright smile made me smile in return. He looked adorable.\u201cHyung!\u201d\u201cDeokgu. Come here and give this to them.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThis is a health potion. It would be better to use it here than sell it on the market. I have to give a reward somehow.\u201d\u201cAh. That\u2019s right! Thank you, hyung!\u201dPark Deokgu accepted the potion and ran back to offer some to the other members. I couldn\u2019t stop myself from smiling wryly at the scene.He had to be a bit more serious when it came to this gathering. That alone would prove to be advantageous for our party.Kim Hyunsung was also cheering for Park Deokgu.\u201cThis was given by my hyung!\u201d\u201cThank you for this, Kiyoung!\u201d\u201cAt first glance, this potion\u2026 Have you ever seen anything like this on the market?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen this type of potion before. It seems like the Blue Guild\u2019s money wasn\u2019t wasted on hiring an alchemist like him.\u201dOf course, it was also crucial for me to raise my popularity and reliability levels with these people in one way or another. While we moved, the bigger guys started to teach Park Deokgu the proper stances, and even after the next wave of monsters came, no other accident occurred.It was all about holding the center and supporting his back so he wouldn\u2019t fall, but he was getting used to dealing with monsters. All in all, they looked like a group of brothers supporting each other on the front lines.Of course, I couldn\u2019t say that we made no more mistakes after that. However embarrassed she was, Jung Yura was still on the lookout for anything else she could criticize.Of course, she didn\u2019t dare talk as openly as she did the first time. She would sigh as if she disliked the fact that she couldn\u2019t find anything else to prey on now and then.However, no one sympathized with how she felt. The rest of us were all getting along quite well.\u201cBecause of the large number of people, our formation seems a little too complicated. I\u2019m glad we were able to organize ourselves efficiently.\u201d\u201cHahaha. Still, isn\u2019t it going well so far?\u201d\u201cI apologize, but I feel like we can do better. It feels like something is hindering us.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s because we\u2019re not the perfect party. If it were an expedition for one guild only, it would have been easier to work together as we all know each other. However, we\u2019re all from different guilds. I think we\u2019ve been working quite well considering our slight handicap.\u201d\u201cYeah, I agree. I just feel like we could improve, even more, you know?\u201d\u201cI suppose so\u2026 Should we take a break for now?\u201d\u201cYes, sure.\u201dUpon hearing this kind of approval, I stepped out of my party and approached Choi Young-ki. I had meant to converse with him right from the start, and now that we had chosen to take up camp for the time being, I felt like now was a perfect time.\u201cChoi Young-ki.\u201d\u201cAh! Kiyoung!\u201dHis natural, friendly expression comforted me. He was part of Cha Hee-ra\u2019s army, after all, and I was her assigned gigolo. He definitely wouldn\u2019t have any plans to harm me.\u201cMay I?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. Please sit here.\u201d\u201cHow is Cha Hee-ra?\u201d\u201cHahaha, I knew you\u2019d feel curious enough to ask sooner or later.\u201dJung Hayan was still being talked to by the Magic Guild, so I knew I\u2019d be undisturbed for the time being.\u201cMy master has asked me to take care of you, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cBecause of that, I apologize if I was not able to stand up for you earlier.\u201d\u201cNo, I understand! I was able to smooth things out. Anyway, if you did try, the other guilds would start to feel suspicious.\u201d\u201cAh. That\u2026\u201dChoi Young-ki probably knew who I was talking about already, from the way he subtly glanced at Jung Yura.\u201cI still feel sorry, though. I should have paid more attention to\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no. Our party made a mistake. I\u2019m actually grateful to all of you for being so considerate. Thank you for saving us earlier.\u201d\u201cWell, making mistakes is normal as a newbie, but people shouldn\u2019t beat you up for it. When I was in your place, Mr. Kiyoung, I was a spoiled boy that didn\u2019t know anything. I was able to grow this much because our master took care of me.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cI heard that you had been my master\u2019s lover back on Earth.\u201d\u2018What\u2026\u2019I found myself too mortified even to say anything.\u201cMy master said she received help when she needed it the most. She also said that you, Lee Kiyoung, were the benefactor.\u201dI blinked. This was a new development to the rumor.\u201cUm, yes, I certainly remember\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you are my master\u2019s benefactor, then you are also my benefactor. Without her help, I would not be where I am today.\u201dI hadn\u2019t expected Cha Hee-ra to devise such a story.\u2018Thank you, Cha Hee-ra.\u2019I wanted to applaud Cha Hee-ra for coming up with such a passionate backstory.I subtly looked behind me to make sure Jung Hayan wasn\u2019t eavesdropping and was relieved to see that she was too far away to hear anything substantial.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take the story so seriously, you know.\u201d\u201cHahaha, well, I still want to help. In fact, I\u2019d be willing to save your life for as many times as needed.\u201d\u2018What is this bullshit\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t know where he was getting such cheesy, passionate lines, and I didn\u2019t want to find out. However, what was important to note was that this guy, Choi Young-ki, liked me. The fact that he was the de facto leader of this entire group just made things even better.I thought he was simply nice to me, but it turned out that there was a deeper intention behind his friendliness.Seeing that this was the type of welcoming I would receive from their guild, their party would be like my garden for this expedition\u2019s duration. They would be a solid foundation that would surely side with my party with whatever conflicts would rain down on the future group.I looked up, sensing a pair of eyes on me. Jung Yura was looking this way, dissatisfaction clear as day on her face. When she saw me looking back at her, she turned away without a word.I smiled. I wanted to tell her that her tactics wouldn\u2019t work on me.\u2018She should just focus on genuinely wanting to protect these people\u2019s lives.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt wasn\u2019t difficult to learn how the system worked here within our group.Much like the food or popularity chain back on earth, one had to be familiar with where they stood to act accordingly. This meant I couldn\u2019t just suddenly take charge like how I was used to ordering my party members back in the guild.That didn\u2019t mean I was going to let myself be flat-out bossed around, either.Everyone kept up a steady stream of chat every time we chose to stop and set up camp to rest for a while. Seriousness was displayed during the exploring and fighting itself, but the atmosphere was amicable for the most part.Still, though, it was quite apparent that the Magic Guild had taken a liking to Jung Hayan, while the people from the Red Mercenary Guild had warmed up to me.This meant that I could also utilize the Magic Guild members to stand by our side should conflict ever arise within the group thanks to Jung Hayan.\u201cIt seems like your potion could be as efficient as divine magic, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an overstatement. Please, lower your voice. I don\u2019t want to offend any of the priests.\u201d\u201cHonestly speaking, your magic power doesn\u2019t seem to be that big. So then, how\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, that kind of feels a little insulting.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the rude greeting. I\u2019m just your typical wizard who got a little too curious.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s fine. To answer your question, there are drawbacks to memorizing or uttering spells, for it takes some time to activate them. However, if you have a good catalyst, you can use magic with good efficiency.\u201d\u201cEfficiency means\u2026\u201d\u201cWith less magic power, you can complete skills or spells with just as much impact.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cOf course, it doesn\u2019t mean that this doesn\u2019t come with its own drawbacks. The catalyst cost to memorize spells is quite expensive.\u201d\u201cDo you have any idea about how much it will cost?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about 30 gold. It mainly uses the essence of magic power.\u201d\u201cAh! The essence of magic.\u201d\u201cYeah. The cost of the essence of using lesser magic is 30 gold.\u201dI could see the surprise in the man\u2019s expression. At the same time, I could also see him steadily losing his interest in his inquiry.It was a natural reaction. To make up for the lack of magic power, one had to spend 30 gold every time they intended to cast a magic spell with a good amount of impact.Of course, this wasn\u2019t a problem for me. The Blue Guild supported me, and I still had many of the things that Cha Hee-ra had gifted me.\u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s definitely efficient. So, by any chance, will the Essence of Magic Power of Rare Grade or higher disappear once you use it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little disappointing.\u201d\u201cIf there is an essence that can extract magical power indefinitely, that\u2019ll be the Sage\u2019s Stone.\u201d\u201cSage\u2019s Stone. Ah, yes, the Sage\u2019s Stone\u2026\u201dWizards and sorcerers thrived on these types of topics.\u201cCan you make it?\u201d\u201cThe book I\u2019m currently studying only briefly mentions it. Even research hasn\u2019t been done properly yet. I don\u2019t have enough to go on as it is, but one day, I shall definitely craft one.\u201d\u201cYou mean to say you will start the research for it?\u201d\u2018Honestly? I find all the rave about the Sage\u2019s Stone a load of bull.\u2019\u201cYeah. Of course, I will. I believe it\u2019s a worthwhile investment.\u201dI knew alchemy wasn\u2019t a popular class. However, that didn\u2019t stop most wizards from being curious about what it entailed. Using his curiosity to my advantage, I got quite close to the last guy of the Magic Guild.Meanwhile, the expedition\u2019s dungeon attack proceeded smoothly, and our party was blending in nicely with other parties.I didn\u2019t know if Kim Hyunsung had realized my intentions, but there were certainly other things to gain than experience or the end rewards.In Park Deokgu\u2019s case, he had successfully entered the tanker\u2019s community. He was extracting a lot of information from his fellow tankers, and even Kim Ye-ri was also quite successful in adapting. I could tell this from the fact that no one had complained about it yet. I knew this was because the kid was naturally talented with the bow that no one could find fault with her.It was already a given that Sun Hee-young would adapt quite well, given her stats and reputation, so I was never worried about her. The same went for Jung Hayan.However, it was different for Kim Hyunsung. He was the one who had not been taking any opportunity to prove himself. I knew this wasn\u2019t because he was trying to hide his power. It was because he just hadn\u2019t found an opening he found suitable to show his potential.This was mainly because the expedition was proceeding so smoothly.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll see you for a moment.\u201d\u201cYeah. I think I will be staying here today. If you have time, would you be able to repeat the conversation once more? I want more details about this Sage\u2019s Stone.\u201d\u201cYes, sure, of course.\u201d I nodded and began to move away.\u2018Ah, there she is.\u2019I could see Jung Yura heading towards me. I knew she would approach me eventually, but this was a little faster than I thought.\u201cI thought you were here to experience, but you must have come to socialize?\u201dAh, she even had no decency\u2014what a straightforward question. Nevertheless, her question slightly embarrassed me.\u2018Am I that annoying in her eyes?\u2019Perhaps I did look like that, seeing as I had so eagerly struck a conversation with various people from different guilds. It didn\u2019t take long for her to bare her fangs at me, seeing me achieving my goals so successfully.\u201cHahaha, the rose seems to have shown its thorns to me, Yura.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you this because it seems like you\u2019re overdoing it, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about. Isn\u2019t it natural to build friendships for teamwork? I hardly knew anyone here when we first arrived.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much. You\u2019re being too comfortable.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWhat did I say before? The unexpected can happen anytime inside a dungeon. It\u2019s not good to be too comfortable with other people.\u201d\u201cI thought I was doing well to ensure that we don\u2019t become a hindrance to you. Aren\u2019t we progressing smoothly? Our tanker made a mistake at first, but now he\u2019s adapting very well. The rest of us have been doing a decent job, so I don\u2019t know what else is wrong.\u201dI knew I had spoken the truth.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cYes, Yura?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here\u2026 A dungeon is a place where you don\u2019t know what threats will happen, and where they may come from. No matter how much they let you approach during the breaks\u2026 Don\u2019t you really know that you\u2019ve been hindering the party?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t aware. Rather, I think I am helping the party. I think I\u2019ve made the atmosphere nicer than it was before. Just because you are dissatisfied doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is. Of course, I am aware of the need to be on my guard. I just don\u2019t know what else it is that you are expecting from me.\u201dI smiled at her quite coldly, wanting to show her that I wasn\u2019t going to let her walk all over me. However, the main reason for my uppity personality was to spark a reaction from her. After all, I had quite the talent for provocation. I then continued.\u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t be so worried about how much influence I have over the group. You must not be greedy about the items that we will get as a reward for attacking the dungeon. Of course, if it\u2019s a rare item, so I know you would definitely want to get your hands on it. There is no way that you, Jung Yura, would pressure me into giving up my share.\u201dI paused for a bit before I continued with my assault.\u201cPerhaps there may be hero-grade items, but I hardly care about that. Instead, it would be nasty if people were to find out you\u2019ve been pressuring someone else to get your hands on a lot of them. Really, Yura, what kind of tactics are you resorting to? No offense, but they\u2019re not very effective.\u201dJung Yura\u2019s expression at this point was dangerous.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cDo I look like a joke to you?\u201d\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t find you funny either. After all, you\u2019re Jung Yura of Black Swan. By the way\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you speak to me so plainly and rudely?\u201dAt this point, Yura had the decency to feel embarrassed by my sudden change of posture. She had not been expecting me to retaliate like this; that much was for sure.\u201cI am a guild member who is registered in the official party of the Blue Guild. You shouldn\u2019t disrespect me like this, Jung Yura.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 I hardly care if you\u2019re supported by the Blue Guild, or even by the Red Mercenary Guild. You think Cha Hee-ra will protect you even here?\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me right now, Jung Yura? You really should be careful about what you say. I don\u2019t need Cha Hee-ra here to deal with you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI exhaled. She looked so pathetically clueless with that confused expression of hers.I did not want to waste time arguing with her further. Instead, I opened my mouth and began to speak in a louder tone of voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI made sure that my voice was loud enough to be overheard by the rest of the group.\u201cYou\u2026 What the hell are you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry!\u201d Once more, I expressed my apology with an earnest expression to make me look more believable.Jung Yura looked confused. Of course, it was only natural for her to give this kind of expression. I had so suddenly given out an apology when it wasn\u2019t even warranted in the first place.As she slowly started to realize what I intended to do, Yura\u2019s face wrinkled.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAs expected, I can see Choi Young-ki and the rest of his party members approaching us. Even the people from the Magic Guild had shifted their attention to us. Of course, since other groups had turned to us, my party members and other members of Black Swan had now turned to face us as well.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Miss Yura.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cKiyoung? What is this about?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 No. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cYes, Yura is right. It\u2019s not a big deal, Choi Young-ki.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you, Yura. Mr. Kiyoung, can you explain what is going on?\u201dThankfully, Choi Young-ki, ever my adorable little defender, began to pry into the matter. Jung Hayan looked a little confused about what had happened, but as she slowly started to realize what kind of situation this looked like, her expression shifted into one of slight anger.\u2018Ah, even Sun Hee-young\u2026\u2019Sun Hee-young sported a similar, displeased expression. It was so easy to play the victim card, especially in such a situation where the difference in power was obvious.\u201cWhat happened, Mr. Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I was just told to stay on my guard and be careful.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIt seems like she doesn\u2019t like me socializing with the others during our breaks\u2026 She even said that I was hindering our group from progressing efficiently.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIn my own way, I intended to improve the atmosphere\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if it isn\u2019t working.\u201dThere was a certain truth in my words, and I had not lied. This was what Yura had told me, except that I could make it out as something worse with the right intonation and facial expressions.Jung Yura looked so mad at this point that it was very much laughable.Once I finished speaking, everyone sported absurd expressions.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dJust when I tried to apologize once again, a voice interjected from behind.\u201cThere is no need to apologize, Kiyoung.\u201dThis time, it was the lovely Kim Hyunsung who had stepped in.\u2018Hey, wait, is Kim Hyunsung actually angry\u2026?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKim Hyunsung\u2019s expression showed that he was definitely in a bad mood.\u201cThere is no need to apologize, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cY-Yeah?\u201d\u201cKiyoung did nothing wrong. No, even if he did something wrong, Miss Yura does not have the right to point out his fault.\u201d\u2018Ah, Hyunsung\u2026 You\u2019re doing such a great job.\u2019\u201cSeriously, Kiyoung is a Blue Guild party member. If he made a mistake, I would have told him first. I don\u2019t know why Miss Yura has a problem with our party member\u2019s behavior, but this just isn\u2019t right.\u201dI hadn\u2019t expected Kim Hyunsung to jump in. I was merely calculating how to best get the group\u2019s sympathy by pitching Yura against me. She had indeed made a mistake in approaching me so deftly.My affiliation lay with the Blue Guild. Therefore, Kim Hyunsung was responsible for me. Yura had no right to meddle in interparty affairs.From a passerby\u2019s point of view, Jung Yura might have done it in an attempt to expand her influence over the rest of her group members, but it appeared that Kim Hyunsung was having none of this treatment. For him, it was taboo to interfere with other party members too much.\u2018That simply means that Yura isn\u2019t giving us the respect we deserve.\u2019In a nutshell, Kim Hyunsung\u2019s defensive stance seemed to say, \u2018Who the hell are you, and why are you meddling with my charge?\u2019It had been a pleasurable turn of events to find Kim Hyunsung standing up for me, though in truth, I was expecting Choi Young-ki to do the defending. Hyunsung\u2019s protective stance made me feel even better.\u2018Very good, Hyunsung.\u2019Things were going very well at this point.Playing the role of the victim came as natural to me as breathing at this point.\u201cBoth Kim Hyunsung and Yura are speaking from the standpoint of seniors. She had a point, so I don\u2019t think she meant to offend anyone\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Kiyoung. No matter how wrong you must have behaved, she had no right to go about in this manner.\u201d\u201cI must have done something wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me be clear, Kiyoung. You did nothing wrong.\u201dI found it hard to keep myself from smiling. Aside from seeing the embarrassment on Jung Yura\u2019s face, I could tell that the rest of our group mates had started to disapprove of her. Slowly, her influence was lessening to the point of nonexistence.\u2018That\u2019s what you get for inciting me.\u2019At this point, the other group members had started to approach me to offer words of comfort.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Kiyoung is inexperienced yet, but Hyunsung is right. If you have anything to say directly to Mr. Kiyoung, it is correct to at least ask the party leader for his input. In that way, we can resolve the matter more efficiently.\u201d\u201cThis is not it. No matter how many faults you find in a person, you must still control yourself.\u201d\u201cBlue\u2019s party is said to be at a learning position because of their inexperience. However, they are trying their best to prove their worth. The Black Swan Guild\u2019s behavior is really hard to understand.\u201dThe Magic Guild members had started to talk about the Black Swan members\u2019 lack of manners.\u201cMr. Kiyoung did nothing wrong. Rather, I think he tried his best to create a good atmosphere. When the strategy was in progress, he actually worked hard to achieve our goal.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. In fact, it isn\u2019t easy to proceed with such an awkward atmosphere. Fighting and reproaching isn\u2019t the way to go.\u201d\u201cCommunication is important. Honestly, what is Yura doing?\u201d\u201cTch\u2026\u201dEven the Red Mercenary members who normally didn\u2019t fall prey to their emotions had started to speak.\u201cYura, isn\u2019t it a little bit harsh to do this? As a party that was assigned to go on an expedition altogether, it\u2019s best that we stay on good terms with each other.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dDirect accusations pierced through Jung Yura like sharpened arrows.As I said, she had picked the wrong person to pick a fight with. With just one incitement, her carefully-built image had been shattered.\u201cOppa\u2026 Are you hurt?\u201d\u201cHuh. I\u2019m okay, Hayan. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly happened to you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, Sun Hee-young. Please don\u2019t worry.\u201dIt might have been more effective if Jung Yura had hit me even once, but I knew that she wouldn\u2019t be that careless.Anyway, it was only right that I had emerged from the situation unscathed. If I hadn\u2019t, Jung Hayan would probably busy planning an assassination attempt for Jung Yura. The situation had already turned out to be as good as it could get. Yura was getting all the blame, while I was getting all the comfort.Honestly, I was curious about what kind of reaction she would make, but the safest direction she could choose had already been decided for her.\u2018Admit the wrong and fall flat.\u2019Although this was indeed the best option, it didn\u2019t mean that she would get good results. She would earn forgiveness, but by bowing her head in submission, she would lose her influence.She had to look at least like she was still looking out for the expedition, so this was the only right course of action to take. Simply put, she needed to stay in the middle position of this situation.Yura seemed to be thinking of the same tactic.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe was apologizing, but it was apparent that she was trying hard not to show her anger.\u2018What a stupid bitch.\u2019\u201cKiyoung is a member of my party and, by default, is under my jurisdiction.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not being able to tell you in advance, Mr. Hyunsung. And I apologize to Mr. Kiyoung, who I must\u2019ve hurt by suddenly reproaching.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I was a little too insensitive. But I thought I had to say something. I thought he was not being alert enough. If it\u2019s an expedition consisting of a normal party, you don\u2019t have to worry about this, but\u2026\u201d\u2018Ah, she\u2019s still being an idiot.\u2019\u201cAs a senior with experience, I thought I had to say something. Of course, I am fully aware that my choice of execution was wrong.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why Jung Yura has been thinking about correcting his discipline. Of course, we made a mistake in the beginning, but we\u2019ve more than made up for it and haven\u2019t blundered again.\u201dKim Hyunsung was dealing with this way more efficiently than I thought.In a nutshell, we had managed to make Jung Yura sound like a petty senior who looked down on us and refused to let us go after we made a single mistake. However, at least she still had the decency to feel sorry for what she did.Unsurprisingly, voices burst from the other Black Swan members.\u201cA lot of our tankers have been continually looking out for Blue. If it weren\u2019t for that, our burdens should have been reduced.\u201d\u201cAnd what of the kid archer? It was dangerous bringing her in.\u201d\u201cAnd they even got a non-combat member, an alchemist, to join the party!\u201dNaturally, opposing opinions would also eventually pop up during this dispute.\u201cWhile that is true, we can\u2019t say that they have been hindering us. In fact, there are many enemies eradicated by Miss Hayan, and Miss Sun Hee-young has helped us a lot of times.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Because of this, we have no right to judge them for doing their best to help.\u201dThe situation wasn\u2019t even that controversial, yet the discussion was starting to get heated. I would have hated to be in Jung Yura\u2019s shoes at this point.I contemplated my next reply when Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face, a little hardened, came into view.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Even if Kim Hyunsung was the reincarnation of Buddha, it was only right for him to feel angry. Hyunsung might not be familiar with political tactics, but he knew when our party was being criticized.\u201cI hope this will not happen next time. If you have anything to say to our party, you can do it directly through me.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Hyunsung. And I\u2019m very sorry for the Blue party members who might have struggled. I\u2019m particularly sorry for Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be\u2026 I was just a little embarrassed.\u201d\u201cI was also surprised. I didn\u2019t know you would get hurt by what I said\u2026 Let\u2019s talk separately later.\u201d\u201cDo not worry about it. It\u2019s all good.\u201dAlthough we had finally resolved the dispute, Jung Yura had lost her influence. The moment she lost the group\u2019s approval was when she lost the fight; she had decided to pick with me.In other words, she made it seem like she was forcing herself to be a villain for the safety of the expedition, but she wasn\u2019t doing a very good job with the execution.\u2018Ah, but I won\u2019t let her find an opportunity to win.\u2019Outwardly, Yura seemed relaxed, but I knew she was secretly relieved to have escaped a checkmate position. It should have ended here, but Kim Hyunsung seemed to have a different opinion about it altogether.\u201cWould everyone please gather for a minute?\u201d\u201cYes, sure.\u201dAs if they noticed that he still had something to say, the others crowded around. Kim Hyunsung looked at all of them before speaking.\u201cI sincerely apologize for hindering you all with our inexperience.\u201d\u201cNo, no, you shouldn\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, I have to. I insisted that we come along for the experience, but I hadn\u2019t expected my dear Kiyoung to be disregarded like this.\u201d\u2018I wasn\u2019t being disregarded\u2026\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t think this was a waste. Your party has learned a lot of things in this expedition.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, this will not happen ever again.\u201dI knew Kim Hyunsung was a responsible type of guy. Seeing him biting firmly on his lips, I felt like an idea had just come into his mind.\u201cI will change the location a bit. I will stand a little more avant-garde. Mr. Deokgu can continue as he has done. The timing to use magic will also be different from here on out. Miss Hee-young, please focus a little more on Deokgu. You are free to think that your other party members do not exist. Ye-ri shall continue on as usual.\u201d\u201cYes, okay.\u201d\u201cJung Hayan, you should increase your magic power a little more. Hee-young can keep watching over Deok-gu.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s leadership charisma was the reason why he commanded respect. Even I felt a little in awe watching him.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Only then did I realize what he had been thinking. We had not been on the frontlines up until now. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but I could think of several reasons.Our party was attracting everyone\u2019s attention, and in fact, our urgency to gain experience was being hindered due to the continued comfort of this spotlight effect.\u2018Thank you for getting us back on track.\u2019It looked like I wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted to prove Jung Yura wrong. Kim Hyunsung looked very much passionate at this point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe she\u2019s too obsessed with achievements\u2026 Those under her command will also end up suffering a lot.\u201d\u201cIf you say so\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much. No one thinks of you badly, Kiyoung. There were a lot of rumors about Jung Yura\u2019s personality within the Magic Guild.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate. I was worried that I was really hindering everyone\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no. wherever you go, there will always be people who will try to stir up trouble. The most important thing you should take note of in an expedition is your humanity. I thought she would at least have some basic manners\u2026 It seems that there will be no collaboration with the Black Swan for the foreseeable future. Especially with Jung Yura, that woman.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for our Red Mercenaries.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand at all\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because Kiyoung is well-liked by people. Anyway, it\u2019s not right to meddle too much in other people\u2019s affairs. At least show some basic respect. Even if it annoys you, you must bring it up to the expedition leader. Forgive me for saying this, but if the Blue Guild\u2019s prestige was like how it was before, the Black Swans wouldn\u2019t dare do this.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what exactly did she say?\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can tell you\u2026\u201d\u201cI would like you to speak without worries.\u201dOf course, I found no reason to hide this. It worked in my favor, after all.\u201cThat\u2026 She told me not to fraternize with the rest of you.\u201d\u201cWhoa, really? What else did she say?\u201d\u201cS-She said she didn\u2019t know if I came to explore the dungeon or to socialize. She said I just wanted to become friends with the guilds and that I wasn\u2019t being vigilant enough.\u201d\u201cFriendship, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can tell you what she said afterwards, too.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. You\u2019re free to say it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 she said she doubted if the Mercenary Queen can protect me here too.\u201d\u201cWhat a mad bitch.\u201dI thought Choi Young-ki would exhibit a violent reaction, but it seemed that he only felt uncomfortable.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cListen. She\u2019s just being crazy. Does she really think we\u2019d let anyone who tries to hurt you get away? How cocky she is! You don\u2019t have to worry, Mr. Kiyoung. If a woman like that beggar ever tries to stir up trouble with you or with the expedition\u2026 Well, I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\u201cDo you still feel threatened? Do you want to start a formal protest?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. I don\u2019t want to make things bigger than they already are.\u201d\u201cTsk. I just feel like she\u2019s prejudiced against you. A lot of people are like that, especially among the veterans. People like her disgust me.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dThroughout this whole ordeal, I made sure to look as if I was still shaken up. However, things were already working in my favor. The atmosphere had shifted.This was the kind of situation that Jung Yura had imposed upon herself for inciting me. With a single mistake, her influence over the guild had crumbled.Even a veteran like her must know that snooping around so straightforwardly would come with serious repercussions. Everyone had a negative opinion of her now because she had stated that making friends was a bad thing. At this point, even if she tried to cozy up to the others, she would not regain her influential position.\u2018That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to act your best at all times.\u2019No matter how much she struggled, I doubted any other parties would show her any sympathy. Especially not from the Red Mercenary Guild! After she doubted Cha Hee-ra\u2019s power, their opinion of her had permanently crumbled.However, I knew Choi Young-ki\u2019s leadership would suffer because of this. It would be hard to maintain formation if the atmosphere wasn\u2019t a friendly one.\u201cNow, then, let\u2019s start again.\u201d\u201cYes, sure.\u201dIn summary, Jung Yura\u2019s influential hold over the group had disappeared. I knew Kim Hyunsung wouldn\u2019t let her try to boss anyone around ever again. His ominous demeanor hinted that he wasn\u2019t at all interested in letting her doubt his authority over again.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go and take my position now.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dBecause of the sudden turn of events, there was a strange type of pressure in the atmosphere. Everyone had started to put their full concentration on the expedition. I could guess that this was because of Kim Hyunsung\u2019s somber mood.I knew Kim Hyunsung had the quality to be a leader everywhere he went.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be nervous, Deokgu. Just focus as much as possible.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cYe-ri, don\u2019t hit anywhere else. Focus on the area where our melee lacks in range, got it? It would be better to load the magic power in advance.\u201d\u201cYes, noted.\u201d\u201cMiss Hayan and Mr. Kiyoung are both doing well.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cEven if Hee-young won\u2019t look at me\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Hyunsung. I know my role.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dThe party members were also exuding enthusiasm. At this point, I wanted the monsters to appear as soon as possible. I just wanted us to get to the next safe point.Despite it being called a Garden, it resembled a huge, jungle-like environment. As it was difficult to distinguish which one is a plant and which one is a monster, it was only natural that we would be more careful.While I tried to assess our situation, Kim Hyunsung spoke from behind me.\u201cKiyoung?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201dI did not bother to ask why I should incite a spell right away. I trusted Hyunsung. Jung Hayan nodded as well and began to match her magic to sync with mine.\u201cLord\u2026\u201d\u201cGrant us the power that cannot be taken away\u2026\u201d\u201cThe strength to keep\u2026\u201d\u201cMagic power\u2026\u201d\u201cAs strong as wind\u2026\u201dThe combination of our voice resonated within the area, the urgency of our spells intensifying the already pressuring atmosphere. One look at Jung Hayan revealed that she enjoyed the fact that we were combining enchantments to create more powerful spells together. I had to admit this also felt fun to me. Together, slowly, we were building up a tower of magic.\u201cPrepare for battle!\u201d Choi Young-ki announced.I could see why they had ordered us to prepare spells so early. The monster we were now facing was a larger creature than the ones we had already stumbled across, and it looked even more dangerous than them. It was frantically approaching our group.However, I believed in our group\u2019s leaders. We would win this.It was then that Kim Hyunsung ran forward.\u201cW-What are you doing?!\u201d I heard Jung Yura\u2019s startled voice ringing after him as he lunged himself forward without any warning.That only meant one thing \u2013 the monster had singled Park Deokgu out as its sole target.Following Hyunsung\u2019s advice, Sun Hee-young\u2019s divine magic poured entirely onto Park Deokgu. Before one of the monster\u2019s tendril-like arms could reach Park Deokgu, it had already been severed.It was obvious as to who had inflicted the first hit.Also following Kim Hyunsung\u2019s orders was Kim Ye-ri, who was already readying her next arrow. Meanwhile, the monster had already recovered from its initial shock and howled in both anger and pain. Park Deokgu looked embarrassed to have all the attention on him, but he still readied himself to block the next attack, moving to the right as if by instinct. It seemed that Kim Hyunsung had already warned him.In the next moment, Kim Hyunsung had already split through the monster\u2019s torso. I stiffened, and so did Jung Hayan. Everyone else had done their part; it was up to us now.\u201cCast it!\u201d\u201cFlame!\u201d\u201cStorm!\u201dJung Hayan and I released the incantations we had been holding in at the same time.The spell we had created was a collaboration of magic power and alchemy. It increased the power of the fire spell Jung Hayan, and I created, except that it relied more on Jung Hayan\u2019s magical capacity than mine, thus making it stronger.The flames storm flew towards the monster and trapped it in a fiery spiral, eventually swallowing the screaming monster and turning it into ashes. Park Deokgu would have also gotten hurt from the spell\u2019s range, but since Sun Hee-young had marked him, he remained unhurt.\u201cWho\u2019s next?!\u201d\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019I felt quite surprised. It wasn\u2019t long ago that I had observed our lack of teamwork. The earlier incident must have incited Kim Hyunsung to act as our leader even when on the offense, and it felt right that he was the one leading us. Everyone had followed his orders to the letter and thus defeated the monster in one efficient combo.This wasn\u2019t just following orders, either. It was like we knew when one\u2019s role would start and end, and when the next role would begin.However, we weren\u2019t given the time to ponder over these changes. The next monster had come, but we were all in the perfect mindset and stance to take it on once more.This was the first time I felt that we were doing hunting right.For our part in the rear, it was easy. All Jung Hayan and I had to do was memorize, chant, and aim the spells at the monsters when they were properly weakened or distracted. Of course, this was made easy because their attack patterns were easy to memorize, but something felt off.I couldn\u2019t believe that monsters of this size and power would fall from just one concentrated combo. The other parties were also focusing on their charges, but it was apparent that they felt surprised by our party\u2019s sudden change.Jung Yura, in particular, looked astonished.She had been keeping a close eye on us, ready to admonish in the case of a mistake, but there were none \u2013 even when we kept up our stream of offensive combos.\u2018This actually feels fun\u2026\u2019It felt like I didn\u2019t even need to exert any effort in this part of the expedition \u2013 my fellow party members were doing all the work for me. All I had to do was sit back and relax from a safe distance, all while riding on the team\u2019s bus.\u201cAgain! Who\u2019s next!?\u201d\u2018Ah, I wonder how long it\u2019ll be before I get tired of this ride\u2026\u2019Slowly, it felt like I was growing stronger from this expedition.I wouldn\u2019t even call this a bus ride carrying me towards potential growth. A luxury sedan would be a more fitting description.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe other parties\u2019 shock lasted for a longer time than I expected. Of course, I knew this was only natural. Kim Hyunsung had been quiet all this time, and now he was surprisingly showing off his leadership skills. He was proving that being a leader wasn\u2019t all about having high stats.However, it could very well be that as well. Currently, Kim Hyunsung was showing a flurry of skills that were well over his current stats.Watching him, and then observing Choi Young-ki and the others, I knew what they were all thinking.\u2018He\u2019s a monster.\u2019\u2018What a genius\u2026\u2019Their thoughts were all written on their faces.Of course, it wasn\u2019t just Kim Hyunsung who was racking up all the attention. Jung Hayan and I were also getting our fair share from the magic power we were exhibiting.The truth was that my alchemy relied heavily on Jung Hayan\u2019s magic capacity to let out spells that were as intense as hers. Still, these people didn\u2019t know anything about alchemy and were unaware of my secret, so they must have thought that I was doing spectacularly alone.Added with Park Deokgu\u2019s determined defensive prowess, Kim Ye-ri\u2019s crazy accurate aim, and Sun Hee-young\u2019s clear and effective spells, we looked like the perfect team.This expedition suddenly felt fun. I knew Kim Hyunsung\u2019s secret \u2013 that he was a regressor \u2013 so he probably secretly had ample knowledge of dungeons. It was great to have him lead the party.\u2018This feels different.\u2019Indeed, we felt more confident now. We were working efficiently with each other almost as if on instinct. Even Jung Yura\u2019s expression showed hostile confusion as she continued to watch us silently.\u2018Ha.\u2019I knew she planned to show herself off as the necessary villain that would, in turn, improve the expedition\u2019s results. She meant to show everyone that continually pushing us in a tough manner would be the key to our success.However, I had thwarted those plans as early as now. Our team had also successfully shown everyone that we didn\u2019t need much coaxing to be the perfect, functioning team. In the end, Yura only succeeded in destroying her influential position over the group.Just the thought of her ruined plans made me smile.\u201cNext!\u201dWe continued to defeat monster after monster with efficient teamwork, and soon, there came the inevitable point where all our opponents were on the floor, either slashed or decimated. A strange silence hung over the group.Looking back at our comrades, we found them staring at Kim Hyunsung with skeptical expressions, finding what had just happened hard to believe. It was Choi Young-ki who spoke first.\u201cAh, it looks like we\u2019ve witnessed a real genius.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an exaggeration. I was just trying to imitate you.\u201d\u201cHaha, I don\u2019t think so. You went past just imitating me, you did even better. I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting this level of talent from you, or from Kiyoung and the others for that matter.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cYour party has improved greatly ever since entering the dungeon. I won\u2019t lie \u2013 when the Blue Guild paid such a high price for you, I really thought it was too much. However, seeing you all in action, I feel like their pricing was justified. It won\u2019t take long before Blue Guild reclaims its glory through all of you.\u201d\u201cI feel embarrassed to hear that, now.\u201d\u201cHahaha. If it does happen later, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t tell you!\u201dI did like Choi Young-ki\u2019s easygoing nature. I took a mental note to help him out in the future if the opportunity presented itself.Even Park Deokgu and Kim Ye-ri, who at first received criticism, were now the center of positive attention as they had executed their roles so flawlessly.Meanwhile, I searched through the monsters\u2019 corpses to see if anything could be of use. Unfortunately, there was none. I then turned to assess the scene once more. In this pleasant atmosphere, only Jung Yura looked bad.\u2018So what will her next choice of action be?\u2019From what I could see, she had two options. She would either stick to her initial \u2018villainous for everyone\u2019s betterment\u2019 attitude or start striving for a good relationship with everyone.Of course, if she were to stick to the former, certain conditions would need to be met.She would need to be thick-faced enough to admit to her earlier statements, yet she also needed just the right amount of bashfulness to prove that she was doing this because she thought it was the best course of action to take. This may seem easy, but in actuality, it was not. This was especially true for someone who had such a position as Jung Yura.This was the case for entrepreneurs and politicians who worked for self-benefit under the premise of serving the people.I had to act as I respected her, but in reality, I didn\u2019t. People like her did not know the importance of self-esteem and would gladly trade it if it meant getting away from dire situations.The decision was up to her now. Would she prove herself to be a first-class or second-class type of person? Would she prove to be smart for once, or would she stubbornly stick to her ineffective tactics?\u2018Come on, Jung Yura. Reveal yourself.\u2019She donned a complex expression.\u2018Are you first-class or second-class?\u2019When her expression shifted into one of determination, I had my answer. She still stuck to being second-class.\u2018Ah, still sticking to such tactics, I see.\u2019Was she still going to try to pick a fight when she knew she wouldn\u2019t win?\u201cWatching you all was amazing, but I have to say, that really threw me off.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf you suddenly had a change in plans, wouldn\u2019t it be sound to inform us first? What if your new plan threw us off-course and accidentally ruined our formation? It would be detrimental for everybody.\u201d\u201cJung Yura, now\u2026\u201d\u201cAre I wrong? We got thrown off because of Mr. Hyunsung. I know some of you agree with me.\u201d\u201cI admit that it was a little startling, but Kim Hyunsung\u2019s sudden movement actually helped us defeat the monsters more efficiently. I\u2019m starting to wonder about how intense their training in Blue Guild actually is.\u201d\u201cOf course, I am not saying that he hasn\u2019t helped us. However, he should have warned us beforehand. If he was really so capable, couldn\u2019t he have done that from the very beginning?\u201dThis woman really was relentless.\u201cI first wanted to see if my party members would be able to adjust accordingly, especially in the case of Park Deokgu and Kim Ye-ri. When I knew we were capable enough, we shifted. I apologize for not issuing a warning in advance.\u201d\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t mean to incite an apology from you, Mr. Hyunsung.\u201dKim Hyunsung showed politeness amidst the subtle accusations directed at him and knew he couldn\u2019t refute Jung Yura. The woman had a point, after all. It was true that Kim Hyunsung had moved unexpectedly and had utterly surprised Jung Yura.However, thanks to previous circumstances, our group had fallen entirely in our favor.\u201cI think you\u2019re being a little too harsh, Miss Yura.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is because of jealousy or whatever, but I believe praise is supposed to be given when it\u2019s due, and Kim Hyunsung has shown praiseworthy talent.\u201d\u201cI thought we were already over this. It\u2019s not Kim Hyunsung who needs to wake up, but you, Jung Yura.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t vouch for the others, but it\u2019s so tiring hearing you criticize people every time.\u201d\u201cI was doing it for the sake of the expedition!\u201d\u201cIn what way are you helping? If you really want to help, then lead your party efficiently!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dIt appeared that Choi Young-ki had had enough. Looking at Yura\u2019s reddened expression, I knew her influence had reached an all-time low of zero. Even if her fellow Black Swans attempted to save her now, it would all be in vain. No one wanted to go against a Red Mercenary outright.The intensity of the situation made me want to fan the flames even more. What better, alternative way to diffuse the situation and turn it into our favor by acting as the victim one last time?First of all, I needed Kim Hyunsung\u2019s permission for this.It appeared that I didn\u2019t even need to get his attention. Kim Hyunsung was already looking in my direction, apparently sensing that I harbored new intentions.\u2018Can I please speak up?\u2019 My expression said. \u2018I\u2019m good at this sort of thing, Hyung.\u2019The moment Kim Hyunsung nodded, I began to speak.\u201cAm I allowed to say something?\u201dUpon hearing me, several pairs of eyes turned to me.\u201cYes, of course.\u201dIt would be fun to provoke Jung Yura, if only for the last time.\u201cI would like to apologize. It seems that Hyunsung\u2019s efforts in proving our worth backfired on us\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201d\u201cI express my sincere apology towards the Black Swans, and to Jung Yura in particular.\u201d I made sure to keep my acting on point.\u201cActually, we\u2019ve already talked about this beforehand. Our party joined this expedition simply to gain experience, but we know our stats must have annoyed you. This is why we thought it prudent to adjust first before showing our true potentials.\u201d\u201cNo, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cNo, an apology is in order. We tried our best, but it still seems insufficient, seeing as Jung Yura seems unsatisfied with our performance. We will do even better next time. Assessing our teamwork earlier, I think I know what went wrong. Please give us the chance to fix ourselves.\u201dJung Yura\u2019s expression now revealed her increasing anxiety. She knew I had the talent to point fingers effortlessly, so why did she still go down this route?After pausing to catch my breath, I began to speak again, making eye contact with every sheepish expression I saw within the group.\u201cIt looks like all we\u2019ve been doing is cause trouble for everyone.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt seems that our party is the one causing uneasiness within the group.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cWe knew you would be unhappy to be stuck with having us in the team, but we never thought that you would feel uncomfortable as well. For this, we sincerely apologize.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that maintaining the atmosphere within a group is crucial for a successful expedition so we tried our best to fit in, but it seems like we\u2019ve been trash at doing it after all. We apologize for any inconveniences we have caused you.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s definitely not like that!\u201dSlowly, embarrassed voices began to respond to my words, offering comforting remarks coupled with sheepish expressions. I wanted to say more, but looking at Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expectant face, I knew it was time to pass the microphone to him.\u201cI think our Blue Party is wrong, here.\u201dI tried my best not to smile. It was amazing how Kim Hyunsung could read my mind. At his words, the atmosphere within the group shifted even more.\u201cNo, the Blue Guild has done nothing wrong. In fact, it is the opposing side who keeps trying to put you in a negative light\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not to blame. Someone else has caused trouble\u2026\u201dThe group I had used as my shield transitioned into a spear that began attacking the Black Swans. And all this was possible because we had successfully manipulated Choi Young-ki\u2019s thinking, as well as his emotions.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t help. In fact, you actually contributed a lot and helped us get rid of the monsters at a faster and more efficient manner. The only problem here,\u201d Young-ki\u2019s expression darkened, \u201cis the opposing side.\u201d\u2018Ah, here it comes.\u2019\u201cJung Yura.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that we\u2019ve come to this point. However, I feel like now is the right time to make something clear to you.\u201d\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d\u201cI believe now is the right time to inform you I plan to make changes with the agreement of this expedition.\u201d\u201cW-What? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cI would like to formally suggest that you leave the expedition.\u201dThis was the moment when my plans were completed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Choi Young-ki had spoken so suddenly that they did not know how to react.I resisted the urge to smile. Didn\u2019t Jung Yura know I was the best when it came to political tactics? And she tried to best me in my own game.The atmosphere had suddenly taken on a dangerously quiet turn.\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDid he think Choi Young-ki would joke about something like this?Jung Yura, who had silently been gazing at Young-ki to confirm her worst suspicions, grew mad and began to speak as well.\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\u201cNo. This is a reasonable judgment from the standpoint of someone leading this expedition.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201d\u201cI can see what your intentions are, Jung Yura. I also know what you have contributed so far. I also know that you were more dedicated than anyone else for this expedition. However, it seems too difficult for the entire group to work together with you anymore.\u201d\u201cHow could you have come to this decision?!\u201d\u201cIt was an unavoidable choice. I thought it unreasonable to proceed with the expedition in this atmosphere. I don\u2019t know what Yura-san thinks of the Blue party, but what you\u2019re showing is quite illogical and harsh.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only spoken for the sake of the expedition. I don\u2019t hold any grudges against Blue!\u201dI wanted to point out how she had treated me, but Jung Yura looked so angry at this point that I decided it was best to stay quiet. Her expression revealed that she was hurling every curse word she could think of towards Choi Young-ki.For Choi Young-ki\u2019s sake, I opened my mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Choi Young-ki. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u201cNo, Mr. Kiyoung. This would be better. Party members who stir up trouble will one day lead us to major accidents. No, I\u2019m sure something will happen if they continue to stay.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m the one causing the commotion?\u201d\u201cYes. I will not tell you exactly how. There will be something for you to find out and remember.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Yura\u2019s actions have already exceeded our level of understanding. You have been here for a long time and should respect my decision. Even if you feel that your actions are reasonable, the others here have begun to feel uncomfortable because of you. I advise you to think this through.\u201d\u201cHow ridiculous! Who do you think you are?\u201dIt seemed that Jung Yura was still ignoring where she stood in this group. The fact that she decided to employ political tactics to take me down was now laughable.This woman was incompetent. I could say that for sure now. Regardless of hunting skills or specs, she was not suitable to be a leader, even more so when one considered her narrow mindset.Currently, Jung Yura was looking at both Young-ki and me with an expression full of hatred.However, we both had ample reason not to be afraid. Our protector came in the name of the Legendary Red Queen Cha Hee-ra.\u201cNow it makes sense, Mr. Choi Young-ki.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand what you mean.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to be fair since the start, and yet you keep trying to put me down. Was this your plan from the beginning?\u201d\u2018Whoa, now she\u2019s going down this route?\u2019\u201cDid you get anything from the Mercenary Queen? Is this why you\u2019re acting this way? From the beginning, did you intend to sabotage the Black Swans? How ridiculous. You\u2019re pretending to be a good leader while babying Lee Kiyoung secretly. You know Cha Hee-ra would have done the same.\u201d\u201cYura, aren\u2019t you being harsh? Cha Hee-ra has nothing to do with this.\u201d\u201cShut up, you bastard.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so upset\u2026 You\u2019re saying things without thinking of them properly.\u201dI gave the impression of wanting to exit this unpleasant scenario as soon as possible. However, in truth, I was rubbing salt to her wounds through my pitiful expressions to stir the group some more, but it seemed that Jung Yura had had enough.\u201cHah. This whole thing is rigged. The Mercenary Queen must have bribed you with an item, and then let you wreak havoc in this expedition. Do you think that guild expeditions are a joke? If so, I should have joined the Blue Guild or the Red Mercenaries instead.\u201d\u201cYura.\u201dThe more Jung Yura talked, the more she was destroying her image. I could feel Jung Hayan shifting uncomfortably, as Cha Hee-ra\u2019s name had been mentioned so many times.I knew this was now ample time to shut my mouth. Everyone already felt embarrassed enough with Yura\u2019s antics. Choi Young-ki appeared to be trying to hold back his anger.\u201cUnnie, please\u2026\u201d\u201cStop, unnie!\u201d\u201cLet me go, they\u2019re being crazy bitches! I don\u2019t know how great the Red Mercenary is, but if our guild finds out about this, do you think they\u2019ll let this pass? Blue and Red are repressing our guild! This is unfair! I want to formally protest!\u201dBang!Jung Yura\u2019s expression shifted into one of shock, relapsing into silence as Choi Young-ki slammed his fist into the stone wall right next to her. Pure anger was on his quivering face.Come to think of it\u2026\u2018Did Yura really just say that Young-ki was only powerful because of Cha Hee-ra?\u2019I knew how much Choi Young-ki revered Cha Hee-ra, so hearing Yura criticize her probably wasn\u2019t the best choice of action to take.Jung Yura had probably felt so excited that she\u2019d ended up taking her words too far. I\u2019d thought she was a formidable opponent, but it turned out she was just stupid. It wasn\u2019t just Choi Young-ki but also the rest of the Red Mercenary members who were trying to rein in their anger at this point.If I were in Yura\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d be shaking right about now. Choi Young-ki had begun to exhibit malicious intentions, which were now pouring towards Jung Yura.However, as soon as Kim Hyunsung reached out to Young-ki in an attempt to calm him down, the man snapped out of it.\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201dI could understand Young-ki\u2019s anger, for the person he had revered so much had just been so blatantly insulted. However, I still wanted to praise him for not finishing her off right then and there.If it weren\u2019t for Park Deokgu\u2019s blundering from the start, I would have never thought of bringing Young-ki to our side. The fact that the man could control himself even though he seemed so angry was evidence that he was a competent person.Jung Yura was both confused and scared upon feeling the intense pressure from Young-ki\u2019s anger and had begun to rethink her words. Considering her stats, she might be able to resist this energy, but it was clear that the difference between their powers was substantial.\u2018It\u2019s good that she\u2019s aware.\u2019If she dared to say anything further, I knew Young-ki would end up exploding.\u201cAre you finished talking?\u201d He asked her quietly.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cI want you to leave right now.\u201d\u201cForgive me, I\u2019ve spoken out of turn. I just felt too pumped too-\u201c\u201cI told you to leave right now. I don\u2019t want to hear anything anymore. As I mentioned earlier, you will get your share separately.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dBang! Young-ki had slammed his fist once more.\u201cI-I understand.\u201d\u2018Finally.\u2019Though scary, I also found this situation extremely pleasing. I couldn\u2019t help but smile, making sure that no one would be able to see it.\u201cI want you to leave the dungeon right now, Miss Yura. I also think it would be beneficial for the Magic Guild.\u201dEven the party leaders from behind me had begun to team up with Young-ki, the winning side.I had to admire the Red Mercenary leader. He didn\u2019t just know how to throw stones at the tormented; he also knew how to burn her at the stakes. This was a fitting description considering how much of a witch Yura had been acting this entire time.Now Jung Yura had started to regret her actions. Her breathing had become shallow, her body had begun trembling, and tears had started to fall out of her eyes.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019There was a long silence. Eventually, after a few more moments, Jung Yura began to walk away, taking the path that we had already cleared.However, when she passed by me, she shot me a look filled with pure hatred and malice, going so far as to bump into me roughly with her shoulder. It took everything in me not to stumble backward.\u2018Gosh\u2026\u2019Of course, I didn\u2019t feel scared at all.Assessing her personality, I knew I could easily beat her with just wits. However, I also knew that I shouldn\u2019t make a person\u2019s hatred so lightly, especially when someone had a higher stat range than I did.At the same time that I knew this, I also knew that there was a high chance I wouldn\u2019t even see her anymore after this. People like Yura did not fall because of their lack of stats; they fell because of their stupidity. One wrong move could get you killed in this world, but it seemed like she did not know that yet.It was a wrong move on her part to try to battle me through political tactics. She had been utterly defeated.\u2018I hope she learns not to mess with the wrong people.\u2019After watching her go, followed by her lackeys, Choi Young-ki turned to the rest of the group.\u201cSo, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201d\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience or discomfort I must have caused you.\u201d\u201cNo, no, we completely understand.\u201dThe group responded to him immediately, feeling Young-ki\u2019s authority now more than ever.\u2018And you thought you could defeat me, bitch.\u2019I was sorry, it seems I was a little more capable than Jung Yura thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The number of people [18/30] has been checked.]A very pleasant voice echoed in my ears. It wasn\u2019t just me who thought the same. There was a sense of accomplishment engraved on everyone\u2019s face.I then turned towards Choi Young-ki, who had been standing next to me. I knew I had to keep my tone level. For these veterans, this was just a normal, successful expedition.\u201cIs this how most normal rare grade dungeons are?\u201d\u201cYeah. It gets a bit monotonous once you get used to it. If you defeat enough monsters and boss monsters, the attack will be considered complete. I heard that there are various conditions in completing hero-grade dungeons and legendary-grade dungeons as well\u2026 It\u2019s embarrassing, but in fact, I haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIn fact, it is said that there has only been one legendary-grade dungeon found in the entire Holy Empire.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Does that mean there are more hero-level dungeons to be found?\u201d\u201cActually, even hero-grade dungeons are not very common. This Garden of Terror that we just attacked also seems to be a lower level among the rarest grades, but for other dungeons, the composition may be slightly different.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m really sorry for letting you feel so much discomfort during your first time.\u201d\u201cNo, no, we are the ones to blame,\u201d I responded awkwardly as Choi Young-ki bowed towards me to show his sincere regret. I felt a pang in my chest for manipulating such a genuine person, so I could only smile at him reassuringly and deny him of his fault.\u201cThanks to you, we were able to experience firsthand what it\u2019s like to explore a dungeon. You have also inspired us to do better during the fights.\u201d\u201cOh, no, you did quite well on your own. It\u2019s not only the Red Mercenaries, but also the Magic Guild people who think so. I\u2019m rather regretful that I didn\u2019t get to show off too much.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dAs I glanced sidewards, I could also see Kim Hyunsung chatting with the Magic Guild people. Perhaps he was also having the same pleasant conversation as I was. I hoped so.Because our repressor \u2013 Jung Yura \u2013 was nowhere to be found, I knew sooner or later the atmosphere would become warmer and friendlier. We would have survived even if she had been present the whole time; the pressure just felt less intense when she left. There had been no shortage of laughter in her absence.The biggest obstacle in forming our unity was indeed Yura, but with the Black Swans\u2019 exit, the Red Mercenaries\u2019 responsibilities doubled. Rather, they had to serve as the main tankers, for both the Magic and Blue Guild parties did not possess an aptitude for durability.However, this wasn\u2019t exactly a bad thing. In this way, the Red Mercenary vanguards had doubled their efforts, and the priests from every party were able to train their potentials even more as they focused on protecting the tankers.In conclusion, the Black Swans weren\u2019t a crucial team to have on the roster. They were more like a backup in case anything happened. If they stayed, I doubted they would receive more contribution rewards than the Blue Guild would.Through a logical assessment, they should be happy they were cast out in the middle of the expedition. They didn\u2019t have to exert any effort, yet they would still receive rewards from the dungeon.\u201cBy the way, are you really sure about this?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cDo you still think we should give the rewards to the Black Swans?\u201d\u201cAhhh. Yes. You don\u2019t have to worry. Besides, Hyunsung also said that it is better to keep the settlement ratio as it is.\u201d\u201cEven so, I think it\u2019s right to give a little more to Blue. You all played such a crucial role\u2026\u201d\u201cThe shield that Deokgu received is enough. In fact, I still feel that I am taking too much, which feels very embarrassing.\u201d Upon saying this, my eyes immediately sought a happy Park Deokgu out, surrounded by the other tankers who all bore cheerful spirits.Who would blame him for being happy? He had just received a rare-grade shield item that would surely benefit his class. It was the most valuable weapon our party had received from this expedition.[Root Shield-Rare Grade][This is a hard shield made from plant roots by Araki, the owner of the garden. Originally, it was a shield to equip the garden guards, but all humans in the garden were cursed and could not see the light. As well as increasing defense, it relieves external shocks. Durability can be restored by itself.][Health +3][Durability +2][Magic Power +1]\u2018It looks like a reliable shield.\u2019I particularly liked the fact that the shield could fix its durability. It seemed like the perfect beginner\u2019s item for Park Deokgu, and we had gotten it at such a low cost! Since Deokgu\u2019s potential was quite high, I knew he would also start gaining momentum with his growth.Originally, that shield was also an item that had to go through several processes to obtain, but all the veterans indicated that it was okay to give it to him. Park Deokgu had probably managed to affect them emotionally, thus allowing him such a big reward.Besides, there were several other good items to be obtained.In the first place, the Garden of Terror was a human-made laboratory, and its setting was that everyone turned into monsters under the curse of God. There were many things worth researching about magical power\u2019s essence, and it was full of things that were of great value.It was the moment when I realized what it meant to make money from a dungeon attack.The Red Mercenary and Magic Guild members insisted that we take more than what was initially agreed upon, but Kim Hyunsung was firm about the matter and did not take any more than what we were supposed to take.From Kim Hyunsung\u2019s point of view, the rest of the rewards weren\u2019t necessary. I knew it was also a way to create good relations with the other guilds, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed.The next problem to focus on was what and how many rewards the Black Swans would receive, seeing as exiled halfway through the expedition.\u201cTo be honest, their rewards seem a little too much from my point of view. I think it\u2019s better if the Blue Guild takes a bit of their rewards. We won\u2019t let them protest against you, of course!\u201d\u201cNo, no. After everything has been said and done, Jung Yura did have a point. We blundered right at the beginning and did cause additional burdens for everyone. They deserve their rewards.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be natural for me to feel angry if I was a veteran as well. Besides, I know they must\u2019ve been crushed to be cast out halfway. What better way to console them than with their contribution rewards in full?\u201d\u201cHahaha, I suddenly feel ashamed for making such a proposal. I honestly think there is no one in Lindel who\u2019s as warm-hearted as you, Kiyoung. Now I know why the renowned priest Sun Hee-young has chosen to join Blue.\u201d\u201cYour face is turning red for no reason.\u201dIf only Choi Young-ki knew that I was the most manipulative and calculating person in the entire group. I only conceded because it was necessary to build good relations with everyone, just as Kim Hyunsung had planned to do.However, this would also serve to dirty everyone\u2019s opinions on Yura\u2019s party even more. I didn\u2019t just let such chances go away for nothing.\u201cThen, can we go back to our guilds now?\u201d\u201cYes. The materials that have not yet been settled will be settled and paid within a week. Of course, you will also receive a document proving ownership of the dungeon where the attack has been completed.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cOf course, this is a meaningless document, although it\u2019s better than nothing. Anyway, let\u2019s go back. It\u2019s been a long expedition, so I want to take a rest right away.\u201d\u201cYeah, that sounds good. I\u2019ll contact you later.\u201d\u201cI will contact you first. You shouldn\u2019t forget our agreement on the drinks!\u201d\u201cSure! Haha, I\u2019ll wait.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just me who was receiving such warm treatment; everyone from my party was. It felt like the earlier troubles brought about by Jung Yura never happened. I was pleasantly surprised with how everyone else was so willing to get along with other party members. After seeing how Lindel\u2019s society worked, I thought everyone would criticize us, but it turned out that this wasn\u2019t the case. Rather, we had developed trust in each other, and I knew this bond would last for a long time.I could see a satisfied Kim Hyunsung, who had let us learn so many new things, a delighted Park Deokgu with his new shield, and a happy Kim Ye-ri, who had not felt left out during the entire expedition. Even Sun Hee-young wasn\u2019t alone, and Jung Hayan did not look particularly disappointed at not being able to spend as much desired time with me as she would\u2019ve liked.After a short trip filled with nonsensical conversation, we soon found ourselves back at the Blue Guild building, which, embarrassingly enough, now felt like my home.After reporting to the guild\u2019s receptionist, we were required to make a report. Of course, I also had to meet Lee Sang-hee, the master of the sub-guild, to discuss the ratio and settlement.As we belonged to the Blue Guild, we also had to distribute the things we got with the other guild members. We didn\u2019t complain, nor did we harbor any hard feelings about it. They had treated us so well that it felt only right to give back now that we had proven ourselves capable.However, even amid everything, I knew there was something else I had to prioritize.\u201cHayan.\u201d\u201cYes, oppa.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk in private for a minute.\u201d\u201cO-Oh, sure.\u201d\u201cHyunsung, we will go up for a moment first. Deokgu, you can go eat first. We\u2019ll see you in a while, everyone!\u201dEveryone nodded in response to my words. I ignored Park Deokgu\u2019s suggestive expression and took Jung Hayan by the hand upstairs and to my room.Looking at my red-colored face, it felt like I was about to do something misleading. However, I knew some basic needs couldn\u2019t be tended to within a dungeon\u2019s confines.Upon opening my door, Jung Hayan began to look around my room.\u201cOh, oppa.\u201d\u201cHayan.\u201d\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d\u201cCan I ask you for a small favor?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll do anything you want! You just have to ask.\u201d\u2018Why is she like this\u2026\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t feel pressured, oppa. You just have to say it, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201dLooking at her expectant face, it suddenly felt much harder to get my request out. However, I had to. It was crucial.\u201cCan you find out about how the media works in Lindel?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs expected, Jung Hayan\u2019s expectant expression shifted into one of disappointment. However, she knew that she would get what she wanted with every achievement she did for me. I reinforced this thought by giving her a kiss on the cheek.\u201cYes, of course\u2026\u201d Jung Hayan nodded, almost as if possessed.\u2018Right.\u2019She still remembered the promise between us.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe media system in the Free City of Lindel couldn\u2019t even be properly called the press. This was the conclusion that Jung Hayan and I had come to.Of course, it couldn\u2019t be denied that many people here wanted to wield a pen. Freedom of the press was an ideal concept that a democratic area such as Lindel would desire. Nevertheless, it was obvious that media companies couldn\u2019t just write articles at will.\u2018That\u2019s because it\u2019s too scary to do so.\u2019After all, this was a country that was dominated by force. A person could die simply by just offending someone formidable or was of high status. Thus, the creation of articles was done conscientiously.Any topic had to be raked over with a fine-tooth comb, for even the slightest mistake in word choice could cost you your life. No one knew when a passive reader could turn into a crazed murderer and stalk after the media people just because they had offended someone.I had guessed as much upon reading a newspaper. I found nothing that could be called a legit article. There were notices and announcements, sure, but the closest ones I could find were just showbiz stuff, like what the biggest guilds liked to eat for breakfast and such.This proved to be a disappointment, seeing as I had been on the lookout for a true journalist. On the other hand, I could understand, though. Life and money were crucial to survive in such a place like Lindel. No one would dare spark controversy, especially within the media world.The question was, would I be able to find someone who\u2019d dare to change this?I needed a true journalist. I needed someone who could keep up with the trend of the times.Lindel was still relatively considered a \u2018new\u2019 place, but the system had been established for a while now. Therefore, it was important to note how much things had changed since the past economically, politically, or even socially.Even culture could play a part. What was the ideal lifestyle like at this point? How could smaller guilds rank up to be of equal footing with the larger ones? These were topics that would be sure to catch the public\u2019s attention.In some ways, I could say I was lucky. If I had stumbled upon Lindel when it was still just developing, I might have chosen to travel elsewhere. However, what this place still lacked was a little spark in controversy.Humans were the types to be interested in others\u2019 lives. This place needed content that would soothe people\u2019s boredom. Upon observation, I noticed that many people seemed to share my sentiments, which told me my plan might work.\u201cOppa, I think most of them have come.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYes, they\u2019ll be expecting you in a few minutes\u2026 What else should I do?\u201d\u201cOh, no, you\u2019ve already done enough. Thank you so much for everything, Hayan.\u201d\u201cIt was no problem at all\u2026\u201d\u201cI will definitely repay you when all of this is over.\u201d\u201cYes, I know. I trust you, oppa!\u201dShe deserved it. After all, this had a chance of working in the first place because of Jung Hayan.I pecked her on the lips before I entered the other room, and the crowd of people turned to face me. The noisy hubbub suddenly quieted down upon my arrival.They were all watching me now, both curious and anxious about what I had called them here for. I plastered a smile on my face and spoke.\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you all.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s also nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cI am Kim Seong-gyeong from the Lindel Daily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to meet you. I am Kiyoung Lee of the Blue Guild.\u201dUpon assessing their expressions, I knew these people cared much more about how much I was willing to give, rather than what I was about to say. Money was, after all, a scarcity in Lindel unless you were a guild member.After a few moments, their meals arrived. I could see everyone\u2019s expression brightening. I knew it was crucial to get to the main point right away, but this was a necessary distraction.\u201cOf course, the reason I gathered all of you today is to ask you to write a small article for me.\u201d\u201cAh, of course, I\u2019ve been expecting this. Of course, I\u2019d be willing to write. Isn\u2019t Blue Guild running at the highest stock price recently? I\u2019d be honored to promote your guild.\u201d\u2018Ah, promotion. What rubbish.\u2019I knew even if they posted a promotional article about us, it would all be for naught. The influence of media companies in this world was practically nonexistent.\u201cI heard that four of you broke through the tutorial dungeon in the shortest time and successfully completed the attack of the Garden of Terror. This will be a good article.\u201dI resisted the urge to roll my eyes. Yes, our backstory was good, but at this rate, even the Blue Guild would do a better job promoting the article than these people.\u201cHahaha, I agree. All you have to do is give us the order, and we\u2019ll take the article into the direction you want it to go.\u201dI leaned back slightly, my demeanor changing. This was the reply I was looking for.\u201cActually, the article I would want you to write is different from what you have in mind.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cI would like you to write an article about a woman named Jung Yura, who comes from the Black Swan Guild. The exact details are\u2026\u201dVery slowly, I began to explain the details of the article. I did not add or flesh anything more than what I wanted to be included within it. All I calmly stated were the events that had transpired within the dungeon expedition.However, the people\u2019s faltering expressions before me revealed what they thought about this proposed article of mine. \u2018I am not a suicide seeker\u2019 and \u2018I still want to live more\u2019 were imprinted on everyone\u2019s faces.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you just write what I have told you. Of course, it\u2019s also your freedom to flesh it out in any way you would want to. I personally would appreciate it if you write it a little more provocatively. You know the public likes stimulating content. The gold you will receive will surely not disappoint you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI had expected an ominous silence to descend in the room.\u201cWell, this seems like a difficult preposition\u2026\u201d\u201cYou think?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I can understand your intentions for wanting this article written, but the content\u2026\u201d\u201cOh no, I am not telling you to write about the Black Swan Guild itself. Rather, I am asking you to focus on Jung Yura as an individual.\u201d\u201cYes, but still\u2026\u201dI watched these people exchange unsure looks with each other, and the discomfort in the room began to heighten as they pondered over my proposed article. If I had come from a less influential guild or my name was not already known within the city, these people would say no to my face and left in a hurry.\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d\u201cO-Oh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are worried for your safety. You know publishing an article like this will earn you some definite consequences. However, I want you to know that this article isn\u2019t for my intentions\u2026\u201d\u201cWhose-?\u201d\u201cIt is Cha Hee-ra\u2019s will.\u201dOf course, what I had just said was a lie\u2014a necessary one.\u201cI understand that you will be afraid, nonetheless. Jung Yura\u2019s personal retaliation is very scary. I know that even if the Mercenary Queen herself grants you her protection, it will be difficult.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you write the article, you will have to use your real name.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI know some of you are also worried about the impact the article will receive once it gets published. Nothing good ever comes from criticizing large guilds. However, people will be wondering why this kind of incident happened. Your sales rates will go up beyond comparison, and you will be able to earn more than your usual salaries.\u201d\u201cAh, but the gold isn\u2019t the problem here\u2026\u201d\u201cThe more people read your article, the safer you will be. The more articles are sold under your name, the more influence you can gain \u2013 thus making you safer.\u201dI could see looks of understanding pass over some of the reporters\u2019 faces. After all, some of these people had probably also been working for the press back when they were still living on Earth.\u201cJust because they have power doesn\u2019t mean they can just disregard the public. Large guilds also value public attention. They cannot act recklessly. Everybody knows this. There is already a social system established within Lindel. The era of simply operating by hunting or dungeon expeditions has already passed.\u201dThere were still expressions of fear imprinted on their faces. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy trying to persuade them.\u201cNo matter how you put it, publishing an article like this is still dangerous\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Red Mercenary Guild will be supporting you. Is that not protection enough? You know how influential Cha Hee-ra is in this city.\u201d\u201cBut, if the article will be written using our real names\u2026\u201d\u201cThat part is the most important. If you are proven correct, it will be difficult to avoid the blame from the standpoint of the Black Swan Guild.\u201dI tried to speak as calmly as I could to try and ease the anxiety of the reporters. I knew Cha Hee-ra wouldn\u2019t be enough to spark them to do my bidding. Even if protection was guaranteed, it was still a highly-risky move to write an article against any large, existing guild.I sighed a little and began to speak again.\u201cWhy do you think the media companies in Lindel have not been successful thus far?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Well, retaliation, for one thing\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. Of course, the thought of retaliation is scary. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been writing substandard articles so far. Of course, I am not condemning or insulting what you have been doing. This is an unavoidable situation. I understand that this continent is a place where it will not be easy to publish such articles carelessly.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not the right answer.\u201d\u201cYou think\u2026?\u201d\u201cTo trap yourself in this type of mindset means you\u2019re only hindering the success of your companies. This isn\u2019t the way to go about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe biggest reason for your failure is that you don\u2019t have the drive to push through. Perhaps those who had been journalists back on Earth can understand me. The most important thing is that you do not directly state which side you\u2019re on. You let the public do that. Instead, you simply insinuate. That\u2019s what gives the press a lot of power in this type of background.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me to take the side of the Blue Guild and Red Mercenaries?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. Just write the article we need. The press won\u2019t be completely free from the matter either way. You can criticize the enemies of the Blue and Red Mercenaries and defend us. All you need to do is move the public. There will be no disadvantage if you go the other way. You can choose the Black Swan, or if you have a route that leads to another faction, you can go there. The fact stands that you will not be free from retaliation whichever path you choose to take. External pressure is an inevitable routine. But isn\u2019t risking your lives a natural occurrence in a place like Lindel?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd as you are threatened, I will see to it that you will gain even bigger rewards.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get insurmountable gold.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd, most importantly\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get the power you seek.\u201dOf course, this was only an illusion. At the very least, their sales rates would indeed get higher, and they would gain a semblance of influence. However, influence wasn\u2019t the same thing as power.Looking at the expressions on their faces now, I knew I had them reeled in \u2013 hook, line, and sinker.I bowed.\u201cThank you very much for hearing me out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI must have acted overly excited to get a proper hold of my bearings back at the Garden of Terror.For some reason, I hadn\u2019t read the atmosphere as easily as I used to. I came as a shock when I was asked, along with my guild, to exit the expedition! While that cunning trickster Lee Kiyoung riled up the group to take his side against mine, he watched from the sidelines and let them do the dirty work for him.I could still remember that husky, untrustworthy tone of voice, along with the countless times he\u2019d tried to hide his smile as I was in hot water. He was fortunate that I didn\u2019t have my dagger in hand at the time, or he would have been dead.I clenched my fists tightly upon reminiscing, shaking from where I lay.\u2018Abominable offspring\u2026\u2019Assessing the amount of magical power and profession that Lee Kiyoung possessed, I knew he was the kind of man Lindel needed to get rid of, a pest to be eradicated. He was probably the type of guy who would have been in the slums if he hadn\u2019t found a party to cling to.It felt ridiculous seeing other people get tricked by him so easily. I knew he was thick-faced from the start, but I wasn\u2019t expecting him to be as shameless as he had acted.He even dared to apologize to me as if I had threatened him! Though he sounded sincere, that look in his eyes suggested otherwise. He had successfully fooled everyone around us!When I recalled his expression once more, anger began to rise from within me.\u201cShit\u2026\u201dAs I tried to lie still, a voice came from outside my room.\u201cYura, are you there?\u201d\u201cI am. How\u2019s the situation looking so far?\u201d\u201cSame, it\u2019s all just the same. We haven\u2019t heard anything new yet.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to make a formal protest.\u201d\u201cJust long will it take for them to assess the situation?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy the hell had we not noticed this? There seems to be some sort of agreement between the Blue Guild and the Red Mercenary Guild. What the hell are these Red Mercenaries even doing, anyway? I have a feeling they\u2019re the ones pulling the strings.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve only been told to stay quiet and stay wary. We thought it best not to draw too much attention to ourselves yet\u2026 Cha Hee-ra might be watching.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Cha Hee-ra?\u201d\u201cIt seemed that the guild executives have been meeting with the Red Mercenaries.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Are they saying that there is no need to understand the situation anymore? Did they not read what we have written in the report?\u201d\u201cOf course they did, but\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd we all know we are not the perpetrators! All witnesses seem to think that we, the Black Swans, are the bad people! Do you want the people of Lindel to treat us like idiots? In fact, why are you all so scared of that whore?! She and that\u2026 That Lee Kiyoung! That son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do for the moment\u2026 There are rumors that that man has become Cha Hee-ra\u2019s gigolo. There are also stories that say that they might have been lovers in the past life. Perhaps that\u2019s why the two guilds seem to have such a close-knit relationship\u2026 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand where you\u2019re coming from\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAnyway, it would be better to watch the situation a little more. There will definitely be a chance for payback.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not just going to aim for retribution. I will torture Lee Kiyoung endlessly until he begs for mercy. He seems to think that Cha Hee-ra will protect him forever. Let\u2019s see how long that faith will last.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cBesides, they\u2019ve caused so many blunders during the guild expedition, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I mean at first, but now\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh, I know what you mean. We\u2019ll still be able to use that to our advantage, however.\u201d\u201cAnyway, we still have a shot at this. Since they\u2019ve still sent us our items, it means we haven\u2019t been totally ignored, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cYeah. We\u2019ve received a lot of rare-grade items, and upon looking at the list, we still got more than Blue Guild has obtained.\u201d\u201cAs we should. No matter how protected they are by the Red Mercenaries, we still deserve more rewards than they do.\u201d\u201cI agree\u2026 Anyway, do you want to head out for a bite to eat? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cYes, sure, I\u2019m hungry as well, anyway.\u201d\u201cI heard that a new restaurant opened up nearby. We should go take a look.\u201dI nodded and stood up, wanting to rid my thoughts of that oily smirk and calculating eyes. I knew if I stayed cooped up in my room any longer, I would lose it.Opportunities for revenge would certainly come in the future. No matter how protected Blue Guild is by the Red Mercenaries, they should know better than to mess with one of the large guilds such as the Black Swans. With this thought, I started to feel better.We left the guild building in no time at all. I did not think much of the unusually large amount of people out until we arrived at the square, where I saw a crowd clustering around.\u201cUgh\u2026 So trashy people such as these do exist.\u201d\u201cEven if I close my eyes, I can imagine how barbaric they must be.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dVoices dripping with disapproval echoed throughout the square. I might have mistaken it for common hubbub when I noticed that every single person had a newspaper in their hands.I blinked. This was an unusual scene. The media in Lindel wasn\u2019t powerful or influential at all, and hardly anyone bought the paper. At best, all they had in their published paper were news of new monsters or the Holy Empire. It was usually only adventurers who read the paper.However, seeing that even non-adventurers all had the paper in their hands, my curiosity began to spike. A dark feeling began to spread all over my body, and I couldn\u2019t resist but grab a paper for myself.\u201cOh, unnie\u2026\u201d\u201cT-This\u2026\u201d[Bashing on Blue!][The first dungeon trip of Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party, who was recruited for a large sum of money in Blue, ended successfully. You may remember all the party members that broke through the tutorial dungeon in the fastest time, and with only four people! This party, called the Kim Hyunsung Party, left Lindel a few weeks ago with the Magical Guild, the Red Mercenary Guild, and the Black Swan Guild to show off their unity with the other guilds.While there were certain criticisms to be heard about newbies joining veterans, the Magic Guild\u2019s attack log was leaked, causing controversy to spark within the city. It was then that Jung Yura, a member of the Black Swan guild, was revealed to the public.From the time the expedition started, and the Black Swans were seen to be arriving back separately, many wondered if something had happened in the dungeon, and eventually, these rumors were proven to be true!The truth is that Jung Yura (29) did not only cause conflict in the party before their departure but had also threatened one of the members of the Blue Guild. Many have testified that she has been too harsh on the Blue Guild\u2019s party, marking a frown on everyone\u2019s faces.Mr. Kiyoung, who was involved in the case, was conscious of the perpetrators and did not reveal what the threats were about, but rumors spread that physical pressure is part of the picture.Experts speculate that it is probably due to the dungeon\u2019s contribution rewards, but none of these hunches have been accurately revealed yet. While it is true that both Blue and Black Swans are affected by this, the attention focuses on where this event will lead their relationship.It is a very familiar occurrence in Lindel, our Free City, to attack dungeons through cooperation between guilds. Of course, the issue of item distribution and contribution also seems to be the same. Everyone will know the tricks cast by particular guilds out of greed for the rewards.The fact that large guilds keep pressing on the smaller guilds is well-known by everyone. However, it is shocking to see a guild do so in such an unsubtle manner. \u2013Reporter]\u2018What is this\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t even the end of it.[Miss Jung Yura (29) dares the Red Mercenary Queen to protect her subordinates.][Miss Yura, a member of the Black Swans and a party member included in the latest guild expedition, has spewed a truckload of remarks that have caused an uproar within Lindel. These remarks hurled at Mr. Lee Kiyoung, a speculated lover of the Queen, have become quite the controversy. When Mr. Kiyoung\u2019s party was seen to be helping the expedition out in such an efficient manner, Miss Jung Yura, apparently worried about their contribution reward distribution, began to threaten Mr. Kiyoung with scandalous remarks.Upon investigation, it was revealed that she insulted Mr. Kiyoung for being one of the Mercenary Queen\u2019s pillars and even went so far as to question if the Queen would protect him to his face!What causes such unease is that Miss Yura did not just hurl these statements towards Mr. Kiyoung, but the Red Queen herself. Speculations about what damages this might cause for the relationship between Red Mercenary and Black Swans are still large. \u2013Jung Ilbo]Several provocative titles continued to catch my eye.[About the relationship between the Black Swan and the Red Mercenary GuildSubtitle: Where does Blue stand in this?][Dungeon columnist Kim Seong-gyeong][How should I look at the controversy caused by Black Swan Guild member Jung Yura? -Lindel Political Department Reporter Yoomi Kang][Miss Jung Yura (29) reignites past controversy][Who is Black Swan trying to excommunicate \u2013 the Red Mercenary Guild, or the Blue Guild?]In less than a day, my whole world had crumbled. My hands shook as I continued to skim through the paper.I couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly was going on right now.However, I could only think of the owner of that blasted oily smirk and the calculating gaze that had been driving me crazy nonstop.\u201cDamn\u2026 they\u2019re lucky Blue Guild is still quite a large guild. If it were us, we wouldn\u2019t just be insulted by them\u2026 We\u2019d be dead too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of people like these that Lindel isn\u2019t progressing at all.\u201d\u201cSh, be quiet!\u201d\u201cNo, am I wrong?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 That person over there\u2026 Isn\u2019t that Jung Yura?\u201d\u201cShh. She can hear you, you know.\u201d\u2018This\u2026 This son of a bitch.\u2019It was only now that I truly began to comprehend how this had happened and who had ensured that this would occur.\u2018Lee Kiyoung, you son of a bitch\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThis is a well-made article.\u201dI had initially thought that there would be changes to the story I had proposed, but more importantly, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the reporters had indeed taken the bait. The story itself didn\u2019t just criticize Jung Yura and the abuse of power within the Free City of Lindel.\u201cBut damaging the reputation of such a large guild\u2026 Is that okay?\u201d\u2018Ah, it\u2019s very good.\u2019Titles such as those currently found in the paper would surely elicit a reaction among every reader within Lindel. After all, most people here knew how it felt to be oppressed by a greater force.Granted, I haven\u2019t been treated like that within Lindel as I had fortunately entered a guild still considered prestigious, but I could bet that the smaller guilds would have all experienced such treatment.To put it simply, getting a place within one of the large guilds automatically equated to being part of Lindel\u2019s higher class. In this manner, it wasn\u2019t that hard to predict the multitude of corruption cases within the city.In this particular coverage, all parties involved came from large guilds. Still, since I, a newbie member of a guild that tethered on the edge of ruination, was portrayed as the victim of said familiar oppression, the public was sure to be on my side.The reaction was almost immediate. The other large-scale guilds went to great lengths to prove that they had better personalities than the Black Swans, and through subtle means, the smaller guilds showed us that they were supporting us.It felt like a social movement of sorts. This was what the ability to move the masses could amount to. No matter how strong one was, it didn\u2019t mean anything if no one supported him. In that same mindset, Lindel\u2019s upperclassmen only hold their power because the lower class, as much as they would like to deny it, acknowledge their power.Simply put, the upperclassmen cannot exist without the lower class. Without people buying weapons from the Red Mercenaries\u2019 shop, potions from the Magic Guild, cheap information from the Black Swans, or other merchandise from other guilds, society\u2019s higher throngs cannot maintain their standing. They can only do so because those lower than them were responsible for their success.These people probably forgot \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the Earth we were so accustomed to living in. In a place like this, logic only worked when it was backed up by power. For this very reason, it was understandable as to why the media did not hold a lot of power. Yet they may have forgotten that the media is the key to getting the people\u2019s support.However, with certain story coverage, I knew people had started to realize just how scary the press could be. The effect was indeed awesome.In addition to boycotting all businesses operated by the Black Swan Guild, small and medium-sized guilds, renowned explorers, and adventurers had also expressed their intentions to never attack dungeons with any of their members.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019It truly was a frightening event when all the oppressed banded together for a common goal \u2013 to raise the voices of the marginalized.Though each individual had different reasons, they all cooperated just the same.I knew that, just from this meager little story, I had already helped in the formation of Lindel\u2019s revolutionary history.After I ate my lunch, I headed outside, where several reporters were waiting. Of course, these weren\u2019t the same reporters who had bothered to attend my invitation before. These were the ones who did not attend or could smell the money they could gain from also covering this story.\u201cMay I have a moment of your time? About Jung Yura\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry. There is still an official announcement about this\u2026\u201d\u201cI know it would be quite the hassle, but do you have anything to say about-\u201c\u201cWe will officially hold a press conference about this later.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of Jung Yura\u2019s remarks about the collaboration between Red and Blue?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something I can answer just yet.\u201d\u201cOi, don\u2019t bother my hyung so much!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Deokgu.\u201dWe had to remember to be kind to journalists, especially for the time being. Whoever won their support also won the support of the public.\u201cI would like to ask what position you are taking in the current Black Swan Guild boycott.\u201d The guy who asked this question looked pretty familiar to me.\u2018Is that Kim Seong-gyeong?\u2019It did look like him. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to answer this particular question.\u201cI was able to see how many people could feel the loss, regardless of whether this was true or not. It wasn\u2019t just what happened to me. The outrage must stem from the pus of injustice that many people have felt from living in Lindel. Of course, this is understandable, but I am worried that many of you will feel too angry. That is all.\u201dDirectly answering the question in the form of an indirect response would be the best direction I could take.\u201cAre you saying that all the threats in the dungeon are true?\u201d\u201cI will not comment.\u201d\u201cAre you in support of the boycott?\u201d\u201cI support the matter on the one hand, but not on the other. I\u2019m just worried that this will cause further damage.\u201dEmploying such subtle wording was truly a talent of mine. I wanted to take down the Black Swan Guild, but not through a direct hit. I would rather give the guild itself a chance to redeem themselves.The only casualty I wanted was Jung Yura.\u201cPlease tell me something about Cha Hee-ra.\u201d\u201cI will arrange a seat for you later.\u201d\u201cPlease talk to the adventurers who are angry about this situation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to speak for now, but I suppose I can say something. Your actions in resisting injustice in society are never wrong. Every individual is more influential than they would like to think. The way you act without giving into pressure\u2026 You are all helping in your own ways.\u201dThe reporters wrote down my words diligently as I spoke. I had a feeling this would turn into a new article by tomorrow.[I understand the feelings of adventurers who are feeling lost.]Something like that would probably appear on the next barrage of articles.[I support the boycott, but worry about dealing further damage.]I was feeling pretty good about this. After all, reporters knew how to spin even the drabbest of responses into something more dramatic. This would surely cause another uproar tomorrow.More questions arose after my response, but I knew responding to any more might come back to bite me in the rear end.Since I was playing the role of victim, I needed to speak the least amount. The more interpretations these reporters came up with, the better.While I thought about this, Park Deokgu began to speak beside me.\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know it was going to be this big, hyung.\u201d\u201cNeither did I.\u201d Of course, that was a lie.\u201cI think I should be more careful about my actions in the future\u2026 This is bad.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if you just act as you usually do.\u201d\u201cSo, didn\u2019t you say that the Red Mercenary will be announcing their stand today?\u201d\u201cHuh. Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dI knew what this would already entail. They would respond directly to the criticisms stated by Jung Yura, particularly about their Mercenary Queen, but would not assault the guild itself. After all, the stories had already covered the insults directed towards Cha Hee-ra, so it was only right that she took the necessary precautions and struck back.\u2018And maybe within a week\u2026\u201dEventually, the Black Swan Guild will also be giving an announcement. However, it would be too late by then. I didn\u2019t know what was currently going on within their guild now, but I knew for sure that they must be feeling embarrassed.Perhaps there must have also been an uproar within their guild. Anyhow, there must be a reason as to why they were taking so long to respond.If I were in their shoes, I would have formed a response team right away and tried to get in touch with the opposite side. Simply giving an appearance was a form of action in itself. Had the Black Swans have any smarts in them, they would have responded by now.It was then that Sun Hee-young approached me.\u201cMr. Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSome people from the Black Swans Guild are here.\u201d\u2018Oh?\u2019It turned out that the Black Swans did have some semblance of smarts within them.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know specifically. It seems that they\u2019ve come to apologize.\u201d\u201cAre they waiting in the reception room?\u201d\u201cYes, they are.\u201d Sun Hee-young nodded slightly. I thanked her and began to head in the direction of the reception room, where I found familiar faces waiting for me.The first person I noticed was Jung Yura herself. With her were various Black Swan Guild executives. I also saw Lee Seol-ho with the crowd, and I stiffened. What was this crazy old man doing?I didn\u2019t know what exactly was happening, but I was not too fond of the idea of him trying to get on board with all this craziness.\u201cWhat to say about this\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha, do not fret about it. For now\u2026\u201dAs I saw them converse, annoyance soared from within me.Then I noticed a familiar-looking woman sitting on one side.\u2018Lee Ji-Hye?\u2019I remembered her from the shelter that Kim Hyunsung had devised back in the tutorial dungeon. What was she doing here? I felt surprised.I didn\u2019t think that Lee Ji-Hye was entirely useless in terms of abilities, but I would never have thought that she\u2019d try to get herself in with the Black Swans.It was ridiculous to see them cozying up with the deranged old executives from our side.\u2018Ha.\u2019[Check player Jihye Lee\u2019s status window and potential.][Name-Jihye Lee][Title-None.

Always be careful with your actions.]While assessing her current stats, I continued to watch both sides converse with each other. However, some of the gazes had already begun to swing over to where I stood.Lee Ji-Hye, who was one of them, began to speak in a happy tone of voice.\u201cOppa! It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u2018What? Since when was I her oppa\u2026?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter assessing the atmosphere, I began to understand how Lee Jihye planned to direct this situation.\u2018Hm, she\u2019s smart.\u2019Evidently, it seemed that I wasn\u2019t the only one who knew how to assess situations. The Black Swans were fortunate to have someone capable of handling their internal affairs.It was a little embarrassing to say that my rival could quite possibly be Lee Jihye, but I knew there was nothing shameful about it. The woman could quite possibly be as good as me in the employment of underhanded, political tactics.In any case, she was a hundred times better and smarter than Jung Yura. That also meant I had a valid reason to feel wary now.\u2018Unfortunately for you, however, I know just what you\u2019re planning to do.\u2019Lee Jihye was a woman who clearly understood what a deal was. She must have planned to let the others know of our \u2018close\u2019 relationship through such means.I decided to play along. \u201cIs that really you?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s nice to see you here again.\u201d\u201cLong time no see. How have you been?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been fine. I honestly thought it\u2019d be a long time before we meet again. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to see that it isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d As I nodded in response to her words, I confirmed that I was right. All present Black Swan Guild members looked pleased upon hearing this exchange, and so did the delusional old men from my side.\u201cHahaha. I see that you\u2019re both getting along quite well.\u201d\u2018What the heck are you laughing at? You crazy old man.\u2019I didn\u2019t like the fact that these old geezers were here. It spelled nothing but bad news. At the same time, a slight feeling of embarrassment coursed through me at this display.Although the Black Swans were indeed a large guild representing Lindel, the Blue Guild had no reason to kowtow to them just because they had decided to visit. We were the ones in agreement with the Red Mercenary Guild. In short, we had the upper hand.This scene was just like spoiling Jung Yura with lots of candy.In the process of resolving this diplomatically complex situation, I knew the Blue Guild could gain more from the outcome than any other guild would. Better relationships? New ones? Greater influence? I didn\u2019t get why my fellow members were acting this way.\u201cI must apologize for stopping by this late. We also had some matters to deal with from our side.\u201d\u201cNo, no, your presence here is already enough.\u201d Lee Seolho laughed pleasantly.\u2018Enough? What do you mean, enough? Crazy old man.\u2019I didn\u2019t like how we were faring in this exchange. There were polite smiles all around and the easy dismissal of apologies. In such a situation, I felt like I was the rude one, simply because I was the only one who refused to join in the pleasantries.Then the introductions began.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I failed to do this\u2026 I am Choi Eunhee from the Black Swan Guild.\u201d\u201cI am Lee Kiyoung. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dHowever, it seemed that Lee Seolho did not want to help me out. As if to ignore my words, he turned to Choi Eunhee and spoke as if I was not there at all.\u201cOh no, no, why don\u2019t we have some tea instead of all this awkward hoo-ha?\u201d\u201cYes, Seolho. Shall we do that?\u201dThey then began to strike up a conversation, leaving me fuming. This old man was ruining all my plans!\u2018Hah, and to think I even thought about giving you some mercy.\u2019It really was such a hassle when the trash in your own guild proved to be more thick-faced than the guild you\u2019ve been targeting. I knew Lee Seolho was a pain in the ass, but not to this extent!Realizing I needed to act quickly, I began to think of what to say.However, it was Lee Jihye who spoke next.\u201cTea would be nice. I think the both of you should do that. We still have other things to discuss here.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dBoth Lee Seolho and Choi Eunhee gazed at Lee Jihye in surprise. However, upon seeing Choi Eunhee nod at her words, almost trembling, I knew Lee Jihye had more authority than I first thought.\u2018Hm, that\u2019s interesting\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t know exactly how the Black Swan Guild\u2019s system operated, but it seemed that they had respect for those who held authority within their group. I could appreciate that.\u201cThen will we do that? Seolho?\u201d\u201cY-Yes, I suppose\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have separate matters to talk about, anyway. I think it would be better to leave this work to the younger ones. First, I will show you the gift I brought.\u201d\u201cHuh, huh. Thank you so much for this, Eunhee Choi.\u201d\u2018He\u2019s not just crazy, he\u2019s also gullible.\u2019Their plan was quite obvious. They wanted to win the Blue Guild over by bribing the corrupted ones with gifts. Choi Eunhee smiled and nodded to Lee Jihye upon Seolho\u2019s confirmation.\u201cTake care of Yura then, Jihye.\u201d\u201cYes, eunni.\u201dNo matter which angle I tried to take, the two indeed resembled a close-knit relationship. Pretty soon, the elder ones left the parlor, leaving me alone with Lee Jihye and Jung Yura.Although Lee Jihye herself was smiling, Jung Yura looked none too pleased to be here. It seemed that she was struggling from just trying to rein in her emotions. I could understand why,She was also struggling with self-guilt; I knew it. Not only did she bring shame to her guild, but she also single-handedly destroyed their pleasant relationship with the Red Mercenaries. Now many adventurers chose to boycott the Black Swans, leaving the guild with less than a few opportunities to redeem themselves.It was only natural that her position within the guild be brought down due to her actions. Perhaps she was grateful she hadn\u2019t been kicked out at this point.Even with these thoughts running in my head, the urge to smile was still apparent.Unsurprisingly, Lee Jihye took it upon herself to start the conversation.\u201cAren\u2019t you annoyed?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe old man from earlier\u2026 It doesn\u2019t take a lot of smarts to realize if someone is useless or not, and that man looked as useless as they would go.\u201d\u201cWell, every guild has its own circumstances to focus on. I wasn\u2019t even expecting to see you.\u201d\u201cIt just happened out of the blue. I hadn\u2019t been expecting it at all, yet I suppose my guild also needs someone to deal with situations like these. The executives also decided that I would be the best person to deal with this situation.\u201d\u201cI agree with them.\u201d\u201cThis is all thanks to you. After all, you inspired me to work harder to secure my standing.\u201d\u201cThank you for such praise.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying this for the sake of having something to say. In fact, I\u2019ve seen the advantages of being close to you, oppa. Knowing you, you\u2019re very well capable of designing situations such as this.\u201dI couldn\u2019t read her expression properly, but I knew that she was just trying to get me to admit to my doing in the end. Keeping my expression nonchalant, I shrugged.\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dJung Yura, who was sitting next to Lee Jihye, looked very much embarrassed. During this whole exchange, she shrunk down in her seat, trying her best to look inconspicuous.I, too, felt a little surprised. I would have expected Lee Jihye to include her in the conversation right away, but the opposite was happening. It actually felt like Jung Yura was being excluded from the conversation.No\u2026 It felt like Lee Jihye was using this opportunity to watch Jung Yura\u2019s reaction.\u2018Huh.\u2019I had to admit that the girl was definitely resourceful. Although she had revealed her advantageous position at having some form of relationship with me, Lee Jihye only seemed interested in having this advantage serve her well, not for the guild\u2019s sake.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s all been said and done. There\u2019s nothing we can do but try our best to fix the situation\u2026 But before that, how have you been all this time? It\u2019s been so long\u2026\u201dI was no longer surprised when Lee Jihye hitched up her skirt ever-so-subtly as she spoke.I remained poker-faced.\u201cOh, you\u2019re so cruel. I thought for a moment that it would be good to reminisce\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say such things, Jihye. You\u2019re just trying to spin this situation around.\u201d\u201cOh, oppa. If this girl wasn\u2019t here right now, I know things would be different.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of that.\u201d\u201cI think I can understand what you mean\u2026 Anyway! Before we get on with the real story, I think an apology is in order. Jung Yura? It\u2019s your turn.\u201d Upon saying this, Lee Jihye tapped Yura on the shoulder.To be honest, I wasn\u2019t expecting this kind of scenario at all. If I had known, I would have brought Lee Jihye to my side as soon as possible.At Lee Ji-hye\u2019s urging, Jung Yura turned to look at me.Of course, I knew she had no intention to apologize to me at all. In fact, the woman was probably thinking about how unfair it was to have to apologize when she did nothing wrong in the first place. However, on the other hand, she knew she had no choice.Seeing her struggling within herself almost made me laugh.It wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but it\u2019s not bad either.\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201d\u201cOh, Miss Yura\u2026 I think you have to apologize a little more sincerely, or else my oppa will not accept that.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA painful silence ensued afterwards.Suddenly, Lee Jihye lunged forward and grabbed Jung Yura\u2019s hair by the handful, forcing her to look at me directly.\u2018Huh.\u2019At this point, I couldn\u2019t really figure out what was going on anymore.After seeing Yura\u2019s trembling expression, I began to wonder more about Lee Jihye\u2019s influence within their guild.\u201cYura, didn\u2019t you hear what I just said?\u201dJung Yura blinked several times at this, unsure as to how she could respond.\u201cPlease do it properly this time.\u201dWatching this spectacle almost made me laugh aloud. Seeing how Lee Jihye treated Jung Yura, I caught a glimpse of how the entire guild must be treating the woman now.At the same time, I made a mental note to assess Lee Jihye more carefully now. It appeared that every move she made was calculated, yet for what reason, I did not know.Perhaps she did it to show off her authority to the other person, but I also knew it had something to do with showing preference to the opposing side \u2013 my side.It felt great seeing someone like me, someone who knew they had little to no potential, yet managed to get by through wits alone.Based on potentials, it wouldn\u2019t be a hassle for Jung Yura to kill Lee Jihye off. In fact, it would be as easy as stomping on an ant. However, the fear on the other woman\u2019s face was palpable, giving me the impression that Lee Jihye\u2019s position within the Black Swan was quite possibly higher than my position within the Blue Guild.\u201cPlease apologize as sincerely as you can.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWith a snap, Jung Yura was forced to look my way again. Watching her, I felt no compassion at all. Rather, this scene felt a bit exhilarating to witness. I wasn\u2019t a pervert, but it felt nice to see one of my past tormentors suffer to this extent.Tears had already begun dripping from Jung Yura\u2019s eyes. However, she tried her best to remain composed.When a moment had passed, and she still had not apologized, Lee Jihye hauled the woman to her feet.\u201cI told you to apologize straight away. Yura.\u201dWhatever choice Jung Yura would make now didn\u2019t matter. She would receive humiliation either way.\u201cDo you understand me now? Apologize as sincerely as you can.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u201dAt the next moment, Lee Jihye sent Jung Yura sprawling onto the floor. It was then that the woman broke.\u201cSorry. Ugh\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry. I was very thoughtless in my words and actions\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dI felt a strange sort of pleasure at this scene. Here was a woman who could easily kill me off if she wished to \u2013 and yet, she was on the floor and apologizing to me.As soon as she apologized, Lee Jihye turned to me.\u201cI have anything you want. If you don\u2019t want me, then will this girl do?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not interested in that.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026 There must be something you want.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 I think my shoes look a little dirty\u2026\u201dAt my words, Lee Jihye began to smile.\u2018Ah, it\u2019s such a waste not to have you on my team\u2026\u2019I couldn\u2019t help but think this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, seeing her trembling, I knew she would have no choice but to concede to what I wanted.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019This entire time, I could feel Lee Jihye\u2019s heavy gaze set upon me. At this point, I was more curious about how she had scored such a high position within the Black Swans than I was curious about Jung Yura\u2019s wellbeing.The girl in question spoke. \u201cYou seem to be curious about this situation.\u201d\u201cSure, I am. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised they let you treat her this way. Even with the trouble she\u2019s caused, she\u2019s still quite powerful in her own right. Are you sure there aren\u2019t any risks in what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\u201cThere is no risk at all, rest assured.\u201dI stopped talking then, only because I was busy assessing Yura\u2019s status with my ability.[Check player Jung Yura\u2019s status window and potential.][Name-Yura Jung][Title-The Worst Woman Ever][Age-29][Propensity-Calculating Strategist][Job-Assassination Thief-Rare Grade][Job Effect-Acquisition of basic archery knowledge][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of basic dagger skills][Occupational Effect-Acquisition of basic trapping knowledge][Job Effect-Acquisition of basic assassination knowledge][The acquired knowledge is not available.][Capacity][Strength -41\u219205/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Agility-55\u219210/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Health -43 \u2192 11 /Growth limit: Hero or less][Intellect -40 \u2192 30 /Growth limit: Rare or less][Durability -20 \u2192 05 /Growth limit: Rare or higher][Luck -23\u219210/Growth limit: Rare or less][Holy -43\u219209/Growth limit: Hero or higher][Overall Review-Her body is damaged due to external shock. Most of her magic circuits were destroyed. Due to the damage to her muscle fibers, her stats have decreased. It is not an exaggeration to say that her life as an adventurer is over. She can be healed with divine healing magic or with a saintly-class priest, but there is no assurance of such as an event. Anyway, this is so very tragic. To lose a talent with great potential, unlike Kiyoung Lee, is indeed a tragedy to behold.]\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019Among everything I\u2019ve read, her newly-assigned title caught my eye.I had been expecting the creation of such a title, but I wasn\u2019t expecting her stats to decrease as a result. Upon seeing my curious expression, Lee Jihye spoke up once again.\u201cHer body has been damaged in various places, you see.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShe looks fine on the outside, but they say she\u2019s going to struggle to even live a normal life. The media\u2019s so harsh that it\u2019s a relief she isn\u2019t dead yet. Honestly, I\u2019m the one who saved her life. The situation hasn\u2019t even been assessed properly yet, and this happens. That\u2019s why the higher-ups of our guild are angry.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cWhile we were still trying to understand what exactly had happened, there were some other people who thought that now would be the right time to show what would happen to people who they thought \u2018abused\u2019 their powers, and I guess they singled her out as a prime example.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019re some more internal issues at hand, but since they\u2019re guild matters, I\u2019m not authorized to tell you, no matter what position I hold.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean there\u2019s a power struggle within the guild?\u201d Even as I asked, I already knew the answer.As expected, Lee Jihye nodded.I honestly thought the Black Swans were a cluttered mess, but I didn\u2019t expect for it to be this bad. There must have been a lot of power-hungry people like Jung Yura in their midst. Perhaps this event wasn\u2019t a bad thing after all \u2013 it gave them a reason to start throwing out the trash among them.\u201cThe people who hold positions within our guild were all rotten to the core, so it was only right to cut them off and replace the Guild Master. I\u2019m sure you think the same.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not someone who speaks with no factual basis, you know. If everything goes well, the guild will be refined, and the guild master will get replaced. And contrary to what you think, most of this has been done peacefully.\u201d\u201cDoes that explain why you\u2019ve been sent here? With this woman?\u201d\u201cWhat really matters here is how our internal affairs are going, not what will happen to Yura. Another important thing to take note of is what the public thinks of this mess. You definitely made a bigger spectacle this time, oppa.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u201d\u201cYou seem to be worrying about me using this information against you. Don\u2019t worry, recording magic doesn\u2019t exist. Anyway, I had to do what was best for the guild, and that meant siding with a few insignificant members, or siding with you and the public.\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019d you do?\u201d\u201cI just wrote a few hundred reports after analyzing the current situation, and the cause as to why the guild has been decaying. I also took into account the direction in which the Black Swan should take to move forward, the relationship between the Blue and Red Mercenaries, and the possibility of Blue\u2019s growth in the future. I also included what kind of man you are, oppa. However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve expounded on that clearly enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyway, my actions seemed a little too fresh for the higher-ups. Why do you think we\u2019ve suddenly come to visit, even when we know our guild\u2019s still in hot water after the recent press coverage?\u201dAh, she really was crafty, this Lee Jihye.In other words, she was saying she took the guild\u2019s internal crisis as an opportunity to unleash her skills and show them what she was capable of.\u201cThe fact report wasn\u2019t perfect, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m not as talented as you are, Kiyoung, and I didn\u2019t have enough time. Anyway, in a situation where no one wanted to step up and take responsibility, I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to step up just this once and show them what I could offer.\u201d\u201cSo what did you have in mind? Any changes?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026 Well, I think you\u2019re more curious about the reason why. Could we talk about this later? You\u2019ll have to tell us the conditions you want first. We can compensate you as much as we can. In addition to the official apology gift, we still have a lot to spare\u2026 Ah, I can give you this woman, too, if you want her!\u201d\u201cHuh, how sincere of you.\u201d\u201cBut of course!\u201dAs I glanced back towards the said woman, I could see Jung Yura still struggling helplessly on the floor. A slight smile broke onto my face as I watched her. How despicable.\u2018I know deep inside, she\u2019s still going to want to recover.\u2019Of course, high-ranking priests or divine elixirs weren\u2019t readily available in these parts. There weren\u2019t a few people who could really be called high priests in the first place, and the process of bringing them in was a painfully expensive affair.The same went for the elixirs, since alchemy wasn\u2019t a popular class, and the ingredients were rare.In other words, the best shot Jung Yura had at this was by continuously attacking dungeons and recovering her own strength, little by little.As I reached out to brush away a few strands of her hair, I could see her expression as she looked up. It was a mix of anger, resentment, worry, and regret. It was such a messy expression, compared to my shoes, which had now been wiped clean at my request.\u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t think things would go so well\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was true, though \u2013 my interest had been piqued.\u201cI guess now you\u2019ve realized, huh?\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve realized that you don\u2019t really know what can happen to people unless it actually happens.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand, but I think it\u2019s just the right type of retribution for people like you. If you were given an opportunity again, you\u2019d probably go back to the way you were.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that principle applies to me, too.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, it won\u2019t happen the way you hope for it to. Unlike you, I\u2019m not a brat who only learns once she\u2019s at the bottom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn your case, you were just out of luck this time around. If you work hard, you may be able to recover, so try to live with strength. And uh, since you\u2019ve stuck to your values \u2018til the end. I think you deserve a little reward. That\u2019s what makes society beautiful, am I right?\u201dAs I went through my pockets, Jung Yura\u2019s expression crumpled even further. I then took a handful of gold coins and dropped them all to the floor. Blood dripped from Yura\u2019s lips, as she had been biting at them too intensely.In addition to this. tears had also started running down the woman\u2019s cheeks.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we manage our expressions into something more fitting? Hm?\u201d\u201cYes, Yura. It\u2019s a gift from oppa, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dWatching her pick up the gold from the floor in such a pitiful manner made me smile. It was amusing as to how easily one could fall from her pedestal.I knew this was not the type of lesson-giving a morally-inept person would choose to take, but I knew this was the only way to make Jung Yura truly learn.To beat the enemy, you must be willing to be as crafty as you can without deserting your values.This whole, messy situation wasn\u2019t over just yet, but I was going to severe my relationship with Jung Yura right at this moment.\u201cIt was fun while it lasted. You can leave anytime you want.\u201dPerhaps Yura would never recover from this. I couldn\u2019t see any large guild wanting to invest in her, even in the far future.As hope is great, so is despair.One may think that there\u2019s a rainbow after the rain, that there\u2019s pleasure after a bout of suffering, but the truth was \u2013 society didn\u2019t work that way.Even if her suffering might end, that would still be ten, or twenty years away. However, I knew that Jung Yura would continually lust for that day.\u2018It\u2019s only human to, after all.\u2019What kind of life she would live after all the hate has died down, I would never know. What I did know is that, wherever she might end up with, in a slum or prostitute village, she would always remember\u2026\u2018She chose to fight the wrong enemy.\u2019As she slowly left the parlor, Lee Jihye began to speak once more.\u201cAre you satisfied now, oppa?\u201d\u201cHm, only by half. I hope you can tell me what it is you\u2019re capable of doing.\u201d\u201cSure. You will probably be satisfied.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I start with our requirements first?\u201d\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d\u201cWe would like you to make an official statement.\u201d\u201cElaborate further.\u201d\u201cWe just need you to say that you\u2019ve received a sincere apology from Jung Yura of the Black Swans, and that we\u2019ve managed to resolve the misunderstandings. You also have to mention that you have never been physically threatened\u2026 I would be really grateful if you could say all of that. Other than that, you can think of what to say on your own\u2026 Well, it doesn\u2019t matter what you say as long as it calms the situation down.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 No matter what I say, though, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that easy.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, I would also like you to comment on the positive changes within the Black Swan.\u201d\u201cUsing me as your publicity vehicle, now are you?\u201d\u201cOf course we are. Many people have started to associate your name, Lee Kiyoung, as a symbol of resistance\u2026 Maybe in a little while, you will even get a title. I know there is an image you wish to maintain, so we won\u2019t ask you to add any more details. It\u2019s almost like saying that you\u2019ve changed a large guild. You have won. Wouldn\u2019t that sound nice?\u201d\u201cVictory, huh\u2026\u201d Despite myself, I began to smile at the thought.The only reason why the Black Swan had to reform in the first place was because various political issues had revealed themselves to be true. Of course, the real spark that ignited the change would remain to be unknown to me, but I highly doubted they would have strived for change if an internal problem did not occur within the guild. These thoughts simply made me laugh.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the truth is. What\u2019s important is that you let them know of your victory.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I laughed.\u201d\u201cWell, we won\u2019t do anything to endanger you, so rest assured we will not harm your current position. We\u2019re just asking for you to think of our guild in return.\u201d\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d\u201cPlease remember our time back in the tutorial dungeon, yeah?\u201dAn amused smile spread onto my face. I could care less about that.\u201cIs there another requirement?\u201d\u201cYes, although this one might be a little out of your authority\u2026 I would like you to promote a Red Mercenary, Black Swan, and Blue alliance, since we\u2019re actually pursuing the possibility of this happening. I\u2019d like you to officially announce this as well. It won\u2019t be a bad story either, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cYou mean you want to use this to expand your influence within the guild?\u201d\u201cYeah. Of course, you don\u2019t have to announce this right away, for the current situation is still cluttered. However, I would like you to hint at the friendly atmosphere, that you\u2019re maintaining an amicable relationship with the Black Swans. That sort of thing will suffice.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be asking for a lot. I hope you have enough rewards in store for it.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. All items, materials, and goods obtained from the Garden of Terror will go to you individually, not to the guild. Likewise, the stakes and land documents of the dungeons that have been attacked will go to you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about what kind of reaction the public will have about me getting all that.\u201d\u201cOfficially, we will make it look like we donated these to you.\u201d\u201cAh, I understand.\u201d\u201cThe real contents that you will receive will not be made known to the public.\u201dThe fact that Lee Jihye had thought about this so thoroughly surprised me greatly. If the public knew this, they would be outraged, saying we used the power of the media for self-benefit.\u201cAnyway, even if they find out, you have the power to rectify the masses.\u201dShe was right. Several from the media were already on my side. Even if they did find out, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to fix the situation. As it was, Lindel was on the side of Red and Blue now, and it was only natural for the Black Swans to try and find any means to fix this.\u201cThere will also be definite support given to Kiyoung\u2019s party by our guild.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this already too generous?\u201d\u201cIs it? I thought it was just adequate. If we want to impress or be on good terms with somebody, we must be prepared for the sacrifice.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this, honestly speaking.\u201dAlthough I wasn\u2019t expecting it, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Lee Jihye was dependent on me, too. If my position rose, so would hers.In other words, we had ourselves a win-win relationship. Though it wasn\u2019t a healthy relationship, I couldn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t a bad one. There were many things I could achieve through this.\u201cIf you have anything else you want, tell us, and we will see if we can offer it.\u201d\u201cYou can think about that on your own. There is always a limit as to what a guild can offer and what direction it will take, so I\u2019ll leave that in your own hands.\u201d\u201cThat sounds like you\u2019re trying to test us.\u201d\u201cNo. Honestly, I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m doing this to this extent. Of course, the behavior of the Black Swans still needs to be justified, but this feels a little excessive. I\u2019m not the only one who should be compensated, right? The Red Mercenaries are also involved in this matter.\u201d\u201cIt feels a little embarrassing to say this, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m curious. I know you\u2019re too logical to rely on feelings of the past. I wish you could just tell me what you really want.\u201dA silence ensued then. Lee Jihye\u2019s expression remained unchanged. There was no sign of embarrassment on her features.She then started to speak calmly. Of course, her answer was just as unexpected.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what I told you before?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI like ambitious men.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t joke around.\u201dI gazed at her firmly upon saying this, but had to do a double-take. Although Lee Jihye was smiling, she certainly didn\u2019t look like she was playing around.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m joking?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me tell you an interesting story.\u201dSlowly, I nodded. I felt like it was only right to let her.\u201cHave you ever heard of anecdotes about the former US President Clinton? It\u2019s all fictional, but it\u2019s still very interesting\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I have not.\u201dAfter a slight pause, Lee Jihye nodded and began to explain. \u201cBill Clinton and Hillary Clinton once went to a gas station during the Clinton era of presidency. News is that Hillary had a hot, steamy affair with someone from that gas station.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting story.\u201d\u201cAs it turned out, the man at the gas station was Hillary\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2026 On the way back, while having a conversation about him, Bill Clinton was a bit spiteful. He said that if she had still been dating him, she would have also been working at a gas station\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think Hillary\u2019s answer to those words was?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShe told him, \u201cNo, that person would have been the President of the United States, not you.\u201dI straightened. Now that was definitely an interesting story. I knew what Lee Jihye meant with this, too. She was indirectly saying I could achieve much more if she were to be by my side.\u201cPersonally, I want to add one more prerequisite to that story.\u201d\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\u201cHow much ambition does a man have?\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019\u201cA man is an animal that depends on the workings of a man, but a man who doesn\u2019t have the ambition to act isn\u2019t very attractive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cDo you understand my position right now?\u201d\u201cOf course. You\u2019re considered the Red Mercenary Queen\u2019s gigolo. Are you already satisfied with that? You\u2019re also pampering with a bomb known as Jung Hayan. However, the attractiveness of a woman is not determined solely by her appearance or strength.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, oppa, I\u2019m not desperate enough to drool after you. I\u2019m just saying I have what it takes to climb from the bottom of the chain all the way to the top. If that\u2019s a process that can ensure my success, I\u2019ll welcome it. I know that the ultimate choice is a woman like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am a woman who can turn any man into a king.\u201d\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019I felt so embarrassed that I couldn\u2019t even speak. I knew Lee Jihye was the Selfish Ambition type, but I had never expected it to reach this extent.I was more surprised with her confidence than her declaration. In terms of assessment, Lee Jihye\u2019s abilities were certainly poor. The same went for her talent.Of course, Lee Jihye was unaware of her potential limit, but she was probably already aware that she was somewhat below average.Nevertheless, my female counterpart seemed to possess unwavering confidence.\u2018What\u2026\u2019I did not know when she had started to act like this, but if I was to make a guess, I would say she had been planning to since the beginning. I simply didn\u2019t know how to react to her words.As I pondered over her words, Lee Jihye had inched closer to me and had now begun to stroke my hair.\u201cWhy me, though?\u201d\u201cOh, now it\u2019s time to make a reason up\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you need a reason, I\u2019ve never forgotten how you told me we\u2019d see each other again.\u201dThough she was unbearably close to me, I knew she knew better than to try for a kiss.\u201cThe story ends here. Please consider not only what you\u2019ve offered in terms of this situation, but also what we\u2019ve discussed personally, oppa.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, Jihye.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but don a slightly crumpled expression.However, looking at the smile plastered on Lee Jihye\u2019s face, I knew she liked how our conversation had taken place.It was when she got up and opened the door did the ominous feeling start to blossom from within me.The door swung open to reveal Jung Hayan, who apparently had been waiting outside.Unlike me, who felt surprised, Lee Jihye did not seem to exhibit any form of shock or fear upon seeing the other woman there.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Miss Hayan.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 It\u2019s been a long time\u2026\u201d\u2018Fuck.\u2019\u201cI heard you\u2019ve been dating Kiyoung? Hyunsung and Deokgu are also doing well, right?\u201d\u201cYes, they are.\u201d\u201cOh, congratulations! Seeing two people in love always makes me smile. I think you will see me more often in the future\u2026 Please do take care of Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cOf course, I will.\u201dJung Hayan sported an unreadable expression, but I knew she had not heard what we had just talked about. The room we had been staying in had magical barriers set in place for the sole purpose of warding off eavesdroppers, after all.However, due to the expression on Hayan\u2019s face, I knew that Lee Jihye must have made a gesture or expression of some sort that I couldn\u2019t see from my position all the way here.\u2018Shit.\u2019As Jung Hayan began to look my way with an accusatory expression, Lee Jihye simply shot me a smile and started walking away.The world was indeed wide, with many women to choose from.Nevertheless\u2026I could not, for the life of me, figure out why I had to get these two, crazy women.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was not possible to know exactly why the war broke out in the past, or, to be precise, in a future that had not yet occurred in this timeline.At that time, I was far away from the center of the continent. Such an event had not been part of my expectations.There had also been various issues with the tutorial and even with other ideologies associated with this world. In such cases, people generally looked forward to the outcome rather than the reasons behind such actions. Small conflicts that had accumulated over the years soon sparked a war that engulfed the entire continent.Several groups began to turn on each other, forgoing their faith in their own beliefs. Instead, they began to focus solely on undermining those they deemed as enemies. Their malice bred more malice, their wrath bred anger, and their attempts at exacting revenge bred hatred.This was the war between the Earthlings and the Aboriginal people \u2013 a battle between the newcomers and the natives.Everyone immersed themselves in the war and did everything they could to enslave or slaughter their enemies.It was not difficult to witness such conflicts everywhere I went, but it was like no one wanted to address the elephant in the room. I, too, pretended not to know a thing about this. As a result, the distrust only grew, and it was impossible to find stable grounds to form treaties, alliances, or to even come to an agreement.Because of such events, the Archmage, who had been the envy of everyone, eventually hung himself. Japanese shamans were slaughtered. The Mercenary Queen had her life regularly threatened. Those they called their family, even those who belonged in clans, lost their lives.Many of those who were called heroes were killed or destroyed.The holy sword of the chosen warrior also lost its light.As time passed and the coalitions eventually broke down, the first part of this meaningless war ended with countless casualties.Karma had come for its debt. This was all humanity\u2019s fault.\u201cA war is different from a battle.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cHonestly, I will admit that you are strong, to the point where I \u2013 nor those who are beneath me \u2013 cannot defeat you. No matter how annoying this is to admit, this fact is undeniable.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 you are human\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I am human. I thought I would be unrecognizable because of the mask\u2026 But I heard that the genius prosecutor who is praised by everyone looks different, too. I heard that you are protected by magical power, but the quality of that power in itself is not good.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a feeling. You look a little bit different from them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell if that is a praise or an insult.\u201d\u201cWhy did you choose to stand on their side?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only rational for me to choose the side that\u2019s more likely to succeed.\u201d\u201cMany humans have died because of this!\u201d\u201cI know. However, the act of humans killing each other isn\u2019t new. These people want to maintain the population in a peaceful and standardized place. They believe that this would be more beneficial in the long run.\u201d\u201cYou betrayed humanity.\u201d\u201cWell, I obviously wasn\u2019t the only one to do so. You know that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you feel any remorse?\u201d\u201cI do not know. My heart did ache when I had to kill a civilian, and it definitely hurt when I had to kill that cute, little wizard who loved me endlessly. Such an innocent girl\u2019s life was wasted just for loving someone she happened to meet by chance. I never even thought I\u2019d end my own life. Why did I have to do that? There were so many things I still wanted to do. I guess I couldn\u2019t take the guilt.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIt hurt even when I watched the Empire\u2019s Queen kill the very people she loved. However, it had to be done. It was necessary. My heart broke even more when I saw the warrior who had to watch my loved one die. He seemed to think you had betrayed him. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you? Who are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that. I didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d react so passionately. I guess it\u2019s different for someone who doesn\u2019t have anything to do with these deaths.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t keep insisting that you\u2019re a good person, Kim Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cYou hypocritical piece of shit.\u201d\u201cI asked you who you are.\u201d\u201cI told you, you didn\u2019t need to know. Even if I tell you, you wouldn\u2019t remember anyway. What\u2019s important now is for you to survive.\u201d\u201cKill.\u201d\u201cStop pretending to be noble, scum. You don\u2019t have a choice. Of course, I know it will be a little hard for you. So let\u2019s do this, Kim Hyunsung. I\u2019m not a bad person either, so I\u2019ll find a way for you to ease your conscience. Kill that motherfucker gasping next to you. Otherwise, your beloved will die. Did you really think I didn\u2019t know? How funny. You two have done it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYou son of a bitch\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me say this again. You don\u2019t have a choice. If you refuse, she\u2019ll be handed over to a bunch of inhumane perverts who would gladly spend the rest of their days enjoying what she has to offer. You\u2019d better make a choice before my patience reaches its limit\u2026 And you know I keep my promises. I\u2019m a man of my word, unlike someone here\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPuh!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLook, eunni. I said I\u2019d do it. Of course, I\u2019m going to keep my promise. I\u2019m going to let him live, and I\u2019m going to let the woman go. It\u2019s a little wasteful to kill her now. Anyway, you can\u2019t die here. I\u2019ll make sure to talk to my superiors about it. I\u2019ll be right back so we can continue our little chat, my dear best friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGood job, Kim Hyunsung. I don\u2019t really know what to say\u2026 So I guess I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dQuazzik!\u201cAh!\u201dIn an instant, my eyes had opened. My entire body was soaked in sweat.Amidst my panting, I struggled to recognize the ceiling\u2019s layout, gradually doing my best to assess the rest of my surroundings.\u2018I\u2019m back\u2026 Or am I?\u2019It was a question I asked myself several times a day.This was not the place I was in before \u2013 this was my room back in the Blue Guild. I could see a sword hanging from one side of the room. A similar-looking sword was also on the nearby table.Judging from the minimalistic interior, I could attest that this was my room. I could no longer smell blood from my body as I had in my dream.Instead of the screams that had enveloped my senses, what I heard now was the cheerful chirping of the birds, signaling the start of another day. Instead of sensing dark and ominous magic, I could feel warm, cozy sunlight pouring down from the crack in my window.It had been a very long time since I last dreamt about the past.I could still feel the unpleasant emotions coursing through me as I plunged a knife into the chest of a dying colleague. Even the atmosphere and the conversation that took place within the dream felt very vivid to me.It was no wonder I felt so dirty. My body had unknowingly filled itself up with power and hardened its defenses. My breathing had quickened, and my head hurt. A lot of thoughts swirled in my head as I tried to calm myself down.However, as memories from the past began to present themselves to me, I couldn\u2019t stop sweating, struggling to find my balance.\u201cHah\u2026 Hah\u2026\u201d I found myself holding my own trembling body.\u2018It\u2019s different now\u2026\u2019Of course, it was different now.I had prevented any accidents from happening in the tutorial dungeon and saved tons of people.\u2018It\u2019s different now\u2026\u2019I corrected my previous mistakes as much as possible. I had atoned for my mistakes.\u201cThis is different. This isn\u2019t like before\u2026\u201dI found Jung Hayan right from the start and got Kim Ye-ri to join the team. Being able to kill Jung Jinho in the tutorial dungeon was a really big achievement.Of course, I still had to find many people and had some more work to do, but I felt as if I had been doing quite well so far.It was different now. Simply saying that the current situation had improved was not enough.The world I was in now had indeed changed. However, it wasn\u2019t from my actions. Someone else was responsible for it.\u2018Lee Kiyoung\u2026\u2019I had not noticed both Park Deokgu and Lee Kiyoung the first time around. They possessed the talent I didn\u2019t know I was looking for. Deokgu was someone who focused on his training with all his might, and Kiyoung was responsible for managing every little detail of our party. It was hard to believe that an alchemist could have so much worth, but Lee Kiyoung\u2019s true value surpassed what most people expected him to have.\u2018He\u2019s a capable person.\u2019No, simply calling him capable was not enough. He was the type of person who could perform miracles even when he acted as a passer-by in most scenarios. He had the Blue Guild members play right into his game and even managed to form an agreement with the Red Mercenary Queen. In addition to this, he also succeeded in recruiting Sun Hee-young, a remarkable talent, into the guild.I felt like he contributed more to the party than I ever did.That wasn\u2019t even everything he had done for us.He was also responsible for the alliance between the Black Swans and the Red Mercenaries, an alliance that would have been unimaginable if he hadn\u2019t sparked the change.\u2018The future itself has changed.\u2019I could say that it had changed for the better. The war that had transpired in the past had killed so many talented people.In the first place, many non-combatant soldiers were caught up in a power struggle between officials, regardless of their will. It was only natural for us to lay the groundwork for these people to grow now than to have them suffer through all that again in this timeline.I knew positive changes would come, but I hadn\u2019t expected it to reach this extent.They called this the Butterfly Effect, where a single flap from a butterfly could cause a typhoon to happen.I could hardly believe it myself. The little friendships I had formed slowly became responsible for transforming Lindel for the better.Of course, I also knew that changing the future too much wasn\u2019t a good thing, but what could go wrong, right?\u2018Anyway, I have to stock up.\u2019Now was the time for me to cultivate my strength and make sure I do my job right. As I was thinking of all of these, a voice came from outside my room.\u201cOh, hyung.\u201d\u201cYes, Doekgu?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat breakfast. Everyone else is waiting.\u201d\u201cSorry, I overslept\u2026 I\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d\u201cWhen you go to sleep early and still wake up late, doesn\u2019t that seem a bit annoying?\u201d\u201cI guess you can say that.\u201d\u201cYou had a dirty dream, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m only kidding. Everyone\u2019s waiting, so come down quickly.\u201d\u201cI will. Thank you for informing me.\u201dAlthough indescribable anxiety soared in the corner of the heart, I knew I could change what would happen in this timeline. I wanted a life filled with no regrets. I wanted to atone for all my wrongdoings.\u2018It can be different.\u2019I could change the future.That was the whole reason why I came back here.\u201cForgive me for being late.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cThen, let me explain the direction the party should take in the future.\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cPlease, keep eating. I want everyone to be comfortable as I explain.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWe need to focus on spec-ups, stats, and job changes.\u201d\u201cYou mean we have to get new jobs?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis didn\u2019t seem like a bad timing.I felt like our party had reached a standstill, and now Kim Hyunsung wanted to step things up.It was not an exaggeration to say that a few external factors had been the cause of our hindrance.After all, Lee Jihye\u2019s work alongside the Red Mercenary and Black Swan Guild were in the final stages.\u2018You have won. It\u2019s your victory. Lindel will be as peaceful as usual, and safer than ever. Let\u2019s do our best to resolve each problem that comes.\u2019It was broadcasted that I had accepted Jung Yura\u2019s apology, but I knew this would not be enough to calm the public down. However, this did not mean that nothing had changed.In the face of media agitation, the public cheered for their victory and was satisfied with the results. They were delighted that one individual dared to fight against the larger guilds\u2019 oppression and came out victorious.Of course, this was a satisfactory result for me as well.A few days after my presentation, the Black Swan pushed through with the reorganization of their command system and began giving donations to novice adventurers.Though they had come from such criticism, no one judged their choice of action. They were satisfied with how all the guild executives had apologized in public. Until then, there were no such large guilds that dared to lower their pride, so this response pleased the public.If there was anything that hadn\u2019t been resolved yet, it was Jung Hayan\u2019s reaction upon seeing Lee Jihye.Although she did not actively express how she felt, I knew her anxiety had gone up. This manifested itself in the form of hovering around me all the time to ease her worries.Simply put, she had clung to me more tightly than ever.\u2018This isn\u2019t good at all.\u2019I was not happy with this change in Hayan\u2019s behavior.She would always ask me, \u201cWhere are you going, oppa?\u201d or \u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201dHer questions themselves didn\u2019t bother me. However, I knew this new type of obsession would slowly but surely work against me.Jung Hayan must have felt like a connection had formed between Lee Jihye and me on that particular day. Lee Jihye must have riled her up on purpose by pretending to be unaware of the tension between her and me.If the system itself recognized Lee Jihye as my soulmate, then Jung Hayan was bound to notice as well.At this point, she felt warier of Lee Jihye than she was of Cha Hee-ra, the Mercenary Queen who had brought up the pretense of being my lover.I knew I had to control Jung Hayan sometime soon. At this rate, I\u2019d be hindered by her silly emotions forever.Anyway, now was the best time for us to focus on our growth. There were no more external factors hindering us, except for the old lunatics still hanging around within the Blue Guild.We had already formed a good alliance with two powerful guilds, had gained dungeon and hunting experience, and the public was on our side.Simply put, we were ready to start growing.\u201cYou might already know, but there are two prerequisites for changing jobs. One is to accumulate experience points by hunting and to repeat certain actions specific to a job, and the same goes for raising stats. You know that using magic power will increase your energy, and using muscle power will increase your strength.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cSince the last dungeon trip, it was crucial for us to take a break, but now I feel like we should start training once more. It would be ideal if everyone here grows up to at least Sun Hee-young\u2019s level now. No, we should have the same specs as the people we had gone on the expedition with. At least it\u2019s time for us to earn a beginner\u2019s title.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAt least three or four job advancements and 60 key stats. That\u2019s all I ask of you all.\u201dThis was going to be quite a problem. I knew Kim Hyunsung\u2019s remarks were aimed at little Kim Ye-ri and me. I knew Kim Hyunsung would have noticed that I lacked potential.Jung Hayan\u2019s magical power had already exceeded the 40s, and Kim Hyunsung himself was already on the level of 50s. There was no need even to mention Sun Hee-young\u2019s stats. Even Park Deokgu had slowly grown from his experiences in the dungeon.In short, the only problems within the party were Kim Ye-ri and me.\u2018Hmm.\u2019Of course, Kim Ye-ri would be stronger, what with her legendary growth potential stats. Narrowing it down, it seemed that the only trouble within the party would be me.Of course, it didn\u2019t mean I was set to be entirely useless. My job as an alchemist was something that made up for my meager magical abilities, and it suited me to some extent.However, it was unreasonable to classify it as a combat occupation.I did not regret choosing to take the path of alchemy, but I had to admit that there were times when I wished I could have taken Warlock instead. Sure, there would be a limited growth cap, but I would at least be stronger than I was now.\u201cHngg\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be ideal if all of you could align your skills with your third job within a month.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s easier said than done. I don\u2019t know how exactly to get a job, but even training to raise stats is a slow process. There may be some differences if we go hunting, but\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps there might.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll start with hunting. I\u2019m not going to leave the city until we\u2019ve completed what I\u2019ve told you all to do.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cThere will be five people going on the expedition. Everyone except Kiyoung will be going.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, hyung\u2026?\u201dAt this, I had stiffened. To me, it sounded as if I was being forced to get off the Hyunsung bus, which had proved to be a comfortable ride for me this entire time.\u201cWell, you can\u2019t do that.\u201dArrogant thoughts had begun to swirl in my head. Was he trying to turn me into a non-combat soldier? Or was he trying to push me off the main party?This felt like a stupid idea.Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan looked even more surprised than I did. Even Sun Hee-young didn\u2019t look happy.Perhaps this was Kim Hyunsung\u2019s way of ensuring that my influence within the party wouldn\u2019t continue to expand, but seeing his cool expression, I knew this wasn\u2019t the case. Knowing Kim Hyun-sung\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t do something like this.I was also a valuable party member and had proven myself countless times.Upon seeing the question plastered on my face, Kim Hyunsung nodded.\u201cThey\u2019ve been very reliant on you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026?\u201d\u201cBoth Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan have grown up in a very comfortable environment. The same is true of Hee-young, who is not used to hunting. Of course, I am not ignoring everyone\u2019s hard work, but all of you have been relying on the psychological stability that Lee Kiyoung\u2019s presence brings.\u201d\u201cPsychological stability?\u201dI understood what Kim Hyunsung was talking about. It made a lot of sense.\u201cTo put it simply, Kiyoung\u2019s presence is preventing your growth. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit it, but I\u2019m convinced that my existence is also having an adverse effect. Unlike Kiyoung, I will have to join this expedition with you guys, but I\u2019m not going to involve myself too much. I thought it would be better if there were only four people, with the exception of Kiyoung and I, to get through the situation.\u201d\u2018Ah, I overestimated this too much\u2026\u2019What had been troubling me this entire time proved to give way to a completely different interpretation from what I originally thought.It wasn\u2019t that I was not growing up to standards \u2013 it was that I was impeding everyone\u2019s growth.I wondered if Kim Hyunsung was overestimating me, but it was true that Jung Hayan and Park Deokgu depended on me a lot. However, I never would have thought they would become so dependent to the point that they would stop growing.\u201cKiyoung doesn\u2019t look convinced.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not. Hayan and Deokgu\u2026\u201d\u201cYou contribute more to the party than you\u2019re aware of, Kiyoung. I don\u2019t know if others have noticed it, but I have. To put it simply, an expedition without you would result in a fantastic failure for the party.\u201d\u201cHow can that be\u2026? How am I to spend a month without all of you\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe are not children, hyung. Of course, I admit that Kiyoung is great, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI am speaking as the leader of this party. Kiyoung will not be participating, and that\u2019s final. And though I will be joining you, only the four of you will be responsible for hunting and attacking.\u201dKim Hyunsung had an unreadable expression on his face, but I couldn\u2019t help but nod.\u2018He has a point.\u2019Although I felt a little puzzled, I knew that Kim Hyunsung had made the right choice in deciding which direction of growth the party should take.My party members might not understand, but both Deokgu and Hayan needed to learn what to do without waiting for my say-so.It was hard to believe that I would be separated from them for a month, but I also couldn\u2019t find it in me to refute Kim Hyunsung\u2019s decision.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I agree with Hyunsung. If that helps in your growth direction, I think it would be a good idea to do just that.\u201dAfter all, the problem wasn\u2019t me; it was them.I knew that if I got off the bus, my party members would act like lost children. They needed to learn how to act on their own now instead of facing that problem later on.However, if they grew stronger to the point that I would not be able to catch up, this would be a large problem.\u2018That should not happen.\u2019If I had been excluded, then there must be a consolation reward in store for someone such as I who harbored such horrible stats.I needed to find a way to increase my stats as well as get me a new job.It was a far-off theory, but perhaps I could squeeze a reward out of this sudden exclusion.\u201cIn the meantime, I\u2026\u201dHowever, upon seeing Kim Hyunsung look my way with an expression filled with trust, I knew I had just been hoping.\u201cThe same is true of Kiyoung. You just need to focus on increasing your stats and changing your job for the whole month.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\u201cI advise you to start as quickly as possible. Of course, please do not help Kiyoung in this process. Everyone else should focus on their departure. Please do not worry about this, and just focus on your own growth.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dThis man was giving me so much trust. I didn\u2019t know what I had done to earn it, but I didn\u2019t know how I should feel about it, either.\u201cThank you for understanding. I believe in you, Lee Kiyoung.\u201d\u2018Do not believe in me too much, you bastard\u2026\u2019It took all of my willpower not to give him this reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was, of course, a good thing to earn the trust of my leader. However, I was not too fond of this particular type of trust.I didn\u2019t know how to evaluate myself, but if I were to describe it, I would be a child who still needed Kim Hyunsung\u2019s warm love and attention, especially when it came to growth.I did not need to ask why I needed to raise my abilities and get another job, for I understood the urgency, but I was not too fond of this overestimation.\u2018At least doubt me a little, you bastard\u2026\u2019Although I had painted the image of being fine on my own, I didn\u2019t particularly appreciate being put in this kind of situation. At the same time, I knew what Kim Hyunsung was thinking.\u2018This expedition will most likely end in failure.\u2019This was because my fellow party members were indeed highly dependent on the psychological stability my presence offered.\u201cIf oppa is not going, then I\u2019m not going to go, either. I will never want to go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe problem was Jung Hayan. As the expedition date fast approached, she would come up with all sorts of excuses to try and be excluded from the expedition as well.On the first day since our discussion, Kim Hyunsung immediately moved to achieve the goals he had cooked up for the whole party.He thought that if he managed to change his job or achieved desirable stats during the few days of preparing for the expedition, he would not have to leave the expedition. Of course, there was still the matter of Jung Hayan not wanting to take part, but he would have to find another solution for that.\u2018Of course.\u2019Achieving legendary status would be an impossible feat to achieve in a very short time. Every member had shown astonishing growth in such short periods, but it was apparent that we would not reach our target this time around.Jung Hayan, on the other hand, began to exhibit behavior similar to someone who was anticipating death.During the preparation time, she eventually went through the five stages: denial, anger, compromise, depression, and, eventually, acceptance.It didn\u2019t take too long for her to undergo the first step. She began to deny the fact that she would have to leave me for a month. In her mind, what Kim Hyunsung said was probably a joke.On the other hand, Park Deokgu and Sun Hee-young began to set their minds toward the upcoming expedition, packing everything they would need for the hunt. It was then that Jung Hayan was forced to face reality.Anger came soon enough.\u2018\u2026\u2019She had begun to hate Kim Hyunsung, who was responsible for the sudden expedition schedule. I felt worried for a while, but it didn\u2019t seem like her anger would give her any intention to kill him. Somewhere from deep within, she still regarded Kim Hyunsung with respect.In short, Jung Hayan spent this stage screaming in her room and exhibiting a neurotic expression. She did not forget to let out her pent-up anger to Kim Ye-ri, either, seeing as the child was the weakest target among the party aside from me. I knew she was only doing it to try and find an excuse to be excluded from the expedition.She tried to find faults with the kid and took every opportunity she could find to criticize. In short, Jung Hayan was being Jung Hayan.It got to the point where she approached Park Deokgu to talk behind Kim Ye-ri\u2019s back. Considering Jung Hayan\u2019s personality, this didn\u2019t feel right at all.When she entered the next stage \u2013 compromise \u2013 there were a lot of talks.She tried to give various suggestions, appearing to be possessed.\u201cI can really work hard. I can increase my stats just as well without having to go on this expedition. So please\u2026\u201dThat was one.\u201cHow about we all go together for a week? That will work better.\u201dThat was another.\u201cI think oppa should come, but he should just watch over us, just like Hyunsung.\u201dHowever, I knew her suggestions wouldn\u2019t be accepted. Whether she liked it or not, she had to go through this expedition without me, and I had to stay back and work independently. I, too, acknowledged the need for the lack of my presence for this expedition, and so I stayed quiet.Sun Hee-young and Park Deokgu reacted in the same manner, but that was less dramatic to an extent. There was no incentive for a formal protest to occur, but this proved to be quite the trigger for Park Deokgu.It was just a guess, but I thought that Park Deokgu was also in the compromise stage. It came to the point where they would approach me at random intervals.Then the most difficult stage came \u2013 depression.She noticeably began to lose weight and often spent the night in tears. She also often said her physical situation was chipping away and that she wouldn\u2019t join the expedition because of it.\u2018I really hate it\u2026\u2019Slowly, the periods where she would mutter to herself shortened. This stage proved to be tiring not only for Jung Hayan but also for me.I tired myself out, trying my best to calm her down.Of course, I tried to soothe her with the end-of-expedition rewards she would be receiving and the welcoming I would give her once she got back, but the fact that she would be away from me for a month was enough to dull those comforts.I knew Jung Hayan appreciated my efforts to comfort her, but it only made her feel more depressed. The sweeter our time was together, the more bitter our time apart would be.The last step eventually came \u2013 but it did not come with consent.Since I had observed her go through all the steps, I expected her to undergo acceptance as well eventually, but it seemed like this was not the case.Simply put, she was forced to accept this reality. No matter how much she cried, the plan was set in motion and could not be stopped. This was the decision of the party as a whole, and it was also mine. Jung Hayan had no choice but to follow.If a month-long separation already garnered such intense reactions, I did not want to think about the possibility of being separated for a year.Apart from meeting me and developing strange tendencies, she was not accustomed to separation. Being someone who lived alone for a long time after being abandoned by my family, I did not mind the change as much as she did.Apart from Jung Hayan\u2019s dramatic schemes, however, everyone else did their part to prepare for the expedition\u2019s day. However, I couldn\u2019t say that they had prepared very well.I didn\u2019t understand why Jung Hayan couldn\u2019t seem to control her mentality well, but it also seemed like Park Deokgu had been acting a bit strange.Sun Hee-young had initially felt stressed, but she had soon begun to think of the expedition and had done her best to prepare for it. I did not know what Kim Ye-ri was thinking, on the other hand.Meanwhile, upon watching everyone try to prepare for the expedition in their way, I did not feel all that anxious about being separated from the party.\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem all that bad, considering.\u2019Of course, something strange felt off about Park Deokgu, Jung Hayan, and Sun Hee-young, since none of them were familiar with the expedition.I knew the stress would be doubled at having a little kid tagging alongside them on the trip, but I didn\u2019t think it would be this much. It seemed that even Kim Hyunsung gradually lost his authoritative hand after our first discussion.\u201cAre you really going to go on the expedition in that state?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s sad, but this is necessary. I know even you have noticed how dependent they have been on you.\u201d\u201cYeah, I have\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll soon realize it once we officially start the expedition.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t felt it as you have been with them this entire time. However, they will soon know what I was talking about during the hunt. If you and I could always be with them, there\u2019d be no problem, but\u2026\u201dI could understand what Kim Hyunsung was talking about.It wasn\u2019t just that we were inexperienced when it came to hunting. Kim Hyunsung also knew that there was a problem with the party\u2019s command system itself.If he and I were there, it would be fine, but the problem was that our party had no backbone. The team would always look to us for guidance, and that in itself impeded their growth. It didn\u2019t matter who among the three \u2013 Park Deokgu, Jung Hayan, or Sun Hee-young \u2013 would take the initiative, but they needed to take the first step in deciding their direction for growth.Even achieving that would be enough.To put it simply, this expedition would be a test for them to determine the next best option for our party.\u2018Will it work?\u2019Honestly, I felt a little skeptical. It wasn\u2019t just the issue of not having them with me, either. It felt like a month was not enough to pack and prepare all the consumables needed for such a trip.All that Kim Ye-ri chose to carry were her bow and arrows.Jung Hayan, on the other hand, was so preoccupied with the thought of not seeing me that most of what she packed were things that would remind her of me.\u2018This\u2026\u2019Many guilds and groups who had invested in our party would surely retract their offers right away if they saw how my team members were acting now.\u201cStill though\u2026 You should prepare all the basic essentials.\u201d\u201cI have the basics prepared. These are things that Deokgu and Hee-young have managed to pack. I am anxious as well, but this is necessary. It is essential that they recognize the difference in this expedition.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThen, we should get going.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAs Hyunsung and I headed out, I caught sight of the rest of our party members, who were all waiting for us to arrive.Although Kim Hyunsung was carrying a large bag of his own, he already knew that all of this could quite possibly be for naught. I couldn\u2019t help but sigh as I caught sight of Park Deokgu lugging about all the things he thought would be necessary for the expedition.Upon seeing me, my fellow party members began to express their sentiments.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, hyung. We won\u2019t even take a month!\u201dI doubted that. I honestly thought it would take double the time to accomplish their goals.\u201cPlease take care of everything while I\u2019m gone, Mr. Kiyoung. I feel bad that I won\u2019t be able to volunteer for the duration of this trip.\u201dI expected to hear that from Hee-young.\u201cOppa\u2026 Oppa\u2026\u201dI wasn\u2019t surprised when Jung Hayan rushed towards me and hugged me with tears in her eyes.\u201cYou should be careful in the meantime, and\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Hayan.\u201dI was more worried about her.Perhaps I was worried that she might meet someone else who she would deem worthy of her affections, but right now, all that could be focused on was the pain of being separated.Upon Kim Hyunsung\u2019s command, for everyone to start, I began to push Jung Hayan away. However, I never expected her to fall.It seemed like she was doing her best to garner enough strength even just to stay standing. I couldn\u2019t find it in me to continue gazing at a face filled with snot and tears.\u201cI will be back soon.\u201d\u201cPlease do not worry.\u201d\u2018Good luck.\u2019This expedition would surely not be a comfortable bus trip for everyone involved. I knew that Kim Hyunsung had his work cut out for him.\u2018Perhaps it was a good thing that we didn\u2019t go together.\u2019Only half of me believed in this thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, I felt lonely, but this was a natural reaction that came from a sudden change in environment.Honestly speaking, I felt a little happy. It was undeniable that there were some strange discomforts that came with having my fellow members around.My personal time was always cut very short because of Jung Hayan\u2019s ever-present badgering, Park Deokgu\u2019s surprise visits, and Sun Hee-young\u2019s constant requests to volunteer. At that point, I was rather grateful Kim Ye-ri didn\u2019t talk much. If she did, then I would most likely have zero percent privacy.I\u2019d have to do all the basic chores myself for the time being, but it also felt like a vacation at the same time.\u2018However, the fact that we are on a time crunch still presents a different type of urgency.\u2019In order to get the third job and stats that Kim Hyunsung desired, I would have to start moving quickly. I didn\u2019t know what it would take to spark my growth, but I at least had a few ideas.In fact, I found it hard to believe that I was in a hard situation.I had hero-grade alchemy equipment, numerous catalysts and materials, and my eventual growth was already confirmed.My intelligence stats were no problem at all, but my problem now lay in raising all my other stats \u2013 which was a feat that seemed impossible to do.This was why my third job was important.I hadn\u2019t thought about going for a combat-type job for my next one, but it seemed that following a party\u2019s growth with a job that solely depended on intelligence would be a hard thing to do.As we continued to grow, I had to think of other ways to expand my horizons. There had to be answers to my current problems. I had to find a way to get a combat-type job without losing my identity as an alchemist.\u2018First of all, Homunculus\u2026\u2019In fact, this would also lead me to other opportunities. Being able to deal with a creature I could treat as my pet without having to consume magic would be very advantageous at this point.In fact, Ramus Tucker\u2019s Introduction to Alchemy dealt with Homunculus in great depth.[Homunculus means an artificially created creature that does not need a mother\u2019s womb. Since each school has different interpretations on the subject, I will at least define Homunculus as a unique creation.Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that it is like the chimera. Unlike the chimera that creates something out of Yu, the concept of Homunculus that our alchemist deals with is the concept of creating something out of nothing.]Simply put, homunculus was the creation of artificial life.Of course, one wouldn\u2019t know what it looked like, or how to create one. Even Tucker\u2019s book contained nothing but theories on the subject.Although the chimera was explained comparatively in detail, chimera, a concept that manipulated genes, and Homunculus, a creature that was created, had distinct properties.Perhaps for Tucker, Homunculus was an uncharted territory.No, if he had actually managed to create new life, then he wouldn\u2019t have been talking about the possibility of it in the first place. Perhaps one could think of the concept as something divine.\u2018The second option is to create a potion\u2026\u2019If one were to ask me if I would start relying on potions to master my combat ability, I would shake my head. This was just, after all, another of my theories.\u2018Can you put magic in potions?\u2019The principle of magic in this continent could be briefly explained. One simply had to build the Tower of Magic and cast a spell that would bring it into reality. The completed spell would stay within the user\u2019s arm or mind, and only the user would be able to trigger it.Was it possible to put a Spell of Staying within a potion or a specific item, not on your body?This was, after all, just an experiment. I knew some items could contain magic. However, this kind of item would not be a man-made item; it would already be a finished product.In fact, some magicians have used enchantment magic on select items, but the effects proved to be lacking and severely inefficient. This study had stopped because the cost was greater than the result.If an alchemist can use alchemy magic to contain disposable magic with such tenacity, then he or she would certainly achieve a very good commercial result as well.\u2018The third is going for the chimera option\u2026\u2019Making a pet by manipulating cells or genes was highly possible. In fact, I was thinking that this would be the simplest way. In this world, monsters were an object of high interest.To put it simply, it was supposedly quite easy to manufacture a chimera.Some monsters had very similar genes, and even if they underwent experiments and had their genes manipulated, they could still come out alive.However, this job would not be made possible with an alchemist\u2019s magic, but by a warlock\u2019s.The problem with this plan was that I would not be able to control a chimera using my own magic.Of course, I could find a creature that has barely grown yet and try to cultivate it, but in the end, I couldn\u2019t guarantee that this would be a successful venture.I didn\u2019t want to get eaten up by my very own chimera.\u2018In addition\u2026\u2019There were many directions I could take. However, I had to remember that this was a matter of survival for me.Although the risks were high, I\u2019d also thought about experimenting on my own body, and I\u2019ve also actually thought of ways to make the Sage\u2019s Stone. However, I didn\u2019t think these would work well.It was time to postpone all my other activities and actually find a way to spark my growth.Of course, not all of this could be done in a short time. I didn\u2019t want to end up wasting time with failed experiments. I had to move as efficiently as possible.\u2018Perhaps I should get help\u2026\u2019It was not a bad idea. It was common sense to research or seek help if there were questions that you couldn\u2019t answer on your own.Magic and Alchemy were two different branches, but they all came from the same roots. It was the same for the other jobs.At this rate, it would be best if I could seek help from an experienced magic-user.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t the Magic Guild be the best option?\u2019I felt like they could become faithful workers in my lab if they were really interested in the Sage\u2019s Stone.Eventually, I felt myself entering the restaurant with crowded thoughts.\u201cAre you eating alone today?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dUpon hearing someone address me, I turned and saw a woman who looked a little younger than I.\u201cAh! I guess this is the first time we\u2019ve talked. I\u2019m Hwang Jeong-yeon, I\u2019m in charge of the second party of the Blue Guild.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nice to meet you! I am\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. You are Alchemist Lee Kiyoung of the seventh party. Am I right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHow was your visit to the Garden of Terror?\u201dIt felt like a random question, but I eventually realized why she had asked.\u2018She\u2019s one of the discoverers.\u2019After discovering the dungeon itself, Hwang Jeong-yeon was probably one of the people who chose to hand it to us instead.\u201cThank you very much for the opportunity. Thanks to you, I had a great experience.\u201d\u201cAs I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019re very quick to notice things.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a compliment. Actually, I feel a little apologetic. It would have been nice if you\u2019d had a purely good experience. I have a friend from the Black Swans who wants to apologize to you.\u201d\u201cAh! No\u2026 I have already received an apology from them, and everything has gone well. I also recognized my own shortcomings in the process.\u201d\u201cAh, that soothes me. It\u2019s my first time talking to someone from the seventh party, and it\u2019s been great so far.\u201d As Hwang Jeong-yeon spoke, her tense expression relaxed. She looked better this way.Her facial features looked a little young, but it somehow reminded me of the old times.\u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve been looking forward to getting to talk to you all, but it seemed like you\u2019ve all been very busy.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d\u201cWe were waiting for the day when we could all have our reunion, but everything has been hectic since you guys came back. The guild has been preoccupied as a whole.\u201d\u201cAh, I heard about that. You entered a hero-grade dungeon.\u201d\u201cYes. It seems that you\u2019ve encountered more troubles than us, though.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHwang Jeong-yeon looked like a wizard to me. Perhaps being on the same job type alerted me of this. Considering the fact that I was talking to the quiet successor and owner of the dungeon we had gone on, a new set of possibilities opened themselves up to me.I didn\u2019t even have to check her stat window. I knew she was a very competent wizard.She did not bother covering up her magical abilities, and there was cleverness in her eyes. Her relaxed personality probably came from her confidence in terms of magical combat.\u2018Hm\u2026 This could be useful\u2026\u2019At this point, I felt like I didn\u2019t even need to ask help from the Magic Guild anymore. I was sure Hwang Jeong-yeon wouldn\u2019t mind if I asked her a few questions.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit this, but I\u2019ve been feeling very disoriented lately.\u201d\u201cOh, I understand. We\u2019ve all been there.\u201d\u201cThere are so many options to choose from, but I don\u2019t know which direction to take\u2026\u201d\u201cI get you. It happens to everyone, most especially for you, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re worrying about the Mercenary Queen and Jung Hayan, right? One is your lover from Earth, and the other is living here with us. It\u2019s hard to choose, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIn fact, it may be difficult to surpass the modern ethics of monogamy, but choosing both might be the best option for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy expression shifted into one of embarrassment. We were obviously thinking of different things. Upon seeing this, Hwang Jeong-yeon laughed and stopped.\u201cAh. That wasn\u2019t what you meant, was it?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry! You had such a serious expression on her face that I thought\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe flashed me an embarrassed expression. Something didn\u2019t feel right.I think I\u2019ve felt something similar somewhere else.\u2018It seems like\u2026\u2019They gave me different impressions and even looked completely different. However, the face I was imagining was a pig with a face like a bandit, and the woman in front of me very much looked like your typical modern woman.For some reason, however, this Hwang Jeong-yeon reminded me of Park Deokgu.\u2018They look alike in a sense.\u2019It ominously felt like something bad would happen if I got myself involved in this.While I was wondering what I could say, she spoke again.\u201cLook at me going off like that. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ve been watching you guys for so long that I couldn\u2019t help but ramble about it.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see, I see\u2026\u201d\u201cI know the two of you are close. Whenever I see Jung Hayan and Lee Kiyoung together, I often find myself smiling without knowing it. I think Jung Hayan really likes Mr. Kiyoung. I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019re wearing that type of magic.\u201d\u201cWhat magic?\u201d\u201cLocation-tracking magic. I don\u2019t know if I should be here with you right now. I don\u2019t want Miss Hayan thinking of the wrong thing\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to act so shy. You let her cast the magic on you, didn\u2019t you? I find that so romantic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, you didn\u2019t know about it, didn\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 can you pretend not to have heard what I said?\u201dI found myself stunned with this new piece of information.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t even need to clear my mind \u2013 the perpetrator was obvious in terms of personality and recent behavior.\u2018Jung Hayan.\u2019This was Jung Hayan\u2019s doing.Several guilds and clans came to mind, but I knew none of them had a valid reason to do this. There were also the three crazy women hanging around me that could be considered suspects.However, it was difficult for someone like Cha Hee-ra to hire a wizard and cast a spell on me. I also knew Lee Jihye neither had the time nor ability to cast this magic type on me. I would have noticed if she had beforehand.The suspect must have been someone who cast the spell while I was asleep in my room.Of course, this could only mean Jung Hayan.Thinking about her watching me sleep made goosebumps form all over my body.\u2018What is this\u2026\u2019Before entering the Guild House, Jung Hayan came here every night to do various things, but when I thought about it, I had never woken up in the middle of the night after entering the Guild House.\u2018When did it start?\u2019I didn\u2019t know exactly when, but\u2026It felt strange to think that Jung Hayan was involved in this.However, when I thought about all those times that I had not woken in my sleep ever since we started staying at the Guild House, the answer came to me.\u2018It can\u2019t be a coincidence.\u2019Whenever I walked into my room with the intent to sleep, I must have been so immersed in my thoughts that I thought receiving headaches daily was normal.Of course, this was only speculation, but if this was true, then Jung Hayan probably received some pre-sex education before we even arrived here.\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019After trying to sort through my embarrassed, befuddled mind, I looked back up to see Hwang Jeong-yeon looking at me as if she had just committed a big mistake. If I were her, I would have reacted in the same manner as well. It was like she had just blatantly told someone they were being watched by their significant other.I didn\u2019t know how my relationship with Jung Hayan must have looked to them, but I felt like I should have noticed this sooner.I opened my mouth to speak once more. I felt like I deserved a better explanation.\u201cCan you elaborate it for a bit?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dIt is of utmost importance to know the exact situation. That way, I could be careful, too.\u201cSo\u2026 That\u2026\u201d\u201cI would like you to tell me the exact details.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2026\u201dHer hesitation made me feel even more anxious.This was because I was worried that this spell might have hidden functions. I hadn\u2019t heard of eavesdropping magic within the continent before, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find out that Jung Hayan was capable of producing new magic on her own. If so, how much would she have heard?\u201cCan I be honest with you, then?\u201d\u201cGo ahead. I just felt a little surprised. I mean, I should have expected this to some extent\u2026 Anyway, I don\u2019t really care.\u201d\u201cIf you say so, then I should let you know. Miss Hayan really surprised me.\u201d\u201cYeah. She tends to be a little too jealous at times. Perhaps that\u2019s what drove her to do this.\u201d\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s probably because of all the rumors with the Red Mercenary Queen. If so, then I can understand why she would do this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSomehow, she managed to hide the presence of her spell really well.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThe average person won\u2019t even notice it, so I\u2019m not surprised that you haven\u2019t. The same goes for most wizards. They\u2019re not particularly sensitive to magic like me, or it simply feels so systematic and complicated that they wouldn\u2019t notice it at all. If I didn\u2019t have over 80 magic stats, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed it as well. The magical power is also very faint, and above all, it was designed to melt into Mr. Kiyoung\u2019s unique magic power.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s all so interesting to me as well. I didn\u2019t think that magic could be used in this manner, but the rumors did say Miss Hayan was a genius. Anyway, you said you were an alchemist?\u201d\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\u201cMy class is a little different from hers, but I can still tell you what kind of magic she used. The order itself stems from basic magic.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThe first enchantment, as I mentioned, is the location tracking magic. As the name suggests, it\u2019s a type of magic designed to help you identify where your target is. This is not really a big deal, but the second magic seems a bit interesting to me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of magic similar to creating a safety zone within a dungeon. It would be comfortable to think of it as a magic that sends a signal when a creature enters a certain radius. On average, the radius is about 50cm\u2026 In simple terms, it would be right to explain that it is a magic that sends a signal to the caster when a specific someone approaches Kiyoung over a certain area. Of course, we have no idea as to who it is, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cUsually, to cast this kind of magic, a part of the subject\u2019s body or a catalyst such as blood is needed\u2026 Do you really not know this?\u201d\u201cWhat would happen if it was done without a catalyst?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to use this kind of magic without a catalyst. This magic is difficult to find because it has transformed into a form similar to the kind of magic that Kiyoung has. In this way, the presence of a catalyst is essential. If not, the activation of the spell would be impossible to trigger.\u201d\u201cYes, I remember this.\u201d\u2018Ah, I knew it\u2026\u2019\u201cSo, a strand of hair would do? Or nails?\u201d\u201cNo. If one were to use these, they would need a bunch of them.\u201dOf course, I don\u2019t remember allowing Jung Hayan to amass an abundance of my hair.However, I knew what she must have used \u2013 the tooth I had lost back in the dungeon.It felt ridiculous for me to remember that fact. At that time, I never imagined she would use it like this.When I thought about it on a deeper scale, I remembered Jung Hayan appearing during my talk with Lee Jihye. The spell must have alerted her as the other woman was inside the trigger radius.\u2018That\u2019s why\u2026\u2019That was the whole reason why Jung Hayan had started at Lee Jihye so murderously. No wonder I felt so worried about seeing her in that manner.Meanwhile, Hwang Jeong-yeon was still staring at me with a worried expression of her own \u2013 similar to how a mother would look when watching her favorite drama shows.\u201cDoes this type of magic include being able to listen in on conversations, or seeing what the person is currently doing?\u201d\u201cWell, since there are two types of enchantments present, it\u2019s quite tricky to be able to tell. It\u2019s hard to believe that a newcomer has managed to create this type of magic. Of course, it was possible because the consumption of magical power used was low. This is enough to ensure a new type of thesis for magic academia!\u201d\u2018The title of that particular paper should be How to Stalk Your Boyfriend.\u2019Ah\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I can disarm the spell\u2026 what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be fine for now.\u201d\u201cOh, you must be enjoying the restraint. It seems a little weird to me, but it\u2019s romantic all the same.\u201d\u2018Romantic, my ass.\u2019This was very shocking news, but I was grateful I was able to remain calm.I already knew Jung Hayan was obsessed with me, but not to this extent. However, I knew that I could handle her perfectly well, so this exchange didn\u2019t surprise me as much as it should\u2019ve.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t creep me out!At this, I wondered if there were other devices hidden in my room.\u201cWould you please go up to my room with me if you\u2019re available?\u201d\u201cY-Yes?\u201d The look Hwang Jeong-yeon shot me made me feel more embarrassed. I realized just how suggestive my offer sounded.\u201cWell, thank you for the suggestion, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not interested in that sort of thing\u2026 don\u2019t get me wrong, you are attractive and all, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it in that manner.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cI would like you to see if there\u2019s any other magic residing within my room.\u201d\u201cAh, I see!\u201dOnce again, I was able to notice that she smelled a lot like Park Deokgu.\u201cThen let\u2019s go up together! I was curious about your workshop since it apparently costs a lot. Today\u2019s my lucky day!\u201d\u201cYes, the same is true for me.\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for her, I wouldn\u2019t have known about the presence of this type of magic.As soon as I got up from my seat, I noticed Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s expression once more. It was like she wasn\u2019t even taking this seriously. She seemed to regard us as a drama set.As we made our way up to the second floor, I could feel my steps getting heavier for some reason. However, this was completely necessary.\u201cSo this is the place used by the 7th generation people. I heard it\u2019s very good.\u201d\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t seen other people\u2019s accommodations, so I can\u2019t say the same.\u201dHwang Jeong-yan stopped momentarily in front of Park Deokgu\u2019s room. It was subtle, but I had caught it all the same.\u2018Oh, no\u2026\u2019A horrible scenario emerged from my brain at this. Shaking my head, I coaxed her in the direction of my room, not wanting to think about it.I opened the door with a casual expression. My place was minimalistic as a whole, with various books and equipment on my desk. Admittedly, my room looked messier than I would have liked, but there was nothing I could do about it for now.\u201cIt\u2019s a really neat room.\u201d\u201cA-Ah\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, my goodness. You seem to have more books than me\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I gave up reading these halfway through.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still good to study\u2026 Oh, I got distracted. You wanted me to check if there\u2019s any other magic present within the room?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dHwang Jeong-yeon then began to look around the room with magic-infused eyes. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so determined to find out about any magic spells. I knew I should not have underestimated Jung Hayan\u2019s power.After a while, Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s expression began to change very subtly. Whatever she found, she seemed to find it very interesting, as she was trying her best to hold back her smile.My anxiety peaked at this expression. Eventually, she spoke again.\u201cThere is.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI can see it on the wall and on the bed.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the tutorial\u2019s beginning, I\u2019ve already seen Jung Hayan create walls with her illusion magic.However, it felt embarrassing to realize that I had not noticed her change an entire wall.Leaning forward, I placed my hand on the wall and was surprised that it was still solid from my touch.\u2018Didn\u2019t she change it?\u2019I looked towards Hwang Jeong-yeon in confusion. Upon seeing this, she began to explain.\u201cOnly a small hole has been changed, not the entire wall.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cIf you put your finger in here, you\u2019ll understand what I mean.\u201dAs she beckoned at a particular spot in the wall, I followed her lead and poked my finger through. Embarrassingly enough, it pierced through to the other side.It was absurd for me not to notice something like this up until now.\u201cHow can I not know\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was created with weak magic power, and since this room itself is already surrounded by magical power, it\u2019s understandable for you not to have noticed. I don\u2019t think Mr. Kiyoung is that sensitive to magical power\u2026 Most of all, this hole seems to have just been recently made.\u201d\u201cAh, you can tell?\u201d\u201cYeah. It looks like it\u2019s been here for less than a month\u2026 I don\u2019t know why Miss Hayan dared to do something like this, but\u2026 I can guess why.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah.\u201d I tried not to pay heed to Jeong-yeon\u2019s suggestive expression.Of course, I don\u2019t remember doing anything specific in this room, but I felt uncomfortable as I realized that Jung Hayan had probably seen all of me already.At times, I even dared to lay on my bed naked. I\u2019m sure everyone would understand.\u2018She would only do this because of me.\u2019I hadn\u2019t expected her to go this far, but it was the one responsible for leading her on, anyway. I had to tolerate all the mishaps that would emerge from it.Perhaps I should find it fortunate that I had discovered this right away. Who knew what else she might find out through this gimmick of hers?\u201cIn fact, what\u2019s really amazing is this bed.\u201d\u201cHuh? What about it?\u201d\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this is a new revolution in magical science.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSeeing her impressed look at someone else\u2019s work made me feel bitter for some reason.After a few moments of waiting for her to speak, Hwang Jeong-yeon began to explain.\u201cIt\u2019s a fatigue recovery type magic.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. In addition to checking Kiyoung\u2019s condition, there are also various kinds of magic present, so many that I cannot explain all of them. From invigorating magic, to magic that boosts vitality\u2026 There\u2019s also magic that speeds up brain rotation and blood circulation. In addition to this, there is also a built-in protection-type magic that can protect Mr. Kiyoung when something bad happens. If a large magic falls upon this Guild House, Mr. Kiyoung will probably be unscathed. If you had slept in this bed, you would have stayed in a deep sleep. I don\u2019t think you ever felt tired after waking up the next day. Am I right?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I think so. I\u2019ve always woken up feeling refreshed.\u201d\u201cBy the way, if you slept in a bed like this, it would be natural for your fatigue to go away. I find that so romantic of her\u2026\u201dIndeed, I felt my heart warming up to Hayan. I thought there would be some magic, sure, but I didn\u2019t know it would be this kind.What was embarrassing here was the type of magic Jung Hayan had chosen to cast.\u201cThen, are you saying that the bed itself has magic? That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. It would be impossible, right? I mean, even if it was, it would be inefficient. Putting magic into objects is something that many people have given up on doing.\u201d\u201cYes. Most of those would just be commercialized products. I have personally conducted research about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I said this is revolutionary. If the concealment technology of the location tracking magic on Kiyoung is of a thesis level, the magic on this bed has the potential to shake the magic academia and create a new school. A newbie has done what others who have been here for years couldn\u2019t\u2026 I personally feel a little intimidated.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, there are no restrictions.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what to say. No matter how talented Jung Hayan was, she could not have done all this so perfectly.\u201cThis magic only works on you, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cYeah. I think that this magic also made use of catalysts. Using a part of Kiyoung\u2019s body as a catalyst, the magic was compressed to the point where the effect is only activated on the individual. The efficiency would be very poor if everyone could activate it. This means that it is a bed exclusively for Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cI see. Even so\u2026\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, the magic activates because your genetics and the genetic makeup of the catalyst match.\u201dHer explanation made sense to me.\u201cHowever, one has to charge it.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cAt least once a month, the person who memorized the spell has to put in the magic again. Seeing that this type of magic has been here up until now, it must mean that Miss Hayan has been able to come here for some steamy visits\u2026 Ho ho ho\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is also another thing.\u201d\u201cTell me, please.\u201d\u201cLike I said, this type of magic uses catalysts. Hmm. Could you please turn the mat over? Or there must be a secret space somewhere\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, of course.\u201dIf what she said was true, the device should be somewhere within the bed. Not long after, I could see something white stuck inside the mattress.\u201cHuh. That\u2019s Kiyoung\u2019s teeth, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Probably so.\u201d\u201cWould you believe me if I told you that Kiyoung\u2019s information stored in that catalyst is the one responsible for keeping the magic?\u201d\u201cThis is definitely something similar\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, so you\u2019re knowledgeable on the topic?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m an expert.\u201d\u2018This method is certainly similar to alchemy.\u2019The only thing I was sure of was that this wasn\u2019t a simple type of magic.Using magic on a specific type of catalyst to ensure that it would only be triggered if the right target was present was on a complex level all by itself.\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019I realized this approach perfectly matched the direction in which I wanted to grow. The idea of mixing different magic with catalysts was just the same as using one\u2019s genetic makeup.Homunculus research, chimera research, and even magic potion research. This was the best approach I could use.\u2018This is great\u2026\u2019Of course, my method would be different. Unlike Jung Hayan, I would have to approach this with my alchemy magic.As a user of catalysts and genetically modified formulations, I had more knowledge than she did.In other words, the method would be the same, but how I was going to study all this would be done differently.I would have even thought that Jung Hayan had prepared all this in advance.\u2018This works.\u2019I was sure of this now. Here was a result that would have taken me countless failed experiments to achieve. It would be unnatural not to get excited.\u201cYou must be happy, too. Oh my God.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. Honestly, I do feel happy.\u201d\u201cAh, but there\u2019s also another amazing feature hidden within this bed.\u201d\u201cOh? There\u2019s another one?\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a magic called Reverse.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a built-in debuff that removes all granted buffs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cExcept for Kiyoung, it\u2019s probably triggered when you are close to the bed or lying down. Of course, in the case of others, the effect is not so great because the catalyst doesn\u2019t match with the target, but it can still cast a curse. If I sat down, I would have been affected a great deal. It means that if any other woman lay on this bed, she would receive a curse that would lead to her death.\u201d\u201cSo, that\u2019s why you asked me to lift the bed.\u201d\u201cYes, so basically, it\u2019s Miss Hayan\u2019s way of saying you shouldn\u2019t bring other women to your bed. That\u2019s so romantic!\u201dI did not find this romantic at all. Rather, I found it a little scary.\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201cNo, this is all I can find. If Kiyoung says he is doing research in earnest, the results may be different, but I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s very little information about this sort of magic. Jung Hayan looks like a cute little wizard, but she\u2019s actually more capable than one would think.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRather than focusing on the bad aspects of this newfound information, I felt grateful to Jung Hayan for showing me which way I should take for my growth. Who knew I would find the answer in my room?Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that I would ignore everything she had done, but my training took precedence over everything else.As I looked over my bed once more, the tooth stuck in the corner began to look more lovable than creepy.\u2018Wait\u2026\u2019It had been a while, but a question began to arise in my head.\u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIf my position as of this moment is being transmitted to Jung Hayan, does this mean that she also has some part of my body?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018What\u2026\u2019What other parts of me did Jung Hayan have?My hair remained the same, and I didn\u2019t remember her ever drawing blood. No, Jung Hayan could not have hurt my body before that.In the case of normal monsters, the parts used as catalysts were very diverse.It was not only hair and teeth bundles but also blood and eyeballs that could be used. The heart worked best, and even bones and organs would come a long way.In the case of certain monsters, saliva and the liquid generated by the body for males were also effective, but it was difficult to guess what the hell Jung Hayan had taken.I tried not to think about it too much.\u2018Surely\u2026 Surely she didn\u2019t\u2026\u2019I was curious about what kind of catalyst she would have taken from me, but there was no way of actually knowing. Still, though, my anxiety went through the roof.\u2018It couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jung Hayan was still growing up, after all.I knew that if Jung Hayan became a wizard powerful enough to wipe out the entire continent according to Kim Hyunsung\u2019s predictions, then the unthinkable might happen.This peephole would become an entire wall, and this bed could be made to curse everyone it touches. That wasn\u2019t everything, even. She might also be responsible for the creation of recording magic. Other things came to mind.\u2018Mental control?\u2019She could develop a mind-control spell that would manipulate my mind little by little, or maybe use a powerful enchantment spell particularly made for me. She could even find a way to become invisible in order to stay by my side the entire time.Of course, I was still convinced that Jung Hayan wouldn\u2019t do all these things since she still held the title of Pure Advocate, but then again\u2026 this was the same girl who had cut off Park Hye-young\u2019s limbs.\u2018One wrong move\u2026\u2019I needed to be careful whenever Jung Hayan was around and when she wasn\u2019t.Thanks to Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s ability, I was able to find this out while it was still in the early stages. I would have to make an insurance plan, but I had to focus on something else for now.\u201cThis is incredible.\u201d\u201cYou think?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would use the whole second floor as a workshop.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI knew what Hwang Jeong-yeon was talking about. As a wizard, it wasn\u2019t hard for her to feel impressed. By connecting my room and the alchemy workshop through the gap between the empty guild room, my workspace was wide as a result.I also knew what had caught her eye was not the workshop\u2019s setup but the items found within.\u2018After all, I had gotten a lot from the Black Swan.\u2019Even for an experienced adventurer such as she, it would still be hard to earn so many rewards such as these.\u201cTo be precise, it\u2019s so that my workshop and room are connected. It was a little uncomfortable to go back and forth\u2026 The best textbooks to study are already here, so it\u2019s less time-consuming this way.\u201d\u201cNo, no, everything looks great to me.\u201d\u201cThey were all gifts. Oh, do you not have a second job?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my break time right now. Am I interrupting anything?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m just grateful for your help.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing else for me to do\u2026 as a wizard, I\u2019m surprisingly not that curious. Of course, I don\u2019t plan on snatching Mr. Kiyoung\u2019s or Miss Hayan\u2019s research for myself, either!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know that.\u201dI made sure to assess her once more with my ability, wanting to memorize her stats.[Check player Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s status window and talent level][Name- Jeong-yeon Hwang][Title- Daily Drama Lover][Age- 34][Propensity-an optimist who is noisy][Job-Magician-Heroic Grade][Job Effect-Acquisition of Basic Magic Knowledge][Job Effect-Acquisition of Basic Magical Knowledge][Job Effect-Intermediate Magic Knowledge Acquisition][Job Effect-Intermediate Magical Knowledge Acquisition][Capacity][Strength -30/Growth Limit: Rare or higher][Agility -40/Growth Limit: Rare or higher][Health-32/Growth Limit: Rare or less][Intellect-90/Growth Limit: Heroic or higher][Durability-32/Growth Limit: Rare or less][Luck -54/Growth Limit: Rare or higher][Holy -80 /Growth Limit: Heroic or less][Talent- Sensitive Body- Rare-grade][Talent- Super Memory- Rare-grade][Overall Review -The growth of her magic power is almost reaching its limit. It is not an exaggeration to say that the path to the top wizard is almost closed for her, but it seems that she is hiding her shortcomings with high intelligence stats. It would be right to think that it is a case where one can rise to the upper level because of the good compatibility with the characteristics and the job. If the magical talent was not less than a heroic-grade, but more than a heroic-grade, the situation would have changed a little. It can be said that this player is similar to Kiyoung Lee, but please don\u2019t think of her as a comrade. The player Lee Kiyoung has no magical talent compared to this person.]\u2018Cocksucker.\u2019I certainly didn\u2019t like the overall review, but I liked her abilities and growth.Of course, comparing myself to her was a bit extreme, but she also similarly relied on her intelligence whenever she lacked in other stats.It wasn\u2019t only Jung Hayan\u2019s magic that helped me today \u2013 even her stats made me learn something.\u2018Her characteristics are also good.\u2019The characteristic of having a Sensitive Body caught my eye, but not in the sexual sense. This was a characteristic that was heavily influenced by the magic power of the surrounding environment.However, what interested me more was her talent \u2013 Super Memory.[Talent-Super Memory- Rare-grade][Gives you near-perfect memory.]Since it was only of the rare grade, her memory wouldn\u2019t be labeled as perfect yet, but I knew having an ability just like hers would be beneficial for reading people\u2019s stats.It didn\u2019t seem so impossible to develop the skill for myself.I placed my attention back on Hwang Jeong-yeon as she spoke again.\u201cCan I read it?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe book you have put together.\u201d\u201cOf course. I wanted to consult someone about it, anyway.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I won\u2019t give you anything but my personal opinion. Anyway, you\u2019re more of an expert at this than I am. This is all uncharted territory for me.\u201d\u201cEven if you possess the intelligence of a senior wizard?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. Come to think of it, Kiyoung probably doesn\u2019t know much about intellect. You probably don\u2019t have time to study your stats.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Has Kiyoung ever wondered about his intelligence stats?\u201d\u201cOf course I have. Unlike muscle strength, stamina, and magic power, there are areas that are hard to measure, such as luck stats or intelligence stats. In fact, even though my intelligence stats are rising, it is difficult to feel exactly what is changing.\u201d\u201cI mean, you already know a lot.\u201d\u201cHonestly, it is difficult to notice if something has changed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure either, but I\u2019m sure Kiyoung is right. Just because your intelligence goes up doesn\u2019t make you a genius. I feel like there\u2019s no big change in the basic thinking skills of an individual. Knowledge doesn\u2019t come so suddenly.\u201d\u201cSo, the reason for the existence of these stats is unclear? Is it the same for people whose intelligence stats have reached their 70s or 80s?\u201d\u201cYeah. To give you an extreme example, someone with an intellect in their 90s may not be able to do something as basic as memorizing multiplication tables.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too extreme.\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a really extreme story. However, it simply means that one\u2019s intelligence stat has nothing to do with the intelligence that that individual really has.\u201d\u201cIs it all about increasing your understanding of magical power or alchemy?\u201dIf that was all there was to it; then my stats could very well be a disappointment. On the other hand, I couldn\u2019t say they were completely useless, either.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not just that.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t find the words to properly explain it, but I\u2019m sure its use will be a little clearer if your intelligence reaches over 80.\u201dNow, this was a topic I was interested in.\u201cMost people with intelligence over 90 tend to develop something else other than their brains. Most of the wizards around me and those with their Intellect over 90 in Lindel had the knowledge to be called extraordinary.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201d\u201cThere were some people who said that their creativity or understanding of tactics had changed remarkably. In my case, my memorization skills have gone up beyond comparison.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cSince I was very young, I heard a lot of people saying that I had a good memory, but the moment I reached 90, I felt like my brain was getting better in ways that I could not understand. Of course, there wasn\u2019t much change in other parts. I think it\u2019s just a conjecture of ourselves, but I also think it has the effect of maximizing the efficiency of the part where our brain is most developed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 That is actually very interesting.\u201d\u201cAmong the traits I have, the trait called Super Memory is the trait I\u2019ve obtained after my intellect exceeded 90. Mr. Kiyoung may also get something once he reaches that point. Since you are good at dating, will you progress into marriage? Ho ho ho\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dHearing this sounded very pleasing to me. I thought my stats were hopeless as they were, but I didn\u2019t think that the one stat I had on high potential would give me an extraordinarily new ability.If Hwang Jeong-yeon was right, then I felt excited about what I could get.\u2018What could it be?\u2019Since Hwang Jeong-yeon mentioned her ability had stemmed from what people had said about her, I tried my best to remember what other people had told me in the past.\u2018Huh, that guy with the hair is pretty badass.\u2019\u2018Huh, the kid is also clever.\u2019That was what people used to describe me. It felt ridiculous imagining a scenario where I gained an ability for better hair management.However, even that would be better than developing an ability that pertained to romance, like what Hwang Jeong-yeon had said.\u2018What would I use that for?\u2019\u201cDoes that mean everyone who exceeds 90 in Intellect will get their own characteristic?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not guaranteed for everyone, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to receive an additional trait. It\u2019s just not well known in the system.\u201d\u201cThank you for teaching me so many things.\u201d\u201cNo, no. You were bound to learn about it anyway. I\u2019m just saying that even geniuses can lack familiar knowledge. Whoo. Have you felt like you\u2019ve made progress?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still at the toddler level. I\u2019m still trying to understand how all this works, after all.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve just started out. If there is anything I can help you with, please tell me.\u201d\u201cI see no reason to refuse that offer.\u201dHowever, I knew I would not be able to receive such help for free.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do to repay you, but if there\u2019s anything, please do inform me.\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019m not looking for any repayment\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to specify it.\u201d\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201dLooking at Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s expression, I knew there was indeed something she had in mind. She tried to explain that it was natural to help me because we came from the same guild, that we had met by chance, but I knew she had approached me with a motive in mind.As I silently began to hope that her request wouldn\u2019t be too hard to do, she began to speak.\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201d\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d\u201cWould you please introduce me to Park Deokgu once they come back?\u201dI blinked. Out of all the hard requests I was expecting her to come up with\u2026\u2018Is Park Deokgu really a love doctor?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t really mean to ask this of you, but since you insisted\u2026\u201dIt certainly didn\u2019t seem like I had misheard her request.I didn\u2019t want to get involved in any romantic ventures that could happen between the two. However, I felt like it was only natural for me to wonder why she wanted this.\u201cSince when\u2026?\u201d\u201cNever mind when\u2026 It\u2019s because Park Deokgu hasn\u2019t left my mind\u2026\u201dWas it because they had similar characteristics?\u201cI encountered him in the restaurant once. He looked at me so indifferently, but those eyes\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking about him ever since.\u201d\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019It felt a little embarrassing to witness this side of Hwang Jeong-yeon. However, she did mention being into bigger guys, so I guess that was to be expected.Objectively, Hwang Jeong-yeon was a very pretty girl. She had a soothing atmosphere that could make a person feel relaxed just by being in her presence. She had her hair tied to one side that went past her shoulders, complete with a thin, little smile. I felt like there was something different about her. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t believe it only took Park Deokgu ten seconds to capture this woman\u2019s heart.Meanwhile, it had taken me quite some time to get Jung Hayan to develop feelings for me. It felt a little embarrassing to admit this, but I knew I had to accept it at one point.\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to find a way.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I think he\u2019s a really good person, and is someone I could come to trust. I think we\u2019d be a good fit, don\u2019t you think? If you could help me out\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, but I\u2019d be eager to help you out in exchange! I won\u2019t interfere with your research!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep my word. However, you have a lot of work to do.\u201d\u201cThank you, and of course!\u201dWith that, I had gotten myself a competent assistant.It didn\u2019t matter whether Park Deokgu and Hwang Jeong-yeon became lovers or not, but I thought there was a good chance that they would be. I knew Park Deokgu would react accordingly if I praised her in front of him since he trusted me completely.Bearing this in mind, I concluded that the price was reasonable. In any case, I wouldn\u2019t lose anything trying to play matchmaker. If they got together, then Park Deokgu would probably stop hanging around my workshop, and I would be able to do my research in peace.\u201cThen let\u2019s get started, doctor.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do that, assistant.\u201dWith that, we set right to work.Very little time had passed since then.\u201cDid you find anything of use?\u201d\u201cNot yet. But it doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t, soon enough.\u201dI wasn\u2019t trying to create anything that could be called revolutionary. After all, I was using Jung Hayan\u2019s method and reconstructing it to fit my style.I needed this to increase my stats and to find me my new job. I had managed to increase my stats at the beginning of our research, but the progress slowed down once we reached the second half. Like before, the efficiency of stat increase by using the catalyst had begun to dwindle.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cLike what I said last time, I\u2019ve been trying to see if alchemy can also compress and maintain the magic within a catalyst, and if there\u2019s any way to harness genetic information with this type of magic.\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u201d\u201cYour hunch about the construction and design of the spell seems correct. However, that means it\u2019ll be hard achieving the same result through alchemy. Jung Hayan really is a genius\u2026\u201dHowever, the things I at first found nonsensical soon began to make sense.I now knew why Jung Hayan was called a genius. Her ideas could branch into new theories. The magic power stored within her preferred catalyst was so huge that its effects could open up a new branch of study under magical academia.\u2018The spell is very unique.\u2019Her method of arranging the magic power, the order in which she built the Tower of Magic, and her execution were all done in a sophisticated manner.Unlike Hwang Jeong-yeon, whose intellect enhanced her memory, Jung Hayan\u2019s intellect was naturally predisposed for innovativeness and enhancement of magic.\u2018She\u2019s a genius.\u2019Now I knew why Kim Hyunsung seemed so obsessed with Jung Hayan.With this thought in mind, I continued my research.My struggle in finding an answer made me undergo sleepless nights, and there were times where I even dared to skip meals. Hwang Jeong-yeon also did the same. Though she did not help much in other aspects, her presence was enough to explain the aspects I had been struggling in.[Intellect increases by 1.][Intellect increases by 1.]Though my progress went slowly, it felt pleasing to know that I was getting somewhere.By the time my intelligence stat had exceeded the 50s, I had begun to understand just how the mechanism of increasing intelligence worked.The first was the acquisition or understanding of new knowledge. The second was deep meditation. Sharpening one\u2019s imagination, indulging in experiments, reevaluating theories, and continually reading books \u2013 all of these helped build one\u2019s intellect.Just as Park Deokgu continually underwent weight training to build his strength, I continually fed myself with the knowledge to increase my intellect.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I cleaned your room, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cOh, please do not clean up near me. There are tons of data that I\u2019ve not organized yet.\u201d\u201cOf course. Why don\u2019t you get some more sleep?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to cut off my progress.\u201dOf course, Hwang Jeong-yeon had a point. Both my room and workspace had begun to look like a dump. All the data I had organized had begun to pile up once more, leaving little space to move.Seeing educational materials scattered all over my bed must have looked like an interesting scene, but it didn\u2019t mean that it was fun in actuality. Studying continuously was boring.Even though a door of opportunity had presented itself to me, there was no guarantee that it would open for me, and that alone increased my anxiety. However, I had no choice but to carry on.Even at this moment, I knew my fellow party members were doing their best to progress. I had to catch up before I got left too far behind.At the same time, I knew Kim Hyunsung wouldn\u2019t abandon me even if that happened. This was my own doing. It was natural for me to get left behind if I didn\u2019t exert the needed effort to improve. And in a way, Kim Hyunsung had steered me in the right direction \u2013 I didn\u2019t want just to be a simple asset.For the time being, I was forced to stick to my plan.\u201cHey, Mr. Kiyoung. How do you make use of your magic?\u201d\u201cAh. Different people have different ways of casting spells. In my case, I build up the Tower of Magic. Jung Hayan does it similarly, except hers is like a rotating watchtower. It\u2019s like gathering all the needed parts and building something out of them.\u201d\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually more complicated than others. I don\u2019t know much of anything else, so I think the most difficult part is finding genetics that match.\u201d\u201cSimply interpreting the order already seems complicated\u2026 It would be stressful to have to convert to making use of a magic circle.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really just a simple operation\u2026 All you have to do is make use of your time wisely.\u201dIt might seem like a simple conjuring of a circle on the surface, but there was a difference. I knew I would get fruitful results with my research soon, but I was already getting impatient.One month had passed, but Kim Hyunsung and the others had not yet returned.\u2018They must be suffering\u2026\u2019Perhaps the consumables they had taken with them proved to be insufficient for the trip. Knowing their condition before they left, I knew they\u2019d have a hard time sorting their mess.Jung Hayan would have spent every night with tears, and Kim Ye-ri, without Kim Hyunsung\u2019s constant commands, would be shooting arrows in the wrong direction. Park Deokgu might even revert to being a coward again.On the other hand, Sun Hee-young would move normally, but as she would be burdened with leading the party, the whole team would feel at a loss. I felt a little better, knowing I wasn\u2019t the only one having a hard time.A little more time passed.At this point, I had slowly begun understanding Jung Hayan\u2019s magic, and my intelligence stats had exceeded 60. Personally, this felt like a very satisfying achievement.\u201cThe results have shown themselves.\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019re reaching the target intellectual levels.\u201d\u201cAh. Congratulations. How about taking a little break today?\u201d\u201cNo, no. It would be better to rest after I\u2019ve achieved my goal.\u201dAfter so much time devoting myself to my progress, I began to ask myself questions that I knew would aid me in my goal. This time, it wasn\u2019t about the hidden truth of magic.Rather, I had started thinking about the job change I was aiming for.How could Jung Hayan have achieved such advanced creations without prior experience?I already knew the answer.Jung Hayan had gotten a job before she even went on a hunt. I didn\u2019t bother wondering as to how she had gotten it. She probably understood herself far more than I did with myself and had put this knowledge to good use.I was trying to do the same now, too.\u2018I have to understand\u2026\u2019In addition to analyzing, describing, and organizing data, I needed to understand everything that was going through my head. I knew I was taking the right direction with this.I began to ask myself more questions because of this. \u2018Why?\u2019 questions were a constant presence. Thus I began my search for the hidden truth, rather than the visible results.I imagined experimenting and then tried to determine why it failed, which was not as difficult as it sounded. After all, I had a very competent assistant by my side.In addition to that, I had also lost a little weight.\u2018It\u2019s not a bad feeling, though\u2026\u2019Why would I, when I felt like I had just stumbled onto a valuable part of my progress?I didn\u2019t want a great answer to my goals. One very small piece was already enough.How did the change in genetic traits, information values, and magic power affect the individual? Was the magic present in the transformed individual complete or incomplete?We had not stopped experimenting with stranded DNA, and we still didn\u2019t know which virus was deadly to some monsters and why a particular gene would not accept said virus.None of these small pieces of information were well understood, but one thing was certain.We were slowly finding the answers.\u201cWhat do you need this time?\u201d\u201cI need catalysts from the Garden of Terror, please.\u201dI was far from finding the answers, and I wasn\u2019t that smart. I wasn\u2019t even a scientist, and I didn\u2019t know anything about genes and the like.However, I found the whole process of searching for answers fun.\u201cYou must be enjoying this.\u201d\u201cI am not.\u201d[Intellect increases by 1.]\u201cIsn\u2019t it fun? I found it interesting.\u201d\u201cNo. Honestly, I found it boring.\u201d[Intellect increases by 1.]\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d[Intellect increases by 1.]As more time passed, I began to make even more progress.[You have discovered a new job.]The results I hoped to achieve had finally come.\u201cPhew.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My room had not yet been cleaned up, so I had chosen to spend the night in my workshop.\u2018I still feel so tired\u2026\u2019If I had known that my condition wouldn\u2019t have improved even after getting some rest, I would have cleaned up after myself the night before. In that way, I could have used the bed that Jung Hayan had infused with magic.As I turned my head, I caught sight of Hwang Jeong-yeon sitting on the far side of the sofa.\u2018You must be tired as well\u2026\u2019She had tried her hardest to follow my schedule. Therefore, she must have also felt exhausted.Although I had not expected her to stay here, I did not feel alert. I felt pleased to know that I was not so wary of people anymore. The more I could trust, the better.It was then that I began to realize where all the noise was coming from.\u201cGosh\u2026 My hyung seems to have done a lot of work, too. The whole second floor is a mess. Oh, Hayan! If you keep running like that, you\u2019ll fall. Hee-young, please do something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst, we should organize our luggage. Hee-young, pass me the white one\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dI knew what this meant. My fellow party members were back.I had begun to smile at this realization. However, upon seeing Hwang Jeong-yeon groggily stretching, I began to panic.\u2018Fuck.\u2019I could hear the sound of footsteps frantically making their way up to the second floor. I knew who that was.\u2018Jung Hayan.\u2019Even though Jeong-yeon and I had never indulged in any physical contact, it would still be bad for Hayan to see her here. It would not be beneficial for Hwang Jeong-yeon either, for she counted on me to introduce Park Deokgu.\u201cOppa\u2026 Oppa\u2026\u201d Jung Hayan\u2019s voice floated through the workshop\u2019s door. I knew the location-tracking magic was still working, so I couldn\u2019t pretend that I wasn\u2019t here.I felt like a protagonist in a horror movie.Rattle!\u201cOppa\u2026 Are you there? Are you there?\u201dRattle!\u201cAre you there? Oppa?\u201dRattle!\u201cYou didn\u2019t even sleep? Maybe you were still researching\u2026 Perhaps we should quiet down, for now, Hayan. It\u2019s still so early in the morning\u2026\u201d\u2018Nice save, Park Deokgu.\u2019\u201cOr maybe there\u2019s something wrong with my hyung\u2026 Perhaps he fell down?\u201d\u2018\u2026I take that back.\u2019Thump-thump.At this, Jung Hayan resumed her relentless knocking on the door. It was natural for Hwang Jeong-yeon to wake up from all the commotion.It only took her a few seconds to grasp what was happening. Her eyes widened.\u201cOppa! Oh, are you still sleeping?\u201dI almost snorted at the question. If I were asleep, then she most certainly would not receive a reply.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u2018Ugh, what a situation\u2026\u2019As I gestured towards the window, I saw Hwang Jeong-yeon nodding desperately.\u201cAh\u2026 Deokgu. I slept late and only woke up now.\u201d\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d\u201cAh! We\u2019re sorry to have disturbed you.\u201d\u201cYou came a little later than expected. I\u2019ll open the door now. Wait.\u201dAs I spoke, Hwang Jeong-yeon dashed to the window. I could have said we were studying together, but even that would look suspicious. The fact that we were alone together at this time of day would not sit well with Jung Hayan.\u201cAh!\u201dHwang Jeong-yeon, who intended to jump from the second floor, let out a short scream.Rattle, rattle, rattle.Jung Hayan, who by now sensed that something was amiss, began to shake the door relentlessly.After making sure there were no telltale signs that Hwang Jeong-yeon had been here, I opened the door slightly, and the faces I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time reflected in my view.First, I saw Park Deokgu, whose simple smile I had missed.I didn\u2019t know why, but somehow, the guy\u2019s eyes were red. Looking at the wounds on his body, it seemed that the expedition was not easy.Of course, Jung Hayan looked the happiest. She first looked around the room to see if she could pinpoint where the scream had come from, but soon, she redirected her attention to me.In an instant, tears filled her large eyes. I, too, felt the same way. It felt great having her back.\u201cOh uh\u2026 Oppa\u2026\u201dWith this unfamiliar feeling bubbling up inside me, I began to stroke her head affectionately. Jung Hayan then began to sob.\u201cOh, Oppa\u2026\u201d\u201cWas the expedition hard?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d As she couldn\u2019t speak properly, Jung Hayan resorted to nodding her head vigorously.I tried to wipe all the tears from her face, but I couldn\u2019t. Instead, I opened my arms out wide, and Jung Hayan rushed in at once. Her face rubbed against my chest.\u201cI missed you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Hayan\u2026\u201dI was half-sincere in my words.Pretty soon, both Kim Hyunsung and Sun Hee-young appeared in my line of sight. Seeing as Hayan wouldn\u2019t let me go, I had to settle for waving at them as a form of greeting.I didn\u2019t even need to ask them. Assessing the atmosphere was enough.\u2018The expedition was successful.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cYep, Hyunsung. Did the expedition go okay?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t satisfactory, but it worked. Ye-ri had only managed to change to her second job since she was only on her first one, but Hee-young, Deokgu, and Hayan all finished their jobs. All of their stats also rose considerably.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201dI knew Kim Hyunsung\u2019s role as their nanny wasn\u2019t easy, either.Upon seeing Hyunsung\u2019s curious stare, I knew what was coming my way.\u201cHow about you, Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cThe same is true of me. I\u2019ve raised my stats and have gotten a new job.\u201d\u201cWhat did you get this time?\u201d\u201cOh? Hyung also got a new job?\u201d\u201cYes, I did. I\u2019ll go down and explain what it is.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because it would be difficult for me to explain what kind of job I got. It will be quicker to show you in person.\u201d\u201cIs this a high-grade alchemist job?\u201d\u201cYes. The status window says it\u2019s a newly-discovered job.\u201d\u201cYou mean it doesn\u2019t stem from your existing job?\u201d\u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m a little surprised.\u201d\u201cThanks to that, I had no choice. If several jobs appeared at the same time, I would have postponed choosing until you guys came back. However, there was no option. I don\u2019t regret getting it, however.\u201d\u201cHearing you say that makes me feel a little more curious.\u201dJung Hayan was still clinging onto me, but I could see that Park Deokgu also looked intrigued.\u201cAw\u2026 I should have been with you in that glorious moment\u2026 It\u2019s a shame my hyung couldn\u2019t have helped me choose my third job\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will also like mine.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dI didn\u2019t know how Kim Hyunsung would react to my new job, but I knew Park Deokgu would like it for sure.\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing that you managed to get a job on your own.\u201d\u201cSun Hee-young, however\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. For me, this is my fourth job change.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI could now understand why the atmosphere felt warmer. Everyone\u2019s relationships had improved. It felt like the new members had mixed well with the old ones.Park Deok-gu and Kim Ye-ri seemed to be highly attentive to Sun Hee-young\u2019s every move.\u2018Hmm.\u2019It seemed that she was now the third in command, right after Kim Hyunsung and I. Since she was the one with the highest specs during the expedition, it was natural for her to achieve this position.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Although she considers it a new service to beat indolent people useless to society, I knew she was still a competent person.She was different from Jung Hayan, and in that sense, she had gained such a position. However, I was hoping that it would be Park Deokgu, who would act more proactively.\u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s on that level yet\u2026\u2019Putting that aside, the overall atmosphere felt cheerful. We kept up a steady stream of conversation as we made our way to the training center for a demonstration.Demonstrations were necessary for the sole purpose of showing that the time spent in training was not for naught. I was always the one who garnered the least amount of attention. However\u2026This time, things were different.It was only natural that they should recognize my true value. I wasn\u2019t just an alchemist who rode off on their money. I knew their valuation of me would rise today.\u201cI want you to watch me properly. The magic power itself isn\u2019t that bad, but I haven\u2019t been able to determine its efficiency yet\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cHayan, can you step away for a moment?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. Oppa.\u201dAt this, I slowly began to memorize my intended spell. My prepared catalyst reacted as soon as I applied my magic to it.Since I didn\u2019t have that much magic power, I felt it was only right to use this amount of mana.There were two things that I had prepared.One was a catalyst depicting a magic circle with various magic types, and another was a catalyst that could receive spells. I also had materials with the same information value and materials that could interact with each other if needed.The quality of said materials was also important for the conjuring of the magic circle, but their information value took precedence.\u2018All of this was based off on Jung Hayan\u2019s application of magic to my teeth and other objects.\u2019As my thoughts began to scatter, I found myself getting a little distracted. However, it wasn\u2019t much of a struggle completing the rest of the spell. After all, this was a simple incantation.That was when the tiny monster cells that had been flying towards the spell began to expand. Watching the transition from cells to the flesh was grotesque, but it was intriguing to watch.Kwajijijik, kujik, kadedeuk.Incoherent sounds began to fill up the venue. It sounded like a cacophony of bones twisting and cells exploding.Although this was a sound that was familiar to me, it was not to the others. I saw Kim Ye-ri covering her ears and grimacing.Eventually, the huge flesh that I had conjured began to form into the shape I desired.The giant lump of flesh soon transformed into a giant monster hand.Quad-de-deuk!Even before all this happened, I could feel everyone\u2019s gazes directed my way, almost as if asking for an explanation.\u201cHuh\u2026 Hyung\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 How did you manage this?\u201d Even Kim Hyunsung was shocked.Upon seeing his reaction, pleasure began to crawl down my spine.\u201cIt\u2019s a characteristic that comes with my new job.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Think about how a television reacts to a remote. What I have in my hand right now is the remote control, and the arm of a giant monster over there is the TV.

It was strange to see I had gotten it.It was the knowledge obtained from the theory I established. What stood out was the fact that it was graded as a unique heroic-grade job.Everyone looked curious, so I smiled and spoke again.\u201cThe job\u2019s name is Bio-Alchemy Summoner, and it\u2019s ranked as unique heroic-grade.\u201d\u201cOhh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou mean it\u2019s of the unique heroic-grade rank?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPark Deokgu\u2019s expression seemed to drop. After checking his information, I understood why.He only got a rare-grade job?It turned out that everyone except him had gained a heroic-grade job.Even as a kid, Kim Ye-ri\u2019s growth was ridiculously fast, considering it was uncommon to get a heroic-grade job after only a second job change. Usually, a heroic-grade job would be obtained by the fourth or fifth job change.At this point, I knew I had to take care of Park Deokgu\u2019s mental state. Answering the questions of my fellow members took precedence, however.\u201cUnique heroic-grade\u2026 That\u2019s great, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of ranks other than rare, heroic, and legendary.\u201d\u201cKiyoung is probably the only one among us who can receive such a job. There are also a few adventurers within the city with unique ratings. Like Kiyoung, when they discovered something new, they received this class. It is said that latecomers are not given the same job even if they make the same actions or results.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cIn simple terms, it means that this job group cannot be duplicated.\u201dI liked the sound of that. Being special had its advantages. I knew my worth had gone up. I knew I was right when I saw Kim Hyunsung\u2019s excited expression.I had already wandered around the city to observe, and not once had I seen anyone with a unique heroic-grade job.If Kim Hyunsung was from the future, I daresay this could be an information breakthrough he was looking for.\u201cSince the job is specialized, there must be both advantages and disadvantages to it. It might hinder your progress towards potions or Homunculus\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve already thought about studying Homunculus, but I couldn\u2019t because I have low intelligence as of the moment. I also thought about controlling a chimera, but I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m not of the Warlock class.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cSince I couldn\u2019t control the whole chimera, I thought there should be some way to control part of it\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019m going to stop the spell now.\u201dUpon the recasting of my spell, the monster arm began to shrink. This was a revised version of Jung Hayan\u2019s spell, used for reversing magical effects.\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like a pet. It wasn\u2019t a living thing at first, and it doesn\u2019t have its own will, but the system judged it as a pet after my job change.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt looked great, but it didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t have its drawbacks.First, the quality of the material was very important. It had to be of decent quality to inject the magic circle with different types of magic. That meant only catalysts of at least rare grade could be used.The second was that its duration was not that long.Unlike most pets who eternally stood by their owners\u2019 side, mine could only be summoned for a short time.Another problem was that I could not build the whole body. I didn\u2019t know what could happen in the future, but I was only limited to creating a few body parts for now.Though the conjuring was done in the magical sense, its attack came in physical form. If I could find other unique monster catalysts, I could find a way around this. But for now\u2026What was more important than my judgment was Kim Hyunsung\u2019s opinion about the matter. It all depended on whether my skill could help his plans in the future.As if on cue, Kim Hyunsung nodded when I looked at him for guidance.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cI thought you could achieve something, but I hadn\u2019t expected you to accomplish so much,\u201d Hyunsung remarked.\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied, but quickly added, \u201cI still need to learn more about it, though\u2026\u201dJust knowing he was satisfied already made me feel better, and it wasn\u2019t just his reaction that sparked this satisfaction. My other party members also looked very surprised. Words of praise soon fell out of everyone\u2019s mouths, prompting a smile on my face.\u201cI always knew my Hyung was amazing\u2026 This is great,\u201d Deokgu commented.\u201cThank you, Deokgu,\u201d I replied.\u201cCongratulations\u2026\u201d Kim Ye-ri greeted. It was the first time I ever heard her speak properly.I smiled and tried to reach out to stroke her hair, but she quickly hid behind Kim Hyunsung.It was then that I noticed Jung Hayan\u2019s expression.She sported an anxious look, and I knew it wasn\u2019t because I had reached out for Kim Ye-ri.You\u2019re worried because I might have found out about your magic, aren\u2019t you?Since Jung Hayan had noticed that the alchemy method I had used was very similar to her magic application, she trembled. I knew she feared my discovery of her doings.I knew I had to inform her and set a boundary between us, but now was hardly the time.\u201cHayan,\u201d I called out.\u201cAh\u2026 Yes, Oppa\u2026\u201d she replied.I reached out to take her hand upon seeing her guilty expression.I have no choice but to let her drown in her guilt.It was best to make her realize that her choice was wrong.However, it would be best if I didn\u2019t discuss it with her directly. I would find a more appropriate timing to talk to her about it.\u201cShall we go for breakfast? Kiyoung also needs to know what jobs we\u2019ve obtained.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to tell me, but\u2026I felt it would be more appropriate to hear them explain than find out with my ability.\u201cI think the expedition went decently?\u201d I asked, trying to look na\u00efve.\u201cOh, it didn\u2019t. In fact, it was so hard at first that I thought we would have to retreat\u2026\u201d Hyunsung replied glumly, making everyone quiet.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to hear more details,\u201d I remarked.I didn\u2019t know how bad it was, but the quiet atmosphere made me think it was worse than I had initially imagined.\u201cWe first entered a rare-grade dungeon. However, it took us three days to leave,\u201d Hyunsung narrated.\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d I asked.\u201cIt was because of Jung Hayan\u2019s physical condition,\u201d Hyunsung replied.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI glanced over at Jung Hayan, who had hung her head in shame. I understood how this came to be.Until the moment they left, Hayan had stubbornly refrained from eating or sleeping properly and spent most of her time exerting her energy into needless actions.So that\u2019s why you all came back late.The three extra days Kim Hyunsung had talked about was probably to refine Jung Hayan\u2019s messed up mentality.\u201cDeokgu also took a very long time to adjust. I also found more things they should work on. It was the same with Ye-ri. Aside from being inexperienced, she tends to move unexpectedly. It would have been even more difficult if Hee-young wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Hyunsung recounted.The room stayed silent as she spoke.Go on. I\u2019m listening\u2026\u201cTheir formation also proved to be a mess. Had I not intervened, they would have been annihilated right off the bat. There were a lot of times when the rear was in danger because they had not fortified it, and times when the front felt too scared to stay in place because of the wayward trajectory of arrows,\u201d Hyunsung continued.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d I muttered and nodded.\u201cIt felt like the party would be wiped out at any time,\u201d she added.The way Kim Hyunsung explained to me was similar to how a parent would tell their spouse about their children\u2019s bad behavior.Not surprisingly, Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan\u2019s heads dropped even lower.\u201cBut the more times we went in, the more they improved. The results were not bad overall,\u201d Hyunsung remarked, changing her mood from glum to hopeful.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d I replied.\u201cWe also achieved stats of 60, and all of us succeeded in getting heroic-grade jobs,\u201d Hyunsung added.Wait, all of you got heroic class jobs? But Park Deokgu\u2019s status window\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s head back inside so I can explain it all in more detail.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take me long to understand why Kim Hyunsung had chosen to speak that way. Upon turning and seeing Park Deokgu\u2019s ashamed expression, I realized what he had done to mask what kind of job he had gotten.This pig\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI knew that Park Deokgu must have lied to them, and I could understand why he did it.He had probably consulted with Kim Hyunsung and Sun Hee-young and found out that everyone else had gotten a heroic-grade job. I did not know how badly he had performed during the expedition, but I did know that he felt inferior in its duration.It didn\u2019t help that Kim Ye-ri, who was only just a child, had gotten a job that was classed on a higher grade than him. After all, the kid was a genius.\u2018She\u2019s above legendary potential.\u2019Kim Ye-ri\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t just limited to her stats, either. One could see her enormous potential just by looking at her. If one were to think about how well she had performed back in the Garden of Terror as a newbie, then it was natural to see an immense improvement on her next expedition. However, it appeared that Park Deokgu was not aware of this.Geniuses belonged to a class far more sophisticated than the average human. I had not lived for a long time, but I\u2019d already seen a fair share of them.\u2018And not only on Earth\u2026\u2019I found just many here \u2013 people who showed talent far beyond the simple understanding of many.Jung Hayan casually made use of revolutionary magic as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Sun Hee-young had the potential to become legendary and held the party\u2019s center position with her unique calmness. There was Kim Ye-ri, a kid from the slums with exceptional talent. Even Kim Hyunsung, a returner from the future, brought with him a sense of potential that was insurmountable compared to most people.We were the only party whose members could all be classified as geniuses.Of course, even Park Deokgu had the potential to be a great adventurer, but when faced with the fact that he had natural geniuses on his team, I could understand how he must have felt.\u2018Everyone here is a monster.\u2019Even Hwang Jeong-yeon had said that she felt intimidated upon seeing Jung Hayan.Even so, Park Deokgu\u2019s decision to lie was quite surprising.Considering his personality, it would be correct to assume that he had chosen to lie without worrying about future consequences. It appeared that he prioritized his mental state above everything else, especially now that he found out I had also obtained a heroic-grade job.At this point, he must have felt like he was the only one being left behind.\u201cThe job I got this time was an Archmage,\u201d Hayan remarked.\u201cOh?\u201d I asked with a curious expression.\u201cYeah. It boosts a lot of magic and increases affinity for all kinds of attributes, and it doesn\u2019t only boost elemental magic\u2026 It also works the same for other types of magic. I can use magic more efficiently, and I\u2019ve also gained advanced magic knowledge. I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s amazing yet\u2026\u201d Hayan explained.\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s already great!\u201d I replied with a smile to cheer her up.\u201cAh, my magic power also rose to 69 this time, Oppa!\u201d Hayan added.\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, Hayan. You grew more than I thought you would,\u201d I praised.\u201cMy intelligence stats are also around 62,\u201d she added.\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d I asked, then she continued to blabber about the group\u2019s stats.\u201cHyunsung said that his stats rose to 70 as well. Sun Hee-young\u2019s stats went up by a lot, too, though she did not hunt much.\u201d\u2018Ah, it seems like this kind of growth only applies to people like you\u2026\u2019Park Deokgu\u2019s stats, as well as mine, only settle on the levels of 60.It was a little embarrassing for us to struggle at the same time, yet she grew even stronger than I did \u2013 but this didn\u2019t necessarily mean it was a bad thing.The stronger Jung Hayan gets, the safer I am.Of course, the opposite may happen to bite me in the ass, but this was good news for now. I began to appraise Hayan with my ability.[Archmage-Heroic Grade][This is a job given to those who have the qualifications to explore the truth of magic. Magical power is increased by five, and affinity for all types of magical power is also increased. Nothing is known about the jobs that it can be changed into afterward.]\u2018Good.\u2019It was a job with a plain-sounding name, but its description suited Hayan. It was a better title than, let\u2019s say, a murder mage or a madness mage.Of course, it wasn\u2019t just Jung Hayan who had shown immense growth. The same could also be said for Kim Hyunsung.I couldn\u2019t determine the direction of his growth, but at least Kim Hyunsung seemed to have avoided the purest form of examination.[Advanced Swordsmanship Trainee-Heroic Level][This is a job for those who practice learning the extremes of swordsmanship. Strength increases by 3, agility increases by 2, and magic power increases by 1.]There was no further explanation needed. The answer came just by looking at the description. For someone like Kim Hyunsung, a low-grade job such as this was only a passing opportunity for something greater. I knew he had chosen it for a reason. I also knew Hyunsung enough to know that he wasn\u2019t the type to make stupid choices.This time, he was the one who spoke.\u201cYe-ri got a job as a tracker.\u201d\u201cYou mean the tracker?\u201d I asked.\u201cYes,\u201d he nodded.\u201cAs a type of archer, I thought it would be okay for her to handle small and medium-sized weapons such as daggers and swords, as well as bows. In Ye-ri\u2019s case, her stats meant she is capable of this. Her focus is on agility and magic, so her options will continue to expand,\u201d Hyunsung explained.\u2018That\u2019s because she has no stats below the heroic level.\u2019\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to worry about being left alone anymore,\u201d I commented.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. That was quite a problem for our party. Oh, besides that, Sun Hee-young also changed her job as a Supreme Court. Her divine power has risen noticeably. Deokgu also said he got an avant-garde job related to tanking skills.\u201dUpon hearing this, I immediately assessed Sun Hee-young\u2019s title with my ability.[Dark Priest Supreme-Heroic Level]It seemed that Sun Hee-young had not explained her job to Hyunsung in detail. Upon hearing herself being mentioned, Sun Hee-young merely nodded.Her new job looked like an evolutionary version of her previous job, but I couldn\u2019t say for sure since there was no mention of any new spells or abilities.Whatever the case, our party was growing exceptionally well.Except for Park Deokgu, who was wearing an embarrassed expression, I knew we had substantially progressed.In truth, Park Deokgu had achieved amazing results if he stopped comparing himself to the rest of our genius party members. He would be welcomed wherever he went at this point.\u2018I need you to talk at least once\u2026\u2019It was natural for him not to speak up when others were so fixated on their achievements. I didn\u2019t want to let my team members know that I could see everyone\u2019s stats, so it would be impossible to call Park Deokgu out on his sense of inferiority.\u2018There\u2019s nothing as stupid as comparing yourself to a genius.\u2019It may sound a bit harsh, but I wanted Park Deokgu to realize that.Although the conversation had begun in a heavy atmosphere, it soon took on a lighter, happier tone. We soon started laughing about the mistakes they had committed in the dungeon and how I had been imprisoned in my workshop this entire time.When I heard that Jung Hayan cried every day and that Kim Hyunsung had to save the party countless times from danger, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. Even Kim Ye-ri, who hardly ever spoke, had begun to participate in the conversation in a slightly more confident manner.It was then that the guild\u2019s door opened with a rattling sound.We all turned to see Lee Seolho and Lee Sang-hee, walking in with heavy expressions.\u201cI will prepare for the meeting right now. Please call all the remaining executives in the guild.\u201d\u201cYou mean, everyone?\u201d\u201cYeah. There will be no exceptions. First of all, please, convene. The meeting will be held in my private office. How many parties are there right now?\u201d\u201cI know that the 2nd unit has returned.\u201d\u201cThe 7th unit also returned this morning, Lee Sang-hee, Lee Seolho.\u201d\u201cIf so, please send in for Hyunsung and Kiyoung as well.\u201d\u201cEven them?\u201d\u201cYes. Please summon them all. I have news about the guild.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay, that is noted.\u201d\u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019It wouldn\u2019t take a genius to notice that something was wrong. Lee Sang-hee\u2019s expression, usually so compassionate and mother-like, was now very pale. Even Lee Seolho looked worried.\u201cYou go up first. I\u2019ll catch up with you later.\u201d\u201cYes, please, Mr. Seolho.\u201dI could see general guild members also making their way up, probably to alert Hwang Jeong-yeon of the sudden meeting.From what I could remember, the second unit lived on the fourth floor.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cKiyoung, let\u2019s head up.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes, yes, of course.\u201dThe light atmosphere just moments ago suddenly became much heavier.I could see Lee Seolho glancing my way. Normally, I wasn\u2019t the type to butt in others\u2019 business, but I felt my actions were slightly justified this time around.\u201cOthers can use this time to do whatever they like. However, I recommend that you take this time to rest.\u201d\u201cNoted.\u201d\u201cOkay, I see.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019I felt slightly disoriented by the atmosphere. I could hear the murmuring of other guild members growing louder and louder at this point. They, too, seemed to have no idea about what was going on from what I could hear.\u201cKim Hyunsung, Lee Kiyoung. The Blue Guild Master is waiting for you\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. I will go up now.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cAh. Then I guess I\u2019ll head up as well.\u201dThe guild member who was undoubtedly tasked with alerting all members nodded and hurried out the door.As I went up to Lee Sang-hee\u2019s office in a hurry, I saw an armed guard opening the door. Kim Hyunsung and I were able to get past without hassle.\u201cIs everyone gathered?\u201d\u201cYeah. I think so.\u201dLee Sang-hee stood in front of us with a serious expression. Hwang Jeong-yeon and Lee Seolho were with her.\u2018What? This is all of us?\u2019It was ridiculous to say that these are all the people present.\u201cKiyoung, Hyunsung. Please sit down. I think it\u2019s time I deliver some bad news.\u201dI still couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on, even after considering everyone\u2019s expressions. Kim Hyunsung, however, seemed to have an expectant look on his face.\u2018Does he know what\u2019s about to happen?\u2019It was then I realized the reason why we had even chosen to enter Blue Guild.\u2018He knows.\u2019Kim Hyunsung knew what had happened. Whatever it was, it was the reason why he had chosen for us to enter the Blue Guild, despite having countless other choices during the recruitment.It was then that Lee Sang-hee, designated Vice Guild Master, opened her mouth to explain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe atmosphere itself felt very heavy. Even a newborn baby would be able to sense the change.Lee Sang-hee, who looked hesitant, finally spoke.\u201cCurrently, all parties except Blue\u2019s second and seventh units are isolated in hero-grade dungeons. Life and death counts have not yet been confirmed, yet they have confirmed the morning\u2019s rescue signal. Considering that they had not been able to send a second signal, it seemed that there was a problem with the parties entering the dungeon.\u201d\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019\u201cThe exact time they entered the dungeon was on the 14th of August, and our last contact was around 6:40 this morning. Is that right, Seolho?\u201d Sang-hee added.\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct,\u201d Seolho replied and nodded.If they had entered on the 14th of August, then that meant they had gone even before we were recruited in Blue Guild. I could sense how things had gone for them.\u2018Their expeditions have failed\u2026\u2019This was one of the typical reasons for the downfall of guilds. I had not yet been in Lindel long enough, yet this was common, obtainable knowledge.\u2018One expedition failure can make a small clan stumble, yet two will cause even a large guild to stumble.\u2019The danger was commonly known for everyone who would dare to enter a dungeon. At the same time, it was a testimony of power, which was what Lindel thrived on.If accidents were to happen during an expedition, it would inflict not only physical injuries but also social ones. It meant that the unit or party was not as powerful as they seemed to be.This was why ordinary clans and guilds invested a lot in preparing for expeditions. Weaker guilds had even resorted to recruiting trial parties to estimate the dungeon\u2019s difficulty.If the dungeon found was a dungeon with a hero level or higher, one needed to be more careful.Unlike rare dungeons where simple monsters appeared followed by the boss monster, hero-grade dungeons had different mechanisms for each dungeon.I had not even entered one yet myself, but I knew how risky it could be.\u2018The Blue Guild would eventually collapse because of several expedition failures.\u2019Kim Hyunsung must have already been aware of this situation. Sending in a rescue team must have been a predetermined procedure. Human resources were the topmost priority for every guild.No, before the topic of human resources, these people have been like family to each other. Blue had a long history, after all. If it were up to him, he would barge in and rescue them himself. However, there were certain procedures he still had to take note of.The question now was what choices we would make in light of this situation. Soon, voices rose in reaction to this. We started discussing what options we could take.\u2018It\u2019s a tabletop theory, anyway\u2026\u2019\u201cWould you like to ask another guild for support?\u201d\u201cI requested support from the Red Mercenary, but the answer is delayed due to the absence of the Mercenary Queen. We don\u2019t know how long it would take them to answer\u2026 Perhaps it would be too late by then.\u201d\u201cSo, do you mean for us to barge in without any planned countermeasures?\u201d\u201cI am not saying that. However, seeing as the rescue signal was sent just this morning, there is a large possibility that many of our personnel are still alive. That is why I called for an urgent meeting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only right that we send in a rescue team, but we admittedly don\u2019t have a lot of power. At this point, what we need is structure, not a strategy.\u201d\u201cIf you want to organize a rescue team, retired people can also\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, but at this point, even just doing administrative work can already tire us old men out\u2026\u201d Lee Seolho laughed nervously.\u201cBut our numbers aren\u2019t sufficient!\u201d\u201cHow is it not enough? We have the 7th unit, don\u2019t we?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe 7th unit\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the 7th party also considered as the main power of our guild?\u201d\u2018This deranged old man\u2026\u2019I decided to stay quiet. I could already see where this was heading. We would be sent in, regardless of what we could say in return.Though there would be information about the dungeon to aid us, the fact that the previous party had already failed meant that the expedition would be highly dangerous.Even if Hwang Jeong-yeon and Lee Sang-hee volunteered to act as the rescue team, it would still not be enough of a force.The question was how we should go about this. It would be of common opinion to dispatch a rescue team to save those in danger, but it seemed like people like Lee Seolho wouldn\u2019t be willing to throw their selves in harm\u2019s way.\u201cDidn\u2019t we pay an expensive amount for them? Now is the time for them to show that they\u2019re worth the money.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re a party that hasn\u2019t grown properly yet, Seolho.\u201d\u201cHwang Jeong-yeon, I know that very well. But isn\u2019t it the time for them to show what they\u2019re truly worth? We\u2019ll need all the help we can get.\u201d\u201cEven if you put it that way\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a guild crisis. It\u2019s only natural for them to help out.\u201d\u201cIf you think so, why don\u2019t you also go, Lee Seolho?\u201d\u201cAs a retired adventurer, I own a weak and fragile body. I have been devoting my entire life to the guild. As much as we\u2019d love to rescue those in danger, I have to stay and protect the guild in my own way.\u201d\u201cAh, but\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if we go, we won\u2019t be of much help.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u2018What obvious excuses\u2026\u2019Assessing this ridiculous atmosphere almost made me laugh. I knew what this senile geezer was thinking. If Lee Sang-hee and Hwang Jeong-Yeon entered the dungeon together, the one who would reap the most benefit by staying safely behind would be him.\u2018Just as I thought, he\u2019s a rabid old dog.\u2019After analyzing him with my ability, I could say his stats weren\u2019t all that bad. He may seem like a weak man on the outside, but I could see that he still had some fight left in him. However, he doubted he could safely make it out of an expedition, which was why he chose to opt-out of the operation.This meant that Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party\u2014my party\u2014would be caught in the middle. Whether this rescue expedition succeeded or not, most of the blame would fall on us.\u201cIt\u2019s still not the right time to dispatch the 7th unit.\u201d\u201cHuh, but there\u2019s no other way, is there?\u201d\u201cThese are people who have only been in Lindel for less than a year.\u201d\u201cBut they are also guild members of Blue, who received preferential treatment, nonetheless!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of preference. It\u2019s common sense. No guild in the city sends parties less than a year old to hero-grade dungeons. I mean, most guilds choose to dispatch trial parties\u2026\u201d\u201cHa! A trial party, what a joke! I say we dispatch them!\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dLee Sang-hee eventually put an end to the ongoing argument.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait. Both Seolho and Jeong-yeon are right. No matter how fast Hyunsung and others grow up\u2026 It won\u2019t help much.\u201d\u2018This is it.\u2019\u201cPlease protect the guild in my absence.\u201d\u201cAh, but\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it. This is my decision. For the rest of you also going, please ready your people. Aside from this, we can only rely on the support of other guilds now\u2026\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s your final decision, then\u2026\u201dI did not know if this was Kim Hyunsung\u2019s intention, but if it was, then I could understand why. If this rescue operation failed, then our party would soon become the most influential unit within Blue.Of course, there would be several problems to deal with, but assuming that we\u2019d be skipping a very complicated part of the process, we would achieve our goals in a much quicker fashion.\u2018However, things might not go as well as we would like for them to\u2026\u2019Conversely, it also meant that even Lee Sang-hee and Hwang Jeong-yeon might not make it back successfully. If we were to lose two powerful members, then the story would change. We needed to make sure that this wouldn\u2019t happen.The fact remained, however. It would take a little more time, but the power would eventually shift to us.The most important thing was what choice Kim Hyunsung would take now.It felt very frustrating not to know what he was thinking. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that he was completely unreadable. I knew Kim Hyunsung would be able to see the benefits in this situation.\u201cWe will go with you.\u201dKim Hyunsung reacted the way I expected him to.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI already told you. We will go with you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Thank you so much\u2026 This\u2026\u201dOf course, I had to support Kim Hyunsung\u2019s decision. I did not oppose the notion. Both Lee Sang-hee and Hwang Jeong-yeon had helped me in so many ways, after all.\u201cHyunsung is right. It is only right for us to go together.\u201d\u2018Ah, but I feel so anxious\u2026\u2019I knew there was another reason why Kim Hyunsung chose to take this path. Perhaps he was aware of the rewards we could reap from the dungeon we\u2019d be going into.After all, no matter how good Hyunsung\u2019s intentions were, he wasn\u2019t a saint.I took a deep breath and spoke.\u201cRecently, our whole party has been able to progress remarkably. All of us have acquired hero-level jobs as our third job, and our main stats are already in the line of 60s. In Jung Hayan\u2019s case, she has already reached the 70th level.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, I know that this is not enough. We are aware of the fact that our stats are insufficient for hero-grade dungeons. However, we are also members of the Blue Guild. Though we are only bonded via contractual means, it does not mean that we take our responsibilities lightly.\u201d\u201cKiyoung\u2026\u201d\u201cI have been helped by many people. This time, I would like to lend you our services. If we judge that we cannot continue any further, we will take the necessary protocols and retreat. However, we ask you to allow us the opportunity to help.\u201dI lowered my head a little. Everyone\u2019s reactions exploded at that moment. My actions might have seemed reckless, but it did not mean that it wouldn\u2019t garner positive attention.\u201cAh, I definitely want you guys to go with us!\u201d\u201cHaha, what a touching resolution!\u201d The only blight was the old geezer\u2019s amusement.\u201cLee Sang-hee, Mr. Kiyoung, and Mr. Hyunsung are volunteering. Since they have already acquired their third jobs, they may be able to be of help. Why don\u2019t you take them with you?\u201dFor all his stupidity, what the old man said was indeed correct.Perhaps I wasn\u2019t the only one thinking this way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThat looks good.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you had such strong minds to think about the betterment of the guild, haha.\u201dThe old geezer Lee Seolho remarked, but no one laughed with him.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only normal,\u201d I muttered.\u2018As I said, he\u2019s deranged\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t know just what old men like Lee Seolho had contributed to the Blue Guild in the past. Seeing how Lee Sang-hee showed respect for old men like him made me think that they had a deep connection with the absent Guild Master, but I suppose knowing didn\u2019t matter.It already felt unsettling to know that the intention of my party and his plans matched.\u201cWe\u2019ve already gained our third jobs, so that would definitely help,\u201d I remarked.\u201cAh, you\u2019re all really amazing\u2026 Worth the money\u2026\u201d Seolho commented.\u201cIsn\u2019t it all thanks to the guild\u2019s support? Hahahaha\u2026\u201d he added.Hwang Jeong-yeon gazed at Lee Seolho with suspicion. It was only natural for her to do so. The man was never known for being an optimist, so his sudden pleasant disposition naturally warranted some scrutiny from the others who knew how he truly was.\u201cThough there are others who willingly went to participate, there\u2019re still others that insist on staying to guard the guild. Don\u2019t you ever think about participating before pushing someone else to do it?\u201dI knew the remark was made for everyone too scared to join. It wasn\u2019t just Lee Seolho\u2019s expression who crumbled out of embarrassment upon hearing this. The others who were present also showed the same expression.\u201cW-Well\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will be hard for us to stand in the front lines\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we can provide the needed power\u2026\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone here play a different role to keep the guild running? We\u2019re non-combatants in the first place. Even Seolho Lee is retired. It will be difficult for us to gain the momentum needed to stand in the front lines.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. To me, it looks like you\u2019re avoiding responsibility.\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong. Just be honest and say that you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 Isn\u2019t that being a little too harsh?!\u201d\u201cI think you know who among us here is being selfish right now.\u201dEmotions clashed with each other. It was natural for Hwang Jeong-yeon to make this assumption. Anyone else would\u2019ve done the same. However, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it.They were undoubtedly part of the non-combatant forces. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to bring them along with us. They would probably prove to be a hindrance.\u201cYou really are all so shameless\u2026\u201dIt might be a delusion, but I could almost see Lee Seolho and the others wishing for our immediate deaths in the upcoming expedition. It would be the perfect opportunity to take control.If all combatants were unable to return alive in the hero-level dungeon, they would infringe on a new system, based on the influence that the Blue Guild had cultivated, with Lee Seolho in the center.The world was changing, so there was no way an old geezer like him could bring the Blue Guild back to its former glory. Rather, it would make perfect sense for them to sell the guild.\u2018Of course, it\u2019ll all come down to money-making.\u2019Although there would be no combatants left within the guild, the wealth, infrastructures, and Guild House has value.I had also thought Kim Hyunsung was considering this, so why wouldn\u2019t they think of the same thing? What I couldn\u2019t understand was why Lee Seolho seemed like the mastermind of their group.\u2018Does he have some sort of backing system?\u2019I was almost sure of it. Old people do not take risks. Gambling was more for younger people who wished to live a stable life.I could almost wager that the only reason these old men were able to hold positions within the Guild was from taking advantage of countless other people\u2019s sacrifices.If not, it didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was that they were responsible for the rotting of the guild.When the atmosphere seemed to rise in intensity, Lee Seolho spoke again.\u201cPlease stop it. Other people will also feel frustrated with what you are doing. Jeong-yeon also seems unusually excited today.\u201d\u201cMaster, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou cannot take administrative officers to a dungeon. The same goes for Lee Seolho. Considering that you are already retired and not in good shape recently, going with you is not a reasonable option. Of course, I know how Jeong-yeon feels. I feel the same way, too. Honestly, I am not happy with what you are both doing right now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this before\u2026 It feels embarrassing to show such unprofessionalism in front of Kiyoung and Hyunsung. The Blue Guild I imagined is not like this. Of course, your actions are reasonable. Indeed, you cannot leave the dungeon with the non-combatant army. I also know that your physical condition is not the same as before. Nevertheless\u2026 I am really disappointed to see how you are all choosing to express your frustrations. No, in fact, I am most disappointed with my incompetence.\u201dI knew regret welled up in both opposing parties\u2019 faces upon hearing this. The guilt would not go away unless they volunteered to join. Apart from this, I could also feel Lee Sang-hee\u2019s disappointment. She must have felt like she was abandoning Hyunsung and me from attaining a proper guild experience.Lee Sang-hee slowly began to look in our direction. I knew what she wanted to say even before she even spoke up.\u201cHyunsung and Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI really am sorry to take back my previous statement. Would you mind\u2026 going on this expedition with us?\u201dLee Sang-hee\u2019s voice trembled, and she had resorted to bowing her head. Tears had even begun to pile up in her eyes.\u2018This situation definitely does call for a change of mind.\u2019If this happened a month ago, she would never have allowed us to come along with them.\u2018That\u2019s why.\u2019Anyway, it seemed that we still had a chance of surviving, even with just 60 plus stats and a third job. I knew Lee Sang-hee had taken this into account, which was why she changed her mind.I understood the urgency. This was the worst situation the Blue Guild has ever experienced, and we\u2019d need all the manpower we could get, even if we were collectively lacking. We didn\u2019t even know if anyone from the missing parties would still be alive once we got there.I could understand why she was willing to take every opportunity she could get.Kim Hyunsung\u2019s answer to Lee Sang-hee\u2019s heartfelt request was obvious.\u201cOf course.\u201dI had to smile at his response.\u201cThank you,\u201d Sang-hee remarked.\u201cWe have to do what we have to do,\u201d Hyunsung added.Lee Sang-hee nodded and spoke again.\u201cThen, I shall prepare for the dispatching of the rescue team. We will immediately leave for the expedition.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s noted.\u201d\u201cSo, it stands. The second and seventh units shall go with me. Please get ready as soon as possible. We will leave in as early as half an hour.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cFor those who shall remain in the guild, please meet with the other guilds, including the Red Mercenaries. Please send a backup to the expedition as soon as contact has been made.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cSeolho\u2026\u201dLee Sang-hee called out and shifted her attention to Lee Seolho.\u201cYes, Lee Sang-hee?\u201d Seolho asked.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t disappoint me. And\u2026 I\u2019ll choose to believe in you,\u201d Sang-hee remarked.The old geezer was quick to respond in a seemingly sincere tone.\u201cI will repay your faith, Lee Sang-hee. As soon as we get in touch with other guilds, reinforcements will come your way.\u201cThank you.\u201dAt this, Lee Sang-hee ran out, not wanting to delay any further. Hwang Jeong-Yeon followed suit, and even the administrative members moved with a sense of urgency. Kim Hyunsung and I did the same.After coming down to the first floor, I witnessed the rest of our party members already assembled. Seeing as Sun Hee-young had taken the initiative to be in charge, it seemed that preparations for the expedition didn\u2019t need to be taken care of anymore.This was the perfect timing for my skills, as I had done more than just prepare for the expedition.\u2018What a pity\u2026\u2019Lee Sang-hee was a good person. However, she was not an ideal leader. To put it simply, I found her way of thinking foolish.Faith was, of course, a good tool when dealing with great people, for example, like Deok-gun or Baek-Yi.Lee Sang-hee may have the same feelings for Lee Seolho and his idiotic underlings. However, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that Seolho would pay tribute to the faith she had given him.I did not know the source of Lee Sang-hee\u2019s deep faith, but I could take a guess \u2013 she had faith in those she had been with for a long time. And she held the belief that even if the guild were in danger of being ruined, they would stay together until the end.It didn\u2019t matter if I was right or wrong. That kind of belief usually gets shattered by betrayal. In my opinion, these old geezers weren\u2019t different from the poor people that had hurt Sun Hee-young. Their only difference was the fact that they were lucky enough to score a position. They also knew how to step on others to work their way up.I couldn\u2019t blame them for choosing to use their abilities. However, it just meant they were good at nothing else other than this trickery.\u2018Faith is\u2026\u2019It was an emotion that persisted as long as both parties knew they could still benefit from each other. In the old men\u2019s eyes, they probably couldn\u2019t see any benefits that would come from helping Lee Sang-hee out.\u201cWe shall depart in thirty minutes\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Hayan.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to get anything else for you, Oppa?\u201d\u201cAh, Hayan. I actually do. Can you get me something?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI have to run errands right now\u2026 I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\u201cSure. Just tell me what you need.\u201dKim Ye-ri, who was already looking in my direction with a suspicious expression, began to approach me right after Jung Hayan ran off.\u2018Huh. She notices things fast.\u2019\u201cCan you also run some errands for me?\u201dShe simply nodded her head in response.\u201cIt\u2019ll be of great help to Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cCan you give a letter to someone named Lee Ji-hye from the Black Swan Guild?\u201d\u201cLee Ji-hye?\u201d\u201cYes, Lee Ji-hye. If it\u2019s possible, it\u2019d be better if no one sees you do it. Please don\u2019t try to read it halfway through, either.\u201dy\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you say I sent you, they will welcome you. You need to go as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dShe disappeared in an instant. My thoughts were in turmoil at this point. I didn\u2019t even know if I was doing the right thing. However, I knew I was correct to some extent.Why? One may ask.Because I knew nothing good would come from putting faith into what I knew were my enemies.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect timing for some exposure\u2026\u201dI knew it was necessary to start removing the rotten executives from the guild.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLee Sang-hee\u2019s voice resonated within the room as I read Lee Jihye\u2019s letter brought by Kim Ye-ri.\u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI stuffed the letter into my pocket and got up from my seat, nodding. By the time we left the dungeon, my plan would be in progress.Right now, I had to focus on the expedition itself.The total number of members for the expedition was 14. We had six people from our party, seven people from the party managed by Hwang Jeong-yeon, and Lee Sang-hee herself, who would lead the expedition.Though we lacked in number, we at least had some capable members.First of all, it was important to note that Lee Sang-hee was a paladin with a stat of 90. She was a talented individual who was not a good leader but was exceptional as a combat agent. She was the best tanker of any avant-garde I\u2019d ever seen.Her agility level was low, but the merit of having 77 magic power and having self-healing abilities meant she was unmatched by any other tanker in Lindel.\u2018The same goes for Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2026\u2019The 2nd unit also had decent overall stats. They averaged the 70 to 80 levels, and their overall potential was not bad. They were the ones who had the appropriate stats to enter the hero-grade dungeons.\u201cSince we lack the time, we\u2019ll brief you on the way. Please note that our priority is not to clear the dungeon.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cOur purpose is to identify and rescue the survivors. If I determine that there are no other survivors, I will immediately call for our retreat. The rescue of the survivors is important, but your safety is more important than anything else. I hope you always keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cThe level of the dungeon we are entering is of hero-grade, and the name of the dungeon is the Cursed Shrine. The types of monsters that will appear are ghosts and undead, and other detailed information has not yet been confirmed. We will search for survivors as safely as possible until backup arrives.\u201d\u201cHow long will this take?\u201d\u201cIt is a dungeon found in the undead hunting grounds within the western region of Lindel. It will take about 8 hours to get to the destination.\u201d\u201cAh, so it won\u2019t take that long.\u201dAlthough we had prepared for the expedition in such a hurry, I still felt surprised to find out that we had scarce information about the dungeon we were entering.I could understand why so many parties had failed.No matter how much I thought about it, entering a hero-grade dungeon with little to no information beforehand seemed like a very risky endeavor one should not take.If the dungeon\u2019s grades were a rare grade, of course, it would be no problem at all.\u2018Was there any reason for them to enter?\u2019I thought that there was a possibility that the cause of the failure could be caused by arrogantly entering with the mindset of \u2018What could happen when I\u2019m using this amount of power?\u2019It was only natural for me to feel curious. Hwang Jeong-yeon saw this and approached me.\u201cThe information is a bit lacking.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s because we\u2019re in a rush.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I didn\u2019t have enough time to prepare for the expedition. It was a mistake to think about what could happen in a hero-grade dungeon because almost all the guild\u2019s power was put into the dungeon. Did you know that the Blue Guild Master is cursed?\u201dOf course, this was the first time I heard of it.\u201cNo. This is the first time I heard it.\u201d\u201cAh. It was meant to be kept under wraps. Lee Sang-hee is most likely waiting for the perfect time to tell you.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt happened before you joined the party, Kiyoung. The Guild Master suffered a curse from an unknown force, and to dispel it, he forcefully entered the Cursed Shrine. In fact, I didn\u2019t think it was impossible at the time. The guilds members who left for the expedition were veterans specializing in hero-grade dungeons or hunting large monsters.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019It was a common mistake. If the expedition were composed of veterans at least on Hwang Jeong-Yeon\u2019s level, they must have thought they were more than capable of legendary dungeons, much less hero-grade ones.\u201cIs there any info to be gained from the Cursed Shrine?\u201d\u201cIn fact, even I\u2019m not so sure about that. The curse that the Guild Master suffered was obtained in the process of discovering the Cursed Shrine, and of course, I thought there might be a solution to the dungeon that caused it. He was the one who reached out to open the dungeon entrance\u2026\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dTo put it simply, the Blue Guild Master was cursed for simply discovering the dungeon, so the veterans under him went in to search for a way to dispel it.It was as if it was the dungeon\u2019s way of attracting more adventurers.\u2018And to think, this is the dungeon we\u2019re about to get ourselves into\u2026\u2019All of a sudden, I felt a little anxious. This eerily felt just like a horror movie, where the noble guys who tried to save their fallen friend would also get caught up in the bad events.This time, I had no choice but to hope that it wouldn\u2019t be like that.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I just sort of expected that there was a reason for the Guild Master\u2019s absenteeism. I just didn\u2019t find it in me to dig in further. I was too busy focusing on my growth.\u201d\u201cAhh, yes. Lee Sang-hee probably didn\u2019t want you to worry about it.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, Hayan.\u201d Perhaps I had spent too much time talking to Hwang Jeong-yeon.I greeted Jung Hayan and stepped up to match her stride, and her frown immediately shifted into a smile. However, given the severity of the situation, I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to resort to hand-holding. Jung Hayan seemed to understand this since she wasn\u2019t pulling at my sleeves.Meanwhile, the road we were taking was an uphill that was too steep for wagons and the like.Since I lacked in the physical category, I struggled to keep up with everyone else. However, we were still approaching our destination at a faster pace than expected.\u2018It\u2019s probably because of the sense of urgency.\u2019It was understandable for them not to show any consideration for the members with low stamina. For now, I had no choice but to match their stride while taking in health potions that I had brought with me.As the enemies we were going to deal with were the undead, it seemed that the priests thought it was good to save their divine power as much as possible.Eventually, when less than half a day had passed, we arrived at the area where the undead was located. This was the first time I encountered a monster called undead. It looked curious, snooping here and there.\u201cNo\u2026\u201dThe priests were openly frowning.In the case of Sun Hee-young, who had a job as a dark priest, it seems that she was not struggling as much as the rest of them, but she was certainly still affected.Kim Ye-ri clung onto Kim Hyunsung as if she was timider than she initially thought. Park Deokgu, originally the timid one, had a constricted expression due to the gloomy atmosphere.Among our party members, Jung Hayan and Kim Hyunsung were the only ones who were still in good shape. Kim Hyunsung, who knew about this area in the first place, could not understand why Jung Hayan seemed to be smiling.The more we entered, the darker the atmosphere became.It wasn\u2019t just because it was nighttime. There was something about this place that seemed to press on us. It felt unpleasant to continue with the damp, humid air, but we pushed through. The undead sounds coming from god knows where only amplified the tension.To be precise, this was a place that sparked irritation. In particular, the more we walked, the more the negative feelings within me intensified.\u2018Does this have something to do with the curse?\u2019I couldn\u2019t possibly know. Something about this place hindered my normally critical thinking.\u201cDoes this place make you feel annoyed? Or is it just me\u2026\u201d Deokgu asked.\u201cI feel it too, Deokgu. It will probably get worse the deeper we get in,\u201d I replied glumly.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Deokgu said in a miserable tone.\u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with people like the undead\u2026\u201d he added.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped,\u201d I replied coldly.With all the whispering and talking, it didn\u2019t take long for us to reach our destination\u2014a small room found inside the temple.There was something very wrong with it.When I flipped the bookshelf in the small room, the entrance to the dungeon came into view.There was one more new entrance in the room. I didn\u2019t know what exactly it was, but I noticed that it had a pendant of a beast hanging upside down, like a bad omen.Was this a shrine?\u2018It looks like a place where the devil is being worshiped.\u2019Looking at the basement entrance, I thought I knew the reason why the Blue Guild Master, who found this place, was cursed, especially considering how confident he was about his abilities.\u2018It\u2019s like breathing in itself can make you cursed\u2026\u2019As I was looking around and assessing the atmosphere, Lee Sang-hee spoke up.\u201cI will be the first to enter. Unit 7 will follow, and unit 2 will enter right after. Priests, please recite the purification spell.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSun Hee-young and a man from the second party could be seen reciting the spell. As soon as their light poured over us, the constricted feeling in my chest loosened a little.\u2018It\u2019s working.\u2019Everyone else nodded, and Lee Sang-hee moved.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cOppa.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s\u2026\u201dOf course, it is natural that we as we entered. The information of the place immediately spilled over.[You have entered the heroic dungeon Cursed Shrine. The number of people [??/??] has been confirmed.]I thought the battle would start right away, but this wasn\u2019t the case.Unlike the Garden of Terror, where the landscape seemed to change completely, the Cursed Shrine did not feel like it was separated from the outside. It felt like being in a huge shrine underneath the temple.The interior in itself looked sluggish for one as tense as me. As soon as I looked around, one of the archers in our group spoke.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be anything nearby. We don\u2019t know the details yet, but the other traces around here seem to be harmless.\u201dAs the archer said, this area seemed safe. It seemed like the previous party had completed the attack here.Though the atmosphere still felt heavy, I didn\u2019t seem to be as affected as before.\u201cIt looks like the coast will be clear for some time.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. I think we can move faster for a bit.\u201d\u201cI will do as you say. Priests, please be prepared to recite spells at any time.\u201d\u201cYes, okay.\u201dIt seemed like the party was approaching this a little faster than I thought, but that didn\u2019t mean we would neglect our boundaries.I couldn\u2019t see anything dangerous just yet, but because this dungeon had already swallowed up tons of parties in the past, I wasn\u2019t willing to let my guard down.\u2018It looks like they\u2019ve cleared this part with not a trace of evidence.\u2019One didn\u2019t need to be an archer to notice this. The deeper we got in, the cleaner the interior looked. Seeing this, I figured the previous parties did not have too much of a hard time in the beginning.\u201cNext\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to enter the next room.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIt was then that I heard a voice I had never heard of until now.The curse will fall upon you.\u2018What the hell\u2026?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Honestly, I felt like leaving this place right away.Lee Sang-hee and the second party remained calm, but our party seemed a little confused.The curse will fall\u2026\u201cCan you feel the magic power?\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t sense anything. There isn\u2019t even any divine magic\u2026\u201dI will curse these intruders\u2026\u201cPerhaps it is a function that is planted in the dungeon.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of curse is it\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. For now, this voice is our only lead.\u201d\u201cStep back for now and cast the Holy Defense spell,\u201d Lee Sang-hee ordered.Suddenly, I felt my eyes turning white from the harsh wind that had suddenly picked up. I didn\u2019t know what was happening. However, I felt dizzy. The urge to vomit was prominent. It felt like the world around me was changing. Of course, this did not seem like an appropriate expression. It wasn\u2019t easy trying to explain what kind of phenomenon we were experiencing.For a moment, I believed everyone around me was experiencing the same thing.After the landscape changed, the unknown voice spoke again, appearing a little startled.Why did you do that?Why\u2026 did you abandon me?\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019A familiar woman stood in front of me. I remembered who she was. She was the one I had left to be eaten by the monsters back at the tutorial dungeon. I believed I had no choice but to leave her to save myself, but I could never forget her. She had chosen to prioritize drinking water and food instead of escaping\u2026I told myself this to ease my anxiety, but I had always felt sorry.\u201cWhat is this situation\u2026?\u201dI didn\u2019t care about the fact that she was approaching me with her intestines dropping onto the floor; the memory of her being eaten by the monsters still flashed in my mind.I was frowning, but I wasn\u2019t scared.I already knew.\u2018This is fake.\u2019It hurt\u2026 It hurt so much\u2026 I thought you would save me\u2026 Instead, you turned your back on me\u2026\u201cFuck.\u201dYou are a sad excuse for a human.\u201cPark Hyaeyoung\u2026\u201dEven the voice of Park Hyaeyoung, who died because of Jung Hayan, resonated in my ears.When she appeared, her arms and legs were amputated, and her eyes were full of resentment. I knew their resentment stemmed from the fact that they didn\u2019t choose themselves.Of course, in Hyaeyoung\u2019s case, it had been possible to save her.Nevertheless\u2026\u2018I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty.\u2019You always defend yourself with that thought. It was a reasonable choice. I couldn\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a reasonable option. To me, you are the kind of human being that should never have existed.\u201cAre you even qualified to say that to me?\u201dIt was then that Jung Jinho appeared. Seeing him with a sword stuck to his neck made me feel a little queasy.It is no different. We are the same kind of person. We are selfish and greedy. Did Seokwoo die because he needed to?Now the people Sun Hee-young had killed appeared. Those related to me were showing themselves one by one.\u2018Was this the curse they were talking about?\u2019I didn\u2019t think anyone else could see what I was seeing. It was just a hunch, but it felt like the illusion meant for me to see the things or people I would hate to see the most.I could sense the guilt within me, stirring me up, and it did not feel good.You killed us.\u201cShut up,\u201d I exclaimed. I was getting annoyed at this point.You only rely on rationalization. You\u2019re a coward.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with rationalizing? Humans are designed to find rationality,\u201d I snapped back.And you feel guilty.\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling I can have, of course, but I don\u2019t regret it,\u201d I remarked coldly.You\u2019re worse than trash.\u201cIs that all you can say? The fact remains that I am the only one alive, and all of you are not. I will never change. Once a situation like that happens again, I will do the same,\u201d I replied firmly.Someday, you\u2019ll be here with the rest of us.\u201cYou can wish as much as you would like.\u201dMy vision then began to get much brighter. Those looking at me with those haunting expressions slowly began to scatter, and their insults began to intensify. I fell silent.It was not pleasant to see the bodies of those who should be dead. My entire body was soaked in a cold sweat. My legs began to shake, and my lips felt dry.\u2018It\u2019s fake\u2026 This is all fake\u2026\u2019You think so? Is this fake?\u2018Shut up.\u2019Even after I returned to reality, the voices never left my head.\u2018Shit.\u2019You killed us.\u2018Shit.\u2019You killed us. You!\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019This was giving me more psychological damage than expected. As I gasped hard, I felt someone tapping my shoulder. I shuddered.\u201cGet off, right now!\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201dWhen I realized it was only Kim Hyunsung, I began to relax.Yes. All of that was fake. I had to return to reality.\u201cAh\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m fine.\u201dKim Hyunsung had sent a little bit of magic my way.\u2018The others\u2026\u2019Everyone was probably going through the same thing as me, just with different illusions. As expected, an inexplicable landscape came into view.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dI could see Kim Ye-ri trembling and shaking her hand relentlessly as if to get rid of something. No, it seemed like she was trying to push away whoever was approaching her.\u201cStop\u2026 Stop. Mom\u2026 Mom! Help me! Please save me, mom\u2026 Please\u2026\u201dJudging from what I could hear, she was likely reliving a memory she had back in the slums. I didn\u2019t need to see the scene to know that it was terrible.Park Deokgu, meanwhile, was crouching. When I saw him trembling without saying a word, I tried my best to imagine what he could see.Sun Hee-young was also crying. She wasn\u2019t screaming, but blood was running down her mouth. It appeared that they had all been biting their lips tightly.Of course, the person who showed the most incomprehensible act among them was Jung Hayan.\u201cI hate it! I hate it\u2026 Please, Oppa\u2026 Oppa\u2026 Oppa!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I did everything wrong. Please. Please\u2026 I\u2019ll do better in the future. Please don\u2019t throw me away. Please\u2026\u201d\u2018Fuck.\u2019Honestly, I felt like her situation was serious. Tears were running down her eyes, and her nails were stained with blood. She had torn off her flesh with her hands. Seeing that her hair was sparse, it looked she had ripped off some of her hair as well.\u201cOh, no\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that with her. Don\u2019t do that, Oppa. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I hate this! I hate it so much!\u201dI couldn\u2019t predict just what she was seeing in her landscape. All the other people wore similar disoriented expressions, stuck in their illusions.Although I could see people waking up halfway through, most of them settled for falling and screaming, confusion evident on their features.Lee Sang-hee was busy apologizing to whoever she had encountered.\u201cSorry. I\u2019m really sorry. Really\u2026\u201dI could guess what she was seeing \u2013 it was her letting down her fellow guild members. Since she had always been worried about the members in danger, I knew it was only a natural reaction.Hwang Jeong-Yeon, who was crying quietly, also woke up, looking around in mild panic.Except for Kim Hyunsung, most of those that had awakened were those who possessed high intelligence. They had individualistic differences, but their similarity in intellect was distinct. Jung Hayan\u2019s case might be peculiar, as she was the only one with high intelligence that was still stuck in her landscape.\u2018That\u2019s because her mind is unstable.\u2019\u201cHyunsung, what happened\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve also just woken up.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been here long. I don\u2019t really understand\u2026\u201dIt had felt like hours inside my hallucinations. It was hard to believe that all of it had happened within a moment.Of course, in my case, I settled for solving the situation instead of grasping it. After erasing the questions lingering in my head, I spoke once more.\u201cHow can one wake up?\u201d\u201cIt would be best to put one\u2019s magic power slowly. Divine magic will be a little more efficient, but\u2026 I think it\u2019d be better for Kiyoung to focus on saving Hayan first.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Of course.\u201dKim Hyunsung then stepped towards Sun Hee-young\u2019s direction, deciding it would be best to free her first. Hwang Jeong-yeon thought the same thing as she approached her party\u2019s priest.As soon as I managed to clear my mind, the strange sensation left my body.I, too, slowly stepped towards Jung Hayan.\u201cI have to kill\u2026\u201d\u2018What was she talking about?\u2019\u201cI have to kill it all\u2026 I have to kill them all. That way, I can become one with my Oppa. Okay. Yes. That\u2019s right. I have to kill them all.\u201dJung Hayan continued to mutter in a voice too quiet to be heard by others. I didn\u2019t know what she meant by \u2018becoming one,\u2019 but it sure did sound scary. As I quietly approached, pushing in my magic, I felt Jung Hayan gradually awakening.\u201cWe will always be together,\u201d I whispered into her ear.Knowing Jung Hayan, she would snap out of it soon. And, to my expectations, she did. Her rough breathing slowly stabilized. Seeing that her body had stopped trembling, I knew she would come to her senses sooner or later.Then, Jung Hayan looked in my direction.\u201cOppa?\u201d Hayan asked and tilted her head. Obviously, she was still recovering from her sudden awakening.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked in a concerned tone.\u201cF-Fine\u2026 Oppa\u2026\u201d she replied.\u201cH-Huh?\u201dJung Hayan tackled me into a tight hug. I felt suffocated, but I couldn\u2019t shake her off.\u201cOppa\u2026 Oppa, Oppa\u2026\u201dShe kept calling me.\u201cYes, I\u2019m here, Hayan.\u201dAs soon as I said this, Jung Hayan dissolved into sobs. It felt like taking care of a child who had just experienced a nightmare, but it didn\u2019t feel all too bad.You\u2019ll throw her away too.Although the voices never left me, it was natural for me to ignore them. This was the effect of the curse, after all.It\u2019s not an effect of the curse. It\u2019s the voice you hear in your own heart.Perhaps I wasn\u2019t the only one who was hearing voices inside their heads. Even after some of the others had woken up, they continued to talk to themselves.Eventually, no one will be left by your side. You\u2019ll have thrown them all away. Those next to you will also look at you with contempt someday. Someday\u2026\u201cIs it really you, Oppa?\u201d Hayan asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s me,\u201d I replied.\u201cIt\u2019s really Oppa\u2026\u201d she remarked. Her facial expression went from miserable to hopeful instantly.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dJung Hayan\u2019s anxiously spoke, trying to make sure that I was real, that this wasn\u2019t just another illusion. It made me wonder what kind of voice she was hearing in her head.I gulped while I continued to look down at Jung Hayan.\u2018This doesn\u2019t feel right\u2026\u2019Jung Hayan\u2019s condition didn\u2019t seem too stable.In fact, she seemed like a bomb that could detonate at any minute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt wasn\u2019t just Jung Hayan who was acting this way.I couldn\u2019t say that the others were doing better than her, but they still exhibited signs of paranoia and anxiety even after their illusions had gone.Kim Ye-ri was one of them.That kid had always expressed a calm disposition, but now she was tightly clinging onto Kim Hyunsung, and fear was evident in her expression.As she was still just a child, I could understand why she would react that way. I didn\u2019t know what she had seen, but I was almost sure it had been one of her most traumatizing experiences.The same went for Jung Hayan. I could almost guess her illusion was taking the form of me abandoning her. Because of this, I realized that the curse was made to target the weak points of every individual present.Slowly, however, everyone awakened. Though they had escaped the influence of the curse, no one dared to speak.As I soothed a trembling Jung Hayan, gently stroking her hair, Lee Sang-hee spoke up.\u201cPhi, please report the damage situation.\u201d\u201cAh, the curse seems to be purely mental. It creates hallucinations for anyone who comes across it.\u201d\u201cIs there anyone who can\u2019t move?\u201d\u201cNo one has been injured.\u201dNo physical damage had been inflicted. However, it had caused a great toll on everyone mentally. Now, I was beginning to understand why the previous Blue Guild parties had been annihilated here.If the curse continued to haunt everyone here, or if it would begin to get worse\u2026\u2018That\u2019s when the situation can get out of hand.\u2019Lee Sang-hee massaged her temples for a moment before speaking once more.\u201cCan anyone hear voices inside their head?\u201dShe received no answer.When it was apparent that no one dares to speak up, I did.\u201cI can.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it will be the same for the others.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the divine cleansing spell is effective. The curse is probably built into the dungeon itself. It\u2019s most likely triggered when entering a certain area, or when one has stayed for some time.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s a good line of reasoning.\u2019Lee Sang-hee had gone back to her poised self. I glanced at Kim Hyunsung and saw him nodding, which meant that she had given a correct hunch.\u201cHowever, the symptoms might get worse later on. If this kind of curse is activated when we\u2019re facing the undead\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t need to explain further. It would cause severe damage to the party. However, I knew the undead wasn\u2019t the real problem here; the curse was.Undead or ghost, it didn\u2019t matter. They were trivial appetizers. As the dungeon\u2019s name suggested, the real obstacle in this place would be the curse inflicted upon us.Eventually, you will be left alone.\u2018Shut your mouth.\u2019I knew we would not be able to control the situation unless we got used to the curse. Though Lee Sang-hee, Kim Hyunsung, and I had already adjusted, I knew Hyunsung\u2019s situation was different from ours.However, it was well known that Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party was growing fast. It would be no exaggeration to say that our growth speed was incomprehensible. Even I had been able to catch up, thanks to Tucker and my resources.It went without saying that our specs could reach up to legendary. However, just because we had high potential didn\u2019t automatically mean we were strong.Our party had a load of mental problems. The growth of one\u2019s mind can\u2019t possibly be on par with the growth of the body.\u2018Was this Kim Hyunsung\u2019s goal all along?\u2019Perhaps Kim Hyunsung had brought us along for this very purpose? However, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed unlikely. I knew he wasn\u2019t the type to disregard the possibility of people losing their lives. If this were a normal dungeon, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to send us in.\u2018The situation is serious now.\u2019Our party wasn\u2019t the only one suffering. The rest of the group was, too.In this kind of situation, there were only three options available.The first was to return.There was too little information about the dungeon itself. It didn\u2019t matter if our main focus was to rescue our guild members. If the previous expedition leader had been more cautious, he would have chosen this option.The second was to continue.This was not recommended. As we didn\u2019t know our survivors\u2019 condition, there was a sense of urgency that couldn\u2019t be ignored.The third one was\u2026\u201cFirst of all, it would be better to set up a camp here.\u201d\u2018Right.\u2019\u201cFor melee workers, please form a group and search the surroundings. Try to find information that can help with our next strategy. The rest of the people will set up camp here. Please prepare a meal. It\u2019s about time for us to take a break. The second unit should take charge.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 But are you feeling okay?\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t seem to have been heavily influenced by the curse. Although I can hear the voices\u2026 It\u2019s not enough to bother me.\u201d\u201cAh. If so\u2026 Then please do, Mr. Hyunsung.\u201dI think this was the best option we could have taken. Even before we had been cursed, the entire party already felt exhausted.It had been over half a day and six hours since we had entered the shrine. If we continued to push ourselves to search in this state, we\u2019d reach our limits and burn out faster than we\u2019d think.In particular, our priests and sorcerers were the ones who had worked themselves out the most, so it was only proper to give them ample time to rest.\u201cAfter we rest here, we can resume tomorrow morning. If we don\u2019t find anything or anyone after three days, we\u2019ll retreat. And\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be better for all of you to find a way around your curse.\u201d\u201cIs that even possible?\u201dI felt like it wasn\u2019t. Usually, a curse was semi-permanent.\u201cYes, it is. For now, please focus on recovering your body. The countermeasures will be formed after the search team returns.\u201dOnce Lee Sang-hee finished speaking, a few people with high agility stats, including Kim Hyunsung and Kim Ye-ri, stood up and went out.Meanwhile, the rest of us did our best to set up camp.Seeing that he was so willing to head out, it seemed that Kim Hyunsung had some sort of plan as to how we were going to tackle this situation.\u2018Maybe he knows of another hint.\u2019If their task was to risk themselves searching for more information, then our task wasn\u2019t just to set up camp. It was also to help ease everyone\u2019s mentality.I didn\u2019t even have to ask for confirmation\u2014this task was up to me.Contrary to Sun Hee-young, who had quickly found stability, Deokgu, who still had a blank expression plastered on his face, looked like he needed some help.I didn\u2019t need to do much with Jung Hayan. She\u2019d be alright as long as I was beside her.Seeing that people were having conversations as they worked, I thought that would be my best course of action.\u201cDeokgu.\u201d\u201cOh, Hyung\u2026\u201dHe had on a remarkably shaky expression as he looked up at Jung Hayan and me.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.\u201cW-Well, of course,\u201d Deokgu replied.\u201cI\u2019m asking you seriously,\u201d I said firmly.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to worry about me, Hyung. Take good care of Hayan because I can\u2019t.\u201d\u2018This pig\u2026\u2019\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\u201cNothing special.\u201dPark Deokgu seemed to think that opening up would mean he would become even more of a burden. As I quietly assessed him, I could see the anxiety written on his face. So, I took the initiative.\u201cI heard the voices of those I killed or those who died in front of me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw Yoo Seok-woo and Park Hyaeyoung, who could not be saved. Of course, I also saw the faces of Jung Jinho and his men. He told me I was going to die soon. They even told me not to rationalize their deaths.\u201dHe fell silent.\u201cHow about you?\u201dPark Deokgu\u2019s expression shifted into worry, to the point where I wondered if it was right for me to push him into telling. Perhaps it was about his weakness or trauma, so it was only natural for me to be careful.However, I knew it was necessary for him to speak, so I could help him out.\u201cWell, I\u2026 Hyung, I saw you and the other party members die. I was fighting a giant monster\u2026 I wasn\u2019t able to do so because I couldn\u2019t hold onto it. I also hesitated upon seeing both of you injured\u2026 I\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201dIt was quite a shock to see tears forming in Deokgu\u2019s eyes as he spoke, and he stuttered in a way that one would think he was choking.I knew Park Deokgu was weak, but I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be this weak.\u201cEven when I killed Yoo Seokwoo\u2026\u201dPark Deokgu couldn\u2019t find it in himself to look at the scene.\u201cThen I saw all of you blaming me, that you all died because of me\u2026 It\u2019s all because of me\u2026 I wasn\u2019t doing anything, just shivering\u2026 The same situation came again, but I couldn\u2019t move\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd after that?\u201d\u201cIt was the same after that\u2026 Never changing\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you still hear the voices?\u201dI could see him nodding.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI can hear all of you.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe voices of Hayan and you. I can also hear the voice of Hyunsung Hyung, and the voice of Hee-young Eunni, as well as Kim Ye-ri. Are you experiencing the same?\u201d\u201cOf course, even now. But it doesn\u2019t hurt me much.\u201d\u201cAs expected of my Hyung\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can do the same. What you\u2019re seeing are simple hallucinations.\u201dI did not mean to say this for Park Deokgu only, but also for Sun Hee-young and Jung Hayan.\u201cThere is no reason to be shaken, and there is also no need to worry. It\u2019s all just bullshit anyway. Don\u2019t let it bother you. Focus on what you see now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I can do it, you can do better, Park Deokgu.\u201d\u201cA-Ah\u2026\u201d\u201cRemember that. If I can do it, you can do better.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t mean that. However, I knew it would help him to an extent.After that, we delved into discussions covering various topics. We had a short talk with Sun Hee-young, and we had a meal with Lee Sang-hee, Hwang Jeong-yeon, and Kim Hyunsung to discuss our next strategy.Of course, it was only natural that I invested the most time in comforting Jung Hayan. I needed to keep her mind off things by keeping up the conversation. I thought about talking to her the way I had talked to Park Deokgu, but I knew that tactic wouldn\u2019t be as efficient.In fact, I didn\u2019t even want to recall what I had seen again. Just talking about it meant I had to do my best to seem unaffected once more.Anyway, her situation was different from Park Deokgu\u2019s.Although everyone was sensitive to the situation, I knew they could survive through it. All we had experienced were hallucinations, after all.\u2018Anyway, everyone has taken a short break\u2026\u2019It can be said that this was the best choice. It would be difficult to get some proper sleep, but because I was tired of the long journey, it didn\u2019t become a problem for me.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019At some point, however, I could sense Jung Hayan staring my way, heightening my senses.\u201cWe\u2019ll be together forever. Yes\u2026 no. Oppa won\u2019t do that. You are stupid. My Oppa told me to ignore your words. You are not real.\u201dI didn\u2019t know who she was talking to, but she eventually leaned in to whisper in my ear.\u201cI won\u2019t listen to you, stupid idiot. My Oppa shouldn\u2019t die. I\u2019m going to live with him forever.\u201d\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019\u201cWe\u2019ll be together forever. We can stay here for all time, Oppa. Hehehe\u2026\u201dHer creepy voice sent shivers down my spine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We can stay here for all time, Oppa. Hehehe\u2026\u201dHer creepy voice sent shivers down my spine.I knew Jung Hayan wasn\u2019t expecting me to flinch from the way she had been acting, so I chose not to move. In the first place, her mentality was obviously not healthy.Sun Hee-young had a similar mindset, but she already had her own set of values in place. She was essentially different from Jung Hayan, who relied entirely on me. Their biggest difference lay in the fact that one knew how to control herself, and the other one didn\u2019t.I didn\u2019t know who Jung Hayan was hearing, but\u2026\u201cI\u2019m not going to listen to you. So don\u2019t talk to me. I won\u2019t listen, anyway.\u201dPerhaps it was some twisted version of me.In context, it was correct to think so. After all, I\u2019m her biggest weakness.\u201cMy Oppa can\u2019t die\u2026 I\u2019m only going to cut your legs. You\u2019re going to run away? There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to do that because you said you loved me. There\u2019s no way. If you do that, you\u2019re going to be hurting, and I don\u2019t like that.\u201dMomentarily, I felt her hand stroking my leg. I wanted to scream, to resist, but I could not.I should have been sleeping soundly by now.\u201cYou still don\u2019t know? Huh. You don\u2019t have to do that. If I cut off his arms, he won\u2019t have a hand that will stroke my head, idiot. He wouldn\u2019t even be able to hug me tight\u2026 You are an idiot.\u201d\u2018Shit.\u2019Her condition seemed to be getting worse.Right now, I could hear another voice in addition to Jung Hayan\u2019s.Hearing Jung Jinho and Park Hyaeyoung constantly invading my head irritated me. Since the curse overlapped with one\u2019s mentality, I knew all of us must be feeling worn.The curse eroded the mind faster than anything else. I knew it should not affect us, but in truth, it was honestly affecting Jung Hayan on a largely negative scale.Nevertheless\u2026\u2018She\u2019s not completely crazy yet\u2026\u2019I was sure of this because she knew not to act in that manner when other people were present. As long as she was acting sanely, it would all be okay.With these thoughts, I tried my best to stay quiet.\u201cOppa seems to be awake\u2026?\u201dI froze when I heard it.\u201cNo\u2026 He has never awakened once. Oppa doesn\u2019t get up easily once he falls asleep. I cast magic on him, too\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. This isn\u2019t the Guild House. I forgot\u2026\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Though my eyes were closed, I could still feel Jung Hayan moving closer. This was because I could feel her rough breathing right against my skin.I knew she was checking to see if I was actually asleep.After some time, she kissed me lightly on the lips and drew back.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Feeling her move away, it seemed that she\u2019d decided it would be better to stay away from me.Still though, I didn\u2019t dare to move.Jung Hayan moved to another position. After some time, I thought about finally opening my eyes, however\u2026\u201cAh, so I was right. You\u2019re still sleeping, aren\u2019t you, Oppa?\u201dThen she moved away again.I tried to sleep as much as possible, which wasn\u2019t a problem with my drowsiness. To put it plainly, dungeons were no longer a problem for me.\u2018But I have more pressing matters to attend to.\u2019It was more important to solve this situation.In the first place, Jung Hayan\u2019s abnormal behavior wasn\u2019t easily recognizable. It was also incomprehensible that she had cast magic in my room and on myself.But she hadn\u2019t done that to hurt me. She had done it to protect me from any possible enemy.This was her own way of showing that she cared for me a lot.Simply put, Jung Hayan had never once shown that she intended to hurt me.The current situation felt different, however.\u2018Now, she\u2019s\u2026\u2019Now it felt like a possible endeavor for her to take, especially after experiencing the hallucination. In fact, she must probably already be planning it.\u2018To stay together forever in this dungeon for the rest of our lives\u2026\u2019I shuddered.In the first place, the idea of thinking that drinking water and food can be obtained here was ridiculous. Drinking water could somehow be obtained by magic, but this was not a place where humans could live.Of course, I wasn\u2019t sure if Jung Hayan was really entertaining the possibility, but it only felt right to act on it before she even attempted to.Assuming that Jung Hayan had really made up her mind, she had two options.One was to kill and hide those who had entered this place. The other one was to disappear after taking only me.Although it seemed to me that the second option was more viable, there was no guarantee that she would not choose the first if things got worse than it was now.\u2018Although\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t think Jung Hayan would be able to kill everyone in this expedition.\u2018Knowing her specs, it\u2019s still a possibility.\u2019Jung Hayan was smarter and more resourceful than I would like to admit.The place where we were now was a dungeon that had swallowed up the five previous Blue parties, and everyone had been afflicted with hallucinations. It didn\u2019t matter if Kim Hyunsung was a returner. Jung Hayan was still a very unpredictable variable.Suppose Jung Hayan\u2019s plan was put into action and completed successfully. In that case, the dungeon we were in now might be renamed to a legendary dungeon, not a heroic-grade dungeon depicting a cursed shrine, but a legendary dungeon with a mad wizard and a cursed shrine.\u2018The mad wizard and the cursed shrine\u2026\u2019It was an ominous-sounding thought.From Jung Hayan\u2019s perspective, anyone who dared to enter would be seen as an intruder in our own nest of love. It would be the best bad ending out of all possible scenarios.Of course, I didn\u2019t want to waste my whole life away in an area like this.This may be a safe and comfortable place, but my freedom would always be suppressed.\u2018What should I do\u2026\u2019There were many options, but the first was to fix her mentality as soon as possible. In addition to completing the expedition\u2019s task, I had one more thing to do.As I busied myself in my next course of action, day approached our group. The first voice I heard was Jung Hayan\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s time to get up, Oppa.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Huh.\u201dAs I nodded and looked up at her, her status window reflected in front of me.[Check the player\u2019s status window and potential ability.][Name \u2013 Hayan Jung][Title \u2013 None. You should try a little more.][Age \u2013 21][Alignment \u2013 ???][Job \u2013 Archmage \u2013 Heroic Grade][Capacity][Strength \u2013 17/Growth limit: Rare or less][Agility \u2013 15/Growth limit: Rare or less][Health \u2013 29/Growth limit: Heroic or less][Intellect \u2013 61/Growth limit: Heroic or higher][Durability \u2013 22/Growth limit: Rare or less][Luck \u2013 52/Growth limit: Heroic or higher][Mana \u2013 70/Growth limit: Legendary or higher][Equipment \u2013 Holy Protection][Talent \u2013 How to Become a Wizard \u2013 Heroic Grade][General comment \u2013 Her growth rate is outstanding. Player Jung Hayan has a near-perfect understanding of magic. It seems that it is still difficult to advance her mind to the next level, but she is expected to gain momentum soon. I am very sorry to mention player Lee Kiyoung. It is noticeable that her tendency is changing. If you don\u2019t want to transform the Cursed Shrine into a new type of dungeon, you should take some action. I\u2019ve hardly been affectionate, but I hope you survive.]\u2018Ah, so it\u2019s true\u2026\u2019Fortunately, her change in disposition was not yet complete. I didn\u2019t know what the question mark meant, but the general review literally stated that Jung Hayan was at a crossroads.I didn\u2019t know what her tendency to change would be like, but it could very well be a positive change.When I looked at Jung Hayan again, I could see her acting like how she always was with me. Because of this, I felt embarrassed at my inability to act as casually as I would\u2019ve liked.\u201cHehehe.\u201dHowever, it was natural for me to cover up for my blunder. As I smiled and stroked her face, she looked very happy.\u201cCan you still hear the voice? Hayan?\u201d\u201cYeah. I still hear it at times, but it\u2019s okay now. They\u2019re all just hallucinations.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly has it been saying?\u201d\u201cI do not know. I can\u2019t hear them well anymore. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dOf course, she was lying.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m glad. Anyway, we need to go soon. What about the others?\u201d\u201cI heard that we would leave in half an hour. Everyone seems to be organizing their luggage\u2026\u201dWe held hands at this point. I also smiled and kissed Jung Hayan on the lips. She then wrapped her arms around my neck, but we both knew we couldn\u2019t do anything further. It was time to move.However, with the way we were acting, it was almost like we were old lovers.For a long while, a blush stayed on Jung Hayan\u2019s face.\u2018Good.\u2019This was not a bad reaction. It felt like it would be better for me to move a little more actively, and it seemed to be working so far.Of course, it was natural for me to keep her close and continue to shower her with praises. I thought that what Jung Hayan needed now was greater affection. At least, when she was with me, her condition didn\u2019t seem to be worsening.\u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve prepared everything.\u201d\u201cAh. Thanks. Then, shall we go out?\u201d\u201cAh. Oppa, wait\u2026 I actually have something to say.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe other day\u2026 Um, about last time.\u201d\u201cHuh. What about it?\u201d\u201cWe do\u2026 First\u2026 You know when you first kissed me, right?\u201dOf course, I remembered.Before going to Cha Hee-ra, I kissed Jung Hayan to reassure her that I wouldn\u2019t leave her.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said you loved me, right? You said I was the only one.\u201d\u201cOf course you are.\u201d\u201cEven now\u2026 Do you feel the same? You love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u2018This\u2026\u2019It was hard to tell what the right answer was.However, after assessing her glances, I realized I had another option. If I thought about it, I could simply just nod.However, it was very difficult to tell if this was really the correct answer.One wrong move could change her disposition.As I was thinking about this, Jung Hayan spoke once more, a little more forcefully this time.\u201cYou love me, right?\u201dAt the urgency in her tone, I felt compelled to answer.\u201cOf course, I love you now, and I will continue to love you in the future.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 thank God!\u201d\u201cBy the way\u2026 Why are you asking this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing\u2026\u201dHer expression showed pure joy, but it was still hard to tell if I had given her the correct answer or not. There hadn\u2019t been a change in disposition yet.\u201cI love you too, Oppa.\u201d\u201cMe, too\u2026\u201dIt was then that a change occurred with Jung Hayan\u2019s status window.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was because I didn\u2019t know how she would react if I went the other way and said I didn\u2019t love her anymore.If neither seemed like the correct answer, then it was best to behave predictably.However, in this case, I could already predict the outcome. I had to act as naturally as possible, so I continued to smile and laugh as if nothing was wrong.\u2018I need to come up with a countermeasure\u2026\u2019As I had mentioned earlier, I not only had to help save the survivors but also find a way to control Jung Hayan. Although many options came to mind, I soon found out which would be the most effective method to take.I\u2019ve never thought about excluding Jung Hayan in any situation, but I knew it would work as a last resort.\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute, Hayan. I need to consult with Hyunsung and Sang-hee.\u201d\u201cAlright, Oppa!\u201dIt was time for the executives to talk.Hwang Jeong-yeon, Kim Hyunsung, and Lee Sang-hee, who were already huddling together and talking, came into sight.\u201cA small statue?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI could see that they were installed in certain areas, and for a while, I could feel the voices in my head disappear. I think it temporarily represses the curse\u2026\u201d\u201cSo basing off of that, will it be safe to assume that there is a safety zone in each area?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if there will still be statues that will have the same effect in other areas, but\u2026 It will at least help us to an extent. Divine magic is hard to get by, especially against the curse, so we should make the most of this discovery.\u201d\u201cThank God for that. Honestly though, I feel like the curse\u2019s cycles are getting shorter\u2026\u201d\u201cThe statue\u2019s a little far from here.\u201dAs I approached, the others greeted me with a nod. Based on what I could hear, it seemed like Kim Hyunsung had discovered a possible safe zone against the curse.\u2018Huh, not bad.\u2019I knew we were bound to find it sooner or later, but being able to discover this as early as now was definitely impressive.\u201cHow is the 7th unit doing?\u201d Kim Hyunsung asked and looked at me.Now that he\u2019d come back from scouting, it was understandable that he\u2019d ask about them.\u201cThey occasionally show signs of anxiety, but it\u2019s not too bad. Sun Hee-young, in particular, doesn\u2019t seem too affected. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t hear any voices at all.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really sure, but I think intelligence stats play a big part in resisting the curse.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cHow about the 2nd unit?\u201d\u201cThose with lower intelligence specs in our party do seem to be more affected quickly. However, the situation isn\u2019t that serious yet. What I\u2019m worried about is how they will be if this curse lasts for another three days or a week\u2026\u201d\u201cThankfully though, there are places where we can rest free from the curse. I\u2019m hoping the priests can prioritize the lower intelligence party members. I\u2019m not sure if your hunch is correct, but it\u2019s worth a try. If any other information is gathered, please let us know immediately. It doesn\u2019t matter if it sounds trivial.\u201d\u201cAlright, will do.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019ll continue after the cleanup. As we have discussed, we will proceed with the search with Mr. Hyunsung in the lead.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAll of us nodded at this. Lee Sang-hee\u2019s business seemed to be over, but mine wasn\u2019t.\u201cHyunsung, I will talk with Jeong-yeon for a moment before I get back.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes, okay.\u201dKim Hyunsung looked puzzled, and even Hwang Jeong-yeon looked surprised. However, she also looked curious as to what I wanted to talk to her about.After a moment, Hyunsung excused himself from the conversation, leaving Jeong-yeon and me to talk.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing fine. How\u2019re you, Jeong-yeon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, too. It seems that having a high intelligence stat certainly has a positive effect. Looking at Kiyoung makes me think he wasn\u2019t cursed at all.\u201d\u201cOh, no, I only look fine on the outside.\u201d\u201cNo way. You were able to awaken right away when you get afflicted with the curse. That kind of hurts my pride, hahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you found out anything else?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough yet, though. I\u2019ll try and collect more data.\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201d\u201cFor example, the frequency of the voices. I hear a voice every 10 minutes and 46 seconds. It is getting shorter by 38 seconds every hour. The triggers occur slowly if you are resting without doing anything. Of course, there are individual differences, so it\u2019s not accurate, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve found out on my end.\u201d\u201cAh. It certainly helps to have a good memory.\u201d\u201cYeah. Of course, it\u2019s not nice to hear the motherfuckers\u2019 voices more and more vividly. What\u2019s up, by the way? Are you trying to keep your promise last time?\u201d\u201cNo, the time isn\u2019t right for now. Park Deokgu\u2019s struggling a lot from the curse as well.\u201d\u201cOh, I did see Jung Hayan depending on you\u2026 How romantic!\u201d\u201cThe situation\u2019s not really romantic\u2026 I think Hayan\u2019s being influenced by the curse.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t seem like she is on the outside.\u201d\u201cIs it because you two have been together for so long that you can notice the subtle differences?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go with that line of reasoning, yes.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you tell Lee Sang-hee or Hyunsung?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I have to solve by myself.\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to inform them, though. Our dungeon strategy can go wrong if even the smallest variable changes. If Jung Hayan is not in good condition, it\u2019ll be a better option to leave the dungeon first.\u201d\u201cNo, there is no guarantee that this curse will be stopped even if we exit the dungeon\u2026\u201dMore dangerous things may happen if I chose that option. It would be better to stick to everyone.\u201cAt least you know, Jeong-yeon. If something goes awry, at least I have an insurance policy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m flattered for the trust, but it\u2019s hard to say I\u2019m confident enough to know what to do. I\u2019m not going to tell them, but I also have a stressful situation to take care of. What can I do for you?\u201dThere was no reason for me to prolong it any longer. I spoke.\u201cCan you use illusion magic, hallucination magic, or psychological magic?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPsychological magic is impossible.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019\u201cI can, however, do hallucinations or illusion magic. The psychological aspect isn\u2019t actually impossible, but it\u2019s too complex for me to comprehend. I\u2019m sure you know this.\u201d\u201cYes, I know that it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. Fantasies and hallucinations have little effect on high-intelligence people, and even low-intelligence people can resist if they have high magical power. Psychological magic is the same. No matter how much the person tries to accept the magic, humans instinctively tend to push away what suddenly invades their minds.\u201dI already knew this. However, when I heard that it was impossible right from the beginning, I deflated a little. However, I held onto the hope that Jeong-yeon was the type who loved making the impossible happen.\u201cIt won\u2019t be possible to do at this point.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a different subject if the subject was cursed?\u201d\u201cIt will still be a difficult endeavor.\u201d\u201cThen what if there were medications to help? Or a catalyst?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the way you use your magic?\u201d\u201cYes. In addition to that, there was a potion I\u2019ve been working on, a potion that can tap into people\u2019s emotions. Of course, it doesn\u2019t really touch your emotions, but you can at least experience a similar effect.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWould it be possible?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly\u2026 It\u2019ll be a combination of potion and illusion magic treatment. It seems like it\u2019ll be more effective, though. Humans instinctively remove barriers with potions. However, with the curse, it seems like one\u2019s mental state will have been weakened.\u201dI stayed quiet as Hwang Jeong-yeon continued to mutter to herself. It seemed like she was mulling the theory over in her head. It felt a little interesting to watch her.\u201cIf this actually becomes a success, it would make it easier for us to attack the dungeon. Of course, it\u2019ll require several experiments, but\u2026 No matter how fast\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it would be better to skip all the chores and start the experiment right away. I have a test subject that I can use.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dShe tilted her head at my sudden revelation.\u201cI think it would be better to try it on myself. I\u2019m the one who knows the most about this potion.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cWould it be possible?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t give you a definite answer. It sounds like fun, though. Let\u2019s have clinical trials every time we take a break. If you ever have any problems\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201dI couldn\u2019t guarantee success, but it was necessary to gamble at this stage if I wanted to maintain a safe relationship with Jung Hayan.Of course, I knew that there would be a negative effect if Jung Hayan saw me cozying up to Hwang Jeong-yeon.\u2018It\u2019s all part of the plan.\u2019Considering the big picture, this didn\u2019t seem like a bad option.\u201cI\u2019ll go and talk to Hyunsung for a moment,\u201d I informed her.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cFor the time being, we\u2019ll be moving with the second unit.\u201d\u201cYeah. It would be nice to do so. No, it would be better to send one of our party members. I have a lot to do from now on. It would be nice to tell other people that we are researching the dungeon. I don\u2019t know when the monsters will come out, but for now, I\u2019ll be able to experiment freely.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cDid you bring catalysts?\u201d\u201cOf course. I also brought some Alchemy kits, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cThree days. I\u2019ll be able to figure this out in three days.\u201d\u201cIf you can achieve it in a shorter timeframe, then please do so.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I can, but my supplies are at least sufficient. If you can\u2019t produce the result, you\u2019ll develop a sense of inferiority.\u201d\u201cThis time, Jeong-yeon is the doctor.\u201d\u201cYes, my assistant.

    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHow\u2019s the reaction?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to answer that\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay with this? You\u2019re not feeling any abnormalities, right?\u201d\u201cYes, it seems okay so far. In fact, the data I\u2019ve gathered in previous trials had no problems with the body, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\u201cWhen did you do such an experiment again\u2026?\u201dI had used it when I successfully tried to lure Sun Hee-young into joining our party. At that time, I had obtained satisfactory results, but I had to stop the research overall because there had been so many limitations.I never thought it would be helpful in a place like this. It seemed like every little thing had a chance of being useful every once in a while.\u201cHow about making the concentration a little thicker?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good to put too much. This is just the right amount, especially if you plan to use magic again later on. Otherwise, it could trigger an effect on the body.\u201d\u201cNo, if you think about using it to try and resist the curse, it will outperform the curse.\u201d\u201cOkay, Admiral Lee.\u201d\u201cI think it would be okay to approach with similar effects.\u201d\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re moving in circles.\u201d\u201cTo be precise, we\u2019re not going back to square one. I think most of them are ready for this\u2026\u201d\u201cThe problem is that you\u2019re not entirely confident about the results yet, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to rewrite the formula. It looks like today will be tough.\u201dEven the simple exchange of opinions worked. I couldn\u2019t believe that it had only been a day since I felt hopeless about my situation. Who knew we could make so much progress?The main reason was that Hwang Jeong-yeon and I proved to be a good match.In the beginning, I only planned on collaborating with her for the sake of getting my third job, but our relationship turned out to be more beneficial than I thought.Of course, it didn\u2019t mean we were bound for intimacy. It was just that we were more efficient in our work together. Hwang Jeong-yeon had been able to help me in the aspects where I was weakest. She had helped me in so many ways. I had also been able to help her, of course, with my innovative mindset.\u201cHow is Jung Hayan, by the way? You seem very anxious\u2026\u201d\u201cWe only really talk in the evenings. I feel like it\u2019s best to remain a little distant.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cShe hasn\u2019t shown any abnormal behavior yet.\u201d\u201cI guess so. I can understand why you\u2019re in a hurry to solve this right away. I just feel like she\u2019s not happy with how we\u2019re spending so much time together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. As I said\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, and I understand. What I don\u2019t get is how I, a girl who has never been with a man, suddenly became the focus of a girl\u2019s resentment. It\u2019s almost as if I got caught having an affair with you. I kind of feel guilty\u2026\u201dHwang Jeong-yeon lowered her head a little.\u201cMy goodness\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to be portrayed as the other woman? Even Park Deokgu might begin to have negative thoughts about me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. After all of this is over, I\u2019ll definitely help you with him.\u201dAfter saying that, Jeong-yeon\u2019s eyes seemed to sparkle, and she exclaimed.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare forget that!\u201dAs time passed, Jung Hayan\u2019s symptoms began to worsen. I knew that my quality time with Hwang Jeong-yeon was the main cause of this progression. Simply put, she harbored jealous feelings.I knew the curse was accelerating at a faster pace this time around because I wasn\u2019t always there to be with her.No, in fact, it would be impossible to predict how fast the curse will erode her mental health. I couldn\u2019t even tell what Jung Hayan was thinking.In the end, this was a race to see which would finish first\u2014Jung Hayan\u2019s mental state or my experiment with Hwang Jeong-yeon.Had I been able to concentrate on the research completely, we wouldn\u2019t have had this problem in the first place, but I still had to find some time to spend with Jung Hayan to ensure she wasn\u2019t regressing too much.It was also very important as we needed time for the potion\u2019s effects to stabilize. We couldn\u2019t rush anything at this point.\u2018If we rush its creation, there will definitely be bad side effects.\u2019We had to minimize any side effects as much as possible.It wasn\u2019t just Jung Hayan who hindered my research, though. We also had to focus on progressing through the dungeon to search for the other survivors.Of course, we could maximize exploration results while minimizing the effort needed, but it still proved to be a disadvantage for us.Despite Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s efforts, we hadn\u2019t really progressed much with our expedition. It may be because we had not yet found any monsters, but at least we were able to find small achievements with Kim Hyunsung\u2019s help.As I had been so focused on my research, I wasn\u2019t up to date with our exploration status, but we were apparently making slow progress. That wasn\u2019t even the worst of it.Aside from Jung Hayan, most of our party members were thoroughly getting affected by the curse, to the point where some of them would start talking to themselves at random intervals.Although Kim Hyunsung tried his best to repress the curse, the side effects we were expecting to appear began to show themselves.Among everyone afflicted with the curse, only Lee Sang-hee began to show some of the said effects.\u201cSorry.\u201dHer illusion, after all, was about the party members we needed to save. Her anxiety increased as well as her sense of urgency, but it was expected.\u2018That\u2019s because we haven\u2019t found a single hint, let alone any survivors.\u2019Based on the expression on everyone\u2019s faces, I knew everyone had begun to expect the worse\u2014that none of them were alive. Still, the expedition continued to advance, and the curse continued its relentless attack on everyone\u2019s mental state.\u201cIt can\u2019t be considered perfect yet. I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Kiyoung.\u201d\u201cAt least it\u2019s helping. The voices are still there, but the headaches have stopped. In fact, just this much\u2026\u201d\u201cI should be able to call it an achievement, but\u2026 We could still be able to improve its effects over time. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cExerting effort on it is more important than having regrets about it.\u201d\u201cI know, I know. Can you please ask Hayan to stop staring at me?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stop her from doing so, and you know that.\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m a drama-lover, but\u2026 it\u2019s not nice experiencing this in reality.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI only like being part of the audience.\u201d\u201cBy the way, how are you coping with the curse?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 it\u2019s still difficult, mental-wise. However, being so focused on this research helped me a lot. I can still see hallucinations every now and then, but\u2026 Aren\u2019t you experiencing the same?\u201d\u201cYes, but\u2026 They\u2019re not all that serious.\u201d\u201cThen it looks like the experiment is working.\u201dA little more time had passed since then, but there were no changes in this short duration. The rescue team continued to move forward, but we had not encountered anyone. There\u2019s not a single monster, and definitely not a single survivor. It felt like being stuck in a maze.Kim Hyunsung looked unaffected, but Lee Sang-hee wasn\u2019t doing too well.\u201cSang-hee, this is a safety zone.\u201d\u201cOh, Let\u2019s skip this one.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cA lot of time has already passed. I worry about the survivors. Let\u2019s rest at the next point.\u201d\u2018There she goes again.\u2019\u201cBut, this is already the second time we\u2019ve skipped\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019ll be one in the next room. Yes, definitely\u2026\u201d\u201cI think the Master needs to rest.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. I know everyone is having a hard time, but please be patient. After finding a survivor\u2026 Yes. If a survivor is found\u2026\u201dAt this point, we might not find a single one. It would be safe to assume that they were all dead.Logically speaking, even if the previous party members have survived, it was highly unlikely that the undead didn\u2019t kill them off by now. Perhaps they even resorted to killing each other.\u201cPlease be patient\u2026 We\u2019ll speed up a little bit\u2026 Yes, a little faster\u2026\u201d Sang-hee insisted.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt was obvious \u2013 our expedition leader was suffering from her own hallucinations.As we trudged on, I could see several members showing annoyed expressions. Some even grumbled out complaints. Everyone was struggling with their own illusions, after all.Seeing Park Deokgu struggle was normal now, but even Sun Hee-young felt exhausted at this point. Everyone was on the brink of exploding.\u2018How many months are we going to spend in this state?\u2019This may seem like the worst situation for the party members, but this was the perfect time for Jung Hayan to execute her plan, should she ever decide to push through with it.\u201cCome on, everyone.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re reaching our limit\u2026\u201d\u201cThe guild members are dying on the inside.\u201d\u201cThe back-ups are struggling a lot, Lee Sang-hee.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Sang-hee?\u201dIt was at this point that I realized something was wrong.The curse\u2026\u2018Damn.\u2019Everyone was looking upwards. It was the same voice we had first heard when we entered the dungeon. Our mentality was slowly reaching the brink of despair. At this point, we would have to worry less about rescuing our fellow guild members and more about saving ourselves.\u201cPlease recite the divine defense magic.\u201d\u201cAh, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be better than nothing. We will respond as much as possible. Magicians should also try to block the effects as much as possible.\u201dWizards and priests within the party did as she commanded, but this wasn\u2019t something we could combat with magic.Slowly, I looked at Jung Hayan, who was smiling as she looked upwards. She wasn\u2019t talking, but she seemed like she wanted to say something.\u2018What\u2026\u2019When I felt the strange aura emanating from her, I immediately shouted for Hwang Jeong-yeon.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cSon of a bitch!\u2026 Jeong-yeon, chant the spell immediately!\u201dI had no choice but to execute the plan now. Though the timing was a little early, there was nothing else I could do.\u2018Was it because of her jealousy of Hwang Jeong-yeon?\u2019I was almost sure of it.\u201cBut the defensive spells\u2026\u201dHwang Jeong-yeon seemed anxious, but this is no time to hesitate.\u201cQuickly!\u201d I exclaimed in an urgent tone.\u201cOkay, I see! Is Jung okay? This is still\u2026\u201d\u201cRecite it quickly!\u201d\u201cThe content, too?!\u201dI was frustrated at her endless questions. She still didn\u2019t seem to grasp the urgency of the situation, so I had to shriek some sense into her.\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, just do it!\u201dScreams began erupting from the front. Evidently, the curse affected several party members.After emptying the potion that I had prepared in my mouth, I immediately started to run toward Jung Hayan.\u201cI knew my Oppa felt the same!\u201dI welcomed her outstretched arms and bent down to kiss her, transferring the potion from my mouth to hers.\u201cI love you, Oppa!\u201d\u2018Shit, shit\u2026\u2019I could feel magic spreading across my body, and the worst-case scenarios came into mind\u2014Jung Hayan manipulating me or trying to kill me.I didn\u2019t know what type of magic she was trying to use, but it was at least not a defensive one. Inwardly, I prayed that Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s spell would work faster than Jung Hayan\u2019s.Meanwhile, Hayan\u2019s eyes began to widen.\u2018Did I get caught?\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure yet. However, I knew she would be able to sense Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s magic at work. I would not let her achieve the ending she wanted for us.\u201cAhhh!!!\u201dI convinced myself that what she was seeing was the scenario I had prepared as she looked into the air and began to shed tears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s the ending we wanted, right?Does he want the same thing as well?Of course. Didn\u2019t he say that he loved you, too?Right, he did say that.It\u2019s too dangerous outside.That\u2019s right. There are too many people trying to take my Oppa away. Everything you\u2019ve told me sounded stupid, but\u2026Look at that woman. She seems to be trying to flirt with your Oppa. I can understand your troubles. What about the other people trying to kill him? Recall what happened during the tutorial dungeon. Your Oppa is weak.That\u2019s right. My Oppa is weak.We need to protect him.Of course.He needs our protection. It\u2019s too dangerous outside.The spell I had been memorizing burst out of my mouth.It can\u2019t be helped.Kill everyone. Target the woman who has been trying to take your Oppa away first.But she\u2019s a high-ranking magician\u2026It\u2019ll be easy to target her while she\u2019s under the effect of the curse.But the same will go for me\u2026You\u2019ll be okay. I will protect you. You won\u2019t be affected by the curse.You mean you\u2019ll help me?I am you, and you are me. Aim for the head. Even a small spell will do. It\u2019s important not to waste your magic power.Ah! I\u2019ve succeeded.Good. Who\u2019s next? What about that stupid-looking woman over there? Since her endurance is good, I think it\u2019d be better to approach her a little differently.I think a spell of corruption will do. No, it will take too long. Black magic isn\u2019t my specialty\u2026 Should I try something else? It would be better to burst her head from the inside.Good idea. I didn\u2019t think of that. That\u2019s right; go ahead.Like this\u2026We did it!Hehe. Yes, we did.Don\u2019t mind the rest. All of them will die anyway. Then\u2026 what about Sun Hee-young?She went out with my Oppa every day, didn\u2019t she?Huh. Yes, she did.But\u2026You can\u2019t be weak. Why not get rid of that little kid over there as well?I don\u2019t like the sound of that\u2026Don\u2019t be weak. Kill her as painlessly as possible.Yes\u2026Now, for Deok Gu and Hyunsung\u2026It\u2019s too much to kill them. Why not put them to sleep instead?Are you not anxious? Kim Hyunsung is strong. What if he comes back to the dungeon later on and takes your Oppa away?I won\u2019t allow that.Then kill him.I can\u2019t do that. Are you a fool?You are the fool. You\u2019ve been doing well so far. Are you going to give up now? Your plans will be foiled if you stop after only killing two.I can\u2019t do that. Deokgu, in particular, has helped me a lot.You will regret not doing it.I think it would be better to put them to sleep and send them out. I can\u2019t help it if they choose to come back, but I don\u2019t want to kill them either.You\u2026Rather, it\u2019s better to take my Oppa. I have to take him somewhere so far that no one else can find him. Look at him sleeping; doesn\u2019t he look cute?Yes. But what if your Oppa tries to run away?He won\u2019t. He has told me that he loves me.It\u2019s still better to have an insurance policy.Yes. That would be okay. Hehe. My Oppa looks so cute whenever he\u2019s asleep.Huh. Yes, he\u2019s really cute. Anyway, we need to act faster.I need to redecorate our new home. Oppa likes to study, so it would be better to do a workshop for him. I also have to make a bathroom. I\u2019ll make it big so we can take a shower together. I also need to make a big bed, a bathroom, and I have to do my very best.We need a system that will kill anyone who will invade our home. Some time again, people aiming for your Oppa may come here, so let\u2019s make a golem and a chimera. The undead also has to increase their numbers. The dungeon\u2019s empty, after all. It might be hard, but I can do it for you. This place will be our home.It will be my castle with my Oppa that will never collapse.* * *Oppa is\u2026? Where is he?It happened again. I don\u2019t think he ate today\u2026I\u2019m so worried, is he okay? He seems to be in such bad shape. Perhaps he\u2019s sick. It\u2019s been several months already\u2026 Perhaps my Oppa wants to leave this place?That\u2019s a possibility.He told me a few days ago. He wants to see the outside.Don\u2019t be fooled. You should never be fooled.I hate the fact that he doesn\u2019t have as much energy as he used to. He doesn\u2019t laugh anymore.Someday you will understand. You\u2019ll understand that all this is for you. It\u2019s too dangerous outside. Just today, strange people came into our home, right? If you go outside, you will be overwhelmed. Do you want to take that chance?Definitely not\u2026 But my Oppa is showing such a sad expression\u2026Then you can cast magic that will make him feel better. You will feel better too. If you feel better, you will be kind to us, and you will have a happier time.Is it okay, though?It\u2019s all for your Oppa.That\u2019s right. I should go and try it now.Good.Ah! He smiled. You were right.Right? Shall we use other magic? How about some kind of enchantment this time?But that\u2019s not what he would want.You\u2019ve been working hard so far; it will be a perfect reward for yourself, right?A prize for me?Yes. It will be a prize for us. I think it would be better to stay in this state for just one day. Think about it. How hard did you try to protect your Oppa? I catch and kill all the guys who come here every day, and that\u2019s not enough. The dungeon was difficult to remodel completely, and the chimeras have to be created every day, right?Still\u2026Just do it for one day.Can I do that?Of course, don\u2019t worry, do it right away.Yes, it\u2019ll only be for today\u2026Well done.Ahh!Good.Happy, I\u2019m so happy!I was right, wasn\u2019t I? It worked well.Huh. Yes, you were right.* * *What do we do? Oh, my Oppa ran away.I thought he would.Why? Why? Am I hated now? I made him happy every day\u2026 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.It may be because he\u2019s been drinking poison from the outside world.But we\u2019re inside. There\u2019s no way he could\u2019ve.Intruders come in every day, right? The dirty air they breathe pollutes Oppa\u2019s mind.I have to kill them all.Exactly.I never thought he would run away like this. It\u2019s the intruders\u2019 fault! Why not leave us alone? I don\u2019t know why they keep coming in here to disturb us! I don\u2019t know! Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to go out and kill them all? Lindel, I have to kill everyone in Lindel.Good idea. But other than your Oppa, humans are like bugs, so even if you try to kill them, they will continue to come into this place.Well, then what should I do?The outside air may have worn out your Oppa\u2019s mind. It won\u2019t be easy to cure. He can\u2019t escape the dungeon alone, but\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t we just do something as a temporary measure?What?Let\u2019s cut his leg off!No, that\u2019s ridiculous.You can cut it in a way where it won\u2019t hurt.What?Huh. Cut it in a way where it won\u2019t hurt. If you put on magic that will make him feel good while you cut it off, your Oppa will surely not get sick. Of course, it will be a little hard to walk around, but it\u2019s okay because we\u2019ll always be around. He\u2019ll have to rely on us.No\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026What if your Oppa leaves this place and runs away with another girl? The Red Mercenaries also came, right? Cha Hee-ra, that stupid woman, might come again.Yes.Can you stand it? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s going to be too hard when that kind of situation comes? It\u2019s only right to cut it out.That does make sense\u2026Have you ever regretted listening to me?But\u2026Trust me this time. It\u2019ll work well.* * *My Oppa is going to die. I hate it so much! What if he dies?!It\u2019ll be okay.He tried to kill himself today! I don\u2019t understand! The intruders have finally stopped coming, and we get to enjoy all our time together!Maybe it\u2019s because his brain has already been eroded.I don\u2019t want my Oppa to die. He can\u2019t just leave me behind!Just make sure he doesn\u2019t. You can\u2019t turn him into the undead, so let\u2019s experiment. There must be a way to save him. You can enjoy eternal life together. Find a catalyst that allows the body to regenerate, and treat it on your Oppa\u2019s body. It may be a little painful, but it can\u2019t be helped, so your Oppa will understand. Of course, it won\u2019t be easy, but you\u2019ve been doing well until now.That\u2026 okay. I have to do that. I have to do that so that this doesn\u2019t happen again.That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\u201cOppa. Even if it hurts, please just bear with it. It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI love you? Sure. I love you, too, so much.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026Ah..\u201d\u201cYou must never die. Never!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cA lot of time has passed. Even a gray-haired Oppa is really cool. Ah, that\u2019s right\u2026 Oppa!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cI love you. I love you, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour hair has grown a lot. Research? Ah\u2026 Of course, you have to do it today. It may hurt a little, but you have to be patient. If you get sick, I will also get sick. So, let\u2019s do our best together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease be patient for a bit. You can still hold on. You can\u2019t let go. Ugh\u2026 I love you. I love you.\u201d\u201c\u2026rese-.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 No! No!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Oppa. I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cI love you. I love you, too. So please don\u2019t go. Please\u2026\u201d\u201cI resent you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI will blame and curse you for making me this way. Forever\u2026 No, I will curse you even in my death. You didn\u2019t give me love. You tortured me and eventually made me like this. Look at my body. This is your doing. Look at the things that surround us now. You screwed everything up.\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cYou gave up everything. You ruined all my love for you. We could have been happier.

Her expression was far more serious than what I was expecting.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u2018It was successful.\u2019It felt shocking to realize this. Of course, the scenario might be too painful for Hayan to endure.\u2018This is the right answer.\u2019I had done it correctly. In the first place, Hayan wouldn\u2019t have exhibited this kind of unusual behavior. The inflicted curse had messed everyone up. I simply chose to help her out with a little shock therapy.Hayan\u2019s face was currently covered in tears, and she had started tearing out her hair. The others were no different, but her case was the most serious. I went to grab her hand, but she shook me away.\u201cI hate you!\u201d\u2018What power\u2026\u2019Jung Hayan then tried to harm herself afterward, wringing her hands around her neck. I urgently pulled her arms away with as much strength as I could muster. Once I succeeded in this endeavor, I quickly kissed her deeply, effectively stimulating what was left of her sanity.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Oppa?\u201dHayan\u2019s expression shifted from confusion to shock, and then her eyes were filled with renewed tears.\u201cAh\u2026 Oppa\u2026 Oppa\u2026\u201dShe wasn\u2019t contented with just checking my face; she checked my entire body. Considering what she had seen in her latest illusion, it was only natural.\u201cI came back\u2026\u201d Hayan muttered.\u201cHayan?\u201d I called.\u201cI came back. Ugh, I came back\u2026\u201d Hayan continued muttering.\u201cWhat are you talking about, Hayan?\u201d I asked.\u201cNothing, it\u2019s nothing. I-I\u2019m sorry for being such an idiot\u2026\u201d she replied and lowered her head from embarrassment.\u2018Good.\u2019\u201cWhat do you mean? Is the curse affecting you? What did you see?\u201d I asked, trying to act na\u00efve.\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t the curse. It\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019m sorry, Oppa. I\u2019m really sorry for being selfish. Please don\u2019t hate me\u2026\u201d Hayan replied apologetically.\u2018There\u2019s no way I would hate you.\u2019In the first place, I had never felt hatred for Hayan. Sure, she was obsessed with me, but her abnormality only spiked because of the curse\u2019s effect.I was grateful for being able to squeeze some magic into her worn-out mind. The opportunity had quickly presented itself to me.One day, Jung Hayan might suffer from a terrible accident. Of course, the cause was unknown, but one thing was for sure\u2014it would be because of her ability.Knowing that I could suppress her from now on, I smiled in satisfaction.\u2018Now, I feel like I\u2019ve gained a new sense of responsibility\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t particularly love her or wanted to be bound to her, but the fact that I felt guilty and compassionate and even liked her was undeniable.You are rationalizing again. You\u2019re trying to remove your guilt through her. You think that, by not abandoning her, it would prove that you still have a conscience.\u2018Things like that happen, too.\u2019I also knew I had been affected by the curse, but that didn\u2019t matter now. All these voices only served to spout serious bullshit.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I have no reason to hate you. I love you the most.\u201dAgain, I was only half-sincere with my words.\u201cHuh\u2026 My Oppa is also the most important to me. I like him the most!\u201d she exclaimed.Once again, Jung Hayan hugged me tightly and rubbed her face against my chest.\u201cI\u2019m back\u2026 Thank you, God! Thank you so much, God! Thank you very much!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.Of course, I knew what happened. I just tested if she would reveal it to me, but she doesn\u2019t seem to want to.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026 Oh, Oppa, are you okay? Did you suffer any injuries? Your legs\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I responded with a bright smile to convince her.\u201cWow\u2026 Fortunately, your arms are also okay. There is no scar. You don\u2019t have gray hair. Your tongue is also intact\u2026\u201dOf course, I knew there would be some side-effects. Jung Hayan must have felt like the fantasy I had created would somehow come to life.\u2018She even thought she had regressed\u2026\u2019If I had known that she would react in this manner, I would have twisted the story a little more. I could have portrayed a scene where Cha Hee-ra and Lee Jihye saved my life.Of course, it would be difficult to make a script, but if such a scene had been included, the hostility that Jung Hayan exhibited towards them would be greatly reduced.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Hayan.\u2019It would be better to try it out at a later time.\u201cOppa\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you calm now?\u201d\u201cYes, a little\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, can you wait a minute? I should also take care of the rest.\u201d\u201cOf course, Oppa. Go ahead.\u201dAt this, I patted her head, and she automatically blushed. She looked like a cute little puppy. However, memories of her illusion resurfaced once more, and tears formed in her eyes again.\u2018I can\u2019t do this\u2026\u2019I knew it had been effective. Looking at Hayan now, it seems I successfully regained her sanity and freed her from most of the curse\u2019s effects.I was pleased to find out that our experiment had produced successful results. It was probably because Jung Hayan was a special case.\u2018However, it could also work on other people.\u2019The effect wouldn\u2019t just be enough; it would work very well. This was because Jung Hayan was the hardest to crack among them, and the experiment turned out well for her. The appropriate use of medicine and magic may not be perfect, but it would certainly help.As I turned to assess the situation, the rest of the room came into view.The scene was the same as the first time the curse had shown itself to us. Those who had been screaming at first slowly awakened and the rest were either looking around or talking to themselves.When my gaze met Hwang Jeong-yeon, I saw a question formed in her eyes.\u2018The experiment is a great success.\u2019As soon as I took out my alchemy kit and began to conjure a magic circle, Hwang Jeong-yeon approached me. Her gaze was, naturally, focused as she was involved in this operation.\u201cMr. Kiyoung, what do we do now?\u201d\u201cPlease lead them here, one by one,\u201d I instructed.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPlease lead the other people here, one at a time,\u201d I repeated.At that moment, Hwang Jeong-yeon figured out what I wanted to do.\u201cOh\u2026 I get it.\u201d\u201cPlease get Lee Sang-hee first.\u201d\u201cMaster, please sit over here.\u201dI wasted no time in speaking once our expedition leader had arrived.\u201cLet\u2019s see. Master, what are you currently experiencing?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. There may be things related to privacy, so it would be better to write it down. Jeong-yeon?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll have it ready.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 What\u2019s happening?\u201dLee Sang-hee was visibly confused, so I began explaining the procedures.\u201cI found a way to effectively curb the curse, Lee Sang-hee. First of all, you need to be at ease and write down exactly what symptoms and what kind of voices you hear. If hallucinations are starting to appear, it may be helpful to state exactly what it is. If you hear a lot of hallucinations, you should also describe phrases that you hear repeatedly.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI will ask everyone to line up properly over here. Please bring all your writing instruments and wait patiently.\u201dEveryone seemed to be a little puzzled, but they still obeyed.\u201cAh. I see.\u201d\u201cI see the faces of those killed so far. They keep telling me that I will die soon.\u201d\u201cOf course, I can understand. I\u2019m also experiencing similar symptoms. Once you are prescribed a potion, your mental health will begin to regain shortly. Although, there are some missing items\u2026 Um, well, I\u2019d be grateful if you could describe how they died.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can write down the parts that are too difficult to say. It\u2019ll be more effective, as well.\u201d\u201cI will vouch for you. It will work, everyone.\u201d\u201cThank you, Hwang Jeong-yeon.\u201d After all, Jeong-yeon did play a crucial part in this.\u201cOh, the next person\u2026 Ah, Miss Gahyeon. So you can see your younger brother, who you left back on Earth?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must have been very difficult.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI also have a younger sister on Earth. Of course, I\u2019m worried about her, but\u2026 First of all, it is important to be strong. You will see each other again someday. Now\u2026 You seem to be showing signs of severe depression, but even if perfect treatment is impossible, you will be able to relieve the burdens of your mind.\u201dAfter trying to comfort Gahyeon, Hwang Jeong-yeon approached me.\u201cWhat should I do, Kiyoung?\u201d\u201cI think potion 14 in the bag will be appropriate, Miss Jeong-yeon. I\u2019ll write a mental prescription right away. Gahyeon may go into treatment right away. Please prepare the magic.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI was a meek idealist. I knew the medication would work well. Her propensity and hallucinations were very much visible, so cases like hers were easier to treat.\u2018After a beautiful reunion with her younger brother, he ends up asking her to live with strength.\u2019I knew this line would have a positive effect. Since my hobby was to read, I could incorporate some fantasy elements.\u2018I think it would be effective if I put in the part where the voice of her brother and the voice of the curse are opposed to each other.\u2019Of course, what I\u2019m doing right now wasn\u2019t medical. Simply put, I was just scamming everyone into receiving counsel. The curse wasn\u2019t completely curable, nor would the hallucinations become inaudible. To be precise, it was all about putting a little antibiotic into the worn-out mind. However, it worked.The human mind was both weak and strong. Even though a curse like this can erode one\u2019s mentality, one could always find the strength to fight against it.I shared similar symptoms with many of these people, thus making it easy to treat them. In Hayan\u2019s case, my existence itself had power over her thinking.\u2018Good. Good.\u2019Everything seemed to be working well.Of course, I had not explained or informed Kim Hyunsung about this in advance. He was evidently surprised upon seeing me suddenly administer treatment.Even after receiving Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s mental treatment, Hyunsung still felt stunned, looking among the people who had been treated or were still waiting for their turn. I knew he had never imagined a scenario where we would find another way to fight the curse.He knew how to deal with this curse and was trying to put it into practice. We had done the same, just with a different method, and I knew he understood this.\u201cI came back\u2026 Thank you so much, God. Thank you for bringing me back. Really, ugh\u2026\u201dHowever, Kim Hyunsung\u2019s expression turned serious upon hearing Hayan mumble to herself.\u2018She hasn\u2019t really regressed, Hyunsung\u2026\u2019It seemed like I had some explaining to do once all the treatments were over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can still hear the voices, but my head doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. How could this be?\u201d she replied.\u2018It\u2019s all thanks to Jeong-yeon.\u2019Of course, I didn\u2019t mention this. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing to maximize my own value. I had to show them that I also managed to play a competent role during this expedition.\u201cWhat kind of magic did you use?\u201d\u201cHahaha. I didn\u2019t really use a complete type of magic. The brain is made up of associated neurons, responsible for receiving and processing stimuli. So, medically, the brain is classified as the central nervous system.\u201d\u201cYeah? That\u2026\u201dPark Gahyeon\u2019s expression showed that she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. Even I didn\u2019t know what bullshit I was spouting. I didn\u2019t know anything about the brain, and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t a psychology expert.However, the expressions of those around me had changed. Although they had already overestimated my abilities initially, their eyes had still widened when I continued to show off my so-called expertise.\u201cThe central nervous system has a metabolism that is differentiated from other organs. To make adenosine triphosphate, you need a supply of oxygen to\u2026\u201dHow many people in Korea had this kind of knowledge? I knew no one would understand me, which was why I was bold enough to spout whatever came to mind.\u2018There is no one here who has worked at the Brain Science Research Institute\u2026\u2019Even if I didn\u2019t understand it, combining magic and alchemy knowledge was a field I was an expert in.\u201cAh. I explained it in such a difficult manner\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 no\u2026\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, this kind of curse, even if it comes in the form of unknown magic, eventually involves the brain. Whether it\u2019s alchemy, black magic, or divine power, in the end, it relies heavily on the brain.\u201d\u201cAlas\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can think about hearing voices because your brain has been led astray. Of course, I couldn\u2019t correct the illusions, but at least I could give antibiotics.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is the perception that what we see and hear is not reality. The human body is really amazing. Of course, these illusions cannot be cured with drugs. The science of magic is more complicated than you think. Let me explain by involving alchemy\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026 That\u2019s right. Yeah.\u201dI could see people nodding, but I knew they did not understand. Even if one knew about how the brain worked, they still wouldn\u2019t understand, nor would they call me out on my bluffing.Of course, in Jeong-yeon and Hayan\u2019s case, their questions were a little more different. I explained things as subtly as I could, to the point where they believed I had given an accurate answer.\u2018Very good.\u2019I could already feel my reputation rising. When I first came to the guild, I would not have thought that this would happen.\u201cIn fact, when I first heard that the alchemist was brought at that price, the executives thought the higher-ups were crazy\u2026 Looking at you now, I realize that you really are a genius. Ha\u2026 What have you been doing back on Earth?\u201d\u2018Genius is such an inaccurate terminology.\u2019The word scammer fits me better.\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything that warrants such praise.\u201d\u201cDid you work in a research institute or something?\u201d\u201cWell, in a way, yes. It\u2019s a bit difficult to tell in detail.\u201dOf course, that was a big fat lie.\u201cThank you very much. I am really reassured to have Kiyoung around. I thought the media was lying when they said you were a genius, but it\u2019s actually amazing to have such a person in the party.\u201dIt feels good to be praised, but I knew an age-old trick that would surely make me seem humble. Rather, it is guaranteed to warrant more praise.\u201cHahaha. I feel embarrassed now. It\u2019s not like that. A lot of magazines exaggerate.\u201d\u201cYou look like the smartest person I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201dEven this woman, Park Gahyeon, expressed her likability towards me. We were similar because we had left our younger siblings behind, and she seemed to be attracted to me. However, she couldn\u2019t express this outright.This was because Jung Hayan had fixed her attention on her with a glare, making her whole body tremble.\u2018I haven\u2019t completely fixed Hayan yet.\u2019Perhaps Jung Hayan\u2019s obsession with me could not be cured, even if a lifetime were to occur.\u201cOh, I\u2019m overdoing this. I feel so embarrassed in front of Jeong-yeon.\u201d\u201cNo. I just have a good memory.\u201dIn summary, they were starting to recognize me as a genius alchemist, wondering if I was the type who was only born once every tens of thousands of years.\u201cThe other alchemists I met before didn\u2019t feel like this.\u201d\u201cThere are alchemists who are smarter than me in Lindel. The only difference would be that they didn\u2019t get support, and I had a good start. In fact, everything is thanks to the Blue Guild.\u201d\u201cAh, you are so humble.\u201dIt was not humility; it was the plain truth. No matter what bullshit I spouted at this point, my pure image had already been established and would not collapse.\u2018Lee Kiyoung, a genius alchemist from the sky.\u2019Humans were usually jealous of people who are good at what they can understand. However, I was treated with reverence for my so-called achievements. Once this dungeon expedition was over, I would have permanent, substantial influence in Blue.This was also because Lee Sang-hee failed on her responsibilities as a good leader. Of course, she wasn\u2019t the type to be obsessed with power. She had a sense of responsibility, but she didn\u2019t bode well under pressure.Currently, she seemed to feel ashamed of how she had chosen to react under the curse\u2019s influence. She must\u2019ve thought something along the lines of \u2018I almost killed all the guild members,\u2019 or \u2018This job doesn\u2019t suit me.\u2019 Her self-blame was highly evident.As I rested, Kim Hyunsung began to talk to the rest of the party, never missing the opportunities I opened up. Again, humans either despised or revered what they could not understand.Until now, it had been me who had proved my worth, but now, it was his turn. He moved while I was taking a short break.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter how much the curse has influenced me, I should have kept my cool, yet I put you at risk. I have no excuses.\u201dIt was Lee Sang-hee who spoke up. Her personality was my favorite. She was the type to apologize even if there was nothing to apologize for.\u201cFrom this point on, we will adjust the party\u2019s route. We will consider clearing the dungeon as the primary priority rather than rescuing the survivors, and we will rescue the corpses and any survivors after completing the attack.\u201d\u2018Finally.\u2019It was a very reasonable judgment. To save the dead, a living person cannot die.The order had only been reversed, but Lee Sang-hee\u2019s words meant a lot.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, we will not stop searching for survivors. We will change the formation and move faster.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cI will have Mr. Hyunsung take the lead.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dIt looked like Kim Hyunsung had bided his time until the perfect opportunity arose. No more party members were affected by the curse. From his point of view, one worry had gone away.Kim Hyunsung looked at me with mirth dancing in his eyes. It was certainly advantageous for him to have the lead handed to him without any further complications. There was also something ominous in the way he presented himself.\u2018Is this intimidation?\u2019It was a fervor. Slowly, the party members stood straight, almost as if possessed.\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019Kim Hyunsung was the ideal leader. Even Lee Sang-hee was also looking at him with a blank expression. He could be seen as a little dogmatic. But in the first place, it could be considered that his judgment excluded the party members\u2019 opinions.He did what he thought was right and went straight for the goal. His whole demeanor screamed, \u2018This is the right way. Let\u2019s go together.\u2019Simply put, he possessed the charm that would make anyone want to follow him\u2014the ideal leader. Though I wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about a ruler\u2019s workings, he was born to be a leader.\u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201dThe effect was immediate. Everyone went to obey Kim Hyunsung.He urged the party to move at a faster pace, and so we quickened our steps. We ignored the search for any other alternative directions and focused on moving forward. I had no complaints about having him lead us as I trusted him immensely.We moved as if we weren\u2019t worried about encountering monsters. We didn\u2019t take into account any traps that may lie waiting. There was something about Hyunsung\u2019s confidence that compelled the members to not worry about such trivial matters.\u2018Are there really no monsters?\u2019I knew it was a possibility, but I hadn\u2019t expected it to be true. Perhaps this dungeon solely relied on the curse itself. If that hypothesis were correct, it would be obvious where Kim Hyunsung would be heading. We would be searching for the dungeon owner and the magician who had cast the curse.As we continued to walk, the scenery began to change. The number of forks in the passages lessened, and the small room where we came from was now invisible. Although we were walking at a fast pace, it seemed like the end of the dungeon was still far off.Of course, there were several attacks from the curse, but no one suffered lasting damage. This meant that the \u2018treatments\u2019 were effective.\u201cThe undead\u2026 No\u2026\u201d\u201cI definitely got a report\u2026.\u201d\u201cPerhaps seeing the undead near the entrance triggered the curse. It\u2019s not confirmed yet, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that.\u201d\u201cPlease stay vigilant anyway.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dBodies were eventually found. They were confirmed to be former guild members of Blue. I didn\u2019t confirm in detail why they died, but I could predict it. They either took their own lives or had turned on one another.Lee Sang-hee expressed confusion at this, but she did not stop the party from advancing further.After some time, we came across a small door that was crudely decorated.As I slowly opened the door, I could see a woman sitting on a chair. She had her eyes closed, and her expression was immensely pale.Immediately, new information started pouring into the status window.[You have encountered a heroic-grade dungeon, the Cursed Shrine owner, the cursed Saint Juliana. The quest is activated.][Heroic-grade forced quest is activated.][Heroic-Grade Quest \u2013 Eliminate Juliana (0/1)]We had reached the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though it had been colossal, its resilience had not been enough to withstand the party members\u2019 attack power.However, the woman in front of me was different. Though I knew nothing about her, I could feel an ominous aura in her presence. She certainly seemed like a priest with the uniform she wore, but the atmosphere she gave off seemed overbearing, to the point that I felt overwhelmed.I realized at once that she was the predator, and I was the prey.At this very moment, I missed being in a safe area in the rear of Kim Hyunsung\u2019s party.\u2018Hyunsung\u2026 Is this okay?\u2019Ahhh\u2026 Gedric\u2026 My Gedric! You finally came to see me\u2026\u2018What bullshit is she talking about?\u2019You finally found me. My lovely Gedric!Upon saying this, the woman bent her neck at an impossibly awkward angle, horrifying my party members. Then, she reached out to me.I thought about pretending to be Gedric for a while, but it would be dangerous to take the lead in a situation like this. It would be best to retreat to the rear and wait until the leaders themselves figured out what to do.\u2018Can the woman not see?\u2019At this moment, Kim Hyunsung took one more step.You are not him. Not him.After frowning heavily, the woman who had been called Juliana opened her eyes, showing black pupils that seemed to have the ability to suck the life out of anyone.The physiological effect was instant. Goosebumps rose on my skin.\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019You\u2019re not him!The very ground we stepped on began to crack, and the inside of the dungeon shook tremendously. I could sense strange energy as magic power began to spread in all directions, accompanied by a loud ringing voice. This caused me to cup my hands over both ears.When I thought I would start bleeding from the intense pressure, a barrier covered the whole party. It turned out to be Sun Hee-young\u2019s defense, choosing to block the energy with divine magic.It\u2019s not him!\u201cEveryone, prepare for battle! Wizards, prepare your spells, and priests, keep the divine power going. We judged that it was a monster that couldn\u2019t attract aggro, and we will proceed with the operation as defensively as possible. This will be a long battle.\u201d\u201cNoted!\u201dLee Sang-hee, who was calmer than expected, covered the rear with a large shield. As soon as the spell was recited, magical power began to rise from the area. It was up to the vanguard to earn us some time until we finished casting the magic.Of course, this did not mean that my side stood still.Starting with Kim Hyunsung, some began to shoot at Juliana.\u2018Stay safe, Hyunsung.\u2019The energy that seemed to be neither magic nor divine power burst out in all directions. The owner of this energy was blatantly obvious.\u2018Juliana.\u2019\u201cPlease prepare your defense magic.\u201dYou\u2026 You dare invade this place\u2026 This place!Shing!It was a spectacle to witness the black sphere of energy rushing towards us, leaving cracks on the ground in its trail. However, this did not bode well for us.Lee Sang-hee instinctively brought up her shield to block the incoming attack. In the end, she was successful, but it had not been an easy task. It had only been possible because she had been infused with divine magic.\u2018This will not be an easy fight\u2026\u2019Our strategy needs to be a little different than our usual method of hunting monsters.Back in the Garden of Terror, the monsters\u2019 attacks focused on those at the forefront. However, it seemed that Juliana had chosen not to target anyone in particular. Her main goal was to eradicate everyone she saw as \u2018intruders.\u2019This was the ideal moment to run away.It wasn\u2019t easy to deal with her and attack simultaneously, as our forces also had to focus on protecting the party\u2019s weaker defenses. The casting time proved to be longer than expected.Since this was meant to be a withstanding battle, the tankers had to make sure that we wouldn\u2019t receive any lasting damage. Archers with high agilities couldn\u2019t expect any additional help.As Hwang Jeong-yeon and Jung Hayan recited their spells, the resulting magical power was enormous. It enveloped the madwoman in no time at all, but the black sphere of energy returned to combat the power.At this moment, I released the spell that I had been memorizing.A huge arm arose out of the air and fell with the momentum to crush Juliana, who was currently wrapped around in the black sphere.Swoosh!The expressions of my fellow party members showed their initial surprise at this. The dust soon settled to reveal Juliana looking my way.You dare!My magic was strictly classified as physical. I didn\u2019t know if this was why I was able to inflict some damage on our opponent. However, this did not spell good news for me.\u2018Shit.\u2019I didn\u2019t know if it was intentional, but the black sphere of energy was now coming my way.Kim Hyunsung was in a position where he couldn\u2019t easily deflect the attack with his sword, should it ever come my way. I knew I would be able to continue inflicting damage as long as I was being protected.\u2018Is this how heroic-grade dungeons are?\u2019I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy, and yet I didn\u2019t expect it to be this hard.Now and then, roars reverberated throughout the dungeon, and the ground shook, cracks opening in various places. Perhaps this was why Kim Hyunsung couldn\u2019t move properly.Lee Sang-hee was able to hold her ground, but Park Deokgu, who only had a meager amount of magic power, could only block small attacks.The only good thing was that the curse had not afflicted us yet. If one were to see hallucinations in this situation, it could prove fatal on our side.Somehow, I had to make a decision.I wanted to stay away from situations that could end up costing me my life. In the end, I settled for speaking up.\u201cAh, my Juliana!\u201dSoon, a strange vision settled upon the room.Ah, Gedric?My voice unexpectedly burst in the middle of the battle, effectively causing a lull within the fight. At this, my fellow party members looked at me confusedly, wondering what I was doing. However, I did not incline to answer.They would know soon, anyway.\u201cJuliana! My Juliana!\u201dGedric! Ah, you came. Gedric\u2026 You finally came.\u201cJuliana! I\u2019ve been looking for you for an eternity. This shrine!\u201dGedric, finally\u2026\u201cJuliana!\u201dOh, no. You are not Gedric.\u2018Damn.\u2019\u201cMany years have passed, Juliana. Contrary to you, who has been bound by this shrine, I have undergone many changes. An insurmountable amount of time has passed. My tone, my existence, and everything I am have changed.\u201dNo. You are not Gedric.\u201cJuliana! My love, Juliana!\u201dYou are not Gedric!\u201cJuliana, I have changed, but I still remember that day. I have always kept my memories of you within this body.\u201dAh\u2026\u201cThat precious memory\u2026\u201dGed\u2026rick?I didn\u2019t know what exactly she was thinking about, but I knew something would come to mind. Black tears flowed out of Juliana\u2019s empty eyes. It was a grotesque sight to behold.However, I needed to focus. If I could find a way to weasel out more information\u2026On that day\u2026Anxiety rose within me. All it would take was one mistake for her to find out.\u201cWe are each other\u2019s\u2026 Ahhh! Juliana!\u201dGedric!\u201cThey are oppressing me, Juliana! Ahh!\u201dLee Sang-hee, Park Deokgu, and Sun Hee-young all looked at me with irresistible curiosity. Meanwhile, jealousy was written all over Jung Hayan\u2019s face.\u2018Everyone has noticed\u2026\u2019As I glanced around the rest of my comrades, I caught sight of Hwang Jeong-yeon, nodding.Nevertheless\u2026\u201cSilly, stupid Juliana. Yes, yes, the Gedric you love is in our hands!\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Knowing Jeong-yeon loved watching the drama, I\u2019d have expected her to exhibit some good semblance of acting skills. However, upon seeing her enact her role, I began to feel concerned about Juliana catching on to our scheme.Hwang Jeong-yeon\u2019s face was a bright red, but thankfully, Juliana didn\u2019t seem to have any doubts.\u201cJuliana! Do not save me. Run, run right away!\u201dGedric!\u201cRun away! Juliana!\u201dYou guys dare! Gedric!I don\u2019t know if this would turn out effective, but it worked better than I had initially thought. Of course, there would still be room for doubts in this kind of situation.However, there was no way she\u2019d be willing to fight out of the illusion. Gedric, who she had been waiting for all her life, had finally appeared, only to be on the brink of death once more. It would be natural for her to have such a reaction.\u2018It would be a problem if she decides to go crazy with her powers, but\u2026\u2019I also knew there was no way she\u2019d dare create an explosion with her energy sphere. By doing so, she would also end up killing her beloved \u2018Gedric.\u2019Unlike the rest of my party members, who continued to look with mounting confusion, Kim Hyunsung rushed towards Juliana, swinging his sword.In truth, Hyunsung was still not at the stage where he would thrive easily inside a heroic-grade dungeon. It was only right to say that he was still in the growth stage.However, the way he moved to block Juliana from rushing over to our party surprised me. Kim Hyunsung managed to block the black energy that extended from all directions with a single slash.Even though her attack range was limited, Juliana kept the attacks coming, with Hyunsung parrying in turn.Quadduck\u2026 Quazzik!As sounds reverberated from within the dungeon, the two continued to unleash a flurry of attacks and counterattacks that I could not even begin to comprehend.\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019Kim Hyunsung tried to extend his sword, but Juliana forced him to retreat halfway. At the same time, her black sphere unleashed a flurry of energy, yet it did not take him much to block.Meanwhile, the rest of our party members looked on with expressions that could only border on shock. No one knew when the right timing was to intervene.In the first place, it didn\u2019t seem easy to set the timing of how to intervene.I will hold them at bay\u2026 Can\u2019t you run away at this point?\u201c\u2026\u201dGedric! Gedric!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was highly evident that the fight had reached a larger scale.Juliana, evidently the owner of this dungeon, had reached the point where Kim Hyunsung was forced to step up his game. Meanwhile, I could feel the room we were in changing, little by little.Can\u2019t you get out of here?Bang!Quadduck!At first glance, it would be easy to retreat. However, this was a battle that Kim Hyunsung had to dish out.Take the curse!\u201cAhhhhhhhhh!\u201dGedric!Unlike Kim Hyunsung, who could fight without any reservation, Juliana alternated between attacking and showing her constant weakness\u2014me. I didn\u2019t know what this Gedric meant to her, but I now knew that he was important enough for her to risk her life. Since someone important to her was being held hostage, it was only natural for her to be unable to properly execute her abilities.Whenever I screamed out for Juliana, she grew more agitated, thereby showing more weak spots. It would be easy to end the fight now.From the moment I had shown myself to her as Gedric, she had stopped executing her powers to the fullest. However, those who were watching the fight didn\u2019t seem to think of it that way.But no, they had nothing else to do but watch. This was Kim Hyunsung\u2019s turn to showcase his abilities to the rest of the Guild members.The guy in question was now biting his lips in concentration. To be able to incite such a serious expression showed that Juliana was very strong. The black tentacles surrounding her stretched out in all directions, all to trap Hyunsung in place.However, he was able to avoid their deadly grasp by dodging or by simply cutting them off. His high agility and flexibility reminded me of a splendid display of acrobatics.Each time a tentacle was slashed off, he would jump to another spot, as Juliana would quickly combat his parry with a second attack.Of course, it was also natural for Juliana to prove that she was not easy to beat.It felt as if I was watching a high-grade fight in front of me. Perhaps, Cha Hee-ra was the only other person I knew who could exhibit the same combat prowess. Even Lee Sang-hee, said to be the strongest among us, looked at Kim Hyunsung as if in a trance.When Juliana first exhibited signs of her unstable behavior, I began to think about the number of ways I could take her down. However\u2026\u2018It\u2019s too dangerous.\u2019If I tried something out and it ended up backfiring, the whole party would be harmed. I was not too fond of gambling. Now was not the time to throw the dice.Wait a bit, Gedric. Just a little bit more!It was satisfying to know that our enemy was successfully taken in with our act, but I felt like I had to intensify it a little more. I could see that Juliana\u2019s desperation would be the key to our victory.She genuinely thought \u2018Gedric\u2019 was in danger. Alas, she was doing her best to fight the invaders while trying not to harm me.Of course, I didn\u2019t sympathize with her actions. I didn\u2019t forget the fact that she was the owner of a dungeon that had swallowed up numerous victims and that my party might soon be a group of casualties if we didn\u2019t win this fight.Simultaneously, there was no excuse for the fact that we had invaded the dungeon even though she had made it explicitly clear that she did not want to be disturbed. Nevertheless, we came here for a reason.This troublesome fly!\u201c\u2026\u201dI\u2019m going to let the darkness swallow him up!A dark inverted cross materialized in the sky. It fell toward Kim Hyunsung, but he swung his sword in response.Bang!Quazzik!Quaddeuk!\u2018He\u2019s so strong\u2026\u2019Seeing Kim Hyunsung tear down crosses that were bigger than his entire being enveloped me with a sense of awe. Without realizing it, I was stuck staring at the scene with my mouth wide open.You will eventually succumb to the darkness!Quazzik! Quaang!\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019What was notable was the fact that Kim Hyunsung was smiling. Despite knowing one blunder could cost him his life, he seemed to be enjoying the battle.Quazzik!The fight truly brought out Hyunsung\u2019s strength. Of course, the difference in stats was inevitable, and Kim Hyunsung suffered a few wounds of his own, but he still seemed satisfied with how the fight was going.\u2018His stats haven\u2019t even reached an average of 80 yet\u2026\u2019You can\u2019t get out of here even now. Shameless intruders\u2026 face my wrath!A sword then fell from the sky, over the cursed saint who appeared to be glaring at Hyunsung. It was not a sword that belonged to anyone.\u2018What kind of sword is that?\u2019No, in the first place\u2026\u2018What kind of fight is this?\u2019The fight I was witnessing was surely out of standard, and I didn\u2019t like it. Juliana, who seemed to have reached the second phase, was clashing with Hyunsung with her sword.Kim Hyun-sung met Juliana\u2019s attacks head-on, and we, too, were affected. However, Park Deokgu and Lee Sang-hee were steadily protecting us, and our magicians ensured that we had an extra layer of safety after each clash.\u2018Will we be able to win?\u2019In the meantime, I was worried about the outcome of the battle. I was sure that Kim Hyunsung would win, but I was worried about the injuries he would sustain in doing so. Even though our party kept a continuous supply of divine power to aid in the battle, there was no guarantee that we\u2019d be able to avoid the worst-case scenario.\u2018Should I believe in him?\u2019I knew this wasn\u2019t Hyunsung\u2019s full ability. He was probably hiding his true power. However, he might have been overconfident in his abilities.You will be trampled in the dark!Juliana lifted her sword, and Kim Hyunsung also concentrated his magic on his sword.\u2018This will probably be the last clash.\u2019I didn\u2019t know how the fight was going, but the ominous feeling stayed within me. When the swords were about to hit, I couldn\u2019t help but scream.\u201cJuliana!\u201dAt this, the enemy in question turned her head towards me. Simultaneously, Kim Hyunsung slashed through her sword with enormous energy, cutting through the air.The next thing I saw was his sword piercing right through her abdomen.Ged\u2026 rick\u2026\u2018Oh\u2026\u2019I\u2019ve dealt with my fair share of monsters up until now, but this was the first time I\u2019d ever felt my heart squeeze upon seeing the death of one.It was probably because Juliana had instinctively reached out for me as she fell.Gedric\u2026The expedition members slowly scattered behind me as this scene unfolded. When the steamy heart was left behind, a new energy spread in all directions.I flinched for a moment, but my head suddenly became clear. It was at this moment that I realized we\u2019d completed the dungeon attack.[Heroic-grade quest has been completed.][Heroic-grade quest \u2013 Eliminate Juliana (1/1)][Gives 4 random stat points as a reward.]\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019It was no wonder that everyone rushed to Kim Hyunsung. An eruption of voices soon reverberated in the room.\u201cHyunsung, are you okay?!\u201d\u201cHyunsung!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dThe first point of action was to check on Hyunsung, but the chaos didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew it would be difficult, but I feel so embarrassed.\u201d\u201cThis is also my first time, so I can\u2019t really explain how the notion of promoting or demoting of ranks works\u2026\u201d\u201cWhatever happens, it will be a blessing to the guild.\u201dI didn\u2019t understand what they were talking about, but I guessed it had something to do with the sword.[Cursing Sword \u2013 Legendary-Grade]\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019It was faint, but the sword kept flashing orange hues.\u2018Great\u2026\u2019I was beginning to understand why Kim Hyunsung wanted to go to this dungeon.\u2018Is it for this?\u2019In front of me was a legendary item, one of the only ones on this continent, I could bet.There were a total of six confirmed legendary-grade items, perhaps a few more, but not more than 10. There was no guarantee that such artifacts would drop even in legendary-grade dungeons.If Kim Hyunsung knew that he would get one here, then his insistence at coming would be understandable. Anything rated legendary was simply phenomenal, be it a legendary-grade dungeon, legendary-grade job, legendary-grade item, legendary-grade quest, or legendary-grade monster raid.Even if there would be a dispute over ownership, it won\u2019t be a strange scene to witness. Even so, the owner was already decided.It was then that I decided to speak.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even imagine killing Juliana one-on-one.\u201d\u201cI could have suffered if Kiyoung had not interfered. Thank you very much.\u201dKim Hyunsung\u2019s desire for this sword was evident. Just as I desired good alchemy kits, he would also want good swords.There shouldn\u2019t even be a dispute as to who the owner would be. After all, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive this dungeon if it weren\u2019t for Kim Hyunsung!Lee Sang-hee also seemed to have something to say.\u201cFirst of all, I will declare the completion of the attack of the heroic-grade dungeon, Cursed Shrine. Clean up the area and search for other items or bodies of other guilds. I would like you to look around in groups of three and report any unusual issues immediately. The settlement will be made after returning to the guild. Gahyeon, please return to the guild right now and let them know the situation of the expedition. And\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell all of you, but I\u2019m pretty sure you all understand who owns the cursing sword. Just in case\u2026 This cursing sword\u2026\u201dBefore Lee Sang-hee could finish speaking, a spectacle occurred.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u2018What\u2026\u2019The sword lying on the ground suddenly started to rise and twirl up in the air. It was natural for everyone to feel alarmed.As everyone looked at it confusedly, the cursed sword slowly approached me. What was strange was that I didn\u2019t feel hostility from it.\u201cIs this a master ceremony?\u201d Someone else muttered.The sword approaching with a faint light seemed to look at me, making a continuous trembling sound.\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u2018Oh no, don\u2019t be like this. Don\u2019t test me\u2026\u2019I then realized what was happening.I could see an embarrassed expression showing on Kim Hyunsung\u2019s face.\u2018It\u2019s not like this\u2026 Hyunsung, trust me, I didn\u2019t mean to do this.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Though he had already received the divine healing spell, there were still many scars scattered all over his body. However, this was natural, seeing as he had just gone through an intense fight.He had small welts where Juliana\u2019s tentacles had managed to hit him, and half of his equipment had flown off or were destroyed in their continuous clash. His appearance overall was very grim.On the contrary, my appearance\u2026\u2018It\u2019s clean.\u2019I suffered no torn clothes or wounds, let alone a single scratch.As the sword approached me, Hyunsung\u2019s expression was similar to someone who had fought to meet their lover, only for them to get abandoned.\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories that legendary-grade items usually choose their owners. This seems like the case now,\u201d Hwang Jeong-yeon remarked.\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve heard of such a story, too, Jeong-yeon,\u201d Kim Hyunsung commented glumly.\u2018No\u2026 Do not be like this.\u2019Embarrassment flew from all aspects of my body. Kim Hyunsung seemed to be feeling the same. I knew he had risked himself for the chance to gain this item, and knowing this hurt my heart.I did not mean to do it, but I apparently had gotten in the way of his plans.\u2018Damn\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to use it for.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m not sure why it so suddenly acted this way\u2026\u201d I muttered.No matter how much I tried to sneak away, the sword kept following me.\u201cIs it possible to deny ownership?\u201d I asked, trying to find a way out of this embarrassing situation.\u201cGenerally, yes\u2026 However, information on legendary items has not yet been released. I don\u2019t think this one will back down so easily, however\u2026\u201d Jeong-yeon replied.\u201cIn that case, how would you like Hyunsung to catch it? First of all, I am not the combat type, nor is it an item I need. It would be better for Hyunsung to use it than me,\u201d I remarked.\u201cYeah. Hyunsung, I think it would be better to try that,\u201d Jeong-yeon agreed.\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah,\u201d Kim Hyunsung responded.No wonder everyone\u2019s eyes were on him.At this, Kim Hyunsung began to reach out quietly, harboring an extremely nervous expression.Perhaps he had already encountered a lot of information about legendary-grade items, hence his hesitation in approaching the sword. Maybe this was even the same sword he had used in the past!However, we had no choice but to accept that handling this sword would not be easy. Even Kim Hyunsung looked unsure.The moment he grabbed the sword, dark energy began to pour out of the artifact. The expedition members quickly scattered in alarm, afraid of what was to happen.Kwajijijiji!Upon seeing this, Kim Hyunsung sighed in resignation. I, too, looked away. My heart squeezed.\u2018Ah\u2026 Shit\u2026\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t think I can. It seems like the owner has already been decided,\u201d Hyunsung remarked in a somber tone.\u201cAh\u2026 But I, really\u2026\u201d I trailed off, trying to find the right words to say.\u201cThis is a very strong sword. It\u2019s a little regrettable, but I can\u2019t help it. In fact, Kiyoung has actually been the number one contributor in this expedition, so it\u2019s only natural that he gets chosen. I also got a lot of help from Kiyoung in the last fight. To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to guarantee what would have happened to me if he had not aided me,\u201d Hyunsung explained.\u201cBut I would not even be able to use this\u2026\u201d I argued.\u201cEven so, Kiyoung, you cannot deny it. I could feel it right after I grabbed it. It has already decided its owner. Even if someone else tries to use it, it will not unlock its abilities for anyone other than you. Only you will be able to make use of its true functions\u2026\u201d he insisted.\u201cWhat alchemist has a sword?\u201dEveryone looked away at this. Everyone knew that me wielding a sword was like a pig wearing a pearl necklace.I had weak physical stats. I wouldn\u2019t even be able to swing it for more than a few times before using up all my energy, but the sword didn\u2019t seem to care.As if it couldn\u2019t wait any longer, the black energy from the sword began to trap me.\u201cAhhh!\u201dMy arm was raised regardless of my will.\u201cSomeone\u2026\u201dI tried to look around for help, but everything happened so fast.A familiar message came to mind the moment my hand closed around the sword\u2019s handle.[You have been recognized as the owner of the legendary-grade item, the cursing sword, Juliana. Congratulations on being a user of the legendary weapon.]\u2018Fuck, what is this recognition?! Take it back\u2026 I don\u2019t want it!\u2019[Cursing Sword Juliana \u2013 Legendary-Grade][A sword used by the cursed St. Juliana. This sword was created tens of thousands of years ago, when Ace, the god of the curse, descended for Juliana. It will not fade no matter how many years will pass. It inflicts a superlative curse that instantly inflicts mental damage to the injured target. You can use the energy of Ace by using magic power. Targets that have been exposed to this energy for a long time are also cursed. You can use a large amount of magical power to cast an area curse. Summons and reverse summons are also possible.][Before Juliana died, she desperately sealed her soul within this sword. Juliana\u2019s love for Gedric is asleep. The sword moves on its own, protecting its owner from threats. Due to the low growth level, several functions of the item are sealed. Magic power increases by 15.]Gedric\u2026 My dear Gedric\u2026\u2018Okay, fine, I admit defeat\u2026\u2019I looked at the sword in my hand with renewed emotions after reading its status. I felt so embarrassed with the specs that my mouth had hung open.The item\u2019s stats were incomparable to any other item I\u2019ve encountered so far. In the first place, everyone had already witnessed just how powerful the curse had been in here.Considering it almost swallowed an entire party with its skill, the ability to cast a curse was enough for it to be called a legendary item.Of course, it would be impossible with my magic power to do as much damage as Juliana did, but the possibility of using it is enough.\u2018What about the sword\u2019s ability to increase magic power by 15?\u2019I knew I had weak stats, but this sword had just given me hope. Plus, it was made to ensure that my protection would be its first priority.Since Juliana\u2019s ego was sealed within it, a new feature had been installed within the sword.The only problem was\u2026\u2018Juliana\u2026\u2019What should I do if the crazy bitch woke up again?My head hurt just trying to think about having to pretend to be Gedric the whole time I would have to use the sword.\u201cThe owner ceremony is over.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 Hyunsung, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen\u2026\u201d I said apologetically.\u201cNo. If one were to think about what Kiyoung has done, you deserve it. Of course, as an alchemist, using a sword will be hard\u2026 In the future, we can train together, right?\u201d Kyunsung remarked.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI think it would be nice for you to learn how to use a sword. I will definitely teach you the basic level,\u201d he replied.\u2018It still doesn\u2019t seem right\u2026\u2019Somehow, I became quite anxious.\u2018Is he mad?\u2019I couldn\u2019t imagine Kim Hyunsung ever harboring a toxic grudge. However, one of the corners of his mouth was clearly lowered. I knew it was because all his efforts had been for nothing.As I looked around, I could see the expressions of Park Deokgu, Sun Hee-young, and Jung Hayan, all harboring a hint of pride.Jealousy was written on everyone else\u2019s expressions, but they chose not to act on this and applauded me instead. I had no choice but to speak, seeing the curiosity on their faces.\u201cThat\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure about the sword\u2019s quality, but the internal features are pretty good. It can inflict curses, and it\u2019s designed to protect its owner.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dEven Kim Hyunsung looked surprised. This was probably because it was a function that did not exist in the first case.Did it change because I had pretended to be Gedric?\u201cAh. Others seem to be unable to read it. It is written that Juliana\u2019s ego is sealed. When a threat comes, the sword will move by itself. Of course, I will still have to make use of my magic power. Anyway, I think it\u2019s because Juliana has identified me as Gedric,\u201d I explained.\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u2018I have to pretend to be Gedric\u2026\u2019If the sword finds out that I wasn\u2019t Gedric, the consequences would be dire. For now, the good news was that Juliana was still asleep from the battle that had just been ensured.However, the bigger benefit was that Kim Hyunsung didn\u2019t seem to be exhibiting any more negative feelings towards me. He even nodded at my explanation.\u2018Did he think it would be useful?\u2019Probably so.He had probably accepted that I was the owner, although his expression was still set in a cold, firm line.When I thought about it, this curse-making greatsword, Juliana, would have been one of the many legendary-grade items Kim Hyunsung might have acquired or known about in the past.However, his disposition and this sword did not seem to match at all. In fact, this sword would have been a better match for someone like Jung Jinho, that maniac back in the tutorial dungeon.\u201cFirst of all, congratulations, Mr. Kiyoung,\u201d Lee Sang-hee greeted.\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 Thank you,\u201d I replied shyly.\u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated, but if Mr. Hyunsung\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I understand, Lee Sang-hee. Unfortunately, it seems to be an inevitable situation.\u201d\u201cNormally, ownership needs to be discussed, but this is a legendary item, and the cursing sword acknowledged Kiyoung. It also seems that our work here is also finished to some extent, so I will be able to head to Lindel right after I finish some other work. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWe were able to gain more things upon the completion of the dungeon. However, due to our failure to bring back the previous party members, Blue\u2019s power had dropped significantly.It might seem cruel, but this situation did not seem so bad at all.Lee Sang-hee\u2019s position has declined, therefore Kim Hyun-sung\u2019s and my internal evaluation have risen as a result.I don\u2019t know what choice Lee Sang-hee will make in the future, but seeing that she felt like a failure in leading the team in our expedition, she would probably step down from being the leader. In this way, Kim Hyunsung had a chance. We had proven ourselves enough on this expedition.\u2018Our condition has also improved a lot\u2026\u2019In fact, it felt like everyone had progressed from the expedition. However, there were still some problems we needed to resolve.Park Deokgu still lied about his job, and Lee Jihye\u2019s plan still needed to grow. I still had a lot of work to do once we got back.However, because of my newly-acquired weapon, I did not feel the oncoming onslaught of stress at all.Getting this sword out would be a problem. After slightly sending in some magical power, I began to mutter.\u2018Reverse summon.\u2019[The cursing sword refuses to reverse summon.]\u2018Huh?\u2019\u2018Reverse summon.\u2019[The cursing sword refuses to reverse summon.]\u2018Go back.\u2019[The cursing sword strongly rejects reverse summons.]I began to panic at this point. Why does this have to happen?\u2018Fucking hell! Go back!\u2019[The cursing sword strongly rejects reverse summons. It has fallen in love with you. The cursing sword wants to be with you. The cursing sword feels angry.]\u201cGo back! Please!\u201d I shrieked.It was definitely a satisfying expedition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMr. Kiyoung, what is written there?\u201d Sun Hee-young asked.\u201cAh, Hee-young. It\u2019s a story about Gedric and Juliana. No way\u2026 I think I should know more about it because of this sword,\u201d I replied.\u201cAh! Are you referring to the book you found in the inner room?\u201d she asked.\u201cYes, I am. Upon reading it, I think it was actually worth finding out. It seems like a legend\u2026 Well\u2026 Anyway, it\u2019s interesting,\u201d I answered.\u201cIt must be fun to read. Could you tell me about it?\u201dSun Hee-young\u2019s curious expression was evidently visible. She had been snooping around me all day as we prepared to head back to Lindel. In fact, it was a nice opportunity to talk, as we hadn\u2019t really conversed with each other, except when it came to volunteering activities.Meanwhile, Jung Hayan clung onto my arm tightly, shooting Sun Hee-young a cautious look. I knew she also wanted a moment to know about the story.\u2018Ah, well, it\u2019s not that long, anyway.\u2019It would be nice to have something to talk about while we headed towards our next destination.\u201cThe story started exactly 10,000 years ago,\u201d I began.\u201cTen thousand years?\u201d Hee-young asked in disbelief.\u201cYeah. This is a story before the birth of Benigore, the Holy Empire, where we\u2019re currently located. It\u2019s stated that a terrible battle took place. It\u2019s also said that it had been a religious war centered between believers who worshiped the god of curse, and those who followed the god of blessing.\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d Hee-young nodded.\u201cHave you ever heard of it?\u201d I asked.\u201cYeah. The religious war created the Holy Empire, after all. That\u2019s an interesting story,\u201d she replied.\u201cYeah. At that time, it was said that Juliana was a saint serving the god of curse, and Gedric was a saint serving the god of blessing. The two didn\u2019t collide directly, but they always listened to each other and stood on the front line. It was also written that 15 years after the beginning of the war, the two collided on the front lines. In any case, there was a big battle in which almost all of the troops were deployed,\u201d I narrated.\u201cThe Berman Cliff Battle,\u201d she added.I was surprised at her sudden response, so I tilted my head and asked.\u201cYou know of it?\u201d\u201cAnyone who has served in a temple always learns the most. Of course, I haven\u2019t heard of anyone named Juliana or Gedric, but\u2026 If Kiyoung\u2019s book is authentic, we could add it to the history books we currently have,\u201d Hee-young explained.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related to the Holy Empire, but\u2026 that might be the case. Anyway, countless believers lost their lives, and Gedric and Juliana also fought until the end and fell off the cliff,\u201d I retold.\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d she asked curiously.\u201cActually, the record of this time is not described in the book. It only says that Juliana and Gedric returned to their respective temples exactly a year later. Of course, Juliana\u2019s diary is very accurate, but it is embarrassing to explain in further detail.\u201dIt was to be expected, after all.Gedric and Juliana survived together for nearly a year in a cave on a distant cliff and eventually developed feelings for each other.People nodded in response as I continued to explain. It was indeed an interesting story if one were to ignore the explicit content in between.\u201cFrom then on, it seems that Juliana and Gedric started meeting. The war had gone into a lull, so there were many opportunities to meet. Colossal damage was dealt on both sides during the Battle of Berman Cliffs. Of course, the two gods initially tried to separate the two, but they already loved each other too much,\u201d I narrated as if it was my own experience.\u201cSo, that\u2019s why she became like this,\u201d Hee-young commented and had a moment of reflection.\u201cYeah. Of course, the two were angry at each other\u2019s gods. Under such circumstances, Gedric built a small shrine in the temple of the god of blessings\u2026 That is the dungeon we went to, the Cursed Shrine. The two decided to stay here, and as a result, the gods became angry and tied them to this shrine,\u201d I recounted.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe god of curse cursed Juliana, thereby trapping her in that room forever, and the god of blessing blessed Gedric, turning him into a wanderer.Of course, the god of blessing did not allow Gedric to find Juliana.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAt Jung Hayan\u2019s words, Sun Hee-young nodded and spoke again.\u201cIt would be natural for the shrine to be cursed. Building a shrine dedicated to other gods in the basement of the temple\u2026 It\u2019s a big offense. Perhaps the undead army outside the Cursed Shrine were also affected by the curse itself.\u201d\u201cIn Gedric\u2019s diary, it was said that the god of blessing blessed them with eternal life, but from their point of view, it must have been a curse. The story ends here. In short, Juliana was forever waiting for Gedric, and Gedric was forever wandering in search of Juliana, whom he could not find.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a heavy story. However, Jung Hayan seemed moved.\u201cThat\u2019s so sad\u2026 She waited for someone who would never come\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but pat her head. Seeing this as an opportunity, Hayan hugged me tightly.\u201cThen, you mean that the undead found in the room on the left was Gedric, Oppa?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, right\u2026\u201dIn the process of searching for an unknown survivor, Gedric, as well as a group of undead, were found. We didn\u2019t have to search to figure out who we had discovered. It was because I was able to find an interesting item in his arms.[Gedric\u2019s Proposal Ring \u2013 Heroic-Grade][You can resist Juliana\u2019s curse.]As I glanced at the items in my hand, I felt like I could roughly understand this dungeon\u2019s original strategy.In addition, why Kim Hyunsung went around so late at night, and what the identity of the undead that the former party saw here.Perhaps the first way to attack the Cursed Shrine was to find Gedric wandering here. To catch him would mean gaining the needed resistance against Juliana.However, that would be a tricky ordeal. It was a huge shrine, after all. It would be close to impossible to find Gedric successfully. On the other hand, not gaining resistance meant bearing Juliana\u2019s full wrath.In our party\u2019s case, we figured out a way to resist the curse before discovering Gedric.Had a little more time passed, Kim Hyunsung could have found Gedric, but the expedition\u2019s results were not bad overall.\u201cLove is definitely scary,\u201d Hee-young remarked.\u201cYeah.\u201dI can empathize with that more than anyone else. My gaze fell on Jung Hayan.Anyway, in the meantime, I would have to learn as much as I can about Gedric. Juliana was currently still asleep in her sword, but I didn\u2019t know when she would wake up. Thus, I needed to be prepared.\u201cBy the way, I know it hasn\u2019t been very long since we\u2019ve gone, but I\u2019ve seen no sign of reinforcements that he promised to bring,\u201d I remarked.\u201cWho?\u201d Hee-young asked.\u201cLee Seolho, one of the retired members,\u201d I replied.\u201cAhhh. Perhaps it is because the Red Mercenary Queen has not yet returned, or some other problem occurred. Anyway, we completed the dungeon at a faster pace than expected,\u201d Lee Sang-hee interfered.\u201cOh, we were fortunate to have Kim Hyunsung with us, then. If we didn\u2019t, we\u2019d probably have died in there,\u201d I remarked.\u201cAh, yes. I\u2019ll ask about what\u2019s happened when we get back.\u201d\u2018Hah, they probably wish we\u2019d die during this expedition.\u2019The timing was definitely ambiguous, but Lee Sang-hee seemed fixated on trying to excuse Lee Seolho\u2019s behavior.\u201cMy Hyung is so kind that I\u2019m sick.\u201dAt this, Park Deokgu and Jung Hayan nodded. However, Sun Hee-young\u2019s expression did not look good.\u2018I guess she doesn\u2019t like him either.\u2019These old men, including Lee Seolho, were no different from the vagrants in the poor. They were useless beings who refused to move on their own. They stepped on others and tried to make a profit by torturing them.I\u2019ve already said it before, but the difference between him and the poor was that he had gotten luckier than them. However, they were all the same\u2014just lumps of cancer in our society.\u2018Oh\u2026 How has it been going, anyway?\u2019What I had asked Lee Jihye to do suddenly came to mind.She would have almost finished what I asked for, but I had to think about the possibility that we couldn\u2019t finish the job because the timing of our departure had been earlier than expected.Then I saw someone running towards us from afar.\u2018Park Gahyeon?\u2019The figure in sight was certainly Park Gahyeon, which Lee Sang-hee sent to the guild one step ahead of us. It meant something had happened.Seeing her anxious look, I began to feel both excited and worried for any upcoming news.Eventually, she reached Lee Sang-hee, panting and trying to catch her breath.\u201cUgh\u2026 Vice Guild Master\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you share the news? Why have you come back alone?\u201d\u201cWe did everything as ordered. I have news to deliver\u2026 I can\u2019t help but\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease calm down and tell me.\u201dI noticed that she felt reluctant to share the news with everyone. However, she had no choice. Upon successfully regaining her breathing, she spoke again.\u201cThe\u2026 The Guild Master has died.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cThe guild master\u2026 He died.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026? The curse should have been lifted\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard it was exactly three days ago since you accomplished the expedition\u2026 He died quietly in his sleep. I knew I had to inform you right away.\u201dLee Sang-hee closed her mouth, at a loss for words. Park Gahyeon, meanwhile, had burst into tears. I\u2019ve never seen the Blue Guild Master, but I could surmise that his personality wasn\u2019t that bad.Logically speaking, this wasn\u2019t a bad situation for our party. We could gain more influence and control over the guild in this manner.Nevertheless\u2026\u2018Why\u2019d it happen so suddenly?\u2019The timing was definitely odd. Of course, it could prove to be advantageous for some people. On the other hand, it could have been an effect of being exposed to the curse for so long, but\u2026\u2018Is this Lee Seolho\u2019s doing?\u2019It was just a guess, but a very convincing one at that.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s hurry to the guild\u2026 Please keep up with our pace, everyone. We\u2019ll get there soon. We need to settle the situation.\u201d\u201cOf course, Lee Sang-hee.\u201dAnd so, the party members trudged on with heavier steps.Perhaps because of the unexpected news, Lee Sang-hee led the expedition with her mouth shut, and the other party members also stepped in silently, comforting Lee Sang-hee.Soon enough, the Free City of Lindel appeared in our sights. We could also see Lee Jihye and the other retired Blue Guild executives waiting for us at the entrance.Seeing that some of the Black Swans were with them, I knew something was up. Suddenly, I found this entire situation ridiculous, and I resisted the urge to laugh.\u201cCongratulations on surviving, Lee Sang-hee. I was just about to find you\u2026\u201d\u201cMore than that, Seolho, what happened to the Master? Is he really dead?\u201d\u201cYeah. He at least died peacefully.\u201d\u201cAhh, where is the body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in the guild\u2019s basement. It\u2019s been three days, yet I still don\u2019t know what to do with the funeral\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dTheir conversation had already bored me at this point. As the two continued to discuss, I looked at Lee Jihye, who smiled and tapped her leg.\u2018Ah, there it is.\u2019I knew a more detailed story would come my way soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Regressor Instruction Manualchapter 101Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dIt was Lee Seolho and his followers.\u201cLee Sang-hee is still\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, she\u2019s spending time with the Master in the basement. You also seem to be heartbroken.\u201d\u201cIt feels like someone in my family has died. The Master was such a special person to Lee Sang-hee. Of course, other people will feel the same, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. In fact, I also lost sleep at first. My sorrow was heightened as there weren\u2019t a lot of people when it happened. However, Hwang Jeong-yeon, I must congratulate you on your safe return. And for other party members\u2026. I am very sorry for your loss.\u201dHis voice was full of favor. Of course, it wasn\u2019t directed to me, but towards Hwang Jeong-yeon, who was considered as the second party leader.Hwang Jeong-yeon must have also felt surprised by his sudden change of behavior, as her eyes had widened.\u2018Ha\u2026I coughed into my fist and resisted the urge to laugh aloud. The old man was so blatantly obvious. Of course, he wasn\u2019t expecting us to come back.In the end, it didn\u2019t matter if Lee Seolho had killed the Guild Master or not. The fact still stood that he would be delighted upon the occurrence of this event. If we had not come back, Blue would automatically be his for the taking.For this very reason, he had chosen to delay the sending of reinforcements. Either way, we had come back.\u2018It must have been embarrassing for him.\u2019It felt funny, but I couldn\u2019t help but take pride in this situation.As I mulled over these thoughts, Lee Seolho continued to talk to Hwang Jeong-yeon.\u201cI\u2019m really glad.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cI was so worried because the reinforcements replied so late. Then, the Guild Master died. I tried my best to help out, but it just didn\u2019t feel right. My anxiety\u2026 Anyway, it\u2019s so nice being able to see you in person once more.\u201dLee Seolho\u2019s red, teary eyes were indeed a spectacle to behold. He would undoubtedly receive the Academy Award for Best Actor if he kept this up.Hwang Jeong-yeon looked torn, so I figured it would be fun for me to step in.\u2018Shall we see his reaction?\u2019\u201cIsn\u2019t it too late to say that? I wonder if there was any other reason, Mr. Seolho.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m just saying. Though the Red Mercenaries were late, there were also the Black Swans. There are also loads of people in need of a job. It wouldn\u2019t be so hard organizing a unit. Of course, it would be impossible if you were given a short time. However, we had been gone for so long.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhh. Well, what\u2019s past is past. Can you at least tell me how the Guild Master died?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I said. He died peacefully three days ago. He was fortunate to have died in that manner.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cDid you not think about the fact that he might have been killed?\u201dLee Soelho\u2019s eyes widened at my deduction.\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u201cTake it literally. From your story, does this mean that no one was in the Guild Master\u2019s room when he died?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 I do.\u201d\u201cFrom your reaction, it seems that you didn\u2019t even think about the possibility of him being killed.\u201dAs I spoke, I couldn\u2019t help but let a snarky smile slip through. It was because Lee Seolho had donned a nasty expression.\u2018Did you kill him?No wonder the crazy old man\u2019s face had turned red.In the first place, Lee Seolho had a hot-tempered personality. If he didn\u2019t get angry in this situation, it would have definitely looked suspicious.\u201cWhat are you talking about now?!\u201d\u201cWhy are you getting all excited? I say this in total respect, Lee Seolho\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you saying we killed the Guild Master? I\u2019ve never once thought about that!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even say our fellow guild members did it. I was just asking if there were any possible intruders\u2026 You seem to be overly excited about this, and I don\u2019t know why.\u201dSeolho was taken aback by what I said and struggled to find his words for a while.\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2026 Still\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps you feel attacked from what I said?\u201d\u201cDo you dare talk to me like that? Me, who has maintained Blue Guild up until now?!\u201d\u201cYour story has nothing to do with me, regardless of how many years you\u2019ve spent in service. However\u2026\u201dHe fell silent.\u201cLet\u2019s see, why do you keep speaking so plainly? Do you not mention your position enough? Why must you be so loud and defensive about it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have to be careful with your words, Mr. Seolho. If the Guild Master dies, do you think that means the end for Blue? There are various degrees of incompetence. What kind of executive lets the guild\u2019s reputation fall into disarray? Did you get sick of dealing with such affairs? It sounds ridiculous, and it doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201dMy arguments seemed to hit like daggers as he was at a loss for words.\u201cIsn\u2019t it normal to make sure that there was no intrusion from the outside, or if there had been people inside the Guild Master\u2019s bedroom? If your definition of working hard is not enough, then just step down from your seat. You\u2019re not helping Blue at all. And then what? The reinforcement formation was late, so it couldn\u2019t be helped? That\u2019s what you call an excuse. That\u2019s what you call incompetence. To say you couldn\u2019t help it, it saddens me. Did you think we would accept that? Why are you doing this?\u201d | exclaimed.My tone rose as I speak further, but there was no response from him.\u201cYou know. This is not a school. You can\u2019t just apologize for your mistakes and leave it at that. Do you think of yourselves as pillars that have kept Blue standing? No, if the Guild Master was the head, then you are all just branches.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 How dare you!\u201dIn an instant, magical power had condensed in Seolho\u2019s hand. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t even hit me. He would know better than to do something so careless.On the other hand, perhaps he desperately wanted to do something to relieve his anger?If he actually did hit me, it would surely hurt. I was just a weak alchemist.Jung Hayan\u2019s eyes had widened, and she had started to memorize her counter-spell. However, the old man\u2019s fist was faster.I knew it was coming, and yet, I did not try to dodge. This wasn\u2019t because I was a masochist at heart. I simply found no reason to avoid the attack.Why?\u201cOh, Juliana? You don\u2019t have to feel so excited, you know\u2026\u201dIt was simply because something else had targeted Lee Seolho.\u2018It\u2019s so nice to have insurance. So, so nice\u2026\u2019\u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. This is an item that I happened to get from the dungeon. It seems to have multiple functions. For one, it has a function that could turn that anger of yours into a peaceful death. Could you please remove your hand first, Lee Seolho? My Juliana seems to be ready to strike.\u201dAt this, Lee Seolho slowly retracted his arm. At the same time, my lovely Juliana also began to approach my way.It was also nice to see Jung Hayan harboring such a bitter expression.\u2018Don\u2019t be jealous of the sword\u2026\u2019She probably felt that way because the sword had been able to do what she couldn\u2019t, which was to rescue me from the impending threat.\u201cI have something to attend to, so I\u2019ll get up first, Seolho.\u201d\u201cAt least make sure you write a report on what happened that day. What was the security situation when the Master died? What about the people who entered the guild? And, what about the general guild members? Oh, also, you need to send us an explanation of how the rescue team was delayed. I might even have to open up an investigation. However, I am giving you a chance. Wouldn\u2019t that be a less embarrassing scenario? Hayan, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAs I saw the expressions on the faces of Lee Seolho\u2019s followers, I felt my lips curling up into a satisfied smile.They all looked as if they were about to disintegrate.If it had been a place where we were alone, they would have tried to teach me a lesson. However, the problem was that many guild members were curiously looking our way.\u201cDid you see it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that weapon\u2026 What?\u201dThere was admiration in their voices.At the same time, I knew something had changed. Whatever it may be, I knew that they would treat me with more caution from now on\u2026 and perhaps, a little more respect.As my smile began to widen, Jung Hayan asked a question.\u201cOppa?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s true that those people killed the Guild Master\u2026 Can you inform me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou told me to write a report about it before.\u201d\u201cAhhh. No. It would be better for you to stay away from this situation, Hayan.\u201dJung Hayan looked as if she didn\u2019t understand. With her intelligence, I found it hard to believe that she couldn\u2019t. Perhaps it was just her attitude talking. Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cNew changes will soon take place. This was the best way I could think of.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cA human is not an animal that can do anything perfectly. No matter how accurately Lee Seolho can describe the time of death\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cObviously, he\u2019ll slip up somehow. It happened three days ago. Who\u2019s to say he can remember every single detail? It doesn\u2019t matter if Joo Seung-jun really died naturally, and the truth will come out soon enough. It\u2019s only natural to think that someone had killed the Guild Master.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Then that means you need the right evidence.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the evidence that matters.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cAre we reasonable for feeling suspicious? That is what will draw them in.\u201d\u201cOne can create \u2018pieces of evidence\u2019 if the said cause of death was, let\u2019s say, a heart problem. People will believe them if we go down that route.\u201dUpon seeing Jung Hayan nodding at my words, I realized I had made a mistake.I knew, for all she was worth, that she was still pure-minded. Informing her about this meant that I had just shown her another harsh feature of reality.\u2018Will this mean she\u2019ll evolve for the better?\u2019Obviously, the answer was no.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
