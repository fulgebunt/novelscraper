After taking a few deep breaths in, he turned around and headed back to the living room. He asked the few of them, \u201cTell me, which part of me, Shen Yu, is less than that person surnamed Feng? I\u2019ve been with God Bless longer than he has and I\u2019ve gone for more missions than he has. If he didn\u2019t obtain a massive amount of God Bloods by kissing as*, I would\u2019ve beaten him up to the point his mother can\u2019t even recognize him!\u201dThe four imperial-level purple gold-rank powerhouses dared not speak. All they did was listen while standing. Even the man with the buzz-cut hid the beer bottle in his hand behind his back secretly.\u201cF*ck! He made my team bait while his team went for the loot. Who the hell does this Feng Li think he is?! He\u2019s just good at kissing as*! They even asked him to lead the mission this time!\u201dThe four of them listened to Shen Yu vent for over ten minutes without saying anything. Until he had released everything and returned to his room, the long-haired man who came back with Shen Yu asked the man with the buzz-cut and the short, buff man, \u201cOld Lei, Old Cui, have you guys had dinner?\u201d\u201cNot yet, we were waiting for you guys to come back,\u201d The man with the buzz-cut who was addressed as Old Lei took another sip of beer.\u201cLet\u2019s order take-out. I\u2019m sure Boss doesn\u2019t want to eat out.\u201d The long-haired man glanced at the remaining three of them. \u201cWhat do you guys feel like eating?\u201dThe few of them named what they craved. He walked to Shen Yu\u2019s room after jotting them down.Old Lei then waved at the bald man who came back with Shen Yu. He asked while lowering his voice, \u201cWhat exactly happened, Old Wei?\u201dOld Cui came closer after hearing Lei An\u2019s question.Old Wei peeped at Shen Yu\u2019s room. Noticing that Shen Yu did not stop them with the question, he spoke quietly, \u201cBoss Feng is the captain of the mission this time.\u201dA cough came from Shen Yu\u2019s room as soon as he spoke. It clearly came from the long-haired man.Old Wei changed what he was going to say immediately. \u201cAs the captain of the mission this time, Feng has three demigods and 20 imperial-level purple gold-rank powerhouses in his team. He asked our team and Master Li\u2019s team to be the bait to get the Purple Crow\u2019s attention. As the third team, they\u2019ll be hiding in the dark all this time and will only show themselves to get the target in the very last moment. Moreover, he asked both of our teams to be their backups.\u201d\u201cIn other words, we\u2019re just the bait and they\u2019ll take the credit.\u201d Old Cui raised his brow.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we can do. Feng has a good relationship with higher management. They made him the captain of this mission.\u201d Old Wei spread his arms while feeling helpless. \u201cFurthermore, we\u2019re not the only bait. I\u2019m guessing except himself, everyone else, including the team that he\u2019s leading, are the bait too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Him wanting to go for the target himself is a good thing for us. Believe me. That thing is a curse as soon as you touch it.\u201d Old Lei took another sip of his beer.At the moment, Shen Yu flung the door open all of a sudden. \u201cLei An, what exactly do you know about the Crow God\u2019s Eye?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already reported whatever I know to the headquarters, but the higher management only sees the benefit and ignored the risk of the item. I emphasized the risk on purpose, but they said I\u2019m just being an alarmist and they ignored me completely!\u201d Lei An had helplessness written all over his face.\u201cTell me everything you know.\u201d Shen Yu took a step out and appeared before Lei An.\u201cSure,\u201d Lei An nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll give you guys a rough explanation.\u201d\u201cThe Crow God of the Purple Crow is a true Protoss. He\u2019s on a completely different level from the fake Protoss that attacked us 800 years ago. His combat strength is at least True God-level or even higher.\u201d\u201cLegend has it that the Crow God has a total of 108 eyes with different abilities in each of them. The one that the Purple Crow has is called the Detective Eye. It can see through lies and reveal the truth. It\u2019s an extremely rare god item.\u201cTo the Purple Crow, the main function of the Detective Eye is to pick out the Crow Spirit. At other times, it\u2019s hardly used apart from in special situations. Only the No. 1 Crow Leader in the Purple Crow\u2019s headquarters has the authorization to use it. The rest have very limited knowledge about this god item.\u201cThe reason I said it\u2019ll be a curse to the person who takes this item is that the Detective Eye isn\u2019t a stand-alone god item. It\u2019s connected to the Crow God\u2019s will. Although this item isn\u2019t necessary the Crow God\u2019s eye, it\u2019s tightly connected to the Crow God. Cutting off such a connection might trigger the Crow God himself. That\u2019s what has been bothering me recently.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s impossible for the Crow God to come himself, the fury of a True God or higher existence isn\u2019t something that we can handle. Nobody knows if the Crow God has an attack tactic that could cross to another realm among the over 100 abilities he possesses.\u201cApart from the Crow God\u2019s Eye, the Crow Spirit is a gravely dangerous existence too.\u201cEach Crow Spirit that\u2019s been selected from the candidates using the Crow God\u2019s Eye will be transformed by the Crow God in an extremely short time. The Crow Spirit will possess a body and spirit that\u2019s as powerful as complete-stage demigod-level as well as the Crow God\u2019s inheritance. The transformation only takes a few mere minutes.\u201cThe transformed Crow Spirit will possess complete-stage demigod-level abilities. They can even unleash virtual god-level ability when necessary.\u201d\u201cTherefore, if we\u2019re still going for the second target which is the Crow Spirit, the only time to do it is the few minutes when the Crow Spirit is being transformed. If we\u2019re too early, the Crow Spirit might not be elected yet. If we get there late, the Crow Spirit will become a great obstacle in our mission.\u201cIf we really can\u2019t do it, we can only give up the second target. The first target which is the Detective Eye is our first priority,\u201d Shen Yu said without thinking twice.\u201cIf we only focus on the first target, indeed, the difficulty of the mission will drop by heaps.\u201d Lei An looked at Shen Yu while frowning. \u201cBut would Feng agree to this? Judging by his character, I guess it\u2019s pretty impossible for him to give up the second target.\u201d\u201cThat dumbas*, he might be killed by the Crow God\u2019s hand in this mission,\u201d Shen Yu condemned, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand which part of him does the God\u2019s Messenger like.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026In Room No. 188021 on the 188th floor, Lin Huang watched the entire discussion the few God Bless members had while sitting on the couch. He heard everything the five members said without missing anything.\u201cSo, the Purple Crow\u2019s electing the Crow Spirit\u2026\u201d Lin Huang only found out about the reason why God Bless came to Bronze Crow City. He also found out that God Bless had more than two teams. There were three teams in total while one team was in hiding.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, Yang Ling and Hong Zhuang must be coming for the Detective Eye too!\u201d Soon, Lin Huang recalled Yang Ling telling him that there was something that could help Hong Zhuang find her brother. Looking at the current information he had, the Detective Eye was most probably it.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only SSR card that I got was a Two-faced Buddha that accumulated from card pieces, I have never once gotten a Bird Sister or a Goldfinger before\u2026 I don\u2019t want to play this game anymore!\u201dLin Huang was expressionless. He had been playing Master XX for half a year, after obtaining tens of thousands of amulets, he had never gotten an SSR card; not even an SR card Bird Sister or a Goldfinger. He only managed to get those by accumulating card pieces so he did not have any hope for the 10 card draw. He had completely given up on the game since he got the nickname and began losing in battles.He placed his finger on the game, took a deep breath and deleted the game. Just when he was about to keep his phone in his pocket, he felt a vibration. He then looked at the screen. It was completely black with a gold-colored sentence in the middle.\u201cWould you like to travel through dimensions?\u201dThere was only one option at the bottom.\u201cYes!\u201dIt seemed like an online game commercial.\u201cYes, my a*s!\u201dSince he had just deleted the Master XX game, Lin Huang did not have the mood to download any new games. He tapped on the home button on his phone. Just as he attempted to keep his phone in his pocket, his phone vibrated again. He took a look at his phone, it was the same page.\u201cStop it! This mobile game is like some online game with endless pop-up commercials, who would want to play such game?\u201d He frowned and closed the page. Just as he wanted to keep his phone, the same page popped up again.\u201cCould this be a virus?\u201d Lin Huang frowned.He was in love with his iFruit7 smartphone that he just bought. He spent one entire month\u2019s salary to get it after all. He restarted his phone and looked at the screen for a while. The page did not pop up again, he was relieved. When he picked up his phone, his phone vibrated and the page popped up again.\u201cWould you like to travel through dimensions?\u201dThere was only one option at the bottom.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cF*ck, this is not going away!\u201d Lin Huang was furious.\u201cSince I\u2019m getting it fixed later, I shall see this what kind of stupid game this is and I will report you!\u201dAfter some hesitation, Lin Huang pressed \u2018yes\u2019 on the screen. As he tapped \u2018yes\u2019, the screen began changing.\u201cDear respectable dimensional-travel candidate, thank you for accepting our request. Please read the terms and conditions carefully. If you agree, please click \u2018accept\u2019 and you will officially be a dimensional-traveler. After obtaining your travel code, we\u2019ll send you a Goldfinger and transfer you to another world. Enjoy!\u201dThe words appeared for about 20 seconds before the terms and conditions appeared.\u201c1. The current death rate of travelers are as high as 73%, please prepare yourself before your travel. Causes of deaths are as below:Suicide \u2013 Death rate: 48%\u201dDeath through battle \u2013 Death rate: 33%\u201dNatural death \u2013 Death rate: 10%\u201dAssassinated \u2013 Death rate: 6%\u201dFailed to activate Goldfinger \u2013 Death rate: 2%\u201dBad luck \u2013 Death rate: 1%\u201d\u2026Lin Huang only glanced at the first few pages as there were 118 pages to the terms and conditions. He was too lazy to read the entire thing so he scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the \u2018accept\u2019 button.\u201cRespectable candidate, you are now officially a dimensional-traveler. Your traveler code would be 142857. Entering Goldfinger page\u2026\u201dThe screen changed again, there was a spinner of 36 columns on the screen. Each column was the same size and there was a golden question mark on each of them with a pointer pointing in the 12 o\u2019clock direction. There were two buttons at the bottom of the spinner, one was \u2018start\u2019 while the other was \u2018stop\u2019. There was also a description of the rules beneath the buttons.\u201cPress \u2018start\u2019 and the pointer will start to spin, press \u2018stop\u2019 to stop the pointer. The item that the pointer stops at will be your Goldfinger. If you did not press the \u2018stop\u2019 button, the pointer will stop automatically one minute after the spin had begun.\u201cUntil now, they have yet to show me the name of the game. Let me know what game is this!\u201d Lin Huang pressed \u2018start\u2019 and the spinner started spinning fast. A few moments, he pressed the \u2018stop\u2019 button. After gliding for a while, the pointer stopped at one of the question marks.It then became a black card and the spinner disappeared. The card was enlarged and occupied the entire screen. Lin Huang raised his eyebrow, the card was nicely designed with metallic black and gold patterns on the edges.\u201cNot a bad card design\u2026\u201d Lin Huang complimented. However, as he thought of the Master XX game that he spent half a year playing, he became upset again as it was also a card game.While he was immersed in his thoughts, a black glow shot out of his phone into his forehead. Lin Huang did not notice it at all as he looked at the screen of his phone that began changing.\u201cGoldfinger has been sent, now randomly picking an initial world for this travel\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I finally getting into the game?\u201d Lin Huang smirked.\u201cAs soon as I see the name of the game, I\u2019ll take a screenshot and report this stupid game!\u201dSoon, the screen on his phone changed again.\u201cThe initial world that was randomly picked is \u2018Monster Paradise\u2019.\u201d\u201cTraveller 142857, enjoy your trip!\u201d\u201cPop!\u201dHis gold iFruit7 phone dropped on the floor. The screen was destroyed, Lin Huang disappeared from where he was\u2026\u2026\u201cTraveller\u2019s Serial Number: 142857\u201d\u201cName: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge Before Traveling: 25 years old\u201d\u201cAge After Travelling: 15 years old\u201d\u201cInitial World: Monster Paradise\u201d\u201cTravelling Identity Setting: Lin Huang, Male, 15. His 13-year-old sister is the only family member he has left in the world. Born with a broken Life Wheel, his lifespan is 10 times shorter than ordinary people.\u201d\u201cRemaining Lifespan: 91 days.\u201d\u201cMemory Integration: 98%\u201d\u201cNumber of Travels: 1\u201d\u201cGoldfinger Status: Deactivated\u201dLooking at the semi-transparent page, Lin Huang was slightly startled. He could not recall how many times he had looked at that very page this week.It had been a week since Lin Huang traveled to this world and became a 15-year-old juvenile. He was outstanding, bagging first place among the fresh graduates at the Hunter Reserve College where he obtained a full score for almost all his papers. However, he had one fatal setback \u2013 his broken Life Wheel.There was a crack in the Life Wheel which looked like a gray stone in his body. It was almost broken in half. Among the 360 Life Light columns, only three were lit and the third one was quite dim.To ordinary people, these columns would represent three years of life but as his lifespan loss was 10 times faster, Lin Huang was left with only three months to live.\u201cI look better now, perhaps the only thing I can be happy about.\u201d Lin Huang threw his head back as he laughed at himself in front of the mirror.He had black, puffy short hair with eyes that were dark and intense. Lin Huang had nice features. Despite that, within a split second, he tightened his fists and frowned.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of looking good? Although the Goldfinger that you promised to give me before I began to travel is with me, at least send me a manual on how to use it. It has already been a week and I still have absolutely no idea on how I can activate Xiao Hei\u2026\u201dXiao Hei was the Goldfinger that Lin Huang randomly selected before he time traveled. It was a black card and he had tried every possible way he could to activate it but failed. He had no idea what the function of that card was.\u201cI\u2019m back, brother!\u201dJust as Lin Huang pointed the mirror, playing the blame game, he heard the voice of a girl from behind the door. The door closed shortly after and he figured that the girl must have entered the password and entered the house.He then shut the semi-transparent page before him and took stock of his emotions before walking down the stairs. He lived in a small double-story penthouse where both bedrooms were on the second floor.He arrived at the ground floor and smiled at the girl who was changing her shoes.The girl seemed like a 13-year-old with short, black hair with a length slightly below her earlobes. Her bangs covered her eyebrows entirely and her eyes were bright and naive. She wore a printed white t-shirt, a pair of faded blue jeans and white sneakers. In all honesty, her clothing made her resemble a boy.\u201cXin Er, you\u2019re back! Wash your hands, we\u2019re having dinner soon.\u201dThey sat across each other at the table. While they were eating, Lin Huang\u2019s left pinky started to tingle. Soon, a semi-transparent video was projected in front of him. The same thing happened to Lin Xin! Her eyes popped when she saw her ring projecting a video.The ring was given to everyone after they received their birth certificate. It contained information that included a personal identity account, and a small space for storage. It was also the only tool connected to the Heart Network. Projections like these were rare and if something like this ever happened, it usually meant something big had happened.\u201cHmm?\u201d Lin Huang stopped eating and stared at the projection. Lin Xin found it strange as well.There was a middle-aged man with a serious expression in the video. Lin Huang recognized him, he was the news reporter from No.7 Safety Zone, quite the popular dude.\u201cBreaking news! Somebody found a new Virtual Eye 310 kilometers southeast from No.7D101. There\u2019s a high possibility of a monster invasion. Those who reside in that area, please be aware. Do not leave the foothold, stay indoors tonight.\u201dAfter watching the video, Lin Huang frowned as the area number, No.7D101 was the official code of Wulin Town, his home!Based on the area size, Wulin Town was categorized into four grades A, B, C and D which respectively represented an area size that was large, medium, small and a core size, which was the smallest. The number 7 before the letter D was the safety code while number 101 at the back was the foothold\u2019s code.The Virtual Eye mentioned in the video was the portal that the monsters opened to invade the human world. It was named the Virtual Eye because it looked like a semi-transparent giant pupil that protruded towards the sky.\u201cBrother, the virtual eye is so near to our home, would monsters come to the foothold?\u201d Lin Xin asked worriedly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Now that the news is out, the Monster Hunters would\u2019ve received the news as well. In fact, they\u2019d get the news earlier than when we did. There\u2019s also a defensive shield at the foothold which cannot be broken so easily.\u201d Lin Huang assured both him and Lin Xin and then exclaimed joyously, \u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201dAfter dinner, Lin Xin went back to her room to get started on her homework while Lin Huang washed the dishes. The sky was getting darker. Lin Huang returned to his room and looked at the Heart Network\u2019s page to check for updates regarding the Virtual Eye. On the Heart Network, ongoing news about the Virtual Eye was being broadcasted continuously after they received the alarming notification during their meals.\u201cThe Hunters have arrived at foothold No.7D101, close to the Virtual Eye to hunt down the monsters.\u201d\u201cSilver Hunter Li Lang appeared near foothold No.7D101!\u201d\u201cSilver Hunter Li Lang led 18 hunters to hunt down the monsters.\u201d\u201cAfter more than an hour of hunting and killing, all monsters iron-level and above within 100 kilometers of No.7D101 were destroyed. More hunters joined the hunter troop to continue with the mission within that area.\u201d\u2026Lin Huang was relieved when he read the news. He sounded so sure when he was comforting Lin Xin but in reality, he was not sure at all. After all, he had just arrived into this world for a month and it was his very first time encountering a Virtual Eye. But from what he read on the Heart Network, there were no threatening monsters from that Virtual Eye.The time and location a Virtual Eye would open were completely random. The number and level of monsters cannot be predetermined. If the number or the level of monsters were too high, they would definitely be able to kill more than 10 hunters, including the Gold Hunters. The defensive shield in a small foothold like Wulin Town would be insignificant, like paper glue when faced with a massive crowd of monsters. It would be hopeless and useless to try stopping those monsters then.During Lin Huang\u2019s first week since his arrival in this world, although he did not figure out how to activate his Goldfinger, he somehow figured out what kind of world he was in.There were many history channels that spoke of monster attacks on the Heart Network. Lin Huang was taken aback the first time he saw it.What he thought was unforgettable was the ruins of a huge foothold. He remembered each and every detail of the video recording.A giant bloody pupil was opened in the void and countless monsters charged out of it. Within seconds, they broke through the defensive shield of the big foothold. That day, almost a billion people were killed by millions of monsters within a few hours.The foothold was covered in blood with dead bodies floating on the sea of blood while monsters feasted on their remains\u2026The foothold that Lin Huang was located in was just a D-grade foothold. This small town had a small population of fewer than 100,000 people. Such a foothold was the least secured within the safety zone. If this foothold was attacked by a strong monster, everyone would perish even before any hunter could even arrive to rescue them. Fortunately, the opening of this Virtual Eye only released small monsters and hunters were able to kill them.Lin Huang fell into deep thought after closing the Heart Network.\u201cFrom the speed of lifespan lost earlier, I\u2019m only left with 91 days to live. The most important question right now was\u2026 How do I get the Life Crystals to replenish my Life Light? I have no idea how to activate Goldfinger so I best leave it aside. Life Crystals are up for purchase on the Heart Network but it\u2019s too expensive. The minimum purchase, a year\u2019s worth of Life Crystals costs 100,000 credit points. I don\u2019t even have 30,000 in savings!\u201dLife Crystals were a unique item that barely dropped from hunting monsters. There is a massive amount of Life Light in each crystal. It must be chewed in the mouths and the Life Light in the crystals will then enter the Life Wheel.\u201cThe fastest way to get Life Crystals is by hunting monsters and selling the materials on the monsters\u2019 bodies. It\u2019s certainty that there would be Life Crystals achievable from the hunt. However, with my ability now which isn\u2019t even at iron-level, the kind of monsters I\u2019m able to fight are worthless\u2026 Worry not for I shall try my luck outside the foothold. Perhaps there would be at least one Life Crystal. I shall get ready tomorrow and head out the day after!\u201dIt was late at night; Lin Huang stared at the dark sky from his window. After a short while, he emptied his mind and went to bed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the middle of the night, a noise that sounded like glass breaking woke him up.\u201cAhh\u2026!!\u201dJust as Lin Huang woke up, he heard a girl scream in his blurred state. The scream came from close by and he could tell; it was his sister, Lin Xin\u2019s voice.He jumped down of his bed and dashed to Lin Xin\u2019s room. He did not even have the time to change; he was still in his pajamas.He flung the door open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He must have crept in from the broken window. He held Lin Xin\u2019s foot and a blurred sound echoed from his mouth.Lin Xin quickly hid behind the head of her bed, her feet was just a few centimeters from that scary being.She was horrified! She cried and her body was shivering. She was too frightened to even think of running away.Lin Huang then looked up to the man. He had red hair, his chin and clothes were covered in blood.What caught Lin Huang\u2019s attention was his eyes, it was bloody red. Lin Huang was numb, for a second, he thought that the man could just be a vampire.He looked around Lin Xin\u2019s room and noticed her school bag at the left side of the door. Fearful, he flung the school bag at the \u2018man\u2019s direction.The vampire\u2019s senses were quick to act, he immediately grabbed it, tore it apart.In that short distraction, Lin Huang ran to the bed, carried Lin Xin and sprinted out of the room. Just when they thought they were safe, Lin Xin screamed to the top of her lungs. Lin Huang turned around to see the vampire\u2019s vein-bulging arm on Lin Xin\u2019s left foot.\u201cClose your eyes!\u201d, Lin Huang instructed.Lin Xin immediately did as she was told. Lin Huang saw a lamp near the bed, picked it up and smashed the vampire\u2019s arm with full force.The light bulb of the lamp was made of white light stone which will release high temperature light if broken. It was a cheap but extremely dangerous. The rich would never trust such a lamp but now, it was indeed a life-saver.The light bulb of the lamp broke once it hit the vampire\u2019s arm and a strong white light filled the room. The broken white light stone released an unbearable heat that caused the vampire to groan and let go of Lin Xin\u2019s foot.Lin Huang closed his eyes as he took his last few steps and when he opened his eyes, he was already at the door. He did not waste any time, worried that the vampire\u2019s vision would recover, Lin Huang ran down the stairs, panting.As he ran, he remembered reading from a fairy tale book that vampy\u2019s hated lights because it burned their eyes. Vampires are nocturnal creatures, born to hunt in the dark and avoided places with lights and this was precisely why the vampire refrained from entering Lin Xin\u2019s room earlier.From the ground floor, sounds of glass breaking came from upstairs. It was almost as if the hanging lights in Lin Xin\u2019s room fell.\u201cHide in the bathroom and lock the door!\u201d Lin Huang ordered Lin Xin at once.\u201cWh-what how about you?\u201d Lin Xin asked her brother, her tone shaky.\u201cI can handle him, have you forgotten that I graduated on top of my class from Hunter Reserve College? It would be a distraction if you stayed here with me.\u201d Lin Huang explained lovingly to his sister.Lin Xin nodded and did as she was told. She had faith in her brother.Lin Huang had an action plan. He first sent out a distress signal to the Heart Network and then he ran to the kitchen to grab a knife.The lowest level of a vampire was at least an iron-level. Besides possessing 10 times the strength of an adult, with their blood power, they were much stronger than an iron-level monster.Anyone who encountered iron-level monsters may not walk away alive, hunters from Hunter Reserve College included. Therefore, what Lin Huang had told his sister was merely to comfort her as he knew that there was a probability he could lose to this vampire.He thought, however, that it was strange that his head was clear when he was faced with the monster earlier although he was in so much fear and anxiety. In that moment, whatever he had read about vampires flashed in his mind.Vampires were human-like monsters \u2013 they blend in with the human lifestyles during the day but their desire for blood arose at nights.Their food \u2013 human blood and the blood of young girls\u2019 blood were especially delicious, their favorite. They smell blood up to a few hundred kilometers away.Even for an iron-level vampire, as soon their blood power is activated, their strength, speed, and defense would amplify themselves. Their bodies would be covered with an energy layer that formed from the gathered blood power. The energy layer could even turn into wings, tails, claws and other weapons which multiplied their effectiveness.Vampires may hate the exposure of bright lights but it does not weaken them. Their one weakness was a substance called septic divisor that could only be extracted from a rare plant.In reality, the septic divisor was poisonous to most organisms with flesh, included us humans. As soon as it contaminated a wound, it would penetrate into the organism\u2019s blood circulatory system and kill red blood cells. It was sold at pharmacies and some hunters used them to soak their weapons.The septic divisor had the perfect repression effect on vampires as it would cut open the blood layer on their body if they touched a weapon soaked in septic divisor. The would cause the vampire\u2019s body to rot and without an antidote, it would melt to the ground within three hours.However, the septic divisor was not cheap. Even a licensed hunter would think twice before using it generously \u2013 only in times of emergency.Lin Huang\u2019s savings was not enough for him to buy one.While he was struggling with his thoughts, his ring began vibrating again.\u201cI am hunter Li Lang, I assume you asked for help to be sent. What happened?\u201d A matured but young voice sounded from the rescue line across him.\u201cMy home is being attacked by a vampire\u2026\u201d just as Lin Huang finished his sentence, he heard a loud thud. Then, a shadow leaped from the second floor and appeared not far away from him.\u201cI\u2019ve set the location on my ring, please hurry!\u201d With that, he hung up the phone.He needed to focus on defeating a 10-time-stronger enemy standing in front of his face.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHeavy footsteps walked towards him and he could barely make out the being in front of him due to the dust in the air. When it disappeared, he starred right into the vampire\u2019s red eyes which was also targeting him.Lin Huang felt a rush of goosebumps.In a split second, the vampire\u2019s focus shifted to the direction of the bathroom. He could smell the odor of the prey that he was hunting. The prey was just behind the door, it was a delicious and irresistible fragrant to him. He was drooling, all the way from his chin to the floor.The vampire immediately ran in the direction of the bathroom, ignoring Lin Huang.Lin Huang mustered his courage and yelled \u201cHey, did you forget something?\u201d at the vampire while he tossed the knife onto the vampire\u2019s body!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could sense the knife flying in his direction and so dodged it in time. Almost instantaneously, the knife pierced into the wall, its blade still vibrating.The vampire stopped walking and stared at Lin Huang. While Lin Huang was relieved that the vampire did not charge at him, he gulped while mumbling to himself, \u201cLet\u2019s get this over and done with!\u201dHe tossed out the second knife he had with him at the vampire because he was worried that the vampire would ignore him but attack Lin Xin. Therefore, he chose the classic tactic to infuriate and distract the enemy.As expected, it worked. The vampire was furious, he smacked the knife away again. Blood was dripping from the crown of his head to his feet and soon completely covered his body.Lin Huang was breathing heavily. It was his first time encountering a vampire that used Blood Power and he was under intense stress. A vampire that used Blood Power was completely beyond human; it was considered a real monster.What Lin Huang saw later made his heart skip a beat\u2026There was a pair of blood-colored energy supply that looked like wings growing out of his back.They were around two meters long each.\u201cOh no! This monster is not iron-leveled, but bronze-leveled!\u201dLin Huang remembered clearly that an iron-level vampire could only have one energy supply while those on bronze-level could grow two energy supplies.Lin Huang\u2019s face turned pale; he did not know that it was a bronze-level vampire that invaded his home. As compared to a bronze-level, he was more than 100 times weaker than the vampire.\u201cThat\u2019s not right. If this vampire is bronze-level, he wouldn\u2019t be harmed by the broken white light stone to the extent he would let his prey go.\u201d Lin Huang recalled when he hit the vampire with the lamp earlier; the vampire lets go of Lin Xin due to the burning heat.He took a closer look at the vampire, and soon he noticed there were two obvious wounds on him. One was on his right shoulder where it was so deep that his bone was exposed while another one was on his left chest where the knife pierced through, almost two centimeters away from his heart.The wounds started to rot; it seemed that the cut happened earlier than an hour ago. The wounds were not initially noticeable because the vampire\u2019s body was out of the window and he was filled with blood. Now that he saw them clearly, he understood why this bronze-level vampire had the strength that was weaker than an iron-level.\u201cHe looks extremely weak now and it looks like even his heart was contaminated with septic divisor and he might not live for more than three hours. No wonder his strength regressed. As long as I stay a distance away from him and try my best to avoid the attack from his Blood Power, I should be safe!\u201dNow that he was clear about how severely hurt the vampire was, Lin Huang\u2019s fear was gone. He had one thought on his mind \u2013 to drag the vampire to his death!The vampire gave Lin Huang a deadly stare, the wings on his back got longer and turned into two sharp cones charging his way.Lin Huang had expected that to happen. He took a few steps to his right and dived onto the dining table, few meters away.The first hit was a miss. His wings became long canes and he turned towards Lin Huang. The cupboard and chairs in the way were crushed.If the hit were to fall on Lin Huang, even if he did not die, his boned would have been crushed too.Lin Huang jumped and with one hand supported on the second floor, he managed to cross the railings and onto the second floor.The vampire\u2019s second hit smashed the dining table and the pieces were spread onto the ground.Lin Huang stood, frozen on the second floor as he was worried that the vampire would go for Lin Xin instead. He picked up a porcelain vase and threw at the vampire.He heard a \u201cBang\u201d. The vase crushed the vampire\u2019s wings and the vampire roared in pain in Lin Huang\u2019s direction.There was a limit to the strength and extension of his wings. The vampire noticed that he could not reach Lin Huang anymore, so he jumped to the second floor where Lin Huang was standing.Lin Huang immediately fled and hid under his bed.There, he found a wooden box that was one foot long. He opened the box and took out a silver pistol.It was a Gray Eagle17, the latest pistol from the Eagle Company. Its power was impeccable; it was nothing less than an iron-level firearm.With Lin Huang\u2019s financial situation, it was impossible that he could afford such weapon.It was a reward for getting number one in his college education.Lin Huang took out the pistol and put the two remaining cartridges into his left pocket. He then opened the safety catch. Just when he aimed his pistol at the door, the vampire barged in.\u201cBang!\u201dA fire was shot from under the bed and the vampire groaned with anger.The shot may not have hurt him but as he was caught off guard but that gunshot did dim the Blood Power layer on the vampire.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201d Another two shots were fired.The vampire\u2019s Blood Power layer dimmed even more. He flipped his giant wings in anger and plunged towards the bed.Lin Huang was prepared for that. He kicked the wall hard and got out under the bed. He then ran to the balcony and jumped over the railing.The vampire was furious. He chased after Lin Huang.Street101 was under his balcony, one of the main streets at the foothold. There were street lights with moonlight stones shining on the ground.The vampire could not find Lin Huang as the streetlights were not that bright.Lin Huang outsmarted the vampire! He had only pretended to jump but did not do so. He used his fingers to hang himself on the balcony floor and when the vampire had jumped off the balcony, he climbed back up.Lin Huang stared at the vampire and aimed his pistol at the vampire\u2019s head.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang\u2026\u201dIn the midst of the shots and the roars of the vampire, the lights in the houses on the streets went off. There was pin drop silence. Only the noise from the gunshots and the vampire\u2019s roars echoed on the streets.He could see the vampire with the street lights and he could also see the Blood Power layer thinning and the vampire\u2019s wings contracted back in.The vampire finally stumbled away in excruciating pain.Lin Huang did not bother running after the vampire but instead opened fire and shot 20 times.Seeing as the vampire was not far off, about approximately 200 meters away and so he reloaded a new cartridge, jumped to the ground floor and ran after the vampire.It started off as a quiet night but sounds of gunshots and vampire groans soon filled that silence.The vampire\u2019s Blood Power layer got thinner when the bullets penetrated through his outer-defense layer and straight to his inner body.Lin Huang was cautious to keep his distance from the vampire.With every trigger pulled, Lin Huang felt like a trained hunter.Bullets were hitting on the vampire\u2019s Blood Power layer and soon, it became semi-transparent. At the 18th bullet fired, the vampire\u2019s Blood Power layer disappeared entirely.Lin Huang grinned. He fired his last two bullets at the vampire\u2019s wound, targeting at its left chest. He then reloaded the last cartridge and when he was ready to shoot, the vampire fell to the ground. The vampire attempted to get up but he seemed out of breath and badly injured. He crawled forward.Lin Huang did not open fire but he sprinted to the vampire and stopped 15 meters away as he had calculated before, the vampire could only stretch his wings for less than 10 meters and therefore, 15 meters would be a safe distance.Lin Huang carefully pointed his pistol at the back of the vampire\u2019s head and fired two shots. He was relieved when the vampire\u2019s head cracked and brain juice oozed onto the road.\u201cDing!\u201dA notification came into Lin Huang\u2019s ears. Soon, a semi-transparent page appeared before him with messages:\u201cGoldfinger has been activated!\u201d\u201cHost completed his first kill; one Monster Card is rewarded!\u201d\u201cHost completed rank-crossing kill; one Advance Card is rewarded!\u201d\u201cHost completed double rank-crossing kill, one Random Card draw is rewarded!\u201d\u2026\u201cSetting of Host\u2019s Exclusive Card\u201d\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15.\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSkill: None (Mastered basic skills \u2013 beyond range of assessment)\u201d\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1.\u201d\u201cRemark: You\u2019re so weak!\u201dLin Huang had a strange expression on his face, \u201cThe Goldfinger has been activated, but what do these remarks mean?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could see three additional crystal cards besides his default black card in his Life Wheel.His new exclusive card was beside the black card. The card was the white-crystal color with his photo on the front. It looked exactly like him; even the attire was the same.On the back of the card were the messages.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15.\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill: None (Mastered basic skills \u2013 beyond range of assessment)\u201d\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1.\u201d\u201cRemark: You\u2019re so weak!\u201dThe second card was also a white-crystal color; there were three metal stars at the right bottom of the card. The image on the card was a vampire with red eyes; it looked like it was the same age as Lin Huang.After that, he turned the card over and read what was written behind the card.\u201cMonster Card\u201d\u201cRarity: Normal\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Vampire\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Iron 3-Star (Bronze 3-Star)\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Blood Power (Level 2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Regeneration (Basic)\u201d\u201cStatus: Available to be summoned.\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: This is useless!\u201d\u201cXiao Hei, based on this rarity, how many levels are there?\u201d Lin Huang figured out that the ranking should be similar with the game \u2018Master XX\u2019 people played on earth which were categorized into \u2018N\u2019, \u2018R\u2019, \u2018SR\u2019 and \u2018SSR\u2019.\u201cThe rarities of Monsters Cards are categorized from low to high, Normal (white-crystal card), Rare (green-crystal card), Epic (blue-crystal card), Legendary (purple-crystal card), and Mythical (orange-crystal card).Lin Huang was speechless.\u201cIn the \u2018Master XX\u2019, the game gave out an \u2018SR\u2019 card in the beginning. It was worse in this world because I was given the lowest ranking \u2018N\u2019 card to start with\u2026 Since their rarity differed, is there a big difference between their power?\u201d\u201cFor Monster Cards of the same combat level, the Rare ones would be three to five times stronger than the Normal ones.\u201d\u201cHow about the Epic and Legendary ones?\u201d\u201cThe host has limited access! Unable to retrieve!\u201d\u201cIf I were to draw a Monster Card from you, what percentage would I have to get something that is above Rare?\u201d From what Xiao Hei described and because he had one chance to draw a card, Lin Huang was excited.\u201cIt\u2019s based on one\u2019s look.\u201d\u201cWhat, based on my look? There\u2019s no estimated percentage?\u201d Lin Huang thought that was ridiculous. As a person who was always gloomy, he was not a single bit pleased with the answer.\u201cNo, it all depends on your look.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201d Lin Huang placed his palm on his forehead, \u201cI finished first place in the card game that I used to play. But in this world, the percentage of drawing a rare card was based on my look\u2026\u201dLin Huang calmed down and looked further into the page. Soon he found something he was doubtful of.\u201cWhy is there a bracket behind the Monster Card\u2019s combat level?\u201d\u201cWhen the host\u2019s ability is not sufficient, the card\u2019s ranking will drop automatically. The level in the bracket was the original ranking.\u201d\u201cThe status of the card says \u2018Available for summoning\u2019. So, does that mean I could summon the vampire to the real world?\u201dLin Huang was excited and wanted to give it a try.Suddenly, he saw there was a monitor bird that was filled with white feathers and it sat on the roof of a house not far away.He could not tell when the bird appeared so he put his thought to summon the vampire on hold.The monitor bird was initially called a three-eyed bird as it was a bird monster with three eyes. They had 360-degree vision without blind spots.They could look for as far as 30 kilometers away. The third eye on their foreheads functions as a projector and projected the things it saw with precision and clarity.With those characteristics, many capable humans would capture them, tame them, and place them in the safety zone for monitoring.Lin Huang did not want anyone to know about his Goldfinger.He squatted down and checked if there was anything valuable on the vampire.While he was at it, he asked softly, \u201cXiao Hei, who was the one who gave the remark on the card?\u201d\u201cIt was me!\u201d\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201dLin Huang was speechless for a moment after heading that response. He was already gloomy enough; things could be worse if he were to offend Goldfinger.It was a gold-crystal card; there was a golden staircase on the front while the description on the back was simple.\u201cAdvance Card\u201d\u201cFunction: One upgrade for Monster Cards, Tool Cards, and Skill Cards respectively!\u201d\u201cRemarks: Can be used as an overlay. If the card has reached its highest level, the upgrade will be redundant.\u201d\u201cXiao Hei, am I able to use this Advance Card to upgrade the vampire Monster Card that I have from Normal to Mythical?\u201d Lin Huang asked after reading the description.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLin Huang thought for a while glancing over at the vampire Monster Card. However, he decided to put his idea of using the Advance Card on hold.Lin Huang did not find anything from the vampire even after searching for quite some time.He stood up and was ready to leave when a white shadow appeared before him.It was a young, good-looking man who looked like he was in his early 20s. He was wearing a full white suit; his hair nicely combed.\u201cWhat a narcissist!\u201d Lin Huang labeled that person in his heart.Usually, most people would not groom themselves in an informal setting. People usually opted for anything comfortable and he thought that those who dressed up were usually narcissists.Soon, Lin Huang gave the person another label \u2013 pretentious!The man was wearing an attractive red tie. The tie was so detailed that there was a gold ring pattern on it, the rings looked like they were made of small, golden bits.While Lin Huang was checking the man out, the man was returning the judgment.\u201cNice to meet you, I am Li Lang. Did you kill this vampire?\u201d, he said while his eyes glancing back and forth at the pistol in Lin Huang\u2019s hand and the wound on the vampire\u2019s head.\u201cI guess so. He was already contaminated with the septic divisor earlier. My luck was good.\u201d What Lin Huang said was the truth. He did not dare to lie as he did not know how much the monitor bird had recorded.\u201cIt was you who sent out the distress signal?\u201d Li Lang could recognize his voice.\u201cYes, Mr Li Lang.\u201d Lin Huang smiled awkwardly and nodded; he did not expect Li Lang to recognize him.\u201cSince you\u2019re not a practicing hunter, I will get rid of this dead body for you. You killed this vampire so I\u2019ll report this accordingly to the Hunter Association. You\u2019ll receive your reward.\u201dLi Huang was not afraid that Li Lang would steal his reward as the monitor bird was there and it did not seem like Li Lang wanted the monetary reward.After getting Lin Huang\u2019s approval, Li Lang took out a leather bag, two meters long made of a shiny monster\u2019s skin. Li Lang put gloves on and positioned the dead body into the bag. He then zipped the bag and kept it in the designated equipment space.\u201cSo\u2026 Since you\u2019re done, I\u2019m going to find my sister so she won\u2019t be worried about my safety.\u201d\u201cLet me go with you; I could look at the damage and prepare a damage report. Did the monster make a huge mess?\u201d A damage report was a small matter which was not within the job scope of a professional hunter. Li Lang just wanted to know how Lin Huang managed to kill the vampire and scrutinizing the battleground was the best way to figure that out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI don\u2019t want to bother you. Tomorrow I\u2019ll spend some time recording a video and send it to the division of the Zone 7 Union Government and they\u2019ll send their people to inspect our home.\u201d Lin Huang knew the procedure for damage reports. It was odd for a Silver Hunter to volunteer his home for the damage report; with that, he knew Li Lang was up to something.\u201cI prefer to get things done once and for all. Since I\u2019m already here, I\u2019d feel uncomfortable if I didn\u2019t help with the damage report. You don\u2019t have to do an application for the damage report; I will record the inspection and send it to the Union Government. Did you forget that the Hunter Association is part of the Human Union Government? We should not waste time by sending somebody here. This way you can also get your insurance claims earlier.\u201d Li Lang said in a serious tone.Lin Huang hesitated for a while but since Li Lang did not seem that he would compromise, he agreed.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Li Lang said when he saw Lin Huang nodded. He then brought him to the house not far away where the lights were on.\u201cIt\u2019s not that way; it\u2019s this direction.\u201d Lin Huang helplessly pointed to the other direction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He knocked on the bathroom door, \u201cXin Er, it\u2019s safe now, you can come out.\u201dLi Lang was observing the traces of damage. The more he looked, the more surprised he was. From the traces, he could tell the ways that the vampire attacked but he could not imagine how Lin Huang avoided such deadly attacks.Awhile later, the bathroom door opened and Lin Xin ran into Lin Huang\u2019s embrace.Seeing her teary eyes, Lin Huang did not say much. He ran his fingers through her hair and said, \u201cThere, there, everything\u2019s okay now.\u201dLin Xin then quietly wiped her tears off Lin Huang\u2019s chest and let go. She looked at him and asked, \u201cBrother, where is the monster?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s settled.\u201d Lin Huang smiled.Li Lang walked towards them and said, \u201cYour brother killed a bronze-level, rank-3 vampire on his own.\u201dLin Xin looked at Lin Huang in admiration. Although she knew that there were rankings of monsters but she did not have the exact idea of the different abilities each ranking had. All she knew was that a bronze-level rank-3 vampire was powerful, but that her brother was even more powerful!\u201cBrother, who is this uncle?\u201d Lin Xin just noticed that there was someone else with Lin Huang.\u201cUncle\u2026\u201d Li Lang was stunned by how Lin Xin addressed him, \u201cI\u2019m only 18\u2026\u201dLin Huang was surprised that Li Lang was as young as he looked mature for his age. He looked at least 25. What surprised him, even more, was that Li Lang was already a Silver Hunter at the age of 18. He was the genius of the No.7 Safety Zone.Lin Xin had a doubtful expression.\u201cHe could be telling the truth; you should call him brother.\u201d Lin Huang nodded to Lin Xin.\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Xin then turned around and said loudly, \u201cNice to meet you, brother!\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d It was awkward for Li Lang. After some hesitation, he took out a Life Crystal from his storage space and passed it to Lin Xin, \u201cSince you\u2019re calling me brother, here\u2019s a gift for you.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Lin Xin looked at Lin Huang helplessly.She knew very well about Life Crystals; it was one year\u2019s worth of Life Crystals. If they were to redeem the credit points from the Emperor\u2019s Heart, they would need 100,000 points. It was too expensive for her to take it.\u201cThis is too much. We can\u2019t take it.\u201d Although Lin Huang was eyeing on it, he thought Li Lang was up to something for his absurd kindness.\u201cThese Life Crystals are the most invaluable things that I have. Take it; nobody ever gives me back the things that I give away.\u201d Li Lang insisted.\u201cThis guy seems like a tycoon, 99 points for putting up a good show.\u201d Lin Huang secretly gave Li Lang another label and nodded to Lin Xin, \u201cTake it then.\u201dHe was getting more and more suspicious of Li Lang\u2019s intention. There was no way that he could be this kind to them without any ulterior motive!After seeing Lin Huang\u2019s approval, Lin Xin took the Life Crystals and passed it to Lin Huang, \u201cBrother, you keep it.\u201dLin Huang then kept the Life Crystals in his storage space. He turned around and saw Li Lang was checking Lin Xin out, he then pulled Li Lang away from his sister.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about dating my sister, all you gave were just Life Crystals, even if\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish talking, Li Lang interrupted him, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much, I\u2019m not interested in the little girl. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s quite pretty, that\u2019s why I looked at her.Li Huang got scared and took a few steps back after he realized he was being scrutinized and exclaimed, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not interested in men! I\u2019m telling you, not only in this life; I\u2019d only be interested in women even in my next life!\u201dSeeing that Lin Huang got his guard up, Li Lang decided to tell him the truth, \u201cActually I\u2019m here to understand how you managed to kill that vampire. No matter how weak the vampire was, it was still a bronze-level monster while you\u2019re not even an iron-level. So I guess if you have any special skills or equipment, if you\u2019re willing to, I would love to purchase them for a high price.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a poor kid, how would I have any skills or equipment. Let me show you the attack trails of the vampire and tell you the complete battle story.\u201d Lin Huang realized that he misunderstood Li Lang.He then brought Li Lang to Lin Xin\u2019s bedroom on the second floor. In the chaotic bedroom, Lin Huang explained. While listening, Li Lang was observing the damages in the room. The more he looked, the more he was amused.Li Lang started to admire Lin Huang. He knew that if such were to have happened to him, his survival would be uncertain as killing the vampire was almost impossible for him.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to kill the vampire all by yourself. I have underestimated you.\u201d Li Lang patted Lin Huang\u2019s shoulder in admiration. He proceeded to say, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to fix your broken Life Wheel. If you could find a way to make it up to your Life Wheel, I believe you would be a fearless hunter!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have much time left\u2026\u201d Lin Huang shook his head and smile. He did not want to talk about his personal life with Li Lang. \u201cAre you done with the damage report?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m done. Let me just take a photo of the house.\u201d Li Lang then took out a gold coin with complicated patterns from his storage space. He tossed the gold coin into the air, the coin started to spin and soon, it became a thumb-size ball floating in the air.Lin Huang stared at the golden ball.Suddenly, the gold ball cracked open in the center into two hemispheres of the same size while there was a white crystal appeared in the middle.The white crystal was glowing; the white light spread across the house.Soon, the golden ball returned to its gold coin form and fell from the air. Li Lang grabbed it and kept it in his storage space.\u201cIt\u2019s that a gold-rank equipment?\u201d Lin Huang could not help but ask.\u201cYes, that\u2019s a toy that I got by accident at a medium-sized foothold.\u201d Li Lang was proud of himself that Lin Huang was curious. As they were talking, they got closer to each other.His true self of loving to flaunt was showing.\u201cThis should belong to some investigative equipment, am I right?\u201d It was the first time for Lin Huang to see an equipment of the gold-rank.\u201cYes. In the non-combat equipment, this is considered a valuable! But all I needed was to trade with one year worth of Life Crystals. The guy at the market thought it was just an ordinary antique gold coin; he was afraid that I might come back for him, so he left right after we traded.\u201d Li Lang laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s such a steal.\u201d Although he was not sure how much was a gold-rank equipment, he knew a few pieces of Life Crystals could only get him an ordinary iron-rank equipment.As they were chatting, Lin Huang saw Lin Xin yawning. She seemed sleepy, so he decided to send Li Lang away.\u201cMr. Li Lang, since the damage report is done, I\u2019ll have to send you off. You have already seen it for yourself; we don\u2019t even have a need right now, I and my sister would have to sleep on the floor tonight.\u201d\u201cAlright then, I won\u2019t bother you. I will submit the damage control report; you should receive a reply within 24 hours. If it\u2019s approved by the government, there will be people coming to repair within three days. You will have a temporary home while they do the repairing work. You will have to bite the bullet for a few days now.\u201d Li Lang explained the process to Lin Huang.After Li Lang left, Lin Huang stared blankly at the house.His sister\u2019s and his bedrooms were destroyed. Their beds were left with broken pieces.On the ground floor, there was a big pothole in the living room. They could not even sleep in there. In the kitchen, the cupboards occupied most of the space where only one person could sleep in there.\u201cBrother, erm\u2026 Where will we sleep tonight?\u201d Lin Xin looked helplessly at Lin Huang.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet me clear my room. My room is less damaged than yours.\u201dAfter an hour, they had finally made their temporary beds.Lin Xin was exhausted; she fell asleep immediately while Lin Huang continued looking at the damaged room.Lin Xin was in a deep sleep. Lin Huang smiled at the sight of her drooling and thought \u201cThis carefree girl\u2026\u201dHe then thought about his uncertain future that could affect this cute little girl, Lin Huang sighed, \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not an easy task to be a responsible brother!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She seemed exuberant and unphased by the incident with the vampire.However, Lin Huang did not sleep a wink. His mind was preoccupied with the card he had yet to draw.After all that happened, their dining table and most of the furniture was destroyed by the vampire. They did not put much effort into preparing breakfast with the ruckus all around. While they ate, Lin Huang watched the news he projected from his ring. The news reporter was the same middle-aged man he saw on the news the day before.\u201cYesterday afternoon, the Virtual Eye that was opened near foothold No.7D101, closed automatically, one hour after the incident. Currently, more than 30 Monster Hunters are hunting down the monsters within a 300-kilometer radius around the Virtual Eye. More than 3,000 monsters, bronze-leveled and above were killed as of late. Based on reports, monsters that are Iron-levelled in the area will be killed soon enough. It is safe for residents who stay near the foothold to head out now\u2026\u201dThe Hunter Association were at the top of their game that day. They had managed to kill all the monsters that came out of the Virtual Eye in less than 24 hours. Although they had yet to kill the Iron-level monsters in the area, they were not worried. They were confident that such creatures were not a hazard to such a small foothold. Many residents too had taken the matter of killing the monsters into their own hands. They formed teams of six armed adults so that killing an iron-level monster would be a breeze.\u201cBrother, I\u2019m going to school!\u201d Lin Xin shouted.\u201cAlright, be careful when you\u2019re on the road, Xin Er,\u201d he replied.Lin Xin headed off to school right after breakfast. After following her to the door, Lin Huang finished his breakfast and got ready for the day ahead.\u201cXiao Hei, since I still have a chance to draw a card, let me do it now!\u201d Lin Huang said to the black card within his body. He could not wait to draw the card.\u201cAre you sure you would like you to draw your card now?\u201d Goldfinger inquired.\u201cI\u2019m sure!\u201d Lin Huang confirmed the request and nodded hard. He was excited to see what kind of card he would get.\u201c12 cards have been randomly chosen. Please draw one from the 12 cards as your reward card for being the host.\u201d\u201cWarning: You only have one chance. Once chosen, no changes are allowed!\u201dAfter the sentences were explained to Lin Huang, 12 black cards appeared floating in front of him. They were arranged in a circle, like the numbers on the face of a clock.Lin Huang scanned through the cards carefully. They all looked exactly the same to him. Each card was black with a single gold question mark in the middle which looked like a golden flame in contrast to the dark background.Xiao Hei did not rush him. Not getting any hints, Lin Huang shook his head and mumbled, \u201cIt seems like I will have to randomly choose one then\u2026\u201dHe raised his hand and pointed at the card that sat at the 12 o\u2019clock mark on the circle. \u201cI want that one!\u201d he said confidently.Just as he finished his sentence, the card he chose burst into flames and a new card rose from the ashes.\u201cCongratulations, you got a Mission Card!\u201d Xiao Hei announced.He ignored Xiao Hei\u2019s notification and looked closer at the card.It was a golden card with a blonde lady in a black, maid\u2019s costume illustration. She had a voluptuous figure and the costume looked incredibly seductive on her body, especially her cleavage. Although the dress was not revealing, a third of her fair breasts were showing. It was hard to not look at.\u201cCongratulation, you\u2019ve gotten yourself a Mission Card!\u201d The lady in the card started talking and winked at him. Lin Huang was shocked, but soon he was again distracted by her bouncing boobs.\u201cNow, let me read you your mission!\u201d\u201cThe Mission: Become a Reserve Hunter in a month\u2019s time!\u201d\u201cMission Reward: Flawless Card x1\u201d\u201cIf the mission is not completed within the time limit, you will be punished: You will lose Goldfinger!\u201d\u201cThe mission announcement is conveyed, please read the back of the card for more information.\u201dThe lady then returned to her original form, motionless on the card.Lin Huang did not even bother as to what a Flawless Card was. To him, he had to complete the mission or else he would lose Goldfinger! If that happened, there was no hope for him to survive the world alone.He then turned to the back of the card. The description was exactly the same as what the blonde lady had said to him. He then tapped on the card and it became golden dust that was absorbed into his body.\u201cTo become a Reserve Hunter, I must be at least Iron-level to be eligible for the application. Although I\u2019m not capable yet, I will apply as an Imperial Censor for now and see what happens,\u201d Lin Huang thought. He had surveyed into the eligibility of becoming a Reserve Hunter before. He knew there were several occupations that offered exceptions and being an Imperial Censor was one of them.An Imperial Censor could influence monsters to obey him. Not many people had the talent, therefore, an Imperial Censor was a niche and respectable occupation.Lin Huang had a Monster Card that he could summon to disguise himself as an Imperial Censor.\u201cThe Iron-level rank-3 vampire was considered the strongest one among all those who applied for the Reserve Hunter position, but its weakness was too obvious. If someone was to use weapons that were contaminated with a septic divisor, the vampire would be at great risk in a battle\u2026\u201dAfter some analysis, Lin Huang looked at his second card \u2013 the cross-ranking card.\u201cThis cross-ranking card would be wasted if I was to use it on an ordinary card. But there\u2019s no other way. I have limited time to collect all the materials to maximize my chances to be a Reserve Hunter! After the rarity of the vampire was upgraded, its ability should be on par with a bronze-level entity. It would definitely strengthen my chances of passing.\u201dWith a Cross-Ranking card, the higher the rarity of the card, the higher the value. A normal card can be upgraded to a Rare Card with the use of a cross-ranking card. Likewise, if it was used on a Rare Card, that same card would be upgraded to an Epic Card. If it was used on an Epic Card, it would be upgraded to a Legendary Card of an extraordinarily high value.Initially, Lin Huang planned to use it when he achieved a better card but it seemed like he had to utilize it now.\u201cXiao Hei, how do I summon the monster out of the Monster Card?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cFocus your attention and the card you want would appear on your hand. Smash the card and the summoning would be complete!\u201d the instructions appeared slowly on the black card just as he inquired.\u201cWould people see if I summon the card?\u201d Lin Huang questioned Xiao Hei.\u201cOnly the host can see the cards, nobody else would be able to see or sense the existence of your cards.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Lin Huang was relieved. He was worried that Goldfinger would be seen by someone with bad intentions if they could see his cards.After clearing his doubts, Lin Huang focused his attention on the task at hand.He imagined the Monster Card he wanted from his Life Wheel and willed it to appear on his outstretched hand.Soon, a white-crystal card that was the size of half of his palm appeared on his right hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe card was exactly the same as the one he pictured on his Life Wheel. Now that it became physically present on his palm, he could feel the cooling sensation that was flowing from the card.If Xiao Hei did not assure him that nobody else could sense his cards, he would have asked anyone else around him to confirm this, if they could see what happened. However, he knew what Xiao Hei had said was true.Following Xiao Hei\u2019s instructions, Lin Huang crushed the card as hard as he could. He was worried that he did not squeeze hard enough but with just a slight amount of effort, the card shattered into a thousand pieces and soon, it started to put itself back together again. In less than a second, a young man, about his age, appeared before him.Lin Huang was skeptical at first. It seemed like he had summoned another human being instead of the monster he imagined.\u201cYour Monster Card has been activated. Do you want to randomly extract the monster\u2019s skills?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then continued, saying, \u201cCan I extract the skill after he has been upgraded?\u201d\u201cWould you like to extract a skill next time?\u201d The box replied.\u201cLet\u2019s do it next time then,\u201d Lin Huang nodded. He started to examine the vampire that he had summoned.The vampire seemed to be the same age as Lin Huang. He looked like he was about 15-years-old. His features were sharp and neat. If he was in a crowd of people, nobody would be able to tell that he was a vampire.That was the scariest part of a vampire. The humans in the tiny footholds had been a growing population for more than 800 years but with the vampires disguised as human beings, it was impossible to kill all the vampires that were hidden amongst them, like wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing.As long as they did not reveal themselves, nobody could tell the difference.\u201cShow me your complete form,\u201d Lin Huang instructed the vampire.Hearing the order, the vampire\u2019s eyes turned blood red and veins bulged around his eye sockets. His muscles flexed and he grew a few centimeters taller.Sensing the terrifying vibe, Lin Huang finally knew how lucky he was the night before. \u201cThis iron-level rank-3 vampire is so powerful. Although the vampire last night was a bronze-level rank-3, its vibe was much weaker than this one. Maybe it had been weakened by the injuries it suffered earlier. If it was at full strength, killing me would be as easy as squashing an ant\u2026\u201d he thought, as a chill ran down his spine.\u201cActivate, Blood Power!\u201d Lin Huang ordered, his second instruction to the beast before him. He wanted to see the vampire\u2019s true form.Following a deep groan, a crimson layer and a strong stench of blood spread all over the vampire\u2019s body. Soon his body was covered with Blood Power, which made him grow a few times bigger than he was.Lin Huang had forgotten that activating the Blood Power would trigger the vampire, and hence, the groans. He was worried that it might wake the neighbors and they would surely notify the Monster Hunters.However, what he worried about slipped clear from his mind. There were two bloody wings forming at the vampire\u2019s back, like a flower blossoming large, dripping red petals. He stared at them for a long time. They were so stunning that he was awestruck, rooted to the floor, motionless.The vampire stood quietly while it waited for Lin Huang to give him his next instruction.A while later, Lin Huang snapped out of his trance and said, \u201cAlright, go back to your disguised form!\u201dAs soon as the vampire heard his instruction, the Blood Power faded and his eyes returned to normal. He looked like a human again.If Lin Huang did not see the transformation himself, he would not have figured that the guy standing before him was a vampire.\u201cI\u2019m using the Cross-Ranking card on you. Hopefully, you won\u2019t disappoint me in the coming Reserve Hunter assessment.\u201dThe vampire remained expressionless. Lin Huang was not sure if he understood what he had just said.\u201cXiao Hei, I\u2019m using the Cross-Ranking Card!\u201d\u201cThe Cross-Ranking Card is a consumable. You can only use it once. Are you sure you want to use it?\u201d The black card read the warning.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cFollow the instructions to select your target\u2026 Your target is the vampire Monster Card. Agree for confirmation,\u201d Xiao Hei continued.\u201cConfirmed!\u201dJust when Lin Huang said the word, a bright golden light covered the vampire.The vampire then became a giant golden sphere as rays of gold shot everywhere.Lin Huang closed his eyes against the glare. Three minutes later, he sensed the light was not as piercing anymore, he opened his eyes.The golden sphere that covered the vampire had faded away. The evolved vampire slowly appeared to him.The vampire\u2019s appearance did not portray much of a difference. His hair was black before, but now, it was silver. His hairstyle remained the same, slicked back and neat, maintaining the boyish look he had before.However, his student attire was now a black cape which covered his entire body.\u201cYour silver hair makes you look like a character from an anime. If I call you Kaneki, that would be copyright infringement. I shall call you Bai!\u201d Lin Huang decided swiftly. He then walked to Bai and tapped a finger in between its eyebrows.The vampire\u2019s body then broke into pieces and formed a crystal card on his palm.Lin Huang was excited to see that the color of the card had changed from white to green with Bai\u2019s latest look.He turned the card around and noticed that there were changes to the card\u2019s information too:\u201cMonster Card\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Vampire\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Iron 3 Star (Bronze 3 Star)\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Regeneration (Basic)\u201d\u201cSkill 3 (New addition): Boiling Blood (Basic)\u201d\u201cStatus: Available to be summoned\u201d\u201cCard remarks: This is still useless!\u201dAs expected, the normal card was upgraded to a Rare card. There was a new skill added in the description. Just when Lin Huang was getting excited, he saw the remark at the bottom and asked, \u201cXiao Hei, can you give it some better remarks?\u201d he asked, annoyed at what he saw.\u201cNo!\u201dThere was a giant exclamation mark next to the \u2018No\u2019 on the black card. Goldfinger was serious.\u201cXiao Hei, your attitude will not get you any friends.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need friends!\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Lin Huang gave up. \u201cLet\u2019s see what this Boiling Blood does\u2026\u201d\u201cBoiling Blood (Basic): The vampire\u2019s strength would be multiplied for 10 minutes. After Boiling Blood runs out, the vampire will become weak and will be unable to battle for an hour.\u201cThe skill is great but the after-effect is troublesome,\u201d Lin Huang thought. He scratched his head with worry and said,\u201d I\u2019ll try not to use it then, or else I\u2019d only have myself in jeopardy for the following hour.\u201d\u201cOh right, I still have one skill to be extracted!\u201d Lin Huang suddenly recalled. \u201cXiao Hei, if I extract the skill now, would it disappear from the Monster Card?\u201d\u201cSkill extraction is just a way to gain skill from the Monster Card. It does not affect any attributes of the Monster Card itself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Lin Huang said, renewed hope in his voice.Lin Huang studied the three skills carefully. \u201cThe Blood Power is good, but with my short lifespan, it\u2019s not encouraged. The function of Regeneration isn\u2019t too great but it\u2019s better than nothing while Boiling Blood would just be a temporary help. Now that my basic combat strength is low, even if my strength is multiplied, it wouldn\u2019t help that much. Moreover, I would be exhausted for an hour, and that way I would die even faster,\u201d he said as analyzed his options thoroughly.\u201cXiao Hei, I would like to extract a skill.\u201d After some consideration, Lin Huang did not want to hesitate any further.\u201cSkill extraction activated\u2026 Randomly select a skill\u2026 Random selection is done\u2026 Congratulations, you received Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d Xiao Hei announced.As he read the note, Lin Huang could sense something had been added to his body.He launched his Exclusive Card immediately:\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1\u201d\u201cRemark: You are still weak!\u201dLin Huang ignored the last remark and focused on the \u2018Blood Power (Level-2) on his skill. He was stunned to find out that he had achieved the vampire\u2019s skill.\u201cNow that the vampire is ready, it\u2019s time to equip myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Delivery! Please sign for the parcels!\u201dSomebody shouted at the door early in the morning.Lin Huang opened the door to a yellow bird that was about the size of his palm, standing at his feet.The yellow bird was called the Silvertongue Bird as they could learn up to a thousand languages. Although, their understanding of the languages were similar to the thought capacity of a six-year-old. After they learned a language, they could carry out logical conversation with humans for simple purposes.People trained the birds not only for deliveries but for their memory abilities too. In each of their feathers was a hidden storage space where it could contain an item that was as big as an ice cube.The bird saw the house door swing open and turned to face its tenant. It looked up at Lin Huang and said, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Lin Huang. Your parcels are here, please sign your name here!\u201dThe bird then flapped its wings, and a few parcels fell from its body.A few of them were a few times bigger than the bird itself.It then shook its head, and a receipt popped out of its mouth. It flew to Lin Huang\u2019s shoulder and passed the receipt to him.The receipt listed all the details of the items in the parcel.After a quick glance, Lin Huang signed his name and passed the receipt back to the bird. As he returned the receipt, he grabbed a few candies from a bowl inside the house, next to the door.\u201cFor you,\u201d he said as he passed it to the bird.In the world he lived in, desserts were loved by many monsters and candy was the Silvertongue Bird\u2019s favorite. Many families would prepare a few types of candy for them to thank them for safely delivering their parcels. Since he knew that he would have deliveries within the next few days, Lin Huang had prepared the candies much earlier.\u201cThank you!\u201d The bird swept its wing over Lin Huang\u2019s palm, and the receipt and candies disappeared.It nodded to him and left.Lin Huang then moved the items into the house, closed the door and started examining them.\u201cIron-level sword x1\u201d\u201cBasic military survival sword x1\u201d\u201cBasic military water bottle x1\u201d\u201cArmored bullet (for GrayEagle17) x10\u201d\u201c500 bullets in 10 boxes\u201d\u201cWaterproof rain gear x1\u201d\u201cNight-vision glasses x1\u201d\u201cBinoculars x1\u201d\u201cHemostatic agent x2\u201d\u201cBandage x1\u201d\u2026He spent 80% of his savings to purchase all the items.The sword alone cost him 10,000 credit points. The water bottle was made from a monster called a space gerbil. To be exact, it was made from its stomach as it had a space compression feature like no other. It could contain up to one ton of liquid and cost 8,000 credit points. The armor-piercing bullets cost 1,000 credit points every two bullets, a box of them cost him 5,000 credit points. The rest was a total of 2,000 credit points.It was the first time Lin Huang had ever spent so many credit points in one go. He thought they were worth it as the items might prove useful during the Reserve Hunter assessment.The syllabus of the assessment varied each time but the last one would always be a survival test in the wilderness. The items were meant for that task.\u201cI\u2019m impressed! The service was so quick. I just ordered them yesterday and they\u2019ve arrived today. I was just thinking if I should change the delivery address as we might be staying somewhere else during the renovations to repair the damage, but that\u2019s not necessary anymore,\u201d he said. After that, Lin Huang kept everything in his space storage unit.The application for the assessment could be done on the Hunter Association website via the Heart Network. While preparing for the assessment, he would have to participate at a medium foothold. There would be one assessment at each medium foothold every month. The nearest medium foothold would be foothold No.7C87, where the actual assessment would take place a week later. It would only take him two hours to arrive at the foothold if he flew with an eagle. That way, he would have ample time to prepare himself for the challenges ahead.Just when Lin Huang was thinking about what else he should prepare, someone knocked at the door.He was surprised! Who could it be this early, he thought. He opened the door and there stood a middle-aged man in a suit and a troop of men in their uniforms were in formation behind him.The man in the suit shook Lin Huang\u2019s hand with a smile, and said, \u201cMr. Lin Huang, we have received a renovation notice from the Union Government yesterday so we\u2019re here to renovate your house. Let me know if there are any comments you would like to add to the renovation order, and we\u2019ll start immediately.\u201d\u201cI have no comments to add to the order. Just as long as the cracks and marks on the floor and walls are all sealed and covered properly, I\u2019ll be content,\u201d Lin Huang replied, still a little taken back at the events that were transpiring. He did not expect them to operate at such a high rate of efficiency. He had just received a notification from the Union that the review was passed that morning and the very same day, their people were here.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll do our best!\u201d The man smiled and nodded while he gave Lin Huang a card. It was a hotel room keycard. He then continued, \u201cThe renovations will take around five days. It would not be more than five days, I assure you, so we have booked you into a hotel for the next five nights.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Huang took the keycard and was stunned when he saw the name of the hotel.The word \u2018Stable\u2019 was written on the keycard, it was a keycard to the Stable Residence, the most prestigious hotel in the foothold! A standard room cost more than 1,000 credit points per night, which was almost the price of a room at bigger hotels in the larger footholds. He thought it was an unusual arrangement by the Union Government, but he did not think too much about it.\u201cWe will be operating out of your house for the next few days. If there are deliveries, we will forward them to the hotel. If there\u2019s anything valuable, you can take your time and bring them with you now. Let me know when you are ready.\u201d The man in suit informed him.\u201cValuable? There\u2019s nothing really,\u201d Lin Huang said and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll just grab some toiletries for myself and my sister, and you can come in,\u201d he continued, as he stepped aside to allow the men in.\u201cNo it\u2019s alright, we will come in when you\u2019re done.\u201d The man in the suit insisted and stood by the door.Since the man insisted, Lin Huang shrugged and went upstairs to get their toiletries. After making sure there was nothing left behind, he went down to the ground floor and proceeded to the door.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s all yours now, I\u2019ll be leaving to the hotel then,\u201d Lin Huang said. He then passed a note to the man in the suit, and whispered, \u201cThis is the password for the main door. The room doors are all opened. The room keys are in the medicine box in the second floor\u2019s bathroom, help yourself if you need them.\u201d He trusted the man in the suit but did not want his troop going about the place unattended.The man in the suit took the note, nodded, and assured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will get things done to the best of our abilities.\u201dWulin Town was a small town, with only four main streets. Lin Huang and his sister lived on Street 101. When the foothold was first built, people were hoping that the foothold would be expanded to more than 100 streets and became a B-grade large foothold, hence the reason they optimistically started their numbering at 101.After walking for 10 minutes, Lin Huang arrived at the Stable Residence. He was glad to see the open yard at the entrance that was embellished with oriental charm.He stood at the entrance and took a picture of the hotel. He then sent it to Lin Xin with a text, \u201cThe renovations on our house has started. We will be staying here for the next five days. I\u2019m in Room 302. Come here after school.\u201d\u201cBrother, is this a prank?\u201d Lin Xin replied immediately.Lin Xin was familiar with the hotel\u2019s location as her route to school was not far away from the hotel.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSometimes she even came to the hotel gardens just to take photos of the flowers.She had always wanted to see how the rooms in the Stable Residence looked like, so she thought it was a prank by Lin Huang when he texted her.Lin Huang did not explain anything. Instead, he sent her an image of the keycard\u2019s front and back to prove his statement.What Lin Huang did not notice was, as he was stepped into the hotel, there was someone watching him with a twinkle in his eye.\u201cHehe, here comes an interesting fella\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he met the owner, he then realized that the owner was far from what he imagined.The owner was an ordinary middle-aged man, who was short and plump. He was bald and look like a simpleton. It was hard to guess his age as he looked like he could have been in his 40\u2019s or even his 60\u2019s. He had fair skin that was marked with very few wrinkles from stress and age.He dressed very casually, with a bright, yellow short sleeve shirt that was one size too big for his body. He looked like he was wearing a short gown and beneath it was a large pair of blue pants that dangled a little below his knees. It looked like it too was one size too big.\u201cHello there, are you the guest who is checking into Room 302 today?\u201d The bald man who stood behind the counter said with a pleasant smile. His teeth were slightly showing, and they were clean and neat.\u201cYes, you must be the owner of this hotel, are you?\u201d Lin Huang took out the keycard for his registration and complimented, \u201cYour yard is magnificent!\u201d\u201cThanks. It\u2019s just a hobby of mine. I just fool around with the designs,\u201d the owner humbly said.Lin Huang was surprised to hear that. He thought they hired a designer to decorate the yard, but instead, it was done by this man who looked messy, at best.\u201cDear sir, your room is on the right-hand side, on the third floor. Walk all the way straight and you would arrive at your room.\u201d The man returned the keycard to Lin Huang and pointed to the stairs on the right side of the lobby.\u201cOh yeah, the guest in Room 301, across your room has a bad habit. He trains with his sword in the yard at dawn. I would like to apologize if he makes too much noise.\u201d\u201cAlright, noted.\u201d Lin Huang did not think about it any further and walked upstairs.The stairs were made of mahogany. It was a spiral staircase where the right handle and railings were carved with very detailed patterns. The patterns were mainly rattan with leaves and flowers of a variety of sizes. They seemed very real from afar.There were slight creaks when Lin Huang stepped onto the stairs. He went all the way up to the third floor, following the directions the owner had given him. He turned right and walked all the way straight to his room.Shortly after, he arrived outside Room 302. He could not help but look at Room 301 as he was curious as to what kind of person stayed in there. Awhile later, he smiled to himself and shook his head, \u201cWhy would I care what others are doing. My priority should be preparing for the Reserve Hunter assessment!\u201dHe then slotted the keycard into the door of Room 302 and opened the door. He was stunned when he saw his room. \u201cThe Union Government surely provides great welfare,\u201d he thought.It was a luxurious suite. The living room alone was about 100 square meters large. There was a chandelier in the middle of the living room. Apart from the light bulbs, the rest of the feature was made of pure gold. It was gorgeous, and it looked really expensive.The style of the room was luxurious but low-key. Apart from the chandelier, the rest of the decorations were not flamboyantly constructed. Even the carpet was sewn with gold thread at the edges. If one did not look closely, they might think it was just a pattern made of solid golden strings.\u201cThis owner is so rich, even the carpet has gold edges\u2026\u201d Lin Huang exclaimed as he squatted down to take a closer look. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s real gold!\u201d he said upon closer examination.In the world today, gold was also a rare metal mainly used for luxury decorations. It was expensive and cost 300 credit points per gram. The carpet was made of some unknown monster\u2019s skin and the gold edges of the carpet alone might have cost 100,000 credit points.Lin Huang then looked at the chandelier above him, \u201cIs this lamp made of genuine gold too? If it is, it might cost more than 10 million credit points\u2026.\u201d he concluded.He took a good look at the entire room and sighed in awe. He could now indulge in this luxury hotel. \u201cNo wonder it cost more than 1,000 credit points to stay a night in the cheapest room in this hotel,\u201d he thought.The suite consisted of two rooms and one living room. Not only was the living room spacious, the size of the other rooms were not small either. There were two bathrooms in each room.Lin Huang chose to sleep in the bigger room on the left which had the amazing view of the yard right under the balcony outside.He pulled the curtain aside and pushed open the windows. There was a set of tables and chairs made of rattan with a hanging rattan bed on the side.Lin Huang walked to the corner of the balcony and looked beyond the railing. He could see the entire yard. From this angle, the garden was even more stunning.\u201cWhen I\u2019m rich, I\u2019m getting a house with a yard and am surely going to get the owner to design it for me,\u201d Lin Huang smiled and thought to himself.While Lin Huang rested on the hanging bed in the afternoon, Lin Xin who had just finished school, ran straight to the Stable Residence.She could not wait to see how the hotel room looked like.But, when she reached, she did not dare step into the hotel when she arrived at the entrance.She then used her Emperor\u2019s Heart ring to call Lin Huang. He picked up immediately and said, \u201cAre you done with school?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m at the hotel\u2019s entrance\u2026\u201d Lin Xin said softly.\u201cCome in, Room 302.\u201d Lin Huang got off the hanging bed, stood on the balcony and waved to Lin Xin.Seeing Lin Huang wave at her, Lin Xin finally believed that it was not a prank that Lin Huang was trying to pull on her. She waved at him and stepped in through the hotel gates.Passing through the yard, she arrived at the hotel\u2019s reception. Seeing the owner looking at her, she explained immediately,\u201dI\u2019m here with my brother. His name is Lin Huang.\u201d\u201cOh, the boy that I met just now. He\u2019s in Room 302, it\u2019s on the right-hand side of the third floor,\u201d The hotel owner nodded to her.\u201cThank you,\u201d Lin Xin said, stuck out her tongue and went up the stairs.When she arrived at the room, and the door was opened. Lin Xin looked at the room number so that she did not mistake it for another room.\u201c302, this should be it.\u201dAfter confirming it, she walked into the room.\u201cWow!\u201d She was impressed by the room\u2019s decoration.\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Lin Huang walked to her with a glass of juice.\u201cYes!\u201d Lin Xin nodded her head hard and looked at the juice in doubt. \u201cDo we have to pay for the juice?\u201d she questioned.\u201cNo, everything is included. Even the food and drinks in the room are free, I\u2019ve confirmed the fact with the hotel owner just now,\u201d Lin Huang smiled while he explained.Lin Xin then took the juice in relief. Her eyes brighten up after she took a sip. She then finished the juice in a few gulps and said, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious, brother, what is this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, the hotel owner said he made these drinks on his own. Its called calming tea. The main ingredient was from the juice of a monster plant\u2019s root. I think it\u2019s really nice too.\u201d Lin Huang had had a couple a glasses just that day. He was never a fan of sweet stuff but that drink was irresistible.\u201cThe food here is delicious too. Are you hungry? If you are, let\u2019s go for dinner now.\u201d Lin Huang had his lunch at the hotel earlier, that was how he knew that their food was so delicious.Lin Xin was not hungry before Lin Huang asked but now, she was so excited when she heard Lin Huang describe the scrumptious meals they served.They then went to the restaurant on the second floor.There were already a couple of guests at the restaurant when they arrived. Most of them seemed like hunters. They must have been part of the team that joined the hunt for the monsters the day before.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was a buffet dinner. All the dishes were served on small plates. The both of them were not really sure what most of the utensils and dishes were, but they were delighted as the dishes were warm like they had just come out of the oven.The both of them got themselves a small table and took plates of dishes to the table. Then they started to dig in.There were not many people in the restaurant. Most of them were chatting among themselves, while Lin Xin and Lin Huang were engrossed in the food.Suddenly, all the chatter stopped and the restaurant went completely quiet.Seeing everybody looking at the door, Lin Huang and Lin Xiang looked towards the same direction too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked like he was about two meters tall. He was also bald like the owner of the hotel. His face was littered with stubble, and there was a long scar that stretched from the left side of his forehead all the way across the middle of his left eye to his chin. There was no white in his left eye too. It was a scar from a cut and his left eye was blinded. The scar and eye added ferocity to his face.With his height and his face, he gave the people around him a chill down their spines.When the tall man entered the restaurant, he stared at everyone. The people put their heads down immediately to avoid his gaze. Even Lin Huang avoided making eye contact with him. Lin Huang then patted Lin Xin\u2019s back to get her to finish her food a little faster.Surprisingly, after getting himself a meal from the buffet, the man walked towards Lin Huang and Lin Xin. He then sat down alone at the table behind them. The seat that he sat on was directly across from Lin Huang.Lin Huang looked up and they accidentally locked eyes. But, neither of them looked away. Instead, they were checking each other out.Lin Huang then thought the man was very strange to have chosen him. Among the 10 people in the restaurant, Lin Xin excluded, he was sure that he was the weakest and the poorest one. There was no reason for the man to even notice him.\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m the new face here that he has never seen before,\u201d Lin Huang concluded.Just when they both stood up after they finished their dinner, the man behind Lin Xin put down his cutlery and walked towards them.Lin Huang pretended he did not see him and pulled Lin Xin along while they quickly walked out of the restaurant.When they arrived on the third floor, the man was there too. When they turned right, the man followed.\u201cWhy are you following us?\u201d Lin Huang frowned and turned around to question the man while Lin Xin was at his back.\u201cIt\u2019s the way to my room,\u201d the man said and glared at Lin Huang. He then walked passed them and continued on to the end of the corridor. He then stopped in front of Room 301 and went in.Lin Huang was embarrassed. He went back to their room together with Lin Xin.\u201cBrother, that uncle looked so scary,\u201d Lin Xin said after the door was closed.\u201cWhen I saw him running towards us just now, I thought he was a bad guy.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. In broad daylight, even if he was a bad guy, we don\u2019t have to be scared. Besides, there are so many hunters in this hotel, what is there to be afraid of?\u201d he said, hoping to calm her down. Lin Huang recalled the owner had told him that the guest in Room 301 was a strange man who did sword training in the garden in the middle of the night.\u201cHe\u2019s really strange!\u201d Lin Huang thought to himself.After dinner, Lin Huang stayed up watching old clips of the previous Reserve Hunter assessments. The Hunter Association would never release any complete assessment videos, only some outstanding takes. It was meant to be an advertisement to attract more people to apply for the assessment.Of course, Lin Huang was not there to look at the action. All he wanted was the related content linked to the assessment or the head examiner\u2019s way of thinking which might be helpful for the assessment.He watched more than 20 videos and read some documents. Soon, it was midnight.Lin Xin went to bed after brushing her teeth. Lin Huang stood up and stretched his body, shut down the Heart Network and went to shower before bed.Minutes after he went to bed, Lin Huang heard someone closing a door in the corridor.He looked at the clock projected from his ring. It was 12 a.m.Lin Huang hesitated. He then sat up and pushed open the door to the balcony. He went to the balcony with his pajamas and looked to the garden beneath him.There were two lamps near the entrance of the garden which lit up the entire garden.Noises of bugs chirping came out of the bushes all around.Soon, the scar-faced man walked out of the hotel door.He walked to the grassy area on the left side of the garden with a black sword in his hand.Lin Huang had no idea of the price range of a sword like that. Oddly enough, his concern was for the grass that the man stepped on.\u201cDoes the fella destroy the grass every day, leaving the owner to fix it?\u201dThe man closed his eyes and stood where he was. Suddenly, he raised the sword in hisright hand and swung it in a slanted way.Lin Huang was stunned. What he lacked right now was a powerful attack skill. He then kept his eyes locked on every move the man made.There were 18 styles to his technique. From what he performed, the technique seemed incredibly vicious. He did not notice that Lin Huang was watching in secret. He practiced three sets of the same technique, sheathed his sword, and then returned to the hotel.After memorizing the technique, Lin Huang practiced it with his bare hand. It was very unsatisfying. He then brought up his sword from the storage space and practiced for real.He had a really good memory and managed to repeat the 18 styles that were practiced by the man earlier perfectly.As he focused all his attention on practicing, he did not notice that the grass the man stepped on did not leave any trails at all.When Lin Huang was on the fifth set of training, he heard a notification jingle and a semitransparent box appeared in front of him.\u201cCongratulations, you have gained a Skill Card \u2018The Great Sword Scripture\u2019 piece x1\u201dLin Huang was excited when he saw the notification. It motivated him to practice even more.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how many pieces I have to collect to combine them into a Skill Card. But, I don\u2019t care, I will practice a few hundred times tonight. I\u2019m sure by then I will have a complete Skill Card!\u201dHowever, nothing was rewarded after he practiced three more times.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be rewarded once every five practice sets?\u201dHe then practiced another two times, but still, there was nothing.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Lin Huang thought it was strange. \u201cCould this have nothing to do with the amount of practice? Then what could it be?\u201d he wondered.With the doubt in mind, Lin Huang proceeded to practice until it was his eighth time. Suddenly, the notification box popped up again.\u201cCongratulations, you have gained a Skill Card \u2018The Great Sword Scripture\u2019 pieces x1\u201d\u201cI got another one. Could this be random?\u201d Lin Huang could not help but ask Xiao Hei, \u201cXiao Hei, do the skill pieces come randomly?\u201d\u201cNo, only when the effect of the skill exceeds 80% of the skill itself, that would be considered an effective practice set. For effective practice sets, you would be awarded skill pieces each time. Repetition would not get you more skill pieces unless the effect is 100%. Then you would get the skill pieces with proper repetition.The reply given by Xiao Hei was a great help to Lin Huang.\u201cThat\u2019s it! That means the times when I did not get the skill pieces were due to my performance being less than the basic standard of 80% and I achieved the standard on the fifth practice. However, I did not get anything later on as I repeated the same standard for the next five times,\u201d he concluded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNow that he understood, Lin Huang became serious about his practices. He practiced all he could while recalling what he saw the man do in the garden. He wanted to get as many skill pieces as he could until he achieved the 100% skill effectiveness.He practiced over and over again.When dawn broke the next morning, Lin Huang had practiced for more than 100 times.He then went back to his room, exhausted.However, his chances of achieving the pieces were only at 20% and he only managed to get 21 pieces by the end of the day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not even notice Lin Xin leaving in the morning.He only woke up when Lin Xin came back from school. He then went for lunch with her on the second floor.At the restaurant, they bumped into the scar-faced man who stayed in Room 301. Lin Huang gave him a big smile while the scar-faced man nodded at him, expressionless.At night, Lin Xin went to bed and Lin Huang started to practice his sword skills on the balcony without waiting for the scar-faced man to appear. Just when he was on his third set, he saw the man practicing in the garden on ground floor.This time, Lin Huang did not blink his eyes while he watched the man practice his three sets. He got a clearer look at each of the step to perfect his technique.After the man went back to the hotel, Lin Huang started to practice according to what he just saw.That night, he practiced for more than 100 times and obtained 36 Skill Card pieces.Added to the Skill Card pieces he had gotten from the night before, he had a total of 57 of them.Unfortunately, that was still insufficient to form one Skill Card.On the third day, Lin Huang slept until the time Lin Xin came back from school in the afternoon.\u201cBrother, are you suffering from insomnia these past few nights?\u201d Lin Xin asked in concern.\u201cYea, a little bit,\u201d Lin Huang agreed to what Lin Xin said so that he did not have to explain the real reason to her.\u201cThen you should sleep more during the day, I will bring dinner to you later,\u201d Lin Xin seemed happy she could do something for her brother.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ve had enough sleep, let\u2019s go eat together,\u201d he said. It was heartwarming to hear Lin Xin\u2019s offer, but he did not want to trouble her.\u201cOh yea, brother, the hotel owner told me that there was a delivery from our house. I have brought it here,\u201d Lin Xin said while taking out the delivered box from her space storage.\u201cDelivery? I didn\u2019t buy anything recently..\u201d Lin Huang said while he looked at the box. It was a package from Division7 of the Hunter Association. He suddenly recalled that it might be the reward for killing the vampire the other day.\u201cI wonder what reward the Hunter Association gives to people for killing a bronze-level vampire?\u201d Lin Huang thought as he opened the box in anticipation.It was a black suitcase with an envelope attached to it.A four-digit code was required to open the suitcase. He tore open the envelope and took out the letter inside it.As he suspected, it was a thank-you note from the Hunter Association for killing the vampire. At the end of the note, it listed down the reward as well as the code to open the suitcase.Lin Huang exclaimed, \u201cThe Hunter Association is so generous!\u201dThe code was 7101, and Lin Huang inserted the code immediately. An identity verification page popped up. Lin Huang scanned his Emperor\u2019s Heart ring to verify access.The suitcase then clicked open, and the items in it were overwhelming to him.\u201cIs that a gun?\u201d Lin Xin asked.\u201cYes. It\u2019s a BlackEagle33, the latest Iron-level gun from the Eagle Company. It can be converted into a pistol or sniper. It\u2019s the best iron-level gun on the market. The price is even higher than some of the Bronze-level firearms,\u201d Lin Huang said as he took a good look at the black gun.The rugged look of this gun was nothing less of a marvel, and it was much better than the Gray Eagle17 that he owned. The entire gun was made of black metal with silver stripes. It looked really cool.After a good look at it, Lin Huang put it back into the suitcase.A firearm needed Life Power to be effective, especially guns. Sufficient Life Power had to be inserted into the bore of the gun to create energy bullets.He had to put the BlackEagle33 aside as he did not have enough Life Power until he was a Bronze-level.\u201cWhen I\u2019m a Bronze-level, with this BlackEagle33 for long-distance attacks and Blood Power for close-ranged attacks, my power would be increased,\u201d Lin Huang said. He was imagining the thought in his head. Although he was not ambitious, he knew his tactics very well.\u201cBut now, my priority would be combining the Skill Card pieces into a \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 Skill Card before the Reserve Hunter assessment. At least I can fight for myself instead of completely relying on the vampire.\u201dAfter dinner with Lin Xin, Lin Huang had a cup of calming tea in his room.He then moved the carpet, table, and chairs aside and started to practice with his sword bare-footedAlthough the balcony where he used to practice was more than two meters wide, it was still too small for him. Thus, he chose to practice in the living room instead.He moved the furniture aside so that he would not damage any of them as he knew he could not afford to replace them.Lin Xin was curious as to what he was doing but seeing him in the zone like that, she did not bother him and went back to her room to do her homework.Perhaps the living room was more spacious as Lin Huang felt the practice was smoother than before and the chances of him obtaining the Skill Card pieces were rising.He practiced until dawn for more than 100 times. His performance had greatly improved, and each practice was 60% better and he obtained 68 pieces in one night.He thought it was strange as the increased probability was unusual. On the first day, he did not even hit 20%. What was even stranger was he was not tired at all from practicing all night.At the condition his body was in for the past two days, he should be sleepy and exhausted after practice. He would fall right into a deep sleep on his bed. Yet, not only was he not tired, he did not feel like sleeping at all.\u201cIt feels like I took ecstasy pills\u2026\u201d he mumbled to himself. He then thought about his diet as compared to the first day he arrived. He found the difference almost instantly. \u201cCan it be the calming tea?\u201d But I had it a few days ago, there was no effect of excitement and I slept very well that night\u2026\u201d he wondered.Just then, he poured himself another cup of calming tea.While the sweet tea was flowing down his throat, he felt energized again,\u201dI think it\u2019s really the effect of this tea!\u201d he concluded.Suddenly, he heard the door across his hotel room close. He then went to the balcony immediately to peek at the the scar-faced man\u2019s practice. This time, he memorized everything the old man did.After the man was done with his three sets of practice, Lin Huang practiced again in the living room by reenacting what he saw.Until 7 a.m., Lin Huang had again practiced for more than 100 times. There was an increase in his probability of more than 80%. He had obtained 88 pieces that night.Lin Xin woke up and saw him practicing in the living room. She thought he had just woke up, so without thinking much, she headed out to school.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter breakfast, Lin Huang was still not sleepy. He felt refreshed and his body was not tired at all.He had another calming tea and continued practicing again. He wanted to know if he could increase his probability even more.From 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., Lin Huang had practiced for more than 100 times.When he obtained his 87th piece, he heard a notification.\u201cYou have accumulated a total of 300 \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 pieces.

Integrate it now!\u201d Lin Huang agreed immediately after he received the notification.Soon, a green crystal card appeared on his Life Wheel. He retrieved the card just by visualizing it.The card was completely green. There was a strong man, standing against a harsh barren land, with a sword in his hand on the top of the card. It gave off the image that he was fighting to overcome a horrible beast in the desert on his own.Lin Huang stared at the image for a while before flipping it over to look at the description.\u201cSkill Card\u201d\u201cName of Skill: Great Sword Scripture (Broken)\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cType of Skill: Sword\u201d\u201cSkill Level: Gold-rank\u201d\u201cStatus: Available\u201d\u201cRemarks: This skill belongs to special skill without a rank limit, the power changes according to its host.\u201d\u201cCard remarks: Passable\u201d\u201cXiao Hei, it says here that the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 is Rare.

The complete Skill Card is an Epic ranked card. Now that you only have part 1 of the card, the Skill Card remains broken, that\u2019s why it is Rare.\u201dLin Huang was stunned at Xiao Hei\u2019s explanation. He did not expect the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 that he had secretly learned to be an Epic skill!He then crushed the card in his hand and it turned into a green energy that flowed into his body.There were changes to his Exclusive Card.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Great Sword Scripture (Sword skill)\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1\u201d\u201cRemark: You are still so weak!\u201d\u201cAlthough this \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 skill is so precious, the scar-faced man did not stop me from learning it. With his abilities, it is impossible he did not notice that I was learning it in my room,\u201d Lin Huang thought.There were two possibilities. Maybe he did not think the boy was able to grasp the skill, or he did it on purpose so that he could teach the skill to more people and share the knowledge with an interested \u2018spy\u2019.\u201cNo matter what, I have to thank him in person. Maybe I can even ask him politely if he could teach me the second part. Hehe\u2026\u201d While Lin Huang was dreaming about how impressive he would be at the Reserve Hunter assessment when he got the complete \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019, Lin Xin came back from school.\u201cBrother, are you thinking about food? You\u2019re drooling.\u201d Lin Xin said as soon as she saw his day-dreaming face when she entered the room.\u201cYes! When we\u2019re rich, I will hire a cook from the Stable Residence to make good food for us every day!\u201d Lin Huang said.\u201cPlease do!\u201d Lin Xin was excited to hear Lin Huang\u2019s nonsense as she had really grown to love the food at the hotel.Lin Huang was relieved that Lin Xin believed his nonsense.After dinner, Lin Huang asked Lin Xin to go back to the room without him while he rang Room301\u2019s doorbell.the scar-faced man had a regular schedule for his meals and he was always at the restaurant at 6 p.m., finishing around 6.15 p.m. While for Lin Huang and Lin Xin, their timing was not fixed, so sometimes they ate earlier and sometimes, later. When they just arrived at the restaurant, the scar-faced man had finished eating so he should be back in his room right now.Soon, the door swung open. the scar-faced man looked at Lin Huang without expression, and said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\u201cThank you so much for teaching me the sword skill!\u201d Lin Huang said sincerely while looking into his eyes. He then bowed low with respect to him.the scar-faced man remained expressionless. \u201cI knew you were secretly learning. I did not teach you anything, whatever you have mastered, that\u2019s your own effort. It\u2019s none of my business,\u201d the scar-faced man answered, with what seemed like a chuckle.\u201cNo matter what, I want to thank you,\u201d Lin Huang insisted and stood in the doorway with a sincere smile on his face. To him, it did not matter if the man accepted his gratitude as long as he said what he had to say.However, looking at the man\u2019s cold reaction, Lin Huang gave up his thought of asking him about part 2 of the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 and went back to his room.\u201cI should ask him about part 2 after I have completed the Reserve Hunter assessment.\u201dNot long after he got back to his room, Lin Huang\u2019s ring vibrated. A stranger was asking to talk to him.In doubt, Lin Huang picked up the call. It was someone familiar.\u201cMr. Lin Huang, we have finished the renovations on your house. You can come back anytime you want to take a look. If there\u2019s anything you\u2019re not satisfied with, please contact me, and we will sort it out for you,\u201d the voice on the phone said. Lin Huang recognized the voice to be the leader in the suit that he met a few days back.\u201cSure, I will be back tomorrow at noon. I will return the room keycard to the hotel owner,\u201d Lin Huang agreed and nodded.After he hung up, Lin Xin walked out of her room,\u201dBrother, do we have to leave tomorrow?\u201d she asked with a look of disappointment on her face.\u201cYes, our home is done so there\u2019s no need to stay at the hotel anymore,\u201d Lin Huang answered.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Lin Xin sounded reluctant. She loved the food and drinks at the Stable Residence.Lin Huang noticed her reaction and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then we shall stay for another day since we do have five days here. We can still stay here tomorrow and go back home the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not reluctant, but\u2026\u201d Lin Xin did not want to admit her reluctance.\u201cIt\u2019s me who is reluctant then.\u201d Lin Huang shook his head and smiled,\u201dIt\u2019s set, we shall leave at noon the day after tomorrow.\u201dThe days passed so quickly. Lin Huang continued to watch the scar-faced man when he practiced but no matter how much he practiced, he did not get any more Skill Card pieces.Therefore, he did not spend too much time practicing. Instead, he decided to get more rest before the assessment.On the morning of the sixth day, after breakfast, Lin Huang and Lin Xin returned to their hotel room and rearranged the carpet and furniture to where they had been before. They then bid farewell to the hotel owner.Boss Yu smiled while watching them leave. Suddenly, the scar-faced man appeared behind him.\u201cSir, I still don\u2019t understand what you see in that kid. He was just lucky that he killed the vampire. Moreover, looking at his broken Life Wheel, he looks like he only has two months left,\u201d he grumbled.\u201cGu Yi, you have known me for so long. Since when did I, Yu Qin misjudge a result?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 never,\u201d he admitted. the scar-faced man was stunned and shook his head. He seemed unsettled, \u201cBut sir, you are a unique person. You\u2019d never bother about anything that\u2019s from this world. Why would you want me to teach him the sword skill?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have my plans. You have spoken to him, what do you think?\u201d Boss Yu asked.\u201cHis attitude isn\u2019t bad, but he\u2019s not a genius. He\u2019s far from the Li Lang we met a few days back,\u201d Gu Yi said and shook his head while giving his comment.\u201cReally? Let me ask you, how long did you take to learn part 1 of the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 seems easy but in reality, it contains a massive amount of meaning to a swordsman. I practice more than 18 hours every day and I took 103 days to learn part 1,\u201d Gu Yi answered, a serious look on his face when he thought of the topic.\u201cAs talented as you are, it took you 103 days to learn part 1. How long do you think he would need to learn that?\u201d Boss Yu looked at Gu Yi with raised eyebrows.\u201cI think he would need at least two to three years,\u201d he mumbled. It was obvious that Gu Yi did not have faith in Lin Huang.\u201cI\u2019ve told you that you\u2019re underestimating him. He only took three days to learn part 1 of the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019,\u201d Boss Yu said and pointed three fingers in the air as Gu Yi\u2019s mouth fell open in disbelief.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA video of Lin Huang practicing in his room for the past few days appeared in front of them.Gu Yi was shocked when he saw the footage, and said, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\u201cNothing is impossible,\u201d Yu Qin answered and waved his hand to dismiss the video.\u201cTake two days, and clean up. We should leave soon.\u201dGu Yi nodded without asking any further questions. He just sighed and said, \u201cAlright\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, as soon as they walked up to the entrance of their house, they were stunned speechless at the sight they saw.\u201cBrother, is this our house?\u201d Lin Xin said as she pulled Lin Huang\u2019s sleeve unsure of the reality that stood before them.Lin Huang too, was dumbfounded by the house that greeted them as it was completely different compared to their original home.From it being a small, double-story bungalow, it was now a three-story luxury villa. There was even a half covered, open-air garden on the top floor now, with a variety of flowers that cascaded over the balcony.Looking at the house number which was still the No.23, Lin Huang confirmed that the new house was in fact, their home. They could not recognize their own house after the major renovations.They keyed in their password at the door and entered the house.Most of the original structure in the house remained the same, but the rest of the place was completely different.The original terrazzo floor now had a wooden finish which seemed very expensive.The hanging lamp on the ceiling was now a luxurious chandelier.The cabinets in the kitchen were brand new, with new sets of matching utensils already arranged systematically, in each drawer.There was a carpet that seemed to be made of monster leather that they had never seen before.Even the couch, chairs and dining table were new. The toilet bowls in the bathrooms had been changed too.Furthermore, the surprises continued as they ascended to the second floor. Their room which was meant for two people was now a single room. It was more than twice the original size and the balcony was three times bigger.The third floor that was added had been designed as a bedroom, with a huge bed and a bathroom.Above the third floor was the half covered open-air garden they had seen from the entrance.Not only were there flowers, there was also a complete set of outdoor furniture which consisted of a patio umbrella, a rattan table, and chairs, as well as a hammock.Lin Huang knew very well that such renovations would have cost more than the price of two or even three houses combined. Now that he thought about it, it was really strange. He then called the middle-aged man on the phone to get to the bottom of this.Soon the man picked up his call and laughed, \u201cMr. Lin, are you happy with the renovations?\u201d\u201cIn this foothold, we were not the only ones that had a monster invade and destroy our property and possessions. I\u2019ve seen the renovations on the other houses and none of them were as privileged as our house. Not only were we given new sets of furniture, we even have an extra floor! This is ridiculous. Who are you really? What is your intention?\u201d Lin Huang asked, his mind buzzing with the thought that this case was not that simple.\u201cOf course, you are Sir Li\u2019s friend, we would have to do our best for you,\u201d the middle-aged man answered, not at all minding and revealing the fact that he knew about Li Lang.\u201cSir Li? Lin Huang was stunned. \u201cBy that, do you mean Li Lang?\u201d He continued.\u201cYes, that\u2019s Sir Li. He was the one who submitted your damage report. It was important to our superior, which is why when we were told to complete this task properly, we spared no effort and expense,\u201d the man explained.\u201cWhat kind of status does Li Lang hold exactly?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? His father is one of the vice presidents of Division7 of the Hunter Association, while his mother is the councilwoman of the Union Government of Division7,\u201d the man\u2019s said, another shocking revelation to Lin Huang that day.The man\u2019s superior thought that Lin Huang was Li Lang\u2019s friend and through this \u2018act of kindness\u2019, they wanted to bridge the gap between them for the benefit of their relationship. What they did not know was, Lin Huang and Li Lang had just met once before, and there was no friendship between the two of them.Of course, Lin Huang did not tell him that or else he might have to pay for the renovations which he most definitely could not afford.He hung up the phone and cleared his mind of all thoughts about the renovations. After settling into their new house, he started to prepare for the Reserve Hunter assessment.That day was a school holiday for Lin Xin. After having lunch together, Lin Huang dropped by the Credit Bureau and traded the Life Crystals given to him by Li Lang earlier for 100,000 credit points.He then credited 20,000 credit points to Lin Xin and said, \u201cThe Reserve Hunter assessment will take about 10 to 15 days. Please take good care of yourself and spend the money if you need to. When I become a hunter, there will be more opportunities for me to make more than enough money for the both of us.\u201d\u201cYes, brother. You will surely pass the assessment!\u201d Lin Xin cheered. She had a lot of faith in Lin Huang.Next, they arrived at the Eagle Station. Lin Huang patted Lin Xin\u2019s head as they said their goodbyes. He then paid for and rode off on an eagle that he picked from the station stables.Lin Xin watched Lin Huang take off and stayed until he was high up in the clouds. She then turned around and left the station.On the eagle, Lin Huang was amazed at the variety of monsters in the world he lived in.This eagle had four limbs from the feline family, where its claws could extend as it wished.Its ability to jump and run was stunning too.Apart from its limbs, the rest of its body was the same as a raptor.It had the face of an eagle and a pair of wings that were eight meters wide.Such a creature did not only have the advantages of a superior body structure, it also had full control of the wind, which made it one the fastest moving monsters among the rest.A few centuries ago, they were major headaches to humans in the lower monster class.Whenever they headed out, they traveled in large packs. With their agility and powerful attacks, they easily destroyed some of the footholds.Fortunately, humans adapted to the eagle\u2019s combat style and the tables were turned on the monsters.Once that happened, ever since a few hundred years back, the eagles were captured and tamed by humans and had become one of the most common forms of transportation in the world these days.The eagle that Lin Huang rode on was not the largest one but it had the best feathers.The feathers on its abdomen were of a slight golden colored tone. In comparison to the other birds, it was unusually good-looking and also seemed like it was well fed.The normal flying speed of an eagle was 700 kilometers per hour. At full speed, its agility would multiply! However, it would only fly at full speed when it was running for its life.Under such flying speeds and conditions, it would have been torture for the eagle to withstand that speed along with a human on it\u2019s back. Therefore, there was special defense equipment installed on the saddle pad which would become a transparent defense shield which protected the rider in case of an emergency.The eagle took less than two hours to fly from No.7D101 to No.7C87.Lin Huang got out of the Eagle Station, opened the map in his ring and walked towards the Hunter Association division.Not long after, he arrived at the division. There were already so many people waiting around, it looked a massive crowd waiting for a rock concert to start at the entrance of the building!C-grade footholds belonged to the medium foothold category where the population was a few million people. Perhaps there were tens of thousands of hunters around. Placing the hunters from the smaller footholds nearby, who were there to submit their missions, along with the ordinary people hustling about their day, the traffic in the area would have naturally been hectic.After quite a struggle, Lin Huang walked into the entrance of the division. Just when he entered, a young lady approached him.The lady looked like she was in her 20s. She was dressed in the Hunter Association uniform. She greeted him with a wide smile, and said, \u201cHi sir, how may I help you today?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here for the Reserve Hunter assessment,\u201d Lin Huang answered.\u201cAlright, please follow me,\u201d The lady smiled at Lin Huang again, and brought him to a meeting room. She then gestured, \u201cYou may go in.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Huang nodded and pushed open the door.He was stunned as there were more than 100 people in the meeting room.\u201cSo many people have registered today? Looking at the amount of people in attendance, it looks like there might be more than a thousand people by tomorrow,\u201d Lin Huang wondered while he found himself a seat at the back.Soon there were more people coming into the room. A fatty sat on his left with a vacant seat between them.The fatty was very friendly. He then whispered to Lin Huang with a smile,\u201dIt\u2019s awesome that you could pass the preliminary round when you\u2019re not even iron-level, bro. Did you take a shortcut somewhere to get here?\u201d\u201cPassed the preliminary round? Do you mean all of you have already registered?\u201d Lin Huang looked at the fatty in disbelief.\u201cOf course, or else how would we know that we have to be here today at 4 p.m. for the assessment content and rules from the examiner?\u201dThe fatty thought the question Lin Huang asked was strange. He then looked at him with suspicion in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re here without a registration?\u201d he asked.\u201cErm\u2026\u201d Before Lin Huang could even answer him, a lady in her heels walked up to the podium.The noisy meeting room suddenly fell silent as everyone\u2019s attention was stolen by the woman on the stage.It was a lady with a strong aura about her. She had a ponytail with a short skirt that showed her long legs beautifully. She wore a pair of black stilettos that was nearly 20 centimeters high.She was tall herself, at at least 1.7 meters, and with that pair of heels, she was almost two meters tall, and everyone in the meeting room was beneath her in comparison.Although, what was most attractive about her was not her height, but her breasts that were hidden in her buttoned-up white shirt. Her breasts were not showing at all, but the jiggling they had when she walked was sufficient to seduce all the men in the meeting room.This lady could have been described as a bombshell.\u201cWitch Yi Yeyu lives up to her reputation\u2026\u201d The fatty said, slurping up drool as he spoke.Looking at his behavior, Lin Huang sat quietly, inching more to his right to avoid any spit-fire from the fatty.The lady looked over the crowd and stopped when her eyes landed on Lin Huang as he was the only one in the room who was not even an iron-level applicant. She did not say anything, but instead, went on to introduce herself.\u201cHi, I am Yi Yeyu, the main examiner of your assessment. In this assessment, there are 133 people who have passed the preliminary rounds. Now, the time that I had set, which was 4 p.m. in the afternoon has arrived, there are now 127 people here. The six people who are not here have been eliminated from the assessment,\u201d she said in a loud, stern voice.\u201cI will be telling you the rules of the assessment tomorrow. I will only say it once so please pay attention. Also, when I\u2019m speaking, please keep quiet. If you have any questions, you can ask after I have finished speaking,\u201d she said.\u201cTomorrow at 8 a.m., all of you will gather here in this meeting room. Those who are late will be eliminated. You are not allowed to bring any equipment that is more than iron-level, no drugs and no other prohibited items in your storage space. Before the assessment starts, all the prohibited items will be temporarily confiscated by my authorities. If there\u2019s anything valuable which you do not trust us to keep an eye on, please keep them with someone else until you leave later on,\u201d she continued.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe concrete content of the assessment won\u2019t be revealed at this moment. After everyone is gathered tomorrow, I will reveal that,\u201d she said to the anxious hall of eyes that stared at her. The messages from Yi Yeyu was short and sweet. After she was done, she looked at the crowd again and asked, \u201cIf you have any doubts, you can ask now.\u201dEveryone in the room looked around at each other. None of them dared to say anything. At the back of the meeting room, a hand rose up slowly and\u2026 It was Lin Huang.\u201cWhat questions do you have? Do tell me,\u201d Yi Yeyu asked Lin Huang with her chin up ready for his question.\u201cErm\u2026 I haven\u2019t registered myself yet. Is it too late to register now?\u201d Lin Huang asked from the back of the room.Over 100 people who were present in the room frowned when they heard what Lin Huang said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just a preliminary screening of sorts to avoid too many participants in the Assessment stage.Since Lin Huang was already in the meeting room, to Yi Yeyu, his presence did not make a difference to the assessment. From the way he looked, she thought he would definitely be eliminated during the assessment anyway for his abilities were not going to save him. So, to avoid embarrassing him, she let his registration mess-up slide.Lin Huang did not even have the opportunity to show Yi Yeyu that he was an Imperial Censor and before he knew it, the registration was completed.\u201cBro, you\u2019re so lucky! When you raised up your hand and said you haven\u2019t registered, I thought the f*cking witch would throw you out,\u201d the fatty laughed and got even friendlier than before as he shook Lin Huang\u2019s hand. He then said, \u201cLet\u2019s get to know each other. I\u2019m Yin Hangyi, what about you?\u201d\u201cLin Huang, pleased to meet you,\u201d Lin Huang replied, as he could not avoid the guy\u2019s friendliness and he did not seem skeptical to it anyhow, so he shook his hand.\u201cYou\u2019re not even iron-level and you\u2019re here for the assessment. Such audacity!\u201d Yin Hangyi patted Lin Huang\u2019s shoulder.\u201cJust trying my luck. Maybe I\u2019ll pass, you never know,\u201d Lin Huang answered with a smiled. He had no plans of revealing his identity as an Imperial Censor to the guy, of all people, so he kept quiet about it.After chatting for awhile, Lin Huang said goodbye to Yin Hangyi. If he did not leave, he might have had to talk to the fatty forever.After dinner, Lin Huang took a stroll at the night market to calm his thoughts. Then he went back to the hotel and slept early in preparation for the day to come.The next morning, he went to the meeting room right after breakfast. The head examiner Yi Yeyu seemed to despise people who were late, so he did not want to lose his eligibility to the assessment because of tardiness.As it turned out, the strict warning had everyone else on edge too. Nobody was late on the second day. The 127 people who joined the meeting on the first day were all there before 7:50 a.m.At exactly 8 a.m., the Head Examiner Yi Yeyu arrived. This time, she wore a pair of long, black pants and a short sleeve white shirt. Her style was a little different from the first day but no matter how hard she tried to cover up her voluptuous body, her curves could still be seen.All the male members present were young and horny at the sight of her. Most of their eyes followed her movements, but they did not focus on her face. Instead, their stares were centered on her breasts.Yi Yeyu walked to the podium, looked at the crowd and started to speak.\u201cEverybody is here. That\u2019s great! Now I will talk about the syllabus of the assessment today,\u201d she started.\u201cThe theme of the assessment is \u2013 Survival. As a professional hunter, we will always encounter horrible environments and powerful monsters. Thus, survival is a topic that all professional hunters should master. One who does not master this will surely die tragically in the end,\u201d she warned.\u201cThe location of assessment is a wilderness 330 kilometers away from the foothold No.7C87 \u2013 Pure Gold Desert. The objective of the assessment is simple. All you guys have to do is enter Door A to the Pure Gold Desert, walk across the desert that is 1,500 kilometers long and within 15 days, you must arrive at foothold No.7D121 or be eliminated,\u201d she said. As Yi Yeyu spoke, she projected a 3D map showing the location of the starting and ending points.\u201cYou are not allowed to bring food and water during this assessment. You would have to obtain them in the desert,\u201d she continued.Everyone was stunned at what she said at the end. Even Lin Huang was upset. He had prepared a ton of water and snacks yesterday for the assessment.\u201cLater, each and every one of you will be given an emergency communication device once we have inspected your storage spaces. If any of you cannot handle the challenge, press the rescue button to give up the assessment and you will be saved, and subsequently eliminated. Of course, if you\u2019re not able to arrive at your destination foothold No.7D121 within 15 days, that will be considered as failing the assessment,\u201d she explained.\u201cThat\u2019s all for the assessment briefing. If you have any questions, please ask now.\u201d Yi Yeyu asked with a sinister grin on her lips.\u201cMiss examiner, looking at the terrain of the 3D map that you showed us, our destination No.7D121 isn\u2019t connected directly to the Pure Gold Desert. Instead, it\u2019s blocked. That means, the area of the assessment isn\u2019t only a desert, but it will also include climbing the mountain. Am I right?\u201d A man in glasses asked.\u201cYou\u2019re very observant, yes, climbing the mountain is part of the challenge and you have to do it with your bare hands. The equipment for climbing in your storage space will be confiscated later,\u201d Yi Yeyu said, as her smile widened at the thought.The crowd groaned again. Yin Hangyi who sat next to Lin Huang was getting more and more upset.\u201cDo they plan to fail each and every one of us?\u201d The fatty mumbled.\u201cAre there any more questions?\u201d Yi Yeyu asked. She seemed to be satisfied with the briefing of the assessment that she had presented.\u201cMiss examiner, I\u2019ve done some research on the mountains. It\u2019s called the Snowy Goddess Mountain, located right behind foothold No.7D121. It\u2019s a level-2 wild zone. Based on records of the area, bronze-level monsters have been sighted there. In such a wild zone, isn\u2019t it unsafe to carry out the assessment\u2026 there?\u201d A voice at the back of the room asked. As it turned out, it was Lin Huang who asked the question.Everyone was shocked when they heard the fact.Yi Yeyu was stunned. She frowned and said, \u201cThe entire zone of the mountain is in fact, a level-2 wild zone. However, there\u2019s one mountain around there that\u2019s without bronze-level monsters. So that place is considered a level-1 wild zone. All of you should climb that mountain instead. I\u2019ll get someone to mark it down on the trail,\u201d she answered.As it seemed, she had intentionally left out the information to increase the difficulty of the assessment and decrease the passing rate. She did not expect Lin Huang to point it out, but now she had to mark the safer trail for everyone to use. If she did not do that and insisted everyone to take the assessment as it was, the results of the assessment would be invalid if an incident was brought up to the management of the Hunter Association. A level-2 wild zone was prohibited as an assessment field.\u201cAre there any more questions? Please do not hesitate to ask. If not, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d Just when Yi Yeyu was done speaking, a few of them raised their hands but their questions were irrelevant.Meanwhile, Lin Huang was scratching his head thinking about the difficult situations within the assessment.\u201cThe lack of food and water would be the biggest issue. As we go, we still have look for a source of water. Moreover, in the desert, there are many deadly monsters that we should be aware of. Above all, people are the most dangerous beings that we should watch out for. There will be many of them who will try to steal our food and water. By my calculations, the 1,500-kilometer desert trail can be completed in 13 days. Climbing with your bare hands would take more than a day, I might need to reserve two days for that\u2026\u201d Lin Huang said, in discussion with Yin Hangyi.\u201cIt\u2019s now 8:20 a.m. Let me bring you to the assessment point,\u201d Yi Yeyu said and waved into the air. Suddenly, a green wooden door appeared. She then pushed open the door.\u201cPlease queue up. After you passed through the door, please wait and don\u2019t move around the place!\u201d she warned.\u201cOoo! A Dimensional Relic!\u201d the fatty Yin Hangyi exclaimed when he saw the door.\u201cWhat\u2019s a relic?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re so ignorant. A relic is an extremely rare treasure that surpasses gold-ranked equipment. If one has killed a transcendant monster, there\u2019s a possibility that they would get it. A Dimensional Relic\u2019s rarity is even more valuable than some weapon relics. It seems like this witch isn\u2019t just a hot simpleton after all,\u201d Yin Hangyi explained in all seriousness.Lin Huang became even more curious about the world he knew. The rank after gold-ranked equipment is transcendant? He was impressed at the thought of it. How powerful can the strongest combat rank be?More and more people passed through the door. Soon the queue got shorter and it was finally Lin Huang and the fatty\u2019s turn to enter.As he stepped into the door, he felt a slight dizziness and in the blink of an eye, he was in a desert.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d Lin Huang exclaimed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Aside from healing-related medication, all medicines including septic divisor that have poisonous effects on the human body are prohibited as well. Equipment that has been poisoned must be cleaned. Those who refused to clean them will have your equipment confiscated,\u201d she continued.\u201cAlso, all food and water are prohibited. Climbing equipment is prohibited too\u2026\u201dYi Yequ announced loudly while walking back and forth in front of everyone.Soon, the 12 staff members had done their job.Most of the things that were confiscated were food and water. Some of them brought bronze-level equipment and some of the weapons were soaked in septic divisor. They were asked to clean their weapons on the spot.The same happened to Lin Huang when they checked his storage space. His food and water were confiscated. The military water bottle that he bought was almost taken away too but he poured out all the water in front of the staff before they did.They found Lin Huang\u2019s armored bullets too. The staff confirmed the item with Yi Yeyu before returning the bullets to him.Yi Yeyu thought it would not make a difference if he had them or not since the bullets were meant for normal guns. Even at a short-distance, the impact would hardly be of any significance against bronze-level weapons. Moreover, there were only 10 bullets, so the bullets were returned to him.When the staff returned the bullets, Lin Huang was relieved as it was one of the few ways he had to protect himself.When the inspection was completed, it was already past 9 a.m.After all the staff had confirmed that nothing had been missed out, a communication device was given to every one of them.Yi Yeyu then spoke again, \u201cThe stuff that was confiscated will be kept safely with our authorities. When the assessment is over, we will return them to you.\u201d\u201cThe time is now 9:23 a.m., I\u2019m giving you guys an extra seven minutes. Those of you who arrive at the destination within 15 days before 9:30 a.m. will pass the assessment.\u201d\u201cBefore the assessment officially begins, I have some bad news for the lot of you. During the assessment, the internet connection, communication and map positioning guidance functions on your Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring will not be available. The only thing that you can use will be the storage system,\u201d Yi Yeyu said, with a hearty laugh once she finished. Her breasts jiggled vigorously, distracting the participants for a few moments, before drawing them back to the harsh truth she had revealed.What Yi Yeyu said caused the crowd to groan again. Even Lin Huang did not expect her to be that sneaky.On the other hand, Yi Yeyu as the head examiner seemed to enjoy the torture she inflicted. With a grin, she said, \u201cNow, let the assessment, BEGIN!\u201d she shouted.Just when she was finished speaking, some of them ran well ahead of the rest. Those who were groaning followed too.Lin Huang who was the weakest among them all was the slowest. Instead of running like everybody else, he walked at his normal pace. The fatty greeted him and sprinted away following the people ahead.Soon, Lin Huang was left behind. However, he did not accelerate. He continued walking at his own pace, studying his surroundings as he went.Watching Lin Huang getting further and further away, the head examiner Yi Yeyu shook her head and said, \u201cI thought there was something special about that kid. It seems like he\u2019s just an ordinary person. At this speed, it would be amazing if he could walk 40 kilometers in a day. I don\u2019t think he can even finish half of the journey within the given 15 days.\u201dIn truth, it was not that he did not want to follow the other\u2019s pace as they ran off in the wilderness. The fact was that he was not able to keep up anyway.He was just an ordinary person. His physique and body structure were completely different from those who were at an iron-level.If he was to run like those fellas who were iron-level, he would collapse within half a day. The environment in the desert was so harsh, that if he pushed himself too hard, he would have to give up the assessment if he even planned on surviving it.Lin Huang had been researching the Pure Gold Desert on his Heart Network since the head examiner Yi Yeyu gave out the assessment area and content that morning. He had a plan in mind to survive the desert.Within the 15 days, he needed at least two days to climb the alps so he had 13 days to cross the 1,500 kilometers desert. That said, he needed to walk more than 115 kilometers per day. That did not include the time he spent searching for food and a source of water.Lin Huang knew very well that the desert was not a simple flatland.When he was on earth, he had traveled to a desert before. The fastest an ordinary person could walk in the desert would be four kilometers per hour. A few well trained others could walk five kilometers per hour. Moreover, he would need to rest at night.He would be pushing his limits if he was to walk 50 kilometers per day.Within 15 days, no matter how he pushed himself, he could only finish half the journey.An iron-level person had a body that was a few times stronger than ordinary people.Their strength and tolerance were better than ordinary people and they could even run up to a 100 kilometers per day. That would be impossible for Lin Huang.Therefore, he had a plan that involved monsters in the desert. Especially those that moved fast which he could use as a vehicle.With his ability to obtain Skill Card pieces and his skill of summoning monsters, he had memorized the locations of the footholds where the monsters he needed would reside.Although the accumulation of Skill Card pieces would take time, the native creatures that resided in the desert could move much faster than humans. The time that he spent on accumulating Skill Card pieces would be made up by the monsters\u2019 high-speed movements through the desert.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang\u2019s headed in a very different direction from those who were ahead of him. His goal was not the destination, but the foothold with a Sand Monster that he had seen on the map.The Sand Monster belonged to a branch of human giants. They were huge, very fat and they consumed a diet consisting of a variety of flesh and meat very regularly. They looked similar to humans as they walked with two legs. They were more like a deformed human with some of them having two or three heads and some with only one head with additional mouths or eyes.Iron-level Sand Monsters were at least five meters tall and the tallest one could be up to 10 meters. They were easily a few times stronger than iron-level humans.Lin Huang had his eye on an iron-level Sand Monster, and as they lived in groups, the monstrosity of that sort would not be hard to find. What he needed to do at the moment was accumulate a complete Monster Card from killing many monsters at once. Another reason that aided his plan was that the Sand Monster\u2019s foothold was very near the A-entrance of the Pure Gold Desert.Lin Huang followed the planned route for half a day without water. Finally, when the sky was dark, he arrived at the foothold where the Sand Monsters lurked. Lin Huang knew earlier that there was a source of water at the location, but didn\u2019t see it upon his arrival. Soon after, he thanked his lucky star when he saw a freshwater lake not far from the foothold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He took a few sips and closed the bottle, feeling energized while waiting for the night to come.The Sand Monsters had terrible vision. Their body structure allowed them to resist heat and cold so they were not afraid of the sun as well as sandstorms. Because of this, they usually hunt during the day. However, the range of their vision dropped to the extent that they could not see past 100 meters at night. Unless they were hungry, they would prefer not to hunt during the night.The sky was dark not long after Lin Huang went into hiding.It was an eerie night and there were barely any stars in the sky. It was perfect for hunting.Lin Huang ran towards the foothold where the Sand Monsters were moving at full speed. He had observed the foothold for awhile, noticing more than 30 Sand Monsters here.None of them were taller than 10 meters and they were all iron-level.The Sand Monsters intelligence was not high but perhaps they had seen the human\u2019s foothold, there were fences that surrounded it. Mimicking it, they built simple shacks for the place where they slept. With more than 30 shacks put together, the area looked like a miniature human village.Lin Huang walked around the fence, some of the Sand Monsters were sleeping and loud snores could be heard.He locked his target on one Sand Monster that was five meters tall. From the size of the Sand Monster, it seemed to be iron-level. It was playing with its toes in its own shed. It then licked its fingers after playing with its toes, Lin Huang was disgusted.He started to think that it might be a mistake to summon such an idiotic monster with his Monster Card.Time was running out, soon he forgot about what he was thinking.He picked up a stone from the ground and tossed it towards the disgusting monster through the fence.The Sand Monster was hit by the stone, it then picked up the stone in confusion and looked at the direction where the stone was tossed. He saw there was something behind the fence. Although the distance was not far, it could not see clearly through the fence.It then stood up with his three meters long bat and walked towards the fence.The Sand Monsters appetite was huge. They could usually eat a lot so they would never let go of food that was sent their way.Looking at the Sand Monster approaching him, Lin Huang let out a grin behind the fence.Soon the Sand Monster arrived at the fence, it looked down and locked eyes with Lin Huang.It was shocked and immediately, it swung its bat at Lin Huang.Lin Huang instantly ran towards the dune that was not far away.The Sand Monster destroyed the fence with its bat and chased after Lin Huang.To the Sand Monsters, human flesh was tender and delicious. It almost drooled the moment it saw Lin Huang.Seeing its food run away, it did not want to let go.Just when Lin Huang passed through the dune, the Sand Monster approached and it swung its bat towards Lin Huang.Suddenly, blood was spilled. The monster stopped moving, its head fell from its neck.Blood gushed out all over the place, the headless body fell straight behind the dune.A shadow appeared next to the Sand Monster\u2019s dead body. It was a young man with white hair, his eyes which turned red were now black.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Bai!\u201d Lin Huang gave the young man a thumbs up.Bai who was on iron-level rank-3 was near to bronze-level since his evolution the last time. Under the Blood Power boost, chopping off the monster\u2019s head was a piece of cake.\u201cDing!\u201d A notification came from Xiao Hei, a semi-transparent notification box popped out upon Lin Huang.\u201cCongratulations, you obtained a Monster Card \u2013 Sand Monster piece x1\u201dAt the same time, a huge amount of white Life Light spread out from the Sand Monster\u2019s dead body into Bai.\u201cI almost forgot, Life Light would be given when monsters kill each other.\u201d Although Lin Huang knew about this earlier, it was his first time witnessing it.In this world, the Life Light among monsters could be seized mutually where the remained Life Light of the dead monster would be transferred automatically into the monster that killed it.As the human body was unique, it would only absorb a part of Life Light from monsters automatically during the upgrade of ability.Such process was called a Life Light Baptism. Under other circumstances, unless one possessed some technique to absorb Life Light, the Life Light would fade away while nobody could obtain it.As Bai absorbed the Life Light from the dead Sand Monster, there were changes inside Lin Huang\u2019s body.The third column on the Life Wheel in his body that was dim started to shine. Soon the third column was fully lit up and the fourth one started to light up as well. The fifth one followed, and then the sixth\u2026 Until the 26th column was lightened up, the Life Light that was spreading out of the dead Sand Monster stopped. The Life Light on Bai\u2019s body faded as well and the changes in Lin Huang\u2019s body stopped soon after.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Lin Huang was shocked. He did not expect the Life Light in his body to increase out of nowhere. Within seconds, his Life Wheel increased from three columns to 28 columns.One column in Life Wheel usually represented one year of life. Since Lin Huang was born with a broken Life Wheel, the rate at which his life decays was 10 times faster than ordinary people.He was only left with three columns on his Life Wheel and the third column was already dim. He only had slightly more than two months more to live.But now, he suddenly had 28 columns on his Life Wheel.He was relieved from the fear of death. However, the good news was strange to him.\u201cXiao Hei, does the addition of my Life Light had anything to do with Bai killing the Sand Monster?\u201d Lin Huang took his guess.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhen you summon a monster from your Monster Card, your Life Wheel is synchronized with your monster. 50% of the Life Light would be absorbed into your Life Wheel when the monster is killed. If the Life Wheel of the monster you summoned is full, 100% of the Life Light would be given to you.\u201dLin Huang was relieved after he heard Xiao Hei\u2019s explanation as now he knew that there was no problem with his body.\u201cI could get more than 20 columns of Life Light from killing one Sand Monster. So if I were to kill a few more, my Life Wheel would overflow!\u201dLin Huang was excited as he thought to himself.He then went to the back of the dune and walked towards the foothold where the Sand Monsters were\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One of them was seven meters tall while the other was eight. The shorter one seemed to be an iron-level rank-2 while the taller one was most probably an iron-level rank-3.Lin Huang hesitated for a moment but he sprinted towards the direction of the two Sand Monsters.The duo who was about to fix the fence under the night sky could not see Lin Huang clearly, all they could see was that something was approaching them from afar.They opened their eyes in an attempt to try to get a better look at what was coming for them.When Lin Huang was in between the dune and the foothold, the duo could finally see him.Seeing that it was a human, they imagined how delicious he would be and they ran through the fence to chase after Lin Huang.Lin Huang turned around and ran immediately.Just when he ran through the dune, the duo was near him. They did not bring any weapons and they were trying to grab Lin Huang with their bare hands.Lin Huang got down and rolled down the dune.Blood splashed through the air. The head of the shorter Sand Monster was chopped off, its body fell straight to the ground.Bai attacked the second monster without missing.His height was the same as the Sand Monster. His Blood Power wings were his weapon, which he swung towards the taller Sand Monster.The death of the shorter monster served as a warning for the taller monster. It saw a red stroke flashing in the air so it used its hand to block the attack although he could not see what was attacking it.Usually, such a block would work seeing how tough and thick with high defense the Sand Monster\u2019s skin was but now that Bai\u2019s power was similar to a bronze-level, with the help of his Blood Power wings that were comparable to a bronze-level weapon, the Sand Monster\u2019s hands were chopped off.The attack was not as effective as Bai wanted it to be as the monster\u2019s head was still there.In immense pain, the Sand Monster let out a loud groan.Lin Huang attempted to stop Bai but it was too late.The distance between the dune and the foothold where the Sand Monsters resided was less than 10 meters. If the monster were to scream, it would definitely attract the rest of the Sand Monsters. By then, not only would the hunt fail, he might even lose his life.Suddenly, another slash flashed through the air, slicing through the Sand Monster\u2019s mouth directly to the back of its head.The pupils of the giant Sand Monsters dilated as the Blood Power saber was removed from its mouth. Without any support, its body fell onto the floor.Bai kept his Blood Power saber, the redness in his eyes faded and he returned to his innocent young look.Lin Huang was relieved, it was so close. If Bai had been a second slower, they might be dead by now.If they were to be surrounded by more than 10 iron-level Sand Monsters in such an environment, a bronze-level hunter might not be able to make it.Xiao Hei\u2019s notification popped up.\u201cCongratulations, you have obtained Monster Cards \u2013 Sand Monster pieces x 2\u201dAs the notification popped up, white Life Light spread out from the two dead bodies of the Sand Monsters into Bai\u2019s body.Lin Huang looked at the Life Wheel in his body. The columns started to light up again.This time, it increased from 28 to 85 columns straight away.Even with his accelerated decay in his lifespan which was 10 times faster than ordinary people, Lin Huang could now live for more than eight years.He calmed himself down and started to plan things out.From his experience earlier, he did not want to risk his life any further.Bai performance was beyond Lin Huang\u2019s wildest expectations. In every fight, he managed to kill every Sand Monster in a single shot before they could even make a single noise.Just like this, with Bai\u2019s help, Lin Huang killed three Sand Monsters.All the 137 white columns on his Life Wheel were now filled up, the only remaining columns being the gray ones.In this world, everyone had a Life Wheel within their bodies that had 360 light columns.However, there were two categories to the columns. The white ones were refillable with Life Light while the gray columns could not be filled with Life Light.Most people have 100 to 150 white columns which were full of Life Light when they were born. The white columns decided how long one would live.As time passed, the Life Light in the Life Wheel would disappear and every year, one column of Life Light would be taken away.The columns of Life Light that were taken away would turn into gray columns which were not refillable. That was how human lifespan decreased every year.If one was ill or born with issues in their Life Wheel, the loss of Life Light would accelerate.However, the speed of change of the column would forever be constant at one column per year.Lin Huang was one of the unlucky ones. He was born with only 152 white columns on his Life Wheel. Now that 15 years had passed, his Life Wheel should have only had 137 white columns remaining.However, since his lifespan decay was 10 times faster than ordinary people, within the 15 years, 150 columns were gone, leaving him with only two columns.It was also not feasible to convert the gray columns into white columns as the price to pay was too high.Each gray column would need 10 years of Life Light to be activated, turning them into white columns. To top it off, each gray column could only be activated once.To be able to reach iron-level, it required all the gray columns to be activated, filling up the entire life wheel with 360 white columns.The rich would need to pay an astronomical amount of money, making it impossible for the poor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne year worth of Life Crystals required 100,000 credit points and 10 years worth of Life Crystals would require one million credit points to activate a single gray column.For most people, they were born with more than 200 gray columns and the activation of those columns would require more than 200 million credit points, an astronomical amount.That was the reason why anyone who held the title of a hunter in this world was respected. Even an iron-level Reserve Hunter would be held in high respect by everyone.With all his white columns lit up, Lin Huang saw hope to achieve iron-level as he had the advantage that most people did not have \u2013 absorbing Life Light through Bai.Witnessing the shortcut to iron-level, Lin Huang\u2019s hunger to kill grew more intense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could actually integrate 30 card pieces into one iron-level rank-1 Sand Monster but he chose to put it aside.Standing outside of the foothold, Lin Huang looked at the last Sand Monster from afar.It was the biggest one in the entire foothold and it was almost 10 meters tall.From its size, Lin Huang guessed that it was near the bronze-level.It should be the leader of the foothold, it was in a deep sleep and was snoring loudly.It had no idea that the rest of its mates had all been killed.Lin Huang took out the GrayEagle17 in his space storage and put the 10 armored bullets into the bore of the gun and approached the last Sand Monster quietly.In the low growl of the wind in the desert, a stench emanated of the shacks. It was disgusting.The Sand Monsters seemed to be quite unhygienic.Lin Huang bent over and walked in small steps so he would not make any noises as he approached the leader of the Sand Monsters slowly.30 meters, 20 meters, 10 meters, 5 meters\u2026Suddenly, the Sand Monster\u2019s nose twitched. It seemed to have picked up the scent of something and opened its eyes.Lin Huang did not have the time to run away, he was seen by the leader of the Sand Monsters leader.The Sand Monster was stunned, it thought it was dreaming.Lin Huang was shocked as well but he pointed his gun at the monster as it tried to grab his gun.Suddenly, two slashes flashed through in a split second. They were like ribbons tying the Sand Monster\u2019s arms.Lin Huang saw the flashes and did not run away. Instead, he took a step towards the Sand Monster and pulled the trigger at the monster\u2019s eyes.In the dark, flares were seen as two bullets were shot into the monster\u2019s eyes.The Sand Monster let out a loud roar from the pain. When Lin Huang attacked, it managed to close its eyes but the impact of the armored bullets was too powerful at point blank.Although it did not make the Sand Monster\u2019s head explode, both its eyes were completely destroyed.The Sand Monster was badly injured from the hit, it became furious and somehow managed to break away from Bai within seconds.Lin Huang then rolled towards the left and hid in the side.The Sand Monster stood up, starting to smash everything around it as it roared.Its roar could be heard more than 10 kilometers away. The members who joined the assessment ahead of Lin Huang were just settling down, getting ready for dinner.They were terrified by the Sand Monster\u2019s roar.\u201cIt\u2019s the Sand Monster\u2019s roar, it sounded angry\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the desert, the only creature that dared to invade into the Sand Monsters\u2019 foothold was the megalodon wolf pack which also belonged to the giant family. If the megalodon wolf was not famished, they would not attack the Sand Monsters on a whim. There must be some unusual fight happening in the foothold tonight!\u201dA man in glasses who also joined the assessment explained.He seemed to know the monsters in the desert better. However, he misjudged the situation as the sound of gun faded too fast and he could not hear that as he was too far away.Within the 10 kilometer radius of the foothold, the Sand Monster seemed to be in complete madness. It swung its hands everywhere, destroying the surroundings. Meanwhile, Bai was in combat mode as his eyes turned completely red and the Blood Power on his back turned into two bloody sabers.As he avoided from being hit by the Sand Monster, he was slashing the monster with his sabers at the same time.The number of wounds on the Sand Monster increased and Bai did not even suffer a single hit.Lin Huang hid in the opposite direction, somewhere not far from them. He removed the armored bullets and reloaded his gun with regular bullets. He then went into shooting mode and he shot the Sand Monster every time he had a chance. He focused on the Sand Monster\u2019s face, including its destroyed eyes, nose, mouth, and even its ears.Although he missed most of the time, it managed to make the monster even more furious. Lin Huang did not shoot from the same direction. Every time he took a shot, he would change his position.This 10-meter-tall Sand Monster had superior abilities if it was compared to the rest. Bai managed to chop off the arms of the other monsters\u2019 easily but he failed to cut through this monster\u2019s body as its bones prevented him from doing so.Time passed by, Lin Huang and Bai were getting tired as the Sand Monster got weaker, losing blood as the fight continued.Lin Huang was amazed at how terrifying the monsters in this world were.He had fired more than 100 bullets from his GrayEagle17 at the monster\u2019s face and though he only missed a few shots, the monster was still alive.It was shocking as the GrayEagle17 was comparable to an iron-level gun. It was even more powerful than an AK47 on earth.After losing so much blood, the Sand Monster became slow. Though Bai was tired, he did not slow down but instead, he got more aggressive. However, the monster still managed to defend itself.Lin Huang was exhausted. His actions became slower but he was still opening fire at the monster\u2019s face.Under continuous attack, the monster finally fell to its injuries and though it was still alive, Lin Huang and Bai both knew that it could not last much longer.Lin Huang became more courageous and he stood in front of the Sand Monster to open fire because he could aim better at such an angle. However, just as he positioned himself and fired a few shots, the Sand Monster who was on the ground stood up and let out a roar as it ran towards Lin Huang\u2019s direction.Lin Huang did not move at all, instead, he grinned. He took out the regular bullets and reloaded his gun with armored bullets.He then aimed at the monster\u2019s wide opened mouth and shot.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThree shots were fired and three armored bullets exploded in the Sand Monster\u2019s mouth.Blood started to flow out of the monster and the monster who was initially running towards Lin Huang fell hard onto the ground.\u201cCongratulations, you obtained a complete Sand Monster Card x1!\u201d\u201cHost completed cross-ranking kill, an Advanced Card is rewarded!\u201d\u201cI have been waiting for this for way too long!\u201d Lin Huang blew at the muzzle in satisfaction before he put the GrayEagle17 into storage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The 30 Sand Monsters who were killed did not always die in one hit from Bai\u2019s attack and they had a similar reaction.The last Sand Monster remaining who happened to be their leader was killed the way Lin Huang had wanted it to happen.After the Sand Monster\u2019s leader was dead, a notification was sent by Xiao Hei.As the last monster was killed by Lin Huang himself, he was rewarded with an Advanced Card for the cross-ranking kill.Besides, he also obtained a complete Monster Card.The probability of obtaining a Monster Card right away for killing a monster was not high.Lin Huang had done his survey earlier so he was only aiming to collect all of the card pieces. He did not expect to get this lucky.However, there was a downside as well. Since the Sand Monster was killed by Lin Huang, its Life Light could not be absorbed by Bai so Lin Huang\u2019s Life Wheel did not manage to get any additional Life Light.Lin Huang then called out the Monster Card onto his hand. He was stunned, it was a green card. He looked at it closely.There was a giant Sand Monster on the front of the card. Its look was considered normal, the only thing was that it had an extra head. It did not have extra eyes and it had four limbs just like ordinary people did.It looked like an enlarged human with more fats and hair. It looked ferocious and did not have reproductive organs.He turned the card around to look at the detailed description.\u201cMonster Card\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Giant (Branch)\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Iron-level 3-star\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Immense Strength (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Robust (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 3: Iron Bones (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSummoning Limit: Activated\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: This is useless too!\u201dLin Huang then looked at the detailed description.\u201cImmense Strength (Beginner): Passive skill, strength would gain three times more.\u201d\u201cRobust (Beginner): Passive skill \u2013 Body physique improved two-fold.

No matter which one he got, it would be helpful for Lin Huang so he did not have any preference.\u201cSkill extraction has been activated\u2026 Choosing a skill for the host\u2026 Random selection is done\u2026 Congratulations, you have obtained \u2013 Robust (Beginner).\u201dWhen the skill extraction was done, Lin Huang opened up his Exclusive Card.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Great Sword Scriptures (Sword skill)\u201cSkill 3: Robust (Beginner)\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1\u201d\u201cRemark: So weak! So weak! So weak!\u201dHe was initially happy but he got slightly pissed at the last remark, \u201cWas it really necessary to repeat yourself three times? Xiao Hei, I feel that you\u2019re becoming meaner now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to repeat important stuff three times, isn\u2019t that a rule on earth?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Huang did not know what to respond.\u201cThe available number of summons is still one, does that mean I can\u2019t summon both my Monster Cards at the same time?\u201d Lin Huang questioned as he noticed that the quantity of summons remained unchanged.\u201cYes, no matter how many Monster Cards you have, you can only summon one at a time.\u201dLin Huang wanted to try anyway. Without recalling Bai, he squeezed the Sand Monster Card on his hand.The card broke into pieces and was transferred into his body. Immediately, a semi-transparent box appeared.\u201cYou have reached the summoning limit, the action is denied!\u201dHe then recalled Bai and summoned the Sand Monster card. He squeezed the card again and a gigantic Sand Monster appeared in front of him.He took a good look at the 10-meter-tall Sand Monster. He thought to himself for awhile and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to call you Tyrant.\u201dHearing what Lin Huang said, the Sand Monster raised its hands up high and let out a loud roar. It seemed to like the name given by Lin Huang very much.\u201cAlright, Tyrant, let\u2019s hunt for a mini monster nearby.\u201d Lin Had had breakfast before coming to the assessment. Now that it was late, after an entire day of walking and fighting, he was hungry and tired.Tyrant who got the instruction turned around and left immediately.Soon, it came back with a monster that looked like a wild boar. Lin Huang recognized it, it was an Armored Pig. It was double the size of a wild boar on earth, it had black, metal scales on its back.Although it was quite large in size, it did not belong to the giants. It was a mutated beast, the difference was one could tell what it was by looking at its size. No matter which rank the Armored Pig had evolved into, its size did not seem to change even when it became an adult.Lin Huang\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw the Armored Pig. He tried that when he stayed at the Stable Residence. It was delicious.Lin Huang\u2019s cooking skill was nothing fantastic. He started a fire, sliced a few pieces of meat and started to cook it.He had thought of this before coming here so he had brought condiments for barbecue along with him. Although he did not handle the fire well which caused the meat to be slightly burnt, the taste was not bad at all.He saw Tyrant who was drooling as it sat aside, Lin Huang got a few slices for it.After it was done eating, it wanted more. It looked at Lin Huang in anticipation, Lin Huang shook his head and smiled at him.\u201cIt\u2019s for you to taste. If I were to feed you until you were full, I think I might have to stay up all night to cook for you. The smell of barbecue would attract other monsters nearby. They might come soon, we need to leave now.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang then stood up. Tyrant seemed to understand what he said, it stood up as well.\u201cBring me to the East. At the speed you can move at, we should be able to cover quite a distance within two hours. With your speed, we should be able to leave this area far away in two hours. We will rest later.\u201d Lin Huang said to Tyrant.Tyrant extended its hand, Lin Huang hopped onto its palm and he was placed on its shoulder.Just as he sat down, he had a strange expression.Tyrant\u2019s shoulders were filled with long, coarse hair that felt like wild boar fur, \u201cDamn it, its hair is so hard, it\u2019s poking my butt\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tyrant sat not too far away from the entrance of the to-be tent, watching Lin Huang with a curious eye as he built the tent.20 minutes later, Lin Huang sat inside the tent he had just put up as he planned out how they would keep watch at night. The Pure Gold Desert was so much worse than any desert on earth.There might be an invasion anytime, so someone who kept an eye on the tent during the night was necessary.Lin Huang needed Tyrant as his mode of transport so it could not watch over the tent. Bai would be suitable but with the strength he had, Lin Huang did not want him to waste his strength on something like this.He soon recalled that he still had card pieces he could integrate into a single monster card. Getting out of the tent, he recalled Tyrant and called out to Xiao Hei, \u201cXiao Hei, I\u2019d like to integrate these pieces into a monster card.\u201d\u201cYou have 33 pieces of Sand Monster Cards, integrating an iron-level Sand Monster Card would require 30 pieces. Confirm integration?\u201d\u201cIntegrate!\u201d\u201c30 Sand Monster Card pieces have been integrated into one monster card!\u201dLin Huang summoned the new card to his hand. It was a pure-white card and the Sand Monster on the front of the card was 80% similar to Tyrant. It looked like a smaller version of Tyrant and the description of the card on the back was different.\u201cMonster Card\u201d\u201cRarity: Normal\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Giant (Branch)\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Iron 1-Star\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Immense Strength (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Robust (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSummoning Limit: Activated\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: Useless\u201dAnother notification was sent by Xiao Hei.Just as Lin Huang wondered what it was about, a box popped up upon him:\u201cThere are two monster cards of the same type, would you like to carry out Card Engulf?\u201d\u201cXiao Hei, what is Card Engulf?\u201d\u201cIf there are two monster cards of the same kind, the one with the rarer card can engulf the one that is a lower rarity and you\u2019ll get a random skill upgrade.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean I can use Tyrant\u2019s card to engulf this monster card and get a skill upgrade?\u201d Lin Huang finally understood the reason why the notification came up. \u201cYes. This is the first time you obtained a monster card of the same kind so a reminder popped up. Would you like to continue with Card Engulf?\u201d\u201cNot at the moment, I would need him to keep watch over the tent at night for a few days.\u201d Lin Huang decided not to go ahead with the Card Engulf.Lin Huang did not even bother to give this new Sand Monster a new name as he would use it for the Card Engulf a few days later, a name seemed unnecessary.The new Sand Monster was much smaller than Tyrant as it was just five meters tall.\u201cYou will be keeping watch outside the tent tonight. If you notice any monsters or humans, scream as loud as you can and wake me up.\u201d Lin Huang instructed.The Sand Monster nodded and sat outside the tent while Lin Huang went into the tent.He was exhausted and fell asleep straight away.The next day, he woke up from sleep and realized that it was morning. It was a peaceful night.He stood up and kept the tent. After washing up, he recalled the Sand Monster that was watching over the tent all night and summoned Tyrant.He sat on Tyrant\u2019s shoulder and frowned. He recalled the two-hour-long torture that he had yesterday and the fact that his poor butt he would have to suffer another 10 hours today.He got down from Tyrant\u2019s shoulder and got it to lie on the ground before the sand got too hot from the scorching sun.He took his sword and began shaving the hair on Tyrant\u2019s shoulders.At first, it lied down quietly as it did not know what Lin Huang was up to.Once Lin Huang began shaving it, it\u2019s expression changed. Lin Huang thought its expression was dumb but it seemed really adorable.The hair on its body was a sign of masculinity for Tyrant so naturally, it was quite unwilling when Lin Huang wanted to shave it all of. However, he could not disobey Lin Huang so all it could do was to show a sad face.After the left side of its shoulder was shaved, Lin Huang who was ready to sit on it looked at the right side of Tyrant\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIt would look better if they\u2019re symmetrical.\u201dHe then shaved the right side. After half an hour, he finally took a seat on Tyrant\u2019s shoulder to start their journey.\u201cThis is much better!\u201d Without the hair poking on his butt, Lin Huang felt infinitely more comfortable.Not long after they began their journey, Lin Huang saw traces of people who passed by the place.Just when he was about to get Tyrant to avoid the area to prevent conflicts, Tyrant\u2019s gigantic body attracted five people who promptly surrounded it.Seeing others approaching it, Tyrant was enraged at the people.\u201cTyrant, let me down.\u201d After Lin Huang\u2019s instructed it, Tyrant put him down on the ground in front of it.The five people who approached them realized that Lin Huang was sitting on Tyrant\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Lin Huang looked at the five of them with his guard up.\u201cSo, you\u2019re an Imperial Censor. It\u2019s no wonder you even dared to join this assessment even though you\u2019re not at iron-level.\u201d A tall, skinny guy who looked like he was 20 said with a cunning smile.\u201cJust say what you want. If you\u2019ve nothing to say, get out of my way.\u201d Lin Huang did not bother talking to him any further.\u201cI seem to recall your name being Lin Huang, right?\u201d A young man who looked like he was Lin Huang\u2019s age said with a smile.He dressed well and when he talked, the rest held their tongue. Although he was young, he seemed like the leader of the group.\u201cMy name is George Kang. Don\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019m harmless.\u201d\u201cThe difficulty of this assessment is high. It\u2019ll be quite hard for you pass the assessment if you\u2019re alone so we\u2019ve teamed up. You are an Imperial Censor and although you\u2019re not bad at summoning monsters, you\u2019re quite lacking in the strength department. Especially the last part of the assessment where we\u2019re required to climb the Alps. With your strength, it would be quite impossible that you could make it. Although this Sand Monster is strong, it isn\u2019t that good at climbing. If you\u2019re willing to join us, we can help you to climb the Alps.\u201d George Kang smiled as he suggested to Lin Huang.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThanks for the offer but I\u2019m a lone wolf. Now, will you step aside?\u201d Lin Huang could see that this seemingly kind George Kang was actually very sly. None of them had any good intentions.\u201cBro, you should think about it.\u201d George Kang said with a smile, he did not plan to step aside at all.\u201cNo. Now please, step aside!\u201d Lin Huang insisted.\u201cHey, how dare you! Do you really think that we care about you? All we really wanted is to use this Sand Monster to help us get to the alps. If you get what I\u2019m talking about, do as we say and just maybe, you\u2019ll reach the alps alive with us. It\u2019s either that or we\u2019ll make you do what we say.\u201d The tall, skinny guy revealed their real intentions.\u201cSo, you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re not stepping aside?\u201d Lin Huang did not even look at the tall, skinny guy. Instead, he shot a deadly glare at George Kang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You think you\u2019re better than us just because you\u2019re an imperial censor? George\u2019s family is royalty, you can\u2019t afford to offend him!\u201d The tall, skinny guy raised his voice at Lin Huang as he was ignored by him.Lin Huang frowned when he heard the guy mentioned \u2018royalty\u2019. In this world, only families that were higher than the gold-rank could be approved as royalty by the Union Government. Now he understood why this guy spoke for George Kang willingly.Meanwhile, George Kang who thought Lin Huang was strange began getting jealous of Lin Huang.\u201cWhat did he do to deserve to be an Imperial Censor? He\u2019s 15 and he isn\u2019t even iron-level, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s a poor kid without good background. What\u2019s so great about being an imperial censor, I\u2019m going to show you what I\u2019ve got today!\u201d George Kang thought to himself.\u201cBro, we would not force you to do something that you don\u2019t want to do, but your attitude is humiliating. Since my bros don\u2019t like you, there\u2019s nothing that I can do.\u201d George Kang was smart as he sensed Lin Huang was not the person that he should mess with so he tried to get away from him.Although the reason that he argued was irrelevant, at least it was not awkward. That was one of the things that he learned from his family.A normal 15-year-old would really reflect on what he just said but Lin Huang was not a kid.He knew what this guy was up to where he attempted to avoid conflicts. If a fight was to happen, no matter which side won, it would be none of his business.However, it was not a good news to Lin Huang as they were a gang.Although he was fearless, he did not want to offend the royalty for no reason.The tall and skill guy did not understand what George Kang really meant. He thought he did not want to fight Lin Huang himself and he wanted the rest of them to do it instead.He was willing to do anything for the young master of royalty.Regardless of how the results of the assessment turned out, as long as he managed to build a good relationship with royalty, he could always ask for job opportunities and work on their properties.The four of them were thinking about the same thing.George Kang took a few steps back while the four of them looked at each other.The three of them plunged towards the Sand Monster while the tall and skinny guy attacked Lin Huang.The easiest way to kill an Imperial Censor was to kill him before he summoned his monsters.Now that Lin Huang had already summoned his monster, they thought of holding down the monster and killing Lin Huang as soon as they could.Lin Huang was not iron-level so he could not see their abilities.However, seeing the tall and skinny guy leading the charge, that meant his ability should be the most powerful, possible an iron-level rank-3.Lin Huang did not hesitate, as he was stepping away fast, he held the GrayEagle17 on his hand and reloaded his remaining five armored bullets.Looking at the GrayEagle17 on Lin Huang\u2019s hand, the tall and skill guy grinned, \u201cA GrayEagle17, this weapon that isn\u2019t even considered to be an iron-level weapon could probably be a threat to people on iron-level rank-1 or 2, but I, Xue Jie am at iron-level rank-3, such a garbage of a gun can do nothing to me.\u201dSeeing Xue Jie approaching him without fear, Lin Huang aimed at his chest and pulled the trigger.\u201cBang!\u201d The explosive bang scared everyone.Xue Jie attempted to avoid the shot but it was too late, the bullet hit his right shoulder. A hole that was a size of a fist was blown into his right shoulder, so deep that his bone could be seen.Xue Jie pressed his palm against the wound, blood was flowing out. He glared at Lin Huang and poured medication on the wound.Lin Huang looked at him from far away, he did not continue to attack. Without Tyrant or Bai\u2019s help, it was difficult for him to kill Xue Jie.Xue Jie\u2019s ability was much more powerful than the weakened vampire he killed earlier. His mind was not controlled by hunger. Moreover, Lin Huang was only left with four armored bullets, they were for emergency use only and he did not want to waste the bullets.It was just a minor fight between them, they had not reached the point where they had to kill each other.Seeing Lin Huang\u2019s attack, George Kang\u2019s expression changed. He thought his hunch was right, \u201cThis guy is dangerous!\u201dHe could also see that Lin Huang showed mercy. If he was to aim his gun at Xue Jie\u2019s head instead of chest, he would have been dead by now.Just when George Kang gave all his attention on Lin Huang, he heard a devastating groan not far away.The three guys who attempted to attack Tyrant were punched by it. Nobody knew if they were still alive.After settling the three of them, Tyrant ran towards Lin Huang and attempted to grab Xue Jie.Xue Jie saw what was happening and was terrified as he attempted to escape with his injured shoulder. As he ran, he screamed for help, \u201cGeorge, help me!\u201dGeorge Kang was in a pickle. Although he did not want to be involved in this, he could not let Xue Jie die here.If Xue Jie was dead, he would be alone and who knew if Lin Huang would kill him as well.He used his right hand and waved in the air, the black ring on his middle finger became a giant shield in front of Xue Jie.\u201cBang!\u201dTyrant\u2019s giant claw landed on the giant shield and a spiderweb crack appeared on the shield.George Kang was shocked. He did not expect the Sand Monster\u2019s hit to create such cracks on his iron-level equipment.He did not know that this Sand Monster\u2019s strength was near a bronze-level monster.George Kang then called out to Lin Huang, \u201cLin Huang bro, please stop the violence, we can talk this out!\u201d\u201cTyrant!\u201d Lin Huang then stopped Tyrant from attacking Xue Jie.Tyrant was getting in the zone, it then stopped and looked at Lin Huang in confusion.\u201cStop for now.\u201d After Lin Huang gave out his instruction, he looked at George Kang and Xue Jie, \u201cI need a proper explanation.\u201dThe duo was relieved when they saw Lin Huang asking Tyrant to stop.George Kang said loudly to Lin Huang from far away, \u201cLin Huang bro, it\u2019s our fault. We should not put you in trouble, we would like to apologize.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGeorge, this kid would not dare to kill us. Killing is prohibited in the assessment. If we were to die in the assessment, not only he would lose his eligibility, he would also be blacklisted by the Hunter Association and prohibited from all forms of hunter assessment. You are a member of royalty. If you die in the assessment, the Hunter Association would definitely investigate the matter. Killing a member of royalty is considered a very serious matter to the Union Government\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d George Kang stopped Xue Jie from talking. He could not believe that Xue Jie was still picking a fight with Lin Huang, \u201cLin Huang bro, all my weapons that were over iron-level were taken away. The most valuable thing I have with me is this black armor.\u201dGeorge Kang then took off the black ring on his left ring finger and tossed on the ground in front of Tyrant, \u201cPlease take this as our apology, I hope we can forget about what happen today and be friends.\u201dLin Huang kept quiet for a moment and said, \u201cI accept your apology. You can take the three guys who are lying there\u2026\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s not allowed to leave.\u201d Lin Huang pointed at Xue Jie who was behind George Kang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that would be the end of the incident since George Kang had apologized and gave Lin Huang a gift. He did not expect Lin Huang to come after him.\u201cLin Huang, what do you want from me?\u201d Xue Jie did not think that he could defeat Tyrant. Moreover, Lin Huang was good in attacking from a distance. If they were to fight, he would definitely lose.\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d Lin Huang squinted while he looked at Xue Jie, \u201cIt was you who picked a fight with me and it was you who attacked me! Do you really think that I\u2019d let you go just like?\u201d\u201cXue Jie, it was our fault. You should apologize. Lin Huang bro, please let us know how we could remedy you, let\u2019s not fight.\u201d George Kang did not leave without Xue Jie, instead, he turned around and looked at Lin Huang.\u201cLin Huang bro, I know you\u2019re mad. It makes sense that you are angry as Xue Jie is a loudmouth. Let us know what kind of compensation we can give!\u201dLin Huang was amazed at how smart this George Kang as he seemed like a prudent person. He would become someone remarkable in the future.\u201cSince you have offered, I shall not embarrass you. I only have two requests. Firstly, I want a sincere apology from Xue Jie! Secondly, I want every equipment that he has on him as well as all the things that\u2019s in his storage!\u201d\u201cLin Huang, don\u2019t you dare push it!\u201d Xue Jie was furious.\u201cShut up, Xue Jie!\u201d George Kang yelled at Xue Jie.\u201cGeorge Kang, now I finally understand why your family isn\u2019t fond of you, you\u2019re a bastard! Not only did you not help me but you\u2019re helping an outsider? I wouldn\u2019t want to have a cousin like you!\u201dWhat Xue Jie said upset George Kang. Lin Huang finally understood why George Kang did not choose to leave earlier and helped Xue Jie instead.\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot, I\u2019m helping you to get out of the situation!\u201d George Kang yelled back at Xue Jie.\u201cI don\u2019t need you, go away!\u201d Xue Jie spat on the ground.\u201cLin Huang bro, I could give you all the iron-level equipment that I have with me, as well as the things that I have in my storage. I will bring him away and guarantee that we will not give you trouble anymore!\u201d George Kang suggested.\u201cGeorge, this has nothing to do with you. This is my business with him, I\u2019ll settle with him! If you can\u2019t stand to watch, please leave.\u201d Lin Huang rejected George Kang\u2019s offer.\u201cTyrant, attack!\u201dHearing Lin Huang\u2019s instruction, Tyrant who was giddy stood up and ran towards Xue Jie.George Kang did not leave but he took a few steps back away from Tyrant and Xue Jie while he watched quietly.The GrayEagle17 remained on Lin Huang\u2019s hand, it was pointing at George Kang.Meanwhile, although Xue Jie\u2019s ability was not that weak, his right shoulder was injured, leaving him with only his left arm.His speed seemed to be affected by the pain. With his fear of Tyrant after he saw his attack earlier, he was not even able to use 70% of his strength.Soon, Tyrant was near him.It then punched the iron-level long knife that Xue Jie had on his arm and a crack was heard.There was blood on Tyrant\u2019s fist but a strong impact was felt on Xue Jie\u2019s left hand.He was pushed back from the bunch and the long knife fell from his grip.That hit fractured Xue Jie\u2019s left hand. George Kang, who was watching from afar, was terrified. He did not have any hope left in Xue Jie in this battle.Xue Jie was an expert in using knives and now that both his hands were useless, he did not have any moves anymore.Standing before a Sand Monster who was near a bronze-level, he was like a helpless toy to it.Seeing that he had lost his power, Tyrant got even more excited, it then humiliated him like a cat toying with a mouse.After clumsy attempts of trying to dodge Tyrant\u2019s attacks, Xue Jie was tired. Noticing that its prey was exhausted, Tyrant grinned and grabbed his arm.Xue Jie struggled hard, but it was useless. He felt like his body was going to be crushed.Watching that, George Kang hesitated and said,\u201d Lin Huang bro, please spare his life for me. Take this instead. You can ask for three favors from our family in the future.\u201dGeorge Kang then took out a token from his space storage.Lin Huang looked at him, although he did not know what that token was about, he got Tyrant to stop, \u201cTyrant, put him down.\u201dXue Jie was on the brink of death as he lay on the ground motionless. In Tyrant\u2019s arm, all the bones in his body were destroyed.Lin Huang walked towards him, \u201cApologize or die!\u201d\u201cLin Huang, I know that you don\u2019t have the guts to kill me.\u201d Xue Jie smiled.\u201cI don\u2019t know where you get that confidence.\u201d Lin Huang bent down and shook his head with a smile, \u201cTo the Hunter Association, you\u2019re just an ordinary person who is not even a Reserve Hunter while I\u2019m an imperial censor. Do you think the Hunter Association would disqualify me just because I killed you? Even if I did kill you and I\u2019m disqualified, with my status of being an Imperial Censor, it\u2019s not difficult to join other organizations.\u201d\u201cRegarding your relationship with royalty, you\u2019re not even an important family member. If you\u2019re dead, do you really think George\u2019s family would avenge you? An Imperial Censor is protected by many, do you really think George\u2019s family would offend the Hunter Association for your sake?\u201d\u201cLet me tell you a secret\u2026\u201d Lin Huang leaned in close to Xue Jie\u2019s ear, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not even an iron-level, I\u2019m able to summon not one monster, but three. There\u2019ll be more in the future.\u201dXue Jie\u2019s pupils shrunk. Although he did not know much about an Imperial Censor, he knew that most of them would only blossom after they became an iron-level. Those who could summon monsters before reaching iron-level were considered to be geniuses. Those who could summon three monsters before reaching iron-level on the other hand, would be considered god-like.Even without the assessment, this fella would be a catch for all.If he and George Kang were to be killed, the Hunter Association might have buried the incident.\u201cAlright, now that you know my secret, bring it along when you leave this world.\u201d After whispering into Xue Jie\u2019s ear, Lin Huang stood up and pointed his GrayEagle17 at Xue Jie\u2019s forehead and slid it toward his left eye.\u201cThe bullet would pass from your eyeball to your brain and explode, it won\u2019t be painful.\u201d\u201cWait, please don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019m begging you!\u201d Xue Jie felt the threat of death, something he had never felt before and begged for mercy.George Kang was amazed. He did not know what Lin Huang said to Xue Jie to terrify him like that.\u201cNow that you know my secret, I can\u2019t let you live.\u201d Lin Huang grinned while he placed his finger on the trigger.\u201cI swear I will not reveal your secret to anyone! If I do, I curse that I will be stuck on iron-level forever!\u201d Xue Jie said immediately, \u201c\u2026And I\u2019m sorry for what happened earlier. It was my fault, I will give you anything!\u201dLin Huang seemed like he was hesitating but he was enjoying it.Although Xue Jie had a bad mouth, Lin Huang never planned to kill him.He just wanted to show this to George Kang as a warning since the rich were scared of those who do not care to lose their lives.Lin Huang intentionally showed him his crazy side so George Kang would give up trying to take revenge on him. He knew very well that people from royalty would definitely seek revenge.\u201cI have four iron-level equipment that I can give to you! As for the stuff in my storage, please help yourself!\u201d Xue Jie gave up, Lin Huang could finally end his drama.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLin Huang bro, if you think that the stuff that my cousin offered is insufficient, please take mine as well.\u201d George Kang walked towards him and said. He was terrified by Lin Huang\u2019s actions and was afraid that he might really kill his cousin.\u201cAlright. George, since he had already apologized, I shall not embarrass you.\u201d Lin Huang then took his gun away from Xue Jie\u2019s head and stood up.After taking a few of his iron-level equipment, Lin Huang searched through his storage. Apart from the iron-level armor that was given by George Kang, he did not take any of his stuff. He even rejected the token that he offered.,George Kang pressed the emergency button for Xue Jie and the rest of his team. He then left, alone.Lin Huang grinned while he watched him leave, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Xue Jie to conform to me. This \u2018kill to warn\u2019 technique was a success. Looking at George Kang who couldn\u2019t wait to leave me alone, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever look for trouble with me ever again. It seems that I\u2019ve avoided the aftermath.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The remaining two were diving and investigation equipment. Lin Huang did not exactly know what they were.The five equipment were deactivated and he could not activate them at the current level of his abilities.Apart from the equipment, Lin Huang took all the Life Crystals in Xue Jie\u2019s storage.There was a total of 30 years worth of Life Crystals which could be traded for more than three million credit points. It was a fortune for Lin Huang.The rest of Xue Jie\u2019s properties seemed useless so Lin Huang did not bother to take them with him.His storage was not that big anyway, it was only the size of one square. He planned to spend some of his credit points to expand the storage in his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring after the assessment ended.He then sat on Tyrant\u2019s shoulder and instructed it to go on a route that was slightly different from George Kang. They both headed to the east.Though he was not afraid to fight someone, it would be quite troublesome for him.The incident with George Kang took more than half an hour. If he was to encounter a few similar incidents in a day, he would be spending most of his time on battles instead of proceeding with his journey.Less than 20 minutes after they ran towards the east, there was a sandstorm in the desert. Although it was not intense, Lin Huang had to get Tyrant to go at a slower pace while he used his shirt to cover his mouth and nose.Within a few minutes, Lin Huang saw someone in the sandstorm not far away.The person seemed plump, he was having difficulty walking with his short legs.\u201cWhy does this person look so familiar?\u201d Lin Huang felt he had seen this person before.Tyrant ran towards the person in excitement. It was its instinct to go after a prey which could be its food.\u201cTyrant, don\u2019t bother him. Let\u2019s just pass him by.\u201d Lin Huang instructed.Tyrant, who was excited was calm again and gave up on running after the person.Yin Hangyi who was struggling in the desert heard something coming up behind him.He turned around and saw a Sand Monster coming for him, he also saw a person sitting on top of the Sand Monster\u2019s left shoulder.Just when he was wondering what he was seeing, the Sand Monster walked past him and proceeded to run ahead.Yin Hangyi was not shocked. Instead, he thought the guy who sat on the Sand Monster\u2019s shoulder looked familiar.The guy covered his mouth and nose. The only thing he could see on his face was his eyes.He tried to recall where he had seen the person before.Awhile later, he mumbled to himself, \u201cThat pair of eyes looked like Lin Huang\u2019s. Could it really be Lin Huang?\u201dHe then waved to the Sand Monster that had yet to run too far away and yelled, \u201cLin Huang, wait for me! Lin Huang, I am Yin Hangyi.\u201dHearing someone calling his name behind him, Lin Huang turned around to look. He could tell indistinctly who the person was.Lin Huang frowned as the fatty was over-friendly and talkative.If he was to walk with him, he would have to listen to him talking all day.But the fatty was deviating from the correct route. If the sandstorm did not stop, his direction would deviate even more and cause him to fail.He shook his head and smiled. Lin Huang decided to get the Sand Monster to stop.Yin Hangyi saw that the Sand Monster stopped, he ran fast to it. Lin Huang slid down from the Sand Monster\u2019s arm and Yin Hangyi let out an awkward smile as he said in relief, \u201cAhh, bro, finally I bump into my family! I thought I\u2019d really die in this desert if I didn\u2019t bump into you.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you follow the rest? How did you deviate from the route?\u201d Lin Huang ignored his friendliness and asked in curiosity.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it. There was a sandstorm not long after we fell asleep in our tents. All of them ran away. I was lucky to find somewhere to hide for the night, I couldn\u2019t tell which direction I was at when I woke up in the morning.\u201d Looking at the fatty\u2019s face, Lin Huang felt he was telling the truth.\u201cBro, I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re an Imperial Censor. It\u2019s so cool that you have this Sand Monster as your vehicle!\u201d The fatty gave a pitiful look, \u201cCould you bring me along? You wouldn\u2019t want your bro to die in this shitty place right?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t die, you can always press the emergency button.\u201d Lin Huang responded seriously.\u201cI can\u2019t do that. If I did, doesn\u2019t that mean I gave up on the assessment?\u201d\u201cIs the assessment more important than your life?\u201d Lin Huang raised his eyebrow.\u201cOf course the assessment is more important!\u201d The fatty said confidently.Seeing that the fatty insisted, there was nothing that Lin Huang could do.\u201cI can bring you, but I have a request.\u201d Lin Huang raised his finger in all seriousness.\u201cSure! I will do anything, as long as it isn\u2019t having sex with you! I\u2019m still a virgin, I must save my virginity for my future wife!\u201d The fatty said seriously.\u201cDamn you! Look at the fats on you, it\u2019s disgusting!\u201d Lin Huang gave him a kick.\u201cWhat do you know? I\u2019m voluptuous, girls love me, I\u2019m very huggable!\u201d The fatty avoided Lin Huang\u2019s kick while explaining.\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t be messing with you anymore. I\u2019m short of time. My condition is simple, when I ask you to shut up, shut up.\u201d Lin Huang could not stand the fatty\u2019s exuberance. If he did not set this condition as a ground rule, he might be annoyed to death.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, what gives you the right not to let me talk?\u201d The fatty was annoyed. Even with the Sand Monster, the journey would take at least three days. He would die if he was not allowed to talk.\u201cNevermind then.\u201dLin Huang turned around and left but the fatty grabbed his arm, \u201cAlright, I give up. I\u2019ll promise you that okay?\u201d\u201cSo, from now onwards\u2026\u201d Lin Huang turned around and gestured to zip his mouth.The fatty was confused, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cThat means shut up!\u201d Lin Huang forgot that this was not Earth, it was normal for the fatty not to know what the gesture meant.The fatty covered his mouth and waved at Lin Huang.\u201cOkay Tyrant, put him on your right shoulder.\u201d Tyrant was not as gentle as it was with Lin Huang when it comes to the fatty. It picked the fatty up by holding the fatty\u2019s belt from the back.Meanwhile, it was much gentle to Lin Huang where it placed its palm on the ground, allowing him to step on its palm and placed him on its shoulder.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLooking at the different treatment, the fatty yelled at Lin Huang, \u201cI would like to protest the difference in treatment, I deserve equality\u2026\u201dLin Huang gestured to get him to shut up again.The fatty realized that he asked for a favor. He then covered his mouth and sat down quietly.After Lin Huang sat down, he patted the Sand Monster, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe Sand Monster stood up and walked toward the east in big steps\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They could survive even longer than camels could on Earth in the desert.When there was a lot of food, they would eat everything they could to store a massive amount of fat in their bodies. Without food and water, they could break down their bodily fats for energy and water.Sand Monsters that had sufficient fats could live at least half a year without water. Without food, they could live at least three years.Their skin was thick and tough enough to defend themselves from sandstorms, even their eyes and faces had a unique structure of three layers so that they would not be affected by a sandstorm.Due to their unique body structure, they became the top predators in the desert.The Sand Monsters had big feet that were more than two times the size of human feet.That made them move faster and have more agility than the rest of the giants.Tyrant\u2019s body size was more than five times bigger than a human but his speed was not five times the speed of a human. Instead, it was 20 times faster than a human.For a human that was an iron-level rank-3, the most one could travel in the desert was 20 kilometers per hour on average.While for Tyrant, at its normal running speed, it could travel more than 80 kilometers per hour and at full speed, it could travel more than 100 kilometers per hour.As Lin Huang was sitting on Tyrant\u2019s shoulder, he controlled its speed to the normal 80 kilometers to avoid himself from falling down. On the first night, they managed to use only two hours to travel a distance that usually took a full day for ordinary people.With the Sand Monster\u2019s strength, the additional burden, who was the fatty sitting on its shoulder made no difference. Its speed was not slowed down at all.Looking at the fatty feeling nauseous from the ride, Lin Huang was laughing inside.He was no different from the fatty yesterday aside from adapting himself to the feeling of riding on Tyrant.Recalling himself getting poked on his butt by Tyrant\u2019s rough hair, Lin Huang mumbled to himself, \u201cShouldn\u2019t have shaved the other side of its hair\u2026\u201dThe Sand Monster ran for more than four hours before the fatty started to complain.\u201cCan we rest for a while!? Oh my god, I feel like my buttcheeks are cracking!\u201dLin Huang\u2019s butt was numb too. Seeing the fatty no longer able to take it anymore, he got Tyrant to stop.Tyrant then placed the both of them on the ground. The fatty walked towards Lin Huang while rubbing his butt, \u201cLet\u2019s get some rest, eat something and drink some water before we go again.\u201dLin Huang nodded, let\u2019s rest, I\u2019ll get Tyrant to hunt for food.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, I have food with me!\u201d Fatty took a few big sips of water from his bottle and said.After keeping his bottle back to his storage, the fatty took a set of tableware out and a slice of square meat that was the size of a basketball.\u201cWhere did you get the food, didn\u2019t they confiscate your food yesterday?\u201d Lin Huang asked curiously.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? I didn\u2019t smuggle them in, I cut this from the Armored Pig that the team killed yesterday. It\u2019s the back of its leg, good stuff! I planned to keep this for myself but I treat you as my own brother, else I wouldn\u2019t share this with you.\u201d The fatty then started to slice the meat. Awhile later, the slab of meat was sliced.\u201cSo you\u2019re a chef.\u201d Seeing the fatty\u2019s good knife skills, Lin Huang figured out his occupation.\u201cWhat? A chef? I want to be a Food Hunter!\u201d The fatty looked up and refuted.There were many categories in the Hunter Association. Besides many Monster Hunters who mainly hunted monsters, there were Food Hunters who cooked, Treasure Hunters who looked for treasures and Guardian Hunters that protected rare species\u2026The Hunter Association was an organization that offered freedom. They did not only cultivate talents but provide talents of all kind to other organizations too.The Reserve Hunter assessment was not restricted to any category.To be a Food Hunter that was recognized by the Hunter Association, fatty first had to be a Reserve Hunter. And he would be required to choose a category when he was going for the Bronze Hunter assessment.Through the Food Hunter assessment, he would become a real hunter which recognized by the Hunter Association.In less than 20 minutes, fatty had roasted all the meat.Lin Huang tasted a piece and his eyes lit up as he said, \u201cFatty, you don\u2019t look like you could cook.\u201dFatty was a good cook, the roast meat was much better than the one Lin Huang cooked on the first day.Although it was not comparable to the one he tasted at the Stable Residence, it was the second best roast meat he had ever had.Suddenly, they heard a rumbling sound around them. They then noticed that Tyrant was drooling while staring at the roast meat.\u201cFatty, cook a big slab for it later.\u201d Lin Huang suggested after seeing Tyrant looking pitiful.\u201cIf we were to feed it, we would be hungry at night.\u201d Fatty was unwilling to cook the meat for Tyrant.\u201cJust give him a slice for him to taste some.\u201d Of course, Lin Huang knew that it was impossible to satisfy Tyrant\u2019s appetite. With its size, it would need a ton of meat for it to turn them into fats.Although the fatty was unwilling, thinking that he would need to ride it later, he took out a big slab and started roasting it while he ate his food.Just as they were done eating, the meat was roasted.The fatty used a tong to pass Tyrant the roast meat and said, \u201cBig guy, this is for you.\u201dTyrant looked at Lin Huang while it drooled.\u201cGo ahead.\u201dAfter Lin Huang nodded, it took the roast meat and tossed it into its mouth.It swallowed the meat together with the bones.\u201cDamn, why didn\u2019t it spit out the bones?\u201d It was the first time that fatty saw a Sand Monster eat and he was shocked.\u201cThe giant\u2019s stomach acid corrosion is more than 100 times more powerful than that of a human. They can digest bones completely. Whoever told you that giants spit out the bones when they eat?\u201d Lin Huang educated fatty on some scientific facts.\u201cRight, the giants that I saw in videos also swallowed the bones.\u201d Fatty recalled the time when he watched some educational videos.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, since we\u2019ve eaten, let\u2019s clean up and go on the road. If we are fast enough we can reach the Alps tomorrow night. Then, we\u2019ll rest for a night and we can start climbing the day after tomorrow in the morning.\u201d Lin Huang had done his planning earlier.It would take them two days to reach the alps if Tyrant was to travel for 10 hours per day.\u201cYay!\u201dFatty was excited when he heard that they could finish the journey in two days while ordinary people would take more than 10 days. The assessment could not get any easier than this.After cleaning up, they rode on Tyrant\u2019s shoulders and begun their journey\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang and fatty were not attacked by any people.Perhaps Tyrant was the reason why. Pure Gold Desert was a Grade-1 wild zone and there would not be any monsters that were over iron-level.Tyrant was an iron-level rank-3, it was a creature on top of the food chain and other predators would try their best to avoid it.It was hot during the day and most of the predators would choose to hibernate or rest.When the sun sets, the temperature would drop and they would go out to hunt. It would be a dumb move if Lin Huang was to travel at night.With Tyrant, they had ample time to get to their destination so there was no need for them to travel at night.After he recalled Tyrant, Lin Huang summoned his second Sand Monster.Fatty saw that Lin Huang summoned another monster, he was stunned.\u201cBro, how many monsters do you really have?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201d Lin Huang did not even turn around when he answered fatty while he built the tent.\u201cWhy did you not buy a portable tent? It\u2019s so troublesome to build it from scratch.\u201d Fatty sat on a rock while watching Lin Huang build the tent.\u201cI\u2019m poor, I can\u2019t afford that.\u201dWhat Lin Huang said was the truth.The portable tent that fatty mentioned was inspired by an armored piece of equipment. Its price was nothing less than an iron-level equipment.A few days ago, Lin Huang could not afford that at all.But it sounded ridiculous to fatty.\u201cI would believe you if you can\u2019t afford to trade your Life Crystals to get to iron-level. But if you tell me you can\u2019t even afford a portable tent, that\u2019s nonsense! I must visit your house one day to see how poor you are. If you really can\u2019t afford a portable tent, I would spend all I have to help you to get to iron-level!\u201d Fatty thought Lin Huang was exaggerating so he promised him that.For a normal person to get to iron-level, it would require more than 200 million credit points to activate all the gray columns in Life Wheel.200 million credit points were a lot, that was the reason why most of the people in this world could not get to iron-level.Lin Huang laughed when he heard what fatty said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look at my house. When we\u2019re done with the assessment, I\u2019ll bring you to the Credit Bureau to show you my bank book. You\u2019d definitely believe me by then.\u201d\u201cWhat? You must be kidding. Are you really that poor?\u201d Fatty panicked when he heard what Lin Huang said.Lin Huang smiled without saying anything. Fatty got even more panicked when he saw Lin Huang smiling, \u201cI was just messing with you just now, please don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201dLin Huang ignored him while he put all his attention on building the tent. When he was done, it was dark.Lin Huang turned around and saw the fatty sat on the rock without bringing out his tent, \u201cWhere is your portable tent?\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026 It was blown away by the wind last night\u2026\u201d Fatty scratched his head and avoided eye contact with Lin Huang.\u201cOh, then let\u2019s prepare dinner.\u201d Lin Huang seemed to ignore fatty who did not have a tent. He stretched his body and mumbled, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep after dinner, it had been a long day, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be a problem for you but what about me?\u201d Fatty looked at Lin Huang who just built the tent, he seemed troubled, \u201cHow about we share a tent tonight?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not happening. Settle your problem yourself.\u201d Lin Huang responded without even thinking.\u201cIt\u2019s usually cold at night. Look at my delicate body, if I was to sleep outside tonight, I would be frozen to death. Do you really want that to happen to me?\u201d Fatty gave him puppy dog eyes.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a problem. If you\u2019re cold, you can cuddle with the Sand Monster.\u201d Lin Huang gave him a creative suggestion.\u201cHe has more fats than you do, that\u2019s even sexier, just your cup of tea.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019d rather die\u2026\u201d Fatty looked at Sand Monster while it gave him a smile. Fatty shook his head and rejected the suggestion.\u201cDon\u2019t goof around, make dinner now!\u201d Lin Huang changed the topic.\u201cI\u2019ve lost my appetite, I can\u2019t eat anymore. I\u2019m not cooking.\u201d Fatty turned his head around, he seemed to be throwing a tantrum.\u201cCook first, I\u2019ll think of something for you after dinner.\u201d\u201cNo! You give me the solution now or I\u2019ll not cook tonight.\u201d Fatty sat on the rock crossing his arms while waiting for Lin Huang to give him a solution.\u201cThe solution is\u2026 I have a backup tent.\u201d Lin Huang laughed.\u201cAre you messing with me?\u201d Fatty was afraid that Lin Huang was not being serious.Lin Huang did not say anything as he took out a tent pole from his storage.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier!\u201d Fatty yelled at him while laughing.\u201cUnlike some people, I did my planning properly and brought a backup tent.\u201d Lin Huang said while he placed all the parts of the backup tent on the ground, \u201cYou fix it yourself after dinner, I\u2019m going to sleep now.\u201dFatty then quietly took out his tableware and started to prepare dinner.After dinner, the sky was completely dark with stars. It looked like the ocean, sparkling above him.The heat on the sand faded and the wind was chillier.Lin Huang got the Sand Monster to watch over the night while he went into his tent.Fatty was fixing the tent clumsily.Half an hour later, fatty built a distorted tent and there were still parts on the floor.He lost his tolerance and went into the incomplete tent anyway while he tried really hard to close the tent.Due to the sandstorm the night before, he did not get a good rest. Soon he fell asleep.Hearing fatty\u2019s snore from not far away, Lin Huang smiled as he shook his head.This fatty was such a naive guy, letting his guard down when he was with Lin Huang. He fell asleep immediately.\u201cThis fella must be exhausted\u2026\u201dAs Lin Huang had a good rest last night, he was not sleepy even though he was tired.Sleepiness only kicked in in the middle of the night.As the night went on, the desert became colder.Before dawn, there was a layer of frost on the ground.Under two full purple moons, the desert was calm.Suddenly, the Sand Monster who was sitting in front of the tent seemed to smell something.It started to sniff its surrounding and looked to the direction where it identified the source of the smell.Although it could not see clearly what it was because it was far away, it could see that something was approaching them at an alarming pace.It stood up immediately and screamed into the tent.\u201cAhh woo! Ahh woo! Ahh woo!\u201dLin Huang managed to fall asleep for only two hours before hearing the Sand Monster\u2019s scream outside. He sat up immediately.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe did not even remove his clothes and shoes as he was worried that there would be such incidents.He opened the tent and looked, shocked when he looked at the direction the Sand Monster was pointing at.He then walked to the fatty\u2019s tent.After several failed attempts to open his tent, he took out his sword from storage and cut the tent open.He slapped the fatty on his face, \u201cWake up fatty, we\u2019ll be dead if you continue sleeping!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He abruptly sat up in bed and subconsciously covered his body with a quilt as he saw his fat upper body. He was alert and asked Lin Huang, \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d\u201cJust follow me! I don\u2019t have time to explain to you now.\u201d Lin Huang tossed off his quilt, and Fatty was seen to be wearing red boxers only.\u201cI need to put my clothes on. Please leave my room now.\u201d Fatty immediately covered his chest.\u201cWe\u2019re dying, and you still care about putting on your clothes!\u201d Lin Huang grabbed his arm and dragged him out of the tent.Although Fatty was reluctant to leave, still, he followed Lin Huang and walked out of the tent since Lin Huang did not sound like he was joking.He was startled as soon as he got out of the tent.The sky far away from him was completely dark. Half of the blue sky had turned black, and it was expanding quickly as if it was stained with black ink. The entire sky was now separated into two distinct colors, which was dark blue and black.\u201cIt\u2019s the crows! We\u2019re doomed\u2026\u201d Fatty\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cKeep your big mouth shut and get up!\u201d Lin Huang re-summoned his Tyrant and sat above him.Tyrant pulled Fatty over and placed him on his shoulder. He glanced at the crows behind him and ran very quickly. This time, he was running at full speed, and his speed had exceeded 120 kilometers per hour.Lin Huang was still fine as he sat stably, holding Tyrant\u2019s beard tightly to prevent falls. On the other hand, Fatty did not sit properly from the beginning in addition to he was holding his clothes. He fell after Tyrant began running.Lin Huang was taken aback as he saw him fall. Fortunately, Tyrant was able to hold him before he fell. However, Tyrant did not place him back to his shoulder but held Fatty in his arms instead and continued running.His arms would swing way more than his shoulder when he started running madly. Fatty felt like he was on a roller coaster that was at least ten times faster. After a short while, he started to feel dizzy and eventually fainted.Lin Huang who was initially laughing at Fatty did not feel well then. Tyrant ran madly at full speed, and he swung at least one time faster. He felt like something moving across his stomach. Consequently, he vomited as he could not bear the feeling of uneasiness any longer.Tyrant\u2019s speed had exceeded 120 kilometers per hour. However, the distance between Lin Huang and the crows did grow further. Instead, they were getting closer to each other.These monsters were the undead. They were spirits without solid bodies and usually hunt spirits of the creatures. They flew in the sky, floated like clouds, but their speed was not slow at all.The crows were small and weak. Their abilities were merely at the iron-level. Since they were souls without bodies, they could easily be destroyed. Therefore, through prolonged evolution, they had found a way around this which was to hunt for prey in groups. When a large group of crows appeared, even the gold-rank hunters had to avoid them. They resembled ants that were weak alone but thousands of them could even threaten an elephant. This explained why the crows were so strong and powerful.There was a course called the Fundamental of Monster Guide offered by the Hunter Reserve College. A detailed explanation of the crows was provided. Lin Huang remembered there was a paragraph stated this, \u201cOne must avoid any location where corpses without injuries can be found. It can either be in the desert or forests and is a remote and inaccessible place. This was usually a sign where flocks of crows would appear. They would only hunt for souls and would not harm their bodies.\u201dLin Huang was sitting on Tyrant\u2019s shoulder but he looked back at the crows from time to time, estimating the distance between them. As time passed, they grew closer to each other, and Lin Huang\u2019s face turned pale.He quickly pondered on these thoughts, \u201cThese crows were creatures with no physical form. There\u2019s nowhere we could hide as they could directly pass through any objects including ground and mountains. Therefore, finding a place to hide would not work\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Life Power was capable of threatening the crows. However, even the gold-rank hunters would not trigger them as their efforts to kill would be in vain. I had not mastered the Life Power yet, and Fatty\u2019s ability was merely iron-level. Despite having specific skills to stop spirits or supernatural powers, it would be rendered useless as he was too weak.\u201d\u201cBased on the distance between us, it was estimated that within half an hour they would be ahead of us. The only choice we had now was to ask for help from the examiner. If we had the examiner\u2019s Dimensional Relic, we definitely could survive\u2026\u201d Lin Huang thought of it repeatedly, and this was the only way he could figure out. However, he hesitated.Pressing on the help button and they would be disqualified from the assessment. This was the rule mentioned by the main examiner in the first place. Even if they had reasonable reasons to request for help, but rules were rules.Lin Huang would usually not struggle like this, and he would give up the assessment without hesitation since if he were disqualified as a candidate, there would be a second chance for the assessment.However, the reason he applied to become a Reserve Hunter was to fulfill the requirement of the mission related to the Goldfinger. Punishment for failing this mission was quite harsh. It stated that if Lin Huang could not complete the mission within a month, he would lose his Goldfinger and the items rewarded during the activation of Goldfinger.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis indicated that he would not only lose his Goldfinger, Xiao Hei but also the Monster Cards, Skill Cards as well as the Life Light gained from the kills. He would return to the condition he was in before his travels or probably even worse.Lin Huang was upset. He was not sure if he could still look for another foothold to apply for the assessment and complete the assessment within the limited time if he were disqualified this round. He was so confident that he could pass the assessment, so he did not survey about the information of the assessment at another foothold. He had no access to the internet now to check these details.This gave Lin Huang a headache as he looked at Tyrant\u2019s right hand which held the fainted Fatt. If Fatty did not faint, he would convince him to give up the assessment and in turn, compensate him with a few types of equipment. Unfortunately, Fatty had fainted, and his emergency communicator was at the locker, irretrievable at the moment.After struggling for a long time, he looked at the crows behind him and realized they were getting nearer and nearer. Lin Huang finally decided and thought, \u201cIt was of the utmost importance to survive under such circumstances! I will think about the mission later.\u201dHe had finally made up his mind and took out his emergency communicator. He then pressed the help button.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was around 800 kilometers away from Lin Huang.In the imperial suite of a grand hotel, a woman was sound asleep in the spacious master bedroom.She was wearing a loose, white silk pajamas that covered her body only until her hip and exposed her long, slender legs. When the moonlight shone on it, ravishing colors were seen reflected, shimmering on the surface.All of a sudden, the woman\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring on her left index finger vibrated and a sound akin to a siren filled the atmosphere. She groaned modestly as she woke up to sit on the edge of her bed.She fluffed her hair and in an annoying tone said, \u201cIt\u2019s so late now and my sleep is disturbed!\u201dYi Yeyu was one of those who got irritated easily if they were sleep-deprived. She pressed the connect button on the communicator. She looked ferocious even with a straight face. She said, \u201cLet\u2019s see who dares disturb me at this hour while I\u2019m sleeping!\u201dA three-dimensional map was suddenly projected from the ring. It was a complete map that showed the regions of assessment. A red, bright dot on the map constantly blinked while sounds of siren continued to echo her bedroom.This red dot was obviously the cry for help sent by Lin Huang.\u201cWhat the hell is this person doing? He did not stay there to be rescued after sending out a signal for help but ran so quickly!\u201d Yi Yeyu was angry as her eyes tried to catch the flickering red dot that was constantly moving and changing its position on the map. After a while, her facial expression slightly changed. She noticed that it was strange and thought, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the speed. Even those on bronze-level could not travel at such speeds in the desert.\u201dYi Yeyu spent some time and changed her clothes into a black suit. She was pissed and calculated the speed of motion of the red dot. She relocated the coordinates for delivering and summoned the relic.A green wooden door with the height of about two meters appeared abruptly in the hotel room. Yi Yeyu pushed the door and strode out of the room.Yi Yeyu then appeared in the assessment area through the green wooden door. She then crossed her hands in front of her chest. She looked toward the direction where the red dot appeared, unhappy.As the red dot got closer to her, she smiled coldly as she wanted to teach him a lesson. However, her face suddenly changed.She looked at the sky; it was covered by a dark shadow. The huge shadow was moving rapidly towards her. Her vision was clear, she was able to see a huge flock of crows.She recalled the terrifying speed of the red dot that appeared on the map and suddenly understood what was happening. She could not help but laugh and thought, \u201cWho was the unfortunate, poor soul who got chased by the crows? It was not easy to survive this mishap\u2026\u201dAfter a short while, she saw something was running madly, stirring up the sandy dust. She identified a gigantic Sand Monster running insanely.\u201cA Sand Monster?\u201d The crows would probably be ahead of it very soon. Where\u2019s the fellow who requested for help? Could it be that he\u2019s just behind the Sand Monster?\u201d Yi Yeyu then looked behind the Sand Monster but saw nothing because the skies were dusty.At this moment, she heard a sound coming from far away, \u201cDear examiner, please help us to get out of this place!\u201dIt was then that Yi Yeyu realized a young man sitting on the shoulder of the Sand Monster, waving at her.Lin Huang did not notice Yi Yeyu at the first instance. It was only when he saw the green wooden door that he noticed her standing beside it.\u201cHow could this fellow be the Imperial Censor?!\u201d Yi Yeyu was surprised. She could remember this young man who almost missed the deadline for his application as he was the only candidate that was not an iron-level.The crows were now so close to Lin Huang, they were not even a kilometer apart. It was visible to the naked eye that the distance between them reduced as time passed.He kept looking back and asked Tyrant to run faster.Tyrant ran recklessly toward Yi Yeyu. He knew how scary the crows were.Yi Yeyu felt a sense of urgency. She then quickly wove arcane symbols with both of her hands. The gold Life Power formed a strange insignia in the space in front of her. The insignia formed a shape after it was complete and was automatically imprinted on the green wooden door.The green wooden door which was initially around two meters tall expanded rapidly to about 10 meters within about two seconds.\u201cEscape through the door!\u201d Lin Huang commanded once the expansion was done.The distance between him and the crows was less than 300 meters now. Everyone including the examiner would die if Tyrant stopped for a second or two.This was an urgent matter and Yi Yeyu knew it. Otherwise, she would not have expended her Life Power to trigger the change in form of the door.Tyrant did not stop at all. The moment right before he reached the door, he took a big leap and jumped over the door. The crows were surrounding them but Yi Yeyu did not bother to look back at the crows. She followed after Tyrant and leaped through the door.Just when the crows were about to catch up to them, the green wooden door closed abruptly. They disappeared from the desert as if they had never appeared before. At the same time, a black torrent swept through the region, filling every nook and cranny with gloom as countless crows began to converge.\u2026Yi Yeyu\u2019s bedroom was a mess. There was a big hole which penetrated through a few rooms on the ceiling of her room when Tyrant advanced to the hotel through the green wooden door. It was already too late when Lin Huang reacted to recall Tyrant.Yi Yeyu was upset, she took a seat on her bed while Fatty was lying on the ground, in a state of unconsciousness.\u201cYour name is Lin Huang?\u201d Yi Yeyu could remember his name as she was the one who did the registration for him when he applied for the assessment. \u201cTell me the whole course of this incident.\u201dLin Huang was slightly relieved to hear that she was at least interested to hear his side of the story. He was worried about having to compensate for the damages and loss of the hotel. He then calmed himself down and said, \u201cYesterday when Fatty and I were sleeping at around two o\u2019clock in the morning, the night watcher woke me up. After I got out of the tent, I discovered the crows. I woke Fatty up at once. We sat on the Sand Monster\u2019s shoulder and fled. After running for some time, we then realized that we could not get rid of them. I had no choice but to request for help.\u201dIn turn, Yi Yeyu frowned and said, \u201cIt was approximately half an hour ago when you sent out the distress signal. Weren\u2019t the crows already chasing you at the time?\u201d\u201cYes, otherwise, I would not have pressed the help button.\u201d Lin Huang looked puzzled.\u201cTyrant was capable of escaping for half an hour, yet the crows did not overtake him? This speed could not be easily achieved by iron-level Sand Monsters. Was it a mutated Sand Monster?\u201d Earlier in the desert, Yi Yeyu could vaguely sense that Tyrant exuded a strange aura. After listening to Lin Huang, she was sure about it.Mutated monsters were rare. Once they became mutants, their attributes would be significantly altered. They could produce new skills, and their skills could be further enhanced.Indeed, Tyrant did not use any Advance Cards to become a mutant. He was born like that. He had a green-crystal card when Lin Huang found him. Lin Huang had no intention to hide it from Yi Yeyu so that he might be allowed for the assessment once he reveals its strength.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a mutated monster.\u201d Lin Huang said underneath his breath.\u201cAlright, I know now.\u201d There was no expression on Yi Yeyu\u2019s face. \u201cRegarding the crow incident, I\u2019ll report to the person in charge. This issue will probably be settled before daybreak. I\u2019ll then send both of you back to continue with your assessment.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I\u2019m not disqualified from the assessment?\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s tone lightened.\u201cDo you prefer to be disqualified from the exam?\u201d Yi Yeyu said over her shoulder as she walked away from Lin Huang.\u201cNo, I never wanted to press the help button. Something was wrong with the emergency communicator, and it had nothing to do with me.\u201d Lin Huang said shamelessly, waving his hand.\u201cWe only have a few Imperial Censors. An Imperial Censor is always welcome to join the Hunter Association. An Imperial Censor like you who possess the exceptional ability to summon mutants would be qualified to be recruited. However, I\u2019ve used up three of my quota for special recruitments this month. The only thing you can do now is to pass the assessment and become a Reserve Hunter yourself.\u201d Yi Yeyu explained in detail. \u201cIf you fail the assessment, you\u2019ll have to wait until next month to be recruited through the special recruitment. By the end of the month, you can register yourself at foothold 7C87.\u201dLin Huang never thought for a second that he could get valuable benefits from the identity of an imperial censor. Overall, he was happy to not be disqualified after all.The good news only lasted 3 seconds before he was bombarded with the inevitable bad news.\u201cI\u2019ll pay the damages and loss of the hotel for you. Repay the money back to me when you have it.\u201d Yi Yeyu added.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe hotel damage costs\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright. You can now leave my room along with Fatty. We\u2019ll meet in the hotel\u2019s lobby at nine o\u2019clock tomorrow morning. The crow\u2019s incident should be settled by then, and I\u2019ll send both of you back to continue your assessment.\u201dLin Huang carried Fatty on his back as he struggled to walk out of her room.As soon as the door closed, Yi Yeyu thought with a grin, \u201cI guess I\u2019m too lucky. I\u2019ve recruited an Imperial Censor with the ability to summon mutated monsters. Let\u2019s see who dare say that the newbie I\u2019ve recruited is weak!\u201dHowever, she did not know that the comments they always had about Lin Huang were that he was extremely weak!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang was awake from his sleep.He was escaping from danger throughout the night and he was very exhausted. However, he did not sleep well in the hotel. He felt insecure as he had nightmares about crows in the sky.Fatty never woke up but was still snoring loudly. Lin Huang originally requested a room with twin beds but because he could not stand the snoring, he requested to be switched to another room of his own.He woke Fatty up and roughly told him what happened last night when they were having their breakfast.At nine o\u2019clock sharp, Yi Yeyu came dressed in a purple ladies suit, wearing a pair of black stilettos that were 20 centimeters high.Her appearance caught many people\u2019s attention. To the men, she was attractive.\u201cHave you settled the crows?\u201d Lin Huang could not help but ask as he saw Yi Yeyu walking towards him.\u201cYes, I have. I informed the Association last night after you left. According to the Association, they sent a transcendant hunter to kill the crows in less than one minute.\u201d Yi Yeyu said proudly.\u201cThat person killed such a huge group of crows within a minute?!\u201d Lin Huang could not believe it. Until now, he had no idea what the strongest man in the could do. From what he heard, the transcendants had abilities beyond the existing human\u2019s abilities.\u201cYou can hardly imagine how powerful a transcendant hunter is. Don\u2019t aim too high. What you should do now is to think of how you can pass the assessment and upgrade to iron-level.\u201d She then added, \u201cYou should also think of how you can return me my money\u2026\u201dAs he heard the last sentence, Lin Huang kept quiet so that she would not be reminded about this too often.\u201cThe crows have been killed, and the area where the exam takes place should be safe now. Follow me, and I\u2019ll send you back to where you were yesterday to proceed with the assessment.\u201d Yi Yeyu said and pointed both of them to her room.When they were in front of the door, Lin Huang took a glance at the room\u2019s number. He had a strange expression and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you change your room?\u201d\u201cThe boss of the hotel did not allow me to change. He was afraid that I might cause more damage to his room \u201d Yi Yeyu answered.Three of them entered the room. Fatty looked at the large hole in the ceiling and said, \u201cDamn! Sister, what have you done here and why did you blow up the ceiling!\u201d\u201cYou have to ask him about this.\u201d Yi Yeyu pointed at Lin Huang.Lin Huang looked uncomfortable yet apologetic.\u201cHow could it be? Last night both of you were together in the room?\u201d Fatty immediately grasped the meaning of their conversation and smiled wryly. \u201cIs there chemistry between the both of you?\u201d\u201cThis is bullshit. You were here last night.\u201d Lin Huang knew that Fatty was trying to insinuate something dirty.\u201cI was here too?! Did you do something to me that I was not aware of? I\u2019m still a virgin!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Lin Huang and Yi Yeyu shouted unanimously.\u201cBoth of you may leave now if you don\u2019t have anything else to ask.\u201d Yi Yeyu asked, looking at both of them and they shook their heads.Yi Yeyu summoned the big wooden door and pushed against it.Lin Huang and Fatty strode out the door.The other side of the big wooden door was the location Tyrant entered the door to escape at midnight.\u201cWhere is this place?\u201d Fatty looked lost because when they were escaping from the crows at midnight, he fainted. He was clueless as to what had taken place.Lin Huang looked around him. However, nothing was familiar to him. Tyrant carried both of them and ran very quickly at midnight. Lin Huang was not aware of the surrounding at all as he was busy estimating the distance between them and the crows. He somehow made a quick guess and said, \u201cThe crows were coming from the south region yesterday, and we escaped for half an hour towards the north. We should be now around 60 kilometers away from our tent.\u201d\u201cThen where should we go now? Should we proceed towards the north?\u201d asked Fatty.\u201cLet\u2019s get back our tent first. Otherwise, we won\u2019t have a place to sleep tonight.\u201d Lin Huang wisely remarked.\u201cAlright. Thanks to Tyrant\u2019s speed, we would only need to spend half an hour to go back. If we had to walk, it would take at least half a day to reach.\u201d Fatty reasoned.They summoned Tyrant, and both of them sat on his shoulder once again. They then departed.After half an hour, Tyrant brought them back to the station where they set up camp yesterday.Fatty\u2019s tent was more eye-catching. It was not because of its color, but because of its funky shape.Thank God the tent was still in good shape.The crows only hunt for souls and were not interested in inanimate objects.\u201cYou made such a long cut on my tent, can I still use it?\u201d Fatty asked, visibly displeased.\u201cWhere else will you sleep tonight?\u201d Lin Huang did not want to share a tent with Fatty and began folding his tent.Fatty knew that Lin Huang did not want to stay in the same tent with him. He was forced to take down his tent, and he mumbled, \u201cI should have woken up earlier just now to buy a new tent before meeting the lady\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat have you done with her? Why can\u2019t you tell me? Why did the room become like that? Also, why did she say you owed her money?\u201d Fatty asked in one breath.Lin Huang did not bother to answer him and continued folding his tent. He was not in a good mood because he was in debt for no reason. He thought in his heart that he would never summon Tyrant in the hotel ever again.\u201cEh, say something!\u201d Fatty threw a screw at him to break the silence.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d Lin Huang asked impatiently.After a while, Fatty threw another screw at him, \u201cYou look upset. Did you lose your virginity to her?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t bother me. Do your own thing!\u201d Lin Huang was beginning to get annoyed.After a moment of silence, he started talking again, \u201cI somehow feel that Yi Yeyu\u2019s attitude toward you was sort of weird\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d Still, Lin Huang\u2019s back faced Fatty.Fatty found Lin Huang\u2019s reaction uninteresting. He then focused on taking down his tent.Lin Huang felt a wave a peace and he was thankful for that\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thankfully, Tyrant\u2019s powerful abilities killed those monsters in an instant so there was no delay in their journey.Monsters would usually avoid Tyrant by hiding.This time around, in only a matter of few hours; they were attacked by four monsters. These monsters were much weaker than Tyrant and because of that, all the monsters perished.Logically, the monsters would never place themselves in danger because monsters are equipped with instinctive responses to avoid danger. It was indeed unusual to see them charging at the face of death, Tyrant.At one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the desert temperature peaked.Lin Huang and Fatty found an abandoned house where they stopped so that Tyrant could rest.This house was used as a supply depot and utilized by the Hunter Association. Tyrant moved towards the supply depot.By the looks of the house\u2019s structure, it must have existed for a long time. The supply depot was not specifically built for the assessment.The Hunter Association would always build all types of supply depots for passerby\u2019s convenience.\u201cLooking at the weathered house, this supply depot must have been around for at least 30 years. It doesn\u2019t look abandoned,\u201d said Fatty.\u201cEven if it was an abandoned supply depot, there\u2019s a high probability it of being utilized as a part of the assessment since it\u2019s on the way to our final destination. The strategic location of the supply depot caused the weak to be eliminated and those who managed to reach the supply depot would\u2019ve already passed the assessment by completing the first half of the journey.\u201d Lin Huang was 80% sure that there would be supplies in it. \u201cLet\u2019s go in and have a look.\u201dIndeed, it was a storehouse with barrels of water and some high energy snacks.Fatty was happy and quickly walked towards the food. He took a packet of food and began to eat.Lin Huang took a barrel of water from the storage space and walked toward Fatty asking, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\u201cYes, and this brand of the potato chips are my favorite.\u201d Fatty sucked his thumb in a gesture to disgust Lin Huang.\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, you can cook up a meal but you can only eat one packet. You know the rules right.\u201d Lin Huang referred to the unwritten rule which every hunter should know \u2013 items from the supply depot should be taken in moderation.The items provided by supply depot were actually for the needy. Sometimes, a glass of water or even leftover food could be a lifesaver. Therefore, those who could do without the water and food should not be greedy.Fatty was nonetheless shameless, he couldn\u2019t care less about these unspoken rules. After finishing that initial pack of chips, he took another packet and kept it in his storage space. He then took another barrel of water and walked out of the house.Lin Huang was drinking some water as he sat in the shaded corridor. He reminded Fatty, \u201cBefore you cook, make sure your hands are clean!\u201dIn all honesty, Fatty cooked very well. The only complaint Lin Huang had was that he had poor personal hygiene.Fatty grilled some meat and after he was done, both of them sat at the shaded corridor, eating.\u201cI brought some Pilsner over. I thought I could enjoy some drinks during the journey. Unfortunately, it was confiscated before the assessment even started.\u201d Fatty grumbled.\u201cIt\u2019s an assessment. Did you think that you were here for a holiday?\u201d Lin Huang was sarcastic.\u201cIt\u2019s a must to have some alcohol at a barbecue. Plain water at a barbeque is just not right\u201d Fatty responded, so sure of himself.Lin Huang agreed that it was indeed weird to drink plain water at a barbecue.\u201cAlright, stop grumbling. We have to continue with our journey after having our meals. We must try our best to reach the foot of the Snowy Mountains before dark.\u201d Lin Huang said as he thought about the schedule he planned for the journey. Based on the speed of Tyrant, he estimated the remaining journey to be seven hours.Fatty cleaned the cooking utensils and both of them resumed their journey.Tyrant ran under the scorching sun. However, the sand reflected a golden gleam. Lin Huang and Fatty wore sunglasses and they looked like they were on vacation.After a short while, Lin Huang felt something stirring up from beneath the sand. He took off his sunglasses for a better view and stared at the sand but there was nothing there.Lin Huang seemed confused. He then pointed at the direction of the sand and shouted, \u201cHey, did you see something move underneath the sand just now?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. It is not windy now and so it will be easy to notice if anything moved either on or under the desert sand.\u201d Fatty replied while waving his hand.The sand began to roll again and this time, in the direction of the Sand Monster.\u201cThere\u2019s something there!\u201d Lin Huang yelled. The Sand Monster smelled something strange and started to be uncomfortable.Lin Huang was more sensitive to Tyrant and he noticed its unusual reaction. This indicated that something frightening was about to happen. Lin Huang prepared for the worst as he held Tyrant\u2019s beard tightly with one hand and in his other hand, he took out his GrayEagle17.\u201cTyrant, stop!\u201d Lin Huang commanded because he noticed that the unknown object was moving way faster than Tyrant. They would not escape in time. They waited instead for the unknown creature to charge at them.\u201cFatty, get ready. It may not be an easy feat this time.\u201d Lin Huang shouted.Tyrant stopped. Lin Huang could feel his heart pounding.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe aimed at the sand with his GrayEagle17 and in a split second, pulled the trigger.They did not have with them many explosive shells so Lin Huang used bullets specially made for GrayEagle17.However, the bullets had no impact. It did nothing to the creature because the unknown object kept moving forward and when the shot was fired, a sharp metal plate sound rang instead of a painful groan.The GrayEagle17 was not unfamiliar to Fatty. His face turned pale as he witnessed the bullets deflecting into various directions.Tyrant roared profusely\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a gigantic creature that looked like a python. It had blood red scales and scales on its body its body that was around 20 meters long. It was a lot taller than Tyrant when it erected its body upright.There was merely a mouth on its head. It did not even have eyes! Looking at Tyrant, it opened its mouth slightly. It was visible to Lin Huang and the rest of them that there were many sharp teeth that resembled barbs wriggling in its mouth.Both of their facial expression changed when they saw the monster\u2019s features.\u201cWhat should we do?! This is an Undead Worm!\u201d Fatty cried.The Undead Worm was identified as a type of demon. They were the scariest predators on the desert. They were rare and the worst part is that they do not have natural enemies here. They preyed on all the creatures in the desert.All demons are vicious when they hunt for food; an Undead Worm was no different.Once the prey was in its mouth, the barbs inside its mouth would wriggle, crushing and slicing the victim. It resembled a meat grinder.It was a known myth that they had a smaller mouth inside their big mouth. It would pierce the ground to the creature\u2019s skull and absorb its brain.The Undead Worm in front of them was around 20 meters long. Similar to Tyrant, they were on iron-level. However, these monsters were the Sand Monster\u2019s enemy. It would have a much higher probability of defeating Tyrant.This was also the monster that Lin Huang wished not to encounter the most. However, he was forced to conquer his fears now.\u201cWe can\u2019t escape this anymore, just f*ck it!\u201d Lin Huang knew exactly what the situation was now. He shouted back at Fatty, but his gaze never left the Undead Worm.The Undead Worm erected upright but it had not launched an attack. It kept its huge mouth open, looking like a freak that was sizing up Lin Huang and the rest of them. It was how predators looked down on their prey.The Sand Monster obeyed Lin Huang\u2019s command to not be reckless.Lin Huang and Fatty did not react; they were stunned.Looking at the Undead Worm that had yet to trigger an attack, Lin Huang made a guess and asked, \u201cCould it be that this monster only attacks moving objects?\u201d\u201cYou asked the wrong person. I have not mastered the monster guide. I was able to recognize this monster because I\u2019ve seen it before on the news.\u201d Fatty swallowed a mouthful of saliva and continued, \u201cThe news was about a Reserve Hunter team that encountered the Undead Worm in the desert. A team of five were killed by this monster in less than 10 minutes. When the rescue team for the monster hunters arrived, the Undead Worm had bitten off the top half of the last Reserve Hunter.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me the content of the news\u2026\u201dTheir conversation lasted for a while and the Undead Worm was still ignorant to their existence.\u201cWhy is it still moving now? Did we encounter a fake Undead Worm instead?\u201d Fatty asked, hoping that the answer to that was positive.\u201cIs there anything in your storage that you\u2019re not going to use?\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d Fatty knew what Lin Huang was thinking.At that moment, the Undead Worm moved and pounced on Fatty.\u201cDamn! It\u2019s coming at me!\u201d Fatty shouted, his voice shaky.Tyrant\u2019s body was short and he used that advantage to roll away, avoiding the kill. Fatty was not aware of his surroundings and was caught in between the heated battle. He was flung across the air and fell beside the Undead Worm, about 2 meters from each other.It seemed like he felt a stir around, the Undead Worm\u2019s mouth immediately turned to Fatty\u2019s position and slowly walked towards him.Its mouth was getting closer to him, his heart felt like protruding out of his body. His mind repeatedly told him to run, but his conscious warned him to stand his ground because if he ran, he would most certainly die.\u201cFatty, don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll distract the Undead Worm!\u201d Lin Huang said, looking at the Undead Worm\u2019s mouth gradually moving toward Fatty. They were less than three meters apart. Lin Huang knew that Fatty would be killed if he did not move to distract it.\u201cTyrant, run!\u201d Lin Huang ordered.As Tyrant heard this, he made off and ran away from the Undead Worm like an arrow leaving the bow.The Undead Worm immediately turned his head back as it noticed Tyrant was trying to escape from it. It seemed like it was targeting Tyrant\u2019s direction. He then chased after him at a faster speed.Fatty was relieved when he saw the Undead Worm changing its target. There was a moment where he actually thought that he would die.His legs trembled as he sat on the surface of the sand. Fatty then realized that he was sweating and his body was all wet. It was not because of the hot weather, but it was due to anxiety and fear.He rested for a while but hesitated. He then stood up and ran in the direction of Tyrant and the Undead Worm. He mumbled as he ran, \u201cLin Huang, please don\u2019t die! If you sacrifice your life to save me, there\u2019s no way for me to return the favor to you in my entire life\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the golden sand, the giant Sand Monster did not stop running, and a trail of sand could be seen behind him as they got closer to each other. Just when the Undead Worm wriggled through the sand and was about to pounce on the Sand Monster, it disappeared from the ground.At the dunes far away from them, Lin Huang smiled. He had another green monster card with him right now.A few minutes ago, before the Undead Worm was able to catch up with Tyrant, he left Lin Huang at the dunes nearby. He then left Tyrant to distract the Undead Worm while he observed the distance between them at the dunes.When the Undead Worm tried catching up to Tyrant, Lin Huang turned Tyrant back into a monster card which ruined the Undead Worm\u2019s plan. It stood still and kept looking around for Tyrant.Lin Huang crashed the green monster card and re-summoned Tyrant. He then said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ve to go back and look for Fatty!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang noticed that Fatty was missing.\u201cWhat the hell is Fatty doing? Please don\u2019t tell me that he was looking for me.\u201dThe footprints on the ground were covered by sand. It was almost impossible to trace where Fatty had disappeared to. Lin Huang turned his head toward the direction of the Undead Worm.Lin Huang recalled the Sand Monster when they reached the sand dunes. He then climbed to the dune\u2019s crest with his head jutting outward, looking in the direction of the Undead Worm but it was no longer there and Fatty was nowhere in sight too.\u201cThe Undead Worm disappeared\u2026\u201d Lin Huang frowned. He did not know what happened. \u201cIt would be impossible for Fatty to reach here in 10 minutes. Perhaps he escaped somewhere else.\u201dLin Huang summoned Tyrant again and they looked around. However, he still could not find Fatty and eventually, he gave up.Tyrant and Lin Huang ran towards the north. Lin Huang was heavy-hearted, worried that Fatty might have died and his body may never be found.In the following hours, they encountered a few monsters during their journey to the north. However, Tyrant was able to defeat all of them and they finally arrived at the foot of the Snowy Mountains before sunset.Lin Huang set his tent up and proceeded to sit quietly on the sandy ground. He leaned against a large rock and took out some dried meat to eat from his storage space.Fatty cooked the smoked meat during the barbecue they had a couple of nights before and insisted that Lin Huang took some with him for the journey since it would be inconvenient to cook near the iceberg once they began their climb.Lin Huang then ate the dried meat and drank plain water for dinner. At night, the sky turned dark.The sky was full of stars. Suddenly, Lin Huang saw meteors shooting across the sky. He thought of a common saying, \u201cEveryone has a star that represents their life. When it falls, they die. They\u2019ll become a meteor and shine one last time.\u201d\u201cFatty, if you\u2019re no longer with us, when I\u2019m stronger, I\u2019ll take my revenge on all the monsters in this desert for killing you.\u201d As soon as Lin Huang finished his sentence, he poured libations of plain water from the jug on the ground in front of him. \u201cLet\u2019s drink plain water first. I\u2019ll buy you some liquor after the assessment ends.\u201dLin Huang then took a look at the sky and saw another meteor passing through the sky. As the meteor faded into the clouds, Lin Huang summoned Tyrant to keep watch beside his tent. Finally, he entered the tent to go to bed.\u201cI need a good rest tonight to energize myself. I\u2019ll start my climb tomorrow morning.\u201d Lin Huang slept without taking off his clothes and shoes.It was a peaceful night.When Lin Huang woke up, it was only seven o\u2019clock in the morning. He washed up and prepared himself for the journey ahead of him.At the foot of the Snowy Mountains, the slopes were gentle. It was not covered in a thick layer of snow. Tyrant carried Lin Huang and this allowed him to conserve his physical strength.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, take your time.\u201dTyrant\u2019s body size was not suitable for climbing mountains. Lin Huang could only take a ride on flat terrains. When the hill got steeper with regions that were covered by snow, Tyrant\u2019s weight caused the mountain to crack.Tyrant carried Lin Huang and walked for less than an hour before reaching a height of 3000 meters above sea level. If they climbed any further upwards, they would reach the regions covered in snow.Lin Hung then summoned Bai and Tyrant was recalled.Bai had silver hair. It had been waiting patiently for instructions.\u201cLet\u2019s climb together. When I get stuck, help me a little through the hard parts.\u201d Lin Huang knew that climbing the Snowy Mountains was the toughest task in this assessment.The Snowy Mountains were elevated 6,000 meters above sea level at its lowest point. At the mountain peak, it was 12,000 meters above sea level.The route set by the Hunter Association was one that led to one of the main peaks of the Snowy Mountain. It was around 8,000 meters above sea level.Lin Huang had never climbed the Snowy Mountains before. This was a huge challenge for him and to make it worse, he was the only candidate that had not achieved iron-level. Whichever it was, either physical capabilities or stamina, he was definitely weaker than the rest of the candidates.If he had not acquired the Robust passive skill that allowed a two-time increment in his physique, Lin Huang would absolutely have no confidence to pass this stage.Lin Huang was considering transforming Bai by wrapping its Blood Power around him so it could pull him up. In the end, he reasoned with himself that perhaps the challenge might be good for him.Upon receiving Lin Huang\u2019s instruction, Bai nodded its head. Bai turned its body and headed toward the rock wall that was covered by snow and used its bare hands to climb it. At the start of the journey, it seemed doable as it was only a height of just two meters. Lin Huang put on his gloves and followed behind Bai.Bai was a quick climber but Lin Huang was not and so, Bai had to constantly wait for Lin Huang every two meters. Lin Huang thought that it was easier to climb behind Bai as he would leave movement trails on its pathway for Lin Huang to follow. Both of them were almost similar body size so anywhere Bai could climb to, Lin Huang could do so as well.In the afternoon, Lin Huang and Bai only managed to climb around 600 meters before stopping.If it were a distance on flat land, they would have reached their location in less than 10 minutes with a consistent walking speed but unfortunately, both of them spent more than five hours to reach this height.Lin Huang was exhausted and suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s find a resting place to energize ourselves.\u201dBai nodded its head and quickly transformed. Its Blood-powered wings were transformed into blades, cutting through the rock walls as it grazed the surface. It cut out rocks that were two meters long and two meters wide. The blood-powered blades continued to pierce through and in the process, it dug out a rock wall with a layer of ice on it before both of them slid into the hole.The hold was deep, its depth around 10 meters.The wind outside the hole howled and grew louder. Fortunately, it was still warm inside the hole.Lin Huang leaned against the wall and sat down. He then ate the dried meat for lunch once again.He was about to share with Bai but then remembered that it only drank blood.He ate another fist-sized piece of dried meat and drank some water. After getting enough rest, he gave Bai a signal, waving to it that it was time for the both of them to set off again.Bai led the way and together, they climbed 700 meters within five hours. This time, they had arrived at a safer place compared to the first phase of their climbing journey.He looked at the sky. Even though the sun had not set yet, Lin Huang refused to continue the journey. They set up camp on the mountain, preparing for a good rest so they were able to continue their journey early the next morning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was now at around 4800 meters above sea level.After the tents were set up, he started a fire to cook dinner.The sky got darker and the flames were burning bright. Lin Huang could not help but miss Fatty\u2019s cooking skills as he smelled the smell of raw meat.There was soup boiling in the pot. After a few hours, a meaty fragrance filled their surroundings and that was the signal for Lin Huang to have dinner.He used a ladle to scoop the meat from the pot and onto his plate. After a few bites of the juicy meat, Bai moved abruptly and returned with a furry, little white monster in its palm\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had a pair of bright, black eyes and a huge mouth that took up almost half of its face. That was all there was to its body.Lin Huang could recognize that it was a Snowball Monster.The Snowball Monster was a mutated species. To most humans, it was harmless. Though they had sharp teeth, they were cowards. They would prefer to flee when faced with creatures bigger than they were. They hated fights.They looked cute and many girls loved them. People then took advantage of its adorable traits and turned it into a business opportunity. The price of a Snowball Monster was even higher than bronze-level firearms. They were kept as ornamental pets or sold to rich ladies as companions wherever they traveled. Slowly, this became a trend.They were omnivores but were not choosy with their meals. Therefore, it was rather easy to keep a Snowball Monster fed. They were a rare species that oftentimes hid in cold places.Lin Huang took a thorough look at it. It must have been attracted by the fragrance of the meat. Even as Bai held onto the Snow Monster, it did not seem to move or struggle to escape. It was staring at the pot of soup for a long time and eventually, its tongue began to show! It was such a glutton.Lin Huang tempted it by waving a piece of meat it in front of it.Its eyes immediately lit up and its gaze was locked onto that slab of meat in front of him, following the movement of Lin Huang\u2019s arm that was swinging the meat.After a short while, it noticed that Lin Huang did not put the meat into its mouth. It attempted to snatch the food but Bai was quick to hold on to it tighter.Knowing that its efforts to break free were in vain, it raised its head and looked at Lin Huang with pain in its eyes as Lin Huang chewed on the meat.\u201cNo wonder the girls would like them, they give pitiful looks to seek for attention and sympathy.\u201d Lin Huang was taken aback at the Snowball Monster\u2019s sad expression.He then fed the Snowball Monster some meat. It gobbled up the meat within seconds. It then went back to showing him a sad look.This time, Lin Huang did not entertain it and continued eating his dinner.After a long time of staring at him, the Snowball Monster began to cry when it realized it was being ignored.\u201cYou\u2019re a good actor.\u201d Lin Huang chuckled, continued ignoring the monster.The Snowball Monster started its acting with only a few tears but the moment it realized that Lin Huang could not care less, it began sobbing to catch Lin Huang\u2019s attention.\u201cThis fellow is so dramatic\u2026\u201d Lin Huang said, not turning to even look at the monster.Lin Huang ladled out the leftovers into a bowl and placed it on the floor. He then grabbed the monster from Bai and sat it down beside that bowl.Without wasting time, the Snowball Monster tilted the bowl upwards and swallowed the leftovers. It then licked its lips and raised its head at Lin Huang.\u201cYou won\u2019t get anything by staring at me. There\u2019s no more food left.\u201d Lin Huang said, shaking his palm.The Snowball Monster knew that the food had finished. It then hugged Lin Huang\u2019s leg and rubbed its head against his pants. It looked like an expression of gratitude.Lin Huang lifted it up and reciprocated, \u201cIt feels like a stuffed plush toy. It feels even better to touch because of its warmth.\u201dThe Snowball Monster seemed to enjoy it as Lin Huang saw it smiling with its eyes shut.\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying the good life\u2026\u201d Lin Huang said as he shook his head and laughed.As the skies became darker, Lin Huang signaled that he wanted to sleep by pulling his leg from its hug. He needed sufficient rest as their journey to climb the Snowy Mountains would continue tomorrow morning.When he was about to call for Bai and summon the Sand Monster to keep watch outside his tent, he saw the Snowball Monster rushing to the edge of his pants and began nibbling at it, pulling him toward a specific direction.\u201cYou small little thing, where are you taking me?\u201d Lin Huang gasped.The Snowball Monster nodded its head and hopped a few steps in the opposite direction. When it turned back, Lin Huang waved his hand and began following it.The Snowball Monster hopped along a gentle slope with Lin Huang and Bai following closely after it.It stood still when it reached an ice wall and waited for the both of them to arrive. It then leaped over the ice wall.It was peculiar that the Snowball Monster disappeared once they reached the ice wall.\u201cCould this be a cover-up?\u201d Lin Huang said while taking a look at the ice wall. Unfortunately, there was nothing there; it was a completely empty space. He went deeper and as he moved a step forward\u2026It was a huge snow valley. It was like a hidden world within the Snowy Mountains.He was so stunned to the extent that he lost support and lost his balance. As soon as he regained his senses, he realized that Bai did not follow after him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait anymore. Only humans that I approve of can enter. Any other monsters are not allowed to enter.\u201d A deep, thick voice echoed.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Lin Huang looked around but he did not see the Snowball Monster.\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d He heard the voice once again, but it really was coming from the Snowball Monster.\u201cYou can speak!\u201d Lin Huang was shocked as he could not believe that a Snowball Monster could speak and better yet, it could speak in a human language! The voice was obviously the voice of a man.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d As soon as the Snowball Monster finished its sentence, it expanded like a balloon with hands and legs.In just a few seconds, the once cute monster that was only the size of a basketball now was a giant.That was a Yeti, with a height close to a hundred meters. It was covered in a thick white fur. He had a face structure that resembled humans. The only difference was that he grew a beard as white as snow!A Yeti was a type of snow monster. They were naturally born to be extremely strong and were extraordinary. The abilities of an adult Yeti far exceeded normal monsters that were of the same rank. Lin Huang could imagine exactly how strong the Yeti really was.\u201cYoung boy, I have no bad intention in bringing you here. I need your help\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A gush of wind pushed Lin Huang forward and he fell into the Yeti\u2019s palm. After Lin Huang was able to find his balance, the Yeti led Lin Huang to the inner part of the valley.There seemed to be an invisible protective layer surrounding the Yeti\u2019s as any snow that touched its skin would automatically disappear. Lin Huang realized that this world was indeed mysterious.The snow valley had a windy path.The Yeti spoke stories about his past while they walked.\u201cI could still clearly remember 700 years ago, I met a beautiful lady on a snowy day. I became her favorite monster. I was a Snowball Monster that knew nothing and had a muddled memory. I could only remember that she was a very gentle lady and she treated me well\u2026\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019ve become a mutated Snowball Monster, I slowly regained my memory. At that moment, I knew that she was not human but a monster like me. She was powerful to the point where she could not be identified by human knowledge and experience. She yearned to live as a human. Therefore, she tried to live amongst the humans in their world for a long time. One day, she told me that she fell in love with a man\u2026 I could still remember how happy she was and from that day onwards, she barely visited me\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, one day when she returned, she was covered with blood stains all over her body. She confided in me. She told me that the human, her lover had discovered her identity. They fell out of love and he betrayed her. He led a group of hunters to kill her but because she was powerful, she killed them all in anger except for that man.\u201d\u201cEver since then, she stayed in the valley and never left. Sometimes, she would carve the man\u2019s face on the ice. There were big and small ice sculptures with different facial expressions. She oftentimes stared blankly at them the whole day, reminiscing everything. She had also carved sculptures that gave her happy thoughts and had placed her favorite ice sculptures beside the lakes while she danced by the lake. It made her happy as she recalled that the man loved to see her dance\u2026\u201d\u201cSoon after, the man arrived at the valley, alone. She thought that the man had returned to look for her. As the man entered, he told her, \u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re the most precious protoss in the monster world. That was why you had a perfect human figure. Each protoss has a divine fire in their body. Now, if you truly love me, give it to me.\u201d\u201c..and do you know what her response was?\u201d The Yeti asked.Lin Huang shook his head. It was either a love story with either a happy or tragic ending.She said, \u201cI will give it to you for I am not trying to prove anything.\u201d\u201cShe tore her body apart and crumbled her own heart. She took the ice-blue ember out from within and threw it to the ground in front of the man\u2019s feet. He did not even bother to look at her or thank her. He instantly picked it up and left. He knew that without the ember of divinity, she was bound to die soon.\u201d\u201cHer body got weaker by each passing day. In less than a month, she could not get out of bed. After she died, she was buried in front of a small house by the lake. Her death caused the entire valley to turn into frozen, snow-covered land. If the love of her life dripped his or her blood onto the lake, the ice and snow covering the valley would melt and she would come back to life.\u201d\u201cShe sank to the bottom of the lake. Her blood spread throughout the lake and entered my body. I mutated for the second time and I became a Yeti ever since. After the mutation was complete, I regained my consciousness and saw that the whole valley had turned into this\u2026\u201dLin Huang saw a small house covered in snow at the end of the valley.\u201cSo you wanted to use my blood to see if I could bring her back to life?\u201d Lin Huang finally guessed the reason he was brought there.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cWhy did you choose me?\u201d Lin Huang hesitated.\u201cIt\u2019s because you have a good character. Not many people make it past the ice walls. You are the third person in seven hundred years.\u201d The Yeti answered.\u201cHow much of my blood do you need?\u201d\u201cOne drop would suffice.\u201d The Yeti said before adding, \u201cOnce the process is complete, I will let you go and if your blood is able to break the curse, I\u2019ll erase your memories of ever meeting me.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d Lin Huang was certain that probability of success was almost zero.\u201cThank you.\u201d The Yeti thanked him and led him toward the direction of the ice lake.Once at the lake, the Yeti stretched out his hand and Lin Huang stood onto it. The Yeti then placed him in the middle of the lake.Lin Huang took out a pocket knife and made a slight cut on his left index finger and a drop of blood oozed out.Nothing happened after the drop of blood fell into the lake. He then looked up at the Yeti and gave an apologetic head shake, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not the man of destiny that you\u2019re looking for\u2026\u201dSoon, the Yeti looked worried. There was a cracking sound beneath his feet and within a split second, the ice layer began to crack.It immediately took Lin Huang into its palm and retreated a few steps backward.The speed at which the ice cracked became faster. The ice began to melt and within a minute or so, the lake returned to its initial state with blue water from left to right.Soon, the snow covering the whole valley subsided and the thick clouds dispersed themselves, revealing the crescent moons that had not appeared for a long time. There were plants and flowers that began to grow!The snowy white world now turned into the rich greenery.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWas my blood so nutritious?\u201d Lin Huang sucked his wounded finger.In less than 10 minutes, the glacier valley regained its liveliness. The plants were flourishing and the scent of flowers was breathtaking.After observing the valley, Lin Huang noticed a crystal clear coffin floating to the surface of the lake from the bottom. Once it was at the surface, the coffin began to melt and a beautiful lady in a white dress emerged.Her face was still as if she was sleeping on the surface of the water. Slowly, her eyes opened and she slowly stood up on the lake.From afar, she saw Lin Huang and the Yeti. She smiled and walked towards them, her eyes assuring and her lips smiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It can be integrated into the Rare Monster Card of \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture Part 1\u201d. You have gained the complete set of \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture\u201d. Are you sure you would like to integrate the cards?\u201dLin Huang never knew that he could gain so many \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture\u201d pieces by just watching Xue Luo brew tea. It was enough for him to have a complete set of \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture\u201d.Lin Huang chose to integrate them at once!After a short while, the same notifications from Xiao Hei sounded once again.\u201cCongratulations, integration of cards is now complete. You have gained an Epic Skill Card \u2013 \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture.\u201dLin Huang looked closely at the Life Wheel in his body and checked the Skill card.The Skill card of \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture\u201d had become blue. The picture at the front remained the same but the message behind the card changed.\u201cSkill Card\u201d\u201cName of Skill: Great Sword Scripture\u201d\u201cRarity: Epic\u201d\u201cType of Skill: Sword\u201d\u201cSkill Level: Unavailable\u201d\u201cStatus: Available\u201d\u201cRemarks: This skill is a special skill and there is no rank limit. The power changes according to the user.\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: Passable\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve not brewed tea for many years. I\u2019m unfamiliar with it now.\u201d Luo Xue said sheepishly.\u201cMs. Xue Luo, your brewing tea skills are excellent. I have learned a lot from you.\u201d Lin Huang was able to gain Skill Card pieces by simply watching her make tea. This woman was amazing!Xue Luo instinctively poured Lin Huang another cup once he was done with the first.\u201cThe glacier valley must have been formed used spatial manipulation?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Xue Luo nodded.Lin Huang was actually quite curious about the protoss but he felt that it would be too soon to ask and decided to keep it for another time.Xue Luo sensed that Lin Huang was doubtful. She then said, \u201cMister, if there\u2019s anything you would like to ask, you can. I\u2019ll try my best to answer.\u201d\u201cI heard that you\u2019re the protoss. According to historical records, there was a monster that opened 3000 Virtual Eyes 800 years ago and everyone called him a protoss too. Can you tell me more about this?\u201d Lin Huang referred to an incident that happened 800 years ago.\u201cOh him. He was strong but was not considered a protoss. At most, he was a servant of God bestowed with the blood of the protoss.\u201d Xue Luo snorted.\u201cWe protoss were the true future generation of Gods. The protoss were born with perfect human figures and had the blood of God flowing in their veins. The fellow claimed himself to be the protoss but he did not have a perfect human figure.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t reveal much about the protoss though. Do you have any other questions besides this?\u201dLin Huang then began asking random questions about the past and Xue Luo did her best to assist with every one of his questions.Soon, Lin Huang had nothing more to ask. The living room became quiet.Xue Luo then took the initiative to start a new conversation. \u201cMister, please don\u2019t stay in the mountains for too long because I fear monsters may attack you.\u201d\u201cI do realize that monsters here are quite furious. Is there a specific reason for this?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cI just discovered that there was a transcendant monster in the underground desert. It seemed to be able to possess the mind of other monsters to hunt food for itself.\u201d Xue Luo explained.\u201cOh, I see. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll reach my destination after passing through the mountain.\u201d Lin Huang said with relief.\u201cAfter you leave, we\u2019ll also be returning back to our world.\u201d Xue Luo sighed, her eyes seemed sad.Bing Wang added, \u201cYes, there\u2019s no need to stay in the human world anymore.\u201dLin Huang was disappointed as they might never see each other again.\u201cI\u2019ll dance for you as a gift before you leave.\u201d Xue Luo suggested.\u201cMister, please follow me.\u201d She led Lin Huang and Bing Wang, levitating them in the sky.She slowly landed them beside the lake while she went to stand alone in the middle of the lake.Under the moonlight, her white dress was impossibly clean and pure. She looked like a fairy descended from heaven.It began to snow, ripples began forming on the lake. A thin layer of ice condensed beneath her feet and it looked like she stood on a white ring. It was indeed a breathtaking scene as she began moving her body in perfect harmony to the sounds of the wind hauling.\u201cPerhaps this was true, she was the goddess of the Alps\u2026\u201d Lin Huang thought. It was no secret that he had a deep affection for her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang had learned a lot from the dance. Her love, hatred, and all sorts of emotions she felt, the coldness and cruelty of death, as well as the hidden feeling of loneliness\u2026Xue Luo took slow steps towards Lin Huang when she finished her final scene. She looked pitiful. He did not see her as a protoss but instead, as an ordinary woman with a burst of emotions. He could not stop himself from saying, \u201cI believe that one day, you\u2019ll find your own happiness.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Xue Luo\u2019s eyes brightened.After saying goodbye to Xue Luo, Bing Wang sent Lin Huang out of the valley. It was now late at night.Lin Huang recalled Bai and summoned the Sand Monster. He then went back to his tent to rest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps it was the tea that kept him awake.The next day, it was nine o\u2019clock in the morning when he woke up.Lin Huang tidied up his things and ate breakfast. He then summoned Bai and continued with their journey.Xue Luo healed the broken Life Wheel. Lin Huang could feel the speed of lifespan loss significantly reduced and there was also a certain degree of improvement in his physique as well.Taking into account the improvement from his \u2018Robust\u2019 skill, Lin Huang felt that his physique was no longer weaker than other Reserve Hunters on iron-level.He was able to move a much faster speed than before.Within four hours, he had reached the height of 700 meters, which was 5,500 meters above sea level.Just before Lin Huang was able to take a rest, a flock of white big birds flew in their direction.Lin Huang could recognize them from far away; they were the White Feathered Goose. They were also a type of mutant. They would hunt for fishes as their main sources of food and would never provoke creatures bigger in size. However, they were not afraid of humans.Under normal circumstances, Lin Huang would have brushed their presence aside but because Xue Luo had told them to be careful, his guard was up.The White Feathered Goose was huge. It was around five meters wide when they expanded their wings. They were strong enough to snatch humans with their claws. They were probably controlled by the transcendant monster Xue Luo talked about, the monster that manipulated their minds to hunt for food.\u201cBai! Quickly, dig a hole!\u201d Lin Huang shouted.The flock of geese approaching them looked furious. He had to get himself a safe shelter. They were at a height around 5,000 meters above sea level but Lin Huang did not have wings to jump anywhere and if he lost balance and fell, he would most certainly die.As soon as Bai dug out a cave, Lin Huang stretched out his left hand to hang over the cliff while he held his GrayEagle17 in his right hand. He turned his body to attack the geese when they came close to him.Most of the White Feathered Goose were iron-level monsters. The specially made bullets for the GrayEagle17 only had an impact on their feathers. It failed to penetrate through to their bodies.After several shots, some of the White Feathered Goose groaned in pain but realized that the bullets could not injure them and so, they pounced on Lin Huang again.Bai already went into the hole but it was still a few meters away from Lin Huang. The hole was not deep and Bai could not dig any further.A few from the flock of White Feathered Goose fluttered their wings, getting into a position to catch Lin Huang. Lin Huang had nowhere to dodge and he watched helplessly as the claws emerged from their feet as they grabbed him.At that moment, blood splashed in the air. The White Feathered Goose that grabbed him had its head chopped in half, rolling over the cliff.Lin Huang felt something grabbing onto his waist tightly. As he looked down, he saw Bai\u2019s Blood Power layer pulling him toward the hole.Lin Huang tried to free himself but chose to trust Bai instead. He released his left hand which he used to hang from the cliff when he shot at the geese. As soon as he released his hand, he felt a strong force dragging him back into the cave.Lin Huang felt safe as soon as his body touched the ground of the cave.\u201cThanks.\u201d He said while he stood up in the cave and thanked Bai, nodding his head. He then walked out of the cave.The flock of White Feathered Goose had not left yet. They were all trying to squeeze into the cave as they saw Lin Huang when they saw Lin Huang\u2019s head pop out into the entrance of the cave.Lin Huang retreated a few steps back as it was not safe.Bai dug two meters wide and two meters long in the cave. It would be impossible for them to enter in with their huge body.However, the White Feathered Goose seemed to enjoy the torture because the more they pushed themselves in, the more they were injured by the sharp cave edges.The geese were persistent. Even after two to three hours, they remained outside the cave and as time passed by, the number of geese increased.\u201cDamn! Are they blocking my way out?!\u201d Lin Huang was suddenly struck by the thought. There were incidents about humans being bullied by geese. There were many videos uploaded online and though they were funny at the time, he had never expected this to happen to him on a cliff in a dire situation, instead of a funny one.Lin Huang had a slight headache. The GrayEagle17 was ineffective against the flock of White Feathered Goose and to make matters worse, he was down to his last four bullets. It was not enough to kill the geese.Though Bai was capable of upgrading itself to use its Blood Power to kill them, its Blood Power could only reach a distance of fewer than 20 meters which was not far enough to reach the outside of the cave.They waited for another three hours and as the skies outside became darker; Lin Huang took a glance outside the cave to check on the flock of White Feathered Goose. Unfortunately, his initial predictions were right, they were still there.\u201cIt seemed like they were not going anywhere. If they are blocking my way, how am I going to complete my assessment?\u201d Lin Huang pondered.All of a sudden, he shifted his gaze to the inner parts of the cave. \u201cFoothold No.7D121 is located at the other side at the foot of the Alps. Does this mean that if we dig deeper to the other side of the Alps, we could eventually reach the foothold using the pathway through this cave?!\u201dA growling sound came from the direction of the flock of White Feathered Goose, interrupting Lin Huang\u2019s thoughts.Lin Huang popped his head silently out of the cave to catch of glimpse of what was happening. Over hundreds of geese escaped once a black giant bird flying began approaching them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang recognized it, it was a giant known as the Black Cliff Sparrow.Its body was around 30 meters long and its wings were 50 meters wide fully open. It was a gigantic monster that was much bigger than Tyrant.Based on its size alone, it almost reached bronze-level.The flock of White Feathered Goose was no longer in sight. The Black Cliff Sparrow did not attack but instead used its sharp claws, to hold onto the upper part of the cave entrance before taking a peek into the cave.Lin Huang and the Black Cliff Sparrow came face to face\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It opened its mouth and attempted to peck at Lin Huang\u2019s eyes as they locked eyes earlier.Lin Huang retreated immediately to the center of the cave and immediately reloaded armored bullets into his GrayEagle17.He pointed the gun at the cave entrance, waiting to open fire.The Black Cliff Sparrow\u2019s tough beak hit hard on top of the cliff and a small part of the cliff collapsed causing the top of the cave entrance to be exposed.Lin Huang could feel the entire cave shaking. \u201cBai, when the sparrow approaches, lock onto on its head and aim at its eyes!\u201d Lin Huang had a plan.Its eyes were the weakest part of its body but it was covered in feathers and so, it was difficult to hit its eyes accurately.The possibility of killing it with only one armored bullet was slim but Lin Huang wanted to shoot at its eyes with his remaining four bullets at one go for maximum impact.The Black Cliff Sparrow realized that the cave was not so tough as it managed to crack a hole with one hit and so it started to peck at it continuously. After several pecks at the top of the cave, almost half of the wall collapsed. Although Lin Huang and Bai had retreated into the cave, the Black Cliff Sparrow could see them from where it stood and began to peck even faster.Suddenly, just when it got a chance to move closer, two strings Blood Power shot out from the cave. They resembled two ropes strangling the sparrow\u2019s neck while bashing its head into the wall.The Black Cliff Sparrow struggled and Lin Huang took that opportunity to quickly step forward before it could run away. Lin Huang aimed his gun at its left eye and fired four shots continuously.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u201dThe Black Cliff Sparrow\u2019s left eye exploded, it stopped fighting back and collapsed.The strings of Blood Power were then released from its neck and the Black Cliff Sparrow slowly fell from the cliff.Xiao Hei\u2019s notification popped up in front of Lin Huang.\u201cCongratulations, you have received Black Cliff Sparrow Monster Card pieces x1\u201d\u201cYou have completed a cross-ranking kill, you are rewarded with a Double Card!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no Advance Card for the cross-ranking kill this time?\u201d Lin Huang recalled that he was rewarded Advance Card for the previous two cross-ranking kills.\u201cReward cards are usually randomly given. It was rather peculiar that you received Advance Cards twice in a row.\u201d\u201cIt would be great if I could get a few more Advance Cards to upgrade both Bai and Tyrant into mythical brings. Bing Wang only mutated twice and he was so powerful! Bai and Tyrant would be invincible if they were to be upgraded four times!\u201d\u201cThe ability of Summon Cards are limited by the host. If the host\u2019s ability remained the same, no matter how rare the card is, the upgraded monster\u2019s ability would be limited as well.\u201dWhat Xiao Hei indirectly meant was the weakness of Lin Huang\u2019s monsters were actually caused by him.Lin Huang ignored Xiao Hei and looked at the Double Card that he just received.Images of two piles of gold coins were at the top of the card.Lin Huang frowned and flipped the card over.\u201cDouble Card: Within an hour this card\u2019s activation, the reward for killing monsters will double.\u201d\u201cNothing great about this card but perhaps I could use this card to collect more card pieces when I meet some monster that I like.\u201d Lin Huang mumbled to himself.He then took out the clip from his GrayEagle17, it was empty, \u201cAhh, I should\u2019ve bought more bullets.\u201dAfter he reloaded the gun with regular bullets, he then kept the gun in his space storage.The sky was getting dark. Bai began to dig deeper into the cave so that they could stay the night.As the cave was too small, Lin Huang could not summon the Sand Monster, and Bai would have to watch the night.Lin Huang had a good night sleep and woke up around seven o\u2019clock in the morning.Their journey was delayed due to their encounter with the flock of White Feathered Goose yesterday afternoon.He had dried meat and some water in the morning before starting the journey with Bai.Lin Huang was had good stamina this morning and managed to climb 800 meters within five hours.After a short rest, he continued his journey before noon. Six hours later, he managed to climb more than 900 meters. He had already traveled 7,200 meters, and now, he was only 1,000 meters away from the top.Lin Huang rested for a night before his last push. Finally, after eight hours, he arrived at the top, which was 8,800 meters above sea level.\u201cAhh! I\u2019m finally here on top!\u201d Lin Huang shouted on top of the Snowy Mountains.Just when he was at the peak of his excitement, he was greeted by a voice that came from behind him, \u201cIt\u2019s just the Snowy Mountains, do you need to shout?\u201dLin Huang turned around and saw a young man with short hair in trench coat stood behind him.He looked the same age as Lin Huang, but taller\u201cWho are you?\u201d Lin Huang wondered before he asked, \u201cAre you from the Hunter Association?\u201d\u201cI joined the assessment just like you.\u201d The short-haired man answered, expressionless.\u201cWere you the one who opened fire down there two days ago?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d Lin Huang admitted and curiously asked, \u201cHow is it possible that you\u2019re faster than me? How did you get here?\u201d\u201cI arrived here on the first day by riding the Black Cliff Sparrow; it only took two hours.\u201d The short-hair man looked at Lin Huang and said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, you killed the Black Cliff Sparrow. Is that true?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re an Imperial Censor as well? Why do you want to attack me?\u201d Lin Huang grew anxious.\u201cIt\u2019s simple; I don\u2019t want anyone else to pass this assessment apart from myself. That\u2019s why I have been waiting here to get the Black Cliff Sparrow to attack everyone who attempted to climb the Snowy Mountains so that you guys would give up but since you\u2019re already up here, it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to wait here anymore.\u201d The man then turned around and walked to a tent that was not too far away. He proceeded to say solemnly, \u201cI will take revenge for the Black Cliff Sparrow, but now is not the time. You have cultivated a great vampire, but you\u2019re too weak, you don\u2019t deserve to be attacked by me yet.\u201dThe man then kept his tent, waved his hand and a blood color giant bird appeared out of thin air.Lin Huang was envious. It was a Crimson Eagle, a bronze-level mutated monster.The short-haired man leaped onto the back of the Crimson Eagle. It flapped its wings and dove towards the bottom of the cliff\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that his Blood Power was at level-2, his wings were five meters long on each side and they would expend to a maximum of 20 meters in combat mode. They were not heavy, both of them were slightly over 100 kilograms put together.Lin Huang spent some time to fold his tent into a strip of cloth and strapped himself in front of Bai. He then activated Bai\u2019s combat mode, walked towards the cliff and leaned forward, falling off the cliff.The Blood Power wings on Bai\u2019s spread open.Lin Huang felt the pull of gravity but within a few moments, they began to glide. As he looked down, all he saw were layers of clouds.Soon they passed through the clouds and Lin Huang could see the Snowy Mountains from beyond the horizon.The mountains and rivers beneath him seemed so much smaller from the top. Even the foothold was the size of his palm.\u201cThis is what I\u2019m talking about! Woohoo!\u201dAlthough he looked ridiculous as a passenger strapped onto Bai, Lin Huang screamed at the top of his lungs because he was extremely excited. He had always wanted to try extreme sports like parachuting when he was on earth but he never got the opportunity to do so.He finally got the chance to experience it in this world instead.As they got closer to the ground, he could feel his adrenaline skyrocket. \u201cNow, I finally understand why people love flying in the air, this feels amazing!\u201dThey did not glide for too long. Within 10 minutes, both of them arrived in the vicinity of foothold No.7D121.Bai wrapped his wings above them to form an umbrella and they slowed down as they gently landed. Pedestrians were frightened by the Blood Power wings on Bai\u2019s back because they could recognize he was a vampire.\u201cYou can leave now, I\u2019ll report to the Hunter Association.\u201d Lin Huang did not want to upset people so he recalled Bai. The cloth that strapped him to Bai was automatically removed. He then picked the piece of cloth up and threw it into the dustbin beside him.He then activated his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring.The ring\u2019s function was restored as promised. Lin Huang opened the map and found the hotel where Yi Yeyu was at and proceeded to walk in the direction of the hotel.10 minutes later, Lin Huang arrived at the entrance of the hotel and walked to the reception.The receptionist was a tall and beautiful lady. Seeing Lin Huang walk in, she professionally asked, \u201cHi sir, how may I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for Miss Yi Yeyu, could you get her for me please?\u201d\u201cSure, please give me a minute.\u201d The lady receptionist tried to reach Yi Yeyu\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring at once.She then informed Lin Huang, \u201cYou can look for her in Room 308.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you.\u201d Lin Huang thought it was strange that she was in Room 308, it was the same room Tyrant destroyed.He went directly to Room 308 and saw that the door was already opened.Lin Huang closed the door after himself and noticed the same big hole in the room\u2019s ceiling. He asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you change to another room?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much trouble; I\u2019m leaving in a few days anyway.\u201d The hole in the ceiling did not bother Yi Yeyu at all. Instead, she was looking at Lin Huang, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be the first one to complete the assessment. Although it took you a good seven days with your physique, I\u2019m impressed. I thought you\u2019d take more than a week to climb the Snowy Mountains.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the first one who completed the assessment?\u201d Lin Huang asked in confusion, \u201cWasn\u2019t there another guy who passed the assessment before I did? He hasn\u2019t reported to you?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re the first one.\u201d Yi Yeyu shook her head.\u201cThat can\u2019t be, that guy got down from the Snowy Mountains before I did. The guy wore a red trench coat, had short hair and was very arrogant. Oh, he\u2019s also an Imperial Censor just like me. The monster he summoned was a bronze-level Crimson Eagle.\u201d Lin Huang described the guy for Yeyu.\u201cOh, I know who you are talking about.\u201d Yi Yeyu nodded and explained, \u201cThe guy you\u2019re talking about is Bai Yan. He\u2019s special, he does not have to participate in the assessment but instead, he chose to. He would be a Copper Hunter after he registers with Hunter Association.\u201d\u201cHas Bai Yan arrived at this foothold? Did you see him just now?\u201d Yi Yeyu asked Lin Huang.\u201cI met him on top of the Snowy Mountains, he rode on the monster he summoned down the Snowy Mountains.\u201d\u201cThen I have no idea where he is, he didn\u2019t report to me. You\u2019re the first one.\u201d Yi Yeyu shook her head.\u201cOh yea, miss head-examiner, do you know what happened to Fatty, the other guy who was with me the other day?\u201d Lin Huang was worried when he asked the question. He was worried that the answer what not what he wanted to hear.\u201cOh, Fatty quit.\u201d Yi Yeyu rolled her eyes and told Lin Huang what happened.\u201cI received a rescue alert on that day and saw him crying on the ground when I followed the signal to his location. I asked him what happened. He said you were eaten by an Undead Worm for saving his life and he begged me to kill the Undead Worm to avenge you. After I brought him back to the foothold, he rode an eagle and left on that day itself.\u201dLin Huang was relieved after hearing that Fatty was still alive, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I thought he was dead.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe have his contact information, if you\u2019d like to contact him, you can have his contact details.\u201d Yi Yeyu was searching for Fatty\u2019s contact details as she spoke.\u201cOh his name is Yin Hangyi, I kept calling him Fatty and forgot his real name\u2026\u201d Lin Huang tapped open his detailed information and added his contact number to his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring.\u201cThere\u2019s still one more week until the assessment ends. You can leave if you\u2019re occupied; just remember to register yourself at the Hunter Association at foothold No.7C87. You\u2019ll have to register by this year or else you\u2019ll have to get reassessed next year. If you don\u2019t have urgent matters to attend to, you can stay in this foothold temporarily.

Your stay and food will be covered by the Hunter Association.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201dHe decided to stay because he had told Lin Xin that the assessment would take half a month and everything at home had been arranged.

The widest one faced the north-south and was a few hundred kilometers long. East of these canyons were vast grasslands surrounded by mountains and 3,000 meters below sea level was a grade-1 wild zone.This was a people-prone area and therefore there were very few monsters for fear that they will be killed by humans. Lin Huang looked at the categories of monsters in each area one by one.\u201cThe wild zone further away from the Snowy Mountain housed bird monsters. There were fewer flatlands there though which were not suitable for me to train to prepare for real battles.\u201d\u201cMeanwhile, the monsters in the canyons came from the grassland and Snowy Mountains but were killed by people passing by and because of that, I can\u2019t collect more Monster Card pieces.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the grassland on the east side is most suitable for me.\u201d\u201cWarrior Wolf would be a great prey; I could obtain Monster Card pieces faster from monsters that live in a pack. It would look so much cooler and comfortable if I rode on it instead of the Sand Monster. The Lion-Headed Troll too! It was such a majestic monster. The Ox Devil isn\u2019t too bad; it\u2019s muscular and huge enough that its appearance alone was sufficient to scare people away\u2026\u201d\u201cSkill-wise, the Warrior Wolf\u2019s Blood Battle, the Lion-Headed Troll\u2019s Magic Eye Deterrence and Ox Devil\u2019s Champion Strength are all good\u2026\u201d After some analysis, Lin Huang had decided which area was most suitable for him.The next morning, Lin Huang went to the Credit Bureau; it belonged to the government. It only opened at nine o\u2019clock in the morning so there was no need for him to rush.He took a stroll in the garden at the bureau\u2019s entrance since it was not time yet.When it did open, Lin Huang walked right in and traded all his Life Crystals into credit points. Now he had more than 3.5 million credit points. The Life Crystals were taken from Xue Jie earlier.After that, Lin Huang headed to the flea market.The flea market in the Snowy Mountain Town was located at the center of the foothold. It was not big but there were many shops, up to 1,000 of them.They had almost everything there including food ingredients, daily necessities, guns and ammunition and swords.Perhaps the area was surrounded by a wild zone; there were more than 30 shops here that were selling battle equipment while the foothold that Lin Huang stayed only had three of them.Ling Huang\u2019s purpose here was mainly to look for the exclusive bullets for his GrayEagle17, armored bullets, and equipment to survive the wilderness since he planned to stay in the wild zone for a week.After asking around, he was told that none of the seven to eight shops were selling exclusive bullets and armored bullets for his GrayEagle17. This new \u2018royalty\u2019 gun was not used by many ordinary people, so this small foothold would not have the right stock of bullets for such a gun. Especially the armored bullets, they were expensive and so it did not make sense for the shops to keep stocks.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the bullets that you\u2019re looking for. In a small area like this, we don\u2019t see anyone who carries GrayEagle17 in a year. You can try Old Zhang\u2019s grocery store at the west side of the city. That fella collects strange things. If there\u2019s none at his store, then you won\u2019t be able to find it anywhere else. But be careful, that fella is sly and he would double or triple the original price.\u201d A shop owner reminded Lin Huang. He gave Lin Huang valuable advice because he thought Lin Huang was rich as he could afford a GrayEagle17.After purchasing everything he needed at the flea market, Lin Huang asked around a few more times for the bullets and finally, he gave up. He hesitated for a while and headed to the west of the city.Old Zhang\u2019s store was located in an alley where nobody visited. Theoretically, even a shop in the flea market could not make much money in this small foothold and yet, Old Zhang opened his shop in such a secluded area, he must be weird.After asking a couple of people, Lin Huang finally found the exact location of the store.The plaque with a bright neon light on the outside of the door had the words \u2018Cloud\u2019s End\u2019 written on it, Lin Huang laughed. This weird old man must be full of himself.He stepped into the shop, it was not as messy as he imagined. On the contrary, it was very organized.All the items were placed accordingly on the shelves, even the decorations were tasteful.Lin Huang was stunned.\u201cIs the owner in?\u201d Lin Huang did not call the owner\u2019s name as that seen as rude. He considered himself a good, respectful kid to never call an elder by their first name.\u201cIf you need anything, look on the shelves yourselves. When you are done, bring it over here and call me.\u201d Lin Huang heard someone talking, but he did not see anyone. The voice sounded more like a middle-aged man than an old man\u2019s voice.\u201cThis feels like markets on earth\u2026\u201d Lin Huang mumbled.Sensing that Old Zhang did not want to be bothered, Lin Huang did not ask further and walked to the shelf where the firearms were placed.He frowned while he glanced through the guns on the shelf.There was equipment from iron-level to gold-level, and all of them were pricey and limited edition stuff.\u201cIt seems to me that this Old Zhang is rich!\u201dAfter glancing through, Lin Huang did not waste any more time. He looked towards the bullets placed under the guns and found the exclusive bullets and armored bullets for his GrayEagle17.There was only a sample box. Lin Huang took one box each for both bullets and went to the counter at the entrance.\u201cBoss, I\u2019ve taken what I wanted but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s me take a look.\u201dA middle-aged bald man with a beard walked in. He was tan, and he looked like he was in his 40\u2019s, but he may look much younger if he shaved his beard.Lin Huang did not doubt that he was the shop owner. Although he looked ordinary, his vibe matched the shop very well.What Lin Huang did not understand was why people would call him \u2018old\u2019 when he was not old.Old Zhang glanced at Lin Huang and looked at the bullets that he selected, his eyes lighten up, \u201cOh you\u2019re from a rich family, how much do you want?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not rich; this gun is a gift.\u201d Lin Huang did not wish to be ripped off by him, so he explained,\u201cHow much are these bullets?\u201d\u201cThe same prices as you see on the Heart Network.\u201d Old Zhang smiled.Lin Huang was confused. He heard that Old Zhang was a rip-off because he doubled or even tripled the original price.Now that he offered the original price, he started to think that the bullets might be pirated.\u201cThese bullets are original right?\u201d\u201cWhy, did you hear somebody saying that I am a rip-off where I double or triple the original price?\u201d Old Zhang smiled and looked at Lin Huang.Lin Huang was stunned but he did not want to hide, \u201cSomeone did say that.\u201d\u201cNo matter who told you that, it\u2019s true. I love doing that but it depends on my mood. I like you, so I\u2019m selling them to you at the original price, it\u2019s that simple.\u201d After that, Old Zhang added, \u201cThe bullets are original. It\u2019s up to you if you want to buy them.\u201dLin Huang looked into Old Zhang eyes. They locked eyes for a moment. He could sense that the old man was not lying so he nodded and said, \u201cOkay, I trust you. I want 3000 exclusive bullets for my GrayEagle17 and 300 armored bullets.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAre you planning a massacre?\u201d Old Zhang was shocked and he gave him a price, \u201cThat\u2019ll be a total of 650,000 credit points.\u201d\u201cDo you have enough stock here?\u201d Lin Huang could not help but ask.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have plenty! No matter what you want and how much you want, I have them. As long as you have the money, I can get you whatever relics you want.\u201d Old Zhang grinned.If that came from someone else, Lin Huang would not believe. But after browsing through Old Zhang\u2019s collection, he believed that Old Zhang could get whatever he wanted although he sounded boastful.\u201cSure, if I need any relics in the future, I\u2019ll look for you!\u201d Lin Huang returned the grin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just when he was near the exit of the foothold, his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring vibrated, someone was calling him.It was a number that he did not recognize, he hesitated before picking up.\u201cIs this Lin Huang? I am Yi Yeyu, where are you now?\u201d Yi Yeyu\u2019s voice came from the communication page.\u201cI\u2019m still in the foothold and ready to head off to the grassland for some battle training.\u201d Lin Huang was in doubt, why would Yi Yeyu call him, \u201cIs there anything that I could help you?\u201d\u201cPlease stay in the foothold for these few days. According to some hunters who just came back to the foothold, the monsters outside of the foothold were oddly furious. The same thing happened to the monsters in the desert, many people who participated in the assessment were attacked by the monsters. I have been receiving more and more rescue alerts. If the situation gets worse, we might need to end the assessment early.\u201dHearing what Yi Yeyu said, Lin Huang recalled what Xue Luo said earlier.There was a new transcendent monster that was an expert in the wilderness. He could not tell Yi Yeyu that as he could not reveal the source.After some thought, he said, \u201cActually I encountered similar attacks before I climbed the Snowy Mountains a few days back. You know that my monster is an iron-level rank-3 and a Sand Monster that\u2019s at the edge of a breakthrough. Most of the monsters in the desert would stay far away from us. However, the day before I climbed the Snowy Mountains, there were monsters that plunged towards me and my Sand Monster along the journey, they were angry and restless. We encountered the situation a couple of times, I think the monsters were either hypnotized or bewildered\u2026\u201dAlthough he could not tell the truth directly, Lin Huang attempted to guide Yi Yeyu to get the gist of it.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that there\u2019s a high-level monster which is the mastermind behind all this?\u201d Yi Yeyu thought what Lin Huang said made sense, but she was puzzled, \u201cIt\u2019s possible if one area of the wild zone is affected, but the desert the assessment was conducted in was more than 1,000 kilometers away from the grassland on the east side. Even if it was a gold-rank charm-class monster, it\u2019s impossible that it could be able to cover such distance.\u201d\u201cWhat if it was a charm-class monster that\u2019s more than gold-rank?\u201d Lin Huang told the truth.Yi Yeyu was stunned when she heard what Lin Huang, she took a while and said, \u201cDo you mean\u2026 transcendent?\u201d\u201cThat could be possible.\u201d Lin Huang said.Yi Yeyu kept quiet for some time and said, \u201cAlright, I believe you this time! I will report to the management and see what they say.\u201dAfter Lin Huang hung up the phone, he decided to go back to the hotel to wait for a response. If the management of Hunter Association did not take this seriously, the transcendent monster would do whatever it wanted to and there would be more and more prey falling into its trap.By then, there would be unimaginable damage to the footholds nearby.He then headed back to the hotel. Just when he was at the hotel\u2019s entrance, Yi Yeyu called again.\u201cI\u2019m at the hotel\u2019s entrance, we\u2019ll talk soon.\u201d Lin Huang hung up the phone and went straight to Yi Yeyu\u2019s room.Yi Yeyu stood at the living room, she looked upset. She was slightly relieved when she saw Lin Huang.\u201cI have reported the situation to the management, they said there is a high possibility that it was done by a transcendent charm-class monster. However, the transcendent who was guarding foothold No.7C87 was not there at the moment. The association would need at least three days to transfer another transcendent here.\u201d\u201cI have informed all the members that the assessment is temporarily suspended and got all of them to activate their location while waiting for support whenever they are. The problem is that we are lacking assistance now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d Lin Huang asked instantly.\u201cI will need you to stay in the hotel lobby. When we bring people over, I\u2019ll need your help to arrange for their accommodation and make sure things are okay. Don\u2019t let them leave the foothold; even riding the Eagle might not be safe right now. If they have any questions, don\u2019t tell them the truth as we want to avoid an uproar. I\u2019ll talk to them when I\u2019m back.\u201d Yi Yeyu could not find anyone else to help, so she asked Lin Huang.\u201cSure, I will make sure everything is well.\u201d Lin Huang answered straight away.\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201cNot at the moment. I\u2019ll look for you again if I need further assistance.\u201d Yi Yeyu said and summoned the green wooden door, \u201cI\u2019m going to bring the people back, please go to the lobby.\u201dLooking at Yi Yeyu entering the green wooden door, Lin Huang turned around and left.Not long later, Yi Yeyu was already with a tall lady at the lobby. She entered the green wooden door and disappeared without saying anything.The lady was slightly taller than Lin Huang, she looked to be 16 or 17 and was quite matured.She dressed like a hippy; wearing a white t-shirt with a short denim skirt and a pair of white sneakers.\u201cHi, my name is Lin Huang. I\u2019m the temporary receptionist.\u201d Lin Huang said to the lady.\u201cI recognize you, you\u2019re the fella who joined the assessment, and you\u2019re not even an iron-level!\u201d The tall lady could recognize Lin Huang.\u201cI\u2019ll bring you to register your room.\u201d Lin Huang changed the topic; he did not expect her to recognize him.\u201cI\u2019m not staying. Since the assessment has been suspended, I should not waste my time here. I\u2019m going to foothold No.7C65 to join the next assessment.\u201d The lady was on her way to the hotel exit.Lin Huang blocked her way using his hand, \u201cYou cannot leave.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? I\u2019m leaving, what can you do about it?\u201d The lady placed her hands on her hips and stared at Lin Huang.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d Lin Huang stood where he was.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Who do you think you are?\u201d The lady raised her voice. Many people in the lobby looked at the both of them.\u201cSay whatever you want to say, you\u2019re not allowed to leave.\u201d Lin Huang did not move at all.\u201cWow, you\u2019re saying like you can stop me from leaving!\u201d The lady was mad, \u201cScoot! If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t blame me for being rude.\u201d\u201cYou can try.\u201d Lin Huang had GrayEagle17 on his hand.\u201cDo you think having a gun is everything?\u201dThe lady scoffed and attempted to grab his gun. Lin Huang was faster than her so he pointed the muzzle at her head.\u201cYou dare shoot me?\u201d The human body was incomparable with the monster.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe lady was only an iron-level rank-2, if she were to be shot by his GrayEagle17 at such a short distance, her head would explode. However, she remained stubborn.Lin Huang shifted his target slightly to the right and pulled the trigger. The bullet flew by her ear and hit the vase in the hotel lobby.The case exploded.Before the lady could respond, he shifted aim back at the lady\u2019s head.The lady turned pale and dared not say a word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d The man saw that Lin Huang ignored him and started to get mad.\u201cThis is none of your business.\u201dLin Huang stared at the young man, he looked irritated.He then realized that the man was not a real hero, but he wanted to impress the pretty lady that Lin Huang had his gun pointed at. If it were an ugly lady, he would not pretend to be a hero.\u201cYou\u2019re committing a crime in public, that\u2019s my business.\u201d The young man said as he meant it. The crowd that was watching nodded and agreed with what the young man said.\u201cLook at you sugar-coating your act just because she\u2019s pretty. If she was ugly, I bet you wouldn\u2019t step up to me.\u201d Lin Huang revealed what the man was really up to.Busted, the man\u2019s cheeks were flushing. He denied, \u201cI\u2019m doing this for justice. I would step up no matter who it is!\u201d\u201cYou can stand whenever you want to stand, as long as you\u2019re not bothering me.\u201d Lin Huang ignored him.\u201cWow, you sure are arrogant\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a person walked out of the crowd. He was handsome with distinct features; he wore a red trench coat.Hearing that voice, Lin Huang turned around and looked at the person.He was the guy, Bai Yan that he met on top of the Snowy Mountains.Lin Huang did not have a good impression of him. They locked eyes, he did not want to give up, \u201cWhat, do you have something to say?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve a fight from me.\u201d Bai Yan grinned.He waved his hand, five meters tall Lion-Headed Troll was summoned.It looked majestic where the male lion\u2019s head almost touched the hotel hall\u2019s ceiling.The golden mane on its neck was shining in the yellow light. It was extraordinary.It held a giant blade in its right hand; its body was releasing a bloody smell.\u201cLion Head, toss him out.\u201d Bai Yan instructed while pointing at Lin Huang.Lin Huang was admiring the troll but he responded immediately. He summoned Bai and commanded, \u201cBai, chop off his hands!\u201dBai activated his combat mode and the Blood Power wings grew from his back.That moment, people realized that the silver-haired man that appeared was a monster. They were impressed as it was not easy to see an Imperial Censor on regular days. Now that there were two of them and they were fighting, it was a rare situation. Some of them even launched the video recording function on their Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring to record the battle and upload to the Heart Network.Before Bai moved, a female voice was heard coming from the crowd, \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201dYi Yeyu came out of the crowd to the center of the battlefield and pushed the Lion-Headed Troll and Bai apart.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d Yi Yeyu looked at Lin Huang.He kept the GrayEagle17 that he was holding. Just when he wanted to speak, the lady accused him,\u201d Miss head examiner, he bullied me when you were not around. Fortunately, this Imperial Censor came to my aid.\u201dThe lady only brought up Bai Yan, she did not even look at the man that attempted to help her earlier.\u201cTalk to me, Lin Huang.\u201d Yi Yeyu was doubtful, but she did not believe what the lady said.\u201cShe insisted that she wanted to leave but she didn\u2019t want to listen to me so I had to use my weapon to keep her here. Bai Yan arrived later and wanted to attack me out of nowhere so I\u2019m just defending myself.\u201d Lin Huang explained the situation simply.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Yi Yeyu looked at the lady in all seriousness. Compared to her, she believed what Lin Huang said more.The lady saw Yi Yeyu\u2019s expression and she dared not lie anymore.\u201cThere should be a surveillance camera in the hotel. If you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve said, you can take a look at the camera.\u201d Lin Huang added.The lady turned pale, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I should\u2019ve waited patiently\u2026\u201d\u201cBai Yan, you attacked before you figured out what was happening. You are at fault too, apologize!\u201d Yi Yeyu looked at Bai Yan.\u201cI refuse to. The weak don\u2019t deserve to be respected. I\u2019ll wait until the day he\u2019s stronger than me.\u201d Bai Yan said and glared at Lin Huang, he turned around and left.Yi Yeyu was unhappy, but she did not flip. She then turned around and said to the lady and a young man that she just brought back, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous outside of this foothold within these few days, both of you listen to Lin Huang, assist him in managing the rest, don\u2019t let anyone leave this foothold. I will explain the details of the situation when everyone is here.\u201dThe both of them nodded immediately.\u201cYou did great. If you encounter any obstacles again, you have my authorization to use violence. You can beat them up, as long as you don\u2019t kill them!\u201d Yi Yeyu said to Lin Huang and stared at the duo before she left via the green wooden door.After Yi Yeyu left, the duo remained quiet.Lin Huang waved to recall Bai and said to the duo, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the both of you to register your rooms. Then you\u2019ll both go to your rooms on your own; I have to stay here to wait for the rest.\u201dAfter the three of them completed registration, the lady went to her room while the young man stayed.\u201cYou are Lin Huang, am I right? I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019re an Imperial Censor.\u201d The young man introduced himself, \u201cMy name is Shen Qiang, I\u2019m also one of the members who joined the Reserve Hunter assessment.\u201d\u201cHi.\u201d Lin Huang nodded.\u201cFrom what I know, it\u2019s rare that the assessment would be suspended. Since you came back earlier, you should know something. Why was the assessment suspended out of nowhere?\u201d Shen Qiang asked curiously.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, all I heard was there was something strange happening to the monsters near the foothold. We would have to wait for the head examiner to explain the details to us.\u201d Lin Huang did not tell the truth.\u201cOh, is that so. I see that the head examiner got you to help her, I thought you would have some insider news.\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re lacking helpers so since I got back early, here I am.\u201d Lin Huang explained.\u201cCan I help?\u201d Shen Qian\u2019s offer was not genuine. Instead, he thought the head examiner would give him extra marks for the assessment if she saw him helping.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNot at the moment, as long as you don\u2019t leave this foothold, that would be a great help.\u201d Lin Huang felt helpless; he knew that there would be more people who would act like that lady earlier.\u201cWe can\u2019t even go to the grade-1 wild zone at the border?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Lin Huang shook his head, \u201cIf you have too much time during these next two days, you can shop at the flea market or have fun activities in the foothold.\u201d\u201cNothing is restricted as long as I stay in this foothold?\u201d Shen Qiang tried his luck.\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t leave the foothold, no matter what you do, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d Lin Huang said with absolute confidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were at least iron-level rank-2, some of them were even iron-level rank-3.To make matters worse, they were unhappy when they found out that they had to listen to Lin Huang\u2019s orders for the next two days. It seemed ridiculous to them because Lin Huang was not even iron-level.Not knowing what else to do, Lin Huang summoned Tyrant to beat some of them up when they disobeyed him. Only then would they listen to him.Although Lin Huang did not have powerful abilities, his identity as an Imperial Censor was a rare enough occupation for others to fear him as soon as they found out. When some of them heard that he had two monsters and he was a genius by Imperial Censor standards, they had to bite the bullet and listen to him regardless of the what they thought.Meanwhile, Yi Yeyu was even busier. There was a limit to the summoning of her green wooden door, and she could only use it 10 times per day. There were 70 to 80 people who were not disqualified since the assessment started and they were scattered in different locations on the map.She had to get the staff to gather the members who were close to each other and bring them all back within three days.Yi Yeyu rented the meeting room on the hotel\u2019s first floor and gathered all the participants there.Seeing that some of them were badly beaten, she knew it was Lin Huang\u2019s doing to get them to listen to him. As everyone showed up, Yi Yeyu now had a better impression of Lin Huang and his methods.After quick glances to ensure everyone in the room was in fact not hurt too severely, she started to speak.\u201cI bet you all have many questions with regards to what has happened the past few days, about why I have gathered all of you here and why you are not allowed you to leave. Let me explain the reason now. Please do not be worried.\u201d\u201cThis is what happened. We noticed that the monsters from the desert area to the grassland on the east of Snowy Mountains Town which covers a few thousand kilometers have been acting strangely for the past few days. They have been savagely attacking humans, and are unafraid to fight to the death. After some investigation, we think there is a possibility that a transcendent monster from a with abilities to charm other monsters has appeared nearby,\u201d she said calmly.Everyone was shocked when they heard what Yi Yeyu said.A transcendent monster was no joke. The reason why a C-grade medium foothold needed a transcendent to guard the foothold was the existence of other transcendent monsters.A transcendent monster could lead an army monsters and destroy a medium foothold with a population of millions of people, within a night.\u201cHowever\u2026 Don\u2019t worry. The association has sent us a transcendent human. He should be here sometime today. He will investigate the situation in the areas nearby and look for the cause of this unusual occurrence. When the problem is solved, I will talk to the management authorities to get the assessment going or perhaps pass everyone who was halfway through the assessment. That said, please be patient and wait inside the foothold,\u201d she said. By the instant ease of tension in the room, Yi Yeyu\u2019s words had comforted the people.Everyone was here with the goal of becoming a Reserve Hunter. It would be like striking a jackpot win for them if the management was to pass all of them straight away.In reality, the Hunter Association was not very strict with the Reserve Hunter\u2019s assessment.It was the head examiner who set the assessment content and standard.The passing rate made no difference to the association. But with the situation very different to the way protocol dictated, Yi Yeyu filed a report with the management.Everyone calmed down after what Yi Yeyu had said.However, there were a few people who raised their hands with questions. \u201cIf this foothold is not safe, can\u2019t we just ride eagles and get to other footholds?\u201d\u201cIt might not be safe to ride on the eagles now,\u201d Yi Yeyu explained.\u201cI was attacked by a flock of White Feathered Goose when I was climbing the mountains. Although an Eagle is most definitely faster than the geese, if it was surrounded by a flock of those geese, the possibility of escape would be nearly impossible,\u201d Lin Huang said, on behalf of Yi Yeyu.Hearing what Lin Huang said, everyone gave up on their plan to escape on eagles.After the meeting was adjourned, everyone left with an explanation that they were satisfied with and stayed in the foothold as they were told.As Yi Yeyu and the rest of her staff were back, Lin Huang was finally freed of his duties.It was pretty late at night when he left the hotel. While Lin Huang was practicing with his sword in his room, Yi Yeyu called him and asked him to meet her in her room.Lin Huang was skeptical at first, but he went anyway.When he entered her room, there was another man in Yi Yeyu\u2019s room.The man looked very ordinary and may have been in his 30s. He was slightly tan, slender, and stood at about 180 centimeters tall.Yi Yeyu introduced the man to Lin Huang immediately. \u201cThis is Master Zhang Bo. He was sent by the association to look into the situation,\u201d she explained.\u201cNice to meet you, Master Zhang.\u201dLin Huang could not tell that this man who looked ordinary was in fact, a transcendent, partly because of the fact that he was the first transcendent that he had ever seen. He could not help but stare at him. However, he looked like he was no different from any normal person and Lin Huang could not sense any extraordinary abilities from him.\u201cMaster Zhang, this young man is Lin Huang, the one I mentioned to you earlier,\u201d Yi Yeyu continued as she introduced Lin Huang to Zhang Bo.Zhang Bo patted Lin Huang\u2019s shoulder with a warm smile. He seemed friendly.\u201cYoung man, please tell me about the monster attack you encountered during your assessment. Recount the incident as carefully as you can, do not spare a single detail,\u201d he asked.Lin Huang nodded and told him everything.As Yi Yeyu did not know all the details of the encounter, listening to Lin Huang talking about the dangers that he had gone through, she was even more impressed by this young man abilities.Lin Huang took 20 minutes to tell his story. Once he finished, Zhang Bo again, patted him on his shoulder, much harder this time. \u201cYou did great, young man! I believe you will be an extraordinary hunter in the future!\u201d he said.Lin Huang was shy to hear the compliment. He just blushed and scratched his head in response.\u201cFrom what you said, there\u2019s a high possibility that there is, in fact, a charm-class transcendent monster,\u201d Zhang Bo said casually with a smile. \u201cLet me hunt it down. I will try my best to find it and kill it before daybreak!\u201d he continued.\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to do it in the morning?\u201d Yi Yeyu asked.Yi Yeyu asked out of concern as monsters were known to be more energized at night so they would be more powerful.Of course, Zhang Bo knew that but he did not care. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait, the earlier we solve this, the earlier we will be relieved of the threat,\u201d he replied.Apparently, Zhang Bo was a resolute person. He then opened the window in Yi Yeyu\u2019s room and leaped forward. He flew out of the window and disappeared in a blink of an eye.Looking at Zhang Bo\u2019s ability to fly, Lin Huang became envious of him.Yi Yeyu seemed to see through what Lin Huang was thinking and laughed. \u201cKeep training, young man. You\u2019ll be able to fly too when you became a transcendent.\u201dLin Huang was embarrassed, so he changed the subject. \u201cWho is this Master Zhang?\u201d he asked Yi Yeyu.\u201cZhang Bo the Air Gun is a powerful gunman. He was upgraded to a transcendent two years ago. Before he became a transcendent, he was on the Gold Hunter Leaderboard and he was the 33rd best in Division7.\u201d Yi Yeyu explained.\u201cIs being the 33rd best considered an achievement?\u201d Lin Huang asked as he did not find that impressive.\u201cYou know nothing. Do you know how many hunters there are in Division7? There are more than 100,000 Gold Hunters alone. Those who are in the top 1000th are the best in the entire industry!\u201d Yi Yeyu rolled her eyes at Lin Huang and gave him a lesson on the leaderboard.\u201cSo what is your rank?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m No.998,\u201d Yi Yeyu said proudly.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s great that you are among the top 1000 people then,\u201d Lin Huang said and gave her a perfunctory compliment.\u201cWhy does it sound like you think I suck for being no.998?\u201d Yi Yeyu glared at Lin Huang.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! Let me tell you again,\u201d he said. Lin Huang then used a sarcastic voice and shouted, \u201cWow, it\u2019s so amazing that you\u2019re among the top 1000 people! You did such a great job!\u201d\u201cGo back to your room now,\u201d Yi Yeyu growled, extremely irritated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang woke up with a start from his slumber.He heard a rumbling noise from far away. It sounded like thunder or continuous bombing.Even the hotel\u2019s glass windows were vibrating.\u201cIs that thunder?\u201d Lin Huang thought. It seemed really strange as the noise sounded more like it came from some heavy artillery fire.Putting his doubts aside, Lin Huang walked to the window and looked at the sky.It was dark and with a few stars in the distance. it did not look like it was going to rain at all.\u201cCould it be the two transcendents fighting?\u201d he thought. Just as Lin Huang imagined the idea in his mind, the noise suddenly got far away and within minutes, it disappeared.Lin Huang then emptied his mind. Since it was still dark outside, he went back to sleep.Before seven o\u2019clock in the morning, the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring on Lin Huang\u2019s finger vibrated and woke him up a second time that morning.It was Yi Yeyu who called.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her, calling me so early\u2026\u201d He looked at the time. It was only 6:40. Lin Huang mumbled to himself and picked up the call.\u201cLin Huang, come to my room. I have something important to tell you!\u201d Yi Yeyu shouted over the phone, sounding deadly serious.\u201cSo early?\u201d Lin Huang said, still annoyed.\u201cStop dawdling. Come now!\u201d Yi Yeyu hung up the phone.Lin Huang washed his face. He did not even brush his teeth, he just gargled water and left.When he arrived at Yi Yeyu\u2019s room, she was pacing up and down in her room, an intensely concerned look on her face. She did not even notice that Lin Huang was already in her room.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Huang said as he closed the door. It was unusual to see Yi Yeyu like that.\u201cZhang Bo is dead!\u201d Yi Yeyu said as she turned around to face Lin Huang.\u201cWhaa..ttt?!\u201d Lin Huang stuttered. He was in shocked. \u201cYou mean the transcendent that we met last night?\u201d\u201cI was woken up by a rumbling noise at four in the morning so I guessed they were fighting. I used a Scouting Relic to look in at their battle. At first, they were fighting not far from the mountains. Then, they got further away and more than two hours later, he was killed by the monster, and his dead body was eaten. The monster was badly injured and escaped underground,\u201d Yi Yeyu said.\u201cDid you inform the Hunter Association yet?\u201d Lin Huang asked, surprisingly calm.\u201cI informed them at around six in the morning. It was the first thing I did when I knew he was killed. I have also sent the recording of their battle from my relic,\u201d Yi Yeyu replied with a nod.\u201cWhat did the Hunter Association say?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cThey said the next transcendent will take at least two days to arrive\u2026\u201d Yi Yeyu responded, a helpless look on her face. \u201cHowever, now that the transcendent monster is badly injured, it will lead the other monsters to kill humans around the footholds to engulf their Life Light to heal itself before the next transcendent comes.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you bring the transcendent here with your green wooden door? Wouldn\u2019t that be much faster?\u201d Lin Huang said, as the thought suddenly crossed her mind.\u201cThe green wooden door is just a regular Dimensional Relic. It\u2019s not as magical as you think it is. There are many limitations to it. It can only go to places that I have been, as well as locations of which I have the coordinates for. There are limitations to the distance too, where it can only transport people that are within a 3000-kilometer radius. It will not just send you wherever you want to go,\u201d Yi Yeyu shook her head.\u201cThen how about the quantity? Is there a limitation to that as well? How many people can you send through in a day?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cThe maximum capacity would be 300 people at once and five trips back and forth per day. Which means I could send and bring 1500 people in a day. But there are more than 200,000 people in this foothold\u2026\u201d Yi Yeyu shook her head as she had thought of the plan before but it would not work.\u201cThere are too few eagles here as well, less than 50 of them\u2026\u201d Lin Huang said. He thought they could use the eagles and leave the foothold, but soon he figured that plan would not work.\u201cForget about it, let\u2019s not think of it anymore. I will gather everyone here at eight o\u2019clock. I will send all of you away,\u201d Yi Yeyu said. Knowing that she could that send all of the residents, Yi Yeyu hesitated no more and decided the best course of action herself.But if we leave, 200,000 people will be killed by the monsters,\u201d Lin Huang stared intensely at Yi Yeyu. He did not agree with her plan to leave all the residents to certain doom. They were talking about human lives after all.\u201cI will stay,\u201d Yi Yeyu said calmly.Lin Huang was quiet after what Yi Yeyu said. He was thinking if he should get Xue Luo and Bing Wang to help, but after some thought, he decided not to.Although he had saved Xue Luo\u2019s life, Xue Luo had restored his Life Wheel and even gave him an epiphany.That said, they did not owe each other anything.Moreover, Xue Luo was one of the monsters. It would be too much to ask if Lin Huang was to get her to kill a transcendent monster that had done nothing to her.After much thought, Lin Huang asked, \u201cYou said the transcendent monster was badly injured, which would mean that the possibility of it fighting would hardly be a worry, but it can still lead all the monsters here. There are level-1 and level-2 wild zones nearby where the strongest monsters are not more than bronze-level monsters. If we stay to fight them, we might win!\u201d\u201cAlthough the monsters\u2019 levels aren\u2019t high, there will be so many of them. Even a gold-level hunter like me would die from exhaustion if the monster crowd was to attack. I\u2019m one of the members of the Hunter Association. I have to stay to protect the residents. You guys have yet to register yourself with the association so you guys are not hunters yet so there\u2019s no need for all of you to stay. I know you\u2019re young and full of justice, but this is not the time to be heroic. Stay alive now so that you can avenge those who died when you\u2019re stronger in the future,\u201d Yi Yeyu said and shook her head as she disagreed with Lin Huang\u2019s plan. It seemed like she was already prepared to die.Looking at her, Lin Huang did not say a word.It was eight o\u2019clock in the morning two hours later. Everyone gathered in the meeting room on the hotel\u2019s first floor after receiving Yi Yeyu\u2019s emergency alert.Lin Huang sat quietly in the last row of the meeting room.Everyone included Bai Yan were there. After a moment of silence, Yi Yeyu started to speak.\u201cThe reason why I called all of you here is because I have bad news,\u201d Yi Yeyu said. She then took a deep breath and told them the truth. \u201cThe transcendent that was sent by the association found the transcendent monster which caused the uproar last night. However, at six in the morning earlier today, he was killed by the monster,\u201d she said.The crowd went completely silent after hearing what Yi Yeyu said, but soon, an uproar erupted among them.\u201cIf a human transcendent can be killed by the monster, this foothold isn\u2019t safe at all,\u201d someone said.\u201cWe should\u2019ve left yesterday. Now, this foothold has been marked by the transcendent monster,\u201d another person shouted.\u201cMiss head examiner, you should be able to send us away right?\u201d\u201cMiss head examiner, it was you who made us stay, you should be responsible for our safety!\u201d more people said, yelling over each other.\u2026Overwhelmed by the accusations, Yi Yeyu was upset but she did not say a word.\u201cEveryone please be quiet! Let the head examiner finish what she was saying,\u201d Lin Huang who sat at the last row stood up and said.\u201cLin Huang, you\u2019re responsible for this too. If you didn\u2019t stop us, many of us would have left a few days ago,\u201d another crowd member cried. As it turned out, Lin Huang\u2019s heroic act too attracted some accusation.\u201cDo you have a death wish?!\u201d Lin Huang roared and summoned Bai. The vampire appeared and stood quietly by Lin Huang\u2019s side, staring at everyone in the room.Looking at Lin Huang\u2019s expression, some of them were silenced immediately. They recalled getting beaten up by Lin Huang\u2019s monster for disobeying him and shuddered in silence.\u201cLin Huang, don\u2019t exploit your power,\u201d Bai Yan said as he stood up across Lin Huang and summoned his Lion-Headed Troll, ready to fight him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBoth of you this stop right now!\u201d Yi Yeyu shouted. She could not take it anymore!Seeing Yi Yeyu so mad, the whole crowd was on edge as to what would happen.\u201cI\u2019m not done yet,\u201d Yi Yeyu continued. She suppressed her anger and said, \u201cI have already informed the management of the association. They are going to send other transcendents here. The thing is, they will need two days to arrive so I\u2019m thinking of sending all of you away from here before that.\u201dHearing what Yi Yeyu said, the crowd calmed slightly. Nobody had any objections.After a moment of silence, a young voice spoke up from the last row, \u201cMiss head examiner, you can send everybody away. I will not leave!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You would die if you stayed. It\u2019ll be no help at all!\u201d Yi Yeyu scolded.She had always thought that he was a good person. The more they connected, the more good sides to him she found. She did not want him to stay with the risk that it might destroy his future.\u201cMiss head examiner, please listen to what I have to say,\u201d Lin Huang insisted and looked Yi Yeyu in the eyes.However, Yi Yeyu was stubborn. The situation was really awkward.Suddenly, the meeting room\u2019s door swung open. A young man in a white robe, with his hands in his pockets, walked slowly into the meeting room.\u201cYeyu, why don\u2019t you listen to what this kid has to say,\u201d the man said loudly to Yi Yeyu from the back of the room. From his tone of voice, Yi Yeyu and this man seemed to be close.Yi Yeyu was stunned at the man\u2019s appearance. \u201cBrother, why are you here?\u201d she asked.\u201cI was running errands nearby, and I heard that you were working as an examiner here. So, I thought I would drop by after I was done with my task. Before I got here, I noticed that the official website of Division7 has gone viral with a video of a transcendent\u2019s death,\u201d he said. To the surprise of all in their state of mourning, the man in white robe laughed.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Yi Yeyu said, a solemn tone to her reply.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t come, knowing the way you\u2019d react, you\u2019d be dead in two days,\u201d he said with a stern look in his eyes. The man knew his sister very well.Yi Yeyu did not say a word.The man in white robe then turned around and looked at Lin Huang who sat at the last row of the meeting room.\u201cYoung man, my name is Yi Zheng. I am Yeyu\u2019s brother. I heard from outside that you have a plan. Let\u2019s hear it then.\u201dHearing the name, many people in the crowd gasped, especially Bai Yan. With his mouth wide open, he looked like he really admired Yi Zheng. He knew very well that this man was no.11 on the Gold Hunter Leaderboard in Division7. He was terrifyingly powerful.Lin Huang did not know anything about him. He nodded and said what he had in mind.\u201cThis is my plan. There are more than 200,000 people in this foothold. It\u2019s impossible to escape with every single person. To survive, the only way is to fight! Although the human transcendent would take two days to be here, we should act now as the transcendent monster is badly injured. In such a short period of time, it would unlikely be able to fight again. So what we should be watchful for there\u2019s a horde of monsters out there!\u201d\u201cTo tackle the monster horde with the current number of hunters we have in this foothold would be a bad idea. We have insufficient manpower, but we can ask for help. We can get the Hunter Association to announce an emergency mission and increase the mission reward. People would be lining up to help. Till then, Miss Yi Yeyu would have to use her relic to get to foothold No.7C87 and bring over a few thousand professional hunters. Of course, this is only one of the viable options, for now.\u201d\u201cThe areas around the Snowy Mountain Town are basically level-1 and level-2 wild zones with very few wild-3 wild zones we need to be worried about. If we have sufficient hunters, we can start the fight before the monster horde makes their move. One Silver Hunter could easily conquer a level-2 wild zone within minutes.\u201d\u201cMoreover, we have the geological advantage on our side as the foothold backs up to the mountains. As soon as we kill all the monsters on the mountains, we can hold back the monsters that are in the desert across the mountains for at least two days. I\u2019ve climbed the mountains before. Although we are human, without any tools, even an iron-level rank-3 Reserve Hunter would need two days to climb those mountains. All we need is to do is guard the foothold for two days until the human transcendent arrives to kill the transcendent monster.\u201d\u201cAbout the canyons on the east of Snowy Mountain Town, there are not many monsters there. We can get the staff to clean up the place, block the mouth of the canyon with a giant rock and leave a small path for us to walk through. Then we guard the entrance and kill all the monsters that come in. By my calculations, that will severely thin out the monster horde!\u201d\u201cThe only thing that we cannot defend ourselves from are the birds in the sky. So, we will need a team to specifically tackle the birds.\u201d Everyone was stunned when they heard what Lin Huang said.Yi Yeyu was stunned too, she did not know that Lin Huang would have so many ideas.Even Yi Zheng was surprised, he clapped his hands immediately after Lin Huang finished and said, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Your mind is clear and your proposal is very feasible.\u201d\u201cI will inform the management now and get them to spread the mission word around while Yeyu will bring the hunters over. We will discuss the details when everyone is gathered,\u201d Yi Zheng said and looked at all the people in the meeting room. \u201cAll of you don\u2019t have to be a part of this. You guys can follow Yeyu when she\u2019s going back to the medium foothold. I\u2019ll get her to talk to the management to give all of you a pass in your assessment,\u201d he continued.After he gave his instructions, Yi Zheng then contacted the Hunter Association. Soon, the proposal was approved.\u201cIt\u2019s been arranged. They will announce the mission now. Please bring these kids with you and go,\u201d Yi Zheng said and nodded towards Yi Yeyu.\u201cAlright, please come here. I will send you all to the medium foothold,\u201d Yi Yeyu said. She then summoned her green wooden door while waving to the people to join her.Lin Huang remained seated.\u201cLin Huang, come here now!\u201d Yi Yeyu shouted at him.\u201cI\u2019ve told you that I will not leave,\u201d Lin Huang insisted.\u201cYoung man, you will be of no help even if you stayed. It was your idea. If we manage to win the battle, you will have half the reward to yourself,\u201d Yi Zheng explained as he worried that Lin Huang thought they wanted to take all the glory.\u201cI would stay even without any rewards,\u201d Lin Huang continually insisted.\u201cWhat do you want, Lin Huang?!\u201d Yi Yeyu was mad and shouted at Lin Huang.\u201cI will only leave when I see all 200,000 people survive!\u201d Lin Huang replied, looking straight into Yi Yeyu\u2019s eyes. Yi Yeyu who was staring at him looked away. She was quiet.It was awkward for Yi Zheng as he thought Lin Huang wanted to stay for benefits.The rest were quiet too, some of them were embarrassed.\u201cI\u2019m staying too!\u201d Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted.\u201cMee too!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m staying to kill those monsters!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026They volunteered one by one since one of them had taken the lead.However, Bai Yan was the coward in the crowd. He mumbled to himself, \u201cAll these idiots giving their lives away\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, stop acting like a hero. You guys are not children playing house,\u201d Yi Yeyu had tears in her eyes when she yelled at them.\u201cLin Huang will stay, those who are iron-level rank-3 can stay too.

Including Lin Huang, there were 12 of them that stayed. Apart from Lin Huang, everyone was iron-level rank-3.\u201cSince you guys have decided to stay, you have to listen to us!\u201d Yi Zheng said to them. \u201cThis is now a battlefield. Your personal safety in secondary to the priority today. Today isn\u2019t all about you. The lives of your comrades matter too. Therefore, you will have to follow my instructions and move as a unit. Understood!?\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The squad of young men stood at attention and shouted.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Yi Zheng turned around and looked at Lin Huang.\u201cLin Huang.\u201d\u201cGood. You said you want to see 200,000 people survive. Now I\u2019m going to pass these 10 fellas to you. Your mission is simple. Keep them alive. Do you accept this mission?\u201d Yi Zheng asked and smiled at Lin Huang.The reason why he gave him this mission was to prevent him from going to battle.He knew Lin Huang was smart, and with these 10 men, he will not do anything that would put them in harm\u2019s way.\u201cMission accepted, Sir,\u201d Lin Huang replied.Lin Huang nodded and agreed. He knew what Yi Zheng was up to, but he had a plan of his own.If these young men were to be with the other hunters, they might have weighed them down too.Professional hunters would never rely on a bunch of young men who were not even registered as Reserve Hunters.Meanwhile, leading 10 iron-level rank-3 men to clear a level-1 foothold would not be a problem for Lin Huang.The young men had witness what Lin Huang was capable of as two of them had suffered severe beatings by Tyrant before. The wounds on their faces were still recovering so they obeyed him without question.Although Yi Zheng did not know that Lin Huang was an Imperial Censor, seeing that nobody objected him being their leader, Yi Zheng knew Lin Huang must either be powerful or a young man with an interesting background.Just when they agreed on the proposed arrangement, Yi Yeyu brought 300 professional hunters back with her.Most of them were Silver Hunters. There were 30 Copper Hunters and five Gold Hunters.Most of them knew who Yi Zheng was. They all showed him a great deal of respect, even the other Gold Hunters too.Yi Yeyu left right after she sent the hunters through while Yi Zheng started to make other strategies and arrangements.All 300 hunters spread out quickly to their assigned post. The 20 Copper Hunters were sent to clear the canyon. The Silver Hunters were clearing the foothold on the alps while the Gold Hunters were responsible for cutting the giant rock at the bottom of the alps.Yi Yeyu made four trips from the medium foothold and brought back 1,200 professional hunters in total. Almost a thousand of them were Silver Hunters, with 20 Gold Hunters while the rest were either Copper Hunters or hunters with terrifying powers or unique abilities.Before the monster outbreak, Yi Zheng followed the plan suggested by Lin Huang and sent the 1,000 hunters out to clear the mountains and canyons.In the meantime, the giant rocks there are cut by the Gold Hunters while the smaller boulders were moved by 10 thousand able-bodied adult residents of the foothold to block the mouth of the canyon.Lin Huang and the rest were sent into the canyon to clear up the monsters. There were two or three of them in a team of Bronze Hunters but there were 11 of them altogether.There were not many monsters in the canyon. With the involvement of the other professional hunters, the team led by Lin Huang did not even encounter a complete monster in the first hour.\u201cThese professional hunters are so competitive. We have been searching for so long and have changed a couple of routes. All we could find were some monster body parts and trails of blood on the ground,\u201d a tall and strong man in the team complained.His name was Zhou Le. He was one of the guys who picked a fight with Lin Huang a few days back. The scars that he got from Tyrant were still fresh on his face.\u201cThey\u2019re efficient, and that\u2019s a good thing. It would be perfect if we did not even have to fight during the monster outbreak. That would mean the foothold is completely safe,\u201d Lin Huang replied after much thought.\u201cLin Huang, do you really think we can save the foothold?\u201d Zhou Le asked.\u201cIf we manage to cordon off the canyon mouth, guarding it for two days shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The only thing is\u2026\u201d Lin Huang trailed off with a frown on his face.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Zhou Le asked.\u201cThe canyon mouth is too big. I\u2019m worried that before they can barricade and protect it, the outbreak would happen before we\u2019re ready,\u201d Lin Huang voiced out his concern.\u201cLin Huang, don\u2019t you jinx it! I still want to leave in one piece and become a transcendent one day!\u201d A short guy named Yu Guang said. He was also one of the guys who picked a fight with Lin Huang and he too had scars on his face to prove it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as I am alive, I will bring you all out of here in one piece!\u201d Lin Huang gave them his word.\u201cThere were people here before us moving in this direction. The monsters ahead must already be dead. Let\u2019s take another route,\u201d Zhou Le said as he bent down and studied the tracks on the ground. He had investigative skills. Although his level was not that high, coming up with such detailed estimations was not a problem to him.\u201cSure, which direction should we go?\u201d Lin Huang asked as he trusted Zhou Le\u2019s observations.\u201cLet\u2019s head in a two o\u2019clock direction from this point,\u201d Zhou Le said to Lin Huang after some thought.\u201d\u201cDamn it! Zhou Le, can we really trust you? We have been following your route for more than an hour, we haven\u2019t even seen a single monster\u2019s hair.\u201d Yu Guang teased.\u201cCan you really blame me? We have more hunters than monsters now,\u201d Zhou Le shouted back. He felt helpless that his skills did not bring them any action this whole time.\u201cYou are no help, Lin Huang, please take the lead,\u201d Yu Guang suggested.\u201cI\u2019m not good at investigating. Let\u2019s follow Zhou Le\u2019s route. If any of you think that your investigative abilities are stronger than Zhou Le, please go ahead and lead the way,\u201d Lin Huang turned and said to the group.Lin Huang rejected Yu Guang\u2019s suggestion as he knew himself very well.Although he learned a lot about the basics of investigation, when it came to practical use, he was far from being able to compete with Zhou Le\u2019s capabilities.He thought there was no need for him to lead in something that he was not good at. If something went wrong, he would just embarrass himself.Hearing what Lin Huang said, nobody dared step up. They then followed Zhou Le\u2019s route in silence.After walking for almost 20 minutes, Lin Huang and the gang finally saw a horde of monsters.They then moved away and hid. It was a group of Ox Devils. There were more than 20 of them. The tallest one stood at a height of five meters and the shortest one was about three meters tall.Compared to a human, they were considered giants.However, they did not belong to the giant family but were part of the mutated monster family.Being different from the giants, their body sizes did not reflect their abilities.They were similar to humans as they walked on two feet, grabbed things with their hands, and used weapons to attack and protect themselves.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhat differentiated them from the humans was that their ox-like heads as well as their hooves and tail.The Ox Devils were much smarter than iron-level monsters. They even had their own religion and they could make their own totems to strengthen their abilities.Lin Huang and the gang saw the five-meter tall totem that was guarded by an Ox Devil.\u201cThere are 26 of them and a religious totem. If I\u2019m not mistaken, that totem gives them 10% extra strength. How do we fight that?\u201d Zhou Le asked softly.\u201cGo set some traps now. I\u2019ll destroy the totem later to attract their attention, and they will definitely come rushing at me like the bulls they are. We will wait here for them to fall into our traps,\u201d Lin Huang said. He then took out his GrayEagle17 and loaded them with armored bullets\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bang! Bang!\u201dThree shots were fired and the totem that was as thick as a pail crumbled as splinters and dust flew around. The five-meter tall totem broke through the middle, and the top half of it fell hard on the ground. Sand and dust rose in a thick cloud around it.The group of Ox Devils was stunned at first, but soon they snapped out of it.More than 20 of them roared with rage and ran towards the direction they had heard the gunshots come from.Lin Huang holstered his gun and took out his iron sword that he had not yet had the chance to use in battles.At the same time, he summoned Bai.Lin Huang could gain Life Light if he got Bai to kill the monsters but he would not obtain the rewards for cross-rank killing.On the other hand, if Lin Huang was to kill the monsters himself, he could not receive the Life Lights.Both had benefits of their own, so Lin Huang chose to try to get the best of both worlds.Soon, the charging Ox Devils fell into the traps that were set by Lin Huang and gang.More than 10 Ox Devils who had their Life Power strengthened, had their hooves trapped tight. They could not move at all and howled at the trap\u2019s teeth dug deeper into their limbs the more they struggled. The rest of the Ox Devils ran towards Lin Huang and gang with burning fury.It was not their first time fighting with monsters. Seeing the Ox Devils advancing upon them, instead of panicking, each of them picked one to fight straight on.Lin Huang picked one that was of a smaller size, not because he thought it was weak, but because he knew that his ability to jump was far less superior as compared to the rest who were iron-level rank-3. It would have been hard for him to attack the crucial parts of the taller Ox Devils.Looking at the other Ox Devils, Lin Huang thought of a sentence that had been popular for a period of time. \u201cDo you believe that I can jump and break your patella with my fist?\u201d He shouted.The sentence was applicable to many monsters in the world.Lin Huang was only 15. His height was considered normal to people of the same age which was about 1.65 meters (don\u2019t worry about his height, he would grow taller later) but he did not even reach the waist of the Ox Devil that stood across from him.However, he was not afraid to face such an enemy. Instead, he was excited.He held the iron sword in his hand, the black blade was shining brightly under the sun.Lin Huang stood where he was and stared at the Ox Devil that broke into a run towards him.The gigantic Ox Devil stomped hard with its iron hooves and the ground beneath it shook violently.Its eyes were bloodshot red. It only took a second for it to come within meters of Lin Huang. It swung the huge stone hammer in its hand at him, and there was intense whistling sound from the power of the swing.In Lin Huang\u2019s eyes, the Ox Devil\u2019s movement seemed much slower than his. He took one sidestep away from the Ox Devil and the beast\u2019s attack missed him by millimeters.He then swung his iron sword, and blood splashed on the ground.The Ox Devil groaned while it held the left side of its waist. It stared at Lin Huang in hatred.Lin Huang\u2019s sword made a one meter long cut on the Ox Devil\u2019s waist, it had almost sliced through its organs.\u201cThe Great Sword Scriptures are so powerful. With my strength and a normal battle sword, it injured this Ox Devil so badly\u2026\u201d Lin Huang thought, impressed with himself. He thought it would have been good enough if he could just break the Ox Devil\u2019s defense, but he did not expect the slash would have such an impact.Since the epiphany, Lin Huang\u2019s Great Sword Scriptures had reached a Blue Epic-level and from the original 18 styles, he now had 36 styles.The 36 styles did not have a name to each. After it was integrated into his body, it felt like an instinct that he was born with. The skills were carved deep in his mind.Furthermore, his regular styles could be adjusted just by his thoughts.Lin Huang felt a unique feeling within himself. Previously when he was in training, he could feel that after he had mastered the skills, a transformation would occur in his swordplay.Now that he was finally using his sword in battle, he was sure that he could reach a new level of experience with his swordplay.The Ox Devil that was injured by Lin Huang\u2019s sword slash stared at him in anger. With the look, Lin Huang felt a very real fear build up within him.While he hesitated, deciding if he should run away or to continue to attack, he noticed that the Ox Devil was not paying attention to him.He took the opportunity and attacked the beast.It swung its two-meter-long stone hammer again and it pierced through the sound barrier. If he was hit, Lin Huang would have died on the spot.Hearing the whistle from the stone hammer, Lin Huang ducked down, dashed towards the Ox Devil and slashed his sword down on the monster, from the top to bottom.The Ox Devil let out a loud groan again. Its arm was chopped clean off its shoulder, spouting blood all over the place.Lin Huang did not stop attacking the animal. He then stepped on the Ox Devil\u2019s knee, leaped up and swung his sword.The Ox Devil held its throat in one hand and did not make any noise.A thick vein of its neck started shooting blood up in the air with a hissing noise.Its bloody eyes stared deadly at Lin Huang. It seemed to not reconcile to the fact that it was at Death\u2019s door.Soon enough, it fell dead on the ground.\u201cCongratulations, you have obtained an Ox Devil Monster Card piece x1\u201d\u201cYou have completed a cross-ranking kill. You have obtained a Provisional Transformation Card\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a Provisional Transformation Card?\u201d Seeing the word \u2018transformation\u2019 reminded Lin Huang of a web novel that he had read on a novel website called Qidian. It was a story about a man that transformed into a woman. He felt goosebumps rising on his neck and arms when he thought about that. He then looked at the new card that he got.There was a human and a monster on the top of the card. There was an arrow pointing from the human to the monster.Lin Huang then turned the card around to read the description.\u201cTransformation Card: After using this card, the host can transform into any of the monsters that he owns and he will possess all the skills that the monster had. The transformation will last for 24 hours.\u201cRemarks: This card is a consumable. You can only use this card once.\u201dAfter reading the description, Lin Huang was relieved. He was excited to see the effects of the card.He thought transforming himself into a monster would be an interesting experience. He was ready to use it when he had the time and opportunity.Suddenly, with Lin Huang deep in his zone, he felt a warm liquid splash on his face.When he got out of his zone, it was Bai who stood in front of him.His Blood Power wings turned into a sharp blade and pierced through an Ox Devils mouth right to the back of its head.The Ox Devil\u2019s head was right above his own head, its brain juices and blood showered down on Lin Huang\u2019s head.\u201cSuch a thing shouldn\u2019t have happened on a battlefield. That was incredibly absent-minded. If not for Bai, I would have been smashed by the Ox Devil into a pile of dead flesh,\u201d Lin Huang reflected.Soon, all the 26 Ox Devils were dead.Bai had killed most of them, and he had killed six of them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust then, Lin Huang noticed that he had 17 white columns added to his Life Wheel.Before they started their journey again then cleaned off all the Ox Devil blood they were drenched in. The battle had energized everyone, and they could not wait to kill more monsters!However, when they just started their journey, Lin Huang\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring vibrated. The same happened to the rest of them.Lin Huang saw a message that was sent by Yi Yeyu when he opened the communication page.It was just a simple sentence, \u201cThe monster outbreak is happening, go to the canyon mouth right now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What he predicted would happen had finally happened\u2026He then led the young men towards the canyon mouth. On the way, everyone was quiet and held their heads as they walked.They arrived at the canyon mouth about half an hour later.Lin Huang could see from afar that the 10-kilometer long canyon mouth was blocked off by giant stones but there was still two to three kilometers left unprotected. His heart dropped when he saw that the gap was much bigger than he expected.What he estimated was that they could block the gap until it was only a few hundred meters wide. He plan was to minimize the possibility of the monsters coming in, as well as funnel them to a single point of which they would focus their attacks to slaughter the monsters.However, they did not have enough time. Before they could finish their line of defense, the outbreak of monsters had happened.The gap that was three kilometers long was attacked by countless ferocious monsters.The residents who were moving the giant rocks retreated under the cover of the hunters.The war has started. Residents would be targeted by the monsters if they stayed.Aside from the hunters that were brought by Yi Yeyu, all the hunters who did not leave the foothold joined in the battle.However, the number of hunters were far too few as compared to the number of monsters.The 1,000 or so hunters would die of exhaustion if they continued. Under Yi Zheng\u2019s orders, they formed several defensive formations.The first line would consist of the 20 Gold Hunters. They were dressed in armor which were at least gold-level and some even used relics.As long as their Life Power was not drained, iron-level and bronze-level monsters would not stand a chance against them.The 20 of them stood around 100 meters apart from each other.They were positioned at the location which was supposed to be blocked by the giant rocks and killed every monster that came at them.Many of the monsters were bewildered while some of them were alert to the danger of the experienced hunters.Sensing the powerful group of people, the monsters rushed to make it through the gaps between the hunters.The 20 Gold Hunters could not care less as all they could do was to kill as many monsters as they could while leaving the rest that went through the gaps to the Silver Hunters who were not far behind them.There were 1000 Silver Hunters stood less than 10 meters behind the Gold Hunters.They formed an arc, which put them at about three meters apart from each other.They wore armor too and killed the monsters that passed through the first line of defense mercilessly.The remaining Copper Hunters were ready as the last line of defense at around 100 meters behind the Silver Hunters.There were only 100 of them and they were 30 meters apart from each other.Fortunately, there were fewer monsters that broke through the third line of defense so they were not under a lot of pressure as compared to the others. The few monsters that broke in to face their lines were either already injured or weak, and they made easy work of killing them.Behind the Copper Hunters was the fourth line of defense that was guarded by more than 20 old men.They used to be hunters but due to injuries and other reasons which had caused their abilities to weaken, they had been living in solitude in this small foothold.Each of them held heavy firearms. Although they could not use their Life Power anymore, they still had their gun skills.Yi Yeyu saw Lin Huang and the gang walking towards her from the top of the giant rock in the distance.She did not say a word but pointed at the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring on her finger and Lin Huang knew what she meant.Under such condition, the noise of monsters roaring and killing filled the area so Yi Yeyu used her Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring to send him text messages.Soon, Lin Huang\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring vibrated. He opened the communication page and saw a message from Yi Yeyu which said, \u201cThere is no more space in the third line of defense, you guys will have to go to the last line. Those old-timers have guns in their hands but they might not be able to fight the monsters. Be alert.\u201d\u201cCopy that,\u201d Lin Huang replied to Yi Yeyu and turned around to pass the message to the rest of his troop.The group of young men was unhappy.\u201cClearly she despises us. She\u2019s worried that we will slow them down so she puts us at the back,\u201d Zhou Le grumbled. He was pissed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. When we arrived, the rest had already started fighting. It\u2019s obvious that they took their time inform us on purpose, they don\u2019t trust us at all! If I knew this all along, why would I stay? I should\u2019ve left with Bai Yan and the rest!\u201d Yu Guang said in anger.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be saying all this right now. All of you promised Yi Zheng that you would listen to his instructions,\u201d Lin Huang shouted at all of them.\u201cThe head examiner must be putting our safety into consideration, that\u2019s why she came up with the arrangement. Or perhaps she\u2019s concerned that we are not able to take the pressure. After all, we are not professional hunters. We are not even comparable to a Bronze Hunter!\u201d he continued.\u201cThink about it. If she does not trust us, would she have left the last line of defense to us?The last line might seem far away from the action, but it\u2019s the most important one of them all. If it is broken, the lives of the 200,000 residents will be at risk. If the first three lines of defense cannot handle the monsters, they could always leave it to the hunters behind them but not us. So our responsibility is the most crucial!\u201dHearing what Lin Huang said, the young men thought it made sense and they were ready to fight yet again.However, Lin Huang was laughing on the inside. \u201cThese dummies are so easily manipulated,\u201d he thought.He knew what Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng were thinking.They did not care if there was a fourth line of defense at all. What they really wanted was all the monsters dead by the time they reached the third line of defense.Lin Huang and the gang were just there for show.For such a major battle like this crowd of monsters, it was better to have fewer humans in the picture.Therefore, there would have to be accurate rotations for each line. If one went wrong, the entire defense system would collapse.Although, Yi Yeyu obviously would not put Lin Huang and the rest of his team into the lines.If something went wrong, they would put everybody\u2019s lives at risk.Lin Huang knew very well what the problem was on his team.His team\u2019s ability was unstable. Their discipline was weak and conformity was much worse as compared to the professional hunters.Their mentality and ability to handle pressure were uncertain too.Even if Lin Huang was to lead the battle, he would not have put his team in a major role against an enemy like the monsters that were attacking.So he was at peace with the arrangement.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTo him, it was best that the third line of defense handle all the monster attacks so that he did not have to do anything within the next two days.Then when the human transcendent arrived, he would kill the transcendent monster and the incident would be over.Lin Huang was optimistic but things did not go the way he had hoped.In less than an hour, as Lin Huang and the gang stood a few hundred meters from the north of the third defense line, an uproar broke out.A couple of monsters broke through the third defense line and stampeded towards the foothold\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was out of everyone\u2019s expectation, after all, the monster outbreak had just started for an hour.Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng who were standing on top of the giant rock was shocked to see the monsters broke through the defense line.Just when they wanted to fight, they saw Lin Huang who was a few hundred meters away summoning Tyrant to chase after the monsters.The gang behind him saw and chased after the monsters too.The monsters that broke through were five Demonic Hyenas, they belonged to the disease-class.Although they were also called hyenas, they were far different from the hyenas on earth.Their fur was grayish-black and they were three meters long. Their limbs were long and their bodies were light.There were two deformed horns on their heads, there were a ferocious, white, sharp bones on their back, extended from their neck to their thigh.The rest of their bodies were filled with red pustules. Some were bulging and some were popped and rankled. Their bodies were exuding a disgusting stench.Lin Huang knew this monster very well as he had read about them before.As there were not many monsters that were categorized in the disease-class, these Demonic Hyenas were the most common one.According to the record, they carried more than 300 viruses on their bodies and more than 10 of those viruses were life-threatening to humans.If proper treatment was not administered in time, it would cause serious infections and even death.If one was bitten or scratched by them, the consequences would be very serious.Lin Huang sat on Tyrant\u2019s shoulders and took out his GrayEagle17, aiming at the Demonic Hyenas that ran past.\u201cBang, bang, bang\u2026\u201d Shots were fired.The Demonic Hyenas were caught off guard. They were hit and howled in agony.A few of them were bewildered and became furious when they saw they injured companion. The pack then changed their course and set their sights on killing Lin Huang. They started running at him with murderous intent.The armored bullets did not hit the Demonic Hyenas\u2019 weak spots and the damage done was minimal. However, the same couldn\u2019t be said for the pain it had caused.The gunshots did not scare them away, instead, the shots triggered their vicious rage.Looking at the Demonic Hyenas running at him, Lin Huang was not surprised. He was actually getting excited.He slid off Tyrant\u2019s shoulders, recalled the beast and summoned Bai.In terms of combat strength, Tyrant and Bai were almost the same, but in terms of killing, Bai was one level stronger than Tyrant.He possessed level-2 Blood Power which gave him a pair of sharp blades so the area of attack he had was bigger than what Tyrant had.A few hundred meters was a short distance, and the five Demonic Hyenas were closing in on Lin Huang.He just noticed half of the pustules on one of them were torn away and had turned into stripes of scary bloody scars.Bai stood in front of Lin Huang with his red eyes, the pair of Blood Power wings were out and at full span, blocking the path of the five Demonic Hyenas.Lin Huang slowly holstered his GrayEagle17 and took out his iron sword.He locked his eyes on a mutated Demonic Hyena and said to Bai, \u201cBai, save the one on the left for me.\u201dBai had got his orders and was ready to execute. He bent his left wing and stabbed it at the closest mutated monster that rushed at him.The Demonic Hyena that was filled with bloody scars stared at Lin Huang with its grayish-white eyes. It then lunged at him and opened its mouth that was filled with sticky drool in an attempt to bite Lin Huang\u2019s head.However, Lin Huang just stood there with his sword in hand, poised and ready. He then swung his sword, and black blood was splashed to the side as he nearly split the attacking beast in half.The bloody hyena let out a loud groan and fell to the floor. Its abdomen that was now exposed to Lin Huang had a one-meter long cut running through. Its intestines could be seen, spilling out on the ground.\u201cSuch amazing skill!\u201d Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng exclaimed in unison as they watched from afar on the giant rock they stood on.Especially Yi Yeyu. Her eyes sparkled with admiration. She thought since Lin Huang was an Imperial Censor, he might be able to use a gun but she had never seen him using his sword.She was stunned when she saw Lin Huang swing his sword for the very first time.\u201cThis Great Sword Scripture skill is amazing! If I had the same strength as that monster, I might have killed it in one slash,\u201d Lin Huang thought, surprised at the extent of damage he had inflicted.As its bewilderment faded, the bloody hyena was woken up by Lin Huang\u2019s attack.Now that it noticed the human upon it was dangerous, it was going to turn around to run away in the other direction.In its panicked state, it did not notice that it was heading to the foothold where the humans were.Seeing its attempt to run, Lin Huang took a few steps towards it with his sword in hand. He ran at it with bloodlust in his eye. The bloody hyena saw him attacking and when it tried to duck, Lin Huang launched himself at it and stabbed his sword into its neck.The iron sword pierced through the bloody hyena\u2019s neck like he was slicing tofu.The sword went all the way into its body until only the handle was showing.It was not that the sword was sharp, but because the Great Sword Scripture was terrifyingly powerful.But it was not the end. Lin Huang held the sword firmly and pierced it further into the dying beast.The sword was completely buried in the hyena\u2019s throat. The cut was one meter long and almost 80 centimeters deep. A big part of its throat was cut open, and its head was crooked to a side.Black blood flowed out of its wound like a waterfall on the ground. The ferocious bloody hyena was dead.A notification came from Xiao Hei.\u201cCongratulations, you have obtained a Bloody Scarred Hyena Monster Card piece x1\u201d\u201cYou have completed a cross-ranking kill. You have obtained a random Skill Card (Rare) x1\u201dThis time Lin Huang did not even look at the cards that he had obtained as he had just killed the bloody hyena. Just then, Zhou Le and the rest caught up to him.Bai had killed two Demonic Hyenas on his own, while the remaining two were chased away by the group of young men.Soon, the remaining two were killed.Lin Huang brought the young men to the gap that broke earlier and ran at it, his sword held tight in his hands.A Copper Hunter\u2019s face was pale and he looked like he was about to give up. He was fighting so many monsters alone.Lin Huang and the rest went to help and killed the monsters. They then asked the cause of the breakthrough of the line of defense.They found out that when this Copper Hunter was fighting with the hyenas, one of them had mutated out of nowhere. With the massive gain of speed, the mutated bloody hyena bit the hunter\u2019s left hand while the other hyenas ran onwards.\u201cYou should treat your wound right away. If you don\u2019t treat the virus immediately, there will be consequences,\u201d Lin Huang advised him after hearing what happened.\u201cBut what about the battle\u2026\u201d The Copper Hunter said, torn between fighting on or saving himself from an infection. If he retreated, there would be another gap in the line of defense, in his place.\u201cWe will fill the gap for you,\u201d Lin Huang assured him, in all seriousness.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt would be okay if the monsters were smaller. There are many of them, can you guys handle it?\u201d The hunter asked. He was worried about the group of boys before him.\u201cSir, please do not underestimate us, especially this fella. He killed that bloody hyena on his own just now with only two slashes,\u201d Zhou Le said proudly. He had stood aside earlier as he was afraid that the hunter would not let them pass. He knew that if he told the hunter what Lin Huang had done earlier, he would not think so little of them.Yi Yeyu\u2019s then spoke to them, \u201cLu Yang, please go back to the foothold to treat yourself. Please let Lin Huang and the gang handle this.\u201dLu Yang, the Copper Hunter handed over his responsibilities to them with regret in his eyes.He then left with Zhou Le.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But soon, their excitement was replaced with a sense of pressure for the task ahead.Lin Huang knew very well that it was real this time, and that he was part of this war.He felt like a puzzle piece in a game of kill or be killed.This battle was a complete jigsaw puzzle, and the whole troop made up the pieces. If any part of the puzzle was missing, the puzzle would not be complete and they would be defeated.Lin Huang did not care if the rest were flawed as it was not a factor within his control.However, knowing that he had been placed in this position with the trust of Yi Yeyu and Yi Zhang, he had to guarantee that he did not cause any mistakes of his own.Before the next monster wave attacked, Lin Huang rallied his troops and repeated to each of them how important it was to obey his orders in battle.Zhou Le and the rest nodded immediately. They knew how serious it was and did not hesitate for a moment.After telling them, Lin Huang looked at the Rare Skill Card that he obtained for the cross-ranking kill earlier.It was a green card with a big question mark on the front, there was nothing else besides the question mark.There was a description on the back of the card that he studied.\u201cRandom Skill Card (Rare): You will receive one random Rare Skill Card.\u201d\u201cRemarks: This card is a consumable card, you can only use it once.\u201d\u201cPerfect timing for me to gain another skill, what kind of skill would I get this time\u2026\u201dLin Huang thought. He only had three skills so far. One was his sword skill \u2018Great Sword Scriptures\u2019, another was \u2018Robust\u2019 that he obtained from Tyrant and the third was \u2018Blood Power\u2019 that he got from Bai.In reality, \u2018Robust\u2019 was a passive skill while Lin Huang could not even summon \u2018Blood Power\u2019 yet. The only skill that he could use was the \u2018Great Sword Scriptures\u2019.Fortunately, the skill was useful which allowed him to unleash an immense amount of strength if he ever needed to.Now that he had an opportunity to get an additional skill, Lin Huang was overjoyed. Although he did not know what kind of skill he would get, Lin Huang communicated with Xiao Hei with hesitation in his mind and said, \u201cXiao Hei, I want to use this random Skill Card.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that you want to use this random Skill Card (Rare)?\u201d Xiao Hei asked.\u201cConfirmed!\u201d he replied.Many different images flashed on the front of the card replacing the question mark.The images changed so fast that it made Lin Huang dizzy for a moment looking at them.About 10 seconds later, the images stopped flashing and the card started shining in a bright white.Soon the white light faded, and a new card appeared.\u201cCongratulations, you have received a Body Movement Skill \u2013 Spectral Snowsteps.\u201dLin Huang was excited to hear that he received a Body Movement Skill.He was planning to pick a better Body Movement Skill to train himself if he made it out of the war alive. His mind was set on training to be even better at using his sword.He did not expect that he would randomly have picked the card.He took a good look at the new Skill Card immediately.The top of the card was a pair of feet stepping on snow, however, there was no trail of the feet on the snow.Lin Huang then turned the card around and read the detailed description.\u201cSkill Card\u201d\u201cSkill Name: Spectral Snowsteps\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cSkill Category: Body Movement\u201d\u201cSkill Level: Gold-rank\u201d\u201cStatus: Available\u201d\u201cRemarks: This is a unique body movement skill. There is no rank limitation, it\u2019s effect changes with the host\u2019s ability.\u201dCard Remarks: Mediocre\u201d\u201cThat is a good skill!\u201d Lin Huang was over the moon after he read the description. There was no level limitation to utilize this card, he was concerned that it could only be summoned with Life Power.He then looked at his Exclusive Card, and as expected, there was an additional skill.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Great Sword Scriptures (Sword Skill)\u201d\u201cSkill 3: Robust (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 4: Spectral Snowsteps (Body Movement)\u201d\u201cSummon authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable number of summons: 1\u201d\u201cRemark: You still suck\u2026\u201dHe glared at the last remark given by Xiao Hei and ignored the remark once again.He was happy that he gained a Body Movement skill, and he then put his attention to the battle.As everyone was focused on the battle, nobody noticed what he was doing.Soon, the monsters broke through the second line of defense and ran towards the third line ferociously.It was a group of Ox Devils, but there were not many of them.Lin Huang and his troop did not have to put much effort into killing them all.Almost four hours into the morning, the third line of defense where Lin Huang and his troop were guarding had encountered 11 attacks. However, they managed to kill the monsters easily.Until the afternoon, which was six hours later, the third line was attacked 22 times.Lin Huang could feel that the intensity of the attacks rising.Not only Lin Huang, but Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng noticed it as well.They started to worry as it was not a good sign.When the sky turned dark, the monster became even more furious.They did not know if it was caused by the sun setting or the Transcendent monster was hypnotizing them to attack with a greater vengeance.From six o\u2019clock in the evening to midnight, the pressure rose for Lin Huang and the gang within the six hours as they had encountered 46 attacks. They were attacked almost every seven minutes.Although they were stressed, none of them complained as they knew that the Gold and Silver Hunters in front of them had it even harder than they did.Yi Yeyu had been directing her attention at Lin Huang\u2019s location.She was worried that they could not take the assault. However, Lin Huang and the gang proved themselves again and again with each attack wave that came their way.They showed the other hunters that their small team was no weaker than any Copper Hunter when they banded together.A couple of Copper Hunters who had doubted their abilities in the beginning were worried that this group of young men would slow them down but soon, they were impressed by this bunch of young men that stood with them defending the region.Under Lin Huang\u2019s leadership and instruction, the young men were very cooperative.Although they panicked occasionally, the situation was handled by Lin Huang and Bai.Lin Huang\u2019s performance had gotten the attention of many hunters in the area. Although he was not even iron-level, he had shown his strength and abilities that surpassed any iron-level hunter. Even some of the iron-level rank-3 monsters were killed in no more than five slashes of his sword.Bai\u2019s performance was impressive too. Apart from some of the monsters that had extraordinarily strong defensive abilities, he basically killed the monsters in single attacks.Because of the both of them, the 12 men team managed to stand strong.Soon, it was the wee hours of the morning. Although it was so late in the night, it was not as silent as usual. The ruckus and roars of the men and monsters could be heard from all around.It could have been the noisiest day Lin Huang ever experienced ever since he knew.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNoises of angry monsters and humans shouting were deafening, and gunshots could be heard from the heart of the battlefield.When it got late, the monsters got even more bloodthirsty!The third line of defense was broken a couple of times as the monsters got stronger.Fortunately, Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng managed to arrive on time and handle the situation.However, the people were getting worried. From the outlook of the situation, it was certain that the third line of defense would collapse. It was just a matter of time\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were 357 columns that were filled with white light, and there were only three gray columns left in his Life Wheel.\u201cXiao Hei, cut off the Life Light transfer between me and Bai now!\u201d Lin Huang instructed Xiao Hei immediately when he noticed what was happening to his Life Wheel.\u201cYou have requested to cut off the transfer of Life Light with Bai. Disconnection is complete!\u201dXiao Hei fulfilled Lin Huang\u2019s request immediately.The disconnection was to allow the Life Light to be transferred to Bai as the Life Light in Lin Huang\u2019s Life Wheel was almost full.Once the 360 columns were full, Lin Huang could get a Life Light Baptism if he was to kill an Iron-level monster and he would be upgraded to iron-level.However, the upgrade to Iron-level would come together with a Life Seed.The Life Seed was used to strengthen talents that one was born with or had the potential to wield so it was crucial to choose wisely.Life Seeds were categorized into five which were the Elemental System, Strengthening System, Psychic System, Special System and Compound System.Lin Huang knew which Life Seed he wanted since the beginning. He wanted the Sword Strengthening System, which could only be obtained by killing monsters with his sword.However, no monster that fit the criteria existed in the monster horde so Lin Huang chose not to upgrade to iron-level at the moment.It was six in the morning. The sun rose from the horizon shedding light on the battlefield.Lin Huang just chopped off a monster\u2019s head, panting as he did. He looked up to the direction of sunrise.\u201cThe sun is finally out\u2026\u201d he thought.The past two hours was hell as every minute and every second was a torment to them.He chose not to upgrade to iron-level. Although he had his passive skill \u2018Robust\u2019 to support him, his strength was not comparable to the young men of iron-level rank-3.Every swing of the sword was getting harder for him.\u201cLin Huang, are you okay?\u201d Zhou Le and the rest noticed that Lin Huang was slowing down.\u201cShouldn\u2019t be a problem over a short period of time. But if the situation persists, I think I won\u2019t be able to take this anymore,\u201d Lin Huang honestly voiced out his concern. He estimated that he could stand for a maximum of two hours.\u201cWhy not you take a rest. We can handle it,\u201d Zhou Le suggested although he knew that without Lin Huang, the task would be much more difficult.\u201cIt\u2019s no use even if I rest, the most I could take would be a couple more hours. Furthermore, it\u2019s not only me, everyone is exhausted. The line will collapse if we give in, it\u2019s just the matter of time,\u201d Lin Huang shook his head while looking at the gap at the canyon mouth. \u201cWe need to solve the root of the problem!\u201d he concluded.\u201cWhat is the root of the problem?\u201d Zhou Le asked immediately.\u201cThe breakthrough of the defensive line is caused by the amount of monsters which is far too many. Our people are limited, our strength is depleted too. The solution is easy to say, but very hard to do. We have to minimize the size of the entrance and funnel down the monsters. We have to make the gap at the canyon mouth smaller,\u201d Lin Huang said.\u201cHowever, looking at the situation now, we can\u2019t move the giant rocks to the canyon mouth. Each giant rock is the size of a small mountain, none of our storage spaces are big enough to contain it. All we can do is rely on the residents in the foothold. Even with tools, we would need a few hundred people to move the giant rocks to the canyon mouth. Now that the battle is this intense, the residents can\u2019t be moving the giant rocks as they would be the targeted by the monsters once they enter the battlefield,\u201d he said. Although Lin Huang found the root of the problem, he could not think of a suitable solution.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary that we use giant rocks to block the canyon mouth, am I right? Why not we just pile up the dead bodies to block the canyon mouth? Since most of the monsters have strong solid bodies, the corpses would work great. If not, we can pile even more together to further strengthen the wall,\u201d Zhou Le said casually.Hearing what Zhou Le said, Lin Huang was stunned and let out a laugh, \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. It\u2019s brilliant!\u201dLin Huang then proposed the idea to Yi Yeyu.Yi Yeyu checked the message that was sent by Lin Huang. She was stunned at first, but soon she showed her excitement and forwarded the message to Yi Zheng.Yi Zheng was happy too. He then spread the proposal to some of the Gold Hunters and they started to collect dead bodies.Soon, the dead bodies were piled up into a small hill which became a line of defense by itself. Yi Zheng spilled oil on the dead bodies to avoid the monsters from climbing over them.With the piling corpses, the canyon mouth became smaller and smaller.When it was near noon, the canyon mouth was only about 300 meters wide, which was what Lin Huang had hoped for at the beginning of the attack.The people\u2019s fear was finally reduced.The monsters which attacked Lin Huang\u2019s third line decreased from every few minutes to every half an hour.Even the second line of defense was much relaxed now.Yi Zheng stood on top of the giant rock and gave Lin Huang a thumbs up.Lin Huang then pointed at Zhou Le who was next to him and sent a message to Yi Yeyu to explain that it was Zhou Le\u2019s idea.The next afternoon, everyone was more relaxed. They even had time to eat and rest.Seeing that the sun setting behind the mountains, Yi Yeyu prayed that nothing would go wrong that night and that the human transcendent would arrive on time to kill the transcendent monster to end this once and for all.It was six in the evening, and the sky was getting dark. The monstrous roars were getting more intense.Yi Zheng stood on top of the giant rock and looked into the distance.He saw a pack of what looked like 100,000 monsters approaching the foothold. He was about to say something when his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring vibrated.Lin Huang and the rest\u2019s ring vibrated at the same time.Since he had a moment to respond, Lin Huang opened his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA news alert popped up on the page.\u201cSince eight in the morning yesterday, a monster outbreak happened on the east side of Division7. The density and coverage of the attack this time was at the small footholds No.7D120, No.7D122 and No.7D123. A wide area was destroyed by the beasts. There were no survivors. The death toll has reached 670,000 people. The same has happened to the small foothold No.7D121, but the condition there is unclear. There are transcendent humans making their way there. We will give you a full update when we receive more details\u2026.\u201dSeeing the news, most of them who were relaxed became tense.\u201cThat\u2019s not good\u2026\u201dLin Huang frowned. The footholds nearby had been destroyed by monsters. The only one standing was Snowy Mountain Town. The transcendent monster must be targeting Snowy Mountain Town next. Since it was hurt by the human transcendent around that area, it would not stop until it has killed all the people around the foothold!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The amount of monsters would be four times more than the original number!The other hunters knew that too, the atmosphere on the battlefield turned ice cold.\u201cLin Huang, do you have any plans?\u201d Zhou Le said in a weak voice and took a deep breath to calm himself down while anticipating what Lin Huang would suggest.Lin Huang shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else we can do but fight. Let\u2019s just pray that the human transcendent arrives soon.\u201dSoon it was night time again. Although everyone was less enthusiastic from the bad news, the battle had to go on.None of the 1000 hunters were slacking. They were defending their own line of defense.When it was nine at night, Yi Zheng heard a subtle sound coming from afar.It was approaching the canyon at the speed of light.He looked far in the distance, but his vision was clear even at night.He saw a massive group of monsters coming.He could not see clearly what kind of monsters they were due to the dust that surrounded them, but he could feel the ground shake beneath his feet.Many hunters felt the tremors too.Lin Huang knew monsters that could cause this must be really big and there were many of them.Without confirming what kind of monsters they were, Yi Zheng shouted to the people from his perch on top of the giant rock.At such a time, he should have been more enthusiastic to motivate the people or else the defense lines would be easily broken if the low moral persisted.\u201cEverybody, the monsters from the few areas are here. I believe everyone can feel the ground trembling and you should know very well that there will be more monsters coming our way. This is the last foothold in the area. The transcendent monster will not give up until it destroys this foothold too. The only choice we have right now is to fight! Besides that, there\u2019s no other solution.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s 9:23 p.m. right now. The Hunter Association said the transcendent human will be here within 48 hours. There are another nine hours to that 48-hour mark. This means, we have to fight for another nine hours and we will be saved.\u201d\u201cI believe everyone has heard about the transcendent human the association has sent. He is Yu Chanli, he was no.4 on the Division7 Gold Hunter Leaderboard. He\u2019s a strong Imperial Censor as well. Now that the transcendent monster is badly injured, as soon as Yu Chanli is here, it will definitely be killed, without a doubt. With that, the monster horde will retreat immediately,\u201d he assured them.\u201cNow that the other footholds have been destroyed, that\u2019s over now. We need to put this behind us. Let\u2019s do this together! From now onwards, we only have one goal which is to guard this place for nine hours! We fight for this one and only goal! Because as long as we fulfill this goal, all of us here and the 200,000 residents in Snowy Mountain Town will survive!\u201dWhat Yi Zheng said was extremely effective. It was unclear if it was Yu Chanli\u2019s name which they had heard before or the fact that they only had nine hours left to fight, all of them were energized.Even Lin Huang repeated to himself, \u201cThis is the last nine hours, we must hold on!\u201dAfter the motivational speech, Yi Zheng turned around and looked at the monsters in the distance.They were Giant Armored Elephants. Although they belonged to a species of mutated monsters, they were like no other, mainly because they were huge!All of them were at least 10 meters tall. They were considered giants among all monsters. Even Tyrant who was iron-level rank-3 was considered petite when it stood among these monsters.From its trunk, the Giant Armored Elephant had metal armor all the way to its hip.The same metal was fitted on its head too. Its entire head was covered in metal armor, and only its eyes and flapping ears were showing.The metal parts were not fixed, they were born with it.Such monster had bones made partially of metal. This gave them a terrifying defense that no other monster possessed.Yi Zheng frowned while he looked at this group of Giant Armored Elephants.Their existence presented a very real danger to the lines of defense as their body weight and impact could easily destroy the giant rock wall.Once the wall was destroyed, the rest of the monsters would rush in.\u201cYeyu, you stay here, I\u2019ll handle the damn elephants!\u201d Yi Zheng told Yi Yeyu while holding a fine sword in his hand.His white robe fluttered in the wind. He then hopped towards the giant rocks below.He stepped on the monsters\u2019 backs and heads and ran towards the Giant Armored Elephants.Looking on as her brother left, Yi Yeyu was not concerned for Yi Zheng\u2019s safety. With his ability, as long as the transcendent monster did not show, he was invincible.Although the Giant Armored Elephants were big, most of them were only iron-level or bronze-level. Only some of them were silver-level. They could not threaten Yi Zheng at all.Soon, Yi Zheng was among the Giant Armored Elephants. Every swing he took with his fine sword, a gold flash could be seen. He pierced through a Giant Armored Elephant\u2019s head.Not long later, he managed to kill a few hundred Giant Armored Elephants.Yi Zheng returned right after he killed all the Giant Armored Elephants. He did not delay his actions as he knew that the Giant Armored Elephants were just the first horde of monsters who came. There would be more coming their way.He came back to the giant rock and stood on top with his hands folded like nothing had happened.Yi Yeyu who was standing across him gave him a thumbs up. He looked the other way. He wanted to look cool but could not help but smile at his sister.Soon, there was a new horde of monsters along the horizon. However, Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng remained where they stood as those monsters did not possess the ability to break through the wall.The both of them allowed them to forward so they would be behind other monsters that were closing in. Then, there were more monsters coming from far away. The monsters were filling up the grassland outside of the canyon.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust when Yi Zheng was ready to kill all the monsters beneath the giant rock, he heard a rustling sound behind him.He turned around and saw black dots on the top of the mountains behind the Snowy Mountain Town. The black dots stood out even more against the white mountains as they dashed downwards.As she noticed where Yi Zheng was looking, Yi Yeyu looked at the mountains behind her as well.She screamed. \u201cAren\u2019t those Sand Spiders? I hate spiders!\u201d she squealed.Yi Zheng\u2019s lips were twitching when he heard what Yi Yeyu said. \u201cNow, pull yourself together, this is not about you hating spiders.

Four pairs of them were more than three meters long to help them move while two pairs of forelegs were as sharp as blades. They were meant for hunting.They had a carapace of hollow spikes on their rear section and there was an opening in the midsection for laying eggs.During their spawning season, they would lure their prey into a cave before injecting all their eggs into the prey\u2019s body. They would then wrap the prey in a spider web.After the eggs hatch inside the prey\u2019s body, the baby spiders would consume the organs of the living prey and rupture the prey\u2019s abdomen to join their family.In reality, these spiders possessed a unique characteristic in that all of them were hermaphrodites [1]. Oftentimes, two Sand Spiders would spar and the winner would then impregnate the loser.Occasionally, two or more Sand Spiders would get embroiled in the fight and sometimes, the situation would develop in a much more complicated manner where all of the spiders involved in the fight might end up pregnant. The most bizarre thing about this was that the baby spiders would then be unable to identify their father\u2026\u2026The Sand Spiders that filled the top of the snowy mountains were crawling towards the bottom. They were fast, and by estimation, they would reach the bottom of the Snowy Mountains in an hour, more than 30 kilometers from the mouth of the canyon where Lin Huang and the rest were located.With Lin Huang\u2019s ability to see, he could only spot black dots on top of the Snowy Mountains and he could not tell what they were.Thankfully, Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng who were at gold-level managed to recognize the Sand Spiders and estimated their numbers. There were about 100,000 of them.If the Sand Spiders were to break through the line of defense, it would take them less than an hour to massacre the population of 200,000.Yi Zheng panicked. They did not have enough people here and there was a horde of Sand Spiders coming.\u201cAre there any heavy gunmasters here?!\u201d Yi Zheng bellowed from the top.Heavy gunmasters were a branch profession of the gunmen class and were experts in powerful and destructive long-distance attacks.Lin Huang wanted to be a gunman as his second profession but not the heavy gunmaster. He was planning to take the light gunmaster or even the sniper route.Gunmasters belonged to the battlefield, which Lin Huang was not keen of.In reality, most of the hunters would not consider this profession.As expected, nobody responded to Yi Zheng.He was hoping for a miracle when he asked, but when he received silence in return, his heart sank.Apart from a medium gunmaster, there was no one else who could attack from more than 30 kilometers away.\u201cBrother, what is there to worry about?\u201d someone asked.Yi Yeyu glanced at Yi Zheng in disdain. While everyone was watching, she then attached an eight-meters-long cannon on her left hand within seconds.Yi Zheng was taken aback and asked her carefully, \u201cI remembered that you didn\u2019t even pass your beginner gunmaster assessment? Without the license, how did you manage to purchase this?\u201d\u201cIs there anything that you can\u2019t buy in the black market?\u201d Yi Yeyu said.\u201cAren\u2019t the Firearm Relics that are being sold on the black market expensive\u2026 Did you borrow money just to buy this?\u201d Yi Zheng suddenly recalled Yi Yeyu borrowing money from him earlier.He found it strange too as Yi Yeyu should have enough pocket money for her daily expenditure but he lent some money to her anyway.\u201cSo, you\u2019re not dumb after all,\u201d said Yi Yeyu while slotting in a few Life Crystals into the cannon\u2019s energy tank.Yi Zheng felt the pain when he saw her actions because the smallest Life Crystal contained 100 years of Life Light. Each of such Life Crystals cost at least 10 million credit points. For such Firearm Relics, each attack would consume one Life Crystal.\u201cYi Yeyu, you\u2019re not a gunmaster, why would you buy this Firearm Relic? Which man would marry you if you spend like that?\u201d Yi Zheng wanted to teach her a lesson.\u201cMind your own business, aren\u2019t you single as well?!\u201d Yi Yeyu snapped.\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t borrow money from me to buy such nonsense like this!\u201d Yi Zheng was mad.\u201cI won\u2019t! So petty!\u201d Yi Yeyu scoffed and aimed the cannon at the Snowy Mountains.Seeing that, Yi Zheng stopped talking and leaped to the giant rock that she was standing on.He stood behind her and looked at the direction where the cannon was pointed towards, he then lifted the canyon slightly.\u201cWhat are you doing, I will miss the shot if we fire at this angle!\u201d Yi Yeyu stared at him.\u201cI\u2019ve told you that you don\u2019t have the talent to be a gunmaster yet you never heeded my advice.\u201d Yi Zheng shook his head and explained, \u201cA gunmaster would need to take the environment into consideration as well as the estimation of the attack\u2019s effect. In such situations, if you attack the location where the Sand Spiders are traversing, the effect would be limited. But if you attack the top of the Snowy Mountains, you could cause an avalanche that could potentially bury all of the spiders.\u201dYi Yeyu knew what he said was right so she did not argue any longer but she shot him a dissatisfied look.\u201cIf you lean your body forward like that, although Firearm Relics can absorb the recoil, a cannon of such size would have much stronger recoils.\u201d Yi Zheng patted her back.He then stood behind Yi Yeyu once again to reassess the angle of the cannon and nodded, \u201cFire now!\u201dAfter Yi Zheng\u2019s confirmation, Yi Yeyu launched the cannon.A radiant sphere was created at the mouth of the cannon and in a split second, it turned into a white glow and fired towards the snowy mountains.Yi Yeyu\u2019s body shook from the recoil, but she was held steady by a hand behind her.\u201cBang!\u201dThe white glow hit the top of the snowy mountain, and every part of it began to tremble.Soon, the snow at the peak collapsed. They were like ocean waves, gradually growing in size and speed. It then buried the black dots on top of the snowy mountains.Looking at the results, Yi Yeyu was over the moon.She was happy that she managed to kill more than 100,000 Sand Spiders in just one shot.She did not anticipate that to happen since she assumed she would need at least 20 shots to kill all of the spiders.\u201cNice!\u201d Yi Zheng gave her a thumb up.Yi Yeyu blushed. If not for Yi Zheng\u2019s mentoring, she would not have achieved such success.\u201cI will leave these mountains to you. If there are any monsters approaching from that direction, use the same method as you did just now,\u201d Yi Zheng instructed Yi Yeyu and leaped back to the giant rock that he was standing on before.The Sand Spiders were all buried beneath the snow close to Snowy Mountain Town. They were rolling towards the foot of the snowy mountains.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe snow was cascading towards the Snowy Mountain Town in waves. However, nothing could be seen outside of Snowy Mountain Town as it was covered by their line of defense.The crisis was solved just like that.Lin Huang was watching the entire thing from the beginning till the end.Watching the snow as it engulfed the sand spiders, he sighed,\u201cNo matter which world it is, the power of nature is always mesmerizing\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although many died, there were still many more that marched forward, fearless.Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng were forced to join the defense line to kill the monsters that successfully breached the giant rock.Yi Zheng\u2019s fine sword changed forms into a three-meter-long giant sword. He leaped and started killing the monsters.With every slash, he beheaded tens of monsters.On the other side, Yi Yeyu reloaded Life Crystals inside her treasure tool and continued shooting at monsters beneath where she stood.Although her aim was inaccurate, since there were monsters everywhere, no matter which direction she shot at, there were bound to be monsters dying.The 20 Gold Hunters taking refuge beneath the giant rock were exhausted from the battle that spanned two days and one night but they persevered.They were replenishing their Life Power with Life Crystals in between killings.However, no matter how many monsters they killed, there were others that managed to avoid their attacks and slip through into the second defense line.There were just too many monsters; they could only handle those that were within their reach while the rest had to be handled by the Silver Hunters to their rear.Silver Hunters who were on the second defense line consisted of the most people. There were more than 1000 of them, yet all of them were overburdened with the bulk of the monster horde which penetrated past the first line of defense. The pressure on them was similar to the Gold Hunters in front and none of them could spare a moment to rest, not even for a minute.The monsters were getting too close and there was not much space between them. 90% of the monsters that got to the second line of defense was killed by the Silver Hunters as they knew that the Copper Hunters in the third defense line were few in number. If too many monsters broke into the third line of defense, it would be spell calamity for the Copper Hunters.Therefore, they tried their best not to let any monsters succeed.Lin Huang and the gang were on the third line of defense, which was the most relaxed one as the burden was eased by the Gold and Silver Hunters in front of them. The monsters that managed to break into the third defense line were less than a tenth of the monsters that were in the mouth of the canyon.But as time went by, Lin Huang and the gang began to feel the pressure again because the monsters increased their attack frequency to an interval of six minutes per wave instead of the thirty in the past.Thankfully, Bai\u2019s attack rate did not lower for he was a killing machine. He massacred as many monsters as Lin Huang did.His Blood Power wings morphed into a variety of forms during battle and depending on each form, he could either chop off a head or pierce through a heart.He was highly efficient, so much so that Lin Huang was both amazed and ashamed.Of course, Lin Huang\u2019s performance was not too bad. With his iron sword, he transformed into a fine soldier. With the help of the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019, almost nothing could dodge his sword.As he obtained more experience in an actual battle, he now only needed three slashes to kill a monster instead of the usual five slashes.As long as the monster was not an iron-level rank-3, he could kill them in only one slash.He was also getting used to the Spectral Snowsteps movement technique where he moved like a ghost on the battlefield.Zhou Le and the rest assumed that Lin Huang was of royalty. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to possess such incredible abilities and terrifying combat strength.They were already iron-level rank-3 but they were far behind Lin Huang when it came to killing monsters.Lin Huang did not care about the number of cross-ranking kills he had done, how many card pieces he had accumulated or how many reward cards he had obtained. He even reduced drinking water and only took a sip when he absolutely needed to because there was no time for other distractions.Xiao Hei knew that he was in his combat mode and did not send any notifications to prevent Lin Huang from becoming distracted.Time passed by on the battlefield. Each passing minute and second felt like torture.Everyone was anticipating for the sun to rise and for dawn to arrive.As long as they held on until dawn, the human transcendent Yu Chanli would be here to kill that transcendent monster and everything would be over.Lin Huang surpassed his limit again and again. Compared to the rest, he was the only ordinary person on the battlefield.The physique he was born with could not be remedied by his combat strength.Even Zhou Le and the other young men who were iron-level rank-3 were extremely exhausted. Imagine Lin Huang who was not even iron-level.Many people noticed Lin Huang\u2019s performance; not only Zhou Le and the gang, but even the Copper Hunters around him were impressed by his skills.They clearly understood that Lin Huang was pushing himself beyond his capacity.Lin Huang knew his body condition very well. He did not stop swinging his sword because if he did, his body would collapse. He might not even be able to stand later.He told himself countless times, \u201cI can\u2019t stop! I can\u2019t stop! As long as I hold on for a couple more hours, it will be time!\u201dThe monsters\u2019 attacks on the battlefield became increasingly intense. Monsters roared throughout the battle.At approximately 3 o\u2019 clock in the wee hours of the morning, a terrifying monster roar echoed from a distance.The roar originated from beyond the Snowy Mountains but the shockwaves propagated through the people and dissipated in the grasslands outside the canyon.Everyone\u2019s heart pounded when they heard the roar. Even Lin Huang\u2019s heart started racing fast, he felt like they were being watched by something terrifying. It gave him goosebumps.The roar bolstered the monsters\u2019 morale and many of them began to ram against the giant rocks even though Lin Huang could tell that it would be painful.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMany of them even started to stack onto each other to get through the defense lines.Yi Zheng and Yi Yeyu frowned upon watching the monsters attempts to climb through the giant rocks. They did not expect this to happen during the last three hours.Just when Yi Zheng was thinking of what to do, he heard some noise coming from the Snowy Mountains.He turned around and saw something black covering the sky heading right towards his direction at an alarming pace. He took a closer look and gasped.\u201cOh no, the crows are back\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were heading towards the direction of the foothold at full speed.The crows were just as numerous or probably more than what Lin Huang saw the other day when he previously encountered them.Millions of crows in a flock together looked like a massive horde and it seems like there would be none that would be able to defeat them besides a Transcendent.Even Yi Zheng who was no.11 on the Division7 Gold Hunter Leaderboard avoided the crows.It was a nightmare. They could easily occupy a medium foothold if the transcendent was absent.The hunters who were ready to stand their ground felt despair the moment they noticed the horde of crows.Millions of monsters were streaming in from the grasslands and innumerable crows were darting in from the back. They did not have enough manpower to protect the foothold after all\u2026Yi Yeyu looked like she was in doubt on the giant rocks, she regretted that she chose this foothold to be the location for the assessment.If Yi Zheng was not here, she was ready to die in battle.However, now that Yi Zheng was here, he would certainly not leave her behind. If she were to stay, she would lose her brother to the monsters. She was in dire straits\u2026Yi Zheng knew his sister very well. She was competitive and resilient, and though she may be hot tempered at times, she was a kind person.It was impossible for her to leave 200,000 people behind.Even if she were to pass by a foothold invaded by monsters, she would choose to fight no matter what.\u201cYeyu, use your green wooden door to send the kids away!\u201d Although Yi Zheng knew that Yi Yeyu would not agree to leave, he instructed her anyway.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving!\u201d Yi Yeyu stared at Yi Zheng.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t care for yourself, you have to consider this for the sake of our family. Our generation only has the both of us, we can\u2019t die here!\u201d Yi Zheng tried to talk her out of it, \u201cAnd those young men, especially Lin Huang, do you really want him to perish here? As long as we give him sufficient time, he could develop into a transcendent. We cannot lose him as well!\u201dAfter a moment of silence, she shouted at Yi Zheng,\u201dBrother, I\u2019ll pass you the green wooden door. Please bring Lin Huang and the rest with you, I will remain behind!\u201d\u201cWhat foolishness are you spouting? You must leave. You\u2019re my sister, listen to me!\u201d Yi Zheng exclaimed loudly.\u201cWe must think about the future of our generation. Since you are gifted with stronger abilities, if you live, our family\u2019s generation would grow stronger. Therefore, it would be better if I stay.\u201d Yi Zheng could not counter argue Yi Yeyu.The situation turned awkward for them.The crows were approaching.Some of the hunters in the lines of defense had lost their will to live; they were just preparing for what might eventually happen. The third line of defense did not have enough manpower as a couple of Silver Hunters on the second defense line were caught off guard. Everyone felt disheartened.Soon, the remaining defenses collapsed.Lin Huang and the rest were surrounded. Without the lines of defense in front of them, the ten young men were completely besieged by monsters.\u201cDon\u2019t panic guys. Let\u2019s form a line, do not let the monsters break through!\u201d Lin Huang yelled to the young men.After cooperating with Lin Huang, Zhou Le and the rest trusted Lin Huang more than anyone else. Lin Huang had not let them down.They quickly formed a defensive line even though they knew that it was very unlikely that they could survive the moment the crows arrived.However, under Lin Huang\u2019s leadership, they persevered. Lin Huang\u2019s heart was racing from the intense attacks.His body was much frailer compared to the rest and thus, any attack from the monsters could severely injure him or even kill him.The situation was vastly different now as they previously had a line of defense to shield their vanguard, significantly limiting the number of monsters which passed through to them.Now, however, there were monsters everywhere and they were besieged on all sides.He finally experienced the saying, \u2018dancing on the head of a pin\u2019 which meant that if he loses focus or gets distracted by something else, he could die at any given moment.\u201cWarning! You are now in an extremely dangerous environment. Your death rate would be 100% within half an hour. Would you like to execute emergency measures?!\u201dA warning was sent to Lin Huang\u2019s ears, it was the first time in a long while since he had heard Xiao Hei\u2019s voice.\u201cYes! What kind of solutions do you have?!\u201d Lin Huang asked immediately.\u201cBrowsing cards that could solve the situation\u2026 There are no cards that could help you right now\u2026\u201dLin Huang was troubled but moments later, Xiao Hei spoke again\u2026\u201cBased on the current situation, the most suitable card would be the Small Destruction Card.\u201d\u201cYou have three Monster Cards, nine Function Cards, 3657 iron-level Monster Card pieces\u2026 If you were to dissolve all the complete cards and piece them together, you would obtain 22557 Normal Card pieces. To redeem your first Small Destruction Card, you would need one million Normal Card pieces. The card pieces you have are insufficient to redeem a Small Destruction Card\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, why do I only have nine Function Cards? Bai\u2019s kills aside, I have done at least 500 cross-ranking kills these two days; shouldn\u2019t I receive cross-ranking cards?!\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re stuck on a level, the maximum cross-ranking kill reward you can obtain will be capped at 10 times. You will not get any rewards for cross-ranking kills after that.\u201dLin Huang did not know there was such an arrangement.He thought with Bai\u2019s help, it was not difficult for him to do cross-ranking kills where he could collect a massive amount of reward cards.It seemed like Xiao Hei noticed that people would take advantage of the situation and therefore limited this method to gain reward cards.\u201cSo, are there any other solutions for me?\u201d Lin Huang asked for an alternative.\u201cYou were given some protection when you were setting up your Goldfinger. You can only utilize the protection once. When you activate the protection, you will receive a card to solve the crisis you are encountering at that moment. Would you like to activate your one and only protection?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Lin Huang decided without thinking twice. He did not have the time to consider the repercussions as well as other alternatives seeing as there were none. If he did not utilize the protection right now, he might never be able to use it again.\u201cProtection has been activated\u2026 Integrating with your situation, you are given a Small Destruction Card!\u201d\u201cCongratulations, you have received a Small Destruction Card!\u201d\u201cDetecting solution \u2013 Small Destruction Card! Are you sure you want to use this card?\u201d\u201cHow can this card solve this crisis? What are its functions?\u201d Lin Huang did not have the time to look at the card in his body.\u201cSmall Destruction Card: It could annihilate every creature below transcendent. The maximum coverage would be 10,000 square kilometers.\u201d\u201cI would like to use this card to destroy all creatures besides humans and Bai.\u201d Lin Huang instructed.\u201cCreatures have been targeted, please choose your coverage.\u201dA map appeared on Lin Huang\u2019s mind and he had to choose his targets. The map revealed that the monsters were scattered everywhere. Lin Huang tagged all the monsters on the map, \u201cI have decided.\u201d\u201cCoverage selection completed. Please confirm the Small Destruction Card\u2019s activation.\u201d\u201cYes, kill them all!\u201d Lin Huang nodded his head firmly.In the next second, a grain-sized lighted spot appeared on Lin Huang\u2019s forehead.The spot looked like a miniature sun at three o\u2019clock. It then tore away from his forehead and floated into the sky, shining on the land.Everyone was shocked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon, a white glow dispersed from the light spot, creating a wave in the air.All the monsters except for Bai were carbonized due to the high temperature. They turned into dust and disappeared into the air. It was like snow meeting the scorching sun.The glow then dispersed far away.\u201cIs that magic?!\u201d Yi Yeyu stood on the giant rocks and saw what Lin Huang did, she was stunned.In a heartbeat, all the monsters were no more. As soon as the glow began to fade away, everyone cheered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He will hit puberty in a few years time. Boys love girls who are older.\u201d Yi Zheng chuckled.\u201cGo away!\u201d Yi Yeyu said angrily.All of a sudden, in the midst of all the cheering, everyone heard a strange laugh.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201dThe sound was near yet far and it felt like as if the laugh was echoing from different directions, all together at once!It gave everyone goosebumps, it was like a cool breeze brushing into their bones.\u201cWho is that?!\u201d Yi Zheng shouted while hanging onto his thin sword. Everyone clutched their weapons too.\u201cCould it be the transcendent monster\u2026\u201d Lin Huang frowned because there were no other possibilities he could think of.Everyone did not expect the transcendent monster, the mastermind of all monsters to appear after all monsters have perished. The threat of one transcendent was definitely more frightening than all monsters\u2019 put together.\u2018Everything below the transcendent were ants\u2019. This saying had become the truth.With a flick of a finger, the transcendent could kill a thousand of hunters.\u201cMaster, I am taking a wild guess that you started the monster attack?\u201d Yi Zheng placed both of his hands in front of his chest and asked politely in the direction of the Snowy Mountains.\u201dHe was trying to buy more time to figure out where this beast was. It was near four o\u2019clock, right before dawn which was two hours before Yu Chanli was supposed to appear.\u201cHuman fella, do you think I would let you go just because you speak to me politely?\u201d A spooky voice replied.\u201cHehe\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect to meet a descendant of God here\u2026\u201dA black python wrapped its body around the Snowy Mountains. Its purple eyes stared deadly at Lin Huang with greed.\u201cI\u2019m going to eat you!\u201d\u201cDescendant of God?!\u201d The people whispered among one another.The people finally understood how Lin Huang manage to use such magic to kill millions of monsters just now.\u201cSo you\u2019re here for me?\u201d Lin Huang pointed to himself, confused.\u201cOf course, human fella. If not for you, why would I let my clone attack the human transcendent who is making his way here?!\u201d Although the black python had no expression, Lin Huang could see in its eyes that it was playing with Lin Huang\u2019s mind.\u201cI know you guys are buying time for the transcendent to save you but what you did not know was that he is being attacked by my clone. The transcendent hasn\u2019t got a clue that it is a clone and it will not be here in two hours to rescue all of you.\u201dThere were loud sighs and some screams from those who were afraid.\u201cWhat, are you disappointed to hear such news?\u201d The black python was enjoying the mind game it was playing.Lin Huang quietly communicated with Xiao Hei, \u201cXiao Hei, is there any way to kill this monster?\u201d\u201cWith your condition, your death rate would be 100%. You are not strong enough, there\u2019s no solution to that.\u201dSuddenly, Yi Yeyu started to speak.She bowed to the Snowy Mountains, \u201cMaster, I haven\u2019t known Lin Huang for a very long time, but during the time that I did, I found him to be admirable. I would like to make a confession to him. Since you are going to kill us all, could master allow me a couple of minutes to fulfill my last wish? I will also need my brother as my witness.\u201dYi Zheng did not know what she was doing, he thought to himself, \u201cDid she really like Lin Huang all along?\u201d\u201cHuman are such irritating creatures. Why do you confess before you die, what have you been doing on days where you are alive and well? Alright, I\u2019ll give you three minutes but I warn you human lady, don\u2019t mess with me. Or else I\u2019ll show you what death feels like!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking, master. I do not dare mess with you. I only have a few words to say.\u201d Yi Yeyu said while she waved at Yi Zheng.She then leaped downwards and walked towards Lin Huang. Although Yi Zheng did not know what Yi Yeyu was up to, he followed her anyway.Almost everyone was confused. They could not figure out Yi Yeyu\u2019s plan.Yi Yeyu was popular in the Division7 hunter community. After all, she was one of the Gold Hunters who made it among the 1000 Gold Hunters and she was a woman.Alongside her powerful brother, many hunters admired her.But now, it looks like this incredible woman was about to confess her love to a young man who was not even an iron-level. It was absolutely shocking to many bachelors in the crowd.They walked to Lin Huang, Yi Yeyu held his hand and smiled sweetly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang was just as confused but he could sense that Yi Yeyu was not here to confess to him.Yi Yeyu put her the other hand on Yi Zheng\u2019s arm and smiled,\u201dBrother, please be my witness today\u2026\u201dBefore she even finished talking, she pushed the both of them down. The green wooden door sprung open behind them and they fell into the door.Suddenly, a dark glow was shot and the green wooden door was destroyed.\u201cLady, how dare you lie to me?!\u201d The black python hissed from the Snowy Mountains.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yi Yeyu was beginning to spit blood because she was hurt by the attack.The black python hissed loudly from the top of the Snowy Mountains.The voice sounded like it was a spiritual attack. Lin Huang and the rest who were 10 kilometers away felt a headache after hearing the roar.Suddenly, the dark beam was shot again. While the rest were panicking, the beam shot through Yi Yeyu\u2019s back and pierced through her belly.A hole that was the size of an adult\u2019s fist appeared on Yi Yeyu\u2019s belly, it was see-through.Yi Yeyu spat blood again and fell to the floor. Lin Huang rush to carry her.Yi Zheng was in disbelief as he saw it all. He did not know how to react but to hold her hand.\u201cYeyu!\u2019 Looking at his dying sister, Yi Zheng\u2019s hands were shaking.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 This is all my fault\u2026\u201d Yi Yeyu did not have the strength to talk anymore but she managed to say, \u201cIf it was not for me\u2026 All of you wouldn\u2019t be here\u2026\u201d\u201cStupid girl, you\u2019re my sister.

I am sorry for not being able to protect you\u2026\u201d Yi Zheng said through his tears.Lin Huang\u2019s eyes were watery too.\u201cI have not seen you cry since I was five years old. Yi Yeyu lifted a finger and wiped the tears off Yi Zheng\u2019s face, \u201cDo you still remember\u2026 That time when I was bullied by a bunch of older kids, you stood up to them and when they punched and kicked you, you neither said anything nor did you fight back\u2026 and after I asked you why didn\u2019t you cry, you said, you\u2019re a man and that even if you died, you would never cry in front of your sister. You were only seven at the time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I broke my promise\u2026\u201d Yi Zheng tried to chuckle.Yi Yeyu then turned her head slowly to Lin Huang, \u201cI want you to know that you are the most extraordinary man I have ever met and I don\u2019t want you to die here\u2026 If you live, you could be a man as good as my brother.\u201dLin Huang nodded without saying a word.\u201cYou want to see him grow?\u201d Said a spooky voice. The black python said cunningly, \u201cI will make sure that never happens!\u201dA bunch of black strings appeared out of thin air and tied a knot around Lin Huang\u2019s waist. Lin Huang was pulled in the direction of the black python\u2019s mouth.\u201cOh no, I\u2019m going to die. It\u2019s true that a traveler\u2019s chances of death were quite likely\u2026\u201dLin Huang\u2019s thought was cut short by a feeling of release.He was confused and realized that he was floating in front of the black python\u2019s mouth and the black strings around his waist were gone.Yi Zheng and the rest were watching as Lin Huang\u2019s body froze in the air and there was fear and panic in the black python\u2019s eyes.\u201cDie!\u201dA giant crystal fell from the sky and a giant palm smashed it onto the black python.The black python\u2019s body seemed as small as an ant under the giant palm. Before the giant crystal landed on the ground, its body was completely flat on the ground, its eyes were hopeless.The gigantic Snowy Mountains were shaking from the attack. It felt as if God was punishing the Earth.Lin Huang stared blankly as the giant palm that looked like the hand of Buddha landed one meter in front of him.The Snowy Mountains collapsed into flatland after the attack.The black python was buried by the Snowy Mountains with its head smashed.\u201cThat was scary\u2026\u201d Lin Huang exclaimed not because he witnessed how the black python was killed, but because he was standing very close to black python, but felt no impact at all.Even the Snowy Mountain Town was not damaged and the people not harmed by the collapse of the mountain.It was obvious that the person who saved Lin Huang was far more powerful than the black python.\u201cHow are you, sir?\u201d A stern yet warm voice came from not far away.Lin Huang looked towards the horizon; Xue Luo was walking towards him on air with her bare feet. There was an old man with a white beard behind her.\u201cLady Xue Luo?!\u201d Lin Huang was surprised; he thought he would never see her again. He looked at the old man with confusion, \u201cMay I know who this is?\u201d\u201cMister Lin, I am Bing Wang. I don\u2019t blame you for not recognizing me because I know I look different.\u201d The old man laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s Sir Bing Wang\u2026\u201d\u201cWas it Xue Luo who had saved me?\u201d Lin Huang tried to connect the dots.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Xue Luo smiled and shook her head.\u201cMister Lin, it has been more than 700 years that I last made an appearance. It was me who saved you.\u201d Bing Wang explained.\u201cOh, thank you so much Sir Bing Wang and you too lady Xue Luo.\u201d Lin Huang did not know that Bing Wang was so powerful that he could kill a transcendent monster with only one hand.\u201cLet me take out its soul for you. When you became a transcendent, you can train it into your battle soul.\u201d Xue Luo then disappeared.Bing Wang and Lin Huang remained.\u201cThis snake is stupid. It saw Mister Lin\u2019s act just now and thought it was magic. It thought you were the descendant of a god.\u201d Bing Wang shook his head and laughed, \u201cIf he did not target you, lady Xue Luo wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to intrude.\u201dLin Huang did not pay attention to what Bing Wang said and instead asked, \u201cSir Bing Wang, could you help my friend?\u201dBing Wang looked at Yi Yeyu and knew that she was dying. He shook his head, \u201cThe lady\u2019s Life Wheel has collapsed and her Life Light is almost gone, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dLin Huang was upset, but Bing Wang spoke again, \u201cHowever, if my master is willing to try, there might be hope.\u201d\u201cLady Xue Luo!\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s eyes brightened up. He just recalled that Xue Luo belonged to the gods. Perhaps she could save Yi Yeyu.Hearing Lin Huang\u2019s cry, Xue Luo walked towards them with a small, black snake on her hand. The snake was semi-transparent, it looked magical.She then passed the snake to Lin Huang, \u201cI have taken away this black python\u2019s consciousness. Now you can keep it in your Life Wheel and cultivate it. You can train it when you have reached the level of a transcendent, it will be your strong battle soul. Although it has mutated once, there\u2019s a small amount of dragon blood in this black python. If you cultivate it properly, there\u2019s a possibility for it to mutate a second time and its ability will then transform.\u201dLin Huang brushed what Xue Luo said aside and as soon as she finished talking, he asked, \u201cLady Xue Luo, I know that you haven\u2019t been involved in what\u2019s happening in this world for more than 700 years but I need to ask a favor of you.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to help the lady over there?\u201d Xue Luo looked at Yi Yeyu\u2019s direction and looked at the snake on her hand, \u201cTo piece her Life Wheel together, we would need a transcendent soul. Are you willing to give up this monster\u2019s soul containing the blood of dragon in exchange for her life?\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s more important!\u201d Lin Huang raised his voice.\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201d Xue Luo passed the snake to Lin Huang, \u201cKeep this.\u201d\u201cI thought you need this to save her?\u201d Lin Huang pushed the snake away.\u201cI was messing around with you; I have other monster souls with me to fix her Life Wheel.\u201d Xue Luo smiled playfully. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t keep this, I will not save her.\u201dLin Huang snatched the snake from her.Xue Luo brought the both of them and descended from the sky in front of everybody\u2019s presence.Although they had seen the giant palm earlier, they insisted to stand in front of Yi Yeyu to protect her.\u201cLin Huang, who are these people?\u201d A person asked Lin Huang.\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to explain, this lady could save Yi Yeyu, please step aside.\u201d The rest moved without asking further.Xue Luo walked to Yi Yeyu and carried her; she was breathing her last breath.Yi Zheng heard what Lin Huang said and looked at Xue Luo with hope.\u201cPut her on the ground laying upwards, the rest of you please step aside.\u201d Xue Luo wanted some personal space. After placing Yi Yeyu on the ground, Yi Zheng stepped aside quietly.Xue Luo placed her palm on Yi Yeyu\u2019s chest and there was a layer of ice flowing into Yi Yeyu\u2019s body.A moment later, Xue Luo smiled and mumbled to herself, \u201cInteresting body physique, I have just the monster soul for you.\u201dA semi-transparent crimson bird appeared on Xue Luo\u2019s palm. She tapped the crimson bird and it bird flew in between Yi Yeyu\u2019s eyebrows.A thin layer of ice spread across her body and soon her entire body was covered in ice.It was visibly seen that Yi Yeyu\u2019s belly was healing very quickly. Everyone started whispering among themselves. A new Life Wheel was being pieced together.It was different from an ordinary Life Wheel. Now, there was a strange red pattern in the middle of the Life Wheel which looked like a big, crimson bird with wide wings\u2026\u2026\u201cAm I dead?\u201d Yi Yeyu felt she was placed in the dark.She recalled a description about death written by an author she liked, \u2019Death is the loneliness of human consciousness in the dark. It cannot be seen, nothing can be heard and nothing can be touched. There is nothing in death. That is the ultimate place where all humans belong\u2026\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNow that I think about it, the description is similar to what I\u2019m feeling right now\u2026\u201dYi Yeyu snorted.She was not sure how long had passed, centuries or perhaps just seconds. In the darkness, Yi Yeyu had lost her grasp of time.A light dawned upon her. It felt like a black veil was torn and a crystal-carved hand was extending to her in the midst of the darkness.\u201cWhat a beautiful hand\u2026\u201d Yi Yeyu held it, it was cold. The hand pulled her out of the darkness with such force. She felt a shake and when she opened her eyes, she saw a bunch of people surrounding her.Just then, there were cheers exclaiming, \u201cShe\u2019s alive!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the injury had healed. There was nothing unusual as she touched it gently and there was no scar on the wound to show it anymore.However, the attack had clearly happened as there was a large tear on her shirt and blood stains around it, the indication that it was not just an illusion, and that she was attacked by the black python not long ago.\u201cYou have her to thank. Miss Xue Luo saved your life!\u201d As soon as Yi Zheng finished his sentence, he turned to Xue Luo and immediately expressed his gratitude.\u201cMiss Xue Luo?\u201d Yi Yeyu was stunned. She could not recall her name as a member of the hunting party. Gazing at Xue Luo, she immediately noticed her right hand.That moment, she remembered the incident as she stared at Xue Luo\u2019s right hand. She then said, \u201cI remember your hand. You\u2019re the one who pulled me out of the dark. Thank you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Mister Lin Huang saved my life, and he asked for my help to save you, so I did him a favor,\u201d Xue Luo smiled as she said. Xue Luo treated her in a much friendlier manner than others.\u201cThank you, Lin Huang!\u201d Yi Yeyu looked at Lin Huang and said.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re fine,\u201d Lin Huang nodded his head as he said.\u201cMister, may I speak with you privately?\u201d Xue Luo turned towards Lin Huang and said in a low voice.\u201cExcuse me for a moment,\u201d Lin Huang said Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng. He then left together with Xue Luo.Xue Luo waved her hand. She brought Lin Huang and Bing Wang along and they stepped up on a giant rock.She walked straight to the side of the rock, sat down and patted the rock surface and said, \u201cMister, please have a seat.\u201dHe did not seem to hesitate and sat beside her.Bing Wang then stood behind the both of them.There were two moons, a red and a purple moon, lighting up the night sky. The ground looked like it was covered by spun yarns of different colors, creating a mysterious shade of light.\u201cMiss Xue Luo, are you leaving?\u201d Lin Huang asked as he saw Xue Luo was silently looking at the moonlight.\u201cYes, it\u2019s time for me to leave,\u201d Xue Luo said and nodded her head. \u201cI have seen the moons of this world for too long,\u201d she continued.Lin Huang paused for a moment in thought and asked, \u201cWhen do you plan to depart? We\u2019ll see you off then.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re leaving shortly,\u201d Xue Luo\u2019s answered. Her response took Lin Huang by surprise.Lin Huang then composed himself and nodded his head. He had no idea how to keep the conversation going.After a moment of silence, Xue Luo suddenly raised her head and looked at Lin Huang, looking serious, \u201cMister, I don\u2019t know if I should ask you about this, but\u2026\u201d She trailed off.\u201cJust ask me whatever you would like to know. I\u2019ll try my best to answer,\u201d he said, trying to calm her nervousness. Lin Huang turned to face her and their eyes met. He then quickly shifted his gaze away from her after a brief awkward moment.\u201cMister, do you think it\u2019s right or wrong for a protoss and a human to fall in love with each other?\u201d She asked softly. Xue Luo was being very honest as this question had been a problem troubling her for more than 700 years.\u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong when it comes to love. When you fall for someone and it ends up being a bad relationship, that does not mean all relationships are bad. It only indicates that you met the wrong person. If a protoss and a human truly loved each other, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong,\u201d he replied. He was actually taken aback by her forwardness but spoke his mind regardless.Lin Huang felt that this was a serious topic. To ease the tenseness, he then switched the topic and told her a story.\u201cI\u2019ve read a story quite like that before. There was a man named Bei Feng. He fell in love with many women of different races who gave birth to many children of different races\u2026\u201dXue Luo was stunned as she heard this. \u201cDid nobody stand against his polygamous ways?\u201d\u201cWell, if you think that it\u2019s right and you\u2019re determined to do it, why do you care about what other people think?\u201d Lin Huang said and laughed at her response. \u201cOf course, Bei Feng was just a character in the story. No person like that exist in reality,\u201d he continued to reassure her.\u201cI\u2019ve thought it through\u2026\u201d Xue Luo said after falling into deep thought. Her eyes brightened.\u201cMister, what\u2019s your plan, after this?\u201d Xue Luo suddenly asked.\u201cI\u2019ll register as a hunter and will try my best to achieve iron-level. I\u2019ll be very busy with these tasks when I return. Plans for the future would be first and foremost, working towards the goal of being a transcendent,\u201d he said proudly. Lin Huang had no idea how long it would take for him to be a transcendent. However, it would be meaningless to talk about the future since he did not have a complete understanding of this world. He could only act when the time came. One could only go further if they progressed with certainty in mind.Both of them chatted for quite some time, sitting on the giant rock. However, Yi Zheng who was watching from below looked upset.\u201cI thought Lin Huang was an honest man but now, I don\u2019t think so. I feel worried, asking him to take care of my sister,\u201d he confessed to Yi Yeyu.\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d she shouted and pinched his arm hard.\u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth. Why did you pinch me? Miss Xue Luo is so beautiful and she\u2019s younger than you. She is so powerful, probably a transcendent human too. If you don\u2019t make some moves and work for him, perhaps Lin Huang will be snatched away from you,\u201d he said with a chuckle. Obviously, they did not realize Xue Luo and Bing Wang were not human. They thought they were transcendent beings.\u201cDamn!\u201d Yi Yeyu squealed. She freaked out at the thought of losing Lin Huang.On the giant rock, Lin Huang and Xue Luo were about to end their conversation.\u201cWe\u2019ll leave after getting our things done,\u201d Xue Luo said and stood up.\u201cIs there anything that you still have to do?\u201d Lin Huang stood up and asked out of curiosity.\u201cI have to erase the memory of me and Xiao Bing from the human brains we\u2019ve come in contact with. Also, I\u2019ll have to patch up the battleground,\u201d Xue Luo said, looking at Lin Huang. \u201cIn addition to that, the people witnessed the scenes of you killing hundreds of monsters. That has to be erased from their memory as well, for your safety. Others must not know about this,\u201d she warned him.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what you did to master the power of such curses. with this kind of strength, even a God of the human race would be keen on having such a gift,\u201d she said. At first, Lin Huang thought she was joking, but as Xue Luo said those words, she had a deadly serious look in her eyes.\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he replied.Lin Huang never expected a hidden power to exist in the Small Destruction Card that even a God was seeking for it.\u201cI\u2019ll begin to erase their memory and replace them up with new memories,\u201d she said. As soon as Xue Luo finished her sentence, it began to snow.At that moment, everyone in the foothold felt odd about the occurrence. Suddenly, the hunters and the residents started to faint one by one.Bing Wang left as well. After a short while, he came back, carrying a young man.\u201cI\u2019ve created a new memory for them. A transcendent human arrived at the battleground and had an intense battle with the black python. He saved everyone and the crowd of monsters retreated after the snake was killed,\u201d Xue Luo said to Bing Wang. She then continued with instructions him, saying, \u201cXiao Bing, you\u2019ve fought with this man before. You may fake evidence of a fight at this place based on his combat style. Regarding the traces of monsters, I will erase it with the snow,\u201d she said.It was now midsummer, but there was heavy snowfall. In the entire ravine, only Lin Huang, Xue Luo, and Bing Wang stood in silence.Very quickly, Bing Wang had finished fixing up the battleground. However, the snow did not stop and the whole world turned white. Under two full moons, the night sky was exceptionally beautiful.\u201cMister, we will be leaving now,\u201d Xue Luo said. She was less than two meters away from Lin Huang, standing on the giant rock. She tilted her head slightly and smiled at him.On such a snowy night, she stood barefoot on the giant rock like a snow fairy. She was very pretty.Lin Huang nodded. He waved his hand and said, \u201cBye, Xue Luo.\u201d\u201cBye, Mister,\u201d she replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXue Luo waved at Lin Huang. Then, Bing Wang and Xue Luo both rose up into the air.As both of them were hundreds of meters above the ground, Xue Luo waved her hands in the air and a Virtual Eye gradually formed in front of them.After a short while, the Virtual Eye was opened. There were icy white eyes inside the Virtual Eye, resembling a giant spiritual eye looking down from the sky.Xue Luo and Bing Wang stepped into the Virtual Eye and it closed gradually around them. Both of them completely disappeared.Until the moment when the Virtual Eye had also disappeared, Lin Huang slowly shifted his gaze away from the sight. He sighed and thought in his heart, \u201cBye, Xue Luo\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He never expected to see her as soon as he opened the door.She was wearing pink pajamas with pictures of cartoon puppies printed all over it.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you slept yet? It\u2019s getting late.\u201d Lin Huang asked with a stern face, pinching her cheeks.\u201cYou told me through the communication device that you\u2019re coming back late at night. I wanted to sleep and check if you\u2019re back when I\u2019m awake but I was too excited to sleep\u2026\u201d Lin Xin said as she hugged Lin Huang tightly, afraid that he would leave her again. \u201cDid you know that you scared me to death when I heard the news of the monster horde? I used the Emperor\u2019s Heart ring to call you but I couldn\u2019t reach you,\u201d she scolded, pouting as she did.\u201cThe signal might have been interrupted due to the monsters,\u201d Lin Huang shook his head and smiled. He switched the topic and asked, \u201cOh right, I got you a gift,\u201d he said. He then took out a video stone from the storage space and passed it to Lin Xin.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Lin Xin asked curiously.\u201cYi Zheng recorded it for me. There\u2019s his signature behind it,\u201d Lin Huang said as he turned over the video stone. Yi Zheng\u2019s name was written on it as well as a date.\u201cYi Zheng, the guy who is on the Gold Hunter Board?\u201d Lin Xin\u2019s eyes brightened as she heard his name.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d Lin Huang replied and nodded his head.Lin Xin immediately grabbed the video stone from Lin Huang and ran towards the stairs.\u201cSleep early after you\u2019ve finished watching it. You have school tomorrow!\u201d Lin Huang immediately shouted after her.\u201cYes, I know!\u201d she answered.\u201cThis girl\u2026\u201d he mumbled under his breath.Lin Huang shook his head and smiled. He knew the girls who were still studying in the Hunter Reserve College admired the young and good-looking guys who were listed on the boards. It was the same as girls who admired handsome actors and singers on Earth.Yi Zheng was a Gold Hunter in Division7 who ranked at the eleventh position on the board. He was handsome and very protective of his sister. Many girls admired him and he was even proclaimed as The Nation\u2019s Brother. This was why Lin Huang requested a signature and the video stone for Lin Xin.It had been one day since the incident of the monster attack at the Snowy Mountain Town. Due to the fact that Yi Yeyu\u2019s green wooden door was destroyed, Lin Huang took half a day to arrive at the No.7C87 foothold by means of an eagle. As soon as he arrived, it took him quite a long time to settle his registration the Hunter Association. After he was done with work, the sky was dark. Yi Yeyu and Yi Zheng then treated the young people to dinner.Yi Yeyu\u2019s memory regarding the damaged green wooden door had been altered. According to her, it turned out that the green wooden door was destroyed by the combat power of the two transcendents. It then left her body on its own into the air.After having dinner, Lin Huang did not stay any longer at the foothold and straight away headed back home on an eagle.After Lin Xin left, Lin Huang then took a shower and went back to his room.He could not fall asleep. He just stared at the ceiling as he lay in bed. It was as if he had something to do but just could not remember what it was.\u201cXiao Hei, please rearrange the card pieces I have and combine those that can be integrated,\u201d he instructed the card.\u201cYou have 3657 card pieces. They will now be rearranged and integrated,\u201d it replied.\u201cIntegration of card pieces is complete,\u201d it responded after a mere few seconds.\u201cYou obtained a Monster Card \u2013 Lion-Headed Troll (Normal) x3\u201d\u201cYou obtained a Monster Card \u2013 Ox Devil (Normal) x3\u201d\u201c600 card pieces deducted from your collection.

Do you want to perform Card Engulfs to get a skill upgrade?\u201d Xiao Hei inquired.\u201cEngulf them,\u201d he ordered.Lin Huang decided without hesitation. Skills could not be extracted repeatedly from duplicate cards and he could only summon one monster at a time due to his summoning authority. Therefore, it was not important to keep duplicate cards. He chose to carry out the Card Engulf process to get a skill upgrade. Therefore, skills that he extracted would be skills that had been previously upgraded.\u201cCard Engulf completed. Lion-Headed Troll obtained a skill upgrade. Ox Devil obtained a skill upgrade,\u201d Xiao Hei said.Lin Huang launched both cards.

You have gained two new skills, \u201cMagic Eye Deterrence (Intermediate)\u201d and \u201cChampion Strength (Intermediate),\u201d Xiao Hei replied.\u201cYou have one more Monster Card (Sand Monster) to be engulfed. Would you like to carry out a Card Engulf sequence?\u201d Xiao Hei continued.\u201cEngulf it,\u201d Lin Huang said and nodded his head. He only kept the Sand Monster in the first place as he needed him to watch the night. Since he had other Monster Cards now, it would be useless to keep a monster of the same type as Tyrant.\u201cCard Engulf is completed. Sand Monster (Tyrant) obtained a skill upgrade,\u201d Xiao Hei said.Lin Huang looked at the message describing the Sand Monster. Immense Strength had been upgraded from a beginner level to an intermediate level.After the integration of cards and the card engulfment processes, he launched his Exclusive Card to check on his personal status.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Great Sword Scriptures (Sword skill)\u201cSkill 3: Robust (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cSkill 4: Spectral Snowsteps\uff08Body Movement Skill\uff09\u201d\u201cSkill 5: Magic Eye Deterrence (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cSkill 6: Immense Strength (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cSummon authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1\u201d\u201cRemark: No matter how many skills you have, it could not change the fact that you\u2019re weak.\u201dHe ignored Xiao Hei\u2019s last remark and looked at the two additional skills.\u201cMagic Eye Deterrence (Intermediate): The pupil of its eye exudes a threatening vibe. It has a probability of 80% that it would deter the target when exchanging gazes with each other, causing the target to go into a trance. (Such an effect would be rendered useless if it were applied to creatures that were two levels above or are stronger than the user.\u201d\u201cImmense Strength (Beginner): Passive skill. Strength gain increased four times.\u201dThese two skills were the new skills extracted from the Lion-Headed Troll Card and Ox Devil Card.On the other hand, Lin Huang discovered that his passive skill \u2018Robust\u2019 had been upgraded to an intermediate level. He asked, \u201cXiao Hei, could getting a skill upgrade for the Monster Card lead to an upgrade of personal skills?\u201d\u201cYes, once the Monster Card is upgraded, the host\u2019s skill extracted from the Monster Card will be upgraded as well. If the Monster Card disappears, the extracted skills would disappear as well.\u201d\u201cThe Monster Card would disappear?!\u201d Lin Huang was stunned.\u201cYes, if the monster died, the Monster Card would disappear and the skills extracted from the Monster Card will be removed,\u201d Xiao Hei explained.This was not what Lin Huang expected. He thought that it was just a card game. If the summoned monster died in a battle, it would be recalled back to its card and he would be unable to summon it for a short period of time. He had never thought that the Monster Card and the extracted skill would disappear if the monster died. He realized that he was not playing a card game and he was in the real world instead. Just like what happened on Earth, you would be forgotten as soon as you were dead\u2026\u201cCheck the remaining Function Cards,\u201d Lin Huang inquired of Xiao Hei, as he remembered the other the nine cards he was rewarded for the rank-crossing kill. He had been rewarded a Flawless Card upon the completion of his mission to become a Reserve Hunter.\u201cYou have Advance Card x1, Double Card x3, Provisional Transformation Card x3, Mission Card x1, Treasure Card x1, Flawless Card x1.\u201dLin Huang ignored the Mission Card and launched the two unfamiliar cards.\u201cTreasure Card: After using this card, it would lead the user to the nearest location of a piece of treasure. It includes mineral ores, burial grounds, virtual caves and more. It is only valid for one month after activation of the card.\u201d\u201cFlawless Card: Using this card could replenish his body for once. All of the hidden problems in his body could be healed, including Life Columns, Life Wheel, and blood vessels. \u201d\u201cThere is a time limit for the Treasure Card. I\u2019m quite busy now so I should just put it on hold first. The Flawless Card is a very useful card. My Life Wheel has been repaired and there shouldn\u2019t be any problems with my body. However, there\u2019s something wrong with Bai\u2019s blood vessels. He is easily affected by the septic divisor. If Bai used it, he would not be easily affected by the septic divisor anymore,\u201d Lin Huang thought and summoned Bai.Bai sat quietly at the edge of the bed, looking at Lin Huang. Lin Huang got up and took out the Flawless Card. He crushed the card and a layer of golden pieces surrounded his fingertips. He tapped his finger in between Bai\u2019s eyebrows.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBai\u2019s body was then shrouded in a golden aura as if he was being wrapped in a golden cocoon.After a while, the glow faded. Bai\u2019s wings extended automatically, turning a copper color. Lin Huang checked the messages, and it showed no changes. However, he knew that Bai\u2019s Blood Power could have healed. Otherwise, the color of the Blood-powered Wings would not have changed.\u201cWe should try it with septic divisor when we are free,\u201d Lin Huang said to Bai.Lin Huang then recalled Bai and he jumped back in bed.He started to feel sleepy after a short while and could finally satisfy the tiredness and fatigue he felt. He fell asleep almost immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was afraid to wake him up, so she silently crept back to her room, and got ready. She did not even eat breakfast, afraid that any noise in the kitchen might wake him. She tiptoed quietly and after washing up, she left for school.It was 12 o\u2019clock in the afternoon when Lin Huang finally woke up. He stretched his arms, feeling that the tiredness from the night before all gone. He jumped out of bed to start the day.After changing his clothes and washing up, he rushed to the kitchen on the first floor.There was sufficient food and drinks in the refrigerator for him to have a hearty meal. Obviously, Lin Xin had bought them not long ago.Lin Huang felt odd when he saw the refrigerator in this world as it did not use electricity as a source of power but it used a frozen spinel instead. Also, it used a special type of skeleton-like material as a substitute for the insulating material. Its appearance looked like a single cabinet fridge on Earth.He took out two eggs from the fridge and leftovers from the day before. He then cooked some fried rice with eggs for himself.There were many types of homebred birds in this world, more than on Earth. Considering only those that were sold and available in the markets, there were more than 20 types. If wild monsters were considered, there were around 280 types of birds that were included in human recipes.After finishing the plate of fried rice, Lin Huang washed the pots and went back to his room. He started to carefully read messages that were with regards to Life Seeds.As a Reserve Hunter, Lin Huang was provided with only level-1 authority by the Hunter Association. Regarding the information of the Life Seed, he merely had access to the most basic version. Yi Zheng as a Gold Hunter, and he was granted Level-4 authority. Therefore, Lin Huang asked for a copy of the information on Life Seeds.He recommended several Life Seed notes to Lin Huang as he knew that he was looking for one more suited for himself. Regarding his recommendation, Lin Huang looked at it on the spot. He was not satisfied with it so he decided to look through the information and choose the right one.He opened the \u201cLife Seed Book\u201d that Yi Zheng sent to him and filtered the qualities for selection again.\u201cStrengthening System, Sword, Iron-level.\u201dIn just a short while, the results, after applying the filters, were shown. There were only around 10 remaining Life SeedsA sword type Life Seed was quite ordinary.Lin Huang went through the information listed one by one.\u201cName of Life Seed: Sword Swiftness Mastery\u201d\u201cTalent effects: Beginner level, 20% increment in attack speed. There would be 20% attack speed increment for every upgrade in level. On the third upgrade, there will be an 80% increment in attack speed.\u201d\u201cMethod to Obtain: It can be obtained by killing a Rapid Sword Mantis.\u201d\u2026\u201cName of Life Seed: Sword Power Mastery\u201d\u201cTalent effects: Beginner level, 50% increment in strength. There would be 50% attack power increment for every level upgrade. On the third upgrade, there will be a 200% increment in attack power.\u201d\u201cMethod to Obtain: It can be obtained by killing a Powerful Combat Puppet.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cName of Life Seed: Sword Skill Mastery\u201d\u201cTalent effects: Beginner level, 5% increment in sword skills. There will be a 5% increase in sword skill for every level upgrade. On the third upgrade, there will be a 20% increment in sword skills.\u201d\u201cMethod to Obtain: It can be obtained by killing a Single Armed Sword Slave.\u201d\u2026\u2026Lin Huang continued reading as he walked around. Soon, he finished reading about all of the 13 types of Life Seeds.Aside from than Sword Skill Mastery, he was not at all satisfied with the rest of them. However, he was actually not that pleased with the Sword Skill Mastery too since it did not have any significant improvement on his personal combat skills. Besides, after three upgrades to achieve gold-rank, the sword mastery skills would have merely increased by 20%. It was still far behind the effects of specialty medicines.\u201cThere does not seem to be any satisfying sword type Life Seeds on iron-level\u2026\u201d Lin Huang thought to himself and frowned. He initially thought that since he had obtained a sword skill of an Epic level, which was \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture,\u201d if he chose another sword type Life Seed, he could train his sword mastery to perfection. His enemies would barely be a threat him when they had almost similar combat capabilities.However, the fact was there was not a single iron-level Life Seed that fulfilled his requirements.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the Compound Life Seed. If there were no suitable Life Seeds, then I had to choose one of the Firearm Life Seeds.\u201d Lin Huang mumbled in a low voice and changed his filtering criteria on the \u201cLife Seed Book\u201d.\u201cCompound Life Seeds, Iron-level.\u201dSoon, the results were shown once again. However, the results available were even fewer than the previous one. There were only two types of Life Seeds.Although, Lin Huang was not surprised. The Compound Life Seeds and Special Life Seeds usually had the least amount of Life Seeds. Since there were two results available, he took a closer look at the two types.\u201cName of Life Seed: Flower Fairy\u201d\u201cTalent effects: Beginner level, 10% increment in self-healing ability, healing effects increased by 10%, monster affinity increased by 10%. There would be 10% increase in the three abilities for every upgrade in level. On the third upgrade, there will be a 40% increase in all three abilities.\u201d\u201cMethod to Obtain: It can be obtained by killing White Fairy Vine.\u201dLin Huang ignored the Life Seed as soon as he finished reading the description because the abilities were useless and a White Fairy Vine was an extraordinary plant. It was rare and no one knew if it existed in this world, which would make his task rather tedious.Lin Huang looked at the second result.\u201cName of Life Seed: Sly Hands\u201d\u201cTalent effects: Beginner level, 10% increment in finger agility. Attack speed of both arms increased by 10%, the flexibility of both arms increased by 10%. There would be 10% increase of the three abilities for every upgrade in level. On the third upgrade, there will be a 40% increment in all three abilities.\u201d\u201cMethod to Obtain: It can be obtained by killing Six Armed Demon.\u201dLin Huang was intrigued by the Sly Hand. Despite not directly increasing his combat prowess, this could be effective in assisting him in using swords and firearms.He was not worried, though. He jotted down notes on a few of the Life Seed descriptions and started to check if there were any better Life Seed of for firearms.It took him a few minutes to skim through the Firearm Life Seeds and soon, he had made up his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the Sly Hand Life Seed. There was no other Life Seed of an iron-level that is more appropriate than this. Now I should have a look at what the Six-Armed Demon is and where I can find this monster,\u201d he thought to himself.Lin Huang checked the Heart Network page to find information on the Six-Armed Demon.\u201cName of Monster: Six-Armed Demon\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Undead\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Iron-level rank-3\u201d\u201cCommon skill: Heart Seizure, Spirit Catcher\u201d\u201cDistrict distribution: Wangyou Forest, Demon Burial Ground\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cRemark: This is one of the most dangerous iron-level monsters. Not recommended to be chosen as Life Seed prey.\u201dLin Huang found the image of the monster after reading the description about it.It was a creature in a red dress, floating in the sky. She had no legs and only six weird-looking arms. Each of her arms was around two meters long with two joints. She had a terribly pale grimaced mask on her face that seemed to also have been doodled on intentionally. Her face was then framed with long, black hair that fell down to her waist. There was no sense of beauty to her at all, only savagery.She was a ferocious ghost with six long arms.Lin Huang was speechless at the sight. \u201cIf this monster happened to exist on Earth, I\u2019ve no idea how many people would have been frightened to death\u2026\u201d He said aloud, the thought running a chill down his spine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He watched the videos repeatedly and he felt a mixture of thrill and terror.One of the videos that Lin Huang remembered clearly was a team of five Reserve Hunters accidentally bumping into a Six-Armed Demon in the Wangyou Forest.As soon as the Six-Armed Demon discovered the team of Reserve Hunter, she immediately attacked. In less than a minute, all five of them were slaughtered.\u201cShe moves like a ghost and she was incredibly fast. Each of her arms was a dreadful killing machine\u2026\u201d the commentary played as he watched. Lin Huang immediately frowned as he saw the action. He had to admit that the Six-Armed Demon was a powerful monster.After he finished gathering all the data about the Six-Armed Demon, Lin Huang did some research about the two districts \u2013 Wangyou Forest and the Demon Burial Ground.In this world, people who went into places that were named burial grounds would normally be dead, but here he was planning his hunt, alive and kicking.Similarly, the Demon Burial Ground was a place worse than that. All these years, none of the non-transcendent humans who entered this place ever survived.He briefly looked through the information on the Demon Burial Ground and immediately excluded it from his schedule. He did not want to go into such a creepy place as he planned to have a fighting chance at a longer life.As he closed the information page on the Demon Burial Ground, Lin Huang then checked the information on the Wangyou Forest.Wangyou Forest was a very spacious level-4 wilderness. It was said that the transcendent monster had appeared in this place before but it was killed. The strongest monster in the forest was a gold-level monster. There was more than one gold-level monster in the forest while silver-level monsters were scattered everywhere in the forest.\u201cThe level-4 wilderness is a bit troublesome\u2026\u201d Lin Huang frowned again as he finished reading the information regarding the Wangyou Forest.To Lin Huang, the level-4 wilderness was a place with an extremely high death rate. With his abilities, it would be stressful for him even in a level-2 wilderness. Bronze-level monsters were a lot stronger than iron-level monsters. Although Lin Huang could easily kill iron-level rank-3 monsters, it was still unknown to him if he could defeat bronze-level monsters, let alone defeat silver-level and gold-level monsters.\u201cThis wilderness is too far from me. It\u2019s within the jurisdiction of another medium sized foothold, around 20,000 kilometers away from me. To reach that place is a problem as well\u2026\u201d It was the first time Lin Huang realized that the world was so big and it was beyond what one could imagine. Between each of the medium-sized footholds, the distance that separated them was at least 3,000 kilometers. Some of them were even 5,000 kilometers apart. For the larger footholds, they were at least 20,000 kilometers apart given that the length of Earth\u2019s equator was only 40,000 kilometers.There were no teleportation facilities in the small-sized footholds. For the medium-sized footholds, the distance one could teleport between two portals was limited. Basically, one could only travel to nearby medium-sized footholds. If Lin Huang were to go to the Wangyou Forest, he would have to experience a portal change six times over. The opening of a portal cost a lot. Also, the number of times for the portal can open as well as the number of people that could be transported was restricted as well. When the foothold was crowded and no prior bookings were made, he might have to wait for more than three days.It was possible to travel there by riding an eagle. However, its ability to sustain prolonged flight was questionable and its physical strength was limited. He would have to transfer at each station at the medium-sized footholds and take a rest at the hotels since he would be spending a lot of time on the road.Another method was to ride on the Demonic Crystal Spaceship. There were suites in the spaceship and its traveling speed was almost the same as the eagle. However, it was more comfortable and it stayed for only five minutes between each medium-sized footholds. One of the weaknesses of this spaceship was that the tickets for the spaceships were very expensive. It had limited cabin seats and only one spaceship would carry passengers each week. The ticket prices were very expensive but the supply was often falling short of demand.Inconvenience had caused Lin Huang to feel like summoning a monster that could fly. Of course, he had thought of making Dimensional Relics like the green wooden door, but apparently, it would be more difficult.After comparing a few methods, Lin Huang decided to take a ride on the Demonic Crystal Spaceship. He had never seen it before and wondered how the Demonic Crystal Spaceship looked like in this world.Lin Huang was lucky as he successfully booked a ticket via the Heart Network. The spaceship would depart from foothold No.7C87 and three days later, arrive at foothold No.7C82. The distance of the journey was around 20,000 kilometers, so the ticket cost him 20,000 credit points.After booking the spaceship ticket, it was already four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Lin Huang headed to the Stable Residence before dinner. He visited the boss of the hotel and the guest of the hotel who taught him the sword skill he treasuredHe then noticed that the boss of the hotel was not the same person and the guest was not an ordinary hunter as well.It took him 10 minutes to arrive at the Stable Residence. The yard was no longer the same. The small garden had become an outdoor restaurant with some tables and chairs there.There were a few young customers enjoying their drinks, sitting on the chairs in front of the small tables.A waitress came to Lin Huang and asked as he stopped in front of the door, \u201cMister, can I help you?\u201d\u201cIs this place owned by a new boss?\u201d Lin Huang asked as he felt that it was impossible for Boss Yu to make so many changes to his beloved garden.\u201cYes, it has been 10 days now. However, these days frequent guests like you have come and they complimented our dishes and drinks, saying they\u2019re better than before. You could give it a try and I believe you\u2019ll be satisfied with it.\u201d The waitress recommended a few new menu specialties as she knew that Lin Huang was a frequent guest of the hotel under its previous management.\u201cThank you. I\u2019m actually looking for Boss Yu. It\u2019s an urgent matter\u2026\u201d Lin Huang asked as he waved his hand at the waitress. When he was about to leave, he thought of Scarface too. He then asked, \u201cExcuse me. There was a tall man with a scar on his face who lived here last time. May I know if he is still here?\u201d he asked the waitress again.\u201cScarface? No, I have never met such a person before. I\u2019ll remember if there\u2019s a person like that,\u201d the waitress said and shook her head.\u201cAlright, thank you,\u201d Lin Huang nodded, turned away and left. He never thought that Boss Yu and Scarface would leave the foothold so suddenly. Looking at the Stable Residence, he felt a sense of disappointment.When he got home, he read some news. Nothing special had happened. He was getting ready for dinner.Dinner had been prepared and Lin Xin was back from school.Both of them sat face to face while they ate. Lin Huang then asked Lin Xin about the Stable Residence.\u201cXin Er, when did the new boss take over at the Stable Residence?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe second day after you left. Boss Yu and the fierce uncle left as well,\u201d Lin Xin replied. She knew it as she was at the foothold all the time.\u201cIt was such a big hotel. Why did the boss sell it out in a short period of time? It was still fine when we stayed there,\u201d Lin Huang asked, as he felt the transition was very strange.\u201cIt was said that he had some family issues and needed money urgently. He sold his hotel at a very cheap price and rushed back to his hometown. The fierce uncle was hired as his bodyguard and they left together,\u201d Lin Xin told him the rumors she had heard.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Huang felt that it was unusual. Now as he recalled, Boss Yu and Scarface must have known each other before that time they were there. Perhaps he intentionally asked Lin Huang to pay attention to the sword skills Scarface practiced in the garden. Both of them had disappeared and it would be difficult to further investigate the issue now.\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m not going to think about it any further. Life has been so hectic recently,\u201d he said with a sigh. He shook his head and emptied his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even spent 100,000 credit points to expand the capacity of his storage space into 100 cubic meters.After riding on the Demonic Crystal Spaceship, he arrived at foothold No.7C87 within a few hours. He looked for a hotel and stayed there.Foothold No.7C87 was the top-tier foothold in the No.7D101 Wulin Town region which was the town Lin Huang was in. The locals called it Baqi City as the term sounded almost like the number 87. This was not its original name, though. People had forgotten its original name as they were so used to calling it Baqi City.Baqi City was a regular C-grade foothold. A medium-sized foothold was a lot bigger than the average small sized foothold.In comparison, the area of a small-sized foothold was almost the same as the area of a town on Earth. On the other hand, a medium-sized foothold would be the area of three cities on Earth, having a population greater than one million people.Baqi City was livelier than Wulin Town and Snowy Mountain Town.In Wulin Town, it seemed that there were no activities held at night. It was slightly livelier at the Snowy Mountain Town as more visitors visited that place but compared to Baqi City, Snowy Mountain Town was still far from it.Lin Huang felt that he had returned to modern civilization when he arrived at Baqi City.There were skyscrapers and even buildings with special architectural designs.Lin Huang\u2019s hotel was one of the skyscrapers. The hotel had a total of 39 floors and Lin Huang\u2019s room was on the 21st.He wondered how the people would get to the top floor as he entered the hotel since he had never seen a lift in this world. He realized that he had been worrying for nothing as there was a floating staircase in the hotel that somehow looked like a lift. Lin Huang had no idea about the theories and mechanism behind the operation of the floating staircase. He felt curious but he did not ask about it.After checking in, he went to his room. Lin Huang sent Lin Xin a message to tell her that he was safe. He continued watching the battle videos of the Six-Armed Demon that Yi Zheng had sent him.When he told Yi Zheng that he had chosen the Six-Armed Demon as his Life Seed prey, Yi Zheng advised him to change it but he insisted on his choice.Since the Six-Armed Demon was a very dangerous monster, Lin Huang dared not take it too lightly. The past few days, Lin Huang had been watching the videos repeatedly as he was trying to observe and learn her attack moves, figuring out the patterns of her attack. However, he was not making any progress.In laymen terms, the attacks of the Six-Armed Demon could be described as being creepy, fast, and cruel.She did not seem to have any specific skill. Her attacks were irregular and every hit would cause instant death to her enemies. Lin Huang had a headache when he noticed this, and could not figure a way past her attacks.Under normal circumstances, he concluded that the best way to defeat it in combat was to attack from afar.Unfortunately, Lin Huang could not use his weapon as the effect of his GrayEagle17 on the Six-Armed Demon was very limited. She did not seem to have any weak spots. Even bombs would hardly have any effect on her. Therefore, Lin Huang would be forced to perform a close combat maneuver.A human who killed a monster would carry out Life Light Baptisms, obtain Life Seeds and get upgrades. The entire process was restricted by two conditions.First of all, the monster must be killed by the Life Light Baptist. It would not work if it was killed by the others.Secondly, the Baptist can bring along his companion. However, the combat level of the human companion must be lower than the level of the monster. Otherwise, the Life Light would be spread out of the monster\u2019s dead body and Life Seed would collapse.Lin Huang began to feel worried about the second condition. If he had to complete the hunting process all by himself and he was not allowed to summon any monsters for help, the rate of success would be close to zero. He might even be killed by the Six-Armed Demon. However, he felt slightly relieved as he watched some of the videos in which an Imperial Censor had completed the baptism.The monsters summoned by the Imperial Censor were not human. Their combat levels would not cause the Life Light and Life Species to spread out. Therefore, Lin Huang could summon Bai or his Sand Monster to assist him in the battle.Since he was being restricted by the first condition, the killer must be Lin Huang himself. The summoned monsters could not kill the Six-Armed Demon. Otherwise, Lin Huang would be unable to perform the Life Light Baptism.\u201cI\u2019ve watched these videos so many times and there weren\u2019t any flaws in her defenses. Perhaps I could only let Bai lock her up with his Blood Power and I\u2019ll kill her,\u201d Lin Huang thought. He could only hope such an idiotic way would allow him to kill her.He closed the page that showed the information and got ready to go out for dinner. He wanted to walk around the foothold and relax as he felt a tenseness build up inside him.Opening up the page of contact, the first person who called him was the fatty, Yin Hangyi.Lin Huang frowned and answered the call.\u201cLin Huang, you\u2019re still alive!\u201d The fatty\u2019s oily face appeared on the projected screen.\u201cI should say the same about you. I asked you to wait for me there but when I went back, you had disappeared,\u201d Lin Huang said.\u201cI wanted to help you. You don\u2019t appreciate me!\u201d The fatty laughed a little and said. \u201cIf the witch did not tell me you were still alive, I\u2019ll not know it even until now. She told me that you\u2019ve asked for my contact number from her. Why didn\u2019t you contact me?\u201d\u201cThere are two reasons. The first one is because I\u2019m busy and another reason is that I\u2019ve forgotten about it\u2026\u201d What Lin Huang said was indeed the fact. He wanted to contact the fatty after he had completed the assessment. However, he had forgotten about it when he encountered the massive monster in the crowd incident.\u201cThat was bitterly disappointing. I miss you every day and even raised a memorial in your honor. I burned incense to you whenever I missed you\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201d Lin Huang interrupted the fatty before he finished his sentence.\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s talk about something else,\u201d Fatty said as he suddenly remembered that he had something serious to tell him. \u201cErr\u2026 I heard from the witch that you\u2019ve chosen the Six-Armed Demon as your Life Seed prey. Are you going to Wangyou Forest in the two days?\u201d\u201cYes, I am. Why?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cAre you sure that you want to hunt the Six-Armed Demon? It is a top-tier iron-level monster. Even Copper Hunters would not provoke the monster,\u201d he answered. Apparently, the fatty had heard of the monster before.\u201cI knew that. I\u2019ve watched her battle videos so many times. It\u2019s indeed difficult to handle but I\u2019ve got my ways,\u201d he replied. Lin Huang had fixed his battle strategy and was confident he had a chance.\u201cOh. Since you think so, that fine. It\u2019s alright now.\u201d\u201cFatty, you\u2019re acting strangely. What\u2019s happening?\u201d Lin Huang immediately asked.\u201cThe witch asked me to advise you not to go. Since you\u2019re confident that you can do it, then it\u2019s alright,\u201d The fatty told him the truth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShe has my contact number. Why didn\u2019t she call me?\u201d Lin Huang felt weird.\u201cShe told me that her brother had advised you but you didn\u2019t listen to him. She guessed that she\u2019ll not be able to influence you as well and she asked me to convince you,\u201d The fatty said. He then asked, \u201cBoth of you are moving so fast in your relationship. Have you met each other\u2019s parents?\u201d\u201cStop bullshitting me. I\u2019m going to hang up now.\u201d\u201cWait, don\u2019t hang up! Tell me who her brother is\u2026\u201d the fatty asked amid laughter.Lin Huang did not want to continue with a topic like that and hung up the phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang rushed over to the Baqi\u2019s City central plaza.He bought some snacks and drinks at a dessert shop nearby and sat in the shade under an umbrella while eating his breakfast.The pre-booked Demonic Crystal Spaceship would appear at the central plaza at nine o\u2019clock sharp. It would stay there for five minutes for passengers to get on board and off the ship. He would not be able to board if he was late and he would have to wait another week for the next spaceship. Lin Huang did not wish to have any delays. Therefore, he arrived early at the central plaza.It was only 8.30 a.m. after he finished his breakfast. He logged on to the network page and checked for any updates on the news.Looking at the Heart Network, there was a headline that reported a massive monster crowd that appeared in Alps Town. The Transcendent Yu Chanli was being bombarded with questions at an interviewed with a journalist because of the incident. However, there were media representatives that shifted their focus to the weakest group \u2013 Zhou Le and Yu Guang.They were the same as Lin Huang. They had just registered for the Reserve Hunter assessment and then joined the team to defend the town against the monster crowd. They were truly a weak team of people.During the interview, the young people looked overwhelmed. Reporters inquired about the monster crowd and the team discussed Lin Huang unconsciously. Especially Zhou Le, he admired Lin Huang a lot and told the reporter not to forget to interview Lin Huang.Other than the name \u2018Lin Huang\u2019 being mentioned, another issue had been revealed by Yu Guang. Bai Yan who was the strongest man in the Reserve Hunter Assessment did not stay to fight against the monster crowd. It was being reported that he insulted them instead, saying that those who stayed to fight were a group of idiots.Soon, the media was reporting about this too. They found a video extracted from a video surveillance system in the Alps Town\u2019s hotel\u2019s meeting room and uploaded the video to the network.In the video, despite Bai Yan\u2019s voice being rather soft, his voice was eventually amplified after some modifications. His expression of contempt in addition to his amplified voice had attracted a lot of attention.All of a sudden, the network was full of comments criticizing Bai Yan.\u201cHe\u2019s such an irresponsible person!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine if he did not help but he\u2019s being too sarcastic!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s truly an idiot!\u201d\u2026Some of them even scolded Bai Yan\u2019s family.They did research on Bai Yan\u2019s background. Even Lin Huang was astonished as he saw the information they had found.Bai Yan was of an Imperial Censor family and he was the eldest son of the 16th generation, possessing astonishing Imperial Censor talent.Bai\u2019s family was also a royal family. Their family members had terrifying capabilities in which they had a transcendent and were guarded by summoned transcendent monsters.\u201cNo wonder the guy behaved so arrogantly,\u201d Lin Huang thought and understood the reason why he looked down on the others.After browsing through the network for awhile, it was almost nine o\u2019clock. The giant Demonic Crystal Spaceship descended gradually, landing slowly onto the ground.Lin Huang stood up and looked at it while he was headed towards the boarding area.The big ship had luxurious designs which looked similar to a luxury cruise on Earth. However, the size of the ship was much bigger and had very colorful designs.It was a big ship with 11 floors. Many people were standing on the balcony and looking around. Also, some of them were looking down from the ship as they leaned against the deck beside of the ship. A few of them were standing on the 11th floor and looking down.There were not many people boarding at Baqi City. There were only 10 of them, including Lin Huang and there were around eight people getting off the ship.Lin Huang adjusted the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring for the projection of the ticket. It was being scanned at the boarding place and the door automatically opened. Lin Huang felt that it was similar to taking the train on Earth.After entering the ship, he looked for his room according to the room number that was shown on the ticket. The code of his ticket was 080298. That indicated that his room was on the 8th floor and room No.298.With the floating staircase, he went up to the 8th floor and found his room.He scanned his ticket before entering the room and pushed against the door. The condition of the room was better than what Lin Huang had expected. It was almost the same as an Earth\u2019s hotel deluxe suite. It had a big living room, a fully equipped kitchen, sparkling toilets, and a very comfortable bedroom.\u201cNo wonder the price of the ticket was so expensive. The room is very satisfying. Aside from some pocket money, all other expenses are included,\u201d Lin Huang thought. He was content with the service provided in this world. He was satisfied with most of the services provided to him so far. Besides, they hired top-quality employees who were always warm and friendly.He walked around the room and familiarized himself with his surroundings. He could see from the balcony that the spaceship had taken off.Standing on the balcony, Lin Huang felt it was very different from being on an airplane.The Demonic Crystal Spaceship was very stable. It left the ground and gradually flew towards the sky. A large air bubble formed around the spaceship and it was shrouded in like a forcefield.Inside the air bubble, Lin Huang could vaguely feel slightly weighted down when the spaceship ascended. However, the feeling lasted for less than one minute and disappeared completely. Subsequently, the spaceship accelerated. However, Lin Huang did not feel anything odd during the whole process and there was no difference between that and standing on the ground.He would not have known the spaceship had taken off if he did not see the objects moving below him.After a short while, Lin Huang went to his bedroom.He sat on the edge of the bed, preparing to read the detailed information of Bai Yan\u2019s family. Suddenly, he received a message. He opened the message and realized it was an official advertisement given by the Demonic Crystal Spaceship.A pretty lady in red dress popped up on the screen. In the video, she talked about the contents of the advertisement with a smile.\u201cDear valued customers, you may click on the special service button on our spaceship\u2019s main web page if you need special services,\u201d she said sweetly.\u201cYou may choose a man or woman from ages 16 to 360 years old.

He knew that sex services were opened to the public in this world and it was legal as long as the juveniles were not involved. However, he did not expect to watch that kind of advertisement on the spaceship, even consisting of contents about the non-humans\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, the room was soundproofed and Lin Huang was not disturbed.He led a life of order. He took his lunch when it was time for meals, and planned his day accordingly. After having his lunch, he walked around the deck.The first floor of the spaceship was for entertainment. There were restaurants, bars, a cinema, a casino and a swimming pool. Basic entertainment facilities were provided too.Lin Huang took a look at these facilities and left as he was not interested in any of them at the time.The 11th floor of the spaceship was reserved for VIPs. The rooms on this floor were never opened for bookings as they were used to serve the royal families. A special induction lock was installed at the entrance of the 11th floor. People like Lin Huang who had bought a normal flight ticket were not given access to the 11th floor.Therefore, Lin Huang and the rest of the passengers had no idea how the 11th floor looked like. It had been said that there were only 100 rooms on the 11th floor and the floor space of each of the rooms was many times bigger than a normal room. The remaining space was used to build high-end entertainment facilities. However, no one knew exactly what they had up there.In addition to all that, there was also an open-air balcony on the 11th floor. Similarly, it was only opened to the guests who stayed there. Lin Huang could see that there were people walking around on the 11th-floor balcony deck. However, it did not seem like a special event and it was less crowded than any other deck.After dinner, Lin Huang went to the bar.He was not a lively person. He seldom went to bars when he was on Earth and if he did, he would only go when he was persuaded by his friends and classmates. It was the first time for him in a bar in this world as he wanted to experience something new.The environment was good and they played relaxing music. He felt relaxed while listening to the music. However, he was utterly unfamiliar with the name of the drinks as he saw them in front of the bar counter.\u201cWhat the hell is an Old Hunter Raising Gun? What about the Fragrant Tongue of the Gorgeous? There was even this Very Stiff\u2026 Why can\u2019t there be some normal names for the drinks?!\u201d Lin Huang was speechless. He took a glance at it and all of the names consisted of words that made people have distorted thoughts.There was an old man standing behind the bar counter. He was shorter than Lin Huang and looked lascivious with his small eyes.\u201cYoung man, what would you like to order?\u201d he asked. It was still early and there were not many customers in the bar. The old man was wiping a wine goblet while he asked.\u201cAre there any lighter bodied drinks?\u201d Lin Huang hesitated and asked. He wanted to leave as he saw the names of the drinks. However, it would be rude for him to leave now since the old man had asked him for his order.\u201cLighter bodied drinks?\u201d The old man frowned, seemingly not satisfied with Lin Huang\u2019s question. \u201cYes, we have greenleaf juice here.\u201dGreenleaf juice was a very common drink that could be found in almost every bar and restaurant. It was somehow similar to the beers the people used to drink on Earth. The alcohol content of greenleaf juice was almost the same as beers but it tasted a lot better. There was a fragrance of malt with a softly perceptible sweetness. If it were to sell on Earth, perhaps beer factories would close down soon after.\u201cAlright. Then I would like to order a glass of greenleaf juice,\u201d he said. Lin Huang was afraid that if he were drunk, he would be delayed when he was disembarking the ship. Looking at the names of the drinks, he was worried that the uncle\u2019s drinks had some strong effects.Soon, the glass of greenleaf juice was served. Lin Huang took a sip and it tasted almost the same as the others. He was then assured and downed the glass of juice immediately.Perhaps it was because Lin Huang only ordered a glass of greenleaf juice, the old man did not bother to serve him after that. He was still wiping the wine cups and did not speak to Lin Huang. Oddly enough though, Lin Huang was happy with that.In the bar, there were two muscular men chatting and drinking at a seat not far away from him.Lin Huang unintentionally overheard their conversation. It was about the 11th floor of the spaceship. They were discussing a beautiful lady who stayed on the 11th floor.From their conversation, Lin Huang knew that there were five members of a royal family on board.The name of the beautiful lady was Leng Yuexin and she was the only child of the Leng\u2019s royal family. She was only 18 years old but ranked 13th on the Division7 Gold Hunter Board.Lin Huang was surprised too as he heard of her achievement. Yi Yeyu was 19 years old but she ranked 997th on the board. Although Yi Zheng was ranked 11th on the board, he was already 21 years old.Besides Leng Yuexin, there were four other royal members. They were all young man and one of them ranked fifth on the Division7 Gold Hunter Board. His name was Li Yanxing.Lin Huang had heard of his name despite him not paying much attention to the Gold Hunter Board. This was mainly because of he was a high-profile person.He was a legend. It was being said that he was orphaned as a child. Without any resources, he worked hard for himself until he was adopted by the Li\u2019s royal family and given the name Li Yanxing. He worked hard until he achieved what he had now. However, he was already 27 years old.According to them, Lin Yanxing was chasing Leng Yuexin while he invited the other three royal members to accompany him.\u201cLi Yanxing sounded like a high-handed person\u2026\u201d Although Lin Huang did not have much knowledge of who Li Yanxing was, he somehow felt that it would not be easy for him to achieve what he had now. Of course, he had to be a hardworking person but not everything could be achieved with just hard work. It was still a mystery why the Li\u2019s royal family would put so much effort into educating an outsider since they had descendants of their own.However, Lin Huang did not bother to know more about it since it was about someone else and it had nothing to do with him.Lin Huang left when the two muscular men switched to discussing the special services provided.The sky was getting darker as he went back to his room.A sound of a siren was heard coming from the spaceship as he was about to practice his No Trail Snow-Stepping technique.In a short while, a loud and noisy sound was heard.\u201cThere\u2019s a flock of birds coming towards us! For the sake of safety, passengers please leave the deck and go back to your own rooms as soon as possible. Please make sure that the door and windows are closed and put your seatbelts on! It\u2019s normal if you feel the spaceship tremble when the birds attack. Don\u2019t worry as we\u2019ll settle this as soon as possible. I hereby apologize for the inconvenience caused,\u201d and the voice trailed off.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the announcement was made, Lin Huang quickly closed the doors. He put on his seatbelt and sat near a window. He was curious to how the spaceship would stand against the birds\u2019 attack.Soon, the birds were getting closer to the spaceship.Lin Huang could see clearly from the window that they were millions of Blast Sparrows. Under normal circumstances, most of the Blast Sparrows were bronze-level to silver-level. Apparently, the only Blast Sparrow with a gold crown on its head was a gold-level sparrow.Lin Huang could not see from his angle whether the spaceship had taken any countermeasures to defend against the sparrows.However, he could clearly see that the flock of sparrows was flying towards the spaceship. Soon, the spaceship was surrounded by them\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their head was black in color and only those that had upgraded to gold-level would have a gold crown appear on their head.However, even being upgraded to a gold-level, there would not be any changes in its shape. It would be difficult to distinguish them apart if one did not observe them carefully.After a moment, Lin Huang caught a glimpse of the gold-level Blast Sparrow. However, the gold-level sparrow hid amongst the crowd and disappeared from view very quickly.Blast Sparrows did not look fierce. Despite the fact that they had very sharp claws, they looked weak. Besides, although they had sharp beaks, their beaks were short.But, it would be a big mistake if one underestimated their combat strength based on their appearance.Despite having claws that looked rather weak, the Blast Sparrows had claws that were as strong as steel talons. They would have no difficulty at all hunting down prey weighing more than 300 kilograms.Their short beaks had terrifying attack power and their attack speed was far beyond that of a pile-driver machine. In just a few seconds, they could easily stab a hole through the skull of a monster like the Sand Monster and chomp down on its brain.Brains were the Blast Sparrow\u2019s favorite. If brains could not satisfy their hunger, only then will they tear the prey\u2019s body apart and start eating their fats and organs. In short, they loved eating foods that were sticky, soft and moist.Right this moment, it was very dangerous as the spaceship was surrounded by a flock of Blast Sparrows. This was because of the Blast Sparrow had a fearsome attack speed.Looking at the spaceship being completely surrounded by the flock of sparrows, Lin Huang began to feel worried. He did not want his brain to end up in their beaks.Before purchasing the flight ticket, he had checked up on the safety of the Demonic Crystal Spaceship and their safety index was as high as 99.8% with relatively low accident rates. However, coming up against such a flock with a hidden gold-level sparrow king, Lin Huang could not help but worry about it.They launched consecutive attacks after surrounding the spaceship.Some of them grabbed the layer of the air bubble in which the spaceship was surrounded in with their claws while the others used their beaks to attack.The spaceship began to shake when the attack was launched.Followed by the Blast Sparrow\u2019s attack, the layer of air bubble emitted beams of purple rays from its exterior. Many of the Blast Sparrows were blown away.Witnessing the scene through the window, Lin Huang was relieved. The air bubble was made of unknown materials as there was a power grid-like defensive shield in the layer of the air bubble. The Blast Sparrows were blown away or fell directly down to the ground as the electric current shocked them.The number of Blast Sparrows in the sky was greatly reduced by the countermeasures. However, they had not get rid of the crisis that then presented itself as the Gold Crowned Sparrow King appeared. It pecked the air bubble repeatedly and its attack speed was unbelievable. The continuous flow of electric current that struck its body had no effect, whatsoever. Its attack speed did not diminish.The protective layer was being attacked by the Gold Crowned Sparrow King violently, causing the trembling of the spaceship to get even stronger.The windows in Lin Huang\u2019s room would not stop shaking. Looking through the window, he could see the Gold Crowned Sparrow King\u2019s attack. He felt like the protective layer of the spaceship would be broken anytime. He could not stop thinking about the protective barrier popping and countless Blast Sparrows would come rushing through the windows, followed by a scene of Blast Sparrows feasting on their brains.\u201cI hope the brain feast does not happen here\u2026\u201d Lin Huang said with a shiver as he tried hard to forget about it.In the pilot\u2019s cockpit, an old man wanted to fight back as he saw the Gold Crowned Sparrow King attack the defensive shield. Before the old man could react to it, a figure appeared from the top of the spaceship and flew up into the sky. The old man immediately stopped, laughed and shook his head, \u201cThat young man nowadays is indeed an impetuous fellow.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a transcendent on the spaceship?!\u201dLin Hung was stunned as he saw the sudden appearance of the figure. He fixed his gaze and realized that it was a young man carrying a pair of golden wings on his back. \u201cIt\u2019s a flying gold-level weapon,\u201d he thought, awestruck by the sight.Flying weapons were extremely rare, so their prices were at least 10 times higher than weapons of the same level. The gold-level flying weapon was the most powerful weapon with the strongest maneuver capabilities and its price was almost the same as a relic. The user of such relics must, of course, have an equally strong background.Lin Huang felt that the young man who carried the golden wings looked familiar. Soon, he recalled that he was the man that he had heard about at the bar, Li Yanxing, the one who ranked 5th on the Gold Hunter Board.He had been the center of many public media headlines and Lin Huang had seen him appearing on the news many times before. Therefore, he recognized him instantly.Although Lin Yanxing was already 27 years old, he looked like he was only 20 years old. He was tall, handsome and charming as he flew with his big golden wings.Many of the married and single women on the spaceship showed their affections by screaming love confessions towards him when they saw him fly up in the sky.Lin Huang had to admit that he appeared more attractive to women with his abilities in addition to his body and looks.\u201cDamn, beast!\u201d Li Yanxing shouted. His body seemed to have transformed into a beam of golden electric current and struck the Gold Crowned Sparrow King.The moment when he penetrated through the air bubble, Lin Huang noticed that the token hanging around his waist brightened.Lin Huang guessed that it was a special token owned by royal families. If it was not, then it must have been given to him by the captain. Regardless of which reason it was, there must have been something special about the token as he could pass through the air bubble at will.Li Yanxing was holding a long black sword in his hand and attacked the Gold Crowned Sparrow King with a Slanted Slash.Despite the handle of the sword being black in color, it was apparent that it was not an iron-level sword. Instead, it was a genuine relic.Lin Huang opened his eyes wide as he saw Li Yanxing execute the attack. The Slanted Slash generated a beam of golden Life Power in the air, resembling a crescent moon slashing towards the Gold Crowned Sparrow King. With a mere hit, he cut through the Sparrow King\u2019s neck.In a moment, the head of the Gold Crowned Sparrow King and its neck were torn apart and a large amount of blood oozed out of the wound. As the corpse was falling towards the ground, Li Yanxing grabbed it midair and kept it in his storage space.He did not bother to look at the rest of the Blast Sparrows. The remaining Blast Sparrows started to flee as their leader was killed before their beady eyes and they knew that they had provoked a dangerous foe.Li Yanxing turned away, flying back towards the top of the spaceship.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang noticed that as he passed through the air bubble, the token around his waist brightened again. This assured him of the fact that he might be right.The flight returned to normal as soon as they got rid of the blast sparrows. Soon, the all clear was sounded by the staff of the spaceship. The crowds got out of their room once again and the liveliness of the spaceship was restored.Lin Huang did not join them. He started to ponder about Li Yanxing\u2019s attack.Despite it being just one hit, Lin Huang was sure that if the sword skill was converted into a Skill Card, its ranking must have been at least a Rare Card.He tidied up his room, and started to practice the technique he had witnessed just a while ago\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who did not know his identity knew his name very well now.It was very noisy outside on each deck but Lin Huang had never left his room.In the living room, he was practicing the sword technique he witnessed Li Yanxing performing against the Black Sparrow earlier. In fact, it took him more than an hour to imitate Li Yanxing\u2019s skill. However, he was not rewarded with any skill pieces.It was not because of the level of Li Yanxing\u2019s technique was higher than that of Great Sword Scripture. It was due to the fact that he had only performed the technique once and Lin Huang had only watched it once as well. Unlike the Great Sword Scripture part 1, Scarface had practiced the same technique three times at each practice session and Lin Huang secretly watched it for a few days. He was given a very good reference standard with old Scarface. In addition, with the help of the calming tea, he could easily master the essence of the sword technique.Besides, from his previous experience of obtaining The Great Sword Scripture pieces, he understood that being rewarded skill pieces did not depend on the similarity of movement. The most important part was he had to master the essence of the sword technique.As long as he could master the essence of the technique, he would have a higher probability of being rewarded the skill pieces.Lin Huang had brandished his sword for the 1,000th time. However, still, he could not imitate the technique.He did not give up. He practiced again and again by recalling the scene when Li Yanxing slashed his sword.The sky got darker as time passed. The liveliness of the spaceship remained the same. Despite there being few people on deck, they all joined the entertainment events on the first floor.The bar was no longer as quiet as before and it played rock music into the night. It was so crowded and the people were dancing all around. After dancing for a while, some of the men had boners in their pants and immediately pulled the women with them to small rooms behind the bar. The moaning sounds of the woman and the heavy breathing sound of the man coming from the small rooms could be heard but the sounds were covered by the music played in the bar.If Lin Huang were here, his doubts regarding the odd wine names would probably start making sense.At midnight, the spaceship was still as lively as it was. However, Lin Huang had been practicing the technique for more than five hours in his room. Still, nothing was rewarded.He was drenched in sweat. He stopped, exhausted.\u201cIt\u2019s already 12 o\u2019clock. I should sleep earlier tonight and wake up early tomorrow to practice,\u201d Lin Huang thought as he looked at the clock and kept his sword back in his storage space.The level of the set of sword technique was Rare or even higher. If he were rewarded the complete set of skill pieces, he would gain another powerful sword combat skill. Even if the Rare sword skill had only one technique, which was the one that he saw, it would still be a great benefit to him.He went to the toilet and had a bath. It was 12.40am and Lin Huang was lying in bed. In just a short while, he fell asleep.At seven o\u2019clock the next morning, Lin Huang woke up and went to the first floor for breakfast. After having his breakfast, he went back to his room and continued practicing the technique.The Demonic Crystal Spaceship would normally take 28 hours to travel from foothold No.7C87 to foothold No.7C82. However, considering the time taken in which the spaceship stopped between footholds, it took approximately 29 hours to arrive.Lin Huang got on board the spaceship the day before at nine o\u2019clock in the morning. He estimated that the spaceship would arrive around one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. He had approximately six hours to practice the sword technique.The middle part of Lin Huang\u2019s living room had been emptied. All of the tables, chairs and other furniture were pushed against the wall or to the edge of the living room.He began to practice with his sword. He did the same movement repeatedly barefooted in the middle of the living room, not feeling tired at all.\u201cThis is wrong. Let\u2019s do it again! No, it\u2019s still wrong. Try again\u2026\u201dFrom around eight o\u2019clock in the morning until 11 o\u2019clock, Lin Huang could not recall how many times he had practiced. However, each time when he brandished with his sword, he would imagine a scene where he would compare his technique with the one performed by Li Yanxing, figuring out what he had missed out.All of a sudden, his technique of wielding the sword shadowed Li Yanxing\u2019s movement as he had imagined. Lin Huang was shocked and soon, he heard a notification jingle coming from Xiao Hei.\u201cCongratulations, you have gained a Skill Card \u201cThunder Sword\u201d pieces x1\u2033Lin Huang was stunned as he saw the notification. He asked, \u201cXiao Hei, if I was to collect and combine the \u201cThunder Sword\u201d pieces into a Skill Card, will I be rewarded with only one skill or a whole set of skill technique?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be rewarded a whole set of skill technique if you have collected a complete set of skill pieces,\u201d Xiao Hei replied.Xiao Hei\u2019s answer was beyond Lin Huang\u2019s expectation.\u201cAre you sure? If so, why couldn\u2019t I obtain more skill pieces after I was rewarded with \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture part 1\u201d Skill Card? According to what you said, I should be able to obtain pieces of \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture part 2\u2033 with part 1 skill that I have obtained.\u201d Lin Huang asked in doubt.\u201cThis was because of \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture\u201d had two different rarities for part 1 and part 2. You would not be able to master part 2 technique since its rarity is relatively higher. If they had the same rarity, you would be able to master it with \u2018The Great Sword Scripture part 1\u2019. Conversely, if you were rewarded with a technique of higher rarity such as \u201cThe Great Sword Scripture part 2\u2033, similarly, you would be able to derive \u2018The Great Sword Scripture Part 1\u2019. In short, one could derive a new technique with an existing technique of higher rarity or the same level of rarity. However, one would not be able to derive a new technique if its existing technique had a lower rarity,\u201d Xiao Hei explained.After listening to Xiao Hei\u2019s detailed explanation, Lin Huang then realized that there was a rule like that with such skills. However, Lin Huang felt happy as his doubts were cleared.This indicated that in most of the combat skills, he would only need to memorize a small part of the technique and practice it repeatedly. Eventually, he would be able to collect a complete set of Skill Card after he could grasp the essence of the technique, as long as the skill did not have skills of different rarities.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang practiced even harder as he knew about this.However, after an hour, he did not feel what he felt just now. He had yet to obtain the second skill piece. Lin Huang did not feel anxious about it, though. It was 12 o\u2019clock in the afternoon now. In less than an hour, they would be getting off the spaceship.He kept his sword and placed the furniture in its initial position. He took a bath and changed his clothes.He tidied up the room, checked and made sure that he did not leave any belongings there and left the room. Going down the floating stairs, he headed towards the deck beside the ship\u2019s entrance. He could see that the spaceship was landing.In just a few minutes, the spaceship landed at foothold No.7C82. Lin Huang scanned his ticket at the exit and the door automatically opened. Lin Huang stepped out of the spaceship\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was given such a name as the foothold had encountered monster hordes so many times and the residents were severely injured. In order to show that they hope for a better future, the human had named the foothold a Carefree City.One odd thing that happened was, ever since it was given such a name, fortune had particularly favored the foothold and monster hordes have never invaded them for over hundreds of years.The city had a slow pace of life. The residents were living and working in peace. Indeed, it was a carefree place.It was one o\u2019clock in the afternoon when Lin Huang arrived at Carefree City. He did not depart immediately but he headed towards the Adventurer Paradise.Adventurer Paradise was a subdivision of the Hunter Association\u2019s so-called Adventurer Association. It was specially established to recruit the adventurers going on exploration missions. However, as soon as the Hunter Association slowly transferred the explorer jobs out from the Adventurer Association, it was separated and became an independent organization, eventually changing its name to the Adventurer Paradise.The Hunter Association used to be a loosely organized organization. It was actually a training organization that cultivated talents. However, they could not control these talented people, causing the loss of top-class talent. The initial objective of establishing the Adventurer Association was to retain the talented individuals.However, the Adventurer Paradise imposed strict obligations whereby they had a totally different set of rules and regulations compared to that of the Hunter Association. The members of the Adventurer Association had to accept a mission within a specific period of time. Compared to the Hunter Association, it had better management.Despite Adventurer Paradise becoming an independent organization, both organizations in many ways were still interrelated.Lin Huang was seeking for a station at the Adventurer Paradise as he could not enter Wangyou Forest on his own.Wangyou Forest was located in the southwest of the Carefree City, approximately 3,000 kilometers away from the city. Towards this direction, not even a small sized foothold was found. In fact, small sized footholds had been built before but they had been repeatedly destroyed by monster hordes, causing injuries and casualties. Eventually, the authorities had decided to cease building them.Without the foothold, there would not be any stopping points for eagle rides, let alone traveling from one portal to another.It was an uninhabited area. The regions within 3,000 kilometers were wilderness that ranged from level-1 wild zones to level-3 wild zones.It would not be safe on the road even if Lin Huang rode on his iron-level rank-3 Sand Monster. Therefore, he was looking for a silver-level adventurer as a companion to enter Wangyou Forest.Soon, he found the Adventurer Paradise\u2019s station at a foothold. The entrance was crowded.As he entered the station, Lin Huang looked around. It was somehow similar to the Hunter Association\u2019s station as the design of the buildings were alike. The only difference was the atmosphere.Similarly, it was a square-shaped office that had a transparent polygonal dome at a height of around 10 meters. The wall was painted with light, warm, yellow paint. It felt totally different from the grayish-white colored wall of the Hunter Association. Besides, the color of the floor was different as well. The color of the floor was also light yellow here whereas the Hunter Association\u2019s floor was a dark gray color.As Lin Huang was looking around, a young female staff came up to him and asked, \u201cMister, can I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for an adventurer team to go to the Wangyou Forest,\u201d Lin Huang asked her.\u201cI\u2019ll help you to check on it,\u201d the female staff nodded her head and smiled. She led Lin Huang to the customer service counter. In just a short while, she had gotten the results. \u201cThere is a team going to Wangyou Forest four days from now. You\u2019re considered lucky as the leader of the team is of a Gold-level. She had a mission with her and had to stay at Wangyou Forest for a week. The next team heading towards Wangyou Forest would have been 12 days from now,\u201d she said.\u201cOf course, you may consider hiring an adventure team to escort you. After getting things done, they\u2019ll escort you back here. However, the expenses would be a lot higher,\u201d she continued.Lin Huang had inquired about this before through the network. He knew that there were two ways that he could follow the adventurer team. The first one was the adventurer team had to go on a mission and lead him to his destination while the other method was to directly hire an adventurer, the latter of which being more expensive. The credit points one needed to pay for were equal to the Life Crystals he consumed each day. However, the former cost only two credit points for a round trip.As he heard that he\u2019d be having a Gold-level adventurer as the team leader, Lin Huang made up his mind. \u201cThere\u2019s no need of hiring an adventurer, I\u2019ll just wait for a few days,\u201d he told the staff member.\u201cAlright, the full cost will be 20,000 credit points. Before making any payments, here\u2019s one special requirement for those who are heading towards Wangyou Forest.\u201d As soon as the female staff finished her sentence, a web page popped up in front of her. \u201cPlease read carefully before you agree to accept the terms and conditions.\u201dLin Huang took a look at it and realized that it was a disclaimer. It was briefly about the safety of the visitors heading towards Wangyou Forest. Upon arriving at Wangyou Forest, it was no longer the team\u2019s responsibility to protect the visitor. The team was only responsible for the visitor\u2019s safety during the journey. If the visitor died in Wangyou Forest, the team would not bear any responsibility and the fees once paid would not be refunded.Lin Huang nodded his head after he read. \u201cIf they had completed their task in Wangyou Forest after a week, but I\u2019m not done, for how many days will day wait for me?\u201d\u201cAt most, three days. Three days later, be it you\u2019re alive or dead, they\u2019ll be coming back. According to our rules, if you did not show up at the gathering point after three days, you\u2019re considered dead,\u201d she said.\u201cOf course, if there are some valid reasons that caused the delay, you may apply it through our network. However, additional charges will be incurred according to the expenses of employing an adventurer. Approval for deferment is subjected to the team\u2019s willingness.\u201d The staff explained the details. \u201cIf the team declines your application for deferment, you may apply to hire an adventurer team. However, the cost of the new team would be double the fee,\u201d she continued.\u201cI understand and accept the terms,\u201d Lin Huang nodded his head and scanned his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring on the lower right corner of the disclaimer, which was an empty space. Soon, his personal identity information was printed on it.\u201cPlease check the contract. If there\u2019s no other problem, please scan to confirm your payment by scanning the payment streaks at the end of the contract,\u201d the staff continued. A new page popped up.It was a simple employment contract. Lin Huang briefly looked through the contract and flipped to the last page of the contract. Using his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring, he scanned the payment streaks. It was somehow similar to the payment barcode that existed on Earth. However, the payment streaks looked nicer in color with a picture.In just a short while, a notification message to confirm transaction was completed and received. Also, the staff showed that payment was accepted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEmployer-employee relationship is established. The adventurer team will contact you soon. Please remember to record the venue and time to meet up,\u201d the female staff reminded him.\u201cYes, I know. Thank you,\u201d Lin Huang nodded his head and walked towards the exit of the station.Leaving the Adventurer Paradise, Lin Huang looked for a hotel. Since the adventurer team would depart four days later, he would have some extra time to practice his sword technique with the hope of collecting a complete set of skill pieces before his departure.Lin Huang checked the information of the hotel on the network. Suddenly, a notification message popped up. The content was short and simple, \u201cDepart three days later. Gather at the south door of the foothold at nine o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201dLooking at the message, Lin Huang grinned. \u201cThe message was clear and concise. He seems to be a guy who did not talk much. That\u2019s great. I can enjoy the silence on the trip,\u201d he thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was for sword training.He had four days before he exploring the Wangyou Forest and so Lin Huang wanted to accumulate skill card pieces. It would be perfect if he got a complete skill card before he left for Wangyou Forest. However, things did not go the way he imagined them to.Lin Huang checked into the hotel around two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Apart from the 20 minutes he spent having dinner, he practiced until 12 midnight. He had lost the momentum he had before. Even after 10 hours of practice, he did not obtain even one card piece.For the next three days, apart from eating and sleeping, Lin Huang had spent all his time on practice. He started at eight in the morning and practiced all the way to 12 midnight. In total, he practiced more than 15 hours every day.However, what he obtained within the three days were not up to his expectations.He only got hold of the rhythm of the sword twice and obtained two skill card pieces in three days.On the third night, he laid on his bed, exhausted. He was upset, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to mimic the rhythm after watching the demonstration once. If Li Yanxing was to show me more of his thunder sword or even a couple more times of the same technique, I would have more reference to practice and probably not seem as pathetic as I do now with the few card pieces I have.\u201dHe then went to bed, tired.The next morning, he washed up and then had a buffet breakfast on the second floor of the hotel. He then ordered a monster car and headed straight to the south door.A monster car was a transport similar to a carriage. In this world, it was only used for traveling within the city as the distance between one foothold to another would be too time-consuming as they were really far apart.The monster used for the monster car would usually be a creature that lived in the snow. It was a tamed hoofed creature with white hair, it looked like a horse but it was much bigger than a horse. Its body length was usually around three meters long and it had silver sharp teeth with a tremendously strong bite. It was an omnivore that loved meat.Lin Huang chose to ride on a monster car as it would attract too much attention if he rode on his Sand Monster or Ox Devil. Also, his monsters walked on two legs, they were not meant to be ridden on and it was uncomfortable to ride on them.It was cheap to ride on a monster car as it would only cost him one credit point for one kilometer. It cost Lin Huang 12 credit points to ride from the hotel to the southern door of the foothold.It was 8:50 a.m. when he arrived at the south door of the foothold. Just as he got off the monster car, he saw a familiar tall young man.\u201cLi Yanxing? Why is he here?\u201d Lin Huang found it strange, he thought about it and realized that since he was a VIP, he should have used the exclusive path for VIPs. That was perhaps why he did not see Li Yanxing when they got off the spaceship.There were three other young men with him. Lin Huang hardly left his room when he was on the spaceship. He had only seen Li Yanxing. He figured that the other three men could be royalty just like Li Yanxing was.As Lin Huang was checking them out, Li Yanxing looked at him and waved out of a sudden. Lin Huang thought that was odd. He looked around himself and realized that there was nobody else there and in response, Lin Huang pointed at himself.Li Yanxing nodded and gestured at him to go over.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s the one leading the team\u2026\u201d Lin Huang mumbled while walking towards the four of them.\u201cHi, my name is Li Yanxing. You must be the Lin Huang who is following our team, am I right?\u201d Li Yanxing smiled to Lin Huang while he walked closer to them.\u201cHi there, I\u2019ve seen you on the news.\u201d Lin Huang smiled and nodded, \u201cI\u2019m the one who is joining your team to Wangyou Forest, nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cBro Lin Huang, as we have a mission in Wangyou Forest, our schedule is pretty tight. We usually never have anyone else follow our team. We made a mistake by accidentally picking someone from the application form and now you\u2019re on our team\u2026\u201d Li Yanxing seemed troubled.\u201cIt\u2019s our mistake. We can give compensate you sufficiently so that you can hire an adventurer team. We do suggest that you withdraw from our team because we really do not wish to bring an outsider with us.\u201dThough Li Yanxing sounded sincere, Lin Huang hesitated. He thought he could secretly learn Li Yanxing\u2019s sword skill during the trip. But now that Li Yanxing insisted him to withdraw from his team and was willing to compensate him, it was hard for him to reject Li Yanxing\u2019s offer.Seeing that Lin Huang was not quite happy, Li Yanxing added, \u201cActually the highest wild zone in Wangyou Forest is only a grade-3 and therefore, a silver-level adventurer would be sufficient. There would be less risk if Bro Lin Huang hired a silver adventurer. If you follow us, we will have to part ways when we arrive in Wangyou Forest. If you hire a team, you could get them to bring you into the forest and they might even hunt for you.\u201dThe more Li Yanxing explained his position, the more convinced Lin Huang was. He did not choose to hire a team earlier as he did not have that kind of money. To hire an adventurer team, he would need 100,000 credit points for a day. The journey into Wangyou Forest would cost him 100,000 credit points and upon return, another 100,000 more. If there was a delay in the forest, he would be broke.Just when he was going to reply Li Yanxing, a notification came up and a communication box popped up in front of him.\u201cMission card activated due to special circumstances.\u201dA mission card then popped up.The blonde lady dressed in a black maid attire on top of the card started to speak.\u201cCongratulations, your mission card has been activated due to special circumstances!\u201d\u201cNow, let me announce your mission!\u201d\u201cYour mission is as follows: Follow Leng Yuexin into Wangyou Forest. After you have leveled-up to iron-level, follow Leng Yuexin back into Carefree City! Mission time limit: 15 days.\u201d\u201cMission Award: One Advance Card.\u201d\u201cIf you failed to complete the mission within given time, you will be punished: One of your monster cards will be randomly removed!\u201d\u201cMission announcement has been completed; you can read the description of the card.\u201dAfter the mission announcement was done, the blonde lady became stood still again.Lin Huang was doubtful as he did not see Leng Yuexin here at all. Why would his mission include following Leng Yuexin into Wangyou Forest if they were not there?As Lin Huang was thinking, a lady\u2019s voice spoke from behind him.\u201cYou must be Lin Huang who is following the team, is that right?\u201dLin Huang turned around; it was a poised woman standing behind him. She had black, short hair that covered half of her neck. She seemed very cold.\u201cMy name is Leng Yuexin, I am the team leader of the mission,\u201d she said.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Lin Huang who is following the team.\u201d After confirming her name, Lin Huang finally understood the reason why the mission card was activated.As the mission was confirmed, Lin Huang was not thinking of withdrawing himself from the team anymore.Seeing Lin Huang talking to Leng Yuexin, Li Yanxing frowned.The other royalty young man spoke too, \u201cBro Lin Huang, I thought you mentioned that something came up and that you won\u2019t be following us anymore?\u201dLin Huang looked at the young man and pretended not to know what he was talking about, \u201cDid I say that? Oh, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Lin Huang said shamelessly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNo matter what, he would not leave the team or else he would lose a monster card if he failed the mission. It would be a great loss if he were to lose Bai or Tyrant.Leng Yuexin noticed that there was something transpiring between the both of them. She interrupted the young man who was attempting to speak again and said \u201cSince he\u2019s here, let\u2019s go together. You can always handle your stuff when you\u2019re back, Lin Huang\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I have to do apart from this mission.\u201d Lin Huang mumbled innocently.Although his voice was soft, the rest heard him loud and clear.\u201cThen it must be my mistake\u2026\u201d The young man let out an awkward smile and did not speak again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li Yanxing was expressionless and it was obvious that the other young men were unhappy yet they did not say a word. It was awkward but Lin Huang decided to join the team anyway. He was also the only outsider who followed.\u201cI guess you don\u2019t have a mount, am I right?\u201d Leng Yuexin asked Lin Huang.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t afford that\u2026\u201d Lin Huang was honest.The young men from royalty judged Lin Huang when they heard what he said.\u201cYou\u2019ll ride with me then, I didn\u2019t bring extra mounts.\u201d Leng Yuexin offered but her expression remained cold, it was obvious that she was just offering so that she could complete the mission.\u201cBro Lin, why don\u2019t you ride with me instead? Miss Leng is a lady and it may not be convenient.\u201d Li Yanxing saw and offered Lin Huang a ride with him.Leng Yuexin looked at Lin Huang to wait for his decision.Lin Huang asked Xiao Hei, \u201cThe mission card requested me to enter Wangyou Forest with Leng Yuexin, must I ride with her or can we go our separate ways?\u201d\u201cYou can be separated from her as long as the both of you enter Wangyou Forest together.\u201dAfter hearing the response, Lin Huang said, \u201cI\u2019m good with anything as long as I get a ride.\u201dLin Huang noticed that it was because of Leng Yuexin that made Li Yanxing insist on him withdrawing from the mission. Now that he shamelessly joined the team, if he were to ride with Leng Yuexin, it would cause rifts between him and Li Yanxing. He did not want to complicate things as his goal was to complete his mission.In reality, he never wanted to be a third wheel. He did not expect to bump into Li Yanxing and the rest. If the mission card was not activated, he would definitely accept Li Yanxing\u2019s suggestion to hire an adventurer team to bring him into the forest. It would have been a better option as the team could get him to the area where the Six-Armed Demon was.Seeing that Lin Huang did not have any qualms, Leng Yuexin nodded without saying a word. They walked outside the south door foothold and took out their monster taming token. They then released the mounts from their tokens. The monster taming token was a unique tool that would create a contract with a tamed monster and seal the monster in the token. They can release the monster temporarily whenever they needed it.The token was comparable to relics as ordinary people could not afford to use it. Those who could afford it would only use it for mounts or to create a contract with rare mutated monsters. If one were to seal an ordinary monster in it, its value would drop lower than the price of the token.Moreover, not just anybody could tame a monster, only Imperial Censors could do that but it would cost a bomb.The five of them owned a mount each. Lin Huang was stunned at their spending power. Leng Yuexin\u2019s mount was a bird with blue feathers. Lin Huang could recognize it was a gold-level Blue Snow Eagle. It was a real raptor in the monster world. What got Lin Huang\u2019s attention was the Sky Dragon that Li Yanxing was riding.A Sky Dragon was a gold-level monster; it was a distant relative of a transcendent monster, the Flying Dragon. It looked approximately 80% like a Flying Dragon but its size was much smaller than 10 meters. The real Flying Dragon was a few hundred meters long and it was born a transcendent. It was hard to capture a flying dragon for transportation even for a transcendent human.Li Yanxing\u2019s Sky Dragon had almost reached its matured size; its scales were bloody red. It was considered a great Sky Dragon. The rest were riding an ordinary gold-level bird, incomparable with a Sky Dragon and a Blue Snow Eagle.They rode on their own monsters. When Lin Huang followed Li Yanxing to ride on the Sky Dragon, it glared and scoffed at Lim Huang. Li Yanxing ignored what it did and pretended that he did not see that. Lin Huang ignored it too and sat behind Li Yanxing.The unexpected appearance of five mounts at the entrance of foothold attracted many people. While the young men were proud of themselves, Li Yanxing was cool and calmed. Leng Yuexin did not care about the people. She patted the back of her blue snow eagle and departed from the foothold into the sky.Seeing that Leng Yuexin had departed, Li Yanxing and the others followed suit. The five of them headed to the southwest and soon disappeared among the people who gathered around to watch. The 3,000 kilometers journey only needed one and a half hours with the gold-level mounts. They were flying at 2,000 kilometers per hour; it was the same speed as a supersonic aircraft on earth. It was just an ordinary monster\u2019s flying speed; they had yet to reach their maximum speed.Sitting on the Sky Dragon, Lin Huang could not feel the air pressure at all. It was strange for Lin Huang and he did not understand the theory. Just when he wanted to ask, he recalled Li Yanxing not being that interested to make small talk with him so he dodged the thought.Unsure if the gold-level seats were too powerful or for some other reasons, they were not attacked by any birds during the past one and a half hours. It was a bummer as Lin Huang was planning to watch Li Yanxing sword technique if they were attacked. Soon one and a half hours had passed and they landed outside of Wangyou Forest. They got down from their seats and sealed their monsters into the monster taming token.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLi Yanxing and the rest planned to part ways with Lin Huang immediately except for Leng Yuexin. She asked Lin Huang, \u201cWhat are you trying to hunt for? If we\u2019re on the same path, we can bring you along. We\u2019re familiar with where the monsters are scattered in this forest.\u201dLi Yanxing and the rest who were standing 10 meters away glared impatiently at Lin Huang.\u201cI\u2019m here to get to iron-level, the Life Seed prey that I\u2019m looking for is a Six-Armed Demon.\u201d Lin Huang told her his intention. \u201cSix-Armed Demon? Why would you choose this monster?\u201d Leng Yuexin found it strange, \u201cAlthough the Six-Armed Demon is considered the top monster in iron-level, I would advise you to get another Life Seed prey for I fear you might lose your life anytime.\u201dAlthough what Leng Yuexin said was unpleasant to his ears, Lin Huang knew that she had said that for his own good. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, if I really can\u2019t manage to kill it, I will consider other Life Seed prey. Let me give it a try first.\u201d Lin Huang declined her suggestion tactfully. \u201cYou guys go ahead, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d \u201cLet us bring you there since we\u2019re on the same path. I will tell you when we have reached and then we can part ways.\u201d Leng Yuexin did not say much since Lin Huang was adamant with his decision, but she insisted to bring him along anyway.\u201cSince we\u2019re on the same path, then I\u2019ll follow you again.\u201d Lin Huang did not expect Leng Xueyin to be so helpful. I\u2019ll continue to be the third wheel then.\u201d Li Yanxing and the rest were obviously annoyed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to bring him along with us\u2026\u201d\u201cI think so too, we can\u2019t be carrying this kid on our back\u2026\u201d the other two young men added on.\u201cSince we need three to five days to arrive there, it doesn\u2019t really make a difference even if he slows us down.\u201d Leng Yuexin insisted to bring Lin Huang into the forest.\u201cSince Miss Leng wants to bring Bro Lin along, we\u2019ll do so then. It wouldn\u2019t make a difference with an extra person as we can take a slow walk and enjoy the scenery.\u201d Instead of rejecting, Li Yanxing agreed to what Leng Yuexin said. \u201cBro Lin, you can follow us but just be careful for your own safety on the road.\u201dThe young men did not say a word since Li Yanxing spoke. Lin Huang looked at him with a bewildered expression. He thought Li Yanxing would oppose the idea of him following them. He started to think that Li Yanxing was up to something. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be bothering you guys for a little longer, I apologize.\u201d Lin Huang smiled and said. He behaved himself during the journey by not being talkative.Lin Huang was nothing in Li Yanxing and the gang\u2019s eyes since he was not even an iron-level. They did not realize that Lin Huang knew what they were up to. \u201cUse your Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring to mark down the route, you can follow the route when you return and wait for us here. Our mission would take five to seven days, it would not take more than 10 days. I will send you a message when we are done with our mission. If you are not here when we return, we will wait for you for another three days. We would leave three days later if you did not show up. By then, you will have to hire another team to assist you.\u201d Leng Yuexin told Lin Huang before they departed.\u201cI understand.\u201d Lin Huang nodded.The rest did not say a word and headed into the forest. Lin Huang followed behind them. The six of them walked into the forest. Besides Lin Huang, the rest of them looked like they were on a vacation, they did not seem nervous at all. Lin Huang was slightly nervous as if it was a grade-4 wild zone. It was not an amusement park as any monsters that were over iron-level were life-threatening to him.Soon, they faced monsters attacks. The young men killed all the monsters easily and their dead bodies were scattered everywhere. Lin Huang was tempted to keep the dead monsters but was shy. The dead bodies could be sold to the Hunter Association. A complete iron-level monster could be sold up to 10,000 credit points. A bronze-level could be sold up to 100,000 credit points.As they ventured further into the jungle, the monsters that attacked them were upgraded from iron-level to bronze-level. Lin Huang noticed that they did not even look at the monster after they killed them; he picked up the bronze-level monsters along the way and kept them with him. Fortunately, the sizes of monsters were not too big. Lin Huang\u2019s space storage was almost full after picking up more than 10 monsters. It seemed like 100 cubic meters was not enough and he had spent one million credit points to upgrade his storage space to 1,000 cubic meters.Looking at him picking up the dead bodies, the young men scoffed because the money was insignificant to them. Lin Huang, on the other hand, did not care what they thought about him since they would not be seeing each other after the mission completed. It was their business how they wanted to think of Lin Huang. The money that he could obtain by selling the dead bodies was his priority.Following these princes, Lin Huang collected more than 100 bronze-level monster bodies within three hours. The space storage that he had just upgraded was full again with dead bodies that were worth more than 10 million credit points. He then upgraded his space storage to 3,000 cubic meters with two million credit points. He was only left with 100,000 credit points now.After another seven hours, Lin Huang collected much more dead monsters. His only regret was not being able to see Li Yanxing fight. Along the way, all the monsters were killed by the three young men and Li Yanxing did not have to move at all. Same with Leng Yuexin, Lin Huang did not even have any idea what kind of weapons did Leng Yuexin possessed.It was six in the evening and the sky was dark in the forest. Lin Huang estimated he was near his destination. If he did not follow the team, he would need at least two or three days to get into the forest carefully.A monster roar came from not too far away distracting Lin Huang\u2019s thoughts. Many bird-like monsters flew away from the fear of the roar. Lin Huang could tell that the monster was powerful that it could be at least silver-level. However, that did not bother Leng Yuexin and the rest at all. They proceeded straight into the area without hesitating for a second.Soon, a gigantic Sky Dragon covered in crimson gold scales appeared before them. It was devouring a giant dead monster with its back facing them. The Sky Dragon was 30 meters long and more than 10 meters tall, it looked like a T. Rex that was at one time, bigger.Lin Huang recognized it as a Sky Dragon but he did not know its actual name. He then asked Leng Yuexin softly, \u201cMiss Leng, what is this monster? Why does it look like a Gold-Armored Dragon but the size of its scales and the sharpness of its claws and teeth seemed different?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is a Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon, it was a Gold Armored Aragon that went through one round of mutation. Among the gold-level monsters, it is considered to be the strongest amongst creatures of its level.\u201d Leng Yuexin explained calmly. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re lucky to be able to bump into a mutated monster in such good condition. It\u2019s a bummer that we\u2019re not with Imperial Censors, or else we could tame and deal it.\u201d A prince in a hat said.\u201cYou call this a good condition? This is a masterpiece! Don\u2019t be pretentious, Ge Ping. I\u2019m sure that you would run away if you were to fight this Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon on your own!\u201d One of them teased.\u201cA gold-level rank-3 Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon\u2019s ability is comparable with a hunter that is on the top 100 in the Gold Hunters Leaderboard. Myself aside; the both of you would be dead if you fought it yourselves!\u201d Ge Ping said angrily.\u201cOnly Miss Leng and Bro Li could handle such a monster.\u201d The skinny young man said and looked at Li Yanxing. \u201cThis monster would be a great help if we can tame it. Too bad we have a mission with us. Even with the presence of an Imperial Censor, taming would take time. Seems like the only way is to kill it\u2026\u201d Li Yanxing said while looking at the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon.Although the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon was eating earlier, it noticed them staring but it did not care. Lin Huang was stiff when he saw it staring at them, he could feel that death was near, his breath became heavier\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They did not dare to move as the slight movement would trigger the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon to attack. \u201cShould I kill it or do you want to kill it?\u201d Leng Yuexin looked at Li Yanxing. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll do it, how could I let a lady do this.\u201d Li Yanxing smiled and held his right hand in the air. A black sword appeared slowly in his hand.The Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon was not happy that it was disturbed from eating, now that it was irritated by them, it became furious. It turned around and stared a deadly stare at Li Yanxing with its tail moving left to right. It seemed to be thinking, it could tell the man in front of him was the most powerful one among the rest. It could even feel the threat of death from him. As one of the top monsters in the area, it did not allow itself to run away. To it, only the weak would run away when facing a powerful enemy.After a slight hesitation, the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon attacked Li Yanxing. They were only a few hundred meters away from each other, it only took the dragon a few steps to arrive in front of them. Lin Huang wanted to dodge it but he saw Li Yanxing move. He leaped when the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon approached him with its mouth wide open.Just when he was falling into the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon\u2019s mouth, he leaped and appeared behind the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon. Before Lin Huang could figure out what happened, the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon groaned and fell on the ground. Li Yanxing landed on the ground. There was blood dripping from his black sword, he then kept his sword into the scabbard and frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not dead yet?\u201d The young man in hat asked.\u201cI underestimated it and did not give my all in that slash. However, it won\u2019t live for long.\u201d Li Yanxing said calmly, he did not seem like he was going to give it another hit.Lin Huang saw that the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon\u2019s neck was cut open, blood was bursting out from the wound. Although its will to live was strong, it would not live for long. However, as long as the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon was not dead, Lin Huang could not keep it in his storage space. He was thinking if he should follow Leng Yuexin and the gang to the foothold where the Six-Armed Demon was or to stay and wait for the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon to die. The latter was much riskier as he had to walk alone later on and the blood of the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon would attract other powerful monsters to him. However, the temptation to keep this monster was huge because it costs at least a billion credit points.Of course, Lin Huang knew that it would not be a smart move for him to stay. With his ability, it was hard for him to survive if monsters were to swamp him. Just when he was deciding, Li Yanxing spoke, \u201cLet\u2019s continue our journey. Bro Lin, you will arrive at your destination in less than an hour.\u201d He smiled at Lin Huang, Lin Huang could see through the grin that he was hiding. He then realized that Li Yanxing did not kill the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon on purpose so that Lin Huang would leave the team alone. He knew very well that Lin Huang could not resist such a valuable carcass.Lin Huang felt a chill in his body. Just when he wanted to leave the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon behind and follow the team, Xiao Hei spoke.\u201cA dying dragonkin mutated monster is detected, it is suitable to integrate with the dragonkin mutated monster soul you have in your body. Would you like to integrate the monster soul for a new dragonkin Monster Card?\u201dLin Huang\u2019s eyes lit up when he heard what Xiao Hei said. He then turned around and said loudly to Li Yanxing and the rest,\u201d You guys go ahead. I need to pee, I\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d Leng Yuexin frowned and did not say a word. Li Yanxing smirked. He said to Lin Huang, \u201cAlright then, we will make a move first.\u201dAfter they left, Lin Huang asked Xiao Hei immediately, \u201cXiao Hei, how do I integrate them?\u201d\u201cYou need to place your hand on the dying dragonkin monster to integrate the dragonkin-monster\u2019s soul. During the integration, you can choose to consume your card pieces.\u201d\u201cThe higher the level of card pieces and the more the amount, the rarer the quality of the integrated card. However, no matter how many card pieces are there, the rarity of the integrated card would not be lower than the rarity of the monster soul and the dragonkin monster.\u201dLin Huang was over the moon when he heard what Xiao Hei said. It meant he would definitely obtain a rare Monster Card of a dragonkin monster and its rarity might be even higher. He then walked to the back of the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon. It was losing its breath and would die any minute.Lin Huang placed his hand on its back and instructed Xiao Hei to begin the integration, \u201cConsume all remaining card pieces for monster soul integration.\u201d\u201cThis integration will consume the black python in your body and 3,057 card pieces. Confirm integration?\u201d\u201cConfirmed! Delay no more and do it immediately!\u201d Lin Huang could not wait any longer.Just when he was done talking, a black glow shot out from the middle of his palm and went into the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon\u2019s body. He knew that was the black python\u2019s soul. Soon, the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon\u2019s body became a dot of white light and slowly faded into a card on Lin Huang\u2019s palm. The card was still covered in white glow on his palm and he could not see the color or the image on the card.It was only when the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon\u2019s body completely turned into a white dot that the card became material on his palm. After the white glow faded, the card appeared. Lin Huang was overjoyed when he saw the color of the card, \u201cBlue Epic! It\u2019s a real blue Epic Card!\u201d It was the first time for Lin Huang to get a blue Epic Monster Card, it was much happier than getting a SSR card in the game \u2018Master XX\u2019!After celebrating for a while, Lin Huang noticed that there was a black dragon with wings on the surface of the card but its size seemed small. He then turned the card around to read the detailed description.\u201cMonster Card\u201d\u201cRarity: Epic\u201d\u201cMonster Name: Undying Baby Dragon\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Dragonkin (Beginner)\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Iron-level 3-star\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Black Dragon Flame (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Dragon Power (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 3: Enhanced Regeneration (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 4: Elemental Immunity (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSkill 5: Absolute Defense(Beginner)\u201d\u201cSummoning Limit: Activated\u201d\u201cRemarks: The monster will evolve into an adult Undying Black Dragon when it is upgraded to transcendent.\u201d\u201cCard remarks: Trainable\u201dLooking at those cool skill names, Lin Huang could not help but swear, \u201cF*ck, this is too good to be true!\u201d Noticing that the \u2018beginner\u2019 behind the type of monster, Lin Huang asked Xiao Hei,\u201dXiao Hei, what does \u2018Dragonkin (Beginner)\u2019 mean?\u201d\u201cThis is categorized by the dragonkin\u2019s level. The lowest one would be Sky Dragons. A dragonkin that was higher level than a sky dragon would be the actual dragonkin. Dragonkin are powerful creatures. The blood of a dragonkin is graded in the following levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Pureblood. The rarity of the card could be Epic, Legendary, Mythical or Godlike.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a Godlike card rarity level?!\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s eyes widened when he heard Xiao Hei\u2019s explanation. It was his first time hearing about a Godlike rarity level. However, he knew that getting a dragonkin on his side was good enough. Without dwelling in too much, he turned the card around to read more about the skills.\u201cBlack Dragon Flame (Beginner): A unique skill exclusively for dragonkin creature. The black Dragon Flame contains a corrosive substance that can burn almost anything.\u201d\u201cDragon Power (Beginner): A unique skill exclusively for dragonkin creatures. It could deter most of the monsters that are within one level above the host, ineffective for monsters that have high intelligence.\u201d\u201cEnhanced Regeneration (Beginner): Passive skill, the host would have strong regenerative abilities which include limb regeneration.

He gave his instruction right after reading, \u201cXiao Hei, extract skill card.\u201d\u201cSkill card extraction activated\u2026 Selecting a skill for host\u2026 Random selection completely\u2026 Congratulations, you have received \u2013 Absolute Defense (Beginner).\u201dAfter receiving the new skill, Lin Huang looked at his Exclusive Card immediately.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Great Sword Scripture (Sword Skill)\u201d\u201cSkill 3: Robust (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cSkill 4: Spectral Snowsteps (Body Movement)\u201d\u201cSkill 5: Magic Eye Deterrence (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cSkill 6: Immense Strength (Intermediate)\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSkill 7: Absolute Defence (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 1\u201d\u201cRemark: Hmm, you have quite a lot of skills. What more can I say?\u201dHe ignored Xiao Hei\u2019s tease in the remark, he was happy. Although the skill that he really wanted was Enhanced Regeneration, Absolute Defence was suitable for short distance attacks as well. Considering that Li Yanxing and the rest was not far away, Lin Huang stopped fantasizing and summoned the Undying Baby Dragon. He did not want them to find out about the dragonkin monster. He kept the card and calmed himself. He sprinted towards the direction where Li Yanxing and the rest were headed toward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leng Yuexin sensed something odd too but none of them said a thing. The young man in a hat then said while laughing, \u201cI thought you sacrificed your life for the dead body of the monster.\u201d\u201cThe Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon wasn\u2019t dead yet and its blood would attract other monsters. It\u2019s not worth it if I traded my life for money. I just needed to pee really badly.\u201d Lin Huang responded innocently.Hearing his explanation, they did not say anything since Lin Huang was approaching his destination and they would soon part ways. Not long later, Lin Huang asked Leng Yuexin, \u201cMiss Leng, is the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon part of the dragonkin?\u201d Lin Huang knew the answer to his question but he asked anyway so that he could know more about the dragonkin from the royalty. He figured there must be more information on the Heart Network available for the royalty.The young men scoffed when they heard Lin Huang\u2019s question but Leng Yuexin thought that such a question was not silly at all! She shook her head and explained, \u201cNo, the Gold-Armored Dragons belong to a sub-species that are below the Sky Dragons since the very beginning. Even if it mutated into a Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon, the dragon blood in its body would never reach the concentration of a Sky Dragon\u2019s blood.\u201d\u201cIf the concentration of the dragon blood in its body is near the concentration of a Sky Dragon\u2019s blood since birth when it evolves to a transcendent, a certain transformation would happen to its blood and it would upgrade to a Sky Dragon. If the dragon blood concentration is insufficient, even if it evolved into a transcendent, it would just be a mutated transcendent monster, nothing like a Sky Dragon.\u201d\u201cThe dragonkin are monsters that have at least 30% dragon blood concentration. These monsters were born with supernatural powers from the dragon family such as Dragon Flame, Dragon Power and more. We won\u2019t be able to see the power of a real dragonkin.\u201d\u201cMonsters that have 10% to 30% of dragon blood concentration could only be a Sky Dragon species no matter how powerful they are as they don\u2019t possess the power of a true dragonkin. Most of the Sky Dragons are powerful as they are born with combat strength that surpassed a transcendent. They are a dream flying creature of many hunters.\u201d\u201cFor those with a dragon blood concentration less than 10%, they are nothing like a Sky Dragon. They are just slightly more powerful than ordinary monsters that are on the same level as them and this Gold-Armored Dragon belongs to this category. The Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon that we saw earlier was mutated from a Gold-Armored Dragon, its dragon blood concentration must have been upgraded, that was why it was more powerful.\u201d\u201cSince it did not die from the single hit by Bro Li earlier, the dragon blood concentration of the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon should be more than 8%. With such a concentration, it could experience a second mutation if trained properly and increase its dragon blood to 10% and above to a Sky Dragon.\u201dLeng Yuexin was worried that Lin Huang would not understand so she explained all the details. She was born in royalty with a silver spoon. Though she met many extraordinary young people in the past few years, she did not communicate much with civilians including Lin Huang. Lin Huang was a few years younger than her and he was out in the wild on his own without any companion to hunt Life Seed monsters with him. He was even collecting all the bronze-level monster bodies that were worthless to her just to get credit points. She pitied him.Lin Huang did not know what Leng Yuexin thought of him, he saw her as genuine. Although she seemed cold upfront, she was a kind person within. After hearing Leng Yuexin\u2019s explanation, he further asked, \u201cHas there ever been any real dragonkin in Division7 before?\u201dHe asked the question as he wanted to know if the dragonkin was the ultimate combat strength in this world. \u201cThere\u2019s no such record in the history of Division7, but there was one dragonkin that appeared in Division3 600 years ago. It was huge and many transcendents were killed but the Heart Network had made this case inaccessible. I\u2019m not sure what exactly happened. I\u2019ve asked the older generation in my family but they did not want to tell me.\u201d Leng Yuexin shook her head.\u201cI know something about this case.\u201d Li Yanxing interrupted, \u201cI heard the death of many transcendent alarmed a demigod and the dragonkin was killed. All the information about the case was sealed by the Union Government because it involved a demigod!\u201dLin Huang knew how rare the Undying Baby Dragon that he had was. He got the answers to his questions and he kept quiet thereafter as there was really nothing much to speak about with these royal brats.Within an hour, they arrived at Lin Huang\u2019s destination. \u201cAlright, Bro Lin Huang, just walk in the direction heading towards the west and you will arrive at the area with the Six-Armed Demons.\u201d Li Yanxing said while the rest took rest under a tree.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself if you cannot do it. Yes, a Life Seed monster is important but also remembers that you\u2019re just upgrading to iron-level. In fact, you can choose other more powerful Life Seeds when you have upgraded. You still have other choices if you\u2019re not able to kill the Six-Armed Demon\u201d Leng Yuexin advised him again.\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019ll get another one if I cannot handle the monster. Although I have no idea what your mission is, all the best to all of you.\u201d Lin Huang nodded and smiled at Leng Yuexin. \u201cWe hope so too.\u201d Leng Yuexin returned the smile. It was the first time Lin Huang saw her smiling. Li Yanxing and the rest did not say anything, they then left with Leng Yuexin.Lin Huang then summoned Bai and left for the west. Bai walked in front of Lin Huang. In this level-4 wild zone, although most of the monsters at the border were iron-level and bronze-level, there could be silver-level and gold-level monsters too. Just like the Crimson Gold-Armored Dragon which was hunting for food at the border of the area, it was unfortunate that it bumped into Li Yanxing.Even with Bai, Lin Huang was not completely safe at the border. Now that Bai was just iron-level rank-3, they could handle those that were on bronze-level rank-1 but not those that were bronze-level rank-2 and rank-3. Lin Huang tried not to use his GrayEagle17 here as this world was different from earth. The sound of a gunshot would not chase monsters away but it would attract them instead. The monsters knew that there was a human behind every gunshot. To most of the monsters, human flesh was much more delicious than the flesh of other monsters. It was a rare delicacy.Lin Huang and Bai took their time and walked slowly. Although the two-kilometer journey to the Six-Armed Demons was not long, they spent an hour before arriving at the much-awaited destination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Legend says that the undying were a new species that was born from drinking the water at the Fountain of Youth. They were called the undying not because they could not be killed but they had a long life. In this world, most of the human below transcendent had 360 columns on their Life Wheel and each column of Life Light represented one year of life. Even if all of the gray columns were activated at once, the most one could live was less than 720 years. Even gold-level creatures were not exceptions to this unless they upgraded to a transcendent.Besides humans, most of the monsters below transcendent could not live more than 1,000 years. On the other hand, it was a different story for the undying. If they were not killed, they could easily live up to thousands of years, sometimes 10,000 years. They lived longer than most monsters did.The Union Government\u2019s species research institute had captured more than 100 different types of undying creatures for research purposes. They found out that as long as the undying was not triggered by the outside world, it could wander in a room which was less than 10 square meters for a few hundred years. It did not need food or a drop of water to live. It seemed like their purpose of life was to wander aimlessly until their long lives finally came to an end.Six-Armed Demons were alike the other undying. They wandered around the small area in Wangyou Forest all year round. They were like souls that could not rest in peace on the lands. The area where Six-Armed Demons usually gathered had lands that were barren and black. There were no flowers or any plants, only dried rotten wood but the trees were actually dead. That area was obviously distinguishable from the rest of the forest.The area was the undying\u2019s hub because their presence there slowly absorbs the lives of things around them. If they remained in the same area for a longer time, plants would stop growing and trees would eventually die.It was 7:30 at night and the sky was dark. Lin Huang hid behind the tree outside the border. Half of his head was showing, he was peeking at the barren land. Within sight, he saw three Six-Armed Demons in red dressed wandering, they seemed to be guarding their territory.Lin Huang chose to wait patiently as it was not a smart move to trigger three of these monsters at the same time. The Six-Armed Demon\u2019s combat strength was the same as Bai\u2019s strength. If three of them were to attack him at once, he would die there if he failed to away in time.The three Six-Armed Demons\u2019 dresses were less than 20 centimeters above the ground. They wandered eerily on the burnt land, slow like a person taking a stroll in the park. Lin Huang was a little scared as it was the first time for him to see a monster like this. It looked so much like the ghost that he saw in the movies when he was young.After waiting for 10 minutes, finally, two of the Six-Armed Demons disappeared. It was coming towards his direction. \u201cXiao Hei, connect my Life Wheel with Bai\u2019s!\u201d Lin Huang said to Xiao Hei immediately. Only three columns in his Life Wheel were gray columns, he had to get Bai to kill a monster so that the Life Light in his Life Wheel would be completely full.\u201cLife Wheel has been connected!\u201dAfter hearing Xiao Hei\u2019s voice, Lin Huang said softly to Bai, \u201cI will go out later and once the Six-Armed Demon has noticed me, you will kill it that instance. Remember, you have to break the mask on her face!\u201dLin Huang jumped towards the right side of the tree and waved at the Six-Armed Demon, \u201cCome get me, beauty. Come catch me\u2026 Hehehe\u2026\u201dThe Six-Armed Demon immediately began running towards Lin Huang. \u201cWhat the, why is it moving so fast!\u201dThe six crystal jade arms came towards Lin Huang like sharp knives. If he was hit, his body would be sliced into pieces. \u201cBai, quick!\u201d Lin Huang managed to dodge the collision. At the same time, a golden glow shone in the dark. A crimson gold sharp thorn stabbed between the Six-Armed Demon\u2019s mouth and nose on its mask, it pierced through the back of its head. The other side of the thorn was connected to Bai\u2019s back. Ever since Bai used the Flawless Card the last time, his Blood Power turned from red to gold and it was a few times sharper than it used to be.The Six-Armed Demon stood still but there was no blood at all. The mask on its face broke, its body in the red dress and six arms started to disintegrate. Soon, it was left with its black hair on the ground. Seeing that the Six-Armed Demon had died, Lin Huang got up from the ground and patted the soil away from his body. There was something going on with his Life Wheel. The last three gray columns in his Life Wheel were filled with white Life Light. The 360 columns in Lin Huang\u2019s Life Wheel were completely filled with white Life Lights!\u201cMy Life Lights are finally full! As soon as I kill one more Six-Armed Demon myself, I would complete a Life Light Baptism and obtain a Life Seed to be upgraded to iron-level!\u201d Lin Huang was getting excited. \u201cLet\u2019s go, we will search along the border to look for lonely Six-Armed Demons!\u201d Lin Huang said to Bai and left the place.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs Lin Huang and Bai walked along the barren area, they did not see any other monsters at all. They walked for five to six kilometers and finally, they saw a couple Six-Armed Demons gathering around. There were more than five of them in a group; there was no way for Lin Huang to attack.A couple of hours later after they were halfway through the burnt area, Lin Huang finally saw two Six-Armed Demons under a dead tree. However, one of them had a different colored dress. Instead of bright red color, it was a pale purple dress. \u201cCould this be a mutated monster?\u201d Lin Huang looked at the Six-Armed Demon in a purple dress for quite some time hesitant to attack it just yet.The Six-Armed Demon in purple dress was staring into space under the tree while the one in the red dress was wandering less than 10 meters behind it, it seemed to be protecting the one in a purple dress.Lin Huang finally came up a risky decision after observing the Six-Armed Demon\u2019s habits and characteristics, \u201cI don\u2019t care, let\u2019s kill the one protecting and then the one that\u2019s staring into space.\u201d They did not have a vocal cord and therefore, they cannot alert their companions when they were in danger. Also, whenever they noticed there was an enemy around, they would move alone and not in a herd. What Lin Huang wanted was to use the gap of time before the mutated Six-Armed Demon could react to kill the one that was protecting the other one. By that, he could avoid fighting the both of them at the same time.Lin Huang whispered to Bai, \u201cI\u2019ll distract the one guarding and you must be quick to break its mask. Then use your Blood Power to lock down the one in the purple dress but leave that for me to kill.\u201d Lin Huang then went into the forest and waved to the Six-Armed Demon that was guarding. It saw Lin Huang immediately and plunged towards him. At the same time, the one in purple dress turned 180 degrees. It had a strange white mask and a pair of bloody eyes that opened suddenly, staring deadly at Lin Huang. Lin Huang had goosebumps that very moment\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Six-Armed Demon was mutated and much more dangerous than a vampire. Its ability in that purple dress was definitely no weaker than Bai. What scared Lin Huang was that the other Six-Armed Demon would plunge towards him.By then, it was definitely impossible to escape. These demons moved at the speed of light and if they stood still, they would die. \u201cBai, kill the one in the front first!\u201d Lin Huang yelled at Bai. He thrust his iron sword forward, his body like an arrow shooting towards the Six-Armed Demon.Lin Huang knew that every second mattered in this battle. He and Bai must kill the Six-Armed Demon in front before the demon in the purple dress attacked them.The Six-Armed Demon shot its six arms like six guns towards Lin Huang. Its arms seemed smooth but they were actually as tough as metal. It was nothing less than an iron-level armor, powerful. Its nails were like sharp knives, they glowed underneath the moonlight. Its six arms could transform into various killing weapons anytime it wanted.The six arms shot at him like lightning. Lin Huang did not retreat but moved even closer. He knew very well that if he did not handle this demon\u2019s six arms, Bai will not be able to kill it with one shot. Lin Huang glanced at that demon in the purple dress which stood behind him. Lin Huang was slightly relieved as it hadn\u2019t moved, yet.Lin Huang quickly started a short distance combat with the Six-Armed Demon. The iron sword in his hand slashed at it again and again. He was weaker than the iron-level rank-3 Six-Armed Demon. Lin Huang would be asking for death if they made a frontal collision and playing defensively was the only strategy that might work.However, the six arms deviated from its original attack plan and began attacking like a tarsal bone maggot. Lin Huang\u2019s pupil shrunk, his no trail snow-stepping power had reached its ultimate level. He swung his sword again to defend himself from attacks. \u201cBai!\u201d Lin Huang cried to Bai.Bai sprang from the forest. It ran fast and a pair of crimson gold wings on top of his back emerged, turning into a spear. It shot the mask of the Six-Armed Demon. Just then, a ghostlike purple shadow appeared beside Lin Huang, a white glow was moving towards Lin Huang\u2019s heart silently.\u201cF*ck!\u201d Lin Huang was sweating, he did not expect the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress to sneakily dodge his attack. Lin Huang could not avoid it.\u201cWarning! You are being attacked. Within 0.3 seconds, your death rate would be 100%. An emergency plan is automatically activated!\u201d\u201cLooking for available cards to solve the crisis\u2026 Looking for emergency plan\u2026 You can use your Provisional Transformation Card to transform yourself into a vampire to block the current attack.\u201d\u201cWould you like to utilize your Provisional Transformation Card?\u201dSuddenly, Xiao Hei\u2019s notifications popped out in his mind. When he heard the last sentence, he yelled \u201cYes!\u201dJust when he said that Lin Huang felt like the world was slowing down and his body was transforming at a rapid pace. He could not see what happened to his appearance, but he could feel that his body was different. A warm force was rising in his heart, there was a strange feeling on his back. He felt something springing out from his back. All at once, the world appeared red in his eyes.In the bloody world, he saw what exactly happened in the battle that he was in. Bai\u2019s Blood Power wings were turned into a spear and almost priced through the Six-Armed Demon\u2019s mask while the demon in purple dress was about to attack him from a meter away. The other side of Bai\u2019s Blood Power wings turned into another spear and attempted to attack the demon in the purple dress but it was blocked by its five arms.An arm of the Six-Armed Demon in purple dress transformed into a long needle that looked like a poisonous scorpion and it was less than three centimeters from Lin Huang\u2019s chest\u2026\u201cBlock this!\u201d Lin Huang had that thought immediately.His heart was racing, he felt his back turn warm. Within seconds, a pair of red gold wings shielded his chest and collided with the sharp arm.Bai, on the other hand, used his wings as a spear and pierced through the Six-Armed Demon\u2019s mask. After killing the first demon, Bai continued to slash the mask of the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang did not care if the transformation to kill the Six-Armed Demon in purple dress may have prevented him from upgrading to iron-level. His Blood Power wings combined with Bai\u2019s attack turned them into two crimson gold swords. The swords pierced through the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress.It did not panic at all. Its three arms on the left held Bai\u2019s left Blood Power wing while the remaining three arms were defending against the attacks. Lin Huang retreated when the attack did not work because short distance combat was not his strongest trait.However, the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress seemed to know Lin Huang\u2019s intention. Its ghostly body followed him. Its six arms were turned into sharp knives and attacked Lin Huang like thunderstorms, again and again. Thankfully, Lin Huang\u2019s crimson gold Blood Power wings managed to block all the attacks.Noticing that its attacks were redundant, the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress was forced to retreat. Bai did not look anywhere else but stared deadly at the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress. It stared back but upon realizing that it might lose the battle, it vanished.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re running away?! You have wasted my Transformation Card and now you\u2019re running away? I will not let that happen!\u201d Lin Huang shouted and chased after the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress. Bai followed behind him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His movements were as fast as Bai, they were chasing after the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress but it was still faster than they were.Initially, when the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress gave up on attacking Lin Huang, it was already out of the attack zone of his Blood Power. Now that the both of them were chasing it, the distance was getting farther. Lin Huang could not get over the fact that the demon was getting away. He was almost killed by the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress and he was forced to use his provisional transformation card. If he did not kill this Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress, he would never forgive himself.Furious, he was utilizing his Spectral Snowsteps without even realizing. His speed was a few times faster and soon, he was near the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress.\u201cWait, can I still use my own skills while in transformation mode?!\u201d Lin Huang thought he could not use his own skills after he was transformed. His eyes brightened up, \u201cThat means I can also use my \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019!\u201dHe caught up to the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress soon and turned his right Blood Power wing into a sword and swung at it. It was the 19th style in the \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019. The red gold sword was like an arrow plunging towards the back of the demon\u2019s head under the moonlight.The demon had senses in its back and tried to dodge Lin Huang\u2019s attack. Just when it attempted to escape, it realized that one of its arms on its left was tied by a crimson gold object. Lin Huang had secretly turned his left Blood Power wing into a long rattan to tie one of its arms up while he attacked earlier.The demon turned his head 180 degrees and stared a deadly stare at Lin Huang with its bloody eyes under the pale mask. It then plunged towards Lin Huang. Just when Lin Huang was plunging forward, it lunged at him as well. Their distance was so close. Its six arms were turned into six different weapons and attacked Lin Huang like a thunderstorm.If Lin Huang was in his regular combat mode, he would definitely die under these attacks. However, now that he was transformed into a vampire that was the same with Bai, a mutated vampire, his combat level was also on iron-level rank-3, which was the same with this Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress. He was not afraid at all, his Blood Power wings were turned into a pair of sharp knives and collided with the demon\u2019s arms. Seeing that Bai was getting closer to Lin Huang, the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress seemed to give its all so that it could kill Lin Huang before Bai arrived. It then used its ultimate skill, the Thousand-Handed Soul-Reaper at Lin Huang. Its six arms were so fast that they seemed to turn into more than 10,000 arms attacking him.Lin Huang stopped attacking and started defending immediately and blocked all the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress\u2019s attacks. Within seconds, they collided more than 100 times. Bai finally arrived, his Blood Power wings were extended when he was 10 meters away and attacked towards the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress. It knew that it could not fight the both of them, it attempted to escape again.Just when the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress turned around, a crimson gold blade shone. It pierced through the back of its head and broke its mask. The Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress was motionless, its mask was breaking down and its body was fading away fast. Withdrawing his crimson gold blade, Lin Huang smirked, \u201cTry to escape from me?! I\u2019ve been defensive not because I couldn\u2019t kill you, but I was familiarizing the use of these Blood Power wings so that I could use my \u2018Great Sword Scripture\u2019 accurately.\u201dJust when Lin Huang was done talking, a white glow flowed out of the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress\u2019 head that was covered by its mask. Lin Huang was completely covered in the glow.\u201cYou are experiencing a Life Light Baptism, abort from transformation by force!\u201dXiao Hei\u2019s voice was heard and before Lin Huang could respond, he was withdrawn from his vampire transformation and turned into a human again.His body was showered in the white glow, there were changes to his Life Wheel.His Life Wheel that was made of gray stone was changing to a black metal one. Lin Huang knew that his Life Wheel was transforming into an iron-level Life Wheel. After it was turned into a black metal material, it shrunk into 1/3 of its original size and three circles of white columns were created. Each circle was the same with the Life Light columns, having 360 columns in each circle. However, it was not Life Light columns, but Life Power columns. If the inner circle was filled with Life Power, that would mean iron-level rank-1, the second circle would be iron-level rank-2 and the third circle would be iron-level rank-3. When all 1080 Life Power columns were filled, another round of Life Light Baptism would take place and he would be leveled-up to bronze-level.Lin Huang had researched about this countless times on the Heart Network.When the transformation of Life Wheel was done, the Life Light Baptism would end as well. Just when the Life Light Baptism was almost over, a black-gray colored bead that was the size of a thumb came out of the Six-Armed Demon\u2019s body and went into Lin Huang\u2019s body. It absorbed into his new iron-level Life Wheel.Lin Huang looked into his Life Wheel. Among the Life Wheel that was covered in a white glow and more than 10 cards, there was an additional black-gray colored bead in it.\u201cLife Seed has been detected, do you want to turn it into a card?\u201d Xiao Hei said.\u201cI can turn the Life Seed into a card?!\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cYou can directly turn it into a card without needing to add any materials.\u201d\u201cIf I turn it into a card and you escape from my body, does that mean that my Life Seed gifts would be gone?\u201d Lin Huang was obviously concerned.\u201cNo, Life Seeds are not really cards but they\u2019re an object instead. If I were to escape from your body, the Life Seed would turn back into its regular form.\u201dLin Huang was relieved after Xiao Hei\u2019s explanation, \u201cAlright, turn it into a card!\u201dSoon, Xiao Hei spoke again.\u201cIt has been done. A new card is added, Life Seed Card!\u201dLin Huang immediately looked at the Life Seed Card that he had just obtained. There was a fluffy gray-black ball on top of the card. He then turned the card around to read the detailed description.\u201cLife Seed Card\u201d\u201cLife Seed Name: Sly Hands\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cType: Synthetic\u201d\u201cTalent Effect 1: Finger agility +20% (Beginner)\u201d\u201cTalent Effect 2: Attack speed of both arms +20% (Beginner)\u201d\u201cTalent Effect 3: Flexibility of both arms +20% (Beginner)\u201d\u201cLevel-up Effect: With every upgrade, the three gifted effects would gain an additional 20% each\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: Passable\u201dLin Huang was shocked to see the gift card. He remembered clearly that the Sly Hands Life Seed would give an addition 10% only for beginner stage and each upgrade would also be an additional 10%. But now he was given a 20%. He thought about it and figured probably the Six-Armed Demon in the purple dress that he killed had a higher rarity. Therefore, the 20% talent effect was nothing out of the ordinary. However, he was still surprised at what he got.\u201cBeginner would get an additional 20% and if I am upgraded to gold-level, I would gain an additional 80% which means my speed would be twice as fast. This talent effect isn\u2019t bad at all!\u201d Lin Huang had finally achieved his mission to be leveled-up to iron-level. It was a bonus that he obtained a better Life Seed! He let out a gentle sigh, \u201cI am finally an iron-level!\u201dThinking of his characteristic changes, he tapped open his exclusive card to take a good look.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat strength: Iron-level rank-1\u201d\u201cLife Seed: Sly Hands (Rare)\u201cCombat Skill 1: Great Sword Scripture (Sword Skill)\u201d\u201cCombat Skill 2: Spectral Snowsteps (Body Movement)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 2: Robust (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 3: Powerful Strength (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 4: Magic Eye Deterrence (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 5: Absolute Defence (Beginner)\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 2\u201d\u201cRemark: Wow, you have finally been leveled-up to iron-level.\u201d\u201cFinally, my combat strength is no longer \u2018none\u2019 like it used to be\u2026\u201d Lin Huang took a closer look, \u201cThere\u2019s Life Seed added, combat skills and monster skills were separated. Now I can summon two monsters at once!\u201d He had got used to ignoring Xiao Hei\u2019s mean remarks. In conclusion, the journey into Wangyou Forest exceeded his expectation. Not only he was leveled-up to iron-level, the gift of the addition of his Life Seed was a pleasant surprise. Besides, he had also obtained an epic dragonkin summon card.\u201cNow I\u2019m wondering when Miss Leng and the rest will complete their mission.

Although he obtained a card piece for killing the Six-Armed Demon in purple dress earlier, he could not bear the sight of that monster. If he were to summon the monster on the street, people would be terrified.After a fairly decent distance from the Six-Armed Demon\u2019s territory, Lin Huang found an empty space in the forest and summoned the Undying Baby Dragon. It was a three-meter-long baby dragon and was pitch black. Its wings were about five meters wide when they were fully spread and there were horns on its head that were about 10 centimeters long. Its face was flat and round, looking nothing like the ferocious monster it was from the dragon family, more like an ugly monster that was quite adorable.It rubbed its head against Lin Huang when it saw him, almost causing Lin Huang to fall from its playful act. \u201cI did not expect you to have such great strength.\u201d Lin Huang smiled, shaking his head. He patted the baby dragon\u2019s head, \u201cSince you\u2019re black, I\u2019ll name you Charcoal.\u201d\u201cWith one more upgrade, Charcoal\u2019s rarity would be upgraded from Epic to Legendary. The concentration of dragon blood in its body would also be upgraded from beginner to intermediate.\u201d He then said, \u201cXiao Hei, I would like to use an Advance Card on Charcoal.\u201d\u201cYou do not have enough Advance Cards.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? I remember that I have one Advance Card.\u201d Lin Huang knew he had kept an Advance Card and had been waiting for the perfect time to utilize it.\u201cTo upgrade Normal Cards to Rare Cards, one Advance Card would suffice but from a Rare Card to an Epic Card, you require two Advance Cards. From an Epic Card to a Legendary Card, you would need three advance cards and from a Legendary Card to a Mythical Card, you would need five Advanced Cards. Lastly, to upgrade Mythical Cards to Godlike Cards, you would need 10 Advance Cards!\u201d Xiao Hei finally explained the rules of upgrading.Lin Huang was bummed. He only had one Advance Card at the moment and that card not enough, not even for Bai and the Sand Monster. He would be rewarded one Advance Card if he completed the mission and from then, he would still only have two Advance Cards!\u201cEven if you have accumulated enough Advance Cards, I don\u2019t suggest you upgrade your Undying Baby Dragon.\u201d Xiao Hei seemed to know what Lin Huang was thinking about.\u201cWhy?\u201d Lin Huang asked, confused.\u201cYou do not meet the required qualification. The Monster Cards that you\u2019re able to master at the moment are limited to cards that are Epic and below. Monster cards that are Epic and above are temporarily sealed and can only be unsealed when you are a transcendent.\u201dHearing Xiao Hei\u2019s explanation, Lin Huang had to give up on his wishes of upgrading Charcoal. In reality, Lin Huang knew very well that even if Charcoal was not upgraded, its ability combined with Bai was sufficient for him to handle the risks at the borders of Wangyou Forest. If Charcoal was not restricted by Lin Huang\u2019s combat level, such dragonkin types were usually stronger than a common transcendent at birth. Bai, on the other hand, was a mutated vampire at bronze-level rank-3 since the very beginning.Since Lin Huang was leveled-up to iron-level, Bai and Charcoal\u2019s combat strength was automatically upgraded to bronze-level rank-1. Lin Huang was fearless for what danger may lurk the border of Wangyou Forest because he felt safe with Bai and Charcoal. He trusted their strengths.In the two days since he leveled-up to iron-level, Lin Huang has killed plenty of iron-level monsters with Bai and Charcoal\u2019s help. When the first 360 columns in the first layer of his Life Power circle for his Life Wheel was almost full, he got Xiao Hei to disconnect his Life Wheel.He did that because he was concerned that Li Yanxing and the rest would figure out what he was able to do. After all, he was in Wangyou Forest to level to iron-level. If they found out that he managed to level-up from an ordinary person to iron-level rank-3, Li Yanxing and the rest would know that he had the ability to accumulate Life Power quickly.Under normal circumstances, earning Life Power required the practice of Life Skill. By absorbing Life Crystals using Life Skill or the Life Light in Life Crystals and to convert them into Life Power. There were different grades of Life Skill depending on the conversion rate of Life Power.A Life Power conversion rate between 30% to 40% would be considered as a Beginner Life Skill.A Life Power conversion rate between 40% to 50% would be considered as an Intermediate Life Skill.A Life Power conversion rate between 50% to 60% would be considered as an Expert Life Skill.A Life Power conversion rate between 60% to 70% would be\u00a0considered as the Ultimate Life Skill.A Life Power conversion rate that surpassed 70% would be considered as Holy Life Skill.\u00a0Lin Huang had never heard about any that surpassed 80%.An\u00a0iron-level\u2019s Life Power was 10 times concentrated than Life Power. A hundred years worth of Life Crystal could only fill 10 columns of Life Power even though the conversion rate was 100%. Aside from the Ultimate and Holy Life Skill, most of the Life Skills had a conversion rate of 30% to 60%. That said, a Life Crystal that was worth a hundred years could only fill three to six columns of Life Power.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, even with sufficient Life Crystals, the level-up from iron-level rank-1 to iron-level rank-2 could not be done within a couple of days as it would take a large amount of time for Life Skill to convert Life Light into Life Power. With sufficient Life Crystals, it would usually take around two hours to convert one Life Power. Time spent on eating and sleeping aside, it would be good if a person could convert seven or eight Life Power a day. 360 columns of Life Power would take at least more than a month for the conversion to complete itself.Of course, some people with unique body physiques would have a faster conversion rate which would result in a shorter conversion time. As for Lin Huang, the cycle was shorter. Whenever Bai and Charcoal killed monsters, they would absorb Life Light which would be converted into Life Power immediately and sent to Lin Huang\u2019s Life Wheel. As long as Bai and Charcoal killed sufficient monsters, Lin Huang could easily level up to iron-level rank-3 without needing to do anything.Considering that he would need to be with Li Yanxing and the rest during the return trip, Lin Huang had to maintain his level at iron-level rank-1 so that they wouldn\u2019t find out. After disconnecting his Life Wheel, Lin Huang brought Charcoal and Bai to the borders of the forest to fight bronze-level monsters.Since Lin Huang was leveled-up to iron-level, he could use his Life Power and had more combat skills now. Aside from the Blood Power wings, he had a couple of weapon rings on his fingers. A black armor, a sword, and a BlackEagle33 gun. The BlackEagle33 gun was especially useful \u2013 it can morph between a rifle and a pistol. It was no less powerful than a bronze equipment. It could easily kill a bronze-level monster when it was in the form of a rifle.He used to be very careful wherever he was because of abrupt monster attacks but now, he feared nothing in the forests. He had only one goal at the border of Wangyou Forest \u2013 accumulate as many card pieces as he could.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A smirking young man who looked to be 15 or 16 rode on the back of the Dragon. He looked at the pack of Viridian Wolves that was running for their lives, seemingly unable to defend themselves in any way. Running on the ground was a young man with a pair of crimson wings in the shape of blades chasing after the wolves as well.The dragon in the air was the Undying Baby Dragon, Charcoal that Lin Huang had just obtained not too long ago. It was Lin Huang who was riding on the back of the dragon and the young man on the ground was his partner, Bai. They were chasing after this group of Viridian Wolves as Lin Huang wanted a cool ride. Their bodies were muscular and they had fantastic muscles. Such monsters were in high demand.Within 20 minutes, more than 30 Viridian Wolves were killed by Bai and Charcoal. Lin Huang combined the 30 card pieces into a complete Monster Card and took a look at it.\u201cMonster Card\u201d\u201cRarity: Normal\u201d\u201cMonster Name: Viridian Wolf\u201d\u201cType of Monster: Mutated monster\u201d\u201cCombat Level: Bronze-level 1 Star\u201d\u201cSkill 1: Robust (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cSkill 2: Blood Hunt (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSummoning Limit: Activated\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: Useless\u201d\u201d\u00a0Blood hunt?\u00a0This seems like a tracking skill.\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s eyes lit up, he then read the skill description.\u201d\u00a0Blood hunt (Beginner):\u00a0After the skill is activated, the monster will obtain an enhanced ability to smell, allowing it to differentiate different odors within a 10-kilometer range. The monster will be extra sensitive to blood. In the presence of blood, the range of its ability would be enhanced and cover a distance of up to 30 kilometers.\u201d\u201cXiao Hei, extract card skill!\u201dLin Huang was excited about the extraction. A single monster could only go through one extraction. If he extracted\u00a0\u00a0Robust\u00a0, his existing skill would be upgraded and if he extracted\u00a0\u00a0Blood Hunt\u00a0, he would obtain a tracking skill.

It would also help him in surviving in the wild in the future. Lin Huang kept the card and brought Charcoal and Bai to his next destination.\u2026Time passed and Lin Huang had been in Wangyou Forest for seven days but had yet to receive a message from Leng Yuexin. If he did not know her himself, he would think that Li Yanxing and the rest ditched him here on purpose. Fortunately, Lin Huang was different from who he was a few days ago. With Bai and Charcoal, he was unstoppable.Within the few days since he leveled-up to iron-level, he got busy killing various monsters at the border of Wangyou Forest. Within five days, he had already managed to collect more than 3,000 bronze-level card pieces and combined three Monster Cards. He even obtained a complete Rare Monster Card from killing a monster. During this time, he used three Double Cards during crucial times and obtained double rewards from 10 cross-ranking kills, giving him 20 Function Cards. The only bummer was that the Rare Monster Card only dropped after he finished all his Double Cards.It was the seventh day Lin Huang had stayed in the forest. Seeing that the sun was setting, he set up a tent in an empty plot. After that, he started a fire nearby and took out the meat slices that he prepared a\u00a0few days back for a barbecue. He sat next to the fire with his legs crossed and he watched as the meat slices cooked on the grill as he relaxed with a drink in his hand. He had just bought the grill a\u00a0few days back. Ever since he saw Fatty\u2019s complete set of kitchen tools, Lin Huang began thinking about taking good care of himself, even in the wild. It was ridiculous if he had to survive on snacks every single day so he got himself simple kitchen equipment and the grill was one of them.The sky was getting dark as the meat slices on the grill turned a golden brown, smelling incredible. While he flipped the meat slices over on the other side on the grill, Lin Huang said to Xiao Hei, \u201cXiao Hei, please do an inventory of all the cards I have now.\u201d\u201cYou have Function Card x25, Concrete Cards \u2013 Advance Card x3, Provisional Transformation Card x5, Mission Card x3, Treasure Card x3, Life Power Storage Card x2, Prop Card x3, Limitless Card x1, Flawless Card x2, Healing Card x3.\u201d\u201cMonster Card x9 \u2013 Charcoal (Epic), Bai (Rare), Tyrant (Rare),\u00a0Alexandrian Eagle (Rare), Ox Demon, Lion-Headed Troll, Viridian Wolf, Demonic One-Eyed Ape, Spectre\u201d\u201cCard pieces \u2013 Iron-level pieces x1027, Bronze-level pieces x3051\u201d\u201cTake a look at my Exclusive Card.\u201d Lin Huang instructed.His Exclusive Card popped up immediately.\u201cHost: Lin Huang\u201d\u201cGender: Male\u201d\u201cAge: 15\u201d\u201cCombat Strength: Iron-level rank-1\u201d\u201cLife Seed: Sly Hands (Rare)\u201cCombat Skill 1: Great Sword Scripture (Sword Skill)\u201d\u201cCombat Skill 2: Spectral Snowsteps (Body Movement)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 1: Blood Power (Level-2)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 2: Robust (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 3: Immense Strength (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 4: Magic Eye Deterrence (Intermediate)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 5: Absolute Defence (Beginner)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 6: Blood Hunt (Beginner)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 7: Boundless Vision (Beginner)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 8: Third Eye (Beginner)\u201d\u201cMonster Skill 9: Supreme Breath (Beginner)\u201d\u201cSummon Authority: Activated\u201d\u201cAvailable Number of Summons: 2\u201d\u201cRemark: Still wandering in iron-level?\u201dThe additional four skills were extracted within these few days.\u00a0Blood Hunt\u00a0was obtained from the Viridian Wolves,\u00a0Boundless Vision\u00a0was obtained from the Alexandrian Eagle,\u00a0Third Eye\u00a0from the Demonic One-Eyed Ape and\u00a0Supreme Breath\u00a0\u00a0from Spectre.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang was familiar with the new skills but he did not use them often.

Do you want me to die that badly?!\u201d Lin Huang shouted. He did not expect to get such a difficult mission. It was basically suicide after having enjoyed himself for the past few days.\u201cXiao Hei, don\u2019t you feel uneasy? What does your conscience say?!\u201d he asked Goldfinger.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have a conscience,\u201d it replied, unphased by his panic.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Huang did not know what to say. He then said loudly, \u201cI decline this mission!\u201d\u201cYou cannot decline, you can only surrender.

Even if he did not have Charcoal, his Epic dragonkin card, he would not want to go into the Wangyou Forest. However, if he was to give up the mission, the price he had to pay would be too high as there was a 20% chance he would lose Charcoal. As long as he had cards like Bai and Tyrant he would be alright as they were Rare cards that could be easily cultivated and only needed one Advance Card to upgrade them. As for Charcoal, not only was it an Epic Card, it was a dragonkin. With his terrible luck in gambling, if he was to lose this card, he had no idea if he\u2019d ever get such a card again.\u201cXiao Hei, can I return the pending Mission Cards that I have? If returning them is not allowed, it should be okay for me to trade them with other cards right?\u201d Lin Huang was now afraid of Mission Cards.\u201cNo returns are allowed for all cards produced!\u201d Xiao Hei replied.\u201cHow about I throw them away? Maybe, you can crush them into card pieces for me?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cAll cards are bonded to you. Once these cards are a certain distance away from you, they\u2019ll be teleported back to you.

He then looked at the Mission Card and was shocked to find out that he was only left with two Mission Cards. Based on Xiao Hei\u2019s calculations earlier, there should be three of them. Now one was activated and another had yet to be activated.\u201cWhat happened to my Mission Card? I seem to remember having one that was activated and two that are inactive.\u201d Lin Huang mumbled.\u201cWhenever there are changes to the mission, it will consume one unactivated Mission Card. After the changes happen, you\u2019ll receive double rewards if you complete the mission and the penalty would be doubled if you fail.\u201dXiao Hei explained immediately.\u201cLuckily I still have one Mission Card. After this mission has needed, I\u2019ll activate the remaining Mission Card once I am back in the foothold.\u201d Lin Huang made his decision.He then took out the active Mission Card and read the description.There was a flirtatious blonde lady in a black maid attire on the golden Mission Card.\u201cCongratulations, there are changes to your Mission Card due to unforeseen circumstances!\u201d\u201cNow, let me announce your new mission!\u201d\u201cDetails of the new mission as follows: Venture deep into the Wangyou Forest. Look for the missing Leng Yuexin and bring her back to Carefree City! Mission time limit: 20 days.\u201d\u201cMission Completion Reward: Prop Card (relic) x1, Advance Card x1.\u201d\u201cIf you fail to complete the\u00a0mission within the given time frame, you\u2019ll be penalized: Two existing Monster Cards will be taken away at random!\u201d\u201cMission announcement complete. Mission details such as the mission map can be found behind the card.\u201dAfter completing the announcement, the blonde lady became motionless once more.\u201cThere\u2019s a Mission Map?\u201d Lin Huang was just thinking how he would find Leng Yuexin in the vast Wangyou Forest until he heard the part of the mission announcement from the blonde lady.He turned the card around and tapped on it and a three-dimensional map appeared before him.There were two coordinates on the map. He was the white spot and the yellow spot had a description \u2013 Leng Yuexin\u2019s last seen location before she went missing.There were several coordinates with question marks that had the following description \u2013 Areas Leng Yuexin has been before\u2019.\u201cCan you show me the location of Li Yanxing and the rest?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cInvalid. Not mission target, coordinate request denied.\u201dLin Huang frowned, \u201cHow about showing the time Leng Yuexin last appeared on the marked locations chronologically?\u201dThe question marks then turned into the numbers \u20181\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u20183\u2019 and \u20184\u2019.Looking at the last coordinates she was last seen at, Lin Huang confirmed that Leng Yuexin and the rest were looking for something.\u201cMark the distance between us and map a path to the coordinates.\u201dSoon, a red arrow appeared on the map.\u201cOh my god. It\u2019s 300 kilometers away\u2026\u201d Lin Huang frowned again.He looked at the three-dimensional map that appeared from the Mission Card for a while before noticing the roasted meat slices on his plate that was getting cold.He then kept the Mission Card and heated the sliced meat once again. He proceeded with his dinner. While he thought about the mission he just received, he ate his dinner slowly. When he was done with dinner, it was already eight o\u2019clock at night and was completely dark outside. After cleaning up, Lin Huang summoned the Viridian Wolf and Specter to stand watch for the night while he went into his tent. Lying in the tent, he did not sleep but instead, studied the map on the Heart Network, comparing it with the one he saw on the Mission Card. At the same time, he browsed news articles that were related to Wangyou Forest to see if there was anything more he could learn about it.He then sent Yi Yeyu a message at 11 o\u2019clock at night, \u201cAre you asleep?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Yi Yeyu replied almost immediately.\u201cNothing much, I just have something to ask you,\u201d Lin Huang replied her message.\u201cHaha, you must\u2019ve failed to level up to iron-level, am I right?! I told you not to go after the Six-Armed Demon for you Life Seed, but you wouldn\u2019t listen!\u201d Yi Yeyu sent back a wall of text with a mocking emoji at the end.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, I have successfully leveled-up. I need to ask you something else,\u201d Lin Huang replied. After he obtained the Life Seed \u2013 Sly Hands, he realized that his typing speed had improved.\u201cYeah right. Go on, continue with your made-up story,\u201d Yi Yeyu left an uninterested emoji after her reply.\u201cI want to know if anything happened in Wangyou Forest recently?\u201d Lin Huang finally got the chance to ask his question, side-stepping her ego provoking replies. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything on the Heart Network and Hunter Network. You\u2019re a Gold Hunter, you must have more access in terms of information so I thought I\u2019d ask you,\u201d he continued.\u201cLet me take a look,\u201d she replied. After Yi Yeyu sent that message, she requested for a video call shortly after.Lin Huang hesitated and accepted the video call. In the video, Yi Yeyu was seen sitting on a luxurious couch with a red drink in her hand. Seeing the environment Lin Huang was in, she was stunned. \u201cAre you in the wild?\u201d she asked.\u201cI\u2019m still in Wangyou Forest,\u201d Lin Huang nodded and smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re in a tent inside the level-4 Wangyou Forest? Are you crazy?!\u201d Yi Yeyu did not expect Lin Huang to have the audacity to do something so foolish.\u201cI\u2019m only at the border, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Lin Huang said with a smile.\u201cI think you should get out of the Wangyou Forest as soon as possible. It\u2019s not safe now. I\u2019ve checked about the thing you asked me earlier, but I didn\u2019t get much information. I didn\u2019t think I had much access anyway so I got my brother to check it out as well. There was an unconfirmed report..\u201d Yi Yeyu trailed off, and her tone of voice became serious.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Lin Huang frowned, he could sense that the news must be bad.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe monitoring bureau recently discovered that there was an unusual shockwave coming from the center of Wangyou Forest. It could be a monster that is in the midst of leveling up into a transcendent. From the intensity of the wave, the monster is at least a mutated monster or could even a monster that had gone through a double mutation! No matter how accurate the information is, you best leave Wangyou Forest now. Don\u2019t stay there even if you fail to level up to iron-level.\u201d Yi Yeyu told Lin Huang the news that Yi Zheng had discovered.\u201cOkay, I understand,\u201d Lin Huang nodded. \u201cThank you, beautiful. I need to wake up early tomorrow, I\u2019m hanging up now.\u201dHe waved to Yi Yeyu who was in the video and hung up the phone straight away.\u201cHow dare he hang up my call?!\u201d Yi Yeyu scream when she realized Lin Huang hung up her phone as the screen turned black.Lin Huang did not think much about the matter. The reason he did not look for Yi Zheng was that\u00a0he always thought Yi Zheng would ignore calls 90% of the time if the caller ID showed a male caller or rather\u2026 That\u2019s what Lin Huang would do. That was why he decided to call Yi Yeyu instead. Yi Yeyu was pissed because she did not expect Lin Huang to hang up right after he got what he wanted. After the call, Lin Huang looked into the incidents that involved unusual shockwaves on the Heart network but he found nothing. Since it was quite late, he decided to sleep\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun was shining through to the leaves on the ground and the drops of morning dew could be seen on the leaves, colorful from the refraction of light. Whiffs of a fresh green fragrance were sent by the wind into Lin Huang\u2019s tent. He was awake early that day and he had a good night sleep all through the night. Although he had Leng Yuexin\u2019s news on his mind, he did not worry about it as that would have been unnecessary.He had breakfast and departed after dismantling his tent and packed it away. He chose Bai and the Viridian Wolf as his companions this time. If he summoned Charcoal, monsters that were below silver-level would run away from him but gold-level monsters might consider it a challenge. Moreover, there was a possibility that there was a transcendent monster in the forest. Lin Huang was mistaken as god\u2019s descendant the last time and that had attracted a transcendent monster. If Charcoal, his dragonkin monster was discovered by the transcendent, he could not imagine what kind of trouble that would bring him.Moreover, flying above the Wangyou Forest would make him an easy target for an attack by powerful monsters as there would be no trees around. Although it would have been a different story with the Viridian Wolf. Its keen nose gave it a useful advantage against any lurking dangers as it could detect enemies from a distance. With its speed, the 300 kilometers to the coordinates where Leng Yuexin was last seen would only take the beast a mere two hours run.Lin Huang and Bai rode on the back of Viridian Wolf. They made stops in between to rest up so in case a monster attacked them midway, they\u2019d all still have the energy to fight even after the long journey. Whenever the Viridian Wolf caught the scent of a nearby strong monster, it would deviate to another route and continue. When it was close to noon, they finally arrived at the first coordinate where Leng Yuexin was last seen.Lin Huang then activated\u00a0\u00a0Blood Hunt\u00a0\u00a0and caught the scent of Leng Yuexin and Li Yanxing. He followed the odor and arrived in front of a giant rock. It was a black rock that was 10 meters high, and a small part of it was buried in the ground while the top was showing. The smell was strongest near the giant rock so Lin Huang was sure that they made a stop at the giant rock or at least touched it as they traveled.He walked around the rock but he could not find anything. However, it was absurd for such a huge rock to be lying there in the middle of Wangyou Forest. If it was a meteorite, there should have been craters around it, but the terrain was flat and undisturbed. With a few doubts in mind, Lin Huang browsed through the Heart Network for anything that mentioned a giant rock in the forest. Surprisingly, there was quite a lot of information about it and it was once a hot topic in Division7. How the topic of this black giant rock became popular was peculiar as it all started when many claimed that no one could move the rock. People saw the thread on the network and tried to move the rock but even a Gold Hunter who was among the top 10 on the leaderboard tried his best to no avail. The rock remained firmly planted in its position. That was why it became one of the hot topics for quite some time in Division7 as many were guessing the origins of the rock itself. Many of them thought it was a meteorite while others thought it was moved there by a transcendent out of boredom. There were even some that said it was a seal for the back luck of the city buried beneath it\u2026After browsing through the many speculated theories of the topic, he realized that it was totally unrelated to the transcendent monster. He turned off the network and looked around the place again. He could not find anything and left. 10 minutes later, Lin Huang and Bai found the second spot where Leng Yuexin was last seen. He activated\u00a0Blood Hunt\u00a0again and found the exact location where Leng Yuexin and the rest had been.It was scorched ground \u2013 dead earth with cracks that looked like spiderwebs that spread as far as 10 kilometers. The burnt soil bulged around the cracks, seemingly cracking from the inside out. Lin Huang found a crack that was as wide as a palm and tossed a stone in to find out how deep it was. He did not hear any sound to confirm if the stone had touched the ground so he was not able to tell how deep it was. He browsed the Heart Network again but there was nothing about it.\u201cIt seems like these cracks just appeared recently\u2026\u201d Lin Huang took a couple of photos of the cracks, looked around the area and left. Within half an hour, he found the third and fourth coordinates where Leng Yuexin and the rest were last seen and both had the similar strange cracks like the second location. Aside from that, he did not discover anything else. He took some photos once again and left. This time, he headed to the last location Leng Yuexin was seen at before she went missing.Within 20 minutes, the Viridian Wolf brought Lin Huang and Bai to the final destination. They got off the Viridian Wolf\u2019s back and Lin Huang activatedBlood Hunt\u00a0again. Following the scent he was familiar with, he found the exact coordinates where Leng Yuexin had last been. The Mission Card showed that the coordinates were 300 kilometers to the north and Lin Huang found the location easily. It was a giant waterfall with a giant pool beneath the waterfall. Leng Yuexin and Li Yanxing\u2019s scent completely disappeared around the waterfall.\u201cThere must be something here. Perhaps there\u2019s a cave behind this waterfall?\u201d Lin Huang thought and frowned as he looked around the waterfall but there did not seem to be anything unusual.He then recalled the Viridian Wolf and summoned the Specter. As it was a spirit, it was similar like the crows he saw previously, lacking a physical form so it was able to pass through objects.\u201cSpecter, see what\u2019s behind the waterfall,\u201d Lin Huang instructed the Specter. The black phantom floated on top of the lake and disappeared into the waterfall. Soon, it came out from the waterfall.\u201cIs there a cave or cavern that connects to another location?\u201d Lin Huang asked.The Specter shook its head.\u201cNo cave?\u201d Lin Huang was skeptical. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s anything else nearby\u2026\u201dLin Huang then looked at the quiet pool and thought, \u201cCould it be under this pool?\u201d\u201cSpecter, go underwater to see if there\u2019s an underground cave beneath the pool!\u201d Lin Huang gave his instruction immediately.The Specter dived into the water without making a single ripple on the surface.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang sat by the pool and anxiously waited for the results. If there was no clue under the pool, he would have no idea how he would find Leng Yuexin at all.It took more than half an hour this time. If it was not for Xiao Hei who would notify him if the Specter was dead, he would have thought that it had been killed by an underwater beast. 40 minutes in, the Specter finally emerged from the pool.\u201cIs there an underwater cave?\u201d Lin Huang asked immediately.The Specter nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Lin Huang concluded that Leng Yuexin and the rest had dove down under the pool and prepared himself for the descent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the Specter needed more than 40 minutes to get to the bottom of the pool, that meant the pool was deep. Although he got a diving suit from Xue Jie during the Reserve Hunter assessment, he was not sure if he could dive that deep even with the suit. Furthermore, there was no way for him to breathe underwater. With his iron-level rank-1 body, the air pressure at such great depths could be an issue for him.After much thought, Lin Huang came up with a plan. He would use a Provisional Transformation Card to transform himself into the Specter. As long as he was in spirit form, he could pass through things and even dive deep into the water without a worry.\u201cI still have five Provisional Transformation Cards, each card will allow me the ability to transform for an entire day. Even if this takes more than a day, the most I\u2019d use up would only be two cards,\u201d he thought. After figuring out how many Provisional Transformation cards he needed, he took out one of them.\u201cTransform into the Specter,\u201d Lin Huang confirmed the monster that he was transforming into and crushed the card. After the card was crushed, it turned into a white glow that enveloped his body. Soon there were changes to his body. Within seconds, he became grayish black, translucent cloud. He looked exactly the same as the Specter. He recalled Bai and instructed the Specter, \u201cLead the way, I\u2019ll follow you into the water.\u201dthe Specter floated slowly to the middle of the pool and dove in the water. Lin Huang hesitated for a moment, but then followed suit. Although he knew that the form he was currently transformed into would not be affected by water, it was still uncomfortable for him. After successfully diving into the water, Lin Huang did not feel any pressure at all. He could only sense that the temperature around him was dropping. As he followed the Specter into the pool, there were no obstacles before them. It felt the same as when he was floating into the air. He also realized that in this form, breathing was unnecessary and he had no heartbeat. As he dove deeper, he began getting the hang of his new body.More than 10 minutes later, Lin Huang arrived at the bottom of the pool with the guidance of the Specter. He noticed that the size of the pool was much bigger than the one he saw from above. the Specter then pointed in a direction and led the way for Lin Huang. Following the Specter, Lin Huang saw a slope towards an underground cave after about six minutes. Undercurrents were flowing into the cave.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d Lin Huang instructed the Specter. It dived into the cave and Lin Huang followed.The underground cave was long and narrow. Lin Huang followed the Specter for almost half an hour before they arrived at the other side of the cave. Coming out on the other side, he realized that they were at an underground river. He got out at the water and into an underground world. There was dry land next to the river with countless stalactites above, hanging almost 10 meters from the ground. There were so many caves around the place and Lin Huang had no idea which way he should go.Lin Huang got out of the water. He then recalled the Specter and summoned Bai. Bai could attack at the longest distance and he was the second strongest among Lin Huang\u2019s monsters right after Charcoal. Moreover, his size was perfect for the mission. Although he knew that the river water had washed away most of the scent for Leng Yuexin and the rest, Lin Huang decided to activate anyway. He wanted to see if he could find even the slightest clue with it, which was better than nothing.Lin Huang did not catch their scent after was activated, but he caught a whiff on the intense iron-like scent of blood in the air. Aside from blood, he caught the scent of an unfamiliar odor that was similar to a plant but was very unpleasant. Although his expression could not be seen as he was transformed into the Specter, Lin Huang was frowning. The pungent smell made him uncomfortable.He hesitated for a while and decided to look for the source of the bloody smell to get to the bottom of the mystery. That was the one and only clue that might lead him to Leng Yuexin.\u201cHere\u2026\u201d Lin Huang pointed towards the direction of the smell. Bai nodded and led the way while Lin Huang followed behind him. In the complicated underground cave, Lin Huang and Bai made many turns as they followed the scent. Almost an hour later, they finally arrived near their destination.\u201cSlow down, be careful,\u201d Lin Huang said to Bai. Bai then slowed down after he heard Lin Huang\u2019s instructions. 10 minutes later, he saw a light after a turning. He peered around at the light source. It was a massive cave that was nearly 100 meters high. In the middle of the cave, there was a light blue semi-transparent monster that floated in the\u00a0air. The light was coming from the monster\u2019s body. This monster looked like a deep-sea jellyfish from Earth. To be exact, it was more like a deformed deep-sea jellyfish. Not only was it many times bigger, there were countless eyeballs of different color on its body. Some were closed while some were opened. Those that were closed were filled with spots of various colors. Its tentacles were swaying in the air like the flowing dress of a lady during the summer festival.Lin Huang recognized it as the transcendent monster immediately as the aura coming off the monster was even stronger than the black python that he encountered earlier. The unpleasant scent that he caught from\u00a0Blood Hunt\u00a0\u00a0was coming from this monster together with the smell of blood. Lin Huang then activated\u00a0Boundless Vision\u00a0\u00a0and looked around the transcendent monster. Aside from blood on the ground, he did not see Leng Yuexin and the rest.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCould they have been eaten by the monster?\u201d Just when Lin Huang was thinking, the transcendent monster seemed to sense a disturbance. Its light blue tentacles darted towards the cave entrance where Lin Huang was located at the speed of light. Lin Huang recalled Bai immediately and flattened himself against the wall. The light blue tentacles seemed to detect Lin Huang even though he went through the cave walls. It looked around the cave and retracted its tentacles. Since it did not find anything at all, the transcendent monster thought it was being too sensitive to its surroundings.Lin Huang was drenched in cold sweat. If he was a second too late, he would have been crushed to death by the monster. The attack of transcendent monsters worked on spirit-type monsters. He did not dare look in the monster\u2019s direction anymore.\u201cLeng Yuexin and the rest should still be alive, if they were dead, Xiao Hei would definitely notify me that I failed the mission. The blood on the ground could possibly be theirs as they might have been hurt as they entered the underwater cavern. There were only two possibilities, they might be hidden by the monster somewhere else or they may have already escaped\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cBut if they\u2019ve managed to escape, the description on the mission card would not ask me to look for Leng Yuexin and bring her back to Carefree City. The description was clear \u2013 Leng Yuexin was in some kind of trouble, so the first possibility was more likely. However, there\u2019s another possibility where they may have managed to escape the battle but were badly injured so they were unable to leave Wangyou Forest\u2026\u201dLin Huang analyzed the situation and came up with the two most likely scenarios.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its body occupied a third the space within the cave and its long tentacles swayed mid-air, looking relaxed, waving gently to no apparent breeze. The blue light emited from its body lit up the entire cave. Behind the wall, at a corner of the cave, Lin Huang was hiding in his spectral form, planning his next move.\u201cNow, the only clue I have is the blood on the ground. Although I can\u2019t confirm if it belongs to Leng Yuexin and the rest, there are no other options left,\u201d Lin Huang thought to himself before investigating the only clue he had.He passed through several layers of granite through the wall to a corridor. He then activated\u00a0Blood Hunt\u00a0to look for any traces of the scent of blood that remained in the air. Before this investigation, he was worried that he would not get any results at all as hunters would usually take care of their wounds whenever they were injured to prevent monsters from tracking them down. Many monsters were sensitive to the smell of blood. If Leng Yuexin and the rest had already taken care of their wounds, then the scent should have been weak.However, Lin Huang was lucky as he managed to catch a whiff of the remaining scent of blood in the air. The scent was far from where the transcendent monster was at. Lin Huang was relieved when he found out and headed towards the direction immediately.Along the way, he noticed that there were bloodstains on the ground. It seemed like the person was clumsy when they ran, not having enough time to cover up their trails.Following the scent, Lin Huang walked along the corridors for more than an hour. He then found a dead body. The dead body was leaning on the wall of the corridor, completely burnt to a crisp. Lin Huang recognized that the corpse as the young man in the\u00a0hat that was with Leng Yuexin. From his dead body, it seemed like he was burned with a hot flame but Lin Huang could not detect any burnt odor. The smell coming\u00a0from the corpse was the pungent, unpleasant smell of poison. There was a wound on his waist which seemed like he was slashed with something sharp.\u201cThere\u2019s a high possibility that the wound was caused by the transcendent monster\u2019s tentacles which released poison\u00a0powerful enough to burn him to a crisp. If Leng Yuexin and the rest were injured, they may be poisoned in a similar way\u2026\u201d he thought. Seeing the dead body, Lin Huang knew that if Leng Yuexin was poisoned, she would not have long to live. He had to find her as soon as possible or his mission would fail once she was dead.Time passed quickly. Half an hour later, Lin Huang finally found Leng Yuexin lying by the underground river. He panicked when he saw her but since there was no notification from Xiao Hei, he was relieved as that meant Leng Yuexin was still alive. Lin Huang then walked to the riverside and saw Leng Yuexin\u2019s\u00a0face. Her face and most of the skin on her hands were black. Only half of her fingers remained unharmed. She was unconscious when Lin Huang approached her. If she remained in this condition, she would die very soon.\u201cShe made it to the underground river. As long as she followed the river\u00a0against the flow, she would have been able to make it to the entrance. It shouldn\u2019t have been a problem for her to swim her way out of this place,\u201d Lin Huang concluded. However, Lin Huang did not see Li Yanxing and the rest. He guessed that they were either eaten by the monster or they had escaped.\u201cXiao Hei, can my Healing Card act as the antidote to this poison?\u201d Lin Huang looked at the cards that he had and hoped the Healing Card might help.\u201cThe Healing Card can cure all diseases, including poison victims,\u201d Xiao Hei replied.\u201cThat\u2019s great, use one Healing Card on her,\u201d he instructed. Although it was a waste that Lin Huang had to use his card on her, he had to. If he did not do that, he would lose two Monster Cards.\u201cAre you sure you want to use your Healing Card on somebody else?\u201d\u201cConfirmed!\u201d Lin Huang nodded.\u201cPlease identify the user.\u201d\u201cLeng Yuexin,\u201d Lin Huang pointed at Leng Yuexin.\u201cOne Healing Card has been used, healing in progress\u2026\u201dAs Xiao Hei\u2019s notification popped up, a white glow shot out of Lin Huang into Leng Yuexin\u2019s body. Soon, there was a dim white glow enveloping her body. Lin Huang stood aside and mumbled to himself, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to find you here and now I\u2019ve to use my Healing Card on you. You don\u2019t need to repay me but I would appreciate it if you bring me back to Carefree City and help me complete my mission.\u201dSeeing the black fade from Leng Yuexin\u2019s face, Lin Huang did not want to stay at his present location. He hid behind the wall not far away while he waited for Leng Yuexin to wake up from her knocked-out state. Soon, the poison in Leng Yuexin\u2019s body was completely cleared and she woke up, dazed from the sights around her.\u201cEh?\u201d Leng Yuexin opened her eyes and sat up in confusion. She looked at her arms that were not black anymore and looked at her reflection in the water, her face was normal again.\u201cWhat happened? I thought I was poisoned?\u201d Leng Yuexin frowned, she seemed to be contemplating on ways the poison in her body could have faded on its own. Lin Huang who was hiding was worried. Fortunately, Leng Yuexin did not dwell upon it. She quickly stood up and patted the soil from her body away and ran against the river\u2019s flow. Lin Huang held his breath while he followed behind her, passing through wall after wall.When they were near the entrance, Leng Yuexin suddenly stopped. Lin Huang saw there was a person lying on the ground not far away, and from the attire, it seemed like Li Yanxing.\u201cBrother Li!\u201d Leng Yuexin shouted and ran towards him. Lin Huang frowned as he did not like Li Yanxing. He left the monster\u2019s carcass for him earlier and attempted to kill him. To him, this guy was someone that was always up to no good. However, since Li Yanxing managed to make it here, he was not as heavily poisoned as Leng Yuexin was.As expected, Li Yanxing was still conscious. Seeing Leng Yuexin coming towards him, he shouted to her immediately, \u201cSave me\u2026\u201dAlthough his voice was weak, he still managed to stay awake.\u201cBrother Li, I will carry you out of this place!\u201d Leng Yuexin attempted to carry him.\u201cI don\u2019t have much time\u2026 I need the antidote\u2026\u201d Noticing that the poison in Leng Yuexin\u2019s body had faded, Li Yanxing thought she had the antidote so he asked her for it.\u201cI don\u2019t have the antidote, I have no idea how I was cured,\u201d Leng Yuexin told him. She did not know how to explain.\u201cThen\u2026 Help me replace my blood\u2026 In my current condition, I\u2019d never make it to the ground above\u2026\u201d Li Yanxing begged.\u201cBlood replacement\u2026\u201d Leng Yuexin hesitated. She did not want Li Yanxing to die here so she agreed to do it.Lin Huang who was watching from a distance was frowning. He knew what a blood replacement was. It meant Li Yanxing would release the poisonous blood in his body and needed somebody else to replace a part of the lost blood. This would usually happen between family and close friends but not others. For Li Yanxing to ask for such favor, he was totally crossing the line. Li Yanxing knew Leng Yuexin very well and knew well that she would not say no, that was why he dared to request such a favor.\u201cPlease help me\u2026\u201d Li Yanxing said to Leng Yuexin.\u201cOkay,\u201d Leng Yuexin nodded. A dagger appeared on her palm and she cut open the artery along his wrist. The black, poisonous blood flowed out fast along with an unpleasant stench. Leng Yuexin then cut open the artery in her wrist and fresh blood spouted out of the wound.She then performed a hand seal and a moment later, her blood was like a thick thread connected to the wound on Li Yanxing\u2019s wrist. Leng Yuexin\u2019s blood was being transferred into him and his black blood stopped flowing.\u201cWhy would Li Yanxing request something like this? This is just a temporary solution, the poison in his body would only be diluted but not completely cleared. Even if he manages to get out of this cave, he would only live for another couple of hours. There\u2019s no way that he would be able to get to Carefree City in time, unless\u2026\u201d Lin Huang knew the reason for the blood replacement. \u201cUnless he cleared out all the poisonous blood in his body but\u2026 That would mean he would need all the blood of another person in exchange\u2026\u201dHe sensed that something was wrong. As time passed, Leng Yuexin started to look pale, she had replaced a third of her blood to Li Yanxing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBrother Li, I need to stop now.\u201d\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Li Yanxing nodded.Just as Leng Yuexin was going to perform the hand seal to disconnect the blood transfer, Li Yanxing glared straight at her and pierced through her chest with a short knife he had in his wounded right hand that came out of nowhere.Lin Huang who was watching from the back did not even have the time to react as it happened so fast. It was worse for Leng Yuexin. She looked at Li Yanxing in shock, \u201cBrother Li\u2026\u201d\u201cSilly girl, if you don\u2019t transfer all your blood to me, how would I clear the poison in my body? If I only get to dilute a third of the poison, I would never make it to Carefree City. So, you\u2019ll need to sacrifice yourself\u2026\u201d Li Yanxing smiled, devilishly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Lin Huang figured Li Yanxing was up to no good, he did not expect him to take Leng Yuexin\u2019s life right away.\u201cYou\u2026 Bastard\u2026\u201d Leng Yuexin\u2019s chest was pierced straight through by Li Yanxing\u2019s knife. She said that as she spat blood, not expecting Li Yanxing to be such a horrible person.Lin Huang panicked as he watched the scene transpire from a distance. If Leng Yuexin died, that would mean his mission had failed. Not only would he not obtain the two mission reward cards but he would also lose two of his Monster Cards. He would be at a great loss if Leng Yuexin died.\u201cBai, Charcoal, let\u2019s kill him!\u201d Lin Huang shouted and summoned both his monsters.Although Li Yanxing was poisoned and his body was weak, he was a Gold Hunter and almost a transcendent after all. Lin Huang knew he was not to be underestimated so he summoned his strongest monsters.Lin Huang then returned to his own body from his spectral form and took out his BlackEagle33. He morphed his gun to a sniper and aimed at Li Yanxing\u2019s left eye. Fortunately, the underground river was spacious and allowed Charcoal\u2019s full form to show. It flapped its wing and flew to the top of the cave and spat black fire at Li Yanxing. The\u00a0Black Dragon Flame\u00a0did not cover much ground, it was more like a focused jet of water directed towards Li Yanxing.At the same time, Bai attacked from 10 meters away. His crimson gold\u00a0Blood Power\u00a0wings turned into a pair of sharp blades that plunged towards Li Yanxing.Lin Huang who was standing 10 meters away channeled all his Iron Life Power. A Life Power bullet was formed in his gun chamber and he then pulled the trigger. The Iron Life Power bullet shot forward. It was a laser beam that shot at Li Yanxing\u2019s left eye, creating sparks in the air. Facing various attacks that were coming for him, Li Yanxing was stunned. He did not expect Lin Huang to appear out of nowhere with his two bronze-level monsters. Even if that had happened on a normal day, he knew he was in trouble as Lin Huang was also an Imperial Censor, Lin Huang and his two bronze-level monsters were nothing to him at full health and power. However, he was poisoned and had exhausted all the Life Power in his body to kill Leng Yuexin. As a Gold Hunter, his physique was strong, but without Life Power, he could not use any of his defensive skills at all. No matter how powerful he was, he could not defend against attacks from the two bronze-level monsters. Furthermore, he was also targeted and shot at with a BlackEagle33 that was almost a bronze-level weapon.Many Gold Hunters from the Hunter Association were killed by higher level monster hordes each year. Usually, there would only be iron-level and bronze-levels monsters as there were hardly any silver-level monsters. Those Gold Hunters who died were usually killed because they exhausted their Life Power, preventing them from being able to defend themselves against monster attacks with their physical body.The triple attacks from Lin Huang were almost upon him and he was helpless. To save himself, he had to let go of Leng Yuexin. Although his Life Power was exhausted, his body was still agile. He took a step back and he was already a few meters away, enough for him to get out of the attack area of Charcoal\u2019s dragon flame. Bai\u2019s blades were coming at him like tarsal bone maggots, but Li Yanxing did a backflip and avoided that fatal attack. Just then, the Life Power bullet grew close. He slammed his palm against the ground to somersault up in the air and avoided the bullet.The blood replacement was interrupted. After he avoided the attacks from Lin Huang and his monsters, he stood firmly on the ground and stared a deathly stare, shouting, \u201cHey! Do you want to die!?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who\u2019s asking for it!\u201d Lin Huang shouted back, \u201cBai, don\u2019t let him escape!\u201dBai knew what Lin Huang wanted. His\u00a0Blood Power\u00a0blades transformed into long whips and he attempted to strangle Li Yanxing. Even though his Life Power was exhausted, with his strong body, he was surprisingly agile. Lin Huang could not do anything to him. Lin Huang knew very well that the most effective way to tackle people like him was to tie them up so that he would not be able to escape from his attacks.Seeing the long whips coming for him, Li Yanxing was shocked. If he was to be tied up by the vampire, it would take mere seconds for Lin Huang and his monsters to kill him. The reason he did not run away in the first place was because he was unwilling to give up the blood replacement from Leng Yuexin. However, now that he saw the vampire activating his combat mode, he needed to escape. On the other hand, Leng Yuexin had passed out due to major blood loss and there was nothing more he could get from her.Ling Huang frowned and morphed his BlackEagle33 to a black pistol while he walked towards Leng Yuexin. Seeing Lin Huang getting close to Leng Yuexin and himself, Li Yanxing who was attempting to run, grinned. If Lin Huang was close to him, he could strike a fatal attack. If an Imperial Censor was dead, his monsters would automatically lose control and possibly fight each other. During the chaos, he could run away together with Leng Yuexin and finish the process elsewhere. So he gave up on his plan to run and waited patiently for Lin Huang to approach him.With his gun, Lin Huang moved closer to Leng Yuexin and Li Yanxing. Just when he arrived next to Leng Yuexin and attempted to carry her, Li Yanxing made his move and attacked. He took a few steps towards Lin Huang, his body became strange, like a slithering. A deep crevasse was created between Charcoal and Bai. Soon, he stood in front of Lin Huang. He did not hesitate for a moment as he transformed his hand into a blade and aimed it at the back of Lin Huang\u2019s neck. Even without Life Power, his gold-level ability would make that attack a fatal strike.Just when the blade reached Lin Huang\u2019s neck, a pair of crimson gold wings grew out of Lin Huang\u2019s back. Li Yanxing froze with shock, and one of Lin Huang\u2019s wings transformed into a blade and pierced through Li Yanxing\u2019s chest. When Lin Huang looked up, Li Yanxing saw a vampire with red eyes and silver hair stare up at him.\u201cDo you really think I am here to save her? Seems like you\u2019re not as smart as you thought,\u201d Lin Huang said, his bloodshot eyes wide open. \u201cI knew you would attempt to run so I used myself as a bait for you to come closer,\u201d he continued.\u201cYou\u2026 are a vampire\u2026\u201d Li Yanxing said as he spat blood. He did not expect things to be like this. He totally underestimated this little guy.\u201cSorry, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m human,\u201d Lin Huang said with a sinister smile.\u201cNow, you can rest in peace\u2026\u201dThe other wing on Lin Huang\u2019s back transformed into a lively crimson gold giant python. It strangled Li Yanxing\u2019s body and made its way all the way up to his head. When it reached his eyes, the snaked\u2019s head transformed into a sharp prick and pierced through his left eyeball through to the back of his head.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euInstantly, Li Yanxing was dead.\u201cDing!\u201d\u201cYou have performed a cross-ranking kill by killing a gold-level human. You\u2019ve obtained the rare skill cards\u00a0Thunder Sword\u00a0and\u00a0Cloud Steps\u00a0,\u201d Xiao Hei informed him.\u201cI can get skills from killing people?!\u201d Lin Huang was stunned when he heard the notification.The two cards were turned into light spheres that moved from Li Yanxing\u2019s dead body and dissolved into Lin Huang\u2019s chest. Lin Huang searched Li Yanxing corpse but he could not find anything. He guessed that all his equipment would probably be stored in his ring but since he was dead, his ring was sealed. Lin Huang then chopped off his finger to retrieve his ring and kept it in his storage space. The reason he wanted the ring was to prevent anyone from activating the ring to find any evidence should his dead body ever be found. After using Charcoal\u2019s dragon flame to incinerate Li Yanxing\u2019s dead body, Lin Huang dumped his body in the underground river and went to check up on Leng Yuexin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fresh blood soaked her shirt, and the artery on her right wrist had not stopped its bleeding. She was drenched in a pool of her own blood.\u201cXiao Hei, should I remove the knife first or do I use the Healing Card directly?\u201d Lin Huang asked. He was worried that removing the knife would cause even more bleeding. In Leng Yuexin\u2019s current state, if that happened, she would die within seconds. She could not take the torture any longer.\u201cYou can use the Healing Card directly. During the process of healing, the object that caused the injury would be removed from her body automatically,\u201d Xiao Hei explained.Hearing what Xiao Hei said, Lin Huang was slightly relieved.\u201cThen use a Healing Card on her.\u201dA white glow came out of Lin Huang\u2019s body into Leng Yuexin\u2019s body. Soon, her wound stopped bleeding. The black knife that was stabbed into her chest was removed slowly by an invisible force.\u201cGirl, I have spent two Transformation Cards and two Healing Cards on you\u2026 Please don\u2019t create more trouble for me\u2026\u201d Lin Huang muttered aloud and transformed to his original form from his vampire mode and looked on at Leng Yuexin healing anxiously. If he did not manage to kill Li Yanxing with the two cards that he pulled out at the last minute, the mission would have been a waste of his resources. Lin Huang did not know that something bigger was waiting for him. When he summoned Charcoal, the eyes on top of the jellyfish-like transcendent monster in the cave were opening one by one\u2026Near the entrance of the underground river, Leng Yuexin was healing fast with the help of the Healing Card. The life-threatening wound was healing in front of Lin Huang\u2019s eyes, her pale face became rosy as well.\u201cThe effects of the Healing Card is so amazing!\u201d Lin Huang exclaimed as he saw the changes on Leng Yuexin body. Unfortunately, he had three Healing Cards but now, two of them were used on her. This time, he did not stay hidden anymore since Leng Yuexin had seen him fighting and summoning Bai and Charcoal earlier. However, she did not see him transforming into Bai as she passed out. He did not bother to think of an explanation he would tell her, all he wanted was for her to wake up as soon as possible and leave this place.Soon, as her wounds were almost healed, Leng Yuexin woke up. She opened her eyes and saw Lin Huang, Charcoal and Bai who were not far away.\u201cYou saved me?\u201d Leng Yuexin said quietly, almost in a whisper as she looked at her chest and noticed that her wound had disappeared. Same on her wrist, just that the blood stains reassured her that she was not dreaming.\u201cYes,\u201d Lin Huang said. He was not going to deny it.\u201cWas it you who removed the poison from my body too?\u201d Leng Yuexin asked as she noticed that her condition was similar to the previous time she woke up from being poisoned as she noticed back then that the poison had completely cleared from her body too. Even the wound that was left by the transcendent monster disappeared as well.\u201cYes, if you have any more questions, we can talk about it on our way out of here,\u201d Lin Huang said as he knew the underground cave was not safe after the battle and he wanted to leave as soon as possible.\u201cWait, let me change my clothes,\u201d she said. Seeing herself in a mess, Leng Yuexin blushed.\u201cYou can change when you\u2019re outside, it\u2019s not safe here\u2026\u201d Just when Lin Huang said that, the ground started to shake.They were shocked, they both instantly knew that it was the transcendent monster. It must be coming for Charcoal who was a dragonkin with dragon blood flowing through its veins.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Bai will get you out of here!\u201d Lin Huang shouted.\u201cThen what about you?\u201d Leng Yuexin asked, surprised to hear his instructions.\u201cI\u2019m just an avatar, my real body is up there,\u201d Lin Huang lied to her. He knew the made-up the excuse would speed things up and Leng Yuexin would not worry about him. He then called Bai who came forth with his\u00a0Blood Power\u00a0wings transformed into a pair of fins. Bai then carried Leng Yuexin, dived into the water and swam swiftly towards the entrance of the cave.The light blue tentacles were coming for him and Charcoal. He recalled Charcoal immediately and transformed himself into Specter. He then leaped and hid behind the wall. The light blue tentacles seemed to sense Lin Huang had gone through the wall and they swept all over the location where Lin Huang and Charcoal were. Lin Huang did not turn to look behind him as he ran for his life from wall to wall. He heard loud thuds that sounded like an earthquake followed by the roar of the monster.Deep in the cave, the light blue jellyfish monster turned a bloody red and shined a bright red glow all around the cave. Its countless tentacles were going towards the direction where Lin Huang and Charcoal had disappeared. As a transcendent monster, it knew very well about the importance of bloodlines. If it was to swallow a pure dragonkin, it would not become a dragonkin itself, but it would at least transform into something similar to the level of a Sky Dragon. By then, its ability would increase immensely.Losing the scent of the dragonkin made it furious but soon it became calm as it caught a whiff of a human with hints of dragon blood. After locking its target on the human, countless deadly light-blue tentacles headed out for Lin Huang. Sensing the vibrations behind him getting more and more intense, Lin Huang started to run upwards. In less than three minutes, he was on the ground. Noticing that the transcendent monster was not giving up, Lin Huang used his Provisional Transformation Card and turned himself into an Alexandrian Eagle.He flapped his wings and his gigantic body went all the way to the clouds within seconds. However, he did not leave the place immediately. He observed the area from the sky. He saw clearly that the red tentacles had pierced through the ground and caused cracks to appear all over the place. However, it was only a few centimeters out of the ground. Suddenly, the ground started to burn. The transcendent monster let out a devastating groan and retracted all its tentacles.Seeing the strange phenomenon, Lin Huang guessed the monster must be sealed underground by some strange force which caused its body to burn once it left the ground. Now he knew where the cracks on the ground came from. Knowing that the monster was no longer a threat, he waited patiently for Leng Yuexin. The pool and waterfall that connected to the underground cave\u2019s entrance was\u00a0close\u00a0by. They had to come out of that entrance as there was only one way.Flapping his wings, Lin Huang landed on a giant rock next to the pool. He turned back into a human and waited patiently. Soon, Bai brought Leng Yuexin who was wrapped in a diving suit out of the water. After removing the diving equipment, Leng Yuexin and Bai swam towards Lin Huang.\u201cI think I heard the monster again!\u201d Leng Yuexin shouted at Lin Huang once she got ashore.\u201cYes, we need to leave here quickly,\u201d Lin Huang nodded and summoned Viridian Wolf immediately.\u201cWait, I\u2019ll only take a minute to change. Don\u2019t worry about the monster, it\u2019s sealed underground by the black rock, there\u2019s no way it can escape,\u201d Leng Yuexin said. She was soaking wet. It was summer, and she was uncovered. Her clothes were so wet that they were stuck on her body, shaped to each and every curve of her body.Lin Huang looked the other way. Leng Yuexin leaped towards the waterfall and changed behind a giant rock. Lin Huang recalled Bai and waited patiently. Soon, Leng Yuexin was done changing. She wore a pair of jeans with a white shirt. It was casual and pleasing. She was pretty and had nice features. She used to give off the vibe that she was rich and obnoxious. Now as she was dressed in casual attire, she looked really down to earth.\u201cThank you for saving me twice, I owe my life to you and I will never forget that,\u201d Leng Yuexin said as she leaped from the waterfall and landed not far from Lin Huang.\u201cIf you could send me back to Carefree City, that would make us even then,\u201d Lin Huang replied. He just wanted to complete his mission.\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t mention it, I will send you back in one piece. Since I have already accepted the mission, I will have to complete it. It has nothing to do with repaying you,\u201d Leng Yuexin answered his request and shook her head.\u201cHowever, before that, please give me two to three days, I need to kill that bastard Li Yanxing with my own hands!\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 Li Yanxing is dead,\u201d Lin Huang said while rubbing his nose and averting his eyes.\u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d Leng Yuexin looked at him confused as she did not think Lin Huang could have managed to kill Li Yanxing. Although he killed him in a bad way, she thought Lin Huang was just chasing Li Yanxing away instead of killing him.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I killed him,\u201d Lin Huang said and then took out Li Yanxing\u2019s ring.Leng Yuexin recognized Li Yanxing\u2019s ring immediately, \u201cHe\u2019s really dead!\u201d\u201cHe was poisoned and almost exhausted all his Life Power when he attacked you. I killed him together with my monsters, burnt his body and tossed it into the underground river,\u201d Lin Huang lied. Of course, he could not tell her about killing Li Yanxing by transforming himself into a vampire.\u201cAlthough he was strong, he was strangled by a vampire, and there was no way he could run,\u201d he continued.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright then. There will be trouble if you keep his ring. Give it to me, I will tell his family that he attempted to kill me so I defended myself and ended him. About this ring too, I will get someone to activate it. I will send all the stuff in his storage space to you, just give me your address,\u201d Leng Yuexin said to Lin Huang.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too when I retrieved his ring. I was worried if his family found out about me from this ring, it would mean a great load of trouble for me,\u201d Lin Huang said and nodded. He then tossed the ring to Leng Yuexin.Leng Yuexin caught the ring and kept it in her storage space.\u201cSince Li Yanxing is dead, do you have anything else you have to do?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cNo. Li Yanxing is dead, two of the guys were eaten by the monster and another one was poisoned. There\u2019s no reason for me to stay. Let me send you back to the city,\u201d Leng Yuexin said and shook her head recounting all the events of the day. She then took out her monster taming token and summoned her gold-level Frostwolf. She rode on it while Lin Huang rode on his Viridian Wolf and headed on their way\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The streets were crowded with people at the many restaurants that lit up at night. As time passed, it became a major attraction of this foothold which beckoned many tourists. It was late in the evening when Lin Huang and Leng Yuexin arrived in Carefree City. All the restaurants were opened for business, many tables and chairs were arranged in the alfresco area.Looking at the crowds in the restaurants on both sides and the smell of food in the air, Lin Huang started to get hungry. He just realized that he only had breakfast that day before his mission. Leng Yuexin was a little panicked in the crowd as she hardly went to places that were crowded.\u201cI bet you\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s my treat,\u201d Lin Huang offered. He was hungry himself but he did not want Leng Yuexin to feel left out so he suggested a meal together.\u201cHuh?\u201d Leng Yuexin hesitated as she had never eaten at places like this before.\u201cWhat would you like to eat?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cAnything\u2026 is fine with me\u2026\u201d Leng Yuexin did not want to reject Lin Huang as he saved her life. Even if the food was terrible, she would force herself to eat.\u201cI\u2019ll order then. Can you take spicy food?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Leng Yuexin nodded.Lin Huang was not familiar with the food in this world as there were so much more varieties here than on Earth. He would usually eat something that he was familiar with but there were many dishes he had never tried in this place. However, Lin Huang was experienced when it came to finding good food. He used to travel a lot, and aside from browsing food recommendations on the Internet, he would come up with useful food guides that were about the crowd a place had, the number of people eating at a restaurant, which location had better tasting food and so on, trying to make the experience of finding the best meal much simpler for his readers.Although most of the dishes were unfamiliar to him, it was not difficult to tell which restaurants had good\u00a0business based on his guide.\u201cLet\u2019s go to that one!\u201dLin Huang strolled around and found a restaurant with quite a long queue. He then pulled Leng Yuexin into the queue. Leng Yuexin\u2019s appearance attracted many wandering eyes. Although she did not dress up, her beauty could not be hidden.10 minutes later, it was finally Lin Huang and Leng Yuexin\u2019s turn to enter the restaurant. The restaurant owner was a middle-aged man. He stood behind the counter and looked at the both of them. He smiled at Lin Huang and commented, \u201cLittle man, your girlfriend is so pretty!\u201dLeng Yuexin blushed as Lin Huang waved his hand, \u201cUncle, that\u2019s a misunderstanding, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d Lin Huang explained.The restaurant owner smiled and did not dwell on the topic, \u201cWhat would the both of you like to order?\u201d he asked.\u201cPlease recommend your specials, good sir,\u201d Lin Huang asked politely. He knew that the owner would always recommend their specialties to convert people into regular customers at their establishments.\u201cOur food portions are pretty big, two dishes and a soup would be sufficient for the both of you. If you order more, the extra food might go to waste,\u201d the restaurant owner said with a hearty laugh. \u201cWe have two specialties here. One of them would be the Roasted Iceberg Pig Tenderloin while the second would be the Grilled Steak which is made from the Ox Devil\u2019s Ribs. For the soup dish, let\u2019s get you guys the Twin Vine Flower Soup. It\u2019s light and healthy,\u201d he said.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll get everything you recommended,\u201d Lin Huang nodded with satisfaction.\u201cCan the both of you take spicy food?\u201d the restaurant owner asked.\u201cJust slightly,\u201d Lin Huang replied.\u201cSure, take a seat. Your food will be sent to you soon,\u201d the owner said.Seeing there was an empty table at the al fresco area, Lin Huang lead Leng Yuexin to take a seat. When he was in the university, Lin Huang would usually go to the beach with his roommates for a barbecue and a few beers during the summer. Later on, although he needed to eat out with his customers a lot, he hardly ate street food anymore.Al-fresco street food places like this made him reminisce about his simple life back on Earth.Leng Yuexin sat across from Lin Huang. Seeing him staring into space, it was quite awkward for her. She broke the ice by asking, \u201cDo you usually come to places like this?\u201d\u201cNo, this is my first time,\u201d Lin Huang was stunned, he shook his head and said, \u201cThere used to be street food like this in my hometown but it has been a long time since I\u2019ve eaten there.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Leng Yuexin nodded and did not know how to continue the topic.\u201cHave you not been to places like this?\u201d Lin Huang asked as he noticed that Leng Yuexin seemed uneasy.\u201cNo,\u201d Leng Yuexin shook her head and said, \u201cMy family wouldn\u2019t allow me to eat at places like this.\u201dJust then, Lin Huang recalled that she was royalty. Although he did not know much about the royalty here, he concluded that they should be similar to the knights in the olden days that lived by certain principles such as having good manners and strict rules both at home and in public. It was normal that they were not allowed to eat by the streets. Since that topic involved Leng Yuexin\u2019s family, Lin Huang did not want to pry any further so he changed the subject and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that monster that lived underground?\u201d He asked.\u201cThat was a Floating Orchid, an undead species from the abyss. A transcendent from our family sealed it in Wangyou Forest more than 100 years ago so that generations to come could kill it to level up into a transcendent. My purpose here this time was to kill it so that I could level up. I didn\u2019t know that it had mutated twice since then. Although its combat strength remained the same, its ability was more than 10 times stronger than it was 100 years ago. If you were not there, I would have surely died,\u201d Leng Yuexin told Lin Huang the story of the monster that lived underground in the Wangyou Forest.\u201cDid you hire Li Yanxing as your assistant?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cNo, I was alone when I departed but I bumped into them. Our families had a good relationship and he knew that I was there to kill the monster so he decided to help. I knew that he was up to something but I did not want to reject him so we decided to go on the mission together. No matter how strong a companion is, we always have to be cautious. Thankfully you were there so that he could not carry out his evil plan. I am so grateful we met you,\u201d Leng Yuexin finally told him about the real reason why they were together.After listening to Leng Yuexin\u2019s explanation, Lin Huang thought how Li Yanxing bumped into her was quite strange. Just as they were talking, the waiter came with their food so their conversation was interrupted. Lin Huang had tried many delicious delicacies but the specialties the restaurant owner had recommended was incredible! The spices and seasoning alone were better than the food he would die for on earth. The restaurant owner was brilliant in the kitchen. Not only did Lin Huang feel that way, Leng Yuexin did not stop eating too. She did not like street food but the food they were having was irresistible.The both of them cleared all the food. Leng Yuexin wiped her mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never tried street food. I didn\u2019t know it was so good! Thank you!\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019ve another chance, I\u2019ll bring you to other places too,\u201d Lin Huang said with a smile.\u201cI\u2019ll have to leave in a while, my family sent someone to pick me up. You will leave soon too, right?\u201d Leng Yuexin asked.\u201cI\u2019ll leave tomorrow morning. If I stay here any longer, my sister will be worried,\u201d Lin Huang told her and smiled awkwardly in embarrassment.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Leng Yuexin kept quiet for a while and asked, \u201cI have been wanting to ask you this but I don\u2019t know if I should.\u201d\u201cPlease do. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll answer your questions the way I know how to,\u201d Lin Huang said as he nodded. He had made up answers to all the possible questions she could ask in his mind.\u201cI want to know why you saved me?\u201d Leng Yuexin asked. Out of all the questions he had prepared himself for, this was the one question that Lin Huang had not expect. She actually had many questions for him, among them were the reasons why went underground? What kind of healing magic did he possess to have saved her twice? She could tell clearly that the guy in the cave was not his avatar, how did he manage to get out of the cave? However, she chose to ask why he had saved her instead.\u201cMaybe\u2026I like you,\u201d Lin Huang answered, just making up the first thing that came to mind. He could not tell her that he was on a mission and that saving her was mandatory.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Leng Yuexin asked. She did not seem to accept his answer.\u201cThat\u2019s it. I like you, so I saved you,\u201d Lin Huang nodded and answered in all seriousness.\u201cAlright, I shall accept your answer,\u201d Leng Yuexin knew that Lin Huang was not telling the truth but she did not want to dwell on it. She then looked at the time on her ring and stood up, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, I need to go now,\u201d she said.\u201cAlright, we shall meet for food if there\u2019s another chance in the future,\u201d Lin Huang stood up as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI will send you the stuff that I\u2019ve promised. Goodbye!\u201d Leng Yuexin said politely. She then turned around and left.Seeing her walking away, Lin Huang then waved at the restaurant owner, \u201cBoss! Bill, please!\u201dThe restaurant owner walked to him with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, didn\u2019t it go as you expected? I don\u2019t mean to nag, but men should always cling to girls they like. You\u2019ll understand this when you\u2019re my age. Girls that pretty are hard to come by even if you\u2019ve lived an entire lifetime. How could you give up just like that? Go chase after her, maybe there\u2019s still a chance to turn things around. You should treat her better, go somewhere nicer\u2026\u201d He advised Lin Huang with a sincere look in his eyes.\u201cUncle, we are really, just friends\u2026\u201d Lin Huang replied. He paid immediately and left soon after. The owner was confused because the young man looked like he was running for his life.\u201cSigh\u2026 Such a nice lady. Why did they break up just like that? Young people nowadays\u2026 How strange\u2026\u201d The middle-aged man sighed as he watched Lin Huang leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He got into the room and sat on the living room couch. He then got Xiao Hei to arrange his cards.\u201cYou have received a total of nine new cards.\u201d\u201cNew Monster Card x5 \u2013 Charcoal (Epic), Alexandrian Eagle (Rare), Viridian Wolf, Demonic One-Eyed Ape, Specter\u201d\u201cNew Skill Cards: Thunder Sword (Rare), Cloud steps (Rare)\u201d\u201cNew Function Cards: Advance Card x1\u201d\u201cNew Item Card (Relic) x1\u201dLin Huang was satisfied when he heard the list. The two cards he obtained for completing the mission were an Advance Card and a Relic Item Card. He had received both of them when he stepped into Carefree City. However, there was another notification that came from Xiao Hei later on.\u201cYou have used a total of six cards\u201d\u201cCards that you have used: Provisional Transformation Cards x5, Healing cards x2, Double Reward Cards x3, Mission Cards x2\u201d\u201cI have used all my Provisional Transformation Cards?\u201d Lin Huang asked, stunned at the announcement. He mumbled and calculated, \u201cI used one when I killed the Six-Armed Demon in the Purple Dress, one for going underground, another to kill Li Yanxing, one more to get out of the cave and I used the last one to transform into the Alexandrian Eagle to fly into the air\u2026 I really did use all of them!\u201d He exclaimed.\u201cTwo Healing Cards were used on Leng Yuexin, three Double Reward Cards got me 20 cross-ranking Reward Cards\u2026\u201d Lin Huang thought. He then frowned and asked, \u201cXiao Hei, please calculate all the remaining cards that I have.\u201d\u201cYou have a total of 17 non-Monster Cards: Advance Card x4, Mission Card x1, Treasure Card x3, Life Power Storage Card x2, Item Card x4, Limitless Card x1, Flawless Card x2, Healing Card x1.\u201d\u201cFour Advance Cards would mean I can upgrade both Bai and Tyrant\u2026\u201d At the very beginning when he got his first two monsters, he always wondered which he should advance first. Now, he no longer had to think and upgraded the both of them.\u201cXiao Hei, if I were to upgrade both Bai and Sand Monster to Epic-levels, that wouldn\u2019t affect me right?\u201d Lin Huang asked Xiao Hei before he upgraded both of them.\u201cNo. But upgrading twice would mean one Life Transformation. They will evolve into another species and during the evolution, they will need a large amount of Life Power. I don\u2019t suggest you do it in the foothold or the areas near the foothold. An unusual wave of life force could attract the attention of a transcendent as well as the monitoring bureau of the Union Government. Furthermore, I don\u2019t suggest you do it in the wild zone as there are transcendent monsters there too, just to be safe,\u201d Xiao Hei explained.\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201d Lin Huang had to put his plan on hold. He was lucky that he got out of Wangyou Forest alive but he was not going to back there just to upgrade his monsters.\u201cI\u2019ll have to wait for the next time I go to a wild zone then, since I can do it anytime,\u201d he thought. He then continued, \u201cFrom the four Item Cards, three of them should be able to get me some Item. And the random Relic Item Card that I retrieved from the mission, let\u2019s activate all of them!\u201d Four Item Cards with a question mark on top appeared in Lin Huang\u2019s hand. Three of them were pure white while another was silver in color.\u201cActivate Item Card x4\u201d\u201cCongratulations, you have received bronze-level armor x1, bronze-level battle sword x1, bronze-level water bottle x1.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, you have received a Scouting Relic \u2013 Waxed Dragoneye (pirated)!\u201d\u201cScouting Relic\u2026\u201d Lin Huang was speechless. Although such a relic was very useful, it required a lot of money. A single use would use up Life Crystal which was worth a hundred years. The one he wanted the most was actually a Sword Relic. Not only he did not need his Life Power to use it, the sharpness of Sword Relic would never decrease.He then tapped on the treasure tool card to read the detailed description.\u201cItem Card (Relic)\u201d\u201cLevel: Four-star relic\u201d\u201cRelic Name: Waxed Dragoneye (pirated)\u201d\u201cRelic Type: Scouting Relic\u201d\u201cDescription of Relic: This pirated holy relic can identify and detect everything that is going on within a coverage area of 1,000 kilometers.\u201d\u201cUsage Limit: Maximum three times per day!\u201d\u201cLooks like an astonishing relic with such strict limitations. I can only use it three times per day!\u201d Lin Huang raised his eyebrow. All the other equipment were transformed into rings after they were activated but this relic remained a card.To activate relics, he would have to be at least gold-level so that he can have sufficient Life Power. Lin Huang was very far from that so he had to keep it in its card form.After keeping his new equipment, he looked at the two skill cards that he obtained from killing Li Yanxing.\u201cSkill Card\u201d\u201cSkill Card Name: Thunder Sword\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cType of Skill: Sword\u201d\u201cSkill Level: Gold-level\u201d\u201cStatus: Available\u201d\u201cDescription: This skill required speed and force to be effective.\u201d\u201cRemarks: This skill requires Life Power.\u201d\u201cCard remarks: Passable\u201d\u2026\u201cSkill Card\u201d\u201cSkill Card Name: Cloud Steps\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cType of Skill: Body movement\u201d\u201cSkill Level: Gold-level\u201d\u201cStatus: Available\u201d\u201cDescription: This skill is suitable for short-distance teleportation.\u201d\u201cRemarks: This skill is a unique movement skill. Not limited to level, the effect changes with the user\u2019s ability.\u201d\u201cCard remarks: Passable\u201d\u201cNo bad,\u201d Lin Huang thought. He was satisfied with the two skills that he obtained. He practiced his Thunder Sword for many days before and only got a few card pieces. He did not expect to get the card from killing Li Yanxing. As for Cloud Steps, he witnessed it in one of Li Yanxing\u2019s battles, it was a pretty amazing teleportation skill.\u201cActivate both skill cards!\u201d he said.\u201cActivation has been completed!\u201dBoth skill cards on Lin Huang\u2019s hand disappeared. He then looked at his Exclusive Card and saw two skills added to his list of skills.He then looked at the cards that Xiao Hei listed on the notification board.\u201cWhat is this Life Power Storage Card and Limitless Card?\u201d Lin Huang asked. He had obtained the two cards when he performed a cross-ranking kill on the transcendent monster in Wangyou Forest. It was one of the 20 reward cards that he obtained but did not have the time to look at them.He viewed the Life Power Storage Card and was stunned after reading its description.\u201cLife Power Storage Card: After it is activated, it can clone the user\u2019s Life Wheel and store the same amount of Life Power as the user\u2019s original Life Wheel.\u201cRemarks: This card can only increase the storage of Life Power but not clone the other functions that a Life Wheel comes with.\u201dEven with that disappointing remark, Lin Huang thought this card was the best thing ever. Once it was activated, he would have an extra Life Wheel. Moreover, he had two Life Power Storage Cards.\u201cEach iron-level rank-3 Life Wheel has 1080 columns of Life Power. If I activate both cards, I would have three Life Wheels of Life Power stored in my body, which is equivalent to 3240 columns of Life Power!\u201d Lin Huang was over the moon when he read the card\u2019s function and instructed Xiao Hei immediately, \u201cXiao Hei, activate both of the Life Power Storage Cards!\u201d\u201cLife Power Storage Card x2, activated!\u201dBoth of the Life Power Storage Cards started to glow and the glow enveloped his body. He inspected his body afterward and there really were two additional Life Wheels that looked exactly the same. However, all the other columns were blank. Unlike his original Life Wheel, the Life Power only filled the first circle.He then looked at the Limitless Card, \u201cSo what\u2019s this Limitless card?\u201dLimitless Card: After using it, you can permanently upgrade one thing of your choice for an unlimtied amount of time.\u201d\u201cRemarks: It will disappear after one use.\u201d\u201cAn unlimited upgrade?!\u201d The first thing Lin Huang thought of when he saw the card\u2019s function was Xiao Hei.\u201cXiao Hei, is this card effective on you?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Xiao Hei replied firmly.\u201cThat\u2019s great, then I\u2019ll use the card on you, which also means I get to upgrade my usage of you without limitations!\u201d Lin Huang said and smiled at the thought.\u201cAre you sure about the target user?\u201d\u201cConfirmed!\u201d\u201cLimitless card has been usage\u2026 You have received an upgrade\u2026\u201d\u201cActivated new function \u2013 Card Pieces Mall!\u201d\u201cRandom card reward, card selection has been increased from 12 pieces to 18 pieces!\u201d\u201cCard Pieces Mall?!\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s eyes brightened up. He was just thinking of trading off his card pieces for something useful.\u201cYou only have iron-level and bronze-level card pieces, you can\u2019t browse pages that are of a higher card level.\u201d\u201cSure, let me take a look at iron-level and bronze-level card pieces.\u201d Lin Huang nodded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMany cards were presented to him. After he glanced through them, he felt cheated by Xiao Hei.\u201cI have to use two card pieces to trade one card piece of the same level\u2026 One normal iron-level monster would only need 30 card pieces to combine a but here, I would have to use 60 card pieces!\u201d\u201cAs your card pieces are not the monsters you want, there\u2019s a price to pay if you want certain monsters,\u201d Xiao Hei explained.He then looked at the rare monster cards. Every single one of them would need at least 10,000 card pieces and there were many that required millions of card pieces.\u201cSeems like I\u2019m still a poor boy that can\u2019t afford anything here\u2026\u201d Lin Huang shook his head. Normal Monster Cards would not help him much but the Rare Monster Cards required ridiculous amounts of card pieces which were way more the card pieces he owned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was almost eight in the morning and the sun was breaking in the dawn. The city was waking up from its nightly slumber. However, Lin Huang was bummed as he did not manage to book the Demonic Crystal Spaceship tickets the night before and would have to wait for the next scheduled flight which would the following Monday.He called Lin Xin and unsurprisingly, she picked up even before her phone started to ring. A video was projected before him.\u201cBrother, was it successful?!\u201d Lin Xin looked at Lin Huang in excitement.\u201cYes, I\u2019m now an Iron-level hunter!\u201d Lin Huang nodded in matched enthusiasm.\u201cEver since you left, I\u2019ve browsed through some information about the Six-Armed Demon on the network. It seemed powerful but brother, you\u2019re even more powerful than the demon!\u201d She shouted. Lin Xin always thought her brother was invincible, and moments like those proved her right, for her own sake.\u201cOf course!\u201d Lin Huang smiled.\u201cBrother, when are you coming back?\u201d Lin Xin asked.\u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be a spaceship that departs to Baqi City today but I just got my settled down after sorting out my stuff from yesterday and didn\u2019t manage to get the ticket. I\u2019ll have to come back next week\u2026\u201d Lin Huang explained. \u201cHowever, I have some things to settle when I\u2019m back in Baqi City so that\u2019ll take one or two days. I\u2019ll get that done in Carefree City since I\u2019m already here,\u201d he continued.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Xin said, sounding upset.\u201cCarefree City is a food heaven, I\u2019ll bring you good food when I\u2019m back. What would you like to eat?\u201d Lin Huang smiled and asked.\u201cI want everything!\u201d Lin Xin said playfully.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get one each for you.\u201d Lin Huang nodded.\u201cNo, I want two of each dish!\u201d Lin Xin said.\u201cCan you finish so much food, you little glutton?\u201d Lin Huang raised his eyebrows.\u201cOf course! We\u2019ll share it. I want you to eat with me!\u201d Lin Xin\u2019s tone remained playful.\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll get two of each\u2026\u201d Lin Huang shook his head.\u201cBrother, can you stay longer this time when you\u2019re back?\u201d Lin Xin asked after a moment of hesitation.\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem, why?\u201d Lin Huang replied, curious at her request.\u201cIt\u2019s summer break next week. I will be so bored without you at home\u2026\u201d Lin Xin explained, rolling her eyes and pouting at the thought.There were four seasons in Division7 as well. Everyone, no matter a child in school or an adult at work would have four long holidays every year. Spring break was a long holiday during the rainy season which was usually 15 to 20 days. However, it would not be raining in all the\u00a0areas\u00a0and the holiday did not apply to certain areas as well. Summer break was similar to the experience back on Earth, it was the warmest season of the year. The break would usually be one and a half months and if it was too warm, the break could go on for two months. Autumn break would be the anniversary of the establishment of the Union Government. The break lasted for 10 days. Lastly, the winter break which was similar to the one on Earth. This coldest holiday would last for one to two months. Some areas that were colder would get a holiday that was longer than two months.Lin Huang was shocked when he learned about the four long holidays in this world. The first thing that came to his mind was, \u201cWe get five months of holidays in this world? These people are so pampered!\u201d He later found out that to ordinary people, it was not really a holiday for those who were working during the summer and winter. It was more like a work from home situation.\u201cAhh, I almost forgot about the summer break\u2026\u201d Lin Huang scratched his head, \u201cIt would be boring to stay at home for one to two months. Why not you pick a destination and we\u2019ll travel there?\u201d\u201cA vacation? Yes please!\u201d Lin Xin screamed. She had never left Wulin Town since she was little. She was so excited when Lin Huang suggested the vacation.\u201cYou pick the destination within the next few days. After I get back, I\u2019ll rest for two or three days before we depart,\u201d Lin Huang told her. He was relieved when he managed to coax her out of her solemn mood.\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xin nodded her head hard.After he hung up the phone, he had breakfast downstairs. He then went to the reception and booked his room for another one week and left to the Hunter Association. There was a division of the Hunter Association in the middle of each foothold. Lin Huang planned to trade the dead monster carcasses to get credit points when he got back to Baqi City but now that he could not leave just yet, he figured he would do it that here instead since it was the same. In reality, the price of dead monster carcasses was\u00a0fixed so it would not matter which city he went to.The Hunter Association divisions were built in the central area of each city. It was not far from the hotel that Lin Huang stayed in. It only took him a 10-minute walk to get there. It was 8:30 in the morning when he got there and it was already crowded. Lin Huang followed the crowd to the main hall and made his way to the reception desk on the left of the entrance. There were many people at the counter, and after waiting for quite a while, he was finally at the counter.\u201cHi, I would like to know where to trade in monster carcasses,\u201d he asked.\u201cIt\u2019s at the Monster Carcass Warehouse behind the hall, I\u2019ll get someone to bring you there.\u201d The receptionist in a red dress called a number and immediately hung up after a short exchange of words.\u201cSomeone will come get you, please give them a moment,\u201d she told him.One or two minutes later, a strong, young man approached Lin Huang when he saw him standing next to the receptionist.\u201cAre you the guest who would like to trade in monster carcasses?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s me,\u201d Lin Huang nodded.\u201cHow many are there?\u201d\u201cI think there are 300 to 400 of them, I didn\u2019t count,\u201d Lin Huang really had no idea of the exact amount as he collected so many himself while he was following Li Yanxing. Bai and Charcoal killed quite a lot of monsters as well. The storage in his ring was full to the extent they were not able to bring back the carcasses of the monsters they killed later on.\u201cAlright, please follow me,\u201d the young man said. He brought Lin Huang to the back of the hall.It was a large backyard. The young man led Lin Huang across the backyard to the far end. There was a massive house that looked like a warehouse. The young man stopped at the entrance of the warehouse, turned around and said to Lin Huang, \u201cYou can put all the monster carcasses here, I\u2019ll get my master to count them.\u201dThe young man then walked into the warehouse. Lin Huang took out all the monster carcasses from his storage ring, and soon the carcasses were piled into a small hill at the entrance of the warehouse.A moment later, a short and stout old man walked out slowly. The young man walked behind him without saying a word. The old man looked at Lin Huang, nodded, and walked around the pile of monster carcasses. He then said to Lin Huang,\u201dThere are a total of 421 of them, 187 are bronze-level rank-3 and 234 are bronze-level rank-2. Is that correct?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t count them myself, so I have no idea how many are there.\u201d Lin Huang replied, stunned at what had just happened. He thought it was strange that the old man just walked around the monster carcasses and he managed to get such an accurate figure. However, what he was certain of was there were only monsters of bronze-level rank-2 and bronze-level rank-3 as he cleared out all the bronze-level rank-1 in his storage to store more valuable monster carcasses.\u201cHercules, help him count them,\u201d the old man ordered and waved to the young man casually. He then walked back into the warehouse.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible that my master would have miscalculated. I\u2019ll count them for you again then,\u201d the strong, young man said then lifted a monster\u2019s thigh and tossed it aside.Lin Huang was shocked. The young man had just lifted a Trihorn Rhino. Although it was not a gigantic monster, it weighed at least five tons but the young man managed to lift it with just one hand. What shocked Lin Huang even more was, there were no signs of Life Power on the young man\u2019s body.\u201cWas he born strong or is there some other reason?\u201d Lin Huang looked at him skeptically while he counted the carcasses. The figure was exactly what the old man said.\u201cAre you done counting?\u201d The old man came back and smiled at Lin Huang while he stood at the warehouse entrance. \u201cThe price of a bronze-level rank-2 monster carcass is usually within 300,000 to 500,000 credit points while bronze-level rank-3 would be within 500,000 to 800,000 credit points. The accurate price for all these carcasses would be 215.15 million credit points. I\u2019ll round it up to 215.2 million credit points for you,\u201d he said.\u201cSure, thank you old man,\u201d Lin Huang replied. He thought it would have been great if he could get at least one hundred million credit points out of the carcasses but it was so much more than he expected.\u201cHercules, please do the transfer for him,\u201d The old man then passed a note that was the\u00a0size of his palm with \u2018215,200,000\u2019 written on it. Lin Huang was surprised but he took the note.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we need to go to the finance department near the hall,\u201d Hercules said, and he ushered Lin Huang out of the warehouse and into the hall.While they were walking, Lin Huang could not help but ask, \u201cWhat does the Hunter Association do with so many monster carcasses?\u201d\u201cMost of them will become food in the market while rare ones will be sent for research,\u201d Hercules explained.\u201cThe Hunter Association collaborates with the House of Food and many other organizations so there are many orders for the carcasses,\u201d he continued.\u201cAhh, so they collaborate with the House of Food\u2026\u201d Lin Huang finally understood why the Hunter Association needed massive supplies of monster carcasses.The House of Food was an organization that many Food Hunters joined. The organization only recruited Food Hunters so they need to collaborate with other organizations for other resources. For the safety of food ingredients, they did not purchase ingredients from the market. The selection of food ingredients was done by the Hunter Association and Adventurer Paradise, which saved the House of Food a lot of time.Hercules brought Lin Huang to the finance office, Lin Huang then passed the note to the middle-aged woman behind the counter. The woman looked at the note and looked at Hercules and Lin Huang, \u201c215.2 million, is that right?\u201d she confirmed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Lin Huang nodded. A white interface then popped up before him.\u201cPlease scan at the bottom right corner. The transfer will be done within three minutes,\u201d the woman said.Lin Huang scanned the barcode at the bottom right corner with his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring immediately. Just as he retracted his hand, he received a transfer notification. It was a message from the credit bureau.\u201cDear Mr. Lin Huang, you have received a transfer of 215.2 million credit points.\u201dLooking at the number, Lin Huang was over the moon, \u201cWho cares what kind of currency this is, I finally have more than a hundred million in my savings\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It advertised two BlackEagle33\u2019s, one was on its pistol form while another was on\u00a0its sniper form. He then realized that it was a commercial for the game\u00a0Gun Master\u00a0. The game was a collaboration between Eagle Company and Hacker Company.Lin Huang was familiar with the game. From what he remembered, the game was popular when he was still in school. Within the past two years, as the game was upgraded, the player population increased significantly. It was initially played by the general public out of boredom but now there were many hunters who were playing it religiously. However, the hunters did not see it as a game but more as a form of training. Many gunmasters and hunters who played\u00a0Gun Master\u00a0as a hobby used the game to train themselves.The guns in the game were a 100% match to a real gun. Even the bullet trajectory was exactly the same as an actual gun. The game was never cheap, even on its launch in the past. A game ring sold at 3,000 credit points. After the recent game upgrades, the game ring now cost more than 10,000 credit points.The commercial was almost three minutes long. Lin Huang stayed on and watched the commercial until the end, realizing that the game had come up with servers in exclusive areas for the hunters. Besides catering to gunmasters, the game had now extended its range of weapons to many other long-distance attack weapons including conventional bows, crossbows, flying knives and more.There was also a battle arena which without weapon limitations.\u201cNo wonder. This is why they\u2019re showing the commercial outside the Hunter Association, they\u2019re planning to promote the game to the hunter community,\u201d Lin Huang thought as he looked at the price of the latest game ring. It was a whopping 13,000 credit points. The price used to be unacceptable to Lin Huang but it was nothing to him now as he had just received a huge amount of credit points.\u201cI have never played this version before. I\u2019ll just buy one game ring to try it out and see if I have the talent needed to become a gunmaster,\u201d he thought. Lin Huang did exactly what he planned. He then scanned the barcode at the bottom corner of the commercial board and entered the shopping page. After confirming the delivery address which was his home in Wulin Town, he proceeded to pay for it. A message was sent to him immediately, \u201cYou have ordered \u2018Gun Master Edition V\u2019. We will send it to you as soon as possible. If you would like to cancel your order, please log in to our official website to do so within three hours,\u201d the notification read.After reading the message, he closed the shopping page. He then looked at the time and it was 9:18 in the morning. He walked to a cafe nearby. There were a larger variety of coffee beans here as compared to Earth. There were 390 types of coffee beans and most of the cafes served more than 100 types of coffee beverages and at least 20 to 30 types of coffee beans. Lin Huang ordered a black coffee and sat by the window. He always loved the smell of coffee in the morning. When he was on earth, he had coffee very often as he had early mornings that was followed with hard work until late at night. That was the reason why he always ordered black coffee as the bitterness helped him focus and think.While he waited for his coffee, Lin Huang took a look at the map of the wild zones that were around Carefree City. He planned to accumulate the Life Power in his body to upgrade himself to an iron-level rank-3 within the next couple of days. Carefree City was surrounded by mostly level-1 wild zone while level-2 wild zones were 200 kilometers away. As he looked at the map, a pretty waitress came to him with his coffee.\u201cSir, would you like sugar with your coffee?\u201d\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he replied. Lin Huang then sniffed the aroma of the coffee softly. The coffee smelled was much stronger than the kind he had on earth. He took a sip. Almost instantly, he frowned deeply, but not because it tasted bad. It was too bitter! It was comparable to berberine tea, which was the most bitter tasting thought that came to mind.\u201cThe coffee beans are so different from types of coffee on earth,\u201d Lin Huang mumbled to himself but he insisted not to add sugar to it.He then proceeded to look at the map and soon he found the place he wanted to go.\u201cGrimace Valley looks good. A level-2 wild zone and it is big enough. The mountains on both sides are also level-2 wild zones. There should be at least 10,000 bronze-level monsters over there. It\u2019s more than 200 kilometers from Carefree City. It would only take 10 minutes by riding the Alexandrian Eagle. I can come back to the hotel to rest whenever I\u2019m tired and that\u2019s so much better than sleeping in a tent in the wild\u2026\u201dAfter he finished his coffee, he paid for it and summoned the Viridian Wolf. He then rode to the foothold in the west. The waitress who brought Lin Huang coffee was cleaning the table when she saw Lin Huang summoning the Viridian Wolf. She screamed!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Another service crew member turned around and asked.\u201cThat customer is an Imperial Censor!\u201d\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you saw?\u201d he asked, as he looked around and saw nothing. Lin Huang had left too quickly, by the time the other staff members had gathered, they did not see him so they laughed and shook their heads.\u201cIt\u2019s true! I saw him riding a gigantic green wolf when he left,\u201d she stuttered between gasps.\u201cXiao Liu, you should really stop reading those web novels,\u201d the cafe owner said, shaking his head.\u201cYou guys need to stop accusing Xiao Liu,\u201d an old man said as he stood up with his stick, \u201cI saw the young man too. He really summoned a bronze-level rank-1 Viridian Wolf without a monster taming token. He was obviously an Imperial Censor. He looked like he was only 15 or 16 and that was my first time seeing such a young Imperial Censor,\u201d he continued.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe old man was a regular customer at the cafe. The staff did not dare say another word when they heard the old man talking about Lin Huang.\u201cSince Old Jia saw it too, then it must be true,\u201d the cafe owner said, relenting on his previous statement.Lin Huang did not know what had happened at the cafe. He rode on his huge emerald Viridian Wolf, and those who saw him on the road were envious of him. When he got out of the West Gate, he recalled the Viridian Wolf, summoned the Alexandrian Eagle and flew towards Grimace Valley.\u201cAn Alexandrian Eagle!\u201d A hunter of a group exclaimed as they passed by and saw Lin Huang summon the Alexandrian Eagle. Some of them recognized it as a mutated monster and were immediately struck with fear in their eyes. They then jumped aside to hide from the danger. It was only when Lin Huang was completely out of sight did a hunter come out of hiding said, \u201cSuch a young Imperial Censor\u2026 I\u2019m not sure which royal family he\u2019s from. I guess it\u2019s all fated that way. Some people have better lives than others\u2026\u201d he said with a heavy sigh.The journey from West Gate to Grimace Valley took less than 15 minutes. As the Alexandrian Eagle landed, Lin Huang recalled it immediately and summoned Bai and Charcoal. He rode on Charcoal\u2019s back the rest of the way. Bai and Charcoal then started their parade of merciless killing in the valley\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as he had adequate Life Power, his combat level would be upgraded directly. Under normal conditions an ordinary person would require at least two months to complete the entire advancement process despite having adequate Life Crystals when they undergo Life Skill training.Bai\u2019s and Black Charcoal\u2019s Life Wheel were in sync, enabling all of the Life Power from killing a monster to be transferred to Lin Huang\u2019s body because Bai and Black Charcoal\u2019s Life Power was full.Although Lin Huang could only get around three columns of Life Power every time a monster was killed, he could fill a total of 1080 columns of Life Power within half a day.Thanks to the advancement in Lin Huang\u2019s combat level to iron-level rank-3, Bai and Charcoal were also upgraded to bronze-level.In Lin Huang\u2019s body, there was a duplicate Life Wheel from the Life Power Storage Card he used. The duplicate Life Wheel began to store Life Power once Lin Huang\u2019s Life Power in his original Life Wheel was full.On the afternoon of the sixth day, the Life Power columns of both Life Wheels were finally full.Eventually, Lin Huang stopped the slaughter and summoned the Alexandrian Eagle to fly back to Carefree City.Within those few days, he had managed to store at least 1,300 bronze-level carcasses. He paid 17 million credit points to expand the capacity of his storage space to 20,000 cubic meters so he could store more carcasses.However, he was not going to the Hunter Association at Carefree City to sell these carcasses. A few days ago, he was only an iron-level rank-1 hunter and he was now iron-level rank-3. If he were to sell the carcasses at the same place, people would be suspicious of his unusually drastic upgrade.However, as they landed at the west entrance to the foothold, they bumped into the hunter team they met a few days ago.He did not notice them but the group of hunters remembered him.Lin Huang entered the foothold as he recalled the Alexandrian Eagle and summoned the Viridian Wolf instead. The hunters gazed at each other when they saw this.\u201cIs he the imperial censor we met the other day? He\u2019s able to summon two monsters at such a young age!\u201d\u201cBrother, this is not the point. Look at his combat ability. He was only iron-level rank-1 a few days ago. He\u2019s capable enough to upgrade himself to iron-level rank-3 within a few days!\u201d The bearded leader said in fear, \u201cThe Alexandrian Eagle\u2019s ability has also been upgraded to its original level which is bronze-level rank-3.\u201d\u201cDamn! He levels up extremely fast!\u201d The rest of them said.\u201cPerhaps only royalty possess Life Skills with such terrifying effects\u2026\u201d The bearded leader said with a sigh.Lin Huang did not know he had met those people before.He went back to the hotel by riding the Viridian Wolf. After taking his bath and lunch, he went out to look for some delicious food for Lin Xin. He was looking for famous food at Carefree City these few nights and he had jotted down the locations of the shops he found.He planned to come back earlier in the afternoon as he wanted to buy Lin Xin some food. However, the Life Power was absorbed faster than he had expected. He was half a day ahead of his schedule. Therefore, he could spend more time doing his own things.Riding the Viridian Wolf, Lin Huang visited more than 30 shops. He ordered two takeaway sets from each of the famous foodstalls.As soon as he finished visiting all of the shoplots, the sky became darker.Lin Huang remembered that there was a roadside foodstall he visited with Leng Yuexin before. There were two specialty dishes.It was so crowded there.When he got there, the boss recognized him and waived at Lin Huang.Lin Huang walked towards him with a puzzled expression. The boss asked cheekily, \u201cDid you get back with your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cUncle, the girl who came together with me that day was not my girlfriend\u2026\u201d Lin Huang could not believe that the uncle remembered them.\u201cAh alright, I\u2019m not going to talk about it then. What\u2019re you going to order today? I\u2019ll offer you 20% discount on all dishes.\u201d The boss said generously.\u201cA set of steak to dine in and two sets of tenderloin and steak, takeaway please.\u201d Lin Huang ordered.\u201cDamn! You even ordered takeaway. I should have said 10% discount\u2026\u201d The boss was generous but he did not think Lin Huang would buy so much from his shop!\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll pay the full amount. I know it\u2019s not easy to gain profit in a business.\u201d Lin Huang offered.\u201cA man must keep his word. I promised to offer you a 20% discount and I keep my promises.\u201d He then continued, \u201cIf your friends happened to visit Carefree City, do recommend them my humble stall.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll recommend you to them for sure.\u201d Lin Huang nodded his head and smiled.While Lin Huang was enjoying his juicy steak, he was reminded of his dinner here with Leng Yuexin from the last time they visited this uncle\u2019s stall.\u201cI wonder how she\u2019s doing now\u2026\u201dLin Huang paid for his takeaways after finishing his dinner.He realized that it was almost nine o\u2019clock at night when he got back to his hotel room.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang was indeed tired but felt a sense of fulfilment with his growth and achievement in the past few hectic days.He verified the confirmation message that he received upon booking the flight ticket of the Demonic Crystal Spaceship while lying on the sofa. The flight would depart on 8.40 a.m. After reading some news, it was 10 o\u2019clock at night. He washed up and went to bed.The next morning, Lin Huang was awake at around 7.40 a.m. After taking his bath, he packed his stuff and left.He checked out after having his breakfast and he went to an outdoor caf\u00e9 nearby. He ordered a cup of coffee while he waited for the spaceship to arrive.The spaceship arrived on time at 8.40 a.m. and he boarded.

He redeemed a total of 500 million credit points from 1,300 bronze-level monsters. These carcasses were ranked from bronze-level rank-1 to bronze-level rank-3.Lin Huang did not stay any longer at Baqi City and left the city from the south gate of the foothold once he had redeemed his points. He summoned his Alexandrian Eagle and flew towards Wulin Town.Lin Huang finally arrived at Wulin Town at around 2.30 p.m.Upon arriving at Street No.101, Lin Huang saw the house but he was not used to the newly furnished house.He scanned the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring before entering his house. Lin Xin\u2019s shoes were not there as she was at school.Lin Huang put on his slippers and entered the house. He realized that his house was quite clean, which means Lin Xin did the house chores while she stayed alone at home.He took a bottle of green leave juice from the fridge and returned to rest on the couch in the living room.He had been extremely busy for the past 20 days.He did not have sufficient rest for the past 10 days as he was preparing for the Reserve Hunter assessment. After returning home for around three days, he went to the level-4 wild zone of Wangyou Forest so that he can level up to iron-level. Furthermore, he spent six and a half days at Grimace Valley to polish his Life Power. He would leave early and come home late every day like a machine.Now that he finally got home, he decided to take a good break before leveling himself to bronze-level.The Life Power in his iron Life Wheel overflowed and it was not completely stable yet and so he considered upgrading to bronze-level after a few months of rest so that things could settle down.Upgrading to the next level when the Life Power in his body was unstable would cause a leak in Life Power. Even a mild leakage could cause failure in the upgrade, leading to substantial reduction in Life Power. For serious cases, it could range from a violent rage to an explosion increasing the chances of death.Of course, there must be a way to reduce the settlement period of the Life Power. It could be done by practicing Life Skills. Higher leveled Life Skills will accumulate Life Power quicker shortening the settlement period of Life Power.\u201cIt seemed like it\u2019s the right time to choose a set of Life Skills now.\u201d He placed the green leaves juice back on the tea table looked for information on various Life Skills.There were only three types of Life Skills available in the markets which were low, medium and high level.The low-level Life Skills were so expensive that one would have to buy it with at least a few million credit points. The price for a mid-level Life Skill was around 30 million and above and high-level Life Skill would cost between 300 to 500 million credit points.If there were attributes associated with the Life Skill, the price would be 10 times higher or even more.There was a piece of news he heard about an auction on one of the web pages. It was a high-level Life Skill:\u00a0Ice Tactics\u00a0. An anonymous person bought it for 880 million credit points.As reported by the news, the Life Skill was described as a high-leveled Life Skill imbued with the element of ice. Practicing Life Power with this kind of Life Skill would allow one to use the elemental power with one\u2019s Life Power. Once it reaches a certain level, the Life Power would turn enemies into ice., one would carry its ice feature in his Life power. When it reached a certain level, the Life Power would turn enemies into ice.This description reminded Lin Huang about Xue Luo. However, he was sure that even if\u00a0Ice Tactics\u00a0\u00a0was trained to its ultimate level, it would never be on par with Xue Luo\u2019s abilities.Life Skill that beyond these high-level Life Skills would be the ultimate Life Skill. Life Skills of this level would not be available on the market. It was an item that the members of the royal family would usually fight for. Lin Huang had no clue about its price. It should be at least 10 times the price of a high-level Life Skill or possibly even more.Lin Huang did not find a suitable Life Skill even after browsing the net for more than an hour.Lin Huang hesitated for a while and called Yi Zheng as he was best qualified to speak on this issue.The notification rang twice and a video feed of Yi Zheng\u2019s appeared.\u201cHey man, are you calling the wrong number? Aren\u2019t you supposed to call my sister?\u201d Yi Zheng was wearing a white robe and looked like he just woke up.\u201cThere\u2019s something that makes you seem better looking.\u201d Lin Huang said.\u201cYeah, I like this. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019re such a good flatterer!\u201d Yi Zheng looked pleased and said, \u201cYou can ask me whatever now.\u201d\u201cI want to know how I should choose a Life Skill and you\u2019re the best person to ask for advice about these kinds of things,\u201d Lin Huang pleaded.\u201cI have forgotten that you\u2019re iron-level now. Did you kill the Six-Armed Demon or the other monster?\u201d Yi Zhen asked.\u201cIt is the Six-Armed Demon\u201d Lin Huang replied. In fact, the monster that Lin Huang killed was the mutated demon that wore a purple dress.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were capable of that. You\u2019re quite the skillful man!\u201d Yi Zheng sounded surprised.\u201cOkay, back to the topic. It\u2019s actually not difficult to choose a Life Skill. First of all, you have to test the Life Power on your body to check what element it leans towards. Then, choose a Life Skill compatible with the element of your Life Power. However, most people have Life Power without any elemental attributes and will only obtain it later by practicing with Life Skills. In some cases, choosing a Life Skill with similar attributes would\u00a0be an advantage.\u201cYou must have read the news about the Life Skill\u00a0Ice Tactics\u00a0yesterday. For instance, both of them were training for\u00a0Ice Tactics\u00a0. If one was born with the Life Power without an elemental attribute, his casting speed for\u00a0\u00a0Ice Tacticswould be one. Similarly, the speed of Life Power accumulation and the power ofIce Tactics\u00a0would also be one. However, if another person was born with Life Power imbued with the element of ice which would allow it to sync with\u00a0Ice Tactics\u00a0, the cast speed for\u00a0Ice Tactics\u00a0would be increased by three-fold or even more by three-fold or more. The same goes for the Life Power accumulation and the activation. Therefore, compatible elemental attributes and Life Skills are pretty important.\u201d\u201cIf your Life Power naturally does not have any elemental attributes, I would recommend you choose\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0. Though it is only a high-level Life Skill, if you\u2019re able to reach the sixth level, its power would be on par with that of an ultimate Life Skill.\u201d Yi Zheng\u2018s explanation was very detailed.\u201cHow much would this\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0\u00a0cost?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking about the price? Isn\u2019t it there\u2019s an \u201cArmy Attack Tactics\u201d training crystal in the reward given to you earlier? Did you not receive the parcel?\u201d Yi Zheng was curious.\u201cWhich parcel are you referring to?\u201d Lin Huang asked, confused.\u201cIt\u2019s the reward for the monster horde incident given by the Hunter Association and the government. It\u2019s rewarded to everyone who stayed there to help. Yeyu and I intentionally reported that you\u2019re the one who helped out the most in the incident. The leader heard that you\u2019re going to upgrade to the iron-level and rewarded you with an\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0training crystal.\u201d Yi Zheng explained patiently. \u201cIt was sent out a week ago and I just received mine last week. I\u2019ll ask for you if you haven\u2019t received it yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll ask my sister about it later because I just got home today. She might have kept it for me. If she didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll check the location of the parcel via the courier service database.\u201d Lin Huang responded and then further added, \u201cOh yea, you mentioned about the innate attribute of Life Power just now. How do I test it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a Reserve Hunter now. It can be tested for free at any of the footholds of the Hunter Association or you could purchase a tester from the net. It\u2019s user-friendly and cheap. It only costs tens of thousands credit points. However, I would recommend you take your test at the Hunter Association\u2019s foothold because you\u2019ll get a detailed report after you do. At the same time, your abilities will be updated as well. Since you\u2019ve upgraded to the iron-level, you might as well update your personal information.\u201d Yi Zheng adviced.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll spare some time to test the attribute of my Life Power and then decide if I should choose\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0. I\u2019ll call you again if there\u2019s any other problem.\u201dLin Huang hung up the phone and immediately bought a Life Power tester from the net because he did not want to update his combat abilities at the Hunter Association. He had been upgraded to iron-level rank-3 without any Life Skills. It would be a big problem to him if the others found out about this.After placing his order, Lin Xin arrived home from school.She was so happy when she saw Lin Huang as she entered the house. \u201cBrother, when did you come back?\u201d\u201cI arrived here at around 2.30 p.m.\u201d Lin Huang closed the web page of the news, stood up and walked towards the kitchen.\u201d What would you like to eat for dinner? I bought you only the most delicious dishes. Come, have a look and choose which you like.\u201dLin Xin changed her slippers and saw 10 takeaway boxes as she entered the kitchen.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d She pointed at one of the boxes and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s fried snake. Its main ingredient is the snake flesh cut into pieces. Its fried and spicy.\u201d\u201cHow about that?\u201d Lin Xin pointed at another box and asked.\u201cWeird tasting Takoyaki. Its main ingredient is squid tentacle with seasonings and are ball-shaped. It\u2019s baked and not fried, though.\u201d\u201cHow about this?\u201d\u201cGhostwhisper. It\u2019s ghostwhisper\u2019s tongue, cut into thin slices before being fried.\u201d\u2026After asking about each dish\u2019s ingredients, she picked her top three favorites. Lin Huang cooked some rice and heated up the dishes for dinner.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter having their dinner, Lin Huang asked, \u201cXin Er, have you received any parcels lately?\u201d\u201cYes, three of them.

The parcel that Leng Yuexin sent him was packaged properly.There was a storage ring inside the parcel. It was not the one that Li Yanxing had.There was a small note with a fragrant smell inside the parcel and there were eight numbers written on it. It was probably the password that Leng Yuexin gave him to unlock the ring.Lin Huang entered the password according to the numbers on the small note on the login page.Upon verifying the password, an authentication to prove his identity was needed. Lin Huang figured that Yuexin had intentionally set it that way just in case the parcel was stolen or got lost.Lin Huang scanned his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring and verified his identity. Lin Huang\u2019s identity was automatically bound to the system and the storage ring she gave him became his exclusive storage ring.He immediately checked on the storage ring\u2019s internal information.The storage ring had a very large storage capacity of 100,000 cubic meters. If he were to expand the storage capacity of the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring to this level, he had to spend 100 million credit points for the expansion. The Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring that Lin Huang was wearing now was only at 20,000 cubic meters.Nonetheless, he noticed that only a few things were stored inside.There were hundreds of complete Life Crystals and thousands of Life Crystal pieces. Along with those were hundreds of weapon rings inside the storage ring.The last few items in the ring made Lin Huang\u2019s breath quicken as these items were placed separately within the storage ring.There was a black sword that Lin Huang had seen Li Yanxing used before. It was a relic. Aside from the sword, there was a silver armor and a pair of black leather boots.Lin Huang could neither activate these three relics with his current Life Power nor could it be kept in his body as well but he could use this sword to kill monsters in the future. Though he would not be able to use it to its full potential with his Life Power, its sharpness alone was enough.A Golden Card was placed not far away from the three relics.\u201cIs it a Credit Point Storage Card?\u201d Lin Huang looked at the card and immediately recognized what it was.\u201cNon-binding Credit Point Storage Card detected. Would you like to bind it?\u201d A page suddenly popped up from the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring.\u201cBind it.\u201dAfter a short while, the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring released a beam of light that shone on the Golden Card.\u201cScanning of card\u2019s information is now complete. Binding\u2026 Binding is complete. Would you like to integrate the card into your personal account? After integration, your credit point account will be upgraded to a VIP account and you will be eligible to enjoy discounts on certain merchandise.\u201d\u201cIntegrate it then.\u201d Lin Huang nodded his head. He trusted items from Leng Yuexin.\u201cIntegration is complete. Your personal account has been upgraded to a VIP account.\u00a0Your account balance is 38.155 billion credit points.\u201d\u201c38.155 billion?!\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s eyes popped. He could only redeem one billion credit points after collecting carcasses for a few days. Lin Huang was shocked to see Li Yanxing\u2019s credit point balance.Lin Huang thought of it again, even billions of credit points and a few relics meant nothing to him. How terrifying was the power of the Leng\u2019s family?The Leng family would definitely know that Leng Yuexin had Li Yanxing\u2019s storage ring with her. Otherwise, they would not negotiate with the Li family to unlock the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring. It was impossible that the Leng family did not know that she gave all of the items in Li Yanxing\u2019s storage ring to him. Since Leng\u2019s family agreed to give him these treasures, it probably meant nothing to Leng\u2019s family or perhaps they were a sign of an apology.After integrating the golden Credit Point Storage Card and the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring, it vaporized and disappeared. He had no idea what was it was made of.He stored the Credit Point Storage Card and wore the delicate storage ring on his left pinky. He then proceeded to unwrap the second parcel.The second parcel was sent by the Hunter Association. Inside, there was a black stone, the size of a fist. It contained a thumb-sized crystal chip\u00a0and a\u00a0bronze token that was half the size of half his palm.Lin Huang could recognize that the bronze token was a decree that allowed them to have access to Bronze Hunter related activities. When the token was issued, it would be processed by the Hunter Association and there would be no follow-up procedures.When Lin Huang received this, he knew that he had been upgraded to bronze-level in the Hunter Association. It was the level of a regular hunter and he was no longer just a Reserve Hunter. He could access all information a Bronze Hunter could.However, the upgrade did not mean that Lin Huang had become a true Bronze Hunter. Tasks that other Bronze Hunters could take on, he could only see the information and could not accept. He also could not enjoy the benefits given to Bronze Hunters as well.Aside from the bronze token, the black stone was probably the cultivated crystal for\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0.Lin Huang was not sure of the elemental attributes of his Life Power. Therefore, he dared not practice it yet.He then looked at the thumb-sized crystal chip. He only knew that it was a message chip recognized by the Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring. Lin Huang had no clue what the inside of the chip contained.He scanned it with his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring and an image was projected onto Lin Huang\u2019s room.There was a muscular, middle-aged man practicing a set of techniques in the projected image. It was giving off a deadly aura. Lin Huang noticed that each of the attacks were fatal. It seemed to be a military technique.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt took him 20 minutes to complete practicing the technique.In the projected image, the middle-aged man then began to speak. \u201cThe name of this close combat technique is called\u00a0Fatal Tactic\u00a0\u00a0and it\u2019s meant to be used with\u00a0Army Attack Tactic\u00a0\u00a0until one reaches gold-level\u2026\u201d\u201cThis combat technique is quite good, though.\u201dActually, without listening to the man\u2019s description, Lin Huang already knew that it was a rare combat technique. With the assistance of the teaching projection, he would be able to master the technique and accumulate the necessary cards. Although he majored in sword\u00a0techniques, it would be great if he could master this combat skill.He kept all his stuff in the storage space. Lin Huang got up and walked towards Lin Xin\u2019s room on the third floor. \u201cLin Xin, could you please lend me the \u2018Gun Master\u2019 game ring? I want to assess the current level of my skills.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a small room with a height of 2.5 meters. In fact, it employed spatial compression technology to make the room look small on the outside even if it had a significantly larger interior. It had an area of more than 10,000 meter squared and its height was about 100 meters or so.Spatial compression technology was also known as temporary spatial compression. This was still considered new technology and was still not widely known or used by commoners.The so called temporary spatial compression method was actually a temporary compression of spatial dimension within n a specific period of time and should it exceed that time period, it would expand back to its original size.The game cabin was only had a floor space of 10 meters squared and once the game was activated, the game cabin would utilize temporary spatial compression to increase the play-space but it was limited to only 12 hours per day. Therefore, a game cabin was not suitable for item storage.Lin Huang brought the game ring along with him into the game cabin and the virtual game world appeared before him.Lin Huang peeped into Lin Xin\u2019s temporary account which was still logged in.Lin Huang was stunned because Lin Xin\u2019s had a really good stats in her account.It did not matter if it was a fixed, moving or multiple targets before her, she did very well in all categories, even shooting at targets that would appear in random locations.Lin Huang clicked a few buttons to look for records of actual combat she did in-game and was astonished by what he saw.Though the accumulated points were not too high in the first few rounds, she did a lot better after that. She won the title of best player in most of the battles.\u201cWith her physique, it was kind of unbelievable that she could achieve such a standard. She was born to become a gunmaster!\u201d Lin Huang never knew that his sister was so talented.After watching Lin Xin\u2019s performance, he logged out of her account and registered for a new account.The game ring began to scan Lin Huang\u2019s body and recorded the information to create the new character.After the registration was completed, the game user interface appeared once again.Lin Huang noticed that there were no records found in the new account and it was not linked to Lin Xin\u2019s previous account.When he was choosing the gun model, he chose the BlackEagle33 because he was good at it.He held the gun in his hand. It was as if there were no differences between the one he was holding and the real thing.Lin Huang then entered the training mode.It began with fixed target shooting. His surroundings had automatically morphed into a shooting range and a target appeared before him, at a distance of 200 meters.Lin Huang fired 10 consecutive shots and all of the shots hit the bullseye.The next target appeared. Lin Huang lifted his gun and shot at it\u2026Lin Huang felt as if he was using a real gun. Even the bullet\u2019s trajectory and recoil force felt exactly like an actual Black Eagle33. He began to gain interest in this game.After practicing his shooting for 20 minutes, Lin Huang morphed the BlackEagle33 into its sniper form.When a different gun was used, the shooting range would change accordingly. The target was now located further, at a distance of 500 meters.Lin Huang aimed at the target and activated the Life Power in his body causing a bullet to fire. The bullet penetrated through the virtual target in the center, forming a hole.The second target immediately appeared. Lin Huang took aim at the second target and shot at it\u2026Lin Huang was done warming up after practicing his sniping for 20 minutes. He switched his firearm back into a pistol and started the next assessment.The shooting range morphed once again. A moving target appeared at a distance of 200 meters.Lin Huang pulled the trigger the moment the target appeared.The second target was no longer moving at a constant speed. Still, Lin Huang fired.\u2026After the shooting practice, Lin Huang went on with his sniper again.After half an hour, he began the next round of training. The number of targets in the shooting range increased and had different movements assigned to each of them. Some of them were faster while some of them were slower. There were even targets that were not moving in a straight line\u2026However, all these did not scare Lin Huang. Shots were continuously fired and he hit all of the targets.Soon, he entered a more difficult level. Fourth round \u2013 random shooting.All the targets would randomly appear for mere seconds before Lin Huang\u2019s 180-degree view.The level of difficulty of this assessment was quite high. When Lin Huang graduated from the Hunter Reserve College, he did not get full marks for his gun assessment because he had lost one mark in this category.However, Lin Huang was confident that he could easily pass this assessment. His physique was not only stronger but the speed of his hands had also improved after he gotten his Life Seed Skill.The 10-minute random shooting assessment ended very quickly. Lin Huang scored full marks and passed the assessment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang aced all four assessments perfectly. Lin Huang felt that it was reasonable for him to score full marks because of his strength and physique.Upon completing this assessment, Lin Huang selected actual combat and chose a random battle to join.The virtual environment in the game cabin quickly shifted to an actual combat map. There were a variety of buildings, different modes of transportation, and even the virtual passer-bys.The opponents were randomly matched for several rounds and Lin Huang scored the highest in each round. He was undefeated throughout the rounds. After playing for a few rounds, Lin Huang finally discovered that the physique level of regular people was different from his. Since he was in a room filled with ordinary opponents, he was able to attack without so much as a single worry. The battle quickly became meaningless and unfulfilling for him.\u201cIt seems like I have to enter the hunter rooms where I can battle with actual hunters as my opponents. I can only become stronger if my opponents are stronger than I am.\u201d Lin Huang looked at the time and it was nine o\u2019clock at night. It was still early. He immediately logged out of the normal room and logged into the hunter\u2019s room\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please select your zone to begin combat.\u201d\u201cI choose the firearm zone.\u201d Lin Huang saw the advertisements for the mixed battle zone. There were a variety of weapons there but Lin Huang wanted to battle against stronger opponents instead. A virtual map then popped up onto the projected game interface, showing eight maps that were available for selection.Lin Huang noticed that one of the maps had a combination of Chinese and western buildings. He found it interesting and chose that map.\u201cConfirm selection of Lijiang Tower\u201d\u201cThere will be two teams in the Lijiang Tower combat mode. Six players will be assigned to each team and players are distinguishable based on the color labels on top of the players\u2019 heads. Team members are white while opponents are colored red.

The map is now being generated.\u201dWithin a short while, the virtual environment before Lin Huang changed. The spacious game cabin was transformed into a night-time city environment.\u201cWelcome to Lijiang Tower!\u201dHis team members appeared one after the other.\u201cAre there any first-time players?\u201d A tall man glanced around and his gaze landed on Lin Huang\u2019s ID which was placed above his head.The rest of them shook their heads. Lin Huang was the only one who raised his hand. \u201cI just bought my game ring today.\u201dEveryone suddenly seemed displeased. A new player could easily become a burden to the team in this game, an easy target for the opponents.\u201cFollow me then and morph your weapon to its rifle form and use automatic-fire.\u201d The tall man frowned when he saw Lin Huang holding a BlackEagle33.\u201cI\u2019m not going to change anything. I\u2019m used to attacking with the BlackEagle33.\u201d Lin Huang shook his head.\u201cKid, just change it for the sake of the team. Don\u2019t be selfish. The speed and the shooting distance of that pistol is no match for a rifle. You\u2019re a newbie and you\u2019re not used to this game yet. Please don\u2019t be a burden to the team.\u201d The 40-year-old man was rude indeed. The ID above his head said, \u201cMan in his forties is a flower in bloom\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ll try a few shots first. If I can\u2019t manage it, I\u2019ll change my weapon to a rifle.\u201d Lin Huang insisted.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, stop talking about it. You\u2019re given two chances. If you die without a kill, you\u2019re changing your weapon.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Huang compromised.He was confident with his technique. Although he might not be able to defeat all the players in the iron zone, he at least believed that he would not be killed twice and would at least get a kill!\u201cI\u2019ll bring him to the night market. The four of you please go to the courtyard.\u201d The tall man gave his instructions. None of them disagreed with him because truthfully, no one was willing to bring Lin Huang to the night market.Lin Huang kept quiet. It was fine if no one was going to accompany him. He preferred wandering around on his own\u00a0so he could familiarize himself with the map. Of all the people there, he did not think that it would be the tall man who would lead him there instead, especially after the heated debate about them wanting him to change weapons.The player ID of the tall man was \u2018I\u2019m the tall and mighty man\u2019.Walking behind the tall man, Lin Huang looked at his player ID and he furrowed his brows. \u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s tall, but\u2026 Mighty? Was the word \u2018Mighty\u2019 referring to his performance in the game or something else?\u201dBrother Mighty did not know that Lin Huang was laughing at his player ID. He explained to Lin Huang as he walked, \u201cBased Lijiang Tower\u2019s map, it seems that there are not many buildings here. The battleground is separated into two main areas. One is the courtyard, the area where the four of them are headed to now and the second area is the night market, where we\u2019re headed towards now. The courtyard has a better field of view with a bridge there while the night market has more shelters. With the way the night market is designed, the best weapon to use here would be a sniper rifle\u2026\u201dSince Lin Huang was using a BlackEagle33, Brother Mighty told him to attack using its sniper form so he does not get killed so easily.It was night-time and the virtual map was brightly lit.Lin Huang observed his surroundings as he listened to Brother Mighty\u2019s explanation.Although he knew that it was just a virtual scene in the game, he was hungry because of the many food stalls in the market.He casually took a grilled squid from one of the stalls. The squid was still hot and it had a burnt aroma to it, it felt so real! He was astounded at how advanced this game was.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang walked with Brother Mighty and together, they passed by several restaurants. He attempted to familiarize himself with the dynamics here. Just as he was walking out of a shop selling steamed buns, a gunshot from a sniper went off.Brother Mighty\u2019s s head exploded and his body collapsed to the ground.Lin Huang did not run away. Instead, he rushed out of the shop and activatedCloud Steps\u00a0, moving around a short distance. He lifted his pistol and shot upwards, towards the high ground of the night market that Brother Mighty mentioned just now.There was a woman wearing a tight, black leather outfit on the high grounds of the night market, using a skill similar to his. Lin Huang saw that she was using the same type of weapon he had \u2013 a BlackEagle33.After a few consecutive shots, Lin Huang\u2019s expression changed. He would never have thought he would meet a pro in his very first battle and of all the zones, he had to meet her in the iron zone\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the BlackEagle33 in her hand morphed into a pistol, she made a few consecutive attacks at Lin Huang instead.Lin Huang easily dodged her shots.When Lin Huang shot back, the woman moved as swift as a ghost. She was on par with Lin Huang\u2019s\u00a0Cloud Steps\u00a0or if Lin Huang would admit it, she was probably even better than he was. The few shots he fired did not even graze her leather armor.Both of their attacks were fired lighting fast and they instantly realized that they had encountered strong opponents \u2013 each other.None of them were willing to retreat and within a few seconds, their attacks became more intense. Lin Huang used this opportunity to train himself.The woman in leather clothing seemed happy, perhaps due to the fact that it was rare to encounter a similarly strong opponent in the iron zone.A grin formed on her fair face and her waist-length black hair followed her curves. She was so graceful even when she dodged his attacks. Lin Huang, on the other hand, looked serious and was worried all the time but he seemed to do it all effortlessly, his skill light and graceful.Both of them continued to attack each other at a distance of around 100 meters and yet none of them were hit by their opponent\u2019s attack.The people who watched were amazed at their movement speed. The reason why they could avoid the bullets was because they had astonishing predictive abilities. Both of their eyes had never once left each other\u2019s body. They were able to capture the subtle changes in their opponents\u2019 muscles just before they attacked.Under such circumstances, they were able to predict each other\u2019s moment of attack and dodge in the nick of time. If they were a tenth of a second slower, they would be hit.The fight lasted for only a few minutes before it ended; not because either of them was hit by a bullet but because there were other players who had now entered the battle.The first player who entered was the woman\u2019s companion. He was short and fat. Before he was able to react, a bullet penetrated his head between his eyebrows and he collapsed instantly.Of course, it was Lin Huang who fired that shot. His speed was terribly fast.The second player who joined the fight was Brother Mighty. He was Lin Huang\u2019s partner.As soon as Brother Mighty respawned, he hurried to the place where he died. He had no clue about what had just happened. After watching the video on playback, he found out that he had been shot by a lady aged between 16 or 17. He went back to the battleground to help Lin Huang.He was still far away and could only hear the sound of shots fired every few seconds. He excitedly muttered, \u201cThe guy had not died yet?!\u201d He recognized the gun that was being used \u2013 the BlackEagle33.He rushed in the direction of the sound using a different route. This way, he could see the high ground of the night market with better clarity and protect his back from being shot again.\u201cHow dare this fellow get me with a sneak attack? I\u2019ll let you know how it feels like, getting shot in the head!\u201d Brother Mighty grinned as he exited yet another restaurant.He popped his head from behind the wall and he could see the woman in leather armor from afar.As soon as he was about to pull his trigger, he blacked out, again.Lin Huang noticed Brother Mighty popping his head from behind the wall and once again, he witnessed the lady in leather shooting him. She did it in the same way Lin Huang shot down the fat guy, between his eyebrows.Lin Huang shook his head as he knew that she was determined to compete with him.However, Lin Huang and the woman had never expected that something peculiar was going to happen on that battlefield\u2026After Brother Mighty was shot and had watched the video on playback, he realized that the woman was powerful. However, Lin Huang had yet to be sent back to the respawn point. Instead, it was the backbone of his companions, the middle-aged man with the player ID of \u2018Man in his forties is a flower in bloom\u2019 who appeared at the respawn point.Brother Mighty immediately told the middle-aged man that there was a woman who could very well be a gunmaster at the night market. They then proceeded to the night market together.At the opponent\u2019s respawn point, when the short and fat guy respawned, there were two other people there. He then told them that there was a young man in the opposing team. Three of them rushed to the night market, planning to kill Lin Huang.Soon, the night market that initially began with only two of them was now crowded.As soon as the three of them appeared, including the short and fat guy, Lin Huang made three consecutive shots and immediately, they were sent back to the respawn point.On the other side, Brother Mighty and the middle-aged man were shot by the woman right after they appeared. They were sent back to the respawn point as well.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Everyone was curious. On playback, they saw the scene when Lin Huang made three consecutive shots and all three shots fired hit them right in the middle, between their eyebrows.At the respawn point, Brother Mighty and the middle-aged man were watching the same replay and they exhaled loudly. They were amazed by how powerful the woman was and at the same time, they had finally witnessed Lin Huang\u2019s ability.\u201cWe might have met a true gunmaster!\u201d They exclaimed at the same time.Indeed, many hunters were obsessed with firearms but not all of them can be a gunmaster.The main purpose of the Gun Master Assessment was to evaluate how they used a firearm. It was not really related to the candidate\u2019s ability. Though it was a beginner-level assessment, many of today\u2019s Gold Hunters were not able to pass the assessment at some point in the past. Yi Yeyu was one of them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith the hunter zone opening in Gun Master, many gun-obsessed-hunters were motivated to join. They hoped to brush up on their firearm skills through virtual combat instead of dying in actual battle. Besides, they may just have a chance of meeting an actual gunmaster which would be a good learning experience for them.They suspected that this was a battle between two gunmasters.\u201cHey guys, there might be two gunmasters fighting at the night market. Stop fighting and let\u2019s watch the battle between them!\u201d Brother Mighty and his team shouted at the video.At the opposing camp, the short, fat guy and his teammate invited more people to witness the memorable fight as well.Two guys who were fighting in the courtyard forfeited their battle and ran towards the night market\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The account was created not long ago, less than a month.Within one month, aside from battles where she was paired with weak teammates, she had never lost a battle. System statistics show that she has a 99% win rate and was awarded as the best player of the game in most battles than the battles which she had weak teammates, she had never lost before.During this period of time, she had met other gunmasters in-game. However, she did not participate much in battles as her opponents would usually choose to avoid her and attack her teammates instead.It was the first time Mu Zimo met an opponent like Lin Huang, who would fight till the end and was reluctant to retreat.She was so excited and did not bother about the outcome of the battle. She wanted to be better than Lin Huang.Lin Huang entered the game for the first time with a simple purpose. He was looking for an opponent who was stronger than him so he could practice his skills. He was not concerned about winning.Their team members arrived at the battleground to see the both of them engaged in a fierce battle.All of them kept their guns and raised their hands, a sign that they were here to watch instead of joining in the fight. They watched quietly.As time passed, both of them became familiar with each other\u2019s combat movements. Soon, they bonded through battle.Lin Huang knew that she was the real deal, a true gunmaster. She had strong fundamentals and it showed in her skills. She was as good as he was. He could not figure out her weaknesses at all.Mu Zimo felt differently about Lin Huang. He had good basics unlike the other players but she could predict his next moves they were just as good as one another. He must be new to Gun Master by the looks of it but he must have come from an academy.She fired even more shots at him and when Lin Huang tried to dodge her attacks, another BlackEagle33 appeared in her left hand.Just then, he could not relax anymore, he knew she meant business this time.Mu Zimo was confident that she could certainly send Lin Huang back to the respawn point. Lin Huang however, had no intentions of retreating.At the\u00a0high ground, Mu Zimo held guns in both her hands, attacking consecutively. Her attack speed was at least 50% faster now.\u201cIt\u2019s a gunfighting technique!\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s pupils dilated as they watched Mu Zimo\u2019s every movement.\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing this skill for a year \u2013 the Twin Flower. I don\u2019t think that you can dodge my bullets anymore!\u201d Mu Zimo finally spoke to Lin Huang.The bullet\u2019s trajectory of her BlackEagle33\u2019s began changing abruptly. It was supposed to be traveling in a straight line. However, following Mu Zimo\u2019s wrist movements, it began to travel in a curved path.She then launched her combo with both guns. Bullets were flying all around her towards Lin Huang, filling the entire area, causing those who were watching the fight to cheer in astonishment.At almost the same time, Lin Huang\u2019s movements changed. He touched the ground with his toe and Spectral Snowsteps was activated. His body rose swiftly into the air, resembling a soaring eagle. He did a somersault in mid-air and landed on the roof of another house.Thanks to Spectral Snowsteps, he managed escaped to escape the area of effect of the gunfighting technique \u2013 Twin Flower.\u201cEh?!\u201d Mu Zimo had never expected that Lin Huang would have different movement skills. It was as fast as the first skill he activated.Lin Huang\u2019s weakness was revealed when she realized that his gun skills were weakened if his opponents used gunfighting techniques.After getting up to the rooftop, he activated Boundless Vision without hesitation. The innate ability of Sly Hand was activated as well. He raised the gun once again and fired multiple shots at Mu Zimo with the fastest attack-speed ever.Thanks to the physique enhancement from Robust, the recoil force had minimal effect on Lin Huang\u2019s body. His regular attack speed was then 10% faster than Mu Zimo\u2019s attack speed. He was terribly fast now.The activation of Boundless Vision allowed Lin Huang to better notice Mu Zimo\u2019s subtle movements.Mu Zimo had almost used up her Life Power when she activated the gunfighting technique. She was caught off-guard when Lin Huang counterattacked with a fearsome attack-speed and she panicked.Brother Mighty and the rest of them were struck by terror. Nobody could avoid such an attack regardless of how good their skills were. They would definitely be sent back to the respawn point.The battle between gunmasters\u00a0was not about movement skills. It was about eyesight and their abilities to predict their opponent\u2019s movements to give them great advantage in their ranged attacks, especially for gunmasters and bowmasters.Lin Huang grinned when Mu Zimo began messing up her movements. Just then, he held the BlackEagle33 in his left hand.He had never practiced using a gun with his left hand so he had no idea how it would turn out but this did not hamper the firing rate of his left hand.The intensity of the Life Power bullets doubled immediately.Mu Zimo was shocked to see Lin Huang holding another gun on his left hand. However, it shocked her that his accuracy was so awful.Since Lin Huang shot randomly, it was rather difficult for Mu Zimo to predict the trajectory of the bullets fired out from the gun in his left hand.Lin Huang\u2019s shooting speed was extremely fast to the point that it made her clumsy. She found it difficult to dodge the attacks, causing her defense to become weaker.\u201cI used up most of my Life Power when I used the gunfighting technique. This fellow is now attacking me at lightning speed and this will\u00a0probably deplete his Life Power. I\u2019ll only need to avoid his attacks for now because movement skills require less Life Power. When his Life Power is exhausted, the victory of this battle will still belong to me!\u201d Mu Zimo planned in her mind.The colorful signboards of the night market made the night in Lijiang Tower much more mysterious.At the night market, the sounds of shooting guns continued and began to sound a lot more like a rifle because Lin Huang kept shooting at her.It had been 10 minutes and Lin Huang\u2019s was still attacking at an extremely high speed. On the other hand, Mu Zimo seemed to have used up most of her Life Power.All of them were comparing Mu Zimo\u2019s gunfighting technique which lasted for only a few seconds but Lin Huang did not seem to have the intention to stop at all.\u201cHow could it be? Even if the skill that he\u2019s did not consume a large amount of Life Power, each bullet fired will require Life Power, especially with such a fast attack speed. How is it possible for him to sustain his attacks for such a long period of time?!\u201d Mu Zimo doubted. Her Life Power could only last her six minutes if she shot her bullets at her fastest speed.It had been more than 10 minutes and Mu Zimo had used up most of her Life Power avoiding the attacks while counterattacking.\u201cIt has ended,\u201d Lin Huang said in a deep voice.He fired out of his left gun to block Mu Zimo\u2019s movements while his other hand shot a bullet at her head.\u201cThis guy\u2026 He sure knows how to use a gun with his left hand!\u201d Mu Zimo was terrified. The next moment, a bullet penetrated her head and her body collapsed in an instant.Brother Mighty gave Lin Huang a thumbs up and said, \u201cBrilliant! Pretending that you have not trained using your left hand to trick the woman into believing you.\u201dLin Huang shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve indeed never practiced with my left hand to shoot guns before this. When I was in the midst of shooting, I familiarized myself with shooting from my left hand. Though my accuracy has improved, my right hand still handles a gun better.\u201d\u201cIt seems that one needs to be talented to become a gunmaster. He was able to familiarize himself with shooting from his left hand in just 10 minutes\u2026\u201d Brother Mighty and the rest of them looked embarrassed.In the midst of the conversation, a notification sound rang.\u201cCounting down\u2026 10, 9, 8\u2026\u201dJust as Lin Huang was about to quit the game, he received a friend request. It was from \u201cFemale Gunslinger 1\u201d.Lin Huang hesitated for a moment but decided to accept her friend request anyway. Now, he had one new friend on his friends\u2019 list which was initially empty.\u201cI hope we\u2019ll have a chance for a rematch soon!\u201d \u2018Female Gunslinger 1\u2019 sent him a message.\u201cSure!\u201d Lin Huang replied.The countdown timer ended as soon as they ended their conversation. Lin Huang saw Lijiang Tower fading from his view.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Huang then returned to the empty game cabin with the results of his battle.\u201cPlayer: Simply a Newbie\u201d\u201cKill Points Gained: 4\u201d\u201cDeath count: 0\u201d\u201cCongratulations!

She clicked on the recorded battle between Lin Huang and her at her desk and watched it again.After a short while, a girl in pink pajamas walked into the room. She looked exactly like Mu Zimo.\u201cSister, what are you watching?\u201d asked the girl in pink pajamas.\u201cI\u2019m watching the recording of the game battle.\u201d Mu Zimo did not turn her head around, her gaze never leaving the projected video.The girl in pink pajamas watched the video together with her from behind. She frowned when she saw how intense Lin Huang\u2019s attack was.After she finished watching the video, Mu Zimo turned back and asked her twin sister, \u201cZixi, what do you think?\u201d\u201cThere is something strange about the columns in his Life Wheel. The number of Life Wheels that he has is different from that of any other person. Based on the frequency of his high-speed attacks, he would need at least three Life Wheels or more in his body to supply such a large amount of Life Power for an attack that lasted this long.\u201d Mu Zixi explained.\u201cI feel the same way!\u201d Mu Zimo felt assured.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he was born with the Six Existential Realm Life Columns with six Life Wheels or the Octadragus Skydragon Life Columns with eight Life Wheels, he is definitely no ordinary person. I wonder which family he\u2019s from, he\u2019s so young\u2026\u201d Mu Zixi said with a smile.\u201cHey, are you making fun of me because I\u2019m not as good as he is?\u201d Mu Zimo rolled her eyes.\u201cWell, firearms have always been your weakness and you\u2019re fighting with a guy with these special Life Columns while your power is restricted to iron-level rank-1. Don\u2019t feel bad for losing the game.\u201d Mu Zixi tried to make her sister feel better.\u201cMy power can only be restricted to iron-level rank-1 since I have the power and speed of a rank-3 hunter even though I\u2019m just a rank-1 hunter. If I were to fight with the combat abilities of a rank-2 or rank-3 hunter, that would be bullying. Besides, the fact that I lost to someone that had the same combat abilities with me proves that my firearm skills can still be improved.\u201d Mu Zimo shook her head as she tried to console herself.\u201cWhy do you waste your time practicing with a gun? You already have the ability to use bows and throwing knives as your ranged attack. You should strive to become a transcendent!\u201d Mu Zixi suggested.\u201cYou do know that there\u2019s no news regarding the transcendent monster that I\u2019ve chosen? Since I have nothing to do now, I might as well practice my gun skills. You\u2019ve been quite free lately, why don\u2019t we play Gun Master together?\u201d Mu Zimo asked.\u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game!\u201d Mu Zixi said with a pout. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201dMu Zimo turned off the video and slept under the covers with Mu Zixi.After a short while, the sound of Mu Zixi yelling at her was heard, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me whenever and wherever you please! Go to sleep!\u201d\u2026It was 10 o\u2019clock at night when Lin Huang left the game cabin.He was quite satisfied with the experience he gained in the game cabin; he even beat an actual gunmaster. However, he noticed that there was still a huge gap between an actual gunmaster and himself.The techniques and skills of an actual gunmaster would be different from him, at least. They would not only have a single attack skill like he did and instead, would have immense power from a variety of gunfighting techniques.\u201cI\u2019ll look for some tutorials on gun techniques and learn from actual combat videos between gunmasters. If I\u2019m able to brush up on my gun skills, it will not be difficult to beat the Gun Master Assessment.\u201d Lin Huang was aware of his weaknesses. \u201cI\u2019ll pick up a gunfighting technique after receiving the gunfighting certificate.\u201dHe heard sounds from Lin Xin who stayed upstairs and was not asleep yet. Lin Huang took the game ring and returned it to Lin Xin so that he could buy a new one for himself.\u201cBrother, you\u2019ve played for so long.\u201d She knew that he had just come out from the game cabin. He was still sweating.\u201cYes, I tried the basic mode and played another round in the hunter zone.\u201d Lin Huang nodded.\u201cDid you win?\u201d Lin Xin was curious to know.\u201cOf course I did. Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d Lin Huang boasted.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing!\u201d There were stars in Lin Xin\u2019s eyes. If her brother could win the game, it was an indicator that her brother was a really good player.\u201cIt is 10 o\u2019clock now, get to bed early.\u201d Lin Huang rubbed her head softly. He saw the tourist website that Lin Xin was checking out so he asked with a smile, \u201cAre you going on a trip soon? Have you decided where you\u2019re going to head to?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve chosen a few places but I haven\u2019t made my final decision\u2026\u201d There were so many places she wanted to visit.\u201cWhich few places have you chosen? Show me.\u201d Lin Huang insisted.\u201cI want to go to Qiantang City,\u00a0the A-grade foothold the most. The photos and videos uploaded on the network are decent. However, it\u2019s quite a distance. It\u2019ll take at least a month to reach if I take the Demonic Crystal Spaceship\u2026\u201d She was being optimistic even though she knew very well that she couldn\u2019t go there.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed nice\u2026 However, you don\u2019t have enough time since it\u2019s your final year in this coming September. It takes more than three months to travel to and fro. You can consider this destination next year after your graduation.\u201d Lin Huang advised. The super big foothold was indeed beautiful.\u201cThe second choice would be Cold Mountain City, a B-grade foothold. It is said that the entire foothold was built on the cold mountains. The foothold is covered in snow during all four seasons. It is summer now and this place is a summer resort.\u201d Lin Xin loved cold, snowy weather.\u201cHow long does it take to get there if you travel on the Demonic Crystal Spaceship?\u201d Lin Huang was certain she had all the details.\u201cIt takes only one month and we can still stay there for half a month.\u201d She still preferred to go to Cold Mountain City.\u201cThe amount of time spent traveling on the ship is quite long\u2026 Are there any other choices?\u201d Lin Huang was uneasy as the time taken to go to Cold Mountain City was longer than their actual vacation time.\u201cThere\u2019s also Bamboo City at a B-grade foothold and it takes only a week on the Demonic Crystal Spaceship. There is also Xiagong City, located at a B-grade foothold as well and it takes only eight days to travel there. Also, Baqi City is in a C-grade foothold\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSince we\u2019re going on a trip, we should just ignore C-grade footholds. Let\u2019s go to the big-sized footholds, the B-grade footholds. There\u2019re only two choices left which are Bamboo City and Xiagong City who happen to be close to one another. There is a place called Black Water City but it is not a touristy place. Choose one location between Bamboo City and Xiagong City. After you\u2019ve graduated, we can travel to places further from us when we have sufficient time for traveling.\u201d Lin Huang said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Xin agreed with her brother.\u201cSleep early. I\u2019ll take a bath before I sleep because I\u2019m sweating.\u201d Lin Huang went back to his room.\u201cGood night, brother!\u201d Lin Xin immediately shouted as Lin Huang left.\u201cGood night!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please pick your parcel up!\u201dEarly in the morning, as Lin Xin was preparing for school and Lin Huang was cleaning up after their meal, they heard the sound of the Silvertongue Bird.Upon opening the door, the fist-sized Silvertongue Bird was stood in front of the door. It looked up at Lin Huang.\u201cGood morning, Mr. Lin Huang. Here is your parcel.\u201dIt then flapped its wings and left a big box, half the size of a regular human, by the doorstep.The yellow feathered Silvertongue Bird jumped up on the box and a receipt appeared from its mouth.Lin Huang took the receipt and scanned the signature code at the bottom right corner with his Emperor\u2019s Heart Ring. He then walked into his house, grabbed some sweets and gave it to the bird.The Silvertongue Bird extended its wings and flew off after taking all the sweets. It was flattered, \u201cThank you for your generosity. I wish you a happy life.\u201dHe moved the box back to his house and opened it with a small knife.It was an instrument wrapped in a layer of thick, vibration-proof material. The height of the box was around 80 centimeters but the actual height of the instrument was less than 50 centimeters.He took out the instrument from the box and there was a Hunter Association logo printed on the bottom left corner. Lin Huang intentionally chose this Life Power detector because it was manufactured by the Hunter Association. The result of the test would, therefore, be more reliable than the others.There was a white crystal stone bulging at the top, in the center of the instrument. It was the shape of a hemisphere and was about 20 centimeters in diameter.Lin Huang knew that this was the crystal stone detector.The crystal stone detector lit up as he pressed on the reddish-orange switch at the bottom of the detector.The semi-transparent white crystal stone lit up like a white light lamp.Lin Huang pressed his right hand against it and the Life Power in his body was transferred to the crystal stone detector and it began to glow in a rainbow of colors.The colorful light glimmered for about two minutes and stopped. Three different colors appeared on the stone detector which was initially white in color. Gold color occupied the most among them while there was a little black and red color at the edges.\u201cDetection is completed. The user has polymorphic Life Power. The user has multiple elemental attributes to his Life Power. Three types of attributes have been detected. The dragonfire and blood element occupied most of the Life Power while a small fraction of it is taken up by the strength element. There may be some other attributes that have not been detected. Would you like to contact the Hunter Association for a more detailed test?\u201d\u201cReject contact!\u201d After listening to the results of the test, he roughly knew why he had multiple elemental attributes in his Life Power.He absorbed most of the Life Power from Charcoal and Bai which was why there was a higher amount of blood and dragonfire element to his Life Power while he only used Tyrant occasionally, which explains why the strength element was a little lacking.He erased the data stored in the detector and turned it off. He then opened the network and started looking for information regarding polymorphic Life Power.There was very little information regarding polymorphic Life Power on the network. He found nothing useful after surfing the net for almost half a day.\u201cIt\u2019s unavailable on the Heart Network. Perhaps I\u2019ll have to ask Yi Yeyu again?\u201d Lin Huang frowned. However, he recalled something after a short while. \u201cOh yeah, I almost forgot that I am now given access to the exclusive section for Bronze Hunters.\u201dHe logged into the Hunter Association information network and looked for more information. After reading around eight irrelevant posts, he had finally found one thread discussing Life Skill training for people with polymorphic Life Power.It was posted by an anon around 20 years ago, stating that\u00a0the person had polymorphic Life Power and was interviewed. Many comments insulted the owner of the post.This was because not many of them possessed more than one attribute. Those who possessed dual attributes were even rarer and there were only a few of them in the entire Division7. People had mentioned polymorphic attributes as a theory but no one had actually proven its existence. Aside from royalty, no commoner had ever heard of this before.The post was initially pushed down the thread list after it was posted for a few days until one day; an anonymous person gave a lengthy reply, rekindling interest in this issue.The anonymous person explained in detail and he or she seemed to have done their research. Lin Huang read the reply carefully and was in deep thought.The entire reply could be concluded in the final sentence, \u201cIt is more appropriate for those with polymorphic Life Power to practice Life Skills with a neutral elemental attribute.\u201d However, he was pondering this matter deeply.\u201cBased on the reply, it mentioned that Life Power was actually a kind of energy that was relatively stable. However, when Life Power is imbued with different elemental attributes, the instability index of Life Power will increase. A person who possessed polymorphic Life Power has an innate self-balancing system within their body. If they were to train with a Life Skill that was imbued with an elemental attribute, it would disrupt this self-balancing system and cause the unstable Life Power to erupt from one\u2019s body. In order to maintain the balance of Life Power in one\u2019s body, people with polymorphic life power can only train with Life Skills with a neutral element.\u201d\u201cThe theory made sense but the ratio of the elemental attributes in my Life Power is constantly changing and it seems to be fine. Could it be because I\u2019m still at a low level and have a low quantity of Life Power?\u201d Lin Huang doubted.However, he decided to follow what was suggested and train the\u00a0\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0\u00a0that he had on hand.Army Attack Tactics\u00a0was a set of Life Skills with a neutral attribute that focused on fighting skills. Many experts would practice this Life Skill as it was more valuable than any otherThere were nine levels in this set of Life Skills. Most people would cap out at level four or five. Only those who were stronger could reach level six. Level six was an important stage in this set of Life Skills. If one was able to break through this stage, the strength and the speed using the Life Skills would be on par with that of an ultimate Life Skill.With Xiao Hei on hand, it could be level six or even level nine for the\u00a0\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0, he was confident that he could achieve it. Time was the only issue.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSince he had determined the attribute of his Life Power, he did not want to delay the training of his Life Skill any longer.He kept the Life Power detector away and went back to his room.He took out a black crystal the size of his fist and transferred his Life Power into it.A middle-aged man appeared in front of Lin Huang and Lin Huang could vaguely sense that he was giving off a murderous vibe.\u201cThe Life Skill \u2013\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0\u00a0was derived from an ancient skill from the ancients known as\u00a0Devastating Heavens\u00a0. Despite being a high-level Life Skill that people used in current times, it was in sync with the knowledge and wisdom of the old masters. This set of Life Skills were created by someone who had disobeyed the law of nature. He had said in the past that whoever was capable of achieving level nine in this set of Life Skills would stand aloof from Ultimate Life Skills and would achieve the power of Holy Life Skills\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rather, the difficult part was upgrading them to the next level.Similarly, Army Attack Tactics was not that difficult to learn as well. Most iron-level hunters were able to complete the first level within three days.Lin Huang was taught by a specially appointed person that specialized in theArmy Attack Tactics\u00a0practicing crystal. Lin Huang could now gradually divide his Life Power into parts.The Life Power which initially resembled a clear stream started to divide into two streams, the two streams then divided into three streams, three streams began dividing into four and eventually, his Life Power was divided into 12 streams after he completed refining his Life Power. It was akin to a large military unit that was broken into 12 smaller units.Lin Huang was puzzled as he wondered what the purpose of refining his Life Power into 12 streams was for. However, after watching the demonstration by the middle-aged man, he finally understood the purpose of doing so.This was because he saw the 12 streams of Life Power tangling among one another, forming a rope which rotated at lightning speed until it resembled an electric drill.\u201cAh, no wonder so many people are confident with\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0, this set of skill changes the form of one\u2019s Life Power.\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s eyes brightened up at the thought of this. Lin Huang could now attack his opponents with different forms of Life Power.After watching the video tutorial, Lin Huang now had a broader understanding of the use of Life Power.He could finally understand why the Life Skill was named\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0. Life Power could be divided into smaller groups like how armies were divided into divisions of troops to carry out different attack tactics be it offensive or defensive; the commander would only have to instruct them and they would carry out his will. This was the core principle of\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0.Lin Huang spent about nine hours managed to master forming his Life Power into the shape of an electric drill and completed the first level of\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0. His progress was quite good and he performed almost as well as a genius! However, he still could not compare to the true geniuses.According to the information Lin Huang retrieved from the network, An Luoyu was the fastest person to master\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0and this was about 20 years ago. He spent about half an hour to complete the first level. He was a true genius.Upon completing the first level of\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0, he received a pop-up notification from Xiao Hei.\u201cLife Skill detected. Do you want to turn it into a card?\u201cDoes it require card pieces?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cNo, as it is a self-learned and self-mastered Life Skill, you do not have to give anything in order to turn it into a card.\u201d\u201cAlright, turn it into a card.\u201d Lin Huang nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s done. You obtained a Rare Life Skill Card.\u201dLin Huang immediately looked at the card that he had just obtained.\u201cLife Skill Card\u201d\u201cLife Skill Name: Army Attack Tactics\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cMastery Level: Level 1\u201d\u201cEffect: 12% increment in the rotation speed of Life Power. Increases attack power and defense power by 12% respectively.\u201d\u201cRemarks: For the first five levels, with every upgrade, each of the Life Skill effects will be increased by 12%.\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: Usable\u201d\u201cWith every upgrade, there will be 12% increment. Five levels will mean a 60% increase. When one reaches the sixth level, each of the Life Skill effects will be increased to at least 72%. It is indeed similar to the power of an Ultimate Life Skill.\u201d Lin Huang had previously checked out the effects of different levels of Life Skill.For low-level Life Skills, the speed, attack power and defense power of Life Power increased by less than 30% while mid-level Life Skills increased the effects from anywhere between 30% to 50%. On the other hand, high-level Life Skills would increase the effects on Life Power between 50% to 70% while Ultimate Life Skill increases the effect on Life Power between 70% to 100%.\u201cXiao Hei, after turning it into Life Skill card, will I be rewarded with card pieces when I practice?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cYes, you will obtain card pieces.\u201d\u201cWhat are the rules for leveling this skill?\u201d\u201cIt will be upgraded to the second level with 200 card pieces. After upgrading to the second level, it will require 400 card pieces to upgrade to the third level. Then, 800 card pieces are needed to be upgraded to the fourth level. After leveling to the fourth level, 1,600 card pieces are required to upgrade to the fifth level.\u201d\u201cStarting from the sixth level, there are some changes to the rules of leveling the skill. In order to upgrade from level five to level six, it requires 10,000 Life Skill card pieces. From level six to level seven, 30,000 Life Skill card pieces are needed and to upgrade from level seven to level eight, you will need 90,000 Life Skill card pieces. \u201d\u201cUpgrading from level eight to level nine is a whole different set of rules. It will require 810,000 Life Skill card pieces.\u201d\u201c810,000\u2026\u201d Lin Huang was speechless but he muttered, \u201cLucky for me, it isn\u2019t too difficult to reach level six..\u201dIn just a short while after the Life Skill card was made, Lin Xin came back from school and he unlocked his door when he heard the front door open. \u201cBrother, I\u2019m home!\u201d Lin Xin shouted.\u201cWhat do you want to eat? Take your pick from the kitchen.\u201d Lin Huang said as he walked down the stairs and towards the kitchen. He took out the leftovers.After changing her shoes, Lin Xin went to the kitchen chose three dishes.Lin Huang was steaming the rice and said, \u201cI forgot to steam rice. You might need to wait for a while. It was a busy day today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I am not hungry yet.\u201d Lin Xin pulled Lin Huang to the living hall and sat on the sofa.

It\u2019s time for breakfast!\u201d Obviously, she sounded happy and excited.\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019m coming.\u201d Lin Huang looked at the clock and it was only 6.30 a.m.After taking his bath, he changed his clothes and headed downstairs.There were a few slightly weird-shaped, over-fried eggs on the dining table and a plate of refreshing looking salad.Lin Huang walked behind the dining table and looked at the bowl of porridge. The girl had learned from the messed-up eggs. At least, the color looked fine and she did not simply add ingredients in the porridge.\u201cBrother, hurry up. After breakfast, we have to rush to get on the first eagle ride!\u201d Lin Xin demanded.\u201cTake your time. We are not riding on an eagle to get there.\u201d Lin Huang understood why she was rushing.\u201cHow are we going to go to Baqi City then? We are departing today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cYou will know later when we depart.\u201d Lin Huang slowly put a spoonful of porridge into his mouth. His facial expression changed immediately, forcing the porridge down his throat. He raised his head and looked at Lin Xin.\u201cDoes it taste good?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s too much salt. It is unhealthy to take in so much salt.\u201d Lin Huang tried to be gentle with his criticism.\u201cSince I didn\u2019t add any salt in the fried egg and salad, I added slightly more salt to the porridge.\u201d Lin Huang glanced at the spice rack while Lin Xin was talking. Before this, there was at least three-quarters of salt left in the container placed on the semi-transparent spice rack. However, there was none left.\u201cYou can sprinkle some salt or pour soy sauce on the fried egg and salad if you want more taste in your meal.\u201d Lin Huang explained patiently.To reduce the saltiness, Lin Huang took a spoonful of green salad.As he ate the spoonful of salad, Lin Huang felt like his skull was about to crack. He forced himself to swallow and took a serviette to wipe away his tears.\u201cXin Er, how much mustard did you add to the salad?\u201d Lin Huang\u2019s tongue was numb.\u201cI remember you telling me that some of the vegetables must be soaked to taste good. I added the whole bottle of mustard oil into the bowl and soaked the vegetables. I coat the vegetables and mustard oil well from top to bottom by wearing gloves. I spent a lot of time preparing this!\u201d Lin Xin said proudly.\u201cNo wonder the color of the vegetables looks so appealing. It has been coated with mustard\u2026\u201d Lin Huang thought.\u201cXin Er, I am stuffed. Enjoy your breakfast. I will wash the plates later.\u201d Lin Huang walked towards the sofa.\u201cBrother, you have not touched the fried egg.\u201d Lin Xin was upset.\u201cYou can eat it.\u201d Lin Huang sat on the sofa and read the news.Lin Xin ate all the dishes \u2013 the salty porridge, the mustard-soaked salad and even the fried-egg. She gobbled them all!\u201cWas it possible that she was born with a weird sense of taste?\u201d Lin Huang thought as he glanced at her.In just a short while, Lin Xin finished all the food on the dining table. Lin Huang closed the news website and cleaned up the table.\u201cBrother, how are we going to Baqi City?\u201d Lin Xin asked.\u201cWhy are you being so impatient? You\u2019ll know later.\u201d Lin Huang was agitated.\u201cHave you packed?\u201d Lin Huang asked.\u201cYes, last night!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll check my room once again to make sure that I did not miss anything. Please check that the windows are closed and the lights are switched off and oh\u2026 Lock the door on your way down.\u201dLin Xin followed after him and went to check on the things Lin Huang mentioned.Lin Huang had gone to his room. He closed the windows in his room and folded his quilts. He took one last glance at his room and locked the door. Lin Xin was coming down the stairs.\u201cI\u2019ve done everything you asked me to do. Can we depart now?\u201d Lin Xin was clearly excited.Both of them changed their shoes and walked out of their house. Lin Huang walked two steps forward and summoned the Viridian Wolf at Street No.101.It was a majestic-looking Viridian Wolf. She paused for a long time and finally said, \u201cBrother, are you an Imperial Censor?!\u201d\u201cYes, I am. I discovered it when I registered for the Reserve Hunter Assessment.\u201d Lin Huang did not tell her the truth because it would be hard for him to explain why he did not tell Lin Xin about this earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time to reach Baqi City by riding on your\u00a0Viridian Wolf\u2026\u201d Lin Xin was curious.\u201cWe\u2019ll ride on the Viridian Wolf until we get out of this foothold. We\u2019ll ride on other monsters later.\u201d He extended his hand and pulled Lin Xin up to sit on the wolf\u2019s back.The Viridian Wolf stood up and ran towards the east gate of the foothold. They met a few acquaintances in the town who were filled with astonishment because of Lin Huang\u2019s fancy ride! After about three minutes, they arrived outside the east gate of the foothold. Lin Huang then recalled the Viridian Wolf and summoned the Alexandrian Eagle.\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d Lin Xin was staring at the white eagle\u2019s pure, frosty appearance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Alexandrian Eagle\u2019s speed is faster than an ordinary eagle.\u201d\u201cBrother, you\u2019re so amazing. You\u2019re capable of summoning two monsters!\u201d Lin Xin complimented Lin Huang.\u201cGet up. You can sit on this weather-resistant cushion so you can get a better view of the scenery.\u201d Lin Huang helped Lin Xin get up on the Alexandrian Eagle and he followed after her.\u201cOnto Baqi City.\u201d Lin Huang instructed the Alexandrian Eagle.The\u00a0Alexandrian Eagle roared, fluttered its wings and flew up to the sky with both of them behind it\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On Monday morning, Lin Xin woke up at 6 o\u2019clock again causing Lin Huang to wake up early too because she was noisy when she was getting ready in the living room.He showered, changed and then brought Lin Xin to have breakfast downstairs. Whenever Lin Huang stayed in a hotel, he always thought of the food back at Stable Residence. The buffet breakfast in this hotel was not bad at all but it was nothing compared to the food at Stable Residence. Lin Huang then headed to the reception to check out once they were done.After they left the hotel, he brought Lin Xin to the open air cafe that he went before. He was welcomed by the refreshing fragrance of coffee which made him feel wide awake.He then asked a staff, \u201cMay I know what time you open?\u201d\u201cSir, we are open 24 hours. You can come in anytime you want.\u201d The lady staff replied gracefully.\u201cOh, that\u2019s great\u2026 Get me a cup of black coffee then.\u201d Lin Huang raised his eyebrow, turned around and asked Lin Xin, \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d\u201cCoffee must be bitter, are there any other beverages?\u201d Lin Xin looked at the menu and noticed that there were no decaffeinated beverages available.\u201cWe just launched honey coffee a few months back. It\u2019s a sweet beverage.\u201d The lady staff recommended.\u201cI\u2019ll have that then.\u201d Lin Xin nodded.\u201cIs there anything else? We have desserts too.\u201d\u201cNone for me, how about you?\u201d Lin Huang looked at Lin Xin.\u201cI\u2019m good. We\u2019re still full from breakfast.\u201d Lin Xin shook her head.\u201cAlright then. One black coffee and one honey coffee.\u201d The lady staff repeated.After the bill was paid, Lin Huang brought Lin Xin to sit under the umbrella under the open air. The morning sun hurt their eyes. It was the first time Lin Huang could enjoy the beautiful side of the world without any pressure. Baqi City was quiet in the morning, there were very little people walking at the plaza.Nonetheless, the city was indeed beautiful. If there were fewer monsters in this world, people would be able live in peace like heaven on earth.He was staring at the sun for a long time and was distracted when the staff brought his coffee to him. He took a sip but frowned. Lin Xin noticed that and asked, \u201cIs it bad?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little bitter.\u201d Lin Huang assured his sister.\u201cYou can have mine then, give me yours.\u201d Lin Xin pushed her drink to him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay I prefer my coffee bitter.\u201d Lin Huang politely declined her offer.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Xin immediately took a sip of her drink and Lin Huang watch as her eyes brightened up,\u201d It tastes so good!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, but don\u2019t drink too much or else you\u2019ll have trouble sleeping at night.\u201d Lin Huang reminded her.Lin Xin was indulging in her drink that she did not hear what Lin Huang said. Three minutes later, Lin Xin finished the drink. She let go of the straw and with her puppy eyes she asked, \u201cBrother, can I please have another one?\u201d\u201cI suppose, please try to get some rest tonight though.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d Lin Xin rushed into the cafe soon returned to Lin Huang\u2019s side with a larger coffee cup.Lin Huang glared at her. She stuck out her tongue and said to Lin Huang playfully, \u201cYou did not say that I\u2019m not allowed to order an extra-large one.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come looking for me if you can\u2019t sleep tonight.\u201d Lin Huang was stern.\u201cI will play my games if I can\u2019t fall asleep tonight.\u201d Lin Xin nodded and said.After he finished his coffee, Lin Huang read the news on the network. A news article caught his attention. The title of the news was \u2018Daughter of the Leng Family became a transcendent at the age of 18\u2019. He clicked on the news, it was Leng Yuexin. Lin Huang read the news article and got to know more about Leng Yuexin\u2019s family background.She was from the most powerful family among the six royal families in Division7. The news read that their family was powerful ever since the new era, about 800 years ago.\u201cNo wonder relics did not mean anything to her\u2026\u201d Lin Huang had heard about the six royal families before but he did not know that Leng Yuexin\u2019s family was one of them.\u201cNo wonder the Li family would even consider apologizing to her family.\u201d\u201cBrother, is this Leng Yuexin the one who sent you the parcels?\u201d Lin Xin peeped at the news her brother was reading. \u201cOnly 18 and she\u2019s already a transcendent, wow! How do you know her?\u201d\u201cI followed her team when I journeyed into Wangyou Forest.\u201d Lin Huang simply said.\u201cThen why did she send you stuff?\u201d Lin Xin was curious.\u201cI bought some stuff from her but she did not bring it along with her at the time, so she sent them over when she got home.\u201d Lin Huang thought of a quick lie.\u201cWhat did you buy from her?\u201d Lin Xin asked further.\u201cWhy are you asking so many questions? Drink your coffee.\u201d Lin Huang was afraid that the more he engaged in the conversation, the more she\u2019ll want to know.\u201cDid you at least get her signature?\u201d Lin Xin asked again.\u201cNo, I forgot to ask.\u201d\u201cPlease ask for her signature the next time!\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll ask her that if we ever meet again.\u201dAfter settling Lin Xin, Lin Huang hesitated and sent Leng Yuexin a message. The message was short, \u2019Congratulations on leveling up to a transcendent!\u2019Leng Yuexin did not reply and moments later, Lin Huang switched off his communication device. He was bummed. They were drinking coffee while waiting for the spaceship. Just then, there was a notification from his ring. He opened it and it was a message from Leng Yuexin.\u201cThank you. I was in the shower just now so I could not check my message. What\u2019ve been up to?\u201d\u201cMy sister is on a long break so I\u2019m bringing her to Xiagong City.\u201d Lin Huang immediately replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou had a hard time before so it\u2019s good to relax a little. I\u2019m going for a vacation myself in the next few days. I\u2019m going to Division3.\u201d Leng Yuexin told Lin Huang.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to become a transcendent, you deserve a treat. Enjoy yourself!\u201d Lin Huang replied.\u201cYou enjoy yourself too.\u201dLin Huang turned off the device and couldn\u2019t help but smile. Just when Lin Huang had the time to travel, he visited a B-grade foothold while Leng Yuexin who belonged to royalty could go anywhere, anytime she wanted.\u201cOne day I will become a transcendent and travel to other divisions!\u201d Lin Huang promised himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang and Lin Xin scanned their barcodes and boarded the spaceship. They watched as the spaceship ascended into the\u00a0air and saw Baqi City become smaller and smaller as they got higher. Lin Huang had spent his whole morning familiarizing himself with the spaceship.Lin Xin\u2019s excitement wore out after lunch and she followed Lin Huang back to their rooms. The room numbers were printed on the Demonic Crystal Spaceship\u2019s ticket. Each ticket was printed with a different room number depending on where you were staying and was only meant for the person whose name was on the ticket. Everyone had to have a ticket, even infants!Their rooms were both on the 7th floor, Room 156 and Room 157 respectively. There was a wall partitioning their rooms but Lin Xin did not want to stay alone. There was only one bedroom in his room and so he let Lin Xin have the bedroom while he slept on the couch in the living room. Lin Huang wanted to train in the morning undisturbed so hoped Lin Xin would be in her own room during the day.After lunch, Lin Xin was playing Gun Master in her room. Lin Huang locked his room door and began his practice of\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0. During his days in Baqi City, he spent all his time accompanying Lin Xin to the point where he neglected training. As his journey in the air would take seven and a half days, he had planned to level\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0\u00a0at least one or two levels. Although he had mastered level one, he was still unfamiliar with the skill rotation. He needed half an hour to go through the skill cycle to obtain one card piece.He did his calculations, if he got one card piece every half an hour, he would need 200 card pieces to be able to level-up to level two \u2013 it would take him 100 hours. Even if he trained 15 hours a day, he would still need seven days to get to level two.He sat with his legs crossed in the living room and soon, he activated his Life Power to train for\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0. He trained from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., five hours passed by in a blink of an eye. He obtained 11 card pieces and successfully shortened the cycle from 30 minutes to only 25 minutes.After dinner with Lin Xin, she went back to her own room. She did not ask to go to his room this time which surprised Lin Huang. He arrived in his room and locked the door. Four hours later, it was 10:30 p.m., Lin Xin knocked on his door. The skill rotation improved as Lin Huang trained his body, it was now 22 minutes per skill cycle. Within four hours, he managed to obtain 10 card pieces.He opened his door and saw a giddy Lin Xin. He asked, \u201cWhere did you go? You seem happy.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere, I was playing Gun Master in my room all day. I didn\u2019t lose at all today and I even got a new high score!\u201d Lin Xin was clearly proud of her small victory.\u201cBrother, I think I\u2019m gifted. I\u2019m destined to be a gunmaster.\u201d\u201cI think so too. When the summer break ends and you\u2019re back to school, tell your teacher about it and get them to assess your skill. However, whether you can become an actual gunmaster one day will depend wholly on yourself.\u201d Lin Huang encouraged her.In a world like this, it was impossible to avoid monsters completely. For a profession that focused on long-distance attacks like the gunmaster, it would be relatively safer compared to other professions. Although there were very few female gunmasters, Lin Huang hoped Lin Xin would plan her future towards that goal.\u201cI\u2019ll talk to my teacher then.\u201d Lin Xin nodded. She would be back in school this September and would be in the graduating class. It was time for her to think about her future. There are three options after she graduated from the Hunter Reserve College. One was to enter a more prestigious school such as the military academy which was under the wing of the Union Government, the Hunter Association or other academies that were established by organizations to further her studies. If she was bronze-level, she would be an official member of one of the organizations. Each organization has vast resources to cultivate talents in the field they specialize in and would train outstanding students to achieve either iron-level or bronze-level.The second alternative would be to participate in the assessment by the Hunter Association or other organizations to become a reserve member before slowly climbing her way to the position of an official member. It would be harder because she would have to bear all the cost\u00a0on her own before she was bronze-level. These were usually students that were rejected by prestigious schools.The last one would be giving up on getting to bronze-level, be an ordinary person and live an ordinary life. Of course, that would require her to reside in an area that was not prone to attacks by monster hordes. Lin Huang was wanted by many organizations because of his great score in school. However, when they discovered that he had a broken Life Wheel during a routing body check-up, he was rejected. That was the reason why he went for the second alternative which was to join the reserve hunter assessment.Lin Huang hoped she could get into one of the prestigious schools to receive professional training so that she would not have to suffer like he did. If her talent of being a gunmaster was scouted, she would have a higher chance of entering these academies in the future. However, Lin Huang was happy with his current condition as it would only be a matter of time before he reached bronze-level. If he entered one of the prestigious schools, he might not have been able to level-up to iron-level as quick as he did because he would not have had any flexibility in his daily schedule as he would be bound to the arrangements made by the school.\u201cI managed to upgrade to iron-level rank-3 from an ordinary person within a month, that\u2019s kind of ridiculous.\u201d Lin Huang said while patting Lin Xin\u2019s head. He smiled and said, \u201cEnjoy yourself these two months, don\u2019t think about school. After all, you only have one year of fun until your graduation.\u201d\u201cBrother, why did you not choose to enter one of the prestigious schools?\u201d Lin Xin finally asked the question that had been bothering her. She was under the impression that Lin Huang gave up on his studies and she did not know about his broken Life Wheel. Lin Huang had kept the result of body check-up confidential.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I did not want to study, it was because they didn\u2019t want me.\u201d Lin Huang shook his head.\u201cHow is that possible, you bagged first place in your graduation. The people who were in the top 10 went to good schools. Could there have been a mistake somewhere?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo, I had some health conditions. They found out that I would not be able to get to iron-level during the body check-up so I was rejected.\u201d Lin Huang told the truth.\u201cWhat happened to you? Is it serious?\u201d Lin Xin asked.\u201cI\u2019m all good now.\u201d Lin Huang waved his hand, he did not want to talk about it anymore.Lin Xin insisted on her question so he had to stop her, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you more when you\u2019re at iron-level, you wouldn\u2019t understand me even if-if I told you now.\u201dLin Xin did not push any further. The conversation went on until Lin Huang forced himself to go to bed at 11 p.m. at night. Lin Xin showered too but she could not sleep. She was not sure if it was the coffee that she had during the day or something else. She rolled around in bed until 1 a.m. but she was not sleepy at all. Instead of trying to sleep, she decided to play Gun Master again\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Huang sighed loudly when he heard a notification from Xiao Hei.\u201cYou have accumulated Life Skill card \u2013\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0pieces x200, would you like to proceed with a card upgrade?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cCombining\u00a0Army Attack Tactics\u00a0pieces x200, Life Skill card Army Attack Tactics mastery level has been upgraded.\u201dLin Huang then tapped on the card and saw a notification box.\u201cLife Skill Card\u201d\u201cLife Skill Name: Army Attack Tactics\u201d\u201cRarity: Rare\u201d\u201cMastery Level: Level 2\u201d\u201cEffect: 24% increment in the rotation speed of Life Power. Increases attack power and defense power by 24% respectively.\u201d\u201cRemarks: For the first five levels, with every upgrade, each of the Life Skill effects will be increased by 12%.\u201d\u201cCard Remarks: Usable\u201d\u201cThat was faster than I expected\u2026\u201d Although Lin Huang said that, he was not relaxed at all. He managed to shorten the skill rotation from half an hour to almost 10 minutes within five days. With every upgrade, the skill rotation cycle after each upgrade became more complicated. The time he took to complete a single rotation went back to half an hour. This meant that he was now back at where he initially started, requiring about 30 minutes for a single card piece.It was 5:40 in the evening and he noticed Lin Xin coming to his room at six o\u2019clock sharp every day to have dinner together. Since he had some spare time, Lin Huang read the news. A news article caught his attention immediately as it was a foothold code that he was familiar with \u2013 No.7B61. No.7B61 was the official foothold name of the Union Government in Xiagong City.He started reading the news.\u201cBefore daybreak yesterday, there were 16 murders in foothold No.7B61. From preliminary investigations, those 16 murders were committed humans and there was not a single trace of a monster invasion. Investigations are still ongoing, please do not panic\u2026\u201d\u201cXiagong City is such a large foothold. Why is the security here so poor?\u201d Lin Huang frowned.Had he known about this few days back, he would not have chosen Xiagong City as their destination. He was worried for Lin Xin.He tried to look for more news related to the incident but there were none. This was the latest case and the media was careful with their words. It would be huge if there was a monster invasion in a large foothold such as this. There would likely be an uproar.It was 6:05 p.m. when he was done with the news. Lin Huang looked at the time and raised his eyebrow, he sent Lin Xin a message, \u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner.\u201dThree minutes passed but Lin Xin was nowhere to be found. Lin Huang felt that something was wrong, he then video-called Lin Xin. Her phone rang twice and then the call was cut off.\u201cThe person you are calling is currently unavailable, please leave a message after the tone\u2026\u201d\u201cOh no!\u201d Lin Xin never declines his calls. Lin Huang rushed to Lin Xin\u2019s room and continuously rang her doorbell. He rang for more than 10 times but nobody opened the door. He then rushed to the balcony\u00a0and broke through the sliding door with his foot.Many people noticed Lin Huang and someone reported his actions to the staff but he could not care less. He looked around Lin Xin\u2019s room but she was nowhere to be found. Her room was the way she left it, there were no signs of a fight. He wanted to find whatever clues he could so he tried thinking like Lin Xin for a moment. He knew that she spent most of her time on the couch in the living room, probably where she played Gun Master.Lin Huang followed her scent which brought him to the floating elevator just outside her room. Just as he arrived at the entrance of the elevator, the door automatically opened and many staff members in uniform surrounded him.\u201cSir, are you the guest from Room 156? Somebody reported to us that you broke into Room 157. For the safety of other passengers, please follow us.\u201d The chief of staff was definitely unfriendly.\u201cI\u2019m staying in Room 156, the person staying here is my sister. I can show you the ticket as proof of my booking.\u201d Lin Huang searched for the receipt, \u201cLet me know how much the damage will cost, I\u2019ll pay for it. My sister is missing from this spaceship. I must look for her, please do not get in my way.\u201dThe chief of staff saw that his ticket was authentic and asked, \u201cAre you sure she\u2019s missing?\u201d\u201cYes! Please check the surveillance camera for me and notify me if you see anything, I\u2019ll take a look downstairs.\u201d Lin Huang could not afford to waste any more time.\u201cWhere and when was the last time you saw her?\u201d The leader asked.\u201cAfter lunch, it was about 12:30. We went back to our respective rooms.\u201cBoth of you please follow him while I go to the monitor room with the rest.\u201d The leader instructed his men at once.Lin Huang was grateful for their help. He followed Lin Xin\u2019s scent to the bar on the first floor, and all of a sudden, her scent disappeared. Lin Huang noticed that there was a green, air purifier block that was the size of a washbasin behind the bar counter. The block was absorbing the odor from the air.\u201cBoss, did you see this girl?\u201d Lin Huang showed the bar owner a photo of Lin Xin at the counter.\u201cShe was here an hour ago but she left in less than a minute.\u201d The bar owner waved his hand. \u201cShe asked if we served honey coffee. Why would she even think we would serve that in a bar?!\u201d\u201cDid she speak to anyone here?\u201d Lin Huang became more worried.\u201cNo, we hardly have customers before nine.
