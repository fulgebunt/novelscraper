    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: I\u2019m the King?\u201cDanger! Protect the King!\u201dSomeone was screaming like a hen which had lost its eggs. Fei heard the noise. He forced open his sleepy eyes and focused on a bright object flying towards him. Fei\u2019s brain slowly identified the object as an arrow, which was hurdling towards him so fast that the air appeared to rip in front of it.\u201cDamn, what\u2019s going on? Which asshole is shooting at me?\u201dFei was immediately scared awake, with all the hair on his body standing on its end.However, the arrow hit him before he was able to react.Beng \u2014\u2014\u2014-The arrow clanged against his helmet.The arrow had not penetrated but had shook the helmet, disorientating Fei. Fei felt his ears were ringing, the sky and the ground were spinning and stars were circling before his eyes. His body was knocked back, like a Barbie doll blown away by a shotgun.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..Shit!\u201dHe cried out in pain as he felt his body ragdoll through the air.\u201cOh God! The king is wounded! Help!\u201d\u201cSoldier! Catch the king!\u201d\u201cAndy! Andy!! Why are you still standing there? Go get the priests and mages!\u201d\u201cHey! Those son of bitches down there are trying to overtake the castle again!\u201d A soldier pointed at the army dressed in black that surrounded the castle.\u201cShit! Shit! Someone tell me why they have siege ladders!\u201d\u201cArchers Ready! \u2026\u2026. Shoot!\u201dFei heard the commands being shouted and the chaotic footsteps while he was still airborne. He was confused. The king? Mages? Priest? Archers? Siege? Where is this? Is this in the middle of a movie shoot? What the hell is going on?Immediately, he felt his body collide with the cold stone floor.His butt made contact with the rock solid ground first before his helmeted head smashed into the wall.There were more stars dancing before his eyes. As the noises was getting louder and louder around him, his mind was slowly blacking out again.\u201cWhat king? Why does it feel like they are talking about me?\u201d\u201cFuck! Who gives a shit about kings or queens! You guys better not let me know who shot that arrow, or I\u2019m gonna fucking kill that guy!\u201d Fei thought vaguely.His head was almost punctured by an arrow when he had just woken up. He was so scared yet mad at the same time, so he couldn\u2019t help but swear in his mind.Suddenly, the sensation of pain flooded his entire body. He collapsed on the floor, just like a dog that had eaten a ton of chocolate, choked a couple times and fainted.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t know in how long, Fei woke up for the second time. His head felt sluggish and he could only vaguely perceive his surroundings.He felt like he was lying on a soft cloud, but as he tried to move, sharp pangs of pain and soreness declared his body\u2019s unwillingness to move. His head was still heavy as if someone had clobbered him with a stick. He couldn\u2019t open his eyes either. All he could gather was two female voices whispering around him.\u201cAngela, you\u2019re so silly. I wouldn\u2019t care so much about him if I were you. If he dies, you will easily own everything in the Chambord Kingdom and you don\u2019t even have to marry this royal idiot.\u201dFrom the crisp voice and sweet giggles, Fei estimated that they were young girls around the age of 15.\u201cWatch what you are saying!\u201dAnother gentle voice interrupted slight angrily. After a few seconds of pause as if she is adjusting her attitude, she continued. \u201cEmma, my silly little sister, do you know what you are saying? Don\u2019t ever say such things\u2026.. After all, Alexander is my fiance!\u201d\u201cAlexander? Who the heck is Alexander?\u201d Fei thought. He had absolutely no idea of what was going on.He smelled a little fragrance. The natural sweet body odor of women.Fei tried hard to open his eyes, and as his heavy eyelids finally budged, he was surprised by what he saw.He found himself inside what appeared to be a luxury medieval European palace, with magnificent decors, royal furniture and an lavender scent; as if he was in a dream.He was shocked. He started observing his surroundings after he felt that he had control of his neck again.Two perfectly postured females appeared in front of him.The one that was farther away was a young girl dressed in a maid uniform, her blonde hair was simply styled into a pig tail. She pouted her mouth. Clearly, she was unhappy to see him awake.\u201cShe must be the one who didn\u2019t care about the Alexander.\u201d Fei thought, \u201cAlthough she is young, she is too cold blooded.\u201dAs his sight moved closer, he realized that he was lying on a dark red, gold gilded king sized bed. His head was resting on a soft velvet pillow. A beautiful girl was sitting on the side of the bed with worry written all over her face.Her silky black hair was like dark cloud tied together with a purple string. Her skin was paler than snow and smoother than ice. The violet tunic skirt elevated her curves, making her appear like a goddess that most men would dream of seeing. She was just perfect\u201ckokokoko..\u201d Fei coughed intentionally to get their attention.\u201cYou are awake!?\u201dThe black haired beauty Angela bent over. Her expression quickly became one of surprise and happiness. \u201cAlexander, how are you feeling? Are you still in pain? Priest Evan said that you have to rest properly\u2026\u201d\u201cI \u2026 em,,,,,, What happened?\u201d Fei didn\u2019t know what to say. Right after he said it, he was shocked!He discovered something unbelievableAngela was using an ancient and weird sounding language. Although Fei was a student in the graduate program at a university that specialized in language, he never heard of this type of speech. However strangely, he doesn\u2019t just understand the language, he can speak it as well.\u201cAlexander, did you forget? When you were leading the soldiers protecting the kingdom, a sneaky enemy shot you with an arrow. Thank god you were wearing your helmet, or else you might have had to pay a larger price.\u201d Angela explained.She gently placed her left hand on Fei\u2019s forehead. It wasn\u2019t hot. Surprise flashed through her eyes. \u201c Great! Your body temperature is back to normal. Priest Evan said that as long as you don\u2019t have a fever, everything will be alright. Alexander, you are a brave king!\u201d\u201cMe? Alexander? King?\u201d Fei didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201cThat\u2019s right, our young and brave king of Chambord. It\u2019s all because of you! You appeared on the fortress walls just in time and boosted the morale of our soldiers so they could fend off another wave of attackers from the invading army!\u201d Angela said with a smile on her face.Fei felt strange. For some reason, he felt like the tonality of the girl was like a kindergarden teacher trying to comfort a crying kid.\u201cHe is no brave king.\u201dEmma, the blonde girl said with a tone of hostility \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for General Bizzer\u2019s repeated request, Alexander will go up there voluntarily? I remember that he almost peed his pants when he was putting on his armor. Boosting morale? If seeing the king got shot off the defense wall like a moron the moment he got up there counts as boosting the morale, then I guess he did.\u201dAlthough Fei didn\u2019t know if what Emma said was true or not, he didn\u2019t have time to figure that out.His mind was messed up.\u201cWhat the hell. Didn\u2019t I got smashed by something on the head at the doorstep of my apartment? Then when I woke up, I\u2019m at this Chambord Kingdom that I never heard about and I\u2019m the king Alexander? And this beauty in front of me is my fianc\u00e9?Fei gave himself a few tap on the forehead.\u201cIs this a prank? Or am I in a different universe?\u201d Fei thought. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a prank. The beauty of Angela is out of this world, who would pay her to prank me? And that Emma is super cute too.\u201d\u201cMost importantly, I could understand and speak this strange ancient language that I never heard about\u2026\u201d Fei quickly analyzed his situation.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: The Idiot became a Mad ManAngela held on tight to the edge of the bed, her mind anxiously racing as worry filled her widened eyes.\u201cPoor Alexander, I hope the fall didn\u2019t damage his brain. Although he wasn\u2019t very bright before, at least he could talk.\u201dAt the moment, a loud, arrogant echoed from beyond the doorway.\u201cAlexander! I heard that you were injured.\u201d A grimace flickered across the girls\u2019 faces as they turned towards the source of the sound. The voice drew the tone out as if to mockingly be concerned.\u201cIs everything alright?\u201dFei looked up and noticed that a well-dressed, chubby man had barged through the doors to the palace bedroom. An icy laugh slipped between his crooked lips.\u201cGill, what are you doing here?\u201d Angela said coldly. Fei felt the tension between the shady, obese newcomer and the beauty beside him.It was clear that they were not on good terms.\u201cHaha\u2026 Angela, my angel, whatever do you mean? I heard my dear friend Alexander got injured and was worried. What\u2019s wrong with me coming by to check up on him?\u201dThe fat noble casually walked up and sat right on a side of the bed as if it was his own.\u201cGill, what are you doing! How dare you to sit on the bed of the king!\u201d Emma angrily exclaimed.Gill shot a look at Emma. Lust and malice flashed through his eyes. He licked his thick, sausage-like lips and retorted. \u201cShut up, you low class slave. Don\u2019t say anything that you\u2019ll regret.\u201d He then leisurely turned around and glanced at Fei. The expression was not someone showing empathy for an injured friend, but more like the gloating of looking at an injured animal. Fei was looking at Gill at the same time.He felt the scorn, malice and sarcasm in Gill\u2019s eyes; Gill was not hiding his feelings even a little bit.Fei was confused. \u201cIs this ugly meatball really Alexander\u2019s friend? His face has so many chins, yet he\u2019s brave enough to show that mess to even the king? Does he have a strong family background as well?As Fei was thinking, Gill started to squish Fei\u2019s face with his oily hands as if it was a toy. The move was so natural that it seemed like Gill has done it thousands of times.\u201cAlexander, looks like you are fine, Haha. I have a few important guests this afternoon to host, so how about you come with me?\u201d Gill was smiling, but the tone at which he said it was not like an invitation but a command.He squished Fei\u2019s face a little bit more, and slapped it a little. Gill loved this feeling \u2014 treating the king like a pet.He then started thinking out loud, about how was it possible that someone like Alexander became the king. \u201cHe has a three year old\u2019s intelligence at the age of seventeen, yet why does the god love him so much that he gave him the throne?\u201dWhen Gill was enjoying himself, something unexpected happened.\u201cSlap!\u201dGill covered up his left cheek with his hand. A vivid red hand mark had appeared on his cheek just like paint being flung onto an abstract painting. His expression was the textbook definition of shock.Both Angela and Emma had felt uncomfortable when Gill appeared but the slap had shocked them as well. They couldn\u2019t believe what they saw.Alexander had always acted meek and cowardly and thus he had always been picked on by Gill due to his unwillingness to fight back.\u201cHe just smacked Gill\u2019s face! Did that actually just happen?\u201d Although it was shocking, they were thrilled. They had tolerated Gill for a long time.\u201cHow \u2026 how dare you!\u201d\u201cFag, if you touch me again with your disgusting hand, I\u2019m gonna shove my foot up your ass!\u201d Fei said.Gill had made Fei very frustrated, and Fei was not a gentle person when dealing with people that make him upset.Gill shoved a fat sausage finger at Fei and screamed. He was so mad that all the fat on his body was shaking as if he was a Parkinson inflicted pudding.\u201cHow dare you slap me, you bastard!\u201d Gill yelled again and again.Fei didn\u2019t respond. He was trying to push his body up.\u201cHow dare he yell at the palace?\u201d Fei was perplexed. None of the king\u2019s guards showed up like they were supposed to. \u201cCould he really be someone that important that a king can\u2019t punish?\u201dAs Fei was thinking, Gill had made a mad decision. He pounced at Fei, seeming like he wanted revenge.\u201cStop it!\u201d Angela commanded, \u201cGill, you are just the son of a Minister, how dare you do such a thing!\u201dNo matter what Angela was shouting, nothing affect Gill as he kept his eyes locked on Fei. Angela and Emma tried their best to protect Fei by pulling on Gill\u2019s robes.However, there was no way the both of them were any match for Gill.\u201cSlap!\u201dFrustrated Gill slapped Emma across her face. The force send her back a couple yards. Her pretty face was swelling up on the cheek as tears filled her eyes.Gill grabbed Angela by her wrist next and pulled her towards him. He lowered his head onto Angela\u2019s neck. He sniffed a couple time enjoyably and pervertedly said: \u201cBeautiful Angela, this retarded Alexander is never going to be good enough for you. Look at him, he doesn\u2019t resemble anything of a king. He had made a mess of Chambord Kingdom after just inheriting the throne. Hehe, Angela; how about becoming my women.\u201dHe was holding tight onto Angela\u2019s wrist; the warm and smooth sensation of her body broke down the last bit of his reasoning. He forgot he was inside the king\u2019s palace and Angela was the future queen. In the momentum that came from his loss of sanity, he tried to kiss Angela\u2019s lips forcefully.Suddenly.\u201cPeng!\u201dA metal helmet \u201ckissed\u201d his forehead instead. But with that amount of force, it was more like a smack of a hammer.This attack was so sudden that Gill didn\u2019t even see it coming. Surprised at the blood gushing out of the wound, he screamed as he fell back and let go of Angela\u2019s wrist.Angela once again witnessed something that she thought wouldn\u2019t happen in this life time and was speechless.As Fei picked up the helmet off the ground, he sneered: \u201cHow dare you touch my woman, you fat motherfucker! How dare you touch the King! I\u2019m gonna beat you until you become quadriplegic or, I swear to god, I\u2019m not the King!\u201dHe was feeling better as he swore, thinking to himself. \u201cMan, I was scared by this fat tub of lard. I thought he was some important figure, but it turned out that he is just the son of a minister. I can fuck him up any day of the week!\u201dIt was dead silent in the royal bedroom. They could hear the sound of a needle dropping onto the ground.Although there were already many times Fei\u2019s actions had shocked both Angela and Emma, This time, they sensed that something was different. \u201cIt is not possible! How could it be?\u201d They stared at Fei \u201cIt feels like the seventeen years old retard Alexander who listened to Gill all the time has \u2026 changed.\u201dGill was lying motionless on the floor. His mind was blank. He sensed that Alexander\u2019s personality has changed too much.Fei\u2019s actions in Alexander\u2019s body had scared Gill due to how out of character it was. That blow from the helmet was full of power and felt as though Fei was actually trying to kill him.After a couple seconds, he calmed down. He thought about why he came to the palace today and he decided to give it all he\u2019s got.He lifted his left hand and a strange and mysterious spell rolled off of his tongue. A ball of fire was forming upon his hand and a burning sensation was filling the whole palace.Gill forgot how he felt earlier and suddenly became a lot braver. He mocked at Fei: \u201cYou, the King? Ha. Except yourself, who do you think considers you as our king in the entire Chambord Kingdom? How dare you hit me? Alexander, prepare to feel the wrath of a prestige mage!\u201dFei was still posing in a brave posture trying to impress Angela and Emma. But when he saw the fireball forming, his pupil contracted a little: \u201c Ma..Mage? Holy shit this dumb fucker is a mage? Looks like he\u2019s got some skills. What should I do? Man I shouldn\u2019t have made that decision under impulse. If I knew this, I would have tried to talk him out of it rather than using force\u2026\u201dFei was trying to think of a solution to this hot mess.He looked at the burning fireball on Gill\u2019s hand and the dented helmet in his hand and thought: \u201cWhat the hell is this? If we are going to fight, at least give me a sword or some sort of weapon.\u201d He thought for a few seconds and started yelling, \u201cGuards\u2026 Guards! Assassins! Someone is trying to assassinate me!\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s no use!\u201dGill laughed as he flicked his hand and the red hot projectile flew toward Fei\u2019s face like a bullet.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Don\u2019t ever do that\u201cAAAAHHHHHH!!!\u201dAngela screamed. As the flames grew in Gill\u2019s hand, she frantically looked for ways to stop him. However, it was all useless.\u201cShit!\u201d Fei couldn\u2019t do anything else but to try to block it with the helmet he was holding in his hand.Boom! The fireball collided with the helmet, producing a burst of sparks and smoke. The helmet had turned red hot and splattered as it started to melt.\u201cSsii\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei smelled burned flesh.He rushed as he tried to get the melting metal helmet off of his hand. Although he acted as fast as he could, the layer of skin on his inner palm had burned off already.The fireball appeared to have run out of energy, fizzing and finally became extinguished.Fei didn\u2019t have time to relax as he immediately saw another fireball forming upon Gill\u2019s hand.Judging from Gill\u2019s sweaty face, it was obvious that he was concentrating extremely hard to finish Fei off with this one.This time, Fei had nothing to block it with.\u201cThis is not fair!\u201d Fei yelled \u201cI challenge you to a wrestling match! Didn\u2019t your parents teach you that kids playing with fire will pee their pants!?\u201d\u201cWhat??\u201d Angela and Emma were shocked speechless. \u201cSince was there such as saying?\u201d\u201cLooks like Alexander is still an idiot.\u201d Both of them thought disappointedly.However, what they didn\u2019t notice was that Fei had slowly moved to the other side of the bed and managed to pick up the cuirass that he wore on the walls. He hid it behind his back as he slowly inched his way back towards Gill.\u201cJust wait! Once you get in my reach, I will teach you a lesson in place of your parents!\u201d Fei calculated the distance between them and was preparing to use some sneaky and dirty tactics to deal with Gill.But \u2014\u201cPee your own motherfucking pants!\u201dGill was furious, he was not going to hold back his wrath of a \u201cPrestigious mage\u201d. He made up his mind to punish the \u201cretard king\u201d for what he did.\u201cHu\u2014\u201dThe second fireball was flung towards Fei.Angela reacted fast. Although she so scared that her face paled, she made up her mind to save Fei by blocking the fireball with her body.Seeing Angela suddenly appear in front of Fei, Gill went into shock and tried to retrieve his fireball. However, it was already too late.Fei reacted immediately, \u201cShit!\u201d. Without thinking, Fei grabbed Angela\u2019s shoulder and pressed her against his chest as he turned his body around. He felt the heat scorch across his back.\u201cShit! I\u2019m gonna die!!\u201dAt very moment,\u201cPu\u2013 !\u201dA big hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the fireball. It gave it a light squeeze, completely indifferent to the extreme heat radiating off of it. Fei watched with wide eyes as the fireball that could melt a metal helmet collapsed like an ice cream in a hot summer day.Hope was restored to Fei as he let go of Angela.\u201cA master!\u201d He thought.At the same time, the Gill\u2019s face froze. He stared at the man who appeared in the palace, his face turning paler than flour and his body starting to shake uncontrollably.Like a mouse that saw a cat, Gill was so scared that his voice turned into a completely different tone: \u201c Mr. Lam\u2013lam\u2013lampard, Why\u2013y\u2013y are you here? I\u2013I\u2013I\u2013\u201dGill started sweating like crazy as he tried to explain himself.This \u201cMr. Lampard\u201d didn\u2019t even look at Gill. He turned around and slightly bowed to Angela respectfully, and then looked at Fei coldly and said \u201cAlexander, you majesty.\u201dFei took a detailed look at this \u201cMaster\u201dIn front of him stood a handsome, 6 foot 5 Caucasian man. With hair so red and vivid, it looked like a mane of burning fire.What stood out the most was the huge 5 foot long sword he was carrying on his back. It was as black as coal and looked to weigh about 200 pounds.The thing that confused Fei was that although this \u201cmaster\u201d was strong, his face was a bit pale. Fei guessed that he may have been injured in the siege.Fei also felt strange. Lampard saved him, but he wasn\u2019t very friendly towards him. Fei sensed a little bit of sad and hopelessness in his stares. Fei didn\u2019t know who he really was so he just noded in response.\u201cMr. Lam\u2013Lampard, can I go now?\u201d Gill was extremely scaredLampard didn\u2019t even look at him: \u201cGo? Aren\u2019t you going to explain your offensive behaviour towards the king?\u201d\u201cAh, Explain? Well\u2026you know\u2026 I was only joking. Yeah! joking! You know I had grown up with him, right? I just didn\u2019t control my magic properly. I\u2019m only a novice mage, not even a star rank..\u201dGill quickly found an excuse.He was BSing so fluently that he almost believed in what he was saying.As he was spewing out excuses, he saw sensed a cold stare as sharp as a blade on his neck from Lampard. He knew that this man could kill him as easily as an ant. He was scared to continue to say anything so he shut himself up and sheepishly smiled.Lampard had a disgusted look on his face.He closed his hand and everyone in the palace felt an invisible pressure.But Lampard\u2019s face showed that he had thought of something. He hesitated a bit; then opened his palm again and the pressure was gone. \u201cGet out of here! There\u2019s no next time!\u201d Lampard said as if he was shooing away a fly.\u201cOk ok ok..\u201d Gill was relieved like a prisoner who received death penalty just got a pardon. He exhaled rapidly and bowed down to the tall man carrying the sword.\u201cWait!\u201dAs Gill was preparing to leave this place, Fei suddenly stopped him.Gill looked at Lampard, but the old man didn\u2019t say a word. He had to stop and listen to what Fei had say.Fei gave his widest smile as he got closer and closer to Gill.He casually put his hand onto Gill\u2019s shoulder. Everyone thought the king was going to say something to comfort Gill because of his friendliness.However-He didn\u2019t say anything and started to slap Gill on the face like crazy. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again! Don\u2019t ever fucking do that again!\u201d He kept on yelling as he was slapping.\u201cPia \u2013 Pia \u2013 Pia \u2013 Pia \u2014\u201dThe sound of the slaps almost formed a symphony.Fei\u2019s action send Angela and Emma into a shock once more. The \u201ccold\u201d faced Lampard was surprised by this as well.\u201cIs this brutal and crazy man the king? Is this really the idiot king Alexander?Poor Gill didn\u2019t know what to do. The appearance of Lampard had scared him into not using his abilities, and now he\u2019s afraid to even defend himself against Fei\u2019s assault.Gill regretted what he did as Fei gets his revenge. \u201cIf I knew Alexander became this shameless after being shot by an arrow, I\u2019d never have come here !\u201d He cried in his mind.Fei finally stopped as his hand became numb.Gill thought his nightmare was over as he stopped sniveling like a bitch.Who knew that Fei rubbed his hands and kicked Gill right in the nether regions? He screamed in pain. His body quickly reacted by mimicking a fried shrimp. He bent his back and started to desperately crawl out of the palace as if he was escaping hell.He had finally learnt his lesson and didn\u2019t want to ever see this insane king ever again.\u201cYou got lucky this time!\u201d Fei yelled at Gill.He was a simple man. He was not going to taking any sort of humiliation and act like nothing happen. He wanted revenge on the spot.After releasing his anger on GIll, he felt much better.As Fei turned around, He saw the shocked expressions on Angela, Emma and Lampard\u2019s face. They were staring at him as if he was some unknown monster.\u201cShit! Did I over react?\u2019 Fei thought.\u201cOh! My head is dizzy, I\u2019m fainting!\u201d He fell onto the floor.Angela and Emma who still have the hand mark on her face got nervous, they thought the arrow injury was reoccurring again. They dragged him to the bed.Lampard looked at Fei. He was suspicious of Fei\u2019s terrible acting but he didn\u2019t say anything. He asked Angela about Fei\u2019s arrow injury, comforted both Angela and Emma a little and left with a ton of questions on his mind.\u201cMy Majesty, the enemies are still sieging, looks like your soldiers can\u2019t defend any longer.\u201d This is the last thing Lampard said before he leftAngela and Emma stood by him for a while. After seeing no sign of Fei waking up, Angela took Emma to the priest to get her face treated.\u2026After only Fei was left in the palace, he calmed down and started to think about the whole situation.Obviously he was in another universe.Not only Angela and Emma, but that meatball-shaped magician\u2019s magic and that mysterious old master\u2019s powerful skills had proven it.Fei was a poor graduate student. He grew up in an orphanage. He was in a hopeless situation because he had incurred a lot of debt for university but couldn\u2019t find a job to pay it off. After thinking about it, Fei concluded that becoming the king in another universe was not a bad thing.\u201cAs a king, I probably can do anything I want!\u201d He thought. He couldn\u2019t wait to use his powers.He started to map his situation.\u201cLooks like on my way back to my apartment, I was hit by a bright disk of some sort. I\u2019m probably died on the spot, but somehow my soul came to this universe and possessed the body of this Alexander.\u201dFrom what has happened, Fei pieced together that this young king only had the intelligence of a 3 year old. He didn\u2019t know what had happened to the last king, but the throne was taken by this Alexander. Obviously, all the ministers were opposed to this young king.Fei remembered getting shot by an arrow and then waking up in this bed.\u201cProbably by the time on the wall, my soul had just gained possession of this body. I\u2019m not sure where the \u2018original\u2019 Alexander went, but I\u2019m the new Alexander now!\u201dThe original Alexander the king was really an idiot.Fei possessed his body and for sure took over his memories as well. All he got was the basic information such as the language spoken in this kingdom and some simple hobbies that the previous tenant of this body had. Other than that, Fei had no idea how big this kingdom was and how everything else worked. He only knew Angela, his fianc\u00e9 after he woke up in this world for the first time and he had no recollection of Gill and Lampard.\u201cThank God this guy was dumb, from now on when I mimic him, no one can tell I\u2019m someone different.\u201d Fei touched his chin and nodded.But suddenly, he remembered something else. \u201cBefore Lampard left, he mentioned something about enemies sieging the castle and that the soldiers can\u2019t defend any longer!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dFei almost jumped out of the bed. \u201cAm I going to be a slave right after I became the king?\u201dThe pressure of survival and reality scared Fei\u201cMaybe I should pack up and sneak out of here? Shit! How can I sneak out when the enemies have already surrounded the castle. Can \u201cmaster\u201d Lampard kill them? Wait, he is just one man, how can he face off an army? Plus, the enemies probably have \u201cmasters\u201d too!\u201dFei had no idea how he was going to get out of this situation.When he was on earth, he was just a student. He had no talent in military nor in fighting. The best he could do was to handle a drunk dude at the bar. If you want him to lead an army, he didn\u2019t have enough strength to wear a full metal armour.Fei was furious. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just live my ordinary life on earth, I don\u2019t want to be the king anymore!\u201dAt this moment \u2014\u201cCollecting player\u2019s information \u2026\u2026. 20%\u2026\u2026. 50%\u2026\u2026. 88%\u2026\u2026. 100%.

Entering Diablo world in 3\u20262\u20261\u2026 enter!\u201dLike the characters in the TV series Stargate who travel through the stargate, Fei felt dizzy and a mysterious and strange wave went through his body.\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011Fei stood like a zombie at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011where the new players spawn in the game Diablo. His mind was blank.He had been standing here for the last 5 minutes.5 minutes ago, after the 3 second countdown in his mind by the voice; his vision blurred and he landed here.This was a real Diablo world.A perfect and lively world.This was the conclusion Fei came to after the 5 minutes.The sky was dark and the rain was pouring down. An unknown dark green bryophyte had grown all over the ground. Dark soil appeared further away. The camp was empty.\u201cCluck, cluck, cluck\u201d only a few hungry hens were seeking food in the rain.A cold breeze blew through Fei and he shook in the cold.The vivid sensation from every nerve in his body reminded him that this was real, this was a real world, not a stiff 2D computerized screen.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: \u201cBarbarian\u201d Fei\u201cWhy am I here? What happened?\u201dThe recent events left confused Fei even more. The only thing he knew for sure was that he had magically appeared in this Diablo-esque world after that mysteriously cold voice read off some familiar loading screen lingo. Looking around, Fei saw that he had become a \u201cBarbarian\u201d, which Fei recognized was one of the game characters.The rusty hand axe appeared in his right hand and a battered, junk-like buckler in his left. It didn\u2019t take long for Fei to subconsciously understand his status in the game.The next second, a high tech like screen popped up in front of him out of nowhere, just like those in Iron Man\u2019s mansion.Gamer: FeiClass: BarbarianLevel: 1Experience: 0/5000Strength: 30Dexterity: 20Intelligence: 10Vitality: 20Damage: 3-7Accuracy: 102Armor: 11Endurance: 92Health: 45Resource (Fury): 10Fire-Resistance: 0Cold-Resistance: 0Lightning-Resistance: 0Poison-Resistance: 0\u2026\u2026\u201cThese are my attributes in the game?\u201dFei saw his name on the top of the screen. \u201cWhat the heck! I just became the king and now I\u2019m in a game world? And a barbarian? NO! At least let me be classier like a wizard or a crusader.\u201dAt this moment, an armored man in blue rushed over.\u201cGreetings, stranger. I\u2019m not surprised to see your kind here. Many adventurers have traveled this way since the recent troubles began. No doubt you\u2019ve heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, walks the world again\u2026\u2026\u201dThe man just went on and on with his dialogue. Fei\u2019s jaw dropped.As one of the original fans of Diablo, Fei could immediately see that this man was Warriv, a NPC (Non-playable character) from the\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011by the way he dressed and his dialogue lines. Every time a new player spawns, this dude will run to the player with a big golden question mark over his head.Fei observed him while listening to his lines.Neither his movement nor his facial expression felt like an NPC. If Fei didn\u2019t recognize this man, he would have thought that Warriv was a real person. Even the heat that he exhaled while speaking turned into a white fog in this cold air. Fei even felt the moist sensation from it.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if the NPCs in this world have any intelligence?\u201dAfter Warriv finished his long speech, Fei purposely asked a few questions.\u201cHey, what\u2019s your mother\u2019s maiden name? What street did you grown up on?\u201dHowever, Warriv didn\u2019t bother answering him. He just walked away after he finished.He still left Fei clueless.After thinking for a while, Fei decided to go find another person \u2013 Priestess Akara.From his gaming memory, if he remembered correctly, the first ever quest in Diablo\u2019s first map \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011was from her, a high priestess from the sisterhood of the \u201cSightless Eye\u201d. On top of that, she was also the leader of the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011so Fei had to find her if he wants to know what was going on.The streets were quiet and lifeless.Fei passed through a few tents and fences and finally spotted priestess Akara\u2019s tent behind a wooden cage wagon. There were lots of weirdly shaped bottles and jars surrounding the tent. Fei was quite far away and could already smell the strange odours coming from them.Akara, who was wearing a purple nun robe, was standing in front of the tent.Fei walked over and a golden question mark appeared above Akara\u2019s head.\u201cI am Akara, High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I welcome you, traveler \u2026\u2026\u201d Akara started to introduce herself, the same as in the original game.As expected, after the conversation, she gave Fei a quest.\u201cThe Den of Evil\u201d, kill all the evil creatures in an evil cave at\u3010Blood Moor\u3011 just outside of the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011. It\u2019s exactly as Fei remembered. A red button was projected on the left side of Fei\u2019s vision.He pressed the button and a detailed description came up. It looked like there weren\u2019t any other choice so he accepted the quest.Fei tried to organize his words to appear more sophisticated. \u201cHonorable Akara, may I know more information about this place?\u201dHe wanted to know if any of the NPCs had any intelligence and he hoped he could get some clues about why he appeared in this world.\u201cYoung traveller, you have to complete your quest first before you can know more\u2026\u201dAkara\u2019s answer surprised Fei.This is not something that was scripted in the original game. That showed that in this world, NPCs had some freedom, and that they aren\u2019t some rigid pre-programmed code.Fei wanted to ask more, but Akara turned around and went into her tent.He tried to follow her but was blocked by a mysterious force and couldn\u2019t get within 1 meter of the entrance.\u201cLooks like I have to complete the quest first\u2026\u201dAfter failing to get any answers from a couple other NPCs in the\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, Fei walked out the gate that was guarded by a female rogue, and stepped into the dangerous\u3010Blood Moor\u3011where a ton of monsters were lurking around.\u201cWarning!! Gamer Fei, you have enter \u3010Blood Moor\u3011. Killing monsters will grant you unexpected surprises\u2026 But if you fail your quest, you will receive some mysterious penalties!\u201d said a mysterious voice before laughing like a maniac.Fei recognized it as the voice that appeared in his mind earlier. It went by so fast, that Fei only heard the first couple sentences. The laughter was filled with gloat; however, compared with the cold, machine like tone before, it\u2019s definitely more human like this time.\u2026\u2026After three hours,\u201cKacha!\u201dFei chopped the twentieth \u3010Quill Rat\u3011with his axe. A white beam of light came down from the sky and embraced Fei.\u201cLevel up!\u201dThis is not the first time that it happened, and Fei was expecting it. It\u2019s very comfortable in the light, Fei felt like moaning. All the bleeding wounds from fighting the monsters closed and healed within three seconds.After four or five second, the light disappeared.Two dark red buttons appeared in front of Fei. The one on the left was labeled\u3010New Attributes Points\u3011 and the one on the right read\u3010New Skill Points\u3011. These are the rewards each time after leveling up.Fei first opened up the\u3010New Attributes Points\u3011 menu.Every time after leveling up, there will be five points for Fei to improve his physique. He distributed three points to \u3010Strength\u3011 and two points to \u3010Vitality\u3011without thinking. Those were the primary attributes of a \u201cBarbarian\u201d.He then opened up \u3010New Skill Points\u3011and distributed the one point he got from leveling up to \u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011Fei is now a level five \u201cBarbarian\u201d. All the twenty five attribute points were distributed to \u3010Strength and\u3010Vitality\u3011. Out of the five skill points, three were distributed to \u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011and two to the Warcry skill\u3010Howl\u3011.The reason he did it is because this is a real world.As a player, Fei gets injured and wounded from fight the monsters. He doesn\u2019t just lose health, he felt one hundred percent of the pain as well.What is worth mentioning is that everything in this world is real, even the monsters. They are not programs nor codes. Their screams, spewing blood and chopped up bodies were irritating Fei\u2019s nerves every second.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Quest CompletedFei had quickly acclimatized to the situation. He had gone from being so nauseated from the gore that he was throwing up after killing the first monster, to becoming cold and indifferent despite the carnage that was left in his wake. All the heated monster blood on Fei\u2019s body made him feel like he was enduring a test from hell. After only a couple hours, Fei had become used to this. He was almost turning into a cold-blooded killing machine.This game existed literally for the purpose of killing.It was so real.Even the painfulness and soreness in his muscles.Fei was not sure that if he died in this realistic game world, he would respawn just like how it was in the original game; but he didn\u2019t dare to try. There was too much at stake.From the past three hours of killing, Fei had noticed that his knowledge about the original game weren\u2019t completely applicable in this world. He was trying his best to establish a rough understanding about the natural order of this world.In this cruel, bloody world,\u3010Strength\u3011 and\u3010Vitality\u3011were the most important attributes to a \u201cBarbarian\u201d. A lot of\u3010Strength\u3011will allow your attacks to be stronger, and a lot of\u3010Vitality\u3011will not only allow you to be more durable during battle, but also give you enough endurance to run away from the blood seeking monsters.The reason why Fei distributed skill points onto \u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011and warcry\u3010Howl\u3011is because: he had no idea how to handle and use weapons properly, he was just an ordinary student, so\u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011will allow him to use his hand axe more efficiently; and \u3010Howl\u3011can scare the monsters away when he gets surrounded.Threats from monsters and the risk of dying forced Fei to considering survival way more than the future development of the character.After distributing all the points, Fei opened up his \u3010Character Status\u3011,Gamer: FeiCharacter: BarbarianLevel: 5Experience: 14949/22680Strength: 45Dexterity: 20Intelligence: 11Vitality: 30Damage: 10-27Accuracy: 102Armor: 31Endurance: 107Health: 105Resource (Fury): 16Fire-Resistance: 0Cold-Resistance: 0Lightning-Resistance: 5Poison-Resistance: 0\u2026\u2026This status was way more impressive than the one that Fei started with. It was almost as if you could say \u2026 that they were not on the same level.Not all these improvements came from leveling though as Fei had a few special items.He had gotten a few armors and weapons from killing monsters and he had already equipped them all. There was one \u3010Tangerine\u2019s Helmet\u3011that gave him +1 intelligence and + 5% Lightning-Resistance attributes.After checking the\u3010Character Status\u3011menu, he opened up his\u3010Item Slot\u3011.In this world, Fei\u2019s item slot was a spatial ring that he wore on his finger. It had 40 blocks of storage space. Every block can store stuff such one \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011. However, items did scale in this world so axes or swords may take up four to eight blocks, depending on how big they were.Fei\u2019s item slots were full.He thought about what to do next and decided to go back to\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011. He used a\u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011that he had when he spawned in this world.\u201cBuzzzzzz\u2026\u201dA three meter high, blue lighting oval appeared with a slight buzzing noise. Fei hesitated a little bit and stepped into it.As Fei expected, he stepped into the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 when left the portal on the other side.Suddenly, he felt nauseous. He felt as though he had just stepped off a particularly fast rollercoaster that involved a lot of twists and loops. Fei closed his eyes for a few seconds to get over the \u201cportal sickness\u201d.After sitting down and regaining his bearings, Fei looked around and found priestess Akara.This high priestess was not only a source for quests, but also a crafty merchant. She sold staves, and potions for battle, as well as scrolls and keys. Fei wanted to prepare really well for his first quest \u201cDen of Evil\u201d so that he would not get himself killed by the monster in the evil cave. From what he could remember, there was a zombie boss called \u3010Corpsefire\u3011in there.Although finding out what has brought him into this weird world was important, he at least needed to survive until he could find out.Fei sold all the items such as gloves, broken wands and spears, the stuff he got from the monster but didn\u2019t need and got roughly 800 gold. Plus the gold he looted directly from the monsters, he had a total of 1,400 gold.He put all the money into good use and bought some items from Akara.A double axe with a damage rating of 6-15, and a suit of leather armour with a defense rating of 13. He equipped both of them and bought a couple bottles of \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011, four \u3010Town Portal Scrolls\u3011, and three \u3010Identify scrolls\u3011for identifying the weapons and armours that he will get from the monsters.Fei felt a reassuring increase in his strength and power, originating from his new weapon and armour. He confidently returned to the portal that was created by him earlier.\u201cBuzzzzzz\u2026.\u201dAfter returning to the dangerous \u3010Blood Moor\u3011following the slight buzz, Fei found the\u3010Den of Evil\u3011 on his map and headed that direction carefully. After looking at the situation within the cave, Fei thanked past Fei for his cautious preparations.In this world, monsters in caves and dens seemed to be more aggressive and brutal than the ones on the moor. There were not only \u3010Quill Rats\u3011,\u3010Zombies\u3011,\u3010Fallen Shaman\u3011and \u3010Vampire\u3011who could cast fireballs, which were common monsters that Fei saw on the moor, but also this monster called\u3010Gargantuan Beast\u3011who looked like an ape. It had powerful attacks and thick skin for defense.Fei started his wipe out mission in the den.Since he was level 5; his damage and defense was high enough for him to breeze through the regular monsters.Blood was spilling, monsters were screaming and Fei furiously hacked his way through the cave.Fei had become the spitting image of a grim reaper, covered in blood as he cut through the swathes of monsters coming his way. His double axe split the monsters lengthwise like a samurai sword through hot butter. Even when there was a crowd of monsters, he would sprint to the center of them and use his skill \u3010Howl\u3011 so that he could finish them off one by one after they were scared and running away.He also saw a lot of ruined human corpses in the den.Some were on the ground, some were chained onto the pillars, with intestines falling out and missing eyeballs. Even some female rogues were raped by these hideous monsters. With flies circling around these rotten corpses, the scenes were too horrifying for anyone to look at.Fei\u2019s mind was filled with anger.Although Fei knew that this scenario originated from a game, he couldn\u2019t help but to situate himself as a human of this world. With all the anger burning in his chest, he went into this mad mode where he smashed and crushed monsters like they were nothing.Finally, after god knows how long, when the last monster in front of Fei had died screaming in its own blood, beams of golden light fell from the sky and shined up every corner of the den.Shortly after, a familiar voice spoke in Fei\u2019s mind \u2013\u201cCongratulations, gamer Fei. You have completed priestess Akara\u2019s quest and passed the first test of this Diablo world. Now you shall return to Rogue Encampment and receive your prizes from Akara\u2026\u201dThis voice cleared Fei\u2019s mind.He breathed heavily and glanced at his surroundings. He was surprised to find out that all the monsters had been killed by him already. Even the boss of the den,\u3010Corpsefire\u3011,was dead on the ground. A pile of gold coins and various items was lying around the mess that had become of its body.\u201cDid I go crazy?\u201dFei thought about what had happened. He couldn\u2019t believe what he saw in the game world triggered his deep anger. However, it wasn\u2019t his fault; this world is too real. Anyone would feel the same way.He stood there for a while and then started to clean up battle ground.The gold coins didn\u2019t take any blocks in the \u3010Item Slot\u3011so he picked them up first. Then he started to pick up the more valuable items from \u3010Corpsefire\u3011. Two magic items had drawn Fei\u2019s attention. He drooled as the two items glowed in a soft blue light.But\u2026\u201cShit! A \u3010Grim Wand \u3011and a\u3010Javelin \u3011??? Are you serious??? Why aren\u2019t there any barbarian items???\u201dAfter actually inspecting what those two items were, Fei was super disappointed. It was like seeing a lake in the middle of the desert when you are also dying of thirst, and realizing it was only a mirage after.\u201cFuck my luck!\u201dThere was nothing Fei could do about it. He picked two unidentified magic item and planned to sell them off to Akara for a good price.After he picked everything up, he used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011.He was ready to go back to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011and claim his rewards from Akara. He also wanted to ask her about how and why he appeared in this game world.This question was bothering him for a long time.At this moment, the mysterious, cold voice spoke again!\u201cWarning!

What\u2019s that?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t expecting something like this to happen just as he was just getting ready to go back to the\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.Fei\u2019s vision blurred the next second. The whole world started to twist and fade right in front of his eyes. Then complete darkness hit him.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Fei reopened his eyes, and found himself in the king\u2019s palace again.Magnificent decors, splendid furniture and the dark red, gold gilded king sized bed were the complete opposite of the dark, bloody feel of the Diablo world.\u201cWhat happened? Did I \u2026 just have a nightmare?\u201d Fei was confused.Fei was still lying on the bed. The only differenxce between pre-\u201dnightmare\u201d and post-\u201dnightmare\u201d was that he felt very hot and was dripping sweat; as if he just came out of a sauna room.He pushed himself up the bed, and surprisingly found out that the dizziness he felt when he just woke up in this world disappeared, so were the pain from his head and chest injuries.\u201cHow did\u2026 was that not a dream?\u201dFei subconsciously felt that something special had happened to him, but he couldn\u2019t point out where. The whole palace was quiet. No one was around. Fei got out of the bed, and stretched a little.\u2018Zipp\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u2019The sound of ripping cloth.Fei\u2019s white knight turtleneck shirt suddenly got teared open on many spots. If you looked at him at that moment, you would probably conclude that he was a homeless guy, judging from the ripped shirt, as well as his torn pants.\u201cDamn, what is this?\u201dFei got a little scared.All the stuff that happened to him made his nerves a little bit weaker. He felt as though he was close to having a mental breakdown.He looked down and upon closer inspection, he realized that the clothes he was wearing was a little bit small for his size. When he was stretching, he easily tore open the uncomfortably small clothing.\u201cWhat\u2019s this pitiful quality? Who makes such clothes for a king?\u201dWind breezed through the palace, and Fei felt the chill. He was almost naked.\u201cCrap, I have to find something to wear.\u201dFei glanced around the palace and found a wardrobe-like piece of furniture. He opened it up and found that there were many luxurious clothing in it. He picked out a fitting black knight shirt and pants. He put them on and walked toward the mirror.The man in the mirror shocked Fei.It was a man about 6 feet tall. His shoulder long black hair was bundled to the back of his head by a ruby hair ring. His handsome, manly face and ripped body could make any women fall for him.\u201cGod damn! This handsome son of bitch in the mirror is me???\u201dFei wouldn\u2019t believe it, it was unreal for him. After the dancing around sketchily in front of the mirror and seeing that the man in the mirror mirrored his movements, he finally accepted it.\u201cHahaha, Man oh man oh man. Although that Alexander was a retard, but he\u2019s got quite a face! Haha, He is way more handsome than me\u201dFei can\u2019t stop posing in front of the mirror, as if he had just discovered a new continent.\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m Alexander!\u201d Fei said to himself happily.After his new discovery, He walked towards the row of medieval full knight armours at the centre of the palace. He picked a suit of armour about his height, and pulled out the double handed sword that the armour was holding. He swung the sword forcefully, trying to get a feel of power and being a king.But after he did that, his facial expression went weird.\u201cHow is this so light? This isn\u2019t a plastic toy is it?\u201dA majestic 5 feet long double handed sword had to weigh at least thirty to forty pounds. But Fei felt like he was holding a feather, there was no weight to it at all. It was strange.\u201cTink!\u201dFei struck the full metal armour with the sword just to see if the sword was a toy or not.But the unexpected happened \u2013The armour was one centimeter thick. The sword went through it easily, as if Fei was cutting through a piece of paper. The strike cut the armour in half, with the upper half of the armour shortly landing on the ground and making another \u201ctink\u201d sound.\u201cHoly shit!\u201dAlthough Fei didn\u2019t believe in god or ghosts, but there was no other way to explain what had happened.\u201cWhy am I so strong now?\u201dFei subconsciously swung the sword again, but he still didn\u2019t feel any weight.The double handed sword was clearly a real weapon.\u201cThis feeling\u2026\u201dFei closed his eye trying to remember the way he handled the sword. It felt the same as when he was a barbarian in the \u201cdream\u201d, swinging the double handed axe at the monsters.\u201cDid I\u2026\u201dFei was shocked.\u201cDid I bring back the power of my barbarian character from the \u2018dream\u2019 into the real world?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t get that thought out of his head and quickly went about to test this unlikely hypothesis. He put the sword back to the damaged armour, and looked at other weapons in the palace.Something quickly caught Fei\u2019s eyes.Further away at a corner of the palace was a huge, weirdly shaped double handed axe. The handle with the massive blade was at least five feet long, and looked to weigh about one hundred pounds. It stood by a black heavy armour. Its weight had put a dent in part of the tile floor.A bizarre looking carving on the body of the axe made it look even more intimidating.Fei rushed over there and picked it up. Suddenly, Fei felt the axe and him had become one, as if the axe was a part of his body.He closed his eyes again and concentrated on the feeling.\u201cThat\u2019s tight, this is the feeling of my level 3\u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011in the \u2018dream\u2019. Especially with axes, because I was a barbarian.\u201dThe double handed axe was like a windmill in Fei\u2019s hands. All the axe techniques was performed by Fei at a master level, as if he had used axes for more than tens of years.Fei felt that he can conclude that his hypothesis was proven completely.He had actually acquired all the skills, strengths, damage and all the attributes of the level 5 barbarian in the \u201cdream\u201d.The new found power had given Fei a profound sense of security.\u201cSo this is the feeling of power, I wonder what level this power belongs to in this magical world?\u201dAs Fei was feeling amazing about the new found power, He suddenly remembered that \u201cMaster\u201d Lampard said something about enemies still sieging the castle.\u201cMaybe I should go take a look.\u201d This thought grew stronger and stronger in Fei\u2019s mind.\u201cMaybe I could help with my power.\u201dFei decided to go. On the point of safety, He picked out the thickest, heaviest armour in the palace and put it on.This armour had literally covered Fei from head to toe, with the only openings being the holes for Fei to see through.Fei felt like he was wearing the first ever Iron Man suit from the movie [Iron Man I], the one that Robert Downey Jr. build in the Iraq.This fifty pound armour would literally anchor Fei to the ground; but now, Fei felt like he was wearing a Nike brand, ultrathin, sweat resistant running gear.Fei tapped the helmet with the axe.\u201cTink! Tink! \u2013\u201dFei was satisfied to hear the sound. \u201cHaha, no god damn arrows will get me now!\u201d\u201cKing Alexander! Roll out!\u201dFei looked around as he left the palace quietly.He was trying to show off in front of the guards, but who knew that there was no one guarding the king. The palace was just quite. As he kept walked, he saw two heavily wounded soldiers sleeping beside the palace\u2019s main gate.It looked like these two tired soldiers just came from the front line of battle.\u201cShit! My palace is only guarded by two wounded soldiers, the battle must be at its peak.\u201dThe battle cries were getting louder and louder as Fei got closer and closer to the main gate of the castle.\u201cThere is no time to waste!\u201d Fei thought as he started sprint even faster.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thanks for the donation!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Chambord Castle.Everyone\u2019s ears was filled with mournful screams and loud battle cries.Both the attackers and the defenders were giving the battle everything they got. It was either you die or I die.Waves of enemies who were wearing black, light armour was charging at the castle like a black tsunami. The three huge siege ladders were like war monsters; the barbs on the ladder hooked on to the edges of battlements, constantly sending more enemies to fight the defenders on the walls. The hooks made the siege ladders hard to get a rid of, and squads of around 30 enemies were fighting aggressively to protect the ladders.As time went on, more and more enemies had gotten onto the walls of the castle.It was not a good situation for Chambord Castle; there were ten times more enemies than the Chambord soldiers.\u201cPierce? Pierce\u2026where are you? You son of a bitch!\u201d A huge six feet eight man who had black hair and was wearing a vest of chainmail turned back and yelled as he was slashing at an enemy. \u201cPierce!, pick some big guys and get rid of those fucking ladders. Quick!\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201dNot too far away, white haired Pierce was soaked in blood. It was already hard to tell what was his and what was from the enemies he had slain. As he heard the command, he waved at a couple soldiers close to him \u201cCome on guys, let\u2019s go! We have to kill those motherfuckers and smash those ladders!\u201dWhite haired Pierce was known in Chambord for his brutal strength.As veins on his arms bulged, he started swinging his huge iron hammer that was the size of two basketballs. Like the legendary berserker, he cleared off enemies in his way as if they were flies. None of the enemies could stop him.He was approaching the siege ladders fast, leaving behind him a road of death and blood. About twenty other soldiers followed him. They were committed on completing the mission.The enemies that were defending the ladders had been alerted.\u201cAttention! Forward! Semi-Arc Formation!\u201dThe leader on the enemy defense team yelled!\u201cKata, kata, kata, kata!\u201dThe thirtyish enemies had formed a half circle beside the wall, and protected the three siege ladders in the half circle. With shark blades that were still dripping blood pointing outwards, they were like a metal Hedgehog, waiting for the attackers to make a mistake before capitalizing on it and finishing them off.These enemies definitely had more training than the soldiers of Chambord.Ten meters \u2026\u2026Six meters \u2026\u2026Three meters \u2026\u2026.One meter \u2026\u2026The distance between the soldier led by Pierce and enemies was vanishing in seconds.Finally \u2014\u2014-\u201cHooo! Go to hell!\u201dPierce suddenly yelled. He gave the hammer a full swing, as if it was a javelin, the hammer flew out of his hands and flew toward the enemy\u2019s formation.That giant bloody hammer made a beautiful trajectory of death in the air, and crashed through the defensive formation with devastating force.\u201cBash!\u201dIt caused massive damage to the enemies. Spilled blood, broken blades and limbs flew all over the place.The enemies definitely weren\u2019t expecting that type of maneuver. The flying hammer had made a bloody gap in the center of the formation.By destroying the three siege ladders, the enemies will have no way to get into Chambord Castle for now. After killing all the enemies that got on the defence wall, the defenders could finally get time to rest in safety. If not, the castle will be sieged and all their friends and families will become war slaves, with no hope of freedom for generations.After thinking about that, all the soldiers were motivated to defeat the enemies, their morale was so high that the blood in their bodies was almost burning.They couldn\u2019t allow the enemies to siege the castle. Even if they die, they weren\u2019t going to back off.\u201cCharge!!\u201d\u201cCharge!!!!!!!!\u201dThe soldiers followed Pierce, furiously charged into the enemies.Pierce rushed ahead, picked up the hammer that he had thrown out before any enemies could react, and started smashing away. His powerful swings forced off all the close enemies with the closest one not even having time to react before Pierce collapsed his head. None of them could stop him.\u201cSmash! Crush!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cClank!\u201dWeapons, armour and bare knuckles were colliding.Spurting blood, and detached limbs had painted the picture of hell.\u201cBoom!\u201dPierce smashed the sword and the enemy in front of him off the castle. He looked up and the ladder was right in front of him. He swung the hammer once more to back off the approaching enemies.\u201cDang! Dang! dang!\u201dHe sprinted forward and smashed all the hooks off of one ladder.\u201cFuck off!\u201dPierce kicked the ladder with force. He heard a lot of screams. As the ladder fell down, the enemies who were still climbing all fell towards the ground like dumplings. They were crushed by the heavy ladder into bloody meat paste instantly.\u201cNice!\u201dThe black haired commander saw what Pierce had done and yelled.\u201cPierce! Great job! Two more! Finish them all and I will buy you the best beer tonight! All you can drink!\u201d He was dueling with a thin but tall enemy while he yelled. This enemy was very skilled. Even though he was a commander, they were combating for about ten seconds and none of them had an advantage.\u201cHaha! Brook, Bossman! The beer is on you tonight!\u201dPierce replied excitedly. Although he was talking, he wasn\u2019t slow with his attacks. His hammer was fast as lightning; he did the same thing as he did to the first ladder\u201cDang! Dang! Dang!\u201dHe smashed all the hooks off of the second ladder. As he was about to kick it off of the wall,Suddenly \u2014\u2013\u201cDie! Punk!\u201dA black shadow flew up the defence wall. The rapier this enemy was using went straight to pierce\u2019s head. He was trying to instantly kill Pierce.There wasn\u2019t much time for Pierce to react. All he had time to do was to position his hammer so that his head was protected.\u201cDing!Ding!Ding!\u201dThese couple strikes all hit right in the center of the hammer and made some sparks.An unstoppable force passed through the hammer and shocked Pierce.Even though Pierce was born with an inhuman strength, he couldn\u2019t hold against it. The force pushed him back a four steps. It also broke a couple of his fingers and he almost couldn\u2019t hold on to the hammer any more.\u201cShit! A master!\u201d Pierce was surprised.However, this enemy stopped attacking him. As this enemy raised up the rapier again, Pierce heard a ton of screams. The enemy was moving so fast that he turned into a black shadow again. The other soldiers who came with Pierce all fell on the ground. As he took a more detailed look, all of them had a hole in their heads. White, red liquids were flowing out, they were the brains.\u201cBender! Bond! Tony! \u2026 My brothers!!!\u201d Pierce criedHe couldn\u2019t take what he saw, almost fainting from shock.His best friends who he was having fun with last night at the bar and he was trusting and loving a moment ago had been killed right in front of him. He felt like the sky had fallen down.\u201cDie! Demon!\u201dPierce yelled. He forgot about the wounds on his body. He stared at this enemy, gave up all the attempts to defence and charged ahead. This enemy had left more nasty wounds on Pierce\u2019s body and Pierce couldn\u2019t even touch him. But Pierce didn\u2019t care, he just kept on swinging his hammer.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s no use!\u201d This enemy laughed. He sounded like a crow.The rapier was too fast and this enemy was too strong.This enemy moved again, the rapier was aiming at Pierce\u2019s head again.Pierce tilted his body as if he was trying to dodge the strike, but the rapier went through his right shoulder easily. This enemy smiled disdainfully, he was going to pull out the rapier and end Pierce\u2019s life.But \u2014He was surprised to find out that he couldn\u2019t pull out the rapier no more ?!Blood spurted out of Pierce\u2019s mouth.But this white haired man started laughing.Laughing happily!This enemy didn\u2019t know what was going on, but he felt as though he had underestimated the enemy.But there was no time for him to react.Pierce grabbed the blade tightly with both hand; as if he didn\u2019t feel any pain,he left the rapier in his shoulder and slammed his body against this enemy. It took the rapier wielding man by surprise and he had to keep backing off.It only took them 3 second to reach the tip of the defence wall.If this enemy backed off any further, he would fall off this two hundred feet high wall. Even though he was powerful, but there was no way for him stay alive after fallen from such height.\u201cFuck!\u201dThis enemy was furious, but he had no option but to let go of his rapier.Getting forced by a low life soldier to let go of his favorite weapon, this enemy was ashamed of himself. He was a prestigious one star warrior.After he let go of the rapier, red flames started appearing around his body. Fists with the temperature that could melt iron landed on Pierce\u2019s back. He would eat this white haired man alive if he could.\u201cPu\u2026 Hahaha. I won this round, you son of a bitch!\u201dPierce puked a mouth full of blood, but he was laughing proudly.Pierce let go of the rapier, and charged at the second siege ladder. Because he had broke the hooks on this ladder early, he slammed it off the wall with his left shoulder. All the enemies climbing on this ladder fell to the ground and got crushed into piles of meat paste as well.\u201cShit! You low life slave! I swear I will kill everyone in this castle!This enemy was raged. Now he knew that this man wasn\u2019t trying to push him off of the wall, the plan was to destroy the second siege ladder all along; and he was fooled!He struck with the rapier at Pierce with all he got. Pierce had fainted from all the wounds and blood loss.\u201cShit! Be careful!\u201dBrook, the commander yelled anxiously. There was nothing he could do, he was still in close combat with the other skillful enemy.This siege battle had been taken almost the whole day. There were some powerful individuals on Chambord\u2019s side, but they had been focused on by the enemy commander. Even the three star warrior Lampard was tangled by an enemy star ranked warrior.At this time, there was no one there that could save Pierce\u2019s life!The rapier covered in flames was only one inch away from Pierce\u2019s neck!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: The DeathEveryone was expecting the death of Pierce, as no one was in a position to save his ass.\u201cHey, dumb ass! Try and dodge my ultra-concealed weapon!\u201dA confident voice rang from the other side of the battlefield. However, even though the enraged rapier wielding man didn\u2019t hear it, he felt something was aimed at the back of his head. An object was flying at him fast.He was surprised. He had to pull back the rapier and block whatever was flying at him.\u201c Pu!\u201dThe \u201cconcealed weapon\u201d was slashed in half, and red liquid splashed onto his head.\u201cWhat the fuck was that!?\u201dDue to his body\u2019s positioning, he had no indication of what the \u201cconcealed weapon\u201d was. He swung his rapier to make a sphere shape protection zone and ducked to prevent any more of the red liquid from landing on him. After he regained his bearings, he look up and saw what the \u201cconcealed weapon\u201d was. He immediately became more furious.The \u201cconcealed weapon\u201d was one of his own soldiers. Someone had grabbed and threw this poor guy at him and due to his carelessness, he didn\u2019t look and chopped that soldier in half.\u201cHaha, Are you scared now? Chicken!\u201dA gloating laughter had redrawn the attention of the rapier wielding man. He looked up and saw a man wearing a full heavy suit of armour with only openings on the armour for eye holes. In the light of the sunset, this man looked majestic like a god.That man didn\u2019t waste any time, he started charging right away; the momentum from his body caused collisions so powerful that all of the enemies got knocked off the wall.With the massive double handed axe in his hand, he was planning on taking this rapier warrior down.\u201cYou are seeking your own death, idiot!\u201d This enemy sneered as he saw that the new arrival was disadvantaging himself.Full heavy armours were used by cavalry soldiers like knights, never regular foot infantry. It was dumb to wear a fifty pound armour for close ranged combat, since it would slow your attacks and weigh you down. In this enemy\u2019s mind, that man was just a dumb idiot.\u201cGo hangout with the grim reaper!\u201dThe rapier warrior moved all the energy in his body onto his weapon. With flames appearing around the rapier again, he pierced towards the hulking armoured man charging at him.The strike was fast, as if it was lightning. The energy was overflowing from the rapier. This enemy had unleashed all his powers as a one star warrior. He was confident that he could kill this heavy armoured man with this strike.On the other head, the fully armoured \u201ciron man\u201d was still charging with no signs of slowing down. Like a dumbass in other\u2019s eyes, he wasn\u2019t even in a proper charging position. When soldiers charge, they would bend their backs and keep their weight low. With his chest wide open and back straight, that man was literally running into the blade.The enemy started laughing.\u201cHaha, there is no way you can make it out of here alive!\u201dBut \u2013\u201cTink!\u201d Sparks flashed.The laughter suddenly stopped and the smile froze on the warrior\u2019s face.The huge axe that man was dragging appeared in front of him from an impossible angle, and collided with the rapier right on the tip.\u201cHo\u2026.How?\u201dThis enemy was stunned.\u201cStriking the tip of my rapier with the axe when both of us were moving so fast? That could only be the technique of the god of war! Shit, this man was toying with me!\u201dThis enemy immediately regretted his decision and tried to back off.But it was too late!\u201cBoom!\u201dThe rapier couldn\u2019t hold up to that amount of power and snapped into pieces. The force of the axe didn\u2019t stop there; the rapier wielding warrior\u2019s hand almost exploded. If anyone who didn\u2019t know what had happened, they wouldn\u2019t recognize the shape of the hand anymore. The momentum continued traveling upwards, and the veins in his right arm, that was holding the rapier, bulged and his skin ruptured.The huge noise had disturbed everyone on the battle ground. All the fighter of Chambord and the enemies had stopped fighting for a second and glanced to look at what had happened.\u201cHoly crap! God! To chip a rapier from the tip, what kind of power was that? \u201c Everyone thought.But what was more surprising was yet to come \u2013The huge axe had turned into a shadow in that man\u2019s hand; it was moving so fast that no one\u2019s eyes could follow the movements of the axe. As the one who was in extreme danger, this ex-rapier wielding warrior has fallen into a position where he had never been at before. He was the only one on the battlefield that saw the axe coming for his waist. That man was trying to chop him in half with that horizontal strike!\u201cShit!\u201dThis enemy was devastated. He no longer had a weapon and had fallen into an enormous disadvantage all a sudden.He tapped his feet onto the ground and jumped up trying to dodge that vicious attack. He shot up five feet high, almost like he was flying up.But the axe seemed to bend the rules of physics. It didn\u2019t follow through the horizontal trajectory that this enemy had thought. Instead, it followed this enemy straight up into the air.This enemy was in mid-air so there was nothing he could do to dodge or block this attack.\u201cCi \u2014\u2014-!\u201dIt sounded like the tearing of a piece of paper.The axe had went through this enemy from the bottom of his crouch to the top of his head. Because it happened so fast, as if this enemy didn\u2019t had time to react to what had happened, he was still one piece when he landed on the ground.After a brief moment,This enemy tried to reach out his hand. His facial expression was just dead.This small movement was like the call to the grim reaper,Suddenly \u2013A tiny bloody seam appeared on his body.He looked down on his body, not believing what was happening.There wasn\u2019t time for his last wail. Blood started spurting out. The body was separated symmetrically from bottom up. The white intestines, chopped internal organs and the slimy brain fell all over the place.This prestigious one star warrior, who was decimating the defenders of the castles less than 5 minutes ago, couldn\u2019t be more dead than that.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: The Enemies\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014One strike!Only one strike and a one star warrior was decimated! Both the Chambord soldiers and the enemy were shocked. They all looked at that man as if he was a dragon in the human form.The sounds of weapons clashing and war cries resounding across the battlefield a few minutes ago had abruptly stopped. The battlefield was completely quiet. The Chambordian soldiers and the enemies looked at each other, quickly realized that they were still in battle and went right back to killing each other.\u201cHahaha! It actually worked! I\u2019m so clever! Hahaha.\u201d That man laughed ludicrously.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In an area near the Chambord Castle, half a mile away from the moat named \u201cZuli\u201d, a hundred black military tents were set up in a pattern that had completely blocked the only exit out of the castle.This was the base of the enemy army.The people of Chambord didn\u2019t know where these black armoured enemies came from. Three days ago, after the morning fog dispersed, a sentry was lucky enough to discover the fast approaching enemies. He quickly barred the castle\u2019s gate and had bought some time for the defense of Chambord.There were about two thousand soldiers in the invading army.After failing the sneak attack, they had camped beside the Zuli moat. The invaders had sieged the walls everyday, as well as spreading a ton of scouts to cut communications between Chambord and the rest of the world.Today was the fourth day.\u201cThis little castle has a complex terrain that could frustrate any invaders. If it wasn\u2019t for this dangerous moat and that firm defence wall, I would\u2019ve already conquered this castle for father, and that Angela woman would\u2019ve been my toy already\u2026\u201dOn the bank of the Zuli moat, a knight wearing a full suit of black armor with a silver mask grumbled.The silver mask had a ferocious demon carving on it and only covered the top half of his face. He was on top of a pitch black war horse, which was itself tall and sturdy, emanating the image of a majestic beast. The horse also wore a ferocious suit of armour, with only its legs and eyes exposed. An enigmatic force surrounded him, like a magnetic field.Behind him, nineteen other knights stood in silence.They were all black armoured and on black horses too. They also wore the same devil styled mask as well, but in black rather than silver. With the spiked armour on the horses, they looked like a platoon of devil knights from hell.\u201cThis was actually unexpected! This kingdom is only a mere level six affiliate of a tiny level one empire, yet it has a moat with a fast current and a firm defence wall. It even has a three star warrior!\u201d A black knight behind the silver masked knight said. He then dryly chuckled and reassured the silver masked knight, \u201cDon\u2019t worry master! The defenders are at their breaking point and surely can only hold twenty more minutes. After that, this castle will fall for sure!\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u2026 After we conquer this castle, let the soldiers loose; they can do anything they want. Except that Angela, there is no need for any others to survive.\u201d This cruel command was given so indifferently by this silver masked knight, as if he was just mentioning the weather. \u201cRemember! Setting fire is prohibited! We need this castle.\u201d\u201cYes! Master!\u201d All nineteen black knights said in unison. They had already done this hundreds of times and it was no surprise to them.The black knight who just spoke said: \u201c Master, their king \u2026 \u201c\u201cJust execute him! For the next three days, make all the females in the castle service the soldiers and kill them afterwards.\u201d\u201cWe follow your commands!\u201d All the knights were excited, they loved these kinds of orders.\u201c[Twenty] is almost finished, you men should get ready \u2026\u201d The silver masked knight waved at his subordinates: \u201cWhen we gain control of and open the gate, all of you will rush in and finish off the enemies as soon as you can! I want to sit on the throne of their king in the shortest time possible\u2026\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dHe didn\u2019t even finish his sentence before a huge noise came from the battlefield.It was as loud as thunder.All the knights were star ranked warriors and, given their enhanced abilities, they saw clearly what had just happened on the defensive wall of Chambord.The black knights behind the silver masked knight almost all lost it: \u201cOh god! This is \u2026 was [Twenty] just chopped in half by an enemy?! Fuck! Did they have a war god?\u201dThese black knights stared at each other, the shock showing in their eyes.They were all star ranked warriors that were skilled at fighting so they could see that the \u201ciron man\u201d that chopped [Twenty] in half was only using brute force. There was no traces of energy in his attack. That was a scary thought for these knights because [Twenty] was already a one star warrior!\u201cMaster, allow me to chop the head off that bastard; to avenge [Twenty]!\u201dSome of the black knight was getting really nervous and impatient.Although the twenty of them didn\u2019t have names, and were only designated numbers, for the past four or five years, they had been under the command of the silver masked knight together. They ate together and slept together, they were closer than any blood related brothers. However, no one expected that [Twenty] would die in this horrible way, especially in this seemingly easy siege.This had stimulated their anger for revenge.\u201cIs he just born with inhuman strength?\u201dThe silver masked knight smiled mysteriously. He waved back at the black knights and said: \u201cInteresting, This man has intrigued me\u2026 pass on my order to stop the siege. Tell the soldiers to back off for now!\u201d\u201cMaster, this \u2026 \u201c\u201cAre there any problems?\u201d The silver masked man responded coldly.\u201cWe follow your commands, master!\u201d\u201cThe information from our intelligence agency \u201cEagle\u201d mentioned the king of this level six affiliated kingdom is a retard. Haha, change of commands! Just surround the castle for now, send someone to ask for the surrender of the castle. If they do, the king, ministers, Angela and that \u2018iron man\u201d can survive, others still will be executed!\u201dThe silver masked knight said, his smile betrayed the cunning thoughts he was entertaining.\u201cYes, my master!\u201dThe black knights turned around right away and had started executing the orders.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cCome, take this brave soldier to the medic ward. Quickly!\u201dOf course, this \u2018iron man\u201d was Fei.Fei\u2019s axe was like the scythe of the grim reaper. It harvested the lives of all the enemy soldiers on the defensive walls near the ladders. None of the enemies could handle one single strike from Fei. After wiping out all of the enemies around Pierce, he turned and yelled. A couple soldiers hurried forward and carried the fainted Pierce off of the castle walls.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: I\u2019m Invincible\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Fei saw the heroic scene where Pierce risked his own life to destroy the siege ladders so that the defenders would have a chance at driving the invaders off. He was deeply moved by Pierce\u2019s actions. Fortunately, at the last second, he was able to save Pierce\u2019s life by coming up with the \u201cunorthodox\u201d tactic of throwing a living person as a weapon.\u201cHu\u2013Hu\u2013Hu \u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dWielding the massive double handed axe with a great amount of force, Fei crushed enemy warriors wherever he went.\u201cGreat job! Sir Warrior. I\u2019m the second commander of the king\u2019s guards. Who are you? I\u2019ve never seen you before \u2026\u201c, The black haired Brook yelled in surprise as he saw that Pierce had been saved. He was not in a good situation as well, still struggling with the fight with the skilled enemy from earlier.The unexpected savior had broken the subtle balance on the battlefield. The hope of the Chambordian soldiers had finally came.\u201cCommander Brook? Haha, you will soon find out!\u201dFei didn\u2019t want the soldiers to find out who he was yet.He had gotten used to the killing, screaming, violence and blood in the Diablo world. There was no difference between the two for Fei. As he got on the battlefield, he went straight into it without any need for adaptation.Moreover, the scenes in front of Fei had excited him.Everyone had dreamt of becoming a superhero and going around saving the day; protecting the citizens of their countries when they were young. Now Fei was living his childhood dream. Although his axe was harvesting the lives of many people, he had no remorse.Killing the others was the means for saving his own. It was as simple as that on the battlefield.Fei backed off as he protected the soldiers to carry Pierce off of the defence wall, and then returned to the front line of battle.The ordinary enemies were no match to the brutal strength and the sophisticated axe skills of a level 5 barbarian. The enemies screamed and cried as Fei approached the last siege ladder. His axe whizzed through the air, bloody light glistening off of the blade of the axe.The last couple enemies who were protecting the ladder screamed as they were knocked off of the defence wall and smashed into the ground by a horizontal strike from Fei.That strike was so powerful that it didn\u2019t even stop there.\u201cSlam!\u201dAs Fei followed through the strike, his axe bashed into the battlement of the defence wall.Dusts and sparks flew everywhere.The one foot (30 cm) thick battlement broke off and smashed into the enemies outside of the castle and bellowed up dust.The siege ladder that was secured onto this battlement was dragged along side with it. The ladder flipped three hundred and sixty degrees in mid-air with enemies still clenching onto it and crashed into the Zuli moat hundreds of yards (meters) away.\u201cSuch strength!\u201dEveryone on the battlefield was shocked again by Fei.The morale of the soldiers of Chambord was boosted by the new \u201creinforcement\u201d. Their hope of winning increased dramatically. On the other hand, the enemies was scared to death by Fei. No one in their right mind wanted to face him.But Fei didn\u2019t stop there. His next move had maximized the power and effect of individual heroism on the battlefield.\u201cThe king\u2019s soldiers, rise up and battle! For our kingdom! For our fathers and mothers! For ours wives and children!\u201dAfter his successful attempt on destroying the siege ladder, he raised up his gigantic axe. With the soft glow of golden light from the sunset encompassing his armour, he roared like an invincible god.Suddenly, an invisible, yet vehement force spread from Fei\u2019s roar. Like a tsunami, it brutally blew into the crowds of enemies.As if they saw something horrifying, all the enemies within five yards (meters) of Fei threw their weapon on the ground and started screaming and sprinting away from Fei as fast as they could. Some of them were so scared that they jumped off of the two hundred feet (60 meters) wall.Barbarian\u2019s warcry \u2013 \u3010Howl\u3011This roar scared away most of the enemies that were standing close to Fei. The mysterious powers from the Diablo world had finally appeared in this world. Of course, only Fei knew what was going on.Everyone else was stunned.\u201cWhat kind of power was that?!\u201c\u201cGod\u2019s\u201dIt was completely quiet on the defence wall.Under the light of sunset, everyone felt something uncontainable was about to burst out of the soldiers of Chambord.Finally \u2014Someone subconsciously yelled after Fei: \u201cBattle! For our kingdom and families!\u201dThis little follow up was like a tiny spark into a pond of gasoline.All a sudden, the blood in the defending soldiers of Chambord had ignited, burning like an unstoppable flame.\u201cFight!!\u201d\u201cDefend! For our homeland!\u201d\u201cAttack!! Kill!! Battle!!!\u201dThe chanting roars sent forth a truly spectacular force. Like the most unimaginable magic, it quickly spread around the battlefield.Almost every soldier of Chambord started roaring.Morale was skyrocketing!A wounded soldier pulled out the barbed arrow from his shoulder. A farmer that got his left leg cut off crawled onto an enemy and bit his thigh. An elder that got his heart pierced by a sword stabbed his knife into the enemy\u2019s skull using his last strength and breath.Fei\u2019s roar had empowered every defender of Chambord, giving them unprecedented strength.The advantage quickly shifted onto the defenders.After losing the siege ladders, no more back up for the enemy soldiers can get onto the defensive walls of Chambord. There was also no way out for the enemy soldiers. These warriors almost shat their pants. They screamed as they turned around and started running away from the blades of the defenders. Jumping off of the high wall didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea now\u2026At least jumping off of the wall gave them a slight chance on living,If they had stayed on there, these suddenly \u201croided up\u201d defenders wouldn\u2019t give them any chances. They would end up in a worse condition than just dying. \u2013 One of the invaders was literally bitten to death by a couple severely wounded soldiers.That was warfare.This new arrival must be a hero!Star ranked, even moon ranked warriors and mages may be able to kill numerous enemies, but there were some people referred to by others as heroes. They could motivate everyone around them. Every action, words, and expressions in their eyes could bring hope and bravery to their followers.Fei accidentally became the hero in the minds of the defenders of Chambord.After the roar, Fei went back to the killing of enemies. Broken swords, broken spears and broken armour. Everywhere Fei moved to, enemies cried, were mutilated and died.With invincible momentum, Fei approached the center of battle.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: The Loss\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Brook was struggling in the fight with the black armoured enemy. This other warrior looked very similar to the one star rapier wielding enemy that Fei killed. They both used the same fighting technique and weapon. The rapier was very fast when compared with brook\u2019s double handed sword.\u201cI will finish him, you go ahead and direct the soldiers to wipe out the remaining enemies on the defence wall.\u201d Fei yelled at Brook.Fei stuck his axe in between the two, twisted his wrist and the axe collided with the tip of the rapier accurately. The intervention from Fei forced the enemy to back off a bit and re-evaluate his situation.\u201cBe careful warrior, this bastard is tricky to handle!\u201dAs the second commander of the king\u2019s guards, Brook was one of the top few people that had authority and influence at Chambord Castle. But because of the heroic actions of this \u201cIron man\u201d who had his face covered up by a helmet completely, he didn\u2019t hesitate to listen to his orders.\u201cThat\u2019s weird, I swear that I saw this armour somewhere before\u2026\u201d Brook thought.However, there wasn\u2019t any time to waste, so Brook turned away and started commanding the Chambordian soldiers.Fei on the other hand was ready to battle this enemy.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who killed [Twenty]?\u201dThis enemy looked very solemn. He was concentrating and the energy in his body was circulating faster and faster. He was ready to unleash it at will.He was nervous after previously seeing Fei\u2019s single strike that took out [Twenty as he was not any stronger than his comrade. He had to give it all he got to gain a slight chance of surviving under Fei\u2019s axe.\u201cI can\u2019t fight him with pure strength!\u201dThis enemy came up with a plan in his mind.His rapier suddenly shot out. The attacks were more aggressive and faster than when he was fighting Brook. Because he was thinner and smaller than Fei, as well as his weapon being lighter and sneakier, he was planning on using his faster movement and attack speed to tire Fei out and use a deadly strike when Fei shows a flaw in his defence.Fei had soon found out this enemy\u2019s strategy.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d His laughter was full of pity.This enemy was like a \u3010Fallen Shaman\u3011in the diablo world. It was a human like monster that held a blade in one hand and a torch in another. The \u3010Fallen Shaman\u3011was sly and cruel, both moving and attacking fast. When it was at a disadvantage, it would try everything to run from the fight.After Fei leveled up to level 5, his solution for monsters like these was simple \u2013 one strike and done. This strategy was no use against Fei. Any tricks and strategies were like potato chips in front of absolute power; they would be crushed easily.What was a barbarian? The god of close range combat.Doesn\u2019t matter if it was strength or skill level on various weapons, barbarians will always be ranked number one in the diablo world. If a barbarian would be defeated so easily by such a strategy, Fei would have died in the diablo world thousands of times already.\u201cClang!\u201dAgain, only one strike from Fei had damaged the internal organs of this enemy and he had to back off while puking blood.His rapier was shattered into pieces. Some pieces even plunged backed into his body because of the power of the collision.\u201cBack!\u201dThis enemy was terrified. He wasn\u2019t even close to defeating Fei. After that first contact, he knew right away that this man\u2019s axe techniques were even scarier than his strength. He had no chance in winning this fight.\u201c T\u2018chi -\u201dThis enemy threw out a weird looking hook. A string was attached to it so it could be used as a swing. After it landed on and was secured onto one of the battlements, he jumped down the defensive wall and tried to swing away from the battle and from Fei. Almost like a \u201cSpider man\u201d.However \u2013\u201cIf you already came, then stay!\u201dFei was not going give this enemy the chance to escape, he said as he kicked a double handed sword on the ground.\u201c Shiiing \u2013 \u201cThe sword traced the path of the enemy, fast as lightning.It pierced the enemy in the back mid-air and killed him instantly. The sword nailed his dead body to the ground under the defence wall.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Fei said to the dead body savagely.As he was about to return to smashing all the remaining enemies \u2013\u201cMoo !! Moo \u2014\u2014\u201dA few strange sounding horns came from the enemies\u2019 base far away and soon spread around the battlefield.Enemies receded from the defensive wall around Chambord and returned to their base quickly, like a tide on the beach.\u201cThe enemies retreated!!!\u201dThe defenders of Chambord cheered in surprise as they saw what had happened.In comparison to the defenders, after seeing the retreat of their own soldiers, the remaining enemies knew that the commander had given up on them already and their morale sunk. After defending for a short while, they all threw down their weapons and went on their knees and surrendered.The soldiers of Chambord had quickly taken back control of the defence wall.But two hundred yards(meters) away from the middle of the defence wall, the battle wasn\u2019t over.The first commander of the king\u2019s guards, a three star warrior Frank Lampard was fighting to the death with an enemy swordsman named Landes. Both of their energies were clashing with each other. One red and one blue, the energies that leaked out of their battle had destroyed everything around them, including both the defenders and the attackers of Chambord, as well as the defence walls around them.No one could even come closer than within ten yards (3 meters) of them.Fei had smashed a couple more enemies who were still resisting on the way to the battle. He squinted at Landes as he was calculating how he could help Lampard in this fight.The battles Fei engaged in had built his confidence, he was feeling invincible.However \u2013Fei soon found out that this battle was way out of his expectation.After he got closer to this fight, he felt a huge pressure. The red and blue energies that were leaking out of the battle had left many shocking marks on the defence wall. Fei\u2019s instinct told him that he was in an extremely dangerous place.The experience from the numerous battles with the monsters in the diablo world had trained Fei\u2019s brain. He immediately knew that he was no match to either Lampard or the enemy swordsman. They both were at least twice as strong as him.When Fei was thinking, someone in the battle had yelled \u2013\u201cHahaha! Master had commanded the retreat. I will let you guys live for one more night. After we conquer your castle, not a single one of you will survive!\u201dThe Landes\u2019s energies started covering his body, it looked like he was covered in a huge burning flame. He forced away Lampard with a powerful strike and turned around and chopped a few of the closest Chambord soldiers in half. Then he jumped off of the defence wall laughing out loud while the soldiers cried in pain.Fei couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201cFuck! How dare you kill my soldiers to show off?!\u201dHe used the same tactics and kicked out a weapon on the ground.\u201c T\u2018chi -\u201dAn iron spear flew towards Landes at a high speed, as if it was a huge arrow shot from a military crossbow.\u201cI will grant your wish!\u201dSwordsman Landes found out angrily that, other than the three star warrior Lampard, an ant like trash had dared to attack him.He roared with his body spinning in mid-air and stepped onto the shooting iron spear. He jumped back towards the defence wall using the momentum from the spear, like a fluttering eagle.\u201cDie!!! [Exploding Sun Strike]!\u201dA stream of red energy, appearing as intense as erupting lava radiating deadly heat, was shot towards Fei.\u201cBe careful!\u201dLampard warned Fei.He was planning to save this \u2018Iron man\u201d, but the excessive fighting had triggered the indiscernible internal injury he had from ten years ago and caused him to puke a ton of blood and immobilized him.Lampard was surprised by his condition, but there was nothing that he could do.\u2026\u201cLet\u2018s see how strong you really are!\u201dAlthough the enemy was twice as strong as Fei, but it had ignited his fighting spirit even more. The pride of a barbarian had affected Fei\u2019s personality subconsciously and he wasn\u2019t going to back off. His huge double handed axe turned into a cloud of black shadow in his hand and smashed into the [Exploding Sun Strike] with a massive amount of force.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe collision spilled red energy all around and damaged the defensive wall even more.Fei was forced back thirty, forty steps by the energy until he had finally got a hold of himself.\u201cPu\u2026\u2026\u201dBlood had rushed out of his mouth and dyed the heavy armour to the color of the blood. Fei felt dizzy and his body started wobbling.The soldiers and defenders were shocked.This collision of power had determined who as the stronger one.The invincible metal warrior of Chambord\u2026\u2026 had lost.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: It\u2019s him!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Although no one knew what kind of a face was under that helmet, this man definitely gained the trust and respect from the soldiers. After seeing Fei lost the fight, Brook and a few other brave soldiers sprinted towards Fei, ready to sacrifice their own lives to protect this man who single-handedly saved Chambord castle from the enemy\u2019s siege today.Swordsman Landes was a three star warrior as well, but he knew that he had an advantage. The opponent\u2019s terrifying dragon-like strength struck him during the collision. His right arm that held his sword felt numb, and he had a hard time breathing. Worst of all, the collision had send him mid-air so he had no place to step on to regain his momentum.But \u2013\u201cDie!!\u201dLandes didn\u2019t stop there. He flung his left wrist and a hook flew out. It was a similar hook that the previous enemy used. After it locked onto the battlement, he forcefully pulled the string and the momentum sent him back onto the defensive wall.Brook and the other soldier who were trying to help couldn\u2019t move an inch closer towards the explosive energy and pressure.Landes\u2019 energy empowered his weapon again. With red flames on the sword, he pierced towards Fei! He decided to teach this trash a deadly lesson that he shouldn\u2019t mess with a three star warrior.The soldiers and defenders were terrified. Everyone thought that Fei was going to die for sure.However \u2013\u201cHahaha! Bastard, that\u2019s all you got?\u201dFei slightly tilted his body, not trying to dodge at all. As if he was so scared that he forgot to move, the sword went through his shoulder easily. However, Fei immediately roared like a wounded lion.\u201cRoar \u2014- \u201cBarbarian\u2019s warcry \u2013 \u3010Howl\u3011The mysterious power appeared again right after the roar.Landes was stunned. He felt really scared; he never felt this way before. It caused the energy in his body to freeze for a second. Behind the opponent\u2019s helmet, Landes saw eyes filled with craziness.These eyes represented death.\u201cDie! Dumbass!\u201dFei concentrated his strength into this one punch and aimed at Landes\u2019 chest.Landes\u2019 mind wasn\u2019t clear because he was affected by \u3010Howl\u3011. Although he felt danger, he wasn\u2019t able to dodge this punch. The enormous force didn\u2019t give him any chance. He was punched back instantly and blood spurt out of his mouth. His body smashed onto the battlement and broke it. Both of them fell off of the defense wall\u2013his sword was still stuck on Fei\u2019s shoulder.Although Landes had the energy of a three star warrior, after getting hit by this power punch, the damage to his body was enormous. His was filled with shock and disbelief as he was falling down. He struggled to fling out his hook, eventually being secured onto the defense wall. He pulled on it, cancelling out the acceleration he was experiencing from falling down and landed safely.Although he was injured, falling through the defense wall wasn\u2019t enough to kill him. He looked to the top of the defense wall, hesitated for a bit, then decided to temporarily retreat.He felt a call from the grim reaper when he was punched. Although that man\u2019s power was far lower than his, the craziness and the will for battle made him lose the courage to fight that man again.\u2026\u2026On the defense wall.The way that the soldiers looked at Fei who still had the sword stuck on his shoulder completely changed.Respect, unimaginable, madness, worship\u2026They looked at him as if he was a god of war. Even the three star warrior Lampard, who had finally recovered a little bit from the indiscernible injury, stared at Fei with respect and seriousness.After the series of attacks between Fei and Landes, only Lampard could clearly see what kind of a warrior this \u2018iron man\u201d was!\u2026\u2026At this point, the question on everyone\u2019s mind was \u2013\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cWho could he be?\u201dEverybody asked themselves, \u201cUnder the helmet dyed with the blood of the enemy, what kind of a face does he have?\u201dFei raised his arm.Every tiny action of Fei was observed to the absolute smallest detail by the people of Chambord.He placed his left hand on the handle of Landes\u2019 sword that was still stuck on his right shoulder. He bit his teeth and pulled it out.\u201cPu \u2014 \u201cAn arrow of blood shot out the metal armour.Some people couldn\u2019t resist and yelled as if they were the one who was pierced.Fei didn\u2019t shake or make any noise, he made it look painless and simple which yet again stunned the numerous observers.Fei took a long breath after he pulled the sword out. The immediate pain made him dizzy for a while, but he held himself together really well, sp no one could see it. After the pain and dizziness passed, he took off his helmet slowly.This scene was even slower in the eyes of the soldiers and defenders. It was like a slow-motion action film for them.It only took a second but it seemed like a decade in the observers\u2019 eyes. Finally, the mystery was unveiled.They saw the face under that helmet \u2013 his black hair was dripping wet and was stuck onto his forehead, and his thick eyebrows and his shining smile had made his face even more handsome.\u201cHe is \u2026.\u201dThe soldiers on the defense wall had forgotten how to breathe and speak, as if they had just stared at Medusa.Three star warrior Lampard was a very serious person, but now his mouth was wide open, not knowing what to say. The second commander of the king\u2019s guards Brook and the other few directors kept wiping their eyes; they couldn\u2019t believe that they saw. They all thought they were too tired and were seeing thing.It was \u2026\u2026. King Alexander!Impossible!To tell the truth, before Fei took off his helmet, everyone was guessing who this warrior might be. But after considering everyone, even including the homeless and the beggars at Chambord, no one would expect to see the face of their king!The famous retard King Alexander!This was the man who was the absolute shame to Chambord for the past three years!It\u2019s him!But how could it be?It was deathly silent on the defense wall.The shock that Fei gave to the defenders from taking off his helmet was ten time stronger than the shock he gave them when he destroyed the two one star warriors and injured the three star warrior Landes!After three, four minutes of silence, someone finally accepted reality and yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s King Alex\u2026Alexander! It\u2019s King Alexander!\u201dThis yell had woken everyone up.Everyone finally believed what they had seen, and they were all red-faced and yelled in excitement \u2013\u201cGod! It really is King Alexander!\u201d\u201cIt really is King Alexander!\u201d\u201cKing Alexander saved us!\u201d\u201cHail King Alexander!\u201d\u201cLong live King Alexander!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was way too surprising!Just like pouring a cup of water into a pot of boiling oil, heat exploded everywhere. Every defender felt a burning sensation inside of them, like a fire wanting to burst open. All the excitement and glory of fighting beside the king came together and formed into one shout\u201cHail King Alexander!\u201dThe sounds of the shout travelled far away, and even got the attention of the enemies in their base, located on the other side of the Zuli moat.Fei was shouting along with the soldiers. He was sure that he had impressed all of them. To make his \u201creturn\u201d more epic, he waved his hand to quiet down the crowd.The soldiers quickly shut their mouths. They followed Fei\u2019s orders as if Fei was a god. Fei walked towards the center of the defensive wall. Staring at all the soldiers, he raised his trophy, the three star warrior Landes\u2019 sword, and cheered, \u201cHail Chambord!\u201dThe bloody sword, the invincible hero, the remains of the enemies, the golden light from the sunset, and the godlike king\u2026\u2026.All of these things stimulated the soldiers even more. They raised their weapon and cheered.\u201cHail Chambord! Hail King Alexander!\u201d\u201cHail \u2026\u201dWhile the soldiers were cheering, Fei suddenly turned around and pointed his sword at the enemies\u2019 base and yelled, \u201cMy warriors, cheer with me! Fuck your dumbass master in the ass!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d The soldiers all laughed uncontrollably.They quickly realized that the king was not only worth of their respect; they could also relate to him, making them admire him even more. The soldiers rushed to the outer edge of the defensive wall and yelled at the enemies\u2019 base, \u201cFuck your dumbass master in the ass!\u2026 Bastards\u2026 Hahaha!\u201dThe fear and sadness about the war had suddenly subsided.At this moment\u2026\u201cAlexander, how did you get here?\u201dA surprised, yet worrisome and concerned voice came from Fei\u2019s back. Fei turned around.He saw Angela in a long purple dress. She was holding up the edges of her dress while rushing up the stairs of the defensive wall.The blonde haired Emma was yelling and chasing behind her. She seemed a little mad.Fei threw away the sword that was still dripping blood and turned his head around to wipe off the blood on his lips. After he felt that his appearance wouldn\u2019t scare the beautiful angel, he turned back and walked towards her.His walk turned into a sprint as he saw that Angela was about to fall from the stairs and he caught her just in time. The smooth sensation from touching her made Fei want to hug his beautiful fianc\u00e9 really badly.\u201cThis place is too dangerous! You have to go back!\u201dAngela didn\u2019t see what had happened on the battlefield. There was sweat on her face and her cheeks were completely red from running up the stairs. Tears built up in her eyes as she said that to Fei.Twenty minutes ago, Angela returned to the palace bedroom with Emma after getting Emma\u2019s face treated. They were surprised to find out that Alexander had disappeared and that there was a fully armoured suit chopped into halves within the palace. They were really anxious and worried about Alexander and his whereabouts.Angela blamed herself over and over for leaving Alexander alone in the palace.They searched the entire palace, including the places Alexander loved to go to, but didn\u2019t find any clues. As they were getting desperate and about to cry, they heard a ton of soldiers yelling, \u201cHail King Alexander!\u201d on the defensive wall. Angela forgot about her own safety and didn\u2019t listen to Emma\u2019s strong opposition as she ran as fast as she could towards the battlefield.Fortunately, the battle had already ended for a while, and she spotted Alexander right away, fully clad in metal armour.\u201cAre you injured?\u201d Angela saw all the blood on Fei\u2019s armour.Fei laughed proudly and pointed at the corpses of the enemies, \u201cIt\u2019s all their blood\u2026 Eh, don\u2019t look, these guys look disgusting.\u201d He quickly blocked Angela\u2019s view. He didn\u2019t want his pure fianc\u00e9 to see all the blood and violence.This simple move by Fei had Angela\u2019s heart racing.At this moment\u2026\u201cAlexander, you are almost eighteen years old! Can you stop making trouble for Angela? Do you know how dangerous this place is? You almost made Angela cry\u2026\u201dEmma had finally caught up to Angela. Although she also didn\u2019t have any idea about what happened, she began accusing Fei as she took a couple deep breaths; the stairs really tired her out.Back when Alexander was still a retard, Angela and Emma had treated him like a little brother, so when Emma got frustrated, she forgot about his status as a king and yelled at him like a big sister.However, Fei didn\u2019t get mad at all. He knew that they were just really worried about him, so he decided to tease Emma a little bit.He played dumb, and as if he was wronged, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t make any trouble \u2026\u2026 I am here to kill the enemies \u2026\u2026 Look if you don\u2019t believe me, I am strong, and I even killed a lot of enemies\u2026\u2026\u201dEmma became even angrier.\u201cWho are you kidding? It was already embarrassing when you were knocked off of the defensive wall by an arrow the last time. Do you want to make more trouble this time? Kill the enemies? It would be great if you didn\u2019t mess up the defense for us! Let\u2019s go back! If you cause any more trouble, I\u2019ll let Angela slap your butt!\u201d\u201cSlap my butt?\u201dFei\u2019s expression turned strange. When the old Alexander caused trouble, did Angela always slap his butt? Fei\u2019s thoughts were getting really inappropriate.\u201cOk, let\u2019s go back Alexander! This place is too dangerous,\u201d said Angela. She held onto Fei\u2019s hand and began to walk in the direction of the king\u2019s palace. She thought to herself, \u201cWe have to leave this bloody place, I hope it won\u2019t traumatize poor Alexander.\u201d\u201cNo, Angela!\u201d Fei refused the caring intention of this beautiful girl.He fixed Angela\u2019s black hair which had gotten messy from all the sprinting and stair climbing. Lowering his body to Angela\u2019s ear, he said, \u201cAngela, do you remember? Earlier you told me that I have to be a brave king. Now, I will be here with my soldiers until we fight off the enemies.\u201dAlthough what Fei was saying was very honourable and moving, he was also trying his best to impress this girl. \u201cHeroes are what girls dream of!\u201d he thought to himself.\u201cThat\u2019s enough! Alexander, you\u2019re causing trouble yet again!\u201d Emma didn\u2019t take Fei\u2019s words seriously. Her bright red face was fuming with anger, while her sapphire-like eyes were filled with frustration.\u201cAngela, Emma, let Alexander stay!\u201dThe three star warrior Lampard walked towards them. He patted Emma on the back to cool her down as he stared at Fei with a perplexed look.Lampard felt he couldn\u2019t get a hang of this little king anymore. He still hadn\u2019t digested all the shock that Alexander, who he had seen growing up and being laughed at by everyone, gave him today.\u201cWhat? Mister Lampard, you \u2026\u2026\u201dBoth Angela and Emma didn\u2019t expect Lampard to say that; they were very surprised.Both of them knew that aside themselves in the Chambord castle, the only one who truly cared for Alexander was the three star warrior Lampard, who had protected Alexander from when he was just a little kid. They couldn\u2019t believe that Lampard was allowing Alexander who \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019 have any defensive abilities to stay on the dangerous defensive wall.\u201cAngela, Emma, take a look at the way the soldiers are looking at Alexander\u2026\u2026\u201dLampard pointed at the soldiers who were busy resting and setting up more defensive barriers. Looking at the elated Fei, he smiled and said: \u201cWhat Alexander said was true. If it wasn\u2019t for him who showed up just on time and saved the day, Chambord would already have been conquered\u2026\u2026 Angela, I have to agree. You were right when you said that Alexander would become the greatest king! Alright, I\u2019m a bit tired, I have to rest!\u201dHe quickly turned around and left.However, no one noticed the thin steak of blood that was flowing out of his mouth\u2026..If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The king who had previously been a laughing gag for everyone in Chambord now seemed like a super idol that every soldier would sacrifice their own life for. This level of respect and worship from the soldiers was usually only directed toward Lampard.\u201cHail King Alexander!\u201d\u201cLong live King Alexander!\u201dFei felt great in front of Angela. He gave the surrounding soldiers a look that only bros would understand. The soldiers laughed and were very cooperative; they all raised their arms and yelled, \u201cHail King Alexander!\u201dBack then, every soldier felt that Alexander was a pile of shit compared to his fianc\u00e9 Angela, who was a shining diamond. They felt sorry for Angela and believed that Alexander was not good enough for her. However, they now felt that \u2018the pile of shit\u2019 Alexander was the only one in Chambord worthy of this diamond.To Angela and Emma, they never encountered such an atmosphere when Alexander was present.\u201cWhat happened??\u201d The two smart girls wouldn\u2019t wrap their heads around it.At this moment \u2013\u201cMy majesty, Pierce almost didn\u2019t make it\u2026\u2026\u201dBrook, the second commander of the king\u2019s guards, rushed towards Fei.Although he knew that King Alexander was not a doctor nor even a priest from the church, he still had a tiny amount of hope in Fei because his amazing performance today. He hoped that Fei was still hiding some secrets under his sleeves, \u201cGod please! Give us one more miracle! Just one more miracle from King Alexander!\u201d\u201cPierce?\u201dThe white haired man who had risked his life to destroy the two siege ladders appeared in Fei\u2019s mind. That man was a real warrior, no doubt about it\u2013not just because of his strength, but also because of his mindset and willingness to sacrifice his life for something that he cherished.\u201cBrook, take care of Angela and Emma for me, I will go and take a look!\u201dFei tapped on Angela\u2019s hand and passionately told her to be careful. Then, he looked at Emma and raised his eyebrows to show off his new influence on the soldiers, including the commanders to her. Finally, a soldier led him towards the healing facility.\u201cFeh!\u201dEmma couldn\u2019t take Fei\u2019s teasing. She stared the Fei\u2019s back \u2018bitterly\u2019 as he was rushing away. Then she turned around and said cutely, \u201cUncle Brook! What happened? Alexander seems like \u2026\u2026\u201dThat was the same question that Angela, who was blushing because of Fei\u2019s flirty behaviour, wanted to know the answer to.Brook smiled as he told them what had happened in the critical moment of the battle when Fei arrived.As the second commander of the king\u2019s guards, Brook treated these two girls like his own daughters \u2013 in fact, almost every citizen at Chambord liked these two kind and mature girls. They all felt injustice towards Angela, the poor girl that was forced to marry this retarded king. But now, everyone who had witnessed or participated in the battle believed that only Alexander was the right fit for Angela.After listening to the entire story, Angela and Emma were shocked.\u201cIs our retarded Alexander really the hero of the story?\u201d Emma had her doubts.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026At Chambord Healing Facility.When Fei walked in, he was shocked.\u201cThis place isn\u2019t the healing facility, is it? It looks like a pigpen.\u201d Fei thought to himself.A cold, moist, and moldy smell filled this seemingly abandoned place. There wasn\u2019t even a door to block the wind and the rain. The windows were blocked by rocks; dust and mud were everywhere. There was only some hay on the ground, while hundreds of heavily wounded soldiers were crying and groaning.Four or five doctor personnel who were dressed in black and white robes walked between these soldiers. There was definitely a shortage of hands as these doctors were sprinting around, covered in sweat.\u201cYour Majesty has arrived!\u201d yelled the soldier who led Fei.That had caught the attention of everyone in the facility, except those who were still in a coma or had fainted.The bravery and the power of king Alexander spread throughout the facility by the wounded soldiers who were sent here after Fei had arrived on the battlefield. Many soldiers were imagining the exciting and manly battle scenes. Of course, some soldiers who didn\u2019t see Fei on the battlefield were a little skeptical. They wanted to see the king who turned from a retard into a hero in person.After seeing King Alexander arrive, the soldiers here were really pumped.Some soldier ignored the wounds on their bodies. They struggled to sit up to see the king, breaking the scabs that had just formed on their wounds. The ones who fought alongside Fei all cheered: \u201cHail King Alexander!\u201dFei thanked the soldier who had led him to the facility, then quickly tried to comfort the soldiers who were struggling to sit up\u2026\u2026He didn\u2019t know what to say.This was definitely not the right place display his royal status. After seeing many young, mature, and old faces, their startling wounds, the blood from their body soaking into the soil beneath them\u2026\u2026Something triggered Fei\u2019s heart.The glorious hero\u2019s legacies from Earth seemed to be re-lived by the people in front of him. Technically speaking, these soldier were wounded from protecting him; some of them would be disabled forever. As a person from Earth, Fei wouldn\u2019t convince himself to accept this fact; if possible, he wished that he had fought the battle from the beginning alongside these soldiers.Human seemed to always contradict themselves, and Fei was a prime example.He was a coward and was extremely scared of death, but at this moment, he desired to fight and battle. Maybe he was affected by the endless violence and bloodiness in the Diablo world, or it might have been his animal instincts being triggered by the enemy\u2019s pressure.\u201cMy warriors, you have protected Chambord and you deserve the glory we have won today!\u201dAlthough Fei considered himself a talker, he didn\u2019t really know what to say at this point. When he bowed to all the soldiers in the healing facility, that sentence suddenly came out.This world was similar to medieval European feudal societies under strict classes and hierarchies. A king bowing to a lower classed soldier was unheard of \u2013 not even a retarded king.Sometimes, human emotions were simple. Many soldiers were touched by Fei\u2019s bow. Some soldiers who were complaining and spiteful as a result of their new disabilities felt that it was worth it at that moment.\u2026\u2026After Fei comforted a majority of the wounded soldiers, he arrived in front of Pierce. He had entered a coma. The enemy left some of his energy inside of Pierce\u2019s body when his shoulder was pierced by the rapier. The energy damaged Pierce\u2019s body and shocked his internal organs. Blood was flowing out of the wounded area non-stop. A young doctor was scrambling on the side attempting to stop it, but it was not effective.Fei now had the chance to observe the doctor\u2019s treatment in close detail.He was really disappointed. The doctors at Chambord didn\u2019t have the magical healing spells Fei had imagined. They could only perform simple first aid, including cleaning wounded areas and applying healing medicine to it. The effectiveness of these treatments was very limited. The life and death of the wounded soldiers depended all on their own physical attributes and the severity of their wounds. If they were lucky, they could stay alive; if not? Then they couldn\u2019t do anything but to die.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: The Cure?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013For the severely injured soldiers who had no chance of survival, there was a way for them to be \u2018euthanized\u2019\u2013 by using a small, yet deadly hammer to nail a needle into the weak spot on the back of their head. They would be killed instantly without experiencing any pain.For injuries like Pierce\u2019s, the \u2018euthanasia\u2019 would be performed.However, after considering that Pierce was one of the strongest men in Chambord, the fact that he had destroyed two siege ladders during the battle, and the advice of the second commander Brook, he wasn\u2019t euthanized yet.\u201cHow is he doing?\u201d Fei asked the doctor, hoping to get some good news.\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, your majesty. We tried our best, but his internal organs were shocked and almost torn open. Even the high class priests from the Holy Church can\u2019t do anything about it!\u201d\u201cPriests?\u201dThis word caught Fei\u2019s attention, but now was not the right time to ask questions regarding that. Fei had to come up with a solution to this problem.Two other doctors came up and bowed to Fei; one was holding a wooden tray. A small hammer and a bizarre looking needle were placed on the tray\u2013they were the tools for euthanasia. Pierce was the last severely injured person in the facility. Although he fainted, everyone could see that his body was still experiencing a lot of pain. These injuries might not have been able to kill him right away, but the blood from his wounds and mouth were flowing like water pouring out of a bottle.An older looking doctor lifted Pierce off the ground. The other doctor placed the nail at the back of Pierce\u2019s head and raised the hammer with his other arm.\u2014\u201cWait!\u201dFei had to stop the actions of the doctors.He just couldn\u2019t let a real warrior die like this. Real warriors deserved to die on the battlefield. A death like this would bring shame upon a man like Pierce. Moreover, Fei didn\u2019t want to let Pierce die.\u201cBut \u2026 How can I save him?\u201d Fei had to think fast.At this moment, as if Pierce sensed the tension in the room, he woke up. He saw King Alexander standing in front him, as well as the doctors. Eventually, his eyes finally focused onto the hammer. A smile shined on his face: \u201cKekeke\u2026. Is it my turn now? Go ahead\u2026\u2026\u201dPierce didn\u2019t say anything to Fei. He fainted before Fei surprised everyone, so he didn\u2019t know that the retarded king was now officially the hero of Chambord.The doctor raised the hammer again.\u201cWait\u2026\u201dFei stopped it again. He looked down at Pierce fading in and out of consciousness, and then an idea flashed through his mind, \u201cPierce, I know how to save you, but you may have to endure a ton of pain.\u201d He said.\u201cYou? Ha.. Kin\u2026\u2026King Alexander, this\u2026\u2026.this joke is not fu\u2026\u2026 funny. If you do care for your soldiers, then plea\u2026..please spare some bread for my \u2026\u2026 my poor daughter Louise!\u201dAlthough Pierce wasn\u2019t fully conscious, he didn\u2019t trust the king in front of him one bit. \u201cTrusting the words of a retard? Do you think I\u2019m a retard too?\u201d Only when he spoke of his daughter did Fei see the worries in the man who wasn\u2019t even afraid of the enemy\u2019s sword.\u201cWhat? You scared of pain?\u201d Fei lowered his body and scoffed at Pierce.He did it on purpose; it worked like a charm! Pierce easily fell for it.The tempered man was enraged. Like a lion whose mate had been taken, Pierce struggled to sit up, causing all his wounds to bleed once more, \u201cHa\u2026\u2026haha\u2026\u2026ha. I \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m scared of pain? kekeke\u2026\u2026I \u2026\u2026\u201dFei was scared.This man really had a strong sense of pride. Fei didn\u2019t want to irritate Pierce too much or he would literally die from bleeding.\u201cEndure it if you are not afraid of the pain. Do it for your daughter.\u201d He said that to Pierce before he left the healing facility.Just as he walked out of the facility, Brook had arrived with Angela and Emma.Angela\u2019s and Emma\u2019s cheeks were really red. They stared at Fei when they saw him. They still couldn\u2019t believe what they had heard.\u201cYour majesty, Pierce \u2026\u201d Brook asked with hope.\u201cThere might be a way to save him.\u201d Fei wasn\u2019t too sure about his idea. \u201cI can only try my best. If I\u2019m lucky, Pierce won\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Fei\u2019s answer was beyond Brook\u2019s expectation.As a commander of the king\u2019s guards, Brook had seen a lot of death and injuries. He knew exactly how severe Pierce\u2019s injuries were \u2013 death was almost guaranteed. He only asked the king due to desperation, but he didn\u2019t expect that the king to really have a cure.\u201cOh Brook, one more thing. Why is the healing facility so poor? Don\u2019t we have a better place for our warriors to stay in?\u201dFei was very unsatisfied with this so-called \u2018healing facility\u2019.This question caught Brook off guarded. He wanted to say something, but he stopped himself.Emma took deep breaths behind Brook; she wasn\u2019t used to all the sprinting. After hearing Fei\u2019s question, she didn\u2019t hold back at all; she said sarcastically: \u201cIsn\u2019t this all your doing? If it wasn\u2019t for your majesty listening to that Gill\u2019s words and selling all the valuable items in the healing facilities to have some fun, expelling all the doctors and even taking off all the windows, the healing facility wouldn\u2019t be looking like this\u2026\u2026\u201dFei didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cI really was a retard and a dumbass back then\u2026\u2026\u201d He thought to himself.\u201cAre there any other larger places that are more suitable for keeping all the wounded soldiers?\u201d Fei asked Brook without saying anything back to Emma.\u201cThe church at Chambord, as well as the head minister Barzel\u2019s mansion are suitable, but\u2026\u2026but\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook hesitated as he continued speaking.\u201cBut what?\u201d Fei was curious.Brook didn\u2019t how to respond to the question.\u201cThe two places that Uncle Brook mentioned do have enough space for these soldiers, but Alexander, you can\u2019t move them there\u2026\u2026\u201d Angela, who was previously quiet explained patiently: \u201cThe priests left Chambord castle and the church was locked down. We don\u2019t have the authority use it, or we will be heavily punished by the Holy Church. There aren\u2019t any empires on this Azeroth Continent that dare go against the Holy Church\u2019s rules and orders. Head minister Barzel\u2019s mansion is not very convenient right now\u2026\u2026\u201dThe explanation was pretty vague. Fei still didn\u2019t fully understand everything.Although he had inherited Alexander\u2019s previous memories, his understanding of this world was still minimal. He saw that Angela was very serious and wanted to tease her a bit, \u201cIs the Holy Church that powerful? Even a king can\u2019t order them?\u201dBlonde-haired Emma began to object Fei again, \u201cWhen the priests in the castle were leaving, even the enemies that surrounded our castle didn\u2019t dare stop them; they had to let them out respectfully. What do you think about the Holy Church\u2019s power now? Even the most powerful level nine empires don\u2019t dare to go against the Holy Church so blatantly.\u201dFei laughed nervously and didn\u2019t stress on that question anymore.His knowledge regarding the continent was just too little. If he continued asking stupid questions, the others might\u2019ve gotten suspicious of him. He quickly shifted the attention of the three people away from that subject, \u201cAlright then, are there any other places aside from the Church and Head minister Barzel\u2019s mansion?\u201dBrook shook his head.Angela and Emma did the same. They didn\u2019t have any good ideas either.After seeing this, Fei rubbed his chin. He was considering Barzel\u2019s mansion, \u201cBarzel\u2019s son Gill had tried to kill me. If he was like that, his father probably isn\u2019t someone bright as well.\u201d Forcing these kinds of people to share their property by using his authority as the king would not cause Fei to feel any guilt!At this moment \u2013\u201cI know another place!\u201d Emma yelled suddenly.\u201cWhich place?\u201d Fei, Angela and Brook were all surprised.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: The Insane Discovery\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013As Emma stared at Fei, a mischievous smile covered her face, \u201cThe front half of your majesty\u2019s palace! There\u2019s enough space for all the soldiers. Hahaha, it depends on whether or not you are willing to do so!\u201dFei\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cGreat idea! That\u2019s it! Brook, go ahead and organize the remaining soldier. Make sure that you\u2019re able to move all the wounded soldier to the front half of my palace. Also, notify all the doctors. It doesn\u2019t matter how severe the injuries are, tell them to try their best to maintain the lives of the wounded soldiers. I will handle the rest!\u201dBrook was shocked, \u201cYou majesty, you can\u2019t!\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Fei laughed, \u201cThey bled for me and the kingdom of Chambord, so why can\u2019t I provide them with a better place to stay and be treated?\u201dEmma was stunned.She proposed this solution not to solve the problem, but to childishly confront Fei. She didn\u2019t expect Fei to listen to her\u2026\u2026 \u201cHey Alexander! Are you sure about this?\u201d It was unheard of that a king would offer his palace as healing facility for the wounded soldiers.Fei purposely rubbed Emma\u2019s head and made a mess of the hair. \u201cOf course\u2026\u2026. Hahaha, thanks for your suggestion, kiddo!\u201d\u201cYou are the kiddo here!\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dAngela didn\u2019t say a word. She simply smiled as she watched Fei and Emma play with each other. Her mood was unprecedentedly happy. How long had it been since she was this happy? Angela didn\u2019t know the answer to that question herself. The way she was looking at Fei was getting brighter and brighter.\u2026\u2026The wounded soldiers were quickly moved to the front half of the king\u2019s palace.Food, water, wool blankets and clothes were distributed to all of them under Angela\u2019s and Emma\u2019s lead. Fei had also generously given out a portion of his treasure and wealth to motivate the soldiers. At this dire moment, morale had to be high. Aside from spiritual encouragement and motivation, there had to be some material benefits too. As a student who had taken psychology courses before, Fei knew what he had to do.Fei\u2019s action had definitely won over the soldiers\u2019 respect even more.The cheering of \u201cHail King Alexander!\u201d resounded throughout Chambord castle once more. Some wounded soldiers were touched and started crying and swore to devote their lives towards following King Alexander\u2019s commands. In this world where the lives of commoners were basically worthless, it was pretty easy to win over the support the people.After organizing the wounded soldiers, Fei handed control over to the \u2018Military Guru\u2019 Brook to plan duties such as the guarding and securing the defensive wall and putting up more barriers.He returned to the back of the palace and ordered that no one was to enter his room. He had to check on his injuries. Luckily, they weren\u2019t too severe.His first battle wasn\u2019t bad. He wasn\u2019t injured at all when fighting the two one star warriors. Only when he was trying to take on the three star warrior Landes did he get injured. He went head to head with the [Exploding Sun Strike] and only puked some blood.The most severe injury was when Fei\u2019s shoulder was pierced by Landes\u2019 sword. Landes\u2019 fire energy had entered Fei\u2019s body through the sword and shocked his internal organs, an injury similar to Pierce.Fei took a gamble when he intentionally let Landes pierce him.He brought the strength and abilities of the barbarian to this world, thinking that the defense and armour of the barbarian was also probably brought to this world. It would minimize the damage from Landes.In fact, he won the gamble.The energy of a three star warrior should\u2019ve been able to shatter Fei\u2019s organs into pieces, but due to barbarian\u2019s sick armour and defense, the organs were only shocked. There weren\u2019t any deadly effects.Of course, Fei had to do that. In that situation, Fei couldn\u2019t think of another way to temporarily defeat Landes except for tricking him. If Fei didn\u2019t force Landes off of the defensive wall, he would\u2019ve become just another soul under Landes\u2019 sword by now.It wasn\u2019t that Fei wasn\u2019t scared of death. It was just that he was too scared of death, so he had to risk everything he got.\u2026\u2026After checking his injuries, Fei began doing something very important \u2013He sat on the bed and tried to enter the Diablo world. If he wanted to save the lives of his soldiers, he had to enter the Diablo world once again.Fei\u2019s idea was simple \u2013If he could bring the abilities and attributes from the character in the Diablo world to real life, then he could probably bring the items and potions into the real world.If he could bring the \u3010Healing Potions\u3011 which could literally heal all the health of a dying character in the Diablo world into the real world, then Pierce and all other soldiers\u2019 lives could be saved.After thinking about that, Fei couldn\u2019t wait to enter the Diablo world.He meditated on the bed. He concentrated as he tried to remember how he enter the Diablo world for the first time. He tried to communicate with the strange voice inside his head.The result surprised Fei. There was a quick response \u2013\u201cGamer Fei seeking approval to enter Diablo world\u2026\u2026 Soul scan valid \u2026\u2026 Game Time verifying\u2026\u2026Excess time left over \u2026\u2026 Request Approved. Countdown \u2026\u20263\u2026\u20262\u2026\u20261. Enter!\u201d The cold yet mysterious voice spoke.Fei had the pleasure to travel through the \u2018star gate\u2019 again as he felt dizzy and a strange wave went through his body.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The scene in front of Fei surprised him.He remembered that he was still in the \u3010Den of Evil\u3011 on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011. He was expecting to be sent back to the same place, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the case.He was not at the \u3010Den of Evil\u3011, nor \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011It wasn\u2019t even in the Diablo world. He was in front of a 3D projected screen.On the screen, there were seven playable characters: Amazon, Assassin, Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Paladin and Sorceress. They were all standing in front of a bonfire. Every character was real. Fei could even hear them breathing. It felt like there were seven people standing in front of Fei.\u201cIs \u2026\u2026 is this the selection screen in the game? Why am I here? Could it\u2026\u201dAs Fei was thinking, he saw a button under the screen \u2013 \u3010Create a New Character\u3011Fei was stunned at first \u2013 he couldn\u2019t control his excitement.\u201cCreate a new character? Does that mean I could play other classes and bring their abilities into the real world?\u201dAn imaginary door opened in front of Fei. He could see his bright future. There were numerous opportunities. If he was a level 99 character in Hell (most difficult) game mode and was able to use those abilities in the real world, how powerful could he become?All he could think about were the possibilities.Hundreds of abilities from all seven classes would definitely create a big storm in the real world, and no one would be able to defeat him.\u201cThis is insane!!!\u201d Fei couldn\u2019t hold himself together.He had to try it out to be sure. He thought about it and decided to become a fancy mage this time.Instantly, a beautiful women representing the class Sorceress stepped forward. She waved her powerful wand and lightning came down from the sky; then she bowed to Fei.The bottom on the screen changed to \u2013 \u3010Confirm selection\u3011Fei pressed yes.The screen began disappearing and his vision blurred. It was the sign of entering the Diablo world.Suddenly, Fei thought of a serious question \u2013\u201cThe sorceress was a female character! When I become a sorceress, I won\u2019t become a female, right?! Would I?!?!?!?!?!?!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: The \u201c\u2019God\u2019 of TolerationThe Diablo system didn\u2019t give Fei much time to regret his choice. Right after a second, everything in front of Fei had changed.\u201cHuuuu-\u201dFei felt the zero gravity again from traveling through the \u2018time tunnel\u2019. His vision blurred for a second. The next thing he knew, he had appeared in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and was at the spot where new players would spawn.The sky was still dark and the rain continued pouring down.The\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011was completely quiet.Fei found out that when he changed his class to sorceress, everything went back to zero; it seemed as if he had restarted the game. He went to the high priestess Akara to receive the quest \u3010Den of Evil\u3011, and the intelligent women treated Fei like a stranger while giving him the quest.After he got the quest, he went back to the place where he spawned. He suddenly remembered something. He looked down his pants and hoped that he could touch something with his hand.After a brief moment \u2013\u201cHew\u2026\u2026ok\u2026ok. So I didn\u2019t become a female. It would\u2019ve been way too cruel.\u201dFei was very happy. Although the sorceress class was made to be a female in the Diablo world, his character appearance was based off Alexander in the real world. There were some minor changes, but he looked similar to the \u2018Barbarian Fei\u2019.He was wearing a coarse gray robe and holding a two yard (about 2 metres) long tree branch wand. These two items were given to Fei when he spawned; they were pretty cheap and powerless.Quickly, the NPC Warriv had rushed over again and started talking, \u201cGreetings, stranger. I\u2019m not surprised to see\u2026\u201d With his previous experience, Fei ignored him and walked away.At this point, Fei was certain that his hypothesis was correct.He could choose all the classes in the Diablo world, but he would only know whether or not he could bring their abilities into the real world after he exited the game world.\u2026\u2026After he proved his hypothesis, he decided to exit the sorceress character mode.It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want be a mage, but rather it was better to concentrate all his resources into one class for now. Chambord was under a real threat. He decided to focus his time on leveling up the barbarian Fei so he could be more useful for the next battle.As he was thinking about exiting the mode, he was automatically transferred to the 3D character selection screen without pressing any buttons.\u201cDamn! I can control everything now by just thinking about them?\u201d He thought about choosing the level 5 barbarian character and his vision blurred again, along with the feeling of zero gravity. He had entered the Diablo world again as a level 5 barbarian.\u201cThis is cool!\u201d Fei thought. He could simply think about what he wanted to do and there wouldn\u2019t be any need for button pressing.The place he appeared in was the \u3010Den of Evil\u3011.After he killed all the monsters in the den and completed the quest, he used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011 before he was kicked out of the Diablo world. The bright blue oval was still buzzing in front of him when he re-entered this world.There were still some items on the ground.Fei checked his \u3010Item Slot\u3011. All the valuable items were picked up by him and the items on the ground were pretty much worthless. He stepped into the blue portal and appeared at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.The dark and rainy weather had stopped, and sunlight shined onto \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.Although the sky was still a little dim and gloomy\u2013like how the polluted skies on Earth made people feel depressed\u2013the fresh, clean air lightened up Fei\u2019s mind.Fei went directly to the priestess Akara. The same dialogue as the original game occurred and Fei was awarded one \u3010New Skill Points\u3011. Fei put this point into \u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011 without thinking.There wasn\u2019t enough time for Fei to distribute the points evenly among all the abilities. \u3010Weapon Mastery\u3011 allowed him to defeat the star ranked warriors with godlike axe techniques, so leveling that ability up would significantly improve his combat effectiveness.After he did that, he began bothering Akara.\u201cHonorable Priestess Akara, I have a few question\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you want to ask, young traveller\u2026\u2026\u201d This spiritual leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 seemed like she had seen through Fei. She smiled, \u201cI\u2019m willing to answer your questions, but you have to know; at Rogue Encampment, everything has a price, so the key is \u2026\u2026 do you have anything that interests me?\u201d\u201cDamn, this woman is direct.\u201d Fei was surprised by the brutal honesty of Akara.He thought that the high priestess wouldn\u2019t be moved by anything. Who knew that as a spiritual leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, she would directly ask for bribes? Fei felt that his respect for this woman had sunk.\u201cEh\u2026..ok, can gold coins be used as a price?\u201d Fei asked.\u201cYes.\u201d the smile on Akara\u2019s face brightened up even more: \u201cEvery answer will cost you two thousand gold coins. Of course, some answers will cost more based on the question. You might not be able to afford them at this point.\u201dFei was excited that Akara agreed to answer his question. However, when he checked his \u3010Item Slot\u3011, he was really disappointed. He only had eleven hundred gold coins. He couldn\u2019t even afford one answer\u2026\u2026 He had to come up with something.Fei felt like swearing, \u201cDamn this Akara. Two thousand gold coins per answer? Why don\u2019t you go and rob a bank?!\u201d\u201cLooks like I have to sell my items\u2026\u2026Eh? Wait \u2026\u2026Items?\u201dFei saw the two blue magic items. \u201cIf gold coins can be used to buy an answer, then items could probably be used too, right?\u201dAlthough he was complaining about the price of the answers, he didn\u2019t show any of that on his face. He turned to Akara and asked respectfully, \u201cHonorable Priestess Akara, I don\u2019t have enough gold coins. Can these two items be used as a substitute?\u201dHe brought out the \u3010Grim Wand \u3011and the \u3010Javelin\u3011. Akara\u2019s eyes brightened up.\u201cMagic items?\u201d\u201cYeah, they can be used as substitutes. It has been a while since items of this quality have appeared in Rogue Encampment. Young traveller, this \u3010Blazing Grim Wand \u3011and this \u3010Athlete\u2019s Javelin\u3011 are worth eight thousand gold coins. I can answer four of your questions!\u201dAkara was a high priestess and had the ability to identify items without using \u3010Identify scrolls\u3011, so she could call out the names of the items by scanning them with her bare eyes.When she was identifying the items, she looked very serious and Fei felt a hint of sacredness in her. In addition to the purple nun robe she was wearing, she was totally different from the tricky merchant Fei had in mind.\u201cOnly eight thousand gold coins? That\u2019s way too low!\u201d Fei yelled in exaggeration.He actually didn\u2019t know the right price for these two magic items. Because of Fei\u2019s bad impression of Akara, he felt the price that Akara spoke of was lower than the standard. \u201cHonorable Priestess Akara, it\u2019s not right for a spiritual leader like you to speak of gold coins all the time. How about this, let\u2019s trade these two items for five answers. If I get more items like these in the future, I will take them to you as well.\u201dAkara was defeated by the shamelessness of the traveler. He spoke of the gold coins as if they were filthy on one hand, yet increased the value of his items by two thousand on the other.She thought about Fei\u2019s suggestion and accepted it.Many years had passed and the man in front of her was the only traveler that could step into \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, and he was the first to survive on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011. Although there were some skillful female rogues, they could barely protect the Encampment. There was no way that they could survive on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 and bring back all these valuable items.Also, Akara felt that as time passed by, the power of Diablo was corroding the energy of this world faster and faster. She had many important plans that this young traveler needed to complete.\u201cThanks for your generosity, Honorable Priestess Akara. My first question is, how did I come into this world?\u201d\u201cYoung Traveler\u2026\u2026\u201dAkara stared at Fei strangely and spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t know where you came from, but I could sense that you are not from this world. However, I\u2019m sure that you arrival was all god\u2019s decree. This world needs you!\u201d\u201cWhat? God\u2019s decree? This is your answer?\u201d Fei didn\u2019t know how to respond.\u201cYes, this is the answer.\u201d Akara nodded seriously.Fei almost fainted. He was outraged. \u201cGod\u2019s decree? This bullshit is worse than not having an answer!\u201d Fei was fascinated by science when he was on Earth and didn\u2019t believe in ghosts or gods. Akara\u2019s answer to him was completely BS.However, Fei couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He was dealing with the leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.He had to endure his rage. He quickly came up with the second question \u2013\u201cSo for the second question, if I\u2019m killed by the monsters on the moor, will I be revived?\u201dThis was the most important question to Fei. There were a list of quests in Diablo world. It would only get harder as he leveled up. He would have to face all the powerful demons from hell one day, and death would probably be unpreventable.So, before his death actually happened, he had to make sure that it was the same as the original game where characters revived after their deaths.Akara stared at Fei strangely again.\u201cYoung man, I have to admit that you know way more about this world than I expected. It was true that long time ago, the travelers and warriors revived after their death by the redemption of the gods.\u201d Akara slowed down as she spoke, \u201cBut time had passed on for too long. Diablo\u2019s power is corrupting this world every second. It has been almost sixty years since a traveler has stepped foot into Rogue Encampment\u2026\u2026So, the answer to this question is \u2013 I don\u2019t know!\u201dFei was shocked, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026you don\u2019t know? Does this count as an answer?\u201d\u201cYes, because I have told you all I know!\u201dThere was fire burning in Fei\u2019s eyes, smoke coming out his mouth and steam coming out his nose. \u201cWTF! This priestess isn\u2019t joking with me, is she?\u201dFei was furious, but there was nothing he could do. He had to tolerate.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Magic Items AgainFei tried to hold himself together and squeezed the third question out of his mouth, \u201cI want to know if I can bring items in this world into my world. You know that I mean, right? Honorable Priestess Akara.\u201dFei was ready. If Akara said anything like, \u201cIt\u2019s god\u2019s decree\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201c, Fei would literally punch Akara; \u201cConsequences? Fuck that!\u201d Fei thought. He didn\u2019t care what the consequences were for fighting with the leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.Fortunately, Akara\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t anything like that \u2013\u201cYoung traveler, you have memorize this rule \u2013 In this world, everything has a price\u2026\u2026 Hehehe, if you have and are willing to trade items that even the gods envy, you can get anything you want!\u201d\u201cSo you mean, if I can pay for it, I can take it to my world, right?\u201d\u201cYoung man, this is your fourth question?\u201d\u201cYou damn woman, you\u2019re so cheap!\u201d Fei cursed in his mind.Although he was pissed, he appeared respectful towards Akara. He shook his head, \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Fei was honestly scared by the greediness of Akara. He quickly asked his fourth question, \u201cWhy am I forced to leave this world after a few hours? What\u2019s that voice inside my head?\u201d\u201cThat is god\u2019s direction \u2026\u2026 my child, when your mental strength is strong enough, you will get to stay in this world forever. But now, it\u2019s obviously not the case. With your current mental strength, you can only stay in this world for four hours!\u201d\u201cMental Strength?! So that\u2019s the key!\u201d Fei now understood.After Fei got the answer, he turned around and quickly walked.He was afraid that he would do inexplicable things to Akara. Who said that NPCs were dumb and that their only purpose was to accelerate the plot of the game? Fei trusted this concept too hard and suffered a big loss while negotiating with Akara.\u201cYoung traveler, you still have one last chance to ask a question.\u201d Akara gloated.\u201cI will save my last question for now. I will come and ask you when I get a question that\u2019s worth 2,000 gold!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cLooks like I have to be more careful when dealing with NPCs in this world, or they\u2019re going to suck me dry like a vampire. Damn, they\u2019re scarier than the monsters on the moor\u2026\u201dAfter talking with Akara, Fei decided to level up his character.Chambord Castle was under serious danger, so he had to increase his power right away. Even if he couldn\u2019t defend the castle, he still could protect the people that were close to him.The fastest way to level up was not to slay monster non-stop to gain experience, but to complete various quests. The experience he could gain from it was way more efficient, so before Fei left \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, he went to Kashya, the military leader at the encampment.From her, Fei received his second quest \u2013 \u3010Sister\u2019s Burial Grounds\u3011. Fei had to kill the\u3010Blood Raven\u3011 who lived there.As the military leader at the encampment, Kashya had a lot of well-trained female rogues under her command. In the original game, when players completed the quest, they would gain the trust of this military leader and she would give them a rogue mercenary to fight alongside the players.\u201cHehehe, I wonder if these female rogues are as pretty as the ones in the original game.\u201d Fei\u2019s EQ plummeted when he thought of girls. He tried to peek into the tents behind Kashya where the female rogues lived. Light crisp giggles came from the tents and it skyrocketed Fei\u2019s curiosity.However, the damn curtains on the tents blocked Fei\u2019s view and he didn\u2019t see a thing. Fei had to leave it behind and left \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.\u2026\u2026\u3010Blood Raven\u3011 was a traitor of the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and a corrupted rogue. She lived in a Burial Ground on the \u3010Cold Plain\u3011. She was not only a strong boss, but there were also a ton of monster that guarded her.As Fei left the encampment and traveled through \u3010Blood Moor\u3011, he killed numerous monsters. After around two hours of traveling, he finally entered the \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 under the heavy rain.At that moment, Fei had leveled up his barbarian character to level 7. Like a lot of the RPG(Role Playing Games), you needed more experience and time to level up as your level got higher. It took Fei less than three hours to go from level 0 to level 5, but it took more than two hours for him to level up to level 7 from level 5.Just like its name, the \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 was way colder than the \u3010Blood Moor\u3011. It was like going from Brazil directly to the North Pole. The monsters were stronger, too. Except for the\u3010Fallen Shaman\u3011and \u3010Vampire\u3011, which were the common monsters, there was a new type of monster \u2013 \u3010Corrupt Rogue\u3011. They were basically rogues that had absorbed death energy from hell and turned evil. They used spears and swords to attacked Fei when they saw him appear at \u3010Cold Plain\u3011. They rushed towards Fei in groups. When one died, it screamed and called for more \u3010Corrupt Rogues\u3011 to show up.There was no way that Fei could\u2019ve avoided them, so he manned up and battled his way out of it.After an hour, Fei had finally arrived at the Burial Ground where \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 lived.There was one hour left until he would reach his four hour time limit per day in the Diablo world. There was enough time for Fei to complete the quest before he would get kicked out of this world.But before that, Fei checked his status and decided to do one thing \u2013 go back to the encampment to fix his weapons and armour, as well as purchase some potions.The battles at \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 had worn out Fei\u2019s items. The durability and effectiveness of his items decreased a lot. If he wanted to fight the boss of \u3010Cold Plain\u3011\u3010Blood Raven\u3011 like that, he was better off poking a tiger\u2019s ass with a stick; it would be an easier way to die.\u201dFei opened his \u3010Item slot\u3011 and used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011. Fei stepped in as the bright blue oval portal appeared. After the buzz, Fei was teleported back to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.From Fei\u2019s memories of the original game, there was a woman called Charsi, a NPC blacksmith who sold and repaired weapons and armour.Fei checked his mini-map and found Charsi a couple tents away. She was a young female who looked around eighteen years old. Although Charsi was pretty, she didn\u2019t have the appearance of a delicate yet fragile female, probably because she was a blacksmith. She looked valiant, but didn\u2019t seem happy. It seemed like there was something bothering her.She wasn\u2019t surprised about Fei\u2019s arrival.After Fei talked to her, his axe and armour were repaired at the cost of twenty gold coins. Fei also sold the items that he didn\u2019t need from the monsters to Charsi. He found out that for the same items, he got more gold coins for them from Charsi than from Akara.\u201cThat priestess is not a good egg!\u201d Fei\u2019s resentment towards Akara grew even greater. He swore that he was never going to sell his items to Akara again.Charsi didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to chat, so Fei thanked her politely and went back to \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 to fight the boss \u3010Blood Raven\u3011. There wasn\u2019t much time left.\u2026\u2026After fifty minutes.\u201cAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA \u2013 !!\u201dA mournful female scream disturbed the quiet plains.Fei was wounded all over his body. After the tense battle with \u3010Blood Raven\u3011, one of the strongest evil rogues, she had finally died under Fei\u2019s axe. Fei shamelessly dragged out the fight, he ran from the boss when his health was low and battled the boss after he used health potions. Although it was sneaky, there was no other way for Fei to win that fight; \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 was too powerful.After \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 died, numerous lightning bolts came out of her body. It quickly occupied the whole Burial Ground as if it was the end of world.However, Fei was not hurt by the lightning at all. It seemed like the lightning\u2019s purpose was not to cause damage.After a while, the lightning disappeared. A strange scene appeared \u2013 above the corpse of \u3010Blood Raven\u3011, an illusory female figure, like an angel, raised up the sky. She looked like a female rogue.\u201cIt must\u2019ve be the poor soul of this rogue before she had fallen.\u201d Fei thought. \u201cMy actions must have saved her.\u201dAfter a second of seriousness, he quickly checked out the corpse. Theoretically, after killing bosses like \u3010Blood Raven\u3011, magic items would be rewarded.Just as Fei expected, blue lights flickered under the corpse.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011\u201cHahaha! I\u2019m rich! Two magic items!\u201dFei picked up the two items. Although he was expecting it, he was still extremely excited. As he was about to take a detailed look of the two items, the cold, mysterious voice appeared again \u2013\u201cApproaching the time limit of the day, please prepare for exit!\u201dFinally!However, this time the voice didn\u2019t start the three second countdown right away; it gave Fei some time to get ready.\u201cI was waiting for you for a while!\u201d Fei thought.It was true that Fei was focused on killing the monsters, but he was also waiting for this voice to appear.Fei was afraid that he would lose this opportunity, so he yelled to the sky, \u201cWait! Wait. I have something to ask you \u2026\u2026 I want to exchange some \u3010Healing Potions\u3011 and take them to my world. You know what I mean, right? Tell me, what do I have to pay as a price?\u201dAt the same time, Fei was concentrating on trying to communicate with the mysterious voice inside his head.However, the voice didn\u2019t respond right away. Fei\u2019s question was followed by a moment of complete silence. For Fei who was in need of an answer, these four seconds of silence felt like a decade.Finally after the fifth second, the cold, mysterious voice spoke again \u2013\u201cAs you wish\u2026\u2026\u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011, the conversion price is 3,000 gold coins, with the conversion success rate of 25%.

Fei\u2019s vision blurred as the world started twisting in his eyes, turning completely black within seconds.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cHuuuuuu-!\u201dFei exhaled as he jumped off of his bed. He looked around and realized that he was back at the king\u2019s palace. His \u2018fianc\u00e9e\u2019 Angela was sitting on the side of the bed and stared at him with her blue, ocean-like eyes. Worry covered her pretty face.\u201cAlexander, you are finally awake!\u201dAfter Fei waking up, her worry disappeared. She was so happy that her voice was shaking, \u201cYou left shoulder was bleeding\u2026\u2026Oh, did you just have a nightmare? Your body was shaking vigorously when you were asleep and you were sweating a lot\u2026\u2026 I was worried that you\u2026\u2026\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much logic in Angela\u2019s sentences, but Fei felt the concern from the girl in front of him.Her concern wasn\u2019t because he was now the hero of Chambord. Neither was it similar to the respect and the care she showed towards Brook and the soldiers. It was a simple emotion from Angela\u2019s heart. She didn\u2019t care if Fei was the retard back then or a hero now. Angela, this angelic girl, would always care for him.That concern and care caused a special feeling to well up inside Fei\u2019s heart. Maybe this was directed only for the old Alexander, but Fei still had a great impression of Angela.Although Fei liked pretty girls, it was typical for a male. Fei was actually very old school and was never promiscuous. However, Angela\u2019s kindness had touched Fei.Fei was fond of her. What girl could be so caring and nice to a man who she knew was a retard and would be her future husband? Why was Angela Alexander\u2019s fianc\u00e9e? Fei didn\u2019t know, but that didn\u2019t affect his decision at this point. He was going to marry her no matter what and give her the happiness she deserved.\u201cRelax Angela, I had recovered a long time ago.\u201dFei smiled at Angela. He took off his armour and opened his shirt. The wound that Landes\u2019 sword had left was almost completely healed; there was only a tiny red speck there indicating that an injury had taken place.That was proof of Fei\u2019s hypothesis \u2013After going to the Diablo world, any type of injury on his body will magically recover.Angela blushed as she checked Fei\u2019s \u2018wounds\u2019 in detail; noticing no problems, she was finally relieved. When Alexander was a retard, Angela subconsciously treated him as a little kid and didn\u2019t have any other kinds of feelings for him. But now that \u2018Alexander\u2019 had suddenly become normal, she realized that she couldn\u2019t keep her cool in front of him. Every time she thought about the identity of the man in front him, her fianc\u00e9, her heart began pounding really quickly.Angela didn\u2019t know that her blushing face had stunned Fei \u2013 he couldn\u2019t look away. Neither of them said anything; it was completely quiet in the palace. The atmosphere was becoming more enchanting and mesmerizing.\u201cWhat a wonderful moment!\u201d Fei thought pleasantly.However, just as Fei was enjoying the mood, it was suddenly destroyed \u2013\u201cBang!\u201dThe door to Fei\u2019s room was pushed open. Emma rushed in.Emma didn\u2019t know that she had interrupted this special moment. Not noticing Fei\u2019s \u2018hateful\u2019 stares, she yelled, \u201cAlexander, how is your cure coming along? Uncle Pierce can\u2019t hold any longer\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShit!\u201d Fei finally remembered his most urgent task. He looked around, and finally found the item that he had paid a lot for lying on his bed: \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011.Thank god that the magic potion that could save one from dying in the Diablo world was successfully converted into the real world.Fei held the little bottle in his hand and carefully observed it. It was more like a glass jar about the size of an orange. The red liquid in it had a low viscosity, just like coke.\u201cThis is too little, it\u2019s probably not enough to cure Pierce and the two hundred wounded soldiers\u2026\u2026.\u201d Fei thought as he saw the quantity of the potion in the bottle.\u201cWhat should I do? Let me try the effect of this potion. If it\u2019s as magical in this world as it\u2019s in the Diablo world, maybe diluting the potion can save all their lives\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you waiting for, let\u2019s go\u2026\u2026.\u201d Emma didn\u2019t let Fei think too much. She tried to drag Fei to Pierce.Angela finally calmed down and was about to follow them, but Fei turned around and said to her, \u201cAngela, can you go and help me to prepare two pots of clean water? I will need it later.\u201d\u201cWhy do you need pots and clean water?\u201d Emma was like curious baby, \u201cI will help Angela with that. Alexander, you go and check out Uncle Pierce, he can\u2019t hold on any longer.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Fei arrived at the front half of the palace. Wounded soldiers filled the place and groaned non-stop. Luckily, most of them received great care and their spirits were better than when they were at the crowded healing facility.Except for the doctors, some women were called to the palace to take care of all the wounded soldiers. King Alexander\u2019s kindness had made it clear to all the people of Chambord that everyone had to be united and work together if they wanted to survive this dangerous ordeal.\u201cYour Majesty has arrived!\u201d After seeing Fei arrive, someone yelled, causing Fei to become the center of attention right away.What happened on the battlefield had quickly spread throughout Chambord castle. Many people had concluded that the retarded king was blessed by the god of war and became the saviour of Chambord. Therefore, Alexander naturally became the spokesman of the god of war and was respected and worshipped.Everyone was excited and wanted to greet Fei. Someone even kneeled down and kissed Fei\u2019s boots.This scared Fei, \u201cDamn! Hey hey hey \u2026\u2026 chill.\u201d Although Fei enjoyed showing off and being worshipped, this much enthusiasm and passion was too much for him.After finally escaping from the crowd, he heard someone crying beside him.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Oscar-Worthy ActingFei traced the source of the sound. At the corner on his right hand side, a thin, red-haired little girl was holding someone while crying.Fei took a closer look. The person who the little girl was holding was the severely wounded Pierce.The second commander of the king\u2019s guards, Brook was beside them looking worried. He kept talking to the little girl to comfort her.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dAfter seeing Fei, Brook was excited. He stood up and bowed, \u201cDid you find a cure?\u201dHe looked at Fei nervously; he was afraid that Fei would shake his head and say something disappointing. Pierce was at his limit, he could probably hold on another ten minutes, but that would be it.Fei saw the humble Brook getting extremely nervous and decided to tease him a little. He didn\u2019t respond to Brook\u2019s question. Instead, he pointed at the red-haired little girl: \u201cShe is \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLouise, she is Pierce\u2019s daughter Louise.\u201d Brook tried to hold his anxiety and introduced the little girl to Fei.Fei nodded without saying anything.\u201cSo this is the daughter that Pierce was worrying about when he was severely injured.\u201d Fei thought.Unlike Pierce, who was an insensitive tough guy, little Louise was very cute. With tears in her eyes, she could melt everyone\u2019s heart. Her red hair was very noticeable too. It reminded Fei of Hermione from Harry Potter.However, Fei felt that Louise wasn\u2019t that very approachable as a kid. She was cold and seemed way too mature for a 12 year old girl.\u201cAre you the one that Uncle Brook said can save my father?\u201dAlthough Louise was crying, when she felt someone walking towards her, she looked up. There were still tears in her eyes, and Fei could tell that she was heartbroken. However, she said in a voice unfit for her age, \u201cIf you can save my father, I\u2019m willing to be your lover forever.\u201dFei was shocked. He didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cDa fuck? Are all the kids in this world that precocious? I ain\u2019t no pedophile!\u201d Fei thought to himself.He didn\u2019t want to talk to this kid anymore. It was more challenging for Fei to face her than one of the bosses in the Diablo World.Fei sat down beside Pierce who relapsed into a heavy coma. He took out the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 and carefully poured one drop of the potion into Pierce\u2019s mouth.Whether it would work or not was going to be tested at this moment.Fei was nervous; Brook and Louise were even more nervous. All three of them stared at Pierce. Their hearts were pounding extremely quickly, hoping that it would work.Time passed slowly. The silence was like poison; no one dared to breathe.Eventually, Pierce who was struggling to breathe began inhaling and exhaling rapidly. His pale face was getting red and his wounds were recovering at a ridiculous speed visible to the human eyes.Brook and Louise were shocked. Their jaws dropped subconsciously. Although they didn\u2019t know what the red liquid was that King Alexander dropped into Pierce\u2019s mouth, it was super effective. The healing power of the liquid was beyond their wildest dreams.Unimaginable! Spectacular! Unheard of!It was better than any healing spell from the High Priests of the Holy Church.Brook and Louise looked at each other and then stared at Fei. They were almost sure that Fei was a living god.Fei was shocked by the terrifying healing power of the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 as well.He wasn\u2019t expecting that a single drop of the potion could be so effective. Obviously, if Pierce emptied the bottle, he could easily recovered 100% and fight another battle. However, the impact of that would be too shocking to everyone around, so Fei didn\u2019t do it.Fei observed Pierce\u2019s condition. He found that after one drop of the potion, the wounds had all recovered and Pierce\u2019s face wasn\u2019t that pale anymore, but he was still unconscious.\u201cThat\u2019s probably the max healing one drop can do!\u201d This gave Fei a rough measurement of the potion\u2019s healing power, so he dropped another drop into Pierce\u2019s mouth.The effect was instant this time. As soon as the drop landed in Pierce\u2019s mouth, Pierce woke up from the coma.He groaned as he opened his eyes. He was confused when he saw the three of them standing in front of him; he shook his head as he tried to remember what had happened. He remembered that he was about to die, but somehow, the unbearable pain throughout his body stopped and he could breathe again\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat happened? I\u2026\u2026\u201d After seeing Pierce speak, Brook was finally relieved.Louise happily shouted as she jumped into the arms of Pierce. At this moment, the 12 year old girl felt secure and happy like never before. \u201cFather, you\u2019re alive! \u2026\u2026Thank god \u2026\u2026the king saved you!\u2026\u2026.\u201dLouise couldn\u2019t even finish speaking. She was so happy that she started sobbing.It was a terrifying feeling for her to lose the only loved one she had left. It scarred her soul and she didn\u2019t want to experience that ever again.Pierce seemed to realize what had happened in his daughter\u2019s sobs. The brave warrior didn\u2019t say a word; he tightly hugged his daughter. After feeling the fear and excitement in his daughter\u2019s face, a drop of the hero\u2019s tear fell from his eyes\u2026\u2026Fei looked at this happy father and daughter family and smiled.\u2026\u2026Fei quietly left; he didn\u2019t want to interrupt the special moment the family was having. Two drops of the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 brought Pierce back from the Grim Reaper\u2019s hand. This gave Fei a better understanding of the effectiveness of the potion \u2013 similar to the effectiveness in the Diablo world.This made Fei more confident in what he was about to do next.\u201cAlexander, the water and the pots are ready.\u201d Emma yelled.Angela and Emma each carried a pot of water and rushed over from the back half of the palace. Fei took the pots, one in each hand, and ordered Brook to get a table.After placing the pots on the table, Fei kneeled before the table. Angela and the rest of the people didn\u2019t know what was going on, so they stared with curiosity.\u201cTime to show off my acting skills!\u201d Fei was laughing on the inside, but he appeared very serious.He placed his palms together in front of his chest and closed his eyes. A strange, mysterious language flew out of Fei\u2019s mouth that no one had heard of before. His expression was very serious, as if he was praying to a mysterious god.Although no one understood what the king was talking about, his serious expression influenced the people around him. Angela dragged Emma to kneel down first and then Brook and the rest of the people in the palace all kneeled down as well.Fei heard what was happening behind him. He took a peak behind him and had to force himself from laughing.The act must go on.He started his bullshit in English, \u201cDeez nuts! I\u2019m the handsome king and you are not! I used to call you on my cell phone. Why you always lying ~ Hehehe. None of you guys understand me. You don\u2019t understand~ Shit\u2026\u2026 I got to be serious!\u201dAfter repeating that for a couple time, Fei felt it was enough so he stood up.All the people behind him stood up as well, confused\u2026\u2026\u201cTink \u2013 !\u201dSuddenly, Fei pulled out Brook\u2019s sword from the scabbard and cut his palm.Blood spurted out.Fei reached his hand out and let the blood drip into both pots filled with clear water.\u201cAlexander, you\u2026\u2026\u201dAngela yelled when she saw Fei\u2019s action. She was worried.Fei turned around and smiled at Angela to signal her that everything was under his control.While everyone was staring at his bleeding hand and the two pots, Fei secretly blocked the vision of everyone behind him with his back and opened the bottle containing the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011. He dumped half of the bottle of potion into the two pots.\u201cOh god of war! My brave warriors, you will all be saved. After my prayer, the god was willing to save us all. He has infused his power into my body. Anyone who drinks this blood water filled with the god\u2019s power, and all injuries will be recovered\u2026\u2026\u201dFei bullshitted even more. He was not ashamed at all.To prove his points, he put his bleeding hand into the water. After two seconds, when he pulled his hand out, the wound was recovered, with only a light red scar visible.\u201cAh!!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cMy god!\u201dAfter witnessing the \u2018miracle\u2019, the crowd went crazy.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Bullshit Continued\u201cGod Bless!\u201d\u201cHail King Alexander!\u201d\u201cHail Chambord!\u201dTime seemed to rewind to the end of the battle under the sunset, with everyone in the palace cheering and yelling. Everyone understood the meaning of what they saw.This unimaginable scene had shocked everyone like never before. \u201cSo the king can really communicate with the gods like in the rumors. Then that means the God of War is always blessing Chambord \u2026\u2026 If it\u2019s like this, the cruel enemies will never be able to siege Chambord Castle!\u201d Everyone thought.All a sudden, the worries and fears on everyone\u2019s mind disappeared. As everyone cheered, Angela stood there quietly. This beautiful girl stared at the man in the middle of all people enjoying the resounding cheers and worship. She felt completely relieved. She didn\u2019t know where this feeling came from, either from the blessing of the God of War or from the change in Alexander.The atmosphere was spectacular, and even Emma who was hard on Fei was affected by it, jumping and cheering in the crowd as well.The two pots of blood water mixed with the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 were distributed to every wounded soldier\u2019s hands under Brook\u2019s order. Surprising laughs and cheers filled the palace. In just half an hour, many of the groaning soldiers couldn\u2019t feel the pain anymore, and the lightly wounded could literally pick up their weapons to go back to battle again.Light and hope were closest to the people of Chambord now since four days ago. All of this was because of King Alexander, who was blessed by the God of War. Everyone was looking at Fei with worship and respect.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The enemies didn\u2019t attempt to attack at night; this let most of the soldiers get their precious first night\u2019s rest in the past four days.After healing all the wounded soldier by tricking them into drinking the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011, Fei let a couple of smart soldiers handle the rest of the situation. He went on a walk with the second commander of the King\u2019s Guards Brook. They soon got on the defensive wall. The wall looked magnificent at night. Fei stood in the middle of the defensive wall and glanced around.Chambord was surrounded by mountains on the left, right and back. As if this small castle was endorsed by the gods, all three sides of Chambord were protected by natural \u2018defensive walls\u2019. The sides of the three mountains that faced outward were steep and almost unclimbable; even a star ranked warrior would have a difficult time doing so.What was special was that on the sides facing Chambord, the mountain was much flatter and rose more gradually. If climbing from Chambord castle towards the mountain, even little kids and elders were able to easily get to the top of the mountains. This strange terrain made Chambord very easy to defend and difficult to siege. It looked like the work of a god.With the mountains surrounding the castle, the only artificial structure was the defensive wall. The gate was facing the Zuli moat. The wall was almost half a mile long (600m), and it closed the only gap left open by the mountains. The bottom of the defensive wall was 15 yards (15m) thick and the top was 12 yards (12m) thick; it was firm and massive. You could literally run four cars on top of it.What was also special was that the defensive wall wasn\u2019t straight; it was designed to be slightly concave. This eliminated most of the blind spots and allowed every soldier to see what was happening on and under any part of the wall.A third of a mile (450m) from the defence wall was the Zuli River. It was acting naturally as the moat of the castle. The torrents roared as the water flowed. The mile (1,400 m) wide river was frequently covered with mist. The river was extremely deep, so it was impossible for soldiers to get across the river without a boat or ship unless they were super powerful warriors and had the ability to fly. Everyone who wanted to swim over would be \u2018eaten\u2019 instantly by the current.There was a half natural, half artificial stone bridge that linked the two sides.According to Brook, no one knew where that stone bridge came from. Even the oldest person in Chambord didn\u2019t know who built the bridge. It had a long history and was very cryptic.Fei observed it carefully. The stone bridge was held up by nine huge natural piers.Observing from far, these nine piers were like inverted mountains being plugged into the water; they were really astonishing. It was impossible to have made those piers artificially. They looked more like a god had cut off the peaks of mountains far away and threw them into the river.This stone bridge was another terrain advantage to Chambord.It was convenient for the people of Chambord to travel out of the castle during peaceful times, and the thin bridge made it very difficult for enemies to transport huge siege machines near the defensive wall during war times.\u201cThe terrains are extremely advantageous! No wonder Chambord was able to defend against two thousands well trained enemies for four days with less than eight hundred soldiers\u2026\u2026 This castle is literally a natural war fortress!\u201dAfter Fei\u2019s observations, he understood Chambord\u2019s terrains. Although he was no military genius, he was still surprised by that he saw. At the same time, he was also perplexed.The wealth and labour of the current Chambord kingdom could never pull off such huge construction, unless Chambord was once glorious and powerful or this castle had a long history behind it.Everything didn\u2019t seem that simple. However, Fei didn\u2019t recall any history about the castle. The memories and knowledge of the old Alexander didn\u2019t leave Fei with much useful information.\u201cBrook, people called me a retard before, right?\u201d As if Fei suddenly remembered something, he asked Brook peacefully.Brook\u2019s thoughts lagged. He didn\u2019t know how to reply to such a direct question from the king.The old Alexander was a retard that had the intelligence of a three years old; he couldn\u2019t even survive on his own. Under the instigation of his \u2018friends\u2019, he had harmed Chambord a great deal. Even though he was the king, no one liked him. Only due to his status as a king bestowed upon him by his parents, the previous king and queen, was he was not abandoned by his people.Even Brook himself didn\u2019t have any respect for the old Alexander. He showed a little disdain towards him. However, after witnessing Fei\u2019s battle on the defensive wall and his godlike actions that saved the wounded soldiers, who would dare treat the man who was blessed by the God of War like a retard?Brook had completely changed his view on the king. There was no question about it, the man in front of him deserved his loyalty and respect.\u201cWhen I was shot by an arrow yesterday morning, my head hit a rock. Maybe I was blessed by the God of War. Many things appeared in my head and my mind got clear\u2026\u2026\u201dAs if Fei was talking to himself, he spoke slowly while touching the moss on a battlement.\u201cYou know? That collision made me feel like I\u2019ve suddenly grown up. For many things that I didn\u2019t understand back then, I can understand them now completely\u2026\u2026 Hehehe, now I know that I truly was a retard that everyone hated\u2026\u2026 Brook, can you tell me all the horrible things I did before?\u201dWhile listening to Fei\u2019s \u2018monologue\u2019, almost all the doubt and uncertainty on Brook\u2019s mind disappeared, \u201cSo the arrow yesterday had coincidentally knocked the king back to normal\u2026\u2026When the old king was still alive, there was a prophecy that Alexander was retarded because he was cursed by god\u2026\u2026It looks like the curse had finally been reversed by the god.\u201dFei laughed in his head as he observed Brook\u2019s expression.Fei continued, \u201cWhen I was brought back to the palace, I felt a mysterious power flowing in my body. When I woke up, I had unimaginable strength. I was able to learn anything quickly and I was able to control my strength\u2026\u2026and I was able to use the battle techniques naturally as if they were born within me.\u201dAfter listening to this, the last bit of uncertainty disappeared from Brook\u2019s mind.The young king\u2019s monstrous strength and devastating axe techniques were things that Brook and all the soldiers couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around. But now, it all seemed as if it were the decree of the God of War.There was no other way to explain the battle that occurred this afternoon and the blood that saved all wounded soldiers\u2026\u2026Only divine intervention.Fei was observing Brook\u2019s expression closely. When he saw the sudden realization on Brook\u2019s face, he knew that his bullshit worked as he had planned.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: The Azeroth ContinentOn this Azeroth Continent, everyone believed in gods and extreme power. Because there were many wars, the God of War was the one that had the most believers and followers. Therefore, while tying all the loose ends to the God of War seemed ridiculous, it was the most reasonable and impeccable excuse.Fei needed an excuse to explain what had happened to Alexander. Now he had one. He knew that in a short while, what he had said tonight would be spread around Chambord by the forthright man behind him. He didn\u2019t need to explain himself to everyone again.Sometimes, hearsay is more trusted by others than what you say personally.Fei planned his explanation perfectly. He purposely linked himself with the God of War that most people believed in. What Fei\u2019s experience on Earth taught him was that beliefs and religions which caused disputes and wars, if used properly, could be tremendously helpful.\u201cI can\u2019t recall clearly anything that happened before yesterday\u2026\u2026Brook, tell me about Chambord and the kingdom.\u201d Fei spoke causally, appearing to not care very much; he was trying to trick Brook into telling him more about the castle.\u201cIt is my honour, your majesty. The scope of your kingdom is only Chambord Castle. According to the categorization method on Azeroth Continent, Chambord is not a separate empire, but an affiliated kingdom of an empire. The total population of the kingdom is less than 10,000, and the official military is the King\u2019s Guards, which only has 400 soldiers\u2026\u2026.\u201d Brook tried hard to explain what he knew clearly.\u201cAffiliated Kingdom?\u201d Fei had a bad feeling about itSure though \u2013\u201cYes, your majesty. Chambord\u2019s parent empire is Zenit Empire. It has 250 affiliated kingdoms and all the kingdoms are divided into 6 levels. Chambord is at the 6th level, which is the lowest among all affiliated kingdoms. There are 68 other 6th level kingdoms under Zenit Empire\u2019s dictatorship\u2026\u2026\u201dFei didn\u2019t know what to say; he felt like crying.\u201cSo this is the truth\u2026\u2026My kingdom is this small? I thought being a king was awesome\u2026\u2026My total territory is only this Chambord Castle, and the population is less than a small city on Earth\u2026\u2026 Am I inferior to a mayor?\u201dFor the first time, Fei felt like reality was not as sweet as he had expected. He thought about it for a while and asked hopefully, \u201cBrook, according to this, our parent empire, Zenit must be one of the most powerful empires on this continent, right?\u201dBrook\u2019s expression was weird.After hesitating for a moment, this straightforward man told Fei what he knew, \u201cAzeroth Continent is gigantic. According to legends, even the gods can\u2019t travel through the whole continent. There are numerous empires on the continent, and these empires are ranked by their strength, from level one to level nine. Level one empires are the weakest and level nine empires are at the peak of the pyramid. However, Zenit Empire is only one of the thousands of weak level one empires on the continent\u2026\u2026\u201dFei\u2019s heart sunk \u2013 he felt hopeless. He never imaged that Chambord\u2019s status was that low on Azeroth continent. A king\u2019s status was too cheap. Royalties in this world were more common than university degrees on Earth.According to Brook, with only a couple acres of land and a couple hundred people, anyone could become a king. These kings were just like large groups of \u2018bandits\u2019.\u201cWTF, so after all, I\u2019m just a leader of a big group of bandits? And a very weak one too?\u201dFei\u2019s hopes were crushed. As a king, he thought he owned everything in this world, but he was only dreaming.After a moment of silence, Fei asked again, \u201cSo\u2026\u2026 how are the relationships between the empires on the continent? \u2026\u2026I mean there aren\u2019t a lot of wars, right?\u201d\u201cWars are most common on Azeroth Continent\u2026\u2026\u201d As if Brook was addicted to \u2018objecting\u2019 Fei, he said sadly, \u201cEveryone is born during wartime and dies during the wars\u2026\u2026 Both of my parents and family were killing during wars. People die every second on this continent.\u201dFei was shocked.\u201cHoly shit! Then does that mean my kingdom could be crushed any second by the super powerful empires? When wars come, an individual\u2019s power is limited by the battles that involve millions of soldiers.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask for help from our parent empire? Zenit Empire has a duty of protecting their affiliated kingdoms, right?\u201dBrook\u2019s answer this time didn\u2019t disappoint Fei \u2013\u201cIf they knew our situation, Zenit Empire would send their armies and star ranked warriors to help us. The problem is \u2026\u2026\u201d Brook pointed at the enemies\u2019 camps on the other side of the Zuli moat and said helplessly, \u201cThey locked down the only path that Chambord can use to communicate with the outside world, so we couldn\u2019t get our message to the parent empire out there.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Fei quickly understood the structure and key to survival in this chaotic continent from Brook\u2019s words.There was no doubt that Azeroth Continent was huge. It was larger than any continent on Earth \u2013 even larger than all the continents on Earth combined. What was worse was that the empires on the continent fought against each other all the time; war was the main theme.Fei felt the pressure of survival crushing him. However, Fei had caught the main point of Brook\u2019s answer.There were laws during peaceful times, and there were also survival rules during times of war. From Brook\u2019s unclear answer, Fei felt like after hundreds of years of war, Azeroth Continent had formed an interesting pyramid system. In this system, survival of small kingdoms was possible as long as they attach themselves to the large empires.A gust of wind had brought mist from the Zuli moat onto the defensive wall. The atmosphere was a little depressing.Fei decided not to think too much about the future. His thoughts went back to Chambord Castle, \u201cBrook, tell me more about Chambord, such as other noble families and influential people. As a king, I don\u2019t even know my own kingdom.\u201dFei was going to get all the information he could out of Brook.Brook thought about it and said, \u201cOther than your Majesty, the most powerful person at Chambord would be the Head Minister Mr. Bazzer. Because you were\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook scratched his head. He didn\u2019t know how to describe the retarded actions of the old Alexander. He hesitated for a while and decided not to mention that. He continued, \u201cFor the last three years, Mr. Bazzer was running the kingdom on your behalf. Except for the military that was under Mr. Lampard\u2019s control, Mr. Bazzer decided everything else for Chambord\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHead Minister Bazzer?\u201d Remembering something, Fei asked, \u201cHe has a fat, pig-like son called Gill, right?\u201d\u201cYes, your Majesty. Gill was your closest friend!\u201d\u201cThat douchebag is my closest friend?\u201d Fei sneered in his mind, \u201cBazzer, Gill. They are all bad eggs. One controlled the Kingdom and the other accompanied me all the time to insist me to do bad stuff.\u201d\u201cContinue. Except for Bazzer, is there anyone else that is influential?\u201d Fei asked. He was definitely going to punish the father and son duo.\u201cExcept Head Minister Bazzer, Military Judge Conca and Warden Oleg are all powerful figures at Chambord. The former First Commander of King\u2019s Guards, Mr. Peter-Cech was one of them too, but half a month ago, Head Minister Bazzer had discovered a lot of evidence revealing Mr. Cech\u2019s intention of treason and jailed him.\u201d Fei nodded.He found something very interesting \u2013 Brook dared to call one of the most powerful people in Chambord, Bazzer directly by his name, but he was very respectful towards the former First Commander of King\u2019s Guards Peter-Cech, who was accused of treason\u2026\u2026Didn\u2019t that point out some problems?\u201dAlthough Chambord was a small kingdom, Fei felt there were a lot of conflicts and \u2018undercurrents\u2019.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: He is a beast\u201cAnyone else?\u201d\u201cExcept for the people I mentioned, your majesty\u2019s butler Bast, who is your future father-in-law and Angela\u2019s father, is pretty influential too\u2026\u2026But before the enemies attacked, Bast had left the Castle with a ton of riches and nobody knows where he went.\u201d\u201cAngela\u2019s father?\u201d Fei was surprised, \u201cAngela\u2019s father is still alive? No wonder why I\u2019ve never seen him, He left before the enemies came, and he even took a lot of riches\u2026\u2026Does that count of fleeing?\u201dHowever, Fei\u2019s initial reaction was not anger; he felt sad for Angela. The pretty and kind girl was abandoned by her father at the most important time.\u201cShe must be covering up her feelings every day.\u201d He was suddenly worried about Angela.\u2026\u2026The cold breeze blew through Chambord. On the other side of the river, the enemies\u2019 torches burned brightly in the night. Looking at them from far, they were like stars in the night sky. Fei continued talking to Brook on the defensive wall. He now had a pretty good idea about the internal power groups in Chambord.From Brook\u2019s description, even though Chambord was only a tiny kingdom on Azeroth Continent, the complex political artifices and infighting between the internal power groups were just as much those between the super powerful empires\u2026\u2026Fei felt that he was facing something really interesting.\u201cI feel like I didn\u2019t see Bazzer, Conca or Oleg in the battle today. Don\u2019t they all need to participate?\u201d Fei thought of something and asked.\u201cMr. Bazzer had actually came to the battle once; it was the time when your majesty fell off of the defensive wall\u2026\u2026Military Judge Conca was wounded on the first day of battle, and he has been recovering in his home ever since. Oleg is a warden; although I asked him to engage in battle, he felt his priority was to guard the jail, so he doesn\u2019t have any duty to be on the battlefield!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t have the duty, Huh? Hehe, ok\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei sneered, \u201cThen\u2026\u2026.How are their strengths? I mean their personal strengths\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBazzer is just an ordinary person. He doesn\u2019t have any magic, nor does he have any combat techniques. Both Conca and Oleg are one star warriors\u2026\u2026but the most powerful person in Chambord is Sir Lampard! With the rank of a three star warrior, he is one of the top Guardians (Guardians are powerful people that protect a kingdom or an empire) in the kingdoms around us!\u201dBrook\u2019s was definitely proud when he talked about Lampard.\u201cI remember that Bazzer\u2019s son Gill is a mage, right?\u201d Fei suddenly had a \u2018bad\u2019 idea. He laughed, \u201cPass on my order, call up mage Gill onto the defensive wall to protect the Chambord Kingdom.\u201d\u201cYour majesty, Gill is not a ranked star mage yet. He is only a low rank novice mage\u2026\u2026Of course, a novice mage would definitely be a lot help in battle\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook bowed as he answered, \u201cAs you wish, your majesty. I will send someone to call up Gill right away.\u201dObviously, Brook agreed with this command 100%.\u201cEh, that\u2019s enough for tonight.\u201d Fei pretty much got all the information he wanted. He smiled as he tapped Brook on the shoulder, \u201cAfter organizing the soldiers into shifts for night watch, go and get some rest. I will help with the night watch tonight.\u201d\u201cYour majesty, you can\u2019t! It\u2019s my duty to\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook was surprised.Fei smiled and waved to cut him off, \u201cCommander Brook, I heard from the soldiers that you haven\u2019t slept in two days. That\u2019s not good. There are more cruel battle awaiting us tomorrow\u2026\u2026 Ok, Brook. I need you to get some sleep. I will need you to kill more enemies in tomorrow\u2019s battle\u2026\u2026This is king\u2019s command, you must follow it! Now go!\u201dBrook was stunned. The next second, this tough man half-kneeled, propping his double-handed sword in front of his chest. He swore seriously, Your Majesty Alexander, my honourable king. One star warrior Goethe-Brook pledges allegiance!\u201d\u2026\u2026After Brook left, Fei made up an excuse and sent away the soldiers that were following him.He walked around and observed in detail the structures and defense mechanisms on the wall. He appeased the soldier on the night watch and walked into the watchtower at the middle of the defensive wall.This watchtower was a two-story building made of wood and stones. Before the war erupted, this watchtower was well decorated. It served as a resting place for the soldiers that exchanged shifts on the wall. However, the battles in the previous couple days had virtually destroyed this building. It only had four partially demolished walls. Without a ceiling, the starlight shined though.Fei picked a spot that could see the area under the defensive wall so he could react if the enemies did something. He sat down and started his night watch.A couple other soldier stood outside of the watchtower, guarding the king.\u201cThis is not a good situation. Although we defeated their siege today, this won\u2019t happen every day. This enemies have great equipment and are well trained. Moreover, we are outnumbered. If this continues, Chambord can\u2019t escape the fate of being conquered. There must be another way!\u201d Fei was thinking hard.But after a ton of thinking, not a single good idea came to mind. He was only a university student on Earth, after all. He was no assassin nor military commander. Thinking of an idea that could save the Chambord Castle was not an easy task.\u201cLooks like I have to improve my strength first. I\u2019ll have to deal with the rest later.\u201dFei gave up on thinking. He made up his mind as he closed his eyes and tried to communicate with the mysterious voice inside his head. He wanted to enter the Diablo world to \u2018level up\u2019 and increase his strength.However \u2013\u201cInsufficient mental strength restored. Cannot enter the Diablo world, please try again later.\u201dThat cold, mysterious voice gave Fei a response quickly.This disappointed Fei. He meditated for a while patiently and tried again, but the answer was the same. After trying over ten time, he still couldn\u2019t get into the Diablo world. It was the same response, \u201cInsufficient mental strength restored\u2026\u2026\u201dFei kept on trying, but fatigue caught up to him and he unwittingly fell asleep.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026On the south side of the Zuli river. In the base of the mysterious, unsourced enemies.Right in the middle of the camp was a black tent, visibly bigger and more magnificent than the tents around it. Under the flickering light of the torches surrounding it, the tent looked like a horrifying monster hidden in the dark, ready to attack at any moment.However, it was warm and bright inside the tent.The silver masked knight that appeared on the battlefield was sitting on a big chair. The chair covered by a huge black fur of an unknown animal. The silver masked knight was relaxed; one hand was keeping up his chin while the other was holding an almost transparent jade cup, swirling red wine inside of it.Nineteen black warriors stood in two rows on both of his sides. On the left side of the tent, a mysterious man covered under a black cloak sat beside the table. The wand beside him had exposed his identity \u2013 a mage.There was a strange force field surrounding this mysterious man; it made the man very blurry and no one could see his face. Although it was warm in the tent, everyone felt a chill in their bones when they looked at him.The three star warrior Landes who was severely wounded by Fei was kneeling down in front of the silver masked knight.\u201cCrackle, crackle \u2013 !\u201dIt was the sound of charcoal bursting under the fire. It was the only sound in the tent; it made the atmosphere very strange.Finally, the silver masked knight raised his head. He looked at Landes and asked calmly, \u201cLandes, tell me what happened on the defensive wall today. I\u2019m curious how you were this badly injured as a three star warrior.\u201dAs Landes kneeled on the red carpet in the middle of the tent, shame covered his face.What was surprising was that under the silver masked knight\u2019s question, the powerful three star warrior Landes seemed very scared, telling the silver masked man everything he experienced in detail.The man was listening indifferently. He was focused on the jade cup in his hand the whole time, as if there was something that was attracting his attention.After Landes finished, the silver masked man stop swirling the cup. He said softly, \u201cInteresting. Hehe\u2026\u2026 Landes, take a seat!\u201dLandes felt like he was acquitted of a death penalty. He let out a sigh of relief. He stood up and said, \u201cThank you, master. I have one more thing to report. When I was fighting the three star warrior of the Chambord Castle, I found something interesting.\u201d\u201cGo ahead!\u201d\u201cMaster, I found that the three star warrior seemed injured. His water energy wasn\u2019t able to move inside his body fluently. From my prediction, he probably had an internal injury from some time ago and didn\u2019t recover\u2026\u2026In the next, I\u2019m confident that I can chop his head off and donate his skull into master\u2019s collection!\u201dLandes was hyped. However, that didn\u2019t intrigue the silver masked knight at all.The knight wasn\u2019t interest in the most powerful person in Chambord. Seeming unintentional, he asked, \u201cLandes, what\u2019s your opinion on the heavy armoured \u2018bull\u2019 that appeared on the battlefield earlier today?\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Two Complete Opposite Commands\u201cHim?\u201dThe question took Landes by surprise. Those beast-like eyes appeared in his mind instantly. The eyes behind the helmet\u2026\u2026made him shiver a little.\u201cThat man has the strength of a one star warrior. What was strange was that he didn\u2019t have any energy, as if he was born with that strength\u2026..\u201d Landes said as he was trying to recall what had happened. \u201cAnd also, he felt like a growing vicious beast, born to battle and kill.\u201d\u201cA beast?\u201d The silver masked knight put down the cup and finally looked at Landes. He laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting metaphor\u2026\u2026Landes, what if I capture this \u2018beast\u2019 and send him to the Empire Colosseum. Wouldn\u2019t that be even more interesting?\u201d\u201cColosseum? That\u2019s a great idea, master\u2026\u2026\u201d Landes said flatteringly, \u201cIf that crazy bastard goes to the Empire Colosseum, he will be the greatest gladiator. There will be a ton of people willing to pay a high price for him!\u201dOn Azeroth Continent, empire colosseums were the places that nobles wanted to go to.There was cruel and bloody entertainment going on daily. Strong slaves who were trained to kill were forced to engage in deadly fights with all kinds of weird beasts and dangerous monsters all for the entertainment of the nobles.These kinds of bloody fights had become a custom in Azeroth Continent. They were initially the sacrificial ceremonies to the God of War, but it had devolved into something purely for the thrill of the nobles. As they crazed for it more and more, the colosseums became an enormous profit chain. Numerous empires were involved in it, and it could also increase the growth in the gambling industry. Many people became super rich from it while others lost everything they owned.What was worth mentioning was that being candidates for gladiators had a strict restriction; only slaves and the poor who didn\u2019t have a ranked title were able to become gladiators. People who were ranked warriors and mages couldn\u2019t appear in the colosseums. The Warrior Union and the Mage Union believed that it was an insult to the unions if a warrior or mage was put into the colosseums.Of course, it wasn\u2019t this way when it started. Many nobles from the super powerful empires didn\u2019t follow this rule. There was a time when a ton of warriors and mages were forced to fight in the colosseums. This behaviour had infuriated the most powerful people on the Azeroth Continent. Five hundred years ago, many powerful people came together under the call of the Sun ranked warrior Beckenbauer and the Sun raked mage Bailey. Together, they passed the [Declaration of Honour] and wiped out 241 empires and 10,000 colosseums. After that case, there wasn\u2019t a single colosseum or empire that dared to go against the Declaration.Under the Declaration, a great gladiator was hard to find. People like Fei who had the strength of a one star warrior but didn\u2019t have any energy were treasures in the eyes of people like the silver masked knight. If they operated everything properly, they could profit greatly. They could even network with nobles from higher empires.\u201c[One], after the night clears, take [Sixteen], [Seventeen] and [Eighteen] and command Chambord to surrender. Tell that retarded king of theirs that if they are willing to surrender, the king and the minister can be spared, and the citizens will not be killed and only be slaves \u2026\u2026If not, when we conquer their kingdom, we will kill everyone we see for three days and wash their castle with blood!\u201d The silver masked knight said coldly.As he finished speaking, a white, chilly energy appeared in his hand, freezing the jade cup and the wine into a nice ice sculpture.\u201cYes, master!\u201d The black knight named [One] standing to the right inside the tent stepped up and bowed.\u201cEh, make sure that you convey this message to that retarded king in front of all of his soldiers.\u201d The silver masked knight had a playful smile on his face. He exhorted as he threw the cup to the side.\u201cYes, master!\u201d[One] bowed with [Sixteen], [Seventeen] and [Eighteen], and then they left the tent.\u201c[Two], [Three], [Four], [Five], [Six]. All five of you prepare your soldiers. When Chambord opens their gate and surrenders, rush in with your soldiers and kill everyone except that Angela and the \u2018Beast\u2019.The silver masked knight continued issuing commands. His second command was completely different from the first. The five black knights stepped up and bowed to obey the order. However, they were surprised. [One] was going to grant Chambord a path to survival, but the silver masked knight had set such a cold order so quickly; he was trying to trick Chambord all along.\u201cTime is tight. According to our plan, Chambord Castle must be conquered as soon as possible. If this continues, I\u2019m afraid that Zenit Empire will know what\u2019s going on. We have to do this\u2026\u2026\u201d As if the silver masked knight felt doubt in his subordinates\u2019 minds, he explained himself. After that, he turned around and said to Landes, \u201cLandes, I hope you can do what you promised; bring me the head of that three star warrior!\u201d\u201cAs you wish, my master!\u201d Landes was very confident.\u201cThe rest of you can wait for my order\u2026\u2026Ok, now go prepare yourselves. When the sun rises, we will take action!\u201dAll the knights bowed and were ready to leave the tent\u2026\u2026 But at this moment-\u201cWait!\u201dThe quiet, mysterious mage suddenly interrupted them.The man covered his face under his cloak. He nodded towards the silver masked knight as a salute. His voice was hoarse, as if someone was dragging a dull blade on a rough stone. The high pitched voice sounded horrible, \u201cYour highness, I sense that there is a powerful mage in Chambord Castle. Your plan might be interfered with.\u201d\u201cA mage?\u201d The silver masked knight\u2019s face expression changed. A mage could greatly interfere a battle easily. He asked, \u201cTeacher, can you tell what rank this mage is?\u201d\u201cThis mage is hiding pretty deep; I feel he is trying to hide from something. I only sensed him moments ago\u2026\u2026Eh, he is around three stars!\u201d\u201cThree stars?\u201d The silver masked knight was a little relaxed. \u201cIf it\u2019s only a three star mage, the threat isn\u2019t that great, but I still hope teacher can help me tomorrow when it\u2019s appropriate and eliminate this problem!\u201d\u201cEh.\u201d The man in cloak nodded: \u201cI would, but even if it\u2019s only a three star mage, the damage could be pretty significant. Tell your army to stay away in case of accidental injuries.\u201dAfter hearing the mysterious mage accept his request, the silver masked knight was relieved. He smiled, \u201cAlright teacher. You can do anything you want, just don\u2019t damage the exterior and the defensive wall of Chambord.\u201dThe mysterious mage nodded again. He returned to silence as the cold chilling energy surrounded him once again.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The cold breeze was chilling to the bones. Fei shivered as he opened his eyes.\u201cOh shit! I was on the night watch\u2026\u2026Cough, Cough. I fell asleep? The enemies didn\u2019t attack, did they?\u201d He was a little scared.As he was thinking, he smelled a faint fragrance. He turned around and was surprised to find out that the beautiful Angela was sitting beside him. However, she was asleep and lying against a cold stone wall.As if the girl felt cold in her dream, she held her knees tightly while curling her back. The crystal dew had wet the tip of her hair. She smiled as if she was having a sweet dream. Under the starlight, her fine, white face gave Fei the impression of a flower fairy.Fei slightly moved his body. He then discovered that his body was covered by a thick velvet blanket. Angela was obviously worried and brought it to him at midnight.Feeling the warmth from the blanket, Fei\u2019s heart was warmed as well. For some reason, the beautiful, kind girl in front of him reminded him of his first love \u2013 innocent, pure and warm\u2026\u2026Everything was beautiful.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Whipped SoldiersFei stood up and put the blanket over Angela. This dumb girl had brought the blanket to Fei, but she. only wore a thin layer of clothes.Fei\u2019s heart was a little hurt at that moment. However, because Angela was sleeping soundly, Fei didn\u2019t want to wake her up. He stared at Angela\u2019s beautiful face and couldn\u2019t stop smiling.After covering Angela up, he left the \u2018building\u2019 quietly. The defensive wall was completely silent. There were only a couple soldiers patrolling. Looking across the Zuli River, the enemies\u2019 base was quiet as well. Fei was relieved, but when he turned around, he was surprised \u2013Emma was on the wall as well. She was standing against the outer wall of the watchtower as if she was guarding the destroyed doorway. She had fallen asleep while standing, probably due to fatigue. Her golden hair was disheveled and her clothes were fluttering from the morning breeze.She looked cute when she was asleep. It was a totally different impression compared to her normally hostile attitude towards Fei. She looked really innocent as her thin body was standing against the cold, blowing wind.Fei walked up to her and pinched her smooth cheek, \u201cHey, kiddo, wake up\u2026\u2026Why are you standing here? It\u2019s too cold, go sleep inside the tower.\u201dWho knew that Emma was still alert? As soon as she felt Fei\u2019s movement, she opened her eyes and punched Fei despite being drowsy. Fei wasn\u2019t expecting it and got punched right in the eye.\u201cBang-!\u201dA black \u2018panda eye\u2019 appeared on Fei\u2019s face.\u201cAh? Alexander, it\u2019s you\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter she hit Fei, Emma finally became aware of her surroundings. She was a little bit embarrassed. She held her head down, like a little girl who got caught stealing candy. But just as soon as she peeked at Fei\u2019s black eye, she couldn\u2019t stop giggling, \u201cHehe, I thought the enemies were sneaking up on us\u2026\u2026But you look alright\u2026\u2026You\u2019re fine, right?\u201dFei couldn\u2019t get mad at all after seeing Emma shivering in the cold wind. He tapped her on the head and took off the cape attached to his armour and covered Emma\u2019s small body in it. He smiled, \u201cAlright, now go sleep inside. After the sun rises, go back to the palace with Angela. The wind here is too strong; this is no place for you girls to be in!\u201dEmma was stunned. She stared at Fei sluggishly. She quickly looked down as tears welled up in her eyes. Surprisingly, she didn\u2019t argue with Fei and obediently walked inside the dilapidated tower.\u201cAlexander, you will be nice to Angela, right?\u201d When Emma was almost inside the \u2018building\u2019, she turned around and started at Fei and asked seriously.\u201cAh?\u201dThis surprised Fei. He didn\u2019t know what to say.Before Fei could answer, this little girl continued, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say. Now that you acting normal, you must to nice to Angela! Alexander, you don\u2019t know how much Angela has sacrificed for you for the last three years. I can guarantee that no one would be this nice to you in the world except for her\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter she said that, she rubbed her red eyes and swung her fist forcefully. She threatened, \u201cNow that you are normal, you have to protect Angela like how she protected you. You hear that? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll \u2026\u2026I\u2019ll give you another black eye!\u201dAfter Emma had finished \u2018threatening\u2019 Fei, she turned around and walked into the tower. Emma had been hostile toward Fei for the past two days. Fei wasn\u2019t dumb; he knew why she was angry \u2013 it was probably because the old Alexander had given Angela a hard time and caused her a lot of suffering.Although Emma was only a servant, Angela treated her like a little sister. Emma had witnessed all the grievances that Angela suffered for the past three years, so she didn\u2019t like Alexander at all. Her hostile attitude was very reasonable. Fei knew that all along, so he didn\u2019t argue with Emma. After all, she looked after and cared for the old Alexander together with Angela. This little girl appeared to be tough and mean, but she was kind and her heart was as soft as velvet.What Emma said deeply moved Fei; she was 100% correct. After taking over Alexander and knowing what had happened in the past, he had to protect the beautiful and kind girl. He had to protect Angela like how she protected Alexander.\u2026\u2026It was an hour away from dawn, the darkest moment at night. It was already late autumn. The chilly wind brought all the mist from the river onto the defensive wall. Fei\u2019s thoughts were swayed by the wind. Although it only had been two days since he came to this world, he had already adapted.\u201cIs it really god\u2019s decree for me to be in this world?\u201dFei stood under the light of the moon and stars. He suddenly remembered what Akara said in the Diablo World. He first thought that it was something Akara had bullshitted to trick him for his items, but after he calmed down, he felt like what that priestess said wasn\u2019t that simple. It seemed like she meant something else.While he was thinking, two strong figures approached him. It was Brook and white haired Pierce who just recovered.\u201cYour majesty, I have to apologize!\u201d Pierce said as he half kneeled. He said remorsefully, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what happened yesterday\u2026\u2026\u201dFei interrupted his sentence, then smiled as he lifted Pierce off the ground. No exaggeration intended, but Pierce was the one who shocked Fei the most in this world. Pierce\u2019s brave, risky attacks yesterday on the defensive wall told Fei that this man was trustworthy. Towards the trustworthy, Fei treated them with respect and generosity, just like Brook. In a dangerous situation like this, Fei had already started winning people over subconsciously.\u201cFully recovered?\u201d Fei pounded Pierce on the chest. The subtle action melted the ice between them.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fully recovered\u2026\u2026\u201d Pierce said excitedly as he posed to show his muscle. He laughed, \u201c Your majesty, Commander Brook told me everything! Chambord finally has a king. Pierce swears an oath of allegiance to Your Majesty! Until the day I die!\u201dFei could tell that Pierce was fully recovered, as his face had colour on it. It looked like the \u3010Minor Health Potion\u3011 had an even stronger effect in the real world; only two drops had saved the life of a severely injured man.\u201cCome and take a look, it seems like the enemies don\u2019t have anything planned right now. Were they like that the last couple of days?\u201d Fei walked to the edge of the defensive wall. He pointed at the enemies\u2019 base as he shifted the topic.Brook took a detailed look. His eyebrows wrinkled, \u201cThis is strange. Those bastards never let us rest peacefully during the last couple of nights. They pretended to siege tens of time every night and continued sieging before dawn every day\u2026\u2026 Something smells fishy. They must be planning something.\u201d\u201cFuck their tricks, if those sons of bitches dare to siege us again, I will smash them into meat patties with my hammer!\u201d Pierce stared at the enemies\u2019 base and yelled.Fei and Brook were both defeated by the IQ of this tough guy. He was so tough that his brains were probably made up of pure muscles and not any neurons or anything else.Fei knew that while Pierce was tough, he was also reckless. He was a great warrior on the battlefield, but was also a terrible strategist. If Fei wanted him to plan out strategies and seek logistics like a commander, he\u2019d have an easier time convincing teenagers to give up their phones.Brook on the other hand had surprised Fei with his cool attitude, he was a perfect fit for the role of commander and general.Fei didn\u2019t know that at that moment, he had decided on the direction of development for his first two henchmen. After hundreds of years, the stories of the [Ultimate Killing Machine] Pierce and the [Wooden Wisdom General] Brook who served under Emperor Alexander would be recited continuously by the travelling poets on Azeroth Continent.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what kind of tricks they\u2019re hiding under their sleeves. In the end, they will all be revealed\u2026\u2026\u201dFei decided stop pondering over the enemies\u2019 conspiracies. He tapped his fingers on a battlement rhythmically, \u201cPierce is right, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is. Anyone who wants to take a piece of Chambord will lose their teeth in the process.\u201dPierce laughed proudly as the king agreed with his \u2018suggestions\u2019.\u2026\u2026After more than half an hour, dawn was finally arriving; lights shone over the horizon. The enemies\u2019 base on the other side of the river wasn\u2019t quiet anymore.Loud bugles had broken the silence of dawn. Looking from afar, the black armoured enemies were like ants; they were moving inside the base and smoke from cooking had risen into the sky. After breakfast, a new round of battle would begin.\u201cTell the soldiers to prepare themselves. Brook, today\u2019s battle will be commanded by you; everyone must follow your orders, including me!\u201d Although Fei\u2019s personal strength had improved a lot from the Diablo World, he was still a complete dummy in terms of war and defensive strategies. It was the best option to let Brook handle that.\u201cMy honour, Your Majesty!\u201d Brook didn\u2019t reject.\u201cOh, right! Didn\u2019t I already call the novice mage Gill to come and help with the battle? Where is he?\u201d Fei remembered.Brook didn\u2019t know what happened either. He turned around to find the answer. Soon, Brook brought back two soldiers who had scars all over their faces. Brook said angrily, \u201cThe soldiers I sent were whipped by Minister Bazzer. He said Gill was sick and couldn\u2019t participate in the battle.\u201dFei looked at the two soldier who were whipped on the face. Rage was building inside of him.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: What the King Says Counts\u201cThat bastard! After knowing that I\u2019ve become normal, he still dares to disobey my order?! Looks like he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m the king. It\u2019s time for me to show him who\u2019s the boss\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei thought.\u201cSick? Humph.\u201d Fei snorted, \u201cPierce, take 20 soldiers. I don\u2019t want any excuses, bring Gill here. Even if you need to tie him up, bring his ass onto this defensive wall. If anyone dares resist, I give you permission to kill them on the spot!\u201d Fei\u2019s voice was cold. Everyone felt the anger of the king and the murderous look in his eyes.\u201cAs you wish, your majesty!\u201dPierce was excited. This decisive and eminent king was the type that he and his fellow soldiers wanted to support and pledge allegiance to. After accepting the command, he rushed down the defensive wall with the soldier.\u201cBrook, send someone to call up Military Judge Conca and Warden Oleg to help with the defense. If they dare resist, kill them on the spot!\u201dFei sent these two \u2018cold-blooded\u2019 commands. He was going to teach these guys a lesson.Healing the wounded soldiers last night was to show his kindness, while seizing a couple of nobles that escaped from battle was to show everyone what he was made of. This was the idea he thought of last night. If Fei couldn\u2019t do anything to the enemies, he could at least do something to the corrupted Chambordians.As Fei expected, after sending the two commands, the atmosphere on the defensive wall got very serious. Fei could feel the boost in morale of the soldiers.At this moment, Angela smiled as she walked out of the watchtower.Emma followed her drowsily. She yawned as she rubbed her eyes. After seeing Fei, she winked at him secretly and swung her fist. Fei could tell she meant, \u201cYou know what to do!\u201dFei smiled back.After the conversation they had one hour ago, Emma\u2019s hostile attitude had already disappeared.\u201cAngela, you woke up just on time. I have a very important matter that needs your help.\u201d Fei said as he fixed his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s messy hair.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201dAfter hearing Alexander request her help, this beautiful girl was energized. She was afraid that she couldn\u2019t help Alexander at all; now he needed her help, she was more than willing to do it. She overcame her shyness from Fei\u2019s touch as she raised her head and asked with a blush on her face.\u201cCan you and Emma go and ask Uncle Lampard to come? The battle is beginning and we really need him to take charge here.\u201d Fei said seriously.\u201cI\u2019ll go right now!\u201d After hearing the urgent request, Angela dragged the drowsy Emma and left right away.\u201cOne more thing, Angela. After you notify Uncle Lampard, don\u2019t come to the defensive wall. There are still wounded soldiers in the palace that need help, take care of them for me with Emma. Thanks!\u201d Fei said.This took Angela by surprise. However, Angela was a smart girl and knew what Fei meant instantly \u2013 the battle was about to begin, so the defensive wall would become very dangerous. If she stayed there, she would only be a burden. Alexander was sending her away on purpose; taking care of the wounded soldiers was only a bad excuse. However, she didn\u2019t object.Even though she wanted to stay on the wall and help Alexander, she knew that she wouldn\u2019t help him at all by staying on there. So, she nodded and agreed to Fei\u2019s suggestion. Emma clearly knew Fei\u2019s intention as well.She ran away with Angela as she gave a thumbs up to Fei.\u2026\u2026After twenty minutes.The enemies on the other side of the river had gathered together. Numerous square infantry formations stepped out of the enemies\u2019 base and approached the defensive wall of Chambord. Their weapons pointed at the sky had formed a \u2018forest\u2019, and they shined under the sunlight. These enemies were definitely properly trained soldiers. Looking from afar, the people on the defensive wall felt the pressure of war instantly.As Fei observed the enemies outside the wall, a ton of noise came from his back.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me with your lowly hands\u2026\u2026Fuck off! Damn it! I\u2019ll fucking kill all of you dumbasses later!\u201d A familiar yet arrogant voice sounded.Fei turned around to see a tied up Gill being brought onto the defensive wall by Pierce. This fatty didn\u2019t have any idea that his luck was over, yelling and screaming rampantly as he arrived.Fei\u2019s pupils contracted as he looked past the fatty and saw the man standing behind Gill.It was an old man wearing a red silk robe. He was thin, about 5 foot 8, and had a curved nose. His face appeared gloomy and his eyes subconsciously squinted. He was a little humpbacked, but he walked calmly and steadily. His white hair was combed together by a gem embedded golden hair ring.\u201cThis old man looks powerful, is he\u2026\u2026\u201d As Fei was thinking, Pierce came up and laughed, \u201cYour Majesty, we\u2019ve brought Gill here like you commanded. But we had to tie him up, haha.\u201d He then pointed at the old man in red, \u201cHowever, Head Minister Bazzer is here too.\u201dThis was the old man who had controlled Chambord on Alexander\u2019s behalf.Fei took a detailed look at the old man. For some reason, this average looking old man gave Fei the impression of a dangerous, vicious and poisonous snake.\u201cYour Majesty, I need an explanation!\u201d When Fei was observing this old man, the old man stepped by and asked Fei aggressively, \u201cYour Majesty, I want to know what law my son Gill broke that forced you to tie him up and bring him onto the defensive wall. Please give me a proper explanation!\u201dAs to coordinate with his father\u2019s aggressive question, Gill who was tied up yelled at Fei angrily, \u201cAlexander, you dumb idiot! Tell these low class dirt bags to let go of me\u2026\u2026\u201dFei sneered. \u201cYou want to act all arrogant in front of me?\u201d He thought.He didn\u2019t even look at Bazzer. He walked up to Gill quietly and started brutally slapping Gill without saying a word.\u201cPia, Pia, Pia, Pia -!\u201dAfter twenty or so loud slaps, Gill\u2019s face swelled up like an inflated balloon. Fei didn\u2019t go easy on him at all; the strength of a barbarian had completely knocked out Gill. Blood dripped from the side of his mouth.After he had done this, he slowly walked to Bazzer, with everyone still shocked by his action. He cleaned his hand and laughed condescendingly, \u201cI\u2019m the king! Does a king have to explain himself to you when he does something?\u201dDomineering!Purely domineering!I will do whatever I want, and I won\u2019t explain shit to you!That was the attitude!Bazzer who was gloomy was about to explode. He was not expecting this at all.He knew of Alexander\u2019s godlike performance in yesterday\u2019 battle and the mysterious linkage between Alexander and the God of War, so he actually prepared a little. His appearance on the defensive wall was well calculated. \u201cYour intelligence is back to normal? So what?\u201d Bazzer didn\u2019t think a kid who wasn\u2019t even eighteen was able to deal with him.If he couldn\u2019t beat Alexander physically, then he would just use his brain and strategies.He planned to \u2018reason\u2019 with the young king. Playing tricks and constructing conspiracies were his major. He was 100% confident in \u2018convincing\u2019 Alexander. By tricking Alexander, Chambord would still be his backyard.However \u2013Bazzer didn\u2019t expect that all his planning would go down the toilet and that the \u2018new\u2019 Alexander would be this domineering \u2013 not even in his wildest dreams!He suddenly regretted his decisions.From the rumours that were circling around Chambord, Alexander only became \u2018normal\u2019 after he was shot by the arrow on the defensive wall and hit his head on an object. What goes around comes around. He was the one who brought Alexander onto the defensive wall. He planned to kill the retarded king in the hands of the enemies, but he had made himself a new and more difficult obstacle. However, this feeling of regret only appeared in his head for a fraction of a second. He quickly adjusted himself.Although he was enraged by the swollen face of his son, he had to swallow it. His plan was already initiated and there was too much on the hook to be messed with. The most important reason was that the number one warrior of Chambord Lampard was walking up the stairs.\u201cYour Majesty, I apologize for my earlier rudeness!\u201dBazzer properly adjusted himself. He bowed to Fei sincerely, \u201cI was only too worried about my son, I was too anxious, please forgive me\u2026\u2026 But Gill is now\u2026Eh, is now fainted, I\u2019m afraid that he cannot participate in the upcoming battle. Can I take him back to get some rest?\u201d\u201cRest? Rest for what? Chambord is under a great threat. Every man, if not dead, must help with the defense. This light injury is nothing!\u201d Fei didn\u2019t give Bazzer any chance.He said something to a soldier, and the soldier carried a bucket of cold water and dumped it on Gill mercilessly. As if the fatty was stabbed by eighteen knives, he regained consciousness and started to struggle and scream again.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: What the fuck are you?\u201cSee? He\u2019s awake now!\u201d Fei sneered at Bazzer who was literally about to explode. He then said to Brook, \u201cLet him loose; have two soldiers protect him. I need Mage Gill to do what a mage is supposed to do on the battlefield!\u201dBazzer gave a murderous glare at Fei, then quickly restrained himself.At this moment, Fei felt a chill, as if there was a hideous monster hiding in the dark, ready to eat him alive\u2026\u2026He looked around but didn\u2019t find anything.\u201cWas it only my imagination?\u201d Fei thought to himself.Brook who was standing beside Fei didn\u2019t feel anything. He obeyed the king\u2019s command; he waved his hand and two soldiers carried the half-dead Gill inside the watchtower on the defensive wall. Although that was the place where the battle would be the most dangerous, a mage\u2019s effectiveness would be maximized there as well.The fatty Gill had learned his lesson; he was scared of Fei now. He didn\u2019t dare resist, and instead stared at his father Bazzer, hoping he could do something.The Head Minister was about to say something, but another arrogant voice sounded \u2013\u201cHey! How dare you two lay your filthy hands on Young Master Gill!\u201d Following the voice, a tough figure rushed through the crowd.The arrogant man kicked the two soldiers who were carrying Gill away aggressively, then quickly picked Gill up gently and sucked up to him as if he was their loyal dog.He turned around and started yelling at the lightly wounded soldiers around him, \u201cWhy are you guys standing there?! Are you guys blind? Go find a good stretcher and take Young Master Gill to rest\u2026\u2026Shit, these injuries are so severe\u2026\u2026 Who the fuck did it? Come out!\u201dAfter hearing his question, Fei decided to make fun of this man. He stepped up proclaimed, \u201cI did it.\u201dThe atmosphere on the defensive wall became silent all of a sudden. Deathly silence \u2013 no one spoke a word.This man sensed that something was wrong. In his arms, Gill was trembling uncontrollably. It wasn\u2019t because Gill was excited to see him, but because Gill was scared to death. This fatty trembled as he turned his head to look at Fei; he was scared of the deadly slaps. He had experienced it twice, and he never wanted to experience it a third time.Fei didn\u2019t even look at Gill; he was observing this arrogant man. He was 6 feet tall and had messy blonde hair, which gave him a vicious look. A long, scary looking scar went from his forehead to his chin and an eyepatch covered his right eye; he looked just like \u2018Cyclops\u2019. He looked very manly in his shiny armour, but the expression on his face revealed his ugliness.Brook whispered into Fei\u2019s ear, \u201cHe is the Military Judge, Conca.\u201dFei nodded. At this moment-\u201cOh, it\u2019s King Alexander. Ha, what should I say? Why are you here making a mess on the defensive wall? You should be staying at the palace. Let Gill go quickly, this is no joke!\u201dAfter seeing Fei step up, Conca wasn\u2019t nervous at all. He walked towards Fei and unwillingly bowed as he spoke. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the king.This military judge had excused himself from the battle on day one and had hid ever since. He had no clue what happened yesterday, and didn\u2019t see the scene where Fei slapped Gill vigorously earlier. He thought Fei was still the retarded king who had the intelligence of a three year old.\u201cDumbass!\u201d Bazzer swore in his mind, he knew things were about to get worse. He bent his back slightly and started coughing intentionally.But, the military judge thought he meant something else. Like a dog who got the appraisal from its master, after hearing Bazzer cough, Conca became more arrogant. He blocked Fei and started ordering soldiers around, \u201cYou bunch of dirty bugs! You should all die on the battlefield! Go now and find a stretcher! Remember, bring all the doctors in Chambord to Mr. Bazzer\u2019s mansion and heal Young Master Gill!\u201d\u201cAll the doctors are taking care of the wounded soldiers now. They don\u2019t have time\u2026\u2026\u201d Someone responded.\u201cThose dirty low lives, let them all die! They are no comparison to Young Master Gill. Quick, quick, quick! Do what I said!\u201d Conca didn\u2019t care at all.But\u2026\u2026No one listened to him this time.\u201cShit!\u201d Bazzer thought again, but he didn\u2019t know how to wrap this situation up now.After seeing that no one responded to his commands, Conca felt his prestige being challenged. He was mad, \u201cYou lowly slave! Dumb dirty bugs! Why are you guys still standing here? Aren\u2019t you guys afraid of the military laws?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of the military laws?\u201d Someone asked him from behind.\u201cMe? Hahahahaha, military laws? I make the military laws! At Chambord, anything I say is a military law!\u201d Conca who was enraged answered subconsciously.However, he felt something was wrong right after he said it. He turned around and realized that the person who had asked the question was the \u2018retarded\u2019 King Alexander. He only worried for a little bit, then he felt relieved.\u201cWhat does a retard know? I can say whatever I want, just like always. Hahaha, what could he do?\u201d Conca thought.But-\u201cYou reckless idiot!\u201d An impatient sneer came from Fei.Not even in Conca\u2019s wildest dreams would he imagine that the \u2018retarded\u2019 king would kick him on his back. An unstoppable force came from his behind and he flew forward uncontrollably.\u201cHo\u2026\u2026How?!\u201dConca smashed into the defensive wall. Blood spurted out his mouth like a fountain. He was shocked; how was a retarded king able to kick him, a peak one star, almost two star warrior away like a sandbag?\u201cDid I miss something?\u201dConca looked at Head Minister Bazzer as he was spurting blood, but he was surprised to find that the former \u2018acting\u2019 ruler of Chambord was standing aside quietly, not daring to say anything.Conca had a history of being a mercenary. He may have looked tough and reckless, but he was a smart and tricky character. He moved to Chambord Kingdom two years ago; because of his one star warrior strength, Bazzer appreciated him and tried relentlessly to get him the position of Military Judge to keep him as a henchman. Conca didn\u2019t observe anything carefully so he missed a lot of key hints earlier. After he got kicked, he had finally realized that something was wrong; that retarded King Alexander\u2026\u2026had changed!Conca started thinking fast. He knew that he was in a big trouble. It looked like the retarded King Alexander was back in power again.After he thought about it, he instantly understood the situation. He didn\u2019t even have time to care about his injuries. He flipped around and kneeled in front of Fei and started his act. He slapped himself and begged for mercy, \u201cPlease forgive me, Your Majesty! I\u2026\u2026I was drunk\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know what I did\u2026\u2026.Please forgive me!\u201dThe image of a 6 feet tall man kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy grossed everyone out.\u201cPlease forgive me, Your Majesty! I\u2019m sorry, I was drunk, please forgive me!\u201d Conca didn\u2019t mind the soldiers\u2019 disdain. He kept slapping himself and begging for mercy.\u201cYou are sorry?\u201d Fei sneered, \u201cYou are right! You should be sorry! You deserve to die!\u201dFei walked to the two soldiers who were kicked by Conca. He picked them up and brushed the dirt and dust off of them. He then brought the two clueless soldiers in front of Conca, who was still kneeling and begging.\u201cMilitary Judge Conca, open your eyes! Are they the dirty bugs you were talking about? Open your fucking eyes and take a good look! Which of them aren\u2019t wounded? Which of them didn\u2019t bleed in battle? When they were defending the kingdom for four days straight without sleep, where were you? The Military Judge was the one who was supposed be here in the frontline, but what were you doing?\u201dThe thunder-like roars horrified Conca, who kneeled even more. However, the soldiers on the defensive wall were pumped by what Fei said.Some soldiers were shivering due to excitement; tears filled their eyes. What the king said spoke to their hearts.\u201cDirty bugs? No! In my eyes, they are the cleanest people in Chambord. Blood stains and dirt? So what, that is a man\u2019s true honour! Those things will never cover up my warriors\u2019 pure souls\u2026\u2026But you\u2026 you are the complete opposite. Although you\u2019re dressed in shiny and bright armour, they will never cover up your dirty, disgusting soul! If you call them dirty bugs, then what the fuck are you?!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: One Strike! Again!The king\u2019s roar was like a million arrows that penetrated everyone\u2019s heart. Many veterans lowered their heads to cover their eyes, but their shivering bodies revealed their feelings. Many rookies couldn\u2019t hold back their tears and started crying, partially because they had been wronged, and partially because they were happy.Standing far away, Pierce, Brook, and Lampard were all pumped by the king\u2019s \u2018speech\u2019, and they felt that something was about to burst out of their chests.On the other hand, Conca was scared to death. He kneeled there and even forgot to slap himself. Because he was so ashamed, he was trying to think of something that would reduce the king\u2019s rage.\u201cIf you are the military law at Chambord, then what the fuck am I?!\u201d Fei roared again and kicked Conca to the ground. He turned around and asked Brook, \u201cCommander Brook, tell me. As a Military Judge, escaping from battles, offending the king and ignoring Chambord\u2019s military law\u2026 What\u2019s the punishment for all these crimes?\u201d\u201cIt shall be treated as treason and the death penalty shall be the punishment!\u201d Brook answered honestly.Fei looked at Conca who was struggling to get up and asked coldly, \u201cDid you hear that? Anything you want to say?\u201dNow Conca started to panic. Really panic.Although he had the strength of a peak one star warrior and was not scared of Brook and the soldiers, the number one warrior of Chambord, Lampard was standing there. Like a gigantic mountain hovering over him, Lampard gave him a ton of pressure. If Alexander really wanted him killed, Lampard could cut his head off in an instant.\u201cPlease forgive me! Your Majesty, I\u2019ll never do it again!\u201d Conca crawled under Fei and held onto one of Fei\u2019s legs. He cried as he begged for mercy; his arrogant and aggressive attitude had completely disappeared.\u201cYou want me to forgive you? Ask them, see if they agree.\u201d Fei pointed at the soldiers on the defensive wall.No one responded, but the hateful and angry stares that targeted Conca had answered that question. Conca never imagined that one day, he would have to beg the soldiers he deemed dirty and low to save his life. After thinking about the things he did in Chambord for the last couple of years, he knew that they weren\u2019t going to let him go.Conca also knew that the king wanted to set an example; unfortunately, he was the example. His last hope was the Head Minister Bazzer.After he received Bazzer\u2019s appreciation, he had done many dirty and revolting things to make the actual \u2018ruler\u2019 of Chambord happy. He hoped that Bazzer would do the same as he usually did: save his butt from any possible consequences.However, Bazzer stood there without saying anything; he didn\u2019t even look at Conca. The laid back expression on his face told everyone that he wasn\u2019t even close to Conca.Conca was disappointed. He looked up and found Alexander sneering at him. The surrounding soldiers had murderous looks in their eyes; if they could, they would eat him alive.He was deserted.\u201cYour Majesty, what do you plan to do to me?\u201d Conca started to calm down.Fei didn\u2019t even look at Conca. He raised his head and said to everyone on the defensive wall, \u201cMilitary Judge Conca has escaped from battles, offended the king, and messed aroung with the military law. According to the Laws of Chambord, these actions are equal to treason, and he shall be executed!\u201dAfter finally getting this chance, Fei wasn\u2019t going to let it go. This Military Judge was definitely Bazzer\u2019s henchman, and he made a mess in the military. From the soldiers\u2019 expressions, Fei knew that Conca deserved to be punished. For these people, it was best to exterminate them. It wouldn\u2019t just hurt Bazzer\u2019s control in Chambord, but would also re-establish the strict military laws and restore people\u2019s faith in Chambord\u2019s law. Fei was determined to eliminate Conca from the start.After Fei announced the judgement, the soldiers started cheering. But at this moment \u2013\u201cYou want me to die? Then die with me!\u201dA desperate scream sounded. Holding onto Fei\u2019s leg, Conca suddenly moved. A khaki colored flame lightly surrounded his body; this was the sign that Conca had almost advanced to a two star warrior. He was a peak one star warrior when he came to Chambord two years ago, but these two years of luxury and comfort didn\u2019t improve his strength at all. However, the situation he was in had stimulated his potential, and he advanced to a two star warrior.Moving like lightning, Conca jumped up and held onto Fei\u2019s neck.This usually ignorant Military Judge was behaving like an abandoned dog. He yelled crazily in people\u2019s gasps, \u201cFuck off! Shit! Get away from me! If anyone comes close, I will kill this retarded king!\u201dBrook, Pierce and the soldiers were shocked. They quickly surrounded him and sword, spears, blades, hammers and all kinds of weapons were pointed at him.\u201cLet go of the king! You weak bastard!\u201d Pierce swung his hammer and yelled.Brook was nervous. Although the king had demonstrated his monstrous strength that had killed one star warriors with only a single strike, the flame-like energies surrounding Conca meant that he was already a two star warrior. Moreover, Conca had sneakily attacked. He was worried that the king would be hurt and said quickly, \u201cConca, let go of King Alexander! I swear to the God of War that we will let you leave Chambord alive and you can go back to your life as a mercenary.\u201d\u201cMercenary? Hahaha, you want me to go back to being a precarious mercenary?\u201d Conca had lost his mind, he laughed like a madman and said, \u201cYou think that after two years of luxury and erosion at Chambord, I\u2019m still a qualified mercenary? I don\u2019t want to risk my life for a gold coin anymore\u2026\u2026 I need a ton of gold and two fast horses. Go get them!\u201dWhile Conca was distracted, the number one warrior of Chambord, Lampard was moving towards him slowly. The black sword on Lampard\u2019s back was shaking; Lampard was calculating the distance between them and thinking of a way to save Fei quickly\u2026\u2026However \u2013Conca discovered it.He screamed like a stimulated mouse, \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer! Mr. Lampard, stay away, farther\u2026\u2026farther! I know I can\u2019t fight you, but with a distance like this, don\u2019t you think I could twist off this retarded king\u2019s head before you could get to me?\u201dLampard was frustrated, but he had to back off. No one expected that it would come to this.Brook and Pierce were worried, but they didn\u2019t know what to do. If they could, they would substitute for Fei, but\u2026\u2026The only one who appeared calm in the crowd was the Head Minister Bazzer. Excitment appeared in his eyes. He prayed in his mind, \u201cIdiot, stop talking! Kill him now! Kill him. Hahaha, that will save me a ton of work\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGo prepare the money and the horses! Quick!\u201d Conca was nervous from the weapons pointing at him; he yelled repeatedly.But-\u201cDon\u2019t prepare that!\u201d Fei who was silent had finally spoke.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Conca was surprised.\u201cI said they don\u2019t have to prepare those thing. Because you don\u2019t have any more chances to enjoy the money.\u201d Fei said calmly, as if he was explain stuff to a kid.That calmness made Conca feel like he was the one being held onto, not Fei. The extremely nervous Conca was enraged, \u201cHaha, no more chance? Idiot, tell me why?\u201d\u201cBecause, you \u2013 are \u2013 about \u2013 to \u2013 die!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBefore Conca could react, he felt a severe pain from his stomach. It felt like his internal organs were exploded by someone. Before the hand that was on Fei\u2019s neck could do anything, he lost his strength, and the sky and ground started rotating in his eyes. He was sent into the air by Fei\u2019s punch.This scene made the crowd gasp again.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Many people were shocked. From their perspective, the young king who was seized moved his arm and hit Conca\u2019s stomach lightly as if he was playing\u2026\u2026The next second \u2013The flame-like energy surrounding Conca was smashed into pieces and disappeared quickly. Conca was lifted off the ground and flew up in the air.While the people were still shocked, Fei grabbed a spear out of a soldier\u2019s hand threw it towards Conca.\u201cShua -!\u201dThe spear split air and flew towards Conca like a huge siege bolt.Conca, who was still in midair, didn\u2019t even have the time to scream. The spear penetrated his heart accurately and the massive momentum nailed his body onto the watchtower on the defensive wall. His limbs twitched a couple times, but his head soon tilted and blood flowed out of his mouth. He couldn\u2019t be more dead.The crisis was eliminated.One strike?Technically two strikes, but a two star warrior was easily killed. Although there were a ton of miracles that were performed by this young king, everyone was still shocked, including the number one warrior Lampard.The difference in strength between a one star warrior and a two star warrior was not just the number. On the Azeroth Continent, the rank of the strength and power of warriors and mages were categorized based on the sky; there were three general ranks: [Sun],[Moon],and [Star].If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: [King\u2019s Sword]Star ranks were at the bottom of the whole system. For warriors, their ranks were determined by the \u2018thickness\u2019 of their energy. On Azeroth Continent, when a warrior created energy for the first time in training, a magical swirling star would appear over the warrior\u2019s head. The number of stars increased from one to nine as the thickness of their energy increased. Every time a new star appeared, it meant that the warrior had went up a rank; each rank would increase their strength dramatically.A nine star warrior was at the peak of the star rank. After that, if one could step over the peak of a nine star warrior, they would become a moon ranked warrior. However, this jump was extremely difficult. 70% of the warriors on Azeroth Continent would never become moon ranked in their lifetime.Moon ranked warriors were at a whole new level. They could choose different training methods. There were ones that chose to focus on using special weapons that were called [destiny warriors], ones that chose to make contracts with powerful monsters and share their powers that were called [beastspirit warriors], and many more. There were many training methods to become more powerful.Moon ranked warriors were very influential. They could easily obtain appreciation from the powerful empires on the continent. Noble status, money, political power, you name it.Above moon ranked warriors were sun ranked warriors. They were like gods; they only appeared in legends. The same applied to mages.Chambord was located very far from the center of the continent, so naturally, no one had ever seen or heard of sun ranked warriors or mages.This was the ranking system on Azeroth Continent. The strength Fei demonstrated had completely changed the understanding that people had about warriors in Chambord.Nobody knew what kind of power Fei had. Without having any energy, he easily punched through a two star warrior\u2019s energy shield and killed him instantly.As the number one warrior in Chambord, three star ranked warrior Lampard was confused as well. He couldn\u2019t believe it; it seemed like Alexander had only used his brutal strength\u2026.. \u201cBut since when could pure brutal force contend with a warrior\u2019s energy?\u201dOnly the honest Brook knew the \u2018truth\u2019; his body was shivering from excitement: \u201cIt must be the god\u2019s power! It must be the power that the God of War had left inside the king\u2026\u2026\u201dBazzer hid himself within the crowd. After seeing Fei\u2019s action, his facial expression remained gloomy. However, Bazzer was really surprised in his mind, \u201cThis is unbelievable. The retard didn\u2019t just turn normal. His strength is also unpredictable now\u2026\u2026 It seems like I have to make some adjustments to my plan\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t wait anymore.\u201dEveryone was thinking about what had happened. It was completely quiet on the defensive wall.Fei was surprised as well, seeing how he had instantly killed Conca. He felt like his strength increased significantly since yesterday\u2019s battle. After thinking about it, it was probably due to leveling up his barbarian character from 5 to 7. However, right now wasn\u2019t the best time to think about that.\u201cTink!\u201dHe turned around and drew his sword from the scabbard on his waist. He yelled, \u201c Pierce!\u201dPierce was surprised, but he quickly understood what Fei meant. He stepped up and half kneeled, \u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\u201cYou destroyed two of the enemy\u2019s siege ladders yesterday in the battle and helped Chambord fend off the enemies. I shall honor your feats as king and appoint you as the new Military Judge of Chambord. You shall be in charge of the [King\u2019s sword] and supervise the defense. If anyone dares to disobey any command or back off from the frontline, they shall be executed with this sword\u2026\u2026 including me; if I back off from the battle that is about to begin, you shall penetrate my heart with this sword!\u201dFei passed his sword to Pierce.This was the idea that Fei got from the military movies he watched on Earth. Before battle, morale was just as important as the military rules and laws. Healing the wounded soldiers and pretending to be the messenger of the God of War last night helped boost morale, while executing Military Judge Conca and appointing Pierce helped set up standards and reinforce serious disciplines.It was wise to establish both incentives and penalties.Pierce took the [King\u2019s Sword] with both his hand and said, \u201cAs you wish, my great king!\u201d After that, he jumped onto a battlement with the sword raised over his head and roared to his fellow soldiers, \u201cBrothers, battle! For King Alexander!\u201dThe surging morale was lit by Pierce\u2019s roar.\u201cTink! Tink! Tink!\u201d The sound of clanging metal surrounded the defensive wall. The sounds of swords and blades tapping on shields and armour\u2026 spears stomping the stone ground on the defensive wall\u2026\u2026Soldiers used this method to express their respect and support for the king.This was the king of Chambord!The real king!A couple minutes ago, some people were still hesitant in believing the godlike rumors; but now, everyone believed it.There was no need to doubt anymore. Fei\u2019s series of commands and actions had shocked everyone on the defensive wall. Especially when he yelled at Conca, it pumped up the wounded soldiers who had battled non-stop for many days. Simple recognition on Azeroth Continent was more valuable than any promises or physical rewards to soldiers most of the time. A king as such deserved their loyalty.Head Minister Bazzer stood in the crowd. Viciousness flashed through his eyes; no one knew what he was thinking about.Fei raised his hand and the soldiers quickly became quiet. They stared in excitement as they waited for the king\u2019s next command.Fei looked around and asked impatiently, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Warden Oleg here yet?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here\u2026\u2026\u201dA trembling figure squeezed out of the crowd. He walked up a couple steps and kneeled in front of Fei, \u201cGreat King Alexander, after receiving your command, I rushed here instantly\u2026\u2026 God bless you, my honourable king!\u201dThis figure was Warden Oleg.He was a little bit late, but he saw what happened to Conca. After thinking about what he had done to Alexander, he felt a chill to his bones. He was hoping that he would be forgotten by blending in with the crowd, but King Alexander had called him out directly. Oleg didn\u2019t dare play any tricks. Although he was scared, he stepped out, kneeled down and started to praise Fei.He even wanted to crawl over and kiss the king\u2019s boots.But-\u201cTink!\u201dWeapons were drawn out.Brook and Pierce stepped up and blocked Oleg, and the soldiers formed a bladed wall in front of Oleg. They didn\u2019t want him close to the king.Conca had approached the king easily and almost caused a tragedy. Although the king executed Conca, as the King\u2019s Guards, they couldn\u2019t let the same mistake happen twice.Oleg was terrified.He kept his head on the ground, \u201cYour majesty, please forgive me\u2026\u2026I\u2019m different from Conca\u2026\u2026I\u2019m super loyal to you, I\u2019m willing to sacrifice everything for you\u2026\u2026I\u2019m your most faithful servant, your commands are the purpose of my life, I\u2026\u2026\u201dFei frowned.This warden was only 5 foot 4. He had a huge beard. With a scar on his forehead; he looked sturdy and ruthless. However, Fei didn\u2019t expect him to be such a flatterer.\u201cHow could this flatterer manage the prison?\u201d Fei was suspicious.\u201cAlright, get up\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei signalled the soldiers to withdraw their weapons. He walked to Oleg and said, \u201cThis bullshit doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. If my commands are the purpose of your life, then pick up your weapon and fight for Chambord! You are a one star warrior right? Look over there\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei pointed at the part of the defensive wall and battlements he had destroyed yesterday because of the siege ladders, \u201cIn the coming battle, I want you to guard that gap, you got that?\u201dOleg looked at the gap. He knew that when the battle began, it would be the most intense battleground. Even if he was a one star warrior, he would have a hard time defending that gap\u2026\u2026However, he couldn\u2019t disobey the command.The strength of the \u2018new\u2019 Alexander devastated him. Oleg knew that if he dared to say no, he would be nailed on the watchtower, just like Conca.\u201cAs you wish, my honourable young king! I will guard that gap with my life! Even if I die, I won\u2019t let any enemy get close to you!\u201dOleg had to accept the command bitterly.He knew if he couldn\u2019t get the appreciation of the young man in front of him today, today would be the last day of his warden life. He accepted the command and more compliments naturally came out of his mouth.Fei was disgusted by it and backed off a couple steps.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: No Massacre if You SurrenderTime flew by. Like an ominous storm, a cruel battle was about to happen.The enemies on the other side of the Zuli River seemed to finish getting into position. The siege was going to start soon. Brook began directing the soldiers to set up defense tools and mechanisms. The average young adults came onto defensive walls to help out with some simple and crude tools, such as wooden sticks and chopping axes.However, the defensive power was still not enough. There were less than 400 soldiers from the King\u2019s Guards due to injuries and wounds and about 1,000 young adults who were just recruited with no military training. A total of less than 1,500 manpower was the strongest defense power Chambord could pull together.This force was way too weak compared with the 2,000 well trained enemies.Fortunately, Chambord had a ton of advantages due to terrain. But even under that advantage, Chambord\u2019s situation was still not optimistic.A powerful warrior or mage was very important to wars on Azeroth continent. If enemies had one or two more fighters like Landes, then Chambord would be doomed.Fei was extremely concerned about this.The sun started to rise and the atmosphere was getting tense.There seemed to be an invisible fire in the air. Most people felt a burning sensation in their chest every time they breathed.Fei stood beside the watchtower and waited for the battle to arrive.\u2018Fatty\u2019 Gill was not too far away from Fei. His legs were shaking heavily from fear. The bloodiness of war had terrified this spoiled young master and his head went blank. Fortunately, Bazzer had sent a few loyal guards of his to protect Gill, or Gill would\u2019ve already fainted.What surprised Fei was that according to Brook, this red robed bastard didn\u2019t have any battle abilities. That\u2019s why Fei didn\u2019t pay attention to him after dealing with Conca and Oleg. Fei thought that he would escape from the defensive wall, but who knew that he walked onto the wall and stood beside his son.\u201cThis tricky fox really cares about his son, huh? He does have some humanity\u2026\u2026 unexpected\u2026\u2026\u201dFei looked at Bazzer, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Everyone was waiting for the battle to begin.On the other side of the moat.The enemies had formed ten square formations. They approached Chambord step by step. Blades and lances shined under the sun.On the defensive wall, it was quiet. Everyone could hear their own heart pumping.Some of the new recruits\u2019 legs started to shake as well. Their hands were sweating like crazy; they almost couldn\u2019t hold onto their weapons anymore. A bloody battle was about to begin, and no one knew if they are able to survive this battle. But for their families, they couldn\u2019t back off.\u201cTap, tap, tap, tap \u2014-\u201cThe enemies marched in unison. Like a black flood, they approached Chambord Castle slowly and steadily with a ton of pressure. Like drumsticks hitting the drum, the sounds hit the soldiers\u2019 heart. It became faster and faster, stifling everyone on the defensive wall.The enemies at the front were positioned in a tower shield formation.There were one hundred huge black shields that were 2 yard (2 metre) high, and had ferocious devil faces carved onto them. They protected all the enemies behind them and walked forward steadily, as if there were a horde of devils approaching Chambord. Their formation changed as they approached the stone bridge. In each row, the ten person formation reduced to three people, allowing them to pass the stone bridge without a problem. They were still stepping in unison as this happened.There wasn\u2019t a single sound throughout the process. The enemies were like cruel and accurate killing machines, strictly and orderly operated. They demonstrated unbelievable discipline.This made Fei even more uncertain about the battle that had yet to begin. The enemy had a well-trained army, no question about it. Compared with the soldiers beside him, Fei knew that this battle was hard to win.The distance between the two parties was shrinking fast.In less than 10 minutes, the tower shield formation would step their feet onto Chambord\u2019s side of the moat. Once they did that, they would be in attack range of Chambord\u2019s archers, and the battle would begin.\u201cTink!\u201dBrook drew out his sword and stepped onto a battlement and yelled, \u201cArchers\u2026\u2026Ready!\u201d\u201cCreak, creak\u2026\u2026\u201d It was the sound of the archers pulling their bows. More than 100 longbows were pulled into a full moon shape. The shining tips of the arrows were like the grin of the Grim Reaper, waiting for Brook\u2019s command.But, at that moment \u2013\u201cTap!\u201dThe tower shield formation that was at the very front of the enemy\u2019s line stopped moving for some reason. The spear formation, swordsman formation, archer formation and the other six formations behind them stopped moving successively.The whole process was in uniform, as if it was only one person.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dAfter seeing that, Fei frowned. He didn\u2019t know what the enemy commander was thinking.Brook was also confused, but he didn\u2019t relax at all. He yelled, \u201cArchers ready, concentrate, no one is allowed to leave their positions!\u201dAfter he said that, there was a new change to the enemy\u2019s formation. Four black knights appeared in the formation slowly and walked to the front of the tower shield formation. The head knight was holding a three yard long (3 metre) knight lance, and the tip of the lance was lugging a helmet.Brook\u2019s face changed. He withdrew his sword and sprinted back to Fei; he lowered his voice and said, \u201cYour Majesty, the enemies want to negotiate.\u201d\u201cNegotiate?\u201d Fei was amused.\u201cSo lugging a helmet on a lance means that the enemy wants to negotiate on Azeroth Continent\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei memorized this little tip; he may need to use it later.\u201cBut these bastards have a great advantage, why do they want to negotiate?\u201d Fei thought.\u201cLet them come closer!\u201d Fei ordered Brook. He wanted to know what kind of trick the enemies\u2019 commander was playing.\u201cAs you wish!\u201dBrook turned around and let a soldier signal the response of accepting the negotiation.After seeing the response, the four knights rode their horses toward the defensive wall and stopped under the main gate of Chambord.\u201cFollowing my master\u2019s command, let the King of Chambord come up and hear the order.\u201dThe black knight named [One] stomped his lance on the ground. He raised his head and yelled arrogantly. His one star warrior\u2019s strength allowed his voice to resound loud and clear on the wall. Everyone on the defensive wall heard it and felt the arrogance in the voice.\u201cSay what you fucking have to say!\u201dFei yelled roughly on the defensive wall. The attitude of this enemy irritated him, so he didn\u2019t bother to pretend to be nice.Under the defensive wall, the pupil of [One] contracted.He didn\u2019t expect that the King of Chambord was the \u2018bull\u2019 that injured the three star warrior Landes\u2026\u2026 \u201cShit! Didn\u2019t the information from our intelligence agency \u2018Eagle\u2019 say that the king was a retard? How did this happen?\u201dFar away. The silver masked knight who was observing all this on the other side of the river was a bit surprised as well.But quickly, a smile came on his face, \u201cThis is getting more interesting. Sending a king to the colosseum, this amazing gimmick will surely get the interest of those noble ladies\u2026\u2026 Hahaha, it\u2019s more interesting than I imagined!\u201dUnder the defensive wall.\u201cMaster is very generous and kind; he is willing to let you all live\u2026\u2026\u201d The black knight [One] yelled proudly, \u201cListen closely, King of Chambord. Master said if you are willing to open the gate and surrender, the royalties and ministers and officers shall be protected by us. The citizens will only become slaves and not be killed\u2026\u2026\u201d after [One] said that, his tone changed. He sneered and threatened, \u201cIf you are so dumb and refuse to surrender, after we conquer your kingdom, we will massacre your kingdom for three days; not a single creature will survive!\u201dThe black knight\u2019s words were heard clearly by everyone on the defensive wall.People had different reactions. Bazzer, Oleg and some other ministers and officer started considering the \u2018suggestion\u2019 and were thinking about surrendering. Some citizens who were scared of death also wanted to surrender. Being a slave was better than being dead. Of course, there were people that showed disdain and held their weapons even tighter.Everyone was looking at the young King Alexander.The decision was up to the young king.Fei didn\u2019t reject right away. His looked at everyone\u2019s face. After seeing everyone\u2019s expressions, he thought of something and said slowly, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the enemies to do this \u2026\u2026 This is a hard choice, hahaha. Let\u2019s talk about it, what do you guys think?\u201dAs soon as he finished, Warden Oleg stepped up impatiently.This flatterer smiled brightly and said, \u201cMy great king, Oleg is willing to die for you on the battlefield. However, I believe you should consider the enemies\u2019 suggestions. We only have less than 400 soldiers and everyone is wounded in some way. If we continue to defend, we probably wouldn\u2019t hold up and we will provoke the enemies even more. Then everyone in the castle will die\u2026\u2026 Oh, of course! I\u2019m not scared of dying; I\u2019m just thinking for the whole kingdom.\u201dAlthough he sounded as if he was caring, his facial expressions revealed his true feelings. A warden counted as an officer of Chambord, so he would be protected by the enemies. He wouldn\u2019t have to die, and wouldn\u2019t have to become a slave. As a coward, it was the best choice for Oleg.Many people glanced disdainfully at Oleg as if they could shoot arrows with their eyes, but Oleg pretended that he didn\u2019t notice anything.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: This is a Real WarriorPierce stepped out and yelled at Oleg angrily, \u201cYou fucking coward! Stop saying shit! You\u2019re just scared of dying\u2026\u2026 Warden Oleg, you won\u2019t have to be a slave, but what about the citizens? We all know how horrible being a slave is, it\u2019s better to die in battle than that\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he said that, he turned around and said to Fei with craze burning in his eyes, \u201cYour Majesty! Please command us. My brothers and I are willing to die on the defensive wall of Chambord rather than become lowly slaves with our families!\u201dPierce was very emotional. Brook stepped out at the same time and half kneeled; he said seriously, \u201cKing Alexander, I wish the same! I would rather die in battle than become a slave!\u201d\u201cHua- hua- \u201cAll the soldiers and young adults kneeled down after Brook finished.Life as a slave on Azeroth Continent was worse than death \u2013 they could be killed and sold at their master\u2019s will. They would also be recruited into the death squads of the army or do hard labour. They didn\u2019t have any hope until they died of disease or exhaustion. Their descendants would also be slaves, with no hope.\u201cYour Majesty! We are all willing to die to defend the kingdom!\u201d The soldiers stared at the young king of Chambord, with their blood burning.Fei was also influenced by this. All the worries in his mind disappeared, and what was left was only bravery and pride. When he was about to say something, he thought of something and turned around and asked Bazzer who was in silence, \u201cBazzer, what do you think I should choose?\u201d\u201cDefense is our best option. We have a chance. I believe your majesty should not surrender at all!\u201d Bazzer answered solemnly.The answer surprised Fei. He thought that this gloomy red-robed old man was timid and preferred surrendering. Who knew that Bazzer was all in on the defending side of the scale, being all serious and stuff?However, there wasn\u2019t any more time for Fei to think. He knew that he had to make the final decision, and he couldn\u2019t disappoint his loyal followers. Under the eyes of many people who were paying close attention, he walked back to the battlement and yelled, \u201cDid you hear my soldiers\u2019 responses? Go back and tell that sneaky master of yours, if you want Chambord Castle, then take it away like a real warrior with blades and swords! Don\u2019t play these dirty old tricks and try to estrange our unity. In Chambord, there are only warriors that would bleed and die in battle, no cowards that would want to surrender!\u201dFei\u2019s words heated up the morale and desire for battle of the soldiers.The last sentence had especially excited and pumped the kneeling soldiers. They felt like something was about to burst out of their chests, and wanted to roar like wild beasts.Under the defensive wall.The four knight changed expressions. The reason the silver masked knight wanted to do this was to dismantle the unity and morale of Chambord; he wanted the royalty and citizens to have conflict so his army would conquer the kingdom easier and faster. They were deep into Zenit Empire\u2019s territory. If the whole siege took too long and the Zenit Empire found out about them, all their effort and time would be wasted.They didn\u2019t expect that the retarded king of Chambord used their strategy into his advantage and pumped the soldiers\u2019 morale\u2026\u2026The silver knight\u2019s plan fell apart completely.Black knight [One] was so mad that he started laughing. He twisted his lance holding the helmet and smashed it against the defensive wall and broke it into piece.He flipped his lance again and pointed it at Fei on top of the defensive wall. He swore arrogantly, \u201cYou unappreciative dirt bag! My master was generous and was willing to let you live; however, you just really want to die like a pig to show off your pitiful bravery\u2026\u2026 You dirty low lives, start trembling, you will pay for your decision! When the castle is conquered, the women will be torn apart right in front of you, the skulls of the elders and kids will be piled into mountains, and you\u2026\u2026\u201d He pointed at Fei, \u201cYou retard! You will be chopped into pieces and made into a stew to feed our horses. I swear!\u201dAfter he finished, he turned his horse around and was about to leave. However, the tough guy Pierce on the defensive wall was enraged by what [One] said. He grabbed the bow and arrow from an archer beside him, pulled on the bow and yelled, \u201cBastard! You want to leave after insulting my king? Take this!\u201d\u201cWoosh-\u201dThe arrow was aimed at the back of the black knight.\u201cTink-\u201d[One] swung his lance and blocked the arrow easily.He turned his head around and looked at Pierce, \u201cWhite haired punk, your strength is way too weak\u2026\u2026 I will remember you. Just wait, when we conquer the castle, I will chop your head off myself and place it onto the tip of this lance!\u201dPierce was born with inhuman strength, but he didn\u2019t have any energy and wasn\u2019t a star ranked warrior; however, [One] became a one star warrior a long time ago. They weren\u2019t on the same level. There was no way that Pierce was able to hurt [One], so [One] didn\u2019t even try seriously.[One] glanced through all the faces on the defensive wall arrogantly and started heading back while laughing out loudly.But at this moment \u2013\u201cIt\u2019s better if you leave your head here!\u201dA roar sounded on the defensive wall. A blue flash of energy appeared and a figure jumped off the tall wall. He swung his sword rapidly in midair and waves of blue energy flew towards [One] at the speed of light. They looked unstoppable and had great momentum.\u201cThis \u2026\u2026\u201dRight at that second, the shadow of death hovered over [One]\u2019s mind. His pupils contracted as he tried to block the waves of energy with his lance as fast as he could, thinking about a plan to escape from the situation\u2026\u2026But \u2013\u201cCrack, crack, crack!\u201dAfter a series of clear sounds, the hard lance was chopped into a couple large pieces. The blue energy surrounding the figure expanded and flashed in the observers\u2019 eyes a couple times to fight [One]. After that, he jumped up, grabbed onto the base of the defensive wall to regain his momentum and pushed as he jumped back up onto the high defensive wall.The whole process was clean and fast. Everyone was shocked by what had happened.After they processed what had happened in their minds, that godlike figure was already back on top of the defensive wall holding a head in his hands, with a pair of eyes still wide open.It was the head of [One]. Moreover, the person who was holding the head was the number one warrior of Chambord, three star warrior Frank Lampard.His strength had shocked everyone on the battlefield. The battlefield was dead silent.Suddenly \u2013\u201cPa!\u201dUnder the wall, [One]\u2019s beheaded corpse, which was on the horse fell and smashed onto the ground.Blood spurted out his neck like a fountain and quickly stained the soil underneath it\u2026\u2026This arrogant black knight who was yelling and screaming a second ago died under Lampard\u2019s sword in a few strikes and got his head chopped off; it was just like what he said he would do to Pierce.No one expected the silent Lampard to attack so suddenly. The extreme strength of a three star warrior was thoroughly demonstrated by Lampard.\u201cDot, dot\u2026\u2026\u201dOn the defensive wall, Lampard stood like a demon in front of the enemies. The head he was holding was still dripping blood. The eyes were wide open, filled with terror and regret.\u201cInsulting my king and breaking the negotiation helmet\u2026\u2026shall result in death!\u201dLampard yelled using his energy. The voice came out loud and clear and every enemy soldier heard it, even the silver masked knight on the other side of the wide river. The voice sounded like thunder, especially the emphasis on the word \u2018kill\u2019. Tt shocked the enemies and created a little chaos in the enemies\u2019 formations.According to the rules and customs of wars on Azeroth Continent, during negotiation, even if it didn\u2019t work out, parties were not allowed to break the helmet on the tip of the lances. Doing so was extremely disrespectful and would shame the God of War. [One] broke the helmet and insulted the opponent king; those action were forbidden, so he deserved to be killed.Fei looked at Lampard, he was in shock.\u201cThis is a real warrior!\u201dIn yesterday\u2019s battle, Lampard was entangled with the enemy\u2019s three star warrior Landes and didn\u2019t shine too much, but killing a one star warrior easily like eating pie proved that he deserved the soldiers\u2019 respect and worship.Fei knew that his strength was not as strong as that. But as a king who liked to show off, he wasn\u2019t going to let this chance pass by. He jumped onto a battlement, swung his axe and yelled to the three black knights who were still in shock, \u201cFuck off!!\u201dFei used the barbarian\u2019s war cry skill \u3010Howl\u3011 while yelling.Because of the distance between Fei and the black knights, it only surprised them and they didn\u2019t experience the terrifying pressure. However, Fei\u2019s targets weren\u2019t the three one star warrior black knights, but rather\u2026\u2026The horses they were on; they didn\u2019t have anywhere near the strength of a one star warrior.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: The Early Christmas PresentsAlthough the power of \u3010Howl\u3011 was significantly reduced by the time it reached the bottom of the defensive wall, it was enough to affect the average horses. The horses started to neigh in terror, and they lost their strength and fell to the ground, defecating everywhere.This took the three black knights by surprise, and they quickly jumped off of their horses.\u201cYou fucking\u2026\u2026\u201dNo matter how hard they whipped the horses, these well-trained battle horses seemed as if they were possessed; they wailed about but couldn\u2019t get up.\u201cOhohohoho, look! They pissed themselves, haha!\u201d\u201cFuck off, Bastards! Bring your weapons next time!\u201d\u201cYou want us to surrender? You must be dreaming! Taste my axe!\u201d\u201cChambord will not be conquered by you low lives! We will teach you a memorable life lesson\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha, you scared? Go cry to your mom!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter seeing that, the soldiers of Chambord burst into laughter. Some soldiers started mocking them, and some even took out their dongs and started peeing on the knights under the defensive wall\u2026\u2026\u201cTink, tink, tink \u2013 \u201cSome soldiers started tapping their weapons. The mighty and powerful metal sounds in addition to what Lampard and Fei did got rid of all the fear in everyone\u2019s mind. Even the most timid soldiers were excited for battle and wanted to kill a few enemies.\u2026\u2026Far away, on the other side of the Zuli river.Seeing what had happened from far, even the silver masked knight who appeared calm and relaxed became extremely angry.He was trying to use this negotiation to tear apart the unity within Chambord and create conflict within to dismantle their morale. Even if Chambord didn\u2019t surrender, Chambord\u2019s defensive ability would fall to an all-time low and it would be way easier for him to conquer the kingdom.However\u2026\u2026He didn\u2019t expect things to turn out like this.The rage and stupid behaviour of [One] had broken the unwritten rules of negotiation on the battlefield and gave Chambord a proper reason to attack [One]. [One] didn\u2019t just lose his life, but also gave Chambord a chance to stimulate their own morale and stomp on the enemy\u2019s morale.\u201cShit\u2026\u2026\u201dThe silver masked knight couldn\u2019t help but swear. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt the operation of sieging Chambord Castle wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as he thought.\u201cMaster, please allow me to kill that arrogant three star warrior!\u201dLandes felt it was a great opportunity for him to redeem himself. He stepped up and requested. Some of the other black knights were getting impatient too.As witnessing their own being killed one by one by the Chambord soldiers, they felt their pride as the silver masked knight\u2019s henchmen being challenged. They expressed their wish of sieging right away and executing everyone in Chambord.But \u2013The silver masked knight held his horsewhip tightly in his hands. The joints on his fingers were turning white because he was applying a lot of force; he was trying to endure the rage in his mind.After thinking for a moment, he waved at his subordinates and surprisingly stopped them. He said with a deep voice, \u201cFollow my command. Stop the siege right now. We will start attacking after lunch!\u201dLandes and the black knights were surprised; they didn\u2019t expect such a command.\u201cThose low lives are at the peak of their morale; if we siege right now, we will fall into that retarded king\u2019s trick\u2026\u2026\u201d The silver masked knight pointed at Chambord with his horsewhip, and said calmly, \u201cAfter lunch when their morale dies down, it will be our best opportunity to siege. Put all the siege ladders and machines into battle when it begins. I want this sinful castle to be conquered within half an hour! We will execute them for three days following it to seek the revenge for my warriors!\u201dHis calm voice turned into a roar when he was finished. He turned his horse around and headed back to the base.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026On the defensive wall.After three minutes, Fei and Brook looked at each other.Everyone on the defensive wall thought that after Lampard had killed the black knight, the enemies would be angered and would start attacking aggressively right away. All of the soldiers were ready for that\u2026\u2026Who knew that three minutes had passed by and the aggressive attacks hadn\u2019t come? The enemies\u2019 formation were still the same, occupying the whole bridge. They didn\u2019t move at all and just stayed out of the archers\u2019 range.\u201cDamn, what\u2019s going on?\u201dFei was confused. He even thought that the enemy commander\u2019s head had been kicked by a donkey, so he couldn\u2019t think straight. However, it was more likely that he was playing another trick.Brook was thinking hard beside Fei as well. He felt that the enemy commander\u2019s intentions were hard to estimate. Although the storm-like siege they expected didn\u2019t occur, a bigger and more rapid storm was developing in this short-lived peace.As the general commander appointed by King Alexander, Brook felt he had a lot of responsibilities, so he had to quickly understand the enemy\u2019s intentions.After thinking for a while, Brook looked at the mountains surrounding the kingdom.To make sure that the enemies were not attacking from the sides, Brook commanded a couple of smart soldiers to check from the peak of the three mountains, just in case the enemies sent star ranked warriors to climb on the mountain to siege from the sides.Fifteen more minutes passed by.As time passed by, the atmosphere on the defensive wall changed.Fei suddenly found out that some soldiers\u2019 spirits started to relax. The grips on the weapons loosened and their stares were losing focus. If the previous condition of the soldiers was like a bow that was pulled to the max, they were now a bow that was not pulled at all.The situation wasn\u2019t good. The morale that Fei raised with a lot of effort was slowly depleting due to the enemy\u2019s strange behaviour.\u201cShit! Could this be the strategy of the enemy commander? If it is\u2026\u2026\u201dFei was nervous.\u201cIf this is their plan, then we are in a lot of trouble.\u201dThis revealed a lot of information. \u201cThe clearest point is that the enemy commander is way smarter and stronger than I expected. He can control himself and grasp people\u2019s mind really well\u2026\u2026\u201d Morale was an interesting thing. If commanders used it to their advantage, it would literally determine the outcome of a battle.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dAfter getting a grasp of the enemy\u2019s intention, Fei couldn\u2019t find a good counter-strategy.It was obvious that the enemy commander played a dirty trick. Although his intention was discovered, the only way for Chambord to use the high morale to their advantage was to initiate the battle. However, for Chambord who had limited military power, giving up their terrain advantage to initiate the battle was like seeking their own death.But if this continued and every soldier was continuously alert, they would have a breakdown under such pressure sooner or later.After thinking for a moment, Fei called Brook aside and ordered him to divide the soldier into two groups. When the enemies were not sieging, one group would be guarding and observing the enemy\u2019s actions and one group would be resting. They would rotate every twenty minutes to make sure every soldier\u2018s physical and mental strength was at a standard level\u2026\u2026This was the best plan Fei could come up with. After another twenty minutes, the sun had already risen up to the middle of the sky.The sunlight was heating up. Thick armour, heavy weapons and the mental pressure from facing numerous enemies made the soldiers sweat.Fei stood on the defensive wall and observed the enemies even more, but he felt like they still didn\u2019t want to attack at all. He thought about it and decided to not wait like this.Every minute and every second was precious to him. He had to enter the Diablo World as soon as possible to level up and increase his strength. It was way better than waiting like this.He turned around and returned to the watchtower on the defensive wall. He let Pierce who was carrying the [King\u2019s Sword] guard the entrance. Fei himself sat on a stone and closed his eyes. He concentrated as he tried to communicate with the cold, mysterious voice.He got a quick response \u2013\u201cSufficient mental strength\u2026\u2026Scanning soul wave\u2026\u2026 confirmed\u2026\u2026Entering Diablo world in 3\u2026\u20262\u2026\u20261\u2026\u2026Ding, entering!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Fei chose the barbarian character again this time.He appeared on the burial grounds on \u3010Cold Plains\u3011.The corpse of \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 lied in front of him. Gold coins and items surrounded him. However, there was no time for him to pick them up; because he re-entered the world, the monsters on the burial ground had refreshed. Numerous \u3010Corrupt Rogues\u3011 and \u3010Fallen Shamans\u3011 started to attack as they saw someone appeared in their territory.Another round of battle had begun. With some effort, Fei swept the monsters at the burial ground again. He finally had time to pick up the items and coins.When he reached for the three blue magic items under \u3010Blood Raven\u3011\u2019s corpse, he moved the corpse a little bit. He suddenly saw some yellow light.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei was excited because it was the color of rare items.His hand shivered as he moved \u3010Blood Raven\u3011\u2019s corpse aside.There were more than one rare item!\u201cDamn, I must\u2019ve been good this year so Santa gave me some early Christmas presents!\u201dThere were three rare yellow items. There was a shield that had black hooks on it, an oddly-shaped sword and a delicate bronze glove.All three items were not identified, so Fei didn\u2019t know what their actual capacities were.After seeing the three yellow items, Fei didn\u2019t care about the blue items anymore and threw them all into his \u3010Item Slot\u3011.After he collected all the gold coins on the ground, he opened up his \u3010Character Status\u3011.P.S.RankItem TypeItem ColorLowestNormal ItemsWhiteMagic ItemsBlueRare ItemsYellowSet ItemsGreenHighestUnique ItemsGoldIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: A Hot MercenaryAfter Fei picked up all the items and coins, he opened up his \u3010Character Status\u3011-Gamer: FeiClass: BarbarianLevel: 7Experience: 35100/40000Strength: 51Dexterity: 20Intelligence: 10Vitality: 34Damage: 30-43Accuracy: 114Armor: 77Endurance: 1124Health: 126Resource (Fury): 19Fire-Resistance: 0Cold-Resistance: 0Lightning-Resistance: 15Poison-Resistance: 0\u2026\u2026These stats were way better than what he started with. But one thing was obvious, even with stats like these, it wasn\u2019t enough to solve the problem he was having in the real world.From Fei\u2019s rough estimation, level 5 in Diablo world was equal to a one star warrior.Between level 5 and 10, he could kill a one star warrior easily and would a big threat to the two star warriors, judging by how he killed Conca. However, when faced with actual two star warriors who could utilize their strength efficiently, it wouldn\u2019t be that easy. However, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible to win either. When facing a three star warrior like Landes or Lampard, unless Fei used sneak attacks, there was zero chance of winning.If he reached level 10, Fei believed that he could fight Landes effectively without using abilities such as \u3010Howl\u3011.This was why Fei had to use his time wisely and level up as soon as possible. Once his barbarian character surpassed level 10, Chambord would have a better chance of winning.Fei started his journey in the Diablo world again.\u201cBuzzzzz\u2026\u201dFei opened his \u3010Item Slot\u3011 and used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011, and the blue oval shaped portal appeared beside Fei. He stepped into the portal and went back to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.The first person he went to was Priestess Akara. He bought a \u3010Tome of Town Portal\u3011 and a \u3010Tome of Identify\u3011, which could each contain 20 \u3010Town Portal Scrolls\u3011 and 20 \u3010Identify Scrolls\u3011 respectively. They helped save storage room in his \u3010Item Slot\u3011.If each scroll took up a slot in his inventory, 40 scrolls would occupy the entire space and there wouldn\u2019t be any room for anything else.Because Priestess Akara was very cheap, Fei didn\u2019t want to sell the items he didn\u2019t need to her. He left Akara, and then went into an empty tent and started using \u3010Identity Scrolls\u3011 to identity the items he obtained.Fei started with the three yellow rare items. The first one was the shield that had black hooks on it. After using a \u3010Identity Scroll\u3011, all the properties of the shield appeared in Fei\u2019s mind \u2013\u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011Defence: + 20% Block: + 25%Durability: 10/10Required Strength: 35Required Level: 7Special Property: +9% Cold-Resistance, +17% replenish life (Increase life regeneration), +7 Resource (Fury), ethereal (Unable to repair)The properties of this shield were too good. It was the perfect shield for a barbarian. With this shield, Fei\u2019s defense had went up a level.The only drawback was that the durability of the shield was only 10, and it couldn\u2019t be repaired at all. Once the shield was broken, it would be gone forever. However, the pros outweighed the cons by a lot, and this shield was just what Fei needed right now.He equipped it without hesitation.Then, he continued the identification.After using one more \u3010Identity Scroll\u3011, the property of the golden sword appeared too \u2013\u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 (One handed)Damage: 3-7Durability: 24/24Required Strength: 25Required Dexterity: 20Special Property: +1 Minimum Damage, +16 Accuracy, +51% damage to Undead, +69 Accuracy to Undead, +5 lightning damage, +6 poison damage over 2 seconds.The sword\u2019s properties were amazing as well, just like how rare items were supposed to be.Fei thought about it and equipped it too. In the Diablo World, except for items such as armour and rings that a character could only equip one at a time, characters could equip two set of weapons and could freely switch between them in different situations.Fei equipped \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 and \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 as a weapon set. With the sword in the right hand and the shield on his left, they were a perfect set of substitute weapons. The massive double-handed axe was still Fei\u2019s main weapon.It was time to identify the last yellow rare item \u2013 the bronze gloves.The properties appeared after using the scroll.\u3010Bronze Self-Repairing Gloves\u3011Defense: +6Durability: 14/14Special Property: +15 Accuracy, +10% fire-resistance, +15% cold-resistance, self-repair 1 durability in 33 seconds.Another piece of beauty. Fei\u2019s head was a little dizzy, and he had to pinch himself to make sure that he wasn\u2019t dreaming. All three yellow rare items had amazing properties, and best of all, Fei could equip them right away as a level 7 Barbarian. It felt like the three items were tailored towards Fei.He equipped the \u3010Bronze Self-Repairing Gloves\u3011 to get rid of the old worn out leather gloves. The three yellow rare items were shining on him. It made him feel very powerful. He couldn\u2019t wait to go to the moor to battle with monsters just to try out his new \u2018outfit\u2019.After he finished identifying, he went to the female blacksmith Charsi.He sold all the blue magic items that he didn\u2019t need for 18,666 gold coins. Seeing all the 21,000 gold coins in his \u3010Item Slot\u3011, Fei felt a sense of accomplishment, going from a pauper to a prince in terms of wealth.Time was tight. After Fei finished everything, he repaired all his items at Charsi\u2019s, bought a metal helmet and a pair of heavy leather boots and quickly went to the next location on his mind.The next stop was Kashya, the military leader at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011. He completed the quest \u3010Sisters\u2019 Burial Grounds\u3011 and was there to receive his rewards.\u201cOh, god bless. Young traveller, you have really killed that sinful traitor\u2026\u2026Congratulations, you have earned my trust and friendship. As a reward, you shall receive a powerful female rogue as a mercenary.\u201dKashya was surprised that Fei had successfully completed the quest. After she finished speaking, a young pretty female rogue archer stepped out of a tent behind Kashya and walked to Fei.\u201cThis is the most powerful magic archer at Rogue Encampment, Elena. Young traveller, Elena shall be by your side and fight for you from now on. Kashya introduced the female rogue fighter to Fei.Fei took a close look. This young magic archer named Elena was about twenty one years old. She was only a little shorter than Fei. Her fiery red long hair was tied to the back of her head with a coarse cloth, and her figure was beautiful. She wore rough leather armour that only covered important spots on her body. A pair of leather barreled boots covered her calf, but most of her thighs were exposed; the leather war-kilt acted as a mini-skirt. Her appeal almost caused Fei to have a nose bleed. Despite her appeal, Fei felt that this female magic archer had a special feeling of courage and bravery that ordinary girls didn\u2019t have.\u201cHello, according to Leader Kashya\u2019s orders, I shall fight for you, young warrior.\u201dElena didn\u2019t like talking. After she said that, she stood behind Fei like a bodyguard. Her expression was very calm. Fei felt that although she looked cold and independent, she was easy to talk to.Fei remembered the effects of fighting with a mercenary that he learned on Earth from the original game.If he wasn\u2019t wrong, fighting alongside a mercenary would increase the speed of leveling up by a lot. He thanked Kashya and went to priestess Akara with his new hot bodyguard to receive the third quest \u2013 \u3010Search for Cain\u3011.This mission was a little bit more complicated.Fei had to cross the \u3010Underground Passage\u3011 and find a mysterious scroll in the \u3010Dark Wood\u3011 under the Tree of Inifuss. He had to then go back to priestess Akara to get the scroll translated \u2013 which would give Fei a series of numbers. He had to then touch the five cairn stones in sequence at \u3010Stoney Field\u3011 . This opened the portal that would send Fei to a mysterious space where the \u2018obscene\u2019 old man, Cain, was locked in a cage on a tree by a bunch of demons. Fei had to kill all the demons in that space and free the old man in order to complete the quest.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Unexpected ChangeThis quest was complicated, but it was very important to the plot in the Diablo World as a whole. This was because after the player rescued the \u2018obscene\u2019 old man Cain from the mysterious space called Tristram, the old man would be around the player wherever he went and would give out all types of quests to link the plot together in Diablo.Before Fei started the quest, he double checked his items and the details of the quest.It wasn\u2019t too challenging for Fei in his current condition. After calculating the time, Fei felt that he could complete the quest in two hours if everything went smoothly. There would also be extra time for him to do the things he planned before he would get kicked out. Fei decided to go and find the tree of Inifuss.Before he left the encampment, he looked at the hot mercenary Elena who was following him quietly. He thought of something and went back to the female blacksmith Charsi. He spent around 1,000 gold coins and purchased a strong bow, heavy leather armour, a pair of heavy leather boots and a top quality hat that was made for female characters.\u201cHey beauty, you can use these items, right?\u201dFei had a bright smile on his face. He said to Elena, \u201cIf you can use these, then put them on. When facing monsters and demons, a bit more strength will increase our chance of survival.\u201d\u201cThese\u2026..these are for me?\u201d Elena was surprised; she didn\u2019t expect this at all. It seemed too unbelievable.\u201cDo you thinking I\u2019m that sick to use female items?\u201d Fei felt that the hot mercenary in front him was very excited. He was a little confused; these items valued around 1,000 gold coins weren\u2019t that good under Fei\u2019s standards. It was like comparing a small patch of grass to a large tree if they were put beside Fei\u2019s weapons and armour.\u201cWhy are you so excited?\u201d Fei didn\u2019t know.\u201cThank you, young warrior.\u201d After confirming that those items were meant for her, Elena calmed herself. She bowed and thanked Fei and took the items into the tent behind Charsi.Soon, sounds of Elena changing her clothes came from the tent; Fei wished he had x-ray vision.After about 20 seconds, Elena walked out. Fei\u2019s eyes shined. Elena\u2019s new look was just too damn fine. The heavy leather armour covered in light blue light had outlined her perfect body. With the bow in her hand and arrows on her back, she looked like the goddess of war.\u201cHaha, it fits you perfectly. Let\u2019s go!\u201dFei felt his nose was about to bleed any second. He pretended everything was fine, turned around and started walking towards the gate of the encampment.The reason Fei bought this hot mercenary items wasn\u2019t purely because he was perverted; Elena was a great fighter. Increasing her strength would help Fei complete his quest quickly.A smiled appeared on Elena\u2019s face, but it was gone the next second and her calm demeanor returned. She didn\u2019t say anything and followed Fei quietly.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWoosh!\u201dThree \u3010Fallen Shaman\u3011 screamed as they fell on the ground.\u201cTink!\u201dA blue magic item dropped from the monster\u2019s corpse. Fei was excited. He picked it up and saw a unique shaped ring. It wasn\u2019t identified, so he didn\u2019t know the properties of the item.After using a \u3010Identify Scroll\u3011, Fei found out that the ring was \u3010Glimmering Ring\u3011, +8 Resources (Fury), +5 light radius. It wasn\u2019t too useful to a barbarian who fought in close combat, but Fei put it on; it was better than nothing.Elena glanced around carefully, maintaining full alert while Fei was doing that. What made Fei feel strange was that he felt that Elena couldn\u2019t see the items that dropped from the monsters. This was because the hot mercenary looked at him strangely, as if he was a mime artist.\u201cCould it be that the residents in the Diablo world like Elena can\u2019t see the items that drop from monsters?\u201d Something hit Fei, \u201cSo that means\u2026In this world, I\u2019m the only one who can obtain items from killing monsters?\u201dThis hypothesis surprised Fei. He felt he had discovered something, but he just couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around it.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Time was tight. Fei and Elena moved quickly through the map.In the deepest location of \u3010Stoney Field\u3011 which was connected to \u3010Cold Plain\u3011, Fei took Elena through a portal that brought both of them into the \u3010Underground Passage\u3011.After they stepped foot into the \u3010Underground Passage\u3011, all they could see was darkness.There wasn\u2019t any light in the passage, and the chilling wind blew against them.The sharp and devastating screams of the monsters echoed through the deepest part of the passage. A fishy stench filled the passage and made it even more terrifying.\u201cBe careful! Stay behind me. Remember, don\u2019t ever go in front of me.\u201d Fei turned around and ordered the mercenary.He was a barbarian, which innately had more health and armour. He could act as a tank that blocked all the damage in the front. Elena on the other hand was a ranged magic archer. She had a high damage, but low health and armour. If monsters got close to her, she would be in a dangerous situation.Elena was stunned. She didn\u2019t expect the young traveller in front of her to make such a decision. It was totally different from the scary myths that were passed around in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, where travellers would get the most value out of their mercenaries as possible. Before, Elena thought that her fate would be just like the female rogues from 60 years ago; she would be used as bait to attract monsters by Fei and act as a human shield, but\u2026\u2026While the hot mercenary was still in shock, Fei already started charging.\u201cRoar \u2013 !\u201dFei used warcry-\u3010Howl\u3011 as he swung his huge axe.He chopped three times easily and he separated the three \u3010Goatman\u3011 that were rushing towards him into six pieces from the waist.\u201cCome on! We have to move through here fast!\u201dFei turned around and said to Elena as he continued charging. He soon disappeared into the darkness; Elena finally reacted and chased after Fei.Numerous monsters and demons rushed towards Fei like a flood. He stepped forward and was about to strike when he heard a whooshing sound coming from behind him. Blue arrows flew past Fei and nailed four monsters right in their heads. The magic on the arrow exploded and turned them into ice statues; there were no life inside them.\u201cSick!\u201dFei gave Elena a big thumbs up.This female rogue was not just a pretty girl to look at. Her shooting skills were outstanding. All four of her arrows hit the agile monsters accurately in such a dark environment; her ability had proven her worth to Fei.Elena didn\u2019t react at all to Fei\u2019s compliment.Her bowstring kept on stretching, \u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh -\u201d three more arrows were shot out and sent three more \u3010Goatman\u3011 to hell.Fei discovered that this hot mercenary was an ice magic archer. All the arrows she shot weren\u2019t just powerful and did a ton of damage. It also slowed their movement and attack speed. She was literally the best supportive mercenary Fei could hope for.They kept moving through the passage.The \u3010Underground Passage\u3011 was like a maze. There were a lot of curved paths and forks in the passage; it was very easy to get lost. Monsters attacked from various hidden corners and places. It was like the easier version of hell; the cold wind blew and monsters screamed.Fei had done enough killing and had enough experience to not be affected by this.Elena seemed like she experienced a similar scene and was not scared, either.Every time she pulled the bowstring, a monster was killed. Of course, when faced with \u3010Disfigured Taints\u3011, \u3010Giant Spiders\u3011 and \u3010Yeti Wendigos\u3011, all of which were higher leveled monster, it took more work than just one arrow. Without Fei\u2019s assistance, she needed three arrows to take one of them down. Moreover, she had to keep her distance from the monsters during the process in order to fully utilize her bow and arrows.After about 20 minutes, their coordination became more proficient. As if they knew exactly what the other person was going to do, they barely talked to each other during the process, but they were becoming more coordinated. Fei swung his axe and smashed all the monsters that were close, while Elena shot her frost arrows to kill the monsters further away. The pace they were moving at was beyond Fei\u2019s expectations.\u201cIf we can keep this up, we could get to \u3010Dark Wood\u3011 and find that damn scroll under the tree of Inifuss in less than half an hour!\u201dFei was becoming more optimistic about the mission.At this moment, something unexpected happened \u2013\u201cAHHH!!!\u201dThe hot mercenary who was shooting at the monsters behind Fei suddenly screamed. Fei heard panic, anger and sadness in the scream; as if something terrifying had happened.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Elena\u2019s SurpriseFei was shocked. He quickly beheaded the monsters in front of him and turned around to see what had happened. It turned out that Elena was not attacked by monsters at all. However, she looked soullessly at the entrance of a dusky cave located far away. Her body was stiff, and her hand that was holding the bow was shaking uncontrollably. Tears dripped down her pale face as she stared at a blackened object.Fei was worried. He rushed to Elena. When he got closer, he found out that the blackened object was the ruined corpse of a female rogue.The corpse wore rough leather armour that was common for female rogues. She had red hair as well, but looked younger than Elena; around 17 years old. She had definitely been tortured by monsters when she was alive. Her chest was torn open, and her heart was missing. There were horrifying scratches on her left thigh, and her flesh on her right thigh was missing, exposing the bone underneath. It looked like it was eaten by something\u2026\u2026\u201cOh god! \u2026\u2026No\u2026\u2026 She\u2026\u2026She\u2019s Nina, she went missing when we were searching for food on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011, and she was \u2026\u2026\u201dElena lost the strength to stand. She fell on her knees and couldn\u2019t hold back her tears. \u201cShe was only 17, and that was the first time she had left the camp and participated in a mission\u2026\u2026and she volunteered to go\u2026\u2026Nina worked hard in the camp. It didn\u2019t matter how hard work was, she always had a bright smile on her face and encouraged us like a cheerful angel, making us laugh. How could this\u2026\u2026Wahwahwah\u2026\u2026These monsters should all go to hell!\u201dAfter listening to Elena\u2019s cries, Fei partially understood what had happened. It was obvious that this female corpse was someone Elena knew. She was taken by monsters a month ago while they were on a mission and suffered a horrific death in this cave.17 years old was an age that a girl should have been enjoying life and having fun, but Nina had a tragic fate. It saddened Fei, despite not knowing who Nina was.From the start, the Diablo world gave Fei a realistic feeling. He felt pain when he was injured, the NPCs had their own intelligence, and he felt thirsty, hungry and tired when he battled for too long\u2026\u2026But subconsciously, Fei had still treated this world as a game.However, after seeing the ruined corpse in front of him and listening to Nina\u2019s life story, Fei felt he got it all wrong. The Diablo World was also a real world. The residents in the world didn\u2019t just have intelligence, but emotions and feelings as well. They were living humans, not some programmed scripts and codes.\u201cIt\u2019s alright Elena, don\u2019t cry. Let\u2019s kill all the monsters here and seek vengeance for Nina!\u201dFei didn\u2019t know how to comfort this crying beauty properly. He reached for her hand and held up the crying mercenary. The \u2018Goddess of War\u2019 who had previously brutally killed monsters was now as weak as an ordinary little girl that needed care and protection. Fei had seen her weak side under her quiet and independent demeanor.Maybe this was her true nature, suppressed by the horrible environment. It didn\u2019t matter how strong or how calm she was when facing monsters; Elena was only a 21 year old girl. On Earth, most girls this age would be in school and have a bright future. Alternately, in the Diablo World, they needed to train in order to survive and battle against vicious monsters. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to watch their friends and families die and be unable to do anything about it.Fei dug a big hole in the ground with his axe and buried Nina\u2019s corpse. When he was moving the corpse, Fei found something \u2013 it wasn\u2019t gold coins or items, but rather a pocketful of plant seeds.The little girl who came out of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 to find food had saved her \u2018treasures\u2019, even though she died in such an environment. Elena treated those plants seeds as her most precious possession and put them carefully into her pocket. After Nina\u2019s body was buried, the two of them continued on their journey.Elena was still stimulated by what happened and transferred her sadness into anger against the monsters. Fei didn\u2019t really fight much; every time he was about to strike, arrows would kill the monsters he could see and send them to hell.Elena\u2019s attitude towards Fei had changed a lot. Although they still didn\u2019t talk much as they continued pushing forward in the dark passage, Fei felt that the eyes behind him were much softer when Elena looked at him\u2026\u2026As they moved forward, they had encountered a couple more corpses of female rogues. Luckily, Elena didn\u2019t know them, so it saved Fei a lot of trouble. However, he was compassionate, so he still took time to properly bury the poor rogues.Because Fei had memories of the original game, he chose the path that led them directly to \u3010Dark Wood\u3011 instead of going to the second level of \u3010Underground Passage\u3011.It was brighter, similar to when Fei and Elena first stepped out of the portal from \u3010Underground Passage\u3011 to \u3010Dark Wood\u3011.\u3010Dark Wood\u3011 wasn\u2019t that dark. There was more grass and trees than \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 and \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 despite not being close to a forest at all.Rain fell down from the sky. Fei looked in the distance and discovered crowds of monsters and demons. They were much more aggressive. When they saw two people appearing from the portal, they began charging towards them and screaming loudly.\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh \u2013 !\u201dA barrage of frost arrows shot out as if they were bullets from a machine gun.\u201cWhir, whir, whir -\u201dThe double handed axe had drawn a deadly trajectory as Fei swung it forcefully.Under the massacre of these two mad warriors, the monsters and demons died as fast as they charged.Fei and Elena destroyed the monsters as if they were skilled farmers harvesting their crops.Miserable screams filled the woods. The two of them quickly approached a giant withered tree about 50 yards (50 m) high while stepping in the flesh and blood of the monsters.It was the tree of Inifuss.There were piles of rotten corpses under the tree. Flocks of flies hovered above them. There were even some corpses hanging on tree branches, dripping blackened blood and pus. The stench around the tree could easily make anyone puke. The scene was like hell.Fei squeezed his nose as he slowly approached the tree, and then softly touched it.\u201cPa!\u201dA white parchment scroll shot off of the tree.Fei picked it up and opened it. There was a large circle drawn with some sort of reddish-black material similar to blood. The circle contained a five-point star and mysterious symbols covered the rest of the scroll. It looked like it was one of those magic scrolls, but Fei couldn\u2019t understand a thing.\u201cLooks like I have to get it translated by Akara.\u201dFei threw it into his \u3010Item Slot\u3011 and also picked up a few valuable items dropped by the monsters. He then used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011, and the blue portal appeared again.Fei turned around and signaled Elena who was guarding him to follow him into the portal. However, a surprised expression appeared on Elena\u2019s face again.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026is a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011?\u201dElena\u2019s voice shook, as if she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.The hot mercenary thought to herself, \u201cIf my fellow sisters had these kinds of magical scrolls, how many lives could that save? Maybe Nina would be still alive\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011.\u201dAlthough Fei had noticed Elena\u2019s change in mood, he didn\u2019t think too much of it, \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011 that only costs 80 gold coins?\u201d Time was tight and he needed a lot of time to execute his plans. There was no time to waste, so he answered casually and stepped into the portal.\u2026\u2026\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011Fei went straight to priestess Akara to get the scroll translated. Elena followed Fei and carefully went through the portal. This was the first time Elena had ever used the portal to get back to the camp, so her mind was filled with shock and curiosity. She had planned to visit her sisters and tell them about Nina\u2019s death, but after thinking about her new identity and Fei\u2019s quest, she hesitated and eventually gave up her plan.After about three minutes, Fei rushed back with the parchment scroll in his hand.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go and talk to your sisters?\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: TristramElena felt safe and secure whenever she was with this young traveller. The monsters that took her sisters and her a lot to effort to kill were like cabbages in front of him. All the monster were stopped by him and couldn\u2019t even get close to her. That man was like an insurmountable wall that blocked off all danger\u2026\u2026Reality had overturned her perception of their master-mercenary relationship. According to everyone\u2019s knowledge, including leader Kashaya, mercenaries were simply tools used by travellers. Some despicable travellers used their poor mercenaries to attract monsters and use them as human shields; this led to significant casualties in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.But in order to maintain the existence of the camp and to protect the weak residents who had no combat abilities, female rogues had to be hired as mercenaries for travellers and sacrifice themselves.Obviously, the young barbarian traveller in front of her wasn\u2019t like that. Elena didn\u2019t know if the tales were untrue or if she just got lucky and met a kind and brave traveller.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of the time that has passed. After 60 years of isolation, all the past travellers disappeared and the camp became an abandoned place. He was the first traveller to step into rogue encampment after 60 years\u2026\u2026Everything has changed.\u201d Elena had found an excuse.Fei laughed as he saw the slightly nervous expression on the hot mercenaries face; he didn\u2019t say anything. He turned around and walked back to the portal. Elena, who still had a lot of stuff on her mind, quickly followed Fei.\u2026\u2026It took Fei less than 10 minutes to go back from \u3010Dark Wood\u3011 to \u3010Stoney Field\u3011.It was fast because when Fei went to get the scroll translated from Akara, he also bought two \u3010Health Potions\u3011; one for himself and one for Elena. Also, the monsters on the way back had already been cleared, so there weren\u2019t too many obstacles.They quickly found the Cairn Stones.Fei took out the translated scroll and touched the five stones carefully in the order they were displayed on the scroll. Suddenly, the sky dimmed and everything around them turned dark.Harsh winds blew against the plains and lifted up all the dry leaves from the ground. It felt like the end of the world. At that moment, five blue beams shot off the five stones and slowly merged together, forming a bloody red giant portal in the center of the five stones. It looked like a pool of blood, and a yellow light was looming inside of it.It was the portal to Tristram, where the \u2018obscene\u2019 old man Cain was locked up.Fei stood there and sighed, \u201cThe way that these five stones shone was quite frightening, they made a large haze.\u201dElena was quite shocked as well.The things she saw when following Fei for the past two hours were way more exciting than what she had experienced the past twenty one years.\u201cAfter we go through the portal, there will be a ton of monsters and demons. Be careful and follow me tightly, don\u2019t rush forward\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei turned around and told Elena. He felt that he didn\u2019t stress hard enough, so he continued, \u201cRemember, if things get too dangerous, just turn around and escape from here. Don\u2019t be so stubborn.\u201dAccording to the plot, Tristram had already been destroyed by the awaken Diablo, and it turned into a paradise for monsters and demons. The great paladin Griswald had also fallen here and turned into a powerful demon; he was the boss in Tristram. If Fei wanted to rescue Cain successfully, it was going to take some effort. Fei was confident that he could sweep out all the monsters at Tristram by taking it slowly. He had about 20 \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011 in his \u3010Item Slot\u3011. They were enough to support Fei and Elena in the upcoming battle.However, if the situation became dangerous, he might not be able to protect Elena. If this magic archer was surrounded by monsters, she would surely be torn into pieces. That\u2019s why Fei reminded Elena about her safety so many times.After Fei said that, he stepped into the portal and disappeared from \u3010Stoney Field\u3011.Elena\u2019s heart warmed. Although there was nothing special about what Fei said, she felt his care \u2013 care directed at someone close.\u201cHe is the one that deserves my effort and sacrifice.\u201dShe pondered for a little while, and then a resolute expression appeared on her face, as if she had made some sort of decision. She then quickly stepped into the portal.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026At Chambord.The sun was about to rise to the center of the sky.The mysterious, black armoured enemies still didn\u2019t move. The sea of enemies occupied the bridge on Zuli River. Like a huge black snake hissing with its scarlet forked tongue, they were waiting for the best moment to strike.The pressure on the defensive wall was constantly increasing. There was no noise on the wall aside from the flow of the river. Everyone tensed up.The soldiers and young adults were sweating like crazy. Their previously hyped morale had died down to a dangerous level after a few hours of waiting. Although Brook had the soldiers rotate every twenty minutes, the pressure was torturing and tiring everyone out.The enemies had no sign of sieging. The constant silence was like an invisible knife stabbing at the soldiers\u2019 mental state, slowly cutting away their morale and bravery.Brook\u2019s heart began sinking as time gradually passed. Pierce carried the [King\u2019s Sword] and walked back and forth anxiously in front of the watchtower. Everyone was looking through the broken wall of the watchtower. Their eyes focused on the young man who was \u2018meditating\u2019.It was King Alexander who had miraculously recovered. If someone said that there was still hope for Chambord at this tragic moment, then that hope would definitely come from the king.Even the number one warrior in Chambord Lampard couldn\u2019t provide everyone the sense of security they needed, but somehow, the previously retarded king had comforted their hearts which were filled with fear.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Back at Tristram.Right after Fei stepped out of the portal, a bunch of \u3010Skeletons\u3011 surrounded him with their blades and started hacking at him.\u201cDamn, there\u2019s this many? And they\u2019re this aggressive?\u201dFei swore in his mind, then quickly swung his axe. He struck horizontally and \u2018Boom!\u2019, the three closest \u3010Skeletons\u3011 were smashed into bone fragments.The real challenge had yet to come. The rest of the \u3010Skeletons\u3011 flooded towards them. Behind the \u3010Skeletons\u3011 were the \u3010Zombies\u3011 that moved at a slower pace, and the \u3010Fallen Shermans\u3011 that had a lot of armour. The monsters and demons in Tristram were mutated, and their damage and defense increased exponentially.However, Fei was very strong. Everywhere his axe moved, monsters screamed and died brutally, but his attack speed was still not fast enough. He was wounded in between his attacks and his health was quickly dropping. It scared the crap out of Fei; he used warcry \u2013 \u3010Howl\u3011 to scare away the monsters near him and give him the chance to chug some \u3010Health Potions\u3011.The effect of \u3010Howl\u3011 quickly wore off and the monsters charged again.At this moment \u2013\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh -!\u201dFrost arrows flew at the monsters like hail.Elena finally came out of the portal. She pulled her bow rapidly and the nearby monsters all froze.\u201cKeep your distance, don\u2019t rush. Stay behind me!\u201d Fei yelled to Elena as he charged towards the monsters again and blocked them off so Elena could keep a safe distance and deal consistent damage.Fei used \u3010Howl\u3011 every time the monsters got too close; when they were affected by \u3010Howl\u3011 and started to run off, Fei chased them and chopped off as many heads as possible. Once the effect wore off, he would repeat the same thing over and over again.After about twenty minutes, the crowd of lower leveled monsters were swept out.Fei finally had a chance to look at the town of Tristram. Tristram was destroyed and in ruins. The once bustling city was no more. The ground was filled with cracks, the buildings had collapsed and hell fire burned everywhere, causing black smoke to rise into the dark sky. The residents of the town had been killed by the monsters and turned into blood seeking demons and undead. They wandered about and charged at Fei and Elena when they saw the pair.The final boss of Tristram was the fallen paladin Griswald. He was powerful and hard to kill. However, he hid in a ruined building and guarded Cain who was caged. This gave Fei sometime to prepare for the final battle.Fei and Elena walked slowly, trying to not disturb the big boss. Eventually, they had encountered a crowd of \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011. These archers were very smart, unlike the \u3010Skeletons\u3011 that only knew how to charge. They would only shoot arrows from far away, and a majority of them wouldn\u2019t come closer to Fei and Elena. Some of the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 snuck up on Fei and Elena to attack them.Fei signalled Elena to back off, and then switched to his secondary weapons.A yellow light flashed.\u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 and \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 appeared in Fei\u2019s hands. He quickly charged and stuck his sword into a \u3010Skeleton Archer\u3011\u2019s head who was sneaking up on them, and then forcefully shook his sword.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Master, Please don\u2019t fire me!\u201cHu-\u201dThe \u3010Skeleton Archer\u3011 shriveled and all the white bones turned dark green. This was the special effect of poison damage from \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011. Also, with the additional damage the sword dealt to the undead, the poor \u3010Skeleton Archer\u3011 didn\u2019t even have the chance to return any damage, shattering into bones fragments.Fei\u2019s sneak attack worked. He gave it a taste of its own medicine. While Fei was enjoying the feeling of accomplishment, the crowd of\u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 further away reacted.\u201cBing, bing, bing-\u201d All their bowstrings stretched and numerous arrows flew at Fei like rain drops in a storm.\u201cIt\u2019s starting!\u201d Fei held up his \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011, blocking the arrows while backing off rapidly. He was planning to disrupt the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 formation and kill them off one by one.However-\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!\u201dBlue ice arrows flew towards the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 behind Fei. He turned around and realized that Elena didn\u2019t follow his instruction to back off, but rather approached the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 while returning fire.\u201cShit!\u201d Fei knew they were in trouble.This was the first time Elena didn\u2019t listen to Fei. It seemed like she didn\u2019t know the hidden dangers in Tristram. If she continued attacking back, it wouldn\u2019t kill all the tricky \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011. Rather, it would put Fei and herself in a dangerous situation. There were two mini-bosses hidden in the crowd, and their arrows dealt high damage and carried magic effects. One shot ice arrows similar to Elena\u2019s arrow, which slowed movement and attack speed; the other shot lightning arrows that chunked a large portion of health. Even for Barbarian Fei who had a lot of health, he didn\u2019t dare fight them directly. He planned to chug \u3010Health Potions\u3011 as he fought them guerrilla style. If luck wasn\u2019t on his side, he could potentially disturb monsters and demons in the other areas of Tristram. |If the final boss Griswald was disturbed, the consequences would be disastrous.\u201cGet back! Quickly!\u201d Fei yelled at Elena, signalling her to back off.However, it was a bit late. The \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 noticed the mercenary. The terrifying \u2018arrow rain\u2019 covered Elena as well.Elena didn\u2019t have anywhere near the armor that Fei had, nor did she have a shield. Although she tried to dodge the arrows, a few arrows pierced her body. Blood started flowing out of her wounds and quickly stained her blue leather armour.\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026The quest is more important, don\u2019t worry about me\u2026\u2026I will attract their attention. You can go from the side and rescue Mr. Cain! Please go!\u201dThe arrows were still penetrating her body. She was sweating a lot due to the unbearable pain. Her face was pale, but her expression showed determination. She shook her head and bit on her beautiful red long hair to endure the pain. However, her hand movements didn\u2019t slow down because of the injuries, and she returned damage consistently even though the numbers of wounds on her body was increasing.Her armour was getting soaked in her blood, but Elena was like a Goddess of War that just wouldn\u2019t back off. There was no fear on her face, but rather hatred in her eyes. Step by step, Elena was getting closer to the crowd of \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011.But at this moment \u2013\u201cCrackle !\u201dOne of the mini-bosses \u3010Bone Warrior Archer\u3011 reacted. A life threatening lighting arrow hit Elena accurately. The mercenary\u2019s body shook. She almost instantly fell to the ground. Since she was now standing in the same spot, her health bar was dropping like crazy under the rain of arrows.\u201cShit!\u201dFei was worried about her. He ignored the arrows flying at him and sprinted towards Elena and held her in his arms. He then poured a bottle of \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 down her throat as he used his battle cry -\u3010Howl\u3011 to scare away the monsters approaching them. Then, he quickly used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011. As the monsters started to flood onto them, he quickly jumped into the blue oval portal with Elena.\u201cBuzz, buzz\u201dThey had luckily escaped from death and returned to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.Because of the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011, Elena had almost fully recovered, and her mind was clear. Fei on the other hand was heavily injured on his back. The ice and lightning arrows from the mini-bosses almost paralyzed him. Although he wasn\u2019t dead, he only had 30 health left after all the bleeding; a couple more arrows could have killed him.It was a very scary situation. Fei didn\u2019t know if he could revive or not and whether he would die in the real world as well if he died in the Diablo World.\u201cMan, I can\u2019t act like a hero all the time!\u201dFei smelled the light fragrance from Elena\u2019s body, but he had no time to enjoy it at all. He grabbed a bottle of \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 and drank it himself. He threw one towards Elena, and then pulled the arrows out of his back. Blood was spurting out again, so he had to drink one more bottle to counter the pain.Luckily, \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011 tasted sweet and had no side-effects.\u201cHoly, damn this pain\u2026\u2026 Hey beauty, why won\u2019t you listen? I told you from the beginning to back off, didn\u2019t I?\u201dFei\u2019s health was full again. Fei had to blame the hot mercenary; if she had listened, they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.Elena lowered her head and tears filled her eyes. She didn\u2019t talk back. She didn\u2019t drink the \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 either. She held it in her hands because she didn\u2019t want to drink such a precious potion. The injuries on her body weren\u2019t fully recovered and she was on the verge of crying. Fei\u2019s heart softened as he saw that, so he didn\u2019t blame her anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drink the potion\u2026\u2026Oh, right. You don\u2019t have to follow me back to Tristram later. I won\u2019t be able to take care of you there. When I finish the quest, I will come back and find you.\u201dAfter some thinking, Fei decided to leave Elena at the camp and complete the quest alone. If both of them went, Fei really wouldn\u2019t be able to watch out for her. An archer wouldn\u2019t be effective when dealing with a group of archers. If the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 kept on harassing them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to cooperate very well and the hot mercenary could be surrounded by monsters and torn into pieces.However, Elena misunderstood Fei\u2019s meaning.\u201cAh? No! Please don\u2019t fire me, master\u2026\u2026Next time\u2026\u2026Next time, I can watch out for myself\u2026\u2026I can protect myself\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201dElena\u2019s panic surprised Fei. This was probably the first time she spoke that much to Fei.Since a long time ago, Tristram had fallen, so the road to the east was blocked by all the monsters. The rogues in the encampment could only get items and potions from travellers like Fei to maintain the existence of the camp on the moor. The items and potions that blacksmith Charsi and leader Akara made weren\u2019t enough to support the whole camp.The accumulated resources throughout the whole history of the camp had depleted in the past 60 years when all the travellers disappeared. If this continued, the camp would be conquered by monsters and demons and fall within a year.Fei\u2019s appearance in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 was an opportunity for the camp to survive. He was the first traveller that stepped foot in the camp after 60 years. These travellers could get items and potions from the moor that the rogues would never get. This was the reason why Kaysha was willing to provide mercenaries for Fei, a complete stranger in the camp, despite knowing that numerous rogues were used and humiliated by the travellers.This was all for the survival of the camp and its residents. Someone had to make the sacrifice. Elena wasn\u2019t the strongest of all the female rogues, but she was definitely the prettiest and hottest. To maintain cooperation with Fei, any type of sacrifice had to be made \u2013 including the female rogue\u2019s life and body.If Elena unfortunately died on the moor or during an adventure, other female rogues would take her place to maintain the connection between Fei and the camp.This was the cruelty of the Diablo World \u2013 the brutal \u2018Law of the Jungle\u2019.That was how the small encampment could survive throughout history, and how the residents were able to live on.Without a doubt, Fei was the only hope and light in the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 that was approaching eternal darkness. No matter how many sacrifices they had to make, the leaders of the encampment were willing to make it.Of course, Fei didn\u2019t know about this. This was why the normally calm and quiet Elena was so anxious when she thought Fei was firing her.If she offended the traveller, it would bring an immeasurable loss to the encampment. Moreover, Fei had been very caring towards her the past two hours, which was thousands of times better than working for the despicable travellers she had heard about in tales. Elena was also getting used to fighting alongside of Fei. She cherished the opportunity to be Fei\u2019s mercenary.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Initiation of the Plan\u201cFire you? I didn\u2019t say I was going to fire you.\u201dFei was confused by Elena\u2019s panicked expression, \u201cElena, you must\u2019ve understood me wrong. I\u2019m only planning on fighting the monsters by myself. When I finish this quest, I will take you to complete my next quest.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter getting an explanation from Fei, Elena was a bit relieved. However, she was still trying to convince Fei to let her join, partially because she didn\u2019t want to be separated from Fei, and partially because abandoning a master was really shameful for female rogues.\u201cOkay, my time is tight, so I\u2019ll explain the details next time.\u201dAlthough Fei loved being around the hot mercenary, there was no time to waste considering all the dangers in the real world. He cut her off and stepped into the portal. To make sure that Elena didn\u2019t follow him, he even shut down the portal right after he stepped back into Tristram.Elena stared at the place where the portal was at. The expressions on her face were complex. There was remorse, disappointment\u2026\u2026and happiness. A smile came onto her face as she blushed subconsciously.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cRoar!\u201dThe first thing Fei did after he shut down the portal was use his warcry \u2013 \u3010Howl\u3011.It was really effective. A mysterious and terrifying power spread around him as he roared. It scared the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 who were staring at the portal and they began to scatter and flee.\u201cThis is the chance!\u201dFei charged at them and smashed his axe blade into their backs. A couple skeletons were instantly killed. After about 10 seconds, \u3010Howl\u3011 wore off and the monsters turned around and rushed back at him.Fei used \u3010Howl\u3011 again. In the Diablo World, as long as characters had enough resources (Fury/Mana), they could spam their abilities; there weren\u2019t any cooldowns or chants requirements. Fei had prepared a few bottles of \u3010Minor Mana Potions\u3011, allowing him to use \u3010Howl\u3011 as many times as he needed.After the eleventh \u3010Howl\u3011, the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 were cleaned out. On the ground, there were two blue magic items from the two mini-bosses and a lot of other ordinary items. Fei didn\u2019t identify them and simply threw them into his \u3010Item Slot\u3011.As he got closer to the center of Tristram, a new type of monster appeared \u2013 \u3010Tainted\u3011.They looked like Ipotanes from Greek Mythology, half human and half goat \u2013 except that they had a bull head in place of a human head. Their huge scythes dealt tons of damage.However, these types of melee monsters were not a threat to Barbarians.Fei continued using his \u2018cheap\u2019 \u3010Howl\u3011 tactic and cleared the crowd of \u3010Tainted\u3011. There was also a mini-boss \u3010Tainted Leader\u3011 who had a lot of health, but Fei easily killed it. Two more blue magic items dropped, but Fei had no time to pick them up.All the noise from battling the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 and \u3010Tainted\u3011 had drawn the attention of the final boss of Tristram \u2013 Griswald.The former Paladin rushed out of a ruined building covered in hellfire. Griswald had turned into a demon. The difference between the other demons and monsters and him was that Griswald still looked like a human. There were no obvious signs of demonification, aside from his bloodshot eyes. Death, cruetly, violence, viciousness and bloodiness were the only emotions Fei could see from Griswald\u2019s eyes. Griswald looked terrifying.Griswald was a powerful Paladin. After his fall, he became even stronger. Although he lost the blessings from the God, his new demonic powers made him even more vicious and effective as a killing machine. He was fast; after he saw Fei, he roared as he charged at him. His fist came at Fei like lightning.Fei blocked the punch with his shield.\u201cBoom!\u201dFei felt a large amount of force against his shield. He was knocked back a couple steps despite his strength as a barbarian. He also felt a burning sensation, which quickly spread throughout his body. Fei felt like his blood was burning inside of him; pain seeped deep into his bones. This was the demonic power that Griswald had acquired \u2013 additional hellfire damage that could penetrate shields.Fei switched weapons and the huge double handed axe appeared in his hands.\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh!\u201d Fei struck three times. Light reflected off the sharp edges of the axe. All three strikes hit Griswald and the brutal strength left three startling wounds on his body. The final boss roared in pain; the attack lowered the boss\u2019s health bar by about one-tenth.\u201cHaha, awesome! If I can hit him about twenty five more times, he\u2019ll be dead.\u201dFei was excited because he had a chance of defeating the final boss. He chugged a bottle of \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 and held against a round of Griswald\u2019s aggressive attacks. He swung his axe aggressively at Griswald, but only two strikes hit this time.Fortunately, the fallen Paladin wasn\u2019t too smart. Although he had formidable strength and power, he wasn\u2019t able to utilize them properly. He could only throw powerful punches at Fei, which weren\u2019t too hard to deal with.Fei constantly backed away as he fought. Both of them were soon outside of town.This way, even if there was a lot of noise during the battle, it wouldn\u2019t attract the monsters and demons in the ruined buildings. If all the monsters in town were attracted, the situation would be too dangerous.Just to be safe, Fei turned around and sprinted away to gain some extra distance. He used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011 to open up the portal back to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011. If the situation became too dangerous, he could chug a bottle of \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011 and run back to camp.However, he soon found out that he was being overcautious. After chugging four bottles of \u3010Minor Healing Potion\u3011, Fei successfully killed the final boss of Tristram.Griswald fell down as Fei landed his axe on top of his head. Lots of gold coins and items dropped from the corpse.The lights almost blinded Fei\u2019s eyes, but he spotted a green item.\u201cDamn! A set item?\u201dFei was surprised by his luck. Green items belonged to a set. These items were really hard to get. Although Fei was expecting something good from the final boss, he was still surprised that he actually got a green set item.He couldn\u2019t wait to pick it up and take a closer look. It was an exquisite looking armour and green light shined all over it, but it needed an identification to reveal all the properties.Fei used a \u3010Identity Scroll\u3011 without any hesitation.\u201cDing!\u201d The name and properties appeared in front of Fei.\u3010Arctic Furs\u3011Defence: + 48Durability: 20/20Required Strength: 12Required Level: 2Special Properties: + 303% Enhanced defence, +10 all Resistance.Note: The set includes: \u3010Arctic Furs\u3011, \u3010Arctic Binding\u3011, \u3010Arctic Horn\u3011, \u3010Arctic Mitts\u3011. Bonus properties will be granted based on how many set items are equipped.\u2026\u2026The result was a little bit disappointing.\u3010Arctic Furs\u3011 was an item in the set \u3010Arctic Gear\u3011. It was a perfect set for Amazons, but it didn\u2019t fit a Barbarian.However, the properties of \u3010Arctic Furs\u3011 was quite good; it was way better than the armour Fei was wearing. The enhanced defense and resistance were valuable, so he equipped it right away.Aside from this green set item, there was a yellow rare item and a couple blue magic items.However, Fei didn\u2019t pick them up.After eliminating the boss Griswald, the \u3010Skeleton Archers\u3011 and the \u3010Taints\u3011, there weren\u2019t any other monsters and demons that were a threat to Fei. He decided to rescue Cain first. There wasn\u2019t anyone who was going to steal his items.Fei rested his axe on his shoulders and walked back to Tristram.A bunch of screaming \u3010Spike Fiends\u3011 charged at Fei, but they all turned into experience for Fei in a few seconds. Soon after, \u3010Zombies\u3011 followed in their steps; after about five minutes, all the monsters and demons were wiped out.Fei found Cain locked up in a cage on a tree at the centre of Tristram.\u201cSave me! Young traveller, come and save me!\u201dAfter he saw Fei, Cain started screaming as if he had swallowed some Viagra and saw someone running around naked. His pitch was so high that his voice was more painful to listen to than the monsters. It sounded like someone was poking his butthole with a stick.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dFei swung his axe and the rope that held the cage to the tree was cut in half.The wooden cage fell to the ground and broke into pieces.The \u2018obscene\u2019 old man rushed out of the cage. He didn\u2019t even say thanks; he opened up a portal and ran into it like a mad dog.\u201cDamn this old man, he didn\u2019t even say thanks!\u201dFei stared at the portal that quickly closed. Fei had to give Cain some credit for his running speed; even Fei couldn\u2019t run that fast as a strong barbarian.Fei stuck up his middle finger at where the portal was to express his feelings. After that, Fei started cleaning up the battlefield. He threw all the items into his \u3010Item slot\u3011 and returned to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 using the portal that he opened when he was fighting Griswald.He didn\u2019t know where Elena went; she wasn\u2019t anywhere close to the portal. Fei decided to go to Akara to get his rewards for the quest.The reward was simple. The cheap priestess gave Fei a VIP discount on everything she sold, and Cain who Fei had just rescued would identify items for him for free.Compared to the complexity of the quest, the rewards were severely lacking, akin to something given to a beggar. \u201cAkara and Cain are both cheap to the core!\u201d Fei thought.He started distributing his attributes and skill points after that. After he killed the fallen Paladin Griswald, Fei had become level 12. It exceeded Fei\u2019s goal of level 10 when he entered the world. A portion of the experience was from the bonus of having Elena as his follower.The 25 attributes points were distributed as \u2157 to \u3010Strength\u3011 and \u2156 to \u3010Vitality\u3011. For the five precious skill points, Fei added one point to \u3010Taunt\u3011, which taunts a monster into fighting you, one point to \u3010Sword Mastery\u3011, one point to \u3010Polearm Mastery\u3011 and two points to \u3010Leap\u3011, which allows Fei to jump and knock back enemies where he lands.After all of that, Fei took a look at his \u3010Character Status\u3011-Gamer: FeiClass: BarbarianLevel: 12Experience: 95414/112725Strength: 66Dexterity: 20Intelligence: 10Vitality: 44Damage: 30-55Accuracy: 169Defence: 77Endurance: 37Health: 157Resource (Fury): 19Fire-Resistance: 10Cold-Resistance: 10Lightning-Resistance: 25Poison-Resistance: 10\u2026\u2026These stats comforted Fei. From past experience, a level 12 Barbarian was about a two star warrior in the real world; but with all of his additional skills, he could fight a three star warrior without a problem. Fei was confident that he could force Landes back without being injured the next time he fought him.Of course, Fei could only force him back. If he want to defeat or even kill him, he need to be around level 20.\u2026\u2026Fei went to the free labourer Cain to get all his items identified. Cain had a lot to say, but Fei\u2019s time was tight. After all the identification was done, Fei quickly ran off before Cain could even stop him.He went into an unoccupied tent to take a more detailed look at all the items.The yellow rare item was a short bow. It looked simple, but was very classy. It was called \u3010Boreal Razor Bow\u3011. It had great properties, but Fei couldn\u2019t use it.He thought that Elena could probably use it, so he decided to give the bow to her as a present the next time he saw her. \u201cIf she\u2019s really touched\u2026\u2026Eh\u2026\u2026Could I make out with girls in the Diablo World?\u201d Fei thought shamelessly.The rest of the blue magic items were mediocre, so he sold all of them to the blacksmith Charsi. With an additional 20,000 gold coins, Fei now had a total of 40,080 gold coins.After everything was set and done, he initiated his plan.He went to Akara first and bought 5 bottles of \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011 which were more effective than \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011, and 2 bottles of \u3010Stamina Potions\u3011 at a 10% discount. He then went back to the unoccupied tent and tried to communicate with the cold, mysterious voice in his head.\u201cAre you there? I need to convert five bottles of \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011, 2 bottles of \u3010Stamina Potions\u3011 and 1 \u3010Town Scroll Portal\u3011.\u201dSilence.After five, six seconds, the voice responded \u2013\u201cAs you wish\u2026\u2026Each bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 costs 5,000 gold coins to convert with a success rate of 25%. Each bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 costs 2,000 gold coins to convert with a success rate of 35%\u2026\u2026 Your level is not high enough to convert \u3010Town Scroll Portals\u3011\u2026\u2026The total is 29,000 gold coins. Confirmation needed.\u201dThe price was within the expectation of Fei. The only thing surprised him was that he couldn\u2019t convert \u3010Town Scroll Portals\u3011 because of his level. \u201cSo there are other factors other than money and success rate\u2026 I just haven\u2019t discovered them all yet.\u201d Fei thought.But from the voice\u2019s response, Fei discovered some patterns \u2013The more valuable and complex an item was, the higher the cost, lower the success rate and more restrictions it had. Compared to \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 which costed 5,000 gold coins to convert with the success rate of 25%, \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 were less valuable, so it only costed 2,000 gold coins to convert and the success rate was 30%.\u201cDo you still want to convert?\u201dAfter not getting a response from Fei right away, the voice asked again. This time, it sounded a bit impatient.\u201cYes, confirm!\u201dFei answered quickly as the voice stopped his train of thought.\u201cDing! Conversion calculating\u2026\u2026Sufficient gold coins\u2026\u2026 5 bottles of \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011 with success rate of 25%\u2026\u2026Calculating\u2026\u20262 bottles converted successfully, 3 bottles failed to convert\u2026\u20262 bottles of \u3010Stamina Potions\u3011 with success rate of 30%\u2026\u2026Calculating\u2026\u20261 bottle converted successfully, 1 bottle failed to convert.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Sorcerer, Paladin and NecromancerThe cold mysterious voice gave Fei an answer right away.After spending 29,000 gold coins, he finally converted 2 bottles of \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011 and 1 bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 into the real world. The end result made Fei feel really salty, despite mentally preparing himself for such a result because of the 25% and 30% success rates. The loss was pretty significant.However, after carefully considering the poor success rate, he comforted himself, \u201c2 bottles of \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011 and 1 bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 are better than nothing, I guess.\u201dThere was less than two hours left until he reached the maximum \u2018gaming\u2019 time for today. He decided to exit his Barbarian character. After a feeling of zero gravity, his vision blurred for a second. Soon, his vision cleared and he was back at the 3D projected character selection screen.Fei discovered that there were some tiny changes \u2013 the barbarian character was wearing new items he just got from Tristram and the character looked tougher and bigger than the other six level 0 characters.\u201cIt looks like the screen reflects everything that goes on in the Diablo World.\u201dFei also found out that there could only be one character per class. Because the Barbarian and Sorcerer classes had already entered the Diablo World, Fei couldn\u2019t create any characters in those two classes.This seemed to reveal something, but Fei didn\u2019t have much time to spend thinking about it.He chose the Sorcerer character and re-entered the Diablo World.After the light buzzing noise and the feeling of zero gravity, Fei stepped back onto the starter\u2019s map \u2013 \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.After some close observation, Fei found that this camp seemed like a parallel universe to the universe that the Barbarian character was in. All the plots were in their initial stage. Quests like \u3010The Den of Evil\u3011, \u3010Sisters\u2019 Burial Grounds\u3011 and \u3010Search for Cain\u3011 were still not completed yet. They were all waiting for Sorcerer Fei to finish.Because of all the experience Fei had on these quests when he was a Barbarian, Fei started them right away. He rushed to the new Akara and received the quest \u3010The Den of Evil\u3011 and went straight to \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 to level up the Sorcerer character.After 30 minutes, Fei completed his first quest. He returned from \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 and received one skill point as the reward.At this point, his sorcerer was already level 3. While killing monsters on the moor, they dropped items such as normal armour and gloves. He equipped all the items he could use and kept the rest in his \u3010Item Slot\u3011 to be sold later.He also had 4 skill points. After some thinking, he put 1 point into \u3010Fire Skill \u2013 Fire Bolt\u3011, 1 point into \u3010Lightning Skill \u2013 Charged Bolt\u3011 and 2 points into \u3010Cold Skill \u2013 Ice Bolt\u3011.After he did that, he didn\u2019t return to the moor. He exited the Diablo World again and re-entered as a Paladin.After the same buzzing noise and zero gravity, he landed in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 again.As expected, it was another parallel universe. The plot and quests were back at their initial stage and yet another new Akara had given him the quest \u3010The Den of Evil\u3011.Paladin Fei rushed to \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 to complete the quest. With the new experience of completing the quest as Sorcerer Fei, he completed this quest even faster. He wiped out all the monsters in the den in less than 15 minutes. Also, he visited every spot on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 and executed the three empty policy \u2013 empty out all the monsters, empty out all the gold coins and empty out all the items.He reached level 3 again when he returned to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and got 4 skill points after he received his reward from Akara.Fei opened up the skill tree of the Paladin. After careful consideration, he added 2 points to \u3010Offensive Aura \u2013 Might\u3011, which increases all the damage dealt by team members, and 2 points to \u3010Defensive Aura -Prayer\u3011, which heals all team members.After finishing all those things, there was less than 50 minutes left in his daily time limit.He exited the World again and switched to Necromancer.\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011Another parallel universe.Necromancer Fei got the quest from another new Akara and went straight into the \u3010Den of Evil\u3011 on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011.It was the fourth time he was doing the same quest. He killed the boss Corpsefire in less than 10 minutes and returned to camp.At level 3 and with the additional skill point from Akara, he again had 4 skill points.Fei received a wand when he spawned as a Necromancer, which gave him a point to the skill \u3010Summoning Skill \u2013 Raise Skeleton\u3011, which raises one skeleton from a dead body to fight. Therefore, he put 3 points into \u3010Poison Skill \u2013 Teeth\u3011 which summons multiple projectiles that damages enemies and 1 point into \u3010Curse \u2013 Amplify Damage\u3011, which increases the damage enemies take.The reason he distributed the points like that was to use them in the battle that was about to happen in the real world.Of course, the skill Fei needed the most was \u3010Poison Skill \u2013 Corpse Explosion\u3011, which explodes a nearby corpse and damages all nearby enemies.However, after considering the existence of the Holy Church on Azeroth Continent, Necromancers were probably considered to be evil and burned alive like what the churches did to heresies and \u2018witches\u2019 during the medieval period.Those were just Fei\u2019s predictions, but it was never a bad thing to be extra careful. From Brook\u2019s and Angela\u2019s description, the Holy Church on the Continent had dominant powers. It was best to avoid them as much as possible.Some of the Necromancer skills like \u3010Raise Skeleton\u3011 were too obvious and could not be used in the real world, but \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011 was quite hidden, so it could be really effective during wars. Corpses were things that were never lacking during a war, and those corpses were like grenades in the eyes of Necromancers. They dealt a ton of damage and were very sneaky.Therefore, the reason why Fei chose Necromancer, the \u2018most dangerous\u2019 occupation on the continent after acknowledging the existence of the Holy Church was for the skill \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011.But when Fei was distributing skill points, he almost collapsed when he found out that \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011 required the player to be level 6.Fei looked at the time.There was less than 30 minutes in today\u2019s \u2018gaming\u2019 time. There was no way Fei could level up 3 times in less than 30 minutes, unless he could find a perfect spot where a ton of high level monsters and demons were at.Fei thought about it and decided to go and kill \u3010Blood Raven\u3011.The burial grounds where \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 was at had a ton of high level monsters. They were a great source of experience. Although it was quite dangerous for a level 3 Necromancer, Fei felt he could handle it if he was cautious because of the experience he had while playing as a Barbarian.The situation Chambord was in was dangerous as well, so Fei had to take a risk.After receiving the quest from Military Leader Kashya, Fei spent all the 800 gold coins he had and bought the necessary items he needed including \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011, \u3010Minor Mana Potions\u3011 and \u3010Stamina Potions\u3011.It became night time in the Diablo World. It was dark on the moor, and Fei couldn\u2019t see anything far away. He could only hear the screams and roars of the monsters and demons.Fei chugged a bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 when he left the camp and sprinted towards the \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 where the burial ground was at. The monsters screamed even louder when they noticed Fei on \u3010Blood Moor\u3011. However, Fei didn\u2019t bother to battle them, as he had to save all his time for the higher leveled monsters in the burial ground.However, something happened that Fei wasn\u2019t able predict \u2013The monsters and demons seemed more energetic and aggressive at night time. After being disturbed, they started chasing Fei non-stop as if they were male prisoners that hadn\u2019t seen a woman in more than ten years and Fei was a naked beauty.Soon, all kinds of monsters \u2013 \u3010Fallen Shamans\u3011, \u3010Corrupted Rogues\u3011 and \u3010Wendigoes\u3011 \u2013 all joined in the chase.P.S.

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Return of the King(If you have time, you can support us through Adfly too: Chapter 40 Adfly)In a few minutes, almost all the monsters on the moor had joined in the \u2018parade\u2019, as if they were celebrating something significant. When Fei reached the junction between \u3010Blood Moor\u3011 and \u3010Cold Plain\u3011, there were three to four hundred monsters and demons chasing him.\u201cDamn!\u201dFei was so happy when he saw this. Although these monsters were low level, the massive amount of them would still give him a huge amount of experience. He stopped running and started clearing the monsters. He waved his wand.Poison Skill \u2013 \u3010Teeth\u3011\u201c Whirr-\u201dA cloud of cold death energy flowed out of the wand. Three teeth shaped bones appeared out of nowhere; they were covered in death energy and shot towards the monsters as they followed a strange trajectory in the air. The thirty \u3010Fallen Shamans\u3011 who were leading the \u201c\u2018parade\u2019 were shattered into pieces.Fei waved the wand again. Another cloud of cold death energy formed.Summoning Skill \u2013 \u3010Raise Skeleton\u3011\u201cCrack, crack -\u201dEnergy surrounded a \u3010Fallen Shaman\u3011 corpse and began moving. Soon, its flesh burst open and a skeleton that was holding a bone blade in its left hand and a bone shield in its right hind rose up. It blocked the monsters\u2019 path perfectly. It was fast, too; it swung its blade and killed a couple \u3010Fallen Shamans\u3011 that were close to it.While his skeleton warrior blocked off the \u2018monster army\u2019, Fei was abusing \u3010Teeth\u3011. Numerous teeth shaped bones shot out into the crowd of monsters.Fei didn\u2019t even have to target anything; there were so many monsters that as long as Fei faced the right direction, the skill would be able to shatter a couple of them. \u3010Teeth\u3011 had a penetration effect, so it could kill at least a couple monsters in a line.After six seconds, the skeleton warrior that Necromancer Fei summoned was smashed into fragments by the monsters. Fei turned around and sprinted to gain some distance from the army.He summoned another skeleton warrior to block the path and once again shot many \u3010Teeth\u3011 into the monsters. The process was repeated a couple times.Although there were some dangerous situations, Fei was able to react quickly. Also, with more than ten bottles of \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011 and \u3010Minor Mana Potions\u3011, he could easily live.After five minutes, the last monster in the army screamed as it fell into a pool of its own blood. Fei glanced at the battlefield filled with broken limbs and shattered organs. The monsters\u2019 and demons\u2019 blood soiled the ground. Rain with all the blood, and the only colour Fei could see was red. The stench of blood and flesh filled Fei\u2019s nose.It was a one sided massacre, but Fei only felt numb. He felt like he was getting used killing and death. He evolved from a university student who felt dizzy after seeing any blood to a \u2018Super Butcher\u2019 whose mental state wasn\u2019t affected even if millions of people were killed.Beside the corpses, there were also gold coins and items soaked in the rain and blood.Because these monsters were all low leveled, there weren\u2019t any good stuff. Time was tight; Fei glanced through them and threw the four blue magic items into his \u3010Item Slot\u3011; he didn\u2019t bother keeping the rest.There were less than 15 minutes left. The cold wind blew at Fei after he stepped onto \u3010Cold Plain\u3011. The monsters here were stronger and more aggressive. Fei chugged a bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 and started running again. Just like on the \u3010Blood Moor\u3011, monsters started chasing Fei after he made too much noise.For the first time, Fei discovered the effect of running in the Diablo World at night time. It was way more realistic than the original game and the monsters were more flexible and lively than the original programmed codes.Halfway to the burial ground, Fei had to stop and deal with the monsters that were chasing him. If too many monsters chased him, Fei didn\u2019t think he could handle all of them at once, even though they were still lower level and there weren\u2019t any mini-bosses in the crowd. A single man was no match for an army. If their numbers were large enough, ants could take out an elephant.Fei stopped and used the same tactic \u2013He summoned a skeleton warrior to hold off the monsters and shot a lot of \u3010Teeth\u3011 behind it.The first four minutes went smoothly. The monsters fell and died like crops under Fei\u2019s deathly tactic, and the number of monsters became a lot smaller. But the situation suddenly changed \u2013Maybe it was because the other monsters heard the noises from the battlefield and the desperate screams from their own; numerous monsters rushed into battle from all directions. A single skeleton warrior wasn\u2019t enough to hold them off. Fei had to start running around, chugging potions while dodging attacks and using \u3010Teeth\u3011 to fight back.\u201cDamn, why are they so active at night? They must had taken Viagra\u2026\u2026\u201dFei was feeling the pressure.Although he wasn\u2019t in much danger, there was no time to waste. If this continued, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get to the burial ground and kill \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 on time. His goal of getting to level 6 and learning \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011 before leaving the Diablo world was probably not going to be accomplished.After Fei thought about it, he increased his spell casting speed, but there were just too many monsters to be killed. After a couple of them died, even more monsters would join the chase. Ultimately, Fei had killed a lot of monsters, but even more monsters chased after him.\u201cDamn it! I didn\u2019t kill your families did I?\u201dFei was getting frustrated. He used his wand as a stick to strike a couple monsters that were getting too close to him and kept spamming his \u3010Teeth\u3011 and \u3010Raise Skeleton\u3011 skills; he was lucky that there were no cooldowns for spells in the Diablo World. He could use skills as frequent as he liked as long as he had enough mana.Fei danced in between monsters while chugging \u3010Minor Healing Potions\u3011 and \u3010Minor Mana Potions\u3011.The monsters were still lower level on \u3010Cold Plain\u3011 and there were barely any ranged attack monsters and demons. Fei was able to hold himself together in this situation.\u201cShit! I\u2019ll never get to \u3010Blood Raven\u3011 at this speed\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter checking the time, Fei knew that there were only a couple minutes left.Sure enough, after about five minutes, that cold, mysterious voice appeared in Fei\u2019s mind \u2013\u201cGamer Fei, you have reached the maximum gaming time for today, please be ready to leave Diablo world in 10\u2026\u20269\u2026\u20268\u2026\u2026\u201dFei felt helpless.He wasn\u2019t able to level up to level 6 after all; he had been level 5 for a while now and needed a little bit more experience to reach level 6. He was so close to \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011, which could help him defeat the enemies that surrounded Chambord\u2026\u2026\u201cFuck these Viagra eating bastards!\u201dFei was pissed. He shot as many \u3010Teeth\u3011 into the crowd of monsters as he could before he had to leave. The energy covered sharp bones were shot into the spot where the most monsters were at; numerous painful screams emerged\u2026\u2026At this moment, something unexpected happened \u2013\u201cDing!\u201dA clear sound resounded in Fei\u2019s ear.A beam of white light came down from the sky and embraced Fei. The comfortable sensation filled Fei\u2019s body. All his wounds quickly recovered and his health and mana rose to the max.Level Up!Fei had leveled up at the last second.He was stoked!He had no time to worry about anything else; all he did in the last second was open up the Necromancer skill tree and add 1 point to \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011.\u201cLooks like my luck is isn\u2019t that bad, hitting my goal at the last second.\u201dFei was relieved.At that moment, everything in his vision twisted. He felt the zero gravity again and darkness hit him. Fei was kicked out of the Diablo World.\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026Chambord Castle.It was finally noon.Although it was Autumn, the heat was still unbearable. The dark defensive wall heated up against the sun, as well as the soldiers\u2019 weapons and armour. Some soldiers were so exhausted that they had to sit down and get some rest.Exhaustion and anxiety were like two mountains that sat over the minds of the soldiers, taking them closer to the point of mental breakdown. The enemies were still not sieging.However, the soldiers of Chambord felt their vicious and murderous glares. The enemies were like a snake coiling on the stone bridge; they could feel a chill to their bones under the bright sun.No one knew when the breathtaking pressure was going to end.No one knew when the bloody battle was going to erupt.No one knew if the Chambord would be the same after the battle and if they could walk down the stairs of the defensive wall alive and hug their family members who were waiting for them at their doorsteps\u2026\u2026Brook was walking around on the defensive wall, trying to motivate the soldiers. However, it wasn\u2019t that effective. The physiological and mental exhaustion wasn\u2019t going to go away after a talk.The Second Commander of the King\u2019s Guards quickly found out that his pep talking skills were far from King Alexander\u2019s. The young king could motivate the soldiers after a couple sentences, while Brook had said more than a hundred sentences and barely got any reaction out of the soldiers.Fatty Gill was breathing heavily while sitting on the ground. He was probably going to die if their family warrior didn\u2019t hold up a sun umbrella for him. Head Minister Bazzer stood behind Gill calmly. He eyes were squinted, and no one knew what he was thinking about\u2026\u2026Warden Oleg was sitting at the spot that Fei commanded him to guard. The chest piece on his armour was taken off by him to use as a fan. He was mumbling something as he flapped his chest piece to create some wind. He looked at the enemies over the river and looked at the head warrior Lampard as if he was planning something. However, after he saw the corpse of Conca still nailed onto the wall of the watchtower, he tucked in his neck.Pierce had the [King\u2019s Sword] strapped on his back. He was walking around the watchtower anxiously.As time passed and the temperature on the defensive wall rose, he became more and more impatient. He didn\u2019t know that the king was doing in the tower. It was quiet; not a single sound came from within the building. If Pierce wasn\u2019t subdued by Fei, he would already have rushed in to ask what was going on.At this moment, suddenly \u2013Three star warrior Lampard was shocked. He felt a strong, yet ghastly power coming from within the watchtower, which really surprised him.At the same time, one star warrior Oleg felt something too. He felt a terrifying pressure pressing down on him; the pressure was far more than what he could handle. It felt like the stare of the Grim Reaper. He only felt this way when Lampard was enraged. \u201cLampard isn\u2019t angry right now, could it\u2026\u2026could it be Alexander?\u201dOne star warrior Brook felt the same. He looked at the watchtower with excitement.The person closest to the watchtower was novice mage Gill. As if he saw the thing that he was most scared of, he jumped off the ground in a shock and he trembled. After seeing his son\u2019s reaction, Bazzer opened his eyes suddenly as if he thought of something interesting, and then squinted them again.Of course, aside from the mages and warriors, the ordinary soldiers didn\u2019t feel anything. This included Pierce.He only had inhuman strength; although he felt that the atmosphere on the defensive wall had changed a little bit, he couldn\u2019t point out exactly where it was coming from.\u2026\u2026In the watch tower.Fei opened his eyes. He looked through the ruined window to check on the enemies. Four hours had passed and the situation Chambord was in was very close to what Fei predicted \u2013 The enemy\u2019s commander was like a dormant cobra, still waiting for the best moment to strike.The situation was still frozen. It was up to the quality of the soldiers at this point.Compared to the well trained enemies, the defensive power of Chambord were like novices, regardless of whether it was the King\u2019s guard or the newly recruited young adults. As time passed by, the gap between the strength of the attackers and defenders only grew wider, and the enemies seemed more dangerous and unstoppable.If Fei wasn\u2019t wrong, the mysterious enemy\u2019s commander was waiting for a perfect time \u2013 after lunch, it was the most tiring time of the day for an average person, and it would be a perfect time to siege.Fei looked up at the sky and knew that there was about twenty minutes left until lunch.The battle was about to begin. He had to start planning. Fei stood up from the rock he was sitting on. He didn\u2019t walk out of the building right away.He closed his eyes and searched for the powers he brought out of the Diablo World. From Fei\u2019s experience, aside from the strength of a level 12 Barbarian, he also had the power of a level 3 Sorcerer, a level 3 Paladin and a level 6 Necromancer.Gradually, he felt something.A looming, cold, deathly force field surrounded him. It looked mysterious and complex.It felt really familiar. Fei opened up his hand. Suddenly, a white cloud of death energy formed into a swirl in his palm. It was whining and whirling, as if it was a mini-sized tornado.\u201cThis is\u2026 the death energy of the Necromancer.\u201dFei was excited. But soon, his eyebrow wrinkled.He couldn\u2019t feel any power from the Barbarian, Sorcerer and Paladin aside from the Necromancer. Despite how hard he tried, there was no response.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Fei close his eyes and thought.He was nervous, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u2026Damn, was my hypothesis about bringing every class to the real world wrong?\u201dAt this moment \u2013\u201cHint: Only one character can be usable at a time. If you wish to use the abilities of another character, please switch characters.\u201dThat cold, mysterious voice sounded in Fei\u2019s mind.\u201cSwitch characters?\u201dFei was confused. But after thinking about it for a couple seconds, Fei understood what it meant.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this.\u201dFei said, \u201cSwitch to Barbarian\u201d in his mind.\u201cHu-\u201dSomething magical happened the next second.The white cloud of death energy disappeared from Fei\u2019s palm, and so did the looming, cold, deathly force field.Fei didn\u2019t feel any Necromancer powers at all; it felt like it never existed. What he could now feel was the ultimate physical strength of a level 12 Barbarian.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Surprising New Finds(If you have time, you can support us through Adfly too: Chapter 41 Adfly)After switching to his Barbarian, all Fei could feel was his brutal physical strength.It made him felt like he could collapse the firm defensive wall with a single stomp.\u201cMy strength increased so much after I leveled up the Barbarian to level 12\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei felt like he was the ocean and could tear up anything in his way. \u201cThis is it\u2026\u2026This is exactly how I feel as a Barbarian the Diablo World.This never-ending strength made him feel like Hercules. He glanced down subconsciously. His expression was strange. He gasped as his eyes opened wide, as if he saw an undead creature walking around in the real world.He found something unimaginable.Not sure when, but the heavy knight armour he was wearing in the real world was gone, it was replaced with a exquisite looking armour. The style of the armour was exotic, it was made with an unknown material. There were a lot of mysterious symbols all over the armour and it they all shined a green light; there was a strong magic energy in it.Except the armour, he was also wearing a pair of leather boots, helmet, gloves, belt\u2026\u2026Fei recognized them all.\u201cThese\u2026\u2026these are the items of the my Barbarian character\u2026\u2026.How\u2026\u2026How did I bring them into this world? What\u2019s going on? Oh my god\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t remember converting these items from that voice\u2026\u2026\u201dThe unexpected discovery made Fei\u2019s heart race.\u201cHow\u2026\u2026.How did this happen?\u201dFei\u2019s mind was blank; there was no explanation for this. From his previous experience, if he wanted to bring anything, even a pile of monster crap to the real world, he had to get it converted by that mysterious voice. He had to pay the fee and bear the risk of not succeeding. What confused Fei was that he didn\u2019t ask to convert the items, but was able to bring them to the real world.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cHint: After the player\u2019s character exceeds level 10, the player can use the character\u2019s items in other worlds other than the Diablo World\u2026.. Hint: The items can only be used by the player. They can\u2019t be traded, lost, or repaired by blacksmiths in other worlds\u2026\u2026Hint: The durability of items will decrease naturally. They can only be repaired in the Diablo World\u2026\u2026Hint\u2026\u2026Hint\u2026\u2026\u201dAs if that voice had heard all of Fei\u2019s questions, many \u2018hints\u2019 had given Fei a detailed explanation.\u201cSo\u2026\u2026It\u2019s\u2026\u2026that\u2019s how it is.\u201dFei tapped his forehead, his mind was clear.\u201cSo that\u2019s the benefit of exceeding level 10\u2026\u2026Will there be more benefits after I exceed level 20, 30 or even 90?\u201d Fei tried to ask that voice greedily.Unfortunately, there was no response.\u201cOk\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t tell me it you don\u2019t want to! \u2026\u2026Ah, if I can bring items to the real world, then weapons should be included too. Why don\u2019t I have my double handed axe?As soon as that thought came to his head, something magical happened \u2013A white light flashed and he felt something heavy in his hand. The huge and dangerous double handed axe that Barbarian Fei had appeared in his hands.Fei swung the axe subconsciously.The axe\u2019s handle was cold, and so was the light that the axe blade reflected.A familiar sensation filled Fei\u2019s mind. He felt like the axe was an extension of his body and he had complete control of it; he felt invincible.Fei didn\u2019t get addicted to that feeling. He forced himself to calm and evaluate his situation.\u201cIf my main weapon was brought out of the Diablo World, then I can probably use \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 and \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 too.A yellow light flashed in front of him as he thought about that; the axe disappeared, and a gold engraved sword and a dark red shield took its place.\u201cWahahahahaha\u2026\u2026Just like I thought!\u201dFei found it super easy to switch his weapons. As long as he thought about it, the weapons would switch. There was no cooldown on that.\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh \u2013 !\u201dAs Fei\u2019s thoughts quickly changed, the double handed axe and the sword and shield kept on switching in his hands. This speed and method of switching weapons in a fight would definitely be a trump card. The best would be for him to use it as a sneak attack. This fit Fei\u2019s personality perfectly.Fei played around with this new skill, and he suddenly thought about a big problem.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s great to bring the powerful and magical items into the real world, I won\u2019t wear these all the time\u2026\u2026I\u2019m a king, I\u2019m not going to battle every single day. If I go to noble parties, go to the washroom and go to bed like this, I will probably be called a pervert\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI wonder if I would hide these items\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Fei was thinking, changes occurred again \u2013The barbarian items he was wearing disappeared as he wished. A soft white knight armour appeared on his body; it was the clothes he was wearing inside the heavy metal armour. However, he didn\u2019t know where the heavy metal armour went. He glanced around and found it at a corner. He didn\u2019t know how or when that armour was taken off his body.\u201cDamn, I can get anything I want?\u201dA big smile came on Fei\u2019s face.\u201cSo the weapons and armour of the Barbarian can appear and disappear as I wish. This is so convenient\u2026 It\u2019s not going to affect my normal life at all. This is too sick!\u201dFei\u2019s heart started to race again. Adrenaline coursed through his blood.He licked his lips. As a man that likely maximizing his benefit all the time, he thought of another question \u2013\u201cIf these magical items are brought to the real world, I can probably use their special properties too, right?\u201dFei was so excited that he almost had a boner. He decided to do a little experiment to test the storage effect of his belt.In the Diablo World, belts granted characters more storage space on top of the \u3010Item Slot\u3011, and it was more convenient to use than the \u3010Item Slot\u3011. The better quality the belt, the more storage space it had. The belt that Fei had only had 8 storage space.He looked down at the belt, then looked at a fist sized rock on the corner. He called on the rock in his mind, trying to put it into the storage space in the belt.Almost at the same exact moment as Fei thought about it in his mind, the rock disappeared.\u201cDamn! Did it work?\u201dFei\u2019s heart skipped a beat after he saw the rock disappear. Fei felt his heart wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the series of surprises. His greedy hypotheses was confirmed without any doubt.The special properties of the items in Diable were brought into the real world.Fei thought about the storage space in the belt and the 8 units of storage space appeared in front of his eyes, as if he was using a pair of Google Glasses. The rock was sitting in one of the storage spaces. Except for the rock, the 2 bottles of \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011 and 1 bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 that costed Fei 29,000 gold coins to convert was inside the belt as well.Fei quickly pressed his hands on his heart. \u201cIt has to stop beating so fast and irregularly, or I\u2019m seriously going to fucking die!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: The Four PowersAs if he was a kid that just got his favorite toy, Fei couldn\u2019t hold himself back as he played around with the belt a bit more.\u201cWhoosh-\u201dThe rock appeared in his hand.\u201cWhoosh-\u201dThe rock disappeared into the belt storage. He controlled everything with his mind, as if the belt was hooked up to his brain. He tried again with some different sized rocks on the ground inside the partially ruined tower.Fei quickly tested out the capacity of the storage space \u2013 Each slot in the storage space could only contain items up to the size of a basketball, but the weight of the items didn\u2019t matter.Therefore, the 8 storage space slots in the belt could hold items up to the size of 8 basketballs. Fei was very satisfied with the capacity. As the level of his Barbarian increased, Fei would be able to get higher quality belts, which would only increase the amount of slots they had.\u201cFinally! I have my own secret storage!\u201dThis unexpected surprise really delighted Fei. These surprises made Fei realize that there were way more secrets and discoveries to be made in the Diablo World that somehow resided inside his mind.\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 was only a novice map. As he leveled his character, he would be able to step into higher level maps such as \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 and \u3010Kurast Docks\u3011. He felt there were a ton of unimaginable things waiting for him.After he felt the monstrous strength of the Barbarian, he said \u201cswitch mode\u201d in his mind and Sorcerer Fei took over. His enormous physical strength disappeared instantly, and Fei felt the magic powers and spell casting abilities of a level 3 Sorcerer.Although Sorcerers and Necromancers were both mages, their powers were completely different. The Necromancer\u2019s power was dark, cold and daunting, while the Sorcerer\u2019s power was bright and just; fire, ice and lightning were all natural forces. After Fei switched to Sorcerer mode, a firm force field surrounded him. It was just as ominous as the Necromancer\u2019s force field, but had different affinities.\u201cSizzle, sizzle-\u201dA fireball appeared and hovered in his hands as Fei said \u201cFire Bolt!\u201d in his mind. The bright red fireball was dancing in the wind and its size changed as Fei wished. Although it looked weak, Fei was sure that this fireball contained a significant amount of energy; it was far more powerful than Gill\u2019s novice fireball. It could completely melt metal armour.That was the power of Sorcerer Fei. After he closed his eyes to get used to the power of the Sorcerer, he made the force field that surrounded him disappear, and no one could tell he was a mage by looking at him anymore.Fei then switched to Paladin Mode. Suddenly, a divine and gentle power filled Fei\u2019s body. The power was strong to the point that it leaked out of his body. The energy was so bright and compassionate that it would make anyone who felt this energy come closer and trust and depend on Fei unconditionally, as if he was the God\u2019s messenger.Paladins were the most noble and righteous class in the Diablo World. Paladins\u2019 most powerful skills were called Aura. Except for its combat abilities, it also had unimaginable healing and supporting abilities.\u201cIs the power of the Holy Church that Angela talked about the same as the Paladin\u2019s from Diablo World?\u201d Fei wondered.While he was thinking, his body quickly got used to the Auras of the Paladin.He stood there and repeated all the abilities and skills of the four characters. After he was sure that he wouldn\u2019t forget anything, he switched back to Barbarian Mode, wore his soft white knight armour instead of his Barbarian items and walked out of the watchtower.His reappearance was like a bright torch in complete darkness, and it drew the attention of everyone on the defensive wall.The soldiers stared at him in awe. They all hoped that the powerful king who could communicate with the God of War could create a miracle again in such a dangerous situation and defeat the vicious enemies who were about to siege the castle. They wanted him to give them hope for survival.However, three star warrior Lampard, one star warrior Oleg, Brook, novice mage Gill and a couple other people stared at Fei in fright and shock. Only those who had energy and powers themselves truly understood what had happened in the partially ruined watchtower.In a short moment, a gloomy power, a wild power, a natural power and a divine power\u2026. Four different types of powers appeared consecutively inside the watchtower, as if there were four one star warriors and mages hiding in there, fully displaying their power.But it was impossible! They all knew that only one person was in that watchtower \u2013 the young King Alexander.There was no else except him.This meant that there was only one possible explanation for what happened \u2013 all of the four different powers belonged to the King.\u201cOh God! Can one man acquire four different types of power? Moreover, each power is least at the one star level? This isn\u2019t possible!!\u201dIn the history of Azeroth Continent, there were examples of a person becoming proficient in a couple power different powers. It wasn\u2019t impossible\u2026\u2026but which one of those people weren\u2019t famous geniuses in order to be able to make progress in learning different powers? Which one of them weren\u2019t sun ranked masters?Moreover, all the travelling poets who told stories of them around the continent could swear with their lives that those geniuses were far from young when they made progress.\u201cHow old was Alexander?Not even 18 yet.Alexander was only famous because he was a retard. This retard wasted 17 years of his life, eating, sleeping and seeking fun. He never had any form of warrior or mage training. How could he possibly have 4 different types of powers? And all these power were at least one star rank?\u201dThese feelings were circulating in Lampard and the others\u2019 minds. They stared at Fei as he walked out of the tower as if he was Godzilla.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: We Need to Initiate the AttackFei knew he was the center of attention. He smiled gently at the anxious soldiers and new recruits, calming them down. He beckoned to Pierce and Brook, calling them over to the watchtower. He didn\u2019t acknowledge Oleg who was trying get his attention, and Head Minister Bazzer who wasn\u2019t too far away either.It was a rather clear signal; even the farmers who knew nothing about politics understood that the two former powerful figures, Bazzer and Oleg had lost the king\u2019s appreciation and trust.\u201cBrook, tell me about the enemies\u2019 movements.\u201d Fei asked as he looked at the crowd of enemies on the bridge. He stood beside a battlement and touched the marks left there by the swords and lances.\u201cYou majesty, during the past four hours that you were resting, the enemies didn\u2019t move at all for some reason\u2026\u2026 they didn\u2019t even harass us with any fake attacks. It\u2019s almost as if they are waiting for something, but\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook pointed behind the enemies. His voice was filled with worry, \u201cThey have moved their last three siege ladders and sieging equipment that they made in the last couple days onto the bridge. They are fully prepared, and there are even more enemy soldier participating in this siege compared to the previous battle. Once they decide to attack, we will be in an extremely dangerous situation.\u201dFei looked at the place that Brook was pointing at. There were some major changes in the enemy formation \u2013The tower shield formation was still at the very front, protecting all the enemies behind it using a huge black wall. It was only steps away from the north bank of the Zuli River, where Chambord Castle was located.However, the formations behind it were very different \u2013The archers, spearmen and swordsmen formations had moved back, and in their place were the three siege ladders which the enemies had moved onto the bridge. Behind the siege ladders, there were four or five giant wooden walls made out of wet, green trees to block off arrows. Even further away, there were six seventy feet (20m) tall trebuchets that were protected by the stronger enemy warriors\u2026\u2026Fei\u2019s pupils quickly contracted when he saw that. The six trebuchets were lethal siege machines. They were much more threatening than the siege ladders. Once they got within 200 yards (m) of the defensive wall, regardless of how firm and strong the defensive wall was, it would be blown apart. The defensive wall of Chambord and the less than one thousand soldier army would be wiped out in less than twenty boulder throws by the trebuchets.The enemy\u2019s commander had definitely put a lot of resources into this siege, so he wanted to conquer Chambord Castle today.\u201cThose wooden walls were made in a rush, and there are still green leaves on the wood. However, the six trebuchets couldn\u2019t have been made quickly, but they\u2019ve never appeared in the sieges before\u2026\u2026 Did the enemies get some reinforcements?\u201dFei licked his lip subconsciously as he thought about that.There was no way that Chambord could defend against that. Once the enemies began their siege, the wooden walls could easily block the rain of arrows and get the trebuchets into range. Chambord seemed to be doomed. This was an unequal warfare.Aside from the huge gap in the strength between the enemies and them, the enemy\u2019s commander was also very careful and sneaky. He knew that Chambord didn\u2019t have too many soldiers, so he focused on that weakness. Brook and the others couldn\u2019t come up with any strategies that could break open the \u2018cage\u2019 that Chambord was in.Fei frowned as he evaluated the situation. Brook was observing Fei\u2019s expression. He was about to say something, but he held himself back.\u201cSay what you want to say. As the future general commander of Chambord, hesitating doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Fei noticed Brook\u2019s behaviour and joked.Brook got really close to Fei and whispered into his ears, \u201cYour majesty\u2026\u2026maybe\u2026\u2026We can\u2019t defend this one. I\u2019m willing to stay behind with the soldiers to try to defend against the enemies and buy more time. Please let Mr. Lampard and Pierce take a team of elite soldiers to protect you and Ms. Angela to leave Chambord from the back mountain\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dFei shook his head and rejected Brook\u2019s suggestion before he even finished. He didn\u2019t say a single word more, but just from his rejection and him shaking his head, Brook and Pierce felt the young king\u2019s determination. No matter what was going to happen, the king wouldn\u2019t back down nor flinch. Fei\u2019s expression excited and pleased the two, but it also made them really anxious.\u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer; we need to initiate an attack.\u201d Fei said as he tapped the battlement with his finger.This sentence was as shocking as thunder, and \u2018exploded\u2019 in their ears.\u201cInitiate an attack?\u201dBrook and Pierce were stunned. What did initiating an attack under such circumstances, with so few soldiers, most with no formal training mean? It meant that Fei was giving up on the terrain advantage and planning to attack the enemies, like smashing a hard rock with an apple pie\u2026\u2026The fate of the apple pie could easily be determined.\u201cYour majesty, is\u2026\u2026won\u2019t that be too risky?\u201d Brook was trying to get Fei to change his mind.\u201cThere is no time.\u201d Fei shook his head as he said decisively. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, the enemies will attack right after lunch\u2026\u2026The only way for us to survive in this war is to think of the unimaginable and do the unexpected. If we wait any longer, the enemies will begin the siege, and the only thing we will face is death.\u201dFei slowly looked at the two as he said that.Looking at the confused expressions of the two warriors, Fei said, \u201cWhat do you think, my warriors? Do you guys have the courage to go with me and send all those bastards into the Zuli River so they can take the last bath of their lives?\u201dThe question was as simple as asking for his friends\u2019 opinions.At that very moment, Brook and Pierce felt like the blood in their bodies was on fire.\u201cYour majesty, it\u2019s our honour!\u201d Their voices trembled as they responded.\u201cAlright, I need you guys to do something\u2026\u2026Brook, go and tell all the soldiers to rest. Remember, only keep a couple smart ones to watch the enemies\u2019 actions\u2026\u2026 Also, go find twenty reliable and loyal strong men and bring them to me. Pierce, you go and get these for me\u2026\u2026\u201dFei whispered into Pierce\u2019s ear, and the white haired tough guy left in confusion. After they left, Fei stood quietly on the defensive wall. He repeated and organized all the things that he needed to pay attention to in upcoming operation in his mind, and then turned around and walked to his left.He walked to the number one warrior of Chambord, under the gazes of all the soldiers.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Lampard nodded.The number one warrior who was normally cold to Fei had finally lowered his guard and proactively talked to him.Fei knew that his series of heroic feats had gained the trust and respect of this \u2018master\u2019. Lampard had protected the peace of Chambord and stabilized the retarded Alexander\u2019s throne by his individual strength; Fei was very grateful for that. Fei also heard that Lampard was the closest friend of the old king, so he Fei\u2019s elder as well.\u201cUncle Lampard, I have something that requires your assistance.\u201d Fei was very polite.Lampard looked at Fei, and then turned around to look at the black flood of enemies. He was silent for a couple second, but then asked, \u201cYou want me to help you destroy those trebuchets, right? I only have about thirty to forty percent confidence in destroying two or three of them\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDestroy the trebuchets?\u201dFei was surprised, but he quickly understood what Lampard was thinking. He shook his head and said seriously, \u201cUncle Lampard, that\u2019s not what I am asking\u2026\u2026Eh, it\u2019s like this. I\u2019m going to leave the castle and attack the enemies soon, so I want you to stay on the defensive wall and stabilize the situation here. If I end up dying, I want you to take care of Angela for me. Please protect her and Emma and leave Chambord safely.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Super Strong Men\u201cEh?\u201dLampard didn\u2019t expect Alexander to have such a request. In such a dangerous situation, the first thing that came to Fei\u2019s mind was not his own safety, but the safety of Angela and Emma. This raised his image of Alexander by a couple points.However, it was only a couple points because of Fei\u2019s decision to leave the castle and initiate the attack, which lowered his image.Even the dumbest person in Chambord could tell that initiating an attack would be worst decision ever. It would only get the precious soldiers of Chambord killed for no returns. Moreover it would give the well-trained and equipped enemies an even bigger advantage.Lampard accepted the fact that Alexander was strong and brave looking back at the siege battle the day before, to a point where it was way beyond his estimations. However, when it came to warfare, if one didn\u2019t have the strength or power of a moon ranked master, individual strength wouldn\u2019t solve many problems. Lampard didn\u2019t want to see Alexander become arrogant after a couple wins.\u201cIf I use a sneak attack, maybe I can destroy those trebuchets, so\u2026\u2026you don\u2019t have to rush towards your death.\u201dFor the old friend whose soul was already in heaven and for the pure and innocent Angela, Lampard decided that even though his old hidden internal injuries had relapsed, he had to try to destroy those trebuchets. They were the biggest threat to Chambord. However, there was a huge risk\u2026\u2026The only hope he had was if the trebuchets weren\u2019t protected by high star ranked warriors or mages.\u201cUncle Lampard, it\u2019s not just the problem of a few trebuchets. In this situation, even if you could destroy all the trebuchets, Chambord won\u2019t hold long under the enemy attacks\u2026\u2026 Relax, a guy that is terrified of death like me won\u2019t do anything too risky.\u201dAfter Fei said that, his expression became serious and he got closer to Lampard. He whispered, \u201cBesides, you have to stay on the defensive wall. You are the only one that can restrain the hidden poisonous snake.\u201dLampard\u2019s expression suddenly changed.\u201cYou found out as well?\u201dA mysterious smile came onto Fei\u2019s face. He nodded slightly, \u201cEh, too bad I only discovered a few clues; I\u2019m not sure who it is exactly \u2026\u2026 But I feel like you\u2019re the only who can temporarily contain him.\u201dLampard nodded, but his expression tightened the next second. He glanced at Fei; a blue water-like energy suddenly appeared and covered his right arm. He didn\u2019t say anything and stepped up, and the energy that covered his arm grew even bigger. A punch that was as fast as lightning was aimed at Fei\u2019s chest.The mountain-like pressure exploded and pressed on everyone surrounding Lampard and Fei as the punch travelled towards Fei. No one would\u2019ve thought that the number one warrior of Chambord would attack King Alexander. Numerous gasps sounded on the defensive wall.However, it seemed like Fei was expecting it, and was not scared at all.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dFei threw a punch as well. There weren\u2019t any skills contained in the punch. It was pure physical strength. Although it didn\u2019t contain any energy, the fist had left a series of afterimages as it blew through the air.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe two fists collided with each other forcefully.Suddenly, an enormous energy wave exploded outward from the center of the collision. Like a strong cyclone, the nearby soldiers had to close their eyes to deal with the huge blast. Some of them even yelled as they were pushed back by the energy wave; they couldn\u2019t even hold on to their weapons.The blue water-like energy that covered Lampard\u2019s right arm was shattered and quickly disappeared. Lampard himself shook as he barely stood still.Fei was sent back three steps by the collision. His breathing was rapid; his right hand felt numb and his right arm was sore and in pain.\u201cNice!\u201d Lampard nodded. He was pleased as he looked at Fei. However, he was even more surprised and shocked. Fei\u2019s progress was almost too ridiculous for him to understand. The number one warrior finally agreed with Fei\u2019s decision. \u201cYou strength is enough to protect yourself down there. Okay, I will stay on the defensive wall, and you can initiate the attack\u2026\u2026But remember, if the situation gets too dangerous, don\u2019t be stubborn. Destroy a few trebuchets and come back with the soldiers. We just have to hold them off for a little bit longer. Zenit Empire will soon be notified and reinforcements will arrive.\u201d Lampard said with a complex expression on his face.This was the first time that Lampard had said this much to Alexander. Although he didn\u2019t say too much, Fei felt the care and concern that Lampard had for him.\u201cEh, trust me, I will know what to do.\u201dFei bowed to Lampard, then turned around and walked back to the watch tower.When Lampard attacked him, Fei knew that he was testing his strength. Lampard would only let him leave the castle if his strength was up to Lampard\u2019s standards.The test also verified Fei\u2019s prior predictions; a level 12 Barbarian could defeat a two star warrior, but would have a hard time battling against a three star warrior.When Lampard punched him, Fei tried to counter it with all the strength he had, but that only shattered the energy that covered Lampard\u2019s arm. Fei on the other hand was pushed back a couple steps and lost control of the battle.\u201cI have to improve my strength, fast!\u201d Fei decided. Once Chambord overcame this situation, he would go back to the Diablo World right away to level up his characters and increase his strength and power. The only way to survive and protect his close ones on this war-filled Azeroth Continent was to be powerful and have a strong influence.When Fei got back to the watchtower, Brook was waiting for him with twenty tough men.These guys were all about 7 feet tall (210cm) and half-naked, displaying their super muscular body that contained explosive powers. They were covered in dark body hair, which made them look like humanoid beasts from the wilderness.These were the strong men that Brook picked out.\u201cBoom, boom \u2013 !\u201dFei nodded and hammered the chest of a big guy who was standing beside him: \u201cWarrior, tell me your name.\u201d\u201cDrogba, your majesty. Dider Drogba!\u201d\u201cAlright, show me your strength, warrior Drogba.\u201d Fei asked while smiling.A humble smile appeared on Drogba\u2019s face as he heard that. He looked around and walked to the watchtower. He bent his back and held onto a square battlement that had a five yard (5m) width. His upper body muscles rose as he applied force and he picked it off of the ground firmly.Fei was delighted. The battlement was at least six, seven hundred pounds, but Drogba didn\u2019t have any trouble picking it up. It seemed like that was not his limit. Fei had to admit that the people on Azeroth Continent had much stronger bodies compared to people on Earth. This man called Drogba could easily win the Strong Man World Competition on Earth.\u201cGreat! Such an invincible warrior!\u201d Fei appraised Drogba as he laughed. He walked up to Drogba and single-handedly grabbed the battlement from Drogba. He applied some force to the battlement and it flew tens of yards (m) away. \u201cBoom!\u201d The battlement crushed into the ground and blew up a ton of dust.The ease Fei had when throwing the battlement had shocked the twenty strong men.Drogba was the strongest among them all, and he only pick up the battlement with two hands, yet King Alexander threw the battlement single-handedly as if it was a water battle. \u201cWhat kind of strength was that? Unthinkable!\u201dThe strong men were 100% conquered. They stared at Fei with excitement. That was what Fei wanted to see.In the Barbarian Mode, a level 12 Barbarian could exert about five thousand pounds of force. Limitless physical strength was the definition of a Barbarian. The only way to transform these strong, muscular men into loyal subordinates was to beat them at what they did best.\u201cYou guys are the strongest men in Chambord in terms of your physical strength, but I\u2019m not sure if your courage is as strong as your physical strength.\u201d Fei stimulated the strong men to pump up their morale.After Fei finished talking, all the men\u2019s eyes turned red from rage. Some of them pumped their chests and others cracked their joints; they couldn\u2019t wait to show what they are made of.\u201cHahaha. Great. I\u2019m going to leave the castle and teach those bastards a memorable lesson. How about that? Do you guys dare to go with me and make them run back to their mommies?\u201d Fei suddenly turned around and pointed at the enemies that were on the bridge, like a giant crawling snake.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019ve wanted to go and teach them a lesson for a long time now!\u201d The big guy Drogba yelled as he swung his fists.\u201cYour Majesty, I want to be the head soldier and charge at the very front.\u201d\u201cI can fuck them all up by myself, hahaha, how could I be scared of them?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve smashed twenty one skulls, and I don\u2019t mind smashing a couple more.\u201dAfter the strong men heard Fei\u2019s decision, none of them were scared, but rather excited. They couldn\u2019t wait to charge into the enemies.At this moment \u2013\u201cYour Majesty, what you need is ready.\u201dPierce yelled from far away. It attracted everyone\u2019s attention. There were about forty soldiers following Pierce. They sweated as they carried sets of astonishing ultra heavy knight armour up the defensive wall.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Let\u2019s go!The sets of heavy metal armour were quickly placed beside the watchtower. There were twenty two sets in total, and they looked like they were gifted from the hands of Aphrodite. They shined under the bright sunlight.These were the precious heavy knight armour sets that the old king had collected throughout his life. They were made from an extremely strong metal \u2013 hundred wrought iron mixed with \u2018steel essence\u2019. They looked magnificent, were very valuable and provided a ton of defensive capability; ordinary weapons couldn\u2019t break through it.The old king treated these armour sets as if they were national treasures, and he wasn\u2019t even willing to take them out of the King\u2019s Palace. He never used them and only occasionally wiped them down carefully. These sets of armour were as precious as his own life.However, Fei moved these national treasures onto the defensive wall today as if they were paper. After noticing what was going on, most of the people on the wall had no idea what King Alexander was going do. They chatted among themselves quietly as they stared at Fei\u2019s direction with curiosity and excitement.\u201cWhat do you think, my warriors? Are you guys able to wear the armour?\u201d Fei pointed at the twenty two shiny heavy knight armour and asked.\u201cNot a problem, Your Majesty!\u201d After seeing the armour, the strong men were extremely excited, as if they were rabbits that encountered a ton of carrots. The passion that the warriors had towards excellent weapons and armour never decreased.\u201cAlright, time is tight. Pick a fitting armour and put it on as fast as you can. We don\u2019t have a lot of time left!\u201dThese men were strong and straightforward. After Fei ordered, they didn\u2019t hesitate and quickly picked up the armour they wanted.\u201cPierce, pick one up too. Come with me later.\u201d\u201cAwesome!\u201d Pierce was thrilled. He laughed as he picked up a set of armour. Although the armour had a ton of defense, because they were made out of hundred wrought iron mixed with even heavier \u2018steel essence\u2019, every armour set weighed about sixty to seventy pounds. This was why Fei asked Brook to pick out the strongest men in Chambord. Because an ordinary person wouldn\u2019t even be able to walk properly after they put that on, killing enemies in that armour was literally a joke.These twenty some strong men were all the manpower that Fei needed for this attack.Although these men weren\u2019t star ranked warriors and didn\u2019t have any energy, they were super strong. After wearing the heavy armour that granted them sick defense, they would be like twenty hunger tigers that just got out of a cage. If they were utilized properly on that narrow bridge, they would be more powerful than the star ranked warrior on both sides.Fei didn\u2019t plan to attack the enemies with too many people from the start.He glanced at Brook. The Second Commander of the King\u2019s Guards was also a one star warrior, so he was a perfect candidate for this operation. However, there had to be a strategic commander on the defensive wall, just in case something unexpected happened and the situation on the defensive wall fell into chaos.Fei thought about it for a couple seconds, but ultimately decided to keep Brook on the defensive wall. He looked past Brook and saw Warden Oleg sitting at the gap on the defensive wall. He beckoned to him and signalled the \u2018Flatterer\u2019 to come close to him.\u201cGo and pick a set of armour.\u201d Fei didn\u2019t say or express anything more.Oleg was confused. He was pretty far from the watchtower, so he didn\u2019t know what was going on. He thought that the king was being really generous and was granting him a set of armour to protect himself in the upcoming siege. A bright smile came onto Oleg\u2019s face as he rushed to the last set of armour that was sitting on the ground and put it on really fast.Quickly, some soldiers carried ultra-big weapons onto the defensive wall.These huge heavy weapons were from the King\u2019s Palace as well; they were also part of the old king\u2019s precious collection. However, Fei took them out at the perfect time and utilized all their values.\u201cBam, bam!\u201dTwenty one weapons were dropped onto the ground; there were axes and hammers, all of which looked monstrous. They gave off a dark feeling, and anyone who looked at them would become depressed. When they touched the ground, they smashed into the brick flooring on the defensive wall, cracking the flooring and forming many pits. They were really heavy.\u201cEveryone, get a comfortable weapon.\u201dAfter they heard the King\u2019s order, they rushed to grab the weapons that they wanted. Pierce got a pair of exotic looking warhammers, and Drogba picked a huge long axe; the axe blade was almost as long as a door. It would make anyone who looked at it feel a chill to their bones.Warden Oleg finally felt that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t right. However, after seeing the King\u2019s serious face, he didn\u2019t dare ask any questions. He used his one star energy to pick up a long blade that was taller than himself and stood quietly beside Fei.After seeing there was no more sets of armour and weapons for him, Brook panicked, \u201cYour Majesty, I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStay on the defensive wall. Hold Chambord together for me until I return.\u201d Fei pressed Brook\u2019s shoulder and said seriously, \u201cYou are the only one that I trust in here.\u201dBrook\u2019s body froze; he was stunned by Fei\u2019s words.Fei didn\u2019t say anything more. He grabbed forty six water bags filled with clean water by the soldiers under his instruction and walked into the watchtower to hide from everyone\u2019s sight.After he was inside the building, he grab the bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 and the bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 from his belt storage, and dripped a couple drops of each potions individually into twenty three water bags. He shook the bags to mix the water and potions together and called in the twenty heavy metal armoured [Iron Men]. Each of them got two bags.\u201cThe God of War showed his mercy and blessed us. The water in the blue bag will get rid of your tiredness and the water in the red bag will heal any types of injures\u2026\u2026When we get to the enemy formations, make sure to protect yourselves properly. When you get injured or become tired, drink the water right away.Pierce and the others were delighted after they heard that.Although they had a lot of physical strength, after wearing sixty to seventy pounds of armour and using forty to fifty pounds weapons, any man would feel tired eventually. However, the two bags of magic water from King Alexander had solved all their concerns.The Warden Oleg had finally understood why the King let him get a set of the valuable armour. He face turned pale, sweat came off of his body like rain, and his mind turned completely blank. He stuttered, \u201cYo\u2026.You\u2026Your Ma\u2026..Majes\u2026\u2026jesty, I\u2026\u2026.I\u2026\u2026\u201dFei stared at him coldly.Oleg\u2019s heart stopped pounding for a second. He sweat even more, but didn\u2019t dare to say a word.\u201cEveryone take a mouthful of the water in the blue water bag. Get ready to battle.\u201dFei put on the heavy knight armour that he had before he entered Diablo World as he said to the strong men.\u201cGulp, gulp-\u201dPierce and others chugged down some water in the blue water bag. As soon as the water entered their mouth, gasps filled the room. A shocking expression covered everyone\u2019s face.They all clearly felt that a special kind of power seeped through every part of their bodies, and they were suddenly filled with power.The weight of the armour disappeared, and they all felt like they were wearing a thin shirt. Not only could they run, but they could jump into the air easily. The forty to fifty pound weapons suddenly felt like straw, as if they weren\u2019t holding anything.Everything felt like a beautiful illusion. But from their buddies\u2019 shocked expressions, they finally confirmed that their feelings weren\u2019t illusions, but actual magical effects like mages\u2019 weightless spells.It was a miracle.\u201cWhen we get to the bottom of the defensive wall, everyone listen to my order. If anyone disobeys, they shall be executed on the spot\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei stared at the warrior that he picked out. He raised up his huge double-handed axe and grabbed it with his right hand. With the axe in his right hand and helmet under his left armpit, he left the watchtower first.\u201cMove out!\u201dThe team of warriors left the watchtower valiantly.Some soldiers had followed Fei\u2019s instructions and prepared twenty thick ropes and hung them off of the defensive wall. Pierce was at the very front; he put the helmet on his head and waved his hammer to the surrounding soldiers as a goodbye. The operation was really risky and no one knew if they would make it back alive. Pierce didn\u2019t mind, and laughed as he held onto the rope and jumped off of the wall\u2026\u2026The diluted \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 had pumped the endurance of Pierce to another level. Although he was wearing a set of heavy armour, he was still very fast and flexible, like a wild ape. He slid down to the bottom of the defensive wall.\u201cBoom!\u201dPierce landed on the ground and left a deep footprint into the ground.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dLike twenty iron robots, the other strong men shook the ground as well as they landed by sliding down the rope. They quickly organized themselves into a \u2018V\u2019 shape formation, with Pierce standing at the very front.Fei was still on the defensive wall. As he put on the helmet and was about to slide down the rope, he heard to a cry from far away.\u201cAlexander, don\u2019t go\u2026\u2026\u201dA beautiful girl rushed up the stairs of the defensive wall as she held up the edges of her dress and tried not to fall. She yelled in her cries, trying to stop Alexander from leaving the castle and put himself in danger. Fei could even see the panicked expression on her pretty face\u2026\u2026\u201cAngela\u2026\u2026\u201dFei stared at her for a couple seconds. But to Fei, it felt like eternity; he had engraved Angela\u2019s appearance into his mind. He didn\u2019t say anything back; he put on the helmet and held tightly to the rope. He looked at Angela who was running towards him passionately from the eyeholes on the faceplate one last time as he turned around and jumped off of the wall.When the operation initiated, it needed to be executed accurately and fast. A second of delay meant that the enemies would discover them a second earlier. That might put the warriors in a terrible situation.Fei didn\u2019t have time to talk to Angela, not even one second.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: The Horrifying Strike\u201cAlexander\u2026\u2026\u201dTears rolled down Angela\u2019s face as she finally got onto the defensive wall and saw Fei jump off.Fei\u2019s bright eyes under his faceplate as he looked back and the way he turned around made a mark on her heart; she wouldn\u2019t be able to forget that this moment in her life.\u201cAlexander\u2026\u2026You have to come back\u2026\u2026You will be a great king and Chambord will be proud of you, and you will be\u2026\u2026a legend on Azeroth Continent\u2026\u2026I will wait for that day!\u201dAs if she had lost her soul, Angela leaned against a battlement on the defensive wall so she wouldn\u2019t fall down.She stared at the man who slid down the defensive wall, joined the strong men, reassembled the formation and led the attack on the crawling snake-like enemy. Her ocean-like eyes didn\u2019t even blink once; she stared at Fei firmly.\u201cCome back alive!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026On the south bank of Zuli River.The autumn wind blew off the yellow leaves on the trees. A furry squirrel was standing on its feet in alert and looking around. It relaxed as it saw that the surrounding was clear and started nibbling a pine cone happily. Birds flew freely to the blue sky far away.It was a magnificent sceneof Autumn.But, suddenly \u2013\u201cClip-clop, clip-clop!\u201dIt was the sound of hooves rapidly tapping the ground. It was noisy and the ground was shaking. The squirrel threw the half cracked pine cone and crawled up a tree in a panic, and the birds were scared away.High pitched horse whinnies came from far away.After the chaos settled down, the silver masked knight and his black knights showed up on the south bank of Zuili River.The silver masked knight looked up to the sky to roughly check the time, and took out an \u2018Eagle Eye\u2019 to observe the status of the soldiers on the defensive wall of Chambord. The \u2018Eagle Eye\u2019 was a delicate magical item; it was like a smaller telescope, but the two crystal lenses in it had been blessed with the eagle eye spell, which allowed the user to see far away. Even the antenna of an ant could be seen clearly from miles away.Through the \u2018Eagle Eye\u2019, he saw the deformed faces of the soldiers due to their fatigue and dread. They lacked proper defenses, and the soldiers were taking off their armor lazily, which messed up the defensive positioning\u2026\u2026Everything was going as he had expected. A sneer came on his face.\u201cPass down my command, everyone get ready to\u2026\u2026\u201dHe suddenly stopped; he didn\u2019t have a chance to say the word \u2018siege\u2019. While viewing the defensive wall through his \u2018Eagle Eye\u2019, he saw twenty or so buff guys with heavy armour sliding down the defensive wall with ropes.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d The silver masked knight was surprised for a moment.But after he saw the fully armour enemies assembling into a standard wedge charging formation, he understood their intents completely. After a brief moment of startle, a disdain and banter expression came on his face. He was even a little bit dumbfounded: \u201cHaha, King of Chambord, it looks like I overestimated you. What a dumbass! Good thinking, but do you think you could break my formations with only twenty-ish men?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s like that, let\u2019s have an appetizer before the main siege.\u201d The silver masked knight laughed. He pointed his horsewhip at the \u2018dumb\u2019 enemies and said, \u201c[Two], [Three], Adjust the Tower Shield formation into a defense position. Let those statue-like heavy asses come closer. Chop their heads off within ten seconds!\u201d\u201cMoo -!\u201dA loud trumpet filled the sky, and the breathtaking silence that enveloped the people of Chambord had finally been broken.The trumpet was the military command. The formations were like precise machines and started transforming right away.\u201cTap, tap, tap, tap!\u201dThe formation transformed in the daunting uniformed stepping noise. The Tower Shield formation that was closest to Chambord didn\u2019t move too much. The sides moved forward a bit and the middle moved back a bit into a concave defense position.\u201cTink, tink, tink -!\u201dThe sound of heavy metal grinding on each other came from the formation. On top of the 3 yard high Tower Shields, 5 yard long iron dragon lances extended out. Under the bright sun, the shiny, dense lances looked like the teeth of the sneering Grim Reaper. The lances all pointed forward and the enemies in the formation were silent; the whole formation was like a huge mad steel hedgehog. If an elephant charged at the formation, it would be plunged into kebabs.On the other side, the twenty-ish fully armoured soldiers charged as if they weren\u2019t afraid of death.It was a disproportional battle.Glancing from the sky, it looked like a couple ants were boldly provoking an elephant. The ants would easily be squished into meat paste if the elephant stomped its foot.The taste of death from the lances had darkened the bright sun.No one questioned the effectiveness of the lances in terms of penetrating any type of armour. Even iron plates that were 2 inch (5cm) thick would be easily torn open by these pointed lances that had 4 inch (10 cm) handles supporting them.However, the \u2018V\u2019 shaped wedge formation \u2018ant\u2019 charge didn\u2019t slow down at all. They sped up as if they wanted to break the lethal lances with their bodies.No one made a noise. The air also froze. Everyone could hear their own heartbeat.On the defensive wall, everyone couldn\u2019t help but lean their bodies forward against the battlements to try to see everything clearly. Angela\u2019s eyes were filled with tears and worry; her hands grabbed onto the edges of her dress tightly and almost tore through it. Emma followed Angela onto the defensive wall as well, and she held her arms in front of her chest and held her breath.On the other side of the Zuli River, the silver masked knight had already put away the \u2018Eagle Eye\u2019. He was still sneering as he stared at the presumptuous \u2018ants\u2019.\u201cHow dare a dog challenge the honour of a dragon?\u201dCruel expressions appeared on the dozen black knights\u2019 faces who were standing behind the silvered masked knight. Like hungry wolves that had spotted a delicious treat in the dark night, they licked their mouths while sneering.Near the bridge.The distance between the \u2018ants\u2019 and the \u2018iron hedgehog\u2019 was decreasing fast.20 yards (m)\u2026\u202616 yards (m)\u2026\u202613 yards (m)\u2026\u202610 yards (m)\u2026\u2026The silver masked knight sat up a little higher on the horse. The arc of his smile grew larger and larger, as if he was envisioning the spurting blood and devastating screams of the opponents.The ending was that simple in his eyes \u2013 the concave Tower Shield formation only needed to close and surround the enemies in the middle, just like stuffing a dumpling. These dumb heavy metal armoured opponents would be \u2018kebabed\u2019 by the lances after a couple easy thrusts and pulls.He wasn\u2019t worried at all about the \u2018ants\u2019 messing up the tower shield formation.There were three layers of tower shields which were each 3 yards (m) tall. Each shield weighed more than 100 pounds (50 kg), and they were supported by elite soldiers and numerous additional iron rods. With this kind of defensive formation, it would hold the front charges of heavy cavalry for more than 10 minutes.The silver masked knight didn\u2019t hide his mocking smile at all.However, he froze the next second, as if he was struck by invisible lightning. His body stiffened and his eyeballs almost fell out of his eye sockets.Gasps came from the black knights behind him.The military horses they were riding that normally marched uniformly, even under severe injuries began whinnying and backing off uncontrollably\u2026\u2026Because two to three seconds ago, a thunder like roar came from the other side of the stone bridge \u2013\u201cGod bless!\u201dThe \u2018head ant\u2019 who was leading the \u2018V\u2019 charge threw his huge black axe forward forcefully after his roar.\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh -!\u201dThe axe turned into a grey shadow and spun insanely, tearing up the air and even the space around it.\u201cBoom!\u201dMany screamed could be heard and blood spurted to the sky and fell back down like a \u2018blood rain\u2019. The huge black axe smashed into the refined iron tower shields.Like a sharp knife that was cutting through a piece of well-done steak, and like a God\u2019s fist that came down from the sky and crushed a tree, the tower shields that could block heavy cavalry deformed a little in the metal collision. However, after a brief moment of pause, the power that the axe was carrying exploded and more than ten huge shields were blown away, like dried leaves in a blizzard.Unstoppable!Absolutely unstoppable!The huge axe didn\u2019t feel like an axe, but rather a punishment from the enraged God of War. With the unstoppable momentum and devastating power, it would crush even the most majestic mountain Tangolian if it was here.The axe had blown a 2 yard wide bloody gap on the Tower Shield formation that was as tight as a wall. Broken limbs and blood fell from the sky and \u2018decorated\u2019 the other shields. The formation went into chaos.The elite soldiers behind the shields didn\u2019t expect that anyone in the world could break their defense like that, not even in their wildest dreams. The cruel reality took them by surprise; it was so astonishing that they forgot about the proper actions of a soldier and their harsh discipline. This let their opponents break into their formation through the gap filled with blood.They were previously mocking the twenty-ish dumb pigs who were charging at them in their minds, but after the blink of an eye, the dumb pigs had ripped off their weak disguises and stepped into the formation like overbearing demons. Their weapons were like the sickles, while they were the representatives of the Grim Reaper himself. Everywhere they went, blood spurted and deathly screams were heard. The front layer of soldiers lost their shields\u2019 protection and fell like crops under the \u2018sickles\u2019; no one could last for more than a second.The battle between the ants and the elephant turned into a one-sided slaughter of the elephants.The roles of the two sides were inconceivably reversed in that second.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Blood RainsThe gasps of the soldiers, the screams of the wounded, the yelling of the officers, the colliding and breaking sound of metal\u2026\u2026 these sounds that would normally cause a chill to people\u2019s bones joined together under the defensive wall and formed a deathly symphony.A round of cheers came from the defensive wall; it was too difficult to contain.All their fears and worries turned into loud cheers.The godlike axe strike hit the tower shield-dragon lance formation, but it also hit the heart of everyone on the wall. It was like a torch fire in the darkness; it gave them hope and ignited their blood and souls.On the defensive wall, everyone knew who that axe belonged to. Everyone knew whose face was under that helmet, because everyone had watched the young and brave king slide down the defensive wall and stand at the very front of the other men. His back faced his followers as he faced the cruelest enemies.Everyone on the wall was crying. They screamed, jumped and threw their arms into the air wildly, as if they could empower the brave men who charged into the enemies and fought alongside their king.On the other side of the Zuli River.The silver masked knight was feeling gloomy. His attitude of watching a good show with confidence disappeared. His expression was like that of finding out that he had bit on a hard rock and chipped his teeth after biting into a piece of delicious flesh.After that axe was thrown, his heart beat faster and he knew something was wrong.The tower shield formation that he was proud of didn\u2019t even hold for one second, and was smashed open by the enemies. Their ease in charging into the formation was a huge slap to his face.The devastating power that the axe carried made him feel threatened for the first time. This shouldn\u2019t have been the power of any man. There wasn\u2019t any surge of energy, so what kind of power was that?\u201cBlack knights, pass down my command, abandon the chaotic front formation and transform to [Lock Formation]; make sure to envelop those guys. Put up the dragon lances and keep some distance, don\u2019t fight them recklessly\u2026\u2026\u201dThe silver masked knight calmed himself down quickly and displayed proper adaptation abilities and executed another plan.His eyes weren\u2019t fooled. He could tell that the \u2018death squad\u2019 of twenty-ish weren\u2019t star warriors, but simply ordinary men who had a ton of physical strength. When the battle went on, they would tire out eventually and it would be easy to kill them.However, the silver masked knight didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. Although he was trained to be calm during any situation and was taught many techniques to command armies and read people\u2019s minds, after consecutive losses in battle against ant-like enemies, he felt ashamed. He decided not to wait any longer and crush the enemies with the most powerful method he had and conquer Chambord Castle at once.After he thought about it for a while, he spoke coldly while biting his teeth, \u201cTell the three star warrior Landes to stop protecting the trebuchets and join forces with the rest of the tower shield soldiers to eliminate those bastards right away\u2026\u2026Get the rest of the army prepared; start sieging right after that!\u201dAfter the silver masked knight thought about the two commands and made sure that they covered everything, he waved his horsewhip and the black knights rushed to pass on the commands.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026On the bridge, the battle was still continuing.By using the monstrous strength of the level 12 Barbarian, Fei smashed open a way into the formation. The twenty two strongmen followed him tightly; together, they were like a matchless blade that pierced the enemy\u2019s heart.The Tower Shield formation had a great amount of frontal defense; even charging cavalry couldn\u2019t break through them easily. However, the soldiers behind the shields only wore thin leather armour; once the enemies break through, without the protection of the huge iron shields, they would be like pigs in a slaughter house.Pierce and Drogba were right behind Fei. Both of them were the strongest men in Chambord; the war hammer and axe were slamming and crashing into the enemies with a huge amount of force. The tower shield enemies were killed when the weapons hit them and wounded when the weapons touched them; there was nothing that could stop them.On the thin bridge, red blood decorated everything. Wherever the \u2018death squad\u2019 went turned to chaos.Due to the terrain restrictions, although there were more enemies, they weren\u2019t able to surround Fei and the strongmen properly. The width of the bridge could only hold about fifteen men, so their numbers advantage couldn\u2019t be utilized and they had the disadvantage.In the chaos, an enemy officer who was nearing a one star warrior saw that the man who gave the Tower shield formation a deadly blow didn\u2019t have a weapon anymore. He was extremely excited; he thought the Goddess of Luck had blessed him. He picked up a half broken dragon lance and sneakily used the scarce energy he had to thrust it at Fei when he thought Fei\u2019s guard was down.Although the lance was half broken, it weighed about fifty to sixty pounds. With a ton of momentum and energy of an almost one star warrior, the tip of the lance shined like a bloodthirsty light; it was aimed at Fei\u2019s heart.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dThe enemy officer laughed as if he already saw the opponent\u2019s blood shoot out of his chest as his heart was pierced. Without a doubt, if he could kill a man who was so strong, it would be a great military honor and he would soon be promoted to higher ranks.But \u2013The officer\u2019s smile froze on his face.It soon turned into a deformed pale face that was experiencing a ton of pain and fear.The weaponless man didn\u2019t panic at all after seeing sneak attack. Instead, a cunning and gloating smile could be seen under the man\u2019s faceplate. He reached his hands into the air; after a flash of white light, like magic, another huge axe appeared in his hand out of nowhere!\u201d\u201cTink!\u201dA frontal chop.The axe accurately chopped the tip of the lance. After the sparks from the colliding metals faded, the axe\u2019s blade turned into a white thin line in the officer\u2019s eyes. Like a sharp knife cutting through a soft milk cake, the axe separated the iron lance in half. With the remaining momentum, the axe also went through his body\u2026\u2026-He felt cold\u2026\u2026The dragon lance, the officer\u2026\u2026The axe went through both of them easily. After a brief pause, they both separated into two pieces each.There was no way that the blood could stop.The man\u2019s bright red internal organs, his limbs covering his white bones, and the heated dragon lance fell everywhere.The blood in the air touched the broken lances, which were still heated due to the high friction from the collision. It turned into a cloud of bloody steam. More blood spilled onto the lance, and the steam generated almost filled the surroundings of the corpse. The air was completely red and smelt horrible.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Massacre Continued\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\u2026\u2026\u201dA couple soldiers who were standing beside the officer were terrified. Their minds couldn\u2019t take it and broke down. As if they had lost their souls, they screamed and tried to escape from the \u201cdemons\u201d in front of them. Unfortunately for them, there were layers of Tower Shields and Dragon Lances positioned behind them. When they turned around to escape, they were forced into them by their own comrades behind them, making them into \u201ckebabs\u201d. However, the severe injuries didn\u2019t kill them instantly, they screamed and cried as they died painfully.Fei took the magic axe of the level 12 Barbarian. After he sneak attacked the enemy officer, he gave it a full swing and the couple enemy soldiers in front of him didn\u2019t even get a chance to run away. They were separated into halves along with their weapons from the waist down.Behind him, the fully protected, heavily armoured strongmen started slaughtering the terrified soldiers.The heavy armours that they were wearing allowed them to ignore the attacks of the enemies, and on the other hand, their huge hammers and axes harvested the enemies\u2019 lives relentlessly. Even if the enemies could react and block their attacks, under the monstrous strength of the strongmen, the enemy soldiers would be smashed into pieces with their weapons or blown away by the strong force.That was the power of the enraged strongmen in close combat.After drinking the diluted \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011, the strongmen temporarily had unlimited endurance. They could abuse their strength endlessly without tiring themselves out. The heavy armour and weapons didn\u2019t weight them down at all and instead became the enemies\u2019 worst nightmare. The unbreakable suits of heavy armour, and with unblockable weapons, they were like a team of war beasts from hell.The twenty three men were like twenty three fully armoured hungry tigers who were led into a barn of sheep. You can already infer the outcome.The king, Alexander, was at the very front of their meat grinder formation. There were no soldiers among the enemies who could take one strike from him. He was almost pushing forward at the same speed that he charged in at. The front portion of the Tower Shield formation was torn into chaos.The enemies who were at the back of the formation tried to hold their positions but the enemy soldiers in the front were broken. They felt like they were facing a bunch of demons and wanted to have two more legs so that they could run faster away from them. All they could do now was follow their instincts and run for their lives. Many of them weren\u2019t rookies on the battlefield, but they never experienced a one sided massacre like this. They couldn\u2019t even fight back, how could they just wait for their deaths?Even though they were all elite soldiers, there was only one thing that was on all their minds, and that was \u2013Escape!Run as far away as they could!Run from these unkillable demons!\u2026\u2026At this point, someone had to stand out and re-establish the order in this chaos.The black knight [Two] who was the commander of the Tower Shield formation had finally gained back his senses after the shock that that horrifying strike gave him.After seeing the chaos in his formations, he knew that he had to prevent it from getting any worse. He pulled out his commander sword and struck at the couple soldiers who were escaping. Those soldiers didn\u2019t even have time to react and their heads flew off. The headless bodies continued the motions of running back for a couple steps before falling. The blood spewed out like a fountain\u2026\u2026\u201cHold the formation! Reassemble the second defense line! Anyone who backs off shall be executed! No exceptions!\u201d[Two]\u2019s sword was still dripping blood as he shouted.Under the death threat, most of the soldiers in the formation was forced to calm down. They came together slowly and stabilized the formation. After seeing his formation was reformed, [Two] calmed down a little bit. He sent off many commands to rebuild the proper defensive power of the formation.With the commander in position, the soldiers had demonstrated their superior battle abilities. They abandoned the chaotic front soldiers and backed off a little bit as a formation to clear out about 4, 5 yards of space. In just in a couple seconds, layers of tower shields were established and rows of lethal dragon lances were pointed out again. It brought back the original power of the formation.\u201cTink!\u201dThe Tower Shield Dragon Lance formation was stable once again.Black [Two] positioned himself behind the formation, staring at the twenty three armored marching beasts.He sneered. There wasn\u2019t enough distance between his formation and the \u201cbeasts\u201d so they couldn\u2019t pick up enough momentum to strike like that again and there was no way that they could break open the defense again.\u201cAs long as the new defense line doesn\u2019t get torn open again, the dragon lances could easily pierce the amours and the bodies of the bastards!\u201d Black knight [Two] thought coldly. He was staring at the front line closely through the thin gap between shields.With this new transformation, he had abandoned more than thirty soldiers outside of the formation. Those fully armored beasts were wiping out the poor soldiers like leaves. Blood, torn limbs, broken weapons were scattering everywhere\u2026\u2026[Two] had to admit that those beasts were indeed brutal monsters. The huge weapons in their hands even gave him, a one star warrior, a chill. Under such terrain constraints, it would be a nightmare for any army to deal with these fully armored beasts.Especially the man at the front, compared to the chill that the weapon made him feel, that man made [Two] feel like he was in a freezer.The man was the smallest in size among his peers, but he was also the strongest and most wild one.[Two] remembered clearly that from the beginning of the battle, that man threw out a monstrous axe, and blew open the unbreakable Tower Shield Dragon Lance formation like a god\u2026\u2026. Whenever [Two] thought back to it, even him who was a veteran on the battlefield was scared.Through the thin gaps between shields, [Two] could see clearly that that man somehow got another even more dangerous looking axe.The axe was larger than a door. It had a ton of dangerous looking back hooks. The black axe was glistening red from all the blood. It looked so heavy that it should only be lifted by two or three soldiers. However, the way that man was using it was like the axe weighed as much as a straw. Whenever he struck with that \u201cdoor\u201d, no one would be left standing.That man was like killing machine made for battle.Thirty well trained elite soldier couldn\u2019t even hold the \u201cmetal monsters\u201d off for twenty seconds. They were all turned into corpses, particularly ugly corpses. They were either chopped into a couple pieces, or smashed into meat paste. Limbs, organs, weapons\u2026\u2026 they were all broken everywhere\u2026\u2026Wherever they went, except for the bridge itself, nothing was left in its original form.At this point, the black armoured enemies had backed off 50 yards (46 m) on the bridge.It felt like an eternity for the enemy army and the defending soldiers on the defensive wall of Chambord, but the whole process only took 40 seconds.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: The Power of a Necromancer\u201cGod bless!\u201dFei didn\u2019t forget to continue motivating the strongmen.His axe didn\u2019t slow down as he shouted. Whoosh, whoosh, he made two chops and the enemy in front of him was sliced into three pieces. He looked up and realized that the chaotic formation had already backed off two yards and set up another layer of defense.Fei was slightly surprised. The enemy\u2019s reaction and reassembly speed was beyond his expectations. It looked like pushing forward would be much more difficult now. However, there was no way to pull back an arrow that had already been shot.Fei clearly knew that he would have to break the Tower Shield formation with the strongmen and destroy the siege ladders and trebuchets as fast as they could.At this point, time was life.Their charging speed couldn\u2019t slow down. Everything had to be completed before the enemy\u2019s commander could react and send orders. Otherwise, once they get crowded and the enemy\u2019s star ranked warriors arrived, the twenty two strongmen that weren\u2019t star ranked warrior and had no energy would not be able to escape, even if Fei could escape by himself.\u201cWith me as the center, reassemble the awl formation! Quick! Quick! Quick!!!\u201dFollowing Fei\u2019s shout, the twenty two strongmen who were loosely positioned due to the battle quickly restored their formation. Pierce and Drogba stood left and right behind Fei respectively. Both of them were covered in the enemies\u2019 blood. Circles of blood and bone fragments slid off of their weapons, giving them the appearance of demons from hell.The other strongmen behind them looked very similar, as if they had walked through a rain of blood. Their armour was still dripping in blood, and the only color you could see on them was red.Because Fei, the \u2018Super Mincer\u2019 was leading the way, any enemy that could threaten them was killed by him right away, so the strongmen didn\u2019t suffer any casualties. The most damage the enemies dealt were some marks on the heavy armour.\u201cEveryone drink some water in the blue water bag and wait for my commands. When I signal, charge right away!\u201d Fei told the strongmen behind him and charged up by himself.\u201cBam, bam, bam -!\u201dWhile he was charging towards the enemies, he kicked over a couple corpses, which caused them to fly over the 3 yard (m) tall Tower Shields and smash into the enemies behind the shields. There was some yelling and shouting behind those shields, but it didn\u2019t fall into chaos.In fact, Fei didn\u2019t expect that a couple corpses would mess up the enemies.Two to three yards of distance took less than a second for the level 12 Barbarian Fei to charge through, but Fei did something else during the process \u2013\u201cSwitch mode.\u201dHe said that in his mind and Necromancer Fei took over.Suddenly, a white light flashed and the huge axe in his hand disappeared, and so did the monstrous physical strength of the Barbarian. Instead, a gloomy white death energy clouded him like mist.At the same time, the Necromancer\u2019s skills were activated as well.\u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011!!!Many small, almost invisible clouds of death energy shot out of Fei\u2019s palm. They flashed through the thin gaps between the shields and entered the corpses that were kicked into the center of the new formation.\u201cExplode! Explode! Explode! Explode!\u201d Fei yelled in his mind. Suddenly, behind the \u2018steel wall\u2019 that blocked Fei\u2019s path, there were large \u2018booming\u2019 sounds, and then daunting screams followed.He \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011 used.The enemies that were hiding behind the Tower Shields was scorning Fei\u2019s decision to throw corpses at them. If a few corpses could create chaos, they wouldn\u2019t be called elites. However, not even in their wildest dreams would they have ever expected the corpses to explode like that. The explosions were intense, too. The dense blood and minced flesh instantly penetrated their leather armour, and the exploding bone fragments were like arrows that easily penetrated their metal armour.Because they did not pay much attention to those corpses, the causalities were huge.More than twenty enemies were instantly killed without even making a sound. There were more unfortunate enemies who got their limbs blown off, but didn\u2019t die right away. They rolled on the bridge as they screamed painfully. There were also a couple of really unlucky enemies who didn\u2019t get injured at all, but due to all the chaos, they were accidentally bumped off of the bridge into the fast current of the Zuli River. Their heads came up out of the water a few times as they tried to survive, but they were soon \u2018devoured\u2019 by the current and disappeared\u2026\u2026\u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011 was too powerful. It even caught black knight [Two] by surprise and a bone fragment had penetrated his left arm. It left a hole about the size of a thumb, and blood just wouldn\u2019t stop flowing out. Although he had energy in his body to add more defensive abilities, it wasn\u2019t enough to entirely block the damage from \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011. If he wasn\u2019t wearing that black mask, his soldiers would all see his pale and twisted face.None of them knew why and how the corpses suddenly exploded and caused another round of chaos.On the other side, Fei\u2019s charging speed didn\u2019t slow down at all. After \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011, he instantly switched back to Barbarian Mode.With the return of his physical strength, he roared as he stomped the ground with both of his feet. The hard stone bridge formed cracks as he initiated the Barbarian\u2019s skill \u2013 \u3010Leap\u3011.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dLike a magnificent mountain that suddenly took off, Fei\u2019s body created a large shadow under the bright sun. He jumped up at least 5 yards (m) high and leaped over the iron hedgehog like Tower Shields and Dragon Lances, and was about to land onto the enemies behind them.\u201cYou\u2019re dead now!\u201dBlack knight [Two] saw that this opponent \u2018flew\u2019 over the frontline and didn\u2019t have any weapons. He knew that it was a great opportunity. He didn\u2019t care about the injury on his left arm; he also jumped up as he concentrated all his energy into his right arm, and stabbed his sword at Fei.He was trying to use his delicate and efficient sword techniques to kill the \u2018bull\u2019 in front of him who only had strength.He was confident that he could win the battle in mid-air, since he was way more agile. With the opponent wearing such heavy armor, he was sure that he had at least one hundred ways to penetrate the \u2018beast\u2019s\u2019 heart without getting him dodging.However \u2013\u201cFuck off!\u201dFei shouted in mid-air and kicked [Two]\u2019s sword right on the neck.[Two] only felt something flash before his eyes and wasn\u2019t able to catch the opponent\u2019s movements at all. He soon felt that his body was numb and sore, as if he was struck by lightning. He wasn\u2019t able to hold onto his sword and it was kicked off of his hand and flew off like an ant in a storm.\u201cPuuuuu-!\u201dBlood rushed out of [Two]\u2019s right hand. It was torn open by the handle of the sword from the power of Fei\u2019s kick.However, [Two]\u2019s nightmare didn\u2019t stop there. Before he landed on the ground, Fei gave him another kick.This time, Fei kicked [Two] right in the chest. Crunching and cracking bone sounds came from inside of [Two]\u2019s body, and a deep and terrifying foot shaped \u2018hole\u2019 appeared on his chest. Suddenly, his fall accelerated and he smashed onto other enemy soldiers. The enemies fell down like Dominos, with a background music of screaming \u2026\u2026[Two]\u2019s heart was crushed into pieces after he was kicked in the chest. There was absolutely no life inside of him. He didn\u2019t make any sounds when he finally fell to the ground\u2026 he couldn\u2019t be any deader.His eyes were open wide and filled with shock, as if the last question on his mind before he died was how a one star warrior could die like a chicken under the feet of a man who didn\u2019t even have energy.Of course, if [Two] knew that the man he was about to take on was the \u2018beast\u2019 that killed two one star warriors in yesterday\u2019s siege, his first reaction would be to escape as fast as he could and not take on this man to try to accumulate military credits.Unfortunately, life didn\u2019t give any second chances.When Fei was a level 5 Barbarian, he was able to easily kill one star warriors. After he leveled up the level 12, he could kill guys like [Two] by simply waving his hands.After seeing their own commander being killed in a single kick, the formation became even more chaotic. Fei landed firmly in the middle of all the enemies and called upon his axe. After a white flash of light, the barbarian\u2019s huge, dangerous axe was in his hands once more.\u201cTink, tink, tink, tink \u2013 !\u201dHe did a ruthless 360\u00ba spin, almost forming a blade storm. It sliced all the enemies who were coming close to him, including their weapons. Under the spilling blood, Fei quickly approached the tower shields. He applied all his strength, and all the support beams for the shields and lances were chopped into pieces of scrap metal under the reflection of sunlight from the blade of the axe. All the tower shields that were covered by the three layers of metal were also chopped into two pieces and were kicked off the bridge into the Zuli River. They created many ripples in the water.The Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation that was once considered indestructible in many people\u2019s eyes had just been torn apart like a soft slice of bread. Moreover, it had been torn open by Fei, AGAIN!\u201cCharge! Clean out these bastards!\u201dFei switched between Necromancer mode and Barbarian Mode and destroyed the newly reassembled Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation in less than a minute. As many people were still in a big shock, Fei waved at the strongmen who had just drank the diluted \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011, and signaled them to charge.\u201cBam, bam, bam, bam!!!\u201dIf felt like a heavy cavalry was charging when the twenty two strongmen began running. It gave people who were watching an illusion of the whole stone bridge shaking under their feet, ready to collapse at any second.The blood and pieces of flesh on the twenty two sets of armour made them look like demons from hell.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Hail the King\u201cBoom!\u201dMore close combat fights erupted, and blood and limbs began to fly everywhere.The armoured strongmen charged into the chaotic sea of enemies and the massive weapons danced in their hands. The enemies were sent flying off of the bridge like kites; they fell into the river like dumplings and were washed away by the fast currents\u2026\u2026Fei didn\u2019t slow down, either. His axe returned back to being the Grim Reaper\u2019s sickle; it wiped out everything that it touched, like a broom sweeping up the dust. After every strike, there were fewer people on the bridge.Fei intentionally increased his charging speed this time. To increase his speed, he paid less attention to the strongmen behind him. He only killed the enemies that were directly in his line of sight after he had broken into the enemy\u2019s formations. The enemies that slipped through Fei\u2019s axe were left for the strongmen to handle.This way, their pushing speed would be much faster. However, the strongmen were facing more pressure. The enemies were all well-trained soldiers. Most of them were veterans and some of them even had tiny amounts of energy. In combat, their attacks were somewhat threatening to the strongmen. Although their armour protected the strongmen from the blades, the shocks that came with the attacks numbed their body parts. Soon, some of the strongmen became lightly injured, but they knew that there was no way Rather than hoping to kill more enemies, they didn\u2019t want to become a burden on their king. No matter how severe their injuries were, they bit their teeth to endure the pain and followed their king closely.Fei had discovered this was well. He spun his huge axe and created another blade storm. He turned the approaching enemies into \u2018dusts of blood\u2019 and filled the battlefield with sounds of cracking weapons and bones. He then quickly switched modes again.Barbarian Mode disappearedPaladin Mode was initiated.Suddenly, a divine and pure energy came out of Fei\u2019s body and surrounded the \u2018iron men\u2019 behind him. Fei stomped his feet, and a golden ring expanded from his body. All the strongmen felt that the injuries in their bodies were healing quickly as soon as the ring covered them. Their waning strength was recovering at an insane rate, and even their confidence and courage were boosted.It was Paladin\u2019s Aura \u3010Prayer\u3011\u201cHail the King!\u201dPierce yelled as he sensed it. He felt his blood burning and really wanted to kill more enemies. His war hammer was like an extension of the God of War\u2019s arm. After a horizontal strike, the cracking sound of metal breaking was as dense as putting cold water into a pot of boiling oil. Four or five enemies screamed as they were blown away by the hammer and flew off of the bridge into the river\u2026\u2026\u201cHail King Alexander!\u201dDrogba followed. He gripped the sword that an enemy was striking him with using his left arm, and chopped at the enemy with the axe in the right hand. \u201cSnip\u201d, the head of the owner of the sword was sent flying to the sky.\u201cHail the King!!!!\u201dThe rest of the strongmen roared together. Their damage output skyrocketed, as if they had transformed into wild tigers. Even Warden Oleg who was timid and at the very back seemed to be influenced by the atmosphere. He was finally able to properly use his one star warrior\u2019s strength and chopped the three enemies in front of him.\u201cShit, that man is a holy knight!\u201d\u201cWow, battle ring, that\u2019s a battle ring\u2026\u2026God! It\u2019s the [Ode of Life] battle ring\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFall back! Retreat!\u2026\u2026Ask the commander to send star ranked warriors to kill this holy knight\u2026\u2026Damn, since they have a high class holy knight who has acquired the [Ode of Life] battle ring, we won\u2019t have a number advantage at all\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the gold ring appeared under Fei\u2019s foot, gasps and shouts sounded from the enemies.\u2026\u2026As professional soldiers, the enemies knew exactly what having a high level holy knight in battle meant \u2013 holy knights were super healing machines. As long as a holy knight could continue the [Ode of Life] battle ring, the opponents would never run out of strength and stamina. Especially on a thin bridge like this, with a bunch of strong beasts and a high class holy knight, there was only one outcome \u2013 a one sided massacre.After they thought about it, some enemies who were brave enough to plan to gain back control by using their number advantage began to doubt themselves again; their courage was like a thin layer of snow in a hot summer day. It quickly melted and disappeared as it turned into vapour.However, Fei didn\u2019t give these enemies time to retreat.\u201cRoar \u2014\u2013 !!!Fei stomped his feet again and the miracle reappeared.A green ring expanded from his body and had a radius about 5 to 6 yards (m); all the strongmen were empowered as well. Suddenly, Pierce, Drogba and the other strongmen felt like their strength had more than doubled. The enemies were way weaker, like fragile ceramics. They would fall off of the bridge or \u2018fly\u2019 to the sky after they were just barely touched by the strongmen\u2019s weapons.Paladin\u2019s Aura \u2013 \u3010Might\u3011 appeared in the real world for the very first time.\u201cOhhhhhhhhh shit! It\u2019s the [Double Damage] battle ring\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGod, a double ring\u2026\u2026that man acquired a second type of battle ring? Da fuck?\u201d\u201cRetreat\u2026\u2026We\u2019re no match\u2026\u2026Archers! Shit, where are the fucking archers? Shoot them! Quickly!\u201dThe enemies\u2019 eyeballs almost popped out of their eye sockets again; they were almost having a mental breakdown.The situation on the bridge was even more chaotic. If the first golden aura had only forced the enemies to think about giving up and retreat and shake their confidence, then the second green aura had definitely crushed them. They had no courage to fight back anymore.On Azeroth Continent, holy knights had way more deterring effects due to the existence of the influential Holy Church. Many formal holy knight groups had taken important seats among all the other powerful and deeply-rooted forces on Azeroth Continent. Holy knights could be assembled into formations and sweep their enemies easily, and they could also fight individually. Their insane endurance, along with all the mysterious supportive battle rings that granted abilities such as healing, damage, and curses were the worst nightmare for any army. Holy knights were the star players in any battlefield.Therefore, after Fei used the Paladin\u2019s auras, the whole Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation gave up their defense and started retreating as fast as they could.There were many similarities between the Paladin in the Diablo World and the Holy Knight on Azeroth Continent. Some Paladin\u2019s skills and auras looked a lot like the battle rings of the Holy Knight. This caused the enemies to believe that Fei was a holy knight and acquired battle rings, so they had no courage to fight at all.Under the deterrence of a Holy knight as well as the death of [Two], the commander of the formation, the enemy soldiers escaped as if they were mice that had seen some big cats. The level of chaos was getting worse and worse. Some of the enemies were bumped into the river by others, and some even ran in the opposite direction and were made into porcupines by Chambord\u2019s archers.Most of the enemies turned around and tried to rush back to their base. But due to the chaos, they ran and pushed against the formation that was guarding the siege ladders.\u201cGreat opportunity! Charge!\u201dFei saw the enemies retreating as fast as they could after he used the auras \u2013 \u3010Prayer\u3011 and \u3010Might\u3011. Although he didn\u2019t know why, he knew it was a splendid opportunity to charge forward. He shouted as he charged with the strongmen and soon dismantled the Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation.The formation that could block off heavy cavalry charges only lasted less than two minutes under the crazy charge of Fei and the strongmen and was turned into piles of limbs and shattered metal.The thin bridge turned into a road of death and blood.\u201cPierce, Drogba, push those siege ladders into the river, quick!\u201dFei made a path to the next formation with his axe and finally approached the siege ladder. At that point, they had pushed about 60 yards (m) into the bridge. Fei blocked off the flooding enemies on his own and commanded Pierce and Drogba to organize the strongmen and destroy the siege ladders.\u201cAs you wish, Your Majesty!\u201dThe two answered, and their weapons were like windmills in their hands and smashed a number of enemies away. Then, they roared as they targeted the siege ladders.\u201cBoom! Boom!\u201dAlthough the enemies who were guarding the siege ladders fought back aggressively, they were no match. The two siege ladders were soon pushed into the river by the strongmen. It created a huge splash of water as if a huge creature was billowing below the river.Their morale was high; after they destroyed two siege ladders, like a pack of hungry wolves, they roared as they charged towards the remaining four siege ladders. Once they destroyed all the siege ladder, they would have completed half of the mission.At this moment \u2013\u201cMoo-moo-moo!!!\u201dClear and crisp bugles sounded from the south bank of the Zuli River.Many commands were communicated to the enemies who were battling on the bridge through different melodies and lengths of the bugle sounds. However, the enemies stared at each other and couldn\u2019t execute the commands. The series of commands were for the Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation, but the formation that was once honored as the number one defense in the army had been wiped out by the group of \u2018beasts\u2019 under their desperate charges.No one could have guessed that only twenty-ish men could destroy more than a hundred well trained tower shield dragon lance soldiers. Although the time gap between the deliveries of two sets of commands was only two minutes, it was useless now.It was too late!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: The PushIn just two minutes, the specialized defense formation had been wrecked.In contrast, the twenty three opponents didn\u2019t suffer any casualties at all. They tirelessly continued their murdering spree and pushed forward unstoppably.The thin stone bridge had turned into a road of death to hell. The enemies had no way of resisting, and could only slowly face their end in wails and screams under the call of the Grim Reaper.Quickly, the remaining four siege ladders were pushed off of the bridge into the river hundred yards (m) below. They were swallowed by the fast current and disappeared in seconds.\u201cForward!\u201dThe twenty three roars in unison shook the sky. The strongmen were enraged at their homeland being invaded on. Their blood burned as they followed their king resolutely. The twenty three beasts looked like they had just crawled out of a pool of blood in hell; blood dripped off of every part of their bodies.They pushed four or five hundred yards (m) into the mile and a half long bridge.After destroying the siege ladders, the trebuchet formation was next. But farther into the bridge, it got thinner and thinner. At the centre of the bridge, it was less than 2 yards (m) wide. It was also the most dangerous place on the bridge. The fast current somehow formed a giant swirl and periodically created a bizarre suction force underneath the bridge. If an ordinary person didn\u2019t pay attention, they would be sucked into the river and get devoured.The battle was continuing.Fei along with his loyal strongmen were getting closer and closer to the six trebuchets as they pushed forward. Back on the defensive wall of Chambord, it was filled with cheers and applause. The soldiers and the new recruits shouted, trying to give all the energy they had in their voices to the intense bridge battleground.Sometime during the battle, even the scared and weak citizens had climbed onto the defensive wall. They were holding various tools that could help with the defense and yelled with craze as they watched their king and loved ones rushing into the enemies and getting their revenge. That scene was deeply engraved onto their souls, and they would probably never forget it even when they passed away.The beautiful Angela and Emma were scared to watch and covered their eyes with their fingers as if they were watching a horror movie. However, they couldn\u2019t hold back their care for Fei and peaked at the battleground through their fingers. They screamed every time the situation got dangerous and hugged each other and cheered every time Fei had turned the situation around.The number one warrior Lampard stood firmly on the defensive wall.From the beginning of the battle when Fei jumped off of the defensive wall to him destroying the Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation, as a three star warrior, Lampard had seen and understood the situation much better than the other people. Although his expression was calm and collected, Alexander\u2019s power created a storm in his mind. It was clear that Alexander had at least three different types of mysterious yet strong powers \u2013 the monstrous physical strength, the white cold energy and the holy knight-like divine energy. This had confirmed Lampard\u2019s hypothesis \u2013 the young King Alexander was the one who had displayed four different types of powers in the watchtower.\u201cWhat exactly happened to Alexander that allowed him to return back to normal and grant him such strong powers? Is it really the God of War\u2026\u2026\u201dLampard wouldn\u2019t wrap his head around it.But deep in his heart, he wanted Alexander to continue his mysterious miracles. He suddenly became emotional; he looked up to the clear blue sky. It seemed like he had seen a familiar face and was gratified, \u201cOld friend, you can see your son being so brave and strong in heaven, right? Maybe one day, he can grow powerful and can help us find the missing Helen\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026The south bank of Zuli River, on a hill.\u201cImpossible! This is impossible! Shit\u2026\u2026Someone tell me, how could this happen? How could this happen?! That man is a holy knight? A dual battle ring holy knight? But he clearly didn\u2019t have any energy before\u2026\u2026My tower shield formation\u2026\u2026Unforgivable!\u201dThe silver masked knight stared at the battlefield. He was calm and collected, but was now a bit sluggish.He couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.The elite formation that he was proud of vanished into thin air under the challenge of a bunch of dogs.He was enraged; a blue energy shined around his body and the temperature around him dropped a couple of degrees. Like an iceberg releasing all of its cold energy, the horsewhip in the silver masked knight\u2019s hand was frozen into an icicle and crushed into icy bits.Had there ever been anything that embarrassed him more?The strategy that he considered invincible was smashed into pieces by twenty-ish low lives. His pride and sweat, the Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation didn\u2019t even hold on for two minutes. Two minutes! Not even enough time passed for him to give commands and it had turned into piles of junk and flesh!This sudden defeat was an unbearable blow to the silver masked knight, who was conceited and had never lost a battle in his life. To him, it felt like he was a god who controlled everything, and was punched to the floor by a dirty beggar. Moreover, the dirty beggar stepped on the god\u2019s face with his stinky and abscess-filled feet.\u201cI swear! Not a single creature will be left alive after I conquer this dirty kingdom! I will skin all of the dirty slaves of Chambord and hang their skins on this bridge\u2026\u2026I will chop up their flesh and bones into pastes and feed it to the reckless King of theirs!\u201dThe silver masked knight roared angrily.His blue energy force field was looming around, then quickly expanded. After a white, cold energy blew through, the saddle on his horse condensed into a layer of frost. The precious battle horse that he was riding froze into an ice sculpture; its blood and flesh froze instantly.The black knights behind him didn\u2019t dare say a word. They all lowered their heads and shut their mouths. The horses that the black knights were riding felt the danger too. They all backed off while being disturbed, and fear filled their eyes. They looked at the silver masked knight as if he was a bloodthirsty angry beast.No one made a sound on the hill.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Tough Enemy\u2019s ArrivalIt wasn\u2019t certain when the mysterious man under the black cloak had appeared beside the silver masked knight, but he wasn\u2019t affected by the silver masked knight at all. A black cloud of energy loomed around him, bending the light around him. The white thin horse he was riding on was snorting and chewing on grass on the ground.\u201cPass on my command \u2013 ready the armour piercing arrow formation. Make sure to cover the entire front half of the bridge. I will nail those dogs onto the bridge no matter what I have to pay\u2026\u2026\u201d The silver masked knight commanded in rage. His eyes were all red and looked terrifying.\u201cMaster, there\u2026\u2026There are our soldiers on the bridge\u2026\u2026They might be accidentally injured\u2026\u2026\u201dAll the black knights were surprised. Those metal beasts had charged into their formations, and the two groups had mixed together. If they shot their armour piercing arrows at them, the opponent would probably be killed, but so would their 100 plus soldiers.\u201cSoldiers? Soldiers need to sacrifice their blood and lives to build the honour of their commander. It\u2019s their duty; if they can on die on the battlefield for me, they should be considered lucky.The silver masked knight didn\u2019t even turn around. A single sentence had determined the fate of the hundreds of soldiers.The tiniest bit of consciousness hanging on in the silver masked knight\u2019s fiery rage made him feel like he needed another plan B. The series of losses gave him more awareness of the situation, as well as some fear. The man that was charging at the very front gave him too much of a shock; it made him feel like even the armour piercing arrows couldn\u2019t kill those ferocious beasts.He sat on his frozen horse sculpture for a while, then turned around and said gently to the mysterious black cloaked man, \u201cTeacher, if\u2026\u2026If the armour piercing arrows aren\u2019t effective, please help me and use your ruthless magic to wipe out those hard to deal with dogs!\u201dThe mysterious black cloaked man nodded. His movement allowed the wind to slightly lift up his cloak, revealing a wand that had many complex and cryptic engravings.He didn\u2019t reply to the silver masked knight right away, but whispered to himself, \u201cAmazing\u2026\u2026I\u2019d never believe that it could be possible to switch between a wild physical strength, a gloomy magic power, and a divine holy power. It looks like that man has acquired some mysterious skill\u2026\u2026Although all three powers aren\u2019t that strong, it\u2019s interesting\u2026\u2026I have to obtain his secret. That way, maybe I can advance to the next rank and my strength can increase a ton, hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he thought about that, he turned his head and said to the silver masked knight in his cold, hoarse voice: \u201cI can help you, but that man has to be captured alive; he is useful for me.\u201dHe pointed his finger. The finger was dry like an old tree branch, filled with wrinkles; it looked like it belonged to a zombie. Of course, the man he was pointing at was Fei who was leading the charge.The silver masked knight frowned. He hated that man the most. If it wasn\u2019t for that man charging at the very front, his Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation wouldn\u2019t have been so easily torn open and get murdered so quickly. He wanted to shoot that man with thousands of arrows and turn him into a hedgehog, but the mysterious black cloaked man had spoken. He thought about his teacher\u2019s four star mage\u2019s devastating magic power and finally nodded and accepted that request.\u201cPass on my command, tell the archers to be careful. Leave the enemy leader half-dead. Just make sure he lives!\u201d The silver masked knight changed his prior command coldly.The black knights behind him didn\u2019t dare say a word and went to pass down his command.Quickly, a group of soldiers left the enemy base. These enemies\u2019 steps were firm and definitely had good amounts of strength. Each of them carried a huge black bow on their back and quivers filled with hideously shaped arrows that had white tail feathers. The arrows had magic engravings with a little bit of magic stored inside of them. These were the armour piercing arrows that could penetrate through heavy metal armour and lower leveled mages\u2019 magic shields. They were the worst nightmare of any knight and mage on the battlefield.Every single arrow was expensive to make. It could be said that they were made out of gold. Normally, the silver masked knight was reluctant to use them, but this time, he didn\u2019t hesitate and took all of them out. He was that mad.The mysterious black cloaked man turned a blind eye towards this.He laughed quietly. His voice was sharp and shrill, as if someone was scratching a plate with a fork. He rode his thin horse and approached the stone bridge slowly. The black cloud of energy was looming around him; but as he got closer and closer to the stone bridge, the cloud of energy got thicker and thicker and blunted everyone\u2019s vision around him.At the same time,the battle on the bridge grew even more intense. More accurately, Fei\u2019s massacre was getting more aggressive. With Fei acting as the diamond drill head, every single enemy\u2019s formation melted like cheese; Fei and the strongmen could easily get through them.The six siege ladders were pushed into the Zuli River a while ago. In the past two minutes, the twenty three bloody butchers had destroyed a spearmen formation and another swordsmen formation.Everywhere they went, it turned into hell. Blood was everywhere, and screams and wails were the main theme. With the whiz of the fast current down below, it sounded like the laughter of death himself. The air even turned into the colour red. When they breathed, they weren\u2019t inhaling air, but rather blood!When the battle had turned to this level, even the tough enemies that had a lot of training and went through many battles had lost the courage to fight. The stares of the beasts under their armour that was decorated by minced flesh and bones made them shit their pants. Their roars made the enemy soldiers shiver. Although the bright sun was right in the middle of the sky, the enemies felt like they were standing in a freezer.The organized formations loosened up completely. The enemies on the front line wailed as they ran back and rushed into the other formations, and organized bridge became crowded and many enemies screamed as they fell off the bridge accidentally. They made many splashes in the water, but those were the last movements they could ever make.What was even more terrifying was that the blood and flesh that fell off of the bridge had attracted some strange and scary fish. These fish had many hooks on their backs and black metal-ish scales. Each of them were about 4 to 5 yards (m) long and their huge teeth shined under the bright sun. Even if a living man fell into the river, he would become a pile of bones in just a few seconds.\u201cGod! It\u2019s the bloody ferocious water beasts\u2026\u2026Shit! The blood attracted them here\u2026\u2026\u201dMany enemy soldiers started screaming when the fish appeared in the river. It became even more chaotic on the bridge. The enemies panicked more and more, and many of them fell into the mouths of the beasts. Some of the fortunate enemies held onto the edge of the bridge and tried to climb back up the bridge, but soon, their bodies were slammed into by other falling soldiers; they eventually fell into the river\u2026\u2026\u201cGo! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\u201dFei switched between Paladin Mode and Barbarian Mode freely. He used the Paladin\u2019s auras \u2013 \u3010Might\u3011 and \u3010Prayer\u3011 to minimize the casualties of the strongmen, and swung the Barbarian\u2019s huge axe to crush the enemies.\u201cBoom boom \u2013 !\u201dSoon, they were at the middle of the bridge \u2013 the thinnest place on the bridge. The trebuchets were right in front of them. Fei blew off the enemies in his way with his axe and kicked a trebuchet that weighed about six or seven hundred pounds. As if he was kicking a soccer ball, the trebuchet flew off of the bridge and crushed into the river. It killed off some of the water beasts. Some enemies were blown into the river by the momentum of the trebuchets, too.The mad charges were unstoppable. In a couple hits, out of the six trebuchets, four of them had been pushed off the bridge by Fei and the strongmen\u2026\u2026Everything was turning out as Fei expected; it was even smoother due to the enemies\u2019 chaos.At that moment, something happened \u2013\u201c[Exploding Sun Strike] \u2013 !\u201dAfter a loud shout, a huge red energy strike that carried a mountain-like pressure flew over the enemies and was aimed at Fei and the strongmen.Fei\u2019s pupil contracted.It was enemy\u2019s three star warrior \u2013 Swordsman Landes.He finally arrived.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Enemy\u2019s Response\u201cHaha, great! Daddy has been waiting for you!\u201dFei was expecting Landes to show up. In the dark, an assassin was dangerous, but once the assassin exposed himself, all his hidden danger would be gone. That was why Fei was relieved, rather than surprised. He laughed as he used his long prepared \u3010Leap\u3011. He stomped his feet and he flew up off the dust. He held his axe tightly and concentrated his full strength into this one strike.\u201cRip \u2013\u201cThis strike produced an almost inaudible noise, as if someone was tearing up a thin piece of paper.Compared to the three star warrior Landes\u2019 [Explosive Sun Strike], which was so fancy that its energy almost covered up the sky, Fei\u2019s strike was plain and looked like a lumberjack was hacking at a tree.But to everyone\u2019s surprise, Landes\u2019 4 to 5 yard (m) long energy slash which seemed to be able to destroy the sky was chopped in half by Fei\u2019s axe. The two waves of energy flew past Fei and disappeared after a small explosion.At the same time, very quickly-\u201cTink, tink tink, tink, tink!\u201dNumerous sparks appeared in mid-air. The two were fighting in mid-air at a speed that human eyes couldn\u2019t even follow. The sound of metal colliding and sparks from the collisions were suddenly the center of the battle. Soon, both of them roared and backed off\u2026\u2026\u201cTap, tap, tap!\u201dBoth of them were pushed a couple steps back and breathed heavily as they landed.In the series of exchanges, both of them had used their most powerful skills. Landes relied on his sophisticated sword techniques. Like a phantom, he stabbed at Fei twenty eight times in a single breath. Because the axe was very heavy, Fei only was able to strike six times; he tried really hard to block the attacks with his huge axe most of the time\u2026\u2026Both of them didn\u2019t leave any wounds on the other\u2019s body as they had wish. Although Landes kept his calm demeanor, he was inwardly shocked.He started to rush towards Fei and the strongmen right after he received the command from the silver masked knight, but due to the large number of retreating soldiers and the fast pushing speed of Fei and his followers, he wasn\u2019t able to arrive on time until the Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation was destroyed. The spearmen and swordsmen formations were dismantled and the siege ladders and trebuchets were almost all gone.When he finally arrived at the center of the battlefield, he instantly identified the unstoppable opponent who was covered in blood and leading the massacre. It was the \u2018beast\u2019 who injured him on Chambord\u2019s defensive wall yesterday. The bloodiness and wild nature of the \u2018beast\u2019 had left a scar in his mind, and he was still a little bit scared of the \u2018beast\u2019 even after a full day. He was hesitating and didn\u2019t attack right after he arrived.Landes gave up his pride as a three star warrior and hid in the chaotic sea of soldiers and attempted a sneak attack.He was trying to finish off his nightmare off with his [Explosive Sun Strike], but who knew that the \u2018beast\u2019 seemed to be ready and didn\u2019t panic under the sneak attack. The beast jumped up and chopped the air in half with his physical strength and cracked his proud technique [Explosive Sun Strike].\u201cWhat level of physical strength does he have?\u201dFrom the mid-air combat, Landes felt the ferocious strength of his opponent. Compared with their previous battle, the beast\u2019s strength had increased by almost double. Every strike of his that hit the \u201cdoor-sized\u201d axe caused his arm to become numb from the force of the impact. It was as if he was trying to pierce a hundred-layered iron.After Landes landed, he didn\u2019t dare underestimate Fei. He gathered up all his energy and maintained his peak strength. Red energy flames covered him completely, which got rid of the numbness in his arm. He was ready for battle.On the other side.After that short exchange, Fei had also obtained a lot of information.The physical strength of a level 12 Barbarian was enough to handle a three star warrior and their energy, but the Barbarian class lacked proper techniques. Fei sharply sensed that although Barbarians were the masters of close ranged combat and could master all types of weapons, they hadn\u2019t developed a complete system of techniques. Except for their incredible special skills like Warcry, the combat skills and techniques of Barbarians were sorely lacking compared to the warriors on Azeroth Continent.\u201cIt looks like I have to spend some time to learn more combat skills and techniques.\u201dAlthough Fei was thinking, his movements didn\u2019t slow down at all. He hit his armour with his axe. \u201cTink!\u201d It sounded as if the sound smashed the enemies in their hearts. Then he roared to the sky \u201cBless me, God of War\u201d, and his axe turned into a blade storm in his hand and struck at Landes.\u201cTink! Tink! Tink! Tink! Tink! Tink!\u201dThe sound of metal colliding.Landes\u2019 attack speed was way faster than Fei, but his strength was not as strong. Whenever Fei striked, Landes\u2019 sword would turn into a shadow and pierce at the same spot on the axe a couple times to cancel out the terrifying power of the axe.It was a battle between two different types of power.One was wild and powerful, full of destruction.One was complex and dense, and could strike more than ten times in a second.Landes had utilized his three star warrior\u2019s energy completely. The spilling energy flew away from the battle like meteorites. They smashed into the bridge, causing small pieces of stones from the bridge to fly everywhere.In a while, more and more dust and stone chips were blown to the sky; even the blood and limbs on the ground were blown up. They spun and whirled in the air and slowly formed a red cyclone. Looking from afar, it was like a growing bloody red tornado.The tornado grew bigger and bigger and completely enveloped Landes and Fei. Only sounds of metal colliding and loud roars came from inside the tornado, and the people on the outside couldn\u2019t see what was happening on the inside.The battle was very aggressive.The bloody red tornado had separated the bridge in half. Both the strongmen such as Pierce and Drogba on the north side and enemies on the south side of the bridge couldn\u2019t participate in the battle. They had to stand far away and observe. They had to wait for the result of the battle; they felt intense and their hearts beat wildly.Because of the \u2018break time\u2019, the chaotic enemies had slowly calmed down. Some enemy officers shouted and commanded, trying to reassemble their formations. After the Supervision Team chopped off more than twenty heads of deserters and placed them on the tip of their lances, the chaos finally stopped.Seeing this comforted Landes, who was having a hard battle with Fei. He yelled at a couple of enemy officers, \u201cI will hold him off! You guys go and kill off the rest of them!\u201dThe effect of the battle between Fei and Landes was too powerful; the whole bridge was cut off and the ordinary soldiers couldn\u2019t pass through it. They would be blended into pieces along with their weapons and armour by the overflowing energy. However, it wasn\u2019t that hard for the officers who possessed some energy. After hearing Landes\u2019 shout, a couple enemy officers who were desperate to earn military honours jumped up and moved towards the strongmen to kill them, while trying to avoid the battle between Fei and Landes.\u201cFuck off!\u201dFei roared as he saw what the enemy officers wanted to do.A terrifying power hit the enemies like a sound wave and shook their souls.It was the \u3010Howl\u3011 of the Barbarian.The level 5 \u3010Howl\u3011 was much stronger than the \u3010Howl\u3011 Fei used on Landes the day before. It had not only scared Landes and caused him to attack slower, but also terrified the four enemy officers who jumped up. Their energies froze for a second in their bodies; they all fell from mid-air into the bloody red tornado and were blended into meat paste by Fei\u2019s axe.\u201cHiss!!\u201dA series of gasps filled the bridge. Taking the life of four enemy officers who were all almost one star warriors using only a shout was a performance that almost caused the soldiers on both sides to bite their tongues. The enemy\u2019s newly reassembled formation was getting chaotic again; many enemies felt their legs trembling uncontrollably.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared! Keep going, the master had commanded: anyone who kills an enemy on the bridge will be rewarded 1,000 gold coins\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Landes pressured Fei with thirty three continuous strikes, he encouraged the officers. Bravery would appear under heavy rewards. The quality of the enemies was demonstrated by the reward; dozens of officers who possessed some level of energy jumped up and flew towards the strongmen.\u201cDie-!!!\u201dFei roared again, \u3010Howl\u3011 was initiated and the devastating mind power exploded.\u201cWhoosh, whoosh\u2026\u2026!\u201dFive or six enemy officers fell off again and were blended as they screamed. However, Landes reacted quickly this time and [Explosive Sun Strike] was aimed at Fei\u2019s face. The red flame energy filled the sky and suppressed Fei\u2019s power. Finally, about eight of nine enemy officers were able to successfully jump over the bloody red tornado and grinned evilly as they sprang towards the strongmen.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Together with the KingInstantly, Pierce and Drogba roared and led the charge on the enemies; the battle between the strongmen and the enemy officers began.The strongmen, including Pierce and Drogba didn\u2019t have any energy, and their fighting techniques weren\u2019t as sophisticated as the enemy officers who had more experience in wars. They were no match to the enemy officers fighting one on one, but fortunately they had more men, as well as the help from the \u2018magic water\u2019 in the red and blue water bags. None of them were afraid of death, so their fighting style was made to literally perish along with the enemies. Oleg who was a one star warrior, so he was able to hold for a while; no one was sure who would emerge victorious in this battle.However, casualties were unavoidable.An enemy officer dodged the axe strike of a strongman, and sung his sword like a poisonous snake; it went through the tiny gaps between the pieces of armour and penetrated the strongman\u2019s stomach\u2026\u2026The strongman\u2019s body froze under that injury; it obvious that he wouldn\u2019t be able to live through it.But before the enemy officer could laugh and pull out his sword, the officer was horrified to discover that the man he had severely wounded threw away the axe and locked him down with his arms. The strongman\u2019s clamping arms strangled him tightly, and the officer had a hard time to breathing. Before he could react at all, the wounded strongman shouted, \u201cHail King Alexander!\u201d and viciously charged, aiming at the other enemy officers. In a series of gasps, the strongman shoved two other enemy officers who didn\u2019t have time to dodge, and all four of them fell into the river. Instantly, they were turned into piles of white bones by the human-eating water beasts that had gathered under the bridge.The self-sacrificing strategy of the strongman had scared all of the other enemy officers.\u201cBreno!!!\u201dAfter seeing the strongman Breno fall to his death in the river, Pierce felt like someone had stabbed him in the heart. He didn\u2019t dodge and let one officer pierce him through his leg, and then he countered with a powerful smash. The smash had knocked the enemy\u2019s head into his chest.The battle was getting more and more intense, and both parties had suffered casualties.The autumn wind blew through the battlefield and echoed the solemn and tragic atmosphere in the sky.These strongmen may have only been unremarkable and ordinary people, but they all shined with unparalleled glory following Breno\u2019s shout and decisive and tragic leap into the Zuli River.The strongmen who were showered in blood had built a wall of flesh with their lives on this ancient stone bridge; even if they had to die, they would protect their kingdom and families behind their backs.Under the shadow of blades and the flurry of blood.The heroes\u2019 marching steps were firm and steady. Even if they were pierced by blades, even if their arms were chopped off, even if blood spurted in their helmets\u2026they would never take a step back. They all yelled, \u201cHail the King!\u201d as they charged into the enemies who were stronger than them. They didn\u2019t hesitate to block the way of the mocking enemies who possessed energy and wanted to slaughter them.The intensity of the battle couldn\u2019t even be described. Eventually, the enemy officers were shaken by the murderous will of the opponents and didn\u2019t dare face the group of opponents who were weaker than them. They were scared and some of them turned around and tried to escape\u2026\u2026Numerous people stood on the defensive walls of Chambord silently as tears filled their eyes. Flames of anger were burning in everyone\u2019s eyes. Their blood was boiling uncontrollably and their hands which were holding weapons started trembling from anger. Some soldiers couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and roared as they glided down the rope that was hanging off of the defensive wall. They were willing to support their troops and families who had built that human wall!Fei who was battling the three star warrior Landes witnessed all of that.After seeing the strongman Breno jump into the river with the enemy, an unprecedented sadness filled his heart, as if he had lost a loved one. Fei felt something was burning in his body, and if he didn\u2019t relieve it soon, he would be burned into ashes\u2026\u2026Fei roared as he turned around.The twenty two strongmen were brought out of the castle by him. Except for Breno who had already sacrificed his own life, Fei swore to himself to bring the twenty one strongmen back safely to Chambord.Landes left four or five startling wounds on Fei\u2019s back as he turned around, but Fei didn\u2019t acknowledge him at all. The axe turned into a blade storm again in Fei\u2019s hand and chopped the remaining enemy officers into pieces. Fei shouted to the rest of the strongmen, \u201cRetreat\u2026\u2026Go back, go back to the castle! Warriors, our mission has been completed!\u201dHowever \u2013\u201cWe will stay together with the King \u2013 !\u201dIt was a unanimous response from the strongmen; there was no hesitation. Some of them still had broken blades stuck in their bodies, shocking bloody holes in their armour, and were only able to stand up with the help of their companions. However, their decision was as firm as a mountain and none of them wanted to back off.Fei was touched and anxious at the same time.He struck horizontally to rip through the air and dodged Landes\u2019 snake-like sword that was stabbing directly at his head. Fei shouted, \u201cPierce, I command you as the king: bring my warriors back to Chambord right now! Don\u2019t disobey my order\u2026\u2026 Trust me, I have a way out of this.\u201dPierce lowered his head and avoided Fei\u2019s eyes.As a soldier of the King\u2019s Guards, he had thousands of reasons to stay behind and fight alongside the king. If the king was as unstoppable as before, retreating was also an option. However, all of them could see that after the appearance of the enemy\u2019s three star warrior, Alexander couldn\u2019t battle as easily as before. Both of them were equally powerful, and none of them could defeat the other quickly. If they retreated right now, it meant that they would have left the King behind in an extremely dangerous situation\u2026\u2026They would rather bleed and die on the battlefield than leave their King in danger.After avoiding Fei\u2019s stare, Pierce and Drogba led the strongmen to drink the water in the water bags silently. Before the wounds on their bodies could recover properly, they reformed their awl \u2018V\u2019 formation and Pierce acted as the awl tip and led the charge.\u201cYour Majesty, the siege ladders and trebuchets have already been destroyed. We will stay behind, please return back to Chambord!\u201d Pierce yelled as he charged.Fei didn\u2019t say anything as he saw that.He knew that in this situation, even if used his stats as the King, he wouldn\u2019t be able to command the stubborn warriors back to the castle. He changed up his fighting style and gave up any kind of defense. He also took on the self-sacrificing strategy, and aimed every strike at the vital points on Landes\u2019 body.\u201cHahaha, you are cornered! This is useless, none of you can live!\u201dLandes\u2019 laughed. He had already saw their victory, so he didn\u2019t fight Fei with his full force. If he could drag out the battle with these fully armoured opponents, as time went on, they could exhaust the opponents with their number advantage.Fei definitely understood Landes\u2019 plan.He even saw the teams of enemies that were approaching the bridge carrying long bows and huge arrows in their quivers on the other side of the bank. Although they were still almost a mile away, his Barbarian instinct warned Fei about the great amount of threats those archers had.However, Fei suddenly felt something much more threatening than those archers,causing his mind to become clouded. The terrifying feeling made him feel like he was the target of deadly snake who was sneaking up on him.Fei had quickly identified the source of that threatening feeling \u2013On the tip of the south side of bridge, a black cloud of fog was slowly diffusing. A black figure was steadily moving inside the cloud of fog, and Fei who was experienced and had a clear understanding of magic under the Sorcerer Mode could clearly sense the strong and aggressive magical power field around that figure. It was beyond Fei\u2019s expectation; even under the assault of the most powerful boss he had faced in the Diablo World \u2013 Griswald, he didn\u2019t feel that threatened\u2026\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a master mage\u2026\u2026Far beyond a three star rank!\u201dFei was shocked. Instantly, he knew that the real danger was about to arrive.He didn\u2019t expect a super boss to hide in the enemy\u2019s troops. The situation turned from bad to worse. Once that figure in the black fog got closer than three hundred yards (m), which was the average magic coverage of spells, Fei and the strongmen wouldn\u2019t have any chance to escape.What was even more daunting was that the appearance of such a mage meant that all the hard work they had put into this mission was wasted. A mage that was above three stars was over twenty times more threatening to Chambord than the six trebuchets.Hei guiz, If you wanna play diablo 3, its 5 bucks off.

    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Fei\u2019s Plan\u201cI must find a way to kill that mage!\u201d Fei thought.With Fei\u2019s strength, he was having a hard time fighting a three star warrior; to kill a mage who had an even higher rank than three stars and was under the protection of the enemy troops would have been as difficult as going to the moon. He was trying to think of a possible plan while he was in combat against Landes, but he couldn\u2019t come up with anything. Even if he was in Barbarian Mode, Paladin Mode or Sorcerer Mode, his power and strength were no match for a mage that was possibly four or even five star ranked.In a few moments, the strongmen had approached. They wanted to surpass Fei and block off three star warrior Landes to help Fei retreat.\u201cIt can\u2019t be delayed!\u201d Fei decided.He knew that time was very tight. Any kind of delay could result in their complete annihilation.Fei suddenly roared and initiated Barbarian \u3010Howl\u3011 again. A frightening wave of mind power swept out and scared away the approaching enemies. After pushing Landes back a little with his strike, Fei suddenly jumped into the air. His hands held the axe tightly and struck down as if he wanted to chop a mountain in half.This strike was too powerful. Sparks emerged from the blade of the axe from the friction in the air, as if a meteorite was about to hit the Earth.Landes was surprised; he didn\u2019t dare take on this strike.\u201cBoom!\u201dSuddenly, the bridge cracked, and dust and stone chips flew everywhere. The whole bridge seemed to shake. Some large rocks that were attached to the bottom of the bridge fell into the river; the impacts created a series of skyrocketing water columns!\u201cHahaha, you chicken! A three star warrior can\u2019t take my strike?\u201dFei mocked Landes. He stood on the bridge firmly and pointed the tip of his axe at Landes. At that moment, it felt like he wasn\u2019t the only one standing there, but rather there were thousands of troops behind him. The domineering impression created an oppressive feeling for the enemies who were ready to make their move.\u201cGo back!\u201dAfter Fei mocked the enemies, his expression changed and he shook his arm.A huge amount of strength was sent from his arms, and he pushed back the strongmen who were about to charge past him. Faced with the physical strength of a Barbarian, the strongmen felt like they had run into a hard wall and stumbled as they were sent back.Before anyone could react, Fei jumped up again just like before and concentrated his strength and chopped down.The axe blade turned red again under the high speed that created friction in the air. With a burning sensation, the axe was aimed at Landes. It had unparalleled momentum.In mid-air, Fei yelled, \u201cHaha, who dares to take this on?\u201dNo one dared. Including the three star warrior Landes, all the enemies backed off to hide from this strike.Within the thousands of enemies, no one dared to take on the beast who had blown open the Tower Shield-Dragon Lance formation. When faced against beasts who sacrificed their own lives to take down ensues, their only option was to back off.But Fei didn\u2019t take that as an answer.He continuously jumped up and chopped down at the enemies, not caring about his stamina at all. He was like a mad beast, pushing into the enemy grounds step by step. No one dare to stop him, nor even respond to his stares.\u201cTree! Tree!! Tree!!! Tree!!!! Tree!!!!!\u201d\u201cWhat? No one dares to take me on?\u201d\u201cHahaha, are all of you cowards who hide your heads in your pants?\u201d\u201cPooh! Landes, where is your pride as a warrior? Come fight me!\u201d\u201cWho dares to battle with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter every single strike, Fei would mock the enemies and take a step forward.His proud expression was like an emperor glancing at his own territories, and no one dared to look at him. Every time Fei took a step forward, the enemies would tremble and take a step back. Even Landes was pressured by Fei\u2019s strikes; he didn\u2019t doubt that if he took Fei\u2019s strike head on, even with the energy shield of a three star warrior, he would be chopped into two pieces. That fear forced him to move back continuously.In just seven or eight seconds, Fei had struck eight times.All these strike smashed onto the bridge like lightning and the whole bridge shook violently. Many huge stones and rocks fell into the river and killed dozens of bloodthirsty water beasts who were fighting for the corpses. The surface of the river turned into the colour red.The enemies had backed off sixteen or seventeen yards(m) from the pressure of a single man and his axe.After the eight strikes, Fei paused and started laughing. The enemies backed off slowly in the laughter of their opponent.Fei glanced at the enemies disdainfully, then he suddenly took a couple steps back rather than forward and jumped up again \u2013 Barbarian \u3010Leap\u3011. He jumped up five or six yards (m) into the air and struck down with all the strength he had.This strike was surprisingly not aimed at the enemies, but rather at the surface of the bridge behind him.\u201cCrack-!\u201dThe axe Barbarian Fei was using couldn\u2019t handle his monstrous strength anymore, and the thick black twisting handle whined and broke in half.The huge power collided with the surface of the bridge and the loud sound caused everyone to instantly cover up their ears. The enemies who were close and weren\u2019t that strong had their eardrums shattered, and blood flowed out of their ears. Some enemies were so stunned that they couldn\u2019t stand properly and fell off of the bridge\u2026\u2026The power of the strike that Fei demonstrated felt like the wrath of the gods.All of the enemies\u2019 faces were pale.After the shock, many people including Pierce suddenly had a question on their minds, \u201cWhy would Alexander turn around and strike the bridge?\u201dAfter the dust and stone chips cleared, everyone could see past the bridge again. Fei stood on the bridge and his chest heaved heavily. It was obvious that after such desperate strikes, Fei was exhausted.He stood there quietly.With half of the axe handle in his hand, Fei stared at Landes with a sneer on his face.For a moment, a rare silence spread through the entire battlefield.Everyone could even hear their own rapid breathing.Suddenly, something happened.\u201cCrack-!\u201dEveryone heard a tiny sound.The tiny sound was as soft as the whining of insects, but it hit everyone\u2019s heart as hard as thunder. Everyone couldn\u2019t help but panic, they were horror-struck as they found out that spider web-like cracks appeared under Fei\u2019s feet.Suddenly, like a flash of light, many people understood Fei\u2019s intentions \u2013 Fei\u2019s nine terrifying strikes weren\u2019t done for the purpose of killing enemies, but to create cracks on the surface of the bridge. The whole bridge was covered with cracks and began to collapse.The stone bridge started to shake violently.\u201cCrack! Crack! Crack!\u201dThe cracks were getting bigger and bigger.Huge support stones and rocks broke off of the bridge and smashed into the Zuli River hundreds of yards (m) below and created large ripples in the water.\u201cShit-! The bridge is about to collapse!\u201dLandes almost crapped his pants. Even if he knew what Fei\u2019s intentions were, he didn\u2019t have time to stop him. He stomped on the ground aggressively and used his energy to push himself back quickly. Even if he was a three star warrior, if he fell into the fast flowing river, there was no way for him to survive under the sharp teeth of the thousands of bloodthirsty water beasts.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: The CollapseThe re-organized formations were in chaos again and every single enemy was screaming and fighting to escape first.The bridge was shaking more intensely as time passed. Fei was the only one standing still in the middle of the bridge which was filled with the largest cracks. He was very calm as he quickly planned his next move.He took out a bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 and a bottle of \u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 and chugged them down under the cover of flying dust and stone chips. All of his fatigue went away and his wounds instantly began to recover.Soon, he was back at his peak state. Except for the holes in his armour and his broken axe, his body didn\u2019t have any problems. Not even a scar was left.The potions from the Diablo World were just too magical.At the same time, the strongmen on the north side of the bridge were shocked.They surprisingly found out that King Alexander was standing in the middle of the crack, yet he was just standing there and not moving for some reason\u2026\u2026They all thought Fei was exhausted and didn\u2019t have the strength to move anymore. If the bridge collapsed, falling into the river would be too dangerous, so they were all terrified for Fei.\u201cDamn\u2026\u2026Quick, save the king!\u201dPierce rushed forward to Fei\u2019s location like a mad god.The other strongmen reacted the same way; they forgot about their bleeding wounds and risked their lives to rush to save Fei.\u201cCome back; you guys are crazy!\u201dAt this time, Drogba kept a rare calmness; he grabbed Pierce and pulled him back swiftly. He roared, \u201cIf all of us go there, our combined weight will cause the bridge to collapse faster\u2026\u2026We need to send someone who\u2019s fast to go and bring the back the king speedily.\u201d\u201cI will go! I\u2019m the fastest!\u201d After Pierce mulled for a second, he shouted as he was about to charge again.\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026You aren\u2019t as fast as me.\u201d A sly expression appeared on Drogba\u2019s face. He hit Pierce on the back of his head with his axe handle and knocked Pierce out. He rushed towards Fei as he laughed, as if he had gain something super advantageous. He yelled at his peers, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t need to come, I will help the king. Hahaha, take care of that whited haired idiot\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he said that, he charged even faster than a cheetah. The bridge was cracking and collapsing; Drogba used agility that wasn\u2019t proportional to his huge torso and rushed to Fei in just a couple seconds. He didn\u2019t say a word as he planned to grab Fei by the waist and put him on his shoulders to run back to the north bank of Zuli River.\u201cThe f**k\u2026\u2026Drogba? What are you doing here?\u201dFei was concentrating on perfecting his upcoming plan and was surprised by the huge figure that sprang out of the dust.\u201cYour Majesty, the bridge is about to collapse, we need to get back!\u201dFei was about to say something, but the part of the bridge under his feet suddenly shook aggressively. The biggest supporting stone finally collapsed and fell into the river. Many water beasts opened their big bloody mouths in anticipating to bite them\u2026\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s no time to do that!\u201dThere was no way back, as the part of bridge that linked back to Chambord was gone. Fei grabbed Drogba\u2019s hand and used Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Leap\u3011. He powerfully stomped on the collapsing bridge, and the force caused the stone that Fei was stepping on to break off of the bridge completely. Fei jumped into the air with Drogba in his hands and \u2018flew\u2019 towards a safe location.However, the direction that he leaped wasn\u2019t towards the north where Chambord was at, but rather\u2026\u2026 it the south where the enemies were at.\u201cBoom!\u201dFei landed with Drogba firmly on a part of the bridge that was dozens of yards (m) away from the crack. This part of the bridge hadn\u2019t collapsed.Finally, the dust that covered up the sky cleared up. The intense shaking of the bridge eventually calmed down as well.Everyone could see the half collapsed bridge \u2013 There was now a gap about sixteen to seventeen yard (m) wide in the middle thinnest portion of the ancient half artificial bridge, as if a god had cut it in half. The current under the bridge whizzed as it quickly flowed downstream. The gap had become a natural barrier; after the collapse, the enemies had no way of getting to Chambord. Only star ranked warriors would be able to get across with the help of roped hooks; ordinary soldier couldn\u2019t get across unless they had wings.Fei and Drogba stood on the edge of the gap. Behind them, there was the sixteen to seventeen yard (m) long death zone, and the current and the water beasts weren\u2019t a joke.In front of them stood thousands of enemies. Their blades shined with bloodthirst, and they all had murderous gazes.To these two, this\u2026\u2026was definitely a dead end; there was no way they could make it out of this situation alive \u2013 unless Chambord could find a way to get Fei and Drogba back, or if they could kill all the enemies in front of them\u2026\u2026But both ways were impossible.On the defensive wall, numerous hearts sunk.The soldiers\u2019 and citizens\u2019 face turned pale, and they couldn\u2019t utter a sound. Three star warrior Lampard frowned; beside him, the fairy like Angela bit her lips tightly and blood started to flow out. Crystal clear tears rolled off of her cheeks like rain drops, and Emma was sobbing silently in Angela\u2019s arms.On the south bank of the Zuli River, the silver masked knight stomped with fury.After the collapse of the bridge, the plan of conquering Chambord in a short time was ruined. The long gap between the two sides of the bridge blocked them off as if it was god\u2019s will. It was insurmountable.\u201cKill them\u2026\u2026Kill them!\u201dThe silver masked knight pointed at Fei and Drogba. His sense of superiority, confidence and feeling of having everything under his control had all disappeared. His entire body started to shiver uncontrollably as if he had a sudden seizure; he couldn\u2019t even speak properly. He screamed frantically and lost all elegance in his demeanor.His subordinates had to rub their eyes to make sure that it was the same person. For many years, they had never saw their commander go crazy like a stimulated psycho. Without his usual calm demeanour, the mad appearance was lower than that of a beggar on the street that was starving to death.On the partially collapsed bridge.Landes was relieved after the dust cleared. In this situation, the two opponents could only die in his hands. They had no way back and no chance to escape; no matter how powerful one was, even three and four star warriors wouldn\u2019t outlast thousands of soldiers.Landes was confident, \u201cHaha, you low lives, you\u2019re dead now\u2026..Dead! I will smash each of your bones, and cut off each piece of your flesh. I will make you beg for your death!\u201dLandes slowly approached Fei and Drogba with a nasty grin on his face.Behind Landes, the enemy troops began to move forward slowly as well under the pressure of the supervision team. The chilling murderous sensation blew at Fei and Drogba, and the atmosphere became extremely depressing.Ordinary people would\u2019ve already broken down under such situation, but \u2013\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026Looks like both of us are going to die here. Do you regret it?\u201d Fei didn\u2019t even look at the approaching enemies, he turned around and smiled at Drogba, \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\u201cTo die beside the great warrior King Alexander is my Didier family\u2019s honour\u2026\u2026 Didier Drogba will never regret this!\u201d After he said that, the strongman who had wounds all over his body held his axe tightly, decisively stepped forward and stood in front of Fei. His glared at the enemies and roared, \u201cHahaha, I have killed enough today\u2026\u2026 Ball-less bastards, if you want to harm my king, you have to step over my dead body!\u201dThe roar was as loud as thunder.Even Landes who was the three star warrior was a little intimidated by the roar of a person who was far weaker than him, which caused him to pause his steps. The enemies behind him reacted worse; hundreds and thousands of them were flustered and jumped as they backed off a couple steps.At the moment, Fei\u2019s blood started to burn again.Before this, Fei had asked himself repeatedly, \u201cWhy should I fight this hard? I\u2019m only a passenger who accidentally came to this world. Wars, death, fighting, blood\u2026all of these are irrelevant to me. If I wanted to leave, with Diablo World as my \u2018gold finger\u2019, I could survive anywhere else\u2026\u2026Why would I fight so desperately?\u201d\u2026\u2026If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He doubted and questioned his decision more than once. But at this moment, seeing the strongman standing in front of him, the strongmen on the other side of the bridge who were madly trying to get across and the soldiers who were trying to rush out of the castle to support their peers and their king\u2026\u2026Fei suddenly felt like there was nothing to hesitate about, and that everything was the way it should have been.This was the decision of a real king.After breathing in the air filled with the smell of blood from the battlefield, Fei walked beside Drogba. He smiled and said to the strongman who was pumped and ready to die, \u201cWhen you get back, pass on my commands. Tell Brook and Lampard to stop our soldiers and citizens and make them retreat immediately. Regardless of what happens, don\u2019t leave the castle\u2026\u2026Remember this. This is my command as the king. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is, everyone must obey, or else it will be considered treason!\u201d\u201cWhat? Back\u2026\u2026\u201d Drogba was confused. He didn\u2019t get what Fei meant.At that moment, Fei suddenly took the axe out of Drogba\u2019s hands and held the strongman by his waist. He tensed up his upper body and lifted Drogba off of the ground. He turned around and used the momentum of the rotation to throw Drogba away.Drogba didn\u2019t any time to react. He just felt like his body was suddenly light.The next moment, his vision blurred as he flew through the wind. In a series of gasps, he was thrown like a sandbag by Fei and flew over the big gap. He landed on the other side of the bridge. Fei\u2019s throw had demonstrated the Barbarians\u2019 ability to utilize their own strength; Drogba smashed into the other half of the bridge and glided four or five yards (m). There were tons of sparks on his metal armour from rubbing against the bridge. His body finally stopped gliding at where the rest of the strongmen were standing. Aside from a slight dizziness due to the fall, Drogba wasn\u2019t injured at all.\u201cGo back! All of you!\u2026\u2026Trust me, I will make it back!\u201dFei\u2019s voice came from the other side of the bridge. It went through the whizzing current and was clearly heard by Drogba, Pierce, Brook, Lampard, Angela and everyone else. It echoed in the sky and didn\u2019t disappear for a long time\u2026\u2026After he shouted, Fei threw away the axe that he took from Drogba and suddenly charged forward. Like a blizzard, he rushed towards Landes and the enemies.\u201cYou\u2019re dead! AHAHAHAH!\u201dIn this situation, after seeing another opponent escaping in like that, Landes was enraged. The series of losses despite having such a huge advantage was making him go crazy. He stomped his feet to push himself forward and took Fei head on; the red flame energy surrounded his body and shined like the sun. Landes was definitely at his peak.\u201cHahaha, I\u2019ll send you to hell with this one strike and separate your head from your body!\u201dFei wasn\u2019t scared, and he laughed as he provoked Landes even more. During his charge, Fei suddenly changed to Sorcerer Mode, A powerful magic field surrounded him instantly and the air beside him heated up.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dA series of fireballs appeared and shot at Landes.Sorcerer Fire Spell \u2013 \u3010Fire Bolt\u3011Next, \u201cCrackle, crackle\u201d, a series of silver lightning balls flew towards Landes from Fei\u2019s palms.Sorcerer Lightning Spell \u2013 \u3010Charged Bolt\u3011That wasn\u2019t the end.After the lightning, \u201cCrack, crack\u201d, the temperature of his surroundings dropped like crazy. A cloud of ice energy appeared in Fei\u2019s palm; it formed into an ice ball and also flew towards Landes. It froze the air around it as it travelled in mid-air.Fei didn\u2019t hesitate and used all three skills of the level 3 Sorcerer. After depleting all the mana of his mana, he switched back to Barbarian Mode and sped up his the charge.A gold light flashed by.He called up the substitute weapon of the Barbarian \u2013 \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 and \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011.On the other side, Landes was in a panic due to Fei\u2019s Sorcerer spells.Not even in his wildest dreams would he have guessed that the opponent was a mage too.However, a three star warrior wasn\u2019t that weak. He dodged the series of fireballs easily. But before he could adjust his position, the series of lighting balls was sent right in his face. Landes tried to block them with his sword, but the lighting balls exploded before they touched his sword. The silver lightning exploded in every direction and many of them landed on Landes\u2019 body. It numbed his body and slowed his movement down for a little bit.But after his red flame energy quickly got rid of the lightning energy in his body and he was about to fight back, the ice ball occupied his entire vision. Although he was strong, he wasn\u2019t able to dodge this time.\u201cBoom-!\u201dThe ice ball landed and a thin layer of ice covered up his body instantly.Before he could use his red flame energy to melt the ice, he saw a quick flash of gold light and his neck felt cold. Landes felt like he was flying and saw a familiar figure. It was his body, the head on top of the neck was missing, and blood was spurting out like a water fountain\u2026\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026\u2026beheaded?\u201dThat was the last thought that came to his mind.

There were white clouds in the blue sky.On the bridge.With the gold sword in his right hand, the half transparent shield filled with hooks on his left forearm and the head of the three star warrior Landes in his left hand, Fei stood tall and firm. Blood was dripping on the ground and left a series of blood stains\u2026\u2026Behind Fei, blood spurt towards the sky from the neck of the headless corpse of Landes.\u201cTink!\u201d The sword slid out of the corpse\u2019s hand and made a crisp sound when it hit the ground. Then, the body that had infinite strength a second ago slowly fell down powerlessly, like a rotten tree\u2026\u2026A three star warrior couldn\u2019t even handle one strike, and ended up beheaded.Landes\u2019 eyes were still wide open on the head in Fei\u2019s hand. It seemed like he didn\u2019t even have time to process what had happened. His nasty grin froze on the face; there was no life left in his eyes.The majestic three star warrior was powerful and unchallenged when he was alive, but now he was no different from a beggar after he died.Fei sneered as he slowly walked forward. His steps were light, but every time he took a step, his enemies who were in shock and panic backed off ten steps\u2026\u2026Fei gave no dominating speeches, nor any murderous stares. He just walked forward quietly.He didn\u2019t even look at the thousands of enemies in front of him. His looked past the scared enemies and stared at the black energy cloud further away. An intense pressure came from that magic field, and the sense of danger Fei felt in his mind was continuously getting stronger.\u201cHow can I kill this mage?\u201dFei thought to himself quickly.His fight with Landes looked easy, but it wasn\u2019t at all for him.First of all, he switched to Sorcerer Mode and used all the three skills he had \u2013 \u3010Fire Bolt\u3011 to attract Landes\u2019 attention, \u3010Charged Bolt\u3011 to numb Landes\u2019 body and alter his movement and \u3010Ice Bolt\u3011 to freeze Landes up for a half a second. The whole process was precisely calculated and Fei had executed it perfectly; that was how Fei was able to kill the tough enemy.Speaking of actual strength, Fei wasn\u2019t anywhere near as strong as Landes. However, the skills in the Diablo World were mysterious and bizarre. Fei used that to his advantage and took Landes by surprise, which was how he was able to successfully challenge the three star warrior.However, the figure in the black energy cloud was way stronger than Landes. Moreover, since all of Fei\u2019s trump cards had been used on Landes, that mysterious mage probably observed all of them. The skills from the Diablo World wouldn\u2019t be as effective anymore because the enemies had now taken precaution. Moreover, Fei\u2019s tricks and strategies were child\u2019s play considering the significant gap between the power levels.Numerous thought rushed into Fei\u2019s head, but he didn\u2019t slow down his steps.He approached the enemies slowly. On the other side, the enemies felt like they were a bunch mice facing a lion and couldn\u2019t help but step back chaotically. They even lost the courage to look at Fei. The monster\u2019s series of incredible battle records\u2014especially his terrifying performance of taking the three star warrior down with one strike\u2014had dismantled the morale of the elite enemies, causing them to fall apart.\u201cDrip, drip.\u201dThick scarlet blood and white bone fragments slid off the deformed and ruined armour. Fei left a shocking trail of blood as he walked forward. It felt like Fei was walking through a garden; there wasn\u2019t any noise or violence. However, the enemies were devastated and fled like the plague. They were retreating so quickly that although the supervising team tried to execute the escaping soldiers, they couldn\u2019t stop them. Some enemies even rushed up towards the executing supervising team to escape faster\u2026\u2026\u201cAHHHHH\u2026\u2026Archers, shoot him! Quick! Shoot him!!\u201dAfter seeing Landes beheaded by that \u2018Iron Beast\u2019, the silver masked knight almost fainted. He screamed at the archers harshly.Seeing the large gap on the bridge, he felt defeated. He knew that there was no reason to fight anymore today. Chambord was now an invincible castle. To the silver masked knight, he had thousands of ways to conquer Chambord easily, but somehow he didn\u2019t know why he had lost so tragically. He felt that his strategies were very carefully planned out. He utilized all his resources properly and didn\u2019t underestimate the enemies\u2026\u2026But he lost, and his troops suffered a heavy loss.After staring at the figure who was slowly walking up the half collapsed bridge without any soldiers daring to stop him, the silver masked knight suddenly realized that he had ignored something important in this battle \u2013 He never thought that the enemy king\u2019s strength could improve this fast. The king was only barely able to force Landes to back off yesterday, but now the king was able to invincibly charge into his formations and behead Landes with a single strike.\u201cGoing from one star rank to three star rank?\u201dNo one could have thought of that, but it was a weight that could change the balance of the scale of victory. All of the silver masked knight\u2019s strategies had turned into Fei\u2019s advantages\u2026\u2026 If he had known that Fei had a strength similar to a three star warrior, he wouldn\u2019t have positioned all of his formations on the thin bridge .\u201cBut, how?\u201d\u201cCould it be \u2026\u2026 that man increased two star ranks in a single night?\u201dThe silver masked knight\u2019s pupil contracted. He was shocked by his hypothesis. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then what kind of monster is this man? Is he the reincarnation of God of War himself?\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t let a man like this live on, or else\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter thinking about the reign of terror that could occur if the enemy\u2019s strength was fully developed, an unprecedented fear overtook the silver masked knight\u2019s mind, and a cold sweat covered his body. The mysterious mage\u2019s wish of keeping Fei alive was thrown out of his mind, and he screamed at the arrow piercing formation, \u201cFollow my command, shoot the piercing arrows\u2026\u2026Shoot him down! Quick\u2026\u2026quick, quick, quick! Right now! Quick!\u201d\u201cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u201dThis was probably the only command that the silver masked knight sent in this battle that was on time and effective. After his command, numerous bowstrings were drawn, and they left a series of afterimages from their vibrations. In the sounds of the vibrations, many huge black piercing arrows were shot into the air; like a crowd of bloodsucking leeches, they grinned as they covered the entire sky over the top of the bridge.\u201cShit!\u201dAfter seeing this, the mysterious mage in the black energy cloud shouted angrily. He was planning to capture that beast alive and obtain his secret of easily switching between powers, but after this round of arrow rain, even if the beast was made out of iron, he wouldn\u2019t have any life left inside him.On the half collapsed bridge.Fei suddenly raised his head and saw the sky covering arrow rain; it felt like the call from the Grim Reaper\u2026\u2026the enemy commander didn\u2019t care that his own soldiers were on the bridge and would be caught up in the arrow rain.Facing this danger, he lifted his left arm and covered up his handsome face with the \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011. Then, \u201cTink! Tink! Tink! Tink!\u201d like many hammers smashing against his body, painful sensations overwhelmed his nervous system\u2026\u2026At the same time, on the bridge.Many black armoured enemies wailed as they fell down under the arrows of their fellow soldiers. Like the saplings under the axe of a lumberjack, they were instantly shot down without any resistance. Blood spilled everywhere and the sounds of wailing and crying were louder than the whizzing of the current. The lethal arrows pierced through the enemy soldiers\u2019 eyes, thighs, heads, chest, and feet\u2026\u2026 Some severely injured, but not yet dead soldiers wailed as they tried to crawl back to their base, dragging along with them a long trail of blood.The bridge became a literal hell.Further away, the silver masked knight stood on a hill on the south bank of the Zuli River and watched everything tensely. The blood, wailing and cursing of his own soldiers entered his vision and ears, but were filtered out instantly. The only thing that he cared about was the figure.But what made him angry and scared at the same time was that after the first round of arrow rain, the monster that was fully armoured and covered in blood all over his body was swinging his sword and circular shield. He was struggling to block the arrows, but he wasn\u2019t injured fatally.\u201cArchers, don\u2019t stop, keep on shooting!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u201dThe arrows covered the sky like \u201cdark clouds\u201d with pointed tips, almost like stars at nighttime, flying towards the bridge.\u201cTink!Tink!Tink!Tink!\u201dThese arrows made for penetrating armor were harvesting all the lives wherever they were falling. The arrow heads were like the tip of the Grim Reaper\u2019s sickle and had pierced through all the armor and obstacles in their way, even denting huge holes on the bridge.The arrows had no emotions, they whizzed down on the bridge volley after volley, endlessly killing every soldier left.Soon, there weren\u2019t any lives on the bridge. The enemy soldiers who were wounded and whining and crying moments earlier couldn\u2019t be more dead now. Every corpse had a ton of arrows attached to it; the white fletching made them all look like hedgehogs.The silver masked knight stared at that figure.Finally, what he wanted to see happened \u2013 that demon had finally stopped moving. Arrows were pierced into every part of his body, he looked like a giant chicken with all the feathers from the arrows sticking out. Soon, \u201cTink!\u201d, the sword and shield fell out of his hands and disappeared when they hit the ground,and \u201cBam\u201d, that figure had finally collapsed to the ground..\u201cDead, Hahahaha! Finally dead\u2026\u2026He is finally dead!\u201dThe silver masked knight shivered as he laughed crazily. He stooped and teared up while continuing laughing, unclear if he was happy or sad. To the last, he continued laughing as he kneeled to the ground. His voice became hoarse and filled with madness as his laughing turned into crying\u2026\u2026His grasped the grass on the hill where he was standing with his hands; and tears rolled off of the silver mask uncontrollably.Finally dead.That man was finally dead.But his three thousand elite troops were also finished. Not only did they suffer heavy casualties, but the soldiers who survived were all frightened to death. They didn\u2019t have any courage left in them to hold their weapons and step on a battlefield again. What made him even more mad was that he had lost more than half of his personal black knights who were all one star warriors, not even mentioning that the three-star warrior Landes also lost his life in the battle.The silver masked knight was pushed to the verge of mental breakdown by that beast.On the battlefield, after seeing that figure had finally fallen down, the enemy soldiers all held on to their neck and started breathing heavily, as if the Grim Reaper had let go of his grasp on their lives. The mountain like pressure that was on their minds had finally lifted and the shadow of death disappeared. Some enemy soldiers went insane. They laughed as the tears rolled down their faces.Before this, they could never imagine that one man, only one man could dismantle an entire army.The mysterious mage was enraged, but after he saw the collapsed expression on the silver masked knight\u2019s face from afar, he held back his anger and decided not to argue with him. After thinking and changing expressions, he order a couple transfixed soldiers beside him: \u201cYou guys, go move that corpse and bring it to my tent.\u201dThe majesty of a mage had called back the souls of the soldiers who were almost going to break down. Quickly, a couple strong soldiers rushed over to the corpse that was full of penetration arrows, lifted it up, and followed the mysterious mage back to his tent.The corpse was heavy. With the ruined metal armor and arrows, it weighed almost three hundred pounds. The couple enemy soldiers who were carrying the corpse were sweating; they didn\u2019t even dare to look at the corpse. The murderous sensation from the corpse was shattering their souls causing the soldiers who were following the mage to shake uncontrollably.\u201cYou guys can leave now. Doesn\u2019t matter what happens in here, don\u2019t let anyone in and disturb me.\u201dAfter they had arrived at a black, gloomy tent, the mage ordered the soldiers to put the corpse in the middle of the tent and told them to leave. The soldiers felt like they had being given an amnesty and rushed out of the tent as if they were running for their lives. The air in the tent smelled damp and musty, and was faintly mixed with the smell of rancid corpses. Weirdly shaped sharp tools and bottles were hanging from everywhere. The whole place felt like a slaughterhouse and none of the enemy soldiers wanted to stay in there for even one second.The mysterious mage closed the curtain to the tent. He also carefully placed a couple small defensive magic arrays at the entrance as security. Then a blue flame flew out of his hand and ignited the brazier hanging off of the middle of the tent. The blue flame was fainting and flickering. Although there was a fire, the tent was still filled with coldness; everything felt creepy as the hell.\u201cHoo, hoo, hoohooo\u2026\u2026\u201dThe mysterious mage;s laughter sounded like an owl. A greedy light shined in his eyes as he stared at the corpse on the ground. He spoke to himself with a slight regret: \u201cToo bad we didn\u2019t capture him alive\u2026\u2026 But fortunately I had acquired some undead magic, maybe I could figure out the secret to switching powers from dissecting his corpse. Hoo hooo hoo\u2026\u2026 After getting this secret, I might be able to break through the bottleneck of the four star rank that had been holding me back for many years and advance to the five star rank. Advancing to the moon rank wouldn\u2019t be just a dream anymore, Hohohooo!\u201dHis laughed hoarsely. Stooping his back and not being able to wait any longer, he touched the armor on the corpse with his withered bamboo like finger and was about to take it off and started dissecting\u2026\u2026But when he turned the corpse around strenuously so it was facing upward and laid his finger on the buckle of the armour, his smile froze and an unprecedented shock came on his face.Even though the mysterious mage was powerful and thoughtful, he was trembling in fear.It wasn\u2019t because he was timid \u2013Any one would freak out if they saw a corpse suddenly smiling at them. The mage\u2019s nerves reacted normally.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026Impossible\u2026\u2026You are still alive?\u201dThe mage shouted as if he saw a ghost, but he quickly shivered in fear.What was going to happen when a monstrous warrior was that close to a defenseless mage? The mage\u2019s face turned pale. A dense cloud of energy appeared out of nowhere and started to spread throughout the entire tent rapidly. The mage wanted to protect his body, like a drowning hapless guy would try to climb up on a tiny piece of floating wood. To a mage, they had to protect their weak bodies with their magic powers, it was almost an involuntary reaction.A series of obscure syllables float out of his mouth, but\u2026\u2026\u201cBam -!One punch from Fei had stopped the mage\u2019s effort for protecting himself. The low magic chanting was cut off, as if a someone was strangling a crowing rooster. Next, the black cloud of energy suddenly disappeared.The mage\u2019s mouth was wide open.Transparent saliva and white spit sprayed out of his mouth which had been chanting majestic magic spells a second earlier. Like an assaulted virgin, an unbelieving expression came on his face as he held tight onto one of his body parts \u2013 His crotch.\u201cDamn! So the Dong is really the weakest part of a man!\u201dFei laughed as he blew at his fist and thought shamelessly. Although he was laughing, he didn\u2019t forget to seize the opportunity; he jumped up and kick the mage\u2019s crotch again forcefully.The mage\u2019s body stiffed up after that kick. The deep hoarse growl akin to a dying beast came from his throat and he fell backwards onto the ground. The black cloak fell off of his body and an emaciated, skeleton like face appeared. He was so pale and skinny that his skin was stretched tight over his skull. There was not even a single hair growing on his head.Due to the beating of the vital body part, the poor four star ranked mage\u2019s face turned from white to black, then to green\u2026\u2026The powerful four star ranked mage was tearing up due to the pain. He crouched like a cooked shrimp and rolled on the ground, but fainted quickly.\u201cDAMN, pretending to be dead like me?\u201dFei couldn\u2019t believe that he took care of a four star mage this easily. To make sure that this \u201chuman skeleton\u201d wasn\u2019t pretending the faint, he walked up to the mage, after thinking for a couple seconds, he spit and he smiled evilly as kicked the mage\u2019s crotch again.\u201cCrack\u201d, Fei heard a light sound, it sounded like some sort of egg had shattered.\u201cLooks like he really fainted.\u201dFei was relieved. His tensed up nerves relaxed as the pressure on his mind disappeared. He felt a lot more at ease and sat on the ground as he took some deep breaths.Everything went so smoothly, it was far beyond Fei\u2019s expectation.During the battle, after seeing the appearance of the enemy\u2019s strong archers, Fei suddenly had an idea \u2013 faking the death. He had a layer of the heavy metal armour, and also could call up the armor of the level 12 Barbarian \u2013 Especially the \u3010Arctic Fur\u3011in the \u3010Arctic Gear\u3011. That armor had a ton of defense; with the two layers of armour, surviving under the arrows wasn\u2019t going to be a huge problem. Next, only if Fei could get into the enemy base and sneak attack the four star mage out of the blue, he had fifty, sixty percent chance of taking out the powerful mage.Fei was worrying about how to get near the enemy mage to sneak attack, who knew that the mage was really unfortunate, and was seeking his own death. He ordered the soldiers to carry Fei\u2019s body into his tent and wanted to touch Fei \u201cobscenely\u201d.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The piercing arrows were very effective and even left many dents in the \u3010Arctic Fur\u3011. The force from the arrows passing through the armour had damaged Fei\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026Faking death is actually very practical!\u201dFei took out the \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 from his belt and took a sip. His injuries recovered quickly and the pain that was seeped deep into the bones disappeared. He didn\u2019t dare drink the whole bottle; there was about one sixth of the potion left when he put it back into his storage belt.After he recovered, Fei began to observe the black and dark tent. The air had a stench as if numerous creatures\u2019 corpses had been rotting and fermenting here. Under the flickering light of the blue flame, it felt quiet and horrible.Fei\u2019s eyes finally landed on a couple of black ropes. His eyes shined as a great idea came to mind. He decided to tie the fainted mage up. He didn\u2019t want to kill this poor mage; in his eyes, a living four star mage was far more valuable than his corpse. As long as the mage was under his control, all kinds of information in the mage\u2019s brain was a treasure. Chambord was only a kingdom in a remote area on the continent. There were many things about the Azeroth Continent that Brook and Lampard couldn\u2019t even explain. Fei wanted to get more information directly from the mage\u2019s mouth.Fei grabbed the ropes and started to laugh evilly, \u201cHahahaha! How should I tie up this old bastard?\u201dTying up prisoners was a highly technical job. If they weren\u2019t tied up properly, the prisoner could easily get loose and escape. But due to Fei\u2019s expertise from watching 18+ S&M movies, it wasn\u2019t a problem at all for him. Fei didn\u2019t mind putting the theories in his mind to the test.After a few minutes.\u201cPhew, finally!\u201d Fei clapped his hands as he looked at his \u201cproject\u201d.The poor four star mage was tied into a \u201chuman rice dumpling\u201d. Fei used six ropes and demonstrated twelve tying methods. He made a huge knot when the rope was going around the mage\u2019s face and stuffed it into the mage\u2019s mouth. That way, even if the mage woke up later, he wouldn\u2019t be able to chant any magic spells.Of course, that wasn\u2019t the end.Fei was a very alert person. To guarantee his safety, he found a stubby wooden stick and shamelessly and mercilessly stuck it into the mage\u2019s butthole. After that, he connected the stick and rope together; if the mage struggled even a little bit, the rope would move the stick and he would be r*ped continuously. That pain would cause even the toughest man to faint.Even after that, Fei still didn\u2019t feel secure enough. A four star mage was too powerful for him. What if that guy had ways to untie the ropes\u2026\u2026 After some thinking, Fei crushed the mage\u2019s bones and limbs. After seeing the fainted mage unconsciously struggle aggressively and a bunch of blood and foam coming out of his mouth, Fei knew that the mage wouldn\u2019t wake up any time soon, so he initiated his plan with a sneer on his face.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the enemy base.The remaining soldiers were packing up their belongings and were getting ready to retreat quickly. Ten minutes ago, a scout rushed back to the base and reported that the scout team had discovered the traces of the Zenit Empire\u2019s troops. It was almost certain that they were heading in the direction of Chambord. It forced the silver masked knight to give up the siege on Chambord Castle\u2014the silver masked knight knew very well that the reinforcements from the Zenit Empire would be a great excuse for him to retreat. After the bridge had collapsed, there was no way that his army could take down Chambord Castle.On top of that, almost all of his soldiers didn\u2019t want to fight near that castle anymore. What happened today had destroyed the elite soldiers\u2019 courage; all they wanted to do was to leave this demonic land and never see that castle across the river again within their lifetime.Everyone in the base was rushing to get things packed, making it look very chaotic. Outside the mage\u2019s tent were two enemy soldiers. They were the guards that the silver masked knight gifted to his teacher. Both of them stood tall and strong; they were afraid that if they slacked off, the mage might find out. Before today, fourteen soldiers had been taken by the mage as lab rats for his experiments for that very reason. Those fourteen poor souls had definitely suffered unimaginable torture before their deaths. They screamed and wailed like wild beasts, causing all the soldiers in the base to have nightmares.Both of them wished for this siege to be over soon. Once the troops retreated, they would\u2019t have to guard this demon-like mage anymore.At this moment \u2013\u201cHula \u2013 \u201cThe thick curtain that covered the entrance of the tent opened and someone stepped out.Both of the guards quickly turned around to bow and salute. But when they saw the face of the man who had just stepped out, they felt cold. Their faces turned pale, their mouths started mumbling and their teeth chattered and made a series of brittle sounds. Their tongues almost fell off and they couldn\u2019t say a word.\u201cPlop!\u201dAfter a few seconds of trembling, one of the soldier\u2019s eyes turned white and he fainted due to shock. The other soldier was better, but his body was also shaking as if he was trying to shake lice off of himself. He pointed his finger as if he had seen an undead, and his mind was completely blank. He was a little bit envious of his fainted colleague; he didn\u2019t know what to do and had to face the demon half consciously.\u201cHey man, I\u2019m lost. Which tent is your boss living at?\u201d Fei was afraid that the soldier in front of him was also going to faint. He put on a smile he considered friendly and bright and asked the soldier with his most sincere voice as he lightly tapped the soldier\u2019s shoulder.The soldier was shaking uncontrollably and couldn\u2019t utter a word. He trembled as he slowly pointed his finger at the big black tent about fifty yards (m) away, and \u201cPlop!\u201d fainted as he had wished.\u201cPooh!\u201dFei looked at the tent further away and spit on the ground. Although the enemy soldiers were everywhere, he didn\u2019t try to hide at all; he directly walked up to the tent. After taking care of the four star mage, none of the enemies could stop him.After a couple seconds, someone had finally discovered the rampaging Fei. However, no one yelled nor even made a sound.\u201cTink! Tink!\u201dIn the entire base, almost all the soldiers who had seen Fei started trembling in fear as their faces turned pale. They couldn\u2019t hang onto their weapons anymore, causing them to fall to the ground. As if they had all been petrified by a magic spell, none of them moved. They were all \u201cshake dancing\u201d in unison as they watched Fei walk up to the big black tent in the middle of the base.The atmosphere was quiet, yet strange.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026On the Chambord defensive wall.\u201cOh God\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cImpossible\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cKing Alexander\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter seeing the piercing arrows cover up the collapsed bridge, many people started crying instantly. Their tears made their faces super wet and they had to hold onto one another to stand, as if their stamina had been sucked away. Lampard didn\u2019t say a word; he jumped off of the defensive wall. Emma fainted in the arms of Angela, and Angela\u2019s face was as pale as snow.The sun in the sky had suddenly lost its brightness.Everyone on the defensive wall felt the world had turned dark, as if something magnificent had suddenly collapsed.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They all rushed down the defensive wall and ran towards the castle gates. Everyone wanted to get onto the collapsed bridge. Even if they ended up dying, they still wanted to bring their king back. No one believed that their king who was blessed by the God of War was dead. He had to be alive; he just had to be!In the crowd, only a few people were standing still quietly; they all had different expressions, but their excitement leaked through their eyes. Head Minister Bazzer was standing under the watchtower and was having a hard time holding back his delight, \u201cGreat! He\u2019s finally dead!\u201d Honestly, the strength that Alexander had shown in that battle greatly shocked and threatened him. He didn\u2019t expect that the retarded teenage king could have that kind of power, \u201cWas Alexander\u2019s retarded behaviour from before all an act?\u201d Bazzer would have a cold sweat every time he thought about that. The more he looked at the invincible figure on the bridge, the more he became terrified\u2026\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s perfect! Alexander was killed in the hands of the enemies and the collapse of the bridge means that the enemies can\u2019t threat Chambord anymore. It\u2019s just like killing two bird with one stone! My upcoming plans can be perfectly executed now.\u201dBeside Bazzer, the fatty Gill had a big smile on his face.\u201cAlexander, you idiot! You\u2019re finally dead, hahaha. Idiots will always be idiots. Even though you became normal, all you knew was to charge like a dumb pig and risk your life for those lowlife citizens. See, you got shut down by all the arrows!\u201dGill turned his head and stared at Angela. He licked his lips as an obscene and vicious look came on his face. His eyes were filled with craze; If Brook wasn\u2019t guarding Angela closely, Gill wouldn\u2019t have waited and would\u2019ve done something already\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the huge black tent located in the middle of the enemy base.The silver masked knight was sitting on the stone chair in the middle of the tent powerlessly. He looked at the remaining nine black knights and said in a deep voice, \u201cGet ready to retreat. Kill all the severely wounded soldiers that can\u2019t make it; we can\u2019t let the Zenit Empire know that we\u2019ve been here. Clean up the battlefield carefully and don\u2019t leave behind any trace\u2026\u2026I swear, one day, I Mateja-Kezman will lead the iron cavalry of Eindhoven and break this little kingdom into pieces!\u201dAs he was saying the last part, the silver masked knight squeezed his hand tightly and trembled in anger. But at this moment, something unexpected happened \u2013A sharp gust of air whizzed from far away and cut the whole tent into two pieces. The tent collapsed onto the two sides, causing the bright sunlight to shine through and reveal everything inside the tent.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t have a chance to go back.\u201dAn apathetic voice sounded in the distance. The silver masked knight\u2019s pupil suddenly contracted. He discovered in fear that the monstrous figure that was supposed to be dead was approaching him slowly, step by step. The bloody murderous sensation pressured him more and more, and he was having a hard time breathing.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d The silver masked knight had an inconceivable expression on his face, \u201cYou didn\u2019t die?\u201d\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t die. Hehe, that means you\u2019ll have to die!\u201dFei moved closer and closer. He looked as sharp as a knife. This was the first time he had seen the silver masked knight, but from the luxurious clothing and the way the knight was protected in the middle of the black knights, it was obvious that the man wearing the silver mask was the commander of the enemies\u2014and the culprit for the sieges and the death of hundreds of Chambord citizens and soldiers. Fei couldn\u2019t ever let someone whose hands had been bathed in so much blood go.Fei didn\u2019t sense any large energy fluctuations from the silver masked knight, so he estimated that the silver masked knight was around two star ranked. That kind of power was no threat to Fei at all. He was confident that he could kill the silver masked knight with a single strike.The surrounding soldiers didn\u2019t dare come any closer. The silver masked knight and the black knights to his right seemed so weak compared to Fei.\u201cGo, kill him!\u201d The silver masked knight yelled as he pointed his hand. The eight black knights didn\u2019t hesitate and roared as they charged at Fei. Although they knew that they would probably die, under their strict discipline and the silver masked knight\u2019s coercion, they didn\u2019t dare to think twice.\u201cDie \u2013 !\u201dFei\u2019s expression turned cold and he sped up. His body left a series of afterimages in the air. As he was about to collide into the black knights, a white light flashed and the Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 and \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 appeared in his hands. Then, a 180\u00ba half-spin, causing the golden sword to turn into a flash of gold light.\u201cPllkkkcchhhh!\u201dAfter eight light sounds, the eight black knights froze in their positions. Fei didn\u2019t slow down a single bit. He turned into a frantic tornado and swept towards the silver masked knight. Although his expression was cold, a raging fire was burning in his heart.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ll kill you myself!\u201dThe silver masked knight reluctantly gathered his courage. Blue magic power shined around his body. He condense a spiky ice ball about the size of a basketball and shot the ice ball towards Fei. At the same time, a series of icicles appeared and rotated around him, forming into an ice shield.Instant attack and defense. The silver masked knight was a two star ice mage. From his moves, Fei could tell that he had a lot of practical combat experience; he made the best decision in a split second.\u201cBam!\u201dThe ice ball accurately hit Fei.An ecstatic expression appeared on the silver masked knight\u2019s face. As long as the ice ball could numb his opponent\u2019s body and slow his movements for a little while, he could use numerous magic devices and chant many magic spells to easily take down his most hated opponent.However \u2013That charging \u201ctornado\u201d didn\u2019t slow down at all. With an impressive speed, Fei arrived in front of the silver masked knight instantly. In the silver masked knight\u2019s eyes, the golden sword symbolized the call from the Grim Reaper, and it pierced him continuously.\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\u2026\u2026\u201dUnder such a dangerous situation, the silver masked knight roared like an injured bear. His magic power floated out of his body crazily and formed into numerous icicles and rotated around him rapidly, forming into layers and layers of ice shields. All he wanted to do was block the lethal attacks from that golden sword. However, he was terrified; he blocked off the golden sword for a little bit, but after having a taste of blood, it pierced through the ice shields like lightning.\u201cPlik!\u201dThe golden sword was merciless and pierced through the silver masked knight\u2019s throat.The next moment, the last strand of life disappeared from those eyes under the silver mask. The silver masked knight couldn\u2019t believe it. Even until the his last moment, could it possibly be that he, the high and majestic prince who was going to inherit the throne of an empire and leave his legacies on the Azeroth Continent, was going to\u2026\u2026die in a place like this?\u201cPooh\u2026\u2026Wearing a mask? You wannabe!\u201dFei grabbed the handle of the \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 tightly as he spit at the silver masked knight disdainfully. He didn\u2019t worry about the ice chips that were on his body. He kicked the silver masked knight\u2019s corpse as he pulled out his sword. He glanced scornfully at the surrounding enemies who were staring blankly. At the same time, the eight black knights who were standing still in their positions fell down\u2014their lives had already been plundered by the \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011.\u201cHurry up and get the f**k out of here!\u201d Fei suddenly roared.The thousands of enemies felt like they had been pardoned when they were standing in front of an execution. They screamed as they turned around and escaped from Fei; all of them wished that they were born with two more legs so that they could run faster\u2026\u2026At this moment, a loud bugle sounded on the plain from further away. A large formation of cavalry charged in the direction of Chambord. Looking from afar, it felt like the cavalry were like darks clouds and were creating an earthquake.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He jumped up to a higher hill and took a glance. Far away on the horizon where the blue sky and the green plains met, numerous elongated silver flags appeared. The flags fluttered in the wind and looked like flying silver dragons. Then, the ground started to shake and numerous silver armoured cavalry charged in the direction of Chambord like a huge tidal wave.\u201cFrom what I can see and feel, it seems that there are at least six hundred cavalry in this formation\u2026\u2026 are they help from the Zenit Empire or reinforcements of the silver masked knight?\u201dFei observed carefully. He quickly found out that the silver armoured cavalry that suddenly appeared didn\u2019t slow down their charges at all when they saw the defeated enemies, but rather started a merciless massacre under the sound of the loud bugles. Wherever the iron horseshoes stomped, blood and flesh flew into the air. The blades and lances penetrated the enemies; it was like letting hungry tigers into a cage of sheep. The one thousand enemies screamed and whined, but they had no strength to fight back; it was a one-sided battle.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026great, it looks like they\u2019re the aid sent from the Zenit Empire.\u201d Fei was a little relieved. He thought about something and jumped off of the hill. He returned to the mysterious mage\u2019s tent and was surprised to find out that there were some signs of struggling. It was obvious that the four star mage had woken up and tried to break the ropes. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t successful at all\u2014Fei\u2019s sickening tying method proved useful. The poor mage was anally decimated, and his blood stained the ground. It seemed that the wooden stick moved when the mage was struggling, so he had fainted again due to the unbearable pain.Fei lifted the fainted mage off of the ground and walked towards the collapsed black tent where the silver masked knight was at. Fei put the mage together with silver masked knight\u2019s corpse, then he cut off a big piece of cloth from the tent with the \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011. He wrapped the mage and the corpse together into a big package and put it beside him.After doing that, he stood on the plains and looked at the aid sent from the Zenit Empire. At that time, the cavalry with their shiny armour were still rotating and charging to wipe out the remaining enemies. About twenty cavalries split off and charged in Fei\u2019s direction.Fei was about to ask them something, but he saw that the cavalry didn\u2019t slow down when they saw him; rather, they laughed as they sped up their horses and yelled arrogantly. The lances in their hands were raised and shined with a murderous light under the sun. The tips of their lances were still dripping with the enemies\u2019 blood and they were now aimed at Fei.\u201cDamn! Did these dumbasses mistake me for one of the defeated enemies?\u201dFei was dumbfounded. As he was about to shout and explain himself, the knight in luxurious armour who was leading the charge suddenly laughed as he turned his body and threw his lance at Fei using the momentum of his charging horse. The two yard (m) long lance whizzed as it tore through the air and aimed at Fei directly.\u201cTink!\u201dFei\u2019s expression turned cold. He raised his left arm and the \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 lightly tapped on the lances; the fierce lance was re-directed into the sky. Fei felt that the knight who threw the lance wasn\u2019t even a one star warrior. That level of attack he put out wasn\u2019t threatening at all to a level 12 Barbarian.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026you dare resist? Go stomp him into meat paste!\u201dThe luxuriously armed knight didn\u2019t expect that his most accurate attack would be so easily dealt with by a \u2018defeated enemy\u2019 who was covered in blood. After a brief moment of surprise, he felt his prestige being challenged.\u201cTink!\u201d He was enraged as he pulled out his sword from his waist and shouted as he pointed the sword at Fei. He and the dozen cavalry behind him kicked their horses with the spurs on their iron boots. The horses felt the pain and suddenly sped up and rushed towards Fei aggressively.They wanted to send the enemy in front of them into the air.\u201cWait\u2026\u2026Stop! I\u2019m from Chambord, I\u2019m not an enemy!\u201dFei had no way but to shout and explain himself.Who knew that the luxuriously armed knight who was leading the charge didn\u2019t rein the horses to slow down after he heard Fei\u2019s shout. He lowered his head and accelerated the horse even more. The cavalry behind him did the same; they all had excited and mocking smiles on their faces, and the way they looked Fei was no different than looking at an idiot and a dead person.\u201cDamn, this isn\u2019t right\u2026\u2026These bastards want to kill me on purpose.\u201dFei\u2018s heart sunk a little as he smelled something fishy. After looking at the taunting smile on the knight and cavalry\u2019s faces, Fei knew that words wouldn\u2019t solve any problems. He sneered as he positioned the \u3010Azure Spiked Shield\u3011 onto his shoulder and bumped directly and aggressively into the charging knight and cavalry.\u201cSons of b*tches, let\u2019s see who\u2019s tougher!\u201d Their provocation had angered Fei.Quickly, the one man and fourteen horses collided with each other head on.\u201cBoom, boom, boom, boom, boom!\u201dA series of loud muffled noises sounded as if they were smashing into a firm defensive wall. Filled disbelief, they were slammed off of their horses and fell to the ground hideously and couldn\u2019t stop crying and screaming. The leading knight was especially worse off as he turned into a soccer ball and kept rolling on the ground. His luxurious suit of armour was covered in blood and dirt; his helmet was lost and his face was so dirty that he looked like a homeless beggar that hadn\u2019t taken a shower in years.The dozen horses were flipped onto the ground and struggled to get back up.Fei turned around and stood still. He didn\u2019t say a word; he just sneered at the knight and the cavalry who were struggling to get up. His expression was filled with disdain; it felt like a dragon was staring at a couple of dogs who dared to challenge him. It made the knight and cavalry feel so resentful that they almost vomited blood.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d The leading knight pointed his finger at Fei, \u201cYou reckless bastard, how dare you attack the knights of the Zenit Empire? Ahhhhhhh, you are dead\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Although he was yelling arrogantly and ferociously, none of them dared to charge at Fei. His domineering act of consecutively knocking over a dozen charging horses almost made them crap their pants.Fei had nothing to say.\u201cAre you a dumb pig? You shot your lance at me first and wanted to stomp me into a meat paste because you had more men\u2026\u2026If I didn\u2019t defend myself, should I have stood here quietly and let you kill me?\u2026\u2026So it\u2019s reasonable for you to kill me, but if I block you then I\u2019m a dead man?\u201dThe botched manners and poor performance of these reinforcements suddenly wiped out all the interest Fei had in the aid from the Zenit Empire. He picked up the cloth package containing the mage and the silver masked knight\u2019s corpse and walked back to Chambord Castle without saying a word.\u201cDon\u2019t leave if you dare, you bastard\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough the luxuriously armed knight was pretty scared, his didn\u2019t shut his mouth. After seeing the opponent backing off, his courage was reignited and he pointed at Fei and cursed and provoked him.Fei stopped and turned around; his expression was as cold as the arctic.\u201cIf you say even one more word, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dAt that moment, Fei really had killing intent. Because they were the help sent from his Parent Empire \u2013 Zenit, Fei didn\u2019t want to make a big fuss about these dumb knights. But who knew that they would return in high spirits and provoke him again. After Fei said that, the \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 flashed a golden light. If those knights said anything more, he would show them hell.Suddenly, a soaring bloody and murderous sensation was violently emitted from Fei\u2019s body.Including the continuous killings in the Diablo World and real world, no one knew how many monsters, demons and enemies died under Fei\u2019s blade. Fei was literally stepping on mountains of corpses and seas of bloods for the last couple days. The murderous sensation had condensed in his body, and it almost became a tangible substance. Now, it soared into the sky and was as sharp as a knife when dismantling the opponent\u2019s courage and morale.The cavalry shut their mouths in fright; the leading knight who was the most arrogant of the bunch turned mute. Cold sweat dripped down his forehead as he felt the threat of death in the opponent\u2019s cold eyes; he felt like he was in a freezer. He knew what Fei said wasn\u2019t just a threat; he had no doubt that if he said anything more, he would definitely be killed.\u201cPooh! Coward!\u201d Fei swore and scorned. He walked back to Chambord with the huge package in his hands. He knew that everyone on the defensive wall had seen his fake death. He couldn\u2019t imagine how sad and worried everyone must\u2019ve been, especially Angela and Brook. He knew that if would definitely be in chaos, so Fei had to rush back to comfort everyone.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were a lot of people standing on the other side of gap trying to get across\u2026\u2026Fei\u2019s heart was warmed. He used the Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Leap\u3011; like a giant bird, he whizzed in the air and reached the sixteen to seventeen yard (m) gap in a couple of jumps. He didn\u2019t pause and used another \u3010Leap\u3011 to jump over the huge gap with the big package in his hand, and landed in the crowd on the other side.\u201cIt\u2019s King Alexander\u2026\u2026\u201d someone cheered.\u201cHaha, I, blacksmith Harry knew you that were still alive, haha! How could those cowardly dog sh*ts hurt you!\u201d An old white haired man was excited to the point of tears after he saw Fei.\u201cKing Alexander, you\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026 amazing! Bless you\u2026..Thank the God of War for blessing my king!\u201d A couple paupers who were holding farming tools as weapons kneeled down and prayed to thank the God of War for protecting their king.After a moment of surprise, all the strongmen including Pierce and Drogba threw away the ropes they were trying use to get across the gap and rushed to Fei, crying as they clung onto his legs. Twenty or so fully armoured tough men who were covered in blood and didn\u2019t even frown when the blades and lances of the enemies penetrated their bodies were now crying like little kids.Further away on the defensive wall.Head Minister Bazzer\u2019s thin and dry body started to wobble as he saw that scene. He felt his vision darken and gold stars started to appear in front of him. His mouth was wide open, exposing his yellowish-black teeth. His gray hair was messed up by the blowing wind and he murmured to himself dully, \u201cImpossible\u2026\u2026This is impossible\u2026\u2026He\u2019s still alive\u2026\u2026How\u2026\u2026Is he a monster? Still alive after being penetrated by hundreds of arrows? DAMN, DAMN, DAMN! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201dThe old man felt like he was about to go crazy. Gill who was gloating on the side felt like he lost the strength in his legs and fell on his butt. \u201cAlexander isn\u2019t dead\u2026\u201d The fatty\u2019s sharp intuition told him that, \u201cShit! My luck is about to disappear, big trouble is about to come!\u201dUnder the watchtower.\u201cHum\u2026\u2026\u201d Angela slowly awakened, still in sorrow like a withering lily who hadn\u2019t even bloomed. Her eyes dimmed as they lost their luster. After hearing the cheers on the bridge, she turned her head and looked at the bridge through her eyes that were still blurred by her tears. But at that moment, her sight was fixed. The girl\u2019s heart started to beat unquenchably; she saw the familiar and resolute figure standing on the bridge through her blurred vision. The sad girl quickly rubbed her eyes in astonishment\u2026\u2026 \u201cOh God of War, it\u2019s really him!!\u201dLiveliness and brilliance suddenly returned to the girl\u2019s soft and weak body.\u201cAlexander\u2026\u2026\u201dAngela whispered and tears rolled off of her face uncontrollable. Despite crying once more, this time her tears were not those of heartbreak, but instead those of joy. She suddenly stood up, wiped off her tears quickly, picked up the edge of her long dress and ran off of the defensive wall like a happy bird in spite of Brook and Lampard blocking the path to protect her.\u201cI have to go see him!\u201d The beautiful girl said to herself.She had walked through the path from Chambord to the stone bridge countless times; watching the sunrises and sunsets on the defensive wall or the bridge to pray for the poor Alexander was something she often did. However, she never felt that the path was this long.She wished that she could teleport to the man\u2019s arms instantly.\u201cHey! Watch your steps\u2026\u2026Angela\u2026\u2026Slow down\u2026\u2026 Relax, wait for me!\u201dEmma was smiling and yelling behind Angela. She skipped as she followed her; the golden ponytail on her head bounced up and down. This bright and happy scene gave Chambord\u2019s number one warrior Lampard a big smile. A few moments ago, after seeing Fei turn into a white porcupine by all the arrows, Lampard was shocked and jumped off of the defensive wall selflessly to rush over to the other side of the bridge\u2026\u2026But during the process, he suddenly remembered Fei\u2019s request to protect Angela. After a moment of hesitation, he quickly returned to Angela\u2019s side to protect her.Thank god that Angela was okay. At that key moment, Brook was beside her, guarding her vigilantly.Now, everything was good. Alexander returned alive and the enemies were defeated and madly retreating. The reinforcements from the parent Zenit Empire had also arrived. All of Chambord\u2019s dangers were instantly removed. It was the happiest ending.After Lampard thought about it, his usual calm \u201cdead\u201d face couldn\u2019t help but reveal a big bright smile. It was the first time that he smiled this happily in the past couple years. He looked at Head Minister Bazzer\u2014who was not too far away and as gloomy as a dark cloud\u2014with that smile on his face. His provocation was clear.Bazzer could only \u2018humph\u2019 silently.\u2026\u2026On the south bank of the Zuli River.The hundreds of cavalry sped towards the river bank and stopped after they had wiped out the thousand or so retreating enemies. A huge red carriage that was being pulled by eight horses side by side slowly pulled up and separated the crowd. The carriage was giant; it was at least three yards (m) long and was supported by four huge delicate wooden wheels. The carriage looked like it was carved as whole from a huge natural timber. Thorny floral patterns were engraved onto the carriage and the birds on it were lifelike. There were two small ventilated windows on both sides of the carriage. What was most surprising was that carriage navigator was a shiny armoured knight, and he looked powerful.After seeing the arrival of the carriage, the luxuriously armoured knight who Fei had knocked down scrambled as he rushed to the carriage and held onto the shaft. He cried as he lied and exaggerated about what just happened, \u201cSis. Tanasha, that damn guy insulted the dignity of the Zenit Empire, he even insulted you\u2026\u2026you can\u2019t go easy on him.\u201dThe carriage was silent for a couple seconds.Next, a weak and soft voice replied, \u201cJimmy, you\u2019re the one who provoked him, right? Now you\u2019ve finally met a warrior that doesn\u2019t care about your identity as the young prince of Zenit. Let your suffering this time teach you something. Don\u2019t ever provoke anyone again\u2026\u2026I told you many times that to become a true knight, individual strength and military feats are far from enough. Humility, honesty, compassion, courage, justice, sacrifice, honour and spirit\u2026 after you remember these eight criteria, you just might be able to become a real knight.\u201dThe weak voice sounded like the person had just recovered from a long term illness. However, it had the power to penetrate through people\u2019s minds; the girl named Tanasha revealed the little prince Jimmy-Tropinski\u2019s lies and also taught her good-for-nothing little brother a lesson.Little prince Tropinski was planning to teach that savage who dared to challenge his prestige a lesson through his sister\u2019s hands, but he tucked in his head under Tanasha\u2019s rebuke. He took his chances and argued again, \u201cBig sis. It wasn\u2019t me this time\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, that\u2019s the end of it. If you have any other opinions, I\u2019ll have to make the soldiers send you back\u2026\u2026\u201d The weak voice sounded again in the carriage and cut Tropinski off coldly. After a moment of silence, she said, \u201cAsk the butler Bast to come over politely.\u201dTropinski stood up moodily and quietly said to the soldier near him, \u201cGo bring that damn navigator over.\u201dThe soldier complied and walked away.Soon, the soldier brought back a middle aged man who was about forty years old. He was about six feet tall (180cm). His short black hair was fixed properly; with his bright eyes, tall nose, handsome face and proportionate body, although he was wearing a coarse robe, his leisurely postures made people feel like he was wearing the world\u2019s most expensive suit. Everyone could feel a refined grace and temperament from him. This man was definitely a super handsome guy when he was young. Although he was forty-ish now, he could still charm innocent young girls easily with his appearances.\u201cBast, you lowly \u201cnavigator\u201d. Go and tell your retarded king son-in-law that the canonization ambassador from Zenit Empire has arrived and get him to come out and kneel down to greet us\u2026\u2026\u201d Maybe it because of jealousy between the same sex, but the little prince Tropinski was angry every time he saw the calm middle aged handsome man. He ordered Bast and emphasized the word \u201cnavigator\u201d.\u201cAs you wish, your Royal Highness!\u201dThe middle aged Bast wasn\u2019t mad at all. He curved his waist gracefully and gave Tropinski a standard aristocratic salute, then walked towards Chambord at a moderate pace. The reasonable and decent attitude made the little prince feel like his behaviour was that of an uneducated hillbilly\u2019s; he felt so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. However, one thing that no one caught was that after Bast had turned around, he pointed his middle finger fiercely in front of the prince.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The worst case scenario didn\u2019t occur, and the black armoured enemies didn\u2019t conquer the castle\u2026\u2026\u201d When he thought about it, he sighed, \u201cThe number one warrior Lampard is here, so Bazzer couldn\u2019t do too much. Angela and that retarded king should be safe and sound.\u201dThe numerous ruined corpses and marks left on the wall from the intense battle struck terror into Bast. He didn\u2019t know how Chambord held up. It was a miracle; four hundred soldiers in the King\u2019s Guards were able to defend for five days against the siege of more than two thousand elite enemies?After he stepped onto the bridge, the calm, cool and collected Bast was finally stunned.\u201cOh God of War\u2026\u2026unbelievable! Breaking the stone bridge? Whose idea is this? Eh, Lampard and Brook are both strong-headed, there\u2019s no way that it was their idea\u2026\u2026Could it be Bazzer? Since when could that old dog do something good?\u201dBast lowered his head and thought.Suddenly, he heard the cheers on the other side of the partially collapsed bridge. That was when he noticed that numerous citizens of Chambord gathered on the side for some reason and were celebrating. Under the whizzing of the fast current, he faintly heard \u201cHail the King!\u201d, \u201cLong live His Majesty!\u201d and other similar shouts. Bast was a little surprised, \u201cHail the King? Eh\u2026\u2026 They aren\u2019t talking about the retarded Alexander, are they?\u201dBast quickened his steps and then he saw another shocking scene \u2013His beautiful and innocent daughter Angela was sprinting towards the bridge from the castle. She abandoned all her ladylike manners; like a beautiful butterfly fluttering in a trail of flowers, her face was all red and she was breathing heavily as she separated the crowd. She laughed and cried at the same time as she hugged and jumped into the arms of the young man wearing a ruined suit of armour and covered in blood.Bast couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes.\u201cGod! Since when did my pure and obedient baby Angela become this open and bold? Embracing an unfamiliar young man in public? Did she forget that she\u2019ll become the future queen of the kingdom? Or did something magical happen since I left Chambord?\u201dBast felt jumpy as he thought about it.He felt that he needed to remind his silly daughter to never be tricked by the playful and charming words of a young man. Bast rushed to the gap on the bridge and intentionally yelled, \u201cHey Angela, my sweetheart! I\u2019m back!\u201d\u2026\u2026On the other side of the collapsed bridge.Fei was enjoying the ecstatic feeling of the warm and soft hug. Although he was surprised that his beautiful fianc\u00e9e rushed out of the castle and jumped into his arms, after being stunned for a brief moment, he was full of joy. This guy thought to himself happily, \u201cHahaha, this should count as a perfect match, right? The hero and the beauty\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile Fei was so delighted that his teeth were almost falling off and he was holding back his drooling urges to just to feel the beauty in his arms, someone acted recklessly and made him feel really unpleasant by shouting, \u201cAngela, my sweetheart! I\u2019m back!\u201dFei was enraged.\u201cDamn!\u201d Who is this eyeless bastard? Who dares to flirt with my girl so blatantly?\u201dThe fire of anger started to burn unstoppably in Fei who was getting extremely jealous. Fei glanced around furiously and looked across the gap of the bridge by following everyone else\u2019s sight. He saw a good looking \u201cold bastard\u201d who was staring at the girl in his arms \u201cindecently\u201d. He was definitely up to no good.\u201cWho the hell is that old man?\u201dFei felt his fists starting to itch.After seeing the \u201cold bastard\u201d continue winking recklessly on the other side of the bridge, Fei almost crushed his own teeth into pieces, and his knuckles were cracking from how tightly he held his fists. The soldiers and citizens beside Fei stopped cheering and looked at Fei with a strange expression on their faces.Bast had left the castle with a ton of treasures from the king\u2019s collections. Many people thought that the butler had abandoned his daughter and the retard son-in-law and ran off with the treasures. However, no one would\u2019ve thought that he would return at a time like this. Everyone\u2019s minds couldn\u2019t react fast enough to this; that\u2019s why their expressions were weird.But Fei got it all wrong.The king\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was being flirted at so openly, especially during his victory celebration. How was he supposed to react? Fei subconsciously thought that the reason why everyone\u2019s expressions were weird was because\u2026\u2026\u201cWhoosh!\u201dFei instantly used Barbarian \u3010Leap\u3011; like a tiger with wings, he jumped from the north side of the bridge to the south side. Without a word, he grasped his future father-in-law\u2019s robe and lifted the \u201cold bastard\u201d in his mind off of the ground; he was ready to teach this rude crackpot a lesson\u2026\u2026At that moment, Angela\u2019s shaky voice sounded, \u201cFather, you\u2026\u2026 you\u2019re back!\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u2026Father?\u201dFei was surprised. A thought flashed through his mind like lightning as his expression turned weird as well, \u201cDamn, this old man is\u2026\u2026is actually Angela\u2019s father?\u201d Fei suddenly burst into a cold sweat. Before he could say anything, the old man in his hands yelled in surprise, \u201cIt turned out to be you, Alexander. You turned normal\u2026\u2026Ay, what are you doing, I\u2019m your future father-in-law, quickly put me down\u2026\u2026\u201dFei was embarrassed.He felt that he couldn\u2019t hold onto the situation, \u201cDarn it! What is this? Jealous of my father-in-law? This is as tragic as Oedipus in Greek Mythology who married his own mom\u2026\u2026What should I do?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t panic, I have to hold everything together!\u201dAfter he thought about it, an idea flashed into his head. In a second, his ferocious robe grabbing turned into an intimate hug. Fei hugged Bast tightly with both of his arms and put up a surprised and cheerful smile. He laughed, \u201cAh, dear uncle Bast, I missed you so much!\u201d\u201cEh, really? Why do I feel like you want me dead?\u201d Bast had a hard time breathing in Fei\u2019s tight hug.\u201cHehe, you\u2019re just imagining things, that\u2019s 100% your imagination\u2026\u2026Eh, allow me to bring you over.\u201d Barbarian \u3010Leap\u3011 was initiated, and Fei held his future father-in-law under his arms and jumped from the south side of the bridge back to the north side._____Sorry for the short chapter, Udon ran out of time today before he had to leave for work.

    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: Mysterious WomanThe courtly old handsome man half-closed his eyes from fear. After seeing the cloudy steaming fog on the river appear under his feet in mid-air, as well as hearing the wind blowing against his ears, his mouth widened in surprise. It was then that he realized that Alexander had just jumped over a sixteen to seventeen yard gap\u2026\u2026 \u201cWhat kind of strength is that? That\u2019s at least the strength of a two star warrior\u2026\u2026When did Alexander acquire such power?\u201dBast was curious.He felt that he had missed something magnificent after he left the castle.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter both of them got onto the north side of the collapsed bridge, Angela happily jumped into Bast\u2019s arms as she burst into tears, \u201c Father\u2026\u2026I knew you would come back!\u201d\u201cOf course, because my sweetheart who\u2019s more precious than my own life is still here.\u201d A gentle fatherly smile came on Bast\u2019s face as he kissed his daughter\u2019s forehead.However, Pierce and the other soldiers and citizens \u201chumphed\u201d at him with disdain.In their eyes, the sly and greedy old fox had spent all the treasures that he took and came back to Chambord to deceive the king again and obtain more treasures. Although the \u201cold fox\u201d appeared very graceful, elegant and noble-like, after a couple years, even the mercenaries that passed by Chambord had seen through his true colors: a king\u2019s butler that was afraid of death and treasured money like his life.All the cold stares and expressions were seen by Bast.However, not the slightest bit of embarrassment came onto the old man\u2019s face. He tapped his daughter\u2019s back, slowly fixed his coarse robe and said to Fei, \u201cAlexander, it looks like something magical happened to you\u2026 That\u2019s great! But I recommend you to change into a set of clean clothes\u2026\u2026\u201d After he said that, he looked at the Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Arctic Fur\u3011 which was a bit shabby. He moved a few steps back and continued, \u201cYassin Emperor of the Zenit Empire has send his oldest Princess Tanasha as the Royal Coronation ambassador and she has arrived with the Royal Coronation Legion. You\u2019re turning 18 in half a month; according to the customs on the continent, you can only formally become the king of Chambord after you receive the coronation from your parent Zenit Empire\u2026\u2026 This ceremony will be very significant; you have to prepare for it well.\u201dThe old handsome man pointed at the shiny armoured cavalry formation across the river who resembled a forest with all their weapons pointing into the sky.\u201cSo those dumbasses really are from the Zenit Empire\u2026\u2026Eh wait, uncle Bast, what did you say? Royal Coronation Legion? Aren\u2019t they the reinforcements that are here to help out in the war?\u201d Fei frowned.\u201cNo, we only learned that Chambord was under siege while we were on the way.\u201dFei looked at the cocky and arrogant cavalry on the other side of the bank as he rubbed his chin. He laughed, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it was\u2026\u2026Uncle Bast, as you can see, the only way to enter Chambord is through the bridge that collapsed during the battle. There\u2019s no way that all the cavalry can make it into the castle. Plus, my soldiers have battled sleeplessly for the last couple of days, and they\u2019re all exhausted. How about this? Let them camp on the other side of the bank for now, and after I get the bridge fixed in a few days, they can enter the castle.\u201dBast almost bit his tongue off after he heard that. \u201cAlexander, are you kidding me? This is the Royal Coronation Legion from the Zenit Empire. I recommend you get people to start fixing the bridge right away and connect both sides of the bridge using ropes and wooden plates\u2026\u2026\u201d After he said that, he whispered into Fei\u2019s ear, \u201cThey are here to officially crown you. Do you know how much effort and treasures I spent so that they could come here?\u201d\u201cThe bridge has already collapsed, what can I do? If those noble knights can\u2019t wait, then they can fix up the bridge themselves.\u201d Fei didn\u2019t say much more after that. He turned around and announced into the crowd of soldiers and citizens, \u201cI will be hosting a formal celebration at the King\u2019s Palace tonight to reward and honour my brave soldiers. Everyone in Chambord is welcome and invited!\u201dThe last sentence was directed to the surrounding soldiers and citizens. The crowd started to cheer instantly, and joy and happiness appeared on the smiles on everyone\u2019s face.Bast was stunned, but he soon shook his head helplessly.He didn\u2019t say anything more.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After he got back, Fei was physically and mentally exhausted, but he held himself up a little bit longer to oversee the aftermath of the war and the recovery programs. Although Bast had taken a large portion of the King\u2019s collection when he left, Fei still took out the rest of the treasures that the king had. The properties were divided into dozens of shares with the help of Angela and Emma, and they were distributed to the soldiers\u2019 and citizens\u2019 families who died in the defending battles.This sympathetic move made the soldiers and citizens more grateful to Fei.Especially for the families that had lost their loved ones and were grieving, the king\u2019s rewards were like fire in a cold winter day. It wasn\u2019t just a rare glory; it also gave them hope to live on after they lost their husbands and sons who would normally provide for the family.Suddenly, the reputation and prestige of King Alexander had reached an all-time high. The first thing that people would do when they met him was raise their arms and cheer, \u201cHail the king!\u201d The wounds and scars that the cruel war left on this ancient castle were recovering at an astonishing speed.On top of that, Fei diluted the half bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 that was left and gave it to the doctors to heal the wounded soldiers. Except for the poor ones who had lost their limbs and became disabled, the severely injured soldiers were recovering quickly while lightly injured soldiers could already go home and unite with their families.Everyone treated King Alexander as equals to the omnipotent God of War in many people\u2019s minds.The final outcome of the war made some people who had ulterior motives anxious. Head Minister Bazzer and his son Gill returned to their mansion quietly after the battle ended. The gate was shut and not a single sound came out of the mansion; no one knew what was happening in there.Warden Oleg on the other hand had lucky survived in battle. Maybe it was because he felt that Chambord was about to change, but the former flatterer didn\u2019t hide in his home, but rather changed his superiority complex that he used to have. It didn\u2019t matter who it was\u2014even if it was a beggar on the street, he would smile at them and was very amiable. He firmly supported Fei\u2019s every decision and used a hundred times his effort to execute them tirelessly while wildly flattering Fei and proving his loyalty.\u201cLook! There\u2019s a rainbow!\u201dSomeone suddenly yelled. No one was sure when but when everyone looked up, they found a colorful rainbow in the blue sky. What was more surprising was that the sky surrounding the rainbow turned misty red as if the whole sky was ignited by someone. Looking from afar, it appeared as though there was a mythological bridge standing on a red ocean.\u201cLord! This is a miracle! The great God of War is blessing our King Alexander, blessing our Chambord Castle!\u201dBecause there weren\u2019t any rain when the rainbow appeared, many people linked the cause to their king and the God of War. In a brief moment, there were people kneeling down and praying sincerely at every corner of Chambord.Fei stood in front of the King\u2019s Palace and smiled.He knew it was due to the prior battle. Numerous corpses fell into Zuli River and created many splashes of water and blood. When they evaporated into water vapour and blood mist under the hot sun, it had caused this magnificent view.It was at this time that war exposed its rare beauty.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cBig sis Tanasha, how can that sketchy dude be a glorious and graceful king? He is a reckless and rude savage\u2026\u2026He dared to ignore us and didn\u2019t even give a damn about the majesty and dignity of our parent Zenit Empire\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle prince Tropinski fearfully arrived at the north bank of the Zuli River as he travelled through the temporary bridge that was made from ropes and wooden plates. When he entered the gates of Chambord, he was still bad mouthing Fei continuously. No matter if it was the first impression of knocking him and his followers off of their horses or the unreasonable behaviour of him ignoring the Royal Coronation Legion on the south bank of the river, Tropinski was very dissatisfied with the King of Chambord.In fact, Tropinski wasn\u2019t the only one who was resentful. To the superior knights of the Zenit Empire, going to a remote countryside with the Royal Coronation Legion was already a huge honour to Chambord. But the pity uncrowned king of a level 6 affiliated kingdom put up his mucky pride and didn\u2019t welcome them fervently, and that attitude had made a lot of the knights in the legion made. If it wasn\u2019t for the calmness of Princess Tanasha, they wouldn\u2019t be able to wait to rush into the King\u2019s Palace and teach the rude king an unforgettable lesson.\u201cJimmy, the Knight\u2019s Code tells us that when blaming others for their rudeness, we should reflect on our actions first.\u201dTanasha didn\u2019t listen to her little brother\u2019s complaints at all. She still spoke with a weak and moderate tone. As the ambassador that represented the Zenit Empire to host the Coronation Ceremony, it was surprising that the Oldest Princess Tanasha didn\u2019t mind the cold treatment. No one knew what her royal highness was thinking; she was in the carriage the whole time and didn\u2019t make any appearances.Below the gate of Chambord Castle.Bast had changed into a luxurious black robe from his coarse navigator robe. Bast who now had an even more elegant temperament was waiting respectfully with two servants beside the gate.After seeing the arrival of the princess\u2019s carriage, Bast quickly saluted and explained, \u201cHer royal highness, his royal highness. Our king was severely injured during the battle and couldn\u2019t welcome you both personally; he is very sorry about this. However, we have already prepared a feast and residence for the Royal Coronation Legion.\u201dHonestly, this old handsome man had been extremely busy for the past three to four hours.The young and energetic King Alexander was only thinking and focusing on showing concern for and rewarding his soldiers and citizens. Bast had to concentrate on dealing with the Royal Coronation Legion. He was the one who organized people to quickly repair the collapsed bridge. Bast\u2019s prestige was an all-time low after he \u201cran off with treasures\u201d, and not many people were willing to listen to this sly and greedy \u201cold bastard\u201d. However, an old sly fox was indeed an old sly fox. All he said was, \u201cIf the bridge isn\u2019t repaired in time, the Coronation Legion will draw back the crowning of King Alexander.\u201d The soldiers and citizens of Chambord instantly put in their complete effort into repairing the bridge. Even some lightly wounded soldiers voluntarily participated in the operation. Quickly, many ropes connected the two sides of the bridge and firm wooden plates were paved over them; the horses and the carriage were able to get across.Bast smacked his tongue in his mouth when he was watching.The whole process took two hours less than he thought. Alexander\u2019s prestige in Chambord was unparalleled; it was far greater the old king\u2019s. It looked like if necessary, the soldiers and citizens were willing to die for the king.\u201cLead the way.\u201dAfter hearing Bast\u2019s excuse, Princess Tanasha who was still in the carriage spoke. The voice still sounded weak, yet apathetic and cold. No one could get any kind of information from this kind of voice. This oldest Princess of the Zenit Empire seemed like she only had one kind of mood.Bast nodded and bowed gracefully. He turned around and led the way.He wasn\u2019t surprised. Since they had left the capital of Zenit Empire \u2013 St. Petersburg, the mysterious oldest princess always had this attitude. Bast had been very curious about it in the beginning, but now he had gotten used to it.After they entered the castle, the Royal Coronation Legion held residence in the formal Military Judge Conca\u2019s mansion.Because Conca was guilty of treason and was executed by King Alexander himself, the huge luxurious mansion had become the king\u2019s property. Bast had already picked and ordered a ton of servants to clean up the mansion; he went even further and re-decorated it. This kind of arrangement had even satisfied the picky knights and prince Tropinski.The Royal Coronation Legion had brought a lot of their own servants and maids, so Bast didn\u2019t have to worry about that. However, this old handsome man had utilized his strength in administrative tasks; no matter how coldly these arrogant knights treated him, he treated them fairly and didn\u2019t display any disrespect or negligence.\u201cHer royal highness and his royal highness, King Alexander will be hosting a celebration party at the King\u2019s Palace tonight to celebrate the success of Chambord\u2019s defensive war. It would be our honor if both your highnesses could show up.\u201dBefore he left, Bast invited both Tanasha and Tropinski.Actually, Fei didn\u2019t mean to invite anyone who was in the Royal Coronation Legion, but Bast felt like the party would be a place for both sides to get to know each other and resolve the prior conflicts, so he decided to invite them.\u201cWhat celebration? Ha, he has the guts to celebrate? All of the black armoured enemies were wiped out by our cavalry on the plain\u2026\u2026If it wasn\u2019t for the brave and skilled Zenit Cavalry, the king would already be captured and imprisoned by the enemies. Haha, alright, tell your retarded king that I will go for sure. I want to see how that cheeky guy claims someone else\u2019s credit!\u201dLittle Prince Tropinski responded grumpily.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The sunset was as red as blood.The mountains surrounding Chambord Castle was showering in gold light. The castle appeared quiet and peaceful under the contrast of the surging river. It felt like an aesthetic landscape painting, intoxicating and addicting.On the stone paved road in the castle, there were many pedestrians.Although the kingdom succeeddc in their defense and King Alexander had done many things to counter the aftermath, there were still many tasks for the citizens of Chambord to help complete. Many wooden boards, stones and heavy items that were temporarily dismantled to be used as defense tools and weapons had to be moved back. The corpses of their fellow soldiers had to be honored, and the enemy soldier\u2019s corpses had to be burned to prevent diseases like the plague that would arise from rotting and decomposing corpses\u2026\u2026The ending of a war meant the beginning of other complicated operations.No one noticed the new guest on the street.A mysterious woman whose face was under a black veil was walking casually under the protection of a fully armoured female knight. Behind them, a smiling tall blonde warrior followed them in silence.\u201cYour highness, the scenery of this little castle is not bad and the streets are spacious and organized. Although it can\u2019t compare to St. Petersburg, this is rare for a level 6 affiliated kingdom.\u201d The female knight was observing the buildings on the street curiously. But when she spotted the King\u2019s Palace further away, she frowned, \u201cBut I think that King Alexander must be a greedy and luxurious man. If not, why would he build himself such a magnificent palace?\u201d\u201cSusan, I see the exact opposite\u2026\u2026\u201dThe mysterious black veiled woman shook her head and spoke slowly, \u201cThere were rumors in the Imperial City saying that King Alexander was a retard who only had the intelligence of a three year old. Looking at it now, the rumors were false. If you look at the pedestrians on the street who had just went through an intense war, with some people even losing their loved ones, the smiles on their faces represent their inner happiness. Did you hear them say \u201cHail the king\u201d when they greeted each other? Could a retarded king receive loyal support of this many civilians? About that magnificent palace\u2026\u2026If you look at the color of the stones on the palace closely, you can tell that the palace was built more than eighty years ago; it\u2019s seems unrelated to this King named Alexander\u2026\u2026\u201dThe mysterious black veiled women took a pause and then said, \u201cSusan, I\u2019m suddenly interested in the celebration party tonight. Let\u2019s go back and prepare ourselves, you should come with me tonight.\u201d\u201cHehehe, your highness, it seems like it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve participated in these kinds of parties. I will notify that butler named Bast and tell him to send someone to lead\u2026\u2026\u201d The young female knight was surprised.\u201cNo need to notify him, we can go quietly\u2026\u2026 Didn\u2019t he say that there are no invitation cards for this party and anyone including the rich and the poor can go? Let\u2019s go as ordinary civilians.\u201d The mysterious woman said.\u201cHa, that\u2019s even better! At least we won\u2019t have to deal with those annoying noblemen, hehe\u2026\u2026 Wait, your highness. What about this annoying guy?\u201d The female knight pointed at the blonde warrior who was following them silently as she spoke.\u201cKnight Captain Romain, how about you come with us.\u201d It sounded like a recommendation from the black veiled women, but at the same time felt like an order.The smiling blonde knight nodded, \u201cMy honor, your highness.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The sun lowered on the west side of the sky and night embraced the land.Lights were burning and looked like stars in the dark castle. The King\u2019s Palace was brightly lit. More and more citizens started to crowd into the palace. In less than half an hour, except for the soldiers who were guarding the defensive wall, almost everyone at Chambord was in the King\u2019s Palace.The Celebration party was about to begin.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: The Accident at the PartyWhen talking about the magnificence of buildings, Chambord\u2019s King\u2019s Palace would be placed in the top three among all of the 250 affiliated kingdoms that Zenit Empire controlled. All the structures were made by collecting and assembling huge white stones. An extremely spacious stone square was right in the front of the palace. On the east, west and north sides of the square, there stood many thirty or forty yard (m) tall huge stone pillars and ten yard (m) tall statues of all the gods. The majestic King\u2019s Palace was behind all of these pillars and statues. The gates were at the south side of the square where the citizens and soldiers could enter through.The celebration party would be hosted at the outdoor stone square.The celebrating crowd was gathering together at the square. Six huge bonfires burned and lit up the dark sky. There were ten giant wooden towers the citizens and soldiers had created. and they were located in the middle of the square. They were all six or seven yards (m) tall and the corpses of all the soldiers and citizens who died in the war were placed on the layers of the towers.The soldiers in the King\u2019s guards wore clear armour and patrolled the square and the King\u2019s Palace with lances in their hands. The citizens were dressed in white robes and were singing and dancing. Some acrobats were tumbling back and forth on the floor, and beautiful women were held their hands together and danced around the bonfire. People held up green tree branches that represented life and hope and laughed happily.The night wore on.Making \u201cclip-clops\u201d sounds, the prince of the Zenit Empire Tropinski had arrived with his cavalry guards. The old handsome man Bast led the prince and his henchmen to the VIP seats under the god\u2019s statues on the west side of the square. Because Zenit was their parent empire, the citizens and subjects of Chambord showed warm welcome to the prince\u2019s arrival. Many fragrant petals and clear water were sprinkled at them.Tropinski quite enjoyed that welcome.At this time, Tropinski had surprisingly showed the style and grace of an empire\u2019s prince. He smiled gently and waved continuously at the surrounding citizens. However, the cavalry behind the prince had unfavorable attitudes towards these low class people in this small kingdom. After seeing the smiles and hearing the cheers, they kept their lofty and arrogant attitude as if they were watching their dogs wave their tails at them flatteringly.Seeing that Prince Tropinski was the only one who was here to join the party, Bast was a little disappointed. The Eldest Princess Tanasha was the leader of the legion and she controlled everything; however, he couldn\u2019t read her attitude nor intentions. This party was a great opportunity for him to observe her, but she didn\u2019t come\u2026\u2026Although that was the case, Bast didn\u2019t neglect anyone at all; he ordered the servants to watch their own manners and take care of the guests properly.After a more than ten minutes, the crowd gradually calmed down from all the cheering and dancing. The square was quiet.At this moment, two squads of fancily armoured soldiers walked out of the huge stone palace on the north side of the square and formed two straight lines on both sides of the path. Then under everyone\u2019s attention, King Alexander appeared on the high stairs in front of the palace while holding the hand of his beautiful fianc\u00e9e Angela.Fei was dressed in an azure king robe. The robe was fluttering in the wind and was perfectly framed for his slim and muscular body. He was also wearing a golden leaf-shaped crown. His ink-like black hair, crystal clear eyes, stalwart figure, unparalleled temperament that he had acquire throughout his cold killings and his natural affinity had perfectly combined together. Looking from afar, he was like a god that was high up in the sky and vividly represented the monarch of the kingdom.Beside him, the beautiful Angela was in an azure colored dress. A thin gold belt hung around her waist; her skin was finer and whiter than snow on the highest mountains. She was wearing a crown that was made from numerous kinds of flowers. With the wind fluttering in her hair, she looked like a goddess that had landed in the mortal world; pure and mighty, people couldn\u2019t stare at her straightly, nor could they find any fault in her.Both of them smiled as they appeared on the highest steps to the palace and they stole away the spotlights on the square instantly. Even the crystal like stars that were embedded into the dark sky suddenly lost their brightness.The citizens and soldiers of Chambord all kneeled down and cheered, \u201cHail King Alexander!\u201dMany people had found out for the first time that their king was so extraordinary and powerful. At this moment, no one could link the perfect image of a king currently in front of them with the dumb retarded Alexander. They humbly kneeled on the square and cheered with their lives and souls.Prince Tropinski who was sitting down in the VIP seats on the west side of the square couldn\u2019t help but stand up. During the day, he was very dismissive about the rumoured king. He was only here to participate in the party because he wanted to make trouble and tease the king. He didn\u2019t question his own looks and temperament before, and he thought that if he stood up on the square, he would be the center of attention and would steal the spotlight from everyone else\u2026\u2026But now, the prince of the Zenit Empire suddenly felt a bit ashamed about his appearance. Seeing the couple in front of the palace who looked like a match made in heaven, he surprisingly realized that his disdain and dissatisfaction towards this kingdom, this castle and this king were quickly disappearing.But what he didn\u2019t notice was that his henchmen didn\u2019t feel the same way. Behind the prince, a buff knight wearing a full suit of armour and a red cape stared at Angela who was still on the stairs. Greed and obscenity filled his eyes, and the dozens of cavalry and guards behind him didn\u2019t hide their lust either.On a side of the square.No one noticed that at the rear of the crowd under the shadow of the huge god\u2019s statues, three people covered in black cloaks stood there quietly. When they saw the appearance of King Alexander and Angela, the figure in the very front made a sound, \u201cHuh?\u201d. The voice sounded weak, as if the person was just recovering from an illness. The person sounded surprised; this reaction made the two people behind stare at each other in unison; they\u2019d never seen that reaction out of the person in front of them before.\u2026\u2026After the King and the future queen arrived, the carnival on the square had gradually stopped.The atmosphere became formal and solemn. The crowd voluntarily made a path, and Fei and Angela slowly walked down from the high stairs and approached the ten temporarily crafted wooden towers.The atmosphere was becoming more solemn.Wars never ended on the Azeroth Continent, and numerous soldiers would die on the battlefield every day, every hour and every second. Burying all these soldiers\u2019 corpses became a huge and time consuming operation, in addition to taking up a lot of land. To prevent these situation from arising, the custom of cremation of dead soldiers was formed a long time ago. No matter if it was the king, nobles, citizens or even the slaves, if they died in battle, they would be placed in one of these wooden towers and be cremated. The people of Azeroth believed that the souls of the warriors would be redeemed and they would stay with the God of War in the Empire of Gods.According to the knowledge that Fei had crammed into his head about the traditional customs and etiquette with help from Angela, he climbed up the towers and took pieces of gold coins from Angela\u2019s hands and placed them individually on the eyes of the dead soldiers \u2013 this was another custom on the Azeroth Continent. People believed that placing gold coins on the eyes of dead soldiers would help them re-open their eyes in the burning fire and find the correct path to the Empire of Gods.It was a complicated and long process.Chambord had lost one hundred and thirty one brave soldiers in this defensive war. There were supposed to be special personnel to place these gold coins for those dead soldiers, but Fei unexpectedly insisted on doing it himself. According to the custom, only high nobles or heroes who contributed greatly to the kingdom had the honor of having gold coins placed on their eyes by the king; Fei\u2019s action granted unprecedented honour for these ordinary soldiers.Obviously, it was his intention to win his people over.It was quiet on the square; no one said a word. The wind seemed to stop as well. Only a few women dressed in black robes who were equal to temple priests sung an ancient song on the stairs in front of the palace. The song didn\u2019t have any lyrics, but it was still spread far across the continent; it was song for saying farewell to loved ones.Fei patiently covered every dead soldier\u2019s eyes with gold coins under everyone\u2019s attention, and then he lit up the herbs that the bodies were lying on. The rapid fire soon devoured the bodies of the dead ones, and the families who lost their loved ones broke down and cried out loud\u2026\u2026The whole process took about an hour.After the fire turned the corpses and ten wooden towers into ashes, the atmosphere on the square finally eased up. The crying gradually stopped and the doctors carefully collected the ashes and placed them in a huge black coffin. After twelve days, this coffin would be carried onto the highest mountain to the east of Chambord and be buried there. That way, the souls of the warriors would be the first ones to see the beautiful sunrise \u2013 it was the custom of Chambord.After all of that, the square returned to its previous cheerful and lively atmosphere.People started to sing and dance to celebrate their victory in the war. The crazy atmosphere became even more heated under the burning bonfire. Regardless of age, gender, and social class, people held their hands together and danced. Even the soldiers who were patrolling were dragged into the crowd, as well as Fei and Angela. At the celebration, everyone was equal. Prince Tropinski and his guards were invited as well.Some women laughed as they carried plates full of fruits and barbeque into the crowds.Prince Tropinski was influenced by the happy atmosphere. At this time, he put down his arrogance and coldness and returned to being a kid who was 17 years old. He held hands with other young boys and young girls and formed a big circle and danced around a bonfire; he was like a bird who had just gotten out of his cage, free and delighted.But what Tropinski and the others didn\u2019t notice was that his guards and that red caped knight laughed and pushed their way into the centre of the square. They all had a malicious grin on their face; their eyes shined as they felt kinky.The direction they were squeezing to in the middle of the square was where the pure goddess Angela and blonde Emma and their girlfriends were dancing joyfully. The girl smiled happily; her beautiful face was filled with laughter and happiness, like a little Angel.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Pierce and Drogba laughed as they drank with silver bowls the size of a kitchen sink. Wild and uninhibited laughter echoed in the square. The twenty three strongmen including Oleg had followed Fei and slid down the defensive wall and charged into the enemies like a death squad. Except for Breno who had sacrificed himself on the bridge, although the other twenty two strongmen were all severely injured, they made back alive. Fighting alongside the king had built a special friendship between these iron-like men.On the north side of the square, the men gathered together and sat down on the stone tables and gulped down the wine. Some of them wrestled half-naked on the side, some arm-wrestled on the table and others danced with the joyful girls. Even Oleg who was unwelcomed by all the soldiers had gained many people\u2019s respect after this deadly mission.\u201cCheers! For our brothers!\u201d Fei raised his wineglass and proposed a toast.\u201cFor our brothers! Hail the king! Cheers!\u201d The soldiers cheered as they also raised their glasses and bowls; King Alexander\u2019s arrival made them feel very honoured.\u201cThis second glass of wine is a toast to our hero Breno!\u201dFei poured the wine in his glass onto the ground and said, \u201cHis parents will be all of our parents, and his son will be all of our son\u2026\u2026Breno\u2019s family will be supported by the Royal family of Chambord until his son becomes a real brave and strong man like his father!\u201d\u201cFor our hero Breno!\u201dThe soldiers poured the wine in their hands onto the ground silently. At this moment, in many soldier\u2019s drunk and bleary eyes, it was as if they had seen the figure whose heart was penetrated, but still dragged three enemies off of the bridge while yelling, \u201cHail the king!\u201d in the dark, star filled sky\u2026\u2026Breno was a hero, he was a comrade, and he was also a companion!\u201cThe third glass of wine is a toast to our hero Breno\u2019s comrades, a toast to the twenty two great warriors of Chambord, Pierce, Drogba, O\u2019Neal, Essien, Ballack\u2026\u2026 Fei said the strongmen\u2019s names one by one. Every time he announced a name, the crowd would burst into cheers and applause; the person whose name was called shivered in excitement.\u201cMay the God of War bless you, my warriors. Your names shall be remembered together with Chambord. Now, in the name of King Alexander, I shall grant you honour; the armour and weapons you guys used during the battle will be returned to you after they are repaired by the best blacksmiths in the castle\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei\u2019s voice was like a burning bonfire and ignited every soldier\u2019s blood. After seeing the strongmen\u2019s incredible and excited expressions, Fei raised his wineglass filled up high with wine into the air and congratulated, \u201cYes, my warriors, as you wish, these are the most precious items in the royal family, and they shall be permanently granted to you guys, because they are the medals that represent your bravery and skill.\u201dThe twenty three sets of armour and weapons were the treasures that the old king collected throughout his life time. Although they were not illustrious magic items and weapons, in a level six affiliated kingdom of a level one Empire, they were priceless. For an officer like Oleg, if he saved all his life time income, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to get a full set of the armour and weapons.So right after Fei stopped talking, the soldiers started to cheer wildly.The king was clear towards who deserved rewards and punishments, especially for those who showed loyalty and risked their lives. Moreover, in the prior battles King Alexander was always on the very front line of the battlefield and charges, and he had blocked the enemies\u2019 blades for his soldiers and companions with his own body. The series of behaviors had boost Fei\u2019s influence in the military to an unparalleled level.The King\u2019s kind rewards had pushed the celebration party to its peak.The intoxicating smell of wine diffused into the air.Fei was inspired and even took off his own luxurious king\u2019s robe and put on a thin armour. He wrestled with the strongmen bare armed and competed in drinking games; it was a men\u2019s game and Fei was soon on the same page as the other soldiers. By using the Barbarian Mode to cheat, Fei easily flipped over a dozen famous strongmen in Chambord and completely showed off a king\u2019s strength and courage \u2026\u2026The delightful atmosphere embraced Chambord Castle after the war.At this moment, suddenly a surprise occurred.In the middle of the square where it was the most crowded, a series of female screams and curses was heard, in addition to the faint laughter of men mixed in with it\u2026\u2026Fei frowned.The soldiers who were having a good time also froze their hands which were holding wine glasses in the air.\u201cIt\u2019s probably a drunk punk forcing a kiss on his beloved girl recklessly\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was the first thing that came to Fei and the soldiers\u2019 minds.\u201cHaha, although that kind of behaviour isn\u2019t civilized, at this open and unconventional celebration party, we can probably forgive that horny bastard. The girls at Chambord are very bold and vigorous, haha, I hope the God of War can bless that poor punk.\u201dAll the men had understanding smiles on their face.But what was unexpected was that the chaos and curses didn\u2019t calm down as Fei and the soldiers expected; it grew bigger and louder. Cursing and screaming were very pronounced when mixed with the cheer and laughter. Many people stopped dancing and crowded towards the middle of the square. The noise gradually stopped and everyone\u2019s attention was at the source of the chaos.Fei stood on a stairway beside him and looked at the source location of the chaos. The next second, his expression turned cold and a murderous sensation leaked from his body and diffused to the surroundings.\u201cFuck! Someone is messing with Angela!\u201dBarbarian \u3010Leap\u3011 was initiated, and \u201cWhoosh!\u201d Fei jumped up tens of yards (m) into the air and rushed to the centre of the square in a few ups and downs.At this time, the crowd formed into a big circle.In the middle of the circle, Emma and a dozen young citizens formed a human wall and angrily stared at the couple of knights in front of them with red eyes. Behind them, Angela who was in the azure long dress crouched down as her face turned pale. A fifteen or sixteen year old teenage boy was leaning against her arms. The little guy\u2019s neck was severely injured; there was a shocking slit that was cut open by a sharp blade; the teenage boy was having a hard time breathing, and blood and foam was coming out of his mouth. Like a person who didn\u2019t know how to swim had gotten choked by the water in a swimming pool, his chest raised and fell dramatically. The blood and foam coming out of his mouth flew everywhere, and Angela\u2019s azure long dress was strained by the blood.\u201cPuh! Reckless low class citizen, how dare you point your finger at a superior empire knight?\u201dA leading red caped Zenit Empire\u2019s cavalry put the sword that had blood on it back to the scabbard. Cutting someone\u2019s throat almost in half was a negligible matter in his eyes. He yelled at Emma and the citizens of Chambord disdainfully, \u201cIf you want to live, then kneel down and kiss my boots, and get the fuck out of here. Shameless bastards, the Deputy Knight Captain of the legion, Mr. Semak only wanted to invite your future queen to a dance\u2026\u2026\u201dThe red caped cavalry emphasized the words \u201cQueen\u201d and \u201cdance\u201d; any man would understand the obscene meaning behind it. After he said that, he winked at his companions proudly.Behind him, a dozen similarly red caped cavalry held onto their shoulders and laughed out loud.In between all the cavalry, the buffed knight who was behind prince Tropinski had a bright smile on his face after he heard that. He sneered at the citizens of Chambord who were crowding them and glanced around. When he saw Emma, his eyes brighten up; but after a short pause, his vision went through the crowd and landed on the goddess like azure dressed girl. An obscene expression came on his face; he didn\u2019t hide his lust at all.At this time \u2013\u201cWhoosh!\u201dA strong wind blew by. Everyone\u2019s vision blurred and a majestic figured suddenly appeared in the middle of the circle\u2026\u2026It was Fei who used Barbarian \u3010Leap\u3011 to get here faster.Fei glanced around and quickly figured out what was going on.His face changed expression; he didn\u2019t acknowledge the provocation from the red caped cavalry who were like mad dogs and rushed to Angela. He crouched down and placed his hand on the back of the dying teenage boy. He opened up his belt storage and took out the bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011; he carefully dropped the last few drops of the remaining red potion into the teenage boy\u2019s mouth and on his shocking slit on his neck.A light mysterious magic power surged.The \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 had displayed its incredible magical effect. Quickly, the teenage boy\u2019s wound recovered at a visible speed; it formed a scar in just a few seconds and the scar soon shrunk and disappeared. He stopped spurting blood from his mouth and his dramatic chest movements calmed down as well. His breathing went back to normal and regained consciousness and opened up his eyes slowly.Fei was relieved after he saw that.Luckily, there were still some of the \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 left after Fei diluted most of it. Fei saved a little bit just in case of an emergency. He didn\u2019t expect that it would be utilized at such a crucial moment. If not, this teenage boy would probably be a cold corpse by now.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)After seeing the king perform another miracle by saving the teenage boy\u2019s life magically, the surrounding citizens of Chambord couldn\u2019t help but cheer.\u201cAngela, tell me what happened.\u201dFei handed the boy over to one of the soldiers to take care of. He looked at the imperial cavalry who were laughing out loud proudly with a provoking manner, then turned around and asked.With an angry expression covering her innocent face, she tightly held onto Fei\u2019s hand and then whispered into Fei\u2019s ear. Fei became more enraged as he listened; an unstoppable fury burned in his heart and his expression was as cold as ice. A sharp murderous sensation unknowingly diffused from his body.It turned out that these dirty cavalry pretended to be drunk and started touching the girls beside Angela and Emma. At first, these girls tolerated a little bit because the cavalry were from their parent Empire \u2013 Zenit. Who knew that the cavalry were insatiable; some daring cavalry even wanted to touch Angela and insisted her to accompany their Knight Captain Semak to drink and dance with him. Their reckless and rude behaviour angered the young citizens of Chambord. How could the energetic lads allow the Great King Alexander\u2019s fianc\u00e9e be insulted; they walked up and reprimanded the cavalry. Both parties started shoving each other, but one of the Zenit cavalry pulled out his sword and sliced the throat of the youth who was standing at the very front\u2026\u2026Fei listen patiently as Angela told him the whole story. He tapped on his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoulder gently to tell her to relax. He then walked up, separated \u201cthe human wall\u201d that was formed by Emma and other young men and stood at the very front of the commotion.\u201cOh? You\u2019re that King Alexander, right?\u201dKnight Captain Semak was at the centre of all the cavalry. He was like a moon surrounded by a bunch of stars. He clenched his fists and crossed his arms and walked up a couple of steps. After he observed Fei with his haughty demeanor, he said lightly, \u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m very dissatisfied with the way that Chambord treats its guests. See, my men only wanted to invite the queen to a dance, but some of your citizens were blocking and insulting us unreasonably\u2026\u2026\u201dHonestly, Knight Captain Semak didn\u2019t have any respect for this king named Alexander. Rather, he despised this little hillbilly kind of king. The Zenit Empire had many affiliated kingdoms. The powerless kings of little level 6 kingdoms held lower positions than even lowly navigators at St. Petersburg in Semak\u2019s eyes. Therefore, he didn\u2019t hide his scornful expression and said, \u201cAlthough my mood has been disturbed and my fun was stopped, if the Queen can do a roundtable dance for us, I will treat this as if nothing happened\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he said that, the surrounding Chambord citizens started to yell and swear. On the Azeroth Continent, roundtable dancing was an unsightly dance that the vilest prostitutes used to please men. Asking a future queen to do the roundtable dance was the greatest insult of all time.Knight Captain Semak didn\u2019t acknowledge the swearing and anger from the crowd.He smiled with a disdainful expression on his face, and ridicule filled his eyes like a high emperor that controlled everyone\u2019s lives. Suddenly, he raised his hand and pointed at Emma who was standing behind Fei and continued, \u201cYour Majesty, one more thing. Let your little blonde servant come to the legion\u2019s residence and sleep with me tonight; she should be thankful that I granted her the honour, hahaha\u2026\u2026Oh, right, I\u2019m also interested in the magic potion that you used to heal that lowlife citizen, give them all to me. If you could do all these things, the Zenit Empire won\u2019t punish Chambord for being discourteous.\u201dAfter he said that, Semak looked at Fei scornfully.Before this, Semak had been to many affiliated kingdoms. The kings and ministers in those kingdoms were like poor beggars. To make sure that their kingdom could still be protected by Zenit Empire, they did everything they could to please Semak. A little king of a level 5 affiliated kingdom even forced his newly wedded beautiful queen to serve Semak, the Imperial Knight Captain at night. His request and behaviour today was like an extra reward in Semak\u2019s own eyes; he went easy on the young and ignorant king in front of him.Semak was a little messed in the head. He loved seeing the kings who had exclusive and supreme authority over their own territories kneel down with pleasing expressions on their faces. It gave him the thrill of conquest.But today, Semak didn\u2019t get the thrill he was waiting for; he surprisingly found out that the young king who was standing in front of him maintained a strange expression on his face. The king was calm and cold; he didn\u2019t show any signs of pleasing or flattering Semak.Suddenly, Semak\u2019s smile disappeared.\u201cYoung and ignorant king, my patience is limited. Please do want I have said immediately. Otherwise, hehehe, trust me, your little kingdom wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the anger of a Knight Captain.\u201dIn unison with Semak\u2019s \u201cultimatum\u201d, \u201cTink, tink, tink!\u201d the red caped cavalry all drew out their sharp swords and started at Fei ferociously and threateningly. Nasty and cruel grins appeared on their faces as they knocked their armour with the hilt of their swords and made huge \u201ctinking\u201d noises.Previously, this tactic had been very effective against other level 6 and level 5 affiliated kingdoms. Even if some kings were resistant, they would almost sh*t their pants and kneel down to beg for their lives. At that moment, the cavalry almost saw the fantastic scene where this young king would bite the bullet and let his glamorous fianc\u00e9e do the roundtable dance\u2026\u2026However \u2013\u201cAlright, how do you bastards want to die!?\u201dThat was the response from the young king.\u201cWhat? What\u2026\u2026What did he say?\u201d The cavalry stared at each other in unison.The egoistic cavalry couldn\u2019t process the information fast enough in their minds, \u201cWhat\u2026\u2026 How dare a king of a little level 6 affiliated kingdom say such a thing to the noble Imperial Knight Captain? Does he want to give up his throne?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say, punk? Do you even understand what you are saying?\u201dAfter seeing Semak\u2019s face getting colder and colder, the cavalry who sliced open the teenage boy\u2019s throat felt it was a great time to flatter the Knight Captain. He rushed to Fei arrogantly and pointed at Fei\u2019s nose with his sword and swore, \u201cYou little reckless lowlife bastard! Do you think you are really a high up and powerful king? Kneel down and kiss the Imperial Knight Captain\u2019s boots and apologize, otherwise\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBam-!\u201dA muffled noise interrupted his clamoring.The cavalry hadn\u2019t even finish speaking when he suddenly felt he that was hit by something. He was shocked and he looked down confusedly. The next second, an inconceivable expression suddenly appeared on his face. He wanted to scream from this unprecedented terror, but as soon as he opened his mouth, blood spurt out and he couldn\u2019t make any sounds.A fist dripping with blood came out of his back.A series of gasping sounds could be heard.Everyone saw that when the soldier was spouting nonsense, the silent Alexander suddenly punched out and hit the reckless cavalry right on the chest. It made a daunting, crisp crackling noise, and the monstrous strength of a level 12 Barbarian was fully applied without any kind of restraint. The fist directly penetrated the cavalry\u2019s body and revealed itself on his back; all the internal organs and bones were shattered into pieces.Everyone was shocked.\u201cWhat kind of strength is that? How could it create a huge hole on a human body with a bare fist?\u201d What was even more shocking was that Alexander shook his arm the next second and shattered the entire corpse into minced meat; the pieces fell onto the ground and form piles.\u201cHiss-!\u201dAnother round of gasping was heard.The Knight Captain Semak was also shocked by the bloody scene and back off a couple steps. The other red caped cavalry were even more shocked; fear filled their eyes. After seeing the piles of steaming \u201cminced meat\u201d, their hands that were holding onto their swords started trembling.The whole square was silent; if someone were to drop a pin, everyone would hear it.\u201cGod! King Alexander killed a soldier from Zenit\u2019s Royal Canonization Legion!\u201d This shocking scene had blanked out many people\u2019s minds\u2026\u2026But at the same time, the citizens of Chambord felt very excited and thrilled.\u201cSay bastards, how do you want to die?\u201dAfter exploding a Zenit cavalry like killing an annoying fly, Fei\u2019s expression still didn\u2019t change. He shook his fist to get rid of the blood as he approached Semak and other cavalries slowly. His voice was freezing cold, his stares were as sharp as blades; with the murderous intent in his eyes, he looked at the opponents as if they were piles of rotten meat that even wild dogs wouldn\u2019t eat.\u201cHow dare you kill an imperial soldier?\u201d After the initial shock, Knight Captain Semak became enraged. Like a mating dog that got its spouse snatched, he shivered in anger and pointed at Fei and shouted, \u201cDone! Chambord is done! You are done!!! I declare that starting from this moment, Chambord kingdom is now the enemy of Zenit Empire. Start to tremble in fear! Your castle will be razed!\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201d Fei said with a dismissive expression, \u201cWe\u2019re enemies now, so what? Is Zenit Empire that great? It\u2019s hard to say whether or not Chambord will be razed, but without a doubt, none of you guys will walk out of Chambord alive.\u201dAfter he said that, he shouted, \u201cWhere is Pierce and Brook?\u201d Behind him, Pierce and Brook who finally squeezed through the crowd rushed over, half kneeled and responded after they heard the king\u2019s call, \u201cKing Alexander, your command.\u201d\u201cEvacuate the civilians, gather the King\u2019s Guard, shut down the gate and lock down the traffic in the city. Then, surround the residence of the Canonization Legion and wait for my command. Anyone who dares to resist shall be executed instantly.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dAfter hearing such a command, Brook who was experienced and prudent was surprised, \u201cIs Your Majesty planning to start a war with Zenit Empire?\u201d Even Pierce who was wooden headed was having a hard time digesting the command that he heard.On the opposite side.The infuriated Knight Captain Semak was so angry that he started laughing after he heard that, \u201cHahaha, great! Great! Great! You ignorant and reckless punk, daring to surround the residence of the Legion and confront the Empire? This is ridiculous. The six hundred cavalry in the Legion cab easily wipe out the entire Chambord Castle. It looks like this evil kingdom doesn\u2019t have to exist anymore\u2026\u2026Hahaha, I will chop your head off first, then enslave all the women in the castle and kill all men and wash the castle with your own blood!\u201dAs he was spoke, Semak drew out his sword. A yellow earth energy covered his body and two looming stars appeared on his forehead \u2013 it was the sign of a two star warrior.\u201c[Crack Rockburst]!\u201dSemak intended to kill, so he used his combat energy techniques right away. He moved first and shouted. His sword glowed as he stomped on the ground; he charged at Fei with his yellow earth energy and struck at Fei viciously with the pressure of a sliding mountain.\u201cHuh, only a two star warrior, how dare you be so rampant in front of me? You are seeking your own death!\u201dFei \u2018humphed\u2019 coldly and stood still. A white light flashed and \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 appeared in his hand. He made a lash and the golden sword collided with the double handed knight sword. After the series of sparks and a crisp metal colliding sound, Semak\u2019s yellow energy shield was shattered and his double handed knight sword was chipped mercilessly as well. He was blown back and blood leaked out of his mouth.\u201cYou\u2026..how could you have this kind of strength?\u201dSemak smashed into a huge stone statue further away. He couldn\u2019t stop spurting blood out of his mouth. His face was filled with shock and disbelief. He held onto the statue as he struggled to stand up.Fei ignored him. He stomped his feet and flashed forward. The golden sword turned into a series of golden lights. After making a sound similar to cutting tofu, out of the eight red caped cavalry, seven of them held onto their bleeding necks. They screamed as they shivered and fell to the ground. Just like the teenage boy before, they throats were sliced open and blood and foam clogged their lungs. They felt a huge amount of pain, but couldn\u2019t die right away. They struggled crazily\u2026\u2026The only cavalry that was left alive was completely petrified; he lost all of his strength. \u201cTink!\u201d The sword fell out of his hands and onto the ground; his legs trembled and a stinky and disgusting smell came from his crouch. He was scared to the point of peeing his pants.\u201cCome here and kneel down and kiss my boot!\u201dFei stared at the cavalry coldly and ordered. This was what the cavalry had said when they were provoking, so now Fei returned it back to them.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Aside from peeing and crapping his pants, he was also drooling; his drool was like a waterfall. Every word and sentence Fei said was like a sword hanging over his head, and if he gave the signal, the swords would rain down and mince him into pieces. The screams of his peers who were on the ground begging for death were still sounding in his ears; the cavalry didn\u2019t hesitate a bit and kneeled down to the ground and crawled to Fei like a dog. He stuck out his tongue and licked the dirt off of Fei\u2019s boots. After he did that, he looked up and smiled flatteringly\u2026\u2026.Fei sneered as he shook his head, \u201cHow can someone who\u2019s so arrogant yet afraid of death be worthy of being called a knight?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worthy, not worthy. I\u2019m not a knight, I\u2019m just an ordinary cavalry\u2026\u2026 Your Majesty, I beg of your mercy\u2026\u2026\u201d The knight kneeled to the ground and kowtowed like there was no tomorrow. His high up arrogance had disappeared, and he shivered as if he was a wild dog who wanted to survive.\u201cI won\u2019t kill you!\u201d Fei said.\u201cAh? Long live Your Majesty! Hail the king! Thanks you King Alexander for your kindness and greatness. I\u2026\u2026\u201d The cavalry was stoked and flattered Fei as much as he could.Fei cut him off impatiently, \u201cI won\u2019t kill you, but\u2026\u2026someone will.\u201d After he said that, Fei beckoned at the teenage boy who had his throat sliced open. That teenage boy had fully recovered under the effects of the \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011, and he was only a little bit tired now. He was standing in front of the crowd with support from his friends. After seeing King Alexander beckoning at him, he walked up excitedly and gave Fei a formal salute to greet the king.\u201cWarrior, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Fei asked with a smile.\u201cTolis, Your Majesty, my name is Fernando-Torres.\u201d The teenage boy silvered in excitement. In the previous Chambord Defense War, he joined the military recruitment on the last day, so hje was only able to guard the defense wall; he didn\u2019t get a chance to participate in the real battle. But today, he had seen the blood boiling heroic scene of King Alexander dismantling and destroying the enemies almost all on his own. At that moment, King Alexander had become Torres\u2019 role model and inspiration. Every young man had dreams of becoming a hero; Torres told himself that he had to become a great warrior just like King Alexander, even if he had to face cruel enemies and a cold death; nothing would stop him. That\u2019s why when he saw the imperial cavalry and knights disrespecting the future queen Angela, he stood out first and reprimanded them.Fei tapped Torres\u2019 shoulder gently; he kicked the cavalry\u2019s sword on the ground and flipped in into the air. Fei grabbed the sword in mid-air and passed it to Torres, \u201cTorres, do you dare kill someone?\u201dTorres hesitated. He wanted to say no, but he quickly remember the bloody and thrilling scene on the stone bridge today. He bit his teeth and answered decisively, \u201cI do, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cAlright then, help me kill this bastard who dares to insult our Chambord Kingdom.\u201d Fei pointed at the cavalry who was kneeling on the ground begging for mercy; that poor man had lost the courage to resist. After seeing Torres approaching with the sword, he didn\u2019t dare run away and just continued kowtowing.This was the first time that Torres would kill someone.Honestly, when he was walking towards the cavalry, he was very scared. But at the moment when he struck down with the sword and the hot spurting blood stained his face, Torres felt something ignite in his soul. He wasn\u2019t no longer scared of anything and his blood felt as if it was boiling.\u201cGreat, Fernando-Torres, from now on, you shall be my personal guard!\u201d Fei was satisfied with Torres\u2019 performance.When he saw the teenage boy in front of him standing up for Angela and the dignity of the kingdom and didn\u2019t back off when faced against the sharp swords of the imperial cavalry and knights, Fei had a favorable impression of the sixteen year old Torres. The bravery of a person who was fully armored and had an absolute advantage was not reliable; only when one was in a disadvantaged state and had nothing to depend on would bravery truly come from their soul. It was obvious that although he was shivering when he held onto the sword, the blonde haired young man was meant to be a true warrior.\u201cAh?\u201dTorres was stunned. The next second, the young boy felt like he had been hit by a gift that had fallen from the sky. He was a bit lost and didn\u2019t dare believe it. Finally, from his friends\u2019 reminders, he kneeled down and thanked the king\u2019s reward in a fluster. After he stood up and stood behind Fei, he still couldn\u2019t believe his luck. He pinched his thigh again and again; the violent pain told him that what happened wasn\u2019t a dream. He really did become the personal guard of his role model King Alexander. Torres quietly straightened his back and stood taller and looked more like a qualified warrior under the envious stares of his friends.Under the huge stone god statue on the other side, Knight Captain Semak felt like his head wasn\u2019t smart enough to process all the information.\u201cAn ant-like weak and retarded king of a level 6 affiliated kingdom, how dare he murder the Imperial Cavalry of the Zenit Empire in public so recklessly? How dare he?\u201d Semak trembled as he pointed at Fei; his lips were shaking so hard that he couldn\u2019t say a word. In the previous fight, his opponent shattered his energy shield and also his confidence with a casual strike. The arrogant Knight Captain suddenly realized that the young king in front of him was way more powerful than himself.After Fei took care of all the cavalry, he sneered as he approached Semak with a murderous intention. He repeated the same question, \u201cSay bastard, how do you want to die?\u201dA humming noise filled the Knight Captain\u2019s head. He didn\u2019t know what to do.Originally, he expected that even if this king was reckless, he would only kill the ordinary cavalry and wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to him. After all, those cavalry were only ordinary soldiers, but he was a majestic imperial military officer and a henchman of his highness, the Second Prince Zhirkov who could potentially inherit the throne from the Zenit Emperor Yassin\u2026\u2026.But he was wrong. The reckless king in front of him didn\u2019t have any intention of letting him go.At this moment, Semak was finally scared.The identity of the Military Officer from the Parent Empire could no longer protect him, nor could his strength and two star ranked earth energy. Now that the two key factors that he relied on when to threaten and pressure other affiliated kingdoms became useless, Semak finally felt how weak he was and started shivering uncontrollably.He backed off instinctively; there wasn\u2019t any more arrogance left in him. He had a scared expression on his face and was preparing to escape.At this moment \u2013\u201cPresumptuous! Alexander, stop your actions!\u201dA voice sounded in the crowd farther away. Semak\u2019s eyes brightened; he suddenly saw Little Prince Tropinski squeezing out of the crowd and appearing in the circle.\u201cYour Highness, help me Your Highness. Chambord has betrayed the Empire! This evil king is planning to take on Zenit Empire\u2026\u2026\u201d Semak forgot all about his knight\u2019s temperament and class. He crawled and rushed to Tropinski\u2019s side. He kneeled down and cried, \u201cIt\u2019s so cruel! This evil king murdered the Imperial Cavalry. He even commanded his troops to wipe out the entire Royal Canonization Legion!\u201dAll the blame and faults had been skillfully pushed onto Fei by Semak.After Little Prince Tropinski looked at all the severely wounded and almost dead cavalry on the ground and the panicked Knight Captain Semak, he questioned Fei angrily, \u201cKing Alexander, what is this? You better give me an explanation!\u201dLittle Prince Tropinski was having a lot of fun tonight. This poor and remote kingdom had allowed him to experience an unprecedented freedom and happiness; there were no more imperial teachers following him everywhere he went and telling him again and again what not to do. He didn\u2019t have to pay close attention to his father\u2019s \u2013 Emperor Yassin \u2013 mood and act accordingly, nor did he did have to swallow his anger from the insults of his older brothers Arshavin and Zhirkov. Here, he felt the warmness of the citizens, and was able to run and dance around the bonfire happily. This type of freedom was rare at St. Petersburg.This unprecedented party had slowly removed all of his dissatisfaction and bias towards Alexander. A few moments ago, he heard the Chambord citizens beside him proudly discussing Alexander\u2019s brave and heroic stories again and again. He even thought to himself, \u201cIt sounds like this King Alexander is a great man. Interesting, maybe we could become friends\u2026\u2026\u201dBut, what happened in front of him had angered greatly.Due to the crowding citizens, he had arrived after more than half of the situation had already taken place, so the Little Prince didn\u2019t know the whole story. However, it didn\u2019t matter if what Knight Captain Semak said was true or not. As the prince of the Empire, Tropinski felt that the majesty and dignity of the Empire was severely challenged. He had to stand up; if Alexander wouldn\u2019t give him a reasonable explanation, then the consequences would be catastrophic.However, the response Fei gave shocked him. He couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013\u201cExplanation? Explain what?\u201dFei\u2019s mouth drew out a disdainful arc. As if he heard something ridiculous, he continued to walk forward; he approached Semak slowly and steadily, one step after another. The golden sword felt like the life harvesting sickle of the Grim Reaper, with coldness diffusing from it. Fei stared at Tropinski and said coldly, \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t make the wrong choice. Step aside or die!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle Prince was enraged.At that moment, he clearly felt the undisguised murderous intent from the opponent. He didn\u2019t doubt that if he continued to block Fei\u2019s path, this young king would kill him without any hesitation \u2013 even if he was a high ranked imperial prince\u2026\u2026However, it was the dignity of the imperial prince that forced him not to beg or please Alexander like the last cavalry did. Although Tropinski was not a hero or even a warrior and had inappropriately attacked Fei before, at this moment, Little Prince knew that he wasn\u2019t just protecting the Knight Captain Semak, but rather the dignity of the entire Zenit Empire.Therefore, although Tropinski knew he wasn\u2019t a match for his opponent, he still had to draw his sword.\u201cEh?\u201dFei wasn\u2019t expecting this kind of behaviour from the prince. He didn\u2019t know that this playboy looking prince could be so tough in this situation\u2026\u2026but, he was only surprised. His pace didn\u2019t slow down at all. Everyone had something that they wouldn\u2019t allow anyone else to touch, and whoever violated this would face the consequences. Even if the Emperor of Zenit \u2013 Yassin was in his way, Fei wouldn\u2019t hesitate to strike him.At this moment, under the shade of a huge god statue at the side of the square, someone was getting impatient.\u201cThat guy is too audacious\u2026\u2026\u201d The female knight Susan who was hidden under a large cloak said angrily. She turned around and said to the other person hiding under the large cloak, \u201cYour Highness, please allow me to go and kill him.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t take him on.\u201d The princess shook she said lightly.\u201cHow is that possible? Your Highness, I respectfully disagree. I\u2019m a three star warrior; even if that savage was able to defeat Second Prince\u2019s vile jackal Semak, he is no match to me!\u201d It was obvious that Susan didn\u2019t trust princess\u2019 judgement.The princess shook her head and ignored Susan. She turned around and said to another person, \u201cKnight Captain Romain, it looks like you have to take action yourself this time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to serve Your Highness.\u201d The cloaked man took off the cover on his head. It was the tall and bulked smiling blonde warrior who had followed Princess Tanasha and knight Susan on the streets this afternoon.\u201cOh, this man named Alexander is interesting. Knight Captain Romain, you don\u2019t have to battle with him. Just bring Jimmy back safely.\u201d The princess added. Her voice was still weak and faint.\u201cEh?\u201d The blonde warrior was surprised, \u201cYour Highness, Deputy Knight Captain Semak, he\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe, that sly and vile jackal, it won\u2019t be a big deal to leave him to die here. He has done so many things that have shamed our Empire\u2019s honour and majesty all these years. It\u2019s time for him to suffer from his own retributions.\u201dThe smiling blonde warrior stayed quiet for a couple of seconds, then nodded and said, \u201cI understand, Your Highness.\u201d After he finished, his swayed and disappeared from the princess\u2019 side.\u201cYour Highness, although Semak deserves to die, he is the Second Prince Zhirkov\u2019s henchman. He has done many things for his highness in the dark these years. If he dies here, the Second Prince won\u2019t let it slide easily.\u201d The female Knight Susan suddenly reminded.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She smiled, \u201cWhy does I have to care if he lets it slide easily or not?\u201d Do you think Zhirkov letting Semak follow Tropinski around was due to his good intentions? It\u2019s better for me if Semak dies now; it saves me the time to ask Knight Captain Romain to do that himself! Hehe, moreover, the one who will kill Semak isn\u2019t me; it\u2019s the King of Chambord, Alexander!\u201dThe female knight Susan was stunned after she heard that.\u2026\u2026At the middle of the square.The sharp and murderous sensation that was approaching the prince felt almost like a tangible substance. The Little Prince Tropinski was shocked to find out that when he faced such pressure, he could barely stand up despite being a two star ranked warrior. However, he still bit his teeth and held himself together; he didn\u2019t even take a step back although he was having a hard time breathing.Fei continued approaching slowly.Right now, everyone\u2019s eyes blurred. However, the next moment, a tall figure appeared in the circle and stood in between Fei and the Little Prince.\u201cWho are you?\u201dFei frowned slightly. The instinct of the Barbarian warned him about the foreseeable danger. The blonde haired smiling warrior who suddenly appeared gave him an unprecedented pressure. This man was at least a three star warrior.\u201cKnight Captain Romain-Pavlyuchenko of Zenit Empire.\u201d The blonde warrior answered as he smiled. He didn\u2019t have the arrogance and egoistic appearance that Semak and the cavalry had; when he spoke, he lowered his head and saluted to show respect to the king. That made everyone think he was warm and friendly.Fei smiled back, \u201cOh? It\u2019s the mighty Knight Captain Romain-Pavlyuchenko\u2026\u2026So, have you appeared here to stop me?\u201dPavlyuchenko still had the smile on his face, and his eyebrows rose and said, \u201cKing Alexander, to be honest, I wanted to battle with you. You are the one who is the most worthy of my respect among all the kings of the affiliated kingdoms\u2026\u2026But, I have received the order from the princess. I\u2019m not here to battle with you. I\u2019m only here to take His Highness away.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dFei was surprised by the answer. He looked at the Little Prince Tropinski who was sweating like crazy and enduring under his murderous pressure, and then something in his mind was triggered. He nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m not a maniac; of course you can take him away\u2026\u2026But the bug named Semak has to stay here. He insulted Chambord first, so he has to die!\u201dThe Knight Captain Romain shrugged his shoulders, then turned around and grabbed the Little Prince by his shoulders. His body swayed and everyone felt a gold flame flash in front of their eyes; the smiling warrior and Little Prince Tropinski had disappeared into nowhere, just as if both of them had never appeared.Fei\u2019s pupil quickly contracted. He had the power of a level 12 Barbarian, but he didn\u2019t even catch Pavlyuchenko\u2019s movements; Pavlyuchenko was grabbing someone in his hands this time. \u201cIt looks like I was wrong in terms of his estimated strength. He\u2019s even more scary than I thought. He\u2019s way more powerful than a three star rank. He must be at least a four star ranked warrior.At this moment, Fei felt the urgency of improving his strength again.\u201cAfter I solve all these issues, I have to go back to the Diablo World and level up as much as I can. It looks like parent empires are just a joke. A mere two star ranked knight captain dared to flirt with the future queen recklessly at the party in an affiliated kingdom; if some of the higher ups get greedy, it would be a catastrophe for the kingdom\u2026\u2026To survive and live like humans on this continent that follow the rules of the jungle, power was essential!Fei made a decision in his mind. He raised his head and sneered as he got closer and closer to the Knight Captain Semak. Fei didn\u2019t rush to kill him. Rather, he approached him slowly. The clear and moderate paced steps stomped on Semak\u2019s heart. Fei wanted this reckless and shameless bastard to really taste the terrifying torture of silence before his death.\u201cNo\u2026\u2026No!! I\u2019m a Knight Captain of the Zenit Empire. I\u2019m a henchman of Prince Zhirkov\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t die, you can\u2019t kill me!\u201d After seeing his only savior, the Little Prince and Knight Captain Pavlyuchenko leave without even acknowledging him and the King who represented death approach him slowly, Semak was desperate. This was the first time he was this close to death, so he broke down. He screamed and yelled crazily like a cornered hyena who was roaring to threaten its opponents and protect itself.However, the figure who was coming closer didn\u2019t pause at all.\u201cNonono\u2026\u2026I apologize, I\u2019m willing to kneel down and kiss your boots\u2026\u2026I beg you, please let me go, please show some mercy\u2026\u2026\u201d Semak kneeled down and begged.But it was no use.Fei was still stepping forward coldly. Even the surrounding citizens were pumped by their king\u2019s domination. They swung their fists and shouted aggressively, \u201cKill him, kill him\u2026\u2026Kill that bastard!\u201dSemak was still begging. Numerous angry faces were light up by the bonfires. The weak ant-like low lives who Semak disdained gave him unprecedented fear as he shivered uncontrollably.Finally \u2013\u201cDamn it\u2026\u2026\u3010Crack Rockburst\u3011, die!\u201dCornered Semak picked up a sword from his subordinate cavalry and yellow earth energy rapidly swirled around him as he jumped up and suddenly attacked. The energy technique was used right away; the overwhelming momentum was like a tornado, and the strike whizzed as it flew towards Fei.\u201cHumph, child\u2019s play!\u201dFei waved the \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 in his hand.The result was unquestionable. Semak flew back like a punching bag as blood spurted out of his mouth and he smashed into the huge stone god statue again. \u201cCrackle, crackle\u201d it was the sound of cracked bones. This time, the highly arrogant Knight Captain couldn\u2019t stand up anymore.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dFei;s body swayed and suddenly appeared in front of Semak. He had lost his patience. He grabbed the knight by his hair and pulled him up. He aimed his sword at Semak\u2019s throat and whispered into Semak\u2019s ear, \u201cBastard, you want to see the roundtable dance? Go ask your mom!\u201d\u201cPuchi-!\u201dUnder the terrifying stare of Semak, \u3010Storm Sabre\u3011 penetrated his neck easily as if it were soft butter. The tip of the sword which was dripping blood appeared behind Semak\u2019s neck. Fei waved the sword; after a flash of cold light, the arrogant Knight Captain was beheaded.\u201cWhoever dares to violate Chambord\u2026\u2026 must be killed!!\u201dThe head was thrown onto the altar which was in front of all the god statues on the square. Fei raised up his sword and roared. His figure was sturdy and tall like a god. The sentence \u201cWhoever dares to violate Chambord must be killed!\u201d struck many citizen\u2019s heart. Regardless of whether it was a citizen or a soldier, they all shivered in excitement. In this era of war, they felt secure for the very first time.\u201cHail King Alexander!!\u201dBeside Fei, all of Chambord\u2019s subjects kneeled down on the ground humbly and bowed. Like the planets surrounding the sun, they all cheered \u201cHail the king\u201d as they touched the ground Fei was standing on with their heads.\u2026\u2026Far away on the stairs of the Palace north of the square.The old and handsome Bast and number one warrior of Chambord Lampard stood side by side. At this moment, none of them talked, but their eyes shined on the bonfire under the star-filled sky.As the steward of the Royal Family as well as the father to Angela, Bast should\u2019ve been the first one to rush on site and resolve the problem. But after seeing Fei\u2019s appearance, he held back the urge to rush to the situation. Later on, Bast was shocked when Fei raised his blade and killed the imperial cavalry; the first thing that came to his mind was the terrifying consequence of offending the Zenit Empire. He rushed forward and wanted to stop Fei\u2019s reckless actions\u2026\u2026but after two or three steps, he suddenly thought of something and went back to where he was standing before.At this moment, Bast\u2019s mind was completely calm.He even saw the two cloaked figures standing beside the Little Prince Tropinski and Knight Captain Pavlyuchenko on the far side of the square. As a qualified steward, Bast\u2019s eyes shined. He instantly knew who those two people were. He thought about his servitude on the way back to Chambord with the Royal Canonization Legion as he tried to figure out the intention of that women\u2026\u2026but at this moment, Bast felt there was no need for pleasantries anymore. He straightened his back and stood even taller.\u201cBast, you\u2019ve worked hard this time.\u201d Lampard who was silent suddenly said, \u201cAlthough there are some misunderstandings between you and the soldiers and citizens and they aren\u2019t friendly towards you, I believe that Alexander will eventually understand your good intentions.\u201dBast turned around and smiled back, \u201cFrank, you are wrong this time, it won\u2019t be eventually. I believe Alexander have understood my intention all along!\u201d\u2026\u2026On the far side of the square.Seeing the figure who was standing in the centre of the square and didn\u2019t hesitate to kill Semak, as well as the surrounding crowd kneeling down by the feet of that figure, the silent princess suddenly sighed and turned around as she walked away.\u201cLet\u2019s leave. We will treat this incident as if it never happened. None of the legion members can discuss this incident in private!\u201dThis was her second command for today.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Although there was a bloody incident, the celebration party for the Chambord Defense War still lasted until the enxt morning. When the sky brightened up, the citizens and soldiers gradually went back home unsatisfied. Messy traces of the carnival remained on the square.Fei got drunk after he was offered wined by everyone he saw. He stumbled back to the King\u2019s Palace with the support of Angela and Emma; he went to sleep as soon as his head touched the pillow and didn\u2019t worry about anything else.The experienced and prudent Brook didn\u2019t dare be so relaxed like the king was. Due to them killing the imperial cavalry and knight during the party, to prevent any forms of revenge, he guarded the residence of the Royal Canonization Legion himself with the other hundreds of elite soldiers.The watchmen on the defensive wall and patrol guards of the inner castle were also operating smoothly under Brook\u2019s commands. Pierce, Drogba and other soldiers also dragged their tired bodies onto the defensive wall to do night watch. Except for the incompetent king who was completely drunk, everyone else didn\u2019t relax and slack off just because of the success in the war.Finally, the sun rose to the sky from the mountains on the east side of the castle. The light brightened up the land.A new day had begun.In the King\u2019s Palace, Fei felt his ass get warm as he half-consciously rubbed his eyes and finally woke up.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he swung and struck his Barbarian Axe madly, there were just too many enemies; there was no way for him to kill them all. Finally, he became exhausted and the enemies captured and tied him up with ropes. Afterwards, a shameless jerk mage appeared out of nowhere and roasted his butt with a fireball while giggling.Fei struggled aggressively.Then he woke up.He opened his eyes; there were no enemies or mages. The truth was that he slept until noon and the hot sunlight came through the windows on the palace and shined on his naked butt\u2026\u2026\u201cDamn, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m sleeping naked?\u201dFei\u2019s mind suddenly cleared; all his fatigue was gone.He rubbed the back of his head and tried to remember what had happened on the square last night after the incident. All he remembered was that he was crowded by the enthusiastic soldiers and citizens and they all offered him drinks. Fei was an open person; once he was in the mood, he would drink as much as people offered. Ultimately, he was so drunk that he couldn\u2019t remember how he got back here and got himself into the current situation \u2013 completely naked with a rising morning wood.Fei had the urge to act like a women who was touched by a perverted man and cover his chest and scream, \u201cMan! I\u2019ve suffered a big loss. Although I\u2019m a man, I\u2019m still a virgin\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not sure if anyone saw my little brother down there.\u201dHe sat on the bed for a while and a breeze came through the window.Fei looked around. After seeing that no one was around, he got out of bed and tiptoed to the closet to grab his clothes. He rushed to get dressed. Walking nakedly in the palace everyday might not have been a big deal as a king, but Fei didn\u2019t have these kinds of perverted habits \u2013 However, during the process of getting dressed, he found something that puzzled him: people in this world didn\u2019t wear pants.Due to the lack of time and huge pressure, Fei didn\u2019t even catch that. But after he thought about it, he realized that people dressed in the style of Ancient Europe. Most poor citizens only had a large cloth on them that was tied to them by a rope. It looked like a robe, but there was nothing inside. Some people were even naked from the waist up. Nobles and wealthy families were slightly better \u2013 they wore two pieces of cloth, but Fei didn\u2019t know if they had any underwear on them. Fei found that he only had a triangular piece of silk cloth for his crotch. Except for that, not to mention pants, many people .didn\u2019t even wear skirts of any type. They walked around with their thighs exposed. Only the wealthy nobles would wear \u201cpants\u201d similar to dresses; smaller pieces of cloth were linked together with golden strings and placed under the larger cloth, allowing for the breeze to easily reach those areas.After he got dressed, Fei felt uncomfortable because his dong was chilly.After some thinking, he decided to wear the leather knight armour, because least this armour guarded his dong. Although there was a lot of friction from rubbing against each other, it would protect his dong more than if it were just hanging loose.The palace was quiet and Fei turned around and walked to a window.It was massive \u2013 about the size of a huge door. The palace was made with piles of huge white stones; it looked very magnificent. Giant stone pillars and statues of gods stood in the room, and incredible murals occupied the walls. Giant windows were open on all four sides of the walls. Sunshine and wind easily came into the room and made Fei feel like he was merged with nature.This world was not as polluted as Earth; the sun was bright, the grass was green and the birds flew and sung in the blue, clear sky.Due to the terrain, the King\u2019s Palace was higher than all the structures beside it. Standing by the window, Fei could easily view the scenery of the whole castle. After some detailed observations, Fei found out that this was a castle that was also made purely from piling huge white stones. Except for a few structures, most of the residential houses were made from huge stones. The streets were wide and open and were all layered by this unknown white stones. Ten or twenty yard (m) high statues were standing everywhere. It was the first time that Fei had time to look at his kingdom this closely. He was surprised by the clear and reasonable functionality of the region. He could vaguely distinguish the residential regions, market regions, squares, training arenas, assembly regions and ritual temples\u2026\u2026there were even some areas for garbage disposal.\u201cUnbelievable! This castle feels like it was designed by someone from the modern civilized high-tech world\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He looked across the Zuli River and his vision landed on the boundless green plains on the south bank. Fei felt that his hypothesis of Chambord Castle hiding some secret was 99.9% true. It looked like everyone currently in Chambord were latecomers and weren\u2019t the ones who actually built it. There was no way that with the current population size and construction abilities, the people of Chambord would be able to build such a classical fortress.As Fei was sighing, the sweet voice of his fianc\u00e9e Angela sounded.\u201cAlexander, you\u2019re awake. I\u2019ve already prepared you breakfast\u2026\u2026Eat it while it\u2019s still hot. After that, according to tradition, nobles and ministers will come here and give an audience to the king.\u201d Angela was carrying a golden plate with her; on top of the plate were some fresh fruits and a cup of steaming goat milk.Fei ate his breakfast while looking at Angela who was smiling; his mood was better than ever. He peeked at Angela\u2019s sky-blue open neck dress and thought lewdly, \u201cIs she wearing a bra and panties under that? For women on the Azeroth Continent, could it be that except for dresses and robes, they also only have a triangular silk cloth to cover their privates?\u201d\u201cMaybe I should change the dress code for the people of Chambord. Men deserve to be able to protect their balls and women shouldn\u2019t have to have a pair of saggy breasts!\u201dFei envisioned the clothing reform in his head.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat? Bazzer and Gill both disappeared?\u201dOne hour later at the King\u2019s Executive Hall, Fei sat uncomfortably on the throne clustered by two lion monsters\u2019 statues that were on top of three yard (m) high stairs. He was surprised after he listened to Brook\u2019s report.\u201cPlease forgive my negligence, King Alexander, The soldiers who were monitoring Bazzer all night didn\u2019t find anything unusual. But this morning, the head minister\u2019s butler panicked out of the mansion and reported that Bazzer and his son disappeared during the night.Brook lowered his head and said with a shameful expression.Fei was a bit stunned; according to Brook\u2019s previous descriptions, Head Minister Bazzer was an ordinary person who didn\u2019t have any energy or magic and his son Gill was only a novice mage. They wouldn\u2019t just suddenly disappear and escape under such close monitoring, unless\u2026\u2026\u201cBrook, it\u2019s not your fault\u2026\u2026\u201d Lampard who was quiet suddenly said, \u201cIf Bazzer wants to leave, no one in Chambord could stop him, even if both King Alexander and I tried to stop him together.\u201dMany people gasped in the hall; none of them knew why though.\u201cA three star warrior and a king that can kill three star warriors can\u2019t stop a thin old man? How?\u201dSeeing many people staring at him with perplexed expressions, Lampard continued: \u201cA long time ago, I discovered that for some reason, a powerful three star warrior was on Bazzer\u2019s side and was working for him. I even battled with that mage in private, but I wasn\u2019t able to defeat him\u2026\u2026to a three star mage, if he wants to take two people and leave Chambord Castle without getting the soldiers\u2019 attention, it\u2019s too easy.\u201d\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d\u201cA three star mage? Lord\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBazzer had a mage working for him?\u201d\u201cNo wonder why Gill was a novice mage, so that\u2019s why\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn Bro, that guy hid really deep.\u201dAfter hearing the number one warrior reveal this secret, many people in the hall stared at each other and their faces paled. None of them could have thought that aside from Lampard, the proud three star warrior of Chambord, there was also a three star mage hiding in the dark\u2026\u2026It was too bad that the mage was working for Bazzer, the ambitious schemer. Otherwise, with a mage and a warrior, two three star masters could instantly raise Chambord Kingdom into a level 5 affiliated kingdom, and becoming a level 4 affiliated kingdom wasn\u2019t a dream anymore.However, people also instantly understood the reason that despite the fact that Bazzer abused his power and lusted over Alexander\u2019s throne, the number one warrior who was also the best friend of the old king only protected Alexander\u2019s life and stabilized the military, but didn\u2019t restraint Bazzer\u2019s behaviours. Many people were disappointed by that. Now, they have uncovered the root cause.Fei nodded as well.When he switched to Sorcerer Mode in the watchtower on the defensive wall, he felt a huge flux of magic power beside Bazzer and suddenly understood many of the problems. Now that Lampard confirmed this, it further supported his hypothesis. \u201cBut how did a little figure like Bazzer gain the loyalty of a powerful three star warrior?\u201dFei was baffled.\u201cBrook, start a search throughout the entire castle to confirm that Bazzer has left and is not hiding somewhere in Chambord and conspiring against us\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei waved his hand and put a close to the discussion of this incident. \u201cAlso, free all the servants and slaves at Bazzer\u2019s mansion; let them fend for themselves. The mansion and all their belongings shall become the king\u2019s.\u201dAfter he said that, Fei sat high up on the beast throne and glanced at everyone in the Executive Hall: Pierce, Drogba, Brook, Torres, Lampard\u2026\u2026also the old handsome Bast, and a couple highly respected and reputable elders at Chambord. These people would be the future key leaders of Chambord.\u201cUnfortunately, the strength of this team is too weak. I have to find ways to improve everyone\u2019s strength\u2026\u2026Can I find some solutions in the Diablo World?\u201d Fei thought to himself, \u201cPlus, reconstruction of the military and correcting the Kingdom\u2019s laws and policies will also have to be put on the agenda. On this war-driven continent, constantly increasing our strength and power is the only way to survive.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: The Kingdom\u2019s PoliciesAlthough he had some ideas and plans, Fei didn\u2019t immediately change the structure of the military and the kingdom\u2019s policies. He\u2019d only been here for three days, so there were too many things that he didn\u2019t know about. If he tried to rush everything, it could potentially create more problems and take longer to implement the changes.Fei was planning to use these couple days to get to know more about the kingdom.The meeting continued. It wasn\u2019t as serious and majestic as the meetings with kings and emperors in TV series and movies on Earth. It was quite the opposite; the atmosphere in the Executive Hall was very lively. In the area under the throne was an artificial thin flowing river going through the hall. There were even a few pretty goldfish swimming in it. On both sides, there were two rows of neatly placed stone chairs. Soft leather covered the chairs so the participants of the meeting could voice their opinions comfortably. Everyone had equal power and opportunity; they could stand up and state their opinions without the king\u2019s consent, and they would even get into heated arguments if they had conflicting opinions.A subtle and infant feeling of democracy and liberty quietly diffused into the hall.This was the first meeting that Fei hosted as a king after his \u201crecovery\u201d into a normal person, so everyone with status had the chance to participate. On the side of the military, except for the general Brook, the twenty-two strongmen including Pierce and Drogba had formal seats. These \u201cleaders\u201d of Chambord said whatever came to their minds regarding the structure of the kingdom. Some gave very constructive ideas, while others came prepared and gave Fei their opinions written on paper made from white cloths and animal skins, especially the couple of white haired, highly respected and reputable elders at Chambord. Like magic, they took out huge stacks of paper with huge essays explaining their opinions and recommendations written on it. Fei felt his head getting dizzy just by looking at the size of the stacks.There were floods of opinions and recommendations, some explaining the abuse of power of the former Head Minister Bazzer and others showing their disappointment in the previous Alexander\u2019s IQ. Chambord had numerous tedious affairs for the king to deal with. Fei felt buried in all the paperwork. Seeing the mountain of documents in front of him and the pages of recommendations his secretary was recording down on the side, Fei felt his head starting to hurt. He rubbed his eyes and shook his head painfully.Seeing Fei act in this manner, the strongmen laughed gloatingly. Even the old and handsome Bast had a meaningful smile on his face.Fei was pissed, but an idea suddenly flashed in his mind. He said to his future father-in-law righteously, \u201cUncle Bast, I\u2019m not even an adult yet and I don\u2019t have any experience. As an elder, you have to help me. Hehehe, how about this, can you separate and organize these paperwork and documents for me and make recommendations on each one? That way, it\u2019ll be easier for me to make decisions.\u201dBast was stunned after hearing Fei\u2019s words.Maybe Fei hadn\u2019t even realized it, but all the duties he described were part of the job of the former Head Minister Bazzer. This request from Fei meant that he had given all the executive powers of the kingdom to Bast\u2026\u2026That meant from today onwards, Bast would become the new Head Minister; this sudden appointment overwhelmed the old fox Bast.He didn\u2019t even have enough time to react, and the other people in the hall didn\u2019t expect anything like this either.For a moment, the atmosphere in the Executive Hall became silent. After three or four seconds of silence \u2013\u201cYour Majesty, I must respectfully disagree!\u201d Someone stood up.\u201cKing Alexander, I disagree as well\u2026\u2026\u201d Another instantly chimed in.\u201cYes\u2026\u2026. King Alexander, Bast is a dirty and shameless traitor. He\u2019s stolen more than half of royal property only half a month ago. Because of Angela, we let it slide, but his actions are still unforgivable. How could we let a man that lacks integrity and honor take on such an important role of Head Minister?\u201d\u201cI agree! Young King Alexander, you can\u2019t be partial!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 I feel the same way\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a wave of disagreement exploded and the whole Executive Hall became chaotic. Fei didn\u2019t expect such a situation to arise. He glanced around quietly and was surprised to find that Brook and the strongmen who were sitting on the west side of the hall didn\u2019t say anything; rather, the ones who were the noisiest were a dozen of new faces. These dozen people appeared in front of him; most of them were dressed luxuriously with silk robes and diamond and crystal embedded silver crowns. They all seemed energetic and spoke passionately. They patted their chests and appeared great and dutiful.\u201cWho are they?\u201d Fei turned his head and whispered to his personal guard Torres.After the blonde boy heard that, he lowered his head and whispered back, \u201cMy King, the six men in the front of you wearing the silver crowns are the high nobles in the castle, and the five luxuriously dressed men are the wealthiest merchants in the kingdom. According to the customs of the kingdom, these people have important roles in the King\u2019s meetings; they can even influence the king\u2019s decisions.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d Fie nodded and vaguely understood what was going on.Regardless of whether it was on Earth or in this world, there were always some well-spoken and seemingly loyal politicians who had tons of wealth taken from society and enjoyed the power to act above the law. They could take credit from the military, play around with their powers, form conspiracies and promote their \u201cjustice and honour\u201d. All of it was to satisfy their own selfish desires.At this moment, the nobles and merchants in the Executive Hall were acting the same way.This discovery made Fei sigh again, \u201cSo Alexander the King was living such a chaotic and wronged life. How could these fat and stupid profit driven merchants appear in the King\u2019s Executive Hall? The whole place is as noisy and chaotic as an open market\u2026\u2026It looks like Chambord Kingdom is just like a small town on Earth and I\u2019m just the town\u2019s mayor\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei realized that to build the ideal kingdom in his mind, there was still a long way to go.\u201cQuiet, stop arguing. You, tell me your name.\u201d Fei waved his hand and raised his voice to interrupt the heated argument. He pointed at the silver crowned man at the very front yelling the loudest and asked.\u201cLouis, Your Majesty. I\u2019m Viscount Louis.\u201d The silver crowned man stepped up and lightly bowed with a standard noble\u2019s salute, and then answered proudly.\u201cOh, Viscount\u2026\u2026Louis?\u201dFei felt that the entire name was hard to pronounce. To be honest, he had no idea how the Western Titling system worked, but that didn\u2019t affect his next question, \u201cMr. Viscount, if Uncle Bast isn\u2019t a good fit, who else do you think could perform this duty well?\u201d\u201cKing Alexander, to be clear, I\u2019m not trying to be haughty, but I firmly believe that I am the best candidate\u2026\u2026\u201dLouis tapped his chest again and said proudly, \u201cI\u2019m the most pure-blooded noble in Chambord. My father had the honour of being summoned by the Emperor of Zenit and meeting him in person. My family has a proud history and innumerable honours. I\u2026\u2026Therefore, I\u2019m the most proper candidate for the position of Head Minister.\u201dBefore he could finish, the other nobles and merchants stood up one by one and applauded as they voiced their agreement.Brook and the strongmen on the other hand all showed disdain on their faces.Fei shook his head as he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or be angry. He knew exactly what this is \u2013 it was a battle for power and profit between the politicians. However, the few unqualified politicians in front of him were too stupid; their act was too lame and created the laughable scene. Fei looked at Louis who was still proudly announcing his noble honours disgustingly, then he suddenly said, \u201d Alright Viscount\u2026.eh\u2026Louis. I only have one question for you. If your answer can satisfy me, then the position of Head Minister is yours.\u201dLouis was stoked. He said confidently, \u201cYour Majesty, please ask! I bet you that there isn\u2019t anyone out there that\u2019s better at executive duties than me.\u201d\u201cSounds good. Now let me ask you this: when all the soldiers and citizens of Chambord were battling and bleeding for the kingdom, WHERE.WERE.YOU?\u201dFei sat high up on his throne. He sneered as he said each word; he didn\u2019t even try to to hide his ridiculing expression.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d Viscount Louis was stunned.\u201cHahaha, when we were fighting and bleeding alongside the King, Mr. Viscount must have been hiding under a woman\u2019s crotch and shivering and whining. Hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Drogba was a straightforward man. After he listened to that much bullsh*t, he couldn\u2019t help but stand up and mock Louis and his followers. Brook and rest of the strongmen instantly burst in laughter.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 you bunch of dirty ruffians\u2026\u2026 Since when were you guys eligible to appear in the Executive Hall?\u201d Viscount Louis\u2019s face suddenly turned red, and yelled as he explained himself, \u201cNobles have the right to be exempt from war recruitments\u2026\u2026As the most pured-blooded noble in Chambord, of course I won\u2019t be like you bunch of lowly farmers, doing all the boring jobs of fighting and killing.\u201d\u201cFighting and killing are boring?\u201d Fei\u2019s face turned cold as he heard that. He said angrily, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it. Viscount Louis, I\u2019m very dissatisfied with your response. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be getting the position of Head Minister\u2026\u2026Also, dear Viscount, be careful who you insult. These people you call ruffians are the heroes that defended Chambord. If I hear you disrespecting the heroes of Chambord again, you\u2019ll have the honour of being the first unlucky soul that has his noble title stripped away by me.\u201dAs he said that, his murderous intention was no longer able to be contained within his eyes.Louis was stunned and didn\u2019t dare say a word.Then, Fei turned around and said to his future father-in-law, \u201cUncle Bast, it looks like I have to trouble you with organizing the documents and paperwork for me. Hehe, this Viscount Louis just reminded me; I now formally declare that starting from today, you shall be appointed as the new Head Minister of Chambord.\u201dBy this point, Bast had completely calmed down from his initial shock. After hearing this formal appointment, the old handsome man didn\u2019t decline; he bowed gracefully to show his acceptance.\u201cHumph, Your Majesty, I disagree. You can\u2019t do this! This is clearly favouritism\u2026\u2026 Appointing a traitor as the Head Minister would destroy the entire Chambord Kingdom.\u201d Within the group of fat merchants who were sitting on the east side of the hall, one bearded fat merchant stood out bravely and challenged Fei\u2019s decision unconvincingly as he saw Viscount Louis\u2019 meaningful glance.Fei was enraged.If someone was a coward, then they should\u2019ve just tucked in their balls and pretended to be dead. However, the men in front of Fei were pushing him to his limit. They acted as if they were righteous and dutiful. Fei hated these kinds of fake politicians; crappy memories about this from his life on Earth suddenly appeared in his mind. His didn\u2019t hold back at all as he slammed his palms onto the handles of the throne, stood up, pointed at the fatty\u2019s nose and swore in a rough manner, \u201d Go f*ck yourself! I like favouritism; who do you think you are? What can you do about it? From now on, these kinds of embarrassing dumbasses shall never appear in my palace again\u2026\u2026 Where are the guards? Throw these unqualified fat pigs out of here!\u201dAs soon as Fei finished, a dozen of armoured soldiers rushed in, took away the couple of fat merchants and threw them onto the streets.Under the gasps and unbelievable expressions on everyone\u2019s faces, the six remaining nobles stared at each other in embarrassment and finally sat back down quietly in their seats.Fei sat high up on the throne. He glanced around, and not a single noble dared to look him in the eyes.The immense power of the nobles, the messed up power distribution and political system had strengthened Fei\u2019s determination in restructuring the kingdom\u2019s administrative system and the military. \u201cSince I\u2019m already the King of Chambord and my fate is closely tied with the people in front of me, I can\u2019t afford to not work hard. I have to change the current situation and guard and protect all the things that I treasure.\u201dAfter he thought about it, Fei knew treating a deadly disease needed heavy medicine. He had to give the kingdom a heavy dose of medication to solve this problem.He switched to Paladin Mode and a holy, bright and honorable sensation emanated from his body. He stood up in front of the throne and with a firm expression on his face, he said decisively, \u201cAs the King of Chambord, I declare that during these next ten days, I will be revolutionizing the power distribution, administrative systems and military. From today on, all the orders and procedures in the administrative system and military shall be abolished, and the whole kingdom shall enter a 10 day long post-war adjustment. During this time, all the administrative and executive tasks shall be taken care of by Bast, and military duties shall be taken care of by Brook. If any of you have good ideas for this reconstruction and revolution, talk to Bast and Brook about it and they will report it to me.\u201dThe magnificence of the king and the holiness of the paladin combined together at this moment. Fei\u2019s voice echoed around the palace. No one dared to refute him; everyone bowed and submitted to Fei\u2019s command. Even the nobles who felt reluctant sweated buckets and didn\u2019t dare to talk. Under this atmosphere, they even felt the illusion of everything being the way it should be.This was the benefit of Paladin Mode; it could increase one\u2019s persuasion, influence and majesty and make opponents submit to one\u2019s commands. It was the most recent cheating method that Fei figured out.After that resolution had been passed, the meeting afterwards went pretty smoothly.As the meeting was finishing, Brook, one of the two new authorities of Chambord stood up and mentioned something else, \u201cMy King, there\u2019s something very important that I have to remind you about. In about half a year, the Military Exercise between all the affiliated kingdoms under Zenit Empire hosted every three years will begin. If we want to get a good rank, we have to start preparing now.\u201dAfter Brook said that, everyone in the hall nodded and made sounds to agree with him. The atmosphere was getting heated again. Drogba stood up and yelled as he hammered his chest, \u201cThis time, we have to wreck our old rival Blackstone Kingdom and advance to a level 5 affiliated kingdom.\u201dFei was curious and asked, \u201cAffiliated Kingdom\u2019s Military Exercise? Eh, what\u2019s that for?\u201dRegarding the fact that after King Alexander returned to normal, he had always forgotten a lot of basic and common sense information, everyone had gotten used to it. Brook explained patiently, \u201cYour Majesty, the Military Exercise is a competition hosted by our parent Empire-Zenit to measure the strength of each kingdom, so all of Zenit\u2019s affiliated kingdoms must participate. If we perform well in this competition, we will have a chance to advance Chambord\u2019s position to a level 5 affiliated kingdom. This is a great opportunity for us.\u201d\u201cAdvance to a level 5 affiliated kingdom? Are there any benefits?\u201d\u201cOf course, your Majesty. Chambord is currently a level 6 affiliated kingdom of Zenit Empire, and ranked the lowest among all other kingdoms. Therefore, we are only able to receive a very limited amount of support from Zenit Empire. If we take this opportunity and advance to a level 5 affiliated kingdom, we wouldn\u2019t just receive more and better materials and financial support; we would also be allowed to increase the number of citizens and soldiers that Chambord has to get more land and territory. We could even possibly be rewarded with higher star ranked energy training scrolls. With all of that, the strength of Chambord would be improved significantly!\u201dThis was the first time that Fei heard anything like this. He asked without thinking, \u201cAre there currently limitations on the population size and military size of Chambord? Also, you mentioned land and energy training scrolls\u2026How does that work?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, according to the Law of Zenit, a level 6 affiliated kingdom can only have less than 10,000 citizens, 500 soldiers, only one castle and less than 500 acres of land. Once a kingdom surpasses these restrictions, the excess property would be stripped away if given a light punishment, or the kingdom would be severely punished by the parent empire for breaking the law if given a harsh punishment. Also, level 6 affiliated kingdoms can only have two star ranked energy training scrolls and two star ranked energy technique scrolls. Trading and acquiring higher ranked energy and technique scrolls are strictly prohibited; the consequences of violating of this law would be even more severe.\u201d Brook continued, \u201cOnce we advance to a level 5 affiliated kingdom, Chambord will be able to acquire and retain double the resources it currently has now, and Chambord\u2019s strength will increase exponentially\u2026\u2026in accordance with that, if we could advance to a level 4, level 3, level 2 or even level 1 affiliated kingdom, the restrictions would loosen up even more.\u201d\u201cWhat are these sh*tty laws? Doesn\u2019t Zenit Empire want its affiliated kingdoms to get better and stronger?\u201d Fei couldn\u2019t instantly understand.\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying on the Azeroth Continent \u2013 a dog that\u2019s too vicious can rip out its owner\u2019s throat. To the parent empires, they must make sure that their dictatorship won\u2019t be threatened by anyone else. So on the basis of not decreasing the overall strength and power of the empire, all the strength and power of their affiliated kingdoms must be strictly limited.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Re-entering DiabloFei was surprised, but he quickly understood what Brook meant. This situation was almost like colonization.Fei nodded and asked another question, \u201cContinue, how exact does this Military Exercise work?\u201d\u201cMy King, according to Zenit Empire\u2019s traditions, the Military Exercise comes in two forms. The first form is a battle between the strongest individuals among all the kingdoms. Every affiliated kingdom can send their six most powerful mages or warriors to participate in the battle. The second form is a battle between troops of each kingdom. Every kingdom can send 100 elite soldiers to participate in four rounds of matches. There will be 10 matches for both battles. The kingdoms that win the most matches during the selection round will maintain their current affiliated levels. On top of that, they will also receive the opportunity to challenge a higher leveled kingdom; if they defeat them, they can take its place and advance levels.\u201d Brook, the new [Military Guru] at Chambord was afraid that King Alexander didn\u2019t understand, so he explained everything in detail.\u201cAlright, so how did we perform in the last Military exercise?\u201dBrook\u2019s expression was dejected, and the other people in the hall lowered their heads as well. The atmosphere turned cold and depressing. After a while, Brook took a deep breath and said, \u201cYour Majesty, Chambord was originally a level 4 affiliated kingdom and had influence among all the other affiliated kingdoms. However, in the Military Exercise three years ago, we were defeated continuously by both Hull Kingdom and Blackstone Kingdom, and that resulted in our drop to a level 6 affiliated kingdom. Therefore, if we can\u2019t succeed in the next Military Exercise, our kingdom status will be stripped away and Chambord Castle will be awarded to the other great performers as a prize by Zenit Empire.\u201d\u201cDropping 2 levels in one competition?\u201d Fei was surprised, \u201cSince we were a level 4 affiliated kingdom, our strength shouldn\u2019t have been weak. How did we perform so horribly?\u201dAfter Fei said that, the atmosphere in the hall became very awkward.Brook coughed and said, \u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u2026Last\u2026\u2026Unfortunately, two month prior to the last Military Exercise, the old king passed away. It\u2026\u2026It was you who was in command. Eh, your intelligence\u2026\u2026You weren\u2019t normal yet\u2026\u2026so\u2026\u2026Eh\u2026\u2026Except for Mr. Lampard who won his battle, we lost all the other 19 matches, so\u2026\u2026Eh, so we dropped down to a level 6 affiliated kingdom.\u201dFei was suddenly embarrassed. Very embarrassed.He now understood why the other people in the Executive hall had weird expressions on their faces. \u201cSo it\u2019s because of me that we\u2019re in such a terrible position. The reason we lost so badly was due to the disappointment of the previous Alexander. But there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. How could we not lose when a retard who had the intelligence of a three year old commanded the troops?\u201d\u201cCough, cough.\u201d So it\u2019s like that\u2026\u2026Eh, you\u2019re right. Both Hall Kingdom and Blackstone Kingdom are truly hateful. We have to redeem ourselves this time\u2026\u2026Brook, you can handle this, start preparing right away\u2026\u2026 \u201cCough cough.\u201d That\u2019s all for today. The meeting is dismissed, dismissed. Hehehe!\u201dFei was ashamed and embarrassed, so he dismissed the meeting immediately.Everyone in the hall saw the king\u2019s embarrassment. The nobles blinked their eyes as they saluted and exited the hall; Drogba, Pierce and a couple other guys laughed heartlessly. They winked at Fei and also turned around and left the Palace. Fei had to hold himself back from pointing his middle finger at them.Everyone else was gone except for Brook.\u201cMy military commander, do you have anything else to report?\u201d Fei asked curiously.Brook suddenly kneeled onto the ground; he spoke with a pleading expression on his face, \u201cMy king, please hear this presumptuous request of mine. I wish that you could revamp Chambord\u2019s Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon. Mr. Peter-Cech is very loyal to the kingdom, and because he didn\u2019t want to conspire with the former Head Minister Bazzer, he was framed for treason and prosecuted. There are many other innocent people who were framed just like Mr. Peter-Cech in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon. Brook earnestly requests Your Majesty to cleanse this injustice and pardon the innocent people.\u201d\u201cPeter-Cech?\u201dThe name sounded familiar to Fei. After thinking a little, he quickly remembered that he heard this name the night before when he was getting information about this world from Brook. Peter-Cech was the former First Commander of the King\u2019s Guards and was higher positioned than Brook. However, he was locked up in prison after he offended Bazzer, so Fei never got the chance to meet him.By the extremely concerned expression on Brook\u2019s face, Fei felt that this First Commander Peter-Cech should be a righteous warrior. Moreover, he could stay on top of Brook who was a one star warrior, which meant that Cech\u2019s strength should be higher than one star. These kinds of masters were what Chambord needed the most at the time.\u201cYou can head to Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon right now and pass on my command. Tell Warden Oleg to organize the prison and pause all interrogations and torture. I will be visiting the prison with my guards this afternoon to review the files for each prisoner.\u201dBrook was dazed. He quickly saluted in extreme gratefulness and turned around and walked out of the palace.Fei sat quietly on the three or four yard (m) high stone throne. Numerous thoughts came to his mind as he stared at the empty Executive Hall. This was the first time that he issued orders as the king. The feel of controlling everything was ecstatic. From now on, he would be the supreme leader of the kingdom. Although Chambord was as weak as a newborn who struggled to walk, to Fei who had the support of the magical Diablo World, it was a perfect point. One day, he would use this to agitate and move the entire Azeroth Continent.\u201cI hope Warden Oleg isn\u2019t that dumb. If he understands what I mean by this, he will make some changes in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon in half a day to recover some of his previous mistakes.\u201dA mysterious smile came onto Fei\u2019s face.Although he wanted to enter the Diablo World to improve his strength, the main reason that he didn\u2019t go with Brook to immediately revamp the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon was that more or less, he wanted to give Warden Oleg some time to prepare. Oleg was one of Bazzer\u2019s henchmen, and he had made a lot of mistakes, and was also very afraid of death and wasn\u2019t a brave warrior. However, he was a one star warrior and did gain some credit in the soul-stirring battle on the stone bridge yesterday. Fei decided to give him a chance; half a day was enough time for him to make up for some of his mistakes. That way, it would give Fei a reason to let him live on.\u201cFernando, go and find Uncle Bast. Let him prepare a document on all the information about the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon. If he can provide detailed information for each prisoner, that would be even better.\u201d Fei said to the young guard Fernando-Torres behind him.\u201cAs you wish, Your Majesty! But, Mr. Bast doesn\u2019t control the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon, I\u2019m afraid that there isn\u2019t much information on his end\u2026\u2026\u201dFei smiled as he shook his head, \u201cFernando, don\u2019t worry. Just go and notify him.\u201dHe rubbed his chin as he watched the blonde boy exit the hall.\u201cHow could Bast not know what\u2019s going on in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon?\u201d Fei dared to bet his lower body that there wasn\u2019t anything that the old fox didn\u2019t know in Chambord. He knew that his father-in-law wasn\u2019t as simple as he appeared to be on the surface. Maybe he and the number one warrior Frank-Lampard were preparing for this day to come all along!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Diablo WorldAt the edge of the \u3010Cold Plain\u3011, dark clouds covered the sky and it rained rhythmically.After a slight buzzing noise, \u3010Necromancer Fei\u3011 fell from the sky and landed on a pile of corpses of monsters and demons. The land was stained by blood, and corpses and limbs were scattered everywhere. Crowds of bluebottle flies flew off the corpses due to Fei\u2019s sudden appearance. It had been a while since Fei left the Diablo World, and all the monsters and demons who were after Fei had dispersed.Fei picked out some valuable items that were dropped by the monsters and used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011. He walked into the portal got returned to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and found Female Blacksmith Charsi and sold all the items he didn\u2019t need to this sullen NPC.Fei didn\u2019t return to the wild and try to level up.He exited from Necromancer Mode and returned to the 3D character selection screen. Without hesitating, he chose Barbarian Mode and re-entered the Diablo World.\u3010Barbarian Fei\u3011 appeared directly in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.The third quest of \u3010The Forgotten Tower\u3011 was already activated when he was rescuing the old \u201cobscene\u201d Cain, so he didn\u2019t have to find a NPC to get the quest. He walked towards Kashya, the Military Leader of the camp and found the hot mercenary Elena.\u201cMr. Fei, you finally came!\u201dAfter seeing Fei\u2019s arrival, Elena was super happy. An unprecedented smile came onto her face as she ran towards Fei from her tent.A dozen young and pretty female rogues followed Elena. Their smiled and giggled as they stared at Fei with curiosity and envy.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wow, he\u2019s a little different from what I\u2019d imagined. I didn\u2019t know that a Barbarian could be this handsome!\u201d\u201cHeehee, yeah, look at his muscles. He\u2019s so muscular\u2026\u2026 No wonder he could travel on the dangerous moor alone!\u201d\u201cWarrior, you have to take good care of Sister Elena. She\u2019s the prettiest \u3010Rogue Flower\u3011 and also a strong and reliable magic archer\u2026\u2026Heehee, I bet you didn\u2019t know that after hearing that you were going to challenge the Fallen Paladin Griswald-Edward, Sister Elena has been super worried for the last couple of days; she was even calling your name in her dreams!\u201dA bunch of flower-like youthful female rogues crowded Fei and Elena as they twittered and laughed like sparrows, flirting with both of them.Some of the more daring girls even walked up to Fei and giggled as they touched Fei\u2019s ripped pecs and biceps with their cold hands. These cold female rogues who protected \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and battled against monsters on the moor had shown their naughty side.When the women started \u201cbullying\u201d them, it was terrifying. Fei was overwhelmed with all the surrounding female rogues; a bright blush also covered Elena\u2019s beautiful white face. After Fei realized that the situation was turning in the other direction, he grabbed Elena\u2019s small hand and ran away from the girls wind chime like laughter.\u201cI\u2019m so envious of Sister Elena, that Barbarian warrior is such an upright man!\u201d\u201cYeah, Elena is so lucky, it\u2019s rare to meet these kinds of friendly and nice travellers.\u201d\u201cHeehee, If I was Sister Elena, I would immediately make him my man\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the entrance of the female rogues\u2019 tents, the girls played with each other as they watched the two of them run away. They all had envious expressions on their faces. In this world where survival wasn\u2019t guaranteed, love was a luxurious good. Righteous and kind travellers like Fei were the ideal lovers in many female rogues\u2019 mind. However, even if they didn\u2019t die in battles with monsters, the rogues would only become the wives of farmers and reproduce to make sure that there was always fresh blood at the camp.\u2026\u2026The Barbarian character was Fei\u2019s highest leveled character, so it had the most damage and defense. Fei had decided a long time ago that he was going to main the Barbarian and level him up as fast as he could. That way, he could become powerful in the shortest amount of time. Other characters such as the Sorcerer and Paladin were defined by Fei as support roles.Before leaving to the moor and leveling up, Fei had some preparation to do.Because he broke open the stone bridge on the Zuli River, his Barbarian\u2019s double-handed axe had been destroyed in the process. Fei had to go to the female blacksmith Charsi to purchase some new items. This time, he spent 2,000 gold coins and bought another double-handed axe that had a damage of 1-30. This axe looked similar to the last axe, but the maximum damage on it increased to 3 more points; among all the axes that Charsi sold, it definitely had the highest damage.After Fei had finished purchasing his items, he suddenly found out that there was a golden exclamation mark. This meant that there was a new quest for him to complete. Fei tried to communicate with this sullen brown haired girl; after about twenty seconds of talking, just like how he expected, he received the quest to find a magic hammer at the \u3010Barrack\u3011 that would allow Charsi to build magic items.After he received the quest, he began right away. With some planning and reviewing of the map, he decided to complete the quest that was easier to get to first. Before starting Charsi\u2019s request, Fei planned to complete the third novice quest which showed up after he finished rescuing Cain \u2013 kill the Countess in the \u3010Forgotten Tower\u3011. Fei took Elena who was full of joy after their reunion through the portal in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and arrived at \u3010Dark Woods\u3011.Currently, it was noon in Diablo World. The weather surprisingly wasn\u2019t rainy, and even the dark clouds that usually never dissipated were gone. The sun appeared in the sky and shined on top of their heads; it was very warm and comfortable.After confirming the direction, both of them chugged down \u3010Stamina Potions\u3011; like an eloping couple, they ran towards the \u3010Black Marsh\u3011.\u201cOh, right. Elena, this bow might be useful to you\u2026\u2026\u201d While running and slaying a bunch of monsters, Fei suddenly remember the golden rare item \u3010Boreal Razor Bow\u3011; he kept it just for Elena. He quickly got it out of his \u3010Item Slot\u3011 and gave it to the hot mercenary.It was a light short bow. The bow\u2019s body was light gold, and numerous mysterious lines were engraved onto the curved body. A thin golden thread that exuded a soft light connected the two ends of the bow together and the whole bow was permeated with magic powers; it looked like a piece of artwork.Elena flushed. The magic archer lowered her head and revealed a rare gesture similar to that of a baby girl. She raised her hand and took the short bow out of Fei\u2019s hand lightly; her voice was soft, like the fluttering of a mosquito, \u201cThank you, Mister.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u2026Elena, don\u2019t call me mister anymore. From now on, just call my name directly.\u201d Fei was a little captivated by this mercenary\u2019s looks. He was stunned for a little bit and scratched his head as he smiled.Elena replied, \u201cAlright, Mister Fei.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Killing the Countess wasn\u2019t hard.The location of the quest was at the \u3010Forgotten Tower\u3011 in the \u3010Black Marsh\u3011. After entering the tower, they had to go to the deepest floor at level 5 to find the hidden Countess. Every level in the \u3010Forgotten Tower\u3011 was filled with all kinds of monsters and demons, including some mini-bosses too. The difficulty here was much higher; it was obvious that compared with the moors and plains outside, the underground environment were more suitable for higher leveled dark and undead creatures. Fei and Elena spent a tremendous amount of effort to get to the underground level 5 floor in the \u3010Forgotten Tower\u3011.Fei had a good plan; if the situation didn\u2019t turn out well, he would open up a town portal and send Elena back to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 first and try to take down Countess by himself using the shameless kiting and running tactic. However, as soon as they entered the fifth level, the short bow in Elena\u2019s hands bloomed with blue frost arrows continuously; like a call from the Grim Reaper, the final boss Dark Hunter Countess didn\u2019t even have a chance to chant her magic spell. She was shot by the frost arrows accurately and had a hard time moving. Fei immediately took the opportunity and charged at the Countess while swinging his new axe. In a couple of strikes, the dark hunter had fallen to the ground.\u201cDamn, why was that so easy?\u201d Fei was surprised.He realized that Elena\u2019s strength had increased beyond his expectations. That level of damage was equal to the attack of a level 8 magic archer, but Fei clearly remembered that this female rogue was only level 5 when he entered the Diablo world last time. \u201cHow did her strength increase this fast?\u201dWhen Fei was stunned and thinking, new changes occurred \u2013Numerous white lightning strikes exploded from the Countess\u2019 corpse and the whole tower began to shake, as if there was a huge earthquake and the sky was falling down. Suddenly, a golden treasure chest appeared out of nowhere; it was surrounded by a white cloud of haze. The chest was like a gold mine, and gold coins flooded out of the opening non-stop.\u201cDamn! I\u2019m rich!\u201d All Fei could see were gold coins.In the blink of an eye, the ground was covered in a layer of gold coins. The gold lights were flashy and bright. There were so many coins that the floors looked like it was layered in gold bricks. The \u201cclinking\u201d sounds of heaven from coins falling out of the chest stopped after about twenty seconds, and then the chest disappeared.Fei turned around and looked at Elena. He saw the same thing again; it looked like the natives in the Diablo World couldn\u2019t see all the items and rewards that were dropped from the monsters and bosses; Elena hadn\u2019t seen this magnificent scene, and she held onto her bow and guarded Fei. After feeling Fei\u2019s gaze, Elena\u2019s white face turned red instantly; she lowered her head and looked helplessly as she didn\u2019t know what to do.Fei was stunned yet again by the hot mercenary\u2019s reaction. He really wanted to flirt with her, but before that, he picked up all the items and gold coins first.It was a little disappointing when the Countess died; not a single rare item had dropped from the final boss in the \u3010Forgotten Tower\u3011. There were only a couple blue magic items, but at least there were over 5000 gold coins.After he cleaned up the battleground, Fei looked at his experience bar.He needed 5 of 6% before he could get to level 13. One hour had passed by already; it was the same as his estimate; more experience would be needed each level, and his leveling speed would slow down as a result.After killing the Countess, Fei and the hot mercenary immediately rushed to the next quest location \u2013 \u3010Monastery Gate\u3011 at \u3010Tamoe Highlands\u3011 to complete Charsi\u2019s request. This monastery was the holy place where nuns and monks served god. However, after the monsters and demons took over, it became a miserable hell. What was worth mentioning was that the final boss for the novice map \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011- Andariel was also hiding at this place.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he entered \u3010Monastery Gate\u3011, the first place he went was a small map on the exterior of the Monastery \u2013 \u3010Barracks\u3011.The magic hammer was in the deepest part of the \u3010Barracks\u3011. Once he obtained the hammer and brought it back to Charsi at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, she would add a couple attributes and properties to one of his items.Fei followed his memories about the map from the original game. After searching for a while, they quickly found the \u3010Barracks\u3011. This place was more like a huge maze. There were numerous chained corridors and many dark chambers attached to them; it made both Fei and Elena dizzy by just looking at them. It felt like this place was more like an underground tomb rather than a barrack. The atmosphere was very depressing; the inexplicable screams and whistles in the wind, the squeaks of the big black mice running around and the stinky and bloody smells made it feel like hell.There were monsters and demons wandering around throughout the corridors and chambers; they were all high level, such as \u3010Devilkin\u3011, \u3010Death Clan\u3011, \u3010Black Rogues\u3011 and \u3010Bone Fire Mages\u3011. Blood spilled whenever they stepped forward. Danger was hidden everywhere.After they stepped into the \u3010Barracks\u3011, battles occurred nonstop. After about half an hour of bloody fighting, Fei and Elena were covered in thick blood and white rice-like bone fragments. However, they finally found the chamber where that hammer was stored in.\u201cElena, the hammer that we\u2019re looking for is in this chamber. A powerful boss \u3010The Smith\u3011 is guarding it with a crowd of monsters. After we charge in, you have to stay behind me. Don\u2019t rush in like last time in Tristram, alright?\u201dBefore they challenged and took on \u3010The Smith\u3011, Fei remembered what happened before and urged Elena to listen to him.\u201cI got it, mister.\u201d Elena lowered her head again. She stood in the dark like a quiet, lovely orchid. The burning flame far away \u201cengraved\u201d her beautiful figure on the dark floor. She said lightly and gently, \u201cMister, I won\u2019t disappoint you this time.\u201dFei was surprised.For some reason, he felt that Elena\u2019s behaviour was weird sometimes. During battle, she was the cold, aggressive warrior; every arrow that came from her hand meant death. Under the light of the magic and rare items, she looked like a Valkyrie\u2026\u2026But when she was talking to him, she was extremely obedient, gentle and even a little bit shy. The two completely different personalities fused together in her.\u201cHehe, does this sturdy chick have feelings for me now?\u201dFei was stoked. He instinctively cared for Elena, so he turned around and continued reminding her, \u201cAlso, safety is your main priority. If the situation becomes too dangerous, you have to retreat instantly\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t worry about me, I have my own method of escaping.\u201d\u2026\u2026After three minutes.Fei finally understood that his worries and reminders were excessive. \u3010The Smith\u3011 was very powerful in his memories, but didn\u2019t even stand a chance under the joint attacks of him and his mercenary. \u3010The Smith\u3011 roared a couple times and died like a pedestrian in a superhero movie; Fei didn\u2019t even have to use any \u3010Healing Potions\u3011.\u201cPooh, this bastard died too fast. Not a single good item dropped!\u201dAfter seeing three or four blue magic items on the ground, Fei kicked \u3010The Smith\u3011\u2019s corpse. The 7 feet tall (210 cm), blue skinned monster didn\u2019t have any merits except for his strength.\u201cYou\u2019re also a boss, but why is there such a huge difference between bosses? Although \u3010Countess\u3011 at \u3010The Forgotten Tower\u3011 didn\u2019t drop any good items as well, she at least \u201cgifted\u201d me 5,000 gold coins. You didn\u2019t drop any good items or many gold coins!\u201d Being poor and stingy, there was no way that Fei wouldn\u2019t be mad.The only thing that calmed Fei down a little bit was that \u3010The Smith\u3011 granted him a large amount of experience.Fei finally leveled up again.After counting his level up while getting through the corridors and battling with the monsters and demons, Barbarian Fei was already level 14. Fei thought about it and continued the same distribution of attribute points; on top of that, he put one of the two skill points into \u3010Find Potion\u3011 and the other one into \u3010Sword Mastery\u3011.The normal items that the monsters dropped weren\u2019t even close to Fei\u2019s standards, so he didn\u2019t bother to pick them up. He checked his current status and realized that after two rounds of battles, the durability of his weapons and armour was very low, and the potions he was carrying were almost depleted. As a result, he used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011 and went back to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011He found Charsi and gave the magic hammer to this sullen girl.\u201cWow, unbelievable! You really killed \u3010The Smith\u3011 and brought back the hammer. This is amazing! Young warrior, you have won my friendship. As thanks, I will now imbue one of your items with magical powers!\u201d The female blacksmith\u2019s eyes shined as she saw the hammer. Her sullen and sad mood instantly disappeared. A bright smile shined on her beautiful face, as if all the happiness and liveliness was restored into her body. She suddenly looked younger and her attitude towards Fei was unusually enthusiastic.This change made Fei a little surprised, because it wasn\u2019t like this in the actual game.A light bulb suddenly lit in Fei\u2019s head, and he went along with Charsi\u2019s enthusiasm and started chatting with her. They had a friendly conversation, and Charsi delightfully offered a 20% discount on the repairs for Fei\u2019s current items; she even expressed that if Fei wanted, he could buy armour and weapons from her at a 20% discount.The result pleasantly surprised Fei.However, he didn\u2019t choose to imbue an item right away. This was an invaluable opportunity, so Fei wanted to think about it thoroughly and decide what item would be the best to add magical powers to.Fei also sold all the blue magic items to Charsi; with all the additional gold coins, Fei was now a rich man who had a net worth of 54,000 gold coins. He looked at the hot mercenary to his side and thought of something. He bought a couple suitable items for Elena as well.\u201cMister Fei, thank you for your generosity!\u201dAfter putting on the new items, Elena appeared even more valiant, slender and beautiful. Her red hair fluttered in the breeze. Her hair looked like a crowd of burning flames, contrasting her white, smooth and milky skin. An indescribable temperament exuded from her body; no wonder she was called the most beautiful \u3010Rogue Flower\u3011 in the camp.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026When flowers see her face, flowers would witherWhen the wind hears her voice, the wind would quiet down.When sunshine sees her smile, sunshine would shy away.\u201dThe beautiful poem was what traveling poets used to describe the young nun Andariels. A long time ago in the monastery on the \u3010Tamoe Highland\u3011, there was a beauty that made the whole continent proud. Her name was Andariels; numerous men went crazy over her, and numerous women were crazily jealous over her\u2026\u2026.This woman was an orphan and had the name of an angel, attracting the attention of the whole continent. Even the most pious priests would be distracted when they looked at her.Later though, for some unknown reason, the most beautiful woman on the continent had inconceivably fallen in love with the legendary demon \u2013 Lord of Destruction Diablo, and accepted the demon\u2019s power and turned into the scariest female monster on the continent. She took over the monastery and murdered all the nuns and priests. She turned the monastery on the \u3010Tamoe Highland\u3011 into a living hell. At the same time, it blocked the only path from the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 to the city to the east \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 and turned \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 into a deserted land.On the way to the Monastery, Fei learnt about this distraught history from Elena.\u201cA nun fell in love with a demon?\u201d Love is so powerful\u2026\u2026Elena, the finally battle is about to begin. After we kick open this door, we will be facing the scariest monster on the rogue continent. Remember, no matter what happens, stay at least 30 yard (m) away from her, do you understand?\u201d Fei stood in the fourth underground level in the catacomb under the Monastery and warned the hot mercenary seriously.In the last hour, both of them wiped out the monsters in the monastery and found Andariel\u2019s base. Behind the wooden gate in front of them, the super Boss Anderials in the \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 was waiting for them. There would be an ugly battle waiting for them, no question about it.Elena was nervous, but she still nodded decisively.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He took a deep breath of the air that was filled with the smell of thick blood and adjusted himself into his optimal state. After his physical and mental strength both reached their peak, Fei kicked his right foot and blew open the thick wooden door\u2026..In the mess of shattered wood chips, the bloody evil nest of the final boss \u2013 Andariel had finally lifted its mysterious veil to Fei.In the endless howls, numerous \u3010Dark Ones\u3011, \u3010Rat Men\u3011, \u3010Ghouls\u3011 and other monsters flooded them.At the same time, a huge and unimaginable pressure pressed onto them as if it was tangible. Under the terrifying pressure, even the air had thickened. Fei and Elena\u2019s movements were slowed down as if they were in a pool of water. The power of evil was way beyond their imagination.\u201cDie! Damn intruders!\u201dA huge roar shook the whole chamber; countless stone statues shattered, the ground cracked and fire started burning on the floor as if it was the call from the deepest part of hell.Next, a four or five yard (m) tall demon figure appeared in front of them.It was a partially demonic female giant. She had a stunningly beautiful face; anything pretty would be overshadowed in front of this face. Her face was definitely favoured by the Creation God\u2026\u2026 However, aside from this face which had the beauty Andariel\u2019s elegance, everything else on her body was completely demonized. To become stronger, Andariel had taken in the power from hell. Her beautiful hands had become hideous demons claws, and four huge, snakehead-like limbs extended from her back as if she was Dr. Octopus in Spiderman. An unspeakable horror diffused from her body; the unimaginable pressure was being emitted from her.\u201cRoar \u2013 !\u201dFei suddenly shouted and Barbarian Warcry \u2013 \u3010Howl\u3011 was initiated.A magical force spread out and scared away all the low leveled demons and monsters who were following Andariel. Unfortunately, the skill wasn\u2019t effective at all on super boss Andariel. She didn\u2019t felt any fear, and instead lowered her head and roared. Six stinky green frightening clouds emerged from her body.\u201cElena, stand far away. Don\u2019t touch them; they are deadly poisons.\u201dFei shouted loudly. He took out a bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 and bit onto it with his teeth. Then, he charged into the green clouds and approached Andariel instantly. The huge axe in his hands turned into flashes of white light and struck at Andariel.\u201cAoAoAo \u2013 !!\u201dThe female demon felt pain; she roared as she counterattacked crazily.Fei was already poisoned by the deadly toxin, and very hair on his body had turned green. The Barbarian axe was covered with a thick green juice. Fei was hammered a couple times by the female demon\u2019s counterattacks; he spurted a lot of blood from his mouth, and his health bar was dropping rapidly like a leaking air balloon.He had to turn around and dodge the attacks. He ran away quickly and gained some distance from Andariel, then opened another bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011 and chugged it down.Andariel chased Fei closely. Cloud after cloud of deadly poison mists flew towards Fei and embedded him in it.At this moment \u2013\u201cBeng! Beng! Beng! Beng!\u201dThe bowstring that could shatter souls shook the air; \u3010Boreal Razor Bow\u3011\u2019s golden bowstring left a series of phantom images. A series of frosty blue sharp arrows were shot into Andariel\u2019s body instantly like rain drops in a storm and plundered the female demon\u2019s life.\u201cValkyrie\u201d Elena immediately pulled the bowstring and magic power surged madly in her body. She stared at Andariel coldly and attacked after she saw that Fei was in danger.The level of this aggressive attack had attracted the female demon Andariel\u2019s attention.She roared in anger as she turned around and walked towards Elena.\u201cMaintain the distance\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t let her get closer than 30 yards (m)!\u201d Fei shouted as he drank another bottle of \u3010Normal Healing Potion\u3011. He turned around and chased Andariel as he struck her back with his axe continuously. The female boss\u2019 aggro was finally returned onto him.Using this method, Fei and Elena tried to alternate between being Andariel\u2019s target; they were both in an extremely dangerous situation.But on the other hand, Andariel\u2019s health bar was dropping little by little\u2026\u2026Finally, after about half an hour, what Fei was waiting for had occurred \u2013 Alongside a loud, painful and unwilling scream, the scariest female demon had fallen into a pool of her own blood. Fei glimpsed a tear rolling off of Andariel\u2019s elegant and beautiful face at the same moment the demonic woman fell down. A sense of relief and fascination filled her pretty eyes, which could make any god go crazy over, as if she was saying farewell to her loved one from far away\u2026\u2026That expression quickly left her face; Fei even thought that he had seen a hallucination.Then, Andariel\u2019s body started burning. Flames covered her angelic face and hideous demonic body; soon, the body was turned into ashes. Her lower level monster and demon followers wailed and fell to the ground as they were also burned in the crazy fire.Soon, not a single monster or demons was left in the whole fifth underground level.Fei was still thinking about the astonishing scene, but a white beam of light fell from the sky and surrounded him\u2026\u2026\u201cHaha, I leveled up again!!\u201dFei was excited. He opened up his character status panel; his Barbarian character was already level 16 after these aggressive battles \u2013 he had leveled up 4 times in the last 4 hours, which wasn\u2019t bad.After finishing distributing all the attribute and skill points, Fei\u2019s attention was quickly attracted by the golden lights on the ground. Andariel had dropped four gold rare items continuously. Fei was stoked as he walked up and picked them up. There was a mighty sphinx shield, a pair of exquisite heavy chain boots, a simple traditional steel helmet that had ancient engravings and a three layered yellow leather belt.\u201cEh? Ahahahahah, no wonder I didn\u2019t get anything good from \u3010Countess\u3011 and \u3010The Smith\u3011, it seems like all the items were accumulated at the final boss Andariel\u2026\u2026I\u2019m the luckiest! All four items are what my barbarian needs the most. Hahahaha!\u201dFei was so happy that his teeth almost fell off.Although all four items weren\u2019t identified, Fei could tell that they were quality stuff by just looking at them. After Fei stood there and laughed for a while, he went around and packed all the blue magic items and gold coins that the monsters and demons dropped.After cleaning up the battlefield, Fei used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011 and returned to \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 with Elena.Fei wasn\u2019t sure if it was an illusion, but as soon as he stepped back to the camp, he felt something was not the same.Sure enough, waves of cheers sounded by his ears.\u201cAndariel is dead\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m not dreaming, am I?\u2026\u2026That damn demon is really dead!!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that brave Barbarian warrior, he\u2019s really killed Andariel\u2026\u2026This is unbelievable!\u201d\u201cLight has finally been restored to the Rogue Continent\u2026\u2026We\u2019re saved!\u201d\u201cGod bless. Andariel is dead, and the road to the east has been re-opened! We can go toLut Gholein now\u2026\u2026\u201dFei was stunned. He turned around and found out that the hot mercenary was tearing in joy. Elena stared at Fei with admiration and worship, and shook as she said, \u201cMister Fei, you\u2019ve executed the nightmare of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011- Andariel. You shall become the Legendary Warrior of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011. According to the Blood Oath of Covenant from the ancestors of the camp 60 years ago, you shall become the supreme leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and lead everyone in the camp. Also, you can acquire three legendary miraculous skills from the Great God!\u201dAs Elena spoke, more and more people crowded together; the greedy priestess Akara, military leader Kashya, blacksmith Charsi, \u201cobscene\u201d old man Cain, gambler Gheed, and many more young and pretty female rogues\u2026\u2026 Everyone walked to Fei\u2019s side and sung an ancient, mysterious song as they knelt down onto the ground excitedly and solemnly.Fei\u2019s mouth was wide open.\u201cThis is weird. I don\u2019t recall any scene in the game about this.\u201d He was very surprised. He was about to ask about the \u201cBlood Oath of Covenant from the camp\u2019s ancestors\u201d and the \u201clegendary skills from the God\u201d, as they gave Fei a huge shock, but at this moment \u2013\u201cMaximum gaming time is about to be reached\u2026\u2026Entering ten second count down\u2026\u2026\u201dThe uninvited cold and mysterious voice suddenly appeared in Fei\u2019s head again.Fei was surprised, but he knew that there wasn\u2019t time for him to ask any questions. He quickly converted a couple items that he wanted into the real world. Unfortunately, \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011 was still not able to be converted due to the level restriction; except for that, Fei had successfully converted a couple bottles of \u3010Stamina Potions\u3011, \u3010Normal Healing Potions\u3011 and \u3010Mana Potions\u3011\u2026\u2026The zero gravity sensation came again and Fei blacked out.Everything disappeared.\u2026\u2026When he opened his eyes again, he was already back in the real world.The sun was on the west side of the sky, and lunch time had already passed by. Fei had no idea there Angela and Emma went. Fei asked a maid to bring him some random food to fill his stomach, then went to Chambord\u2019s Iron Prison-Water Dungeon with his personal guard Fernando-Torres under Brook\u2019s lead. He was ready to execute his orders from earlier this morning and revamp the whole prison.The Iron Prison-Water Dungeon was where the past kings of Chambord imprisoned and interrogated prisoners. The place was heavily guarded and was located in a remote area. The three of them walked along the wide stone road that led to the mountains at the back of Chambord. They finally arrived after about twenty minutes.Two thirty yard (m) tall stone warrior statues were standing in front of the gate of the prison. It gave off an oppressive feeling, and the statues looked prestigious. Behind the statues, there was a mile (1 km) long stairway that was layered in white stones; it followed the gently sloped terrain and rose up the mountain. It led to a medium sized square, which held a black bunker style building at the very middle. This was the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon.This black prison had imprisoned numerous offenders, and many nobles, royalty, heroes, and military officers had died in this place. Numerous civilians and criminals that turned into white bones were here as well. It could be said that this was the scariest place in Chambord. In many tales, when someone was imprisoned in the Iron Prison-Water Dungeon, almost they would almost certainly never walk out alive. Even if it was a hot summer day, no one wanted to approach this bloody, gloomy and bone-chilling \u201cTomb of Lives\u201d. What surprised Fei and Brook was that when they arrived at the square, it was filled and crowded with people\u2026\u2026If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He found out that most people here were pale and thin, and they wore ragged clothing. They were the poorest citizens in Chambord. All of them gathered here for some reason; when they saw Fei arrive, they cheered and kneeled to the ground.\u201cLook, his majesty really came\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, please restore justice for us all!\u201d\u201cWe want to sue the prison officials. They abused their powers and arrested the innocent\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cKing Alexander, my son was arrested and thrown into the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon just because he accidentally offended former Head Minister\u2019s son Gill. Your Majesty, please do something about it\u2026\u2026\u201dThe citizens kneeled on the ground and cried out loud.Fei turned around and looked at Brook. Brook quickly shook his head and said, \u201cYour Majesty, I didn\u2019t notify these people to gather here; I didn\u2019t even tell them you were coming here this afternoon. Strange\u2026\u2026Should I dismiss them?\u201dFei smiled as he shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s ok. Aren\u2019t I here to revamp the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon? This is perfect; I can get even more information on each prisoner. Send a soldier to set up tables and chairs on the square and tell Warden Oleg to bring out all the documents. I will revamp the prison in front of all the citizens.\u201dBrook nodded and went to execute Fei\u2019s order.Soon, the citizens on the square were separated by the soldiers. A shed was set up on the square and stone tables and chairs were put inside. Piles of documents written on silk and animal skins explaining the trial process and how each case was settled for the last ten years was delivered into the shed. Some documents even had mold on them; they might\u2019ve been left in the same spot for too long. When Fei opened up the black dotted files, a musty smell filled his nose.\u201cGreat and honorable King Alexander, these are the files from the past ten years. I have ordered my subordinates to move all of them here, and not a single file is missing, my king. Since I\u2019ve become the Warden of Chambord, I haven\u2019t dared to slack off at all\u2026\u2026\u201d The flatterer Oleg stood beside Fei pleadingly as he smiled. The delicate white feathered fan in his hands was moving briskly and fanned Fei to keep him cool.Fei lightly nodded.Oleg came out of the shed excitedly as if he was a cock who got encouraged by its owner during a cockfight. He announced, \u201cThe Great King Alexander has arrived at Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon to expose and correct all the crimes that the conspirator Bazzer has committed against Chambord. Give thanks as justice and fairness has arrived at Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon. If any of you have been treated unfairly and have been persecuted by that damn Bazzer, you can safely complain to the Great King Alexander. Our king is wise, just, impartial and kind\u2026\u2026 He will give all the innocent a fair treatment.\u201dOleg used at least twelve adjectives to praise Fei. After his saliva had spurted everywhere, he finally ordered the soldiers to carefully separate the citizens from the shed and created a small entrance; the citizens were allowed to enter the shed and complain one by one.Fei secretly nodded.Although Oleg was timid, greedy and scared of death, and was just a huge flatterer, he had his strengths. Compared to the military officials such as Brook, he was more attentive. He had a good handle of situations like this. If these types of people were used properly, they would be great assistants.\u201cHonorable King Alexander, please cleanse my grievances\u2026\u2026\u201dA ragged clothed elderly man came in first and kneeled to the ground. His son was a servant at the former Head Minister\u2019s mansion. His son once broke fatty Gill\u2019s rough dog food bowl by accident and was asked to pay 10 gold coins. Because his family didn\u2019t have that kind of money, his son was locked up in Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon; it had been three months now and the old man didn\u2019t even know if his son was still alive.Quickly, a jailer passed Fei the document about the elder\u2019s son. Fei glanced it over; the record was roughly the same as what the elder had told him. He stroke his pen and put an end to the case. The elderly man\u2019s son was instantly released and Fei took out 10 gold coins from Bazzer\u2019s confiscated property and gave it to the family as compensation. The elderly man\u2019s son had endured some torture, but overall he was healthy. The father and son huddled together and cried, and then they kneeled down to thank Fei for his mercy\u2026\u2026After seeing this scene, all the surrounding citizens became excited.People came into the shed and cried as they complained continuously. Most of them were little and minor incidents, but because they affected Bazzer and the other nobles in the kingdom, the citizens were abused by the higher powers and were locked up, enduring torture in the water dungeon\u2026\u2026In just thirty minutes, Fei had released more than forty people from the Iron Prison. All the innocent people had not only gotten back their freedoms, but they also received a lot of compensation; one gold coin was around the annual income of a poor family. Everyone in the square felt grateful and kneeled down as they cheered \u201cHail the king\u201d\u2026\u2026Fei had enjoyed the thrill of being a judge.But as the revamp continued, people who had just planned on watching couldn\u2019t help but stand up and complain about the injustices that happened to them. Some people were robbed by the nobles and lost everything they had and became homeless, while others had their heirloom treasures cheated from them by big merchants. Some even had their beautiful daughters kidnapped into the noble\u2019s mansions, never to be heard from again\u2026\u2026Suddenly, the citizens on the square were stimulated and outraged, and the situation was getting a little bit out of Fei\u2019s control.As soon as Fei realized that more and more people were coming to the square after they heard the news, he sweated as he paused the public \u201crevamp\u201d event. He ordered a secretary to record all the complaints and give them to the new Head Minister Bast. Fei believed that his future father-in-law could handle the cases properly.Fei on the other hand went through all the documents. Most of the cases weren\u2019t difficult to resolve. After two hours, 60 \u2013 70% of the prisoners were released. Honestly, in a remote kingdom such as Chambord, most of the people were kind and friendly; there wouldn\u2019t be any huge or shocking crimes. Most of the cases were created by nobles and wealthy merchants oppressing the poor civilians, while some were disputes between neighbours. To Fei who was educated person from Earth, as long as he followed the principles of equality, all the issues would be resolved quickly.After finished processing all the documents, all the civilians kneeled down excitedly and cheered. In the cheers of \u201cHail the King\u201d and \u201cLong live King Alexander\u201d, Fei, Brook and Oleg entered the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon.After entering the stone bunker, Fei realized that the name of the prison, Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon was an accurate description. The building on the square was only the place where the prison official lived; the real prison was underground. Someone had drilled a corridor deep into the rocky mountain.The corridor was about three yards (m) high and two yards (m) wide and headed deep into the ground. Numerous stone stairways were layered in the corridor.The lights quickly darkened. After about three or four hundred yards (m) deep underground, the corridor finally became flatter; instead of going deep down, it extended further horizontally. On both sides of the corridor, there were many uneven sized artificial stone racks on the wall that held up charcoal torches. The flames flickered and illuminated the entire corridor, but the darkness further away at the end of the corridor created a daunting atmosphere.Fei became more surprised as he walked deeper into the prison.He was shocked when he found out that the inside of the mountain at the back of Chambord was completely emptied out. The entire prison didn\u2019t have a single brick or tile; it was dug from the inside of the mountain as a whole and was like an underground maze. After more than 2/3 of a mile (1km) of walking and passing through more than two dozens iron gates, Fei heard the gurgling sound of water as the passage opened up. Many stone rooms were dug out on both sides of the corridor and sealed by steel fences. These stone rooms were layered with wet hay and contained some basic stone beds and chairs; these rooms were where the prisoners lived.Due to the massive release of innocent citizens and revamp of the prison by Fei earlier, most of the stone rooms were now empty. Only a few stone rooms were still locking up prisoners who had actually committed thefts, assaults and other crimes. After seeing the appearance of the power figures at Chambord, some prisoners didn\u2019t have any response, some rushed to the steel fence and shouted their innocence and others just laughed at Fei disdainfully\u2026\u2026The further Fei walked, the wider the corridor got; it turned into a large hall.The gurgling sound of water became clearer and clearer.Finally, after proceeding 500 yards (m) further, an underground river appeared on one side of the corridor. Cold, bone chilling river water flowed from it. Some stone rooms were dug under the surface of the water, causing the icy water to flood the floor in these rooms; the only way to avoid the chilling water was to stay on the stone beds. This was the so-called \u201cwater dungeon\u201d.The scale of the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon was far beyond his imagination. To dig such a magnificent maze in the mountain, even by using tools and the architectural methods of the 21th century, would take a number of years and a huge sum of money, resources and labour\u2026\u2026It was too shocking. It was hard to imagine who had actually dug out such a vast cave?As if he saw Fei\u2019s confusion, Oleg followed Fei humbly and explained, \u201cYour Majesty, this prison wasn\u2019t built by Chambordians\u2026\u2026 According to Royal Literature, one hundred years ago, a citizen was hunting on the back mountain and discovered this underground cave accidentally. After the King knew about it, he ordered a blockade on this place. After generations of Chambord Kings\u2019 exploration and gradual improvements and transformations, this place became the unbreakable prison. For the past sixty years, not a single prisoner was able to escape from here. It was said that your father, the old King Alexander had imprisoned a powerful and terrifying warrior, but until death, that warrior wasn\u2019t able to break from here\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dAfter hearing Warden Oleg\u2019s explanation, Fei instantly understood.This record was the only way that this could make sense. This huge underground cave could never have been the work of Chambordians. Even if Chambord was still the slightly powerful level four affiliated kingdom, the operation of digging out such a magnificent cave into the mountain would take more than one hundred years.\u201cThen do you know who created this underground cave?\u201d Fei asked.\u201cNo one knows who created this place. There are no clues or traces left in this place. Except for these simple stone rooms and this corridor, there aren\u2019t any statues or murals. When the royals entered here for the first time, there weren\u2019t any writings, material or supplies. It looked as if this place was dug out by someone and was abandoned for some mysterious reason. Some people even suspect that this is the work of the God.\u201d\u201cWork of the God?\u201d\u201cYes, except for a supreme almighty God, humans have a hard time digging through the hard rocks and creating such a giant cave inside a mountain\u2026..of course, some others say that this stone cave might have been the masterpiece of a cave dwarf, but the dwarfs have disappeared for more than four or five hundred years\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Oleg was speaking, Fei\u2019s vision lightened. His field of vision suddenly opened. A hall a few hundred yards (m) high appeared right in front of Fei. Numerous torches were located on the walls and ceilings. They looked like the bright stars in the dark night, shiny and beautiful.Layers and layers of stairs were dug into the wall as they led to another area. The hundreds of yards (m) high stone walls had been divided into ten floors, with numerous stone rooms on each floor. It made Fei feel like he had travelled in space again and was suddenly in a tall skyscraper on Earth.It was extremely shocking; no words could describe the shock Fei was experiencing.\u201cYour Majesty, this is where important offenders are kept. The black cloaked mage and the silver masked man\u2019s body are all locked up in here. The former first commander of the King\u2019s Guard Peter-Cech who was accused of treason is also being kept here.\u201dOleg explained to Fei carefully.Fei nodded and said, \u201cEh, good. Oleg, send someone with Mr. Brook to bring back Cech. I want to meet him.\u201dOleg quickly called over two jailers and ordered them to take Brook up the stone stairs. They quickly disappeared into the corridor in the stone wall. Cech was a felon, so he was locked up on the seventh floor; it would take some time to bring him down.In the meantime, Fei took a detailed look of this super massive hall. The more he looked, the more he was shocked. Despite being from the 21 century on Earth, he also believed that the building of this hall was God\u2019s work. It was simply amazing; tens of Mogao Grottoes couldn\u2019t compare to the size of this cave.Suddenly, Fei\u2019s eyes landed on a twenty yard (m) tall huge black steel door that was on the stone wall further away.\u201cWhat is that door doing there?\u201d Fei asked.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: Underground Cave Maze\u201cDoor?\u201dOleg turned around as he traced Fei\u2019s vision and looked in the direction he was staring. He instantly understood what Fei was thinking and responded right away, \u201cYour Majesty, Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon isn\u2019t the entire underground cave maze. There\u2019s an endless passageway behind the door, but no one knows where it leads to. Some people had entered the passageway to explore, but none of them made it back alive. The passageway is extremely dangerous. Some say that there\u2019s a massive maze behind the door, while others say that a terrifying man-eating hell beast hides behind it. Anyways, for a period of time before the door was built, horrible roars and howling noises would be heard everyday, and a great suction force would suddenly occur and pull people into the corridor\u2026\u2026To prevent more deaths, the king before your father ordered craftsmen in the kingdom to build an iron gate to seal the corridor behind it and prohibited entry for everyone in the Kingdom.\u201dAs Oleg spoke, he looked at the black iron gate and seemed uneasy.Fei nodded in a calm and collected manner, but on the inside he couldn\u2019t be more shocked. According to Oleg\u2019s statement, this huge Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon was only a part of the underground cave, and maybe only just a tiny part of it.This was way too crazy. \u201cWho actually built this underground cave?\u201d Fei couldn\u2019t help but link this huge unimaginable cave maze with the grand-scale constructions of Chambord Castle. Suddenly, a thought popped up in his head, \u201cCould the ones who built Chambord Castle have created this underground cave as well?\u201dFei vaguely felt that Chambord Castle was the same as this underground cave. It only revealed a small portion of itself, as if it was an unknown mysterious treasure that was covered by the dust of time. The secrets of this area hadn\u2019t been discovered by anyone yet and were just waiting for itself to be uncovered.At that moment, Fei\u2019s curiosity had reached its peak.He decided that he had to squeeze out some time later on to go through the black iron gate to the mysterious corridor and figure out what secrets were really hiding in this underground cave maze.As they talked, Oleg led Fei to a wide open stone room on the first level in the huge underground hall. The room was fully furnished. All the torches in the room added some warmness into the chilly and moist air. Fei walked in and sat on a black fur layered soft stone chair behind a black wooden table as he was thinking about the things he previously neglected.Suddenly, \u201cBam! Bam!\u201d It was the sound of the iron fences hitting each other, and it was mixed with \u201ctinkling\u201d noises of the iron chains dragging on the ground. Brook had returned with someone behind him.\u201cYour Majesty, I have brought Peter-Cech.\u201d Brook saluted as he announced.Fei took a detailed look at the former First Commander of King\u2019s Guards who was seriously admired by Brook. The man was about 6 foot 4 (190cm), his clothes were all tattered and he was barefooted. It might\u2019ve been that he was locked up for too long, but his hair was all messy and had hay in it, like an old and used mop. He had a thin body; both his hands and ankles were locked up in iron chains that were as thick as his wrist, and the areas of his body that were in contact with the chains was filled with calluses. He looked terrible, worse than a beggar.However, the eyes that were hiding behind the long, messy hair of this impoverished looking man shocked Fei \u2013 his eyes were surprisingly bright, and his brown pupils exuded a strange light. It made Fei feel like the man was a dragon sleeping in a mountain or a tiger resting on a plain. He had an unspeakable calmness and confidence in his eyes. No one could relate this pair of eyes to a prisoner.\u201cPeter-Cech greets Your Majesty!\u201dAfter entering the stone room, Cech glanced around and observed everyone; his eyes landed on Fei last. He didn\u2019t say anything more and kneeled down directly to show respect and salute Fei. The chains on his body started tickling due to his movement.\u201cPlease get up! Oleg, quickly remove the chains on Commander Cech and get another chair.\u201dFei got up, walked up to Cech and helped him get up as he said that. Oleg immediately knew that this former first commander of the King\u2019s Guards would come back to power and no one could stop it. Although Cech was charged with the most terrible crime \u2013 treason, he could be pardoned at Alexander\u2019s will. The Warden was great at analyzing the situation; he humbly moved a soft fur covered stone chair for Cech and then grabbed the keys from a jailor and released Cech from the chains.Fei grabbed onto the big black wooden table and single-handedly moved it in front of Cech. The strength of a level 16 Barbarian was completely showcased. He pointed at the delicious and delicate food that Oleg prepared on the table and laughed, \u201cPeter, eat first. We will talk after you get full.\u201dCech had a surprised expression on his face as he looked at Fei. After a moment of silence, he grabbed onto a roasted pig leg and started devouring it; he chugged down a cup of wine and ate ravenously as if the food in front of him was the best in the world. Soon, the food that was enough to feed four or five men was cleanly swept up by him. He chugged down the last bit of wine in the silver pot container, got up as he burped and then turned around as he kneeled down in front of Fei again. He lowered his head and loudly swore an oath, \u201cMy king, Peter-Cech swears allegiance to you. I shall give you everything I got, even my life!\u201dFei was a little surprised. He didn\u2019t expect that after the big meal, Cech would instantly declare his loyalty. He didn\u2019t even have the chance to say the bossy lines he had prepared\u2026\u2026He thought to himself proudly, \u201cDid I already develop a domineering appearance that can subdue people subconsciously?\u201dBut Fei didn\u2019t know was that the legendary stories of King Alexander returning to normal, his domination of the battlefield and execution of the powerful enemies, as well as killing the Zenit Imperial Cavaliers at the Celebration Party for the pride and honour of Chambord Kingdom had already spread across Chambord. Even the jailors talked about it for a long time during their free time. What had happened in Chambord had already gotten to Cech. Moreover, Brook had told him millions of times on the way here. The former commander of the King\u2019s Guards was a clever person. He knew his turning point was here; the \u201creborn\u201d King would definitely value his loyalty, so he swore it right away.\u201cGreat, Awesome! Peter, you\u2019ve been wronged all this time\u2026\u2026 Brook, pass on my command. Notify the whole Kingdom; after the King\u2019s investigation, the crime of treason doesn\u2019t stand for the former commander of the King\u2019s Guards Peter-Cech. This incident was conspired by the former Head Minister Bazzer. From today on, his injustice is cleared and he shall be reinstated as the First Commander of the King\u2019s Guard!\u201dBrook was elated. He didn\u2019t expect things to go this smoothly. He kneeled down with Cech to show his gratitude.To his side, Oleg was congratulating Cech warmly. From a prisoner on death row to the high ranked First Commander of the King\u2019s Guards, Cech had ascended in power unimaginably and returned to the centre of power in the Kingdom. Although Oleg the flatterer wasn\u2019t a good person, he was great at observing and analyzing situations. He clearly sensed the high regard that the King had towards Cech, so he classified Cech as the type of person he had to have a good relationship with.After Cech showed his gratitude to Fei, then got up, turned around and surprisingly thanked Oleg, \u201cThank you for taking care of me these days, or I would\u2019ve being tortured to death in this dark and cruel Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon. I will never forget your saving grace and shall repay you heavily for this.\u201dThis sudden scene shocked Fei and Brook as they stared at each other in unison.The new military Guru Brook was deeply aware of Cech\u2019s personality. He was very dismissive of soft and greedy \u201cthugs\u201d such as Oleg; he could\u2019ve never imagined that Cech would lower his head and thank the latter. He was deeply surprised. Fei on the other side was also astonished; he looked at Oleg up and down several times, as if he had discovered a new continent.After Cech thanked Oleg, he saw the surprise on Fei\u2019s and Brook\u2019s faces and explained what happened. After he was framed and locked up, Bazzer was afraid of potential hidden problems and wanted to get rid of this stumbling block who in the way of his evil plan. He wanted Cech killed before the formal execution date. It was simply too easy to kill a prisoner in this dark and gloomy prison. However, Oleg who normally listened to Bazzer had the urge to be merciful to Cech, so he didn\u2019t follow Bazzer\u2019s order to torture Cech to death in secret. That was how the former First Commander of the King\u2019s Guards could live until the day that justice shined through. Otherwise, Cech would\u2019ve been a corpse by now.This was something that no one thought about.What made Fei and Brook more surprised was that Oleg was rarely thanked by \u201cpositive figures\u201d such as Cech, which caused the flatterer to become a little shy. He rubbed his shiny bald head and laughed humbly.Fei found that interesting and laughed with Oleg.Although Cech had luckily escaped from torture, his body was still weak due to living in such poor conditions for a long time. If he wasn\u2019t a two star warrior, he would be really ill by now. Therefore, Fei ordered Brook to take Cech out of the prison and get some sunshine and fresh air to recover.Fei stayed at the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon for a while longer.\u201cOleg, if a prisoner becomes ill and dies or gets executed here, how do we deal with their corpses?\u201d Fei sat on the stone chair and closed his eyes as he pondered. He suddenly thought of something and asked.\u201cAccording to tradition, they should be burned. But in this underground cave, burning corpses will reduce the air quality. Therefore, after a prisoner dies, if their relatives don\u2019t claim the body, their corpse will be thrown into the underground waterway and washed away.\u201d Oleg didn\u2019t know what the King wanted, so he bent his back and answered carefully.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei was a little disappointed. He asked another question, \u201cSo are there any corpses that haven\u2019t been thrown away?\u201dOleg felt this was a little odd, but since he still didn\u2019t know the King\u2019s intentions, he answered carefully again. \u201cYour Majesty, Mr. Brook told me that you were coming to revamp the Iron Prison this afternoon, so\u2026\u2026so I ordered the jailors to get rid of the all the corpses already.\u201d\u201cEh? That\u2019s unfortunate. Are there any serious criminals that will be executed soon?\u201dOleg kind of had an idea of where the King was getting at. He thought deeply and his eyes suddenly shined, \u201cYour Majesty, there are three wandering mercenaries who killed people in the kingdom. Mr. Brook fought and captured them himself. They\u2019re still being imprisoned at the Water-Dungeon and haven\u2019t been executed yet. Except for that, the corpse of the silver masked man that you brought back and ordered to watch out for a couple days ago is still here.\u201dFei was stoked.\u201cAwesome. Order someone to bring over the three mercenaries\u2026\u2026En, and also the corpse of the silver masked man. Prepare a sealed stone room for me\u2026\u2026Oh, one more thing. That black cloaked mage is still alive, right? How is he doing?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, we followed your instructions. Every time the mage showed signs of waking up, a jailor would instantly smash one of his bones and make him faint him again. That guy is still lying on the prison ground unconscious!\u201d Oleg felt a chill to his bones when he remembered Fei\u2019s vicious and sick order.\u201cAhahaha, great. Order someone to bring that mage to the sealed room as well. I have something important to do.\u201dOleg turned around and went to bring the prisoners and prepare the sealed room himself after Fei finished speaking.After more than ten minutes, Oleg returned. He led Fei to a big, wide room on the sixth level in the huge underground hall. A small, concealed room was dug out on the right hand side of the big room. It was about 180 square feet (20 Sq m). The three mercenaries given a death sentence and the corpse of the silver masked knight had already been brought into the room. The poor four star mage was also dragged into the concealed room like a dead dog.\u201cGuard the door with some jailors. Don\u2019t allow anyone to come in\u2026\u2026Remember, it doesn\u2019t matter what happens later on, don\u2019t come in.\u201d Fei nodded in satisfaction and ordered.\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201dOleg left the room with the other dozen jailors in curiosity and guarded the door of the big room carefully. Although the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon was extremely safe, he could tell from the King\u2019s expression that he was about to do something extremely important.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70: Crazy \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011The air in the small concealed room was a little dense, but it wasn\u2019t humid.Fei looked around carefully and found some finger-sized holes on the stone walls; they were most likely used for ventilation. The ventilation system in the underground cave was very impressive. Numerous torches and stoves were burning in this gigantic underground structure and many prisoners were living here, but the air quality wasn\u2019t bad; rather, it was quite fresh. Fei had no idea how the mysterious builder did it.\u201cCrack! Crack!\u201dThe charcoals in the stoves burned and made light popping sounds. The flame in the room was flickering and created a strange atmosphere in the room. The three chained mercenaries were definitely criminals. Although they had been tortured, their spirits were still high and sturdy. After seeing the jailor leave the room and hearing Oleg refer to the luxuriously dressed young man in front of him as \u201cYour Majesty\u201d, a hideous expression appeared on their faces and they approached Fei slowly while dragging their iron chains on the ground\u2026\u2026\u201cJust in time to take this little king hostage and escape from this damn prison\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a godsend! Hahaha, quickly go and block the entrance, don\u2019t let him run away\u2026\u2026\u201dThe three mercenaries winked at each other mutually and surrounded Fei; they grinned nastily as they got closer and closer. They looked at Fei as if they were looking at a corpse. The expressions on their faces told Fei everything.\u201cHumph! Your guys sure are overconfident! Die!\u201dFei sneered as he raised his arm and grabbed one of them; the bald man who was the strongest among the three of them had no way of resisting; it was as if Fei was easily grabbing onto a toddler. He smacked the mercenary on the head with the other palm. \u201cCrack!\u201d In a crisp and chilling sound, the mercenary\u2019s head was smashed into his chest cavity under the strength of the level 16 Barbarian and the man turned into a headless corpse.The other two\u2019s faces paled as they saw the terrifying scene. Their souls were almost scared out of their bodies. They shivered as their hideous expressions disappeared. As if they had epilepsy, they couldn\u2019t even speak properly. The three mercenaries were heinous criminals and deserved to die. Half a month ago, for the sake of robbing one silver coin, the three of them cruelly murdered a poor family. They dismembered the poor couples\u2019 dead body and raped and killed the 13-year-old daughter. They committed crimes that would anger the Gods. The tragedy was discovered by Brook, and he chased them with the King\u2019s Guards more than 10 miles (15 km) and captured them alive. Fei had already went through the documents and records of the three mercenaries, so killing them wouldn\u2019t give Fei any psychological burden or feelings of guilt.Fei didn\u2019t care about the two mercenaries who were about to shit their pants. He squatted down and pressed his right hand onto the chest of the bald man\u2019s corpse. He suddenly roared lightly and a stream of magical force instantly rushed out of his palm and drilled into the dead body. Following a muffled \u201cbang\u201d sound, the corpse\u2019s chest exploded. A huge bloody hole appeared on the chest and all the internal organs turned into a pool of thick blood.It was the Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Find Potion\u3011.Fei was disappointed by the result; not a single potion was found. Under the limitation of the level 1\u3010Find Potion\u3011, finding of a potion wasn\u2019t guaranteed. There was the problem of probability.Just like that, he had wasted a corpse.Fei raised his arm and grabbed again. The big bearded mercenary couldn\u2019t escape his fate and was grabbed by Fei. Regardless of the mercenary\u2019s desperate screams and struggles, Fei smacked him dead and pressed his right palm onto this corpse\u2019s chest as well. He lightly roared and the magical force surged; \u3010Find Potion\u3011 was initiated again.\u201cBang!\u201dThere was still only a slight explosion, and blood spilled everywhere.All of the internal organs turned into sticky blood again, but Fei was disappointed again; no potion was found.Fei frowned, and then he thought, \u201cCould there be any differences between corpses in the Diablo World and the real world? Is that the reason why there weren\u2019t any potion found? But on the battle on the stone bridge, \u3010Corpse Explosion\u3011 in Necromancer Mode was perfectly executed. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems\u2026\u2026\u201dFei turned around and looked at the final thin and tall mercenary. The last mercenary saw Fei\u2019s stares, and he screamed, \u201cDevil!\u201d. Then, his eyes rolled and he fell unconscious.Fei thought about it and realized that this mercenary might be useful later on, so he didn\u2019t bother with the last mercenary.He turned around and walked up to the silver masked knight\u2019s corpse and took off his mask. A young face was under that mask; his brown hair still had an aroma in it. He had a curved nose, oval-shaped face, and smooth white skin. Anyone could tell that the knight was brought up in a wealthy and noble environment. The knight was very handsome while he was alive, but after his death, there were no difference between him and the other mercenaries.The knight was wearing a set of delicate and luxurious armour. Although the knight was dead, there was a hint of magic power still circulating on the surface of the armour; a stream of visible blue energy stuck onto it. This was definitely a set of advanced magic armour. The reason why Fei killed the knight by piercing through his throat was to avoid damaging this set of armour. Naturally, he had a use for it.Fei wasn\u2019t polite. He removed all the armour and items off of the knight carefully and only left some normal clothes on the corpse. He pressed his right hand on to the chest, concentrated his powers and slightly roared. \u3010Find Potion\u3011 was activated again and the light magical force drilled into the corpse\u2026\u2026\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cPlump!\u201dFei heard two sounds, one after another. The chest exploded and a huge bloody hole appeared. After a quick flash of green light, a test-tube like small bottle appeared out of thin air and floated up and away from all the splattering blood. After levitating about a foot high (30 cm), it stopped moving and floated in mid-air. The bottle was extremely smooth and the green liquid inside had a stunning shine.\u201cSuccess!\u201dFei was stoked; he reached out and grabbed the green bottle.A light warmth spread onto Fei\u2019s palm from the glass bottle. It was soft and comfortable, just like a living thing. Fei could even vaguely feel a hint of intimacy. This green liquid was exuding a weak spiritual energy, as if it was a newborn lingering onto its mother.\u201cHuh? This is strange. It isn\u2019t a red \u3010Healing Potion\u3011, nor a blue \u3010Mana Potion\u3011 or white\u3010Stamina Potion\u3011 or pink \u3010Rejuvenation Potion\u3011 or even a yellow \u3010Exploding Potion\u3011. What potion did I find?\u201dFei quickly found out the difference between the potions that he had seen in the Diablo World and this green potion. He hesitated. He didn\u2019t know what this potion was called, so he had no way of confirming the effect of this potion. If this was a deadly \u3010Poison Potion\u3011, then wouldn\u2019t it be suicide if he drank it?He thought about it for a little while and saw the tall and thin mercenary who had fainted. His eyes shined and he suddenly had an idea. He walked up to the mercenary and kicked him up. Without any explanation, he squeezed open the mercenary\u2019s mouth and dripped a couple drops of the portion into it. The mercenary did everything he could to resist it, but his strength couldn\u2019t even match a tenth of the level 16 barbarian\u2019s monstrous strength. The potion easily slid down his throat and the mercenary started screaming in horror as he clutched onto his neck.Fei stared at the mercenary closely.The last mercenary was his \u201clab rat\u201d.One second\u2026\u2026Two seconds\u2026\u2026Five seconds\u2026\u2026The mercenary dug his fingers into his throat as he laid on the ground and tried to vomit and get the couple drops of \u201cEvil Poisonous Potion\u201d out of his body. But he was disappointed. After the potion entered his throat, it disappeared as if it had already been dissolved into his blood; even if he puked out his stomach, the potion wouldn\u2019t come out of his body.Fei stared at the mercenary and tried to find out the effect of the potion.After a minute, aside from the struggling and retching, it seemed like there weren\u2019t any other symptoms. The potion couldn\u2019t heal or recover stamina\u2026.. \u201cDid I miss something? Or does this green potion simply have no special effects?\u201dFei was disappointed.But at this moment, an something unexpected occurred \u2013Following the terrifying and painful screams of the tall and thin mercenary, a green light suddenly appeared on his face, and then it slowly expanded. It moved from his face to his neck, chest, arms and legs\u2026\u2026 It ended with the light expanding to the mercenary\u2019s entire body, which shivered crazily. Under his exposed skin, it seemed like there were living things continuously drilling through his body. There were numerous bulges on his body, along with exposed veins, his body was hideous and scary.Finally, the mercenary turned green. His screams and roars slowed and quieted down. He stared at his own body in horror; his had a confused expression on his face. After a couple seconds, the green light and the green color on his body started to fade and eventually disappeared, as if nothing had happened.However, Fei was pleasantly surprised.This was because after the green light disappeared, the tall and thin mercenary had become mysteriously strong. He was ripped and the muscles on his body bulged. Anyone could see the explosive strength in his strong muscles. He looked lively now compared to his previous half-dead state.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u201dThe mercenary subconsciously his hands and heard a series of metal clanking noises. Iron chips and fragments flew everywhere; Fei\u2019s pupil contracted because he clearly saw the four thick iron chains on the limbs of the mercenary being easily broken.\u201cThis guy suddenly gained such a monstrous strength!\u201dHis Barbarian\u2019s understanding and familiarity with strength allowed Fei instantly make this judgment. A couple drops of the mysterious green potion had suddenly given this mercenary the strength of a level 5 Barbarian.\u201cHahahahahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter feeling the tsunami-like monstrous strength surging in his body, the mercenary was extremely excited. He swung his fist randomly and left a deep and shocking mark into the hard stone wall; the collision didn\u2019t even leave a single scratch on his fist.\u201cIt looks like this mysterious green potion didn\u2019t only grant him the powerful strength, but it also improved his body\u2019s fitness. Otherwise, if his body were still weak, the repulsion force from leaving a deep mark into the stone wall would have at least broke open his hand.\u201d Fei made another observation.\u201cHahaha, little king, you asked for this yourself. I can feel the unprecedented strength. Hahaha, thank you so much! If you obey my order and take me out of here, I will spare your life!\u201d The enormous increase in strength gave the mercenary a huge boost in confidence. He had a vicious look on his face; he cracked his knuckles as he approached Fei slowly.\u201cProtect the King!\u201dOleg was guarding the gate when heard all the noises in the room and felt something was wrong. He hesitated a little bit, but ended up taking his sword and rushing into the concealed room. He utilized his one star warrior\u2019s strength as he charged and struck at the mercenary while roaring.\u201cTink!\u201dThe mercenary hit Oleg\u2019s sword with a backhand smack. The huge force blew the sword from Oleg\u2019s hand, causing it to fly in the air and get stuck in the stone wall. The huge strength also forced Oleg back a dozen steps; Oleg wasn\u2019t a match for the mercenary\u2026\u2026After getting an advantage in combat, the mercenary\u2019s confidence boosted even higher. He charged at Fei, wanting to seize the head of the kingdom and use Fei as a hostage to bargain his way out of this horrifying prison. He had already decided that after he got out of jail, the first thing he would do was chop that damn commander whose name was Brook into thousands of pieces.However \u2013\u201cHumph, overconfidence!\u201dFei sneered; he didn\u2019t even try. He swung his hand lightly and sent his hand flying at the mercenary\u2019s head before the mercenary could even touch him. \u201cCrack!\u201d Without a doubt, the confident Mercenary followed the footsteps of the first bald mercenary; he was turned into a headless corpse instantly. The body dazzled a little bit and then slammed onto the ground. The strength of a level 5 Barbarian was like a pile of garbage in front of the strength of a level 16 Barbarian.Fei then turned his head and stared at Warden Oleg who was in a big shock.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2026\u2026I heard all the noise and felt something was wrong. I was afraid that you were in danger, so\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201d As Oleg was speaking, he quickly kneeled onto the ground. \u201cMy apologies Your Majesty! My apologies. I shouldn\u2019t have entered without your permission!\u201dFei looked at the Warden who was shivering as if he was in a freezer and calmed down. \u201cWhen Oleg rushed in, he didn\u2019t see anything that he wasn\u2019t supposed to see. Plus, he was concerned about my safety.\u201d After a moment of silence, Fei spoke, \u201cNext time there won\u2019t be any exceptions. For your loyalty\u2019s sake, I won\u2019t hold you accountable for your intrusion this time. Please leave now!\u201d\u201cThank you Your Honour for pardoning me! Thank you!\u201d Oleg quickly got up and exited the room.The flames flickered, and four corpses were lying on the ground with their chests open beside a half dead skeleton-like mage. The atmosphere in the room was creepy as hell. However, Fei couldn\u2019t hide his inner happiness. He pinched onto the green potion with his fingers and held it up close to his face to observe it closer and to feel the devastating energy that was in the potion.\u201cThis green potion\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s call it the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011!\u201dFei murmured to himself. He didn\u2019t expect that the Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Find Potion\u3011 would discover such a crazy potion. After thinking about the magical effect the potion had on the mercenary, Fei couldn\u2019t help but think about the famous fictional character in the superhero movies \u2013 The Hulk.A couple days ago, Fei was worrying about improving the strength of the leadership at Chambord; now, he had the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011, and that question was solved!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: For What Reason?The \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 was only about 50mm and was stored in a test-tube like glass bottle. Fei had given the last mercenary about \u2153 of the potion in his experiment, leaving only \u2154 of this extremely precious potion. Fei had a perfect place to keep them in: the storage units in his Barbarian Belt.He squatted down and pressed his right hand onto the now buff and tall mercenary\u2019s chest and used \u3010Find Potion\u3011. Unfortunately, he got nothing except a puddle of thick blood. There was nothing he could do. Since \u3010Find Potion\u3011 was currently only a level 1 ability, the probability of actually finding potions was very low.All four corpses in the concealed room had been used and the only bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 was an unexpected surprise, but Fei hadn\u2019t obtained the information he needed the most.How did this powerful magic potion appear when it didn\u2019t even exist in the Diablo World? If he had to come up with a reasonable explanation, he thought that it could possibly be an inconceivable mutation of the Barbarian\u2019s \u3010Find Potion\u3011 ability when he brought it into the real world. Then, the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 would very likely be the result of the mutated ability. A mutation of this sort was out of Fei\u2019s control. He hadn\u2019t tested out the chances of obtaining a \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011, nor did he know if there were any other side effects on the potion. Lastly, he wasn\u2019t sure if anyone could just take this potion and gain the monstrous strength that the tall mercenary obtained.Before he could use this potion to increase the strength of his subordinates, Fei had to figure out all the answers to these questions. Even if it was on Earth, huge international pharmaceutical companies would still have to conduct hundreds of clinical trials before putting anything on the market.After he thought through all the key points, Fei sighed lightly.He concentrated his attention onto the black cloaked four star mage lying on the ground like a dead dog. The mage\u2019s \u201climbs\u201d twitched as blood foamed out of his mouth. It was funny how this mage was probably the most unfortunate mage in the history of Azeroth Continent. In terms of power and strength, the mage could easily conquer a remote kingdom like Chambord on his own; however, he had met Fei. He was beaten like a sandbag by the savage despite being surrounded by thousands of allies. Right now, this poor mage was half dead. Under the instructions of Fei, every time the mage showed signs of waking up, the jailors would hit him hard and make sure that he fainted again. Except for a couple of rib bones that were still intact, all the bones in his limbs were broken. If he wasn\u2019t a four star mage and had a strong vitality, he would\u2019ve been dead by now.Fei walked up to the mage with a dirty smile on his face.He grabbed a bottle of \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 from his belt and opened the lid. He dripped a couple drops onto the mage\u2019s broken limbs. Instantly, a magical force surrounded the limbs and they started recovering\u2026\u2026After four or five seconds.Although the mage\u2019s limbs still looked wretched and there were still bone fragments and rotting flesh showing, his limbs at least resembled them now. Fei didn\u2019t want the mage to fully recover. If a four star mage went crazy, the power of a level 16 Barbarian wouldn\u2019t be enough to handle it.During the process, Fei discovered something interesting \u2013The \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 had different effects on different people. The effects were stronger on weaker people, while the effect diminished on more powerful people. Given the same amount of potion, it was enough to almost revive Pierce who was on the verge of dying, but for the four star mage, it was only enough to heal some exterior injuries.\u201cSplash \u2013 !\u201dA bucket of cold water mixed with salt was poured onto the four star mage.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201d The mage finally woke up with a long, hoarse groan. He opened his snake-like eyes and glanced around. His eyes landed on the face that he would never forget in his lifetime. Instantly, he started trembling as if he were a girl who had seen the devil take her virginity. He couldn\u2019t help but scream, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026. you?\u201d\u201cHa, you have a good memory. It\u2019s me, hehehe!\u201d Fei laughed arrogantly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel proud. Seizing and capturing a four star mage despite having less strength than a three star warrior\u2026 this record could go into the Records of Great Achievements by all the Kings of Chambord.\u201cYou\u2019re done! AHAHAHAHA, you\u2019re dead\u2026\u2026Ignorant dumbass, stupid pig, funny dog. You\u2019re still laughing? Do you know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d The skeleton-like mage started screaming in shock after he saw the silver masked knight\u2019s corpse. His body started shaking as if he was getting an electric shock. \u201cThe entire Chambord Kingdom will become hell! You killed Prince Mateja-Kezman of the Eindhoven Empire. The entire Zenit Empire will be crushed into pieces!\u201d\u201cDamn! You want more torture, b*tch? So arrogant, despite being a prisoner.\u201dAfter seeing this mage yelling arrogantly rather than begging for mercy, Fei became mad. He rushed to the mage and stomped on both of the mage\u2019s thighs. \u201cCrack! Crack!\u201d the sound of bones breaking could be heard. The leg bones which recovered under the effect of the \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 were turned into a pile of bone fragments, and the thighs turned into meat paste again. The poor mage puked up more blood foam and fainted again.Fei dripped a couple drops of \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 onto the leg again.After a few seconds, the mage woke up again slowly. After he saw Fei, he started screaming again, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026You damn pig! Dumbass, you, you, you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCrack! Crack!\u201dThe recovered legs were stomped on yet again.Fei squatted down again and patiently dripped some \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 onto his legs.This time, the mage seemed to understand the situation he was in. He was much quieter this time. He sweated and spoke breathing heavily, \u201cYou stupid guy. If you want to live, then start running away right now\u2026\u2026you\u2026\u2026you\u2019ve made a huge mistake.\u201d\u201cIf I were you, I would worry about your own life first. Honorable Mr. Mage, tell me your name and origin\u2026\u2026And, is this bastard\u2019s name Mateja-Kezman?\u201d Fei pointed at the silver masked knight\u2019s body and asked coldly. \u201cYou better tell me everything you know. Otherwise\u2026\u2026 Hum!\u201d A murderous expression appeared on Fei\u2019s face.\u201cMy life?\u201d The mage bit his teeth angrily as he spoke, \u201cI\u2019m injured to this point. Do you think I have a chance to live on? Hehe, but you, young king\u2026\u2026Tremble! You will spend your entire future in fear. You\u2019ll be hunted, and you\u2019ll witness the deaths of your loved ones and see their skulls get turned into wine cups. Their souls will be cursed and their limbs will be cut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPia! Pia! Pia!\u201cFei held up the mage by his collar of the black cloak and slapped him multiple times; a couple bloody teeth flew in the air and landed onto the ground. \u201cYou reckless f*g, how dare you curse at me? My patience is wearing thin. If you speak rubbish one more time, I will turn your skull into a wine cup!\u201d\u201cPooh! You killed Prince Mateja-Kezman of the level 4 Eindhoven Empire. Hahaha, once the Eindhoven Empire knows about this, not just your little Chambord Kingdom, but also your parent Empire Zenit will be crashed into pieces\u2026\u2026\u201d The mage spat a mouthful of blood onto the ground. Under the threat that Fei imposed, he answered Fei\u2019s questions honestly. A malicious looked flashed on his face. As he said the words \u201cEindhoven Empire\u201d, a gloating smile came on his face. He was waiting for the little king to mentally collapse, because a level 4 Empire wasn\u2019t something that a little remote kingdom could defend against.But, he was disappointed.\u201cThis dude is a prince of a level 4 Empire?\u201d After a brief moment of surprise, he laughed as he pointed at the corpse of the silver masked knight. \u201cSo I\u2019ve killed a prince of a level 4 Empire? Hahaha, after hearing you say that, I feel very refreshed. The feeling of killing a prince is really different\u2026\u2026 Hey, does that damn Eindhoven Empire have more princes?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d The mage was shocked. His lips swelled after Fei\u2019s powerful slaps as if two sausages were hanging off of his mouth. He couldn\u2019t speak clearly due to his lost teeth. Plus, he didn\u2019t know what to say. Didn\u2019t the dumb pig in front of him know the consequences of angering a level 4 Empire?After seeing the mage being beaten, Fei spoke slowly, \u201cHehe, after you fainted, your soldiers were cleanly wiped out by the Zenit soldiers. Not a single one escaped. Hehehe, I guess your troops snuck to Chambord. Now that everyone else is dead, you\u2019re the only person who\u2019s alive, and you\u2019re locked up in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon which even moon ranked masters can\u2019t even escape from. How will the Eindhoven Empire know that their prince died here?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d The mage\u2019s eyes instantly opened wide. As if he was struck by a lightning, he blurted, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it easy to find out? From the beginning, I was wondering why my enemies didn\u2019t display any banners and flags. If you guys were bandits, your troops wouldn\u2019t have been so organized and well trained. The black armoured enemies had a ton of star ranked warriors and a lot of sieging machines. Anyone could tell that you were part of an elite formal army\u2026\u2026 Therefore, there was only one explanation \u2013 you guys took off your banners and flags on purpose to hide your origins. You guys didn\u2019t want others to know who you were. That raises another question\u2026 why? It\u2019s because you guys were engaging in a secret military operation and it was very likely that this operation was so secretive that it couldn\u2019t even be known to strangers or your own people\u2026\u2026Hehehe!\u201dFei was actually spouting complete bullsh*t; he was becoming more fluent and his story was making more sense as he continued the BS.But after seeing the mage\u2019s facial expression turn sour, Fei was secretly stoked. He knew that his BS was getting onto something. Maybe something he said was the truth. He smiled nastily as he got closer to the mage. His expression suddenly turned cold and he threatened, \u201cOld thing, hehehe, give up. If you don\u2019t want to be tortured, then tell me why you guys snuck into Chambord Kingdom? For what reason?\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He suddenly sighed, \u201cYoung man, I have to admit that you are very smart to be able to accurately guess the truth from such few clues. However\u2013hehe \u2013it\u2019s useless. Even if the Eindhoven Empire temporarily doesn\u2019t know where the prince has gone, once they realize that something is wrong, nothing can hide from the Eindhoven Empire\u2018s ears. Even if they lose a single horse, the imperial secret spies can investigate and find where it is, not to mention his highness and his three thousand black armoured elite soldiers. When they find out what has happened, Chambord and Zenit Empire will be doomed. Everyone will die!\u201d\u201cDie your mom!\u201d Fei threw the mage two more slaps to his face, making the mage \u201cclimax\u201d; a portion of his teeth flew out of his mouth again. Fei threatened, \u201cOld Douche, tell me honestly why you guys came to Chambord!\u201dThe mage sneered. A look of viciousness and spitefulness flashed in his eyes as he kept his silence.\u201cYo! Trying to act tough in front of me?\u201d Fei was so angry that he started laughing. \u201cAlright old thing, you have some balls. Hold yourself together for this!\u201dFei sneered as he grabbed onto one of the mage\u2019s bones that had just recovered; he applied some of his strength and crushed the bone again. The mage took in a deep cold breath and passed out. Fei took out the \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 and dripped some of it onto the bone. Soon, the old mage woke up and looked at his own leg bone in shock. \u201cMy bone has recovered already? This\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOld douche, look at this\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei lightly shook the half-filled \u3010Healing Potion\u3011 bottle in his hand and smiled as if he was a devil ready to make a dirty exchange. \u201cThe potion in this bottle is enough to revive a life and heal anyone. It doesn\u2019t matter how severe an injury is; a few drips of the potion will heal it. If you still try and act tough and stay silent, hehehe, I\u2019ll crash and shatter your bones, heal it again, break it again, and heal it again\u2026\u2026If you have the patience to play with me, I\u2019ll let you feel the pain of getting every bone in your body crushed thousands of times. That feeling\u2026\u2026 Hehehe, hahahahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dThe mage broke down instantly and cried, \u201cDevil, you devil\u2026\u2026\u201dFei laughed, \u201cIf you tell me the truth, I\u2019ll save your life with this potion. All the broken bones in your limbs and body will be completely recovered. If there\u2019s a chance, we might even be able to cooperate! Hehehe!\u201dThe mage rolled his eyes a couple times and hesitated as he contemplated his situation. His limbs had already been beaten and crushed into meat paste and had no life in them. The only way that he survived until now was by relying on his powerful magic powers. He had no desires and no needs anymore. This was why he was super brave and tough. But as soon as he saw hope for survival, the mage\u2019s resolve finally wavered. Desperation could make heroes, but hope could turn even the best hero into a coward. The red potion in the devil\u2019s hand was the only hope for the black cloaked mage; everyone treasured their own lives, and a huge opportunity had been presented right in front of him. If he could handle it properly, he could soar back to his prior status and power level\u2026\u2026Therefore, he eventually submitted to Fei. He nodded, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you everything I know, but before that, you have to swear that once I tell you everything, you will heal me. If you aren\u2019t a man of your words, you will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI swear to the God of War that as Alexander, the King of Chambord, if I don\u2019t honour my words, then I shall fall into the deepest part of hell and be tortured for eternity!\u201d Fei raised his hand and vowed solemnly.The mage believed Fei.\u201cMy name is Evans and I\u2019m a four star mage. I\u2019m from the faraway \u2013 Level 9 Manchester Empire. I was traveling around the continent in accordance with my tutor Ferdinand\u2019s instructions. Three months ago when I was traveling through the deep forest to the North of Eindhoven Empire, I accidently ran into two mercenary teams fighting to the death over a mysterious black map. In the beginning I was only curious, so I killed off all the hundred or so mercenaries and laid my hands on the map. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to it at first, but then I found out that the materials necessary to make the map were things that I, a four star mage, had never seen before. After some translation and research, I was shocked to find out that I had inadvertently picked up a huge surprise \u2013 The map was an antique passed down from the Battle of Gods and Demons thousands of years ago. Many locations were circled by red marks. Those areas are likely the ruins of the Mythical Wars between the God and Demons. Besides those ruins, many other locations were marked as well, but I don\u2019t know what they represent\u2026\u2026After I found out about this surprise, I wanted to explore the ruins of the Mythical War. I spent about two months researching and studying this map in great detail and finally located one of the many ruins\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo one of these ruins is at Chambord Castle?\u201d Something triggered Fei as he asked calmly.\u201cEn, that\u2019s right. It was at Chambord Castle. More than a month ago, I came to Chambord Castle a couple times and searched for the ruins in the castle carefully. Although I found some rough clues, I never found the real entrance to the ruins. After that, I realized that finding the ruins would likely be a time and energy consuming operation. I couldn\u2019t do it all by myself. Plus, there were so many people living in Chambord. Therefore, after some thought, I had to find a helper\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you went and found that damn Prince of Eindhoven?\u201d\u201cI knew the Prince Mateja-Kezman beforehand. He knew that I was powerful and tried to recruit me under his belt to help him battle for the throne of Eindhoven Empire against his two brothers\u2026\u2026 I found him and told him that I had discovered ruins from the Mythical War thousands of years ago and invited him to explore it together. Once he acquired the ruins, he would be able to easily beat his two brothers and become the next Emperor of the Eindhoven Empire. Mateja-Kezman was stoked and accepted my invitation immediately. To prevent his two brothers from finding out what he was up to, he pretended to travel for leisure and brought his elite soldiers to the edge of Zenit Empire. We immediately changed our appearances and took off all our banners and flags. Then, we snuck through Zenit Empire\u2019s sentries, crossed the valleys and forests and surrounded Chambord in the blink of an eye. The plan was to conquer the castle at light speed and massacre all the citizens and royals. After we gained ownership of the castle, we would create a false impression that nothing had happened and search the castle for the ruins. After all, no one would pay attention to a remote little kingdom such as Chambord. Until Zenit Empire found out about us, we would\u2019ve already acquired and took over the ruins, hehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026 by your gloomy and vicious look, you probably don\u2019t have the kind of heart to help that idiot prince fight for the throne, moreover to share the Mythical Ruins with him. You\u2019re up to no good as well\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei stared at the mage and sneered.\u201cAke, ake\u2026\u2026.\u201d The mage coughed up a mouthful of blood. He said weakly, \u201cOf course, the Mythical Ruins are so precious; why would I share it with him? Once we found the entrance to the ruins and started exploring, I would kill him, take control of the three thousand soldiers and order them to continue exploring the ruins for me. Hehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d The mage started laughing when he spoke of his master plan.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of Eindhoven Empire\u2019s revenge?\u201d\u201cTo avoid other people from finding out what we were doing and prevent unnecessary fights over the ruins, we wiped out all the traces. No one would be able to find out where Prince Mateja-Kezman and his troops had gone\u2026\u2026 Hahaha, Prince Mateja-Kezman dug his own grave. Everything was going according to my plan.\u201d\u201cSo all the stuff you said about the Eindhoven Empire eventually finding out what had happened was just to scare me?\u201d Fei sneered. \u201cWill they never find out that their prince died here?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019s certain. You can\u2019t underestimate Eindhoven Empire\u2019s strength. They will find out eventually. However, even if they do, so what? I\u2019m from the level 9 Manchester Empire, and my mentor Ferdinand is a very important official in the Empire. When they find out about this, I\u2019d already be done exploring the ruins and have reported the ruins to the Manchester Empire. By that time, I would have the appraisal of the Empire and my status would soar. Hehehe, what could a level 4 Empire do to me at that time?\u201d The Mage had a vicious expression on his face as he said that.\u201cYour idea was great, but unfortunately, your luck wasn\u2019t on point. You met me and were beaten like a sandbag. Aren\u2019t you a weak prisoner now, begging for mercy?\u201d Fei was being sarcastic. \u201d I have to thank you. If it wasn\u2019t for your detailed planning, Chambord may have truly be doomed under Eindhoven cavalries\u2019 iron hooves.The Mage was enraged after he heard that. He stared at Fei angrily and wanted to say something sarcastic back, but after a moment of hesitation, he lowered his head and sighed sadly. \u201cWhat could I do? Calculations can\u2019t stand against fate. I would have never thought that such a magnificent character like you could exist in the small Chambord Kingdom. However, we wouldn\u2019t know each other if we didn\u2019t fight. What you said earlier was true. We can cooperate and work together in the future.\u201dFei didn\u2019t comment on the mage\u2019s recommendation.He was shocked on the inside. What the Mage said had proved some of his early hypotheses. Chambord did have a long history behind it, and the huge underground maze-like prison was probably a part of the Mythical Ruins.Fei didn\u2019t shown any emotion on his face; he continuously asked, \u201cTell me about the Mythical Ruins.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of the Mythical Ruins before?\u201d the Mage laughed disdainfully. But after he saw the murderous glare in Fei\u2019s eyes, his ego disappeared like melting ice cream and answered humbly, \u201cAccording to legends, thousands of years ago Gods and Demons ruled the Azeroth Continent. Both races were crazily powerful. They could crush mountains, rip open the skies, shatter the land and do whatever they wanted. But for some reason, both races couldn\u2019t bear each other; one race had to die. Since the beginning of their existence, they had fought and battled against each other. The war lasted more than tens of thousands of years. Gods and Demons battled across the continent and the ruins of war spread across the whole continent. However, the ruins were slowly buried by in dust over time\u2026\u2026 afterwards, the two powerful races of Gods and Demons suddenly disappeared mysteriously from Azeroth Continent. After a long period of time, the human race slowly rose\u2026\u2026 Of course, these are only legends told by traveling poets and storytellers. But, people did find quite a few mysterious ruins on the continent and gained a ton of incredible items from them. Even the training methods of energy and magic powers extremely popular on the continent right now were discovered from the ruins. People had gotten magic items and devices, wealth, energy technique scrolls, magic training scrolls\u2026\u2026 and much, much more from the ruins. \u2018Once you acquire a Mythical Ruin, you will obtain everything.\u2019 That was the golden rule on the continent. Level 9 Barcelona Empire, the number one empire on the Continent, and a few other Empires such as the Milan Empire, Chelsea Empire and Anfield Empire all rose to power and got stronger after they discovered large scale Mythical Ruins. Even our Manchester Empire was no exception; the great imperial creator Master Matt-Busby created the Manchester Empire after he discovered a great Mythical Ruins and acquired of its resources.\u201dAs the mage spoke, a rare and proud expression appeared on his face. The man named Busby must have been super powerful.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 73.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73.1 \u2013 Means of a King (1)After Fei heard everything the mage said, he had some ideas about what was going on.The so called Mythical Ruins was similar to a pirate\u2019s buried treasure. If anyone was lucky enough to find an unexplored Mythical Ruins, they would obtain magic devices, training scrolls, and more from the gods\u2019 and demons\u2019 era. And if those items were utilized properly, even if the so called Eindhoven Empire tried to wage war against Chambord, Chambord wouldn\u2019t be scared.\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve spoken enough. Now give me that map!\u201d Fei reached out his hand and smiled, \u201cSir Elvis, you\u2019re right. It looks like we will have many opportunities to cooperate\u2026\u2026 Eh, but before that, give me the map so I can inspect it. What if the map and what you said were all fake?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026Cough, cough\u2026\u2026Hehehe, young man, do you think I\u2019m an idiot?\u201d The mage coughed up mouthfuls of blood as he spoke with a ridiculing expression on his face. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that as soon as I hand over the map, I\u2019ll be turned into a corpse.\u201dFei didn\u2019t get mad at all. He squatted down and tapped the mage\u2019s shoulder and winked as he said: \u201cHow could I? Sir Elvis, I\u2019ve already swore an oath to the God of War with my honour as a King; how could I trick you? Plus, to explore the Mythical Ruin at Chambord, I will need powerful mages and warriors to help me. You are exactly what I need. Hahaha, we have a common interest and need each other\u2019s help. Why would I kill you now?\u201dAfter hearing Fei\u2019s words, the mage started hesitating.Throughout the ages, there were two things on Azeroth Continent that people weren\u2019t allowed to tarnish; the first one was the Principles of Knights, and the second on was the Honour of a King, especially the kind of oath that Fei did in honour of the King to the God of War. Originally, Elvis would have believed Fei, but for some reason he felt that the king in front of him was kind of sketchy and slimy and not very dependable.Fei\u2019s expression turned cold after he saw Elvis\u2019 hesitation.He \u2018humphed\u2019 as he stood up and suddenly switched to Necromancer Mode. A cloud of cold and dark death energy surrounded him. Fei raised his hand and pointed at a location. \u201cCrash!\u201d Something incredible happened; the mage\u2019s eyes opened wide and his eyeballs almost fell out of his head.In the splashing blood, a vicious skeleton holding a bone shield and bone blade climbed out of a dead mercenary\u2019s corpse. The skeleton made \u201ccracking\u201d sounds every time it moved; it was the sound of bones grinding on each other. With two black holes in its eye sockets and white bones, it looked like the demons from hell.Necromancer \u2013 \u3010Raise Skeleton\u3011.\u201cAh? You\u2026\u2026\u201d The mage started trembling as if he was freezing. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u2026a\u2026\u2026.actually an evil undead mage? I\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201dFei slightly frowned.He surprisingly sensed a familiar energy from the mage. It was also a dark death energy. Although it was weak and pretty well hidden inside the mage\u2019s body, it couldn\u2019t stay undetected in front of Fei who had the power of a level 6 Necromancer.\u201cHaha, this is pretty unexpected. Sir Elvis, you actually know undead magic. I won\u2019t say anything more. If you hand over that map peacefully, we can still cooperate friendly and explore the ruins together\u2026\u2026. otherwise, you know that to a Necromancer like myself, even if you die, your soul can\u2019t escape from my palms. I have many ways to \u201crefine\u201d and torture your soul. You\u2019ll give me the map sooner or later, so why would you want to go through all the pain and trouble?\u201dThe white cloud of death energy spun crazily in Fei\u2019s palm. Fei tried to put on an evil and sinister look as he threatened the mage.Fei honestly felt like he was a super villain in the superhero movies and was torturing a sidekick to get some secret about the superhero. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through all of this\u2026\u2026\u201d. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t the Joker and the mage wasn\u2019t Robin.The mage looked at the ferocious skeleton and hesitated a little. He eventually handed over the map to Fei. Although he was tortured quite a bit, he still had enough magic power to open up his own storage ring. Fei\u2019s incentives and threats made the mage dubious, but he ended up making the hard decision. He raised his hand and a folded map made of a mysterious material appeared in his hand. \u201cYoung man, this is the map. You have to be a man of your words. Without a four star mage, you won\u2019t ever be able to open and explore the Mythical Ruin. You won\u2019t get anything from killing me.\u201dFei grabbed the map and opened it to inspect it.The map wasn\u2019t small; it was a square map about 3 yards (m) on each side. It was made from an unknown yellow material and felt weightless. The map itself had a weak floating force; Fei shook the map, causing it to completely open itself in the air. Mountains, hills, rivers, lakes, forests\u2026\u2026 Numerous terrains were recorded on it. It contained a wide area and many various colored circles and dots marked a lot of areas. The notes on the map were in strange characters. Fei felt like those characters were familiar, but he couldn\u2019t figure out where they were from.Although it was the first time that Fei had seen this map, his intuition told him that Elvis didn\u2019t give him a fake map to trick him.Fei waved his hand; \u201cCrack!\u201d the skeleton warrior shattered into a pile of bone fragments. He also switched from Necromancer Mode back to Barbarian Mode. The thick death energy that surrounded him disappeared as if it never appeared.This change made the mage\u2019s eyes shine in greed.His wasn\u2019t a talented mage; he followed and studied under the moon ranked master Ferdinand for more than twenty years, yet he was only able to reach the power of a four star mage. He was once mocked by everyone in the Manchester Empire. However, due to his greed for power, he wasn\u2019t able to resist studying undead magic which could advance and give him power quickly. As a result, he was shunned and prohibited by the \u201cOverlord\u201d on the Continent \u2013 The Holy Church. Due to the fear of other people finding out about it and sending him into a pit of fire, he hid his undead magic powers in his body carefully and no one had found out about it yet. The main reason that he left Manchester Empire and traveled the Continent was to hide from the higher ups and powerful priests at the Capital of the Empire. Fei\u2019s method of hiding his undead magic power in the body gave him a huge hope. If he could learn the method, he could then train and study undead magic to the limit and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the priests finding out about it.After seeing the bones fragments on the ground, Elvis was a little relieved.It looked like that young man in front of him didn\u2019t have any intention to kill him; he was needed for the exploration of the Ruin. \u201cThis is great. After I recover and restore my powers, I\u2019ll pretend to cooperate with this king and slowly take control of Chambord in secret, as well as figure out how he\u2019s hiding his undead magic powers. By that time, I\u2019ll sneak attack and kill him with a surprise\u2026\u2026Hehehe, I can monopolize the resources in the Ruins and no one will know.\u201d\u201cYoung man, I have already given you the map, please heal me quickly. I can\u2019t hold any longer\u2026\u2026\u201d The four star mage Elvis reminded Fei.\u201cAh? Okokok. I\u2019m a man of my words\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei folded the map back into a small square and put it into the storage space in his belt. He then took out a bottle of \u3010Healing Potion\u3011, squatted down and said, \u201cSir Elvis, it\u2019s my pleasure to cooperate with you. After we join forces, we can keep the Ruins all to ourselves. Hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, young man, you made the right decision.\u201d Elvis was finally relieved. He smiled, but an undetectable viciousness flashed through his eyes.\u201cUnfortunately, you made a not-so-right decision\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei\u2019s expression suddenly turned cold and his hands instantly grabbed the mage by his neck. With some force, \u201cCrack!\u201d Elvis\u2019 upper spinal cord and throat were cracked into pieces.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201dThe sign of life slowly disappeared from Elvis\u2019 eyes. His was stunned up until his death and the smile on his face still hadn\u2019t faded away. Never in his wildest dreams would he have understood why the young king in front of him dared to kill him. He knew that the king needed a powerful mage to open and explore a Mythical Ruin. How and where could the little Chambord Kingdom recruit a suitable mage?Of course, if he knew that Fei had the confidence and ability to advance to a four star mage in the Diablo World, he wouldn\u2019t have given up that map so easily. Also, Fei didn\u2019t swear to God of War under the name and soul of Alexander, but how could Elvis had known that the real Alexander and his soul was already gone.\u201cWith a snake like you, how could I attempt such an impossible cooperation?\u201d Fei shook his head and whispered.This mage named Elvis had devastating power and had a strong background. Also, with his vicious mind, Fei didn\u2019t dare heal him back to full health. If he became careless for a moment, he would lose the whole game and get bitten by the poisonous snake. By that time, the fall of the kingdom and the slaughtering of civilians would occur in seconds. The story of the farmer and the snake was told by Aesop thousands of years ago. Fei wasn\u2019t dumb enough to use his warm body to save a vicious poisonous snake.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one would know except for Fei. No one could blame Fei\u2019s ruthlessness. On Azeroth Continent which followed the \u201crule of the jungle\u201d, Fei couldn\u2019t allow himself to be negligent, not even once.\u201cWe maybe similar, but luck just wasn\u2019t on your side.\u201dFei took out a bottle of \u3010Mana Potion\u3011 and sipped some down his throat. He had to replenish the mana that was depleted when he used \u3010Find Potion\u3011. Then, he pressed his palm on Mage Elvis\u2019 corpse and lightly roared and used the ability \u3010Find Potion\u3011again.\u201cPlump!\u201dA sound from heaven rung in Fei\u2019s ear.\u201cYes!\u201dFei was stoked. Another bottle of green \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 appeared in mid-air; it shined a mysterious light. The weak newborn-like spirit energy surrounded the bottle and gave Fei a feeling of intimacy.Fei put this precious bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 back in his storage space in the belt and thought for a second. He switched to Sorcerer Mode and shot a few \u3010Fire Bolts\u3011 onto the corpse lying on the ground and the bone fragments left by the skeleton warrior. The remains burned into ashes, destroying the last bit of evidence.After the corpses were burnt, Fei\u2019s eyes landed on the magic armour and a few magic weapons and devices that belonged to the silver masked knight. Except for that, in the ashes, Elvis\u2019 storage ring wasn\u2019t destroyed by the fire; it was still shiny, giving Fei an unspeakable temptation.Fei knew that with Elvis\u2019 power and background, there must\u2019ve been a lot of treasures and valuables in his storage ring. Moreover, the silver masked knight was royalty from a level 4 Empire, so his amour and items had to be valuable. If he rewarded them to the leaders in Chambord, the strength of Chambord would increase. Even if he didn\u2019t distribute them to the others and sold them off on the black market, he could get a lot of useful resources in return.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026. it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201dElvis and the prince had a ton of status. Their items would attract a lot of attention. If someone found out about them and traced their origins back to Chambord, many incidents would be instantly exposed. Neither Fei nor Chambord would be able to bear this level of risk and danger. Fei had to take out any kind of dangers right off the bat and do all he could do to give more time for Chambord to grow stronger. Fei wasn\u2019t powerful enough to take on the Level 4 Eindhoven Empire.Fei felt his heart breaking.But finally, he made up his mind and shot out a ton of \u3010Fire Bolts\u3011 at the ring, armour and items. He burned them in the fire and tried to destroy these valuable items into a pile of junk to eliminate any possibilities.However \u2013\u201cEh? Not afraid of fire?\u201dFei surprisingly found out that although the fire covered and buried the ring, armour and items in it, after a few minutes had passed, there were no signs of them melting or being destroyed. The blue magic power was still surrounding the armour, and the ring was still shining a white light. No matter how the fire burned, they were still maintained their form.\u201cLooks like treasures are truly treasures, but what should I do? These things will be the causes of disasters\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei tried \u3010Ice Bolts\u3011 and \u3010Charged Bolts\u3011; he even switched back to Necromancer Mode and tried to destroy the items using his death energy, but it was no use. He also wanted to try to crush them into small pieces, but after thinking about the different situations that might occur if the magic items were shattered into pieces and the magic power in them were released, he didn\u2019t want to do that anymore. After a while, he ended up putting all of them into his storage belt and decided to destroy them later when he became more powerful.At this time, there were only a few iron chains left in the concealed room. Fei calculated the time and realized that he had stayed at the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon for more than three hours. It was probably dark outside already; it was time to leave.But before he left, there was one more thing that he had to do \u2013 test Warden Oleg.\u201cOleg, come on in!\u201d Fei shouted.Warden Oleg rushed in a couple of steps. As soon as he arrived, he surprisingly found out that all the prisoners had disappeared. What was left were three sets of iron chains and five piles of black ashes. He knew that the three mercenaries and the mage were all killed, and their corpses were burnt alongside the silver masked man\u2019s corpse. He suddenly felt devastated and was even more scared of the young king\u2019s ruthless heart. He didn\u2019t even dare to take a long breath as he stood behind Fei timidly.\u201cOleg, tell me, when you rushed in earlier, what did you see?\u201d Fei asked causally.But Oleg on the other hand was shocked by the question and started to sweat like crazy. He thought that Fei wanted to kill him, so he kneeled down and begged, \u201cYour Majesty, please forgive me. I beg for your mercy! I didn\u2019t see anything. I only\u2026\u2026only saw Your Majesty studying the carvings and lines on the stone wall\u2026\u2026 Please pardon me!\u201dFei looked at Oleg who was shaking as if he was having a seizure and smiled. \u201cGet up, when did I say that I was going to kill you?\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty!\u201d Oleg didn\u2019t dare resist Fei\u2019s command. He stood up as his body shook in fear.\u201cHis highness \u2013 the God of War created a miracle and restored my intelligence four days ago. In these four days, too many situations occurred. I\u2019ve gained a rough understanding of the situation in Chambord the past three years. The evil conspirator Bazzer abused his power and threw the kingdom into chaos and persecuted my citizens. The former Military Judge Conca also assisted him in his conspiracies. Bazzer fled and is now getting chased, and the latter was executed by me. You, Oleg, helped Bazzer in executing a few of his evil plans in the past three years. Even if you die a thousand times, it\u2019s not enough to quell the public anger\u2026\u2026\u201dOleg started shivering more and more as he heard Fei\u2019s words. As if he was walking on a tightrope between skyscrapers, he felt his heart was about to burst out of his chest while his body was being kept in a freezer. As he heard the last sentence, he kneeled down to the ground and started to beg for mercy again.Fei looked at him and continued, \u201c I\u2019m not a brutal killer. You followed me to the stone bridge that day to battle our enemies; you killed forty-five enemies and injured yourself while saving four of your companions\u2019 lives. All of these things were clearly observed by me. That counts as you redeeming yourself, so I didn\u2019t punish you for what you did before\u2026\u2026 Merits shall be rewarded and wrongs shall be punished. This is my governing principle of the kingdom. Your companions such as Brook, Pierce, Drogba have all received great rewards, and you were the only one who remained at the same position without obtaining any rewards. Have you ever complained about it?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, Oleg wouldn\u2019t dare do so\u2026\u2026I understood that Your Majesty was pardoning me on purpose, so you sent Mr. Brook to the Prison this morning to give me a heads up and allow me some time to prepare and get rid of all the bad things in the prison to make up for all the mistakes I\u2019ve committed. Your Majesty is gracious and I\u2019m very grateful of it. I\u2019m willing to give up everything I have to assist Your Majesty, even if I have to bleed to death!\u201d\u201cEh, as long as you understand.\u201d Fei said lightly, \u201cRight now in Chambord, Brook is intelligent, but due to his integrity, he lacks the necessary roundness. People such as Pierce and Drogba are all great warriors on the battlefield, but their heads aren\u2019t that good. Uncle Lampard hates political affairs and Uncle Bast is tied down by other duties. Chambord is only lacking someone like you who is shameless, slimy, deceitful that can do the dirty work for me. I have the intention to use and depend on you, but\u2026\u2026\u201dFei paused deliberately for a few seconds here.Oleg knew that Fei wanted. He patted his chest and swore, \u201cTo the God of War, I, Oleg am willing to become the most loyal hyena of His Majesty Alexander. I shall be on the front line wherever he points. If my words and deeds don\u2019t match, I shall go to hell when I die and face torture for an eternity.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a huge believer in oaths\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei continued, \u201cI emphasize practical actions. There are a few things that I need you to do for me as soon as you can. I will wait for your performance.\u201d\u201cPlease order me, Your Majesty. I will do my best!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: The Right to Chase Dreams\u201cEh, first of all, I feel that this Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon is very dark and humid. There isn\u2019t any sunlight in here all day; the entire environment is horrible. I also read in the documents that many weak prisoners died in the prison due to illnesses that weren\u2019t treated in time. This proves that this place isn\u2019t too suitable for keeping prisoners, especially since the citizens of Chambord are simple folks. Even if they commit a crime, they are likely only minor offenses. Disputes between neighbours and minor offenses shouldn\u2019t be treated this way. Therefore, I have decided construct a simple prison outside of this underground maze to keep all the minor offenders. Oleg, take care of that for me as fast as you can.\u201dOleg was surprised.He didn\u2019t expect that the first thing the King wanted him to do was this. Logically speaking, this Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon was 100% secure. No one had escaped from here in centuries; it was the perfect prison. However\u2026\u2026Oleg didn\u2019t dare to object and question any of the king\u2019s decisions. He quickly flattered the king to show his loyalty, \u201cYour Majesty is kind and very compassionate towards your subjects. Please be assured that I will build this external prison in the shortest amount of time.\u201dFei nodded and added worriedly, \u201cEh, great. But you have to remember, don\u2019t disturb the public and don\u2019t forcefully recruit citizens into compulsory labour\u2026\u2026Hmm, the tattered Healing Facility for wounded soldiers is unbearable to look at. How about you just bring some people and fix that place up; transform it into a simple prison. The Kingdom currently has limited financial resources, so just do some simple repairs to it.\u201dOleg knew it was an opportunity for him. He immediately took it upon himself, \u201cYour Majesty, Oleg will bear all the costs associated with repairing and transforming the new prison. The Kingdom doesn\u2019t have to spend a penny.\u201dFei was waiting for Oleg to say that.He smiled as he tapped Oleg\u2019s shoulder and agreed, \u201cEh, I\u2019m very pleased by your loyalty. Remember, my governing principle distinguishes between reward and punishment. If your merits and sacrifices are valuable and recognized by all the citizens, I won\u2019t let you suffer any loss.\u201dAfter he said that, Fei smiled as he walked toward the exit of the water dungeon.Oleg was excited when he heard those words of encouragement.Even his shoulders that were tapped by the King\u2019s hand felt warm. He knew that transforming the prison was a great opportunity for him. He made a decision that he would do a good job of completing the operation, even if it took all his wealth. Moreover, the King had clearly hinted that he didn\u2019t just need to satisfy him, but also the citizens as well\u2026\u2026 This kind of hint gave him more confidence.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After leaving the dark and gloomy prison, Fei sent away the guards and slowly walked towards the city centre on his own through the path on the mountain as he enjoyed the beauty of his kingdom under the sunset.He accomplished a few things today: revamping the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon and surprisingly discovering and acquiring the precious Map of the Mythical Ruins. Fei was hyped; under the beautiful scenery and sounds of nature, he had the urge to roar into the sky.Under the sunset, everything seemed golden. It was supper time, and smoke from cooking curled up across the residences. Birds returned to their nests and leaves returned to their roots.Fei was walking leisurely in the castle; he was in no rush to get back.He wanted to observe the daily lives of his citizens close up. Every scene was new and fresh to Fei who just gotten to this world. It was as if he walked into a fantasy world; the stone structures and building, huge stone statues of Gods, exotic culture, and everything around him were things that he had never seen before. Beside opening his eyes, he had a strange feeling that he was merging into this world.This castle was quiet and peaceful, as if it was in heaven.Fei\u2019s \u201cfame\u201d in the kingdom was unparalleled; there wasn\u2019t a single person that didn\u2019t recognize him. When he was walking on the street, people came up and greeted him frequently. Although there was a huge status separation on Azeroth Continent, it wasn\u2019t like ancient times on Earth where subjects had to kneel down to the empire every time they saw him. That saved Fei a lot of trouble. He smiled and responded back to them as he walked in the castle and enjoyed the exotic sceneries. He was surprised to find that he was slowly getting attaching to this small remote kingdom and becoming a part of it. The feeling of inseparability grew in his heart crazily like grass after a heavy rain.\u201cHey, you sly Zacker, stop running!\u201dChildren\u2019s laughter sounded beside Fei\u2019s ear. A clumsy boy rushed out of a dark alley and crashed into Fei by accident. The little guy opened his crystal blue diamond-like eyes widely and stared at Fei. A bunch of kids were chasing behind him, a mix of boys and girls. They were dirty; they all had dust on their little faces and wrinkled clothes. They smiled as they saw Fei.Fei was surprised to see Pierce\u2019s 12-year-old daughter Louise in the crowd. The girl who looked like a pretty and delicate doll was currently messy. Her red hair was scattered around her shoulders, and a few dark mud stains \u201cdecorated\u201d her white face. It was hard for Fei to relate her to the girl who was cold and mature and willing to become his lover if he saved her father. She was a child after all; she would show her childish and playful side when she was playing with kids in her age group.\u201cIt\u2019s King Alexander\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment that Fei recognized Louise, she had also recognized Fei as well. An undetectable shyness and slyness flashed on her face. She and her friends quickly surrounded Fei.Soon, the citizens of Chambord discovered something very interesting.As if they found a new favourite toy, more and more mischievous kids formed a circle on the small square. They sat quietly on the ground as they rested their heads on their knees and burst into laughter occasionally. In the middle of the circle, it was their supreme King Alexander who was telling stories to the kids. He had a bright smile on his face; just like the traveling poets and storytellers, he held kids in his lap and arms and told them stories and tales, disregarding the dirt on their clothes.\u201cGod of War, thank you for your generosity for giving us such an brave and honourable king.\u201dEveryone who saw the scene felt something growing in their hearts. Originally, some women were looking for their kids for supper angrily with a broom in their hands. However, after seeing their kids listening to King Alexander\u2019s stories, they were surprised and delighted. They all stood on the side and waited patiently.\u2026\u2026In the middle of the circle.\u201cHaha, alright. That\u2019s enough for today. There are more stories to the adventure of the Evil Master Mage Bumblebee and his lazy servant Sam. If you guys want, I will tell you guys more tomorrow. It\u2019s dark already, quickly go home and eat your supper!\u201d Fei rubbed the dirty face off a little guy who was sitting beside him. He then stood up and slapped the dirt off of his butt and smiled as he ended the storytelling session for today.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to go home. It\u2019s so boring.\u201d The kids murmured as they complained.The little guys wanted more. They all stared at Fei as they were reluctant to leave Fei. It made Fei feel very proud, as if he had won a war. He laughed, \u201d You guys are still young. When you grow up, you can become prestige mages and honourable warriors. Just like Bumblebee, you guys will have experiences and adventures with your servants\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut we can\u2019t become mages and warriors\u2026\u2026 Your Majesty, my dad only knows how to work with metal. I can only become a blacksmith.\u201d A boy said in pity.\u201cYeah, no mage would want to teach kids from an ordinary family, and we don\u2019t have energy training scrolls\u2026\u2026\u201d Another boy said in wrinkly clothes. \u201cMy family is too poor. We can\u2019t even have full meals. My dad said that he will send me to Viscount Lousie\u2019s mansion to become a servant\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOnly nobles and rich merchants in Chambord can afford getting a Mage or warrior teacher for their kids\u2026\u2026\u201d The red haired Louise added as she winked her eyes. \u201cOnly if someone is willing to teach us\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s too bad, but my lazy dad doesn\u2019t know anything about energy, humph!\u201dThe kids were all suddenly disappointed. The smiles disappeared from the little dirty faces and they were replaced by sadness that didn\u2019t belong to kids of their age. They all wanted to become heroes, but the cruel reality murdered their dreams at the infant stage. The low social status and pressure for survival took away their right to chase after their dreams.After seeing the sad and disappointed faces, Fei felt his heart ache.Suddenly, a lightbulb flashed in his head and he had a terrific idea.\u2026\u2026After he returned to the palace, the servants had already prepared the dinner. Angela and Emma were no where to be found; Fei felt a bit strange. The royal \u201cchefs\u201d skills were not that good; for the last couple days, except for roasted meat, bread and milk, there were only fruits. Fei was already over them, but he had to get some food into his stomach. After eating a few bites, he walked to his private quarters in the palace. He wanted some peace and quiet so he could think through the couple of important plans he wanted to execute.At this time, Angela finally returned with Emma.\u201cWhere did you guys go? I haven\u2019t seen you guys all day.\u201d Fei smiled.\u201cHehehe, Your Majesty, did you miss Angela?\u201dEmma winked at Fei as she pushed Angela into Fei\u2019s arms. She giggled, \u201cit was quite a coincidence. We bumped into Princess Tanasha in the Royal Canonization Legion and chatted with her for a long time\u2026\u2026 Your Majesty, her highness is very friendly. She didn\u2019t talk to us with any air of superiority. She had a good conversation with Angela\u2026\u2026Hehe, she also asked a lot of things about Your Majesty.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That princess of Zenit Empire was very cunning. Angela and Emma were both too naive to be Tanasha\u2019s match. Fei was almost certain that the princess intentionally \u201cmet\u201d them to steal a lot of information calmly and collectedly.Although he knew what was going on, Fei put on a smile, \u201cReally? Hahaha, who doesn\u2019t love a girl like Angela? It looks like the eldest princess of the Zenit Empire was charmed by our beautiful Angela, hahaha\u2026\u2026 Oh right, Angela, what did you talk about with her highness the whole day?\u201d\u201cWe talked about a lot of stuff\u2026\u2026\u201d Angela blushed due to Fei\u2019s bold praise, and a shy expression appeared on her face. She pretended to fix her hair calmly, but she looked down and was too shy to look at Fei. She continued, \u201cHer highness was very interested in Chambord\u2019s history. We talked about a lot of old stories from when the old king was still alive, the current influential figures in Chambord, eh, and of course the Defensive War that just ended\u2026\u2026 Alexander, her highness really admires your actions when you took on the entire enemy troops by yourself. She said that you\u2019re a brave and intelligent king that is worth of all our respect.\u201dFei could only bitterly laugh at that in his mind.The two naive girls completely fell into that elder princess\u2019 trap. After today, Tanasha probably knew all the things that she should and shouldn\u2019t have known; including all the mysterious, bizarre incidences that happened to Alexander in the last couple days.\u201cWe also talked about\u2026\u2026Ah?\u201d As Angela was speaking, she suddenly gasped. This pure, flawless girl finally realized something; she raised her head and looked at Fei and asked timidly, \u201cAl\u2026\u2026Alexander, did I say something that I shouldn\u2019t have said?\u201dFei smiled as he shook his head, \u201cNo, the things you said aren\u2019t important\u2026\u2026Oh, Angela, let\u2019s not talk about that now. I have something to show you. You should give me some recommendations.\u201d Fei grabbed Angela\u2019s soft hand and walked towards the main palace. Angela pretended to try to pull her hand away, but after a few \u201cunsuccessful tries\u201d, she \u201cgave up\u201d and let Fei hold onto her hand. Emma who was behind them saw the whole thing and started giggling\u2026\u2026Emma didn\u2019t follow them.Fei didn\u2019t want Angela to know what really happened. Even if Angela didn\u2019t talk with Tanasha, she would definitely find about what happened in Chambord through other means. He never expected to hide everything from Tanasha.They soon arrived at the main palace.Fei took out a delicately tanned soft animal skin that was as thin as paper. He also took out a quill and started to draw on it. Although he was studying to be a linguist, he loved making sketches and was quite good at it. Quickly, a series of vivid drawings appeared on the animal skin.Angela stood on the side and watched quietly, from confusion to a rough understanding, to staring at Fei in surprise. The smart girl finally knew what Fei was drawing on the animal skin when he was almost finished \u2013 They were a series of designs of strange looking clothes.\u201cHehe, done!\u2026\u2026 What do you think?\u201d Angela, take a look. If we make clothes according to these designs, would you want to wear them?\u201d Fei pointed at the animal skin and asked proudly.The designs that he drew out were thoughtfully selected. After taking into account the history and culture on Azeroth Continent, he didn\u2019t draw any outrageous outfits such as jeans, stockings, and mini-skirts. There were a total of 10 designs. The five female designs closely resembled European Crinolines; Fei intentionally referenced the females dressed in Pirates of Caribbean and tried to make each design very classy. The five male designs were closer to modern day men\u2019s clothing. The main change was that Fei add on trousers \u2013 Chambord\u2019s custom of men not wearing any pants was very uncomfortable, so Fei added pants into the designs.Angela held the animal skin in her hands and stared at the designs. Her long eyelashes fluttered as if they were lightly brushing and tickling Fei\u2019s heart\u2026\u2026 She looked at them closely and opened her pretty mouth in surprise, \u201cAlexander, these dresses are so beautiful, I like them a lot\u2026.. But, what are these things for?\u201d Angela pointed at a few parts on the designs and asked curiously.Fei took a look at those parts and patiently explained the function of each piece. A few dresses in Pirates of Caribbean were pretty sophisticated and complicated to make. Fei greatly simplified them using his understanding, but Angela still took the trouble to ask several times\u2026\u2026 Fortunately, women were born with a great instinct on clothing. At last, after some in-depth explanations, Angela had completely fallen in love with these 5 sets of female clothing designs.\u201cI can\u2019t wait to put these on!\u201d the beautiful girl said.Fei laughed.It seemed like human\u2019s pursuit for beauty was common, no matter where one was. The 10 designs represented an era and civilization, and they quickly conquered the future queen. This gave him a bit more confidence on one of his future plans.\u201cAngela, I might be very busy the next few days. Could you and Emma help me make these sets of clothes and see how the results are?\u201d Fei asked.\u201cNo problem. Aunt Sophia, Laura, Danny, Uncle Lawrence and I are very close. They are the best tailors in Chambord. We can definitely make these clothes in the shortest amount of time.\u201d Angela was very happy that she was finally able to help Alexander out. She agreed without any hesitation.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s great.\u201d Fei was stoked. He rolled his eyes and suddenly said again, \u201cAngela, to thank you, I decided to design a special gift for you.\u201dAfter he said that, he picked out the quill again and started drawing on another sheet of animal skin.Angela was overjoyed. She couldn\u2019t wait to see what Fei had specially designed for her. However, until Fei finished, she had no idea what was being drawn on the animal skin. There were three thin ribbons connecting two circular cloths together. Although it looked familiar, the naive girl couldn\u2019t figure out what it was for. \u201cIs this also clothing? How do I wear this thing? Where do I wear it?\u201dAfter seeing the puzzled look on Angela\u2019s face, Fei whispered into the girl\u2019s ear to explain\u2026\u2026.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dTwo red clouds suddenly appeared on Angela\u2019s fine white face. She stared at Fei \u201cangrily\u201d; her bashful expression suddenly took away the color in the whole world. The girl covered her face and ran out of the main palace.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the next few days, a couple strange incidences occurred in Chambord.The first thing was that the greedy and vicious Warden Oleg dramatically changed his attitude. He unexpectedly spent his own money and fixed up the old crumbling Healing Facility for the wounded soldiers. He also started renovating the place. According to his words, he was following the king\u2019s command and building a new prison to keep prisoner who committed minor crimes.It was a great feeling.The citizens of Chambord could finally get away from that terrible hell-like Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon. Before, a few citizens who only got locked up for a few months because of disputes and fights between neighbours died in the prison due to illnesses caused by the humid and cold environment. The new prison would definitely solve that problem. After considering it, a lot of citizens volunteered in the operation of building the new prison. Oleg was surprised and stoked at the same time. With more manpower, the duration of the project could shorten by a ton.The second thing was that every night, the brave and honourable King Alexander would appear on the stone square on the north side of Castle and tell stories to the kids in the kingdom. Quickly, the story of the Evil Mage Bumblebee and his servant Sam, the Holy Druid Garfield and his summoner beast friends traveling to the west and slaying the dragon, the pure snow and the seven dwarf warriors who help defeat the female Lich King and free her kingdom, started to spread in Chambord through the kids. Gradually, except for the kids, even adults started to come to the square and listen to the king\u2019s stories.After a few days, the people surprisingly saw King Alexander wearing a set of strange looking clothes that no one had seen before. Although the clothes looked strange, the citizens of Chambord quickly got use to it. After seeing it for a while, the citizens gradually felt that the clothes worn by King Alexander were great. The two \u201ccloth tubes\u201d looked especially good and kept in a lot of warmth.Finally, on the eighth day, Fei arrived on the square and brought a whole carriage of those special clothes. As a present, he gave them to the kids and the poor families. It was approaching late autumn and the weather was getting colder and colder. These clothes could help the poorer citizens stay warm.Of course, Fei also wanted these clothes to become popular in Chambord through this method \u2013 his lowest goal was to at least let the citizens start to like to wear pants.The third thing was that at the tenth day\u2019s evening after Fei finished his story session, he announced a new law as the king \u2013 All the kids between the age of 6 to 15 had to take out one hour everyday to receive all kinds of training from the Chambord Civil and Military Acadamy. It was also recorded into the Kingdom\u2019s Law Book, so it had to be complied with, and no parents could stop it or else it would be considered illegal.The so called Chambord Civil and Military Academy was established in the mansion of the former Head Minister Bazzer. After some simple restructuring, the environment and the condition were very good. What made everyone go crazy in Chambord was that the teachers in the Academy included people such as the number one warrior Frank-Lampard and the new military Guru Brook. King Alexander even personally took on the role of Principal at the Academy\u2026\u2026After hearing of the teachers and instructors at the Academy, everyone scrambled to put their children into the Chambord Civil and Military Academy.Some poor families were still worrying about the high cost, but after hearing that the Academy didn\u2019t charge any fees, all their fears vanished. On Azeroth Continent where people followed the rule of the jungle, there wasn\u2019t a single parent that didn\u2019t want their kids to become strong warriors or powerful mages. These dreams were unreachable for them, but after hearing King Alexander\u2019s command, their unreachable dreams were getting closer to them than they ever imagined; they could even smell it. They all knew that the word \u201cgift\u201d was more fitting than the word \u201ccommand\u201d; it was the generous gift from the kind King Alexander. Letting their kids get instructed by the strong star ranked warriors was an opportunity for their kids to change their own destinies and lives.Great and Merciful King Alexander.Chambord had never been so busy and cheerful these past couple of days. The young King Alexander continued to bring his subjects one unexpected surprise after another. The citizens had gotten used to wearing the good looking and comfortable trousers when they chatted and drank. When they proudly talked about their son or daughter getting praised by Mr. Lampard, they were always tempted to shout \u201cLong live the King!\u201d, as they hit their wine glasses together, sending their young king the best wishes with stunning sounds.\u2026\u2026Of course, Fei didn\u2019t relax either these couple of days.Except for taking care of trifling matters, he spent a ton of time in the Royal Library. He read almost all the books and his understanding of Azeroth Continent grew exponentially. At the same time, Fei didn\u2019t give up on studying the various skills from the Diablo World. His Barbarian was already level 20. the Sorceress was level 10, his Paladin was level 12 and his Necromancer Character was level 12\u2026\u2026He also had accumulated about a dozen bottles of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011. Through these days of research and experimentation, Fei almost fully understood the effects this \u201cmutated potion\u201d. He felt it was time to use this potion to enhance the strength of the leaders in Chambord.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 76.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76.1: There\u2019s one more bottle (1)Since more than ten days ago, the little second commander of the King\u2019s Guards was promoted by the young King Alexander to the number one seat in Chambord\u2019s Military. Brook now had control over all the military power in Chambord and was called one of the [Two Gurus] in Chambord along with the new Head Minister Bast. One star warrior Brook\u2019s future skyrocketed and became one of the most influential figures in Chambord, above everyone else except for one person. Even the richest merchants who didn\u2019t even bother to acknowledge him before would now put on a big smile on their faces, invite Brook to their parties frequently, and send him gifts and cute maids. People visited his place from morning till night everyday. The hinges on his door were almost worn out because of it.If it was anyone else, this huge change in status would probably make them dizzy and get them carried away. However, this warrior born in a poor family had finally shown his integrity, boldness and flexibility. To anyone who was trying to network and befriend him purposely, his principle was quiet surprising \u2013 he would neither accept or coldly reject them. He would mildly satisfy everyone that came to his door.He used painstaking effort in order to achieve this \u2013 Chambord was currently greatly weakened after the war and needed to recover. Moreover, in half a year Chambord would have to take on another life and death challenge in Zenit\u2019s Military Practice. King Alexander said that the goal in front of them was to unite all the powers and strength they could and build up Chambord quickly with the least amount of resources. Therefore, Brook didn\u2019t want to stimulate any hidden conflicts between the young king and the old school nobles. He had to at least maintain a superficial friendliness.Except for burying his head into rectifying military affairs, Brook spent a lot of his time on reforming the military planning. It was his main objective for the next thirty days. King Alexander had mentioned a few requirements and also vaguely expressed some stunning ideas. Brook carefully studied and thought about these ideas; the more he thought about it, the more excited he got. There were many things that he never considered. He was even confused and didn\u2019t understand when the king mentioned them for the first time. But slowly, he felt that those ideas and plans were impeccable. After tailoring those ideas to fit them into Chambord\u2019s current situation, Chambord would experience an enormous change for the better.Of course, as the power in his hands grew heavier and heavier, Brook also felt huge unprecedented pressure.After King Alexander returned to normal, his strength and long-term vision both increased at an astonishing rate. Recently, during a chat in their free time at Chambord\u2019s Civil and Military Academy, the number one warrior Lampard actually implicitly admitted that the King\u2019s strength had increase to a level that he couldn\u2019t even estimate. He probably couldn\u2019t even defeat Alexander.That left people such as Brook and Pierce a ton of pressure.They knew that if they wanted to follow the king and battle and bleed for Chambord, they had to improve their strength; that was essential. If they couldn\u2019t keep up with their majestic king, they would be gradually left behind and eventually become useless men.During this time, the strongmen such as Pierce and Drogba \u201cgot\u201d a set of strange training methods from the King and started to excessively train themselves everyday. Brook on the other hand was busy with military affairs and had limited time to train. He gradually felt that he was falling more and more behind and there was nothing that he could do.When he was struggling one day, Fei sent his guard Fernando-Torres to Brook along with a king\u2019s command \u2013 \u201cMr. Brook, His Majesty has asked you to head to his palace right away. There is something very important that His Majesty wants to talk to you about.\u201dBrook was lost; he didn\u2019t remember Fei previously telling him that he wanted to discuss an important matter today. He followed Torres to the main palace.After he stepped into the palace, he was surprised to find out that the First Commander of King\u2019s Guards Peter-Cech was sitting down on a chair and having a conversation with King Alexander. Except for the two of them, no one else was in the palace.\u201cHaha Brook, you got here just in time. I have something very important for you two to see.\u201dAfter seeing Brook\u2019s arrival, Fei laughed as he walked down from his throne that was surrounded by two lion-like monster statues. He tapped Brook\u2019s shoulder and suddenly opened up his palm. Cech and Brook both felt something flash in front of their eyes as a small green bottle appeared in Fei\u2019s palm. A green liquid was stored in the elongated crystal bottle\u2026\u2026It had a light touch of magic power.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d Both Cech and Brook were surprised.\u201cHehe, this is a violent energy potion that I recently put together\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei explained with his nonsense. He spoke proudly, \u201cBut I prefer calling it \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011. Hehehe, this is a very magical potion\u2026\u2026.\u201d Fei paused a little bit to create more suspense.\u201c\u3010Hulk Potion\u3011? That name is very strange\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook could feel the light magic power hiding within the potion. He subconsciously asked, \u201cYour Majesty, what\u2019s the special effect of this potion?\u201d\u201cOf course, Hehehehe, it has the effect of instantly increasing one\u2019s strength by a few times\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei wanted to show off. \u201cIt sounds like the [Mad Potion] that magic pharmacists put together, but the difference between the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 and those low class [Mad Potions] is that the strength enhancing effect is permanent!\u201d\u201cPermanent improvement?\u201d Cech and Brook were both flabbergasted. They stared at the potion in Fei\u2019s hand and gasped involuntarily, \u201cHow is that possible? Could this be one of the epic potions from the legends?\u201dUnder the mage classifications on Azeroth Continent, there was a branch of magic pharmacists. These magic pharmacists could create a lot of strange potions. The potions all had different effects, and due to the differences in effects and materials required for each potion, there were many ranks from low to high. The epic potions from legends were one of the highly ranked potions. They all had incredible effects and there were a few recorded epic potions that could permanently enhance one\u2019s strength\u2026\u2026But those were all items from the legends. Epic potions could only be created by epic leveled magic pharmacists, they also need a lot of rare and precious raw materials. These raw materials would even be considered rare by the level 8 and 9 super powerful Empires on the continent. Fei casually took out a potion that he claimed to have the same effect as epic potions, so Cech and Brook naturally had a hard time believing their eyes and ears.\u201cAh? Epic Potion? How is that possible, I don\u2019t have any of those precious raw materials to make such a potion\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei read a ton of books in the Royal Library, so he knew what the epic potions that the two were talking about was. He rolled his eyes and rejected that idea while smiling, \u201cHehe, although the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 has such a powerful effect, it has a terrifying side effect\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s why I hesitated for a long time before telling you guys about it. If you guys can endure through the side effect, the real effect would definitely be satisfying. The potion is here, if you wish, you guys can decide among yourselves who wants to give it a try.\u201d\u201cTerrifying side effect?\u201dBrook and Cech looked at each other in unison. The shock in their eyes quieted down a bit. They believed this explanation a lot more. If the potion didn\u2019t have any side effects and could enhance one\u2019s strength permanently and flawlessly, then this \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 would definitely be ranked as one of the epic potions; it would be too precious.Brook hesitated for a few seconds, and suddenly raised his head and said, \u201cLet me try it out!\u201dThe date of Zenit\u2019s Imperial Military Practice was getting closer and closer. There was nowhere that Chambord could back off to. If Chambord lost in this event, their kingdom would be gone. Even though Chambord had two trump cards \u2013 Lampard and King Alexander, the military practice was based on the total score for the ten matches. There was no way that the Kingdom could depend on just the two of them. If Chambord wanted an overall win, other people\u2019s strength had to improve as well. Time was tight, and to Gordon-Brook who was single-mindedly focusing on increasing his strength and fighting alongside the king, the potion in front of him might\u2019ve been dangerous, but perhaps it could be his last and only opportunity.Brook made up his mind and reached out for the bottle of green potion.Last Chapter____________________________Note: I split this chapter into two parts because the chapters are pretty long and Big Udon is pretty busy, so he sends me the translated version in parts so that I can edit it as he translates and so that I won\u2019t have to edit super late at night.

He pulled open the lid on the bottle and chugged down the entire bottle.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201dBrook panicked.Cech was only pardoned more than ten days ago by the King and barely got out of Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon alive. He got ill from the moist and dark environment and the torture in the prison, so his body was very weak. His two energy swirls that represented his two star warrior strength and status was torn and ruined by the former Head Minister Bazzer\u2019s vicious methods. All of his two star energy had mostly disappeared and his strength dropped significantly. Although he could get it back and return to being a two star warrior, it would take a long period of time. Cech\u2019s body was at its weakest stage; by taking this \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 which had a terrifying side effect, if he wasn\u2019t able to endure through it, his life might even be on the line\u2026\u2026He knew that Cech didn\u2019t want him to take the risk which was why he took the potion first.At this point, Brook was very nervous. However, there was nothing that he could do. He could only stare at Cech closely; he didn\u2019t even dare to blink his eyes, because he was afraid that he might miss some signs of dangers.Fei on the other side was secretly laughing to himself shamelessly.After a few seconds, the side effects that Brook was worrying about appeared \u2013At first, a bright green light suddenly appeared on Cech\u2019s forehead between his eyebrows. It gave off an indescribable magic power. Then, it gradually began to spread downwards in a cloudy fashion. The green light became more and more dense, and soon Cech\u2019s head was dyed in green, and even his hair became green as well. It seemed very strange.As the same time, drops of sweat the size of beans started dripping down his green forehead. The muscles on his face also started twitching unconsciously. Clearly, he was under unimaginable pain.Brook was shocked.He turned his head and looked at Fei, and found that he didn\u2019t panic at all. Instead, he had a faint smile on his face. This calmed Brook down a little bit; he held back his worries and concerns and continued observing Cech\u2019s state.That green light was getting thicker and thicker and started spreading onto Cech\u2019s whole body. Starting from his head, it quickly covered his neck, chest, waist, arms, hands and legs\u2026\u2026After more than tens of seconds, the First Commander of the King\u2019s Guard Peter-Cech had become a green person. Even his arm hair was glittering green like a jade. This condition was no different than getting poisoned by exotic toxins. What worried Brook more was that he could clearly see that it was as if there was something alive that was drilling and surging underneath Cech\u2019s skin. It created many bulges that continued rushing around in Cech\u2019s body. The blue veins bulged and sweat dripped down like rain\u2026\u2026This process was obviously extremely painful.\u201cNo wonder why it\u2019s called [Hulk Potion], Cech is getting bigger and bigger.\u201d Brook thought.Fei had a chill when he saw that.Fei tried the potion on himself when he was doing the experiments, and the pain of the body enhancement was unbearable; it was like having tens of thousands of ants crawling through his body and devouring every bit of his muscle, having someone cut the flesh off of him piece by piece and deep frying his entire body\u2026\u2026even though Fei was tough, he didn\u2019t want to experience this hellish pain ever again. This was especially true since the [Hulk Potion] wasn\u2019t effective on Fei.After half a minute, the painful expression on Cech\u2019s face toned down a bit, and the dense green light dimmed down. Suddenly, a powerful sensation came off of Cech\u2019s body. Brook was very familiar with this sensation. He often felt this sensation from King Alexander. It was the sensation of a breathtaking and dragon-like pure physical strength. What surprised him even more was that this sensation was getting stronger and stronger. This meant that the strength in Cech\u2019s body was increasing very quickly.After another minute, the greenness on Cech was almost negligible, and the sensation finally stopped growing stronger.\u201cHuh-\u201dCech exhaled heavily and finally opened his eyes.He observed his body and felt the long-lost strength. This strength was even more powerful than his former strength at his peak. He was so excited that tears filled his eyes. Before when his energy swirls were destroyed by Bazzer, he felt hopeless and thought that he was going to become a useless man, but now the light of hope shined through the dark clouds. He instantly turned around and kneeled down before Fei and said with an uncontrollable excitement on his face, \u201d Thank you, Your Majesty! I have recovered\u2026\u2026I can feel the monstrous strength in my body, and the energy channels in my body have widened by a few times. I can restore my two star warrior\u2019s energy at my peak state in less than half a year\u2026\u2026\u201dCech was so excited that his sentence structures weren\u2019t making any sense.After some rough observations, Cech had completely understood the effect of the [Hulk Potion]. Although his energy swirls didn\u2019t come back, his physical strength and his body\u2019s firmness had reached an unimaginable level. He could fight a two star warrior with pure physical strength. The effect didn\u2019t just stop there. What made him more excited was that the channels that the energy flowed through in his body was widened by a few times. This meant that when he started training his energy, his improvement speed would be faster than other ordinary warrior by a few times\u2026\u2026 The actual effect of the little [Hulk Potion] was far superior than the epic potions in the legends.Fei said calmly with a serious face, \u201d Peter, don\u2019t be so overjoyed. [Hulk Potion]\u2019s terrifying side-effect hasn\u2019t completely passed yet.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Cech and Brook who were finally relieved were surprised again when they heard that. \u201cWhat other side effects are there?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s this green light. See? The greenness on your body hasn\u2019t fully disappeared yet. According to my calculations, it needs three to five days to completely go away.\u201dCech asked with a strange face, \u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u2026eh, was the terrifying side effect that you were talking about before this greenness over my entire body after taking the [Hulk Potion]?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Fei held back his laughter and nodded firmly. \u201cThis greenness will take a long time to disappear; isn\u2019t that terrifying?\u201d But right after he said that, he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and started laughing loudly like a kid who had just pranked someone successfully. His kingly temperament instantly disappeared.Cech and Brook felt like they were about to faint.That counts as a terrifying side effect?\u201cBrook\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201d Cech was a little bit embarrassed at this point. He was originally worried about the \u201cterrifying side effect\u201d and took the potion before Brook could react; he wanted to take on the risks himself. Who knew that the king was only joking? Now, it looked like that he had jacked Brook\u2019s opportunity of becoming stronger. It didn\u2019t matter if it were merits or official titles and positions; Brook deserved it more. Cech instantly regretted his action.\u201cMr. Cech\u2026\u2026\u201d Brook was still used to calling his former leader mister. \u201d You\u2019re being too polite. If Chambord can get another powerful warrior and increase the chance of us winning the upcoming Zenit Military Practice, it doesn\u2019t matter who takes this potion.\u201d Brook\u2019s words were really sincere and didn\u2019t feel fake or superficial at all. Cech didn\u2019t know what to say. Fei on the side nodded secretly. He knew that he had chosen the right person. This one star warrior was just, dependable and had integrity. The best part of all was that he was extremely loyal to him.\u201cActually, you guys don\u2019t need to panic, hehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d As Fei was speaking, he flicked his wrist and another bottle of [Hulk Potion] appeared in his hand out of nowhere.\u201d I have a few more bottles of this potion!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: Teleport Portal in Real LifeCech and Brook were about to go crazy; both of them stared at Fei with \u201cresentment\u201d. At this moment, they finally knew that they had been pranked by the young king and everything was a friendly joke.Brook drank the other bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 in excitement.In his prior experiments, Fei had tried the potion on animals like chickens, pigs and cows, as well as on a few heinous prisoners on death row. He had accumulated a good understanding regarding the effects, dosage, side-effects and long term effects. After experiencing the indescribable pain, Brook gained a huge boost in strength. His physical strength was enough to take on a two star warrior. The energy channels in his body had also expanded. This had a more significant long term effect; it meant that Brook who was average in terms of energy training had suddenly become a genius at it.To maximize the efficiency of the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011, one would need to train. Therefore, the remaining potion was still stored in their bodies. When looking at them closely, the greenness on Brook\u2019s and Cech\u2019s skin could still be seen. They looked at each other and laughed.The king\u2019s action of continuously taking out such potions with ridiculous effects had shocked both Brook and Cech. If this information leaked out, many people would fight and start a war to get their hands on the potion. They now knew why the King talked to them in private; except for Fei\u2019s personal guard Fernando-Torres, all the other guards had been dismissed.\u201c\u3010Hulk Potion\u3011\u2019s effect is astonishing, but it doesn\u2019t accumulate, so it only works once. The effect will be minimal if you guys take it again. However, you guys shouldn\u2019t relax on your training\u2026\u2026 I do have some extra potions on hand, but there aren\u2019t a lot. They\u2019re all for the improvement of Chambord\u2019s overall strength. You two are the ones that I trust the most, as well as ones who took the \u3010Hulk Potions\u3011 first. Remember, this matter must be kept confidential and can never be exposed. For the reason of your increase in strength, think of ways to explain it yourselves\u2026\u2026 We have to be very careful on this matter. You guys know exactly why we must be.\u201dAfter their excitement, Fei returned onto his dual lion statue-clustered throne on the stairs and suddenly switched back to Paladin Mode. The holy and majestic temperament of a level 12 Paladin instantly filled the hall; the majestic sensation surged in the hall like tides. At this time, Fei had restored the King\u2019s superior prestige, controlling everything like an inviolable god.After hearing Fei\u2019s words, Brook and Cech finally knew that they were the first ones that touched the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011. Their hearts were filled with gratitude; they felt their blood boiling. Both of them kneeled down and said in unison, \u201cRest assured, Your Majesty! No one will know about this!\u201dFei nodded in satisfaction.He suddenly opened his hand and another bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 appeared in his palms. He pushed it out and the level 12 Paladin\u2019s aura wrapped around the potion and slowly flew into Brook\u2019s hand.Fei continued, \u201cWhen you get back, immediately choose two hundred loyal soldiers with clean backgrounds. Then, dilute this bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 into four barrels of clean water and feed it to the two hundred soldiers in the next three days. This way, although they won\u2019t receive the same benefit that you two received, it will still be a good boost in the soldiers\u2019 strength and physique. Remember, these two hundred soldiers will be the elite force that participates in the Zenit Imperial Military Exercise. We couldn\u2019t afford any kind of carelessness. They must be carefully selected; loyalty comes first, and ability comes second. It would be the best if all of them were born in Chambord\u2026\u2026Brook, after you finish that, hand these soldiers over to Commander Cech and let him train and direct them. I want the two of you to build an invincible iron force for Chambord in the next six months. Can you two accomplish it?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. There\u2019s absolutely no problem!\u201dBrook held onto the potion tightly as if he was holding the key to a peerless treasure. He said with full confidence, \u201cWith the help of this \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 that can compare to epic potions, we can absolutely construct an elite force of terrifying strength. Our chances of winning in the Military Exercise half a year from now will increase by a lot.\u201dEven Cech who was taciturn nodded excitedly and said, \u201cYour Majesty, Peter-Cech guarantees to build you an invincible iron force in less than six months!\u201dFei nodded.He wasn\u2019t concerned about accidents that might occur when using \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011. Before when he was testing the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011, he discovered a satisfying phenomenon \u2013 regardless of whether it was a human or an animal, after taking the full potion and enduring a few minutes of severe pain worse than death, the test subjects all had a huge boost in strength and instinctively developed a heartfelt dependency towards Fei, which made them become more loyal towards him. It was like the emotions that kids had toward their parents. After some deep thinking, Fei believed that this phenomenon was caused by the weak spiritual energy in the potion. When every \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 was created, they all contained some weak spiritual energy in them, as if they had lives and had some intimacy towards Fei, like a newborn lingering onto its mother. It seemed like that weak spiritual energy quietly affected the user of the potions\u2019 soul and increased their loyalty towards Fei.The incident of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 had come to an end. In the next ten minutes, Fei and Brook chatted about the restriction of Chambord\u2019s military. Fei wasn\u2019t some kind of military genius, so he only briefly outlined some main principles from his memories and knowledge from Earth. However, it deeply inspired Brook. During the chat, Cech also gave some great recommendations. Fei realized that this First Commander of the King\u2019s Guards was also quite talented in military affairs. During the chat, Brook happily recorded three full animal skins worth of notes. After seeing that it was getting late, Brook and Cech got up and bowed as they left the palace.Finally, only Fei and his personal guard Fernando-Torres were left in the hall.After he felt the shiny eyes staring at his back, Fei turned around and saw Torres staring at him eagerly. Fei knew what he was thinking and directly asked, \u201cFernando, do you also want a bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 to increase your strength?\u201dTorres hesitated a little; he knew that the potion was extremely valuable and limited. However, he wasn\u2019t able to resist the temptation of power and kneeled down as he answered honestly, \u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s my greatest honour to be able to follow you. I want to fight for Your Majesty, but I\u2019m too weak; I even have a hard time holding up a sword\u2026\u2026 Therefore, I beg Your Majesty to grant me a bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011.\u201d\u201cOne of the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 is yours, but I can\u2019t give it to you right now\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei gestured Torres to stand up as he continued, \u201cThe effect of this potion is significant, but the potion itself is extremely brutal. An ordinary person is not able to endure the unbearable pain during the body transformation process. If you pass out, it would damage your body severely. Both Mr. Brook and Mr. Cech are strong warriors that have fought numerous battles, and they have the basic strength and mental toughness to handle the painful process and successfully benefit from the potion. You on the other hand are still too weak and can\u2019t bear the brutal impact of the potion. If I give you the potion now, it would be a disservice\u2026\u2026If you want to quickly reach the minimum requirement to take the potion, go find Pierce and Drogba. Train with them according to the method that I gave them. Once your body becomes strong enough, I will give you the potion.\u201dAfter hearing Fei\u2019s explanation, the expression on Torres\u2019 face turned from the initial disappointment to hopefulness. He clutched his fists excitedly and said, \u201cThank you, Your Majesty. I will go find Mr. Pierce right now\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he said that, the blonde boy turned around and rushed out of the hall.Fei looked at the boy\u2019s back and laughed quietly.After his observations for the last couple of days, the blonde boy Fernando-Torres had great potential. He was clever, thoughtful, brave and honest; he had all the necessary qualities of a true warrior. He also grew up in Chambord and was loyal to the kingdom. He looked up to Fei as an idol and worshiped Fei as a god. Fei had no reason to not promote this young man.The only thing holding him back was that Torres was still too young, so Fei wanted to sharpen him a little bit more first.However, the brutal damage of the potion that Fei was talking about was true; he didn\u2019t exaggerate in the slightest. In his prior experiments, there were a total of eighteen sheep, thirty-three pigs, and numerous little animals such as chicken, ducks, and geese that had died from the potion. Even most of the heinous prisoners Oleg brought to Fei who were on death row died during the process of the body transformation. This was the dark side of the potion.Fei sat in the hall for a little bit longer and thought through everything that had happened and made sure that nothing was left out. He exhaled slowly as he switched to Barbarian Mode. After looking around and making sure that no one was around, he stared at the open space in front of him and inexplicably whispered, \u201c Elena\u2026\u2026 You can come out now!\u201dAs soon as he finished, a slight buzzing noise sounded.A small blue flash of brilliance appeared in the mid-air that grew larger and larger. Soon, it formed a huge blue oval shaped \u201cdoor\u201d. It gradually stabilized itself as blue light circulated on its surface. It was actually a portal from the Diablo World! Then, a beautiful figure slowly emerged through the portal and appeared in the King\u2019s Palace.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Numerous mystic magic symbols were engraved onto the set of delicate armour and magic power circulated on its surface. The white leather long boots covered up her knees like spreading vines. Her smooth thighs were exposed, slender and beautiful; they were as white as snow and exuded a breathtaking and seductive charm. The sky-blue battle skirt covered up her alluring round hips. Her waist was like a swinging willow; it was so slender that it could be gripped with just two hands. Her chest was still outstanding under the light leather armour. Her fabulous face made people felt guilty when they looked at her. Her temperament was three tenths apathetic, three tenths elegant and four tenths stunning\u2026\u2026This was Andelisha-Elena, a stern inviolable Valkyrie, and the prettiest \u3010Flower of Rogue\u3011 in the entire Diablo World.She quietly came through the portal as if she traveled through space and time. She appeared in the hall and stood in front of Fei.Elena\u2019s beauty had blossomed.For a long time since the last \u3010Flower of Rogue\u3011 Andariels unimaginably fell in love with the Lord of Terror Diablo and became demonified, no one on the Rogue Continuet was able to be regarded as a \u3010Flower of Rogue\u3011 until the elegant Elena was born. This young rogue warrior quickly conquered the entire Rogue Continent with her beauty and bravery.\u201cMr. Fei. I heard your summons from \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.\u201d Elena bowed and saluted Fei in the same manner that people in the Diablo World saluted their king. \u201cDo you have something for me to do?\u201d\u201cElena, you can call me Alexander from now on!\u201d Fei pointed at a stone chair beside him. He smiled as he asked, \u201cTake a seat. How did it go? I believe you\u2019ve told Priestess Akara and Leader Kashya everything about this world, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I have conveyed the information to the two leaders according to your command, Alexander Your Majesty.\u201dElena quickly got use to the name \u201cAlexander\u201d. In the last ten days or so, she had gone from the initial surprise and shock to a serene calmness; she had completely Fei\u2019s position and status in this world. When she was summoned to Zenit Continent by Fei accidently through the portal ten days ago or so, Elena was shocked by the quietness and beauty of this world. There weren\u2019t any monsters or demons, and there weren\u2019t invasions and pollution from the evil powers from hell. There were only clean air, fresh water, lush plants and healthy green mountains. Everything here was thriving and flourishing; there was literally no difference between this place and the heaven that everyone was talking about in the Diablo World. Elena fell in love this world at first sight.In the last ten days, she was able to come to Chambord Castle for four hours everyday and observe and study everything in Chambord as a guest under Fei\u2019s permission. This included the rules of this world, Fei\u2019s identify, Chambord\u2019s status and rotation between day and night from the sun and moon. After she understood everything, with Fei\u2019s permission, Elena passed on all her knowledge to the two leaders at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 Akara and Kashya.\u201cEh, good. Thank you for your hard work. Oh, right, later someone will bring you to a place. Please observe that place carefully and tell me your discoveries.\u201d Fei didn\u2019t behave like a king in front of Elena at all. He casually handed her a big red apple and smiled, \u201cSo have Leader Akara and Kashya made any decisions yet about my prior proposals?\u201d\u201cThey both have agreed. However, Leader Akara hopes Chambord could help out \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 a little bit in terms of food.\u201d Elena was surprised; she quickly took the apple as a trace of redness appeared on her white face; she lowered her head and replied.\u201cOh, food? \u2026\u2026I can only give it a try and see if I can convert food into the Diablo World.\u201d Fei thought about it and said, \u201cOn this matter, I will discuss it with them personally later.\u201dAt this moment, the guards outside of the palace shouted to inform Fei that Warden Oleg had arrived and was waiting outside.\u201cLet him in!\u201dAs soon as he finished, Warden Oleg rushed in excitedly. His face was red and all the fat on his face were shivering, as if something great had happened. He humbly kneeled down and crawled a few more steps forward until he reached Fei. He bowed to the floor to salute Fei as he smiled and fawned, \u201cI\u2019m here to report back to Your Majesty, great news, Hahaha, the new prison has officially been completely, and it\u2019s ready to be used immediately!\u201dAs he was talking, he quickly noticed Elena who was sitting on the side. His heart was instantly shocked by the beauty of this \u3010Flower of Rogue\u3011, however, Oleg didn\u2019t have any evil and lustful intents. For one, he clearly knew that this girl was very likely having an intimate relationship with King Alexander; he could tell from the way that she was looking at His Majesty. Also, Oleg was at least an one star warrior; he vividly felt Elena\u2019s powerful level that was far greater than one star rank. He also understood the value of her full magic engraved armour\u2026\u2026All of these things clearly told Oleg to kill any kinds of dirty thoughts. He couldn\u2019t offend the girl in front of him, otherwise he would die painfully.After hearing Oleg\u2019s report, Fei nodded in satisfaction and said, \u201cGreat, you\u2019ve done a good job. I\u2019m glad. Now organize some jailors and transfer all the prisoners from Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon to the new prison. From today onwards, completely seal up the water dungeon. No one is allowed to enter without my permission.\u201d\u201cYour command is my life, Your Majesty!\u201d Oleg was excited to receive Fei\u2019s praise. He spoke loudly to announce his loyalty.\u201cEh, one more thing. This Ms. Elena is my\u2026\u2026friend.\u201d Fei was about to use the word \u201ctrusted subordinate\u201d or \u201cconfidant\u201d, but he felt the word \u201cfriend\u201d was more suitable. He continued, \u201cAfter you finish transferring the prisoners, lead Elena to the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon for a visit. Remember, don\u2019t ask any questions. Come back to the Palace by yourself after she finishes. I have some great rewards to give to you.\u201d\u201cGod bless you, bright and merciful King.\u201d Oleg\u2019s teeth were about to break due to excitement after he heard that there were rewards. After meeting with the King more often, he had an even deeper understanding of Fei\u2019s character. Once Fei said that there were great rewards, that meant that the rewards must be good stuff. Then, another series of flatters \u201cshowered\u201d Fei.\u201cElena, just follow him. That place is a bit strange. You might find something, but there is a huge black iron gate. Don\u2019t go behind there for now, alright?\u201dElena stood up, nodded, and followed Warden Oleg out of the King\u2019s Palace.After seeing both of them disappear from the gates of the hall, Fei licked his lips and rubbed his temples. There were too many things to do these days. Although he was acting like a hands off king that passed on the majority of tasks onto Brook and Bast, he was still extremely busy and didn\u2019t have time to breathe.There was a light bluegrass fragrance still in the air. It was left by Elena when she was sitting down.The golden sunlight passed by the huge stone god statues and shined into the palace. Fei showered in the sunlight, closed his eyes and smelled the wonderful fragrance. His thoughts and thinking patterns suddenly became fluent and cheerful as ever, and his memory traced back to twelve days ago.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Twelve days ago.After Fei designed ten sets of male and female clothes and \u201cscared away\u201d his cute fianc\u00e9e with a design of bras, he had nothing to do. Therefore, he tried to communicate with the cold, mysterious voice in his mind and return back to Diablo World.Diablo World, \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.As soon as he stepped onto \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, he was surrounded by crazy cheers around him. He looked around and was surprised to find out that Priestess Akara and Military Leader Kashya led everyone at the camp to kneel down and devoutly pray before the place where he left the Diablo World last time. When they saw his appearance, everyone jumped up and started cheering unstoppably.\u201cMr. Fei, you have finally returned!\u201dA smile appeared Akara\u2019s old face like a dandelion flower, while Kashya and the other people also stared at Fei in excitement. Expressions of respect and admiration were on everyone\u2019s face. Fei rarely saw those expressions from the NPCs.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026What happened?\u201dFei wasn\u2019t use to the NPCs\u2019 enthusiasm. This rare situation made Fei feel like these people wanted something from him.\u201cMr. Fei. You have killed the evil demon leader Andariels and opened up the path from Rogue Continent to the east. According to the Blood Oath of Covenant from our ancestors, you are now the Supreme Leader\u2026\u2026\u201d Elena who was standing beside him notified him quietly.\u201cI\u2019m now the Supreme Leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011?\u201dFei stunned. He suddenly remembered that. When he was leaving Diablo World last time, Elena didn\u2019t mention that to him. He turned around and looked at Akara, Kashya and others, and didn\u2019t try to hide his delight, \u201cIt that true? Am I now really the supreme leader of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Although Akara wanted to beat his face with the bottom of her shoe after seeing his \u201cinsolent\u201d and shameless expression, the matter related to the Covenant from their ancestors, so she couldn\u2019t be disobedient. She had to reply patiently.People such as Kashya and Charsi also nodded to confirm.\u201cHaha, does that mean that I don\u2019t have pay anything to Akara for potions and scrolls, or to Kashya for hiring mercenaries, or to Charsi for buying equipment and items? Hahahahah\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei\u2019s laugh was very shameless; it was almost his nature. This treacherous and shameless idea popped into his head almost instantly after he knew he was now the supreme leader.A great life was waving its \u201chands\u201d at Fei coquettishly, as if it was so close. Fei could also smell it.However \u2013\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Even with the Covenant from our ancestors, the supreme leader couldn\u2019t get everything for free in the camp\u2026\u2026 Mr. Fei, I have to notify you that as the supreme leader, you do have the power to drive everyone in the camp to service you, and you also have the power to constrain everyone. However, you also have the obligation to protect and fight for everyone, every building, every cow, even every chicken. I have told you a long time ago that everything in this world is balanced\u2026\u2026 Of course, to show respect to the supreme leader, from today on, you can purchase from anyone at half price, including my potions and scrolls.\u201d \u201cGreedy\u201d Akara said as she gnashed her teeth. Her words shattered Fei\u2019s dream of getting everything for free.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026Half Price?\u201d Fei rubbed his chin in disappointment. He had no choice but to nod and say, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s still expensive, half price is a great deal.\u201d\u201cHonourable Fei. We are planning to open the pledge altar from our ancestors. After the altar ritual, you will officially become the Supreme Leader at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011\u2026\u2026 The white bearded Cain separated the crowd and saluted Fei with a cane in the hand, \u201cAccording to the legends on Rogue Continent, every supreme leader can acquire three legendary miraculous skills from the Great God. The timing is perfect, let\u2019s start the altar ritual quickly!\u201dFei realized that everything in the Diablo World was going towards an unknown direction.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: Ancestor\u2019s Altar and Three Legendary Miraculous SkillsWhat surprised Fei was that the altar from the ancestors of the camp was not in an obvious location in \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011. Under Akara\u2019s lead, Fei and other locals arrived at her small tent that was located on the southwest corner of the camp.Fei had been here numerous times.Cracked and broken bottles and jars that had moss and vines growing on them were laying around everywhere. The air close to the tent smelled pungent; it was the smell of incomplete potions. Akara\u2019s tent was very small; it was even a little ragged. Fei had questioned how this small tent could accommodate one person more than once, even if that person was someone small and thin like Priestess Akara.However, this time he was stunned.Fei\u2019s mouth opened wide after he saw Akara, Kashya and Cain bending their backs and walking into the tent one by one. He was extremely curious, \u201cIs there a secret underground cave in the tent? If not, how could the small tent fit so many people?\u201d Soon, almost everyone at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 had went into the tent, and Fei\u2019s mouth opened to its max.Elena poked Fei with her cold little hand, \u201cMister, we should go in now.\u201dFei had to go in there; he was even planning to crawl in if there wasn\u2019t enough space\u2026\u2026 However, after he bent his back, entered the tent and looked up, he was extremely shocked. How could someone call this place a tent? It was definitely a magnificent grand palace. There was an open view; Fei was now in a huge hall, and a long corridor that Fei couldn\u2019t even see the end of was connected to it. Chairs and tables were set up orderly in the hall, and there were a lot of doors along both sides of corridor; Fei\u2019s couldn\u2019t count how many room there were.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026this is\u2026\u2026spatial magic?\u201dAfter the short moment of shock, Fei quickly understood what was going on. It was crazy; Akara\u2019s ragged tent was the entrance to an unrivaled huge space. Through this small tent, Fei entered a space that he never seen before.But after some deep thinking, it was only normal for \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 to have such a mysterious place. After all, the camp had existed for more than millions of years. It was even here when the war millions of years ago between heaven and hell had begun. After the accumulation throughout history, if the camp was as shabby as it seemed and only had that little power and means, then the camp would\u2019ve been razed to the ground by the demons and monsters on the moor; there was no reason why \u3010Blood Raven\u3011, \u3010The Smith\u3011, \u3010Griswald\u3011 and the final boss \u3010Andariels\u3011 couldn\u2019t wipe out this place.There was only one reason why this camp could survive throughout the wars, battles and historical events \u2013 power.It was obvious that \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 had an unknown power that Fei didn\u2019t know about.As everyone walked further into the palace, they all passed a hall that looked like it was for meeting. Fei still couldn\u2019t see the end of the corridor. Akara and Kashya were at the very front of the crowd; they were walking extremely slowly and Fei wanted to catch up. But at this moment, something strange occurred. He unbelievably found out that the faster he ran, the longer the distance between him and Akara and Kashya got. Soon, he could only see Akara\u2019s vague figure.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dFei was perplexed.\u201cMr. Fei, the time and space in this place is reversed\u2026\u2026The slower you go, the longer the actual distance you will travel. You don\u2019t have to walk so fast.\u201d Elena was always beside Fei as she whispered to remind him.Fei was surprised, but he finally understood the secret to this space.Fei gave Elena a thankful smile and started to walk slowly.He found that he was actually going faster than when he was running. Although he was only taking small steps, the doors and rooms were passing him by like wind; he felt like he was walking on a fast moving conveyor belt going in the same direction. Fei slowed his steps down even further as if he was moving at a snail\u2019s pace, but under the rules of this mysterious space, he moved even faster. In an eye blink, Fei had magically caught up to Priestess Akara who was walking slowly and leading everyone at the front.\u201cWow, such a magical space\u2026\u2026Hehehe, where are we going?\u201d Fei tried to start a conversation.\u201cAncestor\u2019s altar.\u201d the Priestess\u2019 response was concise.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026how far do we still have to go?\u201d\u201cWe have arrived.\u201dAkara paused her steps as she said.Fei looked ahead and his weak little heart was shocked again.At the end of the corridor, a huge and wide mysterious space appeared out of nowhere. A thirty or fourty yard (m) tall altar made from black stone stood quietly in the middle of the space like a skyscraper.The diameter of this altar was longer than fifty yards (m), and it was layered with an unknown black stone. There were a total of nine levels, the further up the level, the smaller the space; it almost looked like a black wedding cake. There were a thin set of stairs on four sides of the altar that led to the highest ninth level; only about four or five people could fit on the ninth level. Looking at the altar from afar, stones on every level were fully engraved with mysterious and profound magic patterns and symbols. They looked like spreading vines and words of an unknown language. Except for the magic patterns, there were also countless ancient paintings. The content was all different; there were hideous demons, howling monsters, battling warrior and chanting mages.The entire altar was black. It stood in the space quietly and created an ancient feeling around it, as if it was silently telling the mysterious history that was buried in the dust of time, but also as if it was showing the ruthlessness and terrifying nature of time. Fei could clearly feel a hint of mythical pressure emitted by the altar and filling the entire space.\u201cThis is our ancestors\u2019 Covenant Altar.\u201d Priestess Akara said with a rare solemn expression on her face; it had a bit of holiness, as if the altar was the shrine in her heart. She said to Fei, \u201cAfter you climb up the altar through the stairways on the east and reach the ninth level, by praying devoutly, God will gift you three miraculous abilities. Go ahead, Mr. Fei.After she said that, she and other residents of \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 kneeled to the ground and started singing a song in a mysterious and ancient language very deeply. A holy natural atmosphere surrounded everyone; visible holy energy emerged from their bodies and slowly injected itself into the black altar like meteors, dragging out a long tail behind them.Fei walked up the altar step by step on the thin stone stairway that was located on the east side.When he finally arrived on the ninth level, the black altar under his feet seemed like it had finally absorbed enough holy energy coming from the rogues\u2019 bodies, and gradually new changes occurred. From the very bottom level of the altar, every level started to rotate and turn under a strange inexplicable pattern\uff0c as if it was a precise instrument that was calibrating to match a mysterious waveform.The sensation of ancient atmosphere emerged again and it was even stronger this time.Fei forced himself to endure the huge shock and watched everything that was happening calmly.All the things happening in front of him were completely beyond his imagination. These incidents never occurred in Fei\u2019s most familiar game on Earth. At this moment, some things were developing in a direction that was outside of Fei\u2019s memories.Suddenly-\u201cBoom!\u201dAn earth shattering noise sounded, and the black altar under Fei\u2019s feet finally stopped turning.Everything in Fei\u2019s sight changed, as if the altar was teleported somewhere else. People like Akara who were beside the altar had all disappeared; it was as if the entire altar had moved to the space among the stars by someone who had unlimited powers. Fei looked around and found bright stars everywhere. There were no directions of north, east, south, west, or up or down. Fei felt like he was in a cosmic vacuum.Before Fei could be surprised\u2026\u2026Suddenly, a beam of white light shined out of nowhere and covered his entire body. It felt similar to the beam that shined on him when he leveled up, but the power and pressure of this beam was far greater than the white beam of light he experienced when he was leveling up. For a moment, all of Fei\u2019s senses went black, and only a cold and majestic voice echoed in his mind \u2013\u201cSupreme God, endless years, infinite space, time of eternity\u2026\u2026 According to the Blood Oath of Covenant from the Rogue\u2019s ancestors, weak human Fei, you have killed Anderial, one of the four gurus from hell, and you shall receive three miraculous skills from the mighty gods. These three miraculous skills are \u2013 \u3010Learn\u3011, \u3010Give\u3011, and \u3010Summon\u3011! \u2026\u2026 Human, prepare to accept the gift from the gods!\u201dAs soon as the cold majestic voice finished, the white beam of light started to surge and wash Fei\u2019s body over and over again. This process was like being anesthetized during a surgery; Fei didn\u2019t feel any pain or itch, but he could clearly feel the incredible changes undergoing in every single cell in his body\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Below the altar.\u201cMs. Akara\u2026\u2026 He\u2026\u2026could there be any accidents? Three hours had passed by already\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing the huge altar completely buried in the milky white light sphere, anxious and worrying expressions appeared on Elena\u2019s face; she couldn\u2019t help but ask the spiritual leader of the camp impatiently.\u201cElena my child, don\u2019t worry\u2026\u2026This is our ancestors\u2019 and god\u2019s decree.\u201dAkara looked at the \u3010Flower of Rogue\u3011 who was a little restless beside her and a smile came on her face. She comforted Elena with a kind expression that Fei never saw before, \u201cIn the legends on the Rogue Continent, every \u3010Flower of Rogue\u3011 would encounter the man who would change her life forever. Anderial met Diablo and you met Fei. This is what the Wheel of Fortune had already prepared for you guys. Elena my child, I can foresee your future, you all\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBoom!!\u201dAs Akara was speaking, loud noises sounded beside her ear. She paused and looked in the direction the noise came from with everyone else. The white light flame sphere that embedded the altar was slowly disappearing. They could finally see everything on the altar again. On top of the thin stairways, Fei who just finished the whole ritual was coming down step by step.An excited expression appeared on Elena\u2019s face as she rushed towards Fei. After observing Fei carefully and making sure that Fei was unscathed, her fast beating heart finally slowed down and she sighed in relief. A faint smile also popped on her white, smooth and spotless face.\u201cI\u2019m alright, relax.\u201dFei felt the girl\u2019s worry and laughed as he held on and squeezed her cold little hand.Elena was extremely embarrassed. She blushed as she struggled to escape from Fei\u2019s big hand and quickly lowered her head and returned to the crowd.\u2026\u2026After taking the same route back out of Akara\u2019s magical space tent, there was only about less than half an hour of gaming time left for today. Fei didn\u2019t rush out of the camp onto the moor to kill more monsters. Instead, he stayed at the camp and chatted with Akara, Kashya, the two leaders at the camp and the white bearded \u201cobscene\u201d old man Cain.No one knew that they talked about and no one knew what kind of three miraculous skills Fei had acquired. More or less, when Fei left the Diablo World again, the residents of the camp saw an unprecedented relieved expression on Ms. Akara\u2019s face.Alright that\u2019s the 3 regular from last week.

    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: Miraculous Skill -\u3010Summon\u3011On the same day that Fei exited the Diablo World, he found out that both Angela and Emma had been invited by Princess Tanasha to her place to hang out again. He felt that this eldest princess of Zenit Empire was quite interesting. She never showed herself in Chambord since her arrival. Even when Fei executed a few cavalries of Zenit and the deputy captain of the Royal Canonization Legion, she didn\u2019t appear or say anything. As the commander of the Royal Canonization Legion, she didn\u2019t ask Fei to meet up with her or voluntarily come to him. As if she was on a vacation, instead of getting ready to formally crown Fei as the king of Chambord, she didn\u2019t mention the canonization at all and instead wanted to get closer to the future queen Angela. She frequently sent her servants to invite Angela to her place to hang out.Fei didn\u2019t bother to stop here. He wasn\u2019t afraid that the elder princess might take Angela hostage; it was his vague instinct. At least for now, this princess of Zenit\u2019s attitude towards Chambord was safe.Fei was currently very busy. Extremely busy.Fei had two short term goals. One was to increase his strength, and the other was to increase Chambord\u2019s strength. He could achieve the first goal by going to the Diablo World, and he could use the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 to achieve his second goal.The only thing disappointing thing was that Fei\u2019s success rate of finding \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 was way too low; it was less than four percent. Also, it was only effective for people who had the required strength. For example, Cech and Brook who were star ranked warriors were able to obtain the strength boost from the potion, but people who were weaker, like the thin and tall mercenary in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon could benefit from the potion too. However, if an ordinary man like the old handsome Bast took the potion, he would burst into pieces within tens of seconds after taking it. Ordinary people couldn\u2019t handle the pain of the body transformation; it would feel like their internal organs and muscles were being torn apart.What Fei experienced when he just entered the Diablo World was unprecedented. The so called Ancestors\u2019 Blood Oath of Covenant, the mysterious space inside Akara\u2019s tent and the black altar had never appeared in Fei\u2019s memory about the Diablo Game on Earth. From that point on, everything in the Diablo World seemed to deviate from his prior gaming experience. It even made Fei question whether killing monsters and leveling up in the Diablo World was really a game, or if it was something else with the game as a cover\u2026\u2026Fei was thinking about the three miraculous skills \u2013 \u3010Learn\u3011, \u3010Give\u3011 and \u3010Summon\u3011 the whole night.When Fei acquired the three miraculous skills on the black altar in Diablo World, he didn\u2019t know how to use them right away. In other words, when Fei was embedded in the mysterious white light beam on the altar, except for cleansing his body and increasing his strength and firmness, Fei didn\u2019t have any substantial gains. The cold and mysterious voice only told Fei that he needed to discover the casting method and effects on his own in the future. It would purely depend on his intelligence and luck. He could possibly get them right away, or he might not be able to get them until the end of his life.\u201cDamn, this irresponsible answer is too crappy.\u201d Fei thought.After a night and nothing gained, Fei started to question the authenticity of the three miraculous skills; the ancestors of rogue encampment might have put them out to motivate their descendants. However, at dawn of the next day, something miraculous happened \u2013 Fei accidentally triggered the miraculous skill \u3010Summon\u3011- he actually opened up a portal and summon mercenary Frost Archer Elena from the Diablo World into the real world.He was ecstatic at that moment. Fei was in a complete shock.It wasn\u2019t only because he triggered \u3010Summon\u3011, but it was more because\u2026\u2026 The sun hadn\u2019t risen yet, so the people in the Diablo World hadn\u2019t gotten up yet. Therefore, when Elena was summoned to him through the portal, she wasn\u2019t wearing much clothing. He had gotten a great view of her body; the round arcs sketched out one out the most beautiful sceneries in the world. With the slightly messy hair and the sleepy expression on her beautiful face, Fei was almost turned to stone and his nose almost started shooting out blood.Elena on the other side obviously didn\u2019t fully wake up yet and was half-asleep. A few seconds later, the archer beauty finally realized the situation she was in. She screamed and covered up her chests with her arms, stared at Fei \u201cangrily\u201d for a second, and rushed back to the Diablo World before the portal in the King\u2019s Palace could close. After he got himself together from the brief shock from this \u201cpeerless beauty\u201d, Fei quickly started to try to remember his actions and words before triggering \u3010Summon\u3011 again. After tracing back, he eventually skeptically determined one thing \u2013 about a few seconds ago, he subconsciously murmured \u201cIf only Elena was here, maybe she could help me figure this out\u2026\u2026\u201d Then, the miracle occurred. A blue oval portal appeared after a light buzzing noise, similar to when he used a \u3010Town Portal Scroll\u3011. Then, the almost naked Elena appeared after that.Fei figured out the key to successfully casting it and excitedly tried several times.Sure enough, after about twenty seconds, he managed to open the portal and summon Elena from the Diablo World again. Fei was only a bit disappointed because this time Elena was definitely prepared \u2013 she was fully dressed and armoured, and travelled through the portal and appeared in front of Fei.Fei was stoked after this success.He then tried to summon everyone in the camp including priestess Akara, military leader Kashya and blacksmith Charsi\u2026\u2026 however, Fei was surprised to find out that he wasn\u2019t able to summon anyone except for Elena from \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 to the real world. The specific reason was unknown.After a full day of trial and error, he came to the conclusion \u2013 due to some unknown reason, the miraculous skill \u3010Summon\u3011 was only able to summon Elena, and the process and method of summoning was quite simple \u2013 if Fei wanted, he could open up a blue oval portal in mid air and summon Elena from the Diablo World to the real world.Of course, restrictions applied.First of all, \u3010Summon\u3011 was only available under Barbarian Mode. Next, \u3010Summon\u3011 would consume mana. With the mana of a level 16 Barbarian, Fei could only summon Elena three times. After that, he had to drink a \u3010Mana Potion\u3011 before summoning her a fourth time.Like that, an unconscious behaviour by chance had revealed a portion of the thin veil covering the miraculous skill \u3010Summon\u3011. Fei guessed that \u3010Summon\u3011 was ranked as a miraculous skill, so it must be able to summon more than just Elena. Logically speaking, people such as Akara and Kashya in the camp could be summoned as well, but for whatever reason, he wasn\u2019t able to do so.Except for \u3010Summon\u3011, the other two miraculous skills \u3010Learn\u3011 and \u3010Give\u3011 he had acquired on the black altar still had no desire to reveal their inner secrets to him. After Fei spent more than ten days trying to figure them out, he still got nothing out of it. There weren\u2019t any clues, so he didn\u2019t know what to do.However, Fei didn\u2019t panic.Being able to summon Elena to the real world was already a pleasant surprise for Fei.Elena was a level 14 Magic Archer and equal to a three star warrior on Azeroth Continent. To Chambord, this was an addition of a strong master that could easily tilt the balance on the scale of victory. In the Military Exercise half a year from now, because of Elena\u2019s existence, Feicould almost guarantee another win in the six individual competitions. There was about half a year left after all; in this time, Elena\u2019s strength could increase significantly after fighting and leveling up alongside Fei in the Diablo World.In the next couple days, Fei summoned Elena to Chambord Kingdom. Although there was a time limit of four hours a day, it didn\u2019t stop the beauty mercenary from observing and merging into the real world like an extremely thirsty traveler finding a lake and drinking the water in a desert. In Elena\u2019s eyes, the quiet and beautiful Chambord was no different from the heaven described in the rogue ancestors\u2019 tales. When she stepped into Chambord Kingdom and peaked out the window for the first time, she fell in love with it.\u201cThis is a beautiful paradise\u2026\u2026Mr. Fei, if I have to, I\u2019m willing to bleed and die for this land, just like how I fought for \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.\u201d Elena showered in the sunlight of Chambord\u2019s sunset, as she said to Fei with a smile on her face.Fei nodded.He felt the same way as Elena; he fell in love and was deeply obsessed with this beautiful and peaceful land.In the following days, Elena merged into Chambord Kingdom at an astonishing speed.The only difference was that Elena didn\u2019t show herself to anyone in Chambord except for Fei. Even when she saw the pure, crystal-like girl Angela and knew that she was Fei\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; she simply suppressed her own sudden dejection and hid herself\u2026\u2026 Until about thirty minutes ago, no one knew that a hot magic archer that had the same strength as a three star warrior had appeared in Chambord.Currently in the King\u2019s Palace, Warden Oleg was the first Chambordian that knew of Elena\u2019s existence. It could even be said that he was the first Azerothian that knew of her existence.\u201cAlthough this f*cker is a flatterer and is afraid of death, his luck seems to be better than everyone else\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d Fei thought about Oleg and felt a bit strange. Fei finally knew why the emperors in the ancient times would use corrupted and eloquent ministers and officers even though they knew their characters\u2026\u2026For some reason, Fei felt safer to use \u201ccorrupted and eloquent ministers and officers\u201d like Oleg to complete some tasks compared to people like Brook.Fei sat in the Executive Hall in the King\u2019s Palace for a little while and suddenly remembered that Elena mentioned \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 needing some food suplies. He ordered a guard to gather some winter wheat seeds and put them into his Barbarian\u2019s storage belt. After calculating the time and knowing that it would take a while for Oleg and Elena to get back from the underground maze at the back of Chambord, he dismissed the guards and used some mana to open up a portal in the King\u2019s Palace, and then he stepped into it\u2026\u2026When Fei\u2019s figured disappeared in the blue oval light portal, the entire portal suddenly disappeared; there weren\u2019t any magic fluctuations left in the room. It was like a bursting bubble, leaving no traces behind.In the next second, Fei arrived at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 through the portal.This was the \u201cby-product\u201d of one of three miraculous skills \u2013 \u3010Summon\u3011 when it was first triggered by Fei. If he wanted to enter the Diablo World from that point on, he didn\u2019t have to communicate with the cold and mysterious voice in his head. All he had to do was use some mana and open up a portal to the Diablo World and walk through it. Before, he could only enter the Diablo World with his mind in his sleep and kill monsters to level up, but now he could enter Diablo World with his physical body.The first thing he did when he entered Diablo World was not meet up with Akara and Kashya, but rather open up his Barbarian\u2019s storage belt and glance through it. He was stoked; he found out that the small bag of winter wheat seeds he had put in the storage belt hadn\u2019t disappeared.That meant \u2013\u201cI can actually bring items from the real world into the Diablo World!\u201dThis discovery excited Fei. It meant that this didn\u2019t only apply to the small bag of seeds.He could bring any important items with him from the real world into the Diablo World.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 81.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81.1: \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011After confirming this finding, Fei quickly started thinking in his mind.He was considering how to share resources between the Diablo World and the real world. Although Fei wasn\u2019t sure if there was anything else that could help him bring a lot more resources from the real world to the Diablo World aside from the storage belt, obviously this small pack of winter wheat had opened a bright window that Fei had never thought about before in his chaotic mind.As he was thinking, Fei walked towards Akara\u2019s small tent.He found Akara busy composing all kinds of potions in front of the seemingly ragged tent that had a magnificent interior. He took out the pack of winter wheat out of the storage belt and gave it to Akara.\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201dAkara took the small pack and an unbelievable, surprised expression appeared on her face.It was incredible; she could feel a thick life energy inside the small cloth pack. Akara was both familiar and unfamiliar with this sensation. It was very deep and distant in her memory.Long, long ago, \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 didn\u2019t plant their own crops to maintain their survival. However, in the past sixty years, along with the slow passage of time and pollution and corrosion of rogue continent by Diablo\u2019s evil hell force, the majority of crops and plants were damaged by the dark force. Seeds with this purity and amount of life energy in them were extremely rare to find. That caused the production of crops and food in the camp to lower and lower, and ultimately they stopped producing crops. For a long time, the residents in the camp had to rely on breeding some chicken, ducks, cattle, and some other poultry and a type of wild plants called Bracken Roots that couldn\u2019t be massively planted to struggle to survive.Akara clearly felt that the small pack of winter wheat seeds that Fei brought weren\u2019t polluted by the evil force at all and could be successfully planted and grow well in the Diablo World. Due to the quality of the soil in the Diablo World, the quantity of production might be lower compared to normal\u2026\u2026 but compared to letting young rogues go into the dangerous moor which was dominated by monsters and demons and find those Bracken Roots that tasted very bad, even though the production would be low, it would still be a great light and a huge hope for \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011.\u201cIn my world, this crop is called winter wheat. It has a strong vitality and is ideal to be grown on Rogue Continent where it is cold and humid\u2026\u2026 Akara, you can ask people to try to plant it in small quantities first. If it is successful, I will bring more seeds to you and it can perhaps ease the food crisis that is happening at the camp currently.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s awesome\u2026\u2026 Thank you so much, Mr. Fei. I can feel the purity and liveliness from these seeds. You have brought hope of survival to the camp.\u201d Priestess Akara changed her usual profiteering face and solemnly bowed to show her thanks.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026You don\u2019t have to thank me. Hehehe, if you could provide me with some free potions, items or scrolls, perhaps it would better than thanking me with words.\u201d Fei put on a \u201cfake\u201d friendly smile.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dInstantly, Akara\u2019s profiteering character returned. Mr. Fei, as a leader you should be setting examples for everyone in the camp; you absolutely can\u2019t get stuff for free without doing any work. Plus, the number of potions and items I can make are extremely limited. It can barely provide the rogues in the camp with the necessary protection. Mr. Fei, your demand is too much. Even if I produce free potions for you every minute, it wouldn\u2019t be enough for you.\u201dFei was silent.A greedy profiteer would always be a greedy profiteer.But then again, what Akara said really was the case.Fei extinguished his idea of getting stuff for free. He turned around and saw the bottles and jars that Akara was using to make potions and smelled the pungent air. He suddenly thought of something and smiled as he asked, \u201cAkara, why didn\u2019t you find a helper to assist you in making potions? That way, you could increase the production, hehehe!\u201d\u201cDo you think I could configure the potion out of thin air? Every potion takes a ton of precious and rare raw materials and herbs. They don\u2019t grow in the camp and can only be found in places such as the moors and other extremely dangerous places. To collect and harvest these herbs and materials, the rogues can only go to those extremely dangerous and evil places when Diablo\u2019s powers on Rogue Continent is at the \u201clow tide\u201d. I\u2019m not exaggerating. Every potion I make is saturated with the blood of the poor children\u2026\u2026\u201d Akara was suddenly saddened when she spoke of this.Fei smiled as he pointed at himself with his thumb and said, \u201cHehehe, Akara, don\u2019t you think you have a perfect candidate standing in front of you for that job? Hehe, perhaps I could help you collect and pick these herbs and materials. In return, my request is very simple. You only have to teach me the names of each herb, how to identify them, and the formulae for making the potions. Hehehe.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dAkara raised her eyebrows and was instinctively about to bicker with Fei, but she suddenly realized something as her eyes shined. She observed Fei closely as she glanced through Fei\u2019s body and felt a suddenly realization. \u201cHehe, you are absolutely right. Come here. Hehehe, let\u2019s start now. Hahaha, let me tell you how to identify each raw herb ingredient, their rating and their level!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cZealand Grass, Lantern Core, White-Strange Leaves, Magic-Chaos Ratten, Star-Light Grass, White-Bone Vine\u2026\u2026 Eh, no, no. Blood-Bone Vine\u2026\u2026 What else? Fire Roots? Poisonous Spiders\u2019 joint bone?\u201dAfter an hour.Fei was contaminated with a pungent herb smell. He continuously spat out something from his mouth as he stumbled and fled from Akara\u2019s mysterious small tent. He was murmuring a series of herb names. His distracted expression looked as if he had been severely ravaged by a Tyrannosaurus.\u201cHey\u2026\u2026Mr. Fei. Don\u2019t run. I have forty other raw materials and herbs for you to taste. Relax, these herbs aren\u2019t bitter like the other ones. They don\u2019t taste bad\u2026\u2026\u201d Akara had a reluctant and gloating smile on her face as she yelled and waved her hand at Fei.Fei didn\u2019t dare say a word back; he just continued to flee.He passed a few wooden fences and several tents as he spat a few more times to get rid of all the bitter herb debris in his mouth. He then suddenly remembered something else; he walked to the centre of the camp and found the old man Cain, the \u201cFree human scroll identifier\u201d. He took out a few armour pieces and a silver storage ring from his storage belt and gave them to Cain. \u201cWise Cain, these items are from a mysterious place. I\u2019m not sure if you could identify them for me.\u201dIn fact, these pieces of armour were picked by Fei from the silver masked knight\u2019s corpse, and the silver storage ring was from the poor four star mage Elvis. Fei put those stuff in his Barbarian storage belt before; when he was taking out the small pack of winter wheat seeds, he saw them as well. However, the status on the items were unidentified, therefore Fei wanted old Cain to help him identify them. Perhaps once Cain finished identifying them, he could ask blacksmith Charsi to modify them so that no one in the real world would recognize them again.\u201cHuh? These items are very strange\u2026.. Eh\u2026\u2026 Weird, I have never seen anything like this before\u2026\u2026 Let me take a closer look\u2026\u2026 God! These are completely different magic engravings and patterns, and unheard of enchantment methods\u2026\u2026\u201d The white-bearded old man took the items from Fei\u2019s hands and took a detailed look. Quickly, he was fascinated by them, just like an old archeologist that just saw an ancient treasure. He was stunned a little bit; he didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge Fei anymore and just said, \u201cThe identification process might take a while. Come back in three days\u2026\u2026\u201d Then he turned around and walked away as if he was holding his baby.\u201cDamn, if you can\u2019t identify the items, just tell me. What\u2019s the meaning of the excuse\u2026\u2026\u201dFei opened his mouth as he \u201cscornfully\u201d looked at the old \u201cobscene\u201d Cain\u2019s who was walking away and pointed out his middle finger.Since the identification didn\u2019t go as he planned, he decided to slay some monsters and demons to level up.However, this novice map \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 wasn\u2019t effective for Fei to level up in anymore. A few days ago, he swept out all the monster and demons in the entire map again and made sure that not a single monster nor a crowd of demons could threaten the safety of the camp. At this point in time, the moor was more than tens of times safer than before. With the unique Big Bosses being slayed by Fei already, \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 and its subsidiary maps weren\u2019t challenging to Fei at all.At this time, Elena was still in the real world. Fei thought about it for a while and finally decided to find NPC Warriv \u2013 the caravan leader, who was in blue. For the first time, he chose to head to the East. He decided to proceed onto the second big map in the Diablo World \u2013 a more dangerous and challenging town -\u3010Lut Gholein\u3011.\u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 was quite far from \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011. If an ordinary rogue started traveling from the camp, it would take her about a year or two to get to \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011. Fortunately for Fei, this travelling process for him was very similar to the actual game. Suddenly, the view in front of his eyes started to get foggy and blurry. Then as if he travelled through time and space, he felt and experienced the weightlessness and zero gravity. When he opened his eyes again, he had arrived at \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011.Everything around him was in a khaki color. This was a city that was located between deserts.If the prior map \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011 was a little ragged temporary camp site, then \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 was a magnificent and vast desert city. Although it didn\u2019t have the steep terrains and picturesque landscapes like Chambord, there were tall, solid defensive walls, beautiful fancy palaces, even safer inner city, two story luxury hotels and pubs, and a wide natural pier that was full of parked boats and ships\u2026\u2026 It was impossible to find all these things and structures back in Chambord.But for some reason, luxurious \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 gave Fei an extremely strange feeling \u2013 this seemed like a ghost city. There wasn\u2019t any liveliness; there were barely any pedestrians on the road, and it was absolutely silent. Wind blew up sand into the air, and despite being autumn, there seemed to be an unspeakable chill.Fortunately, there were still NPCs.As soon as Fei stepped onto \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011, a NPC approached him.After a simple routine conversation, Fei had received the first quest in \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 from Atma, the owner of a public house \u2013 Head to the sewers under Lut Gholein and kill the boss \u3010Radament\u3011 who occupied the sewers for a long time.According to his prior memory, Fei found the entrance to the underground sewers and entered it to start the quest.However, during the process of accepting the quest, Fei found something strange \u2013 It seemed like the NPCs at \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 didn\u2019t like him very much. Their facial expressions and voices were very dull and lifeless. Compared with people such as Akara back at \u3010Rogue Encampment\u3011, the difference was huge; it almost felt like he was talking to wooden dummies when he was interacting with them.\u201cWeird, why is that?\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter if it was the whole city or the NPCs in it, they all gave Fei the same feeling \u2013 that they were dead. The place was lifeless, as if it really was a ghost city.With a ton of curiosity, Fei seized the moment and started his bloody massacre of the monsters and demons in the sewers.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 81.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81.2: Little Black House\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Two hours later.Fei had cleaned out all the monster in the sewers easily with the strength of the level 20 Barbarian and killed the boss \u2013 \u3010Radament\u3011, completing the first quest in \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011. His Barbarian Character was very close to leveling up to level 21. He returned to \u3010Lut Gholein\u3011 and got his reward \u2013 one \u3010Skill Point\u3011. He thought for a while and converted some potions from the cold and mysterious voice. Then, he directly exited the Diablo World through the portal and re-appeared in King\u2019s Palace.The timing was perfect.Coincidentally, the guards on the outside yelled to report that Warden Oleg was seeking permission to enter the palace. Fei sat back down on his throne, stretched his back and said, \u201cLet him in.\u201dQuickly, Warden Oleg walked in humbly.The fat flatterer kneeled to the ground and saluted sincerely. He then smiled fawningly and said, \u201cSupreme King\u201d Alexander, all the prisoners in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon have been transferred to the new prison according to your command. Ms. Elena is still visiting Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon\u2026\u2026 Your loyal servant Oleg is here to report.\u201d\u201cEh, you did a good job, I\u2019m very satisfied,\u201d Fei smiled as he praised.\u201cAll of this is what I should do. To serve Your Majesty is my greatest honour!\u201d Warden Oleg bowed humbly. He flatteringly smiled, \u201cYour Majesty, the new prison hasn\u2019t been officially named. All your loyal subjects passionately wish for you to personally visit the new prison and give it an official name. It would be an honour for Chambord as a whole.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dFei was intrigued by what Oleg said.Due to his recent workload, he didn\u2019t have time to go to the new prison that was built and expanded on top of the old healing facility. He wasn\u2019t too sure how Oleg fixed and renovated it. In terms of naming the prison, Fei laughed as a great name appeared in his mind.\u201cThis is your reward. After taking the potion, lead me to the new prison.\u201d As he spoke, he gently pushed his palm, and half a bottle of \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 slowly flew towards Oleg. The potion shined a mysterious green light. This was the dose that Fei prepared for Oleg. It was tailored accordance with his own strength: not too much, not too little, just enough to stimulate all of the Warden\u2019s potential.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201dOleg was stunned.Not even in his wildest dreams would he have thought that King Alexander\u2019s reward was this half bottle of an unknown potion. From the faint green color, it looked like some kind of deadly poisonous potion\u2026\u2026 But at this moment, Oleg demonstrated his cleverness as he figured out the king\u2019s intentions. He didn\u2019t even ask what potion this was; without any hesitation, he put on a trusting face, opened the bottle and chugged the green potion down his throat.The next second, \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011 came into effect.An unprecedented painful sensation came from the deepest part of his body \u2013 every bit of bone marrow in his body started to heat up. Although the pain was tearing Oleg\u2019s fat body apart, what surprised Fei was that this greedy Warden who was super afraid of death gritted his teeth and endured the severe pain throughout the body transformation; he didn\u2019t even let out a single groan. Until the efficacy of the potion gradually diminished, he was covered in sweat, as if he just got out of a swimming pool. With a pale face and bite marks on his lips, he slowly recovered.Such a hard and sturdy performance surprised Fei.Unconsciously, his impression of the fat and bald warden improved quite a bit.After feeling the great increase in strength and the huge change in the energy channels in his body, Oleg who was initially scared finally knew what kind of magical potion King Alexander rewarded him with. He kneeled down, opened his mouth and wanted to compliment him. However, the words and sentences that he was so familiar with got stuck in his mouth, and for some reason he couldn\u2019t utter a word\u2026\u2026His mouth started twitching as a touching feeling bombarded his mind; he felt like crying. Oleg tried hard to hold it back, but ultimately he wasn\u2019t able to stop it and cried out loud, \u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u2026 Thank you, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026 To the God of War, Oleg\u2026\u2026 Swear with a warrior\u2019s dignity, pride and soul, that I shall stay absolutely loyal to the great King Alexander and never betray him\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026I know many people at Chambord look down on me\u2026\u2026Although Bazzer desperately wanted to draw me to his side, I could tell that in his eyes, I was only a dog that had some value\u2026\u2026Your Majesty, you have given me\u2026\u2026 dignity\u2026\u2026 dignity of a man\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201dFor a moment, Oleg was crying so hard that he couldn\u2019t even speak.This scene surprised Fei again.\u201cHuman nature is so damn hard to predict\u2026\u2026. However, hahahaha, so this flatterer Oleg has been influenced and touched by my great character? And wants to start a new life?\u201dFei didn\u2019t really acknowledge Oleg who was kneeling down faithfully and crying as he declared his loyalty. He sat on his throne, and narcissistic thoughts flooded his mind like a tsunami.\u2026\u2026After about ten minutes.Under the lead of Warden Oleg who was now very grateful, Fei arrived at the former Healing Facility on the west side of Chambord Castle.This was the new prison of Chambord that Oleg constructed.The exterior walls of the prison were made from firm white stones, with the stones piling up to four yards (m) high. Inside the wall, the original tattered healing facility had been turned into about a building with about two dozen cells. Every cell had good ventilation and light, and they were all warm, dry and comfortable to stay in. They were all sealed off by iron bars on the windows and a movable iron door. The sixty or so prisoners that were in the Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon were transferred here.The new prison looked completely white from a distance. The two dozen cells could only hold up to about two hundred prisoners; although it was significantly smaller than the water dungeon in the underground cave maze, it was enough for Chambord\u2019s use. After Fei\u2019s revamp of the prison, there weren\u2019t many prisoners left. Plus, Fei\u2019s command to reconstruct a new prison was just to deceive the public and find a reasonable excuse to completely seal up Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon containing the underground cave maze. After all, there hid a secret that could turn the entire Azeroth Continent into madness \u2013 the Mythical Ruins.Two ten yard (m) tall statues of two warriors resting their hands on swords stabbed into the ground stood in front of the gates of the new prison. The statues were vivid and looked very majestic. They weren\u2019t made by Oleg; after hearing that the King was planning to build a new prison, the citizens were overjoyed and took the initiative to donate the funds to create them. The creators of the statues named them [Pillar of Justice] and [Pillar of Repentance], symbolizing the justice of the trials and prosecution, as well as hope for the prisoners to repent.In between these two huge stone statues, there stood a big black rectangular stone. This was the place that Oleg prepared to write the prison\u2019s name. At this time, the new prison was surrounded by numerous citizens. They were all waiting and looking forward to the King officially naming this new prison that symbolized forgiveness and mercy.\u201cMy respectable subjects. I sincerely hope that not a single citizen from today onwards will end up locked behind these gates due to their choices and mistakes.\u201dFei stood in front of the huge stone and said loudly.He withdrew Oleg\u2019s sword from the scabbard that was hanging on Oleg\u2019s waist, flipped his wrist and started slashing on the stone. \u201cTink! Tink! Tink! Tink!\u201d With loud screeching noises, numerous stone chippings rustled off of the stone as many sparks emerged. Three words were deeply engraved into this extremely firm stone \u2013Little Black House!\u201cLittle Black House\u2026\u2026 Haha, this will be the name of the new prison. I promise all of you that from now on, anyone that is sent to Little Black House will be penalized and have the opportunity to repent. Their freedom may be temporarily stripped from them, but they will never lose their precious life here.\u201dFei held onto the sword as he spoke loudly.\u201cHail the king!\u201d\u201cLong live King Alexander\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMerciful King Alexander, may the God of War bless you!\u201dAlthough they didn\u2019t know what \u201cLittle Black House\u201d meant, the crowd cheered on one after another in waves.Such a scene was quite strange.Originally, building a new prison wasn\u2019t something to be celebrated by the citizens of a kingdom; after all, a prison wasn\u2019t a mall. It represented the dark and dominant ruling from the upper class\u2026\u2026But this time, due to the previous experience with the bloody cruel, hell-like Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon, the new prison had a new and special meaning to every citizen in Chambord. From today on, they at least didn\u2019t have to be timid and afraid of offending a noble or a high class citizen accidentally or negligently, and get locked up in the gloomy Iron Prison \u2013 Water Dungeon and lose their life. From what the king promised, the people had understood the underlying meaning. They once again confirmed to themselves that King Alexander was a gracious ruler.Perhaps unprecedented prosperous days would arrive in Chambord once King Alexander would formally be crowned by the Zenit Empire\u2019s Royal Canonization Legion in eight days.The crowd was cheering wildly.At this time, the Military Guru of Chambord Gordon-Brook squeezed his way past the crowd and rushed to Fei. He whispered something into Fei\u2019s ear.Fei\u2019s expression suddenly changed.\u201cFinally here?

    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82: Two Legged Bald Rattlesnake (Part Two)The body of the leading carriage was covered fully in huge Holy Church\u2019s fiery sun symbols that were gilded with gold. The huge carriage had easily attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Although it was stunning how luxurious the carriage looked, what was more surprising was that it didn\u2019t have any wheels. Two clouds of rotating and whistling grey wind took the wheels\u2019 places. The horses were able to lightly dragged the heavy body of the carriage; like a light feather that was floating in the air. When the horses were pulling the carriage, it slid smoothly through the air.It was the special magic carriage that only Holy Church had. The bottom of the carriage had a middle-level wind magic array engraved on it personally by senior priests. The magic array was powered by magic crystals, and it made the carriage look extremely mysterious and luxurious. Only senior priests had the status and eligibility to use and enjoy such a magic carriage.On both sides of the luxurious magic carriage, there were about forty novice priests that were in black vestments with marks of the Holy Church embroidered onto their red collars. They were all wearing black cloaks, and followed the carriage alongside slavishly; they were ready to serve the priest humbly.The novice priests were known as friars as well. They were half students and half servants to the priests, and was known as the humblest servants to the God. Everyone of them were burdened with a long black chain on their backs; even when they were just walking slowly, the metal chain would sway and make the tinkling, metal colliding sound. Many tinkling and colliding sounds combined together gave the bystanders an unspeakable pressure, gave them a chill to the spine and made them distance from the fleet of carriages.Holy Knights and Priests were the two pillars of strength for the Holy Church on Azeroth Continent.They were the best partners. The relationship between them somewhat was similar to warriors and mages. One specializes in short range combats, full of strength; and the other one specializes in magic and spells, long range combat, and their powers were more mysterious. In battles, they were complementary to each other. Therefore, whenever the Holy Church set up a new church in wherever, in terms of choosing delegate from the candidates, a priests and a knight would be appointed at the same time.The street was quickly \u201ccleaned up\u201d, residents of Chambord was forced to stand on both sides of the street earnestly. Any insincere or unusual movements would be considered disrespectful to Priest Zola by the cavaliers\u2019 retinues. If they get executed or killed on the spot, there won\u2019t be any place for them to complain to.The gilded magic carriage slowly travelled on the [The Road of Gold], as if it was inspecting its own subjects.People on both side of the road stared at the fleet of carriages with deep awe.Of course, there were also a bit of deeply oppressed hatred and disgust.When Chambord was under the attack by the black armoured enemies, and was in severe danger, the priests and knights from the Holy Church who could boss people around and enjoyed all the privileges at Chambord didn\u2019t hesitate at all, ditched the kingdom and ran away like homeless dogs. But as soon as the danger was eliminated, these greedy and vicious bastards couldn\u2019t wait to come back to force their own \u201cprestige\u201d and supremacy onto the people of Chambord\u2026\u2026 \u201cDoesn\u2019t the Holy Church have any shame?\u201dAs if he felt the unfriendly stares from people standing on the sides of the street, the gilded magic carriage suddenly stopped. The door opened and the black curtain behind the door was lifted. A slightly bald old man leaned forward, paused for a second, and walked out. He stood on the front footboard.This was Priest Zola.A greedy, smart, vicious and nasty guy. He wasn\u2019t tall, only about 5 feet 6. He was also thin; occasionally, terrible coldness would flash in his eyes. Someone had described Zola like this \u2013 \u201cThis little old man, he could think of more than a thousand secretive deadly tricks and traps in a blink of an eye.\u201d The people of Chambord gave him a very appropriate nickname behind his back \u2013 [Two Legged Bald Rattlesnake].This vicious rattlesnake and the bearded knight leader Luciano who lashed the poor woman with his horsewhip were the two figureheads that the Holy Church sent to Chambord. Both of them together managed everything that was related to church and the religion of Chambord Kingdom. Due to the significant status that the Holy Church had on Azeroth Continent, and the fierce name that the Inquisition Branch made for itself; there were too many kingdoms that were destroyed by the iron hoofs of the Execution Knights who dared to resist the Holy Church\u2019s order. Therefore, although these two people were little characters that were unknown inside the Holy Church, but once they arrived at Chambord Kingdom, they were the highest status people at Chambord and could rival with the king.Zola gently rubbed his beloved scepter with his palm.His gloomy eyes glanced through the people who were standing on the sides of the street. The crowd suddenly was having a little commotion; no one dared to look at this vicious rattlesnake in the eyes.Next moment, Zola causally pointed at a few people in the crowd.The people who got pointed acted as if they received the invite from the Grim Reaper; they were so scared that their faces turned white, and cried and struggled desperately\u2026\u2026 However, it didn\u2019t matter if they were crying or struggling, none of it mattered. The novice priests on the side of the magic carriage opened their eyes widely, and looked at the people that Zola\u2019s finger was pointing at. Then, like loyal hyenas that heard their master\u2019s command, the novice priest rushed out, and without considering anything else, they locked the chains in their hands onto the people\u2019s necks, and viciously pulled them out of the crowd like chickens.Cries filled the street, but once anyone resisted the \u201carrest\u201d a little bit, the dog like cavaliers\u2019 retinues would circle them as they punched and kicked the \u201carrestees\u201d. There were women who had their kids in their arms that got pulled out of the crowd, but there were more younger girls, as well as a few clean dressed middle aged men\u2026\u2026Instantly, cries resounded on the street, as if it was a living hell.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: Leave everything to me[Two Legged Bald Rattlesnake] Zola stood on the carriage and coldly watched.There weren\u2019t any traces of mercy that a holy and just priest should have. He glanced at the crowd having a slight commotion and said: \u201cThe Church had received a top secret report, not too long ago, the most evil \u2013 undead magic was used during the battle on the stone bridge in Chambord\u2026\u2026 I suspect that these people had been allured by demons, because I feel slight traces of undead magic among them\u2026\u2026 God\u2019s children, don\u2019t try to doubt father\u2019s fairness\u2026\u2026 I promise to you people that the church will make the most just and fair ruling. As soon as we find out that they didn\u2019t make any deals with the devil, I will personally walk them out of the church.\u201dThis was the reason that Zola gave out.But this seemingly simple reason instantly terrified the residents of Chambord on both sides of the street. Some people who were crying and begging for mercy because their friends and relatives were pulled out of the crowd were all stunned. They didn\u2019t dare to make any sounds; defeat and despair filled their eyes.On Azeroth Continent, it didn\u2019t matter how much prestige you had or how powerful you are, once you have been considered making a deal with the devil by the Holy Church, that meant the same as saying hello to the Grim Reaper\u2019s sickle. There would be a location prepared for you in advance on the Holy Church\u2019s Burning Cross.There was no exaggeration. There was a shocking incident \u2013Twenty years ago, Bruno, the famous emperor of the strong level 6 Dulin Empire had advanced to the peak of Moon Rank under the age of fifty \u2013 a Full Moon Warrior. Some people even predicted that with one more step, Bruno could advance to Sun Ranked. On top of that, Dulin Empire had armies of millions and numerous powerful warriors and mages. They indeed dominated a section of the continent, and no other Empires dared to cause conflict with them in more than ten years.However, during his heyday, Bruno suffered from a man-made disaster.The cause was from one of the parties that the Church hosted. Bruno, who was a little arrogant, had offended Pope Platini accidentally, and he was later accused of colluding with the devils in Hell by the Church. Under the command of the Pope, soldiers of the Execution Knight Templar wiped out the Dulin Empire from the Continent with their powerful force. The fate of the super strong Bruno was even more miserable \u2013 It was said that he was tied onto the Burning Cross of the Sun God on the peak of the Holy Mountain \u2013 Waulu Mountain, which was also the headquarter of the Holy Church. He was burned alive by the terrible magic fire for three years and died in endless pain.Therefore, Zola\u2019s simple words had suddenly put everyone in despair. The few young girls who were dragged out of the crowd by iron chains on their necks even fainted and fell to the ground.The crowd was silent on the street.Even the friends and relatives of the young women and men who were \u201ccaptured\u201d didn\u2019t dare to say a word at this point; they didn\u2019t even dare to make crying noises.The Holy Church\u2019s despotic power was evident.Zola the [Two legged bald rattlesnake] was obviously satisfied with the result that he made.He liked the atmosphere where he was feared by people.Zola rubbed his \u201cbeloved\u201d black scepter in his hand and glanced around \u201cmajestically\u201d. He nodded proudly after finding out that no one dared to even look at him. All the grievance and stinks that he experienced at the division of Holy Church in Zenit\u2019s Capital St. Petersburg were finally evened out and made up by this. He had his confidence back again.But as he was turning around and about to get into his gilded magic carriage \u2013\u201cWait a moment, Mr. Priest. I can testify for these people. They have no connection with the evil undead magic.\u201dA crisp and sweet voice sounded beside his ear. It instantly destroyed all of Zola\u2019s good mood.The rattlesnake was raged.He turned back around rapidly and pointed his scepter at the source of the voice without identifying who the voice belonged to first. Suddenly, a white beam with devastating power shot out of the purple crystal that was embedded onto the Zola\u2019s favorite black scepter, like a laser, headed toward the direction of the voice.Priest skill \u2013 \u3010Light Extinction\u3011.The attack was deadly. No one was expecting that Zola would directly go for the kill.Uncontrollable gasps and screams filled the street.Priest Zola didn\u2019t see who was speaking, but everyone else clearly saw who it was; everyone\u2019s expression changed. The one who stood out bravely and faced danger was King Alexander\u2019s future queen; The kind, gentle, and beautiful Angela.The bright white beam with its scorching temperature was instantly about to hit Angela; it already burned a few of the girl\u2019s black hair that was fluttering in the wind\u2026\u2026 As the young girl was about to die because of something she said, at this moment \u2013\u201cTink!\u201dA huge black sword that was covered by a blue flame appeared out of nowhere and shielded Angela behind it.The sword\u2019s handle was held in a thick and strong hand.The body of the sword lightly shook as the blue energy flame on it collided with the white beam of light. The flamed rippled, and both energies disappeared eventually.The person who appeared on time was the former number one warrior of Chambord, Lampard.\u201cHow dare you attack queen her highness! Priest Zola, are you intentionally trying to cause conflict between the Holy Church and Chambord?\u201dLampard stood firmly in front of the carriage. The blue flowing energy was stimulated to the max as it enveloped Lampard\u2019s body in its flames. The red hair also broke free from the linen hairband and fluttered in the wind. He stared at Zola who was on the gilded carriage and questioned him loudly.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Angela her highness\u2026\u2026Pardon my rudeness.\u201dZola now finally had seen who spoke and going against his will. However, a queen of a level 6 affiliated kingdom in a level 1 Empire was nothing in his eyes. Although he said sorry, but no one could see that he meant it. He curled his lips causally and said with a faint smile on his face: \u201cMr. Lampard, please put away your black magic weapon. Are you trying to attack a priest of the Holy Church?\u201dLampard slightly paused.After a few seconds, he frowned and suddenly swung his hand, the black sword turned into a shadow and inserted back to the scabbard on his back. However, you could still see the anger on Lampard\u2019s face. He quickly glanced at the few Chambord residents who were dragged out of the crowd by novice priests, and asked angrily: \u201cI don\u2019t know what crimes these people committed. Does the Holy Church have the authority to arrest anyone they want?\u201d\u201cWatch your words, Mr. Lampard\u2026\u2026\u201d Zola was getting a bit angry as well by all the oppositions. He stood high up on the carriage and shouted with a scorn expression: \u201cAre you questioning God\u2019s fairness? We have clear evidence showing that undead magic was used at the battle at Chambord. I suspect that these people are related to the matter, so I\u2019m taking these people back to the church to find out the truth\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut Mr. Priest. I have clear evidence that these people that you arrested have nothing to do with undead magic\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore the [Two Legged Bald Rattlesnake] could finish speaking, Angela suddenly cut him off. The beautiful girl was obviously scared by the previous deadly attack, her face was still all pale, but her pure, crystal like big eyes shined a brave light. She looked at the begging expression on the few young girls who were arrested, and firmly retorted: \u201cMr. Priest, you just said that undead magic was used in the battle on the stone bridge, but everyone at Chambord could testify that none of the people that you arrested appeared on the stone bridge during that battle. Therefore, it\u2019s impossible for them to have any connection with undead magic.\u201dAngela\u2019s words opened up everyone\u2019s mind.\u201cYeah, they never left Chambord, how could the undead magic on the stone bridge be related to them?\u201d\u201cMaybe it was those black armoured bastards who used undead magic!!\u201d\u201cMr. Priest, please don\u2019t arrest people randomly!\u201d\u201cAngela her highness made a point. Nelly and other girls absolutely have no connection with undead magic\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Aunt Coulee just give birth to her child less than a month ago, and doesn\u2019t even have the strength to pick up a kitchen knife. How could she know any undead magic?\u201dAfter hearing Angela\u2019s defence, the crowd on both sides of the street finally had the courage to speak what was on their minds. They shouted and booed; especially the families of the people who were arrested, they shouted repeatedly and the situation was getting a bit out of control.Honestly, everyone knew the reason why Zola arrested these people.The few cleanly dressed young men would be used as hostages to extort money from their families. The other young and pretty girls would be used as tools for the higher up authorities in the Church to blow off sexual steam; they would be also kept as maids and slaves, to clean the church and take care of daily tasks for the church members. These incidents had happened many times. Of course, someone would be burned alive on the burning cross for the reason of colluding with evil forces; Aunt Coulee who had her newborn in her arms was probably the poor soul that Zola was planning to burn alive to demonstrate the church\u2019s power and majesty.After seeing the scene in front of him, Zola who was standing on the footboard on the carriage was a little stifled.He didn\u2019t expect that a little girl could stir up so much trouble. These low class people started to rebel and his majesty and prestige was seriously challenged. After thinking about that, this vicious rattlesnake was angered; his expression changed as he threatened fiercely: \u201cThe force of evil is always great at deceiving people, and blinding people who are naive and ignorant\u2026\u2026Angela your highness, Mr. Lampard, if you don\u2019t move, you will be considered as having connections with the undead magic by the Holy Church. There shall be no mercy on the burning cross!\u201dAfter he said that, Zola didn\u2019t wait for either of them to respond. He turned around and enter the gilded magic carriage directly.After seeing that, a short and fat novice priest who was the closest to Angela and Lampard shook the iron chains in his hands proudly and said: \u201cHaha, please move! Or else\u2026\u2026Hehe!\u201d The novice priest\u2019s facial expression was reflecting the threat as well.Lampard\u2019s eyebrow rose, and his hand grabbed onto the hilt of his black sword on his back.He turned his head and looked at Angela, waiting for the \u201cgo ahead\u201d signal.Angela\u2019s big beautiful eyes were filled with anxious tears.The girl didn\u2019t know what to do at the moment, as if she was an ant in a hot pan. She knew that if she allowed Lampard to take action and save those people by force, it would bring a disaster to Alexander who was about to get canonized, as well as Chambord as a whole\u2026\u2026 However, the kind girl couldn\u2019t just allow her innocent subjects to get arrested by the church.At this moment \u2013A warm and strong hand suddenly held onto the girl\u2019s shoulder. A familiar voice then sounded beside Angela\u2019s ear like the sound from heaven: \u201cJust leave everything to me!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes cleared up and all the anxiety and worries weighing on her mind were gone.Lampard who was standing beside Angela finally loosen his grip on the hilt on his black sword, and gently let out a deep breath. The crowds on both sides of the street couldn\u2019t help but to cheer quietly. King Alexander had arrived, and everyone felt like they had found their spiritual pillar. They firmly believed that nothing in this world would be a problem for the \u201comnipotent\u201d King Alexander.\u201cUnlock the chains, then go away.\u201dFei looked at the short and fat novice priest who was being too arrogant and said casually.The novice priest was mad, however\u2026\u2026 He clearly felt that this young man in front of him was very dangerous; it even gave him chills. His intuition told him to move away quickly, otherwise\u2026\u2026 the consequence would be too severe.As if he was hypnotized, the short and fat priest let go of his hands on the [Light Chain], and released the poor brown haired girl. The poor girl trembled as she ran behind Fei like a frightened bunny; Angela whispered to calm her down and stroked her hair to comfort her heart.Fei stood in front of them. He didn\u2019t say anything, he just glanced around with a calm expression on his face.It was only a simple glance.However, wherever he looked, the cavaliers\u2019 retinues who were like vicious wolves were all terrified. They shook in fear as if a bunch of dogs saw the king of the jungle.No one dared to stared back at Fei.The novice priests who held the [Light Chain] tight in their hands felt like a sharp sword was placed beside their necks as soon as Fei gazed at them. The hands that were clutching onto the [Light Chains] trembled as they quickly released them; as if what they gripping in their hands weren\u2019t the Church\u2019s instrument [Light Chain] that they could tie up any noble on a regular day, but rather a piece of red-hot iron.As if they were amnestied, the poor residents who were arrested quickly got off of the ground and raced to hide behind Fei\u2019s back frighteningly.In their eyes, this figure was the most indestructible castle wall in the whole world. Half a month ago when the black armoured enemies tried to siege the kingdom, this figure had blocked them out of the main gate. At this very moment, it was this figure that rescued them from the hands of the Grim Reaper in the nick of time.\u201cTap, tap, tap, tap, tap\u2026\u2026\u201dFei completely ignored the novice priests and their retinue. He gently walked towards the gilded magic carriage. The dozens of guards who were taking everything seriously didn\u2019t even dare to stop him. They all moved and made a path for him obediently, as if they were greeting their masters.Fei laid his hand on the thrill of the gilded magic carriage and knocked it lightly: \u201cHey, come out. Let\u2019s have a talk.\u201dThere was no reaction within the carriage.The silence was frightening.\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of patience.\u201d Fei frowned. He tensed his body up and the strength of the level 20 Barbarian was about to burst out. It was the sign of an outbreak.At this moment, \u201cCreak!\u201dThe sound of wooden surfaces scratching on each other was as quiet as mosquito humming, but it took everyone\u2019s breath.Because the [Two Legged Bald Rattlesnake] finally came out again.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Alexander his majesty\u2026\u2026\u201d Priest Zola opened the door. This time, the vicious rattlesnake didn\u2019t stand high up on the footboard; instead, he bended his back and got off of the carriage. He smiled as he gently bowed: \u201cI was about to visit his majesty, and congratulate King Alexander about the formal canonization from Zenit Empire in five days\u2026\u2026Hehehe, I didn\u2019t expect to meet his majesty this soon. Please accept the congratulation from Zola and the Holy Church.\u201dThe chins of people around them almost slammed to the ground.Those cavaliers\u2019 retinues and novice priests opened their eyes wide, they couldn\u2019t believe what was going on. They all stared at this Priest Zola as if he was a stranger to them.\u201cThis is crazy. When did our arrogant Mr. Priest turn into a kind and gentle elder? His attitude was even\u2026\u2026 he was trying to please the young king? What is going on?\u201dOnly Lampard who was standing further away saw that when Zola came out of the carriage, he quickly glanced at the knight Luciano, and the latter shook his head secretly.Unfortunately, Fei ignored the rattlesnake\u2019s pleasing.He didn\u2019t even politely respond.\u201cWhy did you arrest my subjects?\u201d Fei pointed at the few young men and women who were still trembling and standing beside Angela, and asked bluntly. His eyebrows were slightly furrowed as he started at Zola sharply, as if Zola couldn\u2019t give him a satisfactory answer, he would scrape the flesh off of Zola\u2019s bones piece by piece.Surprisingly, the rattlesnake demonstrated patience that was disproportionate to his personality when he heard the offensive questioning. He looked in the direction that Fei was pointing as a surprising expression appeared on his face, as if he had no idea what just happened. He laughed: \u201cHehehe, so your majesty is angry at this matter. I just suddenly realized a second ago that perhaps Angela her highness was correct. There might be some misunderstanding. Release them, quickly release them\u2026\u2026 King Alexander, the Church had received the message that the evil undead magic appeared around Chambord. Bishop Sergievsky specifically remind me to investigate about this matter in detail. As the person in charge of the church at Chambord, I had no choice!\u201d\u201cThis is the first time, so I won\u2019t hold you accountable for this\u2026\u2026 However, if the Holy Church wants to arrest my subjects from now on, you better let me the king know!\u201dFei\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change a bit when Zola was being overly enthusiastic to please him; he was even too lazy to put up a smile on his face. He stopped staring at Zola and glanced around. His eyes landed on the whip that was dripping blood in Knight Luciano\u2019s hand. He pointed at him and shouted: \u201cYou, get off the horse and come here!\u201dLuciano was stunned.In the next second, the knight was suddenly engulfed in uncontrollable anger.\u201cHow dare this ant like king offend me, a three-star Holy Knight from the Holy Church!\u201d As Luciano was rubbing his beard and about to explode, he suddenly saw Priest Zola who was standing beside Fei slightly shake his head. It instantly reminded Luciano about the description of this king on the information that the Holy Church collected. Luciano\u2019s mind cleared and a lot of the anger dissipated. He held back the rest of the anger as he jumped off of the horse and walked to Fei.\u201cKing Alexander, what do you need?\u201dFei looked at him and pointed at the poor women that he whipped earlier who had fainted due to the pain. As if he didn\u2019t want to talk to him, only a short sentence came out of his mouth: \u201cApologize and compensate 100 gold coins.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Luciano was having a hard time holding back his anger.However, Zola suddenly reached out and lightly pulled Luciano\u2019s cape, then winked to signal the novice priest who was standing behind him. That novice priest was smart guy, he instantly knew what Zola wanted. He quickly took out 100 gold coins and put it in Luciano\u2019s hand. This bearded knight walked to the women reluctantly under Zola\u2019s repeated signals, sprinkled the gold coins onto the woman\u2019s body, humphed, turned around and was about to walk away\u2026\u2026\u201cStop, you haven\u2019t apologized yet!\u201dAfter seeing that, Fei suddenly shouted and stopped him.Knight Luciano instantly turned around, faced Fei and a silver [Battle Ring] appeared under his feet, and grew out to a five, six yards radius. His imposing manner and strength was skyrocketing. The power of the three-star warrior was fully exposed. Luciano stared at Fei coldly, the meaning was obvious \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t go too far, I don\u2019t care that you are the king.\u201dFei switched to Paladin ModeHe didn\u2019t say anything.He slowly walked toward Luciano step by step.When he took the third step, something magical happened \u2013 You could see a golden [Battle Ring] appearing under his feet and started to expand outward. Although the level 12 Paladin wasn\u2019t as strong and oppressive as Luciano, but the golden [Battle Ring] shocked everyone from the Holy Church including Zola.\u201cHow could this be?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a golden [Battle Ring]?\u201dThat was the type of [Battle Ring] that only the favourite children of the supreme God could have. Out of the hundreds of thousands of Holy Knights that the Church had, most of them only had silver colored [Battle Rings]. The ones that had golden [Battle Ring] were the real elites. Although the chances of having golden [Battle Ring] was less than one in a hundred thousand Holy Knights, as soon as those Holy Knights appeared, they would all receive the God\u2019s blessings and became Gurus and mighty, influential leaders in the Holy Church.Even though the [Two Legged Bald Rattlesnake] Zola could think of more than a thousand secretive deadly tricks and traps in a blink of an eye, at this moment he was in a deep shock. So deep that he couldn\u2019t even think and process information properly.When all the Holy Church stuffs were rubbing their eyes and making sure that they were not hallucinating, something even more magical happened. When Fei took the fourth step, another golden [Battle Ring] appeared under his feet and started spreading. The two golden [Battle Rings] shifted like waves; although their colors were similar, they were totally different. Everyone could feel the two different scary holy powers that had different properties and effects.\u201cApologize, now!\u201dFei didn\u2019t hold back any Auras of the level 12 Paladin. He looked like a god that was enveloped in a layer of golden holy energy. The black hair fluttered in the air, and the tips were coated in gold. He appeared supremely majesty, and no one dared to look at him in the eyes. His cold words were like a heavy hammer that smashed Knight Luciano\u2019s head.Paladin from the Diablo World had too many similar abilities with the Holy Knight from the Holy Church in the real world. They were almost all identical. Even \u201cAura\u201d and the \u201cHoly Energy\u201d were so similar, no one could tell the difference. Everyone thought King Alexander was a hermit Holy Knight that had a high status at the Holy Church. They were all aghast.Knight Luciano started trembling irresistibly.As soon as the golden [Battle Ring] appear, all of his resistance dissolved, he didn\u2019t dare to go against Fei\u2019s will anymore. His face paled as he looked at Fei, a pleading expression filled his eyes.\u201cYour majesty\u2026\u2026 please forgive me!\u201d Luciano kneeled down in front of Fei.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What a horrifying noun, and what a supreme monster the Holy Church was. Even the life of the Holy Church\u2019s guard dog was more precious than a noble from a kingdom. Now however, the arrogant Holy Knight Mr. Luciano was shivering, kneeling and begging King Alexander for forgiveness\u2026\u2026 what was going on?While the residents were confused, something crazier occurred \u2013The evil and vicious [Two Legged Rattlesnake] Priest Zola panicked as he crouched down and crawled towards Fei. With a humble attitude the people of Chambord had never seen before, he kissed Fei\u2019s boots passionately and said in a shaky voice, \u201cHonorable Master, humble Zola begs for your generous forgiveness\u2026\u2026 We didn\u2019t know of your honorable identity in advance. We are truly guilty. Please forgive us two lowly wretches!\u201dHundreds of cavaliers\u2019 retinues and novice priests were shocked. They looked at each other in unison as their bosses suddenly lost all their pride and prestige and kneeled down begging for forgiveness. After a few seconds of hesitation, they all copied Zola and Luciano\u2019s action and knelt down as well; they didn\u2019t even dare to breathe too heavily.Although these people were at the bottom of the Holy Church\u2019s hierarchy and the majority of them didn\u2019t know what the golden [Battle Ring] that appeared on the young king meant, they had followed and served Zola and Luciano for a while. They all had high EQs and were good at observing situations. From their two bosses\u2019 expressions, they at the very least knew that they had kicked on an iron plate and messed with someone that they shouldn\u2019t have messed with.\u201cPlease forgive us, master!\u201d Hundreds of people knelt down and begged.\u201cMaster? Ha, tell me, who\u2019s master am I?\u201dFei said to the Holy Church crowd with a faint smile on his face.\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026.you\u2026\u2026Oh, right right right, you aren\u2019t\u2026\u2026Ah, no, I mean\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201dDespite Zola having the brains to come up with thousands of conspiracies, at this key point, he was stuttering and couldn\u2019t put a sentence together.He had only heard of the Holy Knights who had a golden [Battle Ring] in legends and tales, let alone a Holy knight that had a double golden [Battle Rings]. He had the chance to go to a Church\u2019s party at St. Petersburg for senior priests and overheard Sergievsky, the Bishop for Zenit Empire mention stories about these [God\u2019s Favorite Children] who had golden [Battle Rings] \u2013 These [God\u2019s Favorite Children] were all secret characters that most people didn\u2019t know about. Before they were formally appointed to powerful positions at the Holy Church, they would be appointed by the Pope to execute some secret missions or go on unknown journeys to gain more experience. Their identities were all hidden, and their statuses were highly respected by everyone at the Holy Church. They had enormous opportunities to become candidates for the position of Pope; the most incompetent ones would become Bishops for the huge empires and take control of the church in a region. The future and potential of Zola who was only a representative for the church in a small level 6 affiliated kingdom that belonged to a level 1 empire couldn\u2019t even be compared with these people, so how could Zola not be scared?Zola felt like he was in a freezer; he could feel the chill in his bones. He didn\u2019t expect to meet someone on that level and leave a bad first impression. He wanted to flatter Fei a little bit to make up for what he had done, but once he thought that Fei might be executing some kind of secret mission under the Pope\u2019s instruction, he didn\u2019t dare to call out Fei\u2019s \u201cTrue Identity\u201d\u2026\u2026 \u201cDamn it! Should I address Alexander by \u2018master\u2019 or pretend that I don\u2019t know him?\u201dZola had lost his cool.Fei on the other hand had roughly guessed what was happening after seeing all the church people kneeling down and shivering. The reason he switched from his Level 20 Barbarian Mode to the Level 12 Paladin Mode was because he wanted to cheat a little with the Paladin\u2019s Aura, but he didn\u2019t expect it to have such a significant effect.\u201cYou, stand up and apologize to the woman you injured.\u201dFei was afraid that saying anymore might raise suspicion. He pretended to be mysterious and change the conversation back to the previous topic. He pointed at the Knight Luciano and said coldly.\u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026\u2026\u201dLuciano felt relieved after he heard that.He and Zola passionately crawled and rushed to the woman who was waking up as if she was their mother. Luciano helped the woman sit up and Zola, who wanted to cleanse the impression Fei had of him used everything he had and was barely able to cast a high level spell that required a ton of mental effort [Heal]. A milky white light bloomed in his hand and shrouded the whip wounds on the woman\u2019s back. After the miraculous effect appeared, the horrifying wounds soon disappeared under the illumination of the white light.Fei\u2019s pupil slightly contracted after seeing that.Holy Church\u2019s holy [Healing] spell had similar effects compared to \u3010Healing Potions\u3011from the Diablo World, but it had its own mystical and unique sides. It looked like the Holy Church had an unfathomable foundation and background which allowed it to be the monster and dominate the Azeroth Continent.\u201cYou were brave enough to try to harm Angela. You deserve to be killed thousands of times!\u201d Fei said in a bloody tone as he stared at Zola coldly.\u201cForgive me, your majesty, please forgive me. I was being really dumb, I won\u2019t do it ever again\u2026\u2026\u201d After hearing Fei bringing that up, Zola kneeled in front of Fei\u2019s feet again as he trembled. He started to snivel and begged, \u201cYour majesty, I know my mistake. From now on, Zola will always fulfill your orders and listen to whatever you say!\u201dThis poisonous snake was scared to death.Fei backed off a few steps in disgust. He knew that at this point, neither his own personal power or Chambord\u2019s strength could challenge the huge Holy Church; the difference in strength between the two was gigantic, like comparing a speck of dust to the sun. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t be too impulsive. He had handled most of the problems, so he decided to take care of the remaining accounts with the two bums in the future. He waved his hand and said, \u201cNevermind, I won\u2019t hold you guys accountable anymore on the fact that this was your first time. However, be careful how you behave in Chambord. If you dare offend or annoy me one more time, don\u2019t say that I\u2019m ruthless.\u201d\u201cOk,ok,ok!\u201dZola was so relieved that he almost cried.He was glad that this \u201cMaster\u201d was magnanimous enough to forgive them. Just with Fei\u2019s status alone in the Holy Church, even if he ended up killing both of them, Bishop Sergievsky would say that they were guilty. As long as he could extinguish \u201cthis master\u2019s\u201d anger, Zola was confident with his numerous methods to make \u201cthis powerful man\u201d happy. \u201cAs long as I can tie myself together with this promising man\u2026\u2026tut \u2013 tut.\u201d Zola was secretly laughing every time he thought of it. He definitely believed that this was a rare and golden opportunity that he should take advantage of it.\u201cAlright, I don\u2019t want to see you guys anymore. Send someone to take the injured people home and compensate them\u2026\u2026 Get away from me, now!\u201d Fei waved his hand as if he was expelling some flies; his impatience was obvious.\u201cAlright, ok, ok\u2026\u2026\u201dZola and Luciano nodded obediently and turned around to order the retinues and novice priests, \u201cYou guys, quickly help these injured children of God get home\u2026\u2026 Oh, you guys are too rough, compensate every household with 10 gold coins\u2026\u2026 Oh, no, compensate them with 20 gold coins!\u201dAfter seeing that some injured people were slightly immobilized, Zola squinted his eyes and immediately ordered, \u201cUse my carriage\u2026\u2026 Use my carriage to take them back, don\u2019t let them suffer any more pain.\u201dThe novice priests were shocked and stared at Zola in surprise. They thought that they had heard it wrong. Zola spent a lot of resources on picking up this carriage and he was reluctant to use it regularly. Was he going to use this magic carriage to take these dirty low class people home?\u201cWhat are you guys still standing here for? Go and do it, idiots!\u201dZola shouted at the novice priests, and then turned around and asked, \u201cYour majesty, what do you think? Are you satisfied?\u201d20 gold coins was the average annual income for a household in Chambord. Most of the injured residents were only lightly wounded by the retinues and novice priests. The only severely injured one was the woman who was whipped, but she was now fully recovered and also compensated 100 gold coins. Zola and Luciano miscalculated everything and were now disgraced, losing money.Fei\u2019s inner rage dissipated a little at this point. He nodded and waved, \u201cAlright, now get out of my sight!\u201dHis attitude was extremely impatient.Zola and Luciano didn\u2019t get mad at all. Instead, they felt like that was the proper manner that a [God\u2019s Favorite Child] should have. They nodded submissively, apologized again and left with the retinues and novice priests.After seeing the vicious church personnel leave embarrassingly, Chambord\u2019s residents on both sides of the street felt like they had just woken up from a dream. The just and kind King Alexander protected them and surprised everyone again. Applause and cheers were as loud as thunder\u2026\u2026The beautiful Angela and Emma stood in the excited crowd. They stared at Fei with fascination and passion.Lampard turned around and left quietly the loud cheers.Fei on the other hand stared at the carriage fleet which was slowly moving away. When they were passing by Fei, he saw a handsome blonde young man who looked slightly sick through the window at the back of the magic carriage. The pair of crystal blue, ocean-like eyes gave Fei an indescribable strange feeling.\u201cWho is he?\u201dFor some reason, Fei was suddenly full of curiosity towards that young man.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, his sexual orientation was very normal; he wasn\u2019t interested in men. The mysterious young man gave Fei a strange feeling. Sometimes, the young man felt powerful like the vigorous and vast sea, while other times he suddenly felt weak and fragile like a dry candle wick that was about to extinguish. It was very bizarre.You could say that except for quelling and intimidating the two bad eggs Zola and Luciano, and somehow gaining \u201c[God\u2019s Favorite Child]\u201d status by using his Paladin mode in this conflict with the Holy Church, what gave Fei the most vivid impression was a glimpse of the blonde young man.Fei was also sure that when the carriage passed by him, the mysterious young man was observing him closely as well.The crowd on the street slowly dispersed.Fei held Angela\u2019s and Emma\u2019s small hands and started walking home. He listened to the two pure and cute girls\u2018 chat about what had just happened and simply smiled. The golden light of the sunset shined on their bodies and dragged out three perfectly contoured and warm shadows of different heights.\u201cAlexander, why did those two call you master? When did you join the Holy Church?\u201d Emma jumped around and asked curiously like a sparrow.\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe they were dizzy and mistook me for someone else!\u201d Fei gave Emma a perfunctory answer.\u201cMistaken? Impossible\u2026\u2026Huh! If you don\u2019t want to tell me, then forget it!\u201dThe girl got a little mad and wanted to pull her hand away from Fei\u2019s grip, but somehow, as if she couldn\u2019t give up the warm feeling from Fei\u2019s big hand, she hesitated a little and let Fei hold onto her hand obediently in the end. She pursed her lips \u201cgrumpily\u201d and stared at Fei.Fei smiled back and didn\u2019t say anything more.He couldn\u2019t really explain himself, because those two bad eggs didn\u2019t make a mistake.However, what Zola said alerted Fei.He didn\u2019t expect that the Holy Church would know about the battle that occurred in Chambord and accurately identified that necromancy was used in the battle on the stone bridge. It revealed a lot of information.First of all, Fei could confirm that the power of Necromancer Mode was not allowed by the Holy Church in the real world. He had to be extra careful when he planned to use Necromancer Mode in the future. At least before having the power and strength that could take on the Holy Church alone, he couldn\u2019t leave any clues that might be traced back to him. This was a precaution so that he wouldn\u2019t be arrested by the crazy priests and be tied to a burning cross.Next, he knew that the Holy Church had a terrifying intelligence system; they knew about the battle on the stone bridge and sent out orders in just a few days. The speed of collecting and transmitting information in this world was almost as fast as the internet and phones on Earth; they probably used a special channel or media that Fei didn\u2019t know about. From that, Fei could infer that the intelligence system of their mortal enemy \u2013 the Level 4 Eindhoven Empire was of no comparison to the Holy Church. But if they really wanted to find out what had happen to the black armoured troops, it probably wouldn\u2019t take long. As a result, the safety of Chambord would be under a big threat. If everything wasn\u2019t handled properly, the secret of the Mythical Ruins would also be leaked out\u2026\u2026Fei felt like his position as the king was very tragic. After he got to this world, he hadn\u2019t relaxed a single day and enjoyed time with the beauties. Instead, he was being a typical firefighter; he had to handle every problem as soon as they came up.After they returned to the Palace, the servants had already prepared the dinner.Fei was not used to the culinary culture in this world \u2013 Except for fruits and roasted meat, there was only whole wheat bread and smelly milk. It was alright just for a few meals, giving it an exotic feeling. But once Fei had it for a while, he felt like throwing up every time he saw the same dishes over and over again.But after seeing Angela and Emma enjoy the food, Fei could only pinch his nose and sit farther away as he started biting on an apple innocently.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s necessary to transform the culinary styles at Chambord. At the very least, I have to hire a few talented chefs and train them well. They probably can\u2019t make food like KFC or McDonalds Burgers. I don\u2019t know the recipes, and even if I did, I probably couldn\u2019t find the ingredients on Azeroth Continent. However, they could at least make food like hotpot, Kung Pao chicken, crepes and French toast.\u201dAs Fei was thinking to himself, Angela and Emma on the other side of the table had already happily changed into the Pirates of Caribbean styled dress that Fei designed earlier. The \u201cclothing reformation\u201d was obviously having success; it motivated Fei and boosted his confidence; he was already planning how to set off a \u201cdiet storm\u201d.\u201cAngela, what do you think of these new dresses?\u201d Fei asked with a smile as he bit into the apple.The future queen was wiping the grease off of her alluring pink plump lips with a white napkin. After hearing Fei\u2019s question, a joyful expression appeared on her face. She giggled, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing! Did you know, now all of the girls in the kingdom feel that wearing the set of dresses that King Alexander designed is an honour. Great tailors such as Aunt Eliza have been super busy; some noble ladies had pre-ordered dozens of sets of dresses a few days ago. Even the silk and cloth merchants in the kingdom have made a fortune; all of them are now out of stock\u2026\u2026 Alexander, do you know what the residents are calling these new dresses?\u201d\u201cWhat are they calling it?\u201d\u201c[King Alexander\u2019s Wisdom]!\u201d Emma who was struggling to take in a piece of roasted meat replied in a rush, \u201cPeople named these dresses as [King Alexander\u2019s Wisdom]. Even Viscountess Louise who had been to St. Petersburg, the capital of Zenit Empire claimed that the noble ladies in the Imperial Capital had never worn something so delicate and beautiful.\u201dFei blushed; it was a rare sight to behold.He didn\u2019t expect that the designs he pretty much plagiarized from the Pirates of Caribbean would create such a buzz. \u201cShould I plagiarize the rest of the battle uniforms of the female pirates?\u201d At this moment, an idea suddenly flashed through his head, but he couldn\u2019t get a clear grip of it. Fei shook his head and suddenly winked at Angela with a \u201cyou know what I\u2019m talking about\u201d expression on his face, \u201cEh\u2026\u2026oh yeah, Angela, hehe, that\u2026\u2026the last set of clothing that I designed\u2026\u2026Eh, is that set popular as well?\u201dAngela\u2019s face instantly got red.But the girl didn\u2019t run away like last time. She pretended to be calm and sat still as she said, \u201cThe piece that you named [Boobs Armour] was even more popular than those dresses. Aunt Eliza had modified it a little bit and made them in different colors and styles. It has been secretly spreading to all the women in the kingdom.\u201dWhen the girls were speaking, she tried to not to look as uneasy and act calm and collected\u2026\u2026 However, her hands had twisted the edge of her dress into a ball of ragged cloth under the dinner table. Her heart was also pumping and beating quietly. All she wanted was to have the calm and cool demeanor of a future queen just like those noble ladies in the kingdom.Fei\u2019s recent miraculous performances didn\u2019t just give courtiers such as Brook a lot of pressure; it also made the smart and beautiful future queen feel like there was an invisible gap that was enlarging between her and Fei. She was quietly putting in effort to make herself worthy enough to be the partner of the great King Alexander.When Alexander was still a retard, many people felt sorry and pity for Angela who was like a peerless lotus flower that was about to be placed in a pile of dog sh*t. But now, their roles were slowly switching.The King Alexander now didn\u2019t only become normal. He was also becoming stronger and more powerful at an unimaginable rate. In less than a month, he had surpassed the former number one warrior at Chambord, Frank-Lampard, and became the undisputed number one warrior, securing the throne and winning over the admiration and respect of everyone in Chambord.What about Angela?She felt like she was still the same girl: kind, pure, innocent, a little weak, and a little clumsy. Except for when dealing with trivial matters, the girl felt like she slowly couldn\u2019t keep up with the pace of this man. She could no longer take care and protect him like before. Just like a fine umbrella, you could shield the rain in a rainy day, but you no longer needed it when the sun came up.Therefore, Angela was working hard to change herself all this time.Today, when the novice priests from the Holy Church pulled out and arrested the innocent residents from the crowd and accused them of colluding with evil undead mages, Angela was scared and shivering when she stood up and refuted Zola. She didn\u2019t even know why she stood up. Even though she was the future queen of Chambord, but she was no different than a regular civilian in the eyes of the huge Holy Church. With a single word from the [Two legged rattlesnake], she could be sent onto a burning cross\u2026\u2026 However, when she thought that Alexander would stand up without hesitation to protect his people at a time like that, Angela somehow stood up and clearly and logically expressed her opinion as she suppressed the fear in her heart \u2013 Unfortunately, what made Angela dismayed was that her effort didn\u2019t help the situation out. If Lampard and Alexander didn\u2019t arrive on time, the situation probably would have worsened\u2026\u2026If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t know when she became like this, and she didn\u2019t want to know \u2026\u2026 She just wanted to become better. With this mentality, she had a sense of inferiority every time she faced Fei.Unfortunately, Fei didn\u2019t know how Angela was feeling; although he thought he was an expert in love.The dinner was still continuing.\u201cOh, right. Alexander, Princess Tanasha also pre-order a few set of the dresses that you designed\u2026\u2026En, she also picked out a few [Booby Armor]\u2026\u2026\u201d Angela didn\u2019t know what \u201cbooby\u201d meant, she only felt that this word was cute. She thought of something and told Fei calmly.Fei instantly blasted the food out of his mouth.\u201cGod, Lord, Budda\u2026\u2026 Could you imagine a pure, fairy like girl saying the word \u201cbooby\u201d in front of you decently? What a bastard, Fei could help but to peeked at one of Angela\u2019s body parts.\u201cOh? Really? What colors did she chose?\u201d Fei asked as he pretended to calm.\u201cRed\u2026\u2026 Oh, and rose.\u201d Emma on the other side of the table was finally done eating. This girl who had been loved by Angela and Fei as a little sister tried really hard to participate in this \u201cadult conversation\u201d. She tilted her head and answered: \u201cHer highness chose all red [Booby Armors].\u201dAgain.Another pure girl was using the word \u201cbooby\u201d. Fei continuously coughed and tried hard to not to spit out the apple that he chewing in his mouth.\u201cAlexander, do you feel not so well?\u201dAfter seeing Fei\u2019s head and neck turning red, Angela worried.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026 no, no. Hehe!\u201d Fei looked around and said: \u201cToday\u2019s weather is not bad\u2026\u2026\u201dThe dinner time quickly passed away in this enchanting atmosphere \u2013 Of course, this atmosphere was only unilateral felt by Fei.After the servants put away the tablewares, Angela and Emma wanted to moved a little to help with the digestion. They held their hands together and decided to go see the big black dog that was in the \u201cfall hibernation\u201d.Angela rescued this big black dog from the back mountain of Chambord. It was only about the size of a hand, cute and weak. Who knew that in the three years time that it would grew to the size of a bull calf with exceptional strength. From the appearance, this black dog definitely wasn\u2019t any of the rare species; there weren\u2019t any difference between it and other street dogs. However, this beast was very smart and super loyal to Angela and Emma. But for some reason, it didn\u2019t like Fei, his male master very much. Every time it saw Fei, it would bark and bare it\u2019s teeth.About ten days ago, this energetic big dog fell into a deep sleep for some reason. Didn\u2019t matter how Angela and Emma tried to wake it up, it didn\u2019t get up to eat or drink. Angela even got the best vet in Chambord to look at it, and the vet couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Angela was pretty anxious about the whole situation\u2026\u2026Of course, everything had a reason.Fei didn\u2019t yet told his beautiful fiancee that the reason why the dog became like this was because \u2014 When he was experimenting with the \u3010Hulk Potion\u3011before, he got too excited. He forced open the dog\u2019s mouth with his hand and poured half a bottle of the potion into the its mouth. The poor dog fortunately didn\u2019t die from the pain, but it for sure suffered from the effect of the potion. That was why it fell into a \u201chibernation\u201d; because of the animal\u2019s self \u2013 protecting nature mechanism.After seeing Angela\u2019s and Emma\u2019s beautiful figure disappearing from the door, Fei stood up and walked to a window in the palace.For some reason, Fei suddenly thought of the mysterious elder princess from Zenit Empire. He wasn\u2019t sure what this princess is doing here. After arriving at Chambord more than ten days ago, she didn\u2019t demand Fei, the king of this affiliated kingdom to go see her. She didn\u2019t come to Fei, nor did Fei go visit her. Both of them were like two kids holding grudges against each other. Both were waiting to see who had the most patience, and could endure the uncomfort the most.\u201cHehe, she actually picked the red bras. Looks like the elder princess is not as bored as she may appear. Hahaha!\u201dThe King who was in the \u201cobscenity mode\u201d didn\u2019t notice that his \u201ceerie\u201d behaviour had scared the servants who were doing the clean up and gave them goosebumps.\u201cYour majesty, Priest Zola and Knight Luciano from the Holy Church is here and wishing to speak to you.\u201dAt this moment, a guard came into the palace and reported.Fei recognized this guard. He was one of the twenty three strongmen that fought on the stone bridge. His name was Michel-Ballack. He gave Fei a trustworthy feel just from his look: his sharp face, black curly hair and big bright eyes combined together appeared just and honest.Fei walked to the main executive hall, and saw Priest Zola and Knight Luciano who were waiting respectfully at the gate. A few clean dressed novice priest were behind them and were all holding onto a few big chests.After seeing Fei\u2019s arrival, both of them put on a flattering smile and walked toward Fei. Fei on the other hand side didn\u2019t even greet them. He humphed and entered the hall directly. Zola and Luciano didn\u2019t get a good response and was pretty embarrassed. However, they didn\u2019t dare to show any signs of unpleasantness and waited quietly at the entrance to the hall.After a while, Guard Ballack came out and said: \u201cKing Alexander asked you to come in.\u201dBoth of them were delighted. They rushed in, and signal the novice priests who were carrying the big chests to follow them. After they entered the hall, they were all walking on their toes as they lightened their breathing; they were afraid that making any other noises might disturb Fei. After they were under the dual lion clustered throne that was high up on the stairs, Zola and Luciano saluted instantly: \u201cYour majesty\u2026\u2026 Zola and Luciano greets my master.\u201d\u201cWhy are you guys here?\u201dFei who was sitting on the high throne and glancing at the two didn\u2019t reject, nor accept the title as the master. But to the two, the question that Fei asked meant that he admited his hiden identity, and Zola was even more sure about his prior assumptions. He quickly answered: \u201cBoth of us only learnt your true identity today. We truely admires master\u2019s identity and deeds. So right after we organized and fixed up the church, we came here immediately to visit you and receive your orders.\u201dAfter he said that, he signalled the novice priests to open up the two iron chest. Colorful lights shined and brighted up the hall. These lights contained some magic powers and gave Fei a familiar feeling.\u201cThese different classes of magic crystals, and a few magic scrolls are the tributes that Luciano and I wanted to give to master. We wish you could like it.\u201d Zola signaled again and the novice priests placed the two chests onto the stone stairs.Fei didn\u2019t say anything.He walked toward one chest and took a detailed look. The chest was filled with weird shaped stones in a few colors, such as yellow, blue and white. They all bloomed soft lights. What was surprising was that each stone emitted some magic power. Some felt soft, some felt warm, some felt aggressive while some felt dense. Magic powers from all classes flowed in the air as the different colored lights shined.Fei reached out his head and grabbed onto a magic crystal; his eyebrow slightly furrowed.He was surprised. Because the magic crystal that Zola was talking about was the same as all the \u3010Chipped Gems\u3011from Diablo World. Not just the shapes, but also the magic power inside of them. He was sure that they were the same thing.But how didn\u2019t the items in Diablo World appear in the real world? And from what Zola and Luciano said, although these magic crystals were expensive, but they were not rare. Otherwise there would be no way for both of them to come up with a whole chest.Fei threw the \u3010Chipped Emerald\u3011back to the chest, and took a look at the other chest.The second chest wasn\u2019t filled with magic crystals. Instead, there were scrolls made from all different materials and were all tied up delicately with golden threads. There were about a dozen of them, and every scroll had a different color, and a different magic power. However, the dense magic symbols and patterns that were sealed and carved on them lighted up and shined irregularly in no patterns. Although there were only about a dozen scrolls, but Zola the two legged rattlesnake used a whole iron chest to contain them. The value of these scroll probably weren\u2019t less than the chest of magic crystals. Unfortunately, Fei didn\u2019t have too much knowledge about the mage profession on Azeroth Continent, even after he read all the books in his Royal Library. He couldn\u2019t identify what kind, nor the level of the magic that was stored in these scrolls. He also couldn\u2019t recognize any of the magic symbol nor patterns. Even though he picked up the scrolls one by one and observed them in detail, he couldn\u2019t get any information out of them.\u201cI will accept these items.\u201dFei didn\u2019t act polite and reject these items at all. Why would he reject these expensive gifts? Moreover, they were from Zola and Luciano, the dirty and greedy partner from Holy Church. Fei won\u2019t feel bad even if he took everything that they got.\u201cAh, awesome, as long as you like them\u2026\u2026 As long as you like them!\u201dAfter hearing that Fei would accept the gifts, both of them let out the breath that they were holding for a long time. They were lit up; what they saw meant that this majestic [God\u2019s Favorite Child] in front of them was satisfied with their behaviour. It was a great sign; if they put more effort into it, the master would be more happy with them.\u201cOne more thing, I want to know how did you guys hear about the evil undead magic appearing during the prior battle?\u201d Fei suddenly asked: \u201cDid the order come from Church\u2019s Bishop from Zenit Empire, or it was a direct order from the headquarter Holy Mountain \u2013 Waulu?\u201dA weird expression appeared on Zola and Luciano\u2019s face. They stared at each other for a little bit, and Zola finally answered honestly: \u201c Master, this information actually didn\u2019t come from the upper layers in the Church. On our way to Chambord, we met a mysterious black cloaked man. He was the one who specifically told us that.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Hail the KingCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: Discussion Behind the BackAnother mysterious man in black cloak?Fei heard the words and was instinctively shocked.The mysterious person\u2019s image in Priest Zola\u2019s mouth immediately reminded Fei about the four-star Wood type Sorceress Evans. You know, the Sorceress Evans that was trolled to death by him previously also has this black cloak style, could there be a connection between these two? Could\u2026 this mysterious man that newly emerged by Evan\u2019s accomplice?Fei could only pray silently in his heart, it\u2019s best that this dark cloak guy is not related to Evans, otherwise it just means that the Mythical Ruins map\u2019s situation is likely known now by other people. Then the \u201cfun\u201d is actually big now, the severity of this matter is even far beyond that time he killed the level 4 Thunder Emperor Prince.\u201cDetails of what happened, carefully tell me about everything again\u2026\u201d Fei\u2019s eyes were like thunder, directly looked at [Two Legged Bald Rattle Snake] Zola and said without any room of compromise, \u201cNot even the slightest omission is allowed, otherwise\u2026 you know the consequences.\u201d\u201cYes Yes Yes, I definitely not dare to have any concealment for you, sir.\u201dZola kept nodded grovelingly with an ingratiating smile and explained the whole story exactly from beginning to end.So, He and Luciano hid in St. Petersburg for sometime, and later when they heard that the Black Armor Army had retreated, they immediately got on the way back to Chambord. After all, in Chambord, these two are still considered two kings, can get wind if they want wind and get rain if they want rain. But at Zenit Empire\u2019s capital St. Petersburg, they are only the little eunuch beside the emperor \u2013 two nonentities.But on the way back, their path was blocked by a mysterious man in black cloak that suddenly appeared. That black cloak man demonstrated superior strength, and the two man of 3 star priest and 3 star knight both couldn\u2019t compete with them. Fortunately, this man did not hold animosity but actually revealed a very important news to Zola: during the stone bridge battle in the city of Chambord, there appeared weak necromancer magic.The word \u201cweak\u201d in that black cloak man\u2019s mouth suddenly let Zola and Luciano\u2019s lit up, necromancer magic is the most intolerable presence in Holy See, and if the two can find out what happened and catch that weak necromancer, they will definitely be heavily rewarded, and their place in Holy See might be promoted one more step.As for the later indiscriminate arrests after entering the city, that was actually just Zola using the issue to exaggerate, one side was to crazily gather wealth, and on the other hand, they also know that because they did not help with defense when the city was under Black Armor army\u2019s siege but found an excuse and escaped from the city, that inevitably led to the Holy See losing prestige in Chambord, so they want to re-establish authority again.It just that they maintained the domineering act for too long, even though it\u2019s the [Two Legged Bald Rattle Snake]\u2019s idea, not only wasn\u2019t means of appeasement used, but more surprisingly they used this kind of wrong method that actually further promoted conflict.\u201cSo, the two of ou don\u2019t know that black cloak man\u2019s identity as well? Didn\u2019t even get to see his real face?\u201d After hearing Rattle Snake Zola\u2019s honest report, Fei frowned and asked.\u201cYes, your honor, that mysterious man is really strong, at least around 4 star. Luciano and I originally indeed wanted to capture him to ask him more questions in detail, but we were both not his match\u2026\u201d When Zola said that, he suddenly became a little embarrassed, and the bearded knight leader Luciano also nodded on the side.Fei lowered his head and became lost in thought.Another unpredictable four star power Black Cloak Sorceress with an unknown past, how come listening to the story makes him feel like he\u2019s somehow connected with Evans who died before in the dungeon prison. That make Fei secretly scared, feeling like he might\u2019ve poked a hornet\u2019s nest\u2026 However, he also faintly felt, as if he ignored something or rather ignored someone.When Fei was in Necromancer mode he only used two skills, [Teeth] and [Corpse Explosion], but both skills were all completed within 3 to 4 seconds, and later followed by the stone bridge breaking, all evidences have been sunk into Zuli river so theoretically no one can find out, unless there was a pro observing the battle on the stone bridge. If that\u2019s really the case, then the mysterious black cloak man mentioned by Zola should also be at the scene. However, the question is here again. If he\u2019s really at the scene, seeing his accomplice Evans getting arrested, he would never just ignore it. With his four star power, he could\u2019ve definitely win the game in an instant\u2026 In other words, this mysterious black cloak man seems to very unlikely be Evans\u2019 associate.But, who else can he be?\u201cYou guys are dismissed for now.\u201dFei thought for a while but couldn\u2019t find any clue, he waved his hand to send Zola and Luciano away, hesitated for a second, and then said again, \u201cThe thing about necromancer, that\u2019s the end, don\u2019t need to investigate further. The stakes involved this time is not something you two can imagine, I will personally take care of it. If you guys investigate on your own rashly, alert the enemy and screw up my plan, by then when the wrath of His Holiness arrives, on the Ten Thousand Flow Summit\u2019s Fire Pillar, two seats will be saved for you two.\u201dThis time Fei completely took advantage of the matter and exaggerated to get away with what he did under camouflage.Since Zola and Luciano already mistook him to be a big shot from above, Fei simply just took the tiger skin and casually placed it on himself. According to Fei\u2019s original plan, he planned to find an opportunity to secretly get rid of these two guys. But, under this situation, perhaps keeping Zola and Luciano will yield magical results later on.After hearing Fei\u2019s words, Zola immediately nodded and bowed and assured, \u201cYour honor, you may rest assured. Luciano and I definitely won\u2019t get involved with this matter at all\u2026 In the future if your honor has any commands, feel free to order us, Chambord\u2019s Holy See is willing to contribute all effort for your honor.\u201d\u201cWell, you two did well. On the matter of finding traces of necromancer, I will credit you guys. When this case is done, after we finish my training here and return back to Divine Mountain Ten Thousand Flow Summit, you guys will naturally be rewarded.\u201d Fei first smacked them with a few big sticks, then threw them some sweet candy (TL: referring to the way he treated them), and in order to pretend more realistically, he even started addressing himself as \u201cwe\u201d.Zola and Luciano were both rejoiced after hearing those words, suddenly feeling that their future is bright as ever, he kowtowed again and again, humbly kneeling down to kiss Fei\u2019s boots, and then joyfully exited the king\u2019s hall.Fei returned to his throne and thought, the identity of this black cloak man is too mysterious with not a single clue, so he decided to might as well not think about it, summoned the prison official to the hall and whispered a few orders.\u2026\u2026After returned to the church, Zola and Luciano dismissed all followers, quietly came to a secret chamber behind the Holy See\u2019s chamber.This is where Zola and Luciano discusses important things.\u201cPriest Zola, are you sure that this Alexander guy who used to be an idiot, is a big shot from the headquarter?\u201d The bearded knight leader was really distressed about those magic scrolls and sorcerer\u2019s stones he had to hand over, frowned and asked. Previously the decision to give gifts to Alexander was made by Zola, and it was still a little hard for Luciano to accept Zola\u2019s judgement.\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019m not 100% sure either.\u201dThe Rattlesnake Zola after returning to church again revealed a superior haughty demeanor. He stood in front of the chamber\u2019s God Father statue with his back facing Luciano. The secret chamber is densely lit by candles, the candle lights flickered, Zola drew a Holy Cross on his chest and then slowly turned around and said, \u201cBut, don\u2019t forget, today the Double Golden [War Ring] Alexander casted today cannot be doubted. You can also feel the terrifying holy power contained by the ring right? It\u2019s possible that even under Zenit pope Sergiyeli\u2019s crown, one wouldn\u2019t have such pure holy force.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true too, but both you and I know, according to the information we had before, Alexander was nothing but a retard since he was born. He had been stupid for nearly 17 years, how could he be [Darling of the God]?\u201dLuciano was still a bit uncertain.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m suspicious of too\u2026 However, that day when the Holy See judged Paladin\u2019s number one pro Holy Knight Charing, before the fame, just because of having disability in both legs he was also considered an idiot. And also the Martial Art God Maradona who even His Holiness have to be a bit courteous towards, for all these years his crazy actions aren\u2019t different from an idiot. In the vast mysterious continent of Azeroth, there are too many cases like this, maybe Alexander was just pretending to be a retard in the past\u2026\u201dThen, a rare horror look flashed past Zola\u2019s eyes, he slowly continued and said, \u201cOld man, I suddenly have a terrible premonition. Chambord seemed to be containing a secret we don\u2019t know, we may be rolled a matter that we shouldn\u2019t know\u2026 Just like what Alexander said himself, maybe he is really carrying out His Holiness\u2019s order and is secretly investigating something.\u201dAfter Zola finished, a fleeting trace of coldness shined in his eyes and his entire person became very depressed.\u201cAfter talking for this long, you weren\u2019t sure of Alexander\u2019s true identity either?\u201d Bearded knight leader became a little anxious, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t we act after observe for a little longer? But you insisted on not waiting to deliver the gifts. What a pity, that box of precious sorcerer\u2019s stones and those magic scrolls. There was even a black scroll of mysterious origin, and it could very likely be a rare forbidden scroll.\u201d\u201cYou are wrong. Timing can be met but can\u2019t be expected or asked. Once missed, you will regret forever.\u201d>>>>>>>>>>>>Translated by Cucumber Strips, forgive any discrepancies in wording and sht plzzzK baiIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
