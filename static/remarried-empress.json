Was it a charade, or was it sincere?ADVERTISINGUntil now I had been a good colleague and a perfect empress. We had never fought \u2014 that is, until he brought her along. He cast me aside for his lover, but until the last moment he\u2019ll want to be a good man and a good emperor.Then there was my family and the great church which had approved of our marriage, who insisted that I not step down from the position of empress. He would certainly dislike the idea of going through a tedious divorce trial against both of these groups.He was that sort of man, and that sort of emperor.\u201cYour Majesty! This can\u2019t be!\u201dMarquis Farang cried out and tried to run towards me, but he was caught by the Emperor\u2019s guards and barred from taking a step further\u2026Marquis Farang and Countess Eliza, my defenders. I am thankful to all of you.I cast them a grateful glance then turned to the court minister.\u201cEmpress Navier. Do you really agree to this divorce document without any objection?\u201dAdvertisementThe court minister had a slightly angry voice. He wanted me to fight and challenge the reason for divorce.While the odds of winning the trial were none, it would cause a scandal for the Emperor and his concubine as the people heard the news. That was what the minister, my family and my friends wanted.I shook my head. A divorce trial may hurt Sovieshu\u2019s reputation, but my name may be scarred as well. It\u2019s not that I had a moral problem, but I might not be able to leverage the situation if it became too complicated.Advertisement\u201cI accept the divorce.\u201dThe minister closed his eyes gravely as murmuring broke out into the room.\u201cAnd ask for permission to remarry.\u201dThe moment I finished speaking, the mood changed completely. The air stilled into a shocked silence and the minister\u2019s eyes flew open. Everyone glanced at each other, unsure of what they heard.Sovieshu looked at me confusedly, a frown furrowing his brow. The minister was in a daze.\u201cEmpress Navier\u2026remarry?\u201dInstead of answering, I stretched out my hand and pointed to one place. As if on cue, a man wearing an embroidered veil that obscured his face burst into pleasant laughter.\u201cDo I come up now?\u201dThe silence was broken by the murmuring of the crowd again. The man walked through the court and stood next to me. When he took off the veil, Sovieshu leapt to his feet.Advertisement\u201cNavier! That man\u2013\u201d\u201cIs the one I will marry.\u201dThe minister\u2019s eyes looked hollow. I smiled and turned the man beside me. He looked at me as if to say, \u201cYou expected this reaction, didn\u2019t you?\u201dSomehow I had a pleasant feeling.Even though it wasn\u2019t revenge I desired.*Advertisement**The Troby family which I come from had already produced several empresses. Among the imperial family and nobility, arranged marriages were common. Marriage was for politics and romance was for their lovers, and it was common for male or female nobility to have a beloved on the side.Ossis III, the previous emperor, spotted me as a match for the Crown Prince, and from an early age I was educated by the Empress on etiquette and the workings of the imperial court. Fortunately, the Crown Prince Sovieshu and I took to each other, and we got along like good friends.We didn\u2019t see each other as lovers, but it was still something. It was the kind of relationship where even when we fought at home, we walked into the wedding hall with a smile.A lot about us worked well together, and we were quite fortunate. The nobility saw Sovieshu and I as only a pair of cubs, and we put our heads together and discussed the country we would build for the next generation. As an adult, Sovieshu inherited the throne from the late Emperor, and after the coronation ceremony we were on good terms.\u2026For about three years.***It was a bad day to plan for the new year.After consulting with the officials all day, I returned to my room to find my ladies-in-waiting with nervous expressions on their faces.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dI looked around worriedly, and one of the ladies replied in a sharp voice.\u201cThe Emperor went hunting and brought back a tramp.\u201d\u201cThen he called us and ordered us to wash the dirty thing.\u201dAll the ladies-in-waiting were the concubines and wives of high-ranking noble families, and they bathed only me. For ladies that did not even use their own hands to bathe themselves, it must have been a bolt from blue. But it was quite strange. The emperor knew the pride of the ladies-in-waiting better than anyone else, yet he ordered them to wash a woman he brought back after hunting?\u201cWhat woman?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know if she\u2019s a prisoner or a slave.\u201d\u201cHer leg was trapped.\u201d\u201cLeg?\u201d\u201cYes. The emperor found her caught in a trap and saved her\u2026\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting exchanged glances among themselves. There seemed to want to say more, but didn\u2019t want to do it in front of me.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Tell me.\u201dAfter some slight pressure, one of them reluctantly opened her mouth.\u201cEven when she was filthy she seemed beautiful. I thought I imagined it even before I washed her, but she really was stunning when I was finished.\u201d\u201cHer beauty was comparable to the Duchess Tuania, the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201dWhen they thought I was feeling uncomfortable, the ladies added their own chorus.\u201cOf course there is no comparison with you, Your Majesty.\u201dMy face was rather attractive. However, as a young princess and an empress, everyone tended to flatter me, so it was unclear exactly how beautiful I was. As a result I would exclude myself from such comparisons.However, Duchess Tuania was known as the most beautiful woman in society. She debuted at the age of seventeen, and she was still an immaculate butterfly at the age of forty.And now this mysterious woman was equivalent to Duchess Tuania? And even these high-nosed ladies thought so?Perhaps the Emperor really did save a great beauty from the hunting ground. There was no reason for my ladies-in-waiting to notice if she was merely pretty.\u201cYou can tell me anything. I can see you all have more to say.\u201dWhen I prodded them again, another lady finally gathered up her courage and revealed everything.\u201cThe truth is\u2026the Emperor seems to be fond of her.\u201dThe lady\u2019s face whitened as if she were terrified to let the words leave her mouth.\u201cThe Emperor?\u201d\u201cAfter washing her, I dressed her with clothing from someone with a similar size, and when His Majesty saw her he seemed concerned. \u2018How did you get hurt? Why are you so thin? You look pale\u2026\u2019\u201d\u201cThat sounds reasonable.\u201dAt my remark the ladies exchanged awkward glances between themselves.\u201cYou have not been in adulthood long and may not have experienced a romantic relationship but\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is a certain nuance and atmosphere, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWe are on your side, even if it\u2019s difficult to hear about this.\u201d\u201cAnd if it turns out to be nothing then it will be fine.\u201dAmong the ladies-in-waiting, the only one my age was Lady Laura, and the rest were older than I. Their wisdom was richer than mine when it came to human affairs.\u201cI see\u2026\u201dI murmured in my embarrassment. Even if what the ladies said was true and that the Emperor was interested in another woman he saved, what should I do? Should I go to the Emperor\u2019s room and ask him if he was interested in his captive, or drive her out, or have her work in the imperial palace? I didn\u2019t know how to react.Countess Eliza approached carefully.\u201cHow about you try your luck and say that you heard he found an injured woman?\u201dEveryone agreed and said I should ask in passing.\u201cMaybe say you heard it from one of the palace maids\u2026\u201d\u201cJust in case.\u201dI nodded and smiled, praying it would not be a large issue.\u201cI will. Thank you all. His Majesty the Emperor is a compassionate man, so he must have brought her here out of pity.\u201d***When would it be a good time to ask the Emperor about the woman he found at the hunting ground? After much consideration, I decided to ask him at dinner tomorrow. Although we were husband and wife, our rooms were separated on the east and west. It was said that the rooms were placed to show that the monarchy symbolically supported each side of the country. That meaning had now faded, and now it was a perfect arrangement for the emperor and empress to live without having to touch each other.Although Sovieshu did not yet have a concubine, we ate and slept separately due to our busy schedules and different lifestyles. However, we had dinner twice a week, and that was tomorrow.Yes. It would be too meddlesome for me to visit today and ask about the woman from hunting ground. I will wait a day. I hadn\u2019t forgotten what my mother said to me before I was married.\u201cDo not interfere with Sovieshu even if he takes a concubine later.\u201d\u201cIs that really alright?\u201d\u201cLook at history. Were there any emperors without concubines? Even Ossis II, who is known as a great military leader, has had twenty of them. Do not waste your anger on it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNavier. All you have to be for Sovieshu is be young and beautiful\u2026and healthy. Do you understand my words? You can find a man like that and make him your lover.\u201dA commoner would widen their eyes at this kind of drama, but this was natural in noble society where political marriages were the norm.Of course, the right of inheritance would go to the children of the married couple, but problems arose when a spouse was in love with their partner and couldn\u2019t tolerate other lovers. Political conflicts happened that way. This must have been part of my mother\u2019s concern. And so, on her advice, I was not going to go see Sovieshu today. I would ask him tomorrow evening instead.And even if he took the woman as his concubine\u2026I should pretend to ignore it.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was not in love with him. I knew other people lived like me.Still, when I thought about my husband taking another woman as his lover, there was a lonesome feeling in the corner of my heart. Strange.I lifted my hand and placed it on my breast. My heart beat neither slow nor fast.***The next day, rumors of the \u201chunting ground girl\u201d spread even faster. The only ones who spoke openly about it to me were my ladies-in-waiting, but even when sitting in a quiet place I could hear the gossip among the palace.During lunch, the ladies-in-waiting complained throughout the meal.\u201cI heard that filthy tramp is a runaway slave. She must have gotten onto the hunting ground while fleeing.\u201d\u201cThe hunting ground is connected to Viscount Roteschu\u2019s estate, so she must have escaped from there.\u201d\u201cIf she\u2019s a runaway slave, she should be sent back immediately. I can\u2019t believe the Emperor took pity on her and made us take care of her.\u201dBefore dinnertime, the ladies dressed me more methodically than usual. They clothed me in a glittering dress and adorned me with silver jewelry and simple pearl earrings, showering me with praise throughout. They always cared for me, but today they seemed especially adamant.\u201cNo matter how beautiful the slave is, you are our Empress.\u201d\u201cThe Emperor will have to wash his eyes after he sees you.\u201dTheir efforts felt empty and passed through my ears. If Sovieshu was going to fall in love with me for dressing beautifully, shouldn\u2019t he have already done so before?All I had in my head were useless thoughts. However, even though I considered the efforts of the handmaids to be futile, I entrusted myself to them.After all the preparations were finished, I went to the eastern palace where the Emperor stayed, and sat at a dining table that was far too large for two people. At first we only talked about recent political issues, such as the preparations for New Year\u2019s Day. I waited for Sovieshu to bring up the story about the hunting ground girl, but no matter how long I waited, he didn\u2019t mention her.It was when he was cutting his steak that I finally brought it up.\u201cI heard that you found a runaway slave at the hunting grounds. Is that true?\u201dThere was a clack as his knife hit the plate, and his hands stopped. He looked up and stared at me for a moment.\u201cWho told you that?\u201dHis tone wasn\u2019t pleasant. In fact, he seemed rather tense.Seeing the wrinkle between his eyebrows, I deliberately covered up the source of the story.\u201cEveryone was talking. It was hard to miss.\u201d\u201cIt must have been your ladies-in-waiting.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who told me. Again, is it true?\u201dSovieshu looked noticeably uncomfortable when I repeated my question.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t rush me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you heard, but what happened was that I found a woman who was badly hurt and I helped her.\u201dHe called her a woman, not a runaway slave\u2026\u201cI see. So where is she now?\u201d\u201cEmpress.\u201d\u201c\u2026Please tell me.\u201d\u201cWe have two meals a week together. We have so many other things to talk about, don\u2019t you think?\u201dThe iciness in his voice was clear to me.Do not get involved in this in any way.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Your Majesty, I did not suggest anything unusual. As the owner of the Imperial Palace, I am only asking if you brought in an injured woman. It\u2019s never happened before.\u201dWas I overdoing it? I had my usual tone and gentle smile on my lips. I spoke casually in order not to appear overbearing, as if discussing the New Year\u2019s Day preparations.Sovieshu looked markedly uneasy, however. He seemed to want to avoid the topic as much as possible, and the atmosphere became increasingly uncomfortable.\u201cAre you asking because you\u2019re only curious?\u201dSovieshu looked at me suspiciously, and I blinked at him.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be asking if I wasn\u2019t curious.\u201d\u201cShe was accidentally caught in one of my traps, and I brought her here so she could be treated. She\u2019s not too injured, so I\u2019ve had her put in a room with a maid to look after her.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t call your ladies-in-waiting again.\u201dSovieshu resumed cutting his steak, the knife cracking like a woodpecker and echoing in the dining room. He usually had so much to talk about, but this time he remained silent.*Advertisement**\u201cWhat did His Majesty say?\u201dAdvertisementWhen I returned to the west palace after dinner, a group of my ladies-in-waiting who were gathered in my room anxiously approached me.\u201cHe\u2026he didn\u2019t say much.\u201dCountess Eliza\u2019s eyebrows lifted at my lukewarm answer. She didn\u2019t seem to believe me.\u201cThen you would not be so sullen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Talk to us, Your Majesty. That way we can be prepared.\u201d\u201cHe said the woman was accidentally caught in one of his traps. There was no mention of her being a runaway slave or anything like that\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t even get a name.Advertisement\u201cHe said he was taking care of her, and he seemed unhappy to keep talking about it.\u201dAs soon as I finished, Laura stamped her foot with a resounding thud. The other more genteel ladies gave her a look, but Laura was already pouting and not paying attention to them.\u201cYour Majesty, do you know that\u2019s exactly what my father was doing at the beginning of his affair?\u201dLaura raised her voice and Countess Eliza said her name in warning. Laura, however, had already gone this far and wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like. Those are exactly the early signs of an affair. Why wouldn\u2019t he want to talk about it?\u201dThe ladies scolded Laura for talking too bluntly, but they did not deny her words.Countess Eliza finally took it upon herself to shoo the ladies out when I was looking depressed, then sat me in front of the dressing table and started combing my hair.Advertisement\u201cThe Emperor is a man who likes to hunt. He is doing this because it must seem like a miracle to him to find a beautiful woman caught in his trap.\u201d\u201cCountess.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cBefore\u2026my mother told me. Even if the Emperor takes another woman as his lover, I should not let myself be hurt. There are so many cases like that, and I shouldn\u2019t expect it to be any different.\u201dThe middle of Countess Eliza\u2019s forehead creased. Countess Eliza had a rare marriage of love to her husband, and to such a person, my mother\u2019s advice might sound ridiculous.I continued.\u201cI didn\u2019t say this in front of the other ladies, but I am a little prepared. Even if the Emperor welcomes a slave woman as his concubine.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cBut when he doesn\u2019t speak to me\u2026I feel a little down.\u201dCountess Eliza set the comb down on the dresser. I looked up at her and asked her honestly.\u201cWhether he has ten or a hundred concubines, they\u2019re still concubines and I\u2019m the empress. He and I never loved each other to the point that we would die for each other\u2026so theoretically, we should still be fine. Yet why do I feel so empty?\u201dCountess Eliza reached out to embrace my head and shoulders. She held me still for a moment, then withdrew before speaking.\u201cEven though yours is a political marriage, you\u2019ve been together since you were children up until marriage. It\u2019s no surprise that you\u2019re upset. I would feel the same if my child were to bring someone else in as their foster parent. I would feel upset if my parents took another child and favored them because they were more beautiful. And I would feel upset if my best friend brought someone else in and was more friendly to them. It\u2019s a natural emotion.\u201d\u201cThen would the Emperor feel that way if I had another man next to me?\u201dCountess Eliza picked up the comb and started brushing my hair again, and I took her silence as a \u201cno.\u201d After a moment, she finally spoke.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know, Your Majesty. The more powerful your love is, the harder it is to look around.\u201dSo I had no choice but to deal with my heartbreak by myself. I forced myself to smile.\u201cI see. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll feel better soon. She and I won\u2019t have to meet each other\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Even if the slave becomes a concubine, she still cannot enter into high society.\u201dBeing a slave didn\u2019t mean one couldn\u2019t rise in status. It was also the case for the innocent who became slaves due to collective punishment caused by their family members. Every year, the country restored a certain number of slaves to commoner status, but it was never the case for a runaway slave.Being a slave meant that one had a life sentence for some crime they committed. Because a runaway slave escaped without paying the price, they were considered the same as an escaped prisoner. An extra charge of guilt was added, and a runaway slave was considered the dregs of society to aristocrats. No matter how much Sovieshu lavished the woman, there was no opportunity for her to debut in high society or for me to run into her. I nodded my head and gathered myself.Yes, Countess Eliza. It was natural that I felt empty when someone who had been my husband for a long time had a sudden interest in another lover.But I couldn\u2019t get more emotional now. No matter if he had another woman, he couldn\u2019t cut me off. There was only one Empress in this empire after all.***\u201cThe Emperor goes to see the slave day after day?\u201d\u201cI heard he even brings her food himself.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s acting so calm too. The audacity.\u201d\u201cHe even called a court doctor to treat her leg.\u201dThere were voices whispering between the bushes. Although the Imperial Palace gardens had flowering walls higher than one\u2019s head, I could still hear the gossip that filtered through. I designed this garden myself, and deliberately placed a nest-shaped swing chair in an area not frequented by many. It was like my secret place. I didn\u2019t bring my ladies-in-waiting here, and so people said things aloud without them noticing me.\u2018About a week has passed\u2026\u2019I closed my book and placed it on my lap. As Sovieshu\u2019s interest in the slave woman grew, so did the stories. Everyone\u2019s attention was on the woman who managed to capture the Emperor\u2019s interest. Wasn\u2019t it fortunate that she and I never ran into each other?The next time I had dinner with Sovieshu, I didn\u2019t ask about her. I instead I acted as if nothing had happened, and brought up the New Year\u2019s preparations.I decided to compromise at this point in time. Ignorance. Pretend I didn\u2019t know.But coincidence came out of nowhere and confronted me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Early Signs Of An Affair (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was the day all the officials and I gathered in the conference room to discuss the preparations for the upcoming New Year.My throat felt clogged after speaking for so long, and after drinking a glass of warm water, I took a walk in the central palace garden to relax. Artina, the deputy commander of the knights, accompanied me, along with my ladies-in-waiting. As I discussed with Artina about whom to recommend for the ceremony, I heard a whisper from somewhere saying, \u201cIs that her?\u201dI looked around, and saw a woman sitting in a wheelchair with two other women who appeared to be maids beside her. Our eyes met, and the woman in the wheelchair struggled stand. The two maids tried to stop her, but they dropped their hands when they saw my gaze.The woman shakily gripped the handles of the wheelchair as she stood up to bow in greeting. I wasn\u2019t sure who she was. I thought she might be the slave the Emperor found, but we were near the central palace, and this was no place for a mistress to come. I didn\u2019t think there were any cases of one even working at a high position at the central palace.Still, she greeted me even when her legs were hurt, and so I gave her a nod of acknowledgment. I turned to walk away when I heard a voice from behind me saying, \u201cHey.\u201d\u2018Hey?\u2019Was she calling me? This was the first time I heard someone say that to me in the palace after becoming empress. I turned back, flustered, and saw the woman in the wheelchair wheeling herself towards me. The maids were bewildered and called out \u201cRashta, don\u2019t,\u201d but she ignored them.Did she have something to do with me? If she did, then surely she would know I was the empress. And yet she said \u201cHey\u201d to me?I stared at her with a perplexed expression on my face, and the woman named Rashta drew near and greeted me again.\u201cI\u2019m Rashta.\u201dWhat was I supposed to do?Advertisement\u201cYes\u2026Rashta.\u201dShe smiled, as if pleased that I called her by her first name. Did she really want me to address her like that? I was struck by curiosity, but not enough to ask why.The audience time had ended, and my brain was rotted having listened to the stories of strangers for three hours. If there was an emergency, then she would have pleaded for help as soon as she saw me. However, she was smiling cheerfully, so it didn\u2019t seem like she needed my urgent attention.AdvertisementI turned around again, thinking there was nothing more to see. But as I did so, she reached out and grabbed the skirt of my dress. My ladies-in-waiting who were standing beside me were alarmed and beat away her hand as if she were a zoo monkey.\u201cHow rude!\u201d\u201cDo you not recognize this noble!\u201dRashta flinched back in surprise, stammering.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve called out to you but I don\u2019t know your name\u2026\u201dShe really didn\u2019t know I was the empress? Didn\u2019t I hear her whisper to the maid \u201cIs that her?\u201dLaura glared at Rashta and yelled at her.\u201cThis is Her Majesty the Empress. Be careful of your actions!\u201dAdvertisementRashta\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhat? I\u2026I know the Empress.\u201dShe knows the Empress?I frowned at her strange words, and she looked into my eyes and spoke softly.\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m Rashta.\u201dWho was Rashta? My ladies-in-waiting and I were terribly confused. Did we know each other enough to share our names? In my mind I tried to recall the women of her age that visited this country with foreign dignitaries. I did not meet with every single guest. There were the guests that were welcomed by me, guests that were welcomed by the foreign ministers, guests that met with Sovieshu directly\u2026She had never been one of my mine. Had the foreign minister ever met a Rashta? It couldn\u2019t be. If she were from a great noble family, even the ladies-in-waiting would know about her even if I didn\u2019t.Advertisement\u201cDo you know me?\u201dI decided to be straightforward with her, and she looked surprised.\u201cYou don\u2019t know me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRashta looked at a loss, and she whispered to the maids, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I could hear her, of course.But I was tired. I didn\u2019t even know who she was. I was about to ignore her and leave, when Rashta called out again.\u201cI am living in the eastern palace by the kindness of His Majesty the Emperor.\u201dThe kindness of Sovieshu?The eastern palace. The wounded legs. The woman. Ah.\u201cThe slave?\u201dThen why was she near the central palace? Before I could ask, Rashta\u2019s face paled.\u201cYour Majesty, forgive me for my rudeness. Miss Rashta is not a slave.\u201dA maid beside Rasta came forward and corrected me. Not a slave? But my ladies-in-waiting told me she was a runaway slave. If they were false rumors, then they would have informed me it was not a credible story, but there was no such statement.The slave\u2026was more than what I expected. I didn\u2019t expect to meet her this way. I didn\u2019t care about the gossip, but she was as beautiful as the rumors suggested. Her kind of beauty wasn\u2019t like the glamour and elegance of a noble like Duchess Tuania, rather, Rashta\u2019s image was soft and ethereal. Her large, dark eyes stirred one\u2019s protective instincts, and her hair was a light silver that made her pure and innocent charm even more mysterious.Wait. My ladies-in-waiting bathed her, so why didn\u2019t they recognize her? I glanced around and saw some weren\u2019t with me. Unfortunately, the missing ladies were the ones that washed Rashta.\u201cYes. Now I know who you are.\u201dI nodded, and Rashta beamed.\u201cThank goodness. Actually, I\u2019ve been wondering when we\u2019d meet each other.\u201d\u201cMeet?\u201d\u201cI asked the Emperor, but he kept telling me that I didn\u2019t have to bother\u2026but I thought we should still do so.\u201dMeet each other? Why?\u201cWhat should I call you, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just call me \u2018Your Majesty.\u2019\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why I was having such a friendly conversation with this girl of all people.Rashta seemed to feel tired and wanted to turn around, and she grunted in exertion as she moved her wheelchair.Sensing that my mood was spoiled, my ladies-in-waiting grabbed onto the handles of the wheelchair and pulled her slightly backwards.\u201cStay away.\u201d\u201cJust who are you to act so friendly towards her?\u201dLaura\u2019s hands were trembling in anger as she pulled the other woman back.\u201cFilthy.\u201dIt was then.\u201cWhat do you mean, filthy?\u201dSovieshu appeared, his voice like shards of ice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Compare With Whom? (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Emperor witnessed Laura insulting the woman he was in love with. It was quite a scene.Laura and other ladies-in-waiting quickly lifted their skirts to bow to him, but he gave them a hellish glare. I had already seen Sovieshu a few times earlier in the palace, and I stared at him quietly instead of greeting him again. Sovieshu looked at Laura then turned to Rashta.\u201cGoodness.\u201dSovieshu sighed. Rashta\u2019s eyes were wet, probably out of surprise, and the wide look she gave him made her look like a poor frightened animal.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dDespite his attempt to soothe her, tears began to drip down her face.\u201cI said don\u2019t cry.\u201dDespite the unsympathetic tone in his voice, Rashta did not stop. She seemed unafraid of his infamous cold attitude. I kept staring at her. When Rashta continued to cry, to my surprise, Sovieshu pulled out a gold embroidered handkerchief and held it out to her. Her tears didn\u2019t cease even when offered the handkerchief, and he sighed and wiped her face himself.\u201cYou\u2019re a handful.\u201dThere was a note of worry in his tone, and the corner of my heart throbbed again. No, it was natural\u2026it was natural. I reminded myself of Countess Eliza\u2019s words, and turned around and instructed my ladies-in-waiting to follow.\u201cLet\u2019s go. My legs ache.\u201dAdvertisementI wouldn\u2019t be able to stop Sovieshu from having a concubine, but I was free to avert my eyes from it. The ladies quickly followed after me.\u201cWait. Stop.\u201dSovieshu called out to me before we had even taken a few steps. First Rashta, and now him? Sovieshu glared at Laura and pointed to her.Advertisement\u201cLeave that lady-in-waiting behind, Empress.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cLeave her.\u201d\u201cShe is my lady-in-waiting. You need to tell me first.\u201dLaura\u2019s complexion turned pale. I also felt an ominous wind blowing through my thoughts.Surely he wouldn\u2019t punish Laura for what she said to Rashta, would he? While Laura\u2019s behavior was not exactly exemplary, she was still a lady-in-waiting of the Empress. Rashta, on the other hand, was not yet a concubine, nor was she even lower nobility. She was even likely a runaway slave. For Sovieshu to punish Laura would publicly disgrace her in society.As well as myself, the Empress.I stared at him, and he turned his gaze back to Laura.Advertisement\u201cShe is a lady-in-waiting of the Empress, but she is also my subject. How dare she speak like that.\u201d\u201cThen I will scold her.\u201d\u201cYou think a scolding will fix someone who calls another person filthy? Surely not.\u201dSovieshu barked an order to a nearby guard, pointing his chin towards Laura.\u201cLock her up for three days and give her only water and hard bread.\u201dLaura\u2019s face whitened, and the other ladies let out a small scream of distress.\u201cThat is too far, Your Majesty.\u201dAdvertisementI stepped forward, but Sovieshu directed his icy glare towards me.\u201cShe called a woman in a wheelchair who can\u2019t even properly walk filthy. Don\u2019t you think that is too far?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cWell, you only watched. You probably thought that was not too far.\u201d\u201cMy ladies-in-waiting only stopped her because she pulled my dress.\u201dThe look on Sovieshu\u2019s face only turned darker.\u201cYou were walking away from her.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cAnd what is wrong with holding a dress? Is the Empress\u2019 dress more noble than a human hand?\u201d\u201cThen I will have your servant pull at the hem of your cloak. Even if your cloak is not as noble as a human hand, is that still acceptable?\u201dSovieshu raised his eyebrows and smirked.\u201cYour words are meaningless. Do you really think it is the same situation?\u201d\u201cIs it different?\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cThen what is the difference?\u201d\u201cRashta is not a servant.\u201dI wanted to ask him if I should change my example, and what he would do if a concubine pulled on the hem of his clothes.\u201cLock up the Empress\u2019 lady-in-waiting for five days.\u201dBefore I could say anything else, Sovieshu increased Laura\u2019s punishment. The more I opposed him, the more he severe he became.I saw Rashta sitting behind Sovieshu with her eyes wide open, staring at him as if he was some sort of hero. The words I wanted to say threatened to leap from my mouth, but even the empress could not overturn the emperor\u2019s orders. I could call a trial to challenge Laura\u2019s punishment, but by the time the trial would be opened she would already be released.\u201cI accept the punishment, Your Majesty.\u201dAs I was agonizing about losing to Sovieshu, Laura quickly stepped forward. My face turned red with shame and anger.\u201cGo.\u201dRather than asking why the girl was near the main palace, Sovieshu complimented me for working hard all day.Sovieshu and I weren\u2019t passionate lovers, but we were good friends. Now we were neither. I gritted my teeth and turned away. Now I understood why my mother advised me not to get involved with the concubines.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Compare With Whom? (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Imperial Palace was buzzing over the news of Laura\u2019s confinement.The gossip was that the Emperor\u2019s punishment for the Empress\u2019 lady-in-waiting was an outright expression of his love for Rashta. It was her first unofficial competition with me, and she had won. I didn\u2019t hear this with my own ears, but my ladies-in-waiting were furious and told me about it.\u201cI should have been there!\u201dA lady-in-waiting who had bathed Rashta exclaimed that were she present, she would have kept me away from the slave.\u201cBut I think the Emperor really likes her.\u201d\u201cI used to have admiration for him, but this time he didn\u2019t even listen to the Empress\u2019 words.\u201dDespite their anger, the ladies-in-waiting were worried about the future.\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days since the Emperor met her. I\u2019m worried.\u201dThere was nothing I could do in this situation.Sovieshu and I acted like nothing had happened when we ran into each other at the central palace. I focused on my work and tried to forget what had happened that day. When I was alone in my room, I remembered Sovieshu\u2019s cold gaze and felt the bruise in my heart, but it ached less when I kept myself busy.When Laura\u2019s imprisonment finally ended after five days, I went up to the tower to retrieve her myself. I asked the other ladies-in-waiting to bathe Laura in my bathroom and bring her some soup. I also ordered Laura\u2019s favorite cake.AdvertisementA secretary sent by Sovieshu came to me to deliver a message.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor wants to see you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dAdvertisement\u201cYes.\u201dWhat could it be? I nodded and turned to Countess Eliza.\u201cWhen the cake is finished, tell Laura to come here and eat. Then let her know she can rest for a few days before she comes back.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dI turned and nodded at the secretary, and he quickly led the way. The atmosphere changed as we went east, even though it was surrounded by the same wall. Perhaps it was because the palace was styled in completely different ways.I was concerned that I might encounter Rashta again, but she was nowhere to be seen in Sovieshu\u2019s bedroom.The Emperor was sitting by a small round table.\u201cYou called me.\u201dAdvertisementSovieshu stared at me silently as I approached him. His eyes seemed full of things to say.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201dI spoke first, and Sovieshu seemed to hesitate for a moment and pressed his lips.\u201cYour lady-in-waiting, the one who was imprisoned\u2013\u201d\u201cLaura. The daughter of Marquis Tarital.\u201d\u201cI heard you took her back her from her prison.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my lady-in-waiting. She suffered for five days.\u201dSovieshu looked even more displeased.Advertisement\u201cDid you have to?\u201d\u201cAre you asking me if I had to take care of a woman that was punished?\u201dSovieshu could clearly hear the mockery in my voice.\u201cYou know what I\u2019m trying to say. In other words, you retrieved the lady-in-waiting yourself, even though you knew I would be offended. No?\u201dPartially. I suspected that Sovieshu might be offended\u2026but I also thought he might have already cooled down after five days. Perhaps after everything had settled, I could let him know that his punishment was far too much.Maybe not.\u201cI suspected you might be displeased.\u201d\u201cBut now you\u2019re taking care of her? If you had any thought for me, you would have sent her away. What is the emperor if the empress cares for the people he punishes?\u201d\u201cIt is not right to send someone away after they already received their punishment. Besides, what she did was not out of line.\u201d\u201cCalling people filthy?\u201d\u201cShe was trying to stop someone from pulling on my clothes. A scolding would be enough.\u201dThe more I spoke, the stonier his expression became.\u201cSo, you will keep the lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cIt is entirely up to me to decide who is my lady-in-waiting.\u201dAlthough Laura may want to quit working in the Imperial Palace, I was going to keep her for a while. Being punished because of a runaway slave was enough to make her an outcast of high society. If I let her go, she would have no protection, let alone against Sovieshu. As empress, I would use my name to safeguard her.Sovieshu sighed and turned away.\u201cI am tired of arguing with you. Can\u2019t you just be obedient to me for once?\u201d\u201cThe empress does not have to bend to the emperor\u2019s will.\u201d\u201cContinue on like this, and you won\u2019t even be able to compare.\u201dCompare? \u2026With whom?He stared right at me, then he put on a wry face.\u201cI see that you\u2019re tired. Please retire for the day. Go back to and take care of that misbehaving filly.\u201d***After Empress Navier left, Sovieshu sighed and rang a small bell on the table. The door opened, but it was not a servant who walked in the room.\u201cSince when do you work?\u201dAt Sovieshu\u2019s puzzled expression, Rashta smiled sheepishly.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m a burden when I\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re going to be working now?\u201dRashta spread out her arms joyfully, and Sovieshu grinned.\u201cYou can\u2019t even go around by yourself.\u201dServing the Emperor was regarded as a great honor among nobles, and was a position that even those without titles coveted. But Rashta wanted to work for the Emperor because she felt like a burden\u2026 She had no idea that the nobles would strangle each other over this position.\u201cWhat an unusual person.\u201dSovieshu chuckled at her oddity. For Sovieshu, there had only been two significant women in his life so far. One was his mother, a great empress, and the other was Navier, the current empress. He was familiar with the empress\u2019 imperial education and even studied together with Navier, but he thought the clumsy Rashta was incredible no matter what she did.\u201cCome here and have a snack.\u201dSovieshu rang the bell again, and the servant who had been waiting impatiently at the door came in.\u201cPumpkin pie. Very sweet. And bring wine. A light one.\u201dThe servant left to fulfill the orders, and Rashta clapped her hands and exclaimed \u201cPumpkin pie!\u201d\u201cDo you like food that much?\u201d\u201cNot just any food. How many people have never eaten a bite of a pumpkin pie in their life?\u201dShe smiled innocently like a child, and Sovieshu found he couldn\u2019t pull his eyes away from her.\u201cThe Empress doesn\u2019t even respond to jewelry, no matter how expensive it is. But you\u2019re still happy even with the little things.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t she like jewelry?\u201d\u201cShe does. But she doesn\u2019t have a lot of emotional ups and downs. She only expresses herself in small portions.\u201dRasta frowned and gave a sigh.\u201cShe grew up beautifully and doesn\u2019t know the harsh world. Anyone would take jewelry for granted.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that the Empress is wrong, it\u2019s just that she has a lot of wealth. Even if you got her a big gem, it\u2019s not a surprise\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Oh my god. My prey is smarter than I thought.\u201dRashta didn\u2019t know whether he was making fun of her or not, and she blushed and puffed out her lips.\u201cTch, you always call me prey.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re the prey I caught in my trap.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026Your Majesty.\u201dRasta laughed at his light joke, then settled to speak to him again. She twisted her fingers together and ventured forward carefully.\u201cYou said you\u2019d make me your concubine\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe Empress doesn\u2019t seem to know that yet\u2026\u201dSovieshu nodded and gave her a reassuring smile.\u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry, so let\u2019s take our time. Your legs haven\u2019t completely healed yet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not rushing, but\u2026I had a hard time when I met the Empress before. I didn\u2019t know how to introduce myself. And what if it happens again\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was neither cloudy nor rainy, nor warmer or colder. Today was just like yesterday and the day before yesterday.Unusual news came out of nowhere on this ordinary day.\u201cSo the Empress is busy with the New Year\u2019s preparations while Emperor takes in a concubine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cHe should at least have waited until New Year\u2019s was over.\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting were complaining darkly among themselves.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared silently at myself in the mirror. I was prepared for Sovieshu to make her his concubine\u2026but I didn\u2019t realize it would happen so soon. Judging by the timing, the ceremony might officially happen just before New Year\u2019s Day.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dA sighed emerged from deep inside me, and I felt nauseous at the thought of everyone coming up to me at New Year\u2019s Day to talk about it. And even if they did not speak about it to my face, I was sure to hear them whispering from behind. However, I could not ignore the fact that the Emperor was taking in a concubine no matter how much I disliked it.\u201cWhen is the ceremony?\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting glanced at each other, and eventually it was Countess Eliza who answered.\u201cRumor has it that he wants it to happen as soon as possible. He\u2019ll want it done before the New Year.\u201d***Around noontime, Sovieshu\u2019s secretary came up to me again to deliver a message. It was about the concubine, and the other officials kept an eye on us in an effort to catch some gossip.\u201cThe Emperor wants it to be simple, as there are other large events scheduled and time is tight.\u201d\u201cSimple?\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s concubines were not recognized as part of the Imperial Family, and her children were not recognized as prince or princess. The best that could happen was to earn favor and take the title of duke, but with no claim of succession.Even so, it was possible for a concubine to carry the emperor\u2019s child, and it was customary to hold a banquet. It was no wedding ceremony, however. The concubine would be the center of the attention of the banquet, and would later sign a contract notarized by the chancellor.\u201cIs the Emperor saying to hold a simple banquet or omit it altogether?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to invite a large number of guests at such a short notice, so we\u2019ll skip the banquet.\u201d\u201cIs there anything I need to handle if there isn\u2019t going to be a banquet?\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t. His Majesty said you needn\u2019t worry about it at all.\u201dAs far as I knew, omitting the banquet was not unusual. The inside of the hall would still be decorated in honor of the concubine that day, but instead it would be a smaller affair to dine with the Emperor, invite the people that were close to them, and sign the contract documents.But I needn\u2019t worry about it? Was it out of Sovieshu\u2019s pride or his consideration?\u201cTell him I received his message.\u201dThere was no harm to me. The secretary bowed and left. The other officials were staring at me, and when I glanced up, they hurriedly lowered their heads and pretended to go back to work.\u2018Do not tremble in front of them.\u2019They would whisper if I showed any signs of hurt. Even though the concubine was nipping away at my life, I didn\u2019t want them to think it was over just because my husband loved another woman.Placing on an indifferent expression, I reviewed the plan again and advised them on the necessary revisions.***\u201cThe Emperor will sign the contract first. Then you sign on the thin black line below his name.\u201dBaron Lant, one of the Emperor\u2019s secretaries, was put in charge in educating Rashta. When the Baron finished explaining the basic outline of the documents, Rashta\u2019s eyes widened and she let out a small wail.That was not usually a sound made by an aristocrat. Baron Lant stared at her for a moment, flustered, while tears streamed from Rashta\u2019s eyes.\u201cI understand what you mean, but\u2026Rashta has no signature.\u201d\u201cYou can make one.\u201dRashta\u2019s face turned red at the casual way he answered.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dBaron Lant finally realized why Rashta was struggling.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write?\u201dWhen Baron Lant was assigned to Rashta, the Emperor had told him she was a commoner, and so he assumed that she had basic education. Perhaps the rumors were true that this beautiful prey the Emperor favored was indeed a runaway slave. There wasn\u2019t much investment in teaching slaves how to read or write.\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know.\u201dHe wanted to ask her if she was a slave, but he smiled, pretending not to know, and set down a blank sheet of paper in front of her. It would not be easy to teach her to write in a few days, but she could quickly learn how to draw her name.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to spell your name, I\u2019ll write down several versions that sound like \u2018Rashta,\u2019 and you can choose one and memorize it.\u201dFortunately, Rashta quickly mastered spelling. It should\u2019ve been a frustrating task for someone who came from slavery, and Baron Lant was astonished.\u201cAm I doing alright?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing excellently.\u201dAfter praising her and receiving a smile in return, Baron Lant explained what she could expect from the signing ceremony.\u201cThere will be a big banquet and all the nobles will be there. Miss Rashta can invite as many friends as she wants.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cWhen the chancellor comes up to you and unfolds the government documents, you sign it.\u201d\u201cThe documents\u2013\u201d\u201cThe chancellor will keep it safe.\u201dRashta stamped her feet in delight and let out a small squeal. Baron Lant watched her for a moment before adding another thing.\u201cThis is not an obligation, but\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cSometimes the empress sends a gift to the emperor\u2019s concubine when she signs the contract.\u201d\u201cA gift?\u201d\u201cThe Empress is the owner of the palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom the viewpoint of the owner, a concubine is one that will live with them in the future. This means the concubine not only receives the emperor\u2019s respect and acknowledgment, but the empress\u2019 as well if she is given a gift. If there are several concubines, the ones that receive a gift from the empress are regarded as the top concubines.\u201dRashta suddenly looked insecure.\u201cSo Rashta will receive a gift from the Empress?\u201dYour votes are in.

After Sovieshu\u2019s secretary left, I researched any precedents, just in case. Even if there was a banquet, there was no obligation to give a gift. If there were multiple concubines, one could withhold gifts to prevent certain ones from building too much power or influence with the empress\u2019 close relatives.But the situation with Rashta was neither. In any case, I had no desire to give one at all, and Sovieshu had sent his secretary to tell me not to worry about it. Why couldn\u2019t I just say \u201cPlease take care of my husband\u201d?\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a reason to send one, but I won\u2019t.\u201dA satisfied look came over the ladies\u2019 faces.\u201cLaura would have been happy if she were here\u2026 I was thinking of going out of the palace today, so I\u2019ll tell Laura about it, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cHow is Laura?\u201d\u201cWhen I saw her the other day, she spoke angrily about \u2018that woman.\u2019\u201d\u201cMarchioness Tarithal is also furious and tells the story every time she has a tea party.\u201dI thought it better that they were on my side. Sovieshu and his aides would take good care of Rashta anyway, and I didn\u2019t think those close to me needed to be supportive of her.\u201cBy the way, Your Majesty\u2026may I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cRumor has it that the prince of Western Kingdom is coming for New Year\u2019s Day. Is that true?\u201dThe other ladies-in-waiting stopped talking and fixed their eyes on me. I nodded, and they squealed as they covered their faces or fanned themselves. I strained my lips to keep myself from smiling. The ladies-in-waiting had every reason to look forward to his appearance. The \u201cPrince of the West\u201d was the lone younger brother of the king, who was renowned for many things.\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cThey say eye contact is enough to put you under his spell.\u201d\u201cBut I hear he\u2019s quite stubborn. I wonder if even the current king of the Western Kingdom has given up on trying to get him married.\u201d\u201cAre the rumors of him being a seedless watermelon are true?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s a bit suspicious that the king hasn\u2019t had any children, and neither the prince when he\u2019s been with many women too.\u201dI nodded discreetly as I listened to the whispers of the ladies-in-waiting.The Western Kingdom was a country of great military power, virtually equal to that of our Eastern Empire. It terms of wealth, it was the richest in the world. The prince, who was said to be the first in line to the throne of such a place, had many rumors swirling about him.I left my thoughts of Sovieshu and his concubine behind and indulged in the sugary conversation of the ladies.***\u201cThere\u2019s no banquet?\u201dWhen Rashta asked Emperor Sovieshu how big the banquet would be and whether she could invite her friends, she was not prepared for this blow.\u201cBut the Baron said we were going to have a big party\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that it would be New Year\u2019s Day soon? I didn\u2019t want to rush this, but you were the one that wanted the signing ceremony as soon as possible.\u201d\u201c?\u201dDespite his explanation, Rashta only looked on in puzzlement. Sovieshu realized he was thinking too highly of her level of common sense. She seemed smarter than she appeared, but he had forgotten that she knew nothing about the nobility.\u201cIt\u2019s my mistake.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt is not easy to arrange a large banquet. There are other things I am busy preparing. Time is tight, and it\u2019s rude to have one large feast after another.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026! But is there another banquet on the same day as Rashta\u2019s signing ceremony?\u201d\u201cNew Year\u2019s Day will be soon.\u201dRashta turned crestfallen as her dreams of being congratulated by nobles at a lavish, grand banquet turned to dust. She had always wanted to see people flocking to her, and so she persuaded Sovieshu to have the ceremony as soon as possible. It was clear that the Emperor would be annoyed by this, and so Rashta did not show any signs of unhappiness and remained silent.However, her disappointment only increased on the day of the ceremony. Even if there wasn\u2019t a grand banquet, she still expected one of some sort. And when that didn\u2019t happen, she expected the Emperor shower her with apologies and a promise of gifts. There was neither a word of congratulations nor a gift from the Empress either. She felt sad as Baron Lant had told her that the palace\u2019s great halls were under the domain of the Empress.Rashta had diligently practiced her signature, but after signing the document she felt empty. When she finished, the chancellor immediately left, saying he had work to do. There was no cheering, applause, or the feeling of ecstasy as if she had everything in the world.Sovieshu also left with a \u201cThere\u2019s work I have to finish,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d When Rashta returned to her room, she buried her face in her hands.\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201dRashta\u2019s maids approached and asked her what was wrong, and the hurt that she had been holding inside her finally burst.\u201cThe Empress must hate me, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have skipped the banquet or the gift. Even if she doesn\u2019t give me a present, couldn\u2019t she show her face?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Rashta. Why are you crying on such a good day\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll rarely see her anyway.\u201dHowever, Rashta\u2019s hurt did not fade. When Sovieshu finally hurried to see her after he finished his work, he noticed she was in a somber mood.\u201cWhy does my prey look so down on this meaningful day?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, meaningful day? I haven\u2019t been congratulated by anyone\u2026\u201d\u201cNot congratulated by anyone? The chancellor congratulated you. He bowed to you, and the servants as well.\u201dBut what Rashta wanted was the congratulations of the nobles, not the servants. She wanted to be recognized by those who lifted their chins as if they were the best in the world.\u201cThe Empress must loathe Rashta\u2026\u201dAs Rasta\u2019s face grew gloomier, Sovieshu was forced to confess something.\u201cThe Empress didn\u2019t prepare a banquet or a gift because she hates you. I told her not to because it wasn\u2019t a good time.\u201dRashta nodded, but was clear that she didn\u2019t believe him. In this atmosphere, it was impossible for Sovieshu to relax and enjoy himself with his concubine.The next day, Sovieshu gave his secretary a gift, who in turn gave it to Rashta in the name of the Empress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - The Issue Of A Lady-In-Waiting (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYour Majesty, the Grand Duke Lilteang has sent you a gift of silk from a foreign land.\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting had finished preparing me for the day earlier than usual, so I sat with them as I drank my breakfast coffee. In the meanwhile, Prince Liltaiang had sent a servant bearing a gift.I looked up from my coffee cup and examine the item on the servant\u2019s outstretched hands. It was a gorgeous blue silk cloth that shone like the scales of a cutlassfish.I sighed and put down my coffee. The silk looked beautiful and expensive, but it was hard to accept it purely considering the intentions of the sender.Prince Liltiang was Sovieshu\u2019s uncle, and two years older than his nephew. Although he had no desire to be the emperor, he regularly bribed me and asked me for favors since I became the empress. If I accepted the gift, there was certain to be difficult demands attached to it.\u201cThank you, but tell him that I cannot accept it because it would cause a misunderstanding.\u201dThis had happened many times before, and the servant smiled awkwardly as if he expected it too. He murmured a respectful a \u201cYes\u201d and stepped back.\u201cThe gentleman hasn\u2019t gotten tired yet.\u201dWhen the door closed, Countess Eliza spoke her mind and the others burst into laughter. The atmosphere was so peaceful again.Quite unexpectedly, a second visitor was announced. I went to the central palace after breakfast every morning, so few visitors came here in the early hours. But two people in one morning? I allowed admittance of the visitor, although I remained curious.Fortunately, the second visitor was not a servant of a noble who offered bribes, but an official who came to coordinate the day\u2019s agenda. It was not a difficult task, and after exchanging a few words he left.To my surprise, a third visitor appeared.This time, it was Rashta, who I thought I would rarely meet face-to-face.\u201cRashta? Really?\u201dI looked back at the guard in surprise. He bowed his head and answered \u201cYes\u201d with a look of contempt. Countess Eliza clicked her tongue again.\u201cWhy does she dare came here?\u201dThe guard did not know; he only stood by the door and announced the arrival visitors. However, it seemed like he felt responsible telling me the news, and he had an embarrassed expression on his face. Countess Eliza turned to me anxiously.\u201cWill you receive her, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dFrankly, I did not want to meet her at all. Why should I be obligated to see someone that would only hurt my feelings? Someday, I may be able to laugh and talk with Sovieshu even if he has many beautiful concubines by his side. That time wasn\u2019t now, however, and it was still difficult for me to treat Sovieshu\u2019s lover in an easy manner.However\u2026\u201cLet her in.\u201dCountess Eliza cried out in surprise.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dI picked up the handle of the half-full cup of coffee. I did not want to see her, but Rashta was just a concubine, and Sovieshu\u2019s first love\u2026was it love? The first woman he loved. Sovieshu had been chilly towards me since she first appeared, and I did not want to fight with him again. Even if I could not love him passionately, I did not want to be hated by the Emperor. I could tolerate just this one visit.\u201cThis our second time meeting, Your Majesty. I am Rashta.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if she was pretending to neither know nor care about the incident Laura, but Rashta greeted me with a bright smile as soon as she came in.Countess Eliza did not hide her displeasure and sat back in stony silence, while I schooled my facial muscles into something as blank as possible. Fortunately, I had a great deal of practice in hiding my emotions in less than ideal situations.\u201d \u2026Unlike before, I am sure you are his concubine. Congratulations.\u201dI gave a mechanical greeting\u2026what was I supposed to say now? I thought over it for a moment and decided to go straight to the point.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cWhat brings me here?\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cYou and I are like sisters now, Your Majesty. Family.\u201dCountess Eliza was caught by surprise and choked on her cold coffee. She placed her hand in front of her mouth as she coughed and glared at Rashta. I was equally bewildered. What did I just hear? Sisters? Family?\u201cFamily?\u201d\u201cBecause we have the same husband. \u201dMy smooth face almost cracked. I fought to keep down a twitching nerve. The concubine contract was literally a contract, and they were not recognized as part of the Imperial Family. During the contract a concubine could receive a favorable amount of wealth, but if the contract was not extended, she had to leave the Imperial Palace. The children born by the concubine were not considered princes or princesses, even if they were fathered by the emperor.Yet now the girl considers us family just because we had the same husband? There were so many errors in that statement that I didn\u2019t even know where to start. As I tamed my thoughts, Rashta gathered both of her hands together.\u201cMay I call you sister?\u201dThe air chilled around me. I pressed my lips down. This was the limit of my generosity.\u201cNo.\u201dRashta\u2019s expression dropped. She blinked her eyes and stared at me as if in fright. As if she never anticipated answer like this. That was more amazing to me. She practically said, \u201cYes, let\u2019s be sisters. I took away your husband, but can we get along?\u201d\u201cIs it because you don\u2019t like Rashta?\u201dHer large, doe-like eyes began to well with tears.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter about hating you.\u201dOf course I hated her.\u201cYou may have become the Emperor\u2019s concubine, but are not my sister.\u201dI tried to explain this difficult truth with a smile, but Rashta only seemed to cry more. She must have thought I was ridiculing her. Smiling didn\u2019t work, so I wiped it away and decided to end our meeting there.\u201cLeave.\u201dAfter Rashta left, everyone in the room looked around in shock.\u201cIndeed\u2026I really don\u2019t know what to say about her.\u201dCountess Eliza was dumbfounded. And so were the other ladies-in-waiting. Most of them had never met an emperor\u2019s concubine before, let alone one that called on the empress. With a frown, I turned to the oldest lady-in-waiting.\u201cIs that what a concubine is like?\u201dAlthough I had been in and out of the Imperial Palace since I was young, I had never met any of the previous emperor\u2019s concubines while being educated in court. I hadn\u2019t been old enough to debut in society yet, and so I had nothing to do with the concubines of the late emperor.\u201cConcubines rarely see the empress. It would only hurt each other\u2019s feelings, and the concubines don\u2019t want to be disliked by her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMaybe Sovieshu liked a character like Rashta. Countess Eliza sighed.\u201cShe will need lady-in-waiting sooner or later. The Emperor says she is a commoner, but I am afraid she is not like a commoner at all. I wonder if any young woman would want to be the lady-in-waiting of the concubine\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is that how it\u2019s supposed to be, Baron Lant? Or does the Empress hate me?\u201dAfter the contract signing ceremony was over, it was Baron Lant that managed most of Rashta\u2019s affairs. He visited her today without any particular purpose, and was surprised when he heard this unexpected tale.\u201cYou visited the Empress?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026she sent a gift to Rashta. I thought I should go and greet her if she sent a gift\u2026\u201dBaron Lant groaned and pinched his forehead. Rashta tilted her head.\u201cWhat is it? Did Rashta do something wrong?\u201d\u201cWorse than that\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThe positions of Miss Rashta and the Empress are in opposition of each other.\u201d\u201cWhy? They both serve the same husband.\u201dIs that what Rashta said to the Empress! Baronet Lant was momentarily dizzy. However, Rashta\u2019s dark, huge eyes convinced him she acted out of innocence. One did not hold children accountable like adults. Rashta was more ignorant of aristocratic society than even aristocratic children, and so he had to show some consideration. But even so\u2026\u201cRashta, did anyone stop you when you said you were going to visit the Empress?\u201d\u201cCherily and Kisu?\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cRashta\u2019s maids. The Emperor assigned them.\u201d\u201cOther than those servant girls\u2026do you have a lady-in-waiting?\u201dRashta tilted her head again.\u201cNo?\u201dBaron Lant stood up from his seat with a determined look. On that note, he went back to Emperor Sovieshu and reported on his visit with Rashta.\u201cYour Majesty. Rashta is now your concubine, but she is ignorant of aristocratic society. She has her maids, but she is also in need of a lady-in-waiting.\u201dAnother secretary listening from the side commented with, \u201cWould a noblewoman would want to serve a commoner like Rashta?\u201d\u201cRashta is not the first commoner to become a concubine.\u201dBaron Lant snapped back at the secretary, then turned to plead again with the Emperor.\u201cYou should at least give her a lady-in-waiting to guide her in aristocratic society.\u201dSovieshu made a sound of agreement.\u201cIt was something I had already been thinking about, Baron Lant.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cFind a lady-in-waiting that will be responsible for helping Rashta.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d***I was strolling through the gardens at the western palace, when I saw a large, handsome bird perched on a huge flower, picking its feathers.\u201cWhat a strange bird.\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting hadn\u2019t noticed it, as they were busy chattering on the futility of Sovieshu\u2019s secretaries trying to find a lady-in-waiting for Rashta.I approached it carefully by myself. When I reached out my hand, the bird quickly hopped on. It shook its wings and nuzzled its beak against the back of my hand, as if accustomed to humans.\u2018Was this bird raised by nobles?\u2019As I stroked its small head, I noticed a small piece of paper tied on its foot. I opened it, and found a handwritten note in small script.\u2013 I\u2019m a foreign guest who will arrive at New Year\u2019s Day. Wrote this after drinking.I let out a laugh, and the ladies-in-waiting came over to see what had happened.\u201cOh, that\u2019s new.\u201d\u201cPretty.\u201d\u201cWhat a handsome bird. What is it called?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s a bird that\u2019s difficult to tame\u2026isn\u2019t it used for hunting?\u201dWhen I showed them the letter, the ladies-in-waiting grinned and encouraged me to write back. I smiled broadly. Was this really from a drunk foreigner? There will be many foreign ambassadors arriving here for New Year\u2019s Day, so it wouldn\u2019t be unusual\u2026Usually the birds flew towards a bird pagoda that gave off a unique scent that attracted them. It was amazing how this bird flew all this way. I took out a small pocket pen that I always carried with me, and another lady-in-waiting retrieved a piece of paper from nearby.\u2013 A drunken bird flies back. If it finds the right way, it will be better off than its master.The ladies craned their heads to watch me write the letter and burst out in laughter again. I tucked away the pen, watered the bird, then tied my note onto its leg. The bird nuzzled its beak against my hand again and flew away.\u201cHow adorable.\u201d\u201cThat bird seems to like the Empress.\u201d\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it amazing that it only goes to the Empress?\u201dWhen I returned to my room after listening to the ladies chatter about birds, I found one of Sovieshu\u2019s secretaries waiting for me.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dIt looked like he had been waiting for a while, and he answered immediately.\u201cThe Emperor has summoned you.\u201dThe ladies\u2019 faces hardened. As well as mine. The pleasure of seeing the handsome bird disappeared, and my heart became stiff. Before, I never minded when Sovieshu called for me, but now I couldn\u2019t help but think \u201cWhat else is going on?\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dRashta was now a concubine, and I turned away her attempts to be more friendly with me than was necessary. That was it. Shouldn\u2019t it be the end?\u2018Is he going to criticize me for not calling her my sister\u2026? No. No matter how much he thinks of her, it\u2019s not to that degree.\u2019Sovieshu had seen his mother as he grew up, and knew how empresses and concubines were like.\u201cPlease wait.\u201dAfter entering my room, I took off my walking dress and changed into a more formal one. Fortunately, I did not run across Rashta again when I followed the secretary to the Emperor\u2019s room.I walked in, and Sovieshu offered me a cup of tea and immediately entered into conversation.\u201cWhile concubines don\u2019t require a lady-in-waiting as much as the empress, they should still have one or two to attend to them. I\u2019m will give Rashta one or two as well.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. I see your secretaries are searching around.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yet after a few days, no noblewomen have come forward.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI think they are not coming forward because the Empress, the palace\u2019s owner, is not coming forward. So can the Empress herself find a lady-in-waiting for Rashta?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why should the Empress provide a lady-in-waiting for the concubine!\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting who heard my story shouted angrily. Countess Eliza, who suffered from high blood pressure, rubbed her hands behind her neck while Viscountess Verdi fanned her and spoke in a soothing voice.\u201cThank goodness Laura is not here. She is a fiery young woman and would act unbecomingly.\u201dI sat immobile and hadn\u2019t said a word, and the ladies gave me a nervous look.\u201cWhat are you going to do, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cAre you really going to find her a lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cNo one stepped forward when the Emperor\u2019s secretaries searched for one.\u201dI sighed.\u201cI wish I could say no\u2026but he gave me a direct order himself.\u201dAll the ladies had tears of indignation, but there was no other suitable way. I sighed again.A lady-in-waiting was usually of similar or lower rank than the noblewoman she was serving, but Rashta was not a noble at all. In this case, it would be appropriate to find one of the fallen or the lower nobles\u2026but that posed a problem as many of them could not get to the palace. I considered it over for another moment before turning to Countess Eliza.\u201cWe should start looking nearby, so please send an invitation to the young ladies and women in the capital.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d**\u201cA tea party with all the noblewomen?\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes rounded.\u201cAre you sure?\u201dCherily, the maid who had given her the news, answered with \u201cI told you already!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hosted by the Empress. You can\u2019t even imagine how grand it is. All the ladies of the capital have been gathering in the palace for hours. The invitations were sent out yesterday.\u201d\u201d \u2026What about Rashta?\u201d\u201cAh! Even if you are not a noble, Miss Rashta, you\u2019re still a person of His Majesty the Emperor\u2026this really is a shame.\u201dRashta\u2019s mouth turned downwards and her shoulders sagged.\u201cI thought so. The palace seemed to be noisy all day long\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Empress is being unfair. She skipped the banquet because of New Year\u2019s Day, but now she\u2019s having a party that excludes Miss Rashta.\u201dTea parties and banquets differed in size and expectations of guests, but to Cherily and Rashta, who did not know about this, a party was a party, and to them it was unfair that Rashta was not invited.Rashta pushed the floor with her toes and fell back onto her bed.\u201cRashta must be hated\u2026 \u201d\u201cThe Empress is just jealous because the Emperor loves you.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you dress up and go to the palace, too?\u201d\u201cBut Rashta wasn\u2019t invited\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs the Empress the only one that lives here? This is Rashta\u2019s home too.\u201dThe two maids took turns thinking up a plan, but Rashta shook her head and pulled the covers over herself.\u201cNo. They don\u2019t want me.\u201dThe maids\u2019 eyes watered sympathetically.\u201cPoor Miss Rashta\u2026\u201d***Although only noblewomen were invited, the number of guests exceeded my expectations as women of high or low rank attended. I didn\u2019t even know the names or faces of some of them, as they rarely made appearances in society.The garden boasted a spread of puddings, jellies, and chocolates so that everyone could walk around and eat. At first, everyone seemed a little surprised to see a buffet layout at a tea party, but soon they were laughing and talking among themselves in amusement. When the time came, I called for their attention.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor has asked me to provide a lady-in-waiting for his concubine, Miss Rashta. Because it has to be before New Year\u2019s Day, I cannot search far away for one. Is there anyone of your acquaintance who would want to be a companion for Miss Rashta?\u201dI did not directly say, \u201cWho among you wants to be Miss Rashta\u2019s lady-in-waiting?\u201d Although the standards were lower than usual, those who lived in the capital city still had a certain amount of pride in their position. The nobles of the capital were not higher than the nobles of the provinces either, and there would be no one who would want to take the position below a commoner concubine. And so I chose my words carefully.I finished and waited for someone to come forward. The women and young ladies exchanged glances, shaking their heads or shrugging their shoulders. Silence gripped the air. After an uncomfortable pause, Lady Alischute, Laura\u2019s best friend, cautiously spoke up.\u201cY-Your Majesty. This has been the talk for days, but\u2026please don\u2019t tell the Emperor what I\u2019m about to say. You musn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou may speak, Lady Alischute.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it rumored that she is a runaway slave? Someone may want to serve her even if she is a commoner, except if the rumors are true instead\u2026everyone is reluctant.\u201dThe other ladies nodded, putting in their own word or two.\u201cOne will not be able to carry face if they become the lady-in-waiting of a runaway slave, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cEven if there was someone suitable for the position, they\u2019ll end up getting slapped after that rumor.\u201d\u201cTo be the lady-in-waiting is not an honor, but an insult and a punishment.\u201dThe gossip seemed to have spread widely in society. The noblewomen hesitated before they asked me, \u201cIs the rumor true, Your Majesty?\u201dI told them Sovieshu\u2019s answer. She was a commoner who was injured by him on accident.In the evening, the ladies all returned to their homes and I went back to the palace. Tonight I would have dinner with Sovieshu, and I had better inform him that I was unable to find a lady-in-waiting for Rashta.To my surprise, there was no food on the dining table. Sovieshu was already seated. I looked down at the empty table, discomfited, and Sovieshu spoke to me in a calm voice.\u201cI heard the Empress summoned all the ladies and ate snacks for hours. I was worried that you would be full, and so I did not have the table set tonight.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI can eat with Rashta, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about Rashta\u2019s lady-in-waiting? Have you found one?\u201d\u201cI called all the women and young ladies, but none offered to serve, Your Majesty.\u201dSovieshu frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen there must be a reason.\u201d\u201cThe issue is not money.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dIf I spoke about the rumor that Rashta was a runaway slave, I would be betraying the trust of the other noblewomen. Lady Alischute had asked me to keep it a secret, and so I did not speak a single word of it.\u201cIt\u2019s only my assumption, but with the New Year\u2019s preparations going on, I don\u2019t think anyone wants to take care of anyone else for now. They would be twice as busy.\u201dSovieshu pondered for a moment then spoke in a half playful voice.\u201cDid the Empress say something strange when she called the noblewomen?\u201dAlthough he was pretending to be amused, there was a sharp under bite to his tone.\u201cOf course not. I do not know anything about your concubine, but I wouldn\u2019t say anything strange.\u201d\u201cPeople say things despite not knowing anything.\u201d\u201cThat is true. But there are some people that doubt their partner without hearing or seeing anything for themselves\u2026\u201dA flash of guilt crossed Sovieshu\u2019s face at the implied meaning of my words. We looked at each other in silence.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you say, then I won\u2019t doubt you.\u201dIt was Sovieshu that backed down first.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you either.\u201dI stepped down too, and Sovieshu smiled and looked at me reassuringly.\u201cI was just asking, so don\u2019t be offended.\u201dI was already offended, but if I fought openly with the Emperor I would lose. I concealed my crumpled pride, but nausea ran through my body.I gave him a mechanical smile and stood up from my seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You all must have female relatives. I want each of you to recommend two people for me.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s concubine was in an odd position, as both the subject of much attention and envy, as well as criticism and contempt. Sovieshu thought that Rashta\u2019s status as a commoner must have hurt the nobles\u2019 pride. For this reason, some emperors married their concubine to another aristocrate to forge a noble identity, but there was too much talk about Rashta to conceal her background. For a month or a year, the nobles would only pretend to be friendly to Rashta, so long as Sovieshu continued to care for her.Because no one would volunteer, he had no choice but to give an order.\u201cShe needs to have a peer, so be mindful about the age difference.\u201dThe servants and secretaries exchanged awkward glances among themselves.***\u201cYou\u2019re talking about this\u2026this runaway slave! Are you crazy?\u201d\u201cFather! How can you say that to Mother?\u201dBaron Lant\u2019s hands were trembling and sweating profusely.\u201cRunaway slave? No, she\u2019s not a runaway slave, she\u2019s a commoner\u2013\u201d\u201cEven if she\u2019s not a runaway slave, it\u2019s still a problem because everyone thinks so!\u201dBaroness Lant put her hands on her hips and glared at her husband.\u201cYou want me to serve a runaway slave? People will laugh at you, and our Jess, as well as me. The Baron Lant is below a slave!\u201dBaron Lant believed that Rashta was a charming and lovely woman, and that one day other nobles would fall for the new concubine. But that was the future, and it\u2019s clear that people in society today had a bad opinion of Rashta. Unfortunately, what Baroness Lant said was true.\u201cWhat about on your side, your niece Aesi\u2013\u201d\u201cAre suggesting we decide her future for her because she isn\u2019t your niece\u2026? Even among your extended family there are at least three nieces, no?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know their personalities. They aren\u2019t just someone you can put into another person\u2019s care.\u201d\u201cOh my, see this? What\u2019s the excuse now?\u201dAs the Baron and Baroness Lant argued with each other, the other servants and secretaries found themselves in similar circumstances. Everyone shook their heads while talking about the runaway slave. However, they weren\u2019t in the position to back down like the Empress. In the end, Count Pirnu and Baron Lant were ordered by the Emperor to bring their female relatives to the palace for a month.***I thought Sovieshu would force me to inquire the noblewomen again. But somehow, three days later, my ladies-in-waiting informed me that Count Pirnu\u2019s daughter and a Baron Lant\u2019s distant relative would serve as Rashta\u2019s companions. Setting aside Baron Lant\u2019s relative, it was surprising that Count Pirnu\u2019s daughter would take on the job.\u201cIsn\u2019t that young lady\u2019s name Helen?\u201dI knew that the Pirnu family was a strong household.\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dYet Helen somehow was the lady-in-waiting.\u201cHelen is inquisitive and has a good relationship with her father. Maybe she\u2019s here for the Count\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201dI nodded and did not bring it up anymore.Fortunately, a few hours later, I completely forgot about Rashta when I went for a walk and found the handsome bird once again. The ladies-in-waiting were amazed when the bird flew and hovered before me.\u201cOh, the bird\u2019s here again.\u201d\u201cSee how it goes to the Empress! Amazing.\u201dThe bird had another note on its leg.\u2013 But I\u2019m smarter than a bird. I\u2019m sobering up now.I chuckled as I read the note. It was for no big reason in particular, I just laughed.I watered the bird, then quickly wrote a reply.\u2013 Looks like you\u2019re not fully sober yet. What\u2019s the bird\u2019s name?The ladies giggled again after seeing my note. Everyone mused on whether it was fun to write such letters. I kissed the bird\u2019s small head and launched it into the sky, and it flapped its wings and flew away.This time I ended the letter with a question. Would the person who received the letter reply to me again?I liked to think so.***The name I temporarily forgot about arrived back in my ears not long after.\u201cEmpress. I\u2019ve come to ask you something about Rashta.\u201dI was busy discussing the New Year\u2019s preparations with the minister of finance when Sovieshu brought her up.\u201cIs it urgent?\u201dI glanced at my watch, as if I had already finished my work day. If it was not urgent, we could talk later. There was no rush about Rashta.Instead of replying to me, Sovieshu looked at the minister, who stood up awkwardly from his seat and walked away. All the other officials followed suit. In a moment, only the two of us were left in the room.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dSovieshu looked at me beyond the large table.\u201cAs I said, it\u2019s about Rashta.\u201dPlease, couldn\u2019t he solve the concubine\u2019s problems on his own? I nodded, pressing down the words in my throat.\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cDid you spread rumors that Rashta is a runaway slave?\u201d\u201cThat story again?\u201dExcept he was more specific than before. Last time he only asked if I said something strange. I looked at him in trepidation.\u201cNot only do Rashta\u2019s new ladies-in-waiting do not treat her properly, but they also don\u2019t act as ladies-in-waiting at all. \u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I don\u2019t want to be involved in any way with your concubine.\u201d\u201cBut why do they ignore Rashta at every turn, and compare everything she does to the Empress? Poor Rashta hid it and didn\u2019t say a word to me. If I hadn\u2019t seen the ladies\u2019-in-waiting behavior by accident, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was happening. \u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we ask the ladies-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cI asked, and they said they didn\u2019t want to serve a runaway slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026You are truly unreasonable.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sovieshu stared at me in amazement. My eyes were hot with unshed tears, but I bit my tongue to hold them back. The empress should not cry as a matter of pride.\u201cThey said they heard rumors, not that I said them. Are you blaming me for rumors for which you don\u2019t know the source?\u201d\u201cNo matter how much I think about it, there isn\u2019t anyone else but you who could benefit from it.\u201d\u201cWhat would I gain?\u201d\u201cRashta is like a romantic rival to you, is she not?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it you who told me the story of Rashta being a runaway slave? You never said a word about the source of the rumor then. I didn\u2019t know before, but it could have been you from the beginning.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s accusation was one-sided and insulting. I managed to steady my breath and keep my composure. But the more I tried to keep calm, the more suspicious Sovieshu seemed to be of me. It took a moment, but finally I managed to force out a voice that sounded normal.\u201cYour concubine is not a rival to me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou are not my lover, so how can she be a threat to me?\u201dSovieshu\u2019s expression wavered. I straightened my back and gave him a smile practiced hundreds of times in front of a mirror.\u201cThe concubine is precious to you, while I am just like everyone else. I am tiring of this, so let me say it again, Your Majesty\u2013don\u2019t get me involved with you and your concubine.\u201dI whirled around and saw myself through the door. The finance minister was nervously pacing down the hallway, and he turned his head in my direction. His eyes widened when his gaze fell upon me. It was obvious that I couldn\u2019t manage my facial expressions.I smiled at him, then quickly left the hallway and made to the western grounds. I ran to my secluded nest chair where there were no ladies-in-waiting and buried myself inside. I hugged my body, and stifled my sobs as best I could. The empress does not cry. She does not cry in front of others. In my head, Sovieshu and his concubine were so small and unimportant that they could not shake me. But in my heart, there was a hole.Eventually, it turned dark. I stayed cocooned in my chair for a long time. I was sure that my ladies-in-waiting were searching for me, and I slowly unfolded my body. After sitting curled in one position for hours, my arms and legs were as stiff as a wooden doll.Then, there was a piercing shriek from afar. I looked up from my nest chair, and saw a large bird coming down from the sky.\u201cAh!\u201dIt was the handsome bird, the one that brought the note from the drunken foreigner. It headed for me again, then landed in my lap and peered at me up close. It looked so adorable that I burst into giggles, and the bird blinked its large eyes and tilted its head.\u201cYou came to see me.\u201dAgain, a note was tied to the bird\u2019s leg. I unfurled the note and saw written in neat script,\u2013 Does it need a name? You can give it one if necessary.I studied the bird, and the bird looked back at me. Its gaze felt more penetrating than usual. Did it know that I was feeling depressed?\u201cBird.\u201d\u2013 \u2026\u201cBird.\u201d\u2013 \u2026I looked into its bright eyes, and almost believed that it understood me.No, that was foolish\u2026but intelligent birds could understand people, right? I hesitated for a moment, looked around, then hugged the bird and whispered to its feathery head.\u201cThis\u2026is my secret place.\u201dThe bird shifted and gave me a blank look. I petted the bird\u2019s back, and continued again awkwardly.\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I can cry. But here I can cry to my heart\u2019s content. It\u2019s a secret, so don\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201dThe bird blinked its large eyes again. Then, it slowly lifted a wing and brushed it against my cheek as if to comfort me, and I smiled.\u201cNice bird.\u201dI kissed its head in gratitude, and the bird made a funny squawking noise and tapped the note with its beak.Did it want a reply? It was a really clever creature. Fortunately, I carried note paper and a pocket pen with me. I took them out, meditated on the right name for the bird, and wrote it down.\u2013 The bird\u2019s name is \u2018Queen.\u2019When I finished the note, I looked up to see the bird staring at my writing as if it could read the letters. The bird tapped the word \u201cQueen\u201d with a large claw.\u201cThat\u2019s your name. If you could give this to your master.\u201dI tied the note to the bird\u2019s leg, then gently hugged it again.The empress. Yes\u2026no matter what happened, I was the empress. No matter what Sovieshu said, the concubine was the concubine and the empress was the empress. I pulled out a handkerchief, patted the swollen area around my eyes, and took a breath. Remember what my mother said \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t get involved with them.\u201cPeople don\u2019t expect me to be an Empress that is loved by the Emperor.\u201d\u2014 !\u201cMy goal in life is not to be loved by the Emperor, either. \u201cI had learned and lived to be the most perfect empress. I was human, and I would be hurt, but I couldn\u2019t sink into despair. I already had enough pity for myself. Now I had to get up.I drew my breath, kissed the bird\u2019s head again, and let it fly into the sky. The bird seemed unwilling to part with me for a moment and circled once over my head, but it finally turned away and flew far away.I practiced my smile once more, then returned to the palace.***The large bird flew straight to a nearby mountain. It skimmed the trees until it found a suitable outcrop, which was already occupied with a flock of birds, and landed there. The appearance of the large bird sent the other smaller birds scattering, and the large bird perched itself on a rock in the open space.Then, incredibly, the bird transformed into a young man. He was handsome, extremely so, and his entire body was finely proportioned and shaped with well-defined muscles.\u201cCalling a male \u2018Queen.\u2019\u201dThe young man grumbled to himself and scratched his head. A bluebird, which was sitting on a nearby tree, hopped down and also transformed into a man, this time with blue hair. The blue-haired man pulled a red cape from another tree and started to scold the other.\u201cWhat do you mean? You said you were going to scout. You didn\u2019t go anywhere else, did you\u2013\u201d\u201cO-oh. No, I\u2019ve been scouting.\u201d\u201cFor beauties?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I went to the palace, the palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you sure?\u201dThe handsome young man grimaced when the blue-haired man stared at him distrustfully.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201dThe blue-haired man swung the red cape around the young man\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThat will never happen. But please pay attention to your actions, Your Highness. Remember that you are the heir to the Western Kingdom.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I searched all over my room, but I couldn\u2019t find the handkerchief I usually carried with me. I went to work as usual at the central palace, then headed to the western garden during lunch.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. The Empress won\u2019t be here at this time.\u201d\u201cDoes the Empress really own the entire palace? Only the Empress\u2019 bedroom is hers.\u201d\u201cThe Empress often visits here too, so why not Miss Rashta as well?\u201dI heard laughter and conversation as I approached my nest chair, and I stopped right before the bushes to observe what was happening.Rastha was sitting in my nest chair while a maidservant pushed it like a swing. The other maid had brought a table and was even cutting fruit.\u201c\u2026\u201dHot anger seared through my chest. Did the concubine still not know that the western palace was the domain of the Empress? No, she must know if she was avoiding me. I could barely tolerate the fact that someone I didn\u2019t like was enjoying themselves in my chair.\u201cWell, the Empress would never come to such a small place. If Rashta doesn\u2019t sit in it, the chair will be lonely, right?\u201d\u201cMiss Rashta\u2026you adorable little thing.\u201d\u201cYou are so different from the other young ladies. You are so innocent.\u201d\u201cWhy? What about the others?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026nobles make their debut in society at the age of seventeen. After that, they need to be cunning.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fighting and backstabbing involved.\u201d\u201cMiss Rashta, don\u2019t get involved with them, or they\u2019ll eat you alive.\u201dRashta smiled, then turned and suddenly caught sight of me.\u201cA-ah, Your Majesty.\u201dRashta jumped to her feet. The maids, who had been speaking ill of the nobility, also stepped back in surprise. Two new ladies-in-waiting were nowhere to be seen. Supposedly they did not get along with Rashta, and they must have been sent back by Sovieshu or the maids.I pushed aside a few stems and approached them, my eyes fixed on the nest chair. When Rashta stood up, I spotted my handkerchief behind her dress. She had used the handkerchief to sit on my nest chair. When Rashta saw the direction of my gaze, she spoke up hurriedly.\u201cThis isn\u2019t trash, Your Majesty. It\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d\u201cI know the chair is not trash. It\u2019s my chair.\u201dRashta flinched at my clipped tone. I counted to the number ten in the old language. That chair was my cherished possession, and this was my secret place. I was angry that Sovieshu\u2019s concubine invaded my precious spot.\u201cI\u2026Your Majesty? Why do you look so frightening?\u201dRashta\u2019s voice was short on breath, but I couldn\u2019t open my mouth to reply. It was not forbidden for anyone else to be here. While I never saw other people with my own eyes, anyone else could have used this chair.And yet, anger flared in my chest at the thought of Rashta using it. Concubines were not supposed to come here to the western palace to see the empress. However, it was unbecoming for an empress to take offense for someone sitting in a chair, and those maids would certainly gossip about the nobles like they did before.I managed to steady my breathing and repeated to myself to never get angry in any way.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cThe handkerchief you are sitting on is mine, too.\u201dAs I managed to force my anger down, Rashta turned back quickly in surprise. The maids glanced at each other and bowed their heads.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty. Rashta didn\u2019t know. It was just by the chair\u2026\u201d\u201cYou did it without knowing. But don\u2019t come to the west palace anymore. It\u2019s not good that we see each other.\u201d\u201cB-but Rashta wants to be friends with Her Majesty\u2026\u201dRashta was in tears, and the maids looked on in pity. They probably already thought I was a mean woman who was offended over a chair or handkerchief. Seeing Rashta so upset, I deliberately smiled and said something to shock her.\u201cYou can be friends with the next concubine.\u201d\u201cThe next concubine?\u201d\u201cThe next concubine that the Emperor will bring in after you.\u201dI only returned what she said to me.Rashta turned pale and looked at me with a wounded expression. She bowed her head and ran away, and her maids chased after her.I stood alone and gazed at my nest chair and my crushed handkerchief.I didn\u2019t feel good. It was the same chair and handkerchief that I had before, but\u2026I found no cheer in them.***\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dSovieshu found himself surprised when he visited Rashta after work. As soon as he entered the room, a sobbing Rashta leapt into his arms.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying? Did a lady-in-waiting insult you again?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, when you get tired of Rashta, will you bring another woman as your concubine?\u201d\u201cWhat? Who said that?\u201dHe stared at her dumbfounded, and she cried out \u201cThe Empress!\u201d\u201cThe Empress?\u201dSovieshu frowned as if he found it difficult to believe.\u201cWhy would the Empress suddenly say that to you? No, where did you meet her?\u201d\u201cThere is an abandoned chair in the west palace garden. No one was using it, so Rashta was playing there\u2013\u201d\u201cDid you go to the west palace again?\u201d\u201cI went when the Empress wasn\u2019t there. And it was at the secluded garden, not near the building, Your Majesty.\u201dTears poured down Rashta\u2019s face in rivulets, and Sovieshu sighed and wiped them away with his sleeve.\u201cSo, you were sitting in a chair that no one was using. And you were avoiding the Empress.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. She had a scary face, and R\u2013Rashta said \u2018I want to be friends with the Empress.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd she insinuated that I would bring another concubine when I tired of you?\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t say that exactly, but she meant it. Is that really true? Will you love another woman besides Rashta? Your Majesty, are you going to cheat on Rashta?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re not the kind of man to cheat?\u201dRashta stared widely at him with her doe eyes, and Sovieshu hugged her tightly and repeated his answer. Her trembling finally calmed down. Sovieshu rubbed Rashta\u2019s back, frowning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)I returned to my palace after finishing my work, then slipped into comfortable clothes more quickly than usual. I felt my head throbbing, possibly because of the constant feeling of something bothering me. I was slowly starting to understand my mother\u2019s words of \u201cDo not get involved in the affairs of the Emperor and his concubine.\u201dBut Mother, even if I try not to care, she keeps appearing in front of me.\u201cCountess Eliza.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201cAbout my mother\u2013no, nevermind.\u201d\u201cYou want me to bring Duchess Troby?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll see her on New Year\u2019s anyway.\u201d\u201cYou should consult the Duchess if you\u2019re feeling uneasy, Your Majesty.\u201dCounsel would probably ease my mind. But if I spoke to her, my mother\u2019s mind would be a thorny path from then on, and I didn\u2019t want to burden my her with my problems. She already thought about me all the time.\u2018I\u2019ll keep it to myself for now. I can tell her later. Mother must have heard about Rashta anyway.\u2019\u201cI will. Ah, is Lady Laura alright?\u201d\u201cYes. She wants to return to the palace as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cTell her she can come back whenever he wants. Preferably before New Year\u2019s. That way, people won\u2019t talk.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty \u201dValueimpression PlaceholderTalking about Laura made me miss her bright energy. The Countess left the room for a moment, and I unpinned the jewels from my hair and placed them on the dresser.\u2018I\u2019m going to go to bed a little early today.\u2019I should skip dinner. Instead, I sat at my desk and opened my notebook.There was the click of the door behind me, but I didn\u2019t turn around, thinking it was the Countess. However, the presence stood silent behind my back. That was not what the Countess would do. As I was dipping my pen into the inkwell, I frowned and turned around.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dTo my surprise, it was Sovieshu standing behind me. How long had it been since my husband came to the western palace? Rather than being happy at his presence, I looked on anxiously. It was sure to be another difficult conversation with him.\u201cMay I help you, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cWhy do people change so much?\u201dOf course it was going to be another uncomfortable encounter. I had a terrible feeling, and wondered if it had anything to do with Sovieshu in my room.\u201cChange?\u201d\u201cI heard about the bad things you said to Rashta.\u201dRashta. A mere small woman. But her name and presence stuck stubbornly to my feet wherever I went.\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d\u201cYou said that I would take another concubine after her.\u201d\u201cRather than trying to be friendly to me, I told her to be friendly with another concubine when she comes.\u201dValueimpression Placeholder\u201c!\u201d\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cShe spoke without malice.

You\u2019ve changed.\u201d\u201cEmpress!\u201d\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat that I don\u2019t want to get involved with you and your concubine?

If you hadn\u2019t said those things to Rashta, I wouldn\u2019t have come here!\u201dI shouted, not from excitement, but from finding something that would hurt Sovieshu the most.\u201cDid the former emperor ever talk about Countess Sophie to the former empress?\u201dSovieshu paled when I brought up the subject of the former emperor\u2019s favored lover.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were such a gossiper.\u201dHe gestured his arms around the room.\u201cThis room is full of beautiful furniture, and you can buy anything you want. You are cruel to someone who has lived their life pitifully.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s eyes filled with disappointment.\u201cShe was also a subject of the Empress before she was my concubine. Do you not feel sorry for her?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as I said that single word, my legs became weak. I hold on to the dressing table to prevent my legs from folding underneath myself, and that was when Countess Eliza came in the room and rushed towards me. She carefully hugged me and comforted me in her arms.***\u201cReally? The Emperor was angry with the Empress because of Rashta?\u201d\u201cI think so. They were shouting at the top of their voices.\u201dCherily gave a bitter smile, and Rashta covered her face with both her hands\u201cWow\u2026the Emperor is incredible\u2026\u201dThe other maid, Kisu, continued the story.\u201cNot only that, but he declared a strict punishment to anyone who brings up the false rumor that you\u2019re a runaway slave.\u201dThe faces of the two maids blurred behind Rashta\u2019s tears.\u201cThe Emperor really loves you, Miss Rashta.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, how could anyone not love someone so beautiful and innocent?\u201d\u201cThe Emperor and Rashta are like lovers in fairy tales.\u201d\u201cIt really is like a fairy tale.\u201dRashta bowed her head and wiggled her toes shyly.\u201cRashta is so happy these days. I feel like I\u2019m dreaming every day.\u201dShe was not prepared when a moment later, three servants entered the room to deliver a large swing chair. He mood grew even brighter.\u201cThis is\u2013?\u201d\u201cThis is a gift from the Emperor to Rashta. He said you can sit here without going to the palace.\u201dUnlike the nest chair in the western palace, the fixture and decorations of this chair were all made of jewels, gold, and silver. The cushions and feather-stuffed cushions were made of the finest material and heavenly soft. Rashta burst into tears of joy and exchanged happy looks with her maids.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Where Is Queen? (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI lay crying in bed when I heard a tap on my window. I looked up dully, and to my surprise, I saw the handsome bird hovering outside. I hesitated before opening the window, and the bird hopped onto my bed, picked its wings and stared at me.\u201cYou arrived quickly this time.\u201dI wiped away my tears, and the bird peered at me with its large eyes, like it had seen me crying. It was such a clever bird.\u201cIs your master near?\u201dThe bird nodded as if it understood my words. I lifted the bird and placed it on my lap, and it froze for a moment and blinked rapidly. I brushed its head then pulled the note from its leg.\u2013 The bird will be named Queen, but kIt was a short but efficient sentence again. The heaviness in my mind lifted, and I smiled at the words of this stranger who I had neither face nor name for.\u201cYou\u2019re a boy?\u201dThe bird flapped his wings as if miffed by my ignorance, but in my defense, I didn\u2019t know the difference between the males and females of this species. I patted his head again then went to my desk, and the bird followed. I took out a sheet of paper and wrote a reply.\u2013 I didn\u2019t know he was male. An unexpected surprise.I rolled up the note and tied it to the bird\u2019s leg, then glanced at the calendar. The New Year\u2019s celebrations were just around the corner. Some of the guests would start arriving early tomorrow at the palace\u2026The owner of the bird was already nearby. Would they come tomorrow?***The next morning, the lord and lady of the Lux region arrived, as well as other distinguished guests from the neighboring countries. The guests\u2019 reception were divided for either me, Sovieshu, or the foreign minister. Most of the time, they went to Sovieshu.\u201cYour Majesty! Your Majesty! There is an arrival from the Western Kingdom!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s the Western Kingdom\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I believe it\u2019s Prince Heinley.\u201dThe Prince was one of the few guests I had to personally greet. I nodded and stood up, and the officials supervising the guest list followed suit. I gestured to them to sit down, then walked towards a large mirror, arranged my dress, and went to the reception room.Prince Heinley was the younger brother of the king of the West, and the second son of their father. However, Heinley was the heir to the throne as the king had no children, despite already having a queen and three official concubines.Rumors abounded that because of the king\u2019s infertility and poor physical condition these days, Prince Heinley would likely inherit the throne. In spite of that, the Western Kingdom was already similar in size and power to the Eastern Empire. Of course, I would go and welcome the special guest myself.I entered the White Rose room, and when I looked at the delegation I stopped breathing when I saw the man at the head.I had often heard rumors about this man\u2019s beautiful appearance. As soon as one entered into high society, one could not escape talk of Prince Heinley. Word was that he was a womanzier, he had a violent personality, he was indescribably handsome. He killed or backstabbed people with a smile on his face, or that it wasn\u2019t that the king of the Western Kingdom was incapable of having children, but that the Prince killed each of them. I could not decipher from all the rumors whether Prince Heinley was a womanizer or a cruel person.But one thing was certain. His appearance. He\u2026he really was beautiful. His blonde hair fell into soft, tousled waves on his face, and his lips curved into a delicate bow. He bore a strong neck and broad shoulders, but what was most striking about him were his mysterious violet eyes.\u2018Even if he were to stand in the corner with his mouth shut, he would stir all kinds of rumors.\u2019I stood opposite of Prince Heinley, admiring him as surreptitiously as I could. He was only a prince, but he was from the esteemed Western Kingdom, and so I treated him with the respect of a crown prince.I stood across from him, but before I could say anything, Prince Heinley bent one knee and reached out his hand like a knight swearing a vow of loyalty. I gave him my hand, upon which he placed a gentle kiss. But the difference between the knights was clear. The knights lowered their eyes or stared towards the front as they gave a kiss of loyalty. This man, however, stared straight into my eyes and held my gaze captive.\u201cIt\u2019sHe released my hand and smiled, and I felt my stomach knot for some reason. I thought the rumor that he was cruel was more true than the one of him being a womanizer, as I saw no lechery in his eyes.Instead, he was like an eagle observing me from above, despite the fact that he was kneeling before me.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you as well, Prince Heinley.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t let myself be crushed by him, of course. I wore a dignified expression born through years of training. He smiled softly and rose to his knees.\u201cIt must have been a difficult journey, and I hope you will rest and enjoy it here until New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always heard praise for the imperial palace of the Eastern Empire. It\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d\u201cI hope you will find it pleasing.\u201dThe prince\u2019s eyes squinted in a smile at the ceremonial greeting.\u201cI am already pleased.\u201d***The amount of work required from me was halved after the arrival of the special guests, and most of what was left was for the celebrations themselves. I finished my work earlier than usual and returned to the western palace. Laura, who returned to her position as my lady-in-waiting, quickly approached me.\u201cYour Majesty, Your Majesty. How was he? How was Prince Heinley? Is he beautiful like the rumors say?\u201dThe other ladies-in-waiting approached in interest, teacups in hand. They set them down in various corners like the window frame, on the dresser, on the tea table, then went to work in helping me change.\u201cI heard that the Grand Duke Chrome fainted when he saw Prince Heinley. Is that really true?\u201d\u201cI heard a famous theater actress went on a date with him once, then chased him for three years.\u201dAlthough the ladies-in-waiting would see him in a few days, they could not bear their patience. I replied to satiate their craving, remembering Prince Heinley\u2019s steady gaze, purple eyes and sharp charisma that could be felt from a distance.\u201cHe was the most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever seen. Without a doubt.\u201dLaura let out a small scream of exclamation.\u201cWow. I can\u2019t wait to see him. What was his voice like?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the best voice I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201dIt was not an exaggeration. The ladies put their hands on their hearts while swooning.\u201cI\u2019m already looking forward to what gossip the handsome prince will bring.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure many are already thinking about it.\u201dWhile they were curious about Prince Heinley\u2019s appearance, they were also looking forward to the drama he would bring. I smiled as I listened to their conversation, when there was a tap on the window. It was Queen, rapping the glass with his beak.\u201cAre you here already?\u201dI opened the window, and he landed on the sill and blinked at me. Now that I thought abouold feathers and purple eyes. It was hard to imagine that he could survive in the wild with such conspicuous colors\u2026Suddenly, I worried if it was alright to use a bird like this as a messenger.Queen held out his foot as if he wanted me to read the note as soon as possible. I opened the note and sat at my desk, while the ladies-in-waiting occupied themselves in feeding Queen. The handwriting was familiar, the message playful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Want To Make A Bet? (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe was already here? The guests started entering the palace today. I mentally filed through all the arrivals.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was difficult to pinpoint one person from the abundance of guests. There were Grand Duke Chrome and his wife, the Grand Duke Lilteang, the Chancellor and his family from the Northern Kingdom, the children of Duchess Cranthia from Samoneau, Prince Heinley from the Western Kingdom, Emperor Sirim of Blue Bohean\u2026The problem was that they did not come in twos or threes. Just from the Grand Duke and his wife, there were also the knights, the servants, and escorts, and then multiply that number by several times to account for the other guests. I didn\u2019t know if the letter came from a woman or man, if they were young or old, or what status they were. It was almost impossible to determine Queen\u2019s owner.\u2013 I don\u2019t know who you are.I considered it a little more and then added,\u2013 Do you know who I am?I was sure they didn\u2019t know. I was one of countless people living in the palace. As soon as I finished writing the letter, Queen hopped to my side.\u201cThis birdy is quite clever, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cEven while cleaning his feathers, he seems to be trying to make eye contact with you, Your Majesty.\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting burst out laughing when Queen butted his head towards me.\u201cReally?\u201dI stroked the bird\u2019s head, and he made a pleased sound and half-closed his eyes. I rolled up the note and tied it to the bird\u2019s leg, and he fluttered his wings and landed on the bed in a small dance before leaping back out the window.\u201cWhat a clever bird\u2026The owner themselves would have to be quite intelligent to raise a bird like that. What kind of person were they? A young woman of my age like Laura? An elegant old lady or gentleman? A prodigal nobleman? A knight who knows nothing but the sword\u2026\u201cDo you like birds, Your Majesty?\u201dCountess Eliza came by my side as I stared silently outside the window.\u201cYes. I think they\u2019re lovely.\u201dThe bird was truly incredible, the person who owned the bird had to be incredible as well. Countess Eliza smiled and spoke in a half-encouraging tone.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you raise one or two birds of that species, or any other species?\u201d\u201cOh yes. It would be amazing to have a chick from birth.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s bring them together!\u201dIt was tempting, but I thought about it for a moment and shook my head.\u201cNo. Seeing one is different from raising one.\u201dQueen was exceptionally intelligent because of his master\u2019s training. It was unclear whether I liked birds, or just Queen himself. If I had an animal, I would make sure I would commit to it before raising it.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Viscountess Verdi since yesterday. \u2026.\u201d\u201cShe had to rush back to her estate.\u201d\u201c\u2026Troubles again?\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting glanced at each other. Unlike the rest of them, Viscountess Verdi had no mansion in the capital, and she frequently returned to her estate due to family matters. The problem was that most of the \u201cfamily matters\u201d was often unenjoyable news.\u201cI heard the son was gambling abroad.\u201d\u201cAnd the Viscount was with a married commoner woman, and the woman\u2019s husband sued.\u201dMany aristocrats were like this. Viscountess Verdi\u2019s son had a gambling problem and the husband had a woman problem.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dViscountess Verdi was certainly burdened with hardship. I was worried, but I couldn\u2019t interfere without her asking me. My consideration would touch her pride. And even if she asks for help, it\u2019s not something that I could resolve\u2026\u2018Everyone has problems.\u2019I sighed and reach out to close the open window.***The next day, more guests arrived at the palace, starting with the arrival of the princess of the Southern Kingdom early in the morning. The time passed quickly as I exchanged greetings with her and her security was cleared. Maybe it was because of the rain, but today felt particularly hectic.It wasn\u2019t until I retired to my room in the evening that I found Queen sitting on the window frame, pining pitifully as he waited for me. I opened the window, and he crept into the room, soaking wet and shuddering.\u201cMy goodness. Your master sent you in that rain?\u201d\u2013 !\u201cYou\u2019re shaking. I\u2019m sure you have a message.\u201d\u2013 \u2026With my tongue in my cheek in concentration, I wrapped a soft towel around his body and gently dried his feathers. Queen hesitated for a moment, but soon started dozing in my hands. I rubbed him with the towel until he was completely dry, and carefully pulled the note from his leg. The handwriting was smudged by the rain, but this was what it said.\u2013 Then shall we make a bet? The one who finds the other wins.What was it that I wrote before?\u2026Ah, I asked the sender who they were. They wanted to make a bet. I went to the desk and wrote a reply.\u2013 What would you bet on?After I finished, I looked at Queen and back out the window again. The rain was still lashing heavily against the glass, and had been going on for hours. If I sent him out now, wouldn\u2019t he catch a cold? Queen was staring at me instead of playing with the towel. I put down my pen, and he tilted his head and flew over to the desk. He seemed to scan the contents of the note then extended his leg, as if he wanted me to tie the note.\u201cNo.\u201d\u2013 ?!\u201cIt\u2019s raining now. If I send you now, you will catch a cold.\u201dThe bird hesitated as if it really understood me, and I drew him in my arms and patted its head.\u201cYou can sleep with me today. You can go when the rain stops.\u201d\u2013 !Come to think of it\u2026he was a male bird. Did a bird consider a human\u2019s gender? Why was he suddenly frozen?***I took a bath then slipped into a gown, and when I returned to my room I found Queen lying on my bed. I was going to make a separate cushion for him to sleep next to me, but he was flat on his back.\u201c\u2026\u201dCould a bird sleep on its back like that? Cute.When I got closer, I marveled even more when I saw that he breathed with his beak slightly parted. He didn\u2019t wake up even after I touched him lightly, so I lay myself on the bed next to him. I kept still, feeling a warmth by my shoulders. Maybe because Queen\u2019s body temperature was high even though he was a little far away.As I stared at him in wonder, Queen opened his eyes. When I saw the purple of his irises, I was somehow reminded of Prince Heinley.Come to think of it, the Prince also had eyes like an eagle. I reached out and swept the bird\u2019s cheek, and his sharply gleaming eyes soon slid close again.\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, Queen.\u201dI spoke in a soft whisper, and the bird stretched its body from wingtip to feet, then covered my arm with its wing.\u201cGood night, Queen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The window was slightly ajar, as if he had let itself out.\u2018What a smart bird.\u2019Even more impressively, he remembered to take the note from my desk.\u201cCountess Eliza. Did you clear the paper from my desk?\u201dI asked Countess Eliza just in case.\u201cNo, Your Majesty. Is it gone?\u201d\u201cYes, I think Queen must have taken it.\u201dCountess Eliza was also impressed with my story.I thought about the bet as I made my way to the central palace. Queen was quite intelligent, so his owner had to be as well. Perhaps it was Emperor Sirim from Blue Bohean. I heard he was quite smart. Moreover, as Blue Bohean was a maritime country, it used messenger birds the most compared to other countries\u2026\u201cYour face looks brighter, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve been worried about your dark moods, but I\u2019m glad the New Year\u2019s celebrations seem to cheer you, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dMore precisely, it was Queen\u2019s presence that lifted my mood, but if it weren\u2019t for New Year\u2019s, he never would have come to me. Countess Eliza was right in the end.I worked on my papers with a smile, and as soon as it was lunchtime, I returned to the western palace. I usually took my meals at the central palace, but I was worried that Queen would be waiting for me outside the window like yesterday.\u201cAgain.\u201dQueen was sitting outside the window again. Fortunately, the weather was clear and he was half-dozing off in the sunshine, instead of shivering in the rain. When I opened the window, Queen quickly came into the room and held out his leg. I pulled out the note and checked it eagerly, and once again saw the familiar handwriting.\u2013 I\u2019ll bet Queen.I looked at Queen. The bird blinked his large eyes and tilted his head, oblivious to the contents of the letter.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2013 Gu?\u201cYour master wants to offer you, Queen?\u201dAs soon as I spoke, Queen jumped and flapped his wings. I pulled Queen into my arms and placed him in my lap, and looked down at his magnificent golden plumage.I wanted to have Queen. I have never seen such a cute, smart and lovely bird before. But\u2026no matter what anyone else said, it was best if he stayed with his master. It would be heartbreaking if I won the bet and Queen was let go. No, that was not the best way to describe it. Queen would be abandoned by his master.I was not so happy with the competition either. I was curious of course, but worry stopped me. The reason Queen\u2019s owner and I could send messages to each other was because we were strangers. Would we be able to talk in this familiar way even after we have discovered each other\u2019s identity? I had to be careful to preserve the dignity of my pose as empress, or else this comfortable atmosphere would disappear.\u2013 Gu?The bird tapped my hand as I sat still, as if he were impatient for me to start writing I hesitated and took Queen to my desk. I set him down, took out a piece of paper, and wrote a lie.\u2013 Hint. I\u2019m a man.Queen squawked and flapped his wings as soon as he saw my message It sounded like he was laughing, and I felt embarrassed even though he was just a bird. I scratched his cheek, and Queen turned round and round and rubbed his head against my wrist.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s fun to lie to your master?\u201d\u2013 Gu!I was glad he was having fun. I felt sorry for Queen\u2019s master, but\u2026they won\u2019t find me if I wrote this lie. That way, we wouldn\u2019t be able to find each other, and we could remain faceless friends like now.\u201cYou like this too, don\u2019t you, Queen?\u201d\u2013 ?***It was the day before the New Year\u2019s celebrations officially began.I greeted the last-minute arrivals, and checked on the New Year\u2019s proceedings and the special banquet for the last day. I went to the western palace again during lunch hour to see if Queen was there today, but the effort was fruitless. Instead, Viscountess Verdi, who had been away for several days, returned. She still looked quite pale and distressed, but she greeted me.\u201cIf it\u2019s no trouble to you, Your Majesty, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Tell me.\u201d\u201cCan I borrow some money? \u201dThe red-faced Viscountess Verdi could not even explain the reason she needed it.\u201cAbout five thousand krangs\u2026\u201dThe other ladies-in-waiting and I knew though, however. Perhaps it was for her son or husband. Though Viscountess had hurried back to her estate, she could not pull her family out of the mire. I promised to lend her the money without prying any further, and she repeatedly said she would pay me back and left the room shame-faced.\u201cI\u2019d rather get divorced.\u201dLaura was unmarried, and didn\u2019t have much sympathy towards Viscountess Verdi.\u201cThat\u2019s as good as throwing away the Lux army.\u201dCountess Eliza was patient in explaining this to Laura, but the young lady still didn\u2019t seem to understand.\u201cBut even if she went through divorce, wouldn\u2019t her child be considered illegitimate?\u201d\u201cWhile it won\u2019t happen immediately, there is the possibility that he\u2019ll lose the right to inheritance. That\u2019s why she\u2019s enduring, Laura.\u201d\u201cSo what. If a troublemaker like him becomes heir, he\u2019ll only end up sucking his family dry.\u201d\u201cHush, Laura.\u201dCountess Eliza glared at Laura and she pouted her lips.\u201cI\u2019m only worried.\u201d***Viscountess Verdi returned to her estate again, but not everyone could eat comfortably. As soon as I finished my lunch, I quickly returned to the central palace. Near the end of my work day, something happened as I was taking a break.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dOne of the knights came inside my office and gave me an unexpected report.\u201cPrince Heinley wants to see you.\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley?\u201dWhy him? I went outside and found him looking at a mural with his back to me.\u201cAh. Your Majesty.\u201dI approached him, and he turned his head and bowed like a knight again.\u201cI hope I am not too rude?\u201d\u201cNot at all. What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cI was told you would be finished with work around this time. Are you still busy?\u201dDid he find out my working hours? He was right though, and I replied that I was almost done and he grinned.\u201cThat\u2019s great. If you don\u2019t mind, could you show me the palace? I\u2019d like to look around, but it\u2019s so enormous that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll get lost.\u201d\u201cAh, then my lady-in-waiting\u2013\u201d\u201cYou.\u201dI was about to give him one of my ladies-in-waiting, but he interrupted me in a low voice.\u201cI wish for the Queen to do it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was not the only foreigner to do so, but the word felt strange as I had been sending messages with Queen the bird.Did that mean\u2026Prince Heinley was Queen\u2019s owner? Did he think I was his letter acquaintance? I had a moment of suspicion, but soon dismissed it. It didn\u2019t matter if he wrote those letters. I had no intention of meeting Queen\u2019s owner in real life.The knight standing next to me frowned as if offended. He seemed to think that it was rude for the prince to ask me to guide him around the palace.\u201cAlright.\u201dNevertheless, there was no knowing when his country would surpass the Eastern Empire. I would not stir up unnecessary trouble with a prince who might succeed to the throne in the future.After a moment\u2019s thought, the proud attitude on the Prince Heinley\u2019s face vanished, replaced with an innocent smile as he offered his arm to me. I took it, and contrary to his beautiful and fine appearance, his arm felt densely muscled. I let go of it in surprise, and he looked at me curiously.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dI couldn\u2019t very well say that he was more solid than I expected, so I quickly looked away.\u201cHave you ever been to the Silver Garden? It\u2019s the closest garden to the southern palace. It\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been around the southern palace, naturally.\u201dI pondered for a moment as we walked along the corridor exiting the central palace. The central palace was primarily used for work, with many forbidden areas to outsiders, so it was inappropriate for me to show him around there. The southern palace was used to house the foreign guests, and he must have toured around the area.Then there was still the western palace\u2026we could share a cup of tea, so the western palace should be at the end.I could escort him to the Emperor\u2019s eastern palace, but I was reluctant to run across Rashta. We could easily skip that and go to the north palace\u2026\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dI was strolling forward without saying a word, and Prince Heinley called out me. Something in his voice made my ears tingle.\u201cI was thinking about what to show you first.\u201d\u201cAh. Then I want to go\u2013\u201dBefore Prince Heinley finished speaking, a familiar person ran towards us from the garden bushes.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dRashta. Despite my efforts to avoid here, she still appeared in front of me. I sighed, keeping on my mask as I nodded to her.\u201cYour Majesty, are you talking a walk? Rashta\u2019s taking a walk too.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI had no idea where her inexhaustible energy came from. Last time I saw her, we didn\u2019t part on the best terms.\u201cI came from over there.\u201dShe pointed her finger at the path she had followed, then smiled brightly and bowed to the prince.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Rashta.\u201dI thought the prince would be offended by this unnoble greeting, but he smiled unexpectedly and copied Rashta\u2019s mannerism.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Heinley.\u201dRashta\u2019s giggle was like a silver bell.\u201cYou\u2019re funny! Your Majesty, who is this? I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201dHeinley introduced himself before I could.\u201cI\u2019m Prince Heinley from the Western Kingdom.\u201d\u201cWow! Prince?!\u201dRashta covered her mouth with her hands, then squealed in excitement.\u201cRashta has never seen a prince!\u201d\u201cHaha, is that so?\u201d\u201cYou really look like a prince. From a fairy tale book.\u201d\u201cGoodness. You flatter me, Rashta.\u201dA pink flush rose on Rashta\u2019s cheeks.\u201cAre you two taking a walk together?\u201d\u201cI asked the Empress to show me around.\u201d\u201cThis place is wonderful, isn\u2019t it? There are a lot of places to see.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen everything, but so far, it\u2019s been incredible.\u201dUnlike the nobles who were embarrassed by Rashta\u2019s speech or behavior when they first met her, Prince Heinley carried on easily with her. Rashta asked if Prince Heinley was feeling comfortable, then posed him another question with a beaming smile.\u201cWell, Prince Heinley, do you want me to guide you?\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s eyebrows lifted.\u201cLady Rashta?\u201d\u201cRashta has been exploring the entire palace lately. There\u2019s no place I don\u2019t know!\u201dRashta glanced and added kindly,\u201cHer Majesty is busy, so Rashta will do it for you.\u201d\u201cAh. Thank you, Lady Rashta. But that\u2019s all right. The Empress is a great guide. \u201dI hadn\u2019t even shown him anything yet. Prince Heinley glanced at me apologetically.\u201cAh! Then Rashta will go with you. It would be more fun if the three of us took a walk together!\u201dRashta attached herself to Prince Heinley\u2019s side, and he returned a soft smile.If he allowed Rashta to accompany us, I would simply leave. I thought through the words that would give me a reasonable excuse.Busy? No, I said I was not busy.I just remembered that I was busy? No, that was too hasty.Perhaps I had to rush to the bathroom\u2026No, absolutely not.In any case, I didn\u2019t want to create a scene of the Empress and the Emperor\u2019s concubine taking a stroll with the neighboring country\u2019s prince. There could be no such ridiculous thing. But before I even choose an excuse\u2013\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lady Rashta.\u201dPrince Heinley turned down Rashta in a gentle but firm voice.\u201cThree is too many.\u201dRashta looked surprised, and Prince Heinley left her with a \u201cEnjoy your walk,\u201d then calmly strode away. He was polite, but surprisingly cold. Usually when someone offered their company, the polite thing to do was accept.I glanced sideways at his profile in surprise. Before I knew it, he returned with the prideful attitude when he asked me to guide him. I frowned in thought\u2026he certainly had a rude personality. He really was a man that depended on his good looks. Was that the reason of the buzz in the social circles?Prince Heinley stared at me while I thought. I avoided his gaze for fear of being too obvious, when he asked me an unexpected question.\u201cDo you not find me handsome?\u201dWhat was he talking about? I gave a slight frown, and Prince Heinley continued.\u201cIt\u2019s strange. People are usually interested in me at this point. Why is the Queen so cold? Is my face swollen today? I made sure to dress finely.\u201dI must have heard him wrong. I stared at him, Prince Heinley suddenly burst out laughing.\u2026Was it a joke?\u201cMy apologies, Your Majesty. You were so rigid a while ago.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cThe woman from earlier, was she the Emperor\u2019s mistress?\u201dPrince Heinley used the term \u201cmistress\u201d instead of \u201cconcubine.\u201d This, too, was not typical of nobility, and it produced a smile from me.\u201cThe Emperor is a strange man. How could he look elsewhere with the Queen in front of him?\u201d\u201cThank you for your kind words, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no need to thank me. If he cannot appreciate you, it is his loss.\u201dPerhaps that was why he was called a womanizer. For a moment I was pleasantly surprised. I knew his words were meant to be pleasing to my ears, but his haughty face made me unable to accept his flattery. He looked like the type that would be unwilling to give compliments even if he was held by the throat and ordered to do so.I forced a smile, and he gave me a boyish grin in return.\u201cSo, if you don\u2019t mind, Your Majesty, would you invite me to the special banquet on the last day of the New Year\u2019s celebrations?\u201dThose present at the final New Year\u2019s banquet were highly distinguished guests of high status, or made great achievements, or were expected to make great achievements. However, the Emperor and Empress only invited ten guests. Naturally, most of the invitations were already sent before the New Year\u2019s, and Prince Heinley was naturally the first on that list.\u201cDidn\u2019t you already receive the invitation? It couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d\u201cI received it. But it was an invitation from the Emperor of the Eastern Empire.\u201dWhen he looked at me again, his eyebrows lifted.\u201cI would rather be the Empress\u2019 guest.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it, but I have already sent out all of the invitations.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cross out the Emperor\u2019s name and write down your name below?\u201dHe was speaking nonsense, and he chuckled at his own words, then offered up his arm again.\u201cShall we keep walking?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Countess Eliza was helping me change my clothes, when she suddenly exclaimed \u201cOh!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d,.Countess Eliza was smiling at the window. I followss Eliza chuckled.\u201cHe flew here, but when he saw you changing, he panicked and turned around.\u201dWhen I finished dressing, I approached the bird, but Queen still kept his back firmly towards me. He cocked his head when I approached, but didn\u2019t turn around. I spoke to him in a soft voice.\u201cI\u2019m dressed now.\u201dI po against mine.Queen nodded his head primly. He really did look intelligent. However\u2026\u201cDid you come here in a hurry today? Why are you tired?\u201dQueen seemed exhausted from his journey when he carried the first note, but after his owner arrived at the palace, he appeared to be more at ease. He looked exhausted again today, however, as if in a rush.Queen fumbled a little, then held out his leg with another note. I petted his head and pulled out the scrap of paper.\u2013 Looking for me?Queen tilted her head and stared. He then went to drink some water, keeping his eye on me. It was a long moment before I finally replied.\u2013 Looking hard. And you?Queen shook the water from his beak then flew towards me. He looked at the note, then tapped my arm lightly with his wings as if to reprimand me for my lie. He was so adorable the way he reacted to my letters, and I patted his beak again.\u2013 !The New Year\u2019s celebrations finally began.Fireworks glittered in the sky at night, and people laughed and chatted in the streets by day.Although I had lived in the palace for a long time, the image that still came to mind when thinking about New Year\u2019s was the lively pre-marriage festival.I opened the window, allowing the cool yet moist morning air to tickle my nose. I inhaled and exhaled deeply, then half-closed the window and rang the bell next to my bed. After a moment, Countess Eliza entered, dressed more extravagantly than usual.\u201cYou will be quite busy today.\u201dThe Countess smiled at me, then quickly lifted the dress she prepared from the closet. My mother had given the dress to me as a gift, a beautiful thing adorned with white pearls and underlaid with layers of snowy lace to give a full skirt. My mother didn\u2019t say it directly to me, but I knew that she was worried about me after the rumors about Rashta.\u201cIt\u2019s the first day, so we must all dress up. On an event like this, one should look colorful, but too strong of a color would look tacky. Instead, it\u2019s better to make the queen\u2019s image stand out.\u201dShe explained to me that concept was \u201cThe Queen of Snow\u201d, then urged me to get up and wash my face. After sliding into the scented bath water and receiving a massage, Countess Eliza washed my hair and placed on light makeup to make my skin look smoother. She helped me put on the white dress, then decorated my hair with more pearls. I slipped on the white shoes, and soon it really was as if I came from a country of snow.\u201cYou look so beautiful, Empress. I\u2019m not only saying this because you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201dCountess Eliza seemed to want to speak more, but she smiled silently instead. Perhaps she was about to say something like, \u201cSovieshu will be impressed when he sees you.\u201dI checked the schedule on my desk one final time, then headed towards the eastern palace. From the second day onwards it wouldn\u2019t matter, but on the first day it was required that the emperor and empress enter the first grand banquet together.I found Sovieshu waiting for me outside. He smiled at me gently and extended his arm for me to take. I thought he would be more upset and longing for his lover, but I noticed no such thing in his expression. It was surprising, but I took his arm and we walked towards the grand ballroom.The doors to the hall were wide open. Four guards, dressed in splendid imperial uniforms than usual, stood on each side of the door, and one rapped on the door when they saw Sovieshu and I. An official sounded the trumpet, and the noise in the hall subsided.I took a few steps with Sovieshu at my siotted with the colorful outfits of the guests. Sovieshu raised his hand, and everyone bowed at the same time. I took in the crowd, when something I saw made my hands clench involuntarily.Near the center of the ballroomPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was for this reason that emperors would have a low status concubines fake marriage to another noble, raising that concubine\u2019s status to countesses or marchionesses. However, Sovieshu would never take this \u201cblindfold\u201d approach with Rashta.Rashta\u2019s appearance caught me off guard. I turned my head sideways, but it seemed that I was the only was surprised. Sovieshu was smiling at Rashta and nodding his head. When I turned back towards Rashta again, she curtsied shyly and looked up at Sovieshu and mouthed \u201cThis is difficult.\u201dSoon her gaze fell on me. When our eyes met, she smiled and mouthed out \u201cSister!\u201d Then her eyes widened as she cutely she covered her mouth in apology.\u201cShe\u2019s so naive.\u201dThe expression on his face told me he found Rashta completely endearing.I felt my heart twist. Despite the fact that I was his wife, I felt like a foreign object caught between the two.The nobles who bowed to us were now looking alternately between Sovieshu and Rashta. Women covered their mouths with their fans, and men whispered to each other behind their gloves. Though they kept their voices low, it was like a roar when all joined in concert. Rashta looked around in surprise and stared up at Sovieshu with a frightened face. He sighed.\u201cEmpress, can you go down alone?\u201dThe two of us already walked in together side-by-side, and his obligations with me were over. We could go down the stairs separately, but I did not want to give the impression that we were together by force. I made myself speak.\u201c\u2026We go down together.\u201dSovieshu turned slightly towards me in amazement, but I kept my voice steady.\u201cMany of the top foreign aristocrats are gathered here. They would think there is a rift between us if don\u2019t go down together.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cA conflict between the Emperor and the Empress could be seen as an opportunity for our enemies and the neighboring countries. We don\u2019t have to be a perfect couple, but we shouldn\u2019t look at each other unfavorably.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s expression twisted slightly.\u201cAh, yes, I suppose so.\u201dRather than taking to heart what I said, he seemed to accept it as an excuse. He gave a regretful smile and reached out to me.\u201cThen let\u2019s go down together. \u201dAs he escorted me down the stairs, he nodded towards the crowd and before stopping at a suitable area on the floor. He smiled and lowered his arm.\u201cIs this enough?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWith his duty done, Sovieshu made towards Rashta without looking back. I stood alone and watched him. The foreign nobles surrounding Rashta welcomed the Emperor with a smile and stepped back to make room for him. Rashta quickly nestled herself by Sovieshu\u2019s side. So that was what a loving partnership looked like\u2026I wrenched my gaze away. Instead of showing pain, I feigned a smile and greeted the Duchess Tuania nearby.\u201cYou organized the New Year\u2019s celebrations didn\u2019t you, Your Majesty? This is wonderful.\u201dDuchess Tuania approached me with a friendly demeanor, ignoring the topic of Sovieshu and Rashta. Before long, the other noblewomen and young ladies came to me as well, and we carried on in casual conversation.\u201cOh, look over there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cRumors say that he is a womanizer. He has such a beautiful face.\u201d\u201cI hear that he mixes with dangerous pirates.\u201dBecause the noblewomen avoided the topic of Rashta, the conversation turned to Prince Heinley instead.\u201cSince there are more rumors wherever he goes, he must be seeing someone now, right?\u201d\u201cWhat partner would deal with that fire of a person?\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley is single\u2026maybe there isn\u2019t one.\u201d\u201cWell, he is the future king of the Western Kingdom, so it may be beneficial to marry a woman from our Eastern Empire.\u201d\u201cBut he seems quiet for someone who has so many rumors about him\u2026\u201dI listened to them talk about the mysterious prince, and took a glass of champagne from a passing servant. It had only a little alcohol, almost like water. I tipped the drink up to my lips, lifting my head. Through the glass I saw the distorted figure of a man. It was Prince Heinley, staring in my direction. I lowered my head and pulled the vessel away from my lips.I thought it was by chance that he was looking at me, but when our eyes met he didn\u2019t turn away his gaze. Instead, he lifted his own glass to toast me then took a drink. He tilted his head, revealing a smooth jawline. A foreign nobleman then caught his attention, and I quickly took my eyes off him.It was then\u2013\u201cEven the most aloof empress cannot help but look at that face.\u201dThere was a laughing voice from somewhere. My heart pounded, and I turned my head in the direction of the voice. The seats by the wall were occupied with many foreigners and natives. There were too many people for me to know who said it, but I immediately knew who it was. A group of people were holding on to their stomachs as they howled in laughter.It was hard for me to hear, but the person with that voice said something again, and the laughter grew louder. Some of the giggling nobles glanced sideways at me and caught my gaze, and they quickly poked each other in the ribs to signal quiet. Their reaction convinced me of the certainty of my story. They thought I was deaf to what they were saying, but I was not far away.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026did you really give her a gift?\u201dA lady had been lingering nearby, as if she had been waiting to ask me a question.\u201cA gift?\u201dMy voice came out sharp without me intending it. The lady blushed and apologized, but what I wanted was not an apology.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean, but I\u2019m not angry. Tell me, what do you mean, a gift?\u201dI forced my voice to sound normal, and the lady opened her mouth apprehensively.\u201cThe foreign guests don\u2019t know the rumors about \u2018that woman.\u2019 What they say is that she is the first concubine that the Emperor has accepted, and you had given her all kinds of gifts.\u201dI already knew the first part. But how did I suddenly give her gifts?\u201cThen a foreigner asked me\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Tell me.\u201d\u201cA foreigner asked \u2018that woman\u2019 if she was alright with being in a love triangle involved with Your Majesty, and she said yes. She said that both the Emperor and Empress loved her greatly. \u2018That woman\u2019 said that immediately after she became a concubine, the Empress even sent her all kinds of precious gifts to welcome her\u2026\u201dCommunication with foreigners was recent. Moreover, most of the other ladies around looked surprised, as if the gossip was not a familiar topic that spread around society. In other words, the foreigners heard the rumors first and spread it to local aristocrats.I felt dizzy and my knees were weak beneath me. People were laughing at me for sending gifts to my husband\u2019s lover to gain his attention. The pride that I had mustered swiftly collapsed like a sand castle because of a single false rumor. No matter how much I tried to distance myself from Sovieshu and Rashta, I was buried.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - A False Rumor (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNo.\u201dMy voice was adamant, but was clear that the rumor was going to spread like wildfire. I clenched the champagne glass and gave my legs strength. My vision swam in front of me. I just wanted to go back to the western palace and scream and rage, but I could not reveal even a tremor.\u201cMiss Rashta must have misunderstood something.\u201dI spoke calmly and the other ladies chuckled and said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d I didn\u2019t know whether they believed me or not. People tended to dismiss the excuses of those hurt by the gossip. I didn\u2019t want to get involved as much as possible, but now that it came to this, there was nothing to be done. I would call Rashta myself later and ask. After taking a deep sigh, I handed over the half-full glass to a servant.\u201cOh, I think the dance is about to start.\u201dDuchess Tuania gave an exaggerated laugh. As she had observed, the musicians had stopped, flicking through their sheet music and speaking lowly to each other.There was one rule at the ballroom dance\u2013one could not dance with the same partner twice in a row. The rule allowed one to dance with multiple partners, but the partner for the first dance was considered the most meaningful.The groups began to split up and search for their partners before going to the center. Those who did not want to dance moved to the periphery.\u2018Sovieshu will have his first dance with Rashta.\u2019Since our marriage, Sovieshu always had his first dance with me. This year, however, I had a good inkling who his partner would be this time. I pretended to look away, but I could see Sovieshu taking Rashta\u2019s hand and saying something to her. Rashta, happy, glanced at me. The look in her eyes turned to an apology, and Sovieshu\u2019s head turned this way as well. I looked away before our eyes met, and I kept my chin high as I strode away.The only person who could ask the Empress for the first dance was the Emperor. No one else would ask me to dance anyway, so I thought it better to leave the area altogether to protect my pride.Duchess Tuania, the most popular woman in high society, already had a number of suitors on their knees. I couldn\u2019t help myself, but my eyes turned to Rashta and Sovieshu again. Sovieshu was talking to a nearby prime minister. Fortunately, Rashta was now looking closely at Duchess Tuania.\u2018I\u2019m glad our eyes didn\u2019t meet.\u2019I didn\u2019t want them to notice my gaze. I stuck closer to the wall, hoping that my eyes wouldn\u2019t run into them again. However, a buzzing of voices broke out around me before I could reach my intended destination.I looked around. The eyes of the crowd were glued onto the wandering figure out Prince Heinley. Two young ladies burst into giggles, their cheeks flushed in embarrassment. Many seemed to wonder who the Prince would ask for his first dance, and he seemed to bask in the attention. I was still upset by Sovieshu and Rashta, and I didn\u2019t have time to give my focus to this Prince and his rumors. It didn\u2019t matter to me who he danced with\u2013\u201cOh. You were here?\u201d\u2013until he came to me. The crowd murmured even more. I took out my fan and looked at him. When our gazes met, Prince Heinley lowered his eyes and smiled.\u201cI went halfway around this room to find you.\u201dPrince Heinley took out a rose tucked across his chest. With the rose in his palm, he fell down on one knee and looked up at me. For a moment I was puzzled by his behavior.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to ask the Empress to dance!\u201dOnly after hearing someone\u2019s startled voice did I realize what was happening. Someone wanted to ask the Empress for the first dance? And that someone was Prince Heinley? My lips parted in surprise.\u201cAre you good at dancing, Your Majesty?\u201dAlthough he knelt like a typical knight, Prince Heinley\u2019s voice was playful. I hesitated for a moment.I was already tangled up in various bad rumors about Rashta and Sovieshu. Perhaps more misunderstandings would sprout if I danced with this womanizer. However, turning down an offer could only be done after several people asked to dance or after there were already several dances. The only one who asked for the first dance is Prince Heinley. In this situation, if I refused, I would insult him\u2013at least, such a situation was considered an insult in high society. There was no other choice.\u201cVery well. Can you follow me?\u201dI accepted the rose he was holding, and Prince Heinley straightened up and smiled broadly.\u201cHow confident! If you tread on my foot a few times, I\u2019ll ignore it.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll stay quiet.\u201dHe chuckled mischievously, then extended his arm. I placed my hand on it, then walked to the center of the dance floor. Sovieshu and Rashta were there as well. Sovieshu raised his eyebrow at Prince Heinley\u2019s presence. In this situation Sovieshu couldn\u2019t ask Rashta, \u201cDo you often dance?\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe way you\u2019re looking at me. You didn\u2019t pay much attention to me yesterday. I dressed more nicely today.\u201dHis words were sly.\u201cWell, you don\u2019t seem to believe it.\u201dDid he want me to say that yesterday he was dressed wonderfully enough to make my mouth open?Before I could find my words, the minuet began to flow from the musicians. We dipped briefly and we put our palms together. As we started spinning around to the sound of the violins, the surroundings whirled into view. Duchess Tuania, who was acclaimed as the butterfly of society, chose the young and handsome Viscount Landre over numerous other suitors. Duke Lilteang danced with his wife, and Laura danced with her best friend, Miss Alischute, instead of a man. And Sovieshu danced with\u2026I didn\u2019t like this spinning dance. I had to see what I didn\u2019t want to see. The moment I sighed, Prince Heinley swung back close to me, close enough that his lips were near my ear.\u201cI know better than anyone else that unnecessary rumors spread easily.\u201dI felt like my body was falling again. I looked at him in surprise, and an arrogant smile broadened his face.\u201cDo you mean the story of me sending Miss Rashta gifts?\u201dHe nodded as he approached again. It was surprising for one to talk about the rumors and console me.The sweet music finally came to an end. I stared at him hard for a moment to see if he was making fun of me, but it didn\u2019t seem that way.\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201dI felt ashamed that I believed he was a womanizer, and I was grateful that Prince Heinley didn\u2019t believe the rumors about me at all.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it either.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe rumor that you\u2019re a womanizer.\u201dHe unexpectedly burst into laughter, and I turned flustered. Was he saying the rumors were real? I had a blush on my face, and I turned around to hide it. Now that the first dance was over, I wanted to finally go to the edge of the room.\u201cEmpress, this time with me.\u201dSovieshu wouldn\u2019t stay away this time. I placed my hand in his with a small sigh. I knew he was only asking because the rules dictated he couldn\u2019t dance with Rashta again, and I was upset to have to accept. However, as I told Sovieshu, we had to set an example with our relationship.Next to him, Rashta was asking Prince Heinley to dance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The handsome man has a surprisingly weak constitution.\u201d\u201cThen what about after you take a break? When you get your strength back.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dPrince Heinley suddenly looked over and our eyes met, and his gaze softened.\u201cThere\u2019s someone I want to dance with again.\u201dI pondered his repeated refusal towards her. He was determined to cut her off, far different from how most nobles presented themselves. Rashta didn\u2019t expect to be rejected, and she touched her hair, disconcerted, and turned away. Our gazes met, but she didn\u2019t acknowledge me and instead turned to Sovieshu with her eyes shimmering with tears.\u201cYour Majesty, Rashta has no one to dance with.\u201d\u201cTake a break. You cannot dance with the same person twice in a row.\u201dRashta was similar to Prince Heinley. He, too, had no qualms about expressing his feelings, when most nobles would be too proud to voice their thoughts out loud.\u201cHing\u2026\u201dShe whined like a baby, and the surrounding nobles chuckled, not out of mockery, but of endearment. Rashta was not noble, and her behavior was rude, to say the least, but to everyone else she was like a fresh and pure novelty.\u201cLady Rashta, would you like to dance with me?\u201dSeveral other noblemen approached Rashta, but she weakly replied, \u201cNo thank you,\u201d then trudged towards the edge of the room. Sovieshu stiffened, as if he wanted to run towards her. If the music hadn\u2019t started at that moment, he might have really gone after her, but he stayed on the floor.Coincidentally, the music was calm and the dance required some distant from one\u2019s partner. Sovieshu and I had been dance partners since we were young, and we were used to falling into the rhythm together. As children, we held onto each other with laughter, complaining that the steps were awkward.\u2018Those days will never come anymore.\u2019When I remembered holding a large map and discussing new construction projects, I felt a chill in the corner of my heart. How stupid and naive I was at the time to believe Sovieshu and I would be together for the rest of our lives. When the dance finally brought us close to each other, I still felt like we were far apart.\u201cEarlier.\u201dSovieshu spoke in a low voice.\u201cWhat did you talk about with Prince Heinley?\u201d\u201cWe had a normal conversation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you heard the rumors about him?\u201dWhat did he mean by that? I didn\u2019t say anything for a while to focus on the complicated steps, but I didn\u2019t miss the crease between Sovieshu\u2019s eyebrows.\u201cWhat do you mean you had a \u2018normal\u2019 conversation with him?\u201d\u201cHe was very entertaining.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a womanizer, so of course he\u2019s entertaining. People like funny men.\u201dThe distance between us grew apart again. As I turned around, I saw Prince Heinley standing near a table and watching me. He smiled and waved one hand when our eyes met.\u201cI have Rashta as my concubine, so I won\u2019t tell you that you cannot take another man as your lover as well.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cStill, I don\u2019t believe it should be Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cIf you are with Prince Heinley, he will not be your concubine, but you will be his.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be disgraceful to the Empress of the Eastern Empire?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re imagining, but Prince Heinley and I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship.\u201d\u201cGood. Don\u2019t be the match for the fire that spreads everywhere.\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t\u2013\u201dI was about to protest that Prince Heinley wasn\u2019t like that, when Sovieshu suddenly came to a halt. The music hadn\u2019t stopped yet. Sovieshu was frozen on the floor, and I couldn\u2019t dance alone and stopped as well, jamming the traffic around us.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dWhat was the matter? I wondered if he sprained a foot, but Sovieshu strode away. The people around me looked on with puzzled expressions. Sovieshu finally stopped in front of Rashta. She was standing against the wall, crying.\u201cRashta. Why are you crying?\u201dSovieshu looked at her in surprise, and Rashta stretched out her arms and hugged him around the neck.The murmur of the crowd grew louder. I could feel the nobles\u2019 eyes on me. Sovieshu and I were dancing together, before he threw me away and went to Rashta.My jaw clenched. I felt blood drain from my head as my vision turned spotty. Rashta kept crying while Sovieshu tried to comfort her, and eventually her picked her up and they left.\u201cOh my god. So it\u2019s true that the Emperor loves the concubine.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs the two of them left, the gaze of the crowd pressed down harder on me.\u201cBut I heard she was a runaway slave. Is that true?\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\u201cNonsense. The Emperor just said it was a rumor.\u201d\u201cWatch your mouth. His Majesty said he would punish anyone that spoke of it.\u201d\u201cNo, wait a minute. Does the Eastern Empire allow runaways slaves to become concubines? This is not possible in our Northern Kingdom. I even brought her the Sea Jewels of the Northern Kingdom as a gift.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure the Emperor did nothing of the sort.\u201dThe music stopped, and everyone was either looking at me or talking about Rashta. I wanted nothing more than to flee the room, but I forced myself to walk calmly away.I had no idea where I was going, but I heard someone following my footsteps and glimpsed Prince Heinley\u2019s reflection on a smooth pillar. I did not feel like being civil and talking to a foreign prince. For now\u2026I just wanted to sit somewhere.I found myself walking through an empty palace corridor. Sir Artina, the deputy commander of the knights, fell into step beside me.\u201cAre you all right, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cYou should get some rest. You look pale.\u201dI nodded. I went to my chambers, passing the drawing room before going into the bedroom. I fell face down on the bed, hugging the pillow and curling up on myself. My whole body felt unbearably heavy. How much was I carrying on my shoulders?\u2013 Gu\u2026.There was a tap on glass, and I saw a Queen sitting by the window. I opened it wearily, and Queen entered, blinking his large eyes. I took the bird into my arms. As his heat spread from his warm little body into mine, tears burst out of my eyes.\u2013 \u2026How could this creature provide such great comfort? I soaked in the warmth Queen gave me like a person abandoned in a bitter winter. By the time I was finally calm, I realized I had been hugging the bird for too long. He was probably annoyed. I looked up, and to my surprise, Queen was simply peering at me.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u2013 Gu\u2026\u201cYou always give me strength.\u201dI was embarrassed to say it out loud and whispered it in his ear, and Quinn covered his face with his wings.\u201cSometimes you\u2019re like a real person.\u201d\u2013 !Queen\u2019s eyes widened and he darted around the room, and there was a commotion outside. The paper hanging above the bed fluttered, and I pulled him towards me.I rang the bell to signal my permission for them to come in, and the main door opened and voices came inside. I went into the drawing room with Queen in my arms, finding several ladies-in-waiting there, including Countess Eliza and Laura. They had come straight from the party, and were dressed more splendidly than usual. However, the clock showed that the end of the ball itself was some time away. Why were they here?\u201cCountess, what\u2019s going on?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Tears That Only Queen Knows (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough I wasn\u2019t expecting Countess Eliza, it was even more curious that Laura was here when she had been looking forward to the New Year\u2019s celebrations. Did I spoil the mood? Did they come after me because I ran away?Even so, I did not want to be consoled, strange as it may be. It was my pride that was injured when my husband loved another woman. There was nothing wrong with my reaction, but it was Sovieshu and Rashta that remained dignified while I shrank. I couldn\u2019t even explain this vague feeling, so I couldn\u2019t bring myself to speak about it.However, the way Sovieshu rushed to Rashta did not seem to be on their minds. Countess Eliza quickly fanned her face, and Laura kept nervously touching her curls.What was wrong? Come to think of it, everyone seemed to be quite agitated.\u201cYour Majesty. There was a messenger from the Verdi estate.\u201dCountess Eliza lowered her fan as she spoke, and I stood there in confusion.\u201cThe Verdi estate?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs it from Viscountess Verdi?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. The message said that Viscountess Verdi can no longer serve as the lady-in-waiting for the Empress.\u201dViscountess Verdi\u2026didn\u2019t she borrow money from me a few days ago? Back then she looked like she was at the end of her rope.\u201cAre you sure it was from Viscountess Verdi?\u201dI looked on in bewilderment. Her household was in massive debt because of the troubled actions of the husband and son. The debt was not enough to leave them on the streets, but most of their income had been used to pay it off. And now Viscountess Verdi was quitting her position as lady-in-waiting?Laura continued anxiously.\u201cShe quit in quite a hurry. Maybe Viscountess Verdi fought with her husband or son?\u201dAnother lady-in-waiting made a suggestion with a concerned look.\u201cIt might be a good idea to send someone to check on the situation.\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201d***The next day proved our worries over Viscountess Verdi unnecessary.I was not obligated to stand with Sovieshu to the banquet on the second day, so I relaxed a little as I went to the banquet hall myself. There were many noblewomen there, including Countess Eliza and Laura, and Princess Soju from the Southern Kingdom. Princess Soju was the typical southerner ideal, sweet and generous and a skilled conversationalist. Everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to what she said, when she suddenly looked over her shoulder and said, \u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201dWhen I turned around, Rashta was walking alone, smiling at the people around her. She seemed even more dazzling in the daytime. If our eyes met, she would come here as talk to me as if I were her sister again, so I turned my head away.\u201cOh my God.\u201dBut this time, Laura was staring at Rashta.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help my curiosity, and Laura answered with a glare at Rashta.\u201cThe blue silk she\u2019s wearing, Your Majesty. Isn\u2019t that the one Grand Duke Lilteang tried to gift to you?\u201dI looked back and saw Laura was telling the truth. Rashta was arrayed in a gown of blue silk. The ladies clicked their tongues.\u201cGrand Duke Lilteang is truly incredible.\u201d\u201cI know. He moved as soon as he was rejected by Her Majesty.\u201dI turned back again, and this time it was Countess Eliza that spoke, her voice low and confused.\u201cI don\u2019t think the silk was the only thing that went from the Empress to her.\u201dWhat was she talking about?This was starting to be a nuisance, but I looked back again, and his time I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away.Viscountess Verdi was standing next to Rashta, the day after Viscountess Verdi informed me that she couldn\u2019t be my lady-in-waiting. I didn\u2019t see her at first as she was hidden by someone else, but now I could see it clearly. Viscountess Verdi was next to Rashta. Laura had been worried about Viscountess Verdi all night, and she yelled sharply.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Is she mad?\u201dRashta and Viscountess Verdi looked over in our direction at the source of the loud noise. Viscountess Verdi quickly avoided my gaze when she saw me.\u201c\u2026\u201dI thought the gift of blue silk from Lilteang was amusing, but this time I was upset. The lady-in-waiting was standing next to the women who took my husband. She had borrowed a lot of money from me. I didn\u2019t know where Viscountess Verdi\u2019s plan came from or how she changed her mind, but before she was the one who mocked Rashta the most.\u201c\u2026\u201dCount Eliza and Laura said something next to me, but I didn\u2019t hear them. What should I say about this? Was I embarrassed? In disbelief? Was the concubine here to take everything of mine away?No. Perhaps Viscountess Verdi was not my companion from the beginning. Perhaps she was only with me for money, but I couldn\u2019t allow myself to look flustered. Princess Soju clicked her tongue.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the concubine system. There is no such strange system in the Southern Kingdom. In polite terms she a concubine, but isn\u2019t it still cheating? But since the law approves of her as a concubine, she holds her head high without realizing how shameful it is.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as you say. Isn\u2019t strange how she can pass in front of the Empress with her back held straight?\u201dLaura fired up in defense of me, while I ignored them and picked out the sweetest champagne. Yesterday I had left my seat and fled, so I thought I\u2019d stay as long as possible today. It wouldn\u2019t be easy though. While I appreciated everything that Princess Soju and the other ladies said, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it in public.I wondered how the story would spread. Everyone would pretend to be respectful on the surface, but they thought little of me for sending gifts to Rashta and would talk about me behind my back.\u201cShall we talk about something else?\u201dIn the end, I indirectly indicated that I did not want to discuss it. Fortunately, Princess Soju took no offense and redirected the conversation.\u201cOh, I heard an interesting story about Prince Heinley this morning.\u201d\u201cAn interesting story?\u201d\u201cIt was when we were eating together in the southern palace. I heard he exchanged letters anonymously with someone in the Eastern Empire.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cHe said he wanted to find them, and that they should meet him at the southern palace. The gossip is everywhere.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What is it?\u201dPrincess Soju noticed their gazes and turned to me. I knew that my ladies-in-waiting believed the \u201canonymous friend\u201d that Prince Heinley was looking for must be me.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy thoughts were the same. Was Queen\u2019s owner\u2026Prince Heinley? It could be a coincidence, but the chance that it was not was high.The ladies-in-waiting hesitated for my answer, but when I remained silent, they pretended not to know and turned to other things. Princess Soju\u2019s attention was caught elsewhere, but Laura leaned over to me.\u201cYour Majesty, that bird looks like a hybrid of an owl and an eagle. Do you think its owner might look like Prince Heinley?\u201dCountess Eliza nodded.\u201cI agree, Your Highness. I think this rumor might be about you.\u201dThe other ladies-in-waiting also looked at me with their eyes shining expectantly.\u201d \u2026I think so too.\u201dThe ladies covered their mouths and exchanged excited glances. But when I added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to come forward,\u201d they all turned crestfallen.\u201cYour Majesty, wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to be friends with someone as beautiful as Prince Heinley?\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley would love it even more if he found out that his letter partner was the Empress.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he ask you to dance?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cI want to stay a friend whose name or face he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dLaura sounded dismayed, but a glare from Countess Eliza quieted her. The Countess nodded as if she understood my thoughts.\u201cPrince Heinley has many scandals involving women. He has the reputation of a womanizer, and if his private correspondence turns out to be the Empress, everyone will give her strange looks.\u201dCountess Eliza gave a cold stare towards Rashta and Grand Duke Lilteang. The Grand Duke was standing in front of Rashta and laughing loudly.\u201cWe will have many enemies in the future, and they may think to spread malicious rumors. It\u2019s best to be cautious.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until Countess Eliza finished talking that Laura gave a small \u201cOh,\u201d and nodded.\u201cBut I am a little sad\u2026\u201d***\u201cSending letters when you don\u2019t know their identity is so romantic.\u201d\u201cIs that true? There are so many strange rumors about Prince Heinley, so it\u2019s hard to believe anything, right?\u201d\u201cBut if he\u2019s lying, then he won\u2019t find his \u2018friend\u2019 in public.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if the person is a friend or lover.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe the other person is married.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a woman, but wouldn\u2019t it be fun if it was a man?\u201dThe words were met with an outburst of laughter at Rashta\u2019s salon. Rashta lounged in her soft purple chair while she listened to the nobles\u2019 chatter. Cherily sat next to her, cooling her by waving a fan. As Rashta listened wordlessly to the conversation, Prince Lilteang gave a hearty chuckle and turned to Rashta.\u201cWhy are you so quiet, Lady Rashta? You\u2019re not the one who wrote those romantic letters, are you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Rashta.\u201d\u201cReally? Don\u2019t you think Miss Rashta\u2019s sweet tongue would be enough to enthrall Prince Heinley?\u201dRashta smile and shook her head, and encouraged the party to continue on with their conversation. She thought nobles only told solemn stories, and she found it interesting that both slaves and aristocrats indulged in the same kind of provocative gossip. She sat there drinking her tea, but she noticed that Viscountess Verdi had not said a word.\u201cViscountess Verdi? What\u2019s wrong? Are you feeling sick?\u201dRashta spoke to her gently. Viscountess Verdi gave a start, but then shook her head and smiled.\u201cDo you want to go back to the Empress?\u201dThe nobles suddenly stopped talking and looked at the woman.\u201cThat will not happen.\u201dThe Viscountess offered another smile and shook her head.\u201cNow I serve Miss Rashta.\u201dThe rest of the nobles turned their conversation back to Prince Heinley again, and the lady-in-waiting gave a small sigh.\u201c\u2026\u201dRashta tilted her head and studied the older woman\u2019s profile.\u201cViscountess Verdi, if you want to return to the empress, you can be honest with Rashta.\u201dEventually, Rashta spoke to her again after all the other nobles had left and there was only her and the two maids.\u201cI don\u2019t want to return, really, Miss Rashta.\u201dViscountess Verdi answered her quickly, but Rashta was not convinced.Viscountess Verdi, who had taken up the position as Rashta\u2019s lady-in-waiting through Baron Lant, was someone who had stood steadfastly by the Empress\u2019 side ever since she took the throne. For this reason, Baron Lant chose Viscountess Verdi, who was dire in need of money. When a former lady-in-waiting of the Empress becoming Rashta\u2019s lady-in-waiting, Rashta\u2019s reputation rose.But even Rashta was not overly familiar with Viscountess Verdi. The lady-in-waiting was here because of money, and was not as reliable as Cherily or Kisu. Maybe Viscountess Verdi noticed the slight air of distrust, but she made excuses while having the eyes of a startled rabbit.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I want to go back to the Empress, Miss Rashta.\u201d\u201cBut it seemed like\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen they were talking about Prince Heinley, I\u2026I just remembered something about the Empress.\u201dRashta\u2019s look of distrust vanished.\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor about Prince Heinley, but what does it have to do with the Empress?\u201dRashta had already been rejected by the Prince twice. Viscountess Verdi nervously fidgeted with her teacup, but she had already started speaking and Rashta was staring at her with bright eyes.\u201cThe\u2026\u201dShe had no choice but to confess.\u201cThe letter acquaintance that Prince Heinley is looking for. It\u2019s Her Majesty the Empress\u2026\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes rounded. Cherily, who was fanning Rashta, looked on in surprise.\u201cReally?\u201dViscountess Verdi replied with a quick \u201cYes\u201d to Rashta.\u201cBut the Empress won\u2019t come forward even if the letter acquaintance is Prince Heinley. She is very proud.\u201dCherily gave a giggle.\u201cAre you sure the Empress and the Prince Heinley exchanged letters without knowing each other?\u201d\u201cThe Empress knows now. But she didn\u2019t at the time.\u201dRashta\u2019s curiosity was aroused, but she didn\u2019t say anything and contemplated the information carefully. Viscountess Verdi glanced towards Rashta to see if she had said something offensive. After a long moment, Rashta finally spoke.\u201cThen Viscountess Verdi knows a little about the letters that the Empress and Prince Heinley exchanged?\u201d\u201cI\u2026yes?\u201dViscountess Verdi\u2019s voice quivered, and a playful smile spread across Rashta\u2019s face.\u201cCan we make it so it looks like the letter acquaintance is Cherily?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry? You want to deceive Prince Heinley?\u201dViscountess Verdi burst out angrily. Rashta gave a peal of laughter and held the hem of Cherily\u2019s dress.\u201cIt\u2019s not deceiving. I\u2019m just playing around.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said it yourself, Viscountess. The Empress would never come forward.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026you would still be deceiving a member of the royal family\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know the contents of the letter?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about any recent ones, Miss Rashta. Prince Heinley might ask about it.\u201d\u201cHe may not ask.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cHow did they exchange letters? Even if they passed it through someone in the middle\u2026huh, I wonder.\u201d\u201cBut Miss Rashta\u2026\u201d\u201cIf he finds out, we can say it was a joke. If things go well, the Prince will fall in love with Cherily. Right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The man was a knight, though not a citizen of the Eastern Empire.\u201cWho are you running an errand for?\u201d\u201cOh, no. I wanted to tell him something\u2026\u201dThe knight tilted his head as he observed the woman.\u201cYou?\u201dThough woman was neatly dressed, she didn\u2019t look like a noblewoman. She had to be a servant working in the palace. He found it difficult to fathom why the Prince would want to meet with a foreign maid.\u201cI hear the prince is looking for his letter acquaintance\u2026\u201dThe knight\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYou\u2019re the one Prince Heinley is looking for?\u201dCoincidentally, the knight was of the Western Kingdom, the same as Prince Heinley. At the knight\u2019s distrustful look, the maid\u2014Cherily\u2014turned red and cried, \u201cYes!\u201d Rashta had persuaded her that she could play it as a joke if it didn\u2019t work out, but if it did, she could win the love of a beautiful prince. She was still terrified, however,\u201c\u2026\u201dThe knight stared silently at Cherily then turned around.\u201cCome this way, please.\u201dCherily anxiously followed the knight. Viscountess Verdi had told her about the contents of the letters, but considering the time when the lady-in-waiting returned to her estate, Cherily was uneasy about not knowing the recent exchanges. Rashta reassured her that she didn\u2019t have to know, but\u2026\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dCherily stopped, swallowing dryly and staring straight ahead. The knight knocked on the door and announced the maid\u2019s visit.\u201cYour Highness, a woman has arrived claiming that she was the one exchanging letters with you.\u201dBut no matter how long they waited, no one answered.\u201cOh. Did he step out?\u201dThe grumbling knight told Cherily to wait in the drawing room, and she sat motionless in the empty space. It must have been an hour before the knight finally came back and said, \u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019ll be seeing you now.\u201d\u201cWhat? Now?\u201dThe door to the empty drawing room was not closed, and the sofa she was sitting in faced towards the corridor. She hadn\u2019t seen anyone passing by. But the Prince was here?\u2018Maybe he was inside the whole time and pretended he wasn\u2019t\u2026\u2019Cherily\u2019s unease grew, but she stood up quickly and followed the knight. The bedroom door opened.Inside this door, she could be humiliated, or her future could be changed. If things went well, she would be like Rashta\u2026Cherily cautiously ventured inside the room. Inside the large space stood two windows wide open, the curtains drifting inwards from the breeze. A tall man stood between the curtains. He was partially nude, wearing only an open thin robe.\u2018That\u2019s Prince Heinley\u2026\u2019Cherily\u2019s eyes widened.The man\u2019s light hair scattered in the breeze. He was more handsome than the rumors even suggested. If an angel came descended to this earth, he would certainly look like this. However, the moment Cherily looked into his sharp purple eyes, she was struck by the thought he might be more devil than angel. He seemed ethereal at first glance, but soon she felt a chilling undercurrent. Cherily\u2019s instincts told her to run away.However, the moment their eyes met, Prince Heinley offered her a gentle smile, and she pushed away that instinctive feeling.\u201cMy Lady, are you the one I\u2019ve been exchanging letters with?\u201d\u201cY-yes.\u201dPrince Heinley raised his eyebrows, and Cherily stared back, her heart pounding. She thought he would ask for proof, but he did not say anything. Her heart thumped louder. After a long moment, he smiled.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to ask you for sure. The person I am looking for is very precious to me.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI would be very happy if you were my letter acquaintance, but if not\u2026I would be so disappointed that I don\u2019t know what I would do.\u201dShe heard the implied threat. Prince Heinley approached her and smiled benignly again.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s you, My Lady?\u201d***I was having friendly lunch with the nobles I knew. Princess Soju, who I had become close with yesterday, arrived at the table with a bottle of wine.*\u201cThis is a speciality of our Southern Kingdom. Consider it my apology for being late.\u201dAs people looked towards her, Princess Soju smiled, then seated herself and placed the wine bottle on the table. Laura turned to the Princess, who she was seated next to.\u201cHave you heard?\u201d\u201cWhat is the gossip?\u201dPrincess Soju gave a broad smile.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve only just heard, so not many people are talking about it yet.\u201dThe table pressed Laura for the gossip, and she lowered her voice conspiratorially, her eyes shining.\u201cI heard it on the way. Someone said they knew Prince Heinley\u2019s letter acquaintance.\u201dLaura\u2019s eyes fell on me, and I reflexively furrowed my brow. It was one thing for me not to come forward, and another for someone else to pretend to be me.\u201cWho did they say it was?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. I heard it was Miss Rashta\u2019s maid.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Furthermore, my letter friend and I were still communicating with each other. Why would she tell such a fragile lie when she could so easily be caught? Did Rashta have anything to do with this?\u2018Did Viscountess Verdi tell Rashta about the letters?\u2019Perhaps Laura was thinking the same thing, and she gave me an odd look. I shook my head at her and smiled. If the maid was caught lying, she would be responsible for it.I didn\u2019t have to worry about it.***Paul McKenna was leader of the Order of the Dragon\u2014a group of knights personally led by Prince Heinley\u2014as well as Heinley\u2019s personal assistant.Though not listed on the family tree, McKenna was Prince Heinley\u2019s bastard cousin, and also served as a close aide. He excelled in literature and martial arts, and the more likely it seemed that Prince Heinley would succeed the throne, the more attention McKenna received as well. Everyone praised him for being a supportive knight to the free and windy prince. But that was only the story of strangers. McKenna himself viewed himself not only as the prince\u2019s support, but as his most powerful chess piece.\u201cDo you know what everyone is talking about?\u201dIt was the same routine again. McKenna just couldn\u2019t understand what was inside Prince Heinley\u2019s head.\u201cWhy? What are they talking about?\u201dPrince Heinley offered him a smile, and a muscle tensed on McKenna\u2019s forehead. He hated that sly smile.\u201cThe rumor that the prince of a nation had been searching for a palace maid. It\u2019s a romantic story. Everyone is curious about it, and when I pass them by that\u2019s all they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cThis is no time to smile. What if in a few days it spreads throughout the capital?\u201d\u201cThen leave me alone for a few days.\u201dPrince Heinley looked on nonchalantly, and McKenna sighed.\u201cWhy are you allowing this deception go on? You know the maid didn\u2019t write those letters.\u201dA slight crease formed between the Prince\u2019s eyebrows.\u201cHow did you know that again? \u201c\u201cDo you think I only see you once every few years, Your Highness? Just by looking at your expression I can tell you\u2019re pretending. Your whole face is absolutely covered in pain, so of course she isn\u2019t the one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBy chance, have you fallen in love with her and you\u2019re willingly letting yourself be deceived?\u201dThinking as if he understood the case, McKenna took one step back. However, the prince\u2019s face turned like stone, and McKenna realized that his assumptions were false.\u201cThen why on earth are you letting it happen? You have to tell me what you\u2019re thinking so I can prepare for what\u2019s going on.\u201dTears of frustration formed on McKenna\u2019s eyes. Even if Prince Heinley did this without intention, the results had always been the same. In most cases, it was McKenna that had to clean up the Prince\u2019s mess, whether the outcome was good or bad. McKenna at least wanted a forewarning.\u201cI want to make a happy dream.\u201d\u201c\u2026That you\u2019re in love?\u201d\u201cNo, not like that, McKenna.\u201d\u201cBut why a happy dream? Do you have nightmares?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s safer to wake up from a nightmare. Reality is more comfortable.\u201d\u201cI\u2026suppose?\u201d\u201cBut what if you wake up from a happy dream?\u201d\u201cIt feels like a futile death.\u201dPrince Heinley grinned, pretending to shoot a gun with his fingers.\u201cExactly. I warned the maid clearly. If she tells a lie, I will become so angry that I won\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d\u201cSo you will make her happy then abandon her?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s smile widened even more.\u201cYou have a bad personality, you know?\u201dMcKenna clicked his tongue.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to punish her for deceiving the royal family?\u201dIt would be simpler, and he couldn\u2019t see why Prince Heinley would go through the trouble of this trick.\u201cNo. I believe that wounds of the heart are deeper than wounds of the body.\u201d\u201d \u2026In extreme cases, you can jail her or flog her.\u201d\u201cOf course not, McKenna. That would make me look bad. \u201dPrince Heinley then softly criticized him for being a half-wit, and McKenna clenched his jaw.\u201cWhy would I break the impression of a playful and womanizing prince because of a liar?\u201dMcKenna sighed.\u201cYes, Your Highness. You will do as you wish. But when are you going to see the real letter acquaintance? You already know who it is.\u201d\u201cI know. But they will deny it if I tell them. And I can\u2019t say I\u2019m the bird, can I?\u201d\u201cThat is strictly a secret.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll show it to you.\u201d\u201cThe transformation?\u201d\u201cThe art of finding. That my friend and I will certainly meet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It didn\u2019t have the priority of neither the first nor the last day, and everyone wanted to enjoy themselves in the city or socialize with the people they had befriended. That had been the pattern for three years. Until now.\u201cThere are many people here today, Your Majesty.\u201dCountess Eliza clicked her tongue.\u201cI suppose it\u2019s because of the rumors about the prince and the maid.\u201dI spoke in a disinterested manner. I still hadn\u2019t decided out how I should react to this. It was both awkward and amusing to think about.Rashta\u2014who was surrounded by other nobles sans Sovieshu\u2014was the one that looked more concerned, however, and kept glancing at Duchess Tuania.\u2018Do they know each other?\u2019There was the sound of the door opening. I looked up, expecting Sovieshu to enter, but it was Prince Heinley instead. On his arm was Cherily, Rashta\u2019s maid.\u201cMy god. He actually brought her here.\u201dCountess Eliza spoke in a whispered awe, then tutted once again. Cherily looked much brighter in a pale pink gown compared to her servant uniform.\u201cThat dress looks very expensive.\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley bought it for her, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cThey look good together somehow. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because they had been searching for someone they were in love with.\u201dThe room started to buzz with gossip. At that moment, Prince Heinley looked straight towards me. I nodded in greeting towards him, but he made a strange expression, then frowned and shook his head.\u2018What does that mean?\u2019I wondered at that unusual exchange, but before I could think about it more, Prince Heinley walked away with Cherily in tow. Sovieshu entered the room soon after, and looked round then headed towards Rashta.\u201c\u2026\u201dI turned away, picking up a glass from a passing servant. I didn\u2019t check what drink it was, until my taste buds informed me it was strawberry juice. It was very sweet, a contrast to my mood. Then, the music started to play. I was in no mood for dancing, so I settled myself on a couch by the wall and talked to guests.However, some time after, a commotion in the middle of the room interrupted my conversation. I looked up and saw everyone\u2019s eyes were turned towards Prince Heinley, who looked heartbroken, and Rashta\u2019s maid, whose face was blotched red with tears. The sweet atmosphere from only a few hours ago had completely dissipated. One was terrified, while the other looked like he was suppressing his anger. What was happening? I couldn\u2019t hear well from here, and I stood up and made my way towards the crowd.\u201cWhy did you deceive me? I told you, I was searching for someone important.\u201dWhen I got close enough, I could hear Prince Heinley\u2019s voice and immediately understood the situation. The maid had been caught lying. She was completely red in the face, and could barely choke out an answer.\u201cThis is absurd.\u201dPrince Heinley exhaled as he waited for the maid\u2019s reply.\u201cIs this what servants do in the Eastern Empire? Deceive royalty? No, regardless of status, that is still deception, is it not?\u201dIt was unclear if he was ranting to himself or speaking caustically, but some nobles glared at the maid and one muttered under their breath,\u201cBringing disgrace to the country\u2026.\u201dThe maid heard it and turned redder than before.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dI turned to the noblewoman next to me, and she lowered her voice to explain.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. They were having a friendly conversation, but I think the prince was questioning the maid.\u201dShe thought for a moment before continuing.\u201cI believe that the maid didn\u2019t know the exact details of the letters.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you for telling me.\u201dThe noblewoman again turned to the scene of the prince and the maid.I considered the situation for a moment. If it didn\u2019t calm down, then it would be best for me to step in and interrupt. But if the maid did wrong to Prince Heinley, it was her or her master, Rashta, that had to apologize.The maid trembled, staring at Rashta as if she had the same thought. But Rashta only looked on in surprise, and seemed unwilling to step in. I had no choice. I had to do it.\u201cYou know what I believe? I don\u2019t think you completely lied to me, is that right?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d\u201cI thought you completely deceived me at first. But I\u2019m not a fool. I\u2019m sure that you know about the letters.\u201dPrince Heinley voice was low, but his voice easily carried in the room. I wasn\u2019t the only one that looked surprised. The maid lied, but that didn\u2019t mean she knew nothing\u2026I didn\u2019t know if Rashta was involved, but Viscountess Verdi had to be responsible, at least.\u201cYou know what I think? I think you weren\u2019t the one that exchanged letters with me\u2014but you know who did. You are the go-between. Correct?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is your master?\u201dPrince Heinley smiled.\u201cIsn\u2019t your master the one I\u2019ve been looking for?\u201dMy tongue felt thick in my mouth. What a complete misunderstanding\u2026Despite his bold reasoning, the prince\u2019s eyes looked cold.\u2018Is that only anger in his eyes?\u2019Rashta, who had not said a word so far, sighed and stepped forward.\u201cI thought Prince Heinley was just a playful man when we exchanged letters. You\u2019re surprisingly sharp.\u201dRashta wasn\u2019t just coming forward. She spoke with a nuance that suggested she knew him through the letters, and the nobles exchanged glances with each either. Prince Heinley looked up at Rashta with his eyebrows raised, then smiled.\u201cLady Rashta. You sound like the person I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d\u201cThat is right. The one you were looking for is me.\u201dWhat? Were Rashta and the maid conspiring together?No, I didn\u2019t think so. Rashta\u2019s maid looked completely shocked. Prince Heinley studied Rashta carefully with an unreadable expression on his face.\u201cWhy did you send the maid in your place?\u201d\u201cBecause Rashta is the Emperor\u2019s woman. You and I are just friends, of course, but Rashta was worried his Majesty would be offended.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though I think of you as my friend, I hope you won\u2019t take offense either.\u201dRashta rounded her eyes as she spoke, while Prince Heinley tilted his head. It was as if time had frozen when he looked down at her. Then he burst out in laughter.Rashta flinched. Prince Heinley seemed to easily read Rashta\u2019s lie and he found it endlessly amusing. Or perhaps I only saw it because I already knew Rashta wasn\u2019t telling the truth\u2026\u201cDoes he know she\u2019s lying?\u201dLaura whispered in my ear. So it wasn\u2019t only my eyes. Could it still be an illusion? For a moment derision flashed in Prince Heinley\u2019s eyes, but then he smiled without asking for proof.\u201cI see. I wasn\u2019t offended at all. But what if you\u2019re a fake again?\u201d\u201cAre you done thinking? You can check as much as you please. Rashta is confident.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s quite alright. I do not believe Lady Rashta would not lie about this.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRashta answered with a surety, and the corner of Heinley\u2019s mouth crept up.\u201cI hope it\u2019s true this time, Lady Rashta. The second lie is likely to make me even more angry.\u201dHis eyes turned to the maid who told the first lie. His friendly look from earlier was gone, and the iciness of his gaze forced the maid to bow her head.\u201cBecause she impersonated you, Lady Rashta, would you take care of the punishment?\u201dWhen Rashta nodded, he straightened his back and left.***\u201cDear god, who knew she was such a fox?!\u201dAs soon as I returned to the western palace, my ladies-in-waiting exploded in anger.\u201cYour Majesty, will you let that lowly thing go around like that?\u201d\u201cEven after becoming the emperor\u2019s concubine, she tried to befriend the prince of another country by lying!\u201d\u201cHow dare she!\u201dCountess Eliza was usually so composed, but now she was fanning herself furiously.\u201cThe Prince knows that Rashta is a fake, so don\u2019t become too upset.\u201dI couldn\u2019t let the ladies-in-waiting be, so I said something to calm them down. The ladies stared at me in surprise, as if wondering why I was so complacent. Laura snorted angrily.\u201cAt first he seemed a bit suspicious, but then he knew it! It was obvious that he knew he was deceived!\u201dAnother lady chimed in.\u201cMaybe Rashta thinks she can trick him with her pretty face.\u201d\u201cIf he thought Rashta was genuine, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated.\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting nodded in agreement.\u201cSo Prince Heinley is deliberately letting himself be deceived by her lies?\u201d\u201cI believe so. It\u2019s strange for him to be cheated twice in the same way. The only strange thing is\u2026\u201dWhy? Perhaps, as one of the ladies claimed, he liked Rashta, regardless of whether she was lying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As far as I could recall, we had not communicated ever since Rashta\u2019s maid pretended to be me. Only a few hours before that revelation, Queen had been playing in my room. My mood turned somber as I remembered his chirping and the last time I hugged him. Should I raise a bird, as just Countess Eliza said?\u2018No. Other birds are not like Queen.\u2019\u201cAre you thinking about Queen?\u201dCountess Eliza seemed to understand my innermost thoughts as I kept glancing at the window. I smiled awkwardly and didn\u2019t answer. I missed Queen, but if I said that out loud it could be interpreted as me wanting to see Prince Heinley. Due to that, I was cautious.Instead of prodding me for an answer, Countess Eliza pulled out a light pink dress from the wardrobe. The dress had a thin, falling silhouette and was a little less extravagant then the dresses of the past three days.\u201cYou won\u2019t be going to a large banquet tonight, so I will dress you more elegantly, Your Majesty.\u201dTomorrow was the last day of the New Year\u2019s celebrations, as well as the day of the special banquet. However, since its attendees usually changed from year to year, there was usually a preview dinner the prior evening for the guests to become more acquainted, as Countess Eliza mentioned. It was a bit unreasonable to wear an extravagant dress to dinner when it was only a relatively small gathering.\u201cThank you, as always.\u201d\u201cI am honored.\u201dThanks to Countess Eliza\u2019s preparations, my straight hair was styled in waves and my pale complexion looked rosy. With her assistance, I slipped into the dress and studied myself in the mirror, then left for the central palace.No one came to work during large holidays, but I wanted to look over a few documents. I went to my office and looked over the guest list for the special banquet. In addition to having to carry polite conversation with the foreign guests, I had to familiarize myself with their culture as to not accidentally offend them.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe most noteworthy guests were Prince Heinley and Grand Duke Kapmen. Prince Heinley was especially a prominent figure.\u2018I have to be careful with Grand Duke Kapmen as well\u2026\u2019Grand Duke Kapmen was the only guest from another continent, who hailed from the great desert nation of Rwibt. He was invited not only because he was a great man, but also because he was a foreign student who graduated at the top of the magic academy. There was not much exchange across the continents, and the trade merchants did not linger long. Little was known about the court etiquette of Rwibt. One of the few books on the nation was \u201cThe Travelogue,\u201d written after an adventurer\u2019s visit to the desert country. I had heard that Grand Duke Kapmen had mocked the book and said it was not in the least bit accurate.\u2018He\u2019s already been studying overseas for a few years, and he should be treated like he\u2019s one of us\u2026\u2019After some lengthy research and learning, the time for the dinner arrived.When I left my office, I found Countess Eliza and Sir Artina nervously standing outside, and they called out \u201cYour Majesty!\u201d when they saw me.\u201cI was wondering if I should go in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been checking the clock.\u201dAt Countess Eliza\u2019s urging, I went back to my room where she touched up my hair and makeup, before heading to the eastern palace.\u201cSister!\u201dRashta was the first person I saw when I entered the dining room. She covered her mouth in surprise, then smiled and said, \u201cYour Majesty!\u201dMy smooth expression almost crumbled. Was Rashta among the twenty special guests tomorrow? No, I had checked the list only a while ago. Sovieshu must have brought her here. While one could not attend the special banquet without an invitation, those who were not invited could still go to the dinner.A moment later, Prince Heinley, Sovieshu and Princess Soju entered the dining room. Princess Soju looked at me as if to say, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 but I shook my head and went towards my seat. Prince Heinley said hello to me, and I only gave him a slight nod. I could feel Princess Soju\u2019s eyes in my direction, but I didn\u2019t acknowledge it and took my seat with my head pounding. It was only after a servant poured water into my glass that Princess Soju leaned over and whispered quietly to me.\u201cI thought it was a joke until a while ago.\u201dHer voice was so low that I could barely hear it.\u201cWhat was?\u201dShe glanced over at the Prince.\u201cPrince Heinley. I believe the rumor that he is a womanizer is true. He acts so sweetly to Miss Rashta in front of His Majesty, I thought he was some kind of human custard.\u201d\u201cPub!\u201dHer expression sent me into a coughing fit as I drank from my glass, while the Princess smiled in amusement. Prince Heinley\u2019s, Rashta\u2019s, and Sovieshu\u2019s attention turned towards me at the same time, and I quickly schooled my expression and covered my mouth with a handkerchief.Now that Princess Soju pointed it out, the atmosphere did seem strange. Prince Heinley was aloof and mysterious as always, but Sovieshu seemed more on edge than usual. From time to time he shot glances between Prince Heinley and Rashta. And Rashta\u2026she seemed to be enjoying the situation. Her cheeks were more flushed than usual at the attention of both the Emperor and the Prince.\u2018If it had been Rashta that Prince Heinley was with from the beginning, then what would have happened\u2026?\u2019My heart throbbed at the sudden thought, but I soon shook it away. Even if it wasn\u2019t Rashta, Sovieshu would have still brought in a concubine one day. Princess Soju leaned towards me again.\u201cStrange. Prince Heinley was so openly sweet on Miss Rashta before. Not now.\u201dI did not bother looking in their direction this time. Soon after, the table filled up with all the guests, and the servants brought in the first course\u2014mulled wine, fresh celery, salmon with potatoes, and chicken poached in wine.It was well into the middle of a long meal when, suddenly, there was a sharp crash. The dining room turned silent. Sovieshu was staring at Prince Heinley, his golden goblet spilled over his plate. Everyone watched them with bated breath.\u201cThat\u2019s rude, Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s rude? Is it rude of me to point out that the one who claimed to exchange letters with me doesn\u2019t know the contents of said letters? Is it rude for me to protest when I find out later she\u2019s deceiving me?\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley. Watch your language.\u201d\u201cTell your concubine to be careful.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cThis is disgraceful. First the maid, then her master Lady Rashta. Are you scorning the Western Kingdom, scorning me, or scorning my promises?\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers, while Prince Heinley leaned back against his seat and stared at Sovieshu coldly.\u201cOh, perhaps\u2014Did His Majesty order Lady Rashta to do it? Use me?\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was confused for a moment. The contents can be confusing, can\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cDoes it make sense to confuse half the contents of the letters?\u201dSovieshu turned even redder the face. Princess Soju was riveted on them as if she were entertained, and she set down her fork and started eating cookies as she were watching a play.\u201cGoodness\u2026So Lady Rashta has a poor brain? Ten things, half forgotten? If her wit is the issue, then I\u2019ll admit my wrong.\u201dIn an instant, the atmosphere turned ugly. I could only hear the sound of Princess Soju eating the cookies. With her lively and dependable personality, she showed her curiosity to the fullest extent.\u201cAm I the strange one here, everyone? The lady sitting here, Rashta, called herself my friend yesterday. I believed it because I thought that a famous lady like Rashta wouldn\u2019t lie, and I spent all day honoring her. And as Princess Soju put it, I was as soft as a human custard.\u201dPrincess Soju flinched.\u2018Prince Heinley has good ears.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe Princess automatically sided with Prince Heinley in return for him calling her out. Prince Heinley looked around and spoke again.\u201cBut there was something strange during our conversation. Lady Rashta didn\u2019t know more than half of what she has exchanged with me. She knew nothing about our recent exchanges. Isn\u2019t it strange that she doesn\u2019t know half the contents, as well as the contents from only one or two letters ago? Lady Rashta\u2019s maid didn\u2019t know that as well.\u201dEveryone nodded, and Rashta\u2019s ears turned red. Sovieshu glared at Prince Heinley as if he could shoot lightning from his eyes.\u201cEnough of this, Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cIt was supposed to be a quiet matter, but it was the Emperor of the Eastern Empire that brought it out to the open.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t a knight protect his lady if she\u2019s in trouble? If the Western Kingdom condemns a poor woman over a trivial matter and calls that chivalry, then there\u2019s nothing left for me to explain.\u201d\u201cNo, no. My lady was falsely impersonated, and I must protect her too.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA playful smile lifted on the Prince\u2019s mouth.\u201cOf course, my letter acquaintance may be a man, not a lady.\u201dHis gaze fell on me for a moment, and my heart ran cold. It occurred to me that I wrote \u2018I am a man\u2019 as a hint.\u2018He\u2019s mistaken\u2026right?\u2019Even if Prince Heinley discovered that Rashta was the false friend, there was still no way he could tell I was the real one.It was then.Rashta, who had not said a word so far, whimpered, \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d Everyone\u2019s eyes shifted from Sovieshu and Prince Heinley towards Rashta, who sniffled as if she were the main character in a play. One of Prince Heinley\u2019s eyebrows lifted.\u201cWhy did you try to deceive me again, Lady Rashta? Why did you play a trick with the maid?\u201dRashta let out a sob.\u201cI said the contents of the letter exactly. But Prince Heinley keeps insisting it\u2019s a lie.\u201dWhat on earth\u2026My lips parted at that moment. What did she just say? Tears started to stream down her eyes.\u201cI think I know why you\u2019re doing this. Is it because Rashta is not the kind of person you wanted? Were all the gestures of friendship you sent to Rashta false?\u201dShe was the image of a tragic heroine who had been wrongly abandoned. Sovieshu clenched his jaw as he glared at the Prince.\u201cIs that true?\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s shoulders jerked as he laughed, then he sighed and shook his head.\u201cYou must be crazy.\u201d\u201cAre you accusing of Rashta being a liar because you saw her with His Majesty?\u201dI once believed Rashta\u2019s naivety came from innocence and ignorance. Now I knew that she was deviously cunning woman. Prince Heinley clicked his tongue.\u201cLady Rashta. You are the most brazen person I have ever met.\u201d\u201cFor the sake of our friendship, please don\u2019t keep saying things that will hurt Rashta.\u201dRashta dissolved into tears, and some of the surrounding nobles began to look uncomfortable. For those who didn\u2019t know the truth, Rashta appeared so confident in the truth that they were confused to what was real. Princess Soju was busy watching with wide eyes with her cookies in her mouth, while Duchess Tuania calmly watched the situation with her arms folded.In the meanwhile, only Grand Duke Kapmen was delicately working on his meal. With his long, sharp eyes and healthy caramel-colored skin, he moved his utensils with a dull expression, as if he found the whole affair tiresome.\u2018I should come forward and say that I\u2019m Prince Heinley\u2019s letter acquaintance\u2026\u2019I stared blankly at Kapmen as I agonized over the decision. If I sided with the Prince, the others would mock not only Rashta, but also Sovieshu who had stood up for her. However, I didn\u2019t want to see Prince Heinley be blamed because of Rashta. The friendship that Rashta repeatedly claimed was hers was between me and Prince Heinley.At that moment, Grand Duke Kapmen, who was eating like a machine, looked paused and looked up at me in surprise. I nodded slightly as our eyes met. Kapmen stared at me without responding, then he looked at Rashta and Prince Heinley then smiled quietly.\u2018What\u2019s the matter with him?\u2019However, it wasn\u2019t the abnormal behavior of Grand Duke Kapmen that was the problem at this moment.\u2018I wanted to stay quiet, but there is a misunderstanding. I should fix it.\u2019I finished debating internally with myself and readied myself to speak. Everyone turned to me. They seemed to be enjoying the whirlwind of events. Only Rashta was staring at me with her eyes wide open. Suddenly, it occurred to me that Viscountess Verdi must have told her I was the letter acquaintance, and I felt a sense of irony in the situation. I couldn\u2019t understand why Rashta thought she could pretend to be me and think I would stay quiet.I spoke to Sovieshu, keeping my face as still as possible.\u201cYour Majesty, I know who it was that exchanged letters with Prince Heinley\u2026and it was not Rashta.\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s face lit up. Rashta, on the other hand, stared at me with a look of betrayal, while Sovieshu\u2019s face turned white.\u201cEmpress.\u201dHe addressed me in a low voice.\u201cThis is not a matter for you to decide. Just because you dislike Rashta doesn\u2019t mean you should take Prince Heinley\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cI am only on the side of truth.\u201dAs soon as I was finished, Prince Heinley spoke up acidly.\u201cYour Majesty the Empress. It must be frustrating that the Emperor treats all the words from Lady Rashta\u2019s lips as truth.\u201dThe remark bled the last of Sovieshu\u2019s patience.\u201cI cannot tolerate this anymore.\u201dSovieshu stood up and drew out his sword. It was a decorative piece not made for combat, but it was enough to injure a defenseless person. The mood in the room quickly became tense.\u201cPrince Heinley, how dare you defile my honor. I challenge you to a duel.\u201d\u201cIf I kill you now, may I leave here safely? Then, I will accept the duel.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The latter whom was invited as a guest, with the former\u2019s concubine dividing the two?It would be quite a spectacle. If it became known to the public, the already much-criticized lives of the nobles and royal families would become the subject of further mockery and gossip.Of course, with or without the rumors, the fight should be stopped.\u201cCalm down, Your Majesty. Prince Heinley, you are our guest.\u201dI raised my voice at them, and to my great fortune they were not fools.\u201cPlease take your seats.\u201dThey both sat down, and the meal continued quietly. I\u2019ve never had such a trying meal the eve before the special banquet.My stomach turned. What on earth was happening? Was it because of Rashta or Sovieshu? Or perhaps both?No one was in the mood to eat anymore, so I finally set down my fork and patted my mouth with a napkin. After only half a meal, I stood up to see the guests off instead of offering them dessert. It would be rude to keep them in this uncomfortable atmosphere, and we would meet again tomorrow evening in any case.I made for the hall and the guests quickly followed me, leaving behind Sovieshu and Heinley in the dining room. As soon as the door closed, Princess Soju came up to me and spoke with a frown creased on her face.\u201cI hope we can talk more tomorrow, Your Majesty. Tonight\u2019s not a good night for conversation.\u201d\u201cOf course. I hope so, too.\u201dMeeting Princess Soju might have been the best thing to have happened to me this New Year\u2019s celebration. Her strong, funny and friendly nature was a joy to be around. I hugged her and whispered a fond farewell.\u201cPlease come tomorrow.\u201dPrincess Soju smiled and nodded, then left with her knights down the hallway. I gave my farewells to the other nobles with more formality.When there were about a handful of nobles left, I saw Rashta approach me. I thought she had something to say, but instead of talking she stood by my side. Why was she here? I wanted to ask her that, but Emperor Sirim of Blue Bohean approached next.\u201cPlease come and see Rashta tomorrow. Thank you for coming tonight, Your Highness.\u201dAs soon as I bowed, Rashta mimicked me, as if we were seeing him off together.\u201cUh\u2026yes.\u201dEmperor Sirim answered in a stammering tone, and he looked between me and Rashta then turned away. He seemed to think I was bowing to him together with Rashta.Rashta turned to look at me and asked in an amiable voice, \u201cAre you alright, sister?\u201d This situation was absurd, but there was no convention or precedent that I could use to stop her.I deliberately broke away from Rashta and approached Marquis Samonew, one of our allies. However, Rashta followed my footsteps again and smiled coquettishly at him, making the Marquis laugh. She continued this until there was only Grand Duke Kapmen left.Did she have to courage to approach him? She came up to him, speaking in a gentle voice.\u201cMy Lord.\u201dAt that moment, goose flesh erupted on my skin. Her voice had suddenly changed. Earlier, she had been bright and playful, but now her tone had taken on a deeper quality. She was imitating my voice. It wasn\u2019t a perfect recreation, but it was close.\u201cWill you be attending the special banquet tomorrow?\u201dHer words evaporated in the air as the Grand Duke passed us in silence. It was more embarrassing that Rashta attempted to imitate me, rather than the Grand Duke Kapmen passing by me as well.\u201cMiss Rashta.\u201dShe smiled and said in her usual sweet voice, \u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d It was not the same person who looked at me like I betrayed her in the dining room. I suppressed my feelings and spoke as calmly as possible.\u201cI planned to ask you this after the New Year\u2019s celebrations, but now I have to know.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhy did you lie to everyone and say that I sent you gifts?\u201dRashta\u2019s eyebrows lifted in confusion.\u201cLie?\u201dShe waited for me to continue. Her conscience was pricked, surely.\u201cRashta didn\u2019t lie, Your Majesty. It\u2019s true that the Empress sent many gifts to Rashta\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know where this misunderstanding comes from, but I did no such thing.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you angry because Rashta said she wrote the letters\u2026?\u201dI stared at her in silence, and Rashta clasped her hands together as tears started to form in her eyes.\u201cBut Viscountess Verdi said the Empress would never come forward. In fact, she would the Empress would be embarrassed by this. So I didn\u2019t mean anything. I was only trying to play.\u201d\u201cPlay?\u201d\u201cAnd I helped you, too, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou helped me?\u201dRashta looked about ready to cry again.\u201cYou didn\u2019t want anyone else to know you were the letter friend. Why are you always so scary to Rashta?\u201dBefore I could say anything more, the door opened, and both Sovieshu and Prince Heinley appeared, their faces stiff. They seemed to have been arguing with each other inside.\u201c\u2026Heueu.\u201dRashta\u2019s tears finally broke. Sovieshu looked at her in surprise, then approached her and wiped her wet cheeks with his sleeve.\u201cRashta? Why are you crying?\u201dSovieshu glared at me as she sobbed harder.\u201cWhat happened, Empress? What\u2019s wrong with Rashta?\u201d\u201cI asked her a question.\u201d\u201cWhat did you ask her?\u201d\u201cI asked why she lied when I never sent her gifts.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s expression tensed.\u201cYou asked her about that?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been telling people, so of course I did.\u201dWho else should I have asked? I stared at him wondrously. His lips were tightly pressed together, and he looked alternately between me and Rashta before he sighed.\u201cIf Rashta is mistaken, shouldn\u2019t we just let it go?\u201d\u201cI cannot allow my name to be used this way.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to confront Rashta. It\u2019s my fault. I sent her gifts in your name.\u201dMy head spun. Sovieshu gave her gifts in my name? Rashta opened her eyes wide and looked at Sovieshu, her tears clinging delicately to her lashes.\u201cIs that true, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cThere was a misunderstanding because of me.\u201dSovieshu nodded and murmured an apology, but Rashta shook her head.\u201cNo, Rashta is so happy. You did it for Rashta.\u201dI clenched my fist. I was the one who was gossiped about because of Sovieshu\u2019s and Rashta\u2019s mistake. And it was Rashta that Sovieshu apologized to, while Rashta thought it touching.Before, I had distanced myself from Rashta. I told myself that I should ignore her, that I should look away, and that I didn\u2019t care. But now\u2014I clearly hated her.And more than that, I hated Sovieshu.I impatiently spoke up.\u201cIf this is your fault\u2014\u201dSovieshu, who had been immersed in the romantic mood between the two, turned his head. He looked surprised to see me, as if he thought the issue resolved.I stared coldly into his eyes.\u201cYou have to take the blame, Your Majesty. You admitted responsibility.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cNo matter the circumstances, you shouldn\u2019t assume another\u2019s name. Isn\u2019t that right, Your Majesty? \u201dSovieshu looked at me in bewilderment.\u201cDo we really have to deal with that here?\u201d\u201cYes. Now that you\u2019ve admitted guilt, shouldn\u2019t you be held responsible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSovieshu\u2019s complexion paled. I noticed him discreetly glancing between Rashta and Prince Heinley. His pride was injured in front of a distinguished man and the woman he loved, but the pride he wanted to preserve was not the pride of an emperor, but the pride of a man. Should I help him protect that?No.\u201cWhat do you want? Do you want me to cry like Rashta?\u201d\u201cI want you to apologize.\u201d\u201cApologize?\u201d\u201cPlease apologize for using my name.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, all right?\u201d\u201cAnd since Miss Rashta has been spreading false information, I hope that she will take responsibility and correct it.\u201dSovieshu exhaled.\u201cIs that really necessary?\u201d\u201cAre you afraid you will lose face, Your Majesty? Because my face has already been crushed.\u201d\u201cIf your face was crushed simply from sending gifts to Rashta, then you are poor and shallow from the start.\u201d\u201cIt is also poor and shallow not to correct it. Please take care of it as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cThe Empress should do it herself. Don\u2019t you dislike other people speaking in your name?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so narrow-minded? You were never like that before, were you?\u201d\u201cI should say that to you. And don\u2019t speak impolitely to me, Sovieshu.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Heinley stood dazed as he looked at her profile. Her low, gentle voice captivated his ears but her icy voice even more so. How would it sound if she said his name like that?Heinley swallowed dryly as his imagination made his head spin. He wanted to kneel before that overbearing empress and pour kisses on her hand. He wanted to hear her speak in that cold voice and issue commands to him. How would it feel to obey her orders and then to rebel?It had started out as curiosity. He was curious about the empress from a foreign country, and so he traveled as far as the palace to see her. Despite rumors that she was made of steel or ice, she was surprisingly soft and charming towards birds.The rumors weren\u2019t exactly wrong, however, but he was surprised to see her ordinary side. He felt sympathy for the way she put up a strong front while she cried in secret. He heard her talking to herself as she tried to hold back her tears. What the people wanted was not an emperor\u2019s beloved empress.But to him, she was incredible. He thought that beneath her strong appearance was a vulnerable figure, but he discovered beneath that was a strong figure again.The feeling of curiosity and attraction turned into anxiety after actually meeting her. Why did she ignore him when he tried to make himself known? Why did she pretend not to know him? Why wasn\u2019t she trying to look for him? Were the comforts of the letters, the jokes that they had been shared, simply been a one-sided feeling? Or perhaps her pride would be hurt if someone were to take care of her.But as Heinley drew closer to her, he became angry. He didn\u2019t like seeing the things that burdened her or caused her pain. He knew from experience that controlling one\u2019s reputation was difficult, to the point that he had almost gotten in a fight about it in the past.\u201cAre you jealous of Rashta, by any chance?\u201dAs the Empress\u2019 jaw hardened at Sovieshu\u2019s insult, Prince Heinley was overcome with an even more violent impulse than in the dining room. The frozen empress was charming, but the things that made her that way were not. He could hear McKenna\u2019s voice in his mind, repeatedly urging him not to cause an incident. It irritated Heinley that he could not officially stand up to defend her honor.\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor. You must be more discerning.\u201dEventually, Heinley spoke. McKenna will be furious when he hears about this. Their king was bedridden, and the court affairs were in chaos. Did he really want to antagonize the Emperor of the Eastern Empire? Despite this, Heinley couldn\u2019t help but speak up.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you, Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a witness. How can I keep my nose out of this?\u201dHeinley added a grin as he stood next to the Empress.\u201cYour Majesty, do not worry. I will be the one to spread rumors about the truth. Your reputation will not be tarnished by this mistake.\u201dThings could have gotten worse if it were not for McKenna, who came running to Prince Heinley\u2019s side and stole him away.\u201cI heard you say something about reputation. Are you changing course?\u201dHeinley walked in silence to the southern palace as McKenna nagged at him.\u201cDo what you usually do, Prince. Don\u2019t fight from the front, fight from behind. Why are you trying to do something that you can\u2019t do well? And why does it have to be with the Eastern Emperor? At this rate, our spying will be moot.\u201dMcKenna\u2019s nagging got worse as soon as he closed the door, and Heinley ignored him and pulled up a chair.\u201cWhat are you going to do with the chair? Are you going to hit me?\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dAs McKenna sat down, Heinley touched his head and forced mana into him. With a cry, McKenna turned into a bluebird, and the clothes he wore tumbled to the ground. McKenna\u2019s eyes widened as Prince Heinley went to his desk and then held out something.-?\u201cDeliver this to Elgy.\u201d\u2013 \u2026\u201cI won\u2019t get myself in trouble, so go and deliver it.

What did you say, Your Highness?\u201dI turned my book upside down and placed it on my lap. Could I tell them this? Would it sound strange?My ladies-in-waiting knew I was the real letter friend, and so there was no need for me to say anything more. However, I thought it would be helpful if I could change any of the rumors about Prince Heinley with my own words\u2026\u201cPrince Heinley. He seems better than I thought.\u201dI spoke nonchalantly as I picked up my teacup from the table and took a sip. Laura, who was playing opposite of Countess Eliza, surreptitiously changed a horse\u2019s position while the Countess was not looking.\u201cRight. And he knew that the maid and the slave didn\u2019t write those letters! Ah\u2014that was wrong. Anyway, he found out quickly. Even though he\u2019s a womanizer, he\u2019s more faithful than other nobles.\u201dCountess Eliza had slapped Laura on the back of the hand and restored the horse\u2019s original position on the board.\u201cLaura is right. Though he may seem like a carefree person, he\u2019s not frivolous.\u201dA lady-in-waiting sitting comfortably on an armchair gave a vindictive laugh.\u201cEven more so, I liked it when the slave\u2019s lie came to light.\u201dSympathetic comments started to spring up from the other ladies.\u201cDid you see how his blood pressure went up when she lied so shamelessly to him?\u201d\u201cThe foreign nobles who mingle with her must have come to their senses by now.\u201dHowever, Artina, who was silently standing by the door, immediately threw cold water into situation.\u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201dAt Artina\u2019s certain tone, the ladies-in-waiting all turned to him with questioning expressions. The knight nervously scratched his cheek, as if overwhelmed by the ladies looking at him all at once.\u201cBaron Lant is responsible for Miss Rashta\u2019s affairs, and he talks about her differently.\u201d\u201cDifferently? How?\u201dLaura eyes were wide as she questioned him. I also looked at Artina, setting the now empty cup back on the table.I knew Baron Lant\u2014he was Sovieshu\u2019s secretary, and quite a brilliant man. Moreover, he was extremely fond of Rashta, and it was only good for her if Baron Lant was coming forward and turning the rumors around.\u201cBecause of Miss Rashta\u2019s beauty and charm, some say that the Emperor and Prince Heinley are fighting over her.\u201dWhen two conflicting rumors spread, there would be at least one that believed one story or the other. Baron Lant had planned this out carefully.Laura shut the chessboard in frustration.\u201cI absolutely despise her!\u201d\u201cWatch your mouth, Laura. You are a lady-in-waiting of the Empress, and offensive language will only hurt Her Majesty\u2019s image.\u201d\u201cI am careful in front of others, Countess Eliza. Yet still\u2026I have no other way to express my emotions!\u201dThen, as Laura cried out her frustration, there was a tap on the window.\u201cQueen!\u201dIt had been several days since he came here last, and I quickly got up and opened the window to let him in. I was so happy to see him after such a long time that I held him tightly.\u2013 !Queen embraced me with his wings, and Laura finally calmed down and gave a giggle.\u201cThat bird is so sweet. Look how he holds Her Majesty. Maybe he\u2019s not a bird.\u201d\u2013 !I scolded the ladies for teasing Queen, then I gently placed him on my lap and stroked his head.Queen large purple eyes closed as he dozed off, but occasionally he startled and looked at me.\u201cI missed you.\u201dI confessed my feelings frankly to him, and he peered at me as if he understood me.\u201c\u2026\u201dStrange. Why did this bird remind me Prince Heinley? Well, perhaps it was because Prince Heinley was the bird\u2019s owner.\u201cAh.\u201dI almost forget to check the note on his leg. I took it the piece of paper, set Queen aside and opened it.\u2013 I had wagered my identity. Why don\u2019t you want to participate in the bet?Did Prince Heinley know that I was the letter acquaintance or not? A few hours ago, I told myself that the writer was Prince Heinley, but I didn\u2019t even have the time to ask him because Sovieshu and I immediately fought\u2026I hesitated before writing my response.\u2013 Please keep our friendship by letter only.Queen watched me patiently as I wrote. As soon as I lifted my hand from the paper, he checked the contents, then made a strange noises and started jumping up and down.\u2013 Gu! Gu! Gu!He seemed to be criticizing me on behalf of his owner.\u201cDon\u2019t be so upset, Queen. I prefer it this way.\u201d\u2013 Gu!\u201cIf your master and I meet each other, we will be Eastern Empress and the Western Prince, not friends that can speak casually to each other. We would have to be careful how we behave in front of other people.\u201d\u2013 \u2026\u201cI have become a source of entertainment because of Sovieshu and Rashta. Under these circumstances, the rumors will worsen if it\u2019s discovered that I\u2019m exchanging letters with a womanizer.\u201dMaybe it was because Queen seemed so intelligent, but before I knew it, I was confessing my true feelings.Queen\u2019s beak opened as if in surprise.

I don\u2019t know why you think it would suddenly change.\u201d\u201cRashta is your concubine. Your lady. Rashta thought she could go without being invited\u2026You should have invited her too.\u201dRashta\u2019s face was red as she whimpered.\u201cOh goodness, Rashta.\u201dSovieshu took out a handkerchief and patted away the tears that had sprung up in her eyes. But the tears gathered again, and the handkerchief was useless.\u201cDo you really wish to go?\u201d\u201cI told everyone at the dinner that I would go to the special banquet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSovieshu frowned.\u201cYou should\u2019ve asked me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strange to ask. Besides, His Majesty took Rashta to dinner with the special guests, so of course Rashta thought\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201dSovieshu sighed and rubbed Rashta\u2019s shoulder, but she kept crying, waiting for Sovieshu to change his words. However, no matter how long she waited, it did not happen.\u201cSo in the end, you\u2019re not taking me.\u201dRashta wept like a child, and Sovieshu clenched his jaw at the innocence of it. Having only seen the court nobles cry silently, he was amazed whenever Rashta expressed her true feelings honestly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rashta. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d\u201cYou saw what happened today. If Rashta doesn\u2019t go, Prince Heinley will say something to the guests. He said he was going to spread rumors.\u201dRashta had a point, and Sovieshu sighed again. However, many of the guests consisted of foreign royal family members and powerful nobles, and were considered the most important people of the year. To set aside an important guest to allow a concubine could cause an international problem.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be there. I won\u2019t let Prince Heinley say anything strange.\u201dRashta\u2019s expression was still morose. After stewing on the subject, Sovieshu finally let out a sigh.\u201cI will ask the Empress if she spare a seat. Some of the guests are subjects of this country, so we won\u2019t have to worry about an international problem.\u201d***The morning sun shone through the thin curtains, casting shadows on the floor in the shape of the window frames.I yawned and raised myself from the bed. My heart wasn\u2019t heavy despite the incident from yesterday. Perhaps it was because of Prince Heinley and Queen\u2026I patted my face to wake myself up, then went to the bathroom to wash my face. Behind me, my ladies-in-waiting prepared the bathtub with petals and salts. My clothes were removed and I sank into the warm water, allowing my muscles to relax. I closed my eyes and leaned against the bathtub as the ladies-in-waiting massaged my head with careful hands.After the bath, I put on a robe and went into the bedroom. As it was the last day of the New Year\u2019s celebration and the day of the special banquet, the dress selected for me was extravagant, but not overly so, and simultaneously captured a sense of calm and splendor.After getting dressed, I placed on my diamond earrings and crown. The crown wasn\u2019t made for ceremonial purposes, and wasn\u2019t too large and heavy. I looked over my notes on the special guests while the ladies styled my hair to match the crown.However, before they could finish, one of Sovieshu\u2019s secretaries arrived. As I was already dressed, I allowed him in, and the secretary conveyed Sovieshu\u2019s words with great embarrassment.\u201cYour Majesty, the Emperor would like a word with you.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s about the special banquet, so please come quickly\u2014\u201dIt had to be urgent if it was about the special banquet. I nodded and ordered the ladies to quickly finish my hair.\u201cWe\u2019ll put it together when you get back.\u201d\u201cIs that alright? I don\u2019t want to bother you twice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThen you can have breakfast first while I\u2019m gone.\u201dVarious scenarios about the guests ran through my head when I followed Sovieshu\u2019s secretary to the eastern palace. Did someone suddenly declare war? Have one of the foreign guests complained about the country? Or did one of them offend us? Has anyone suddenly announced their absence?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dI immediately questioned Sovieshu as soon as I entered his room. Rashta was sitting on the bed, but I pretended not to know her. However, I did notice her staring at me\u2014no, staring at the crown on my head, more exactly.I frowned in discomfort, but Rashta continued staring with a bewitched expression and did not look away. Sovieshu was the first to speak.\u201cCan you make room for one more person?\u201d\u201cIs something wrong? Are there any reports that Secretary Bimeli or the Chief Magician Calenzano are able to attend?\u201dThe secretary and the chief magician were those who originally had reservations. They were invited by Sovieshu, but they did not attend the New Year\u2019s ceremony because they had already refused for other reasons.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not them.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201dWho on earth were we supposed to set up a seat for? I studied Sovieshu closely, who seemed caught in an awkward silence.\u201cI want to take Rashta with me\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you do that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEmpress? Why won\u2019t you talk to me?\u201dI was going to apologize, but quickly shoved it down because I didn\u2019t think it was something I should apologize for.\u201cNo, Your Majesty.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s brow furrowed at my flat refusal.\u201cOne seat is fine. There is surely one or two people the Empress can ask.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible to ask for consent if they agree. But if Secretary Bimeli or the Chief Magician Calenzano came, they would be offended by the sudden cancellation of the invitation\u2026for your concubine.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s expression turned even colder.\u201cI understand the connotation of your words, Empress.\u201d\u201cThe answer would have been the same if it had been my lover, or even if it had been another concubine that was not Rashta.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t we exclude people such as Duchess Tuania?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the people I cherish, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201c!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Secret Friend (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI could tell that Sovieshu believed me to be a heartless person. It was clear by the lines between his brows, which were usually not there, and the narrowing of his eyes.\u201cThe empress is cold.\u201d\u201cAs I should be.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAn international embarrassment could happen if Sovieshu disregarded his guests, and the blame would fall to him. But if I set aside a guest for Rashta, I would be blamed for doing something wrong to impress Rashta and Sovieshu. A similar rumor had already spread after Sovieshu gave Rashta gifts under my name. While that incident was disgraceful on a personal level, disrespecting guests would directly be judged by society.But Sovieshu\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t a mistake. Even at this moment, he was smart. He was forcing me to act this way to protect himself and soothe Rashta\u2019s heart.\u201cI\u2019m not intentionally being cruel. Rashta is your concubine, not mine. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to force me to do things even you, the Emperor, cannot do.\u201dI was too peeved to explain it further to him, so I deliberately turned away. Sovieshu\u2019s jaw was clenched and Rashta glanced at me with a frightened look, but I wasn\u2019t feeling any better at all. I gave my farewell as etiquette dictated, and then left the room with a stately walk.***When I arrived at the western palace, I found the ladies anxiously waiting for me.\u201cYou should have eaten without me.\u201d\u201cHow could we? We wondered if something terrible happened again.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look good whenever you see the Emperor these days.\u201dAfter calming them down, we ate breakfast together, but I found it difficult to swallow. I managed to fill my stomach lightly with soup and pudding.Afterwards, the ladies-in-waiting prepared themselves for the party, so I sat alone at my desk to check the schedule after the New Year\u2019s celebrations. I had to see off the foreign guests, as well as accommodate those that wished to stay longer. Reports of any incidents also had to be handled thoroughly. If any foreigner had a legal problem, it had to be settled before they crossed the border.The day passed quickly, and then it was time for the feast. I made another examination of myself in the mirror, and I saw that each of my ladies-in-waiting were splendidly dressed as well.\u201cWill you come to the party after the special banquet?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to check the time\u2026what\u2019s wrong, Laura?\u201d\u201cAlischute\u2014no, Lady Alischute is ill and cannot go to the party. If neither you nor her come, I\u2019ll just show my face and leave quickly.Laura, who preferred to mingle with her peers, did not seem very interested in socializing with the other noblewomen.\u201cI\u2019ll be there if you wait for me, Laura.\u201dI gave her my promise, and Laura smiled with excitement and quickly went to the grand hall for the party. The other ladies-in-waiting also followed suit, while I went to the Red Rose room for the special banquet.Lively music filled the air, and the special guests were gathered together in groups of three or four. I walk towards Princess Soju, with a casual nod to everyone else, when I came across Grand Duke Kapmen first, who was holding a champagne glass. A large statue holding a flower basket and sword and a servant carrying champagne bottles stood symmetrically on either side of him, leaving no other way to pass.\u201cAre you enjoying yourself?\u201dA nod wouldn\u2019t suffice as he was right in front of me, so I smiled and spoke to him. Before I bowed in greeting, it occurred to me that he ignored both me and Rashta yesterday.\u201c\u2026Your Majesty.\u201dFortunately, Grand Duke Kapmen did not turn a blind eye to me this time. He didn\u2019t answer my question, however.\u201cDoes the food suit your taste?\u201dI gave him a small bow for the second time without realizing it. Instead of answering me, he stared at me again. His long, sharp eyes were something fierce.This was Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s first invitation to the banquet, and I had never interacted with this man until last year. I had little knowledge of his character. All I knew was that he was a grand duke from a desert country, and had graduated first from a magical academy.As I waited for his reply, Kapmen asked me his own question out of nowhere.\u201cIs this the state of the Eastern Empire?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIn Rwibt, the Imona\u2019s and Imot\u2019s emotions are one. \u201d\u201cThe king and queen are one. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201d \u2026You know what it means?\u201d\u201cNot enough to say I\u2019m fluent. Only a few basic words.\u201dWhen I lifted my eyebrows, he opened his eyes in surprise and continued.\u201cIf Emot\u2019s lover is in front of her, she would be killed immediately.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cAre you not able to do that, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that in this great empire I cannot kill a person for no reason, even if I am an empress. A trial must be held first.\u201d\u201cFoolish that you cannot eat soup out of your own bowl.\u201dWas he saying that I didn\u2019t have proper control of the Rashta yesterday? However, just as there were the laws in the country of Rwibt, there were the laws of the Eastern Empire. In my country, concubines were legally approved. And if an empress ever killed an emperor\u2019s mistress? There was the strong possibility of being thrown into prison.Then what did that leave me? A little excitement? Should I bet my life to kill Rashta? Before giving an answer, however, Grand Duke Kapmen left with his glass of champagne.I gave a relieved sigh. He probably thought of me as pathetic.\u2018How strange. It was Sovieshu that made Rashta a concubine, so why am I the pathetic woman?\u2019Unfortunately, Princess Soju seemed to have moved elsewhere in the room. I shook my head and looked around to find another person, when my gaze landed on Duchess Tuania.\u201cQueen.\u201dThere was a low voice from behind me. As soon as I turned my head, I found Prince Heinley right before me.\u201cHow are you\u2014\u201dBefore I could ask him how he was, he spoke again.\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you for a moment.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Secret Friend (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPrince Heinley\u2019s expression was both serious and sad. He didn\u2019t have his usual smile or proud bearing. I nodded for him to speak, remembering that he had helped me.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dPrince Heinley picked up two champagne glasses from a passing servant, and with his eyes pointed towards a spot where the music was loudest and would cover our conversation. The open area left no room for the other guests to misunderstand, even if I was with the much-gossiped-about Prince Heinley. He was a surprisingly thoughtful man\u2026As I admired him, Prince Heinley extended to me a glass of champagne, which I accepted. He didn\u2019t drink his, however, and simply fiddled with his glass, while I still stood and waited for him to speak. Finally, he carefully opened his mouth.\u201cI read your message, Your Majesty. You want to keep our friendship only by letter.\u201d\u201cYou know that it\u2019s me?\u201dAll I had said yesterday was that I knew it was not Rashta. How did he know it was me? When I looked up at him, Prince Heinley hurriedly waved his hand and gave an awkward smile.\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed. You did not make a mistake.\u201d\u201cThen \u2026?\u201d\u201cBoth Lady Rashta and her maid knew the contents of the early letters, but not the later ones. So I thought about it. It turned out that a lady-in-waiting named Viscountess Verdi had transferred from the Empress to Lady Rashta.\u201dSo that\u2019s how he figured it out\u2026But I was still surprised. Rumors had it that Prince Heinley was a womanizer, a cruel man, a person who kept bad company. I had never heard a rumor that he was exceedingly intelligent, and I smiled a little.But the prince still looked forlorn, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder. He wasn\u2019t disappointed that I was the letter acquaintance, even though I\u2019d rather not have it revealed in the beginning. It would be less embarrassing for the both of us to ignore it. Why was his face so stiff?\u201cAre you alright? You don\u2019t look very happy.\u201dPrince Heinley sighed as he stared at me.\u201cHow can I be happy? I imagined us as good friends, but you want to pretend not to know me in real life?\u201dWas that really as coldhearted as it sounds? I thought he was exaggerating, but he looked so forlorn I didn\u2019t protest. He downed his champagne glass in one smooth motion.\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t have many friends to share my thoughts with.\u201dPrince Heinley set his empty glass down on the statue pedestal and continued, his voice thick.\u201cI know. It\u2019s unexpected, isn\u2019t it? Am I popular? Yes. I have many friends. I always have people around me, so you many think I am not lonely.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cBut that is only what you see. In fact, I\u2019m very lonely. It\u2019s not that I hate my friends\u2014I have many good ones. However, as the prince of the West, I cannot honestly share my thoughts, and always have to be conscious of others.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI looked at him in surprise. Those were almost my exact same thoughts. It was as if\u2014as if Queen listened to me and delivered those words straight to Prince Heinley.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem about the people, but my own, so there\u2019s no way to improve it\u2026\u201dI stared steadily at Prince Heinley, as I realized I wasn\u2019t the only one with those thoughts. I had believed Prince Heinley behaved without regard to what other people thought of him, but it was an act too\u2026\u201cI loved being able to talk to someone without them thinking of me as \u2018Prince Heinley\u2019 or \u2018Crown Prince.\u2019 Our conversations weren\u2019t long, but I was happy to have someone exchange lighthearted letters to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI was the same. I was marked as a princess early on, and this was the first time since with my family that I felt I could open up my heart. Not because there weren\u2019t good people, but because \u201ca good person\u201d and \u201ca person I can reveal my innermost thoughts to\u201d were not the same.\u201cI\u2019ve looked forward to those letters. Honestly, I was even happier when I knew that my letter acquaintance was you, Your Majesty. But instead you seemed reluctant and inconvenienced.\u201dPrince Heinley sighed, his eyes becoming moist. As I faced those eyes, I felt a wave of guilt wash over me. I sympathized with everything he said, and felt further shame.\u201cWe had the same thoughts, but different conclusions.\u201dPrince Heinley looked at me with those wet eyes and sighed again, his mysterious violet irises glistening like jewels under the chandelier\u2019s light. There almost seemed to be resentment in his expression. I could be his friend, or I could end it like this.\u201cI understand what you feel, Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cBut you still only want to exchange letters?\u201d\u201cI enjoyed them.\u201d\u201cOutside of letters, it will be even more enjoyable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can tell me that Sovieshu\u2019s a son of a bitch.\u201d\u201cKeup!\u201dI choked when Prince Heinley tossed all dignity out of the window. Everyone stared at me as I coughed, and Prince Heinley lowered his voice once again and whispered, \u201cSovieshu\u2019s a son of a bitch.\u201dWhat kind of person\u2026Prince Heinley raised his eyebrows and gave a silly grin.\u201cThere is nothing more funny than watching someone suppress a laugh. Just laugh if you want to. \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t laugh, your heart will ache.\u201dAche? Did he have experience in this?His smile faded, as did his voice. For a moment, Prince Heinley stared at the floor, his forehead furrowed in thought.\u201cThen, can you do something for me? I\u2019ll keep it a secret you, my Queen, are my letter partner. And I\u2019ll also keep secret that we are friends.\u201d\u201cAre we friends?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that we\u2019re friends, Queen?\u201dHe gave a strange smile, then he pressed his lips together and continued.\u201cInstead, it can be like now. If we meet by chance, please don\u2019t ignore me. And if the two of us happen to be alone, don\u2019t avoid me.\u201dHis voice was playful and the smile around his mouth looked light, but his gaze was serious. It sounded like a joke, but I knew it wasn\u2019t.He gazed at me with those earnest eyes, and I felt a strange sensation of my heart being squeezed lightly with fingernails.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Viscount Roteschu (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 \u2013 Viscount Roteschu (1)\u2018They must be talking about me\u2026\u2019Rashta stared anxiously at the doorway, where inside was the special banquet. It should go smoothly with Sovieshu there, but she was still apprehensive.Would Prince Heinley say anything strange to anyone? The Empress seemed unlikely to spread rumors, but Rashta couldn\u2019t say the same about Prince Heinley. Rashta bit her lip and sighed again.\u201cYou look blue today. Are you feeling well?\u201dBaron Lant appeared by her side and smiled at her teasingly.\u201cIn truth, I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very honest.\u201dRashta smiled and nodded. After Sovieshu, Baron Lant was her favorite person in the palace. He was not prejudiced towards her, and when rumors of her and Prince Heinley had spread, she had heard that Baron Lant stepped up to defend her honor. Rashta couldn\u2019t help but like the older man.\u201cRest assured, no matter how unruly Prince Heinley is, he has no choice but to yield to our Emperor. Although the Western Kingdom has been growing in power, it still cannot eclipse the Eastern Empire.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cI will do whatever I can to protect Lady Rashta\u2019s honor, so go enjoy the last day of the celebrations.\u201dRashta nodded, and her mood lifted as she smiled. Those who did not scorn her gathered around her in ones or twos, and before long she was surrounded by people who were close to her or who wanted to be close to her. She preened at their attention, and whether because they were being thoughtful or not, no one asked her why she did not go to the special banquet. Rashta sipped wine that was surely five times older than herself, and happily accepted the praise that the nobles lavished on her.\u201cThe contrast between your silver hair and your dark eyes is so enviable.\u201d\u201cIt gives off the feeling of purity, like a lily-of-the-valley.\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania might need to defend her current reputation.\u201dDuchess Tuania wasn\u2019t present, as she was likely attending the special banquet, and today more and more people approached Rashta instead.\u2018Today, I am the butterfly of the social circles.\u2019Rashta was feeling pleasantly tipsy. Even before she became the emperor\u2019s concubine, she knew beauty could be a poison. It was only after much trial did she learn how to use her own beauty as a weapon, but even then she found herself walking a precarious tightrope, always in danger.But it was different here. Everyone praised her and loved her. Her protector was the most powerful man on earth, and no one could lay a hand on her.\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say you were going to the special banquet? Why are you here now?\u201dHowever, it was only less than half an hour later that someone brought up an uncomfortable question.Rashta stared at the woman who spoke. She was not a memorable aristocrat, and did not have large possessions or had duties important in the Imperial Palace. This was the first time this particular noblewoman mingled with them. The other nobles turned silent at the question, but despite their curiosity, they did not speak up.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201dRashta quickly arranged her thoughts and made up a story.\u201cIt\u2019s because Rashta said it was alright.\u201d\u201cOh, Miss Rashta?\u201d\u201cImportant foreign guests usually go to the banquet. Rather than having Rashta attend, she thought it would be better to have someone who would benefit our country. \u201dThe nobles were delighted over her answer.\u201cMiss Rashta is so smart for a concubine.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Many of the previous concubines only spent money and idled away, and held no interest in international affairs at all. Miss Rashta is certainly different from them.\u201dRashta smiled shyly and lowered her eyes. Their admiration was as intoxicating as a drug.\u201cRashta should help His Majesty.\u201dRashta murmured that she wanted another drink, and a number of nobleman quickly offered her a variety of wine glasses. Rashta chose a flute with a light purple liquor, and the face of the young man she had accepted the drink from lit up.Suddenly, Rashta caught glimpse of someone over the young man\u2019s shoulders. Someone who should not have been there.The flute slipped from her hand, and the glass shattered on the floor.\u201cMiss Rashta, are you all right?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dRashta was unable to answer, and quickly jerked her head. But the one who surprised her was not there anymore.\u2018Did I see it wrong?\u2019Rashta forced her heart to calm. Perhaps it was the effects of the alcohol.\u2018I drank too much.\u2019While the servants placed the broken glass on a tray and wiped the liquor off the floor, Rashta repeatedly glanced back to where she had seen the man.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Miss Rashta?\u201dBaron Lant noticed her strange behavior and turned towards where she was looking, and she quickly caught the hem of his robe to stop him.\u201cBaron Lant. I have a question.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cFor the New Year\u2019s celebrations, if a nobleman doesn\u2019t come on the first day\u2026can they come on the last day?\u201d\u201cOf course. Some may not be able to come to the festivities immediately.\u201dRashta lowered her voice.\u201cDo rural aristocrats come to the New Year\u2019s celebrations? Rural aristocrats with small estates? Do you not help choose the guests?\u201d\u201cYes, I help choose them. And even nobility of a small estate can be invited.\u201d\u201cEven if they haven\u2019t attended for years?\u201d\u201cEven if they haven\u2019t attended for a long time, we still send invitations for that reason. We don\u2019t leave them completely alone.\u201dRashta\u2019s lips started to quiver, and Baron Lant\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cMiss Rashta, what happened?\u201dRashta shook her head, then took in her surroundings agains and pushed her glass towards him.\u201cR-Rashta\u2019s going inside. I think I\u2019m drunk.\u201dShe answered unsteadily and waved her hand to get out of the crowd. There was nothing to worry about if she made a drunken mistake, but if not\u2014it would be dangerous.That man\u2026Viscount Roteschu. The lord of the estate where she was a slave. He knew Rashta\u2019s face.As she was leaving, a loud voice behind Rashta proclaimed, \u201cWhat? Am I seeing right?\u201dGoose flesh erupted on Rashta\u2019s back. Her face paled, and her eyes darkened in fear.Rashta was reeling, and Baron Lant hastened towards her.\u201cMiss Rashta?\u201dBaron Lant called out to her anxiously, but she didn\u2019t answer.\u201c\u2018Miss\u2019 Rashta?\u201dThe loud voice grew closer, dripping in mockery.\u201cWhat is this now? Have you changed your identity?\u201dThe surroundings became deathly silent.\u201cThe world is getting better. A runaway slave gets treated like a lady now? Hm?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they haven\u2019t revealed themselves by now, then they never will.\u201d\u201cBut you wanted it badly enough to go public\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to make them feel uncomfortable because of me.\u201dPrince Heinley kept his promise. I awkwardly cut a piece of cake across the table where he was talking to a noblewoman. From time to time he looked at me, and I just smiled and nodded, hoping it wouldn\u2019t seem odd.\u2018He\u2019s a good man\u2026\u2019Sovieshu would have cut off Prince Heinley if he said anything strange, but the prince said nary a word about Rashta at all.The conversation went from Prince Heinley\u2019s letters to Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s continent, his magic, and how it worked in war. The grand duke offered only a few words, and did not speak about magic though he had graduated from a magical academy. He was equally silent on other topics, but my attention turned towards the door when it opened and someone came in. It was the captain of the guard.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Our eyes met, and he bowed towards me. Sovieshu still hadn\u2019t noticed him, as his eyes were on Prince Heinley.\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor.\u201dSovieshu turned his head, and the knight delivered his message.\u201cYou need to come to the grand hall.\u201dHe sounded serious. There were only twenty people in the room, so everyone could hear what he said. All the guests\u2019 eyes were on him.\u201cWhy is that?\u201dThe captain seemed reluctant to answer in present company, but Sovieshu picked up on it and went outside with the knight.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019I considered following them, but decided against it. If I was needed, then the knight would have spoken to me as well, and I wouldn\u2019t be required if it had to do with Rashta or anything like that.\u2018I don\u2019t need to leave.\u2019I made up my mind and turned towards the guests again. When the time came, I left the Red Rose room and went to the grand banquet hall. I had to check on the other guests as well, and when the sun went down I had to inspect the fireworks.\u2018I also made a promise to meet with Laura.\u2019However, the atmosphere at the grand banquet hall was livelier than I expected.\u2018Did something happen?\u2019People usually tired out at days-long celebrations. Everyone would dress up for the last day, but the energy was usually not the same as the first. From the entrance I spied people talking and laughing, and the noise grew louder as I went in. I looked around confusedly, and Laura ran over to me.\u201cYour Majesty, Her Majesty, did you hear?\u201d\u201cDid something interesting happen? I\u2019ve been in the Red Rose room, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cSomething very interesting happened.\u201dLaura\u2019s nostrils were flared in excitement, and she moved me to a suitable place for conversation. Nearby, there was a spread of crispy fried seafood, small dishes of pumpkin puddings, and milky coffee.\u201cYou can listen while you eat. It\u2019s an appetizing story!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dLaura pushed a pumpkin pudding and a fork towards me.\u201cThank you, Laura.\u201d\u201cYou remember Rashta?\u201dIt was not a topic I was fond of. I grimaced slightly, but Laura continued, despite knowing that I didn\u2019t like talking about her.\u201cDo you remember the rumor that she was a runaway slave?\u201d\u201cYes, but are we not allowed to speak of it?\u201dSovieshu had said he would punish those that did. Could they speak about this in a crowded place? I was worried, but Laura shouted out before I could stop her.\u201cShe really is an escaped slave! Viscount Roteschu arrived at the party for the first time, and he recognized Rashta!\u201d\u201cViscount Roteschu?\u201d\u201cShe was his slave, then she ran away!\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. If the Emperor was here he would\u2019ve stopped him. Not only that, the viscount had only been in the capital for a few hours. He didn\u2019t know about the rumors about Rashta or the order not to talk about her. That\u2019s why he openly said Rashta was a slave in public!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cRashta said she was not, but everyone believed Roteschu. She looked mortified.\u201dLaura snorted.\u201cAll the nobles who came up to Rashta must have seen it now.\u201d\u201cAnd where are they now?\u201d\u201cWhen Rashta fainted, Baron Lant carried her to her bedroom. Then the captain of the royal guard came and took Viscount Roteschu.\u201dSo that was why the captain was looking for Sovieshu. For a moment, some unexplained feeling welled up inside me. Was it\u2026vindication? Yes. I thought so. Sovieshu had been furious when he suspected I spread false rumors about Rashta as a runaway slave. The resentment and sorrow I felt now turned to satisfaction.However, there was a small corner in my heart that didn\u2019t feel thrilled. Where did this uncomfortable feeling come from?\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t figure it out, and I decided to leave it be for now.In any case, did Sovieshu not realize Rashta was a runaway slave when he rescued her? However, even if he did know, I didn\u2019t think Sovieshu would hate her. He had brought her here because of her pitiful circumstances and his powerful desire to protect her. Whether he fell in love with her then or not, that was their first meeting. And whether Rashta was a commoner or a fugitive slave, Sovieshu would still love her. He would try to protect Rashta from ridicule.I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but I did know that I didn\u2019t want to get involved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each time, it was either her or Sovieshu that netted me in, but this time it was Sovieshu.Some of the foreign guests would return to their countries, while a few would stay longer at the southern palace. I returned to the western palace, leaving behind those who wanted to stay up for the drinking and revelry. I wanted to take a warm bath to relieve my fatigue of the day. The ladies-in-waiting also seemed exhausted, so instead of having them follow me, I sent them away to take their rest.However, before I could even finish drawing the bathwater, Sovieshu\u2019s captain of the guard came to see me. I had a sinking feeling the moment I saw him. For nearly a month, all the times Sovieshu summoned me out of the blue had been unpleasant encounters.What on earth did he want this time? My mood felt heavy as I walked through the long corridors, but I managed to control my expression. I hoped I could maintain it in front of my husband\u2026Finally, I entered Sovieshu\u2019s bedroom in the eastern palace. Sovieshu was seated on a chair by the bed, and I also noted Rashta on the bed with a towel on her forehead. I turned back to Sovieshu again, who had his eyes fixed on me.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dThe captain closed the door, and the atmosphere became even more oppressive. Sovieshu slowly opened his mouth to speak.\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201dHis voice was curt.\u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201dI spoke to him just as bluntly.\u201cIs that the only thing you want to say?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m most curious about now.\u201d\u201cYou do not even blink at this situation.\u201dThe first thought that came to mind was, \u2018I must be doing a good job of controlling my facial expression,\u2019 and the corners of my mouth tipped upwards. Sovieshu seemed even more offended by my smile.\u201cAre you happy that everyone thinks Rashta\u2019s a runaway slave?\u201d\u201cAre you going to take your anger out on me?\u201d\u201cEmpress.\u201d\u201cI heard about Miss Rashta at the grand hall. I know you\u2019re upset, but don\u2019t take it out on me.\u201d\u201cDid you think I called you to vent?\u201d\u201cYou did not?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why did you call me?\u201dHe did not call me to be angry at me, but weren\u2019t his remarks derisive only a while ago? He probably thought I was happy that Rashta was discovered to be a runaway slave.Sovieshu silently watched Rashta\u2019s sleeping form. The ticking of the clock echoed in the room. Only after some time passed did Sovieshu speak.\u201cDid you really want to prove that Rashta is a fugitive slave?\u201d\u201cThat story again?\u201d\u201cThe Empress was born a great aristocrat. She had a good family, enormous wealth, great power, a beautiful mansion, and a natural wit and beauty. But in spite of that, she still wants to be on top of everyone.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a compliment in this situation. I looked at Sovieshu with narrowed eyes, and he sighed.\u201cRashta had nothing. She became a slave and had no memory or her parents or family. No property, no power, no home. She is like the Empress who is smart and beautiful, but she doesn\u2019t have opportunities opened to her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd then she met me, and she had been trying to get these for her own. The chance to be loved, to eat a warm meal, to relax on a comfortable bed, to learn something.\u201dShe also took my husband, but I didn\u2019t say this because my pride was injured. I wanted to ask if he wanted me to sympathize with Rasta, but I couldn\u2019t say it either. I just stared at him without a word. I couldn\u2019t understand why he was talking so much\u2014was he asking me to take care of Rashta because she was in trouble?\u201cI don\u2019t need you to understand Rashta. But you have the smallest compassion\u2026can you give it?\u201d\u201cCompassion?\u201d\u201cThe compassion the Empress shows here and there\u2014for example, towards the orphanages, elderly homes, medical centers, temples, scholarship centers. Why can you not spare that compassion to Rashta!\u201dSovieshu exploded at me, but then he stopped himself and collapsed back into his chair. Rashta reached out with a groan, and he quickly took her hand. I noticed that she was wearing a shirt with wide sleeves. I wanted to clench my fist.\u201cRashta is your concubine, so you should take care of her. I\u2019m not looking after her because she\u2019s not under my jurisdiction.\u201d\u201cWho said you had to look after her? Ha. I don\u2019t want you to take care of her, so please leave her alone!\u201d\u201cHave I ever provoked her?\u201d\u201cYesterday in front of Prince Heinley, when he insulted Rashta. Of the two of them, Prince Heinley and Rashta, you should have sided with Rashta. If you don\u2019t know who\u2019s telling the truth, then you should stand by your subjects!\u201d\u201cAs I said, I knew the truth, and sided with Prince Heinley accordingly.\u201d\u201cRashta lied?\u201d\u201cIt is you who believe in her innocence, not me.\u201d\u201cWell, that was yesterday. How about today? Why were you trying to undermine her today?\u201d\u201cYou know I never spoke to Miss Rashta today.\u201d\u201cDid you. You never talked to Rashta herself, but you called Viscount Roteschu from behind her back.\u201dThe air seemed to crack when he made the accusation. I knew it couldn\u2019t really be, but it sounded like it. I glared at Sovieshu.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou wanted to prove that Rashta is a runaway slave, and so you brought Viscount Roteschu.\u201d\u201c\u2026I invited the viscount because of Miss Rashta?\u201dWhat kind of ridiculous invention was this? I was dumbfounded. Sovieshu let out an exhale.\u201cEver since I said that Rashta wasn\u2019t an escaped slave, didn\u2019t you want to prove me otherwise? Were you so offended by everyone loving her?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re speaking nonsense.\u201dI forced my voice to sound calm, but I felt ready to burst. Sovieshu stood straight up from his chair, his eyes flashing threateningly.\u201cWho knows the guest invitations better than the Empress? You must have been working hard. You invited Viscount Roteschu.\u201d\u201cYes, I know the invitations very well. It was my job. However, I invited him weeks before Rashta even came to the palace.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not an important guest, so why did you invite him to the celebrations?\u201d\u201cAs I said before\u2026I\u2019m not interested in every single thing concerning Miss Rashta. And you were confident that she was not a runaway slave. Under these circumstances, why would I not send an invitation to Viscount Roteschu?\u201dI didn\u2019t even know she was his slave. The only connection I knew was that Sovieshu had found her on the hunting grounds near Roteschu\u2019s estate. Since then, I had never heard mention of it, and if Rashta was commoner, then Roteschu\u2019s attendance was irrelevant. Yet somehow, Sovieshu thought I calculated Rashta was Roteschu\u2019s slave? Me? I was dumbfounded.\u201cIf you have any consideration\u2014\u201d\u201cYou should take care of her yourself. You can\u2019t expect me to look after her, even if I didn\u2019t know she was Roteschu\u2019s slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re heartless. A woman who has been living in poverty her whole life now wants to stand straight, and you don\u2019t want to see it? You don\u2019t want to be tarnished?

He was the lord of a small country estate, though that didn\u2019t necessarily mean he was unimportant. Many heroes, military officials, and ranking nobles chose to live peaceful lives on a small estate, leaving the capital behind them as far away as possible. In some cases, it wasn\u2019t the size or geographical features of the land that was important, but its location. For instance, the region of Wirwol was located in a deep mountain valley far from the capital, but its value couldn\u2019t be ignored as it hosted the mage\u2019s headquarters and magical academy.But that wasn\u2019t applicable to Roteschu. His estate in Rimwell was not open to development, as it was the location of the Emperor\u2019s forests and hunting grounds. Naturally, he had never seen the Emperor at a distance, let alone in a private meeting.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn line of the emperor\u2019s withering glare, Viscount Roteschu lowered his eyes. It was a very uncomfortable experience.Although Roteschu\u2019s friends occasionally ridiculed him for the modesty of his estate, he did not hate his position. Larger estates were under the influence of the Emperor, while Roteschu could respectably reign like a king over his own smaller one. He had never prostrated himself before anyone\u2014until now. He was intimidated by the Emperor, a man as young as his son, and his pride was dented for it.\u201cViscount Roteschu. Explain what happened today.\u201dAt last the Emperor spoke. For a moment, Viscount Roteschu couldn\u2019t make sense of what he meant. Earlier, the Emperor\u2019s secretary had carried Rashta to the bedroom, while Viscount Roteschu himself was arrested by the captain of the guard and dragged to this vacant room in the eastern palace. The reason why was known to everyone\u2014so why explain it again?But eventually he understood. It was a command by the Emperor to bring this all back to normal.\u201cI beg your forgiveness, Your Majesty. I frequently misidentify people\u2019s faces. The slave who fled from my estate was also beautiful like Miss Rashta and had silver hair and dark eyes, and I mistook Miss Rashta for her.\u201dViscount Roteschu bowed again and continued wheedling his way out.\u201cI have tarnished the reputation of the Emperor\u2019s concubine, Miss Rashta. Please forgive me for my mistake. \u201dHis head was lowered, but his eyes glistened with interest. The young emperor continued to protect Rashta despite knowing she was a runaway slave. Roteschu was truly impressed with the young woman. She thought she could simply wash away her identity and position herself as an imperial concubine. Did the Emperor truly favor her that much? Roteschu had known back at the manor that she could keep men under her thumb, but her talent was greater than he expected.\u201cYes. And you should remember to watch your mouth, Viscount Roteschu.\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201dRoteschu\u2019s lips rose into a faint smirk. Perhaps he could get away from being a little country lord and obtain a more privileged position.***I followed the long corridor with my guards behind me. Both head and heart were heavy, as were my footsteps. Even my dress seemed to weigh me down. Each step I took, I felt a pricking around my ribs.When I arrived at the western palace, I leaned my head against a pillar to brace myself against the sick feeling inside. My pride was injured. Why was Sovieshu so stubborn when it came to Rashta? Where was the Sovieshu I knew, whose eyes glistened when he read a book on the reign of the previous emperors?\u201cQueen.\u201dThere was a rustling sound and a voice from down the hallway. There was only one person who called me Queen. I quickly straightened up and turned around, and found Prince Heinley standing a ways away and frowning at me.\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not presentable.\u201dI was lucky that I didn\u2019t shed tears, and I placed a smile on my face.\u201cAre you taking a walk?\u201dBut the prince did not react. He kept looking at my face. Were my eyes red? I turned around for a moment as he approached, and when I turned back he was nearer. Prince Heinley lifted his hand, then stopped, leaving it to hover near my face. His hand was trembling.\u201cI usually wipe away my friend\u2019s tears and hug them when they are heartbroken.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause the Queen is my friend, can I do that?\u201dI shook my head, and the prince withdrew, but he still looked sorrowful and his ears were flushed.\u201cDid your husband insult you again?\u201dAgain?\u201c\u2026Why do you think that?\u201d\u201cJust. I just do.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t really say. It\u2019s personal.\u201d\u201cI should have met the Queen first.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cIf I had been born five years earlier\u2026damn it.\u201dPrince Heinley lips quivered. I was surprised to see him in so much hurt when I hadn\u2019t even explained what happened. What was he talking about?He hesitated a moment before speaking again.\u201cIf I can\u2019t offer you any consolation, would you like me to send you Queen?\u201dI couldn\u2019t hug Prince Heinley to calm myself, but the bird\u2019s presence would be a welcome warmth.\u201cYes. Where is Queen now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send him to your room.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright if we see him together.

He\u2019s bashful whenever there are two or more people in the room with him.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThat Queen, the one who played with my ladies-in-waiting? I stared at him doubtfully, and Prince Heinley flushed. For some reason he didn\u2019t want to see Queen with me.Ah. Perhaps it was too forward if Prince Heinley came into my room or I went into his, or if we spent time together at the garden in the evening.\u201cI apologize. I made an unreasonable request.\u201dWe had decided not to be friendly in public. Prince Heinley groaned and placed a hand on his forehead.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026anyway, what do you want to ask about Queen?\u201d\u201cHis favorite\u2014\u201d\u201cThe Empress.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cQueen\u2019s favorite is the Empress.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy was his face so red? He looked quite embarrassed. Was it childish to say that the bird looked like his human? I smiled from the charming image, but that was not what I meant to ask.\u201cThen please tell him thank you.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cAnd I want to know what his favorite food is.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026food.\u201d\u201cI usually bring water to my room, but I\u2019d like to give him something to eat.\u201d\u201cQueen will love anything you give him.\u201dI thought Prince Heinley was responding too much from his own perspective.\u201cStill, there must be something he likes.\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s a good bird, so he\u2019ll eat anything.\u201dHe suddenly tightened his lips and turned his head sideways. His jaw was clenched as if he were trying to suppress laughter.\u2026Was Queen a big eater? Or was he saying that as a joke?Before I could ask him anything else, Prince Heinley turned away to leave, saying he would send Queen.When I returned to my room, I opened the window so Queen could enter when he arrived.When Prince Heinley first brought up Queen, I only wanted to hug the warm bird, but as we talked more I decided I wanted to give Queen some delicious food as well. I consulted Sir Artina on the subject.\u201cWhat kind of food do birds usually like, Sir Artina?\u201dThe imperial guard had their own messenger birds, and I surmised that Sir Artina had more knowledge of birds than I did. As expected, he answered without hesitation.\u201cBirds like insects.\u201d\u201cInsects?\u201d\u201cCaterpillars, mosquitoes, moths\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThis would be more difficult than I thought\u2026\u201cI thought I\u2019d give Queen something he\u2019d like to eat.\u201dAs my guard, Sir Artina was often with me and had known about Queen.\u201cAh. Since he\u2019s a large bird he might like large insects.\u201dWhen I didn\u2019t reply, Sir Artina gave a soft chuckle.\u201cWe have caterpillars meant for the messenger birds. I\u2019ll get you some.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cQueen might not eat if them if they\u2019re are served on a plate. If he\u2019s doubtful, you can feed him with tweezers.\u201dI felt sick imagining picking up a caterpillar with tweezers, but I nodded for now. I had promised Prince Heinley that I would take care of Queen, and I couldn\u2019t back out simply because I was squeamish.Finally, Sir Artina returned with a wooden plate and set it down on the table. It was full of plump, squirming larvae.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dI nodded automatically, but as soon as Sir Artina left, I immediately backed away from the table. I was afraid they would crawl out of the plate at any moment.\u2018Queen is going to eat that\u2026\u2019I sat hunched on the bed and peeked at the table about five or six times to check whether the caterpillars had wriggled off the plate.At last, Queen arrived. Instead of landing on the window sill, he flew gracefully through the open window and circled the room in a glorious sweep, his eyes on me as if to confirm that I was watching his majesty on display. After a brief circuit, he landed on my knee. I stroked his neck and back, and he gave a loud cry and wiggled his tail.\u201cYou\u2019re incredible, Queen.\u201dQueen raised a wing at the compliment, and I thought it was now a good time to prepare the caterpillars, nervous as I was. Once again I brushed his back and hugged him.\u201cI wanted to give Queen something to eat.\u201d\u2013 Gu?\u201cYour master says you\u2019ll eat anything\u2026\u201d\u2013 Gu!\u201cI think he\u2019s wrong.\u201d\u2013 \u2026\u201cSo I prepared something that big, nice birds like the most.\u201dQueen nodded enthusiastically. I picked him up and brought him to my desk.\u201cHere are some caterpillars, Queen.\u201dFortunately, the larvae were still on the plate, and I set him right in front of it.\u2013 !Queen pulled away, his eyes blinking wildly. Sir Artina had said that Queen might be doubtful if I fed him like this, so I stroke the bird\u2019s back again and picked up a plump caterpillar with a pair of tweezers. I could feel the fine hairs on my body rise as I came near the plate, but I steeled myself for Queen\u2019s sake.\u201cCome on, Queen. Let\u2019s eat.\u201dThe bird, however, drew even further backwards and refused to eat.\u201cTry it, Queen. It\u2019s okay.\u201dI jerked my hand and got the caterpillar right in front of Queen\u2019s face. The caterpillar suddenly wriggled, then slipped from the tweezers and landed on Queen\u2019s head.\u2013 Guuuuu!The bird leapt up with a shriek.\u201cQueen?\u201dSurprised, I tried to catch him, but he was hopping everywhere like crazy. Queen leapt out the window, caterpillar still attached to his head, and flew away and finally disappeared.***Was it the wrong kind of caterpillar? Sir Artina\u2019s birds ate them and were fine. Was it because Queen was a different species of bird?I worried about Queen all night long and slept uneasily. It was him that eased the hurt caused by Sovieshu. I was heartbroken by the distrust in Sovieshu\u2019s eyes, but as soon as I remembered Queen, the image of Sovieshu was pushed away.The next day, I left my room as soon as I finished breakfast to see Prince Heinley. I couldn\u2019t visit his room, but I would likely run into him around the southern palace.\u2018I need to ask if Queen returned safely.\u2019However, as soon as I left the palace, I discovered Prince Heinley leaning against a pillar and staring at the building.\u201cPrince Heinley.\u201dHe turned to me, omitting the greeting bow and immediately speaking.\u201cI answered wrongly yesterday. He doesn\u2019t eat raw food.\u201d\u201cWell, then I can give him cooked larvae\u2014\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t eat that.

She was grateful that Sovieshu protected her. The Emperor knew from the beginning that she was a runaway slave, of course, but his desire to safeguard her had compelled him to cover it up even after the matter was revealed. How many other men had sweetly whispered their devotion to her before abandoning her, using their identities as a shield? Ironically, it was Sovieshu, the most powerful man in the empire, who did not do so.But fear of the past still nipped at her heels. Just when she had barely shaken off her shackles, just when people were starting to look at her as \u201cRashta\u201d instead of \u201cslave\u201d, was when her identity grabbed her ankles again. If it weren\u2019t for Sovieshu\u2019s love for her, her dream would have died because of Roteschu.But what about the people who once hung onto her every word and smile? What would they do now? Rashta was worried. She hadn\u2019t yet met with the other nobles since the truth came out, and she was fearful that those smiling faces would turn into rejection.Rashta stroked the amber bracelet on her hand, but her heart did not settle.\u2018No, even if Rashta is a slave, Rashta is now the Emperor\u2019s concubine. It won\u2019t be the same as before\u2026\u2019Rashta hugged a doll that Sovieshu had designed for her, a soft thing made of fabric and cotton. Then, the door opened, and Viscountess Verdi entered the room with an uneasy expression on her face.\u201cMiss Rashta, Viscount Roteschu came to see you\u2026What should I tell him?\u201d\u201cThe lord?\u201dIn the confusion of the moment, Rashta used the same title she had used in the past. Viscountess Verdi looked startled, but she didn\u2019t say a word.The viscountess\u2019s expression was replaced by a kind smile, but Rashta was sure the other woman must be laughing at her. If the viscountess knew about Roteschu\u2019s relationship to Rashta, she shouldn\u2019t have mentioned him. Wasn\u2019t it the subordinate\u2019s job to keep others out of the way? Rashta was sure that if the viscountess were still working for the Empress, she would have been more responsible.Rashta bit her lip. If she had known this, she would have lain down in the Emperor\u2019s room and feigned sickness. It was a mistake to return here to organize her thoughts alone.No, no\u2014the problem was that the Emperor allowed the viscount to go around freely in the first place. Why didn\u2019t the Emperor just drive him out? Why didn\u2019t he just kill the viscount himself or put him in prison? Wasn\u2019t Sovieshu capable of anything?Rashta held back the hot tears in her ears as she gave an order to Viscountess Verdi.\u201cTell him to go back.\u201dHowever, Viscountess Verdi hesitated.\u201cTell him to go back!\u201dRashta yelled this time, but Viscountess Verdi still did not move. Are you ignoring me now too? Rashta wanted to tell in rage. The viscountess continued in a shaky voice.\u201cWell\u2026he said if you don\u2019t let him in, you would regret it\u2026\u201d\u201cHe said that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnger gave Rashta courage, and she gritted her teeth.\u201cThen tell him to come in. Let me see his shameless face.\u201dShe was determined to give him a cold bowl of abuse.However, when he entered, an ominous smile on his face, her insults died on her lips.\u201cLady Rashta. Congratulations. You are the Emperor\u2019s concubine.\u201dViscountess Verdi, who was staring alternately between Rashta and Viscount Roteschu, rushed out of the room when Rashta glared fiercely at her.Rashta turned back to look at Viscount Roteschu, who helped himself into an empty chair. \u201cVery good, I like it,\u201d he said contentedly.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dRashta imitated the Empress\u2019 stern tone. Rashta\u2019s own voice was perfect in charming people, but it lacked authority. The viscount let out a chuckle.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown to be quite a lady now, Rashta.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thoughtlessly say my name. You will no longer simply address me as Rashta.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true\u2026for a definite period.\u201d\u201cDefinite period?\u201d\u201cDo you know how many years a woman stays as an emperor\u2019s concubine?\u201d\u201c!\u201dRashta bit her lip at the viscount\u2019s barbed remark. He was tapping his fingers against the table and bobbing his neck in time, when he noticed the bracelet on Rashta\u2019s wrist.\u201cOh, how beautiful. Is it made of amber? Hm? Let me take a look.\u201dRashta flung her hand behind her. Viscount Roteschu frowned for a second, then smiled.\u201cThe Emperor ordered me to correct my erroneous claim that you were a runaway slave. Now I\u2019m being treated like a fool who cannot even recognize a person\u2019s face. Whether your secret will be revealed or not is up to me. I\u2019m thankful for the gold and silver, but it\u2019s not quite sufficient, hm?\u201dRashta turned on him wildly.\u201cThen you should not have said that from the beginning! You\u2019re shameless! You\u2019re only hiding that I\u2019m an escaped slave because the Emperor ordered you to. You\u2019re not doing this for me.\u201dAn insidious smile spread across Viscount Roteschu\u2019s face.\u201cWell then, why did I say nothing about the baby you abandoned?\u201dRashta paled.\u201cBaby\u2026\u201dBlood rushed to her face again, and she clenched her fists. The white of her eyes were red with blood.\u201cHow dare you lie! You killed my baby!\u201dRage flooded every pore of her body. The way he so nonchalantly claimed that she abandoned her baby echoed hatefully in her ear, but she forced her mouth shut for fear of Viscountess Verdi overhearing them.Viscount Roteschu said \u201cWell?\u201d and widened his eyes in an exaggerated circle. Finally, Rashta stood up.\u201cYou can\u2019t threaten me with a baby that\u2019s already gone.\u201dViscount Roteschu chuckled.\u201cGone\u2026what do you mean, Rashta?\u201dIt was an ordinary laugh, but Rashta felt her spine chill. Roteschu\u2019s expression suddenly hardened and his tone turned mocking.\u201cI would not kill my own grandchild, my own blood.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re lying! I saw the body with my eyes\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, do you want me to bring it to you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What would people think if I were to suddenly disappear after I said you were a runaway slave? Wouldn\u2019t they say the Emperor was trying to hide something?\u201dRashta was accustomed to listening Roteschu speak as if he would trample her underfoot, but his voice suddenly took on a pleasing tone. She swallowed hard.\u201cBesides, one can\u2019t live so innocently in the Imperial Palace. So much deception to do, how could you leave that kind of work to someone who doesn\u2019t know your secret?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou foolish creature, I\u2019m saying you should direct that hostile glare towards someone else. I already know everything about you. In other words, I can perfectly be your hands and ears.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need someone like you!\u201dViscount Roteschu tutted at her.\u201cPlaying dress up doesn\u2019t make you a lady, Rashta. Perhaps after a time you will be able to shake off the past and be accepted among the nobles, but by then, would you still be a concubine that the Emperor loves?\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes trembled.\u201cThe Emperor says he only loves Rashta.\u201d\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Well, how should I say this\u2014you haven\u2019t forgotten my son, have you?\u201dRashta bit her lip. The viscount\u2019s son, who had whispered his vows of love to her, began to change as the birth of Rashta\u2019s baby approached. He started out persistent and stubborn, but gradually exhausted himself.After the baby died, Rashta had pleaded with him to run away together. Eventually he told her, I love you, but I don\u2019t want to change my life for you.\u2013 You looked like you were stuck in a mire, and I wished to save you from it. But I was wrong. You are the mire, and I can\u2019t save you from it. Even any children born between use will be dragged into that mire, and trapped in it.That miserable day. It wasn\u2019t just the baby that Rashta lost.Rashta clenched her fists, and blood began to seep from where her fingernails bit her flesh. Instead of stopping, Viscount Roteschu continued to run his blade-like tongue across Rashta\u2019s wounds.\u201cThe more you are loved by the Emperor, the more other poor, beautiful women will look at your situation and hope. To escape their mire, they\u2019ll want to latch on to the Emperor as well.\u201d\u201cThen\u2014\u201d\u201cThen what? Greedy nobles, foreign lords, and anyone interested in political collusion will send all kinds of beautiful women to the Emperor. And many of those women will have education and status.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are not an empress, Rashta. If you lose the emperor\u2019s love, you go back into slavery.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026it\u2019s no use whether you help me or not.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s up to you and your ability to remain in his favor, but I can make sure no other concubine will come around or last.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cFirst you have to let me in.\u201dViscount Roteschu bent slightly at the waist and spoke in a low voice.\u201cIf you help me and my family come to the center of power, I will play the role as your parent. Your child is my grandchild, and what is good for it is good for me. \u201dThe words would have sounded tempting to Rashta if it were not for the speaker. How could a man like him accept a slave as his daughter-in-law? Even a passing dog would laugh at them. It was clear that he only wanted to keep her close to him to leech from her.Rashta\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, and Viscount Roteschu chuckled.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me. But you\u2019ll know at a glance that your child looks like you.\u201dRashta couldn\u2019t speak, frozen as if she lost all function of her body. Viscount Roteschu stared at her and stood up with a satisfied smile.\u201cThink carefully. I will continue to pretend to be an idiot who can\u2019t recognize faces, as His Majesty commanded.\u201d***The New Year\u2019s three-day celebrations came to an end, and most of the guests returned to their respective homes, save a few who requested to stay longer\u2014including Prince Heinley. I reviewed and filled out the period of stay for the remaining guests, their secretaries, servants and knights. When I saw Prince Heinley\u2019s leave date marked \u201cundetermined,\u201d I smiled reflexively.I remembered he insisted that Queen did not eat raw food. Earlier I had consulted with an ornithologist and asked if there was a bird with such a diet, and recalled what he had said.\u201cA bird that doesn\u2019t eat raw food? Do you mean it cooks its food? Such a bird would tip the academic world, Your Majesty.\u201dPerhaps Prince Heinley was not feeding Queen properly by mistake.\u2018But Queen seemed to hate bugs.\u2019Maybe the person in charge of feeding Queen cut up the caterpillars? No wonder Queen was surprised to see a live one. Next time I would give that to him.I encountered Prince Heinley on the way back from work, so I took a walk with him and told him about my plan. I wanted to inform him in case hey might misunderstand that I was trying to feed Queen some strange food.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAfter my explanation, the prince made a strange groaning noise.\u201cPrince? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026can you just give water?\u201d\u201cAn ornithologist\u2014\u201d\u201cEastern birds and Western birds have different temperaments. Western birds eat cooked food.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWas I supposed to believe that? I made a skeptical expression, and he looked at me imploringly.\u201cYou can just pat his head. That\u2019s enough.\u201dDid Prince Heinley not like other people feeding Queen? I once heard about a dog that didn\u2019t eat anything other than what the owner gave. It could be the same with the bird. I smiled and nodded, wondering if I was being rude, though the tension in Prince Heinley\u2019s face didn\u2019t loosen.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sure feeding him is lovely, but he\u2019s already lovely himself.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026but I\u2019m sorry anyway.\u201dHe sighed and raked his hand through his blond hair.\u201cJust. There are a lot of constraints.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Queen\u2019s birthday soon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s his birthday?\u201dPrince Heinley burst out laughing, then corrected himself.\u201cI meant your birthday, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou knew?\u201dI smiled weakly. Large celebrations were usually held on the birthdays of the emperors and empresses, but mine was too close to New Year\u2019s. Holding large parties in succession with one another could hurt public opinion and place a burden on the nobles. Since my childhood, my birthdays had been a more intimate affair of dinner with family and acquaintances. Prince Heinley didn\u2019t know this, of course.When I smiled awkwardly, he stopped walking and offered his own grin.\u201cI know the day, but I still don\u2019t know what you would like.\u201d\u201cYou mean as a gift?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m your best friend. I want to spend that day with you, don\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201c!\u201dBefore I could answer, I heard a rustling sound. Instead of answering Prince Heinley, I looked around and spotted someone I didn\u2019t expect to see.It was Sovieshu. Other than a single knight, he was walking alone. Sovieshu\u2019s gaze landed on me and Prince Heinley.\u201c\u2026Empress.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How long are you going to remain here?\u201dPrince Heinley replied with a broad smile, even though he had an argument with the Emperor only a few days ago.\u201cAbout two to three weeks, I think.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that too long? The Western king is not in the best health, and it\u2019s not good for the crown prince to stay away.\u201dSovieshu was not shy in hiding his dislike for Prince Heinley, which had built up since Prince Heinley\u2019s conflict with Rashta. Sovieshu\u2019s observation wasn\u2019t wrong, however.\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201dPrince Heinley responded with a simple smile and said nothing more. A strained silence reigned over the group.\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave first, Your Majesty. \u201dI quickly said goodbye to Sovieshu, as we would only hurt each other\u2019s feelings if I stayed any longer. However, Sovieshu looked offended and called out to me again.\u201cEmpress.\u201dThat look\u2026did he just want to insult me in front of Prince Heinley? That was my first thought going by past experience. To my misfortune, or perhaps it was a blessing, he spoke to Prince Heinley first.\u201cI need to talk to the Empress, and I hope that you will go your own way.\u201d\u201cI was already walking with her, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI have something to say to the Empress, Prince Heinley.\u201dSovieshu cut between me and Prince Heinley, and he held out his arm for me to take.When I looked at Prince Heinley, I saw his lips were pressed tight, as if he wished I wouldn\u2019t follow my husband. I took Sovieshu\u2019s hand, feeling sorry for Prince Heinley who looked like a sad golden retriever, while Sovieshu shot a glare at him.\u201cWhy are you looking at the Empress with a miserable expression?\u201dSovieshu stared down at him as if he found him pathetic.\u201cThe Empress was showing me around, and the Emperor has taken my guide.\u201d\u201cThe Empress is my wife, not a tour guide for a prince.\u201dSovieshu wrapped his arm possessively around my shoulder. I could not deny him, and sighed and walked alongside his footsteps. It wasn\u2019t until when Prince Heinley was out of sight did he drop his arm.\u201cWhy are you showing around that womanizer?\u201d\u201cI ran into him on the way from work.\u201d\u201cLet someone else handle it from now on. There are many other people in the palace, yet he wants the Empress to guide him?\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley is the successor to a powerful nation with extensive wealth and military power. We don\u2019t have to be on bad terms.\u201dSovieshu glanced towards the knight, who took a bow and stepped away. Sovieshu rested his arm against a pillar and gave me a reproachful stare. I suspected didn\u2019t want me to cultivate relations with the man who demeaned Rashta.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t want you to take care of him.\u201dI knew it. He was incredibly obvious. He smiled grimly and emphasized his words.\u201cHe has a nice face, and he acts like a pet dog in front of you. But he will only bring scandal if you associate with him.\u201d\u201cScandal?\u201d\u201cOther noblewomen and young ladies attach themselves to this womanizer believing they\u2019re in a relationship. However, the Empress is one of the most honorable people in this country. You represent the Empire. Where is the Imperial Household\u2019s honor if you are swayed by a Western womanizer?\u201d\u201cMy honor is not tarnished by talking to him. If you don\u2019t see this friendship as a friendship with any other noble, the West would be unhappy with you.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t listen to me.\u201d\u201cIf this is about Miss Rashta\u2014\u201d\u201cWho says it\u2019s about Rashta? Why is the name Rashta being brought up here?\u201dBecause she was the reason why he hated Prince Heinley. I stared at Sovieshu despite his feign to ignorance, and he gave a frustrated sigh.\u201cYou truly hate Rashta.\u201d\u201cI only said the name because she\u2019s the reason why you want to ostracize Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cNo. You hate her, so you\u2019re using her as a shield in everything.\u201dI was tired. I didn\u2019t want to answer back.\u201cI will leave if you continue on like this.\u201d\u201cAbout Rashta\u2014\u201dI took a few steps and stopped. As I turned around, Sovieshu cleared his throat, and his voice softened.\u201cBefore. I spoke too harshly to you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThree days ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have blamed you when Viscount Roteschu came\u2026I was upset. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dSovieshu awkwardly kept staring at the ground instead of me.\u2018He loses his temper when it comes to Rashta, but he comes back to his senses in about three days?\u2019I should remember that next time something with Rashta happened again. I gave a mechanical smile, nodded, and turned around again.\u201cEmpress.\u201dBut Sovieshu called out to me once more. I turned back, and he approached me hesitantly.\u201cIt will be your birthday soon. We\u2019ve been estranged from each other lately\u2026perhaps we can go to the villa to reconcile. What do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An inharmonious relationship between the emperor and empress would reveal weakness to our enemies, and even if Sovieshu loved another woman, it was my duty to show everyone that I was on good terms with him.\u201cEmpress?\u201dHowever, the answer lodged itself in my throat. My pride was bruised. It was hard to not be affected by strong emotions when my husband loved another woman and took her as his concubine. Whenever Sovieshu and I had problems before it could be ignored, but that wasn\u2019t the case anymore. Anyone with an ounce of wit knew that anytime we fought, it was about Rashta.\u201cYes.\u201dI forced a smile and nodded.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dWhen he heard my answer, Sovieshu smiled and lifted his arm again.\u201cShall we walk together?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dWe strolled the grounds wordlessly together. Our shoes echoed on the stone path, and the breeze flew pleasantly on our faces. In the past, I had taken many pleasant walks with Sovieshu and shared comfortable silences with him. It was all gone days now\u2026I stopped myself from sighing, and Sovieshu broke the silence.\u201cDid you know that Grand Duke Kapmen is still here at the palace?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI had looked over the relevant documents of course, but why did he bring up Grand Duke Kapmen all of a sudden? I looked up, and Sovieshu explained.\u201cKapmen wants to open diplomatic relations between Rwibt and the Wol continent.\u201dOh\u2026is that what he\u2019s here for?\u201cThe officials have varying opinions as to whether it\u2019s beneficial or not. The Hwa continent where Rwibt is located is certainly exotic and appealing, but it\u2019s too different from the Wol continent. Moreover, we\u2019re too far away to significantly influence each other.\u201d\u201cEfforts to establish trade would be a drain on the state coffers.\u201d\u201cExactly. There are so many things to discuss. What is the Empress\u2019 opinion?\u201d\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen graduated from the magical academy in Wirwol. Autonomous or not, it is clearly in Eastern Empire territory. Rwibt may be too dissimilar in culture, but the grand duke has spent many years in this Empire and must have given thought to it more than anyone else. The Eastern Empire is in a relatively good position to open diplomatic relations, so there is no reason to miss this opportunity.\u201dSovieshu frequently consulted me on various issues, and I naturally replied. He nodded in agreement. Instead of commenting on my answer however, he slightly shifted topics.\u201cHave you ever had a private conversation with Grand Duke Kapmen?\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen. He criticized me for not dealing with Rashta properly. Should that be called a conversation?\u201cOnly briefly\u2026\u201dAlright, I\u2019ll call it a conversation. Sovieshu spoke again.\u201cKapmen said if we were to open diplomatic relations with Rwibt, he would like the Empress to be involved.\u201d\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen?\u201dSovieshu seemed to wonder what kind of words Kapmen and I shared, but I did as well. Why did Kapmen criticize me?\u201cHe said he wants you in the next meeting.\u201d***After a conversation that started with my birthday and ended with Kapmen, Sovieshu returned to the eastern palace, while I strolled around more by myself. However, thoughts of Kapmen and my birthday felt distant.Frankly\u2026I was skeptical. Would Rashta, the one who wanted to attend a special banquet for only twenty people, passively let me and Sovieshu leave for the villa alone? Well\u2026there was a high probability that there would be three of us there instead of two, and I would be completely stressed out.I sighed as I approached a fountain, when I spotted Prince Heinley. I halted in surprise. He was exactly at the place I left him. I thought he would have gone for a walk or gone back to his quarters, so what was he still doing here?\u201cQueen.\u201dHad Prince Heinley sensed my feelings? He turned his head and smiled.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone yet?\u201dI approached him where he was sitting by the fountain and splashing the water with one hand.\u201cHmm\u2026can I tell you the truth?\u201dHe pulled his hand out of the water and smiled softly.\u201cI was waiting for you to come back.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cWhen one gets lost, one should remain where they are.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know the way?\u201d\u201cNot intuitively.\u201dI pulled out a handkerchief and offered it to him with a smile. He took it and dried his hand, then tucked the handkerchief away.\u201cMy handkerchief.\u201dHe gave a chuckle as I reached out my hand in embarrassment.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll give it back to you after I wash it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cBut this way we can see each other again, right?\u201dHe gave an easy smile, and I nodded at his playful tone. At the same time, I remembered what he said a few hours ago.\u201cPrince Heinley. About my birthday.\u201dHe said he was here for my birthday, though I didn\u2019t think that was entirely true. He did seem to want to spend time with me, and I felt sorry and wanted his understanding.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can spend time and have a meal together.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cThe Emperor wants to go to the royal villa. Just him and me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis lips parted and he blinked dazedly, until he murmured \u201cYes, I see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s your birthday, and you needn\u2019t feel sorry for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be sorry. I don\u2019t want to put pressure on you.\u201d***\u201cYou must be feeling a lot of pressure\u2026\u201dSir McKenna stared awkwardly at the scene before him. Spread before him were various jeweled rings, prized possessions associated with various legends. Prince Heinley usually carried them in an enchanted pouch, but now he had taken them all out to examine each one. He was going to give one of these precious rings as a gift to the empress of another country. McKenna couldn\u2019t help but be perplexed.\u201cWhy are you giving a ring all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cBirthday.\u201d\u201cEmpress Navier?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that again? \u2026And isn\u2019t the gift too much? The Eastern Empire may be prestigious, but so is the Western Kingdom. There isn\u2019t a wide enough gap between the countries for you to offer such a tribute.\u201dPrince Heinley put the jewels back in his pouch.\u201cI\u2019ll choose when you\u2019re not around. You\u2019re a nag.\u201dHe pulled out a handkerchief instead.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see? It\u2019s a precious handkerchief.\u201dThe prince then transformed into a bird, holding the handkerchief in his beak and flying in front of McKenna. The prince pointed a claw at his neck.\u201cYou want me to tie it there?\u201dMcKenna fastened the handkerchief to the bird\u2019s neck, and he was rewarded with a feathery smack of a tail. Prince Heinley then flew out the window, and McKenna frowned as he watched him disappear.The handkerchief appeared to have been embroidered with the letter \u201cN\u201d\u2026\u201cIs Prince Heinley\u2019s letter acquaintance Empress Navier?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Grand Duke Kapmen had described The Travelogue as a delusional account, it was still the most well-known book on the country. I don\u2019t know why the grand duke requested my presence at that next meeting, but I wanted to broaden my knowledge on the Rwibt culture as much as possible.\u2018I wish I had a book with more detail\u2026\u2019I was seated on a bench cross-referencing the Travelogue with other books when there was a tapping noise from the window.It was Queen. I opened the window and he hopped onto the sill, displaying his wings. I noticed he wore a handkerchief around his neck.\u201cDid Prince Heinley tie this on you?\u201dThe handkerchief was my own. I smiled, and Queen tilted his head. I held Queen in one arm and petted his beak with my other hand, and checked his legs for a note. There was none this time.\u201cAre you here to show off?\u201dOr perhaps he came here to return the handkerchief? He couldn\u2019t answer me of course, and simply blinked at me with his gorgeous violet eyes. I couldn\u2019t resist them, and smothered his head with kisses one after another.\u201cQueen is so pretty, especially with the handkerchief around your neck.\u201d\u2013 Gu!He seemed to like it so much that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to remove it. As I petted his back I thought, Queen smells good. What kind of thought was that? I put my nose to his shoulder and inhaled.\u2013 !The scent subtly reminded me of Prince Heinley. Did he wash the handkerchief and spray his perfume on it? I found it so charming that a bird smelled like this that I leaned in to whisper in his ear.\u201cYou smell like Prince Heinley, Queen.\u201dQueen unfolded his wings in shock. Then he covered his beak with his wings and opened his eyes wide.\u201cQueen?\u201dI playfully called out to him, but Queen trembled and hopped back towards the window.\u201cAre you going already?\u201dHe looked so cute, and I opened my arms to him before he would fly away. However, he stiffened like ice and shook his head.***\u201cSometimes she says the most suggestive things\u2026\u201dBack in his room, Prince Heinley unfastened the handkerchief from his neck. His face was still burning.\u201cMy scent\u2026\u201dHeinley sniffed the handkerchief. He had sprayed it with his favorite perfume after he wished it. She recognized his favorite scene right away?Heinley crouched to the ground, his cheeks flushed. The Empress\u2019 whispered words were for Queen, but he still felt his heart pound as he remembered the way her breath tickled his ear.Unfortunately, it was McKenna who ruined that embarrassing and exciting feeling.\u201cWhy are you naked? Sorry.\u201dHeinley glared at McKenna\u2014his secretary, his knight, his cousin, and even his friend.\u201cYou\u2019ll get sick. Cover yourself up.\u201dMcKenna went to the closet and pulled out a comfortable outfit, while Heinley stood up, clicking his tongue and holding out his hand. Instead of handing the clothes over, however, McKenna had a few questions to ask first.\u201cYour Highness. The person you went to see with the handkerchief\u2026was it the Empress of the Eastern Empire?\u201d\u201cGive me the clothes.\u201dMcKenna handed over the items, and Heinley accepted them with a look that said, Why would you ask me that? McKenna kept staring questioningly, however, but Heinley offered only a vague reply.\u201cWell.\u201dHe dressed, then went outside the palace. He took a pathway that would allow the evening breeze to cool his heated face. McKenna was persistent, however, and stuck by his side.\u201cYour Highness, you have to be honest. Was your letter acquaintance Empress Navier?\u201dMcKenna ignored Prince Heinley\u2019s initial defiance.\u201cDoes it matter? Just keep your mouth shut. I\u2019m recounting a good memory and your keep interrupting.\u201d\u201cIs memory important when reality is right in front of you? How can I not care, Prince? Is your letter acquaintance someone you can love?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in favor of you in a serious romantic relationship. However, if your partner is the empress of a powerful country, it\u2019s a different story\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should never be involved in the empresses of other countries, powerful or not. Do you want to become politically entangled with the Eastern Empire?\u201dMcKenna\u2019s eyes were moist in genuine worry. Prince Heinley and Empress Navier had a dead end relationship. Even if Emperor Sovieshu had his heart set on Rashta, no country would ever remove the sitting empress and place a runaway-slave-turned-concubine in her position. The empress could not initiate a divorce from her husband either. And even if Emperor Sovieshu deposed Empress Navier, there was no way she would remarry a prince from another country.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. And you\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d\u201cReally? Can I trust you?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy won\u2019t you answer, huh?\u201dMcKenna paused, then asked more carefully,\u201cI haven\u2019t asked the most important thing yet. Do you two have mutual feelings for each other? \u201dHeinley hesitated, then he held up his hand, his eyes looking elsewhere. His expression was the same, but the mood had changed. McKenna stopped his interrogation and looked in the same direction as Prince Heinley.A woman with a light purple parasol was walking towards them on the white stone pathway. It was Rashta, Emperor Sovieshu\u2019s concubine.McKenna quieted his mouth. The Emperor\u2019s lover and rising star of society had completely sank in a matter of days. McKenna wasn\u2019t sure about the other residences, but many of the guests in the southern palace sneered at Rashta for covering up the fact she was a runaway slave. After Viscount Roteschu\u2019s claim spread, Rashta went around attempting to correct the gossip, but no one believed her. Perhaps that was why the once-shining Rashta was now in a depressed mood.McKenna looked at Prince Heinley. The prince already had stirred trouble with Rashta, and he was quite outspoken once he started talking. Whether it was a blessing or misfortune though, Prince Heinley walked past Rashta as if he didn\u2019t notice her, and McKenna was relieved and quick to follow. However, it was Rashta who called out.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dMcKenna huffed and pushed at the small of Prince Heinley\u2019s back. However, Prince Heinley turned with a frown, and Rashta approached them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked miserable.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201dHer voice quivered in meekness. McKenna understood why so many people fell in love with Rashta. There was something about her distress that aroused pity in the viewer\u2019s heart.\u201cNo.\u201dHeinley\u2019s voice was a flat monotone, however, and McKenna tutted warningly. Despite Rashta\u2019s tarnished reputation, she was still highly favored by the Emperor. McKenna didn\u2019t care what Heinley said about her behind the scenes, but the prince would have to be careful in front of her face\u2026Prince Heinley seemed to completely disregard that, however.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me? I think you do.\u201dRashta\u2019s large eyes glistened and filled with tears. McKenna knew what was coming. Prince Heinley could appear light and casual, but at the drop of a hat he could become cold and frightening. Prince Heinley\u2019s frigid gaze intensified, and Rashta, who seemed intimidated, started to cry.\u201cYou are a wonderful man.\u201dMcKenna didn\u2019t expect those words to leave her mouth. Rashta gazed at Prince Heinley with her dark eyes, not a trace of fear on her expression. On the contrary, she looked deeply moved. Who reacted to a cold attitude like that\u2026?McKenna\u2019s eyebrows twisted in disbelief at her unusual behavior, and Prince Heinley, too, frowned in surprise. Rashta gave a sheepish smile as she wiped her eyes with one hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You must be embarrassed by Rashta\u2019s sudden crying.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter the rumor spread, people began to treat Rashta horribly. They used to be sweet, but now they laugh and mock Rashta.\u201dShe finished dabbing her tears with her sleeve, but as soon as she lowered her arm she choked up again.\u201cBut Prince Heinley is the only one who treats Rashta the same way\u2026of course we\u2019re not on good terms, but Rashta was just touched\u2026\u201dThe urge to protect her strengthened even more when she was crying. Some nobles only treated other nobles with kindness, and looked down at people with lower status. It was likely those same people had terribly humiliated Rashta.\u201cI see.\u201dDespite the pitiable sight before him, Heinley continued to speak with cold formality. He seemed to have no opinion on her situation, and he checked his wristwatch and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough,\u201d then walked away without another word.McKenna, feeling sorry for Rashta, smiled awkwardly at her and followed Prince Heinley.\u201cYour Highness, I know you\u2019re on bad terms, but that was a little too cold, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYou want me to show courtesy to someone who tried to deceive me? Who accused me of being a liar?\u201d\u201cI\u2026yes. She did do that.\u201dWhat extraordinary talent. McKenna was certainly offended on Heinley\u2019s behalf, but he had momentarily forgotten about it when he saw Rashta cry. He tilted his head in thought, while Prince Heinley turned back towards the southern palace.\u201cMore importantly, when is Elgy coming? Did you deliver the letter?\u201d\u201cI delivered it properly. But why did you call him all of a sudden?\u201d***The excitement around New Year\u2019s gradually cooled, and the palace officials roused themselves their sluggish hangover and began to move around briskly again. I felt back on track as well. I went to the central palace, looked over my work, then had a lengthy conversation with the minister of foreign affairs for advice on a subject. To my surprise, he reported that Duke Elgy Klaudia, a royal family member of the Blue Bohean Empire, had requested to visit the palace.\u201cDuke Elgy Klaudia?\u201dI stared at the minister in bewilderment and he nodded.\u201cDid he come here as part of a delegation mission?\u201d\u201cNo, he said he stopped by for sightseeing.\u201dForeign guests rarely visited a month or two after the New Year\u2019s celebrations. There were no festivals at this time, and those who did stay past New Year\u2019s did it so they wouldn\u2019t have to visit again. Why would Duke Elgy Klaudia, who couldn\u2019t attend the New Year\u2019s celebrations on the account of being too busy, suddenly come now?\u2018Ah, perhaps he came to see Prince Heinley?\u2019Duke Elgy Klaudia was known to be a close friend of the prince. So\u2026a playboy friend. I wondered at this, but I signed the documents permitting his stay, and continued on with my work. I heard the name Duke Elgy again while having dinner with the ladies-in-waiting.\u201cYour Majesty, did you hear? Duke Elgy Klaudia came to the palace today.\u201d\u201cOf course she knows, Laura.\u201d\u201d Oh, I see. So you know too? Who Lord Elgy was with all day?\u201dI cut my salad with my knife.\u201cPrince Heinley?\u201dLaura snorted, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHe was with the slave, Rashta.\u201dAh\u2026Rashta.\u201cThat\u2019s surprising.\u201dSince Duke Elgy was Prince Heinley\u2019s best friend, I thought he would avoid Rashta on principle. Laura continued on nervously.\u201cThey didn\u2019t just meet. They were together all day long. I heard they were very close to each other.\u201dAnother lady-in-waiting, who was waiting for her turn in the conversation, followed Laura\u2019s words quickly.\u201cNot just that. They were so close, they caused quite some trouble.\u201dWhat happened? I looked at her questioningly, and she shook her head and clicked her tongue.\u201cDuke Elgy and Rashta were walking together when they came across a noble. He said he knew Rashta was a runaway slave and insulted her for being with the duke. As soon as the noble finished speaking, Duke Elgy punched him.\u201d***The table in Rashta\u2019s drawing room was loaded with a diverse assortment cakes\u2014light pink strawberry cake, yellow banana cream cake, melon cake\u2026The desserts, tailored to Rashta\u2019s taste, were created by the Emperor\u2019s chef and were made to perfection in both appearance and taste. However, these dishes were not for Rashta today.\u201cThank you for earlier, Duke.\u201dRasta smiled and thanked Duke Elgy sitting opposite her. She was deeply grateful to him. Although Viscount Roteschu retracted his remarks about Rashta being an escaped slave within a day, everyone was reluctant to believe him. As she feared, Rashta quickly became estranged from the nobles. Her friends stopped visiting her, and the flow of gifts disappeared.What was most upsetting, however, was the occasional glimpses she saw of their gazes. Some nobles showed contempt, others curiosity, some pity, and others vague interest.But Duke Elgy was different from all of them. He treated her kindly, like when she was treated as an aristocrat during New Year\u2019s. At first Rashta believed it was because Duke Elgy was ignorant about the rumors, but soon she saw with her own eyes that he didn\u2019t care about it at all. He even threw his fist at the nobleman who taunted her. He was a royal, he was a duke, he was a beautiful man who surrounded himself with the love of women\u2014and he punched someone for her. Rashta was flattered beyond measure, and so she invited him to enjoy her favorite food.\u201cThank you. I only respond that way to rude people, by the way.\u201d\u201cWell, as you may have heard, there are bad rumors going around about Rashta. They\u2019re false, of course.\u201d\u201cDoes this always happen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. The ones who are rude are the ones who should be ashamed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI suppose it happens a lot.\u201dDuke Elgy propped his arm against the chair arm and uttered a low swear word.\u201cThat bastard. Saying you\u2019re a slave in front of you. So what if you\u2019re a slave? I should have thrashed his mouth more.\u201d\u201cThose are scary words, Duke\u2026\u201d\u201cI originally came here to see a friend, but I\u2019m glad I met you first. If I weren\u2019t there, no one else would stand up to that ruffian.\u201dHis friend was probably going crazy that he didn\u2019t show up yet. He rubbed his eyes and wondered if he was concerned.\u201d He has a mean temper. \u201dDuke Elgy was so different from the nobles Rashta met before. He seemed rough like a mercenary from a street bar, yet simultaneously had a sophisticated and noble air. She found it even more amusing to see the contrast of this muscular, big-mouthed noble eating dainty cakes. And he didn\u2019t care if she was a slave\u2026Rashta especially liked him.\u201cAnyway, miss, let\u2019s make it so it doesn\u2019t happen in the future. There\u2019s no way those ruffians will suddenly disappear.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201d\u201d You\u2019d better take care of it as soon as possible. \u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way to fix it. Viscount Roteschu spread those rumors himself, and people don\u2019t believe him even when he says it\u2019s false.\u201d\u201cPass it on to someone else. It\u2019s faster than an explanation.\u201dDuke Elgy answered her bluntly and swallowed another bite of yellow cake.\u201cPass it on?\u201d\u201cThe role as society\u2019s chewbone. Shift it to someone else.\u201d\u201c!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I opened the window and leaned my head out, allowing the cool air to cleanse my body. Today was the day I would discuss opening diplomatic ties with Grand Duke Kapmen.\u2018I have to be at my best.\u2019I mentally composed myself. When I tied the curtains together, I discovered a letter on a window sill, secured underneath a stone so it wouldn\u2019t fly away.\u2018Prince Heinley?\u2019I opened the letter and saw Prince Heinley\u2019s handwriting.\u2013 Trust me.\u201c?\u201dWhat did he want me to trust him for? I was surprised, but I felt happy receiving a letter after a long while. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t send a reply right away since Queen was gone. I tucked the paper in a drawer and went to the bathroom to wash my face in cold water. Afterwards I rang a bell, and the ladies-in-waiting entered to prepare me for the day.\u201cYou\u2019re having a meeting at a round table, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ll be seated next to people, so we shouldn\u2019t choose a dress that\u2019s too wide.\u201dCount Elizabeth selected a black dress that fell almost in a straight line, and then arranged my hair.\u201cIf Queen comes when I\u2019m away, please give him some water.\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cAnd allow him inside if it rains. Sometimes he gets caught in the rain outside the window.\u201dI left Countess Eliza with my requests, then took a deep breath and left the room. I believed I could face this.***The meeting convened at 10 a.m. It was a relatively small assembly\u2014present were the finance minister, the foreign minister, important officials from each department, Grand Duke Kapmen, Sovieshu and myself.The topic was the opening of diplomatic relations with Rwibt, and the benefits, losses, and feasibility. There were a total of eight continents in the world, with little exchange between them. The Wol continent, where the Eastern Empire is located, and the Hwa continent, where Rwibt was located, were relatively close compared to other continents, but even so, it was still a long distance. It would take time to generate profits from private trade, and quick communication was essential in state-led transactions. Given the situation, it was difficult to reach a conclusion. However\u2026\u2018Why does Sovieshu look like he\u2019s in a foul mood?\u2019He glowered through the discussions. He was supposed to lead the meeting, but he made it difficult to offer free opinions and the officials kept looking at him.\u2018Is it because of what happened between Duke Elgy and Rashta? He shouldn\u2019t bring that with him to work\u2026\u2019I lifted my head from the map and swallowed my sigh, when I encountered Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s gaze. His expression was neutral, neither antagonistic nor favorable. When our eyes met, he nodded, and I nodded in return.***The meeting crawled slowly, and by the end of it I was in charge of the matter at Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s recommendation. His reasons were incomprehensible, considering his attitude towards me at New Year\u2019s Day.\u2018Grand Duke Kapmen.\u2019I finally closed the meeting, and the room emptied. I followed Grand Duke Kapmen out into the hallway.\u201cDo you have a moment? I want to ask you something.\u201d\u201cYes. Go ahead and ask.\u201d\u201cWhy did you recommend me to take charge?\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen raised his eyebrows.\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious. A few days ago\u2026\u201dHe criticized me for how I dealt with Rashta\u2014or lack of it. I didn\u2019t say it out loud, but his lips curved up as if he understood what I meant.Was he smiling? That made me quite upset.\u201cBecause it holds true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no one else who could be in charge other than the Empress.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhen I spoke of the Imona and Imot, you were the only one that understood what that meant.\u201dHe recommended me for that reason only? I hurried to explain.\u201cAs I said before, I only know a few words. I wasn\u2019t being humble, it was true.\u201d\u201cYes, but many people don\u2019t even know those words.\u201dThe language was not a compulsory subject at the academy \u2026Was it really alright to leave me with this serious task based on that alone? I couldn\u2019t show weakness as empress, however, so I finally nodded. Now that it had come to this, I had to fill in the gap with effort.\u201cPlease, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen gave a slight bow as if he had nothing more to say, then turned and walked down the corridor.Tang tang tang.The sound of his shoes echoed with each step he took. I turned my head and went the opposite direction, and when I saw Sovieshu through the open door of the conference room, leaning against a table.He had been brooding throughout the meeting, but now his expression looked even darker.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dI was worried and approached him, but I regretted it as soon as I did. Did something happen with Rashta? It was impossible for me to ask this, but I couldn\u2019t ignore Sovieshu when he was looking like this.\u201cYou look grim. Are you alright?\u201dInstead, I avoided reason and only asked about his current state.However, the words that left his mouth stunned me.\u201cEmpress. Do you have a preference for foreigners?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I was about to say I couldn\u2019t refuse Grand Duke Kapmen, but then I changed my words.\u201cIt\u2019s not something you need to concern yourself with.\u201dI kept getting involved in strange misunderstandings, especially with Prince Heinley, but it was Sovieshu who brought in a concubine first. It was unlikely I would bring in my own lover as retaliation, but in any case, Sovieshu shouldn\u2019t criticize me in what I do. In my view, that was fair.Sovieshu, however, he seemed to have different ideas.\u201cHow can I not care? Are you not my wife?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI wanted to retort, \u201cDid you consult me before taking in Miss Rashta?\u201d but I knew he would say I brought her up again because I was jealous.Sovieshu exhaled in a dignified manner.\u201cDo you like Lord Kapmen? To the point that he makes you sigh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. We only spoke of this one thing.\u201d\u201cYes, well, I\u2019m glad to hear that\u2026but I\u2019d like you to be more mindful.\u201d***After that was another meeting with the finance minister and treasury officials on the annual state budget, which included the salary of the court officials, royal guards, as well as the budget for various events.\u201cThe tax revenues are about the same as last year.\u201d\u201cWhile the system is expected to be unchanged, we don\u2019t know the costs.\u201d\u201cWe can use last year\u2019s budget plan.\u201d\u201cAlright. Overall there is no national conflict expected, so we can set it similar to last years.\u201dSo far, everything had gone smoothly. Complications arose, however, when it came to Rashta. The emperor usually gave his concubines a considerable, though unfixed, amount of money each year. Because there was no standard and each emperor paid different amounts, it was difficult to reference to previous cases.\u201cDo you have a separate account book for Miss Rashta? It should be easy enough to calculate.\u201d\u201cThe books did not come to the treasury. Since there is no money assigned yet, it should be listed under your account. The Emperor is providing for her now.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201dI didn\u2019t think Sovieshu was going to give me the account books somehow.\u201cWhat if we use Countess Malti as an example here, Your Majesty? She was a commoner before she became a concubine early in the emperor\u2019s rule.\u201d\u201cPrices have gone up since then, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re comparable.\u201d\u201cWe still have to use some precedent. Once the amount is set it will be hard to lower it, but if there is a new concubine\u2014ah, sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019re right, we should be sure.\u201dThe meeting went on longer than I thought, and when I left the room with the finance minister, the air was already cold. The sun was still out, but the sky was not that bright.\u2018I missed lunchtime.\u2019My meeting with Grand Duke Kapmen went from morning until afternoon, and from the afternoon onward I missed my meal when I met with the finance minister. When I realized I hadn\u2019t eaten, I suddenly felt hungry and hastened my stride. I also wondered if Queen had dropped by.I hurried along, and at the fork leading to the eastern and western palaces, I saw the hem of a blue skirt peeking from the bushes. Sir Artina, who was following me, frowned.\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dI answered with a shake of my head. As if I was heard, the owner of the protruding skirt stepped away from the bushes, revealing it to be Viscountess Verdi.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dWhen our eyes met, she broke away and her eyes darted around. After making sure no one else was here, she urgently beckoned at me. However, I didn\u2019t approach and Sir Artina rebuked her.\u201cRude.\u201dViscountess Verdi shook her head vigorously. Desperation flickered on her face, then she looked around again and came up to me.\u201cI have something urgent to say. I may not be your lady-in-waiting anymore, but I can\u2019t rest easy until I tell you this.\u201dHer lips trembled. I prevented Sir Artina from admonishing her again and signaled Viscountess Verdi to continue speaking. The viscountess pressed her hands together.\u201cI think Viscount Roteschu knows something about Miss Rashta. A weakness.\u201d\u201cWeakness?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t hear the details, but I think she\u2014\u201dThe sound of something snapping interrupted her. I turned towards the direction of the noise, but Viscountess Verdi had disappeared into the bushes again.\u2018What was that all of a sudden?\u2019I looked where Mrs. Verdi had stood, then saw someone else approaching me again.It was Rashta.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dShe looked thinner than before and had dark bags under her eyes. She greeted me with a short bow and spoke in a feeble voice.\u201cWho was there just now?\u201dI shook my head, and she peered closely at the bushes where Viscountess Verdi had disappeared. I didn\u2019t know if she spotted the viscountess or not, but it was clear she suspected someone had been there.Rashta sighed. Instead of asking more about the disappeared person, she looked back at me gloomily.\u201cWell\u2026Your Majesty. Is it alright if Rashta asks you something?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the Duchess Tuania.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or perhaps Prince Heinley or Viscountess Verdi. I didn\u2019t expect her to ask about this.\u201cDuchess Tuania?\u201dWhy her? I stared at Rashta, and she answered in a small voice.\u201cIs Duchess Tuania easy?\u201dI thought I heard wrong. Easy?\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dI frowned at her, and she carefully examined my face.\u201cAre you upset?\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania is a good person and a good friend.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dRashta hesitated, twisting her hands together.\u201cThere are always men at Duchess Tuania\u2019s side.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThe Duchess seems to enjoy being with men too. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s allowed when she\u2019s already married.\u201dShe looked up in embarrassment, then waved her hands in protest.\u201cRashta is not asking for bad reasons. Rashta is asking because she doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania is popular with everyone, both men and women.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to believe me.\u201cBut at the party, she was always with men\u2026\u201dI sighed. She was asking me because she didn\u2019t understand? That was worse in my view. It was better if she had some idea what she was saying, but if she was asking out of ignorance, she could unintentionally tarnish someone\u2019s reputation. At the very least, it was fortunate that she was asking this when there were only the two of us.\u201cIt only appears that way at parties, because men and women pair together to dance.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is nothing wrong with Duchess Tuania, so don\u2019t say anything else like that from now on.\u201dRashta gave a small \u201cyes\u201d, and I turned around and walked back to the western palace. However, even after I returned to my room and spoke with my ladies-in-waiting, Rashta\u2019s strange question continued to gnaw at me.\u2018Why would she ask about Duchess Tuania?\u2019Presently, Rashta was disliked and shunned in society. Although the popular Duke Elgy sided with her, it would not be easy to restore her image. If she was interested in gossip\u2026\u2018Then by any chance?\u2019\u201cCountess Eliza.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cAre there any bad rumors about Duchess Tuania recently?\u201d\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I heard that Viscount Langdel has been utterly lovesick since he danced with Duchess Tuania at New Year\u2019s.\u201dCountess Eliza gave a chuckle at the story.\u201cHe must be completely wild about her.\u201dNoblemen falling in love with Duchess Tuania was not an unusual occurrence. I wondered if Rashta was trying to shift the topic of gossip towards someone else. Was I worrying for nothing? Well, in any case, Rashta didn\u2019t have the social clout to influence people. It had only been a day since Duke Elgy met her as well, and there was no way he could spread strange rumors for her either.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, I felt uneasy as I remembered the way Rashta constantly glanced at Duchess Tuania at the New Year\u2019s ball.\u201cWhy do you ask, Your Majesty? Did you hear something?\u201d\u201cRashta asked.\u201dCountess Eliza\u2019s face twisted.\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026just tell me right away if you hear anything strange.\u201d***I kept busy with preliminary research about Rwibt\u2014 I compiled information from tourists, merchants, and explorers who were recently at the Hwa continent, but their time was spare and they couldn\u2019t abandon their jobs.I was so busy that I forgot my birthday was coming. Surprisingly, it was Sovieshu that brought it up.\u201cIt takes several hours to go to the villa by carriage, so we should finish up our work and leave the day before.\u201dI was just finishing the imperial budget before submitting it for approval to Sovieshu. At Sovieshu\u2019s sudden reminder, I put my feather pen down on the inkwell. It took me a few seconds before I realized what he was talking about.\u201cAh. Birthday\u2026\u201d\u201cOh goodness.\u201dSovieshu chuckled as if he found my dazed reply amusing.\u201cThe empress really doesn\u2019t care about anything when she gets into her work.\u201dIt was a teasing remark.\u201cCan you guess whose birthday I was talking about?\u201d\u201cI remember now.\u201d\u201cYou should remember your own birthday.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you mind if we leave a day early?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll schedule it.\u201dI flipped through my schedule, and Sovieshu spoke up again.\u201cDo you remember the tree planted at the villa?\u201dI nodded, and Sovieshu stretched himself lightly as he reminisced.\u201cIt was when you were still crown princess and very small. You were cute back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis time I smiled. In the Eastern Empire, there was a story of a wish tree, and superstition had it that if you made a wish while planting a tree, it would come true.When I was a princess I was very short for my age, and I found it especially stressful when I was always surrounded by adults. After worrying alone, with no one to share these feelings with, I finally planted a wish tree. The rule was that I had to shovel the ground and plant the seedlings myself. However, I was young and small, and after a few hours of inefficient digging, I hugged the seedling and passed out from exhaustion. When I woke up, I found Sovieshu digging the hole.\u2013 Your Highness! If you dig, I\u2019ll have to do it over again!\u2013 It\u2019s all right. We\u2019re a couple. A couple is like one body, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you or I do it.\u2013 \u2026Really?\u2013 Yeah. That\u2019s what my father the emperor said.Shoveling was a tough job, so I relented and allowed Sovieshu to do it. After digging a decent-sized hole, I placed the seedling in it and covered the base with dirt. I put my hands together and made a wish, and Sovieshu said, \u201cWhat did you wish for?\u201d\u2013 \u2026I asked to be taller.\u2013 Why? It\u2019s nice to be small.\u2013 I follow the Empress and she always goes beyond a partition. But the screen is bigger than me, so I can\u2019t see\u2026After that I felt unwell with body aches, and Sovieshu got into trouble because his palms were ragged. Sovieshu was always taller and stronger than I was, but he was still young too.The ends of my mouth tipped up in a smile. When I looked at Sovieshu, I saw him smiling as if he were remembering as well.\u201cBut that tree worked, didn\u2019t it? Now you\u2019re very tall.\u201dI smiled wordlessly, picking up the feather pen again and looking down at my papers.A bitter feeling mixed in with the memories. After all, my wish was not about my height. Back then, I prayed that Sovieshu and I would keep a good relationship for the rest of our lives.\u2026But it didn\u2019t come true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My family was already was moneyed, but after I became empress I lived a more luxurious lifestyle. Of course, much of my wealth was spent on various welfare projects and state subsidies, and I didn\u2019t often buy things for my own pleasure. Because of this, most of the gifts given to me were meaningful, rather than expensive. Especially the one my mother sent me\u2026\u201cThe duchess must have been worried about you, Your Majesty.\u201dI smiled awkwardly as Countess Eliza pored through my mother\u2019s gift, a semi-annual magazine called La Trang, which contained portraits of the most popular actors of the day. My mother sent me one that featured only male actors. It was not meant to hurt Sovieshu, but perhaps she thought that taking my own lover would settle my mind, and actors were a popular choice among nobles.\u201cAh, this one\u2019s wonderful. Look at this man, Your Majesty. His shoulders are so broad.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this one better? That one has bad rumors about him.\u201d\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d\u201cHis sexuality is apparently rather strange. Well\u2026Al\u2014Hmm. I\u2019ll keep them anonymous. A baroness said that she and that actor tried to play with fire, and she ended up nearly burning for real.\u201d(TN: \u201cPlay with fire\u201d can also refer to a short but passionate romance.)\u201cReally?\u201d\u2026The ladies-in-waiting seemed to enjoy the gift more than I did.Meanwhile, my father had sent me the latest fashionable dresses, as well as rare books, fabrics, and jewelry from abroad.There was also an anonymous gift\u2026called the \u201cElixir Of Love.\u201d\u2026It was too awkward for me to use.***It was two days before my birthday.Most of the presents had already arrived, and by tomorrow morning I would leave for the royal villa. I packed a suitcase for two days and spread several books on my bed. As I was deciding which ones to take, I heard the sound of wings pattering in the air.Queen?I rushed to the half-opened window and widened it even further.It was Queen, but he couldn\u2019t easily enter the room like usual. His small head bobbed in and out of the window frame, and when I looked over I saw him carrying a large box tied with string.\u201cQueen!\u201dSurprised, I stretched out my hand, and Queen deposited the box and flew through the window. He fell onto my bed and panted for breath.\u201cDid you bring this by yourself?\u201dI tested the box Queen brought. It was quite heavy even in my hand, and I was surprised that he carried this himself. He was a large bird, but he was still a bird. Queen lifted his head, nodded helplessly, then flopped again.\u201cPrince Heinley has gone too far. He should\u2019ve come in person or asked someone else to bring it here.\u201d\u2013 !\u201cWhy are you shaking your head? Didn\u2019t Prince Heinley make you do this?\u201d\u2013 \u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t like me saying bad things about Prince Heinley?\u201dHe nodded his head.\u201cAlright\u2026I\u2019ll be nice.\u201dQueen had no energy to lift himself up, and settled in with a flop of his wings. I patted his rear, he was so startled that he jolted, but then he went limp as if he were feeling weak again. I sat beside Queen and put the box on my lap. What in the world did Prince Heinley send?\u201cAh.\u201dInside was a large cake, and on the lid of the box was a letter. I opened it to read the contents.\u2013 I think I\u2019m good at cooking. I hope someone will compliment me.Queen had risen and seated himself quietly next to me, and stole a glance in my direction. I placed one hand over Queen\u2019s shoulder, and dipped a finger from my other hand into the frosting and placed it between my lips. It had a simple, sweet taste of fresh cream without any greasiness.\u201cDid he make the cream all by himself?\u201d\u2013 ?\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dI laughed, and Queen shook his tail and rubbed his head against my arm.\u201cIt must have been heavy. Thank you for bringing this to me, Queen.\u201d\u2013 Gu!\u201cI\u2019ll thank Prince Heinley separately.\u201d\u2013 Gu!\u201cYour owner is a very nice person.\u201d\u2013 !\u201cHaha, why are you so embarrassed?\u201dI placed the cake to one side, then placed Queen on my lap and kissed his forehead. He turned completely into stone. I found his reaction so amusing that I smothered him with more kisses here and there.Afterwards, I took the cake to the table, cut a slice and placed it on a place. I soon discovered that the cake wasn\u2019t the only gift.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI let out an involuntary gasp. Embedded in the soft sponge were jewels of various sizes and color. I plucked one out and discovered it was a blue-colored diamond. I felt a poke, and turned and saw Queen blinking up at me with his large purple eyes, as if he was worried about my reaction. He looked so serious that I couldn\u2019t help but answer honestly.\u201cIt\u2019s a little too much.\u201d\u2013 !It was acceptable to receive gifts even more extravagant than this from a foreign delegation. But Prince Heinley had given this as a friend. The cost wasn\u2019t a problem to him, of course, but the meaning of the gift was ambiguous.I set the jewel aside, and when I saw Queen I looked at him in surprise and hugged him.\u201cWhy are you crying, Queen?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Empress Navier.\u201dA knight of the Western Kingdom was astonished when he saw me. I was in front of the quarters where Prince Heinley was staying, and another knight with blue hair came rushing towards me. He recognized me, but more than that, his gaze indicated that he seemed to know something. My ladies-in-waiting knew that Prince Heinley and I exchanged letters, and there had to be someone on his end that knew about me as well. Still, I had to guard myself to those even close to the prince, so I smiled faintly at him.\u201cI have a message for Prince Heinley. Is he inside?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you came. I was worried because he came here crying.\u201d\u201c\u2026The prince came crying?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry? Oh, no, not the prince, the bird. It\u2019s a bird. The prince\u2019s mean bird came crying.\u201dThe blue-haired man added that the prince never cried, then hurriedly knocked on the tightly closed door and shouted.\u201cPrince, Her Majesty the Empress is here!\u201dAbout three seconds passed. I thought I heard a loud noise from inside, perhaps something like falling furniture, but then it was silent. I looked at the blue-haired knight to see if everything was alright, but it seemed unperturbed by the loud noise coming from the room. A few minutes later, the knight opened the door after a signal that it was okay to come in from the inside.\u201cThank you.\u201dI slowly entered the room, curious to what that was all about. Prince Heinley\u2019s room was clearly of the southern palace, yet it was somehow unfamiliar. His scent lingered faintly in the air, and there were unusual items scattered here and there. Prince Heinley, standing in the middle of the room, was the most familiar thing in this strange space.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had something else to do\u2026\u201dAs I quickly looked around the room and stared at him, the prince smiled and kissed me on my hand before stepping back.Something else\u2014did that mean he was washing up? It looked like he had hastily thrown on his clothes. He usually had nary a wrinkle on his carefully selected attire, but he looked rather rumpled at the moment. I could see his skin peeking through the loose buttons of his shirt, but it would be awkward if I pointed it out. It wasn\u2019t like there weren\u2019t people that wore their shirts like that.I turned my eyes on the prince\u2019s face, wondering whether to ignore it or point it out, only to see something that caught me by surprise.His eye were red and there was a wetness on his eyelashes. It was obvious that he had been crying a little while ago.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have come. This was bad timing.\u2019I awkwardly turned away my gaze. Did he cry while taking a bath? How embarrassing it must be for him to visit so suddenly. I was truly sorry.\u201cDid you receive the cake?\u201dHowever, because it was strange to have a conversation without looking at his eyes, I finally turned my head again. Prince Heinley was staring at me with moist purple eyes. I heard that animals often take after their master. Was this the reason? Suddenly I realized that Prince Heinley\u2019s eyes looked very similar to Queen\u2019s.\u201cOh no. Did you not get it?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until the prince questioned me again did I manage to shift my focus away from his wet eyes.\u201cI received. I just wanted to come here to say hello and thank you.\u201d\u201cThank goodness. I was worried Queen wouldn\u2019t deliver it properly. \u201d\u201cYes, it looked a little heavy for him to carry.\u201d\u201cI wanted to take it myself, but Queen insisted on carrying it himself\u2026.He\u2019s unexpectedly strong, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dPrince Heinley gave a languid smile, but his eyes were still misty, making him look less arrogant and proud than usual.\u201cWould you like a cup of tea? Oh, was the cake delicious?\u201d\u201cIt was delicious. Did you make it yourself?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hobby. I even have my own kitchen in the West. Are you good at cooking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never done it before\u2026so I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d\u201cI have heard that those who can cook and those who can\u2019t are made for each other. I suppose that means the Queen and I are meant to be.\u201dThat story was unfamiliar to me. I looked at him with a frown, and he turned red and scratched his nose.\u201cI suppose the saying doesn\u2019t cross countries.\u201d\u201cI suppose not.\u201d\u201cIs there something you wanted?\u201d\u201cI\u2026Your Highness. I wanted to see Queen.\u201d\u201cQueen? Why so suddenly\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe was crying so hard when he left. I\u2019m worried about him.\u201dAs I spoke, I paid attention to signs that Queen was somewhere in the room. However, I could neither hear nor smell a bird. Prince Heinley smiled awkwardly.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. Queen went hunting.\u201d\u201cHunting?\u201d\u201d I don\u2019t know exactly what exactly he went hunting for, but he goes out alone to fly in the capital.\u201d\u201cDid he come in crying?\u201d\u201cSomewhat? But he was quite alright.\u201dThe blue-haired knight worried that Queen came crying, but Prince Heinley said otherwise? I couldn\u2019t help but be curious, but Prince Heinley looked calm. If the owner said it was alright, then it had to be. I nodded reluctantly.\u201cI see. That\u2019s a relief.\u201dI nervously brushed the skirt of my dress. There was nothing else I had to say. I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you again,\u201d and glanced towards the entrance as a signal that I wanted to leave, and Prince Heinley quickly strode forward to open the door. He didn\u2019t stop there however, and followed me as I stepped outside. I looked at him curiously, but he simply smiled and asked me which direction I was going.\u201cSo how was the gift?\u201dI pointed to one direction, and Prince Heinley fell into step beside me. When I glanced back briefly I spotted the blue-haired knight, who ducked his head hurriedly when our eyes met. I turned my head around again.\u201cQueen? Was the gift not to your liking?\u201d\u201cOh, I liked it. Thank you, Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it too much?\u201d\u201c!\u201dHow did he know that? I looked up with a start, and Prince Heinley explained with a faint smile.\u201cI was a little worried. Of course, I am friends with you, but we haven\u2019t known each other for a long time. I thought you might feel burdened.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel pressured. The western kingdom is a jewel capital and many of the mines are owned by the Imperial Family. \u201dFeeling relieved, I nodded, and the prince smiled and placed one hand on his chest.\u201cThank goodness. I was worried.\u201d\u201cI can see why you\u2019re mistaken to be a womanizer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re friendly and caring.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not a womanizer, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cOf course I believe that.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t completely believe this face.\u201dWell, at the New Year\u2019s celebrations he had laughed when I said I didn\u2019t believe the rumors he was a womanizer. He smiled awkwardly, and murmured in a gloomy voice.\u201cIt\u2019s because of my friend. He truly is a flirt.\u201d\u201cDuke Elgy?\u201d\u201cYou heard of him?\u201dIs there any noble who hadn\u2019t heard rumors of the two of them? But instead of being honest, I asked more questions about the Duke Elgy.\u201cDuke Elgy recently came to the southern palace. Did he say he liked it here?\u201dAfter he arrived, most of what I heard about him had to do with him and Rashta. It was said he often accompanied Rashta, and there was no mention of Prince Heinley, who was supposed to be a close friend. That was why I questioned Prince Heinley, to know if he and Duke Elgy had a fight.Prince Heinley\u2019s expression subtly shifted. I stopped walking for a moment in worry, and Prince Heinley stopped as well.\u201cAs a matter of fact, Your Majesty, I have a favor to ask of you.\u201dHe completely sidestepped my question.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about how to say it. Now that you brought it up, I think I\u2019d better ask for a favor.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cStay out of side in front of Duke Elgy.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat did you mean by this? I looked up in amazement, but Prince Heinley looked more serious than ever.\u201cCan you do that?\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cAny woman who gets entangled with the Duke Elgy is doomed to unhappiness.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cSometimes he\u2019s like a living cursed doll or a real ghost story. If you catch his eye\u2026\u201dWas this a joke? A form of flattery? I smiled, but Prince Heinley lowered himself slightly so that his brilliant purple eyes were level with me.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, please. Never, ever look beautiful in front of him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As we were only staying at the villa for two days, I didn\u2019t have much pack. I wore comfortable, low-heeled shoes instead of my formal ones, and donned a waterproof cape in case of rain.\u201cEnjoy Your vacation, Your Majesty.\u201dCountess Eliza, who was not accompanying me on my trip, carefully fixed my buttons, and mentioned she was thinking of going home for the two days I was gone.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Countess Eliza. I will take care of her.\u201dCountess Jubel laughed and patted Countess Eliza on the back, who narrowed her eyes and lowered her hands. I smiled as I watched the two opposite personalities exchange glances without speaking.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWhen I arrived at the central palace, I found Sovieshu standing in front of the carriage. He was dressed in his usual formal clothes, and I didn\u2019t see his luggage or his servants following him. I gave him a questioning look, and Sovieshu explained with a regretful expression.\u201cI have a matter to attend to. Can you go ahead?\u201d\u201cIs it that urgent? You don\u2019t have to push yourself to go the villa.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s urgent, but not completely so. It is not an issue that the Empress needs to visit for her birthday.\u201dI didn\u2019t mind, but I decided not to answer. Sovieshu smiled softly and wrapped his arms around my shoulders.\u201cYou need rest after all the hard work you\u2019ve done. After I finish my work, I\u2019ll leave in the evening.\u201dThe villa was twelve hours journey away from the capital. If he left in the evening, he would travel all night until morning. I was worried, but\u2026it had to be fine. Come to think of it, sitting face-to-face with Sovieshu would be supremely awkward, and so I climbed into the carriage without protest.***Countess Jubel fell asleep as soon as she got into the carriage, while I spent my time reading a book. That was for about two hours, until motion sickness from the swaying of the carriage overwhelmed me. I closed my book and looked out the window.The carriage was on a well-maintained road leading out of the capital, and I saw yellow farmland stretching out before me. Farmers and scarecrows were scattered about the field, and somewhere I could hear children\u2019s laughter.\u201cI hope this trip will improve the relationship between you and the Emperor.\u201dI turned my head and saw Countess Jubel yawning. Our eyes met, and she shrugged.\u201cI couldn\u2019t say that in front of Countess Eliza.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for nobles to divorce, Your Majesty. There are many political complications and disagreements about how to divide assets. Who would take more benefits? But if one doesn\u2019t care for the loss, one can divorce at any time.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but yes. You\u2019re the Empress. No matter how much you hate the Emperor, you cannot initiate divorce first. So it\u2019s better to get along.\u201dCountess Jubel began to nod off again. I leaned my head against the backrest with both hands on my knees. I agreed that it was better to be on good terms with the Emperor. However, there was something that I could not agree with Countess Jubel on.Divorce\u2026Could I improve our relationship just because I couldn\u2019t divorce him? It was this part that I disagreed with. To others, the fact that I wasn\u2019t in a position to divorce Sovieshu may elicit sympathy\u2026In any case, there was no way that anyone treated poorly by their spouse wouldn\u2019t be pitied. Sovieshu was completely blind when it came to Rashta, and occasionally ended up accusing me because of it.But even if I could get divorced, I had no desire to do so from Sovieshu. I was groomed to be the empress from an early age, with rigorous training and specialized education throughout my childhood into adulthood. I didn\u2019t know if I fit the aptitude or not, but to be empress was my destination in life. It would be a lie if I said that I was alright with my husband bringing in a concubine and treating me coldly. Our marriage was political, however, and while it was hard, I could carry the burden. I didn\u2019t want to lose my lifelong work simply because Sovieshu loved someone else.If there really came a situation where I could tolerate it no longer, then perhaps\u2014?***\u201cYour Majesty, look at this!\u201dRashta ran to Sovieshu with an engraved pendant given by Duke Elgy from Blue Bohean.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dRashta burst into the room with a large smile and then stopped in surprise.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dRashta covered her mouth as she stared at Sovieshu before her.\u201cYour Majesty, you look wonderful\u2026\u201dHe was dressed in a black and white suit, different from the fancier outfits of the New Year\u2019s celebration. He smiled weakly, not looking in the mirror. Rashta quickly went ot his side and admired him from top to bottom.\u201cYou look good everywhere. Aren\u2019t you being too shameless by looking this handsome?\u201d\u201cYou flatter me.\u201dRashta gave a small giggle then held out her hand to him.\u201cLook at this.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the crest of Blue Bohean.\u201d\u201cWow. Your Majesty\u2019s genius. You recognized it right away?\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes widened in admiration again, and Sovieshu gave a small smile and rubbed her back with one hand. It was a strange reminder that Rashta was from another world, as nobles were almost obligated to memorize the crests of other houses.\u201cWhy are you dressed so nicely?\u201dShe placed the pendant in her pocket. In truth she had shown the pendant from Duke Elgy to Sovieshu because she wanted him to be jealous. She was taken aback when he seemed rather calm, however, as if he were ignorant of her intentions.\u201cI told you a few days ago. I have to go to the royal villa.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026Rashta thought you were supposed to leave by morning, but it was cancelled. You said you\u2019d be back the day after tomorrow, right?\u201dSovieshu glanced at the clock and nodded.\u201cMake yourself comfortable here, Rashta.\u201dSovieshu lightly kissed Rashta\u2019s cheek and turned away.\u201cRashta will see you off.\u201dShe followed him enthusiastically, rambling away about her day. While Viscount Roteschu had completely destroyed her reputation, Duke Elgy\u2019s appearance had slowly drawn back some of the nobles to her. She was both happy and relieved, and she wanted to tell all of this to Sovieshu.She stopped speaking, however, when she saw a silver jewelry box inside of Sovieshu\u2019s carriage. Her eyes widened.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a present for the Empress.\u201d\u201c\u2026Empress?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)Rashta\u2019s eyes widened even further.\u201cYou\u2019re taking it to the villa?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Empress\u2019 birthday.\u201dAfter Sovieshu\u2019s reply, Rashta looked surprised and questioned him again.\u201cWho\u2019s going there?\u201d\u201cIt will be the Empress, myself, the servants and the knights. There are no guests other than a lady-in-waiting. Why?\u201dRashta covered her mouth with her hands. She looked so alarmed that Sovieshu frowned at her.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cRashta didn\u2019t know it was the Empress\u2019 birthday.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d\u201cNo one said anything\u2026\u201d\u201cWe want to be as quiet as possible. It\u2019s not an open party, so only close friends or relatives know.\u201d\u201cViscountess Verdi could have mentioned it. She would have known.\u201dSovieshu smiled when Rashta pouted her lips.\u201cYou must be unhappy to only find out about her birthday now.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re still family. Rashta could have given something\u2026\u201dSovieshu gave a chuckle.\u201cYou\u2019re very kind.\u201dRashta twisted her fingers.\u201cWell\u2026 \u201dIt was about time for Sovieshu to leave, the coachman looked over at the pair of them.\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Rashta. If I leave too late, it will be difficult for the coachman to drive.\u201dSovieshu took a step into the carriage when Rashta quickly grabbed his sleeve.\u201cRashta?\u201dHe turned around curiously.\u201cCan you take Rashta, too?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dSovieshu blinked in surprise, and she nodded hurriedly.\u201cRashta couldn\u2019t get a gift for the Empress, and if Rashta doesn\u2019t celebrate her birthday she will be disappointed.\u201dSovieshu couldn\u2019t undo the skeptical expression on his face, and he was unconvinced that Navier would be disappointed by a lack of gift. However, he couldn\u2019t say that the Empress would probably dislike it if Rashta came along.\u201cBring Rashta with you, Your Majesty. She can liven the mood.\u201d\u201cThe mood?\u201dShe mimed drinking alcohol and Sovieshu replied with a faint smile.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that much.\u201d\u201cStill, let Rashta go. It\u2019s a family party, and I\u2019m family.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It will only be myself and the Empress.\u201dRashta\u2019s cheeks puffed out and she folded her arms.\u201cOh dear. You\u2019re sulking.\u201dSovieshu laughed and pinched her bright red cheek.\u201cDo you really want to come?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like when you\u2019re alone with another woman.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t protest when I brought up the villa the other day.\u201d\u201cI thought you were going alone or in a group for work.\u201dRashta was being cute and energetic, and the carriage driver gave an involuntary chuckle. She quickly looked down at her toes. Sovieshu checked his watch then stroked her shoulder soothingly.\u201cLater it can just be the two of us. Is that enough?\u201d\u201cWhen? On Rashta\u2019s birthday?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cRashta prefers being in groups.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cBut Rashta likes being with you alone, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou are a greedy person.\u201dHe grinned at her, and she quickly put her arms around him.\u201cRashta wants a lot of people for her birthday, and then have you alone later.\u201dHer delicate scent tickled his nose. Sovieshu kissed her lightly on the cheek and answered, \u201cYes\u201d before boarding. The carriage driver snapped the reigns, and Rashta waved at the retreating carriage.Before it disappeared completely, she lowered her arm. Sovieshu had promised he would spend time with her later, but now he would be alone with the Empress. She tried not to worry. She couldn\u2019t have stopped him even if she had known in advance.\u2018It will be alright. The Emperor and Empress are in a typical marriage.\u2019Rashta slapped her cheeks and returned to her room at the eastern palace. She would have a glass of champagne and a good night\u2019s sleep.However, someone was already waiting for her there. Her heart dropped to the floor when she recognized the despicable figure standing in the corridor. She braced herself, then walked up to Viscount Roteschu. He was standing in front of the door, yawning with his hand in his pocket, but he grinned as soon as he saw Rashta.***The windows at the villa had thin, translucent curtains. Because the curtains were rarely in use, aesthetic was emphasized rather than practicality, and I woke up to bright sunlight in my eyes. I decided the curtains needed changing right away. It was only after I sat up groggily in bed that I realized I was in a different place, and it was my birthday.Sovieshu\u2026It was 7 a.m. according to my watch, and considering that it took about 12 hours to get here from the capital, I doubted that he had arrived yet. Perhaps by the time I had breakfast, he would have arrived and then fallen asleep.I yawned again and got out of bed. I remembered my usual routine, but realized that I didn\u2019t bring any work. Today really was a day for idle reading and resting. It had been a while since I spent the whole day on myself.After concluding that this trip was a good idea, I went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and took a quick shower.\u201cYour Majesty, you should\u2019ve called me!\u201dCountess Jubel gave a sudden exclamation when I left the bedroom with my hair already done.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to call!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just going to relax today.\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose. What would you like for breakfast?\u201d\u201cJust bread and juice, please.\u201dWhile Countess Jubel was busy preparing breakfast, I went into the drawing room and took my unfinished book out of the bag. I opened my book and reclined against an armchair.After some time, I heard the door open. I thought it was Countess Jubel at first, but the footsteps sounded heavy. When I looked up, I saw a smiling Sovieshu in a suit.\u201cYou came here to rest and you\u2019re reading?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dI closed the book and stood up. Despite the fact that he was smiling, he looked exhausted, as if he had been riding in a carriage all night.\u201cDid you just arrive?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe pointed his finger towards the window, and through it I spotted several servants unloading the carriage. Sovieshu spoke, his voice a murmur.\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201dHe collapsed on the couch next to me, and put his head backwards and closed his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe looked like he was about to pass out from exhaustion. I touched his forehead and found it was warm.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSire?\u201dMaybe he was asleep. Then, Sovieshu opened his eyes and stared at me with wide eyes.\u201cYou have a slight fever. You should sleep.\u201dI carefully took my hands off his forehead and made to stand up.\u2018Is there an official on standby?\u2019Sovieshu grabbed my wrist as soon as I was about to get up. I looked back at him, and he ordered me to stay before getting up to leave the room. When he returned, there was a silver box in his head.\u201cA gift?\u201d\u201cYou knew it right away.\u201dSam smiled lightly and held the gift towards me.It was a music box.When I opened the lid, tinkling music floated out, and a shining ring was displayed in the center. There was also a silver necklace and earrings on either side of it.\u201cThank you.\u201dWith a smile, Sovieshu lifted the necklace from the box.\u201cAllow me.\u201dI hesitated and took the box with one hand, and with the other I lifted my hair and turned around. His hands felt feverishly hot against my neck as he placed on the necklace.Then suddenly, something warm and smooth touched my neck.\u201c!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)I was staring at the earrings in the box when I looked up in surprise. Once again I felt his lips gently caress my ears.I let go of my hair and closed the lid on the box. As soon as I turned around, Sovieshu crushed his lips against mine. Instead of reciprocating, however, I kept my mouth closed and backed away. Sovieshu looked surprised, but when our eyes met he smiled and he held out his hand carefully to me.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared at his lean fingers and shook my head.\u201cEmpress?\u201dHis voice was soft, but I shook my head again. I didn\u2019t know why he wanted to kiss me all of a sudden, but I didn\u2019t want to do it with him now. He had been with Rashta for over a month. It was awkward to kiss those lips that had already kissed someone else.\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201dSovieshu lowered his arm, and the room lapsed into an uncomfortable silence. He stared at the chair I had been sitting on a moment ago, while I stood still with the music box in hand. It took me a moment to realize that music was still trickling from the box, and I shut the lid. Sovieshu turned his eyes away from the chair, looked at the box, then looked at me again.\u201cSometimes\u2026you are like a colleague, not a spouse.\u201d\u201cA spouse is also a colleague you walk with life through together.\u201d\u201cIf spouses and colleagues are the same, then what\u2019s the point of marriage?\u201dSovieshu sighed and left the room, claiming he was tired. I heard the door close. I closed my eyes and took a shuddering breath.A moment later the door opened again, and when I opened my eyes I saw Countess Jubel entering, glancing backwards over her shoulder. She set down the tray of bread, juice, and jam, but she kept looking back.\u201cYour Majesty, did you fight with the Emperor?\u201dShe must have come across Sovieshu on the way here.\u201cThe Emperor seems to have a fever, so please send the official.\u201dI ignored her question and picked up a plate.\u201cI want to eat alone. Will that be all right, Countess Jubel?\u201d***I was left completely alone in the room, going through the mechanical movements of eating my breakfast. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and the strawberry jam was a sweet as a spoonful of sugar. The green grape juice was cool and refreshing as well, but I found I couldn\u2019t enjoy the taste.Was it because of the hollow feeling in my heart? I was confused for a moment whether I was eating or not.Finally, after nibbling only half the bread, I set it down. I took a sip of juice when I saw a familiar bird by the window\u2014golden feathers, purple eyes, a large size, a handsome beak\u2026\u201cQueen?\u201dIt looked like him, but how could be here? I walked over to the window to open it, and the large bird hopped inside the room.\u201cQueen!\u201dIt was really Queen. For whatever reason, my eyes started to sting with tears.\u201cHow did you come here, Queen? Were you looking for me? \u201dQueen nodded, then wrapped his wings around me in an embrace.\u201cQueen?\u201dIt was as if he were trying to comfort me. No matter how large a bird was, it couldn\u2019t be bigger than a human, so Queen\u2019s wings didn\u2019t completely cover me. He wrapped himself around me as much as he could, however, and my heart was moved by his effort. I kissed him on the forehead and he froze as usual, but he did not pull away.Was he really trying to cheer me up? I had heard that some animals could instinctively sense human emotions. Perhaps Queen knew what I was thinking and didn\u2019t even realize it.I pulled him away from my arms and set him on my lap to hug him again.\u201cI might not be able to live without you, Queen.\u201d\u2013 !\u201cWhat if you have to go back to the Western Kingdom?\u201d\u2013 \u2026\u201cShould I follow you?\u201dQueen nodded enthusiastically and cawed.\u201cWhere on earth did Prince Heinley get a handsome boy like you?\u201dAs if trying to make himself look more beautiful, he widened his claws and looked at me with large, clear eyes.-\u201cShould I bring a bird the same kind as Queen?\u201d\u2013 !\u201cQueen, if I get you a baby brother will you be nice to him?\u201dThis time Queen shook his head violently, and I couldn\u2019t help but double over in laughter. Suddenly\u2014\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dCountess Jubel burst into the drawing room. She looked surprised to see Queen in my arms, but she shook her head as if it were not the time.\u201cYour Majesty, the Emperor has collapsed!\u201dWhat?\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\u201cWe moved him to a nearby vacant room and called the official.\u201d\u201cSend him to the capital and tell him to bring a doctor. Just in case.\u201dI hurriedly stood up and set Queen down by the window sill. He looked like he didn\u2019t want to go, but I couldn\u2019t play with him now.\u201cBe a good boy. Go to your master, Queen. Ah, wait. Countess Jubel.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cPlease give Queen some water. He flew a long way.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cQueen, get some water and rest before going back, alright?\u201dI kissed Queen on the forehead and rushed out of the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Have you considered it?\u201dRashta sat crouched in her chair, glancing suspiciously over at Viscount Roteschu. She had succeeded in sending him back the night before because it was late, but he had returned in the morning.\u201cConsidered what?\u201d\u201cJoining me.\u201dViscount Roteschu spoke in a leisurely manner, as if he had no intention of leaving. Rashta clenched her coffee cup, resisting the urge to throw it.\u201cThe nobles all want to get back in your favor again. Isn\u2019t this all due to my help?\u201d\u201cYour help? It was Duke Elgy that helped me.\u201d\u201cAnd wasn\u2019t it because of me that Duke Elgy went to your side?\u201dRashta smiled bitterly at his brazen answer. He gave a small hum as he gathered his hands together and rested his chin on them.\u201cI need some money now.\u201dHe wanted money? Rashta laughed derisively at his request. Though she had expected it, she couldn\u2019t believe that he was asking for money this early in the morning.\u2018How can anyone be like this?\u2019She had hated Viscount Roteschu for a long time, but now he was even worse. However, he was a man of influence and power, while she had nothing. She had buried her hatred under her fear, but now that the fear had gone, the hateful feelings that had once been clouded over began to emerge.Like now.\u201cYou said you would help Rashta.\u201dShe spoke coldly, suppressing the urge to yell abuse at him.\u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing yet you want money?\u201d\u201cI went to all kinds of parties uninvited to save your reputation. Wasn\u2019t that help?\u201d\u201cNothing helped until Duke Elgy appeared.\u201dHer voice was harsh and she quickly continued.\u201cJust so you know, Duke Elgy doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m a slave or not, so don\u2019t try to blackmail me for this.\u201d\u201cHe said that now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTsk tsk tsk tsk tsk.Viscount Roteschu clicked his tongue and leaned back against his chair.\u201cYou actually believe that. You\u2019re running out of time, Rashta.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to speak to him anymore. She leaned over the ring the bell, but he pushed it aside.\u201cMy silence comes with a price, Rashta. I\u2019m raising your baby, so you should at least be willing to pay the expenses.\u201d\u201cThe expenses?\u201d\u201cDo you know how much it costs to dress, raise and feed a baby? You should pay for it, of course. Do you think I should raise him for free?\u201dRashta\u2019s jaw dropped. His lofty manner sparked her anger, but ranting at him was not the answer to the problem. She didn\u2019t even know if the baby was hers.\u201c\u2026How much do you need?\u201d\u201cWell, the cost of living and food has gone down\u2026let\u2019s see. A hundred krut or so will do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cJewelry is an acceptable payment if you don\u2019t have money.\u201dRashta went to her jewelry box and took out three of her smallest, unattractive rings, then held it out to him. She thought it was a waste, but it was better than him spreading rumors about a baby.\u201cOh, these are beautiful.\u201dViscount Roteschu selected a ring he was satisfied with and tucked it in his breast pocket. As Rashta watched him, she thought,\u2018This is not the time. I need to find out about the baby before he makes any bigger demands.\u2019Before Viscount Roteschu would bring the baby, she had to go to his estate and confirm his identity herself. And if he turned out to be fake\u2026Rashta gripped her skirt tightly. Whatever would the outcome, she might just go mad.\u201cAh, Rashta. Can I give you a piece of advice?\u201dViscount Roteschu stood up from his seat, looking down at Rashta with a mocking smile.\u201cYesterday, the Emperor and Empress went to the villa, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cThey must be having a good time with only the two of them there. The Empress might try to change the Emperor\u2019s feelings.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou understand that the best.\u201dHe gave an amused giggle, and winked at the cane leaning against the table.\u201cPoor little Rashta with no one to help her. If the Emperor tired of you, you will be abandoned. So think about accepting my help. I expect you to be a little more cooperative next time. \u201dHe patted her on the shoulder and whistled as he left. As soon as he was gone, Rashta hurled her mug across the room.***The anxiety Viscount Roteschu caused her only grew when Baron Lant came to her at dinner.\u201cMiss Rashta, I\u2019m afraid the Emperor may not be able to come back tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRashta was forced to swallow her steak, and she looked at Baron Lant in surprise.\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t today the Empress\u2019 birthday? Why wouldn\u2019t he come back tomorrow?\u201d\u201cThat was the original plan\u2026\u201dHe sighed.\u201cThe Emperor is sick. A man rushed here from the villa to inform us.\u201dHe didn\u2019t look optimistic about the Emperor\u2019s condition, and Rashta felt her blood drain.\u201cHis Majesty is sick\u2026\u201dHer face turned pale, and Baron Lant believed she was deeply concerned about her lover.\u201cOh no, Miss Rashta, it\u2019s not that serious. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dBut she wasn\u2019t listening to his words. Was Sovieshu really sick? Perhaps the Emperor and Empress wanted to spend more time together because they were getting along?But even if he was sick, that was still a problem. If the Empress stayed by his side and cared for him, he might forget his feelings about Rashta.\u201cMiss Rashta really loves the Emperor.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dRasta hesitated before posing a question.\u201cBaron Lant, can Rashta go to the villa? Rashta wants to look after His Majesty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Granting permission is beyond my power.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cBut the Emperor and Empress will send for you if they wish you to be there.\u201dRashta nodded nervously.The next day, however, the news became worse. Although Sovieshu was not seriously ill, his fever refused to subside and he had to stay another week longer. That was not good for her.\u2018But the Emperor and Empress were not romantic even before I became a concubine.\u2019Their relationship had been staid for years now, and she didn\u2019t reckon they would become close all of a sudden.Rashta tried to stay calm, but it didn\u2019t work. Viscount Roteschu\u2019s threats about her baby fogged her mind, and with the anxiety about the Empress thrown on top of it, her heart raced.The third day after Viscount Roteschu\u2019s visit, Duke Elgy brought up his concerns about Rashta\u2019s state.\u201cMy dear, you haven\u2019t been looking good lately. Are you alright?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it because the Emperor is sick?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dRasta hesitated before speaking carefully.\u201cRashta feels a little sorry for the Empress.\u201d\u201cWhat about Her Majesty all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s unwell, but it\u2019s the Empress who is staying in the villa to nurse him. Even when it\u2019s fine for her to come back.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cBut even if she stays, the Emperor will constantly be thinking of Rashta while he\u2019s ill\u2026\u2026Because of that Rashta feels uncomfortable.\u201dAt her morose expression, Duke Elgy snorted. Rashta widened her eyes at him. His jaw was clenched as if he were trying to hold back laughter.\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d\u201cAh, sorry. But it\u2019s a very obvious lie, Miss.\u201d\u201cNo. Tch. Rashta is serious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but when it comes to men and women, I\u2019m knowledgeable, right?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You were just so cute.\u201dHe looked at her with a thoughtful expression, and then shook his head and continued playfully.\u201cYou seem concerned that the Empress will become close to the Emperor again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about this?\u201dDuke Elgy leaned in close, and her face turned red. She couldn\u2019t resist her curiosity, however, and said \u201cWhat?\u201dWhat he said next surprised her.\u201cShall I tempt the Empress? If she loves me, she won\u2019t become close to the Emperor. Would that make you feel better?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe pulled away from her and stared at her with shining green eyes. Rashta blinked and paused for a moment, but eventually shook her head.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cWhy? I\u2019m confident.\u201d\u201cThe Empress has lived her whole life surrounded with fine things. On the contrary, she would likely be more attracted to a very ordinary man.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cBut the duke is of high birth\u2026If we were to give the Empress a lover, wouldn\u2019t an ordinary person be better?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I could be relieved now as well.\u201cThank you for coming immediately.\u201d\u201cNot at all, Your Majesty. It is only my duty.\u201dAfter the doctor and everyone else filed out of the room, I pulled over a chair to Sovieshu\u2019s bedside. He cracked open his eyes and fixed his gaze right on me, while I took a towel from a cold basin beside him, squeezed it, and placed it on his forehead. He flinched as soon as the towel touched his skin.\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re overworked.\u201d\u201cI heard. I was awake when the doctor said that.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not waste this trip to the villa.\u201dI sighed as I remembered the sudden awkward kiss Sovieshu placed on me.\u201cAre you alright? You should take a break.\u201dHe spoke brightly, but I could detect a note of tiredness. Nevertheless, I was happy he had more energy. I took the towel from his forehead, dipped it back in cold water, and placed it back on him.\u201cCold\u2026\u201dSovieshu groaned again and then murmured an apology.\u201cYour birthday was ruined because of me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWe return here every year. Don\u2019t mind about it.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but mind.\u201d\u201cThere is next year\u2019s birthday.\u201d\u201cBut your birthday is once this year\u2026huu. Talking to the Empress is like\u2026\u201d\u201cLike talking to a colleague?\u201dSovieshu pulled a face when I echoed his words.\u201cDo you know you\u2019re being somewhat unkind?\u201dSomewhat unkind? It was outright derision, I thought.\u201cThe doctor said you had to rest for a few more days. Shall I call in Rashta?\u201dSovieshu stared at me as if he couldn\u2019t believe I what I said. I meant it this time. I knew he would rather have her take care of him than me. Of course, as I didn\u2019t want the three of us to be together, I would return to the imperial palace if she came. Wasn\u2019t this what Sovieshu wanted anyway? He only needed one person.\u201cEmpress\u2026are you being sarcastic?\u201d\u201cDoes it sound that way?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI answered with a single word and looked down, while Sovieshu flicked his eyes sideways towards me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring Rashta.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be disappointed.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t this good for the Empress?\u201dExcept whenever Rashta was upset, he always blamed me. On the other hand, if Rashta came here and I returned to the palace, it would actually be helpful. I had a lot of work to catch up to.Instead of answering, I placed more ice in the bowl, then took the towel from his forehead and soaked it again. I placed the cold towel on the back of his neck, and he jumped and grabbed my wrist.\u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d\u201cAlright. Stop glaring at me.\u201dHe sighed, taking the towel off his neck and placing it on the quilt.\u201cDon\u2019t call Rashta.\u201dWas that really alright with him? When I looked up, I saw Sovieshu\u2019s eyelids drooping downwards.\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and charming when she talks, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that now. I have a headache\u2026.so I\u2019d like it to stay quiet.\u201dRashta would be upset. Ever since she became his concubine, she made sure to never be far away from Sovieshu.I simply nodded and placed the cloth back on his forehead.***My suspicion that Rashta would be upset was right. After a week\u2019s rest we returned to the imperial palace, and Rashta, who had been waiting in the garden, jumped inside the carriage before either of us could step out. Rashta locked Sovieshu into a fierce hug, while all she did for me was bow awkwardly. It was not unusual for a concubine to be seen by the empress, but her attitude was different, considering she had been overly friendly to me before. While she couldn\u2019t bear being from Sovieshu, she seemed more concerned that he was alone with me.She and Sovieshu seemed unwilling to detach themselves from each other, so I went to the central palace alone and ordered the officials to bring me all my work that I had put off.Since then, daily life continued. I spent a little more time at the central palace catching up on a week\u2019s worth of work, while Sovieshu lessened his overtime hours following the doctor\u2019s advice. Rashta still clung to Duke Elgy during the day while taking care of Sovieshu at night. I sometimes ran into Prince Heinley while going out for walks, and Queen brought back letters now and then.Ah, but there was one change. Sovieshu summoned me less to make outrageous accusations about Rashta. He\u2019s gotten back on track with affairs concerning her, and there was less reason to make demands. Thankfully I didn\u2019t run into her often anymore, and I naturally became less fatigued even though my work increased. My heart was still sorrowful when it came to Sovieshu, but after a few years like this, perhaps we could be like a normal royal couple.We would live a moderately dull but peaceful life, without the worry of abandonment or renunciation.***The next time I saw Rashta again was at a tea party hosted by Duchess Tuania.Adjacent to the central palace was a small mansion called the Crystal House. The exterior was not made of crystal, as the name suggested, but with glass arranged at various angles that made the entire house sparkle with light.I heard that in the past, a concubine that was loved by the emperor lived here. Nowadays it was mainly lent to nobles for a day or two. It was the Crystal House that Duchess Tuania borrowed to host her tea party, and today I was able to finish my work early and join her.\u201cI was afraid you were too busy to come, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dI greeted Duchess Tuania and sat down at a table in the garden. There was a selection of tea and coffee at the table, as well as a range of cookies, cakes, and other delicacies covered with glass lids. The atmosphere was turning ripe for greeting the noblemen and women.\u201cOh dear. We must be late.\u201dA voice came from the garden entrance. I looked past a cake, and saw a man with wavy blond hair I had never seen before. Next to him was Rashta, who was being escorted by him.\u2018Oh. Is that Duke Elgy?\u2019The man\u2019s eyes fell on me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Prince Heinley had warned me that Duke Elgy was like a living cursed doll or a real ghost story, it would be strange if I suddenly avoided him.It was only a brief moment, but if felt like time had slowed down as the man smiled brightly and approached me.\u201cYour Majesty. It\u2019s a pleasure to finally meet you.\u201d\u201cYou are Duke Elgy Klaudia?\u201d\u201cYou recognized me right away?\u201dIt was the first time I had met him, but he had a strikingly beautiful face that could not easily be forgotten. The man next to Rashta could only be Duke Elgy as well.The duke bent his knee and reached out his hand. I placed my hand in his, and he offered a gentle kiss before letting me go with a faint upturn of his lips. I smiled ceremoniously and looked towards Duchess Tuania. Duke Elgy was a well-known socialite, so it was unsurprising that she had invited him. What was more curious was that she had invited Rashta as well.However, as soon as I saw the look on Duchess Tuania\u2019s face, I knew that she didn\u2019t intend Rashta to be here. Duke Elgy must have brought her as his partner. The fact was evident in the subsequent conversation between Duchess Tuania and Duke Elgy.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that Duke Elgy would bring Miss Rashta.\u201d\u201cI thought bringing Rashta to a socialite party such as yours would help Rashta too. Is that alright, My Lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that a man of renown like Duke Elgy would flatter me.\u201dWhile the two were exchanging reproaches disguised as greetings, Rashta bowed to me too, while I drank my tea with a silent acknowledgment. But I could not taste the tea at all.It was because of Rashta. Her presence alone made me want to leave. However, if I was seen avoiding Rashta, it would be the social gossip among the nobles for a week. I didn\u2019t want to be spoken of in the same sentence as her, and so I was forced to stay here until a after few others had left.My worry only grew after Duke Elgy, finishing his intimate conversation with Duchess Tuania, sat opposite me with Rashta. Fortunately, she and I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to exchange words.\u201cDid you hear about Baron Riven?\u201d\u201cI heard that he wanted his bastard son to be his successor, and the baroness ended up divorcing him, right?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the baroness from the Chrome kingdom? I heard she left with their children and went back to her family.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t Baroness Riven the sister of Miss Aleisia?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing these days?\u201d\u201cI heard before New Year\u2019s\u2014\u201dBut as Duchess Tuania was talking about Aleisia\u2019s recent affairs, Rashta asked in a small voice, \u201cWho is Aleisia?\u201d The question was not directed to the duchess, but she seemed to have heard. Duchess Tuania paused, while the person sitting next to Rashta replied in a mischievous voice.\u201cShe\u2019s Rashta\u2019s predecessor.\u201d\u201cPredecessor?\u201d\u201cShe was once a concubine of the previous Emperor.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRashta widened her eyes and blinked.\u201cIf Miss Aleisia\u2019s sister is a baroness, is Miss Aleisia originally a noblewoman?\u201d\u201cYes. It was at a ball that her and the previous emperor met.\u201d\u201cSo how\u2019s Miss Aleisia doing now?\u201dIt was if the atmosphere had been doused with cold water. Everyone stopped talking and focused their attention on Rashta. Some looked at her with curiosity, others with sympathy, yet others with spite.The person who answered Rashta didn\u2019t look happy and said, \u201cWell.\u201dMiss Aleisia\u2014\u201cI heard she was forced to leave. What a pity.\u201dIt was Duke Elgy who answered, and Rashta looked sideways in surprise. He smiled as Rashta stared at him, a crumple between her brows.\u201cThe emperor quickly tired of Miss Aleisia. She had the shortest time as concubine than any other concubine. It was all over so fast\u2026\u201dSurely Duke Elgy knew that it was not a story for someone like Rashta. However, he was completely calm, and smiled as he took a sip of tea.Rashta blinked her large eyes. She had been upset when I once mentioned another concubine after her. It must have been unthinkable back then, but now she was confronted with a concubine who had taken the same road as hers and had a bad ending. Rashta was completely frozen, and some nobles turned their eyes towards her in pity.I thought Rashta would remain tight-lipped, but instead of staying silent, she quickly erased the surprise on her face and spoke, her face red.\u201cI hear that the nobles have many lovers. It seems to be true.\u201dSome jumped in to sympathize with her.\u201cThere are some couples with no other lovers.\u201d\u201cThere are not many like Countess Eliza.\u201d\u201cPolitical marriages are more the norm.\u201dRashta nodded one at each of their words and smiled back.\u201cRight, of course\u2026actually, Rashta was very surprised when she heard that the Duchess Tuania had five lovers. But now that I heard it is natural, I feel like I\u2019m going through a new world.\u201dThis time, there was a wave of silence. Everyone\u2019s mouth was open. Duchess Tuania\u2019s forked clinked down on her plate.\u201cAh.\u201dRashta turned red, covering her mouth with her hands.\u201cWas it something I shouldn\u2019t say? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something you should say, because it\u2019s ridiculous nonsense, Miss Rashta.\u201dDuchess Tuania\u2019s voice was as dangerous as thin ice. Rashta repeatedly apologized, but the duchess\u2019 face did not soften.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, My Lady. Miss Rashta is not used to the etiquette of the nobility. She\u2019s only repeating what she heard.\u201dWhen Duke Elgy sided with Rashta again, Duchess Tuania finally stood up.\u201cI find it unbearable that there are two people so rude that they cannot even observe etiquette. Especially you, Duke Elgy. If you wanted to bring someone who didn\u2019t know how to behave, you should have taught them the least bit of pretense. Rudeness is worse than pretense.\u201d\u201cOh, are you angry?\u201d\u201cYes. Today\u2019s party ends here. I\u2019m sorry to have brought you to this strange occasion, Your Majesty.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, with all her laurels and repute, even they couldn\u2019t speak ill of her. They remained quiet, but were always anxious to talk about her faults.Rashta\u2019s comments in front of Duchess Tuania yesterday afternoon had given them the ammunition they needed. Those who secretly hated the duchess gathered in Rashta\u2019s reception room to laugh and gossip.\u201cActually, Miss Rashta complained a little after hearing Duchess Tuania\u2019s words.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, does she truly have only five lovers? How many men chase after her? Are they all unrequited loves?\u201d\u201cThe duchess does get around.\u201d\u201cThe real Empress always sits quietly, while Duchess Tuania always carries her head as if she were the queen of society.\u201dTo them, Rashta was like a shield\u2014someone who could speak out plainly and badly against Duchess Tuania, but who would not be ignored by society. All they had to do was to air their catty remarks behind the shield that was Rashta.\u201cRashta only said what she heard\u2026\u201d\u201cTo be honest, the rumors have been around for a while. I couldn\u2019t speak about them because I didn\u2019t have the right words, and I was afraid of being caught by the duchess\u2019 followers.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t those followers strange too?\u201dThe nobles whispered with Rashta in the middle, and it was not until three or four hours later that they stood up.\u201cHow did Rashta do?\u201dAs soon as they left, Rashta approached Duke Elgy, who had been watching the conversation from the sidelines. He smiled, lowering his eyes.\u201cWell done, Miss.\u201dRashta twisted her body back and forth at his compliment.\u201cIt\u2019s alright?\u201d\u201cYes. Nice start.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026will people turn away from Duchess Tuania?\u201d\u201cNo, not too much at the moment.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cRight now, just this. Checking to see if there are any complaints. Stirring things up.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026then what should I do now?\u201dAs Duke Elgy looked at Rashta\u2019s naive expression, he burst into laughter and rose from his chair.\u201cYou can do it all by yourself from now on, right?\u201d\u201cRashta doesn\u2019t like this\u2014\u201d\u201cAs I said, Miss.\u201dHe approached Rashta, then leaned down and whispered in her ear.\u201cYou\u2019re cute, but I told you it\u2019s hard to deceive me in areas like this.\u201d\u201cTch.\u201dRashta shot him a look of loathing, and Duke Elgy chuckled.\u201cI\u2019m not insulting you, so don\u2019t be upset.\u201dRashta pouted and raised her eyebrows. Duke Elgy opened the door of the reception room and walked out into the hallway.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dRashta ran to his side, and he turned and shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m going out for a while. You don\u2019t have to come. I\u2019m not going for a stroll.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026wait.\u201d***About four to six times a year a massive public ball was held, an event where even commoners could attend. I was in the middle of a long conversation with the culture minister to decide on the date. He hurriedly excused himself to go the bathroom, and I stepped outside the office for a moment to relieve my fatigued eyes.\u2018I\u2019ll take a walk.\u2019I stared down the long corridor and began to walk slowly, hoping to relax. After only a few steps, however, I noticed Duke Elgy leaning on a pillar not far away. Why was he standing there? When I stopped and looked at him, he smiled and straightened himself to bow to me.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting here for three hours. You must be very busy.\u201dHis wavy, golden hair swayed with his bow. I became all the more curious\u2014he waited three hours just to see me? I tried to remember if he had a prearranged meeting with me. If it was urgent, he should have sent someone to give a report\u2026\u201cHow can I help you?\u201dDuke Elgy smiled and murmured, \u201cAh. Straight to the main point.\u201d\u201cVery good. Quick. Do you happen to know I\u2019m a friend of Heinley\u2019s?\u201d\u201cI heard.\u201d\u201cYou heard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou heard it.\u201dWhat on earth did he come here to say? Duke Elgy mumbled \u2018heard\u2019 to himself and suddenly frowned and looked down at the floor. An awkward silence passed. He stood there for about three minutes before he spoke again.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from Heinley a few times about you, Your Majesty. Did Heinley say anything about me?\u201dNot often, but once. And it wasn\u2019t flattering.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard much.\u201dI answered him honestly, and he fixed me with his gaze as he took a couple steps closer.\u201cDid he say anything strange?\u201d\u201cStrange\u2026?\u201d\u201cAnything unpleasant.\u201dHeinley did, but I couldn\u2019t answer that. I shook my head and said no, while Duke Elgy sighed and placed his hand on his forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s just the way he is. He always says bad things about me to someone he likes.\u201dPrince Heinley?\u201cHe\u2019s been telling people I\u2019m a cursed doll or a living ghost story\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lie, so there\u2019s no need for you to pay attention to it.\u201d\u201d \u2026I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re saying this to me, or your intentions.\u201d\u201cWhen I saw you yesterday, I didn\u2019t think you would socialize with people like Heinley.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person is that?\u201d\u201cThe same kind as Heinley and me. Someone who\u2019s frivolous.\u201dYesterday I had only smiled and nodded my head, and barely opened my mouth to say hello. When the tea party was cut short, I left. He had barely seen me and decided what kind of person I was from that?\u201cBut if there is a difference, Heinley is a man who wants someone to be his complete opposite, and as for me, I\u2019m a frivolous man who wants to get along with frivolous people.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m not fit to be the prince\u2019s friend?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to give you some advice.\u201dAdvice?\u201cHeinley is a two-faced man, Your Majesty. He says one thing in front of you, and does something different from behind. He can both smile and hurt people.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t trust the sweets he offers.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you Prince Heinley\u2019s close friend?\u201dWhy would Prince Heinley and Duke Elgy speak ill of each other? As soon as I spoke, Duke Elgy smiled nonchalantly.\u201cIt was Heinley who called me here in the first place. Didn\u2019t he say that?\u201dHe shook his head and continued.\u201cFor a few years Heinley\u2019s been setting up\u2014\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, there was a knock on the wall. I turned around, and saw Sovieshu staring at me and Duke Elgy.\u201cAnother foreigner again.\u201dDuke Elgy bowed at Sovieshu and left with an innocent smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A man from the Western Kingdom, another from Rwibt, and another from Blue Bohean. You clearly have a preference for foreigners, don\u2019t you?\u201dHis mad speculation returned. I had been hoping that everything would stay quiet.Sovieshu frowned and pointed at the duke\u2019s retreating back.\u201cYou don\u2019t have much experience with other men besides myself. Just because he speaks with a silver tongue it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a good man.\u201dOn the contrary, Duke Elgy was a man of blunt speech, but instead of correcting Sovieshu I looked at him dumbfoundedly.\u201cThen what kind of man is a good man?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIf he had a conscience, he would not say himself.But Sovieshu had no conscience.\u201cMe?\u201dReally?I lifted my eyebrow at him, and his expression turned disgruntled as he sighed.\u201cAnyway, I want you to be careful in your behavior.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2014\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI will look for a handsome, youthful Eastern Kingdom man.\u201dHe stared at me silently, then mumbled \u201cYes\u201d and left.I sighed. I couldn\u2019t fathom what was in Sovieshu\u2019s head. It didn\u2019t matter to him that he brought Rashta, but he didn\u2019t want to hear that the Imperial couple had other lovers?\u201cYour Majesty. Were you looking for me?\u201dAs I pressed my hand against my temple, the minister hurried over from the bathroom.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. My digestive system has been working up lately.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dWe went back into the office, but I found it difficult to concentrate, and I eventually cut the meeting short.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk again tomorrow. Let\u2019s go get some rest today.\u201d\u201cOh, very good.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t concentrate very well either, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAfter the minister left, I sat with my arms crossed and stared at the stack of documents on the table. Sovieshu was being Sovieshu\u2026But what did the Duke Elgy mean? What had Prince Heinley been setting up for years? It couldn\u2019t be a building. A plan? The word \u201cplan\u201d would make sense.\u201c\u2026\u201dI would have to ask Prince Heinley. He had called Duke Elgy here, and yet both of them were trading disparaging remarks about the other.\u2026It was strange.***\u201cYour Majesty, does this feel good?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty. Is this good?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dRashta stopped kneading Sovieshu\u2019s shoulder when he failed to answer her repeated questions. She leaned her head over his shoulder, and Sovieshu, startled, turned his head sideways, causing their lips to almost brush against each other\u2019s. Rashta smiled, lightly kissed his cheek, and hugged him.\u201cWhat are you thinking about that you won\u2019t listen to Rashta?\u201dHer voice was charming, but it contained a pout.\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s about national matters, Rashta can\u2019t help much.\u201dAfter apologizing, she shrugged her shoulders and then sat down at the table across from him. Sovieshu shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not about national matters.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRashta spoke in half absent-minded voice. Sovieshu usually didn\u2019t share his day\u2019s work with Rashta. He told her whenever he felt like it, which wasn\u2019t often, so she asked him without thinking. However, he pitched his own question.\u201cCome to think of it, Rashta. Duke Elgy gets along with you, doesn\u2019t he?\u201dDuke Elgy? Why did Sovieshu bring him up all of a sudden? Rashta replied, puzzled.\u201cHe\u2019s close to Rashta. What is it?\u201dHis next question was even more surprising.\u201cIs Duke Elgy close to the Empress?\u201dRashta winced slightly.\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d\u201cI saw the pair of them having friendly conversation this afternoon.\u201dSovieshu gave a low exhale.\u201cEarlier\u2026\u201dRashta told him that Duke Elgy had left for a while, and that she hadn\u2019t seen him for for hours.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say where he went. So he must have gone to the Empress.\u201dRashta remembered Duke Elgy\u2019s confident and playful proposal to tempt her.\u2018Is he really trying to seduce the Empress for me?\u2019Rashta silently pursed her lips.\u2018Not, not for me\u2026\u2019He must have done it for himself. She was somewhat offended, and Sovieshu noticed and called out to her in a strange voice.\u201cRashta?\u201dRashta hurriedly smiled.\u201cNo, the Empress doesn\u2019t get along with the Duke Elgy.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, Duke Elgy is a friend of Rashta\u2019s.\u201dAt her quick reply, Sovieshu smiled at her adoringly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou truly are gentle and kind.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cAre you defending the Empress just because I might misunderstand her?\u201d\u201d Oh\u2026you noticed?\u201dRashta covered her face with her hands, and Sovieshu nodded and hummed.\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing the ring I gave to you, are you?\u201d\u201cRing\u2026\u201dRashta lowered her hands. Despite her pretty face, her hands were ugly and coarse due to the hardships in her childhood. When Sovieshu had seen the roughness in her hands, his eyes trembled.Sovieshu leaned over to take Rashta\u2019s fingers.\u201cA silver ring with a red jewel in it. Do you remember?\u201d\u201cOh? Yes.\u201d\u201cThe red jewel is known as the \u2018Red Flame Star\u2019.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dRashta recalled the three rings that Sovieshu had given her. One of them must have been a silver ring with a red jewel. She thought it was the cheapest because it was the smallest, but it must have quite a reputation to have its own name.\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201dRashta\u2019s expression twisted as she realized she gave the precious ring to the person she hated the most.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to pressure you if you don\u2019t like it. But there\u2019s a spell on the jewel. The effect isn\u2019t obvious if you put it on for a short time, but wear it for longer and eventually it will remove the scars.\u201dThe ring was magical! Rashta dropped her head onto the table with a thump.\u201cRashta?\u201d\u201cOoooh\u2026what a waste.\u201dSovieshu stared at her, and she groaned into the wood.\u201cI found a poor maid and gave it to her. I didn\u2019t know it was that kind of ring\u2026\u201dAfter staring at her in short surprise, Sovieshu burst into laughter.\u201cWhat? Haha!\u201dRashta wanted to cry.\u201cYour Majesty, is there another ring with that same effect?\u201d\u201cThere is but\u2026\u201d\u201cIf Rashta asks you for another one\u2026is that alright?\u201d\u201cWell, if you want a similar one, then very well.\u201dCould she have it now? When Rashta stared at him with enormous eyes, and Sovieshu smiled awkwardly.\u201cThe Empress has one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It doesn\u2019t involve you anymore.\u201dRashta had been willing to trade for it if he still had it, and she let out a frustrated \u201cHu!\u201d\u201cI sold it for more money than I expected. I thought you gave a cheap ring on purpose, but you have done well for me.\u201dRashta\u2019s blood pressure rose even more at Viscount Roteschu\u2019s vile smile. However, the ring was out of her hands now. Sovieshu had to obtain a new one.Rashta mentally counted backwards from ten, then pointed her finger at a chair across the table.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cNo more of your impudence.\u201dRashta was uncharacteristically angry about the ring, but he wasn\u2019t intimidated.\u201cIf you are on the same side as you say, you will no longer be in the lead. Don\u2019t be so rude to Rashta.\u201dViscount Roteschu shot her an irritated look, but as Rashta took out her fan and began to cool herself, his anger subsided as he saw the jewels flashing on the fan. It wouldn\u2019t be long before he acquired those as well.Smiling in anticipation, Viscount Roteschu took his place with a screech of his chair.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re like colleagues now.\u201dRashta stared at him with a contemptuous look, but he continued.\u201cHave you made up your mind? My patience is running out.\u201d\u201cYou have to convince me first.\u201d\u201cWith what?\u201d\u201cYou said you would help Rashta. Whether you\u2019re truly helping or not, show your ability.\u201d\u201cAbility?\u201dRashta snapped the fan into her palm.\u201cYou said you would reveal my baby if I didn\u2019t cooperate. But if you ruin our arrangement even when we\u2019re on the same side, it would still be a loss for you. So you have to at least show me your ability.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026So what kind of skills do you want to see?\u201d\u201cFind out a weakness of Duchess Tuania\u2019s. Something that could start a bad rumor.\u201d***I had dinner twice a week with Sovieshu, and that was today. I recalled our unpleasant conversation yesterday, but I couldn\u2019t avoid him. I changed from my diplomatic clothing into a comfortable light blue dress and headed towards the eastern palace. To avoid any awkward conversations, I carefully ran over the words I wanted to say.As I walked down the hall towards the room where I would have my meal, I ran into Rashta. The aftermath of the villa was still unchanged, and Rashta bowed carefully and stepped aside.\u201cI\u2019m glad you aren\u2019t pretending to be friendly and calling me \u2018sister\u2019 anymore.\u201dThis distance was acceptable to me. I took a few steps past her when she spoke.\u201cExcuse me\u2026Your Majesty.\u201dRashta quietly called to me from behind. I stopped and turned around, but she hesitated.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dIt was as if Rashta\u2019s words were caught in her throat. What was she trying to say? With a frown, she slowly began to speak.\u201cYour Majesty has Prince Heinley. A close friend.\u201dWhy was she talking about Prince Heinley all of a sudden? She once claimed that she was his letter acquaintance. Was she trying to pull something again?However, what Rashta said next took me by surprise.\u201cSo please don\u2019t touch Duke Elgy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhy would I bother with him?\u2018She thinks I would touch Duke Elgy?\u2019An exhale escaped from my mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cWhen I was in trouble, he was the only one on my side who listened to me and trusted me.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026don\u2019t be offended. Your Majesty, you have so many friends, so please don\u2019t take my only one\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t. \u201dI didn\u2019t know why she misunderstood me, but the idea was completely ridiculous and I immediately cut it down.\u201cI don\u2019t know why this concerns you, but do not worry. Duke Elgy is not my friend.\u201dRashta smiled in visible relief.\u201cAs it\u2019s said.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve coveted what was mine, but I haven\u2019t coveted what was yours. I\u2019m not so deprived that I have to take from someone else.\u201d\u201c!\u201dA look of distress flashed on Rashta\u2019s face, but I ignored it. I brushed past her with a look as cold as Sovieshu\u2019s.***When I entered Sovieshu\u2019s room, his secretary, Count Pirnu, was already inside. I was unsure if they were deep in a long conversation, but Sovieshu was sitting in front of the table while Count Pirnu was standing beside him. I saw quietly opposite of Sovieshu, thinking that the count would leave soon given that he already had his hat in hand. Sovieshu wouldn\u2019t have allowed him to come here in the first place if he didn\u2019t mind being overheard.\u201cA ring with healing magic, correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre necklaces, bracelets, and swords acceptable?\u201d\u201cNo. It should be a ring. No, no. A bracelet is fine, too.\u201d\u201cVery well. They\u2019re extremely rare, and the search will be very wide.\u201d\u201cFind one anyway, and as soon as you do, buy it.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dCount Pirnu gave a low bow to Sovieshu and I, then left the room with the close of the door. Sovieshu smiled in my direction and rang a bell to summon the servants. They had been waiting beforehand, and immediately brought in a lavish dinner of grilled goose skewers, stew, and bread with cheese. After the servants left, I directed the conversation to the scene from earlier.\u201cDon\u2019t you already have a ring with a healing spell, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026yes. But I don\u2019t have it now.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to want to tell me why it was gone. Instead of questioning him further, I ate a spoonful of stew. I thought I was relieved to find a topic of conversation, but now I was at a complete blank. The room lie in complete silence, as we had been taught at an early age to not make loud sounds with our untensils against the dishes.Only after emptying his bowl of stew did Sovieshu speak.\u201cEmpress, if you don\u2019t mind, can you lend me the Desert Flower until I find a new ring?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Desert Flower (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe \u201cDesert Flower\u201d was my ring, obtained from a trader who returned from Rwibt. It had been handed down through the generations by the desert tribe\u2019s greatest warriors, and also contained a powerful healing spell. I didn\u2019t use it much, so I didn\u2019t mind lending it to him\u2026However, my gaze unknowingly turned to Sovieshu\u2019s smooth hands. It had neither a scratch nor scar.\u201cDo you truly need it?\u201dSovieshu answered bluntly.\u201cI just want to lend it to someone who has injured hands.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cLet me borrow the ring, and I promise to return it.\u201d\u201cRashta\u2019s hands must be rough.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s eyes widened. I set my fork down, then wiped my mouth with a napkin and smiled at him.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to use it on yourself. You can\u2019t lend it to other nobles out of the blue, and you can\u2019t sell anything you borrow. You\u2019re certain that you can get it back. Surely the person you want to give it to must be Rashta.\u201dSovieshu stared at me in silence, then sheepishly placed his forehead in his hand. He gave a long sigh.\u201cWon\u2019t you lend it to me?\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHowever, there is a condition.\u201d\u201cA condition\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease lend me one of your magical items as collateral.\u201dSovieshu gave a shocked laugh.\u201cDo you think I will not return it?\u201d\u201cNo. But I may have a person I want to lend it to.\u201d\u201cTo lend it to\u2026Who?\u201d\u201cDid you not tell me yesterday? You didn\u2019t want me to associate with foreigners, so I will look at our young countrymen instead.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cSo, you will lend the Emperor\u2019s items to a young countryman?\u201dI nodded my head and coolly took a sip of my water. It was a lie, but if he was going to take my ring, I needed security. Sovieshu threw me a dirty look and stood up.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to lend it to me, just say no. I\u2019ll pretend this didn\u2019t happen.\u201d***I couldn\u2019t finish my bowl of stew after that, but I was still hungry.\u2018I\u2019ll have to ask Countess Eliza for some ice cream.\u2019I would feel a little better after I ate. Perhaps it was satisfaction from Sovieshu\u2019s twisted expression, but my stomach felt less upset than when he accused me of spreading rumors about Rashta being a runaway slave or when he thought I brought Viscount Roteschu.I was walking through the Western Palace when I spotted a couple of figures.\u201cPrince Heinley? Queen?\u201dPrince Heinley was standing and holding Queen. My heart lifted as I approached them, but I discovered that I was mistaken.\u201cThat is not Queen, is it?\u201dThe bird was a little smaller than Queen, and his feathers were blue instead of gold. Its face was completely different as well.\u201cThis is Queen\u2019s underling.\u201d\u201cUnderling? Not his friend?\u201d\u201cHe is his friend, but officially he\u2019s an underling.\u201dPrince Heinley smiled as he patted the bird\u2019s heard. The bird made a disgruntled expression, and I chuckled.\u201cPrince Heinley\u2019s birds are all very expressive.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cQueen has a surprised face, a sad face, and a shy face.\u201dI reached out and touched the bird\u2019s head. He, too, was very gentle in nature and remained still, even though he was being touched by a stranger.\u201cHe has a grumpy face.\u201d\u201cHe always looks like this. He always has a face like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019\u201dAt the end of Prince Heinley\u2019s words the bird turned even sulkier, but the bird was so cute that I kept stroking him.\u201cCan I hold him?\u201dI assumed I could, but Prince Heinley answered with surprising firmness.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hold him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem willing to explain further, and I nodded.\u2018I would also like to raise a bird of my own\u2026\u2019The bird looked so pitiful that I touched its neck, and Prince Heinley suddenly stepped back. When I looked up, he smiled softly.\u201cI think the bird is anxious to go back to the room.\u201d\u201c\u2026He looks calm.\u201d\u201cHis heart is beating louder. He\u2019s actually a shy and cowardly creature, unlike the brave Queen.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if the blue bird was a coward, but he was certainly glowering at Prince Heinley. Instead of deigning the prince with his displeasure, however, the bird stood up and wearily flew away.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a spiritless bird.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s always like that.\u201d\u201cIs he sick?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s just complaining.\u201d\u201cComplaining? What for?\u201d\u201cHm, indeed. Am I in trouble because I stopped the Empress from giving him a hug?\u201dI didn\u2019t know if he was talking to himself or asking me. Prince Heinley had an unusual look on his face as he stared at the bird\u2019s back with his arms folded. Then, as if he felt my gaze on him, he turned and smiled at me.\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask him later why he\u2019s angry.\u201d\u201cCan you talk to birds?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s probably angry because I stopped the Empress from hugging him, and he\u2019s going to hit me ten times on the rear.\u201dI burst out laughing.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cOh, I was reminded of Queen.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI sometimes pat Queen on the rear.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cHe has a cute behind.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026thank you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhy was Prince Heinley so red? I looked at him quizzically, but his eyes refused to meet mine.Ah. Was it because I was so plainly talking about rears? With a face that red, he really wasn\u2019t a playboy as the rumors suggested.\u2018He is surprisingly pure.\u2019I thought he would laugh, but I didn\u2019t continue because he was so embarrassed. I quickly changed the subject.\u201cI remembered I wanted to ask you something, Prince Heinley.\u201dPrince Heinley looked at me with one hand covering his flamed cheek.\u201cYes. Ask me, Queen.\u201d\u201cI met Duke Elgy yesterday\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. I see.\u201dHe frowned as if he disapproved of the encounter.\u201cDid he disrespect you?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d\u201cThat is a blessing.\u201d\u201cInstead he said something strange\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s expression was tense.\u2018I\u2019m not sure I can tell him the bad names, can I? Duke Elgy said he was a frivolous man.\u2019While Duke Elgy and Prince Heinley were best friends in name, I doubted that relationship right now. Instead, I asked about something else.\u201cHe said it was you who called him here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cHe also said you\u2019ve been setting up something for years.\u201d\u201c!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What is it?\u201dPrince Heinley looked surprised. He didn\u2019t answer, and closed his mouth and looked downward. When I saw his calm face, I remembered my first impression of Prince Heinley.\u2018That\u2019s right. He only smiled after we were acquainted. Before, I thought he seemed cold.\u2019Even if he may have just been thinking, the mood was chilling.\u201cI\u2026\u201dIt was not long before Prince Heinley looked up at me and spoke, his expression softened.\u201cQueen, I don\u2019t want to lie to you.\u201dHis answer had many implications. Good and bad.\u201cYes.\u201dOn the good side, he was proving how serious his friendship was. He didn\u2019t make excuses when the other option was riskier.On the bad side\u2026he was up to something, and he couldn\u2019t tell me. It crossed my mind that whatever it was could be personal or contain confidential information of his country. But there was likelihood that the plan involved bringing Duke Elgy into the Eastern Empire\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer if you can\u2019t.\u201dI smiled and spoke in a casual tone, and Prince Heinley stared at me with nervous eyes and sighed.***McKenna leaned against the wall of the drawing room as he waited for the prince to return. He had a mind to complain to Prince Heinley for calling him a foolish bird in front of the foreign empress. He was most definitely not a foolish bird. He sulked even more as he remembered how Prince Heinley told him to play a pet bird.However, McKenna\u2019s mood changed when the prince entered the room and collapsed onto the couch.\u201cYour Highness? Are you alright?\u201dMcKenna wasn\u2019t worried, not initially. He knew how strong Prince Heinley was, and it wasn\u2019t often he had to be concerned about him. However, Prince Heinley unexpectedly waved his hand away.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dMcKenna leaned down to peer at him carefully. McKenna was the one that had been forced to play as a pet bird in front of the Empress, but it was Prince Heinley who had a look of defeat.\u2018Did it not work out as he thought?\u2019\u201cYour Highness, did the Empress say anything bad?\u201dMcKenna placed his hand on Prince Heinley\u2019s shoulder, but the prince shrugged it off. There was no anger in his face over what had happened. McKenna was starting to worry a little.\u201cDid you hear anything bad?\u201d\u201cWell, McKenna.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI\u2014\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m listening. Speak.\u201d\u201cI think I like her more than I thought.\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s reply, however, was a complete nonsense. McKenna frowned.\u201cWhat?\u201dPrince Heinley buried his face in his hands and gave a shuddering breath.\u201cI think I made a slip of the tongue.\u201d\u201cA slip of the tongue? In front of the Empress?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMcKenna was more puzzled by his answer.\u201cWhat did you say that made you sad?\u201d\u201cWhat if she\u2019s wary of me now?\u201d\u201cWary?\u201d\u201cStudying me with those sharp eyes\u2026aah.\u201dThe prince stood up from the couch and fell into his bed with a groan. He had rambled incoherently at all of McKenna\u2019s questions, and the knight looked at Prince Heinley in surprise.\u201cDid she find out you can change into a bird?\u201d\u201cNot that.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cSomething else.\u201d***Although I considered Prince Heinley a good person and a good friend, even differences could cause good people to become enemies. However, being an enemy did not necessarily mean being a bad person\u2014it only meant that they stood opposite of me.As soon as I returned to my room, I summoned Sir Artina to give him a mission.\u201cSir Artina. There is something I want you to look into. Be discreet.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. What is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about Prince Heinley and Duke Elgy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSir Artina, who knew Prince Heinley was the owner of Queen, looked at me in surprise. He seemed to think it strange that I wanted to investigate someone I was already sending letters to.\u201cDuke Elgy is understandable\u2026but Prince Heinley as well?\u201d\u201cYes. I want you to focus on their activities before New Year\u2019s, before they came here to the Imperial Palace.\u201dSir Artina looked suspicious, but he was a model knight. Instead of questioning me, he gave a short \u201cYes\u201d and left the room. Afterwards, I walked towards the window and leaned my head against the frame.The Western Kingdom was the Eastern Empire\u2019s most powerful rival, but they were neither too distant or too close. In the meantime, what could Prince Heinley do by bringing in Duke Elgy?***I remained busy for the next five days. The public ball was to be held a month earlier than last year in exchange for a generous sum paid by Grand Duke Lilteang, and the relevant documents had been approved and distributed.There was also good news. For the first time, a child from a state-sponsored orphanage earned a scholarship to attend the academy of magic. It was imperative to nurture magical talent. No matter how much one spent, magic was a priceless talent.As a symbolic gesture, the officials recommended that someone in the Imperial Family should present the scholarship, and I was willing to assume the role. I didn\u2019t remember all the children raised at the orphanage, but I did know a fair number of them, especially the child who was chosen. I was happy to do the honor of congratulating them. However, the trip would take more than a day, and so I visited Sovieshu\u2019s office to consult him. I found him sitting at his desk, turning over a small ring in his hands.\u201cI thought you lost it?\u201dThe Red Flame ring, which Sovieshu said was gone, was right before his eyes. I stared at him in puzzlement, and he smiled.\u201cYes. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cDid you find it?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I found it.\u201d\u201c?\u201dSovieshu set down the ring on his desk.\u201cI gave this ring to Rashta, but she said she felt sorry for a poor maid and gave it to her.\u201d\u201d \u2026The Red Flame ring?\u201d\u201cI suppose she didn\u2019t know about the spell. When I told her about it, she was upset.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s voice turned fond, and he continued.\u201cI asked Count Pirnu to look for a ring that had a similar property. You remember that from a few days ago, right?\u201d\u201cI remember.\u201d\u201cAnd Count Pirnu gave this to me today. He bought it from an auction last night, not realizing that it was already mine\u2026\u201dHe smiled faintly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI wasn\u2019t impressed at all, but I was still obliged to answer. Sovieshu tucked the ring inside his breast pocket. I thought my answer was too brief, so I spoke further.\u201cIf the maid was poor, she likely needed the money and sold it.\u201d\u201cI agree. But information about jewelry, especially magical items, is difficult to find. The average person would not know to sell it for its full price. I told Count Pirnu to find out how much the woman who sold the ring received.\u201dThe corners of Sovieshu\u2019s mouth lifted in pride.\u201cRashta is kindhearted. I want to make sure her good deed was done properly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You won\u2019t even serve me tea?\u201d\u201cNo. And I didn\u2019t send her away because of you.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201dRashta did not reply. She didn\u2019t want to tell Viscount Roteschu that she didn\u2019t trust Viscountess Verdi.\u201cHm. You don\u2019t want to say.\u201dViscount Roteschu seated himself comfortably in a chair and smiled.\u201cSpeak quickly. Have you found anything useful?\u201d\u201cIndeed. It was not that hushed, so the information wasn\u2019t hard to find.\u201d\u201cWhat information?\u201dRashta waited in anticipation for his answer. Viscount Roteschu grinned and pulled a gossip magazine from his bag.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dRashta took out the gossip magazine and unfolded it. It was dated from twenty years ago.\u201cRead it.\u201dThe magazine included topics on trendy designers, fashionable hat shops, popular actors, weddings that month, and restaurants. Although the fashion was two decades old, Rashta was still dazzled by the pictures.Why was she looking at this? She flipped the pages with a frown. With her limited reading ability she could only glean some information through the pictures or simple words, but she couldn\u2019t tell what Viscount Roteschu was talking about. Annoyed, she set down the magazine and stared at the viscount, who gave an \u201cOh\u201d and took the magazine away.\u201cI thought the Emperor taught you everything.\u201dHe smiled as if to reassure her that he was not making fun of her, and pointed to a section of the magazine.\u201cNian, a beautiful young lady; Marquis Tuania, who devoted himself to the Church; and Lord Ren\u00e9, Nian\u2019s fianc\u00e9. This is the most talked about story here.\u201dRashta frowned.\u201cI told you to find information about the Duchess, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cHere, Lady Nian is now Duchess Tuania.\u201dViscount Roteschu explained with a click of his tongue.\u201cYou think she was a duchess from birth?\u201d\u201cThen is Marquis Tuania the Duke Tuania now?\u201d\u201cThe man we call the Marquis Tuania here is the eldest son of the Duke Tuania at the time. Now everyone calls him \u2018Lord Marian\u2019.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cAt the time, the successor was this man. But now Nian\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Ren\u00e9, is Duke Tuania. \u201d\u201cI\u2019ll speak of them with their current titles, as it\u2019s confusing. Lord Marian fell in love with his younger brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Duchess Tuania.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in the gossip pages, but it\u2019s true. He even chased after her and they had a good relationship. But when the Duchess Tuania finally married Duke Tuania, Lord Marian was completely shocked, and he gave up his inheritance and went into the Church.\u201dRashta opened her eyes wide.\u201cWhy give up everything?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. The problem was, Lord Marian committed suicide within a week of entering the Church. Since then the Duchess has had the reputation of a femme fatale. The gossip was all ablaze.\u201dRashta\u2019s gazed at the magazine with keen interest.\u201cThis is the duchess\u2019 weakness, isn\u2019t it? People wondered if she killed him.\u201d\u201cThere were more rumors after that, but there isn\u2019t any more information because the publisher went out of business.\u201d\u201cMore rumors\u2026?\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania had a baby seven months after she married the duke. The duchess claimed the baby was born prematurely, but people said the baby looked like Lord Marian\u2019s.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cAt the time, the father-in-law, Duke Tuania, was so angry that he drove not only the journalists out of business, but publisher as well.\u201dRashta swallowed hard. This was it.The rumor could be reignited, and the role as the chewbone of society would pass over to Duchess Tuania.\u201cHow do you like it?\u201dViscount Roteschu looked on with a smile. Rashta nodded and took some jewelry from her jewelry box and handed it to Viscount Roteschu, who accepted it with glee.\u201cWell?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more I want you to do.\u201d\u201cMore?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re on my side, you have to keep working.\u201dRashta placed another jewel in Viscount Roteschu\u2019s hand.\u201cYou said Lord Marian killed himself in the church, did you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBuy the people around the church and spread this story.\u201d\u201cStory?\u201d\u201cBefore Lord Marian died, a beautiful woman visited the church several times.\u201d\u201cHmm. It may seem obvious that someone\u2019s trying to attack Duchess Tuania. Will such rumors be enough?\u201dRashta raised her eyebrows and laughed.\u201cIt will be enough.\u201dRashta remembered Duchess Tuania at the ball. There was another man around her that was always staring at the duchess with a darkened expression.\u2018That man is a duke.\u2019Although many would side with the duchess, if someone with a similar status expressed doubt, it would certainly fracture opinions.After Viscount Roteschu left, Rashta nervously paced the room in excitement. She could now pass her suffering to someone else. Duchess Tuania was highly visible in high society, and so when the gossip broke, everyone would talk about it.\u2018By then, the rumor will disappear that I was a runaway slave.\u2019Rashta chewed on her lower lip and sank onto the couch. As soon as this was sorted out, she needed to find out about the baby\u2026and that was not something she could trust Viscount Roteschu on.\u2018It would be even more difficult if I chose the wrong person. Isn\u2019t there anyone I can trust?\u2019***\u2018Strange\u2026\u2019Count Pirnu walked down the corridor and tilted his head in deep thought. The more he puzzled over it, the less he understood. Then, at the intersection where the central palace and the western palace met, he almost ran into the subject of his thoughts.\u201cOops. My apologies, Count.\u201dViscount Roteschu was quick to leave with a smile and apology, as if he knew Count Pirnu\u2019s face. Count Pirnu looked behind him. The viscount\u2019s step had a lightness to it.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dCount Pirnu stared briefly at the back of his head, then headed straight to the Emperor\u2019s office. As usual, the Emperor was laboring under a mountain of paperwork, but soon as Count Pirnu came in, the Emperor looked up.\u201cAh, Count. Have you found it? How much did the maid pay for?\u201dIt was two days ago when Count Pirnu informed the Emperor of the Red Flame Star he had bought at the auction house. The count had sought information from the auction house, but the person who put the ring in the market had gone to another region, and it had taken two days to track him down.Count Pirnu approached the Emperor with a serious expression.\u201cYour Majesty, I heard the ring was paid its proper worth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d\u201cBut there is something strange.\u201d\u201cStrange?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026the merchant said the person who sold him the ring was not a maid.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cIt was Viscount Roteschu.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It had once brimmed with jewels from the Emperor, but now she could see to the bottom of the box. Rashta covered her face with her hands and sighed.\u2018It\u2019s all Viscount Roteschu\u2019s fault.\u2019Had it been more than a month since she became concubine? There were still some remaining gifts from Sovieshu and foreign nobles. She heard that an allowance was paid by the imperial family to maintain her standard of living, but nothing had come into her hands yet. All her jewels were lost to Viscount Roteschu, and she couldn\u2019t ask the Emperor for more. Slaves only owned personal items if it was given to them by their masters or lovers, but the nobles that Rashta saw did not like to be openly asked for gifts, no matter how wealthy they were. While they used their power to approach Rashta, she wanted to be immune to their riches. It was a double-edged sword, and she thought the Emperor wouldn\u2019t be any different.\u2018If I can only figure out if the baby Viscount Roteschu has isn\u2019t mine, I won\u2019t have to be dragged around like this.\u2019Rashta sighed and set the lid back on the old jewelry box. Then, she heard the door to the parlor room click open, and she hastily shoved the jewelry box back into the drawer and closed it. As soon as she straightened up, someone knocked on her bedroom door.\u201cYes.\u201dRashta quickly strode over to open the door.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dIt was Sovieshu. Rashta leapt at him and nuzzled him with her cheek in greeting. However, instead of hugging her back as he usually did, he pushed her away.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dHer heart sank as she saw the dark expression on his face. Did she say something wrong?\u201cRashta, I need to ask you something.\u201d\u201cWh-what? \u201dRashta stamped down on her nervousness and smiled at him cutely.\u201cIt\u2019s about the ring.\u201d\u201cRing\u2026\u201d\u201cThe ring with the red jewel.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you gave it to a maid?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking all of a sudden\u2026?\u201d\u201cI have a question.\u201dRashta\u2019s heart hammered in her chest as she looked at Sovieshu\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t look angry, but he wasn\u2019t smiling either. If he already thought that she gave the ring to the maid, why was he asking about it now? Did he find out something? Did he discover that she gave it to the viscount? Perhaps he wanted to ask the maid to return the ring. In any case, all options were disastrous.If he was going to ask, this was her last chance\u2014her last chance to tell a lie. Rashta decided it would be better to be somewhat truthful.\u201cWell\u2026actually, I didn\u2019t only give a ring to a maid, Your Majesty.\u201dHis eyes widened.\u201cYou gave rings to several people?\u201d\u201cTwo people. One was a maid, and\u2026well, the other was Viscount Roteschu.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s forehead creased. Seeing his expression, Rashta knew that she had made the right choice. She didn\u2019t know how, but Sovieshu had come here knowing that Viscount Roteschu had the ring.She sighed deeply and clasped her hands together.\u201cAll the rings looked similar to me\u2026In truth, I don\u2019t know if the person who took the ring you\u2019re talking about is Viscount Roteschu or the maid.\u201d\u201cWhy did you say you gave it only to the maid?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I think you would be upset if I told you I gave a ring to Viscount Roteschu.\u201d\u201cIndeed. I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s face was stern, and Rashta quickly grabbed his forearm and hugged it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty. But I really wanted to repay him for lying for me.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t lie for you. He was only taking responsibility for what he said.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. There\u2019s no need to thank him.\u201dHe cast a doubtful eye on Rashta.\u201cYou didn\u2019t just give it out of gratitude, did you? Were you threatened?\u201d\u201cOh no. What could Rashta be threatened with?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe rumors about slavery had already spread. It\u2019s not really like that, Your Majesty.\u201dShe wished she could tell him she was being threatened, but desperation forced her to lie. If Sovieshu knew that Viscount Roteschu was blackmailing her, Sovieshu would surely punish the viscount, who in turn would tell Sovieshu about the baby and drag Rashta down with him.\u201cIf you say so, then I believe you\u2026\u201dSovieshu lowered his eyes and gently placed his hand on Rashta\u2019s cheek.\u201cIf he\u2019s threatening you, Rashta, don\u2019t give him anything and let me know. Do you understand?\u201dRashta nodded quickly.\u201cI will.\u201dHowever, Sovieshu still looked apprehensive.\u201cThat is an order, Rashta. No, I\u2019d better check every day for now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhen your allowance payments come in, I\u2019ll leave it to Baron Lant to manage it until you are able to do it yourself.\u201dRashta paled. She could not give Viscount Roteschu money or jewelry if Sovieshu was watching her finances. And when it came to that\u2026\u2018No! He\u2019ll spread the story about the baby!\u2019***Wirwol was known as a magical city, but despite its prestige, it was located deep in a mountain valley. It was surrounded on all sides by mountains, and there were two magnificent buildings on the eastern and western parts of the city. The magical academy on the eastern side was my stop for today. I was here to honor the first student admitted from the orphanage I sponsored.\u201cCongratulations.\u201dI hugged the girl I met at the dean\u2019s office, and the red-faced child replied in a scarcely audible voice.\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dI was worried because she wouldn\u2019t be able to socialize with her friends when she left the orphanage, but I was proud that she came this far, and hugged and patted her on the back. She completely froze. Finally, the girl bowed and left, and the dean of the academy gave a chuckle.\u201cShe is a good girl and has many talents.\u201d\u201cYes. I look forward to it.\u201dAfter discussing the child\u2019s sponsorship in more detail, the dean offered to give me a tour of the school. Wirwol was near the border, but it was still territory of the great Eastern Empire, and so he gave special consideration to me.\u201cI\u2019m worried because the number of mages these days keeps decreasing.\u201d\u201cWe received a similar report. Do you know the cause yet?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been researching everywhere, but the rate of magical expression has been going down.\u201d\u201cThe more mages there are, the more can that be recruited into our national defense.\u201dAs we walked along a long stone corridor, I saw a freestanding wall that was not connected to the others. Hanging on the wall were several portraits.\u201cThese are\u2026\u201dI walked closed and looked at it, and the dean explained.\u201cPortraits of the academy\u2019s top graduates.\u201dAh, yes. The most recent portrait was that of Duke Kapmen. On closer examination, there was also a portrait of the current dean as a young man as well.But there was something strange.\u201cWhy is this frame empty?\u201dOne portrait bore no image. I looked at it curiously, and the dean was somewhat flustered as he replied.\u201cIt was left blank because someone who came through the exchange program took the top spot for a while. They weren\u2019t a regular student.\u201d\u201cThey weren\u2019t from the academy, but they were at the top? That\u2019s fantastic. Who was it?\u201dI was surprised to have not heard this achievement. The dean replied in a quiet voice.\u201cPrince Heinley of the Western Kingdom.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If that was the case, then rumors should have spread\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve never heard this before.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something the academy is proud of.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dWell, that was a shame.\u201cPrince Heinley had made a special request, as a matter of fact.\u201d\u201cWhat did he ask for?\u201d\u201cHe said not to tell other people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut the dean just revealed it to me?

Prince Heinley visited just yesterday.\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley?\u201dI was sure he was still in the palace when I left yesterday\u2026although I couldn\u2019t have known when he would have left.\u201cYes, he arrived here out of the blue. He came here to enjoy himself, and he said if a guest came by and asked about the empty frame, it was alright to answer.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe timing was too coincidental, but I passed it over. Rather, the discovery that I found more concerning was that Prince Heinley could use magic.Prince Heinley\u2026according to Duke Elgy, he had been planning something for years. If he really could use magic, there was a possibility I wouldn\u2019t be able to find out what it was, as mages were so rare that the field hadn\u2019t been studied extensively.After finishing the tour around the academy, the dean saw me off at the main gates. To my surprise, I saw Prince Heinley walking this way with his blue-haired knight. The prince\u2019s expression turned surprise as he spotted me, and he turned to my direction.\u201cQueen? Oh my goodness. You\u2019re here.\u201dPrince Heinley approached me with a radiant smile. The prince\u2019s knight, in contrast, looked very unhappy. It seemed directed towards Prince Heinley, as if he had heard something unpleasant from him. The knight shook his head, only to replace his expression with professional solemnity when he saw me. Meanwhile, Prince Heinley kept smiling.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a coincidence, Queen?\u201d\u201cIt is. I didn\u2019t expect to meet you here, Prince Heinley.\u201d\u201cI have some business here.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. And while we didn\u2019t plan this encounter at all, our meeting seemed to have been fated.\u201dHis talk about fate seemed a bit exaggerated, but I smiled as I enjoyed his unexpected appearance as well.\u201cMay I ask you what you\u2019re here for?\u201d\u201cThe dean wanted to see me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe dean told me that Prince Heinley visited unexpectedly. However, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to contradict and embarrass the smiling prince. Oh\u2026was this part of Prince Heinley\u2019s plan?While I contemplated this, Prince Heinley spoke in a careful voice.\u201cThis was meant to be. Would you like to have dinner with me, Queen?\u201dI didn\u2019t have anything else on my schedule, and so I agreed.\u201cYes.\u201d***\u201cIt\u2019s a drink made from apples and honey. Do you like sweets?\u201d\u201cIn moderation.\u201d\u201cThen it will suit you.\u201dPrince Heinley had brought me to what he said was his favorite restaurant, and he recommended me various food and drinks from the menu.\u201cHave you ever had soup made with beer?\u201d\u201cOnce?\u201d\u201cThis is a specialty here. It\u2019s the best. I recommend it.\u201d\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not to my taste?\u201d\u201cThen you can hit me.\u201dHe smiled and pretended to strike himself on the forehead, then called the waiter to order our food. The knights that accompanied Prince Heinley and I were seated a few tables away.The waiter quickly set down an appetizer of fried bread. I delicately tore the bread with my fingers, then looked up to see Prince Heinley smiling at me instead of eating. However, I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable by his gaze. I wondered if he was planning anything that was harmful to the Eastern Empire, although I was doubtful.\u201cI\u2019ve always had this thought.\u201d\u201cSay it, Queen.\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley looks a lot like \u2018Queen.\u2019\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, with the blond hair and purple eyes.\u201dBoth man and bird were very handsome as well, but I wouldn\u2019t say that. Prince Heinley\u2019s mouth tipped into a smile, and he leaned over towards me.\u201cTake a close look. Is is true? Do I look like a bird?\u201dI looked into his deep purple eyes, and realized why his stare did not make me feel uncomfortable. It was because his eyes were so mesmerizingly beautiful.\u201cYour eyes are very beautiful. Did you know that?\u201dMeanwhile, Prince Heinley expressed a thought similar to my own. He smiled and murmured, \u201cThey truly are\u201d before leaning back into his seat.\u201cDo you always compliment women like this?\u201d\u201cDoes the Queen always bewitch people like this? With your eyes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an exaggeration.\u201d\u201cI know. It was a difficult question, so I just said whatever came to mind.\u201dA moment later, the waiter brought a small cart loaded with our plates of food. I nervously brushed the skirt of my dressed as the waiter set the plates on the table, and as soon as he stepped away, I addressed Prince Heinley again.\u201cI hear you are very good at magic.\u201dI wanted to ask him before, but I feared of appearing too straightforward.Prince Heinley smiled sheepishly as he pushed an amber drink in front of me.\u201cYou must have heard from the dean. Yes, a little.\u201d\u201cYou were a top student.\u201d\u201cWhat, did he tell you that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know much about magic, but I do know that each mage has different skills. Is that right?\u201d\u201cI may never be able to do the magic my opponents do, but my opponents would never able to do my magic either.\u201dI asked my next question as casually as I could.\u201cWhat is your specialty, Prince Heinley?\u201dSome liked to boast about their magic in excess, while others hid it completely. It was not a question I expected Prince Heinley to answer, but if he did, it would be easier to guess whether his plan involved magical power. In addition, depending on what his magical ability was, I might have to stop Sir Artina from investigating him in case of discovery.Prince Heinley hummed and then softly chuckled.\u201cI\u2019ll just say\u2014flying in the sky.\u201d\u201cFlying? That\u2019s wonderful! Can you take someone else with you?\u201d\u201cIt depends on who it is.\u201d\u201cHow about me? Can you take me?\u201dI said it half-jokingly, but I wanted to find out more about his abilities. I didn\u2019t expect him to take me and fly away, but I wanted to know what he was capable of.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dPrince Heinley mumbled and avoided my eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re kind of, uh, heavy for me to carry, Queen.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cOh, please don\u2019t misunderstand. I don\u2019t mean that you\u2019re heavy, I mean that you\u2019re heavy if I have to carry you in the sky.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cAre you angry?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not saying much. You look upset\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was evening when I finally arrived.\u201cI\u2019ve added rose-scented bath salts to help relieve your fatigue, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dTo my gratitude, Countess Eliza had timed the preparation of my bath with my arrival. I dipped my foot into the hot water, then felt a tingling sensation as I gradually submerged myself.\u201cHow was your trip to Wirwol, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cIt was quite enjoyable.\u201d\u201cThank goodness. I was worried because it was such a short schedule.\u201d\u201cWhat happened here while I was gone?\u201dMy muscles slackened in the warm water and I began to feel drowsy. Countess Eliza poured water over my shoulders as I tried to chase away sleep, but my eyelids felt heavy.\u201cOh\u2026don\u2019t even ask. It was very noisy.\u201d\u201cNoisy?\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania and a young noblewoman fought. There was even hair-pulling involved.\u201dAny thought of sleep shattered as I turned around in amazement. I was wide awake. Who fought with who? Hair-pulling?\u201cDuchess Tuania?\u201d\u201cDuke Elgy rented an entire opera house and held a surprise party. Almost every important socialite went.\u201d\u201cWas Duchess Tuania invited? \u201d\u201cYes. But during the party, I saw the Duchess Tuania and Duke Elgy talking with each other on the balcony.\u201dI remembered their previous conflict at Duchess Tuania\u2019s tea party. Did Duke Elgy apologize to her?\u201cThey were the most popular man and woman, and everyone was wondering what they were talking about. The first person who left the balcony was Duke Elgy.\u201d\u201cWas Miss Rashta around?\u201dLaura cut into the conversation.\u201cRashta was invited, but she was talking to Grand Duke Lilteang at the time.\u201dMost of my ladies-in-waiting seemed to have been there. Countess Eliza sighed heavily and continued.\u201cThen, someone asked Duke Elgy how attractive he thought Duchess Tuania was.\u201d\u201cDid he say anything negative?\u201d\u201cI heard him say he could see why so many men fell in love with the duchess.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened afterwards. Later, there was a commotion when Duchess Tuania had slapped Duke Elgy on the cheek. In front of so many people, too.\u201dLaura was pacing as if she was impatient to speak, and eagerly jumped in again.\u201cIt was a frenzy from there! Duchess Tuania slapped Duke Elgy\u2019s cheek like this. Pak! Then Duke\u2019s Elgy face twisted back. Suddenly, a woman ran over and pulled Duchess Tuania\u2019s hair from behind!\u201dWhat on earth\u2026? I looked up at Laura and she quickly explained.\u201cShe was one of Duke Elgy\u2019s former lovers. She was chasing him after their separation.\u201d\u201cShe was ordered to leave the capital yesterday.\u201d\u201cDoes anyone know why the Duchess Tuania hit Duke Elgy?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSo no one knew why, but that would mean only more people would talk about it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Your Majesty. Over two dozen of these incidents happen a year, right?\u201d\u201cEveryone will gossip then move on to the next thing.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI stirred my hands in the slightly cooled water. I checked the time, then got up twenty minutes later and pulled on a bathrobe.Incidents like Duchess Tuania\u2019s and Duke Elgy\u2019s happened frequently in high society, and only the characters involved changed. As Empress, I could not step beyond the line of governmental authority, and I had no choice but to let the incident go. In any case, I would hurt the duchess\u2019 pride if I mentioned it.As I went out in my bathrobe, a lady-in-waiting brought me an iced tea.\u201cThank you.\u201dI nodded as I accepted the cup, and glanced at the window habitually. To my surprise, I saw a familiar silhouette through the darkness.\u201cQueen?\u201dThe cup fell from my hand, and I quickly ran over to the window to open it. The bird hauled himself inside, exhausted.\u201cQueen, are you alright?\u201dHe looked tired, as if he had traveled farther than usual. Did Prince Heinley take Queen to Wirwol? But if he did, he would\u2019ve put the bird in his cage and brought him in his carriage\u2026Taking caring of Queen was my first priority, however, and I took him in my arms and sat on my bed.\u201cDrink this, Queen.\u201dLaura had brought cold water in a bowl, and Queen gulped it down greedily. As soon as he was refreshed, he flew up and circled the room three times.\u201cAre you alright now?\u201d\u2013 Gu!Gladdened by his response, I stood up and approached him. I wanted to hug him for a long time and kiss his cute forehead. However, Queen, who usually stood as still a doll, dodged my touch.\u201cQueen?\u201dHe landed onto the table and peered at me strangely, as if he were worrying about something.Queen? Is everything alright?\u201dI looked at him in concern. Queen tilted his head from side to side, gave what seemed to be a sigh, and came right near me. Then, he took my sleeve in his beak and tried to fly up.\u201cQueen?\u201dFor some reason, he wanted me to lift my hand. I obliged, but he kept trying to go upwards to the ceiling.I tried to pull away my arm, but he kept flapping his wings until he finally fell back onto the ground in exhaustion. Never had I heard a bird pant so loudly, nor seen one sit with its legs stretched out in front of it. Were all the birds like this? He looked the image of a tired man. I reached out carefully to touch his head, and Queen closed his eyes and weakly rubbed his head against my palm.\u201cQueen, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u2013 Gu\u2026\u201cAh! Queen, are you\u2026\u201d\u2013 !\u201cAre you trying to take me somewhere?\u201d\u2013 \u2026I supposed so.\u201cWhere do you want me to go? I\u2019ll catch up if you fly ahead.\u201dI picked up the fallen bird and asked if I could kiss his forehead, but he did not reply. Instead, he checked his wings, like a man looking at his hands, then sighed and flew out the window.\u2018What was he doing? Was he really trying to take me to Prince Heinley?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My eyes were throbbing, and I went outside to take a break. When I stepped out, I saw Rashta crouching down at the grass and staring at the ground. Perhaps she had heard the door open, and she looked around and said \u201cAh\u201d as soon as she saw me. She approached and gave me a bow.\u201cWell\u2026Your Majesty. If you don\u2019t mind, could you spare a few minutes?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dRashta looked around. As I was right outside my office, there were guards around the building, as well as Sir Artina standing right behind me. Rashta seemed to want to talk alone, but the knight made no move to leave. I gave him a meaningful glance, and he took a few steps backwards. However, when Rashta spoke, it was in a hushed whisper.\u201cYour Majesty, I hear that concubines receive an allowance\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cAbout thirty thousand krangs a year.\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes widened. It was more money than she expected.\u201cR-really?\u201dI nodded, and she covered her mouth with both hands. However, her expression looked gloomy when she spoke again.\u201cWhen can I get it?\u201d\u201cEarly next month. Why? Do you need the money now?\u201dI knew that Sovieshu was providing for her at the moment, but I asked her anyway. Rashta shook her head and put her hands together. Her words seem stuck in her throat, but after a few false starts she was able to force her words out.\u201cWell\u2026Your Majesty. Is all the money you give to Rashta on record?\u201d\u201cI keep the books.\u201dIt would remain not only on the bookkeeping records, but in historical ones as well, where future generations could read it. I did not bother to mention this however. Rashta hesitated again before speaking.\u201cThen\u2026Your Majesty. Yesterday, the Emperor said that Rashta\u2019s money would be managed by Baron Lant\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, well. I mean\u2014some of that money\u2026can you give it to Rashta separately?\u201d\u201cSeparately?\u201dWas she afraid of Baron Lant keeping an eye on her expenses?\u201cEven if Baron Lant is in charge of the money, it\u2019s still yours. If you\u2019re concerned it will be joined with Sovieshu\u2019s, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026but if you give me fifteen thousand out of the thirty thousand krangs\u2014or even ten thousand\u2014and don\u2019t write it down\u2026is it possible? I hear there is a lot of double bookkeeping\u2026\u201dWas she trying to create a slush fund? It wasn\u2019t a good thing, but it wasn\u2019t impossible. It sounded like she was only trying to divide up what she had. But it wasn\u2019t my business.\u201cYou should receive permission from the Emperor first.\u201d\u201cI heard the Empress takes care of the money\u2026\u201d\u201cBut the Emperor manages everything about you. Ask him yourself about this.\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes turned away in embarrassment. She muttered to herself, and left.***\u201cWhy the troubled face?\u201dWhen Duke Elgy spotted Rashta\u2019s expression when he walked into the room, he burst out laughing.Rashta\u2019s cheeks were swollen and red, and she hugged her pillow more tightly. Her expression didn\u2019t brighten the way it usually did when she saw Duke Elgy.Sensing that something must have happened, Duke Elgy took a nearby chair and stared at Rashta. With the sight of her silver hair trailing in delicate strands down the pillow, she was truly was a beauty irresistible to an emperor\u2014even when she was pouting.\u201cThe Empress is so cold.\u201d\u201cCold? Did you fight?\u201d\u201cCan I fight in my situation?\u201d\u201cThe Empress not the type to come forward and start a quarrel.\u201d\u201cYou know the Empress?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a good judge of people\u2019s personalities. Not in detail, but a good estimation.\u201d\u201cSo the Duke says the Empress has a good personality who doesn\u2019t start a quarrel?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say she has a good personality\u2026more cold, as you said. How should I put it? She acts like an empress, she thinks like an empress, and she speaks like an empress.\u201dDuke Elgy nodded as he recalled the woman he had only encountered twice. Navier was the perfect stereotype of an empress. According to his sources, she had shadowed the former empress at an early age and took her lessons from her. Navier was likely cast in that same mold.\u201cWhat you think is goodness is in reality her drawing a line between herself and others.\u201d\u201cYou know that from only seeing her briefly?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t brief. I was watching her at the tea party. But what\u2019s really going on, Miss?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRashta hesitated and she looked into Duke Elgy\u2019s eyes. The duke chuckled softly with one hand resting on his back.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dRashta paused, but she knew that he was the person she trusted the most in this world. He helped her in her most difficult time and protected her from the nobles\u2019 gossip. In the end, Rashta decided to confess.\u201cI asked her if she could give me some money without recording it in the books.\u201dDuke Elgy let out a laugh.\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cI need money\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there something you want? Tell the Emperor. He would do anything for you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m upset. The Emperor ordered Baron Lant to manage the money, and I can\u2019t use it.\u201dWhy couldn\u2019t she use money that someone else was managing? Duke Elgy noticed that Rashta was not saying anything. Instead of asking about it, however, he made his own suggestion instead.\u201cIf you need the money, shall I lend it to you?\u201d\u201cMy Lord?\u201d\u201cI am quite wealthy.\u201dHe added in a mischievous \u201cWell?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI will write the loan and the exact amount. Why don\u2019t we do that?\u201d\u201cEven if you loan the money now, I have to tell Baron Lant when I pay you back later. It still the same. It would be suspicious if he knew I borrowed money!\u201d\u201cBaron Lant won\u2019t manage it forever. After a few years, you will do it yourself, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dSovieshu had suggested that he would allow her to govern her allowance after she learned about financial management. If she studied hard and hid the fact that she was paying off Viscount Roteschu, Baron Lant\u2019s supervision could be removed after a year or two.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we write down the loan? I won\u2019t ask for the money back for five years.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cInstead.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThere is a condition.\u201d\u201cPaying interest?\u201dDuke Elgy chuckled and waved his hand.\u201cWhat is interest between friends? You only need to pay the loan amount.\u201dRashta knew how some people ended up as slaves when they failed to pay off their debts or went bankrupt. She had heard how dangerous it was to borrow money at high interest, and was relieved that Duke Elgy did not ask for it.\u201cThen what is the condition?\u201d\u201cCan you tell me why you need money?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to stop you if I think you\u2019re being scammed.\u201d\u201cScammed?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good reason if you\u2019re spending money without informing the Emperor. If it turns out you\u2019re investing in a scam, you should stop.\u201dHe seemed like he was joking, but there was genuine concern in his voice. Rashta stared at Duke Elgy for a moment. She wondered if he would help her if he knew the whole truth, but it was not necessary to take the risk if the situation was stable.But Rashta needed someone who could help her immediately. Someone who knew her situation and would not laugh or point fingers at her, but treat her with compassion. Right now, the only person that fit that criteria was Duke Elgy. Although the Emperor accepted her even when he knew she was a fugitive slave, her relationship with him was different than with Duke Elgy\u2019s. With the Emperor, it was love, and with the duke, it was friendship. Love could cause disappointment and rejection. Friendship was sympathetic, complimentary, supportive\u2026Rashta swallowed nervously.\u201cActually\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)Lately I had the feeling that someone was following me. I knew exactly who it was.It was Rashta. My husband\u2019s concubine.\u201cVery well. Then the concept of the ball will be a masquerade.\u201d\u201cIt was very well-received in the previous emperor\u2019s reign, so we\u2019re sure everyone will enjoy themselves.\u201d\u201cBut with everyone covering their faces, security has to be\u2014\u201dI paused.\u201cYour Majesty? What is it?\u201d\u201c\u2014thorough.\u201dThe culture minister looked at me with a puzzled expression. I turned my head and apologized for my rudeness.I had seen Rashta down the corridor. She was not looking at me, but I could see her talking to her maids.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis behavior had been going on for days. It was not harmful, but it subtly nagged at me. When I looked over to Rashta again, the minister stared at me and spoke carefully.\u201cYour Majesty, do you want to say something about Miss Rashta?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t she here yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes, she was.\u201dHe looked alternately between me and the other woman. I bit my lip. Yesterday, when I was working on another assignment, she was nearby. It was the same situation with another minister two days ago. In the eyes of the different ministers, it seemed like a brief encounter, but from my point of view it was no coincidence.As soon as I continued to stare at her, the culture minister gave a laugh.\u201cI hear she\u2019s been about, but don\u2019t worry too much, Your Majesty. She is only a low-born concubine and doesn\u2019t know royal etiquette yet, but it will get better.\u201dIf I showed concern over someone stalking me, why did that make me the oversensitive one? I took offense at his attempt to soothe me, but I masked it.\u201cGo now.\u201dThe minister walked down the long corridor, still looking between me and Rashta. I waited for a few moments for him to finally disappear, then asked Sir Artina to bring Rashta to me. She continued to pretend to converse with her maids and looked at me in surprise when the knight approached her. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she walked over to me.\u201cWh-why are you calling for Rashta?\u201dRashta approached with a frightened face, while her two maids flanked her sides. There was no need to waste time on idle conversation, so I simply went straight to the point.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that you haven\u2019t been. I\u2019ve been seeing you around for the past several days.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRashta blushed and twisted her fingers. I couldn\u2019t see it, but I could guess she was wiggling her toes as well. Her maids looked around with frightened expressions, as if I would yell at the slightest provocation. I ordered the maids to go elsewhere as they were making the atmosphere uncomfortable, and they moved away hesitantly.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dRashta spoke in a careful voice.\u201cDuke Elgy says you are a typical empress.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cRashta is not from the nobility, and there are many things I do not know about. Sometimes things don\u2019t make sense even when Baron Lant explains them to me\u2026\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo I want to learn from you, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRashta looked up at me with imploring eyes.\u201cI want to be like Her Majesty the Empress. But\u2026I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll want to teach me etiquette\u2026so I wanted to learn from a distance.\u201dWhether she realized it or not, she had said something correct. I wouldn\u2019t teach her etiquette.\u201cIf you want to learn, tell the Emperor or ask Viscountess Verdi to teach you.\u201dRashta winced as the Viscountess Verdi\u2019s name was brought up. Although the viscountess was her lady-in-waiting, they did not seem on good terms at the moment.\u201cWhat I want to be is like you, Her Majesty. Duke Elgy said that you are the perfect empress.\u201d\u201cAnd so you want to follow me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t bother you, so why don\u2019t you pretend not to see me? I\u2019ll be at a distance and you won\u2019t notice me. Well?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have called you if I didn\u2019t notice you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be more careful.\u201dI suddenly remembered the time when Rashta imitated the way I spoke in front of Grand Duke Kapmen and the other guests at the New Year\u2019s special banquet. The memory of it chilled my spine. It was not morally wrong for her to try to watch and learn from me, and as a runaway slave she likely wanted to rush into the upper echelons. However, I hated the woman who took my husband and imitated my mannerisms.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you got that idea, Rashta.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cSovieshu is in love with you, and you are completely different from me.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cYou also have Duke Elgy\u2019s friendship. Why do you think you need to follow me?\u201dAfter forcing myself to be polite to her all this time, I had no more patience for civility.\u201cIf you follow me without me noticing, then I will not be able to stop you. But if you see you with my own eyes, I will tell the knights to remove you. So do not come near me.\u201d***For the next few days, it was as if Rashta really was invisible. Although she cropped up from time to time, the frequency with which she did noticeably decreased. To an outsider, it may look like I was overreacting to her, but she wisely avoided me and there was no need to send a knight to remove her from my presence.But I didn\u2019t feel any better.Time wore on, and finally the day of the public ball arrived. It was a dance where all people, regardless of their social status, could attend. Commoners and nobles only met on few occasions. When the public perception of the nobles became low, the Imperial court held a ball to boost approval. While the mood was not bad under Sovieshu, it was still important to maintain goodwill, and what I selected to facilitate this was a masquerade ball.I wore a dress entirely made of vivid red fabric and placed a plumed white mask on my face. My identity as empress wouldn\u2019t be hidden as I would be among my guards anyway, but I still wanted to dress in the spirit of the occasion.\u201cEveryone will be so amazed.\u201d\u201cI wish you wore this color all the time, Your Majesty. Your skin tone matches this shade of red very well.\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t be surprised. There will be all kinds of beautiful costumes at the masquerade ball.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to wear a color as strong as this, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI entered the ballroom exchanging light jokes with the ladies-in-waiting, but it soon turned out that their jokes were all too literal. Shortly after entering the ballroom, everyone was amazed at my clothes.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just wasn\u2019t the kind of amazement the ladies-in-waiting expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)I tried to keep my expression as straight as possible as the murmuring in the room grew louder. There was another woman wearing a dress almost identical to mine. I recognized her instantly from her unusual silver hair and delicate mouth.\u201cOh my God.\u201dCountess Eliza murmured in a shocked voice while the room swayed in front of my eyes. From the bright red dress to the shoes, necklace, earrings, and even the white plumed mask\u2014the concept and arrangement were the same.Rashta turned her head towards the direction of the crowd\u2019s interest, then gave a surprised \u201cOh?\u201d when she saw me.The room lapsed into silence. No one spoke, but their thoughts were clearly written on their faces. If they looked at my and Rashta\u2019s expressions, it was clear that neither of us planned this on purpose. Everyone held their breath in anxiety and interest.I stood still and looked at Rashta. I had a lot to say to her, but I didn\u2019t approach her first. Whether if it was for an excuse or an apology, she was the one who had to come to me. I was taught that the empress didn\u2019t go to her inferiors to give excuses.Rashta came up to me, looking genuinely surprised.\u201cYour Majesty, your costume\u2026with Rashta\u2026\u201dShe hesitated.\u201cDid you intentionally wear something like Rashta?\u201dCountess Eliza had a burst of anger.\u201cThat\u2019s rude, Miss Rashta.\u201dAn unpleasant feeling rose up to my neck, but I remained calm and gave her a light smile.\u201cI came here as myself. Weren\u2019t you the one that wanted to imitate everything about me?\u201dI smiled but I kept my voice as cold as possible, while Rashta looked at me with a puzzled expression.\u201cWhy would I do that now? This time, Your Majesty, you\u2019re dressed like me, right?\u201d\u201cWhy you?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cThis will only make both of us a laughingstock, so there\u2019s no need for this. You should understand that from now on.\u201dI deliberately told her, \u2018If you wear the same dress, we both lose, and I know that.\u2019 Anyone who heard this would know that I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to make a fool of myself, other than those that didn\u2019t want to believe my words.Rashta inhaled sharply with a stunned expression. As a politician I knew how to defend myself with calculating lines, while she defended herself with her face. As I brushed past her, she took off the mask she was wearing and tossed it to the floor. I walked straight to my prepared seat without looking back, and Countess Eliza and the other ladies-in-waiting settled near me.Meanwhile a group of men moved in on Rashta to cheer her up. Don\u2019t cry, I heard them say. Among them seemed to be some common folk, who were looking alternately between me and Rashta with surprise and curiosity. Some people spoke in hushed tones, but they couldn\u2019t completely mute their conversation.Sir Artina leaned over to me and spoke in a low voice.\u201cShould I take care of those saying rude things?\u201d\u201cLeave it be.\u201dI answered as nonchalantly as I could and leaned back against my seat. It was easy to wield power in public, but doing so could lead to great after effects. People liked the powerful, but they hated them using their power. If I tried to stop them from talking just because of my mood, it would inevitably lead to a fallout.\u201cThe person who arrived first should be considered the first one to wear the dress.\u201d\u201cYou mean the silver-haired noblewoman?\u201d\u201cShe looks innocent to me.\u201d\u201cWhy would the Empress try to copy another person\u2019s clothing?\u201d\u201cOh, I heard the silver-haired woman is the Emperor\u2019s concubine. And she\u2019s not a noble, she came from the common people like us!\u201d\u201cReally? So the Empress tried to sabotage her?\u201dI ignored the frustrating conversation and maintained my cool composure. It seemed as if those men were commoners, and they were completely possessed by the mysterious and innocent appearance of Rashta. They gazed at her as if she was a fairy from another world.I hid my trembling feet. I heard others side with me and say that Rashta was the one that copied me, but it was the bad stories that affected me more. Rashta looked the same\u2014despite people siding with her, her expression wasn\u2019t good.I took my eyes off her and forced myself to think about something else. For instance, who gave the details of my outfit to Rashta? While I was angry with her at the moment, the most important thing wasn\u2019t her.\u2018Who was it that leaked the information to her?\u2019It was difficult to pinpoint the culprit, as the dress wasn\u2019t chosen in a day. There were many times, methods, and people who could communicate those words.Once again it was Laura who spoke in open fury for me.\u201cCountess Eliza, is this how other concubines behave? I\u2019m so angry!\u201d\u201cBecause concubines are legal, it\u2019s hard to touch them when they are favored. Many concubines have done worse, Lady Laura.\u201d\u201cHow could it be worse?\u201d\u201cIf you look at the previous empresses\u2014\u201dCountess Eliza suddenly paused, covering her mouth with her fan and looking at something over my shoulder. I turned my head and found Sovieshu entering the room. He had disregarded the dress code and dressed in a plain suit, while Rashta gleefully rushed to his side.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dShe called out to him in a sweet voice. Her eyes were red as she clung to Sovieshu and told him something, but I couldn\u2019t make it out from here. However, he glanced in my direction, and our eyes met. I smiled wanly at him and nodded. Rashta also looked at me as she hung to Sovieshu\u2019s arm, and I gave her a nonchalant smile as well, then deliberately turned away towards Countess Eliza. I could hear the chatter of the young men and women excited to see the Emperor and Rashta up close.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dCountess Eliza said my name anxiously. I gave her a reassuring smile and reached for my glass of wine. Once I touched it I immediately regretted it, but it was too late. I lifted my glass and took a sip. However, Countess Eliza kept trying to tell me something with her eyes. I looked to the side again, and saw Sovieshu was approaching. Oh\u2026he must be coming here to sit next to me. Rashta still clung to his arm.\u201cHa ha ha, I was so surprised when the Empress and Miss Rashta came in with the same dress!\u201dEven Grand Duke Liltiang partook in the gossip.\u201cActually, Miss Rashta wore it first and then the Empress appeared.\u201d\u201cBut it looks different because they each have a different atmosphere.\u201dI smiled lightly and took another sip. Those who sided with Rashta were saying that I copied her. The people I disliked were here, and my heart clenched even more. However, my smile was wiped from my face at Sovieshu\u2019s next remark.\u201cYes, it\u2019s incredible. I asked the Empress to come in a red dress.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)\u201c?!\u201dNo. He couldn\u2019t have said that. My head whirled towards Sovieshu. Why would he lie\u2026?My husband approached me, then leaned over to kiss my cheek.\u201cYou are beautiful beyond imagination, Empress. Thank you for granting my request.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why he would invent such a thing, but I quickly responded as if his words were true.\u201cWhatever color you wish, simply say it.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026it was the Emperor\u2019s request.\u201dGrand Duke Liltiang looked embarrassed, but then he quickly smiled and amended his words.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see them get along so well.\u201dThe group surrounding Rashta exchanged nervous glances with each other. Rashta\u2019s expression, on the other hand, was dark. Even with Sovieshu by her side, she looked unhappy. I watched Sovieshu take a drink, but his gaze was fixed elsewhere and I couldn\u2019t ask him why he helped me.I held on to my glass like a lifeline as I stared around the hall. The ladies-in-waiting stayed with me at first, but as they became bored, one-by-one they began to peel off in different directions. The nobles who were sitting close to the Emperor went to the dance floor as soon as the music began. Surprisingly, Rashta went somewhere else instead of lingering here.\u2018Is she going to Duke Elgy?\u2019No, I had heard Duke Elgy left the palace a few days ago. Perhaps she just wanted to socialize with everyone? I was caught up in my thoughts when a voice spoke up from my side.\u201cSo who copied who?\u201dI turned to my side. Sovieshu was looking at me with a gentle expression.\u201cWho do you think?\u201d\u201cTo be honest\u2026\u201dHis voice was a low whisper in my ear.\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cYet you sided with me?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t approve?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it. Miss Rashta will be upset later.\u201d\u201cEven so, I had no choice but to help you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, you had no choice?\u201d\u201cThe empress is the face of the Eastern Empire. You represent the honor of the Imperial Family. Isn\u2019t the answer obvious?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHis answer eased my confusion. Convinced, I looked back towards the front as bright light and cheerful music began to fill the room. Masked men and women held each other\u2019s hands, smiling and moving their feet jovially to the music. Even if someone wasn\u2019t a skillful dancer, they had a smiling look on their face. The commoners enjoyed the novelty of the ball, while the nobles seemed to be excited about the less formal atmosphere.There was a cheer from somewhere in the room. I turned towards the sound, and saw Rashta dancing alone in the center of a high stage. Her silver hair gleamed in the air as her light feet waltzed and twirled, and the crowd was drawn to her like a moth to flame. The commoners in particular seemed cheerful, and clapped their hands whenever Rashta spun around. I noticed that Sovieshu\u2019s admiring gaze was also fastened on her.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and dance with her?\u201dThe words involuntarily left my mouth. Sovieshu turned to look at me.\u201cOver there?\u201dHis eyebrows lifted in surprise.\u201cYou seem to want to go.\u201dI answered with a nod of my head, and he gave me a strange look.\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d\u201cJealous? Me? \u201d\u201cOr is it sarcasm?\u201d\u201cWho says it\u2019s sarcasm?\u201d\u201cWhen are you going to break the habit of speaking like that when you\u2019re angry?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same?\u201d\u201cYou know, I think\u2026\u201dSovieshu bowed his head in a moment of thought, then turned back towards me with a serious expression on his face. I wondered what he was going to say.\u201cBy any chance, when my empress mother brought you around, did she teach you how to fight with words? Why is it that you always refuse to support even one word of mine?\u201d\u201cYou want to know?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, a little.\u201d\u201cWell then, why don\u2019t we put down the crown for half an hour and have a heart-to-heart talk? In a neutral zone? Then I\u2019ll give you my mind.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cYou said that once when we were children. Do you remember what you did afterwards?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not falling for it again. I clearly don\u2019t like it.\u201d***\u2018What are they talking about?\u2019Rashta stopped dancing and brushed the sweat off her face as she stepped down from the stage. She frowned as she saw the Emperor\u2019s and Empress\u2019 heads leaned towards each other in conversation. They looked quite serious\u2026Rashta\u2019s heart sank. The Emperor never discussed state affairs with her, or his job, what he\u2019s been doing, what he was worried about, and so on. She enjoyed his warm eyes and attention, but she felt uneasy whenever the Emperor and Empress talked about something so seriously.\u2018Duke Elgy has gone to Rimwell\u2026\u2019She had no word from him since he went down to Roteschu\u2019s estate to investigate the matter about the baby. She wondered if he was doing his job well. Rashta had stopped dancing, unable to cope with her rising anxiety.There was something else that captured her attention, however. From across the room she spotted Duke Tuania, who, unlike the ever-popular Duchess Tuania, was sipping his wine alone. Rashta smiled to herself and approached him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)Sovieshu and I kept arguing, and I waved my hand after I got tired of his drivel. I didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. The same was true of Sovieshu, who wore a sour expression and called a passing servant to fetch more wine.\u201cWill you have a drink, Empress?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll have cake.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to gain weight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than being drunk in public, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t get drunk. But if you eat at this time of day, you\u2019ll get fat.\u201d\u201cEven if I gain a bit of weight, I have a tailor on hand.\u201dSovieshu scoffed into his wine as I put a forkful of cake into my mouth.At that moment, music began to flow in the room again, and everyone on the dance floor changed partners. Sovieshu and I had the uninteresting job of simply sitting here at the table, but we had to keep up formal appearances. I picked a strawberry from a slice of cake and put it in my mouth, while Sovieshu looked around with a bored expression.Suddenly, his gaze halted. I followed the direction of his stare, and saw Rashta laughing and talking with someone in a corner. I couldn\u2019t see who it was as they were hidden by the crowd\u2014no, now I could see them. It was Duke Tuania, smiling as if he were enjoying his conversation with Rashta.\u2018Will Sovieshu be jealous?\u2019I glanced to the side, but Sovieshu had already turned away and handed a servant his empty wine glass.\u2018He\u2019s not jealous?\u2019Though he kept glancing at them every once in a while, he seemed largely unperturbed. Was it really alright for his lover to smile and talk to other men? Was he not jealous?\u201c\u2026\u201dYes. He trusted her.I shook my head. What was so important about Sovieshu\u2019s reaction anyway? It was between them. It would be strange if I was caught watching them, so I took another bite of cake again.\u201cQueen.\u201dA familiar voice called to me. I looked up, and saw a man in a glittering gold mask approaching me. I immediately knew who he was by the name he addressed me.\u201cPrince Heinley.\u201dHe smiled underneath his mask.\u201cMay I sit with you? I\u2019m not good at dancing.\u201d\u201cWhy, though? You\u2019ve been flying about very well.\u201dPrince Heinley and I turned towards Sovieshu, who was looking at the prince and holding up his glass of wine.\u201cYour Majesty, how are you?\u201dPrince Heinley greeted him belatedly with a smile, but Sovieshu\u2019s expression remained cold. Oh\u2026yes. The pair of them had almost gotten into a fight over Rashta. Sovieshu\u2019s hatred for Prince Heinley was not out of jealousy, but out of insult.The cake suddenly felt stale in my mouth. I set down my fork and handed my plate to a servant.***As soon as I returned to the palace, I instructed my aide to find out who leaked the information about my dress. He looked skeptical as he received my orders, however. Was that even possible? What I wore was not confidential, and some noblewomen requested this kind of information in advance so their dresses wouldn\u2019t overlap. As expected, after three days the aide could pinpoint any one person to be the culprit.\u201cMany ladies and gentleman had asked, and there were too many people who had answered, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dIt was evening. Laura, who had been out for Lady Alischute\u2019s birthday, returned earlier than expected.\u201cYour Majesty, Countess, did you hear?! There\u2019s shocking news!\u201dLaura burst into the room, and Countess Eliza frowned at her.\u201cLaura, I told you not to run in front of Her Majesty.\u201d\u201cThere is no time for manners, Countess!\u201d\u201cThere is always time.\u201d\u201cThis is urgent! How could this be a time for manners?\u201dLaura rushed over to me and collapsed by my side to catch her breath. She was a healthy woman, and must have run here from a distance. Countess Eliza was too overwhelmed with curiosity to nag her, instead choosing to sit next to her, while the other ladies-in-waiting paused their chess game. Laura took in a deep breath as everyone crowded around her.\u201cIt\u2019s about Duchess Tuania.\u201d\u201cLaura, if you\u2019re talking about Lord Marian or Duke Elgy, you\u2019re a step behind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the story, Countess Jubel.\u201dLaura looked affronted, as both of those stories had already been widely circulated. To be precise, one was an old scandal had been revived, and the other was when Duke Elgy was slapped on the cheek.\u201cWell?\u201d\u201cDuke Tuania told the Duchess he would divorce her.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe ladies covered their mouths in astonishment. I was also shocked, and I set my book aside. Why Duke Tuania?\u201cIs it because of rumors about Lord Marian?\u201dAt Countess Eliza\u2019s question, Laura nodded.\u201cYes. I heard him yelling, \u2018Is he my brother\u2019s son?\u2019 and that he couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious.\u201d\u201cBut he never said it before, so why is he mentioning it now?\u201dOne of the ladies-in-waiting feigned a smile, while Countess Jubel clicked her tongue.\u201cShortly after Lord Marian went into the church, Duchess Tuania visited the temple at the request of the former duke. Before that, they had a close relationship. From the standpoint of the current Duke Tuania, he would be suspicious if he heard these kinds of rumors. Keep talking, Laura. \u201dLaura looked alternately between the two, then continued.\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t like that the Duchess got into a fight with another woman. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was because there was something between Duke Elgy and her.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cThe Duke must be frustrated that paternity tests are not allowed by the Church.\u201d\u201cThere used to be talk from some time ago. Someone said to the former duke, \u2018Is it possible that the baby may be Lord Marian\u2019s?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Is he not still my grandchild anyway?\u2019\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting tsked collectively. Paternity tests had once been considered infallible, until the Rumpel case thirty-five years ago. A woman went to the Church to found out who her child\u2019s father was, but the father had an identical twin brother. As the priest examined the results, he concluded that both men were the baby\u2019s fathers, revealing a loophole in the paternity tests. However, even if there was a flaw, those particular circumstances were so rare\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s kind quite strange, actually. Duke Tuania said they conceived the baby before they were married, but since they were wedded, the Duchess hasn\u2019t gotten pregnant since.\u201d\u201cMaybe Duke Tuania is too proud to admit he\u2019s infertile.\u201dThe supposed affair of Lord Marian and Duchess Tuania happened when I was still young enough that I had no idea of the commotion at the time. Why was it dredged up now after it had been buried for ten years?\u201cDoes this have something to do with Miss Rashta?\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting stopped chattering and turned towards me. They were unsure why Rashta\u2019s name was brought up all of a sudden, and in all fairness I had no proof. However, Rashta recently asked me about Duchess Tuania, and soon after a scandal broke\u2026was that too weak of a connection?\u201cWhat did Duchess Tuania say, Lady Laura?\u201d\u201cShe said she would never divorce. It may even go to trial.\u201dThe ladies-in-waiting began to talk about the possibility of the duchess winning the trial.***I found the timing of this situation unusual, so I asked the ladies-in-waiting to find out why Duke Tuania suddenly brought up the problem. I suspected Rashta must have fanned the duke\u2019s anxious mind, but that alone was not cause for punishment, not unless she actively manipulated information.\u2018But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to know.\u2019If Rashta caused this, she could not simply be treated as a naive slave-turned-concubine. She had the ability to influence society and manipulate public opinion, and one had to be wary of such enemies.However, four days after hearing the news of the Duke Tuania\u2019s intention to divorce, something more shocking happened.\u201cEmpress! Rashta was stabbed by Viscount Langdel!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he was selected as the duchess\u2019 dance partner at the New Year\u2019s ball, he beamed as if he had the world in his hands. That same young man stabbed Rashta\u2026\u201cHe must have thought it was Miss Rashta who started the rumor about the Duchess Tuania.\u201dThe lady-in waiting who delivered the news looked surprised.\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cTell me the details.\u201d\u201cEverything started out fine at first. It was Rashta who let him in her room. I don\u2019t know why.\u201dRashta must have allowed him in because she knew he was a lovesick young man. She had watched the men who gathered around the duchess at the New Year\u2019s celebrations.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say this, but\u2026\u201dThe maid started muttering in an apologetic way, but then she waved her hands as if to ignore it and started talking again.\u201cDuke Elgy came in and kicked down the door, saying he smelled blood, and fortunately he hit\u2014no, he stopped Viscount Langdel. The viscount was seized on the spot.\u201d\u201cDuke Elgy? He\u2019s returned?\u201d\u201cYes, but that\u2019s not the important part, Your Majesty. When Viscount Langdel was caught, he kept shouting that Rashta that ruined Duchess Tuania\u2026\u201dThe lady-in-waiting glanced at me.\u201cThat\u2019s why I was surprised when you mentioned Duchess Tuania all of a sudden, Your Majesty. Is there really something there?\u201dAlthough we both approached this from different situations, we coincidentally came around to the same subject.\u201cHow is Miss Rashta doing?\u201d***\u201cHow is she?\u201dThe doctor felt for Rashta\u2019s pulse. Her face was pale and sweaty as she gave a low moan, but no answer was forthcoming from the palace doctor.\u201cHow is she?\u201dSovieshu repeated himself, looking at the bandages wrapped around Rashta\u2019s abdomen. She looked in a terrible state. The doctor sighed and stared at Sovieshu as if to urge him to be quiet.\u201cJust tell me!\u201dSovieshu voice raised to a yell, and the doctor closed his eyes.\u201cYour Majesty, please be quiet for a moment. I can\u2019t concentrate.\u201dSovieshu retreated and paced the room with his arms folded, anxiety eating away at him. He felt like he was going crazy. The doctor had already said the injury was not life-threatening after his first examination, so why was he doing this now?After a few paces he came face-to-face Duke Elgy, who had been standing nearby. The duke greeted him with a light smile, and Sovieshu clapped him on the shoulder.\u201cThank you. You saved Rashta.\u201dHe was so worried earlier that he forgot about the duke\u2019s existence.\u201cIt was just luck.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dSovieshu nodded and began to pace again, oblivious when Duke Elgy kept watching him carefully.\u201c\u2026\u201dDuke Elgy tilted his head. He had saved Rashta, but Sovieshu made no mention of the fact that another man came to his concubine\u2019s room late in the evening. Duke Elgy was amazed to see the emperor deal with it so coolly.\u2018Is he surprised or\u2014\u2019His thought was interrupted by the palace doctor\u2019s voice.\u201cWhat is this? How strange!\u201dDuke Elgy turned his gaze from Sovieshu towards the doctor, who had let go of Rashta\u2019s wrist and was feeling her stomach instead.\u201cCan you press the injury like that?\u201dSovieshu snapped at the doctor, but he just smiled.\u201cNot this part. And I\u2019m not pressing hard, Your Majesty.\u201dSovieshu was about to give him another warning, when the doctor gave a whoop and turned to Sovieshu.\u201cCongratulations, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cCongratulations? Congratulations on what?\u201d\u201cThere is a baby in Miss Rashta\u2019s stomach!\u201dThe other men in the room froze.\u201cBaby\u2026?\u201dSovieshu looked at Rashta\u2019s stomach in surprise. It looked flat to him.\u201cBaby?\u201d\u201cI believe Miss Rashta became pregnant after the time you rescued her from the woods, Your Majesty.\u201dA stunned silence filled the room. Sovieshu covered his mouth with his hand.\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d***As I readied myself for work, I stared into the mirror while Countess Eliza trimmed my hair with a serious face. She noticed me looking at her and gave an awkward smile, but her expression remained stiff.\u201cIs everything alright, Countess Eliza?\u201dShe answered with a sigh.\u201cIn truth\u2026There are many things worry about.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but agree. There had been an influx of incidents all at once\u2014Duchess Tuania was in the process of divorce, while Viscount Langdel stabbed Rashta for revenge\u2026Laura was plucking at the plume on my hat when she spoke.\u201cWhat will happen to Viscount Langdel?\u201dShe sounded worried, as the viscount was a moderate acquaintance of hers. Stabbing an emperor\u2019s concubine was a definite crime, and the viscount was currently being held in jail.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll find out more.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe Viscount Langdel did that. It\u2019s impossible to believe.\u201dA lady-in-waiting opened her mouth to console Laura, but before she could, another lady-in-waiting came in the room.\u201cYour Majesty. The Emperor is here.\u201d\u201cAt this time?\u201dIt was still early in the morning. Sovieshu was here in person instead of a messenger? I looked in puzzlement at the lady-in-waiting.\u201cLet him in.\u201dDespite my vexation, I didn\u2019t have any choice, and the lady-in-waiting gave a noise of affirmation and hurried out. I turned away from the mirror and looked in the direction of the door, and a few moments later, Sovieshu entered my room. I wondered what words of comfort I should offer him. To my surprise, however, he did not look distraught. Instead of anger or sadness, somewhere on his face was a subtle joy.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dWas Rashta\u2019s injury less severe than expected? Yet that was still no reason to be happy about it.\u201cIs Miss Rashta all right?\u201dThe reply he gave left me stunned.\u201cRashta is pregnant.\u201dFor a moment, I couldn\u2019t process what I had heard. Who was pregnant? Rashta?\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t offer my congratulations.\u201dThe honest words involuntary left my mouth. Sovieshu looked at me with a critical eye, but it was true. I couldn\u2019t celebrate this with him.\u201cIt may not be recognized as a part of the imperial family, but it\u2019s still my first child.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dMy heart thumped in my chest, but his face seemed strangely chilled. Perhaps my face was equally cold too.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give your congratulations. Starting from next month, however, I hope will you increase the allowance as much as any other concubine that has children.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI would have done that anyway.\u201cRashta is not awake yet, but her injuries are not life-threatening.\u201dI didn\u2019t respond to this information Sovieshu gave me, keeping my eyes fastened on a couch instead. I counted the flowers and leaves on the pattern. Sovieshu sighed heavily, and did not look back when he left the room. Even after he was gone, I simply stood frozen.I must have remained there for a while, when I noticed a figure sitting on the window sill. Queen was perched there with his beak open. The window hadn\u2019t been shut, so he must have sat on the window sill and waited for me to notice him. Did he come in during the conversation?Either way, I was fortunate. As I approached, Queen flew into my arms, and I squeezed his body tight and buried my face in between his feathers. Queen wrapped me with his large wings as best he could. I could hear his small heart beating loudly.\u201cThank you\u2026it\u2019s so much better to have someone hold you.\u201dIt was a hug better than a thousand words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone stole surreptitious glances at me at the central palace, and hurriedly quieted themselves when I passed by. As soon as it was time for dinner, I sent the workers back. Despite my success in keeping my composure calm all day, my facial muscles were fatigued.What should I do when Rashta\u2019s baby was born? I remembered how the previous empress treated the emperor\u2019s illegitimate children. She had treated most of them fairly enough, but she was cold to the children of the concubines she particularly disliked.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t going to be easy. People were sympathetic to young children, and both Rashta and Sovieshu were so beautiful that their baby would surely be as lovely as a fairy. If I were cold to such a precious child, who was also the Emperor\u2019s first baby, my reputation would be ruined. Everyone would stare at me and whisper, \u2018What is wrong with her?\u2019 Furthermore, if I didn\u2019t want that child to get any foolish ideas, I had to give birth to my own legitimate child before the age gap became too great.As soon as I entered my room, I fell into an armchair and took a deep breath. It was as if the surrounding air was trying to crush me.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dMy hand was resting on my temple as I lifted my head and saw Countess Eliza near me.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley is here. He seemed to be in a hurry to see you\u2026\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley?\u201dI sat up from the chair. Why was he here?Since becoming a secret friend, Prince Heinley hadn\u2019t come to visit me outright, choosing only to exchange the customary greetings and pleasantries when we met outside. I had also visited him only once when I was worried about Queen. If he had come in person, it must be urgent.\u201cBring him in.\u201dConcerned, I quickly went out to the drawing room. There was no need for me to change clothes as I hadn\u2019t undressed from my formal ones yet. The same time I entered the drawing room, Prince Heinley walked in.\u201cWould you like tea, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Countess.\u201dAs soon as Countess Eliza closed the door behind her, Prince Heinley walked up to me and held up his arms in the air.\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to console you. Can I give you a hug, as a friend?\u201dI stared at him, and Prince Heinley looked at me encouragingly.\u201cFriends hug each other for comfort.\u201dOh\u2026that was what he was here for. He came running here to cheer me up. A sense of relief flooded body.\u201cAlright.\u201dAs soon as I stepped towards him, he hugged me tightly.I couldn\u2019t help but notice the firmness and broadness of his shoulders. I leaned my forehead in, inhaling a familiar scent. It was always the scent of Queen. Did Queen smell like the prince or did the prince smell like Queen?Although Queen\u2019s hug was comforting, Prince Heinley\u2019s body was much larger. I felt safe as I was engulfed in his arms. Everything is fine, his body seemed to say, and between the familiar scent and unfamiliar arms, the turmoil in my mind settled. Even the sound of his heartbeat granted me a sense of security. It was healthy and loud and fast.\u201cI really\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI really must be a rotten jerk, Queen.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI came here to comfort you because I was afraid you were upset. But I was having bad thoughts in the meantime.\u201d\u201cBad thoughts?\u201dWhat was he talking about? I pulled away my forehead in confusion and stepped back, while Prince Heinley lowered his arms. His face was red as he slightly backed away.\u201cWas I too close to you?\u201dI looked at him worriedly, and he gave a tentative \u201cHuh?\u201d His ears turned red and he waved his hands.\u201cI wasn\u2019t having bad thoughts about that, Queen. Absolutely not. I\u2019m not the kind of person who gets excited like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dExcited\u2026?I stared at him.\u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201dPrince Heinley covered his eyes with both his hands as if he wanted the ground to swallow him.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask me in the first place. I dug myself into this, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201c\u2026A little.\u201dAt the sound of his distress, my mouth couldn\u2019t help but turn up.\u201cWell, I\u2019m smiling in the middle of this. Human emotions are complicated.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad that my embarrassment made you smile.\u201dThe prince sighed and then gave a chuckle. Just then, Countess Eliza came in with the tea. She set the tray down on the table, then hurried out to leave the pair of use alone again.I held up a teacup for him, and he carefully accepted it. I could feel his hand trembling as our fingers brushed against each other. His gaze was cast downwards when I looked up at him, but he slowly lifted his eyes, revealing purple irises from underneath his soft gold eyelashes. It was captivating.\u201cIf Prince Heinley was a woman\u2026\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThe Emperor would fall in love with you. Your eyes are gorgeous.\u201d\u201cWhat a peculiar way to give a compliment.\u201dHe stared at me for a moment then burst into laughter, then brought his cup to his lips.\u201cIf I were a woman, I would become the Queen\u2019s lady-in-waiting.\u201d\u201cMy lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cWe can stay together all day.\u201d\u201cDo you wish to be my lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cNot that. Focus on the part after that, Queen.\u201dThere was laughter again. After hearing the news about the baby, I was happy to find relief with Prince Heinley, though I knew it was a temporary prescription and I would feel nauseous again after he left. As I was about to bring up the topic about the bird Queen, Countess Eliza knocked on the door again.\u201cYour Majesty, Duchess Tuania is here.\u201dDuchess Tuania?\u201cBring her in.\u201dWhat was she doing here at this time? I had a good relationship with the duchess, but there was no occasion for noblewomen to visit me in the evening without an invitation, not unless they were my ladies-in-waiting. I was just as surprised as I knew she was loaded down with her problems. Was there something she needed me to do for her?When Duchess Tuania came in, her eyes were wet.\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave, Queen.\u201dPrince Heinley sensibly realized it was not a conversation he should be involved in, so he gave a nod to the duchess and left. I took the duchess\u2019 hand and led her to sit on the couch.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you alright?\u201dDuchess Tuania\u2019s back was straight and her posture was graceful, but she looked more worn than usual. As soon as she sat on the couch, she took both my hands in hers. I waited for her to speak instead of prodding her, and finally the duchess managed to choke out the words caught in her mouth.\u201cYour Majesty, I am so ashamed to ask you this, but\u2026please save Viscount Langdel.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The duchess looked at me, her wide eyes laced with pain.\u201cHe won\u2019t go to trial, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cNo trial?\u201d\u201cThe viscount\u2019s case won\u2019t go to the chief judge.\u201dThe chief judge was one of the duchess\u2019 advocates. If he had secretly told the duchess, it was likely that it was true.\u201cWhy? Ah, is it because Miss Rashta is pregnant?\u201dThe duchess bit her lip and nodded.\u201cYes. I believe the Emperor will not charge Viscount Langdel for attempted murder of that woman, but for the near death of a royal baby.\u201dIn that event, execution was the indisputable outcome for Viscount Langdel. Sovieshu would want it to happen either way. If the case went to the chief judge, Sovieshu would be worried what Viscount Langdel would say at an open court.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that after he stabbed \u2018that woman,\u2019 he was yelling.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cViscount Langdel\u2026\u201dThe duchess took a deep breath and looked at me with earnest eyes.\u201cViscount Langdel is an upright young man. He wouldn\u2019t do this for no reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. Even if he had a reason, he shouldn\u2019t stab someone. But at least try get him a trial. That way, he can defend himself\u2026!\u201dA tear escaped Duchess Tuania\u2019s eye and slipped down her cheek. It must be painful that a man who defended her honor was now under threat of execution. In the past, Duke Tuania\u2019s brother had taken his own life because of his love for Duchess Tuania. She never let herself show it, but the incident may have been traumatic for her.\u201cI was considering talking to him myself.\u201dI rubbed her back and waited until she calmed down a little, and Duchess Tuania looked up at me with rounded eyes.\u201cWill you?\u201dI nodded in affirmation.\u201cI have my own suspicions as well.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cI suspected Miss Rashta was trying to discredit you.\u201d\u201cThen is the rumor true?\u201d\u201cI will find out more myself.\u201dDuchess Tuania tightened her fists.\u201cRight now, the Emperor is away. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll send Viscount Langdel to trial, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll visit the viscount. \u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you, Your Majesty.\u201dThe duchess inhaled deeply. I gave her my handkerchief, but she simply took it in her hand and did not wipe her tears. After a long moment, she folded it up and asked, \u201cCan I have it?\u201dWhy a handkerchief?\u201cYes.\u201dDespite my puzzlement, I agreed. The duchess put the handkerchief away and breathed a heavy sigh. Her next words gave some me clarification.\u201cHowever it works out for Viscount Langdel\u2026I will repay this act of kindness to you someday.\u201d\u201cKindness? Don\u2019t say that. It\u2019s not enough to be called a kindness.\u201d\u201cYou reached out your hand to me in my most difficult time. That is kindness.\u201dThe duchess stared at me for a moment.\u201cCan I hug you once?\u201dI nodded, and she leaned over and wrapped her arms around me, rubbing my back as if to console me. She then pulled away. I looked at her questioningly, but she simply smiled and stood up.Without explaining, Duchess Tuania bowed gracefully and left the room.***The next day.I sent one of my knights to look into Viscount Langdel\u2019s status. The knight returned earlier than expected, right before noon time.\u201cViscount Langdel\u2019s interrogation is over, and the Emperor has made a decision, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHe will be sentenced to death.\u201d\u2018Will that reallly happen\u2026\u2019\u201cThank you for letting me know.\u201dI left my office and headed straight to the prison where Viscount Langdel was being held. The guards looked surprised to see me, but they did not obstruct me from entering. Sovieshu must not have ordered them otherwise.There were six rooms on the first floor of the prison where nobles were held, five of which were empty. I went to the only cell that was occupied. Although there were bars, the cell itself was furnished like an ordinary civilian room.Viscount Langdel was seated with his head in his hands, and he weakly lifted his head up as he heard my approaching footsteps. His eyes widened in surprise, and when he tried to stand up, he teetered and stumbled onto the bars. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I noticed that his face was bruised and blood trickled from his split lips.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty. I should bow, but my legs won\u2019t cooperate.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to bow.\u201dI remembered when he once looked as happy as a child when he was chosen by the duchess at the New Year\u2019s ball. Now he was in a dark jail cell, a bruised and broken man.\u2018But why is he smiling?\u2019My question was soon answered.\u201cIs everyone talking about what that woman did to the duchess now?\u201d\u201c!\u201dViscount Langdel mumbled through his broken lips.\u201cI shouted. Everyone knows, I screamed loud.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was stupid, now that I think of it. I should have confirmed the information I found, instead of visiting that woman first. I was too quick to end it\u2026\u201dSo that was why he yelled at Rashta as he was being held down by Duke Elgy.Viscount Langdel leaned weakly against the wall, a self-mocking smile on his face. After a moment\u2019s consideration, I told him the truth.\u201cNo one is talking about it. The matter is buried.\u201dViscount Langdel pulled back in surprise, his eyes wide.\u201cBuried? What that woman did is buried?\u201d\u201cIt was forgotten when it was discovered that Rashta is pregnant.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026haaa. Pregnant? Pregnant. It can\u2019t be.\u201dViscount Langdel clenched his fingers in his hair as if to tear it out. He still had a smile on his face. He wasn\u2019t there when everyone heard about Rashta\u2019s pregnancy, and Sovieshu didn\u2019t seem to have mentioned it to him either.\u201cViscount. You will be executed without trial.\u201dViscount Langdel clenched his teeth as if he hadn\u2019t known that either. He put his hands around his head, and made a pained sound and started muttering incoherently. I leaned down to his level, but he was in too much agony to notice me.\u201cViscount. Look at me.\u201dHe turned to me at my voice, but his eyes were unseeing. I drew his attention by hitting the bars with my fingers.\u201cViscount. Look at me.\u201dHis eyes finally focused on me.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell you this if you were going to die.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cDo you understand what I mean?\u201d\u201cIs there a way to save me?\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Immunity cannot be used for crimes against the Imperial Household.\u201d\u201cThat is my problem.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is tell me exactly what happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026I have already told the Emperor, but to no avail.\u201dViscount Langdel weakly lifted the corners of his mouth.\u201cHe will punish me, no matter what evidence I show. To him, that woman is more important to him than the duchess.\u201dI tapped the iron bars again.\u201cTell me everything first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAs I followed the rumors about the duchess, I ended up at a village near the church where Lord Marian committed suicide.\u201dHe must have been determined to hunt it down all that way.\u201cThey were talking about the duchess and Lord Marian at a bar. I traced the story back to people who first spoke those rumors.\u201dHis expression twisted.\u201cThey all said the same thing. A noblewoman dressed in certain clothes looked a certain way and, at a certain time, visited someone. It was strange. Everyone said the exact same thing, when real truth can sometimes change when passed through several people\u2019s mouths. Besides, didn\u2019t it happen long ago?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI intentionally trapped the question, and asked the same question to everyone separately. As expected, once they broke off from the prepared answer, they were unable to match responses.\u201dSomeone must have given them money to rekindle the rumors.\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t enough to tell me who did it. I didn\u2019t even think that woman was the culprit at the time.\u201dHis eyes shone fiercely.\u201cSo I brought pictures of those who were recently active in society, and asked the people to point their finger to who paid them. I had them pick out the pictures separately, with the assumption they would all cover for the same person. There was only one picture that was not chosen.\u201dRashta would not have been in the lineup, as she had been in the palace this whole time.\u201cIt was Viscount Roteschu.\u201dViscount Langdel seemed unable to suppress his hatred.\u201cThat woman was the one who instructed him to spread those rumors.\u201d\u201cWhy did you think it was Rashta?\u201d\u201cViscount Roteschu didn\u2019t even have a place in society until he became entangled with that woman. First he insults her, then he goes around praising her. Then the poor lord goes around spending lots of money.\u201d\u201cDid you tell any of this to the Emperor?\u201d\u201cYes. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cDid you investigate this by yourself? Do you have any reports?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cMy study desk\u2026it\u2019s just inside the drawer.\u201dAfter a pause, I went outside and called Sir Artina.\u201cGo to Viscount Langdel\u2019s mansion and find an investigation report. It\u2019s in the drawer of his study. Immediately.\u201dAfter Sir Artina left, I returned to Viscount Langdel\u2019s cell. He looked at me questioningly.\u201cWhy the report?\u201d\u201cI think I can use it to save you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to fully process my words at first, but then his eyes filled with tears.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania was the one who asked me to save you.\u201dA look of surprise flitted across his face before he began to cry.\u201cHow is she?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs she not upset because of me?\u201dThe viscount truly seemed to love the duchess. Looking more miserable than before, he put his forehead on his knee and sniffed. To love a woman even when his life was at stake\u2026His actions against Rashta were far from chivalrous, but his feelings towards Duchess Tuania were strong.\u201cYou are not entirely innocent.\u201dViscount Langdel took his head off his knee and looked at me.\u201cI can change your punishment into exile.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cTell me if you have anything to pack. I\u2019ll inform your butler.\u201d***When I returned to my room, I wrote down the list of items Viscount Langdel requested. I then summoned a lady-in-waiting close to Duchess Tuania, and ordered her to go to Viscount Langdel\u2019s mansion and deliver my note to the butler. Not long after the lady-in-waiting left, Sir Artina returned.\u201cWhile I was collecting the documents, I saw the palace investigators on horseback.\u201d\u201cDid you run into them?\u201d\u201cI stayed away just in case.\u201dSovieshu would try to bury the results of Langdel\u2019s investigation.\u201cWell done.\u201dI took the report from Sir Artina and skimmed it. It was as the viscount said, with the exception of one section.\u2018Did Viscount Roteschu receive the Red Flame Star from Rashta and sell it to the auction house?\u2019Viscount Langdel cited the ring as proof that Viscount Roteschu was connected to Rashta\u2026.\u2018How did he know?\u2019A ring with a red jewel. Not many people knew that it belonged to the Emperor, fewer still that he gave it to Rashta. Even I didn\u2019t know until Sovieshu asked me about the Desert Flower Ring. But how did Viscount Langdel know about this?\u2018No, it\u2019s not important right now.\u2019Right now, I had to deal with Viscount Langdel\u2019s fate. I stowed the report in a secret drawer in my desk and headed to the central palace. I went to Sovieshu\u2019s office instead of my own. He was studying his papers with a thoughtful expression, when he looked up at me in surprise.\u201cEmpress? What happened?\u201dSovieshu didn\u2019t seem to know about my visit to Viscount Langdel yet.\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about Viscount Langdel.\u201d\u201c\u2026The Empress should not interfere.\u201d\u201cChange his punishment from execution to exile.\u201d\u201cI said do not interfere.\u201dSovieshu spoke in a firm tone and waved his hand as if he found the conversation annoying.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re here to talk about, leave.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cThere are many reasons for me to be upset right now, but Rashta is pregnant. Viscount Langdel may not have intended it, but he almost killed my baby.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it matter why he did it?\u201d\u201cNo. His reasons don\u2019t matter to me, only that my baby almost died.\u201dHe pointed his finger at the door.\u201cSo if you\u2019re here to fight, get out.\u201d\u201cThen I suppose I\u2019ll have to handle the results of Viscount Langdel\u2019s investigation myself.\u201dI turned around and took a few steps towards the door, when Sovieshu stopped me.\u201cWait. What do you mean, handle the results of the investigation yourself?\u201d\u201cThe reason he stabbed Miss Rashta. The case of the false rumors about Duchess Tuania.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAn incident separate from your baby\u2019s near death.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)Sovieshu stared at me for a moment, then let out a laugh.\u201cWhat do you mean? Will the Empress spread bad rumors about Rashta unless I change Viscount Langdel\u2019s punishment to exile?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m just trying to prepare a report. Oh, do you know there\u2019s a report?\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll fall for that?\u201d\u201cFall for it or not, it doesn\u2019t matter. You will handle Viscount Langdel according to law, and I intend to deal with Miss Rashta according to the law.\u201d\u201cAnd how will you do that?\u201d\u201cMiss Rashta spread false information to discredit Duchess Tuania, encouraged the Duke to divorce her, and undermined the duchess\u2019 reputation in society. She\u2019s aggressive enough to buy people. For this she must be locked up in jail and whipped.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s gaze could sting one\u2019s skin. He seemed to find my suggestion genuinely preposterous.\u201cNo matter how much you hate Rashta, how can you defend someone that\u2019s tried to kill her?\u201dSovieshu glared at me with a face like thunder.\u201cThe same as you if you were defending someone whose honor was intentionally destroyed.\u201d\u201cAre those equivalent? What Rashta does is common in society.\u201d\u201cThen everyone will understand if this happens. It\u2019s common in society.\u201d\u201cFor you to say this\u2026\u201dSovieshu turned away, breathing deeply. He cooled down a little, then turned sharply back towards me.\u201cDoes the Empress have no compassion?\u201d\u201cI do. That is why I\u2019m trying to save Viscount Langdel.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201dSovieshu glowered at me instead of answering, and I raised my eyebrows questioningly.\u201cDoes the Emperor have compassion only for Rashta?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou always ask me, \u2018Don\u2019t you feel sorry for Miss Rashta?\u2019\u201dIt was meant to be a biting response, but Sovieshu did not immediately answer. It wasn\u2019t just compassion he had for her.For a moment we stared at each other in silence. Sovieshu seemed to be in internal conflict with himself. He was mad at me, and he didn\u2019t want to have Rashta whipped, but he also didn\u2019t want to let go of Viscount Langdel\u2026\u201cVery well.\u201dAfter a long pause, Sovieshu finally surrendered. However, somehow I was not happy with my victory.\u201cThere is a condition.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cThe report. Give it to me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you after Viscount Langdel leaves.\u201dI replied with as much calm as possible. Sovieshu\u2019s jaw tightened, then he rang a bell on his desk. The door opened and a secretary came in.\u201cI will change the punishment on Viscount Langdel. He will be exiled, not executed.\u201dSovieshu raised his eyebrows at me expectantly. Instead of answering, I bowed courteously and left the office.I had completed a lot of work, and it wasn\u2019t even evening yet. The sky was still bright and people were bustling about. The world was peaceful in the hours of a man\u2019s life being decided. During this time, everyone was busy talking about the emperor\u2019s first baby.My heart filled with unexplainable emotions, and I stared towards the eastern palace. Somewhere in there lay Rashta. Although she had not yet awakened, her world had changed. A childless concubine could easily be abandoned by the emperor. However, a concubine with children had a connection left, even if the emperor\u2019s heart cools and she quits the concubine life.\u201c\u2026\u201dI won the battle against Sovieshu and succeeded saving Viscount Langdel. Why didn\u2019t I feel relieved? I sighed and turned around.\u201cQueen?\u201dAs soon as I turned around, I saw Queen was sitting on a rock, holding a proper letter envelope in his beak. A few people passed by, and he ducked behind the bushes. When they were gone, he emerged again, and I was so confused that I laughed. I approached him, and Queen placed the envelope in my hand and flew away.\u2018I was going to hug him.\u2019After pulling away my outstretched arms, I sat on a bench and opened the envelope. Unlike the previous short notes, it contained a proper letter this time.-My elder brother\u2019s not feeling well. I worry.-Do you remember the blue-haired knight? He\u2019s my knight, secretary and cousin, and he seems to want to be my enemy these days.-How to get revenge on those who hurt you. 1. How about making a beautiful, well-known, respected man as your lover?-How to get revenge on those who hurt you. 2. Ask Prince Heinley.Perhaps because it was not a note, the content was longer than usual, although it was written in fragmented pieces. It was also unclear whether I should laugh or not. The story of revenge and the blue-haired knight were interesting, but his brother was sick\u2026Prince Heinley\u2019s older brother was the king of the Western Kingdom, and was apparently not feeling well. If he worsened, Prince Heinley may have to go back home and stand by as the successor.The thought of Prince Heinley and Queen leaving made me feel sick. Although we had known each other only recently, I felt the most comfortable with them.\u201cWhy the long face?\u201dA voice spoke from my side. Startled, I turned and saw Prince Heinley with a wicked smile on his face, and behind him was the blue-haired knight. The knight bowed when our eyes met, and Prince Heinley approached and offered me his arm.\u201cDo you mind if I walk with you for a while, Queen?\u201dI thought it would help me relax. I rose up from the bench and took his arm, feeling his muscles flex beneath my hand. My eyes unknowingly glanced downwards. All I saw was clothes. I\u2019ve been escorted by others several times, but\u2026Prince Heinley had amazing muscles. While he looked quite slender on the surface, but he was surprisingly solid underneath.\u2018You\u2019re crazy, Navier! How can you think that of a person escorting you?\u2019My face was flushed with shame, and Prince Heinley turned to me curiously.\u201cAre you hot, Queen?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour face is red.\u201d\u201cAh yes\u2026it\u2019s a little hot.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, there was a cold breeze and goose flesh popped on my skin. Prince Heinley\u2019s knight sneezed from behind us, and I bit my lip in embarrassment. My face was hot at the sound of Prince Heinley holding back his laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)\u201cYou must be healthy, Queen. You won\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026A little.\u201dI awkwardly clutched his arm, and Prince Heinley gave a faint laugh. I squeezed my skirt tightly and held up my chin before steering the conversation in a different direction.\u201cYour letter needs some exercise. You must be worried.\u201d\u201cPuhu\u2014\u201d\u201c!\u201dI really just wanted to pass out for the next five hours. My head was scrambled about the contents of the letter. But the words already left my mouth, and Prince Heinley was desperately biting his lips to hold back the laughter.\u201cYes. I had a lot of trouble choosing strong stationery. I had to make sure it wasn\u2019t torn in Queen\u2019s beak.\u201dAlthough he tried to remain calm, his straight face collapsed at his joke. I scowled, and Prince Heinley tried to wave his hand apologetically. But he was still busy laughing.\u201cSor\u2014haha\u2014sorry.\u201d\u201cI said it wrong.\u201d\u201cI know. You wanted to ask me if I exercised a lot, didn\u2019t you, Queen?\u201d\u201cNo, I was going to ask about your brother\u2019s health.\u201d\u201cWell, my brother doesn\u2019t exercise much.\u201dReally\u2026this prince? I stopped because I didn\u2019t like playing games.I made my expression cold, Prince Heinley immediately sobered.\u201cMy brother said he was feeling worse than before. He\u2019s not in danger yet, but he has always been weak.\u201d\u201cThank goodness\u201d would be a bad response. Just because his brother wasn\u2019t in danger yet, didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t be in danger later on. I had an anxious expression on my face, and Prince Heinley smiled as if to lighten the atmosphere.\u201cHave you thought about my suggestion?\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201cHow to get revenge, one and two.\u201dHe cleared his throat loudly.\u201cI recommend number one.\u201d\u201cYou mean have a beautiful, respectable man as my lover?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want a fake lover\u2026\u201dThe prince\u2019s voice trailed off as he looked at me, and I suddenly wondered if the fake lover referred to himself. I knew he didn\u2019t like Sovieshu. However, he had been teasing me earlier so I paid him in kind.\u201cAre you referring to Grand Duke Kapmen?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cNot Grand Duke Kapmen.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cBut are there any other beautiful, respectable and great men?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHeinley pouted his lips earnestly, and I leaned in close to his face as if to inspect how handsome he was. I burst out laughing, and I grinned at him to see if he understood my joke.\u201cAre you joking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201c!\u201dSo that was why Prince Heinley teased me earlier. It is quite fun to see his reaction.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cI am?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to look like I\u2019m having an affair I someone don\u2019t want.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was that part of a joke?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHis face turned sullen. I felt bad for teasing him, but he looked quite cute rather than pitiful. I walked side-by-side with him, forcing myself to hold back my laughter.After that, we walked wordlessly all the way to the Crystal House. I don\u2019t know why Prince Heinley didn\u2019t say anything, but I couldn\u2019t find time to talk because I was looking around. The sky was especially beautiful today. It became awash with red as the sun went down, and Crystal House glistened like a giant ruby.I watched the scene for a moment. I\u2019ve seen it several times before, but my mind was blank and I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say.\u201cIf I go to the Western Kingdom\u2026\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s cautious voice broke the silence. I turned my head and saw him looking at me. Perhaps it was because the sky was dimming, but his violet eyes looked darker than usual.\u201cWestern Kingdom\u2026?\u201d\u201cWill you miss me?\u201dThe sound of bird cries echoed from afar, and I stared at him as I processed his question. Return to the Western Kingdom?That\u2019s right. Prince Heinley was the successor and he would eventually have to go back to his country, taking Queen with him.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was as if I stopped hearing. Was I too used to them? I already felt a sense of loss with the knowledge that my friends would go to a faraway place. Why was this? Come to think of it, I never truly parted with friends and family before. While I hadn\u2019t seen my family much since I married, they were never far away.\u201c\u2026I will miss you.\u201dI managed to keep my composure, and as I listened to my voice it sounded like a courteous remark.\u201cSincerely.\u201dPrince Heinley gave a sad smile.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving right now.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how to reply. I turned my head back to the ruby-like roof. When I glanced sideways, I saw Prince Heinley taking out a watch and checking the time.\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201dHe offered me his arm again to escort me back to the western palace.***Sovieshu stared intently at the report sitting on the desk in front of him. Marquis Karl, his chief secretary, stood by his side and looked at him in concern.\u201cYour Majesty, are you considering what to do with Miss Rashta?\u201d\u201cWhat can I do? Do you want me to punish a pregnant woman?\u201dBut the Emperor had been thinking for two hours already\u2026Marquis Carl carefully offered his opinion.\u201cWhile it\u2019s an unexpected matter, Your Majesty, a low-rank concubine wishing to live in high society must be able to defend herself to some degree.\u201d\u201cDefend\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard that the Duchess and Ms. Rashta confronted each other at the tea party. Wouldn\u2019t that be something worthy of punishment?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well.\u201dSovieshu frowned in thought.\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about what will happen in the future, why don\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d\u201cMarquis Karl.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. \u201d\u201cThis is my business, not yours.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dSovieshu sighed and handed the report to Marquis Karl.\u201cShould I destroy the report?\u201dIt was clear that that was what Sovieshu would ask of him.However, after thinking for another moment, Sovieshu gave an unexpected answer.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll keep it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This surprise news was given to her as soon as she woke up. Rashta covered her belly with her hands.\u201cI\u2019m pregnant\u2026\u201d\u201cIt may be scary because it\u2019s your first pregnancy, but\u2026thank you.\u201dSovieshu leaned down and embraced Rashta tightly. He could feel her trembling in his arms, and he rubbed her back and repeatedly murmured his gratitude for her. He had always wanted a baby, and he had always wanted to be a father. Apart from simply needing a successor to the throne, a happy family was his ideal dream. How was it that a concubine that had only been in his life for a few months made it come true?But despite his happiness, harbored a sense of unease. The best plan was to have a child with the Empress first. A concubine\u2019s children could not be successors, but the relationship between parent and child can not be severed so easily. Clever bastard children were the seeds of many quarrels. Sovieshu never wanted that to happen among his generations. With an illegitimate child born first, he was both happy and anxious.\u201cYour Majesty, we have our baby here\u2026\u201dBut Sovieshu could not share his concerns to the mother of his baby. He placed his hand on Rashta\u2019s stomach with a smile, pushing away his unease.\u201cIsn\u2019t this incredible?\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t feel anything yet\u2026but it\u2019s amazing.\u201dThe palace doctor standing to the side spoke up carefully.\u201cMiss Rashta, were you having irregular periods?\u201dShe nodded.\u201cYes, so I never thought about getting pregnant. It was always irregular\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll prepare you medicine and healthy foods. For the time being, please focus on your prescribed diet.\u201dThe doctor left, and Sovieshu seated himself by Rashta\u2019s side.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you want to eat, anything you want to have, just tell me.\u201d\u201cAnything?\u201d\u201cWhen a mother is happy, so will the baby.\u201d\u201c!\u201dAt that moment, tears started to fill her eyes.\u201cRashta?\u201dSovieshu looked at her in surprise, but Rashta curled up and buried her face on her knees.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you sick? Should I call back the doctor?\u201d\u201cNo, not that\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to hear that.\u201d\u201cRashta?\u201dSovieshu was bewildered by her reaction, and he lifted her chin. She wasn\u2019t crying cutely as usual, instead her body wracked with sobs as if she couldn\u2019t care less what she looked like. After crying hard for a long time, Rashta threw herself into Sovieshu\u2019s arms.\u201cYou\u2019re Rashta\u2019s savior, Your Majesty. You don\u2019t know how much Rashta loves you.\u201dHowever, Rashta\u2019s soaring happiness plummeted after she met with Duke Elgy the next day. She was grateful for his help, but when he spoke to her it was with a grave expression.\u201cI\u2019ve been to Rimwell, Miss. The child that Viscount Roteschu is keeping\u2026I think that\u2019s your baby.\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes grew wide. She never had words of congratulations when she had her first child, but now it was like a needle in her heart.\u201cDid you ask the Church for an examination?\u201dRashta covered her belly with her hands. She was afraid that the eldest child, born unloved, would grab the ankle of the second child, who would live in love. Duke Elgy shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s no examination\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was a baby boy. He looks just like you.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe blood drained from Rashta\u2019s face. Now that it was true, there was nothing to be done except to give Viscount Roteschu money in return for his silence.As he looked down at Rashta, Duke Elgy smiled and made a suggestion.\u201cAs I\u2019ve told you before, I can lend you the money you need, Miss.\u201dHe made it sound so easy. Rashta, who was not able to afford the money right away, was terrified.\u201cHow much?\u201dIn the past, she had been very cautious about borrowing money. However, things had changed. She was now carrying the Emperor\u2019s baby, and she was wildly happy. The money would be available in a few years, and she had to prevent Viscount Roteschu from entering her life no matter the cost.\u201cAny amount.\u201dRashta hesitated for a moment.\u201cThen is it possible to borrow a thousand krangs\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lend you ten thousand.\u201dHe sat down and took a piece of paper out of his pocket, then placed it on the table. It was an unsigned promissory note. He wrote his name and signature and put \u201c10,000 krangs\u201d on the amount.\u201cHere.\u201dHe then took out two 5,000 krang slips from his breast pocket. It was issued from the top credit lender on the Wol continent.\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dRashta signed the promissory note from Duke Elgy and accepted the slips. This would keep Viscount Roteschu\u2019s mouth shut for at least a little while.\u201cYou\u2019ll get worn out if you kept getting swept away, so think of a means to shake it off.\u201d\u201cIs there a good way\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell, in this case, I don\u2019t know.\u201dDuke Elgy stood up a gave a word of encouragement to Rashta, who smiled at him. As he was leaving the room, his hand stopped on the doorknob and he and turned back.\u201cBut Miss.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe baby in your womb now. I wonder if it\u2019s a daughter or son?\u201d***\u201cI see\u2026she\u2019s awake.\u201dIt was evening time. After work, Laura delivered to me the news that Rashta was safe. The lady-in-waiting also added that Sovieshu gave Rashta a large armchair as a gift. I sat in front of my desk and smiled as calmly as possible, but the other ladies-in-waiting stopped playing chess and flocked to my side for more gossip. It turned out that Rashta wasn\u2019t the only news of the day.\u201cDuchess Tuania has decided to divorce the Duke. They couldn\u2019t agree on anything, however, so they went to court over property division.\u201d\u201cViscount Langdel was exiled yesterday, Her Majesty.\u201dBut the most unexpected news was not even about them.\u201cYour Majesty, what do you think of Viscount Roteschu? The man who claimed Rashta was a slave.\u201dRashta\u2019s old master\u2026While the topic of him was long buried, I wasn\u2019t ignorant of him. But why suddenly bring him up now? The lady-in-waiting leaned in and whispered to the group.\u201cI heard that Viscount Roteschu wants to move to the capital city. He\u2019s looking for a house near the palace.\u201dAs soon as I heard those words, my mind turned to Rashta. Although Sovieshu had forced Viscount Roteschu to renounce his claim that Rashta was his slave, their past relationship would never be gone. Viscount Roteschu had even gone around manipulating information about Duchess Tuania for Rashta. And now he was moving near the palace?\u2018Is Rashta being blackmailed?\u2019As I stewed over this information, Laura cut in with her own gossip.\u201cI heard that he\u2019s not only looking for a house, but a nanny as well. Does he have a baby at home?\u201dI didn\u2019t want to say this out loud, but\u2026I didn\u2019t want to get involved, even if Rashta was being threatened. I\u2019ll only focus on myself. It would be difficult if she asked Sovieshu for help, but she was not my job.As I listened to the conversation on Rashta, I opened my drawer and rummaged through my items.\u2018Oh?\u2019Something rolled into my hand. When I pulled it out, it was a pretty pink bottle about the size of my palm.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that from before?\u201dLaura, who had been talking about Viscount Roteschu, diverted her attention.\u201cWasn\u2019t it a gift? It\u2019s a love potion, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI didn\u2019t use it as the sender was anonymous, and left it in my drawer and completely forgot about it. After I received it, I went to the villa, and then Sovieshu got sick, and so on.\u201cYou didn\u2019t open it at all, did you?\u201d\u201cI believe it\u2019s just a joke.\u201dLaura came near and peered at the bottle. She seemed curious about the love potion.\u201cCould it be real?\u201d\u201cOf course not. If it were real, people would talk about it.\u201d\u201cBut there are all kinds of things in this world, Her Majesty.\u201dIf there was a true love potion, wouldn\u2019t there at least be rumors? I looked at the bottle hesitatingly, and Laura had an encouraging expression in her eyes.\u201cTry it, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cEven if I use this, there\u2019s no situation for me to use it for\u2026\u201dI trailed off nervously. In response, Laura mouthed, \u2018Emperor.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His gaze was completely fixed on Sovieshu, as if I had disappeared from the earth. The potion seemed to work, and now Grand Duke Kapmen was in love with Sovieshu. The normally brusque-mannered man was now staring at the Emperor with a misty-eyed expression.Alarmed, Sovieshu stepped back and swiftly turned towards me.\u201cWhy is he doing that?\u201dCould I say anything about the potion?Grand Duke Kapmen approached Sovieshu and smiled at him.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you like this.

At least that\u2019s how it feels. \u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cWhen I look at you, all I see are your lips, neck, and beautiful eyes. And when I breathe\u2026What perfume do you use? It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe potion truly had a powerful effect. Grand Duke Kapmen, in attempt to stem the babbling flowing from his mouth, closed his eyes and pressed his fingers on his temple before continuing.\u201cThis is the situation now, so please leave. If I don\u2019t smell you, I\u2019ll be fine soon. Then I can go back to my room and take the antidote.\u201dHe clenched his fists and sweat beaded on his tanned skin. I nodded and quickly let myself out of the room. I gave a fleeting glance backwards. The door remained closed.When I returned to my room, I felt a strange sensation inside of me. If you are loved by someone, would they still listen to you from the other side of the door? How would it feel to have someone go crazy because of you?I became restless because I had never experienced it before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An expression that looked like curiously like\u2026excitement.Dilated pupils, red nose, trembling lips\u2026\u201cGrand Duke?\u201d\u201cCall me Kapmen.\u201d\u201c?!\u201d\u201cDamn it. Don\u2019t listen to me. More effective than I thought\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d\u201cGrand Duke\u2026\u201d\u201cCall me Kapmen\u2026no, please go. \u201dI looked at him in confusion, and he waved his hands quickly in the air.\u201cThe potion is more effective than I thought. Right now, I love you to the point where I\u2019m willing to risk a strange misunderstanding from your husband to protect you. At least that\u2019s how it feels. \u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cWhen I look at you, all I see are your lips, neck, and beautiful eyes. And when I breathe\u2026What perfume do you use? It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe potion truly had a powerful effect. Grand Duke Kapmen, in attempt to stem the babbling flowing from his mouth, closed his eyes and pressed his fingers on his temple before continuing.\u201cThis is the situation now, so please leave. If I don\u2019t smell you, I\u2019ll be fine soon. Then I can go back to my room and take the antidote.\u201dHe clenched his fists and sweat beaded on his tanned skin. I nodded and quickly let myself out of the room. I gave a fleeting glance backwards. The door remained closed.When I returned to my room, I felt a strange sensation inside of me. If you are loved by someone, would they still listen to you from the other side of the door? How would it feel to have someone go crazy because of you?I became restless because I had never experienced it before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We hadn\u2019t the chance to talk afterwards.\u201dThe lady-in-waiting gave a sympathetic nod before leaving, and I sat at the table to wait for her to report back. Grand Duke Kapmen said yesterday he would return to his room and drink the antidote, so he should be fine by now. I was more worried if he came across Sovieshu again yesterday.To my surprise, the lady-in-waiting did not return alone, but was accompanied by Grand Duke Kapmen. I went to the parlor room to greet him.He looked somewhat different than yesterday. He normally wore comfortable, practical outfits, but today his attire was much finer, and his was hair also meticulously combed back, emphasizing his strong jawline. When I looked into his eyes, I noticed they were moist again.\u201cAre you all right\u2026?\u201dKapmen didn\u2019t look well, but I asked him anyway out of politeness. He shook his head and asked for a private conversation. I nodded, and the ladies-in-waiting left as quick as they could. When we were alone, he spoke in a tight voice, as if exhausted from heavy restraint.\u201cI missed you. I was dying to see you\u2026no, listen.\u201dImmediately following the humiliating words came an awkward smile. Still, he seemed more in control than yesterday, and I had him seated at a table.\u201cIs there no antidote?\u201dIn all honesty, while his predicament was amusing, I was far more worried about him. It was my first time seeing that human eyes could be filled with such affection, but Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s current behavior would look strange to any outside observers. The problem was, he was obligated to keep meeting me for our diplomatic negotiations.\u201cThere is. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026do you have another antidote? The other antidote could be the wrong one.\u201dI thought would be suspicious if he had the correct antidote in the first place. Instead of answering, however, Grand Duke Kapmen put his hands together and awkwardly stared out the window.\u201cGrand Duke?\u201dWas this the effect of medicine? He looked quite sheepish.\u201cWould you like me to cover my face?\u201dI looked at him anxiously, but he shook his head.\u201cNo. Then I just won\u2019t be able to see your face. It won\u2019t work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDid the mean the potion worked even when I\u2019m not in front of him? The potion was influencing his words, but he sounded clear here\u2026what should I do?In any case, it was hugely embarrassing. The speaker must be experiencing a more hellish feeling.\u201cIt\u2019s not the wrong antidote.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so sure? It wasn\u2019t an antidote for a love potion, was it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy didn\u2019t he answer? Surely\u2026\u201cIt was?\u201dI looked at him in astonishment, and he pursed his lips.\u201cYes.\u201dMy eyes widened. Why did Grand Duke Kapmen already have an antidote for that specific drug? He nervously tapped the table with his fingertips before making a confession.\u201cIt was a gift from me.\u201d\u201cThe love potion?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I didn\u2019t expect its effect to be this powerful.\u201dMy mouth opened in surprise as I processed the information. Grand Duke Kapmen was the anonymous sender of the love potion. I knew the duke was behaving oddly now because of the potion, but he would have been sober when he first sent it to me.My mind blanked on a suitable response, and when Grand Duke Kapmen spoke it was in a stiff voice.\u201cIt was frustrating.\u201d\u201cFrustrating\u2026 ?\u201dAh.\u201cIs this about me, Sovieshu and Rashta?\u201dI remembered the time when Grand Duke Kapmen had ignored both me and Rashta, then left as if I wasn\u2019t good enough. Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s shoulders dropped.\u201cI know it was foolish, but I didn\u2019t like to see you struggling. \u201dSo the love potion was some kind of consolation? It was hard to tell if he was serious. I stared at him, but he looked away with a frown on his face.An embarrassed silence cloaked the room, punctuated only by the unusually loud ticking of the clock. Finally, Grand Duke Kapmen heaved a sigh.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t keep further company with you. I keep becoming interested in you, and I shouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave now?\u201d\u201cCan I hold you?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dHe stood up from his seat and walked to the door, and I followed him from behind. He half-opened the door, then suddenly turned back.The wildness in his dark gaze left me stunned.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAn oppressive silence reigned, and when I swallowed it was like dry needles in my throat. The look in his eyes were not the same as those of his usual indifference and pity, nor the ones of yesterday\u2019s anxiety.Laura\u2019s words drifted to the front of my mind: love someone who can love you back with the intensity of a man starved for a hundred years. That was exactly how Grand Duke Kapmen was looking at me.He raised his hand to cover his eyelids.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t run into each other until the effects disappear by themselves.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dIt seemed that way to me.***The man on his knees had been speaking for quite a while now, but his story didn\u2019t quite enter my ears. He finally said, \u201cMy God\u2026\u201d then dissolved into tears. At the sight, I immediately felt pity for him. His situation must have been serious if he came all this way to the audience chamber, out of tens of thousands of people who clamored to step foot in here. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. My heart broke in sympathy, so I gathered the fractured bits of his story in my head and pieced it together. I gave my words of sincere consolation and the man sobbed again.After the final visitor left, the officials closed the heavy door of the audience chamber.I sighed and touched my forehead. Few people came to the audience room to give good news. Why not bless a baby? They all came to give unjust, outrageous and sad stories. As a result, it was not easy to concentrate fully on them as I worried about a dozen other problems. Just like today.I slowly rose from the throne.\u201cIs your joke over?\u201dBefore I could fully stand up, however, Sovieshu spoke and I lowered myself back into my seat. I gave him a questioning look, and he leaned back on his throne and looked at me with cold eyes.\u201cOn hindsight, I was completely deceived.\u201d\u201cDeceived?\u201d\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen. His face was red\u2014but was it from looking at the Empress?\u201d\u201cTo my eyes, he looked like that when he saw you. No?\u201d\u201c!\u201dSovieshu recoiled in disgust, I quickly left my seat this time. Before I exited the audience chamber, I looked back and saw Sovieshu watching me. I kept my expression as smooth as possible when I closed the door.I turned around, and this time I saw Prince Heinley leaning against a pillar, as if waiting for me. When our eyes met, he smiled quietly and lifted the documents he was holding.\u201cI came here to talk to you about something. Will that be alright?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Prince Heinley fell into step beside me.\u201cWhat kind of documents are those?\u201dI assume he waited for me to discuss something, but Prince Heinley did not show me the papers. When I reached out my hand to take them, he pulled them from my fingertips with a small laugh.\u201cStop fooling around. What is it?\u201dPrince Heinley chuckled again and then handed over the documents.\u201c!\u201dI looked at the papers, then looked back at him in surprise. The document had a cover, but there was nothing inside. I stared at him in bewilderment, and he smiled apologetically.\u201cI apologize. I thought it was more natural if we met this way.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to fool around like this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything that makes Queen feel uncomfortable.\u201dI gave a sideways glance at him, and noticed that he was looking at me. His expression was soft and his violet eyes were lit with an unusual warmth. I handed the documents back to him awkwardly and he accepted it, but his gaze didn\u2019t break. I pushed his cheek away, and he turned his head straight and laughed.\u201cThen why are you here if there\u2019s nothing to talk about?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s not true. I do have something to discuss.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI had a feeling that it wasn\u2019t about anything good. His smiling face instantly turned gloomy, and he scratched his chin as he struggled to find his words. He seemed to be debating with himself whether it was alright to speak or not.\u201cPrince Heinley?\u201d\u201cI told you a few days ago that my brother wasn\u2019t in good health.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOh.\u201cIs he worse?\u201d\u201cIt seems so. I\u2019ve received another letter again, but now it\u2019s bad.\u201d\u201c!\u201dMy feet stopped walking before I even realized it. The health of the Western King was a serious matter that might bring political repercussions to the Eastern Empire, not to mention the grief of my personal friend Prince Heinley\u2026Under these circumstances, I shouldn\u2019t want to stop Prince Heinley returning to the West. If he became king, our meetings would likely be sparse in the future, and we would never be able to talk so familiarly to each other as we did now.The thought did not ease my sorrow. I looked at him with an uneasy expression.\u201cThen\u2026are you returning to the Western Kingdom?\u201d\u201cNot immediately. But probably soon.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s brow furrowed.\u201cI have to go before my brother dies to hear his will.\u201dThe king must be in serious condition if he was giving his will.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you leave quickly then?\u201dNow I was really worried about the king\u2019s health, but Prince Heinley unhappily kicked the stones on the ground.\u201cPrince?\u201d\u201cSometimes the weight of things is different\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dWith a sigh, he immediately shook his head and gave a heavy smile.It was then\u2014\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dThere was a rustling sound and Grand Duke Kapmen strode up towards us. I was taken aback by his sudden appearance.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t be around me when he was still under the potion\u2019s influence, and I was afraid that Prince Heinley might misunderstand our relationship. No, not just him, but anyone else too.\u201cYes. I came out to cool off.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen replied calmly and looked up and down at Prince Heinley. I recognized the duke\u2019s expression from the New Year\u2019s ball. It was a critical eye that judged one\u2019s opponent in detail.Prince Heinley also frowned. I hastily pulled him away and gave a short goodbye to Grand Duke Kapmen, then turned back to Heinley.\u201cLet\u2019s keep walking. We have more to talk about.\u201dI was worried that love-stricken Grand Duke Kapmen might say something strange to Prince Heinley. However, I failed to separate the two. Grand Duke Kapmen reached out his hand, in expectation that I would step away from Prince Heinley. Prince Heinley looked dumbfounded, and his lip curled in warning.\u201cLeave her.\u201dIt was me who held onto Prince Heinley\u2019s arm, but Grand Duke Kapmen spoke as if it were the opposite. The drug that coursed through the duke\u2019s blood strongly clouded his reason.\u201cYou. Is this the behavior of a grand duke from the Hwa continent?\u201dPrince Heinley laughed as if he found the whole situation absurd. However, Grand Duke Kapmen stepped between me and Prince Heinley without an answer.I couldn\u2019t help but feel small while the two large men stared down at each other. The atmosphere between them was so ugly it was difficult to intervene.\u201cHow strange. Queen was standing in front of me, so why is this man here?\u201d\u201cJealousy.\u201d\u201cJealousy?\u201dI almost choked and I tugged on the hem of Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s clothes. I was afraid that at this rate, he would even say he loved me.\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen. Prince Heinley. Stop it.\u201dDespite my efforts to pull his clothes, Grand Duke Kapmen glared at Prince Heinley with cold eyes, and Prince Heinley returned him a challenging look. His usual smile was replaced with a look of thunder. It seemed to be the prelude of a fight.\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen. Please don\u2019t do anything you\u2019ll regret later.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI felt sorry for him in the end, but I kicked his heel with the toe of my shoe. He jerked towards me as if he were coming back to his senses, but at the moment, Prince Heinley pushed him aside.\u201cPrince!\u201dDespite my protest, he gave a grin that didn\u2019t fit the current situation.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Queen?\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t push him.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t see you at all with this guy in front of me.\u201dHowever, he gave an apologetic sigh.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you mad at me for pushing him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not angry\u2014\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley isn\u2019t fit to associate himself with you.\u201dWas it starting again? My head hurt. Just as I was hoping it would calm down, it escalated again.Prince Heinley stared at Grand Duke Kapmen with a grin. He looked scary even when he smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I gave a worried glance at Sir Artina, who nodded his head and gently squeezed the hilt of his sword. At that moment\u2014\u201cYour Highness! Your Highness!\u201dSomeone came running from a distance and was calling to the prince. I turned around, and saw it was the blue-haired knight that often followed Prince Heinley. Sir McKenna, was it?He stopped in front of us, gasping for breath before speaking urgently.\u201cYour Highness, I think you should go now!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dSir McKenna hesitated as he looked at Grand Duke Kapmen. The knight seemed unsure whether he should speak in front of him.I turned to Prince Heinley and nodded at him.\u201cGo quickly.\u201dI would rather he hurried, but he stared at me with a regretful look then carefully knelt on one knee. He lightly kissed the back of my hand, keeping his eyes fixed on me the entire time. Sir McKenna shifted in impatience.\u201cI\u2019ll speak to you later.\u201dHis voice was soft as he stood up, and when I nodded, he turned around and left with Sir McKenna. Unlike his slow, gentle kiss, the speed of his pace was brisk. I wondered if it had anything to do with the Western King\u2026I stared at the back of Prince Heinley\u2019s head and sighed.\u201cAre you friendly that prince?\u201dI suddenly remembered Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s presence and quickly turned to him. He was looking at me with a strange expression.\u201cAre you friendly that prince?\u201dHe repeated himself.\u201cI think he\u2019s a great man.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say I was friendly with him, but I didn\u2019t want to lie, so I gave a moderate answer. However, Kapmen\u2019s face only twisted. I observed him carefully.\u201cAre you\u2026jealous?\u201d\u201cIt seems so. I was about to grab his throat earlier.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYes, it was hard for me to control my mouth.\u201dI offered him a sympathetic smile, and he gave a careless shrug.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how much emotion drives someone.\u201d\u201c\u2026How do you feel?\u201d\u201cHave you ever been jealous?\u201d\u201cJealous\u2026\u201dSovieshu pushed me to take care of Rashta. That painful feeling in my heart\u2014was that jealousy?\u201cMaybe.\u201dAs soon as I agreed with him, Grand Duke Kapmen gave an unexpected reply.\u201cYou admit it too easily.\u201d\u201cYou were the one who was so frustrated you gave me a love potion.\u201dHe gave a bellowing laugh, and he put his hands in his pockets and lowered his gaze.\u201cDid I spoil your mood?\u201d\u201cWatching the Grand Duke struggle is not so bad\u2026 \u201d\u201cDo you find me amusing?\u201d\u201cDo I have to answer?\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen pursed his lips.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever been so intensely jealous, so let me tell you\u2014it\u2019s like something invisible is yelling next to my heart. And I want to listen to that voice.\u201d\u201d \u2026.What is it saying?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat invisible something is whispering to me now. We can\u2019t let you learn our intentions.\u201dI laughed thinking it he was joking, but I soon realized he was serious. He looked at me quietly for another moment, then gave a sigh.\u201cJust looking at one person can be very fulfilling. At the same time, it makes one feel insecure. In many ways\u2026It\u2019s a strong potion.\u201d\u201cWhen will the effects\u2014\u201dI was about to ask when the effects would fade, when I heard the sound of someone else approaching. I looked around and saw Sovieshu. His eyes were cold.\u2018Why does he look so grim? Did he overhear the conversation?\u2019\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have heard it.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen murmured a reply as if he read my mind.\u201c?!\u201dI was amazed at his timing, and he spoke again in a low voice.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t close enough to hear our words.\u201dI looked back at Sovieshu. The closer he came, the icier his expression. If he did hear the conversation, it would be a misunderstanding. Sovieshu waved his hands at the servants and knights nearby, and they stepped away.Sovieshu turned towards me.\u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen, Prince Heinley. Which one?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201dSovieshu looked at Grand Duke Kapmen with derision.\u201cTwo foreigners must be an attraction for the Empress.\u201dHe was here now, but he seemed to have been watching since Prince Heinley was present.\u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201dI cut off his words. Prince Heinley was only a friend, and although Grand Duke Kapmen had been in love with me for a while now, it was only because of the potion. Sooner or later, that would dissipate. Sovieshu didn\u2019t seem to believe me, however.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be careful of your behavior at this time?\u201d\u201cWhat is \u2018this time?\u2019\u201d\u201cThe pregnancy of an emperor\u2019s firstborn. Is this the time to have a scandal with other foreign men?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why not?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201dSovieshu frowned at me like I didn\u2019t know. I knew. It was the same reason I couldn\u2019t openly be friends with Prince Heinley. It had only been a short time since Rashta became Sovieshu\u2019s concubine, and she became pregnant with the Emperor\u2019s first child. If I had a scandal with another man at this time, salacious gossip would spread about the Imperial family, and there was no dignity involved in that. I understood the need to be careful, but it felt different when Sovieshu pointed it out.\u201cYou want me to be careful of my actions for your first child?\u201d\u201cMy first child? A baby of the Imperial family also means they\u2019re your child.\u201d\u201cNo. Whether there are a hundred or a thousand of them, your concubine\u2019s baby is not my baby.\u201d\u201cEmpress!\u201d\u201cAnd as for the birth of your child, it is your happy occasion, not mine.\u201dSovieshu stared at me with a hostile expression.\u201cAfter all, Rashta\u2019s baby can neither be an imperial prince or princess. Everyone knows that.\u201d\u201cSo if they\u2019re neither a prince nor princess, they\u2019re not a baby of the Imperial family?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s the law. And no matter how set your mind is, in fifty or one hundred years, everyone won\u2019t even know who those children are.\u201dSovieshu stared at me incredulously, then gave a hollow smile.\u201cThe Empress truly is selfish.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cNo matter how much you hate Rashta, are you already wary of her innocent unborn babies?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI wonder if the Empress even regards me as a husband\u2014\u201dBut before Sovieshu\u2019s words continued, a fist came out of nowhere and struck him on the face.It was Grand Duke Kapmen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The grand duke blocked Sovieshu\u2019s fist with his hand, but he flinched as two of his fingers bent backwards.\u201cStop it!\u201dI tried to step between the two. Sovieshu was adept at sword fighting and basic martial arts, but since he was in the emperor\u2019s office, he did not train hard. Kapmen, however, was a mage who could inevitably spend more time on research. When it came to a fight, it was obvious who would win. No, no matter who won, it would still be a problem.Fortunately, Sovieshu and Grand Duke Kapmen separated, but they continued to stare down at each other.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\u201cSeize him!\u201d\u201cAag!\u201dThe tension had eased only for a second, and then commotion flared again. Servants retreated from the scene while knights arrived at the same time. Some of the knights came to Sovieshu\u2019s side, while others surrounded Grand Duke Kapmen. Those who did drew their swords and pointed it at the foreign man. Grand Duke Kapmen stared casually at Sovieshu, despite the wall of swords surrounding him.\u201cStand down!\u201dI gave orders to the knights, but they did not listen.\u201cI order you all to stand down!\u201dI shouted again, then turned towards Sovieshu. The knights\u2019 first priority was the Emperor\u2019s safety.\u201cStand down.\u201dOnly after Sovieshu\u2019s order did the knights lower their swords, but they did not sheath their blades. They warily watched the grand duke\u2019s movements, ready to stab him the moment he posed a threat.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen held up his hands.\u201cMy major is magic, so I can attack you from here.\u201dThe knights were surprised, then narrowed their distance to the grand duke. Suddenly, under one of the men\u2019s feet, there was a flash white light and the crackling of electricity. The man was startled, and he backed away and fell to the ground, while the other knights put up their swords.Grand Duke Kapmen clenched his fist, white sparks flying and crackling from his hand as he glared at the knights threateningly. His specialty must be in electricity. The knights glanced uncertainly at each other, as they knew a fight could mean death.\u201cI said stand down.\u201dSovieshu clicked his tongue and waved his hand, and the knights finally lowered their swords again. Sovieshu, however, seemed wholly unintimidated by Grand Duke Kapmen, and looked at him with a sneer.\u201cWell, it looks like Grand Duke Kapmen has a heart for the Empress, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cOnly because I have a human heart.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it common sense to ask your partner to be friendly to a baby born from an affair?\u201d\u201cAn affair.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cDo you not know that Rashta is an official concubine?\u201d\u201cThe Empress did not give her official approval.\u201d\u201cAha. Is the only woman that the Rwibt Emperor loves his political partner? If that\u2019s the case, then I can understand that cultural difference.\u201dLittle was known about the Hwa continent, but there have been several rumors that stimulated people\u2019s interest. Among them were stories of harems among the royalty and upper aristocracy, and how they collected beautiful women to fit their tastes. The stories may have been greatly exaggerated, but it was true that harems existed. Sovieshu knew of this, and Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s brow furrowed deeply.\u201c\u2026\u201dSovieshu had a smug smile on his face, as he had succeeded in pointing out Kapmen\u2019s hypocrisy.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning, but I don\u2019t trust a man that seems to be driven by emotion. To spare your reputation, I won\u2019t imprison you.\u201dHe turned away coldly.\u201cBut I\u2019ll have to rethink my deal with Rwibt.\u201dSovieshu left with his men, leaving behind Grand Duke Kapmen, Sir Artina and I.I turned towards Grand Duke Kapmen in pity. Although he had been carried away because of the potion, it had involved me.\u201cGrand Duke, I\u2014\u201dI tried to apologize, but he firmly cut in.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. It\u2019s my fault that I was unable to overcome my emotions at that moment.\u201d***\u201cWhat happened?\u201dPrince Heinley pressed Sir McKenna as soon as they arrived at the prince\u2019s quarters. He had hurried, feeling uneasy about the situation.\u201cThere is an urgent message.\u201dMcKenna hurriedly closed the door and approached Prince Heinley standing near the table, then handed him a letter.\u201cIs it from my brother?\u201dPrince Heinley pulled the letter out of the envelope and unfolded it. His expression grew increasingly worried as he scanned the contents. McKenna stood beside Prince Heinley and carefully watched him. There was another letter sent to McKenna himself, and so he already knew the news the prince received.Wharton III, the king of the Western Kingdom, was in failing health. Prince Heinley was asked to return. After reading the letter, Prince Heinley placed the letter on the table and gave a heavy sigh.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dMcKenna scanned the prince\u2019s face, and Heinley shook his head and stared at the table.\u201cThe kingdom is stable and there is a wide gap between the Prince and the second heir to the throne\u2026but you should go home soon.\u201d\u201cI know. I have to listen to his will.\u201dPrince Heinley and Wharton III were not close as brothers, but they didn\u2019t have a terrible relationship, nor did they have a bloody race over the throne. Though their personalities were different and Heinley liked to stray from the original circle, they got along in moderation. Heinley wasn\u2019t happy to hear that his own brother was dying.It was the same with McKenna as well. Though he was a bastard cousin and could not officially be counted as the king\u2019s family, he wasn\u2019t unfeeling.\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cI have a headache.\u201dPrince Heinley pulled out a chair to sit on it, then laid his head on the table.\u201cShall I go to Emperor Sovieshu and inform him you\u2019ll be going back?\u201d\u201cI do it.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d\u201cAnd as for your letter friend\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026McKenna.\u201d\u201cYes, My Prince.\u201dPrince Heinley slightly raised his head and stared vacantly into space. Then he turned to McKenna. Sensing that Heinley\u2019s mind was in turmoil, the knight called to him carefully, \u201cPrince?\u201d\u201cWhat are the odds I\u2019ll marry her?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dThe prince sighed and buried his head on the desk again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if it was his fault that he struck first, I was in charge of diplomatic relations with him. However, I couldn\u2019t go to Sovieshu right away. He would still be emotional, and I needed for him to cool down.\u2018Let\u2019s meet tomorrow and talk.\u2019After I made my decision, I returned to my room.\u201cIs it true, Your Majesty?\u201dLaura ran up to me as soon as she saw me.\u201cIs it true that Grand Duke Kapmen and the Emperor got into a fist fight?\u201dShe grabbed both my hands, her eyes sparkling in anticipation. Before I answered, Countess Eliza interrupted.\u201cDid you already have dinner?\u201d\u201cThey did exchange blows, Lady Laura. And Countess Eliza, I don\u2019t have an appetite and will skip dinner.\u201dAfter answering each of them in turn, I took off my cumbersome gown.\u201cHow did they come to blows? I heard that they fought over you, Your Majesty. Is that true?\u201d\u201cYou should eat something. How about a clear soup?\u201dAgain, two ladies-in-waiting asked their questions almost simultaneously. Count Eliza looked at Laura with a slight frown, but Laura was determined to know the whole story.\u201cThere was only a slight misunderstanding, Lady Laura. And could you give me some vegetable soup, Countess?\u201dAgain, the two replied at the same time, and Countess Eliza stepped out of the bedroom to bring back the soup. Laura took my side and began pouring out questions again. I filled her in until she was satisfied, and then she gave a sigh.\u201cI hope that Grand Duke Kapmen likes the Empress.\u201d\u201cLady Laura.\u201d\u201cThen the Emperor will realize how important the Empress is. Of course, I feel sorry for thinking of using Grand Duke Kapmen that way too.\u201dLater that night, I wondered if Prince Heinley would send me a letter regarding his hurried departure, but one did not come. Before going to bed, Queen arrived briefly, his eyes more shadowy than usual. He allowed me to stroke his head and I asked him \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d but he gave a cry and flew away again.***The next day.After breakfast, I checked my schedule and found that it was quite full.\u2018He may be more unreasonable if I visit him in the middle of the day or right after work.\u2019After making the calculations in my head, I decided to have a conversation with Sovieshu before he went to the central palace, and so I headed towards the eastern palace. When I arrived, Sovieshu was still dressing.\u201cThe Empress came to visit me this time. This is a surprise!\u201dFortunately, he seemed calmer than he was yesterday. Our eyes met in the mirror, and he smiled quietly as he fixed a silver button. I was relieved to see his good mood.\u201cI have something to say.\u201d\u201cI suppose. You come to me only when you have something to say.\u201dHis voice was mischievous, and he batted away the servants who were helping him dress.\u201cLeave.\u201dThe servants stepped away and exited the room, closing the door behind them.\u201cYes. What brings you here?\u201d\u201cThe deal with Rwibt. Are you really going to reconsider it?\u201dSovieshu turned his head away from the mirror.\u201cAre you talking about yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d\u201cI am in charge of diplomatic relations, so I\u2019m asking.\u201dSovieshu narrowed his eyes at me.\u201cSo are you here to convince me to go ahead with the deal?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dSovieshu grabbed a comb and attempted to do his hair by himself. Whatever shape he was trying to make his hair, it didn\u2019t work. He set down the comb on the table in front of me and frowned heavily, before glancing over to me.\u201cConsider the benefits the Eastern Empire will gain from trading with Rwibt.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s hair, which did not have in product in it yet, looked soft. He tried to fix his hair to give a sharper impression.\u201cHow do you know if we\u2019re going to benefit or lose from the relationship with Rwibt?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing research. The trade with the Hwa continent has elements that can satisfy both the curiosity of the common people and the nobility.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t spend money on curiosity.\u201d\u201cNobles don\u2019t grudge spending money on curiosities. And if there\u2019s a flow of supply, common people can easily buy Rwibt\u2019s exotic goods.\u201d\u201cThe distance is enormous. Will the profit offset the cost from that?\u201d\u201cWe can make it that way.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s vague promises after all.\u201dSovieshu turned away from me again, but he kept his eyes on me through the mirror. I stared at him too. It was quiet for a moment, and his mouth twisted.\u201cEmpress. After I was hit yesterday, you didn\u2019t even ask me if I was alright.\u201d\u201cAre you alright?\u201dHe scoffed as I answered quickly.\u201cFrankly\u2026well. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cYou look fine.\u201d\u201cNo, not that. The deal with Rwibt.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re anxious about the loss, we can make a budget.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that.\u201dSo? What was eating at him? I looked at him in bewilderment, and Sovieshu stared at me with a shrewd look.\u201cIs it profit and gains that the Empress wants for the Eastern Empire? Or is it love that you\u2019ll get?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dI spoke in a firm voice, but Sovieshu remained calm. He turned back to me and walked around the table to look at me squarely in the face. His dark eyes were filled with a complicated emotion. I could see myself reflected in them, my own face smoothly calm. Maybe it was because I had practiced thoroughly\u2026?Sovieshu\u2019s eyes were cold as he spoke.\u201cWhich is it, Empress?\u201dHe slowly lifted his hand and tucked a stray strand of hair behind my ear. I avoided his gaze and said what I wanted to say all this time.\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Your Majesty. But even if I want love. It\u2019s funny. \u201d\u201c\u2026Funny?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve proudly shown off your concubine at parties, so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so obsessed with interfering with my love affairs.\u201d\u201cInterfering?\u201dSovieshu gave a harsh laugh.\u201cNot for my sake, but for Miss Rashta\u2019s.\u201dSovieshu snapped, hitting the table with his fist with a loud bang.\u201cHow can you say that? A concubine is just a concubine, and the empress is the empress.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rashta bit her lip. She stared at the door with a tearful face, then turned her heel and returned to her room.Viscount Roteschu was right. No matter how much Sovieshu loved her, Rashta was still a concubine. Her position was dependent on the fickle emotions of one man.Rashta summoned Viscountess Verdi to ask her a question.\u201cLady Verdi.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss Rashta.\u201d\u201cAmong all the emperors\u2019 concubines\u2026has anyone been loved by the emperor all her life?\u201dNormally, Rashta would have avoided exchanging words with Viscountess Verdi as much as possible. However, the viscountess seemed more familiar with these matters than the two other serving girls.They way Viscountess Verdi averted her eyes with a troubled look gave Rashta the answer she needed.\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of.\u201d\u201cBut not many, is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs Rashta started to cry, Viscountess Verdi hurried to appease her.\u201cBut it\u2019s alright, Miss Rashta. A long as you have a child, you will not be cut off from the Imperial Family even without the Emperor\u2019s favor. The baby will be your strength.\u201d\u201cRashta\u2014Rashta wants a baby that she can love and care for! I don\u2019t want to use the baby that way!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026\u201dThere was a soft knock. Rashta closed her mouth, and the door to the parlor room opened and Cherily came in.\u201cMiss Rashta, Viscount Roteschu is here.\u201dRashta dismissed Viscountess Verdi from the room and allowed Viscount Roteschu in. She was still upset, and seeing the viscount made her even more so, but she was unable to throw him out.\u201cWhy are you here this time?\u201dRashta didn\u2019t bother hiding her contempt, but Viscount Roteschu seemed wholly unperturbed.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of moving.\u201dShe had heard he was looking for a house to live in the capital. She spoke through her clenched teeth.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI need a house.\u201d\u201cHow much do you need?\u201dRashta remembered the money Duke Elgy lent her. Ten thousand krangs was a large sum. She didn\u2019t know how much a house cost, but\u2026\u201cHmm. I think about half a million krangs.\u201d\u201cHalf a million?\u201dRashta jumped to her feet in alarm. She had never imagined Viscount Roteschu would demand such a sum.\u201cWhat kind of house is that expensive!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a house with a garden. Actually, the house costs four hundred thousand krangs, but one hundred thousand goes to renovation.\u201dRashta\u2019s hands shook by how casually he answered.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to live in that big a mansion alone!\u201d\u201cLive alone?\u201dViscount Roteschu\u2019s eyebrow lifted at her.\u201cI will bring my grandchild with me. Your child, Rashta.\u201d\u201cYou will?!\u201d\u201cWell, I can\u2019t leave the little one alone in the country, can I? What a heartless mother.\u201dRashta trembled in bewilderment and rage.\u201cOh dear, Rashta. Do you think it\u2019s wasteful to spend money on your own child?\u201dViscount Roteschu looked at Rashta and smiled at her like a leech.***No matter how hard I tried, I found it difficult to understand Sovieshu. He doesn\u2019t love me, so why on earth\u2026My head was dizzy and my chest tight. I started to feel sick to my stomach, so I finally left the palace and walked outside. I remembered that Prince Heinley had left in a hurry, and my steps automatically turned towards the southern palace.\u2018Oh?\u2019However, as I walked through the southern palace, I saw Rashta in the corridor across the way. She didn\u2019t notice me in her hurry, and she looked quite pale.\u2018Is she not feeling well?\u2019She approached the door to someone\u2019s room, and a moment later it opened. It was Duke Elgy. Rashta entered the room first, but Duke Elgy\u2019s eyes met mine, and he grinned before closing the door.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat did I care? I made my way towards where Prince Heinley stayed. Coincidentally, he was walking this way, and we stood opposite each other in the middle of the hallway.\u201c\u2026Queen. \u201dHe stared at me for a moment then gave a languid smile.\u201cWe came across each other just as I was going to see you.\u201d\u201cDid you want to tell me something?\u201d\u201cI have a lot to say, and I\u2019ve come to say them.\u201dHe pointed towards the garden.\u201cDo you mind if I walk with you for a while?\u201dI nodded, and we fell in step together. Small winter petals that bloomed above us in the trees rustled in the wind and drifted downwards.I felt something heavy placed on my shoulders. It was Prince Heinley\u2019s coat.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it cold?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re cold, then why did you give me your coat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI thought you would be cold as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d\u201cThank goodness.\u201dI smiled at his strange words, and when I looked into his purple eyes he returned a smile as well. I inhaled the scent of his coat. It smelled similar to Queen. He awkwardly adjusted the coat on me, then continued walking.\u201cYou may have guessed, but\u2026\u201dIt was silent for a moment, the only sound the rustling of our clothes as we walked. Prince Heinley slowly spoke.\u201cI think I have to go back to the Western Kingdom.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dI was already prepared for this. Nevertheless, sadness rose in my heart. However, I could not reveal this to the person whose brother was on the edge of life and death.The crunch of our footsteps on the fallen leaves sounded unusually loud. The wind suddenly got colder, and I clutched his coat more tightly around me.Neither of us said a word. It wasn\u2019t until we walked a fair distance that Prince Heinley broke the silence again with a soft voice.\u201cCan we keep exchanging letters?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThank goodness.\u201dI smiled and nodded. I may not be able to see Prince Heinley often anymore, but Queen will come. And even though the frequency of the visits would be reduced, we can still meet. I tried to uplift my heart with this knowledge, but somehow it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201cQueen\u2026Queen may be busy.\u201dPrince Heinley stopped walking. When I looked up at him, he heaved a small sigh.\u201cI may have to send another bird. Will that be alright?\u201d\u201cWhy will Queen be busy?\u201d\u201cThe bird is a symbol, in many ways.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send the blue bird you saw before.\u201dI once thought he was just simply a good prince, but I suppose I\u2019ve become very close to him and Queen. His goodbye made my footsteps feel as heavy as lead. My first parting with a friend was more frustrating and terrible than I thought.I nodded, then turned and started walking again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Destroying the future to prove one\u2019s love was what emotional five- or six-year-olds did. The atmosphere hardened as the two men observed each other for a while. After a brief moment, Sovieshu gave a smile.\u201cVery well. Have a safe return.\u201dLater, Prince Heinley sought out Duke Elgy, but there was already someone else with him.\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201dA familiar voice was coming from the duke\u2019s room.\u201cAbsolutely\u2026thank you so much.\u201dIt was a woman\u2019s voice. Prince Heinley hid himself and waited for his friend to be alone. Soon the door to Duke Elgy\u2019s room opened, and Rashta emerged.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss.\u201dAfter the sound of small footsteps faded away, Prince Heinley stepped from behind the pillar and walked towards Duke Elgy.\u201cI was waiting for you to come out.\u201dDuke Elgy smiled, even though Prince Heinley had appeared out of nowhere.\u201cYou\u2019re always hiding here and there.\u201d\u201cI came here to talk to you.\u201d\u201cAre you returning home?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about something else.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dInstead of speaking, Prince Heinley pointed to the open door, and both men entered Duke Elgy\u2019s room. As soon as the door closed, Prince Heinley spoke.When I woke up the next morning, Prince Heinley had already left. The bearer of the somber news was Sir Artina, who informed me that the prince had left swiftly at dawn.\u201cI see.\u201dI had said goodbye to him yesterday, but if I had known it was our last meeting, I would have said a few more words. I had assumed I would see him again the next day.Although we had a strange start, we had grown to be good friends. I should have said that. But it wasn\u2019t just Prince Heinley and Queen who left me.I went to the central palace for work, but I was so depressed that I went back to the western palace for lunch with my ladies-in-waiting. There they gave me unexpected news.\u201cYour Majesty, Duchess Tuania is leaving the capital.\u201d\u201cLeaving the capital? Then the divorce\u2014? \u201d\u201cThe judge must have ruled in favor of the Count because of Viscount Langdel.\u201d\u201cThen\u2014!\u201dI felt a stab of guilt. I had succeeded in saving Viscount Langdel, but the information he found was buried, which put Duchess Tuania at a disadvantage in the trial.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I reproached myself, Laura shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t be too sad, Your Highness. Duchess Tuania wanted to say thank you, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cDuchess Tuania?\u201dCountess Eliza pulled out a small letter from her inner pocket.\u201cShe asked me to deliver this to you.\u201dAfter the ladies-in-waiting left after finishing the meal, I took out the letter and spread it open.\u2014 I know what you did for Viscount Langdel. Thank you for doing me this kindness. I know you\u2019ll blame yourself, so I\u2019m leaving you this letter.\u2018Duchess\u2026\u2019\u2014 I decided to follow Viscount Langdel. He tried to give his life for me, and now I want to be with him. It would be best if all this didn\u2019t happen at all, but in the future, if you are in any difficulty, I will surely repay you. Please burn this letter after reading it.Although there was no signature, I recognized Duchess Tuania\u2019s handwriting. I looked down at the paper for a moment, then lit a candle and burned the letter.\u2018Viscount Langdel\u2019s pure love for her eventually drew her heart\u2026\u2019Duchess Tuania was a wise woman and would overcome anything.The letter seemed to burn slowly first, but soon the flame rapidly ate through the paper. Finally, all that was left was a small scrap between my fingers. I set it down on the table, then blew out the candle.Prince Heinley, Queen, and Duchess of Tuania. Three people were gone. Two went far away, and one\u2019s destination was unknown.I sank into a depression. That night, I waited for Queen to tap the window with his beak, but it remained quiet. I opened the window, and wind blew in that was so cold that it gave me gooseflesh.\u2013 Isn\u2019t it cold?Prince Heinley\u2019s question yesterday seemed to come back from the wind.\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201dI gave a late reply, then left the window open as I curled into my blanket. There was no sign of Queen the following morning.***\u201cAchoo!\u201d\u201cOh no. You must have a cold, Your Majesty.\u201dCountess Eliza, who came to attend to me in the morning, was surprised when I sneezed. I blew my nose and nodded in embarrassment.\u201cI suppose so.\u201dMost likely it was because I slept with the windows open.\u201cShall I cancel today\u2019s schedule?\u201dCountess Eliza looked at me anxiously. I checked my calendar and asked her to do so.\u201cAnd call the palace doctor.\u201dA mild cold wouldn\u2019t matter, but something more serious would be a problem. I couldn\u2019t blow my nose noisily in front of the people and ministers I had to have serious discussions with.\u201cPlease bring me something comfortable to wear.\u201dAs Countess Eliza left to call the palace doctor, another lady-in-waiting came to help me into a warm, thick dress. I didn\u2019t wear any other ornaments on me. Later, Laura brought some clear soup and I had breakfast alone.About half an hour later, Countess Eliza returned with the palace doctor. After I was recommended bed rest, the doctor diagnosed me with a mild cold, and told me not to strain myself and then prescribed some medicine. As soon as I took it, I closed my eyes.When I opened them again, it was already midday. A lady-in-waiting hadn\u2019t taken away the medicine container yet, and the window was firmly shut. I looked at the closed window, then stood up to open it again out of habit. Perhaps Queen will come while I\u2019m asleep\u2026Countess Eliza, who came in with a towel and large basin, saw me and immediately started chided me.\u201cOh no. There\u2019s a strong wind chill and you can\u2019t leave the windows open, Your Majesty.\u201dShe set the basin next to the bed and closed the window. I wanted to open it again, but I didn\u2019t want to argue when she was worried over me.\u2018As long as I\u2019m in the room and I\u2019m awake, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019I could open the window for Queen then.I watched as Countess Eliza dipped the wet towel into the hot water and squeezed it, then used it to warm my hands and feet.\u201cYou need to get well soon.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cOh, and on my way to retrieve the palace doctor, I heard that Lord Koshar will soon arrive in the capital. \u201d\u201cElder Brother?\u201dFirst came joy, and then anxiety. Lord Koshar was a good brother to me\u2026but he was a bit of a delinquent. He wouldn\u2019t start fights, but once there was an argument, it sometimes turned violent. When I became empress, my father had worried that my brother would cause an accident that would harm my reputation, and he hurriedly sent my brother away to an outer region.Would my brother be able to sit still when he sees that Rashta is pregnant\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reality was rather the opposite; Sovieshu decided to hold a banquet in celebration of his first baby, and I was busier than before.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t go.\u201dLaura shook with anger.\u201cEven if it\u2019s with a group, or close friends, you shouldn\u2019t attend.\u201dThere were different obligations between attending a banquet versus a large ball, but if I didn\u2019t come to celebrate Sovieshu\u2019s baby, I may end up hurting Sovieshu. I didn\u2019t want to ask my friends to make me feel better.\u201cI know.\u201dMy face was of forced calm, but irritation bubbled beneath the surface. I didn\u2019t want to smile while everyone celebrated Rashta and the Emperor, nor did I want to have to feign ignorance when people stared at me. However, the banquet was already scheduled, and I could not back out.Four days after Sovieshu decided on the banquet, I walked around the palace mechanically, giving instructions. Eventually I stole away and hid myself away at a secluded bench. I sat there, suppressing the anger that was mounting in me.Four days ago, it was Sovieshu\u2019s secretary that told me there would be a banquet for the first child. Sovieshu had the wisdom to have his secretary deliver me the news, and then he went on an inspection trip to another province. I hadn\u2019t seen him since. With my current mood, there was a chance I would step on his foot as soon as I saw him.I sat there alone, when I became aware of the sound of approaching footsteps. I didn\u2019t want to lift my head, so I lifted my hand to shade my eyes. It would likely be a government official, a court official or a knight anyway. They would turn around or pass.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, the footsteps halted in front of me. I lowered my hand and raised my head.It was Sovieshu. He must have just arrived back from his inspection, as he was wearing a dark brown travelling cloak and his hair was unkempt. Our eyes met, and he spoke with a slight frown.\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201dI could hear voices instructing servants to unload luggage not far away. There was also the mingling of other voices that were difficult to make out.\u201cI\u2019m fine. You just arrived?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026but are you really alright?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI had imagined stepping on his foot before he came here. Now I wondered what to do now that he was right in front of me. It was difficult for me to stay in his presence, so I stood up from the bench and smoothed out the rumpled skirt of my dress.\u201cYou must be tired, so go get some rest today.\u201dI gave him a perfunctory smile and turned around. However, Sovieshu repeated himself once again.\u201cAre you really alright?\u201dThe question was the same, but this time the nuances were strange. When I turned around, he was sending me a dark gaze as if he were trying to figure out my thoughts. I looked at him suspiciously. I didn\u2019t think he was asking me this question because he saw my sagging figure on the bench.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dI smiled, pretending not to know. Sovieshu, however, decided to be blunt.\u201cBy any chance, do you dislike me holding a banquet welcoming the baby?\u201dIt was an embarrassingly forward question. He looked at me straight in the eyes.If he asked this as soon as he arrived, did he really need to bother asking? In any case, I answered honestly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to attend, but since I have to host it, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll dislike it all the more.\u201d\u201cThe empress is still so cold. No affection at all.\u201d\u201cThe same is true of you, Your Majesty, who knows that I\u2019d hate to organize the banquet, but still instructed me to do so.\u201dSovieshu sighed and pressed his temples. It was clear what kind of woman he thought I was. I\u2019m sure he thought of me as frigid and cruel.\u201c\u2026Do you have any idea why I\u2019m holding this banquet?\u201d\u201cDo I need to know?\u201dIt was easy to guess why. He wanted to show off Rashta. He was happy to have his first child. Or he wanted to hurt my feelings. Or perhaps it was all three.\u201cYou said it before. Rashta\u2019s baby is not officially part of the Imperial family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps one day, they will be forgotten in history, as you said. But at least when we are alive, people will think of the baby as the firstborn of the emperor.\u201d\u201cAnd you asked me to prepare a banquet to admit it?\u201d\u201cWhether you admit it or not, it is what it is.\u201dI pressed my lips tightly and looked sideways, avoiding his eyes. I was afraid I would lose if I didn\u2019t look away. My neck was stretched and my jaw clenched to keep my face impassive.\u201cThe baby\u2026maybe it can be your baby as well. I hope you won\u2019t hate it even before it\u2019s born.\u201dMy forehead creased at Sovieshu\u2019s words. Why was he speaking about this? Why would Rashta\u2019s baby be my baby? I looked at him in incredulity. Sovieshu stared back at me with his dark eyes.\u201cDo you understand what I mean?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking too much of me.\u201dAs soon as I snapped, Sovieshu sighed and turned away from me with heavy footsteps. After walking a few paces, he carefully opened his mouth to speak.\u201cWe have been married for a long time.\u201dWhy was he talking about that now? I stared at him guardedly. I didn\u2019t know what he would say, but I had an ominous feeling.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a baby yet.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cOf course we\u2019re both young, and so we may have one someday. But\u2026\u201dHis face grew darker.\u201cIt may not happen.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen when you were younger and healthier than you are now.\u201dI stared at him in shock. Sovieshu looked more uncomfortable when he spoke, too. The sight made my heart thud stronger in my chest.\u201cSo what you mean is\u2026\u201dI tried to keep my voice as level I could, but it trembled.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a baby, Rashta\u2019s baby may be recognized as a part of the Imperial family?\u201dHe frowned.\u201cI\u2019m talking about the worst case. And if it is, don\u2019t hate a baby who\u2019s not yet born.\u201d\u201cThe more you say it, the more I dislike it.\u201d\u201cIt could be a good child.\u201d\u201cConsidering who it takes after?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Are you implying that Rashta or I have bad personalities?\u201d\u201cWhoever it takes after, the baby won\u2019t like me. And I won\u2019t like it.\u201dAfter saying my words, I gave a quick bow and turned my heel and left. Sovieshu called me from behind, but I didn\u2019t look back. Somewhere in my heart, smoke clouded up in me. It burned my nose and made my eyes feel numb. There was a buzzing sensation in my brain.When I returned to the central palace, I went back to work as mechanically as possible. I needed Queen\u2019s warmth. I needed Queen more than ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Count Pirnu looked up from a report about book distribution.\u201cYes?\u201dSovieshu sat stiffly with his chin propped on his hand. A heavy sigh left his mouth.\u201cYour Majesty? Are you all right?\u201dSovieshu hesitated at first, but in the end he answered.\u201cI\u2019m worried that the empress will be hostile to the baby.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026Does she hate it?\u201d\u201cI believe so.\u201dCount Pirnu gave a nod of agreement.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. In rare cases, favored illegitimate children can be a threat to a successor.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s mouth twisted.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early to worry about when we don\u2019t even have a successor?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cShe is like a cold blade. As an Empress is she remarkable, but\u2026\u201dHe closed his eyes with a heavy sigh.\u201cIf she has ill feelings towards baby, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll treat it with that cold, knife-like nature.\u201dCount Pirnu thought it was too early to worry, but he accepted the Emperor\u2019s words. Sovieshu had looked forward to being a father, and the baby would be the firstborn of the Emperor. It was natural for Sovieshu to be concerned.\u201cWhat do you think, Count?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I am actually more worried about Lord Koshar than the Empress.\u201d\u201cKoshar? Hasn\u2019t Koshar gone to Palme?\u201d\u201cDuke Troby seemed to have given his son permission to return now.\u201dSovieshu\u2019s expression hardened as he remembered that man.Koshar Troby was the elder brother of Empress Navier. Since Sovieshu had been Navier\u2019s fianc\u00e9 since childhood, he was familiar with Koshar. He resembled his beautiful sister, and was skilled in martial arts. Unlike the ice-like empress, however, Koshar was like a volcano. His hot temper was useful when directed elsewhere, such as the sparsely populated frontier of Palme were dangerous bandits thrived that called themselves the \u201cEternal Thousand.\u201d Duke Troby sent his son there less for the purpose of defense, and more to redirect his violent personality. In an explosive situation, he could be deadly.\u201c\u2026\u201dSovieshu pursed his lips in thought, while Count Pirnu smiled awkwardly.\u201cBut now that his sister sits on the empress\u2019 seat, he should be a little better behaved than before. Do not worry too much, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried before you told me this.\u201d\u201c\u2026My apologies.\u201dSovieshu gave Count Pirnu a disapproving look before returning to his papers. However, the Count\u2019s words left a deep imprint on his mind. Koshar Troby cared for his sister terribly. Would he be willing to leave Rashta, Navier\u2019s romantic rival, untouched?Sam had a throbbing headache, and eventually called the palace doctor.***The same time.Koshar, the subject of everyone\u2019s concern, casually stopped by a large women\u2019s clothing store, bringing mischievous laughter inside with a friend. Marquis Farang, who accompanied Koshar, stopped and looked around with a red face.\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKoshar?\u201dThere was no reply, and the marquis looked sideways. Koshar was staring at a dress that a young girl would wear.\u201cIf I buy this for Navier\u2026\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t fit. It never does.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYour sister is no longer a child.\u201d\u201cI suppose so, indeed. Time passes so swiftly\u2026\u201d\u201cHey. Don\u2019t distort the past. She was already tall when you left.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still a little sister in my memory.\u201dKoshar scratched his nose and laughed. Marquis Farang clicked his tongue and asked for the tailor.\u201cExcuse me. Please help us.\u201dAs soon as the tailor approached, Marquis Farang pointed towards Koshar.\u201cMy friend is looking for a dress for his sister.\u201dThe tailor spoke in a kindly voice.\u201cDo you know her size, Sir?\u201dKoshar glanced at Marquis Farang, then turned back and replied mildly.\u201cAbout this tall\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, she must be quite tall. What is her body type?\u201d\u201cA lovely body shape\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure what that shape is. Can you be more specific?\u201dKoshar shook his head, and the tailor made a puzzled look. She turned towards the marquis, but he also shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to fit the clothes if you don\u2019t know her size.\u201d\u201cI still want to buy something. I haven\u2019t seen her in years. Don\u2019t you have anything suitable?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something you can buy without knowing the size, how about a hat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201dThe tailor displayed to them a variety of hats, and Koshar began to look over each one carefully. But even this was not easy. The tailor had pulled out a total of thirty-five hats, and all the other customers in the store gathered to watch the activity. Marquis Farang was so embarrassed by the women that he quickly stuck to the wall, while Koshar completely immersed himself in the selection process.Finally, he picked five colorful hats and left the clothing store. Marquis Farang tutted at his friend.\u201cDo you like your sister that much?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s such a lovely girl. And\u2014ah, look at that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat bread. It must be delicious if so many people are lining up. I\u2019ll bring one to Navier.\u201dKoshar pushed his way through the crowd, the marquis clicked his tongue again and followed his friend. They stood in line for ten minutes. As Marquis Farang\u2019s patience was starting to run low, his ears caught a snatch of conversation.\u201cAnd the Emperor\u2019s concubine\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, my cousin works as a maid in the palace. The concubine is pregnant.\u201d\u201cSo she\u2019s pregnant before the Empress. What happens then?\u201dKoshar, who was holding on to the shopping bags full of lace and frill, suddenly turned around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The morning chill brought fresh goosebumps onto my skin, but it did not cool the fire inside of me. The sound of birds reminded me of Queen and only served to make me more depressed.A concubine\u2019s child cannot be a prince or a princess. And yet Sovieshu suggested that if we could not conceive a child together, perhaps I would adopt it\u2026I didn\u2019t like it.It was preferable to have any other baby than one born between Sovieshu and Rashta. No matter how much I thought over it, I didn\u2019t think I could love the baby. No, I was quite sure I wouldn\u2019t.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dCountess Eliza\u2019s voice broke my reverie, and I wrested my gaze from the window. I was so lost in thought that I didn\u2019t even realize she was nearby.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI tried to look casual, and she spoke to me in a lowered voice.\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen is here.\u201d\u201cHe is?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI walked into the parlor room and found Grand Duke Kapmen standing with his hat in one hand. It was the first time I\u2019d seen him since he struck Sovieshu. I glanced at his hand to see if he was alright, but he didn\u2019t look hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thank you for your concern.\u201dDid he notice my gaze? Grand Duke Kapmen responded bluntly as he briefly waved his hand. It was then I made a sudden realization.\u201cThe potion has worn off.\u201dI looked back in amazement, but when he responded, his voice was cold.\u201cYou sound like you were just waiting for us to part. Did you want me gone?\u201dI stared at him in surprise, and he sighed and apologized.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m in an unstable emotional state. It\u2019s why I twisted what you said. I hope you will understand.\u201d\u201cAh. Then the potion is still\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen I observed him more closely, I noticed that his hand holding his hat was trembling. More worries sprung up in my mind twentyfold.\u201cDoes the drug usually last this long?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what worries me.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen sighed again. At the same time, he adjusted the space between his feet and mine. He seemed to want to keep some distance from me.\u201cYou said you created it, right?\u201d\u201cI wanted to make something for the black market when I was an academy student\u2026the potion doesn\u2019t usually work like this.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen sighed once again and fidgeted with his hand.\u201cHow effective is it usually?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just the feeling when you first fall in love. It\u2019s not supposed to last as long as this, and the antidote should have worked.\u201d\u201cHave you ever used it on a person?\u201d\u201cOf course I have. That\u2019s why I gave it to you.\u201dHe sighed for a third time.\u201cThe drug had already been around for a few years. If it worked this powerfully in the first place, it would have spread wildly by now.\u201dThat was true. The symptoms Grand Duke Kapmen displayed was not of mere infatuation, but of overwhelming, feverish passion. Such a drug\u2026it would have many uses.\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a side effect?\u201dI looked at him anxiously, but he didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m leaving the empire.\u201dThis time.He was here to say goodbye.At that moment, my eyes started to go blurry. I was not as close to Grand Duke Kapmen as I was with Prince Heinley or Queen or Duchess Tuania, but my heart was suffering through these repeated partings. I started rambling before I even realized it.\u201cWhat about trade? What about diplomatic relations? It\u2019s still in progress. If you go away\u2014\u201d\u201cThe Emperor doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cI am in charge of this.\u201d\u201cBut as long as it\u2019s related to state affairs, you cannot make deals without your husband\u2019s final approval.\u201dMy heart pounded, but for a different reason. I was angry. I was angry that my entire effort to establish diplomatic relations with Rwibt had crumbled away like a sandcastle, all because of Sovieshu\u2019s feelings.I stood there with my lips pressed shut, and Grand Duke Kapmen clenched his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t be upset.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease. If you\u2019re upset now, my heart hurts so much. Please\u2026\u201dHe pressed down on his bosom, looking distressed. I forced a smile for him, but it didn\u2019t seem to work, and so I changed my words to another direction.\u201cSo the diplomatic relationship is completely over?\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen gingerly lifted his hand from his chest, as if to check if his attempt to suppress his feelings worked.\u201cSince I cannot create an alliance with the Eastern Empire, I will look to other countries. It doesn\u2019t matter which ones.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dI swallowed the lump in my throat, and gave him a hollow smile as I bowed.\u201cThank you for telling me the circumstances.\u201d\u201cI will look around other countries to find out how to remove the effects of the drug.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he kept his eyes on me. I gave him my reluctant blessing.\u201cI\u2026I hope your alliances go well.\u201dI knew he worked hard, and wished for him to find a better trading partner. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t want that for him either. My stomach seemed to turn.\u201c\u2026though I\u2019m only being half sincere.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen widened his eyes, then burst into laughter. He doubled over so hard that he had to wipe tears from his eyes. Did the love potion increase his response to my words? I didn\u2019t know why he was laughing, but he was doing it so much that I began to feel embarrassed. I felt as if I had betrayed an obvious desire.\u2018He might say something behind my back.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was so cute.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe offered a silent smile, and I didn\u2019t know what to say. Sometimes, the way he spoke\u2026it was as if he were answering the thoughts in my mind. I shifted awkwardly.Grand Duke Kapmen opened his mouth to speak again, but then paused. Wasn\u2019t he going to say goodbye? Did it hurt him to say it? Would it be better if I said goodbye first?I would remember him as the person who showed me what it felt like to be loved. He wasn\u2019t as dear to me as Prince Heinley, but I enjoyed knowing him in the time that we had. I tried to give my farewell first, when the grand duke gave an unexpected proposal.\u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI want you to come with me. I\u2019d love you to.\u201dI stared at him in amazement. What? I was frozen to the spot, and he brought his hat to his chest.\u201cYour heart will only rot if you stay here. Let\u2019s go to the Hwa continent. You\u2019ll live without any pain, and you\u2019ll be surrounded by all the good things in the world.\u201d\u201cGrand Duke\u2026\u201dWas it the potion speaking again? But even though I waited, he did not correct his words. As he stared into my eyes, he held out a trembling hand towards me.\u201cI will do all the preparations if you allow me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A man who I knew for his blunt speech and his confidence was now afraid of my rejection. Perhaps it was because of the potion, but at this moment he was sincere.

I drew my brows together in a frown.\u201cNo. You\u2019re not alright.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my emotions. It\u2019s up to you to reject it, but please don\u2019t treat my feelings callously.\u201d\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen. I know you. You\u2019re only proposing this because of the potion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will feel guilty about it when it wears off.\u201dI deliberately spoke with a smile, but Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s expression did not lighten. I sighed.\u201cDon\u2019t bet your life with me in what you feel at the moment, Grand Duke.\u201d\u201cWhen this drug wears away, how can you be sure that my emotions will go back to normal? \u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t like me at first, remember?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my enemies I don\u2019t like.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI just felt frustrated.\u201dGrand Duke Kapmen\u2019s face was carefully blank, but something about him was pitiable. His offer, however, was not something to be decided by sympathy and impulse. I deliberately looked away.\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen. You may find what I\u2019m doing is frustrating, but\u2026this burden is not difficult for me to carry.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI admit it is painful for the Emperor to love another woman while he is cold to me. But I am the empress.\u201dI let out a small, unintelligible sound and I turned my head back.\u201cI have lived and learned to become an empress all my life. This is my dream and reality. I don\u2019t want to lose my life simply because of the suffering my husband is putting me through.\u201dWhen Grand Duke Kapmen spoke, his voice was heavy with regret.\u201cIt\u2019s a great belief, but a dangerous one.\u201d\u201cHow is it dangerous?\u201d\u201cWhat will you do if your husband asks you for a divorce first?\u201dThat wouldn\u2019t happen, but he continued before I could reply.\u201cYou have such a strong identity as an empress. But if you divorce the Emperor, you will not longer be the empress. I\u2019m afraid you will fall apart then.\u201dI flatly denied his words.\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. The Emperor is not a fool.\u201dI was serious. Sovieshu wasn\u2019t completely devoid of reasonable judgment. However, Grand Duke Kapmen coldly refuted me.\u201cHe was already a fool the moment he turned away from you. People addicted to love are likely to act on impulse and do things they would never ordinarily do. Such as the way I punched your husband.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHe heaved a sigh. It seemed like there was more he wanted to say, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he carefully asked a question.\u201cBefore I go, can we hug?\u201dA light embrace was common among the nobles, so I agreed. As soon as I gave permission, he stepped forward and pulled me in. But it wasn\u2019t the hug I had in mind. Where had his calm and heavy attitude gone? His hug was impatient and intense. I was short on breath as I was locked tightly in his arms. His forehead touched my shoulder.This\u2026this was not a simple embrace.\u201cGrand Duke.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGrand Duke Kapmen.\u201dI didn\u2019t think this was a good idea, and I called his name carefully. Fortunately, he retreated. When he released me from his grip, I saw his expression was carefully smoothed over. He gave a calm and polite bow, placed his hat on his head, and walked towards the door. He gave one last backwards glance, then left.I collapsed onto the couch as soon as he was gone. Could it be the aftermath of his emotional whirlwind? I felt numb, but I didn\u2019t have the luxury to stay that way for long.\u201cYour Majesty, Lord Koshar is here.\u201dWithin fifteen minutes of Grand Duke Kapmen\u2019s departure, my older brother, Koshar, came to see me.\u201cNavier!\u201dAs soon as Countess Eliza opened the door for me, my brother bounded into the room and embraced me. He was just as strong as Grand Duke Kapmen, but his arms were more comfortable. When I sat still, my brother buried his forehead in my shoulder like Grand Duke Kapmen as well. Was it natural for tall people to position themselves like this?\u201cNavier. Your shoulders are damp.\u201dI looked at him confusedly.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s some water on your shoulder.\u201d\u201c!\u201dAs soon as my brother pulled away, I touched my hand to the spot where Grand Duke Kapmen placed his forehead. It really was damp.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dDid the Grand Duke\u2026cry? He cried and then left with a blank face like that? I put down my hand as my heart sank with regret, while my brother watched me closely.\u201cYou look somber, Navier. Is it because of your husband and that woman?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHow dare he make you so miserable.\u201dI looked up at my brother in surprise, and saw that he was grinding his teeth as he clenched his fists.\u201cAll the commoners are talking about your husband and the concubine.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSo Koshar must have heard everything. I looked downward, feeling unsure of myself. I didn\u2019t want to hear my brother talk about my husband being in love with another woman. Of course, I knew it would come up someday, but\u2026As soon as I dropped my gaze, I saw shopping bags near my brother\u2019s feet. I deliberately changed the subject.\u201cWhat are those?\u201d\u201cGifts.\u201dMy brother delicately held out the shopping bags to me like he was giving me a bomb, and I leaned from the couch to accept them.\u201cCan I open them?\u201dHowever, my brother didn\u2019t say yes.\u201cCheck them later. I\u2019m not going to run away with the gifts.\u201dHe stood in front of me.\u201cWhere is that woman staying, Navier?\u201d\u201cWhat woman?\u201d\u201cOh my clever sister. Where are you pretending you don\u2019t know? The woman with the bastard child. Along with that damn asshole.\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201dI quickly stood up and covered Koshar\u2019s mouth.\u201cWatch your language. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201dThe palace had many ears and eyes. Everyone here was my aide, but I remembered that Viscountess Verdi had once been close to me. Even my own ladies-in-waiting could betray me depending on the circumstances. My brother\u2019s eyes flashed and he pulled away my hand.\u201cEveryone knows that my personality is garbage anyway. Where are they, Navier?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill those two bastards.\u201dMy hand flew to cover my brother\u2019s mouth again. I gave a harried glance towards Countess Eliza, she sent all the ladies-in-waiting out of the room. After they were all gone I locked the door securely, then pushed my brother onto the sofa and hissed at him in a low voice.\u201cBe careful, brother. People will find fault in any small thing you say.\u201d\u201cI meant it.\u201dHe answered firmly, and his eyes were sharp. I was worried. He really did seem serious. I was afraid that my brother would do something that I wouldn\u2019t be able to control.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can be put to death if you harm the Emperor!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll kill the woman.\u201d\u201cPersonal grudges are also a felony.\u201dI pointed my hand towards my brother\u2019s stomach.\u201cAnd Rashta\u2019s baby is the Emperor\u2019s baby.\u201d\u201cA bastard?\u201d\u201cA child of a concubine. The Emperor is greatly anticipating it.\u201dMy brother looked at me with a face that said, \u2018What does that have to do with anything?\u2019My head was pounding. If it were any other person, I could make excuses and say the words were spoken in the heat of passion. But not my brother. My brother was a man who followed words with actions. No, he was a man who acted on his passions.\u201cVery well, Navier. Then I won\u2019t let that woman give birth to the baby.\u201d\u201cIf you touch the baby, you will face an even heavier punishment.\u201dIt was a great sin to commit murder inside the Imperial palace, but an even greater one to harm the Emperor\u2019s bloodline. Viscount Langdel was almost executed, not by stabbing Rashta, but by threatening the life inside her belly. Even though the law didn\u2019t treat the concubine\u2019s children as princes or princesses, they weren\u2019t treated like ordinary aristocrats either.\u201cBrother. Even if you kill Miss Rashta as you say you will, do you think the Emperor will not take another concubine?\u201dBut despite my attempts to calm my brother, his temper would not cool. He paced around the room with his hands around his head, while I rummaged through the shopping bags and pulled out one of the gifts.It was a hat. I placed it on my head, hoping it would make him feel better. I fixed my hair and showed myself to him, but my brother was angrier than any hat could comfort.He stopped at my desk and glared at my calendar.\u201cA banquet?\u201dMy daily schedule was marked on my calendar, including the banquet for Rashta\u2019s baby.\u201cBrother.\u201dI hurried up to pick up the calendar, but my brother was faster. He had already glimpsed it, and he turned to me dumbfounded.\u201cWhy do you have to organize the party for them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that one. I\u2019m responsible for all the parties in the palace.\u201dMy brother kept his mouth firmly shut as he fixed his gaze at me. However, his next words were not about the banquet.\u201cThe hat looks good on you.\u201dHis unexpected praise took me by surprise, but before I could respond, he turned his heel and left. I watched him anxiously, then removed my hat and placed it on the couch.I stood there frozen until I heard the sound of a bird squawking near the window. My mind cautioned me that it could be an intruder, but I opened the window anyway and leaned out my head. It was hard to tell where the bird\u2019s sound was coming from.The bird\u2019s cry reminded me of Queen. A sense of unease stirred in me. I was scared that something might have happened to Prince Heinley and Queen. I didn\u2019t think they would have arrived in the Western Kingdom yet.Would they get there safely\u2026?***Prince Heinley\u2019s entourage was passing through the Borayong mountains. Despite Navier\u2019s expectations, however, Prince Heinley himself and McKenna had already arrived in the Western Kingdom.Prince Heinley was in the king\u2019s bedroom. The bed itself was a splendor of beige and golden tones, with the headboard itself decorated with fine gold embellishments. The man lying on the bed, however, was in a less majestic state, and had sunken, bloodshot eyes and a pallid face.Heinley gripped the hand of King Wharton III, his brother and the king of the West. With each rattling breath the king took, Prince Heinley\u2019s heart sunk further. It had taken a while for Wharton III to recognize his younger brother, and when he spoke, it was with a rasping breath.\u201cHeinley\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHeinley\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m right beside you, my brother.\u201dPrince Heinley squeezed King Wharton III\u2019s hand.\u201cHeinley\u2026get married.\u201dPrince Heinley grimaced. Even before his brother was ill, he had always nagged him about taking a wife. However, he couldn\u2019t reply coldly to his sick older brother.Without speaking, Heinley held on to Wharton III\u2019s hands, and the king stared dimly back at him. A smile appeared on Wharton III\u2019s face, as if he noticed his brother\u2019s unhappy expression.\u201cI\u2019m not nagging. You must get married, Heinley.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d\u201cIf I die\u2026you will be king. You need a successor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFor the king\u2026to welcome a queen\u2026is not a choice\u2026but a responsibility.\u201dHeinley heaved a sigh.\u201cYou\u2019re still making this difficult.\u201d\u201cThe country deserves a good woman\u2026not a woman that is lovely to your eyes\u2026 but a queen that will love the people.\u201dA face came into Prince Heinley\u2019s mind. A queen who was lovely to him and was able to love his people. But that woman already had a man beside her\u2026His heart throbbed.\u201cWhat if there is a woman who is both?\u201d\u201cGood. Don\u2019t let her go.\u201dWharton III smiled not as a king, but as a brother.\u201cIf you marry, stop being a womanizer.\u201dHeinley had pretended to be a flirt to create a lighthearted image, but he regretted it now that he had a woman he liked. His mouth tipped upwards in a smile.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026I\u2019m sure you will do well\u2026with the country.\u201dHeinley sighed and tapped his brother on the back of the hand.\u201cIs there anything else you need to tell me? Nothing difficult, I mean.\u201dAlthough they were never bosom brothers, Heinley\u2019s heart was burdened with sadness and regret. Wharton III blinked slowly, then turned to stare blankly at the bed\u2019s canopy. Heinley gave a small smile.\u201cYou must have nothing else to say.\u201dWharton III smiled along with Heinley and spoke in a low voice.\u201cLook after your sister-in-law.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let other nobles ignore you\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cNo matter what anyone says, I will protect you\u2026\u201dWharton III\u2019s trembling lips closed, as if merely speaking took a massive effort. He sucked in a few heavy, slow breaths. It was getting slower now. His grip on Heinley\u2019s hand gradually loosened, and Heinley gently lowered his brother\u2019s hand. The king\u2019s chest, which had been rising and falling, was no longer moving.\u201c\u2026\u201dHeinley closed his eyes and clasped his hands together. Tears streamed down his cheeks. The doctor stood up from behind him to check the king\u2019s pulse, and then spoke in a somber voice.\u201c\u2026The King has passed.\u201dThose who silently stood beside the wall came and knelt before the new king. Heinley opened his eyes slowly, and looked down at them through his blurry vision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps he was so frustrated that he couldn\u2019t focus his anger on one person\u2014Sovieshu. My family managed to persuade my brother to come home. It was not his place to vent his anger at Sovieshu or Rashta, otherwise, he would put his life and position at risk.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m in a position where I can\u2019t do anything either.\u2019The moment I became angry with Rashta, the Emperor would accuse me of being a wicked bully to the poor concubine. On the other hand, if I became angry with Sovieshu, I would be criticized as an incompetent empress who couldn\u2019t control her emotions. If I took it out on him, I\u2014and perhaps my family\u2014would be at risk. And yet, if I tolerated Sovieshu and Rashta, I would be seen as stupid and foolish; not only me, but my entire family.I stared at myself in the mirror, and a strange laugh escaped from me. A wicked woman, an incompetent empress, or a foolish broad. Was there any way out of this maze?\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dCountess Eliza called me from the parlor room. I rang a bell in permission, and she came inside with a gloomy look.\u201cCountess? Are you alright?\u201dHer expression made me nervous. I had a series of unfortunate events lately, and so I was immediately afraid. My prediction was half true.\u201cDelegates from the Western Kingdom have arrived.\u201dThe bad news wasn\u2019t about me, but my premonition was right.\u201cA death obituary.\u201d\u201cYes. King Wharton III has passed away.\u201dPrince Heinley\u2019s older brother\u2026I imagined the prince\u2019s smiling face falling into sadness, and my heart suddenly felt heavy.That night, no moon nor stars were seen in the heavens. The sky looked black because of the clouds, but I could occasionally make out a hazy grayish-yellow circle in the dark. With one arm propped on the window, I stared glumly at the scene.\u2018There will be a feast for Rashta\u2019s baby in a few days.\u2019Could I keep my mask on? I had been doing it for years, but lately it seemed to slip away from me more. More precisely, I tired of constantly keeping my facial expressions in check.\u2018\u2026In the end, I\u2019ll do it if I must.\u2019The cold wind sent goosebumps on my cheek. Drops of water began to plop onto my arm, one by one. I took my arm off the window and closed it, but as soon as I did, I saw a blue bird flying in the dark.\u201cAh!\u201dQueen\u2019s underling? I was so surprised I opened the window again. I wasn\u2019t sure at first, but I turned out to be right, and the blue bird flew through the open window. Unlike Queen, who like a grand entrance, the blue bird seemed more hesitant and cautious.\u201cAre you Queen\u2019s friend?\u201dI spoke to him even though he was a bird. Since Queen was intelligent, I thought this one would be the same. The blue bird nodded and even lowered himself in a bow.\u2013 Jjaek.The bird held out his foot and offered me the note attached to it.\u201cDid Prince Heinley send you?\u201d\u2013 Jjaek.I pulled the letter off his leg with the utmost care. When I opened it, the blue bird came to my side, as if to read the letter with me like Queen did. I looked at the paper on my lap as I rested my face on one hand.\u2013 I only think of you, my Queen. You\u2019re the only friend who can bring me comfort. I need it.His handwriting was noticeably shakier than before. Though there were only a few words written on the paper, the sorrow in them was palpable.\u2013 Jjaek\u2026I set the letter down, and the blue bird cried weakly. I went straight to my desk, then picked up a pen and set it to paper, but my hand didn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t know what words I should say to comfort him. He said I was the only person who could do so, but\u2026what on earth could I say when his brother died? If I were with him, I could simply sit with him without saying anything. What could a few written words do?\u2013 I hope that you are not hurting too much.In the end, I only wrote a cliched sentence.***The day after the blue bird flew away, Grand Duke Kapmen left the palace as well. He didn\u2019t say goodbye to me, possibly because of the love potion, but he had sent someone to give me a book about Rwibt as a gift. The delegation who announced the Western king\u2019s funeral also returned to their country. It was a series of farewells and separations. It seemed to me that I was the only one affected by all these partings.Everyone else clamored over the new King of the West, and when they tired of that, they talked about Rashta\u2019s baby. Although most were wary to gossip out loud in the palace, rumors were more open at the southern palace where there were many foreigners.\u201cDidn\u2019t Prince Heinley like Lady Rashta, too?\u201d\u201cYes, and I heard that the Emperor and the Prince fought over her as well.\u201d\u201cYou know why they fought? Miss Rashta and Prince Heinley were letter friends, and the Emperor was jealous.\u201d\u201cPrince Heinley must be heartbroken by Lady Rashta\u2019s pregnancy.\u201dMy footsteps halted at the garden near the southern palace. I came here to remind myself of the things I enjoyed, but the unpleasant stories followed me here as well.\u2018I\u2019ll just go back.\u2019I took a deep breath, then turned and walked in the opposite direction of the corridor. However, at the crossroads of the eastern, western, and southern palace, I came across someone unexpected. We had never introduced ourselves to each other before, but he was a man clearly in my memory.\u201cYour Majesty, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing you here. I\u2019m so thrilled.\u201dIt was Viscount Roteschu, the one who claimed that Rashta was a slave. There was an insidious smile on his face. He gave me a bow and smiled, but instead of conversing with him I made my way back to the western palace.\u2018I hear he\u2019s been frequenting the Imperial Palace lately. Is he meeting with Rashta?\u2019How strange. I thought he was her enemy. Why would Rashta accept Viscount Roteschu?\u2018It seems that she can be threatened too\u2026\u2019***\u201cI met the Empress on my way here.\u201dIt was the first words Viscount Roteschu said as soon he saw Rashta. She frowned at having to be in the presence of someone she didn\u2019t like. It was a bad omen if Viscount Roteschu talked about the Empress. He had only mentioned her once before, when he compared Rashta to her.\u201cWhat else are you going to say?\u201dShe gave him a cold glare, and Viscount Roteschu grinned.\u201cNothing. I just wanted to say that her aura looks different from yours.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cJust that she has a noble look in her eye\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you saying Rashta doesn\u2019t look like that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe after you drink court water for twenty years, there might be a resemblance.\u201dViscount Roteschu smiled wickedly.\u201cOf course, if you haven\u2019t been expelled by that time.\u201d\u201c!\u201dRasta stared wide-eyed at Viscount Roteschu, but he continued on calmly.\u201cDo you have anything to eat?\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, go back to your business.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re heartless.\u201dRashta clenched her shaking fists. Although they had agreed to be on the same side, she absolutely hated the viscount.\u2018I have to do whatever he says\u2026\u2019She let out an exhale, then looked sternly into his eyes.\u201cWhat are you here for this time?\u201d\u201cWell, I need some money quickly.\u201dRashta opened her mouth in amazement.\u201cAgain? I just gave you five hundred thousand krangs, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cI spent it on finding a house.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a big house, so I need a lot of servants.\u201dRashta clenched her fists harder, her fingernails biting into her palms. How could a person be so hateful?Despite Rashta\u2019s pure look of loathing, however, Viscount Roteschu smiled and continued.\u201cAnd since I have a lot of family, I need more hands.\u201d\u201cThere are only two people in your family. You and the baby.\u201d\u201cTwo?\u201dHe lifted an eyebrow at her.\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201dViscount Roteschu let out a bark of laughter.\u201cI\u2019m bringing my son and daughter, of course. You think I would only bring your baby?\u201dRashta\u2019s faced whitened at his words.\u201cWhat?\u201dShe panicked and looked at him with trembling lips.\u201cWho are you bringing?\u201dViscount Roteschu\u2019s lip curled in satisfaction.\u201cWhy?

When did I promise to keep the baby locked up?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask that.\u201d\u201cWell, we don\u2019t need to reveal the baby to society.\u201d\u201cWhat about Alan or Rivetti?

There was no way she would believe a man who already broke his promise once.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Alan is better at caring for Ahn than I expected, so we can\u2019t keep him out.\u201d\u201cAhn?\u201d\u201cThe name of your son.\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes trembled as he spoke of her child. Viscount Roteschu continued without missing a beat.\u201cHow about this\u2014do you want to meet your son?\u201dRashta gave a surprising answer.\u201cNo.\u201dShe spoke without hesitation, but her expression said otherwise. At the ensuing silence, Viscount Roteschu gave a low chuckle, then left the room.Rashta started pacing the room back and forth, her lips pursed in confusion. She carried the baby for ten months, and loved him with all her heart. As soon as she recovered from the shattering pain of labor, her baby was killed. The shock of it had driven her mad, and she had lived in a state of pain and distress for months, until she decided to run away from Viscount Roteschu\u2019s estate, determined to die.But now Viscount Roteschu claimed the baby was alive, and now the enemy and the lover who abandoned her was raising that baby. Viscount Roteschu had said the child was dead to drive her to insanity, and now he said the child was alive to drive her to insanity. Rashta was tired of being manipulated by something she had never seen. It was like her child caught her ankle and dragged her deeper. However, she couldn\u2019t help but worry over him at the same time.Rashta stopped circling the room and collapsed into tears.***\u201cHow does it feel to have a baby?\u201dThe room turned quiet, and I took my eyes off my book and looked around. The ladies-in-waiting were looking at each other with stiffened expressions.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019I must have caused a misunderstanding, so I quickly laughed and pointed at my book.\u201cIt\u2019s about this story.\u201dThe preparations for the banquet were almost complete. Because of that, I had less work than usual and had been able to spend my time more leisurely. My words had caused the ladies-in-waiting to freeze.\u201cWould you like to have a baby, Your Majesty?\u201dCountess Eliza spoke to me cautiously, and I shook my head as I laughed.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dJust because I didn\u2019t mean it, however, it didn\u2019t mean that my thoughts weren\u2019t entirely devoid of the topic of babies. Now that Rashta was pregnant, I thought I should have a baby soon as well, in case of mishaps that may occur in the future if our babies had a large age gap. The law decreed that Rashta\u2019s child did not have the right to succession, but the law was not always followed. But having a baby now would be difficult between me and Sovieshu\u2026\u2018My god.\u2019But no matter how much I denied it, the awkward atmosphere in the room did not abate.\u201cI\u2019m going to give Miss Rashta\u2019s baby a present. Do you all have something prepared?\u201dI quickly brought up another topic to distract the ladies. It was not a pleasant one, but the awkward atmosphere dissolved away. The ladies grumbled, but no one said \u201cWhy would you give Miss Rashta\u2019s baby a present?\u201d When one celebrated the birth of the Emperor\u2019s baby, one should present a gift.\u201cI prepared clothes. Something that can save my face, but nothing that requires too much effort.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t decided what to prepare.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve chosen baby trinkets\u2026I\u2019m still thinking about it, but I might change it.\u201dAs I listened to the conversation, Countess Eliza turned to me cautiously.\u201cHave you thought about what gift to give, Your Majesty?\u201dThe ladies stopped talking and looked at me. I answered with a nod.\u201cI\u2019m going to give the baby a decorative sword.\u201d\u201cA sword? You\u2019re going to give that to the baby?\u201dLaura jumped up angrily as if she didn\u2019t like the answer.\u201cWhy would you give such a precious gift? You should just give a knitted hat, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cLaura, that would make her a laughingstock.\u201d\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t more strange to be considerate?\u201d\u201cLaura.\u201dThe countess shook her head firmly at Laura, who was heavily breathing through her nose. I wanted to say that I had a purpose, but I kept my mouth closed. I didn\u2019t want my words to leak out the same way it did with the dress incident. It was unclear whether the leak was intentional, but it was still better to take caution.\u201cLady Laura, I\u2019ll tell you the details later.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95 \u2013 Is It Impossible? (2)The Western king\u2019s funeral arrangements were made after his death. Preparing them in advance was considered a bad omen, no matter how severe the king\u2019s condition was. As such, the new king was required to organize his coronation as well as the funeral at the same time. Heinley might have been able to share the burden with a queen, but he was single and was busier as a result.After a hectic day, Heinley somberly made his way to the temporary underground crypt where his brother\u2019s coffin was placed. He wanted to remember his brother alone in a quiet and cool place, but when he arrived, there was already a familiar figure standing there.It was Heinley\u2019s sister-in-law and former Queen, Christa.\u201cSister-in-law?\u201dHeinley called to her awkwardly and approached. They did not meet face-to-face often, but when he did, he felt strange calling her \u201csister-in-law\u201d when she was usually called \u201cYour Majesty\u201d.Christa turned her head to look at him, and smiled weakly and wiped her eyes with her fingertips. She looked like she had been crying.\u201cAre you all right?\u201dHeinley stopped at about five steps away from her.\u201cWhere are your ladies-in-waiting? Why are you alone in this cold place?\u201d\u201cI wanted to be alone here.\u201d\u201cYou might catch a cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that weak.\u201dInstead of arguing, Heinley pulled a handkerchief from his breast pocket and offered it to her. Christa had tears in her eyes again.\u201cThank you.\u201dShe reached out her hand, but just as soon as her fingers were about to touch it, Heinley pulled back the handkerchief with an apology.Christa chuckled when she saw that the initial embroidered onto the handkerchief was not Heinley\u2019s own.\u201cIt must be someone else\u2019s.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026yes. Someone very important.\u201d\u201cImportant?\u201d\u201cAs important as the sun.\u201dShe studied the handkerchief but could not surmise the name the initial represented. Heinley tilted his head and pulled out a different handkerchief.\u201cThank you.\u201dShe stopped speculating the owner of the other handkerchief and dabbed her eyes.\u201cBefore my brother\u2019s death, he left a will to protect you.\u201dChrista\u2019s eyes widened with the handkerchief still held up to her eyes. However, she soon lowered it and gave a watery chuckle.\u201cHe is a kind man.\u201d\u201cIf someone does or says anything to you, please let me know.\u201d\u201cThank you for your words.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just words.\u201dAt the sincerity of Heinley\u2019s words, she gave a nod.\u201cI will.\u201dHeinley exchanged a few more words with Christa before he left the crypt. Next he made for a temporary office he was using until the coronation was over. McKenna was buried in a pile of papers, and he stood up with a groan when he spotted Heinley.\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time, and we\u2019re short of ten.\u201d\u201cThat is not enough.\u201d\u201cYou made me go and come back all the way from the Eastern Empire.\u201dHeinley ignored McKenna\u2019s complaints and looked down at the letters on the desk.\u201cThese are the coronation invitations.\u201dMcKenna explained quickly before Heinley even asked.\u201cEven small children will know you will be crowned king, but the coronation should still be open to major foreign leaders.\u201dHeinley nodded and flipped over one of the letters.\u201cWhat about the letters to be sent to the Eastern Empire?\u201d\u201cNot those. Here they are.\u201dMcKenna picked up four letters from the other side and Heinley confirmed all the recipients. Three of them were addressed to certain other nobles, while one was for the Emperor and Imperial family.And a member of the Imperial family\u2026\u201cThere is no chance, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything, McKenna.\u201d\u201cAre you wondering if the Eastern Empress will come?\u201d\u201cMcKenna\u2026sometimes it\u2019s more annoying when you tell the truth.\u201d\u201cShall I tell you hopeful lies instead?\u201dHeinley shot McKenna and irritated look, while McKenna fixed the prince with a concerned expression.\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m sure you know\u2026but she is the empress. Not only that, but an empress of a powerful country.\u201d\u201cShould I give up because she can never be my queen?\u201d\u201cWhat else can you do but give up?\u201d\u201c\u2026You have a smart head.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCount them again.\u201dMcKenna sighed and moved his hands busily, pretending to be looking over the invitations. However, he couldn\u2019t ignore Heinley, drunk on his first love.Heinley suddenly looked thoughtful, and McKenna had a sudden chill down his spine. Heinley had a very rational personality, but that didn\u2019t mean he did things normally; sometimes his behavior was quite dangerous and adventurous. The look on his face was reminiscent of that.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dMcKenna said his name before Heinley could speak. Heinley turned to him, and McKenna proposed something he had been thinking about for weeks.\u201cAs it\u2019s the will of the former king, why don\u2019t you prepare for a wedding?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a partner, McKenna. Who would it be?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find one.\u201d\u201cThe one I want is far away.\u201d\u201cYou still have to find one. There may be a match for you nearby.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s you.\u201dMcKenna suddenly became angry at Heinley\u2019s words.\u201cDon\u2019t tell terrible jokes.\u201dHeinley gave an icy smile.\u201cYou just said I can\u2019t marry anyone I want, but it has to be someone close to me.\u201dHe was in an unpleasant mood. McKenna started speaking weakly at first, but soon his voice gained strength.\u201cFirst of all, take a look at all of the brilliant women in the Western Kingdom. You\u2019re always traveling abroad, and you have no interaction with your citizens.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Your Highness. You may find another love like Empress Navier.\u201d\u201cOf course there are many wonderful ladies here, too.\u201dHeinley sighed heavily.\u201cBut what I want is her, not the woman who looks like her. No matter who much they resemble her, there\u2019s no point.\u201d***The days that I anticipated came slowly, while the days I dreaded suddenly came right under my nose.On the day of the banquet honoring Rashta\u2019s baby, the sun rose as usual, and by noontime the carriages began to converge into the palace. As it was a celebration of the Emperor\u2019s first baby, there were numerous visitors. Through a window I watched the carriages stream inside, the lavishness of the carriages indicating the wealth and importance of those who would attend.\u2018Will those people come to the same idea as Sovieshu?\u2019The idea that I should accept Rashta\u2019s baby because I will never have one of my own?\u2018\u2026Well, even if they don\u2019t think that, the Emperor\u2019s firstborn is still an important event.\u2019Even if Rashta\u2019s baby did not seek a succession, it could not be ignored by the nobles. As long as the child didn\u2019t lose the Emperor\u2019s favor, they were likely to become a high-ranking noble such as a duke or grand duke.After taking a deep breath, I turned around and went back to my room, changed my clothes, and went to the banquet hall. It was not as formal an occasion like the New Year\u2019s ball, so everyone was already laughing and talking.It was easy to spot Sovieshu and Rashta. Rashta was sitting on a soft couch specially placed at the back center of the hall, while Sovieshu stood by her side. Behind the couch were piles of gifts received from the guests. It was already a substantial amount, considering that the banquet had only started about an hour ago, and many still approached her holding colorful gift boxes. Some guests looked reluctant to be here, but others seemed genuinely eager to impress her.When I came closer, the crowd quietly stood back.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dAs soon as Rashta spotted me, an angelic smile spread on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you, Your Majesty. It had been an hour and I didn\u2019t think you were coming.\u201dUnlike Rashta, however, Sovieshu seemed nervous. The nobles curiously looked on.I presented my gift in silence. It was hard to discern what the object was, as it wrapped in shiny paper and tied with a ribbon. Rashta took it with both hands, looked at Sovieshu, then pulled the ribbon. She hadn\u2019t opened the other gifts, so she must have wondered what her present was. Or perhaps she wanted to show it off to the others.\u201cOh, this is\u2026!\u201dRashta\u2019s eyes widened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you, Your Majesty! How beautiful!\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cYes! It truly is gorgeous.\u201dRashta turned over the sword several times, her eyes shining in admiration at the jewel-studded hilt and finely etched details on the blade.\u201cTo have such a beautiful sword\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help smiling and making exclamations of appreciation. Clearly she didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the gift\u2026\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201dI didn\u2019t think it was necessary to explain it to her, and so I turned around.\u201cWell\u2026Your Majesty.\u201dRashta called out to me. I looked back at her, and she set the sword down on the sofa and came up to me with her hands folded on her stomach. What was she doing? She stood in front of me, gently rubbing her belly.\u201cThank you very much for coming. I\u2019m so happy. Rashta really wants to be friends with Her Majesty\u2026\u201dHer lovely voice, innocent demeanor, and warm gaze was enough to make up for her lack of court etiquette in other nobles\u2019 eyes. Her charm failed to impress me, however.I turned around instead of answering. I wasn\u2019t the woman of honor this day. I wanted to spend a few minutes greeting other friends and then retire to my room, but Rashta seemed to have more to say.\u201cYour Majesty, is\u2026is it alright if I ask you a favor?\u201dI looked at her indifferently.\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201dRashta put her hands together and looked at me with her large, dark eyes.\u201cI hope you will bless my baby.\u201dMany people often came to me to bless their baby, and Rashta\u2019s request wasn\u2019t unusual. However\u2026\u201cI must decline the request \u201dThis time, however, I didn\u2019t want to do it. I didn\u2019t think my blessings had any significant effect, and even if they did, I didn\u2019t want to bless Rashta\u2019s baby.Rashta\u2019s eyes widened as if she didn\u2019t expect me to refuse in public, looking the image of a kicked puppy.\u201cWill the child that receives my blessing be happy?\u201dRashta\u2019s face reddened.\u201cBut if you still want it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dRashta blushed to her ears and lowered her eyes. The pitiable sight seemed to stimulate Sovieshu to action, and he looked at me angrily and hissed at me in a small voice.\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201dSome people turned at the sound, and Sovieshu looked around and lowered his voice further.\u201cDo you have to embarrass me in front of all these people?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed.\u201d\u201cYou bless babies almost every day. Is it so hard for you to do it one more?\u201d\u201cSometimes words are heavier than a thousand gold pieces of gold.\u201d\u201cDo you understand what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cI do. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to hear it at a time like this.\u201dSovieshu fixed me a stony glare, and the nobles around us looked on even more curiously. I spoke in a voice barely above a whisper.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want drama, stop making it out to be one.\u201dSovieshu kept his face expressionless and turned around as if he were fed up. As Sovieshu stood by Rashta, she looked up at him with wide eyes and rubbed her hands on her belly. I couldn\u2019t see Sovieshu\u2019s expression because his back was turned to me, but it was obvious that they were in a world of their own.I didn\u2019t want to be here anymore, and so I turned around, but then changed my mind. I turned back and approached the sofa instead, and Sovieshu stared at me intently. \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 was clearly written all over his face.I walked between the two and spoke to Rashta.\u201cDo you still want my blessing? If you really want it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dI addressed Rashta, and then looked to Sovieshu. Although he wanted me to give a blessing, Sovieshu did not look happy, as if he suspected I had hidden a knife in my sleeves or skirt. But I did not hide knives in my clothes. I hid them in my tongue.Rashta gave a large smile and nodded. Her hand swept her stomach once more. I spoke slowly, staring at the belly that still showed no signs of swelling.\u201cDear child. Be like the sword I have gifted you. Gorgeous and beautiful.\u201dRashta was smiling. Did she really think I would curse her? Rashta looked up at Sovieshu brightly.\u201cThe Empress blessed our baby!\u201dDespite Rashta\u2019s delight, Sovieshu stared at me with a suspicious look. I wondered what he had to say. He didn\u2019t look away, but he silently wrapped Rashta\u2019s shoulders with his hands.Read the full chapter on WordExcerpt or Crystal Crater\u2019s Patreon.***Rashta settled back on the sofa as she gently caressed her stomach. She placed her hand on her belly whenever she wanted to talk to her child.\u2018Baby, look at them. Those proud nobles all came here to see you.\u2019\u2018Baby, look at them. Those people who would despise you for being a slave are now offering you gold and silver.\u2019\u2018Baby, look at them. They are all below you.\u2019This experience was different from when Rashta gained attention from being Sovieshu\u2019s concubine. She felt joyful at carrying the Emperor\u2019s baby and receiving the love of the people. Her status was once dependent on the whims of Sovieshu, but now she was the mother of his firstborn child, and no one could change that. Even the Empress, who treated her as if she were invisible, had given her a gift and blessed the baby!Rashta smiled as she stroked the beautiful blade given by Empress Navier. When her child was grown, she wanted them to be admired and have that sword at their waist, as proof that the child was loved by the Empress. The Empress may or may not be infertile, after all.\u2018If I can remove Viscount Roteschu\u2026\u2019The viscount was the only black cloud in her and her family\u2019s future.

But it was a man she wanted to avoid even more.The man standing there with his green eyes and dark brown hair was Alan Rimwell. Known as a mild-mannered man, he was also the son of Viscount Roteschu and the former lover of Rashta.She stared back at him. The shock of his appearance came a moment too late when she realized she wasn\u2019t waking up.How? Why was he here? Viscount Roteschu did say he would bring him to the capital, but\u2026Rashta turned as white as a sheet as she protectively wrapped her stomach with both hands.\u2018If Alan says even one wrong thing\u2026\u2019Alan didn\u2019t move, and simply looked on at Rashta as if he were a stone statue. Though he was not as terrified as she was, he looked like he was on the verge of tears himself.\u201cMiss?\u201dDuke Elgy called her from her side, and she hastily rearranged her expression and turned to give him a smile.\u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201dInstead of answering, the Duke Elgy turned his head in the direction she had been looking at.\u201cWho were you watching?\u201dRashta grabbed Duke Elgy\u2019s sleeve in alarm, and he turned back to look at the slender, scarred hand that clutched him.\u201cNothing. I was just thinking.\u201dRashta made up a story and quickly dropped her hand. Duke Elgy looked back in the direction that she was staring at, but Alan had already left.Rashta gave an inward sigh of relief. She didn\u2019t know what Alan would do, although according to Viscount Roteschu\u2019s words, his son wouldn\u2019t reveal the truth.\u201cWas it a bad thought?\u201dDuke Elgy propped himself against the sofa Rashta was sitting at with one hand. He looked positively wolf-like, and the ladies nearby swooned. Duke Elgy did not avoid the attention as a socialite, and instead made his posture even more inviting. Rashta gave a laugh at his bravado.\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t look so well.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dRashta tilted her head cutely and lifted the sword up to him.\u201cLook at this.\u201dDuke Elgy seated himself next to Rashta, and the surrounding nobles started to buzz. The duke was known to be a playboy, and now he was sitting close to the Emperor\u2019s concubine. However, neither Duke Elgy nor Rashta paid attention to the crowd\u2019s reaction.\u201cWas this a gift?\u201d\u201cYes. The Empress gave it to Rashta.\u201d\u201cThe Empress?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gift for the baby.\u201dRashta smiled more widely to push away her nervousness about Alan.\u201cMay I see?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRashta handed over the gift, and Duke Elgy withdrew the sword halfway from its scabbard. A smile flickered across his face as he inspected the hilt and blade with a careful eye.\u201cHow do you like it?\u201dThe duke nodded in satisfaction.\u201cIt\u2019s a very fine sword.\u201dRashta beamed with pride, but she sensed that something was off about Duke Elgy.\u201cWhat is it? Is there something strange about the sword?\u201d\u201cNothing strange, but\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cDid the Empress say anything special when she gave this to you?\u201d\u201cShe blessed my baby to be as beautiful as the sword.\u201dThe smile became clearer on Duke Elgy\u2019s face. Rashta looked at him curiously, and he explained.\u201cMiss. This sword is indeed very expensive, but it\u2019s purely decorative.\u201d\u201cDecorative\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt has no practical use as a weapon. It cannot be used in a duel, let alone a war.\u201dDuke Elgy looked in the direction of the Empress. She was surrounded by her close associates, and was also watching the duke. He continued to speak to Rashta as he kept his gaze fixed on the Empress.\u201cTo give you this sword means to live in splendor and beauty, but also to not work.\u201d\u201cThat\u2014that \u2026!\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a blessing, too.\u201dDuke Elgy murmured to himself as he dreamed of being able to live without working, but Rashta was already in a state of shock. The words were unpleasant in and of itself, but she was even more ashamed that she praised this gift in front of everyone else. The nobles were intelligent, so they must have understood the Empress\u2019s purpose. Rashta was the only one who didn\u2019t know. How ridiculous she must look to receive a gift that was given in mockery!\u201cThe Empress\u2026insulted me\u2026\u201dRashta pressed her lips tightly together as tears began to brim her eyes. She was pathetic. Eventually the tears spilled over to her cheeks, and Sovieshu rushed to her side.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Rashta? What happened?\u201dSovieshu glared at Duke Elgy, but the duke bowed gracefully and stepped away from the sofa.\u201cRashta, why are you crying on such a happy day?\u201dSovieshu ignored the duke\u2019s bow and did his best to comfort Rashta, but despite his efforts, she couldn\u2019t stop crying. She was already frightened when she saw Alan earlier, and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to speak.Sovieshu rubbed Rashta\u2019s shoulder, and he glared back at the nobles for an explanation. They quickly approached and reported the conversation between Duke Elgy and Rashta. Her shoulders began to tremble even harder, and Sovieshu sighed.\u201cDuke Elgy has a careless tongue.\u201d\u201cThe duke only helped Rashta not to look stupid, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry. You are the woman of honor today.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026but I\u2019m so sad.\u201dHer shoulders heaved with sobs, and she looked up at Sovieshu with her dark, jewel-like eyes.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? You knew what the Empress meant, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInstead of giving her an answer, Sovieshu patted her on the shoulder. His unspoken answer was clear as day. Rashta was once again convinced that Duke Elgy was far more dependable. She was correct in her decision to confide about her other baby to the duke rather than Sovieshu.Looking down at her trembling lips and eyelashes, Sovieshu gave another a sigh.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you could handle it, Rashta.\u201dRashta covered her belly with her hands and bowed her head.\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d\u201cScared?\u201dRashta spoke in a tiny voice.\u201cThe Empress looked down on me and the baby in front of everyone. If she\u2019s this outspoken, what if the Empress harasses the prince or princess later\u2026?\u201dAll she wanted was consolation and a promise that Sovieshu would protect their baby. Because the Empress spoke so harshly, she expected Sovieshu to side with her.However, Sovieshu was more surprised than anything else. It was because Rashta called the baby a prince or princess.Sovieshu wasn\u2019t the only one. The nobles listening in on the conversation noticeably stiffened and looked at each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)</b>Rashta seemed oblivious to the stir that her words caused. She lowered her head and looked weakly at the floor, but it wasn\u2019t her slip of the tongue that caused her to be gloomy.Sovieshu shot a silent rebuke at Viscountess Verdi standing nearby. However, she shook her head. She didn\u2019t talk to Rashta every day, let alone had heart-to-heart conversations with her. Viscountess Verdi had no opportunity to tell Rashta that her baby couldn\u2019t be royalty, and even if she did, she would be seen as provoking Rashta.That was the case for the lady-in-waiting. Sovieshu, however, had no such excuse.Unwilling to deal with this in front of the nobles any further, Sovieshu tried to pull Rashta up from the sofa.\u201cRashta, stand up.\u201dRashta was startled back into awareness, and she looked up at Sovieshu with tear-filled eyes.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cOh, Rashta\u2019s fine, Your Majesty. I can handle it.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to run away, Your Majesty. Rashta can overcome it.\u201dSovieshu was caught in a bind. The first thing young nobles learned as they made their debut in society was to swallow their pride and retreat. They may be at the top of hierarchy in their homes and estates, but as they entered high society, they were thrown into a setting where everyone else was richer, higher, and more powerful. The same was true even of a duke\u2019s offspring, and only the Imperial family was the exception to this food chain.Rashta knew nothing of the aristocracy, however, and as a result, she stubbornly tried to preserve her pride, leaving Sovieshu in a quandary.Sovieshu walked ahead of her, with a firm glance indicating that she should follow. Only then did she realize that he wasn\u2019t going to appease her. He seemed to want to tell her something that he couldn\u2019t say in public.Rashta hurriedly followed Sovieshu.***\u201c\u2026Why would he do that?\u201dAs I muttered to myself, Laura looked at me curiously then turned her head in the direction I was looking at. Duke Elgy was sitting next to Rashta on the sofa, leaning towards her and speaking.\u201cWow. Can they sit close together like that?\u201dLaura clicked her tongue. As she observed, the distance between Duke Elgy and Rashta was almost nonexistent. Laura wasn\u2019t the only one; other nobles were casting curious looks at the pair sitting on the sofa. Sovieshu had glanced at Duke Elgy and Rashta, but he turned his head back towards his chief secretary and continued his conversation.\u201cDuke Elgy must have eyes on his feet if he keeps socializing with her.\u201dLaura grumbled in small voice and turned back to her friend, unwilling to look anymore. Almost at the same time, Duke Elgy cast a glance at me, and he smiled faintly when our eyes met. It was a friendly smile, but I wasn\u2019t fooled. They were talking while touching the gift I gave to Rashta.Duke Elgy said something, and Rashta\u2019s smiling face quickly hardened. I didn\u2019t know what he said, but it certainly provoked a reaction from her.Did that man suddenly smile at me? Ridiculous. However, he could smile as much as he wanted.I smiled gently back in return.Duke Elgy looked startled for a moment, but soon lifted his lips and turned his head.***Sovieshu took Rashta to his bedroom to calmly explain several things to her.\u201cRashta. Your baby cannot be a prince or princess.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRashta stared at him in surprise.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Why?\u201d\u201cChildren of concubines don\u2019t receive that title.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShe continued to stare at him in bewilderment.\u201cBut they\u2019re the emperor\u2019s children, aren\u2019t they? Don\u2019t all the emperors\u2019 children count as royalty?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only the children with the empress who have that title.\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201dEven after listening to his explanation, she still couldn\u2019t comprehend it. An emperor\u2019s child could not be considered a prince or princess?\u201cThen what do you call my children? Aren\u2019t they part of the Imperial family?\u201dSovieshu was torn. He had enjoyed regaling Rashta stories of the nobles and Imperial family, but he couldn\u2019t do it this time, let alone tell her that her children may try to hurt the Empress\u2019 children.\u201cThe children will become high nobility. They won\u2019t be royalty, but they will be treated well.\u201dDespite his efforts, Rashta started to cry.\u201cThis not right, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cRashta.\u201d\u201cMy baby and the Empress\u2019 baby will have your blood. She became an empress only through marriage anyway, and the empress is not the emperor. But why are only the babies of the empress considered royalty?\u201dRashta continued to cling on stubbornly.\u201cThat is the law.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a sham law. You can change it.\u201d\u201cRashta.\u201d\u201cThe emperor is the law. You can do anything you please.\u201dSovieshu was forced to delve into a lengthy explanation for the reason and the history of the law, but Rashta remained unmoved.\u201cMy baby is deprived of their identity because of another baby who is not born and might never be born. Rashta can never understand. It does not make sense.\u201dIn the end, Sovieshu was forced to draw a line.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t understand it, it is a law that is written in the great church, and even the emperor cannot change it by himself. So from now on, don\u2019t talk about princes or princesses in front of others. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201dShe choked up in shock.\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s baby\u2026\u201d\u201cI will love them and give them vast wealth and power. Even if they are not called a prince or princess, everyone will know they\u2019re my child. All they won\u2019t have is legal succession, so there is no reason to be disappointed. Alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRashta pressed her lips together and did not answer. She turned away from him, and Sovieshu sighed.\u201cIf the empress is infertile and can\u2019t have children, then it would be a different story. \u201d\u201c\u2026How?\u201d\u201cPerhaps the baby will be adopted by the Empress, and then they will be recognized as royalty.\u201dSovieshu couldn\u2019t stay long here and had to return to the banquet. After he left, Rashta huddled in a corner, hugging her legs and dropping her forehead to her knees.She would bear the Emperor\u2019s child, but they would not be considered royalty. It was too unfair. It was all because she wasn\u2019t an empress.Rashta burst into tears. Sandry, a maid who had been waiting and listening to their conversation, walked over to comfort her.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Miss Rashta.\u201dSandry had replaced Cherily, the latter who quit her job as a maid after the scandal with Prince Heinley.\u201cBut the tears keep coming out.\u201dRashta spoke sadly, wiping her eyes with her sleeves.\u201cRashta is a commoner, and I\u2019m grateful to be loved by His Majesty. But the baby. This is His Majesty\u2019s child. How upset will you be if your child is not treated as your own?\u201d\u201cMiss Rashta\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if the Empress has a baby, they will be younger than mine. Her child will be treated like a prince or princess, and my child will be sad to live beneath them\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Rashta. Many years have passed since the Empress has become an adult, and she still hasn\u2019t given the Emperor a child.\u201d\u201cBut Rashta has a baby, right?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s proved that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the Emperor, so it\u2019s very likely that the Empress is infertile. As the Emperor said, Rashta\u2019s baby may eventually be adopted by the Empress.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
