    "Chapter 1": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/No MoralPrologueNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCourts are the epitome of the law of the jungle.Blows are exchanged in the fierce battle atop Lady Justice\u2019s shoulders, and upon commencement of the methodical fight between the defenders of justice and truth, the almighty goddess holds up the hand of the strongest.Here, strength does not mean material wealth or power.At times, the well-prepared David can defeat Goliath, who underestimated his opponent.Attorney Yoonshin Do liked this unconventional aspect of this otherwise solemn place.\u201cCounsel, please proceed with your closing statement.\u201d The judge who sat facing the criminal court glanced at the defendant\u2019s table. In his dark gray suit and clean dress shirt, Yoonshin stood from his seat on the right of the court and bowed his head respectfully. Then, he stepped out toward the central aisle of the courtroom.Clack, clack.Back straight, Yoonshin\u2019s figure was sleek and neat as he walked to the podium. His prim face gave a docile impression, but his eyes glinted with intellect and sharpness.His pale and slim face looked around the public gallery briefly, eyes filled with the tenacious determination to grasp the result that he desired in this arena.\u201cYour Honor, first, I would like to show my appreciation to the Court\u2014thank you, to the prosecutor who invested the last few months in this trial, and to the public who came to witness this hearing. Now, I would like to address the main issue of this case.\u201dIn this case, a famous athlete was a*saulted with a weapon by their common-law partner and was brutally murdered. Yoonshin was the defense counsel. The deceased had won numerous gold medals at the Summer Olympics for several years, so he was a national hero. Following that, there was immense interest from the press and average citizens.When Yoonshin first learned of the case through the news, he thought the motivation would be something relatively common like fidelity or financial issues. After the investigation, there was evidence of minor conflicts and the accused refused to appoint a defense attorney. The suspicions of her guilt started to crystallize.However, the truth of the matter that Yoonshin coincidentally learned told a different story. Beneath the surface, there were countless mitigating circ*mstances. For a very long time, the accused suffered severe mental abuse from the complainant to the point that the last remnants of her dignity were obliterated.From that day onward, Yoonshin visited the woman and persistently attempted to convince her.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll help you. You may be sitting in the deep of night now, but you are not there alone.\u201d\u201cThis case has some unique features. The tragic situation and facts forced the defendant to pick up and swing a blunt weapon after she was unable to withstand the regular, sadistic abuse incurred by her tormenter. Throughout this trial, I presented the vast amount of evidence of the inhumane treatment suffered by the defendant over the past eight years of cohabitation,\u201d Yoonshin carried out his oral argument logically while facing the judge, standing straight. His steady diction and speech were unexpectedly captivating. All ears in the courtroom listened attentively to his words.While Yoonshin was absorbed in his duties, at the far end of the public gallery, Sehun Kang, a partner at the law firm \u201cDoguk\u201d sat with his legs crossed as he watched Yoonshin intently.Sehun\u2019s frame, firmly built with regular exercise, was quite dashing, draped in his luxurious suit. His elegant visage that looked as if his creator invested long hours to meticulously sculpt blended harmoniously with the arrogant glint in his eyes.No hint of empathy was directed toward the defendant nor the plaintiff in Sehun\u2019s cold eyes. His piercing gaze, callous and made of stone, fixed firmly on Yoonshin like an arrow piercing its target. His large hands stroked his smooth chin as he scanned the defense attorney from head to toe.\u201cAttorney Yoonshin Do\u2026\u201d\u00a0he mused.Yoonshin\u2019s trim appearance, tidy attire, composed voice, and sincere attitude were impressive, but above all, what piqued Sehun\u2019s interest was the conviction that Yoonshin had in his statement.This was not a self-imposed illusion to ease one\u2019s nerves or useless obstinacy preoccupied with victory. Yoonshin was a lawyer who truly believed in his client\u2019s honesty and truthfulness. He knew better than anyone that this was the only way to bring justice to the victim.Yoonshin\u2019s meek face masked his strong sense of responsibility and professional mindset. Even for Sehun, a scathing critic of other people, Yoonshin surpa*sed Sehun\u2019s standard of a lawyer.Nevertheless, if Sehun were asked if he wanted to take Yoonshin under his wing, the answer was a resounding no.Sehun\u2019s interest was unbeknownst to Yoonshin, who was racing toward the end of his closing statement. Yoonshin\u2019s voice grew more vigorous. \u201cMurder is a crime. It deserves punishment. However, our Constitution provides for basic human rights. I respectfully ask that the Court consider this. For eight years, the defendant was subjected to constant abuse behind closed doors, and her actions cannot be likened to just another crime committed in the heat of the moment. Your Honor, have you read\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0by Charles d*ckens?\u201dThe presiding judge, who sat in the middle as he listened intently to the closing, nodded. Yoonshin smiled softly as if he was glad to find a commonality with the judge. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite piece of literature. This pa*sage appeared in the book, and I paraphrase\u2026\u201dThen, Yoonshin turned his body to look at the gallery.At that moment, he was suddenly lost for words. He met eyes with Sehun, who had been fixated on Yoonshin. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t count how many times this had happened already.There was nobody in the profession who didn\u2019t know Sehun Kang of the law firm Doguk.He had many followers and even more rivals.Yoonshin couldn\u2019t understand why someone, who was so busy that he needed to schedule time to breathe, came here. His unexpected attendance and his predatory eyes that vied for a moment to rip him to pieces were honestly uncomfortable.\u2018I don\u2019t think we would make a good match after all,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought to himself.Yoonshin held the sharp stare that he didn\u2019t know the meaning to for a moment then turned back to the judge and continued, \u201c\u2018How awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude?\u2019 Your Honor, we cannot allow the defendant to freeze to death, alone, in the barren and bitter outdoors. I hope that you can confirm once again that human rights are alive in our law. Thank you.\u201dUpon completing his statement, Yoonshin returned to his seat on the side of the defense. The judge then asked the defendant to stand for the last order of events, the defendant\u2019s final statement. Finally, the defendant, whose head was bowed throughout the length of the trial, opened her mouth with difficulty.While this was happening, Yoonshin gave a look of encouragement to his client before he exchanged a quick glance with another partner from Doguk, Mihee Song.Sehun, who was watching all of this, leaned down to Mihee and whispered in a low voice. His subdued voice was crisp and clean. \u201cCounsel, do you know that lawyer? It sure looks to be the case.\u201d\u201cYoonshin Do? Just a little. He takes mostly labor law cases and works at a small law office. It seems like he\u2019s doing this case free of charge. In any case, what did you think about the trial? Do you think he\u2019s a catch?\u201dDoguk was a big firm, one of the top five law firms in the Republic of Korea. A talent with a prosecutorial background to lead the litigation group was always direly needed.Mihee was the head recruitment manager and used this excuse to convince Sehun to accompany her to observe this public trial. She said that she had her eyes on a recruit and wanted him to see him before she recommended him to the director of the firm. Sehun had barely made enough time for this trial, but it was more boring than expected.\u201cYou really want to recruit that prosecutor?\u201d Sehun asked.\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t like him? He seems decent to me.\u201d\u201cHe seems decent to you? Did I hear that right?\u201d Sehun looked to be in disbelief and let out a languid sigh before rubbing his face with his hands. Mihee fell silent, so Sehun added dryly, \u201cReconsider him. I can\u2019t let a lawyer like him, who loses to one working pro bono, earn six digits annually. Mihee, you\u2019re the one who recruited me to Doguk. Don\u2019t embarra*s me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too stingy. Mr. Do was just very well-prepared for this case. Plus, there was a large amount of evidence in his favor,\u201d Mihee retorted.\u201cEvidence is the foundation of a criminal procedure. I squeezed out all the time that I didn\u2019t have because I expected to watch a talent neutralize the insurmountable flurry of evidence against him and turn the case on its heels. I\u2019d say it would be a bigger gain if you had instead brought the opposing counsel to our firm.\u201d\u201cJust as I thought, Yoonshin Do is quite talented even in your very particular standards, right?\u201d Mihee asked.Sehun\u2019s eyes, glaring questioningly at Mihee, were brimming with irritation. Then, as if he understood his co-worker\u2019s intention by inference, he turned his eyes to the defense sitting on the right side of the courtroom. The one who Mihee truly wanted to show him wasn\u2019t the prosecutor but the defense counsel. She must have been aiming for this paradoxical effect.Capable lawyers can recognize others similar to them. Sehun recognized from first glance that Yoonshin was quite a worthwhile lawyer. However, Yoonshin didn\u2019t look desperate enough for his personal success to grit his teeth and weather through Doguk. Even though the eyes of the media were on him, it was evident that he put the defendant first instead of presenting himself in a veneer of sophistication, which confirmed Sehun\u2019s hunch.Plus, he was a lawyer willing to defend the weak and powerless. He was not a good fit for Doguk, which prioritized successful outcomes.\u201cHelp or pity to one who was bound to freeze to death\u2026\u201d\u00a0Sehun ruminated on the pa*sage he had just heard and fixed his gaze on Yoonshin.\u00a0\u201cOnly affluent people like you could extend that kind of helping hand.\u201dYoonshin warmly grasped the hand of the defendant, who had just finished her final statement, and as if he felt Sehun\u2019s gaze, he looked around and stared back. Sehun could see the perplexity in the other\u2019s face, wondering why they kept meeting eyes.Yoonshin\u2019s na\u00efve face was so honest that Sehun felt like it could see through the other party. It strangely made a mess of Sehun\u2019s mind.Upon acknowledging that, Sehun knit his brows and quietly picked up his blazer jacket. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough. I\u2019m going ahead.\u201d\u201cWait. So how about Yoonshin, then?\u201d Mihee hurriedly asked.\u201cOf course, this was her goal,\u201d\u00a0Sehun thought as he got up from his seat. \u201cSeems like you baited me with the prosecutor on purpose because you knew I would throw a wrench in your plans if you showed me the other guy first. I\u2019m even more opposed to that attorney. I loathe people who are smart on top of being just. They\u2019re bound to cause trouble. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cHey, you only just saw him once\u2026 Are you going back to the office? Sehun!\u201dThe two who were discussing in quiet susurrations so as not to disturb the trial were completely split in an instant. Sehun left without so much as a reply, and Mihee shook her head, unable to hold him back.He strode out of the courtroom without hesitation, and soon, he escaped the somber room.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/No MoralCH 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 1 - Unforeseen Meeting (1)As Sehun walked toward the elevator, he could hear the whispers.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Attorney Sehun Kang from Doguk? Is he related to this case?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s he up to? Why\u2019s he here?\u201d\u201cIs there anyone who got a good shot of him entering the building? A full-body one.\u201dUpon discovering Sehun, the flock of reporters camping outside the courtroom murmured amongst themselves as they started to gather around his lean body.For large-scale law firms, their main source of income was from giving legal advice to corporate dealings rather than from litigations in civil suits. Within corporate dealings, the two most prominent areas of consultation that came with high retainer fees were financial and corporate law, but these two areas were different in substance. The former needed strong an*lytical thinking while the latter required flexibility in thought. Sehun was exceptional at processing both areas of law. Furthermore, he was adept at various kinds of litigation. He minimized his exposure to the media, but it was a given that reporters who frequented the courts knew him.Standing nearby, Sehun\u2019s chauffeur approached Sehun, who was crowded by people. However, Sehun put up a hand signaling the other to wait and listened to the onslaught of questions pouring out from the reporters.\u201cAren\u2019t you Doguk\u2019s Sehun Kang? If I remember correctly, you don\u2019t take on average criminal cases. What brought you here today?\u201d\u201cThis is because you acknowledge that the press is bad for the recent corporate restructuring case, correct? To my knowledge, the displaced workers gathered to protest against the company and Doguk, denouncing your actions!\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s not the case, are you pa*sing the hot potato onto the current interest of the media? If it is, please tell us if this was discussed in advance with the defense counsel!\u201dSehun\u2019s eye-catching looks and acrimonious parlance were the perfect prey for the media. When needed, he gladly tossed food for the vultures. However, today was not such a day.Sehun, who had patiently listened, waved his hand elegantly requesting silence, then spoke with gravitas, \u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point. The reason I visited this courthouse was for personal reasons. I did not come here officially on behalf of Doguk. If I come across any speculative articles released, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action against you. That is all. I have no further comments, so please, step aside.\u201dAfter his brief answer, he gestured for his driver to come over. The man came and opened a path among the field of people. Sehun walked by the reporters and stood in front of the elevator.Finally, the double-doored elevator opened and the two boarded the lift.\u201cMr. Kang, are you leaving like this?\u201d\u201cSay something, Mr. Kang!\u201dHe ignored the desperate calls for him and personally pressed the close button.Zing. As soon as the doors closed, his poker face collapsed in annoyance. Sehun hated the interest others had in him. In addition, he abhorred the loud voices that provided no benefit to him and pierced his eardrums. Unfortunately, he was plagued with the general majority, contrary to his will.\u201cCan\u2019t people tune down their vocal frequencies to match Yoonshin Do?\u201d Sehun said.At his random remark, the driver who was covertly checking on Sehun flinched and replied, \u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cHah. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s go down quietly.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t have come here.Sehun, who was peering at the elevator panel, frowned in irritation.Act 01Screech.The vehicle carrying Yoonshin stopped at a shared basement parking garage of a multi-purpose mixed residential and commercial building complex near the law firm district in Seocho-dong. The garage was densely packed with expensive sedans and supercars.The entrance leading to the hallway exclusive to the parking lot was fashioned like an art gallery entrance with grandiose patterns decorating the surface. Past the entrance was an extravagant hall reminiscent of a festive Christmas lobby in a renowned hotel. To exaggerate slightly, from the very entrance of the building to the neighborhood park at the back, it seemed like a small, standalone kingdom.This apartment, lavish even at first glance, was a company residence that belonged to the law firm Doguk.Doguk employed around four hundred lawyers, one hundred patent attorneys, and other personnel required to maintain intellectual property rights for a total of nearly one thousand full-time professional staff.If any of their professional personnel wished, they could reside at a unit in the residences, a*signed according to their position in the firm. For welfare purposes, the employee\u2019s family was allowed, so the three buildings in the residential complex were almost completely filled by over one thousand households. Apparently, Sehun Kang lived in Building A on the \u201cRoyal Floor,\u201d which had the largest square footage. Yoonshin also moved in recently to this complex.Yoonshin started to gather the files that were placed in his backseat but paused to pick up and look at his resume.\u201cIs this really all right? I\u2019ve never gotten a job from my connections before\u2026\u201d\u00a0he thought.A few weeks ago, Yoonshin was contacted by his elder sister.The siblings\u2019 relationship was quite close. Their father raised the two children by himself and his significantly older sister, Ikyung, practically raised Yoonshin like her son. After their father pa*sed away, they were left alone in the world and naturally depended on each other. They were unable to meet frequently after Ikyung got married, but one of the things that Yoonshin was determined to follow was his sister\u2019s words.So, when she asked him to submit a resume to Doguk, he was quite taken aback\u2014even more so when she told him that his spot was already made and announced that all he had to do was walk in. This was quite unprecedented since she had never ordered him to do this or that before.\u2018So that was why Mr. Kang came to watch my trial with Senior Attorney Song,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought. His sister wanted Yoonshin to find a financially stable job instead of working all day and night for very little gain. She advised him that if he had experience at Doguk, he would be able to carry more credibility in court. He could feel her fondness and worry for her lonesome brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Conflict\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something between you and Doguk, but not with me. I was against it,\u201d Sehun stated.Yoonshin thought all the discussions were done and over. Was that not the case?He was told that Mihee Song and his sister dealt with the matter about his employment at the firm. It was still fresh in his memory that Mihee and Sehun came to watch his trial a few weeks ago, so he had no doubts about it and believed it wholeheartedly. He had already moved to the company residences at this point, but hearing that the walking billboard of Doguk was against him was quite a shock.Yoonshin couldn\u2019t say that out loud, so Sehun continued. He sounded composed but his expression and tone were vaguely cynical. \u201cI enjoyed the trial. I also enjoy Charles d*ckens. The excerpt from\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0was very fitting. Your arguments were concise.\u201d\u201cThank y\u2014\u201d The naturally polite Yoonshin almost involuntarily expressed his gratitude.However, the other cut him off sharply, \u201cHold your thanks until I\u2019m done talking. You might not want to thank me after.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything personal against you, but in my view, you\u2019re not a good fit for a large firm. There are still many people out there who have been pushed to the brink of freezing to death. Helping those people is better suited to your personal sense of ethics, isn\u2019t that right?\u201dYoonshin didn\u2019t like the sarcastic nuance in Sehun\u2019s tone, but there were no holes in his point, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t refute. It was true that working at Doguk conflicted with his personal moral sense and duties.However, the world didn\u2019t revolve around an individual\u2019s wishes. Yoonshin didn\u2019t get into this firm because he desperately wanted to. There was no way an experienced lawyer like Sehun didn\u2019t know this. There was only one reason such a man called out to Yoonshin to say these things to him.It was a warning of sorts.\u201cWhy tell this to me when my employment has already been decided?\u201d\u201cI hate when things with no causal link to me happen. I wanted to let you know that I hope that we don\u2019t need to see each other on a professional level. Let\u2019s keep it to passing by each other infrequently around the apartment\u2014just coincidentally.\u201d Apparently, that was all that Sehun had to say because he silently nodded, signaling his departure, and turned to leave. This all happened before Yoonshin could gather his thoughts. Naturally, he missed the right time to reply.Yoonshin wanted to retaliate since he was suddenly barraged by the other, but he could only bite his lower lip as he watched the other grow farther. Sehun took a few more steps and turned into the hall of Building A. Yoonshin saw him walking toward the elevator beyond the transparent glass door of the hall. Soon after, the double doors of the elevator opened their maws and carried the other away from their short rendezvous.When Sehun disappeared from his sight and he was now alone, Yoonshin\u2019s calm face morphed slowly into one of incredulity.\u2018His expression, tone, and audacity\u2026 Urgh.\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin shuddered and looked in the opposite direction from where Sehun disappeared\u2014Building C, Yoonshin\u2019s destination.He grabbed the elevator with patience and finally returned home.Yoonshin loosened his tie and called his sister\u2019s secretary. The person on the other end of the line picked up almost instantly. \u201cYes, Mr. Do. How can I help you?\u201d\u201cHi, it\u2019s Yoonshin. I just wanted to ask you something. I ran into Doguk\u2019s Sehun Kang in the apartment\u2019s parking lot lobby. But he told me he was against bringing me here.\u201d\u201cYou see, it seems like there was a slight conflict of opinions between Ms. Song and Mr. Kang, but\u2026 Your matter will proceed smoothly. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dYoonshin frowned when he heard that.Back in the lobby, Sehun conveyed a lot of information in just a few words. These were Doguk\u2019s private residences. Saying that they should only meet by coincidence meant that Yoonshin\u2019s employment matter was already decided, so Sehun would turn a blind eye to it. So, when Sehun said he hoped that they would not need to meet professionally, this implied that coincidentally meeting was Sehun\u2019s limit to how far he would tolerate Yoonshin, so Yoonshin should do his best not to get in Sehun\u2019s way outside of the residences.Yoonshin already knew that he wouldn\u2019t get along with someone like Sehun. Strictly speaking, Yoonshin got his job through nepotism, so perhaps that was why Sehun\u2014who valued skills and ability\u2014did not approve of Yoonshin. But no matter how unfortunate the circ*mstances, an almighty partner holding back a small-time lawyer like himself to give him a warning came across as significant.Sehun clearly did not welcome Yoonshin and reacted quite sensitively.Yoonshin had originally planned to quietly bear with it for a few years as his sister had hoped, but Yoonshin got a bad feeling about this.\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to like me at all. I heard that the hierarchy in a large firm was very distinct. Do you think he could put me at a disadvantage? I heard that, at Doguk, Attorney Kang\u2019s word is the law.\u201d\u201cIf you really feel bothered, should I convey this to Mrs. Do? She could come up with a solution,\u201d the secretary offered.\u201cNo, I could be placed in an even worse position if they misinterpret me\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it a bit more. Anyways, is Ikyung doing well? After our last meeting, I haven\u2019t really heard from her. How is she?\u201dThe other person, who had answered readily, suddenly fell silent for a moment as if hesitating. Then, Yoonshin heard the calm voice answer, \u201cOf course. Mr. Do, I\u2019m really sorry, but if that\u2019s all you wanted to ask, could I hang up? I was in the middle of some important business. If there is anything else you need in the future, please feel free to contact me again.\u201d\u201cOh, I must have interrupted you in the middle of work. I will. Good luck on the rest of your work.\u201dThe secretary politely said goodbye to Yoonshin, who was dwelling upon the secretary\u2019s answer, then hung up. The secretary clearly hesitated when Yoonshin asked how his sister was doing. Moreover, it seemed like the other was afraid that this topic would continue and rushed to end the conversation. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t deduce the exact reason.Yoonshin tried his best to repress this dubious feeling and went into his study instead of his bedroom. He perched on the edge of his long desk and stared at the acrylic board that was propped up against the wall. The board had a directory of names of the lawyers at Doguk, international lawyers, accountants, and patent attorneys with their profile pictures. He had set this up so he could memorize at least the important people in the firm that had the most power.\u201cSehun Kang\u2026 He has quite a colorful career.\u201d Yoonshin traced his eyes from the bottom to the top and affixed them on the partners right below the director. Sehun was the only young lawyer amongst the middle-aged lawyers. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be very surprising if he were a young partner in a relatively newer firm, but he was visibly young for a partner at a huge law firm. However, this fact alone proved that Sehun was on the up and up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - ConflictAfter he enrolled as the youngest student at Korea University, he graduated from law school and entered Doguk. For the years after, he stood out with his skills as a junior associate before going to study abroad in America. After he was admitted to the Bar in the state that he was in, his net worth increased significantly by the time he returned.At the time, most other large law firms attempted to recruit him, but he chose to return to Doguk where Mihee, his senior from his alma mater, was. Afterward, his income was significant enough to swiftly rise to the top as a partner of the firm.In a law firm, a skilled partner\u2019s words were absolute, especially to an associate.Naturally, Yoonshin thought back to the words aimed at him.\u201cI hate when something that has no causal link to me happens.\u201dSehun looked like the type of person to be bothered about it, as he had said. He looked like a cold and rational person who detested all things that couldn\u2019t be explained logically. Yoonshin had heard many things about him over the years and wondered if any of them were true, but after meeting him in person and conversing, Yoonshin started to think that Sehun was colder than the rumors claimed.Yoonshin already knew that he would have a hard time at the firm even if everyone welcomed him there, but for Sehun to have a bad first impression of him made the situation even worse. Sehun was a valuable partner at the firm, so Yoonshin sincerely hoped that he wouldn\u2019t run into Sehun at work. On top of that, they lived in different buildings, so as long as the time they went to work didn\u2019t overlap, there weren\u2019t very many chances for them to cross paths.Strangely enough, Yoonshin still got a bad feeling about the situation.\u201cWhat a predicament.\u201dYoonshin tapped on Sehun\u2019s picture and sighed softly.* * *On the small reception couches in Mihee\u2019s office, the room\u2019s owner sat across from Sehun. Sehun, watching the other side sitting with her legs crossed, looked completely astonished. Behind his head, the monitor was displaying the news. On-screen was the sharp and fierce face of the second son of Soohan Group, who was also Yoonshin\u2019s brother-in-law.The reporter\u2019s voice flowed out of the screen, \u201cThis afternoon, in a conference room in Soohan Group\u2019s headquarters in Gangnam, Director Jeongwon Yoo of Soohan Holdings opened a press conference addressing his position regarding the recent controversy on the assault of one employee.\u201dBeep. Mihee turned off the television monitor playing behind Sehun with her remote. Sehun spoke when the tranquility of the room was restored.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you chose the associate that I would supervise without consulting me first,\u201d Sehun spat out in a sluggish tone.Mihee grinned awkwardly. \u201cSehun, I heard that Yoonshin is quite meticulous. Not only does he see things through to the end, but he is also detail-oriented, good at finding precedents, and great at reading investigation reports on file. Plus, he says everything he needs to without getting intimidated by seniors with more years of practice. You like associates like that, ones who are good at work and are tenacious.\u201d\u201cOf course, I admit that I do\u2014that is if they understand what I say.\u201d\u201cSehun, how about having an open mind\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you wanted my mind to be open, you should have asked for my opinion. You already gave him an apartment.\u201dMihee couldn\u2019t retort to that, so she stopped talking. Sehun took that chance to add, \u201cI clearly told you that I didn\u2019t want him. If you were going to recruit him while ignoring my opinion, the least you could do is not send him my way. Can\u2019t you gauge his personality at all? He can\u2019t work under me. \u2018This is against the law.\u2019 \u2018This is against professional ethics.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you feel sorry for the other company that will be absorbed in this M&A?\u2019 He\u2019s going to interfere with each and every little thing. I can\u2019t stand an associate on the lookout coming at me and wasting my time like that. Send him away.\u201d\u201cSee, that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Mihee replied.\u201cThen send him to the litigation group. That, at least, would be a better fit for him. I can\u2019t keep him. Is work a joke to you?\u201dSehun was coming out pretty strong, and Mihee replied, trying to persuade him, \u201cSenior Attorney Kang\u2014no, Team Leader Sehun Kang. There are jobs for juniors to do in each team. But your team is the only one without any junior lawyers. I repeat, the corporate law group, the most important team in our firm, has no junior associates. Guess why?\u201d\u201cBecause none of the b*stards meet my standards.\u201d\u201cExactly! All the lawyers that I sent to you raised their white flags! Because of your twisted personality, they become unconfident, cry, and quit. It\u2019s happened so often that there are no young lawyers, and only durable senior lawyers survived, you know? I recruited and accepted Yoonshin Do because I sized him up, and I think he\u2019s a good fit. Don\u2019t you think that you need at least a couple of juniors to assign small and tedious tasks to?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Condition PrecedentSehun wanted to protest, unable to accept the situation, but Mihee raised her hand and stopped him from what he wanted to say. She instead picked up the receiver to the intercom and called her secretary. \u201cAttorney Do is waiting, right? Tell him to sit in Attorney Kang\u2019s office. I\u2019ll send Attorney Kang down in 10 minutes.\u201dAfter her short conversation, she placed the receiver back down and made a small flick with her head, pointing at Sehun to leave. He laughed hollowly as he witnessed the situation unfold, \u201cSo this was why.\u201d\u201cSehun, just try him out first. It\u2019s not too late to talk about this after. He\u2019s a really smart kid.\u201d\u201cThis was why. He\u2019s the first lawyer to come in with his connections since you brought me here. It must mean that he has some value for you to bring him, although not as valuable as me. But we have more than just a few partners at our firm and over 20 departments, so it\u2019s odd to shove him to me, who\u2019s unwilling to take him on. There\u2019s a reason you need to place him next to me other than his inherent abilities as a lawyer.\u201dIt was a bullseye. To begin with, Sehun was quick on the uptake, so Mihee didn\u2019t expect to fool him. She could only grin awkwardly in response. Thanks to that, he grew more certain of his conviction. \u201cYou\u2019re not even trying to hide it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so fussy. From the moment you went with me to test the waters, you knew that he was the son of our former teacher, Professor Do from Korea University Law School, who taught us civil procedure. They\u2019re alike in many ways.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t work for sentimental reasons like that. Do you seriously not know my market value?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just for sentimental reasons. A lot depends on this. When I say he\u2019s the son of Professor Do, it also means he\u2019s the only younger brother of Soohan Group\u2019s second son\u2019s wife, Ikyung Do. You saw Ms. Do at our professor\u2019s funeral last time. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201dSehun reminisced on what happened in his past and suddenly bit down on his lip very hard. He looked slightly uncomfortable for a moment. Mihee noticed that his reaction was different from before and asked, \u201cSehun Kang. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Sehun dismissed.\u201cAnyway, Sehun, you have to bend to this one. It\u2019s for the sake of the firm. You know that I don\u2019t normally ask you things of this nature. That\u2019s how important this is.\u201dDue to the profit-centered structure, the firm couldn\u2019t be divorced from business with large corporations. Plus, they were important clients that the firm couldn\u2019t afford to lose. What brought money to a law firm were not the lawsuits by individuals. Most of the profit came from resolving disputes between corporations or advising corporations on their investments and selling companies.Among the domestic companies, the general president of Soohan Group was connected to Mihee\u2019s father, the executive director of Doguk. Thanks to that, since the firm\u2019s founding, Soohan Group deferred many of their matters to Doguk. In addition, when subsidiary companies needed legal advice for their projects, they were referred to Doguk. With the firm\u2019s position in mind, this was a request that they couldn\u2019t ignore.Sehun stared at the woman sitting across from him before he leaned back hard enough to make the couch creak. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t express his feelings in their entirety through his knitted brows because his hand gestures were also filled with annoyance. \u201cWas it Soohan? Or Director Ikyung\u2019s personal request?\u201d\u201cIkyung represents Soohan. I\u2019m the company\u2019s corporate lawyer and our firm deals with numerous matters with Soohan and its affiliated companies every year. It\u2019s not something to be easily ignored.\u201d\u201cDid they say they would terminate our retainer if we didn\u2019t accept her brother?\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t say that, but it\u2019s something we need to be prepared for if we refuse the request. She personally asked that her brother be placed under your wing and that you teach him how to survive hell.\u201dSehun scoffed out loud. \u201cYou think this is school? It\u2019s the first time I heard that I have qualifications to be a teacher instead of a lawyer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the superficial reason, but I think she wanted to protect her brother since he works without taking care of himself. In that aspect, Sehun Kang is a fine shield.\u201d\u201cSo, she wanted a babysitter, not an instructor. I don\u2019t have a hobby of raising children either.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Just run the numbers in your head.\u201d\u2018Hah\u2026\u2019\u00a0Sehun sighed in defeat as his eyes clouded over with complicated thoughts.Mihee promptly read his thoughts and added, \u201cThink about it this way\u2014a corporation hawk like you, taking care of a family member of someone of the Soohan clan. You lose nothing from this deal. You know full well that this practice is practically a battle of information and networking. Following that, a golden goose just landed in your arms. Of course, the company is bound to give us big cases since we have the brother. It\u2019s not bad, don\u2019t you think?\u201dSehun listened patiently up to that point, then he narrowed his eyes. \u201cSo in the end, this is a special favor from Soohan. And a threatening one at that.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s call it a compensatory favor. In exchange for giving him a salary, what we gain is very big.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s character aside, this wasn\u2019t a bad deal for Sehun when he only looked at the positive points. With no exception, family was a weakness for all of humanity. Pursuant to that, Sehun would be holding onto Soohan\u2019s weakness. Despite the fruit not being ripe for the picking now, he would be sowing the seeds for the future. Since Sehun was one of Professor Do\u2019s pupils, he had an even better reason to take this job.However, there was something that still didn\u2019t sit right with him. Rather, he got a nagging feeling about it.Why him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - Condition PrecedentAs Yoonshin\u2019s sister, there was no way she didn\u2019t know how straight-laced and proper her brother was. In that aspect, Sehun was not a good tutor nor a good nanny for Yoonshin. \u201cHow to survive\u2026 Was that the only condition?\u201d\u201cOne more thing\u2014on the condition that he works under you, she wants you to give him mostly pro bono1\u00a0work for the next few months until he gets used to practicing at a big firm. She said that he would be unaccustomed to files that we take here.\u201d\u201cShe truly knows her brother well. That makes me even more suspicious as to why she would send him to me.\u201d\u201cShe must know about your talent. Every partner needs to complete a certain number of volunteer hours. You didn\u2019t fill a single hour yet, so this will be good for you. With a focus on free legal consultation and pro bono files, you can leave your hours for the new kid. Attorney Do\u2019s win rate is decent, your name could be placed on the record, and Do could do the legwork and consultation for the trial.\u201d\u201cI can donate money every year. Why do I need to be bothered with volunteering?\u201dMihee shrugged. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the firm\u2019s internal rules.\u00a0Qualis rex, talis grex.2\u00a0Don\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cChange the rules.\u201d\u201cEven if the rules do change, you still need to do it. You\u2019ll only be making it better for others. Your last restructuring case displaced a lot more employees than expected, so the press was bad. You need to give the impression to the public that Doguk is reflecting and repenting.\u201dSehun wanted to ask if they really needed to go this far just to employ Yoonshin Do. Of course, this was reasonable enough in Mihee\u2019s perspective. But truth be told, Sehun didn\u2019t feel many attachments to Doguk. He could produce as good of an outcome in any other firm. He could just quit if there was something he didn\u2019t want to do.But one thing stopped him. Sehun still was indebted to his senior Mihee, who sponsored him financially throughout his education.Sehun detested being entangled with others with the likes of loyalty, friendship, or indebtedness. Emotions were a form of weakness. If he listened to her request now, he felt like he could settle all his past debts and return their relationship to zero.\u201cMy job description doesn\u2019t include serving a young master. Propose a compromise to me and I\u2019ll have a listen,\u201d Sehun said.\u201cHow about increasing your dividend? You won\u2019t be disappointed,\u201d Mihee offered.\u201cYou\u2019re going to solve this with money, huh? You don\u2019t know how difficult it is to care for a child.\u201dMihee flew into a rage. \u201cYou are the top earner of this law firm. Most things are already in your favor. I had to hard-bargain with my father to convince him to increase your dividend. The partner title isn\u2019t free, you know. It\u2019s a very expensive title given for investing in the firm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to rip other people off. Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed for making a big deal about my money? Forget about the dividend. The firm needs to operate too and give associates their salaries.\u201d\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d\u201cFreedom to do what I want with all my matters within the firm without interference.\u201dMihee flinched, then clenched and unclenched her dry hands repeatedly. Her hands soon started to sweat. She didn\u2019t know how Sehun would use this abstract condition, but deep inside, she knew better than anyone else that he would use this power very effectively. \u201cIf I say okay to that, I\u2019m playing into your hands, right?\u201d\u201cNegotiation is for people who have something to lose. Trying to test me won\u2019t help you.\u201d\u201cYou scoundrel.\u201dAs if waiting for this response, he immediately replied, \u201cYour loss.\u201dHe started to get up from his seat when the other quickly waved her hands. \u201cOkay, I get it. But \u2018all\u2019 is subject to interpretation, so\u2026\u201d\u201cI can send you the details on paper.\u201dMihee looked resentfully at him before she snapped her fingers, having no other choice. She had already expected that Sehun wouldn\u2019t budge if not for some shocking condition, so she wasn\u2019t too surprised. As the party who lost the negotiation, she attempted to retain her inner peace and took a deep breath. Sehun observed her carefully, then said in a composed manner, \u201cI\u2019ll test him first, then if I think he can be useful, I\u2019ll teach him a few things one by one. After all, I\u2019m always in need of excellent human resources.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just stick him in a mountain of pro bono files. Let him work on some of your team\u2019s files. I\u2019ll send over the doc*ments soon.\u201dSehun refuted, telling her there was no need. \u201cNo, don\u2019t send them over yet. The wife of the Soohan conglomerate picked me, so if I refuse, there\u2019s no reason for Yoonshin Do to continue working here. I want to watch him for a couple of months first, then we can talk about it again. Let\u2019s write the contract at that time. Just give him his monthly salary until then.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re going to make him work.\u201d\u201cI choose my own clients. But Director Do randomly picked me out from the crowd, so I feel a bit uncomfortable with this situation. I\u2019m tolerating this because I\u2019m indebted to you. I can\u2019t compromise any more than this.\u201d\u201cSehun.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to quit? If that\u2019s the case, just tell me here and now. Tell me to move out of the apartment, return my investments, and collect my commissions. I can do this in a day.\u201d There was no turning back for Sehun\u2014if he said he would do it, he kept his word.If he was so vocal about his demands, Mihee had no choice but to step back. \u201cTake it easy on him. He\u2019s an underclassman from our alma mater and the son of Professor Do, who we both respect.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s pointless to respect others, so I don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a different story if it\u2019s about respecting me, though.\u201d\u201cHe was the only respectable adult that we knew. The fact that he passed away while defending the victims who suffered extremely poor working conditions perfects his legacy. We may be materially richer than him, but he did work that you nor I could do in our lifetimes. Let\u2019s shed some of the debt in our hearts this way, at least.\u201d\u201cI just liquidated the only debt I had. I have no more obligations to anyone. You can go settle your own debts as much as you want, Attorney Song.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - DiscoverySehun answered coldly. He left the room, seeing no reason to continue the conversation.Left alone in her office, Mihee shook her head in defeat.* * *Yoonshin was led to Sehun\u2019s office by a secretary and warily took a seat on Sehun\u2019s office couch. Yoonshin shot the secretary a grateful look and the other man smiled back before quietly slipping out of the office.Now alone, he could finally observe his surroundings.Sehun\u2019s office was more spacious and comfortable than other partners\u2019 offices that he had seen so far. However, Yoonshin strangely felt more at ease in his previous humble office.He couldn\u2019t fathom what his sister was thinking. \u201cWhy Sehun Kang of all people?\u201d he asked out loud.He recalled his favorite Hasidic saying:\u00a0\u201cBe the master of your will and the slave of your conscience.\u201dSehun was the type of person who abided by the first half of the proverb but completely ignored the latter half. Although this was the first time they met in a formal setting, Yoonshin had heard a tedious number of rumors about Sehun as a senior at law school. Tales of his deeds were practically urban legends.They said that Sehun was a snake in a suit or trash who did anything for victory.The most important addendum was that he always won.Sometimes, his methods were reasonable, while other times they were low. Basically, Sehun would use any method. Receiving intel about corruption was his hobby, and using it to his advantage was his specialty. The most widespread rumor that Yoonshin heard was that, whether it be witnesses, lawyers, prosecutors, or corporation employees, he would dig out their weaknesses and blithely blackmail the other party. Surprisingly, most of Sehun\u2019s juniors reproached him, yet they wished to become like him. Yoonshin was part of the minority who decided to hold off their judgment about Sehun.Yoonshin had no idea that he, a part of the minority, would be sitting here and waiting for Sehun.From what Attorney Song had told him, his sister strongly requested that Sehun take care of Yoonshin. Of course, there were things that Yoonshin could learn from the other man. But as two polar opposites, he doubted they would be able to tolerate each other for long. As luck would have it, he was warned by the other not to get in his way, so he couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy as to how this unfortunate encounter would advance.His mind in turmoil, he sat nervously as he looked around. A book lying on Sehun\u2019s desk caught his eyes.It was Charles d*ckens\u2019s\u00a0Great Expectations.\u2018Is it because of me?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin slowly started getting up to walk over to the desk, but the door burst open and the wild beast that he was waiting for came in. His eyes were cold today, as always. Yoonshin stood up and bowed deeply. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Junior Associate Yoonshin Do.\u201dThe other walked over, perched on his desk, and observed Yoonshin. He flicked his head, gesturing for Yoonshin to take a seat on the couch, and when he did so, the other wordlessly stared down at Yoonshin. Yoonshin tried to hide his mild panic and locked eyes with the other. Then, the other\u2019s pigmented lips slowly and languidly opened. \u201cWe keep seeing each other.\u201dSehun spoke in a more relaxed tone. Yoonshin intuitively felt the difference in power and how small he was in comparison. \u201cI apologize for not being able to fulfill your wish of not meeting professionally.\u201d\u201cAlready set on not losing a single word. The road ahead looks bleak.\u201d\u201cSorr\u2014\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll ask you a few questions first. This situation, is there a reasonable cause for it?\u201dSehun thought that the reason Yoonshin was placed in his team instead of one of Doguk\u2019s numerous departments was quite suspicious, questionable, and fishy\u2014this all showed in Sehun\u2019s well-shaped eyebrows.Yoonshin calmly chose his words. \u201cI don\u2019t think you would find it reasonable.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t? Why not?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t either of our intentions; rather, this was at the will of my sister, a third party. I was told that my sister strongly recommended that I work here with you. And unfortunately, I am an obedient younger sibling. This is the full extent of my knowledge,\u201d Yoonshin replied briskly.Sehun made a complicated face. \u201cYour sister was involved in it, yet you\u2019re showing me all your cards. Your statement has too many weak spots. Even if you weren\u2019t a good fit for Doguk, I thought you would be quite useful, but I changed my mind. You\u2019re disqualified.\u201d\u201cI can adjust my tempo and flow according to the need.\u201d\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have a joker in the deck?\u201d\u201cI will let you know if I find one.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s seemingly kind and gentle eyes looked directly at Sehun. Just like his upright attitude, his eyes were clear. Instead of simply telling Sehun to trust him, he sent Sehun a respectful look with eyes that reflected his candidness.Their gazes intersected, and as if planned in advance, both of them closed their lips.A silence fell over the room.At that very moment, Yoonshin felt the ever-present cold atmosphere about Sehun flicker. As if confirming this hunch, the other, who was steadfastly sitting on his desk, changed his posture. He crossed his arms and leaned askew on the desk, then he stared intently at Yoonshin, whose eyelids were studded with thick eyelashes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - DiscoveryIt felt like around three minutes passed in silence.Perhaps it was shorter, and Yoonshin only felt that way. As he was contemplating what to do next, Sehun spoke first, \u201cI wonder why Director Ikyung Do sent you to me.\u201dYoonshin was relieved that the unexpected and peculiar silence was broken and replied, \u201cHer excuse was that she wanted me to be financially independent.\u201dUntil now, he was always open to giving free legal advice and his retainer fees were set to the bare minimum to cater to his clients\u2019 circ*mstances, so his income was quite low. However, his mother, who had passed away right after giving birth to Yoonshin, left a significant amount of inheritance, so he didn\u2019t feel the need to be motivated by money. His sister also gave him a home and car when needed, so he had even less motivation. Sehun seemed to have guessed that much as well. \u201cI can see that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m guessing this is all due to my father. My father was also a lawyer like me, and in his later years, he spent his days helping people in difficult situations in more rural areas. Then, he passed away from overworking a few years ago.\u201dThe only point in common between the two was Yoonshin\u2019s father. A long time ago, on his father\u2019s last day of life, they had met at his funeral. Yoonshin hazily recalled that moment whenever he saw Sehun on the news from time to time. But that was really all there was to it. The moment was too brief to reminisce frequently.In the end, Yoonshin was unintentionally gauging whether Sehun also remembered their brief meeting.Feeling awkward, Yoonshin stopped talking and stared at the other. The other said, \u201cI also know that well. My condolences.\u201dYoonshin was nervous as to what that slick person would say, but he felt himself losing a bit of steam. In the brief time that he waited for Sehun\u2019s reply, he had wished Sehun would forget the embarrassing side of him that he showed that day. But when he really didn\u2019t seem to remember, Yoonshin felt a bit disappointed for some reason.Indeed, this was a past long gone. Sehun met countless clients every year, and there were more important files and people for Sehun to remember. Of course, Sehun would let an event like that just pass.Yoonshin hid his disappointment and answered coolly, his lips redder. \u201cShe\u2019s probably afraid that I\u2019ll end up like our father. So, she wants me to learn how to look at reality squarely in the face. She must have felt that the way I chased my ideals was precarious. Perhaps you were the most realistic person that she knew.\u201d\u201cDo you really think that you\u2019re an idealist?\u201d\u201cTo a certain extent, but it\u2019s not like I have zero sense of reality.\u201d Yoonshin was better at knowing his position and knowing the other party than Sehun had thought. He was uncomfortable yet amused by the situation.Shortly after, Sehun erased his emotions and said in a composed tone, as usual, \u201cThere are three things that I have never done for the past few years: pro bono work, ordinary client criminal cases, and all of our firm\u2019s volunteer work. You\u2019ll be doing those for the time being.\u201dPerhaps this was an offer that he hadn\u2019t expected as Yoonshin\u2019s eyes sparkled. Sehun didn\u2019t miss that. Yoonshin looked bright, willing to do the work that Sehun himself was unwilling to do. As expected, their professional compatibility was not very good.\u201cI can do them well. I\u2019m quite skilled at understanding victims.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need an associate with an unprofitable talent like that. I also don\u2019t have a hobby of working while serving a younger master-in-law of a rich family. Don\u2019t you have a better case record than that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really good at finding precedents. I\u2019m decent at reading quickly, and I have pretty good interpersonal relationships.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t list them all\u2026 I\u2019m confident that I will fulfill everything you give me well. I must do well so my sister can feel at ease, so I\u2019ll give it my all. I\u2019ll be happy to do anything you give me.\u201d\u201cSo, give you a test-run first? You\u2019re confident.\u201d\u201cI understand that you are very adept at calculating your gains and losses. I believe this won\u2019t be a loss for you.\u201d\u2018Calculating gains and losses?\u2019\u00a0Sehun was at a loss for what to say and laughed flatly. However, Yoonshin didn\u2019t say anything wrong, so Sehun didn\u2019t criticize or rebuke him. However, he waved his hand for Yoonshin to leave.As Yoonshin calmly stood up as instructed and politely greeted him, Sehun walked over to the other. Soon, Sehun stood right in front of Yoonshin and grabbed his chin. They both couldn\u2019t help but note the other\u2019s smooth skin.Sehun\u2019s carefully arranged, harmonious visage observed Yoonshin quite doggedly. He lingered for a particularly long time on Yoonshin\u2019s moist and gentle eyes.Yoonshin couldn\u2019t understand Sehun\u2019s random action, so he swallowed nervously. He grabbed Sehun\u2019s arm unconsciously. Sehun glanced down at Yoonshin\u2019s hands that touched his wrist and shook the other off. Then, he took off his hand on Yoonshin\u2019s chin.He glared frostily at Yoonshin. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2026 touched me first. I only exercised my right to defend myself.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like when others touch me according to their intentions. Only I\u2019m allowed to do that. Not you.\u201dYoonshin was about to ask what kind of logic that was, but he conceded and apologized. They had only met a few brief times, but his gut feeling told him that he shouldn\u2019t try to understand Sehun with logic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI get the gist of the situation, so scram. I\u2019m going to think about it a bit.\u201d\u201cMy office is across from yours. I look forward to working with you.\u201d Politeness must have been ingrained in his bones because Yoonshin bowed deeply once more before exiting the room.The door closed with a click. Through the glass pane of his office door, Sehun watched Yoonshin walk across the reception office on his way to his office. Yoonshin politely greeted the support staff that he came across, perfectly fitting the image of Yoonshin that Sehun had pictured.Sehun wasn\u2019t sure what exactly Yoonshin\u2019s sister, Director Ikyung Do of Soohan Group, wanted. However, the most important issue was that Sehun wasn\u2019t the one who designed this situation. Sehun had many enemies. He always needed time to review whether there were any traps laid for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Background Check\u2018Soohan Group\u2026 but I have no files with them this year,\u2019\u00a0Sehun thought.As soon as Yoonshin entered his room after he finished greeting the staff, Sehun picked up his office phone. He called his secretary, Mr. Tak, who immediately picked up. Through the window, their eyes met.\u00a0\u201cYes, sir, Secretary Tak speaking.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s Yoonshin Do\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degree in? Looks like he went to Korea University for law school.\u201d\u201cHe went to Dongguk University. His major was in social work.\u201d\u201cSocial work\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t have chosen a better major.Sehun clicked his tongue at the ban*l answer. Then, he asked, \u201cWhen did he get his license? Call up all his peers, including the ones up to two years above and below his year, to the conference room. And call up the recruit team photographer if he\u2019s in the building.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Should I call them now?\u201d\u201cCall them immediately. And bring me every little piece of information about that associate\u2019s life, from his basic profile to his family, friends, schoolmates\u2014all of them. All the cases he took so far, his personal interests, shoe size\u2014bring me whatever you can dig up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Is there anything you want me to keep in mind?\u201dSehun lightly slammed his desk and after a moment of thinking, he said, \u201cLook closely for any of his or the late Professor Do\u2019s cases that have even the slightest connection to me.\u201dAcross the room, Secretary Tak looked confused, unable to comprehend Sehun\u2019s reasons for this instruction. \u201cThe two attorneys mostly did public interest cases. I don\u2019t think there were any chances for your paths to have crossed. Moreover, if there was anything like that, you would have known.\u201d\u201cStill, look into it. There could be something that I missed. Dig into Director Ikyung Do of Soohan as well. Check if I had any connections with any events, big or small. If you find that I\u2019ve been inconveniently involved with them, tell Yoonshin that he doesn\u2019t need to come to work the next day.\u201d\u201cI understand for now.\u201dAfter the call ended, Sehun continued to look outside his window. Sehun\u2019s room was south-facing and received a lot of sunlight. Yoonshin\u2019s office across the hall didn\u2019t seem to get much natural light\u2014he had his lights on, but it still felt too dim even to Sehun. Perhaps the window location was ambiguous, but where Sehun was standing, he could easily see Yoonshin sitting at his desk. The other could probably see him too.While lost in thought, Sehun continued to observe Yoonshin for a time. He recalled the frosty words that Yoonshin left.\u00a0\u201cPerhaps you were the most realistic person that she knew.\u201dThis seemed like a compliment on the surface, but in fact, it was not.It was an insultingly clear condemnation. It meant that his father, whom he loved and respected greatly, was at odds with Sehun. Yoonshin acknowledged Sehun yet scorned him at the same time. He was fully willing to learn from Sehun but refused to ever respect him.\u201cI understand that you are very adept at calculating your gains and losses.\u201dYoonshin said that he could adjust his tempo, but it seemed like he didn\u2019t feel the need to hide his inner thoughts in front of Sehun.\u201cJust where did this fool roll in from?\u201d Sehun mumbled to himself.Sehun saw Yoonshin taking off his jacket and rolling up his sleeves, preparing to organize his office. Yoonshin\u2019s boney wrist snatched Sehun\u2019s attention for a moment, but soon after, Sehun\u2019s eyes climbed up the steep incline of the other\u2019s side silhouette.His eyes didn\u2019t stop when he reached the other\u2019s neck and continued upward to the other\u2019s lips, pale cheeks, nose. The moment his eyes landed on the other\u2019s, he bit his lip in annoyance. Yoonshin must have felt his gaze as he turned his head Sehun\u2019s way and their eyes met.Yoonshin tilted his head, perplexed, but still politely nodded at Sehun. The moment Sehun saw that, he picked up and pressed a button on his remote. The blinds noisily shut, and both their spaces and lines of vision were separated. Sehun, now completely alone, suddenly felt angry and threw the remote in his hands.Crack! The remote control the size of his palm bounced off the wall and landed near his feet.The object was already broken in two like a capsized ship.\u201cDamn it.\u201d He was used to scathing criticism. One could even say that criticism spurred him to climb up to his present-day position. Scornful remarks were nothing to him because he could ignore most of them and sometimes use them to his advantage when the situation called for it.However, for some strange reason, he couldn\u2019t just pass over Yoonshin\u2019s remarks.\u2018Why do that b*stard\u2019s words piss me off?\u2019He stared down at the remote that fell apart and then stomped on it irritably.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Background CheckAct 02Slam! Sehun, in his luxurious suit, got out of his sedan when he arrived at the company\u2019s parking lot. He skillfully balanced his phone between his ear and shoulder. As he meticulously buttoned his cufflinks, he walked in big strides toward the building.Secretary Tak, who had been waiting for him at the elevator since before his superior\u2019s arrival, handed Sehun a briefcase. He then gestured for Sehun to take the lift that he had caught in advance. Nimbly getting on the elevator, Sehun briefly listened to the person on the other line before he sharply replied, \u201cIf you were in such a rush, you should have sent it to the litigation group. I rarely ever handle lawsuits.\u201d\u201cTo my knowledge, you sometimes do litigation for people you\u2019ve advised. Can\u2019t you do something about it for me?\u201d the other person on the line pleaded.\u201cThat\u2019s why you should have shopped for your lawyer wisely from the get-go. Tell me, do you start eating anything just because you\u2019re at a buffet? The standard is to start with the most expensive and delicious dishes.\u201dThe client on the line was the representative director at a semiconductor company who became involved in a civil suit while in the process of investing and building his portfolio. He lost significantly during the first trial after he was represented by another law firm, almost the size of Doguk. Since Sehun refused to pick up this client\u2019s call, he must have felt anxious because he kept sending people to pester Sehun for the past few days. Presently, Sehun was graciously listening to his case.However, Sehun didn\u2019t seem interested at all even after picking up, so the man started to sound more desperate. \u201cYou know that I wanted to retain you from the very get-go, no? I contacted you too. But the other party\u2019s director and his wife knew you guys well, so as another businessman, I thought I should retain some good faith. I thought I should go down the right path at least now. Why don\u2019t we meet? Please?\u201dSehun frowned and waved his hand at Secretary Tak. The prepared secretary showed Sehun his schedule and pointed to a good day for a meeting. Sehun replied upon seeing that, \u201cLet\u2019s meet over the weekend. Please visit the firm this Saturday at 12 p.m. I\u2019ll schedule a meeting at that time. You\u2019ll need to send me all your doc*ments in advance, and that includes the doc*ments already shared and those that are privileged\u2014that means all your evidence and other doc*ments about circ*mstances that you kept hidden from the court. I need to know everything about how you acc*mulated your assets. If there are any omissions, I refuse to represent you.\u201d\u201cAll right, all right. I believe in you, Attorney Kang. Should I send someone over with the doc*ments?\u201d\u201cOf course. Oh, and if you call me three times and I don\u2019t reply, don\u2019t call again. It means I\u2019m intentionally ignoring you, not that I\u2019m unable to take them. I\u2019m doing this for you because you came to me first. I\u2019ll be hanging up now,\u201d Sehun said coldly, then quickly hung up and tossed his phone to his secretary.Secretary Tak caught it skillfully and said, \u201cHe is quite well advanced in age, so a Hanwoo lunch would be appropriate.\u201d\u201cDo as you see fit. The doc*ments in question will probably be delivered in person tonight, so please organize those into easily readable sections and leave them on my desk by tomorrow at noon. Plus, bring me the record of the recent judgment on the case by noon. Grab an associate with some free time to print out precedents.\u201d\u201cAn associate with free time? Does our firm even have that? Excluding one person, I mean.\u201dSehun knew very well what the question between the lines was and retorted, \u201cNot Yoonshin Do. Find one among the juniors of another team. If there are none, just use an intern.\u201d\u201cDo you trust Attorney Do less than a law student? Oh, right. While we\u2019re on that topic, here. This doc*ment has additional information on the cases that Attorney Do has worked on.\u201dSehun snatched the doc*ment in Secretary Tak\u2019s hands and was about to reply when the elevator made a ding as it arrived on the floor of his office.Sehun briskly walked ahead toward his office as he read through the thick stack of papers. Slightly at his side, Secretary Tak followed close behind. The employees who saw the two bowed respectfully toward Sehun, who ignored all of them. He instead threw a question at his secretary. \u201cIs there anything else that you dug up?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the same as the last report. I looked through everything, but there was nothing where the two of you were related, privately or publicly. I simply summarized the facts that were there.\u201dSehun investigated Yoonshin through his secretary and personally interviewed the junior lawyers who went to school around the same time as Yoonshin, but he came out with nothing. Even if they were the same lawyers, a big-firm lawyer and a human rights lawyer were in such distinct fields that nobody knew of any specifics. Based on the rumors that the juniors occasionally heard, their impression of Yoonshin was that he was on the smart and staunch side.Sehun nodded then flipped back to the first page and concentrated on absorbing the information. All the details of Yoonshin\u2019s files were printed.\u201cHe\u2019s all clean. Will you retract your doubts about him now?\u201d Secretary Tak asked.\u201cShut up,\u201d Sehun dismissed.\u201cThis is a waste of human resources. You hate wasting manpower and time the most.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d advise you to shut up before I tell you twice.\u201dWith the final warning, Secretary Tak closed his lips tightly. Sehun\u2019s surroundings grew quiet. He skimmed through the rest of the doc*ment.\u2018Wrongful dismissal, infringement of employment law, workplace accidents\u2026\u2019\u00a0he read in his head.Although Yoonshin was still a small fry, his life and career path overlapped those of Sehun\u2019s teacher, who was both Yoonshin\u2019s father and the Minister of Justice. The father and son couldn\u2019t seem to stand watching people in unjust situations.\u2018He\u2019s just like his father.\u2019\u00a0Sehun clicked his tongue and tried to keep advancing, but an obstacle appeared out of the blue in front of him. He stopped and looked up to see Mihee obstructing his way while waving a coffee in each hand.\u201cOur dear Senior Attorney Kang, you\u2019re always exactly on time to work. The other partners need to learn from you,\u201d Mihee said.\u201cWhat are you doing first thing in the morning?\u201d\u201cI missed you so much that I waited for you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t accept a married woman\u2019s feelings. There\u2019s this thing called ethics in business. Move.\u201d\u201cHow cold, Sehun.\u201dIf she didn\u2019t move, Sehun was going to go around her. He walked past Mihee toward his office. Secretary Tak, who tactfully retrieved the doc*ments from Sehun\u2019s hands, rushed ahead. The secretary opened Sehun\u2019s firmly closed office door and carefully placed his briefcase, cell phone, and doc*ments on top of his desk.Finally, the owner of the room entered the office and was about to sit in his seat, completely ready to start working, but once again Mihee barged in and impeded his way about his day. Sehun furrowed his brows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Competence Test\u201cSenior Attorney Song, if you have something to say, just say it instead of hovering around. Don\u2019t you know Monday mornings are my busiest?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost been a month since Attorney Yoonshin Do\u2019s first day and you haven\u2019t called him to your office once, right? He\u2019s still under your direct supervision, so if you\u2019re not going to give him work, at least buy him lunch. A young man is rare on your team.\u201dSehun knew Mihee would bring this up and he slowly furrowed his brow. \u201cI go as far as dividing up my lunch hour to have one more meeting.\u201d\u201cHey, you do what you have to do even if you\u2019re busy. For your information, I go shopping and have pastimes.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough to hand him some pro bono files? Why do I have to feed him too? I told you that I\u2019m not into babysitting.\u201d\u201cThen buy him some coffee, you know? I know you pretty well. I know you\u2019re pretty much done investigating him. Seeing as you\u2019re not dying to kick him out, he has passed your cut-off line. I don\u2019t know what exactly you\u2019re watching for, but I hope you could chat at least. It\u2019s fine even if it\u2019s short. I need some results to report to Director Do too. Every time she calls and asks, I have nothing to say and that\u2019s embarrassing. I\u2019m not asking for much. Just a coffee. Okay? Coffee.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t order me around. Get out.\u201d\u201cSehun.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about higher-ups or whatever. I don\u2019t discriminate; I\u2019ll even yell at those more senior than me. Get out when I\u2019m not yelling.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re such a hothead. I\u2019m leaving, okay?\u201dMihee looked at Sehun as she would a defiant younger brother and stepped back. She pretended to step back quietly before she briskly walked forward and placed both cups of coffee on the other\u2019s desk. \u201cLooking forward to hearing good news!\u201dSehun had presumed Mihee would do this because he stood still for a moment. He stared at Mihee, who was waving at him, before letting out a deep sigh. At long last, he was going to sit at his desk, but then he saw Yoonshin\u2019s brightly lit room, its owner seemingly already at work. Sehun paused.Soon after, he stared at the neatly placed cups of coffee on his desk. What Mihee said bothered him.\u201cIt\u2019s almost been a month since Attorney Yoonshin Do\u2019s first day and you haven\u2019t called him to your office once, right?\u201d\u201cOne month. One month\u2026\u201d he repeated these words to himself before picking up one of the two disposable cups.He turned around, exited his office, and moved to the reception room between his and Yoonshin\u2019s office. The support staff didn\u2019t seem to realize Sehun was approaching as they were busy whispering among themselves. They must have been excitedly chatting about Mihee\u2019s early visit to Sehun\u2019s office. Disapprovingly, Sehun clapped loudly once and Secretary Tak, who discovered Sehun\u2019s presence first, bolted up from his seat. \u201cOh my Lord. S-senior Attorney, did you need anything else?\u201d\u201cSecretary Tak. Send the doc*ments that I told you to organize last week to Yoonshin Do\u2019s office.\u201d\u201cBoth cases? Right now?\u201d\u201cThen do you want to leave the second one to tomorrow? I can stand here and wait while you happily chat away.\u201d\u201cMy mistake. I\u2019ll send them right away,\u201d Secretary Tak replied.Without another word, Sehun went straight to Yoonshin\u2019s room and pushed the door open. Yoonshin was just turning on his laptop after setting up his workspace, but upon realizing the identity of his uninvited guest, he made a right-angled bow. This was the first time Sehun dropped by his office, so the other was quite surprised. \u201cSir, did you just arrive at work?\u201d\u201cAre you in the military? Relax. Sit,\u201d Sehun replied tersely, then stood in front of Yoonshin\u2019s desk. Staring at the other\u2019s blank face, Sehun put down the cup of coffee that Mihee passed on to him with some force. Naturally, Yoonshin\u2019s clear eyes were filled with some questions as he looked back up.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Yoonshin trailed off.\u201cCoffee,\u201d Sehun replied.\u201cI can see that. Did you perhaps have something to tell me\u2026?\u201d\u201cDrink that first.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re giving this to me?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019ll be less distressed if you drink that.\u201dYoonshin, at a loss for what to do because of Sehun\u2019s piercing gaze, hurriedly took a sip. Then, he tilted his head in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand your intentions.\u201d\u201cSee, someone keeps badgering me. Anyway, I\u2019ve done what I needed to.\u201d Sehun\u2019s explanation was vague, so Yoonshin still couldn\u2019t understand what Sehun wanted. Instead of pressing on, he slowly glanced at the black coffee sleeve and pulled the cup closer to him. He silently thanked Sehun with a nod, and Sehun nodded back in acknowledgment before walking over to the couch in Yoonshin\u2019s office and leaning against the armrest while gazing intently at the younger lawyer.Yoonshin made a complex face as he was barraged with Sehun\u2019s gaze. He was bewildered because Sehun suddenly barged in for a reason unknown to Yoonshin. To make matters worse, the partner lawyer\u2019s stare was so persistent and intense that Yoonshin felt a bit awkward and shy.Truthfully, staring so openly and directly at another person was not very polite. They had only met a couple of times, and yet each time, the older man was rude. However, Sehun Kang was the instigator, so Yoonshin had no choice but to tolerate it.While thinking that, he suddenly was hit with a realization.\u201cOh, I was a bit short-sighted. I\u2019ll quickly buy you coffee too.\u201d Yoonshin got up partially.However, Sehun waved his hand in rejection. \u201cLeave it. You haven\u2019t written your contract yet. How much were you promised annually?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only been practicing for four years, and I don\u2019t have a judicial background. I\u2019ve primarily done small cases, so I practically had no additional factors to consider when I joined this firm. I was told that the firm had a performance-based compensation system starting from third-year associates, so I was offered the average second-year salary. Ms. Song offered to re-negotiate at the end of the year after assessing my performance\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that despite being hired through nepotism, you tried to keep your boundaries.\u201dAs he fiddled with the coffee cup, Yoonshin neither confirmed nor denied the statement. During that brief silence, someone knocked on his slightly ajar door and pushed the door wide open. Following that, two unfamiliar faces came into the room. They each pushed in a file cart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Competence TestThe two neatly stacked the immense piles of papers from the carts onto the coffee table before signaling their departure to the composed Sehun and bewildered Yoonshin.After the door closed with a click, Yoonshin, who was shocked at the sheer number of doc*ments, glared daggers at Sehun. \u201cSenior Attorney, I wonder what those are? You seem to know, judging by your reaction.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re two litigation files around the size our third and fourth-year junior lawyers handle. One is civil, the other is criminal.\u201dOne of the key responsibilities of a partner lawyer was to collect cases. Sometimes, they took the lead on matters in their specialty or matters that potentially brought in the big bucks, but smaller files were often handed down to associates to handle independently. From decision making to retention as representatives, many law firms had a top-down approach. In turn, a partner lawyer\u2019s words were like the law to associates. Doguk seemed to be no different.Yoonshin could easily tell that these doc*ments before his eyes were related to cases that Sehun obtained.\u201cThese doc*ments must be for the files. Will you assign one of these files to me? Or both?\u201dSehun laughed hollowly in disbelief. \u201cYou want to do litigation? Do you think you\u2019re on the litigation team? You seem better suited for that; do you want me to send you there?\u201dYoonshin felt cornered, so he decided to seal his lips. Sehun then added, \u201cGranted that you aren\u2019t an idiot, you must have seen the firm\u2019s atmosphere in the past month. This is my first test to judge whether you can earn your keep.\u201d\u201cA test? Okay. What do I need to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you two days. Read all these without skipping a single word. Then, brief our team\u2019s seniors who have no knowledge about this case. They have to understand the entirety of the case based on your brief, and when they ask questions, your answers can\u2019t have any gaps or errors. Can you do that?\u201dYoonshin supposed that this was all for determining how efficiently he could work in a short period of time. However, there still wasn\u2019t enough time to process that extensive volume of doc*ments in two days. \u201cAll of this in two days? I also have doc*ments for the pro bono files to look over. Since they were transferred to me urgently, a few of them are in the middle of trial.\u201dSehun was more used to unconditional acceptance and his eyebrows twitched. He got up and walked back to Yoonshin. He extended both arms, placed them shoulder-width apart on the desk, and leaned down, meeting eyes at an angle with Yoonshin.Their faces were quite close. Sehun\u2019s narrow eyes, placed symmetrically on his smooth face, blinked slowly. He looked somewhat sinister. Yoonshin winced and gripped the cup in his hands a bit tighter.\u201cHey, fourth-year associate. See, I\u2019m pretty good at metacognition,\u201d Sehun said.\u201cI can somewhat tell,\u201d Yoonshin replied.\u201cAnd the most important key to persuading the judge is to maintain the same position from start to finish.\u201d\u201cI know that well too.\u201d\u201cYou know both, so why are you acting like this? You said you\u2019d give it your all. If you contradict yourself, as a person with excellent memory, recall what I said: I will feel extremely distressed. Don\u2019t you think, Fourth-year?\u201d\u201cI must do well so my sister can feel at ease, so I\u2019ll give it my all,\u201d\u00a0Yoonshin remembered the words that he had said, so he couldn\u2019t make an excuse or have a chance to protest.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can do it.\u201dSehun didn\u2019t seem to be quite pleased, but in any case, this was an answer that he could accept. He slowly straightened his back and stared down at an intimidating angle. There were no noticeable emotions on his face. However, Yoonshin could glimpse underlying confidence that bordered on arrogance. The partner\u2019s life, decorated with victories seized no matter the method, made him the person he was today.Thanks to that, Yoonshin, physically in a lower position and looking up, fleetingly thought that Sehun Kang was probably the best suited in the world to be looking down on others. He felt like the other wouldn\u2019t know what loneliness or humiliation felt like even if he were to die and come back to life.At that moment, for some reason, he wanted to see Sehun\u2019s face showing pain from defeat at least once. Yoonshin had never imagined another person\u2019s pained expression before. He thought this was weird of him, so he tried to shake off his thoughts.Sehun was quick to catch that Yoonshin couldn\u2019t concentrate on their conversation, lost deep in his own world, so he snapped his fingers in Yoonshin\u2019s face. \u201cTwo days from today, this time in the morning. At the main conference room. Any additional questions?\u201d\u201cUh, so do I need to give a case brief to just you? And receive questions from the senior lawyers?\u201d\u201cI tossed this case to the other teams, so I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019m not going. The response rate needs to approach 100% and you can\u2019t take longer than two seconds to answer a question. Ultimately, the senior lawyers will give you a score and judge your value. If it\u2019s decent, I\u2019ll readjust your salary to that of an average fourth-year associate.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Undertaking\u201cWhat if I say I\u2019m not okay with that?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cYou can\u2019t do it?\u201d\u201cNo, but can\u2019t you just come?\u201dSehun didn\u2019t seem to understand the request disguised as an innocent question at all. The biggest reason that Sehun wasn\u2019t going to partake in the test and only receive the results was that he didn\u2019t want to waste his precious time on something he found no value in. However, there was some intention to give some breathing space to this experienced new recruit.\u201cI work on a schedule with 10-minute intervals,\u201d Sehun replied.\u201cI know. I only need a little bit of your time. I won\u2019t take up too much of it.\u201d\u201cAre you fearless or just brash?\u201d\u201cI just want to understand your style of doing things. Even though you\u2019re always in the building, you\u2019re so busy that it\u2019s hard to even meet you once.\u201dSehun narrowed his eyes then. He looked as if he was trying to peek into a solid fortress gate and retorted frostily, \u201cAre you crazy? How dare you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to overstep my bounds and judge you. I wanted to know what appeals to you so I can work on that area. I know you find me unsatisfactory, but as long as I choose to remain here, I need to work under you, and I really want to do well.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. I\u2019m very selective. I won\u2019t give you points so easily.\u201d\u201cRegret is something everyone feels.\u201d Yoonshin implied that he was mentally prepared enough. The man himself wanted to be pushed into a corner, so Sehun, as someone with an inherently mean personality, had no reason to deny the younger lawyer some spare time for some entertainment.However, Yoonshin\u2019s attitude kept grating him. The other party was clearly being submissive, groveling on the ground before him. But for some reason, Sehun strangely still felt uprightness and stubbornness from Yoonshin. Sehun could anticipate that Yoonshin, as he was, could potentially upset him.Sehun ground his teeth and moved his arm impulsively. His long and straight fingers curled around Yoonshin\u2019s necktie like claws. Then, he yanked the silky material and the other\u2019s skinny upper body was helplessly pulled toward Sehun.\u201cNgh\u2026 Sir?\u201d Yoonshin asked in surprise.They were close enough as it was already, but apparently, that wasn\u2019t close enough for Sehun. He looked down at Yoonshin menacingly, then leaned in, bringing their faces extremely close.The frigid gaze that motionlessly observed Yoonshin\u2019s face was sharp and defensive.Tension crawled up from his waist, making Yoonshin astonished. He grew pale. \u201cWhy are you suddenly\u2026? Did I do something wrong?\u201dDespite the careful question, Sehun didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he hooked his finger into the narrow knot of the other\u2019s tie and pulled it down.The knot that sat on Yoonshin\u2019s neck was undone completely. The younger\u2019s neat appearance looked a bit ruffled. Now satisfied, Sehun tossed the accessory on the floor.Yoonshin finally heard Sehun\u2019s reply. \u201cWhy do I dislike you so much?\u201dFor some reason, it seemed like Sehun himself didn\u2019t know the reason even though he was the one who asked, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t press on.Yoonshin merely swallowed nervously. He straightened his shirt and answered in a composed manner, \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll try for you to like some part of me.\u201dYoonshin felt his stomach churning as Sehun watched Yoonshin\u2019s calm reaction.Sehun could easily tell what was going on in the other\u2019s mind. After he read about Yoonshin\u2019s life trajectory, it was even easier. Yoonshin was always a good person to others for his entire life, so he probably had very few chances to have animosity directed at him.Most people already felt positive about him, so even if he was uncomfortable around Sehun, who everyone considered to be a bad person, Yoonshin\u2019s feelings probably would not be hurt significantly.In other words, Sehun\u2019s animosity toward him wasn\u2019t really of interest to Yoonshin.\u201cI dislike that even more,\u201d Sehun mumbled to himself.\u201cBy any chance, do you hate everything I do?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in you enough for that.\u201dDisliking another person was emotionally taxing. So, Sehun didn\u2019t hate his parents who left him behind, the adults in his childhood who passed him around from place to place, or the business relationships who treated him as a rival and swore that they would give him tit for tat. To be more accurate, he didn\u2019t care about them.However, everything about Yoonshin strangely rubbed him the wrong way. More accurately speaking, rather than disliking him, Sehun was extremely conscious of Yoonshin.A very old memory inevitably invaded his cluttered mind like light.The memory was of a funeral home\u2014shabbier than the honor he received in life\u2014a variety of groups of visitors, and the strong, upright image of Director Ikyung Do thanking visitors.In a secluded place all alone, a lone figure in funeral attire was crying.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but could you stay with me for a moment? I don\u2019t think I can stay here alone.\u201dThat day, the two of them said nothing to each other and shared a transient moment together.Did Yoonshin also remember that day?\u201cWhat should I fix? If you let me know\u2026\u201d At that moment, he heard Yoonshin\u2019s voice. His musings about the past were washed away and filled once more with present-day thoughts and issues.Sehun, who almost relaxed, looked stiff again. \u201cThen would you like to quit at least now?\u201d\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d\u201cThen, just do your assignments well.\u201d Sehun turned around, unwilling to stay in the room any longer. He looked like he would kick the door open and walk out, so Yoonshin stood up reflectively. At the same time, Sehun turned around, seemingly having something more to say. His sharp gaze pierced through Yoonshin, making the younger man\u2019s skinny shoulders flinch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Undertaking\u201cI\u2019ll also attend the test then.\u201d Sehun\u2019s tone was cold but ultimately, he obliged Yoonshin\u2019s request.Yoonshin, who was tense, hesitated for a moment before conveying his sincerity. \u201cThank\u2026\u201dBut the other turned around before he could finish his expression of thanks.Click. The door closed.\u201c\u2026you.\u201dThe back that was eye-catching no matter how many times he saw it soon disappeared from sight. Disappointed as he was, Yoonshin continued to follow the image of the other walking away with his eyes. The older man stopped at the reception desk and began giving instructions to Secretary Tak, and in case he turned around, Yoonshin crouched.As he was crouching, he picked up his necktie from the floor. He redid his tie, but a sudden feeling of being wronged washed over him. \u201c\u2018I dislike that even more\u2026\u2019 What exactly does he dislike? Did I make a mistake somewhere? No, I didn\u2019t. He could decide to dislike me after giving me a chance to speak with him.\u201dAfter neglecting him for nearly a month, the words that the partner spat out after he suddenly appeared made Yoonshin\u2019s brain a disorganized mess.The way he got into this firm wasn\u2019t the most honest, and everyone was bound to have someone who they were irritated at, so Yoonshin just thought it was the other being uncomfortable for those reasons. Even though the older man had never done anything wrong to him, Yoonshin also didn\u2019t like Sehun very much, so he thought he could relate.However, after watching the older lawyer in proximity for nearly a month, Yoonshin realized that there was a lot to learn from the other. The widespread rumors about Sehun were probably exaggerated because according to them, Sehun committed misdeeds daily and drowned himself in hedonism\u2014shockingly, Sehun was actually holed up in his office all day, doing work.The partner was buried in an unmanageable volume of doc*ments all day, and amid that, he produced opinion letters and reports. On top of that, he devoted a fixed amount of time to meet with the principal lawyers of a file and with foreign accredited lawyers, and he squeezed out even more time to meet with clients.Moreover, he always came to work exactly on time and worked overtime almost every day. If there were associates on the file, he at least rested completely for two days during the weekend.\u2018Maybe he goes on dates over the weekend. Or maybe he\u2019s in a long-distance relationship? He looks like he would have a Korean-American girlfriend,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin casually thought to himself, then paused as he finished tying his tie. As he was about to sit back at his desk, he imitated Sehun, stuck his finger in between the knot, and tried to pull it down. Although he tried to undo the knot as skillfully as the other, it wasn\u2019t as easy as it seemed.Meanwhile, all Yoonshin could think about was how Sehun\u2019s skin might have brushed by the same spot.\u2018So what if we touched?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin quickly took his hands off his tie and fixed his posture, but he felt a bit embarrassed that he was feeling conscious of another man\u2019s touch.\u2018He\u2019ll probably get married to a decent woman eventually, right?\u2019\u00a0He couldn\u2019t imagine the other settling down and making a family. Sehun looked like he would treat love as the most useless thing in the world. That made Yoonshin even more curious. Maybe if he was still here around then, he could be invited to the wedding.As his train of thought continued, he wondered why he was so curious about such meaningless things. Yoonshin rested his eyes on the doc*ments that covered his coffee table. He felt his head spin just looking at the stack of white papers.\u201cLet\u2019s focus on this first,\u201d he said to himself out loud.He hurriedly dragged his acrylic board and timer to the table. He decided to hold off on his work for the pro bono file and moved his seat. He divided the mountain of paperwork into the civil and criminal cases and started reading from the pile on his left.His supervisor said he would judge him, so Yoonshin was thinking of getting the highest possible mark.* * *Yoonshin\u2019s neck was stiff after burying his face in his doc*ments all day. He lifted his head and massaged his neck. He could feel how tight his muscles were. To make matters worse, his eyelids slowly started to close.\u201cI feel like dying.\u201d He glanced outside the window of his office door to check if there was anyone that he could ask to bring coffee, but he sighed after seeing the darkened room. When he checked, the time was already one in the morning.Time at a law firm wasn\u2019t separated between morning and afternoon or day and night. It was divided by the time a lawyer was at work and wasn\u2019t at work.It was the dead of night, but there were still places in the building that were lit up. There were merely a few more unlit spaces than before. The seventh floor, where Yoonshin was, housed the firm\u2019s source of funds\u2014it was used by the financial and corporate law teams. The offices were inevitably filled by more senior lawyers, so unless they were at the peak of a case, this floor was darker than others.On his second day of work, Yoonshin realized that the position of his office was very wrong. Directly opposite of Sehun, his placement seemed to overtake the other senior lawyers in the team.Senior Attorney Mihee Song instructed this room assignment, so Yoonshin presumed that she decided to take this risk and make a gamble to place Yoonshin close to Sehun. Seeing as Sehun didn\u2019t say much about this arrangement, Yoonshin guessed that perhaps this was also part of his sister\u2019s request. Thus, he willingly played along for now.\u201cUgh, I really can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Yoonshin stood up to head for the break room.Creak. The blinding light escaped the confines of his office through the slightly open door and evanesced into the darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Bragging\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the Crown Prince tried to say something, but I quickly bowed, trying to mend the situation in a hurry.\u201cI apologize, your highness. I hadn\u2019t seen that you were\u2026\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t speak further as the Crown Prince began watching me closely. That look made me feel desperate and made my throat dry up. I swallowed my saliva and continued, \u201cI apologize for bumping into you unknowingly, your highness. Please forgive me.\u201dHearing my apology, he then wore a smug expression, then coldly asked me, \u201cYour name?\u201dI almost frowned at his rudeness, but he was still the crown prince. Besides, I was the one who made a mistake, so I calmly answered his question, \u201cIt\u2019s Marina von Harrant, your highness.\u201dThe moment he heard my name, it felt like a light shined upon his purple eyes. They felt almost chilly and appeared to glimmer. But he was standing under the sun, so that was understandable. He then wore a distorted smile on his beautiful face as he responded, \u201cI accept your apology, Marina von Harrant. Are you here for the exam?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me now\u2026\u201dI tried to escape the scene to put an end to this ordeal when I heard him mumbling over my back,\u201c\u2026will pass.\u201dThat could\u2019ve been a disaster. Who would\u2019ve thought I would bump into the Crown Prince? My bad luck there. At least he forgave me easily. The whole incident made me even more exhausted after the exam. Well, at least I wouldn\u2019t bump into him unless I work at internal affairs, so I had nothing to worry about.***When I got out of the gate, my mother greeted me. She suggested that we stay at the uncle\u2019s place until we see the results. But I didn\u2019t want to stay as a guest in that mansion when I wasn\u2019t so sure of myself.It took three days for us to return home. Harris immediately scurried over, asking the results of my exam while my maids massaged my body, trying to let me relax. But what I needed was the rest that I didn\u2019t get for the past two months.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can you leave me alone?\u201dDisappointed, Harris then got off of me, and the maids also left. After I was left alone, I dove into a deep sleep. I think I unknowingly slept for days.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dMy body felt heavy, and I couldn\u2019t open my eyes. Oh, I felt so tired. What day is it today? I did wake up a few times in between, but I couldn\u2019t remember when. I ate when I woke up, then slept again, and repeated this. Because of that, my sense of time became dull.As I barely opened my eyes, I saw a familiar face.\u201cMy lady! Are you awake?! Do you recognize me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Daisy.\u201dI could barely answer, to which Daisy brightened and began to scream, \u201cMy lord! My lady! She\u2019s awake!\u201dDaisy\u2019s shouting made my head ring and hurt. My throat felt extremely dry, and I felt a heavy thirst. With a hoarse voice, I said, \u201cWater\u2026 Give me some water.\u201dShe then quickly poured water into a glass and handed it over to me. Because the water had suddenly entered my dried throat, I coughed. Daisy, who saw me coughing, gave me a worried look and asked, \u201cAre you alright, my lady?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied.Daisy then seemed relieved and began chattering, \u201cWhew! I was so scared watching you the past few days! My gosh, how can a human not speak and only do what is absolutely necessary to survive?\u201d\u2018I wasn\u2019t doing it consciously, so I\u2019m not sure either.\u2019\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re awake right on time! Today\u2019s the day the results are coming out!\u201dSurprised, I asked, \u201cWhat? The results?\u201d\u201cYes! Lord Harrant is reading the results as we speak!\u201dI felt my senses return as I was shocked by what she said. As I began to guess the outcome of the exam, the door burst opened, and my father asked, \u201cMarina, oh dear baby. Are you alright?\u201d\u201cMy beautiful daughter who\u2019s just like me! Are you okay?\u201d questioned Mother.It was my parents. The way they quickly came over and caressed me made me guess the results. I was so happy that I began to laugh until I choked, \u201cUgh, ugh. So\u2026 did I get in?\u201d\u201cGet in? You did more than that! You got first place!\u00a0First place! Oh, and the Chancellor thinks highly of you. He announced that he\u2019s going to appoint you as the Director-General for Policy Planning, the Chancellor\u2019s cabinet!\u201d said MotherIt felt like I was dreaming, but my aching body was telling me otherwise. Then my mother continued, \u201cYou are to report to the palace in three days, so we should get going now. Come on, get ready! At least your skin looks refreshed from your sleep.\u201dI was then readied by my mother and quickly packed a formal dress and a few other things. Then my parents, my knight Rey, my servant Daisy, and I headed for the city of Constantia again. After three days of passing through various estates and continuous travel, we finally arrived at the capital.\u201cWe can finally enter the capital again! We\u2019ll be back to our glory once you get promoted to the Secretary-General of the Chancellor!\u201d declared Mother.That was very true. But where will I reside once I get there? As if expecting my questions, my mother began to explain one thing after another, \u201cYou\u2019ll live at my brother\u2019s place until you buy your own house. I\u2019m sure you were good with my brother\u2019s kids, remember?\u201dI almost replied,\u00a0\u2018Oh, you mean servants number one, two, and three?\u2019\u00a0out loud, but I managed not to. As expected, I was going to stay at my uncle\u2019s place. I smiled and answered, \u201cThey always respect what I have to say. They\u2019re good kids.\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s good to hear. You should be proud just like the central government officials from now on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - FrictionAs Yoonshin continued to lock eyes with that sharp gaze, one possibility suddenly occurred to Yoonshin.\u00a0\u2018Does he perhaps remember what happened in the past?\u2019Come to think of it, Yoonshin only assumed Sehun had forgotten, but Sehun had never directly said that he didn\u2019t remember.When they first met each other a few years ago, Yoonshin was crying his eyes out. Sehun leaned against the wall and stood beside Yoonshin for quite a long time. They didn\u2019t even know each other\u2019s names. The older man probably assumed that Yoonshin was his father\u2019s son based on his funeral attire, but Yoonshin learned that the other\u2019s name was \u201cSehun Kang\u201d when he was digging through old newspaper articles quite a while after that day. Yoonshin was so shocked when he found out.Bewildered, Yoonshin swallowed nervously. Then, he said whatever came to mind to reverse this strange atmosphere.\u201cS-sir. When I was still in law school, I read a case while preparing for a mock trial on a crime related to business management. It was about the professional negligence of the executive director of a savings bank. You know, it caused quite the commotion around five years ago\u2026 Everyone expected that the executive director would definitely be sentenced to jail, but you ultimately lowered the sentence to probation.\u201dYoonshin rushed to change the topic and soon after, the other seemingly lost interest in the droplets of water in Yoonshin\u2019s eyes and took a few steps back to lean against the desk partitions. Sehun nodded slightly. Relieved, Yoonshin continued, \u201cI always wondered. How did you convince his business partner, who fled the country, to come back to appear at court? I dug through and found that the prosecutors thought that the business partner would never come as a witness. If she testified, her own fatal accounting error would be brought to light, and she would be charged instead of the director.\u201dSehun was listening quietly thus far, but his expression changed subtly.The memories of that case stretched out like a panorama.Extraordinary eloquence or amazing persuasive skills were required to push people. What was truly useful was to hold the other party\u2019s weakness. The more one needed to protect, the stronger one was\u2014on the flip side, having more generally made one weaker. For example, family, wealth, and reputation\u2014things of that nature only served as avenues to be exploited.From a young age, Sehun never had a family. He thought it would be convenient if he had wealth and reputation, but he wasn\u2019t desperate for it. He had nothing to lose, so that was why he could come this far. Perhaps he didn\u2019t love anything in order to climb to the top. But what difference did that make? People only remembered the result.\u201cWith a method that people like you would never use,\u201d Sehun replied.It was also a method that Yoonshin would have to learn if he were to continue working under Sehun. However, Sehun didn\u2019t feel the need to say that much.\u201cDid you offer him money? That does seem to be the easiest way,\u201d Yoonshin asked.Sehun did not answer, leaving the rest to the other\u2019s imagination. Yoonshin felt his suspicions were confirmed as he observed Sehun\u2019s unremorseful face. Yoonshin said, a bit bitterly, \u201cSo you did. As I thought, you do a lot of bad things here.\u201d\u201cWe work for money here. Whatever the case may be, the point here is that I dragged the business partner to the court.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still something you shouldn\u2019t do as a lawyer. Because of that, the partner got charged with the crimes of the executive director as well and got sentenced to jail. What about that person\u2019s life? I think that you should have used a more equitable method if you were going to make her stand at court, at least.\u201d\u201cShe probably got the sentence that she deserved, equivalent to her crimes. And regardless, I saved my client.\u201d\u201cNo, if I remember correctly, the partner received nearly two times the sentence she should have, out of spite. You knew that this would end up this way. You simulated this in your head and figured she was a good substitute. The business partner also committed some wrongdoings, so she was a good shield.\u201d\u201cIs that really so regrettable? You should have stepped in like a hero and defended her.\u201d\u201cI was in law school then\u2026\u201dSehun, who was rallying with Yoonshin quite sharply, cut the associate off suddenly. Yoonshin was used to this now. \u201cStop. I knew you would be like this. That\u2019s why I was so against hiring you. I don\u2019t like kids like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving. Fourth-year, keep giving it your all.\u201d\u201cAttorney Kang?\u201dJust as suddenly as he came, he turned and left without notice. High-handed as always, Sehun\u2019s tempestuous arrogance suited him well, especially since he didn\u2019t look like he would have any obstructions in his life. Sehun left Yoonshin\u2019s room without hesitation. Then, he went to his own office, lit his room, swiftly found what he was looking for, and then completely left Yoonshin\u2019s line of sight.The momentary light on the other side of the hall hid its presence yet again, and as Sehun disappeared from his vision, Yoonshin could finally sit back in his chair in comfort.The coffee that he brought over was already cold, and the muddy stream left his floor a splotchy mess.A sigh escaped Yoonshin\u2019s red lips. For no reason, he brushed his lower lip that the other touched before feeling a bit weird and taking his hands off. He changed the topic because he was starting to feel embarrassed in the increasingly strange atmosphere, but he was clumsy in situations like this and had no self-restraint. Thanks to that, he felt like he ruined Sehun\u2019s mood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Calm Before the Storm\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can turn back time. Sh*t,\u201d Yoonshin muttered to himself. As he thought back to his conversation with Sehun, he felt a surge of curiosity.If someone were born an enigma, it would be Sehun. Yoonshin had never seen a person who had everything like Sehun. He was tall and slim yet well-built, which made him look stylish in anything. Additionally, he had fine features that appealed to everyone. The cherry on top was that Sehun had exceptional metacognition, quick thinking, a daring personality, and excellent conversational skills\u2014there was nothing he lacked. Really, he was perfect on the surface.Sehun had so much going for him, yet Yoonshin couldn\u2019t figure out why the other was so uncompassionate.Yoonshin came to Doguk feeling resolute, but things just didn\u2019t seem to work out for him even before he could start anything. To begin with, Sehun and Yoonshin had disparate values, and the older man seemed to recognize this fact as well.\u201cI knew you would be like this. That\u2019s why I was so against hiring you.\u201dYoonshin squatted down to pick up his cracked mug and mumbled to himself, sounding defeated, \u201cI won\u2019t get fired in a month, right?\u201dThe face of his sister, who strongly requested that he go to Doguk, floated in his vision, and Yoonshin hung his head.Act 03The main conference room could seat tens of people. In the middle of that room, there was an oval-shaped wooden table that could seat over 20 people. With the projector on one of the long edges of the table, executive office chairs filled with special material lined the opposite side, and in front of each seat on top of the tables was a mic and tablet.Behind the executive team\u2019s seats were two rows of regular leather office chairs for the associates and support staff. Sophisticated-looking amplifiers and other electronic devices flanked the seats, which added to the dignified appearance of the room. Apparently, important meetings requiring the attendance of the firm\u2019s partners took place in this room. The costly items that filled this space were as classy as their users.If that was all there was to this room, Yoonshin, who grew up comfortably and without lacking anything, wouldn\u2019t have felt so intimidated.His complicated feelings were aimed at the abstract artwork hanging on the back wall of the room, behind the central seat of the table.\u2018Where have I seen that piece before? I\u2019m sure I read an article that it was sold at an auction a few years ago,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought.Works by artists so famous that one only heard the news about them from overseas auctions well exceeded several billion dollars at the least. The fact that such an expensive piece was not in the director\u2019s office, partner\u2019s office, nor any of the reception rooms, but in a mere conference room used only by employees escaped Yoonshin. The formless figures in the piece swirled around and scorned him.It occurred to him that he was possibly at an important fork in the road, so he felt tenser than when he stood before the court. To stay focused, he pursed his lips and his fingers glided over the trackpad. Then, he opened the simple presentation slides that he had prepared in advance, projecting them onto the screen at the front of the room. The slides presented the evidence related to the cases and organized the issues in a readable format.Work hadn\u2019t officially started for the day yet. Yoonshin came to the conference room in advance to prepare for his test. His face was fraught with fatigue. This excessively extravagant place was psychologically stressful, but the biggest reason was that he was unable to sleep a wink for the past two days and nights.When he got up slightly, he felt his vision spin. Not only was he unable to sleep, but for all the time as humanly possible, Yoonshin read words and organized the content like crazy, so his fatigue accumulated. He barely managed to straighten his back when the door opened from outside. Secretary Tak entered the room.Secretary Tak brought the printouts that Yoonshin requested and set one copy at each seat. Then, he handed a piping hot cup of coffee in front of Yoonshin. \u201cPlease drink this. I made it extra strong, so you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re wide awake.\u201dYoonshin rubbed his face with his hands and gave the other man an extremely grateful face before taking the cup. \u201cI won\u2019t forget your kindness. Please pass along my thanks to the office manager for coming out early to help me as well.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I only did what I should.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not officially a lawyer at this firm yet. Strictly speaking, you have no reason to help me\u2014not yet at least.\u201dSecretary Tak smiled gently and replied, \u201cBut I was wondering, did you read all those documents? There were well over ten thousand sheets of A4 paper. I know because I was the one who prepared all the papers.\u201d\u201cHonestly, the volume of documents was too extensive, so I couldn\u2019t read through it completely. I separated them by categories and selectively read the important parts. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a bit worried.\u201d Yoonshin took a sip after responding, and as he did so, Secretary Tak carefully examined Yoonshin\u2019s outfit. The young lawyer\u2019s white shirt sleeves were rolled up and his necktie hung awkwardly, making his outfit an overall mess. It could have been okay if that was all, but the true issue was elsewhere.\u201cYou probably didn\u2019t sleep that much. It seems like you barely managed to wash in the shower room, right?\u201d Secretary Tak probed.\u201cYes. Is there a problem with that? I saw that some people on the upper and lower floors stayed here overnight.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not an issue, but I recommend you bring some spare clothes from now on. He can\u2019t stand to see people wearing the same thing twice.\u201d\u201cYou mean Senior Attorney Kang?\u201d Yoonshin was taken aback because the secretary simply shrugged, implying that there was nobody else he could have been talking about. Knowing Sehun based on what Yoonshin observed, he didn\u2019t seem like he would be interested in what the associates wore. \u201cHe cares about what an associate lawyer wears?\u201d\u201cNot particularly, but because his memory is quite good\u2026 If he sees someone two days in a row and that person is wearing the same clothes, I think because he processes an extreme amount of work, he feels like he\u2019s doing the same work as the other day. Like he\u2019s repeating a day, I guess? I remember that he pointed this out to another junior in the past.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Calm Before the Storm\u201cA simple comment?\u201d\u201cHe said, \u2018Get out of my sight.\u2019 Then, the junior got out of his sight, right into the corporate/commercial team.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s face grew so dark that Secretary Tak added quickly, \u201cWell, thankfully he didn\u2019t get fired.\u201d\u201cThank you for the warning.\u201dThis jinx of sorts felt very plausible for a busy and temperamental person like Sehun. Yoonshin undid his necktie and shoved it haphazardly in his pocket before straightening out his shirt as neatly as possible. Thankfully, Secretary Tak handed Yoonshin his own necktie. As Yoonshin tied the knot, the image of Sehun\u2019s frosty face as he undid his necktie suddenly popped up, so he tightened the tie extremely snugly.Secretary Tak tilted his head slightly and watched him with amused eyes. \u201cDid you perhaps imagine strangling Attorney Kang\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Yoonshin denied.\u201cWeird. All the other juniors do that. I sometimes do it too. He gives me too much work.\u201dYoonshin felt too embarrassed to admit it now, so he changed the topic. \u201cBut what\u2019s the relationship between you two? You seemed to be pretty comfortable around Attorney Kang.\u201d\u201cOh, me? I was the middle school underclassman of both Attorney Song and Kang. They\u2019re my seniors.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m hearing this.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s quite an age gap, so the three of us never went to school at the same time. Before, Senior Attorney Song gave some financial aid to a few underclassmen who were children in need of protection. Thankfully, Attorney Kang and I were able to receive her assistance, and after that, we learned of each other\u2019s existence through the organization. We weren\u2019t that close.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s eyes grew wide upon hearing that\u2014a child in need of protection.Basically, it meant an orphan under the age of 18.Yoonshin had heard several rumors about Sehun\u2019s background. The majority said that Sehun\u2019s parents were both doctors at \u201cDoctors Without Borders,\u201d or that they were professors at a prominent university overseas. When Sehun decided to become a lawyer instead of a prosecutor, stories started to circulate that Sehun was the illegitimate child of a famous law firm\u2019s director. As far as Yoonshin knew, Sehun had never confirmed any of these stories.\u201cAttorney Kang\u2019s parents\u2026 aren\u2019t with him, it seems?\u201d Yoonshin made an extremely complicated face.Secretary Tak looked a bit troubled and asked, \u201cAh, you didn\u2019t know? I thought that since you\u2019re the brother-in-law to a conglomerate family and Attorney Song personally brought you here and stuck you next to Attorney Kang, you would know this for sure. Did I misspeak?\u201d\u201cIs this something that Attorney Kang hides?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. But he doesn\u2019t enjoy talking about it.\u201d\u201cThen, this could be a slip of the tongue. I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d Yoonshin assured the other.The secretary smiled in appreciation. Even so, Yoonshin could tell that the other man seemed concerned that he exposed his superior\u2019s personal information without permission, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t continue with this topic. He shifted the subject as naturally as possible. \u201cSo, this test. Does everyone go through it?\u201dSecretary Tak rejoiced and replied, \u201cThis is the most basic of them all. I could even call it a rite of passage. When an associate first comes into the firm, their respective teams open a mock trial and humiliate them. They do it to intimidate the newcomers. But Attorney Kang finds that annoying, so he doesn\u2019t go as far as a mock trial. Even when he does, he leaves it to the other senior lawyers under him. Right, he\u2019s attending today for once. I wonder why?\u201d\u201cMaybe he\u2019s dying to kill some time,\u201d a third voice piped in.In unison, the two who were conversing turned back to look at the source of the voice. Yoonshin had an inkling of a presence coming from far away, but the aforementioned Sehun was standing crookedly at the doorway. As usual, his meticulous three-piece suit befitted him. Even his long shadow stretching out from his toes looked excellent.Behind Sehun was a long line of senior lawyers in Sehun\u2019s team that Yoonshin occasionally ran into. Counting their numbers briefly, it looked like around 10 of the team\u2019s lawyers were going to attend. Their ages ranged from the 30s to 50s and they had a spectrum of years of experience and specialties.Yoonshin snapped to his senses when he saw the lawyers who came to evaluate him. The gravity that stemmed from their sharp attires and solemn faces made all the muscles in Yoonshin\u2019s body freeze.Yoonshin regretted too late that he threw a fit at Sehun to come when the older man held the reins of these experienced lawyers.\u201cSecretary Tak, uh, could you stay in the conference room during my brief\u2026?\u201d Yoonshin, who naturally felt threatened, reached out to Secretary Tak. However, the secretary cold-heartedly shot a look telling Yoonshin to keep his promise before he quickly slipped out of the conference room. Yoonshin had no choice but to look back at Sehun, who looked immensely displeased for some reason. Yoonshin felt his throat closing up.Yoonshin coughed dryly, about to address Sehun, but the older lawyer was quicker to talk. \u201cFourth-year, is clinging onto anyone to stay by your side a hobby of yours?\u201d\u201cSorry? No, that couldn\u2019t be.\u201d\u201c\u2018That couldn\u2019t be\u2019 was what I just witnessed.\u201d\u201cAh, just now it was because I felt like I had no allies here\u2014I don\u2019t have any other special reason. Of course, that\u2019s not to say that you\u2019re an enemy, sir.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Inquisition\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Sehun asked.\u201cIt\u2019s really not what you thought.\u201d\u201cWhatever, stop blocking the way and move.\u201d Sehun roughly pushed past Yoonshin before the younger man even had the chance to step aside. Sehun took the centermost seat. Then, as if they all waited for the other to move, the other lawyers courteously entered the room and filled the remaining seats.While the senior lawyers read through the printouts, Yoonshin caught his breath and tried to calm his fluttering heart by reminding himself,\u00a0\u2018You prepared to the best of your abilities. Just don\u2019t make a mistake.\u2019Yoonshin took a few deep breaths, then greeted the seniors politely. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m introducing myself formally. I\u2019m Yoonshin Do.\u201dThere was no reply. Most of the seniors were reading through the printout that Yoonshin prepared. In that short time, a few of them seemed to already regard him highly for organizing the main points very well. Sitting crookedly right in front of the abstract painting, Sehun\u2019s piercing gaze was fixed on Yoonshin.Yoonshin was about to continue his preliminary greetings, but Sehun checked his watch and interrupted. \u201cCut the small talk and start. We\u2019re all busy people.\u201dYoonshin chewed his lips, then he nodded.After that, he pointed his laser pointer at the screen. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll begin. This case is a lawsuit demanding payment for construction. The plaintiff was unable to receive their construction cost and sent a complaint letter to the defendant. The contract with the defendant building owner was not left in writing, so instead the plaintiffs submitted an audio recording of the verbal contract. The construction was performed, and payment was due, but they were not able to receive their payment. All the conditions are met for litigation.\u201dOne of the seniors who was flipping through the papers turned on the mic and asked, \u201cThe document is well organized. When was the payment due? It\u2019s standard practice for the construction balance to be paid in full when the building is delivered to the owner. In this case, the defendant stated that the extension to the building was not completed. Hence, payment was not due; there was no reason to pay the plaintiffs. How will you solve this?\u201d\u201cConstruction was postponed for over six months and is ongoing. During that time, there is clear evidence that shows that the defendant building owner interfered with the construction, preventing the plaintiffs from finishing construction.\u201d Yoonshin changed the slide and presented the evidence. There were photos demonstrating that the defendant erected a fence around the building in question and damaged construction materials. The defendant\u2019s position was that they did this to keep out wildlife.Yoonshin pointed at the photos and expounded, \u201cThere is a leading case which states that if there is a change in the situation, such as the suspension of construction, the time stipulated in the contract changes, starting from the change in the situation. The payment then becomes due. If you look at the printout\u2026\u201dYoonshin\u2019s scrawny hands lifted the printout to check the page numbers. However, he was stopped when Sehun\u2019s pen, which he was spinning in his fingers, rolled toward Yoonshin. Sehun looked extremely displeased about something. \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 You\u2019re saying we need to pay?\u201d\u201cAccording to what I confirmed about the case, a secured debt exists, and payment is due. In principle, the defendant needs to pay.\u201dUpon hearing that answer, Sehun looked askance. He turned his head with a nuanced face, where he pointed at a senior on the opposite end of the table. \u201cOkay, so question. Are we the plaintiff or the defendant? It\u2019s a very easy question.\u201dThe lawyer who had hurriedly skimmed through replied confidently, \u201cPlaintiff.\u201dSehun looked back at Yoonshin, giving him a knowing look. He addressed Yoonshin this time, \u201cHe said plaintiff. Why? Because you, the presenter, did not say that this was a case about non-payment for performance. You said it was a case where the payment was due but not received.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat organization do you belong to?\u201d\u201cDoguk.\u201d\u201cAnd our firm is?\u201dYoonshin hesitated and then spoke. \u201c\u2026We represent the defendant.\u201d\u201cAre you a prosecutor by any chance? A righteous hero\u2014it fits Attorney Yoonshin Do like a glove. Or you could be a judge. Oh, if you\u2019re neither, you\u2019re just an audience member who follows the rules veeery well. Rules are nice.\u201d The longer Sehun continued to talk, the chillier the atmosphere of the room became. It was like Sehun was spraying cold water into the air. Sehun was clearly deriding Yoonshin, and naturally, the other lawyers paid closer attention to Sehun and Yoonshin.Yoonshin had a good reason to retort and rebutted immediately, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t ask me to formulate an argument. You told me to summarize and organize the key points of the case. I maintained an objective and neutral lens to prevent being swept away by either side of the argument. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that I presented can be dissected for our defense. This process is much needed.\u201d\u201cIt is indeed much needed. But do you really think \u2018we\u2019 are the defendant? I\u2019m asking about your mindset. No matter how you see it, someone getting ripped out of millions of dollars, rightfully earned, will feel wronged. I got that feeling from reading your notes last night. Did I misunderstand that? I didn\u2019t read it, but this printout seems to be the same.\u201dYoonshin was at a loss for what to say and pressed his lips together. Sehun was correct without a margin of error. In all the cases Yoonshin worked on so far, he represented people like the plaintiff in this case. Naturally, in the process of organizing the documents, he looked through the lens of the plaintiff, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to admit that.As the other lawyer fell silent, Sehun, who was facing the front, turned his chair slightly to the side and leaned his head to the side. He glanced at the seniors near him and then pointed at the first two lawyers in sight with his chin. \u201cHey, you two. I\u2019ll ask you a question. You seemed to have understood the case in general by reading the document. In this case, what strategy can the defendant use? It\u2019s not a difficult case, so let\u2019s just go for the most reasonable route.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - InquisitionThe selected senior lawyers answered one by one. \u201cWe can terminate the contract. They performed the construction, but we can prove that there was a significant defect in the building. There are bound to be a few flaws stemming from the process of construction. If you can prove there is a defect that can result in additional repair costs, then it\u2019s possible to trigger the plaintiff\u2019s warranty to repair defects. In this case, I\u2019m aware that there is a leading case which states that you don\u2019t need to fully pay for the construction.\u201d\u201cYou are correct. I was in charge of a similar case before, but after going through the building with a fine-tooth comb, we found that a portion of the first floor was very slightly slanted. We obtained evidence of the defective area, and through the media, we promoted the danger of such defects in buildings. After the stock value of the construction company dropped temporarily, we ultimately won the case.\u201dAfter hearing that answer, Sehun turned back to Yoonshin. \u201cAttorney Yoonshin Do.\u201d\u201cYes, Senior Attorney.\u201d\u201cHow are you planning on winning this case? Excluding what the seniors said, give me your answer.\u201d\u201cHow about a setoff by paying in arrears? In any case, the construction was delayed, and damages were accrued. Both sides have liabilities.\u201d\u201cBut you just said there are aggravating factors against the defendant showing that they prevented further construction. How could you ignore that?\u201dYoonshin\u2019s mind faded to white, and as Sehun continued to corner him by interrogation, Yoonshin\u2019s improvisation skills ended up being depleted. The young lawyer tried to come up with an answer, but he drew a blank. He squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again before answering diffidently, \u201cIf you give me some time, I can think of a way starting now.\u201d\u201cI already gave you two days. This is a very simple lawsuit. Juniors with some experience can do this with their eyes closed.\u201d\u201cYou gave me two days to read through the cases carefully and present a case brief.\u201dThe partner\u2019s narrowed eyes looked disappointed as if he knew that Yoonshin would answer that way. \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me that you simply did your homework. You memorized the documents, made a slideshow, organized the facts, and created a printout. Do you think you\u2019re at law school, preparing for your licensing examination? For the past two days, you never thought about how we can win.\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t answer.\u201cFourth-year, Doguk doesn\u2019t need an objective lawyer. We want lawyers who win. Time? Of course you ran out. But do you want to say that to the client too? Sir, you only gave me two days. I\u2019m sorry for losing. I believe you must compensate the plaintiff for damages.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s pale face drained completely of blood after hearing the scathing criticism. Everything Sehun said was right. Yoonshin had the unidimensional thought that he would be tested simply on his memorization and summarization skills. He believed that the mean Sehun Kang wanted to stress him out by giving him an immense pile of documents.But if he thought about it just a bit more carefully and logically, the other lawyer was always busy with no spare time and wouldn\u2019t have bothered to do that to him. If one couldn\u2019t do simple work, one couldn\u2019t step foot in this law firm. Yoonshin should have read between the lines to discern the secondary intention behind his assignment.\u201cIt\u2019s been one month since you came into the firm, yet you\u2019re still an outsider. How much longer should I wait? Do you need another month?\u201d\u201cMy apologies. I didn\u2019t think that far.\u201d\u201cYou can keep doing pro bono files. Imitate prosecutors, fight for justice, and help poor people\u2014you can keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing outside this firm. You\u2019ll feel at ease and continue to follow the life that you lived so far as a benevolent, rich young master. If you want that, you can always let me know. I\u2019m not interested in working while humoring associates who can\u2019t settle in.\u201d After his last utterance, Sehun threw the papers that were placed in front of him into the air. The sheets floated down behind Sehun\u2019s head and blocked out parts of the painting on the back wall, then softly landed one by one onto the bare floor.Yoonshin was upset at Sehun, who threw his suffering of two days like trash. Even so, he maintained his composure and said, \u201cSo are you saying you won\u2019t listen to me further?\u201d\u201cYou were the one who said that you only need a little of my time. You keep forgetting what you said. That\u2019s not a good habit.\u201d\u201cI still have the criminal case left. It\u2019s a charge of professional negligence resulting in death.\u201dSehun had started to get up to leave but stopped. He quietly gazed at Yoonshin, who tried to keep calm and had changed the slide on the screen to the brief about the criminal case.Their eyes met. Yoonshin\u2019s eyelids fluttered in anger, but that was all. He was upset, but Sehun pointed out errors that Yoonshin understood. Sehun faulted Yoonshin for being quick to talk, but he internally rejected the working style of a big law firm. Yoonshin placidly attempted to persuade the partner in a level-headed manner. \u201cYou said you would attend my test. Those were your words. And it\u2019s still my time. I still have things left to say.\u201d\u201cThe same thing will happen.\u201d\u201cI was scolded because I was stupid. However, I still want to finish showing you what I completed.\u201dThe senior lawyers stayed silent and studied Sehun\u2019s reaction. Sehun\u2019s eyebrows twitched, and then, for some reason, he sat back down. He rested one leg over the other and crossed his arms before gesturing with his chin arrogantly. \u201cTry me. I\u2019m looking forward to which role you took this time.\u201dYoonshin bit down on his lip hard, then gripped his laser pointer tighter. Afterward, he resumed his presentation. Sehun observed Yoonshin very carefully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Difference in EthicsThe precarious atmosphere grew heavier, sinking deeper and deeper into the floor.* * *Drip, drip. The droplets of water trickled down his silky chin, falling into the drain. Yoonshin stared back at his reflection; the rims of his eyes were bloodshot and red.\u201cNobody at the firm calls you by your name anyways. They all call you the nepotism hire.\u201dSurprisingly, what Sehun told Yoonshin at that time was a hint of sorts. A partner with Sehun\u2019s level of influence was apt to need assistance from a junior lawyer on small tasks, but he had never said a single word about work demands for an entire month. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t being neglected because he couldn\u2019t do work. It was most likely because Sehun wasn\u2019t certain if Yoonshin was a man of Doguk yet.\u201cNo wonder he kept calling me Fourth-year this, Fourth-year that.\u201d Yoonshin assumed that the older man wanted to damage Yoonshin\u2019s pride by using a weird nickname instead of his real name on purpose. However, that was not the case\u2014Sehun truly saw Yoonshin as a lawyer who drifted outside the firm for four years. That was quite humiliating.Yoonshin did his best for the past two days so as not to make an embarrassment out of himself. He really tried. But ultimately, he suffered indescribable humiliation which made him feel like shit. He was partially at fault, but even so, the other\u2019s initiation ceremony was too merciless. The afterimage of Sehun inexorably casting aside two days worth of Yoonshin\u2019s fruits of labor just moments ago lingered in Yoonshin\u2019s eyes.\u201cSadist,\u201d Yoonshin mumbled as he pulled out several sheets of paper towels and dried his hands. For some reason, he suddenly remembered when Sehun wiped away the dampness in his eyelashes and transferred it to his lips. He scrubbed his blameless face ruthlessly.\u201cIf he saw through my thoughts, then he could have gone easy and taught me from the beginning. Is his hobby to humiliate people? Or is he a scumbag to begin with? There should be a limit to how trash someone\u2019s personality is.\u201d\u201cProbably both?\u201d another voice interjected.While Yoonshin was distracted by rubbing his face roughly, someone approached him before he knew it.At first, Yoonshin thought that the dulcet yet familiar voice was pleasant to the ear, but in a span of a few seconds, his thoughts flipped 180 degrees. He shouldn\u2019t hear this voice right here and now. His stiffened neck barely managed to turn to face the source of the voice. Yoonshin saw the sculpted figure of Sehun with his jacket sleeves rolled up and approaching the sink.\u2018I\u2019m screwed.\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin turned blue, and his face was full of chaotic emotions.How much did he hear?Sadist?Scumbag?\u201cUnfortunately, I was here starting from \u2018sadist,\u2019\u201d Sehun, who was washing off his hands stained with fountain pen ink, replied to the unvoiced question.Yoonshin paled in horror and stared at the other\u2019s face in utter devastation. \u201cSenior Attorney, do you perhaps read minds?\u201d\u201cIf I did, my life would have been so much easier. Wipe off your face gently. Your good looks are a weapon that you can use to your advantage. I might have a use for it in the future, so don\u2019t waste it.\u201dYoonshin clenched the wet towel tightly, imagining it was the other, then finished wiping himself up. Soon after, he wordlessly gawked at the other with a complicated face. Sehun must have felt uncomfortable with the gaze because, even though he was ignoring Yoonshin so far, he finally glanced at Yoonshin through the mirror.The two men exchanged looks with the glass as a medium. The mirror was clear and transparent; it almost felt like it could reflect not only the physical world but also the inner workings of the mind.At that moment, Sehun frowned, his face contorted even though he was always so composed despite hearing explicit insults. He didn\u2019t try to hide his displeasure and asked, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m confused.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re helping me even though you\u2019re the root of my problems. You humiliated me just moments ago, and now you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll use me later.\u201d\u201cYou call that help? I see you\u2019re easy. I don\u2019t get along with easy kids.\u201d\u201cYou know, saying that to a person to their face is sadistic.\u201d\u201cAt least I\u2019m an honest sadist, unlike you, bad-mouthing people behind their backs.\u201dOh. Yoonshin recalled what had just happened and apologized immediately, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I just\u2026 felt angry. They say anyone can speak ill of their country when nobody is listening, so please forgive me.\u201d\u201cThis b*stard\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s shameless or just brainless,\u201d Sehun said to himself and shook his head, unwilling to further associate with the younger man as he dried off his cleanly washed hands on a paper towel. He turned to leave, ignoring Yoonshin.However, Yoonshin stepped in front of Sehun, blocking his way and making him stop. \u201cIf you had instructed me with exactly what you wanted, the result would have been different. You\u2019re right that I approached this simplistically, but it\u2019s also true that you just wanted to nitpick. That was mean of you.\u201dSurprisingly, Sehun readily admitted to Yoonshin\u2019s accusation. \u201cThe courts are like that. If you submit evidence, all you do is nitpick, nitpick, and nitpick each other. Winning and losing are decided by who demonstrates their point and refutes the opposing party the most convincingly. That\u2019s why I told you it wouldn\u2019t be helpful even if I attended. You should have heeded my warning.\u201d\u201cAll right. I don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, so I\u2019ll keep it in mind that it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem exactly like the type to continue misbehaving. I don\u2019t have zero expectations of you. I told you the other day. Just do what you\u2019ve been assigned to properly. Don\u2019t be a nuisance to me,\u201d Sehun stated.Sehun just told him to simply do what he was told, but at other times, he scolded Yoonshin for only doing exactly as told. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t figure out how to interpret Sehun\u2019s instructions. \u201cDo you want me to just do what I\u2019m told or do other things I\u2019m not told to do? I can\u2019t figure out your intentions.\u201d\u201cThis is also a test. Find the answer yourself.\u201dOftentimes, clients lied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Difference in EthicsThey hid crucial or potentially harmful pieces of information. It was commonplace for clients to confound their lawyers at the last minute when this critical fact was uncovered by the opposing party\u2019s lawyer. Clients also couldn\u2019t make up their minds even though this was their business and muddy their stance, giving their lawyers a crisis.Yoonshin presumed that this was Sehun\u2019s way of putting Yoonshin into a confusing situation of that sort to see how he would overcome this obstacle. However, Yoonshin was still unskilled in hiding his feelings, and his opponent was too seasoned in this area.Yoonshin\u2019s mind was in chaos as he attempted to compress his doubts and questions about Sehun.While thoughts flew in his mind, Sehun asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you move aside now?\u201d\u201cWait, Sehun Kang sunbae.\u201d1Sehun was raising his hand like he was about to push Yoonshin away to get out if the other man refused to move. Then, for some unfathomable reason, he pushed Yoonshin\u2019s slender body against the wall without warning.Thud! Yoonshin\u2019s back hit the marble wall and he grimaced. That wasn\u2019t all. The other\u2019s two large and fair hands roughly clutched his bony shoulders with quite the force. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t understand why Sehun was doing this because he remained expressionless.\u201cUgh, it hurts!\u201d Yoonshin exclaimed.Facing Sehun directly, Yoonshin could see that the other was significantly taller. Because of that, Sehun\u2019s towering shadow was cast down upon Yoonshin\u2019s pale face. Sehun was devoid of emotion, but his voice was more subdued than usual. He warned in a sinister whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t call me by my full name. Don\u2019t call me sunbae. I never permitted you. Just call me by my work title.\u201dDepending on their circumstances, people could act sensitively to this matter. Yoonshin could understand not wanting to be called by one\u2019s full name. He knew the firm\u2019s culture was not like that, but the habit from outside this firm kicked in\u2014he had just caught his mistake himself.However, acting overly defensive after being called sunbae was something he couldn\u2019t understand at all. It wasn\u2019t only because Sehun was Yoonshin\u2019s senior as a lawyer, the older man also graduated from the same law school. Perhaps it was because his quizzical look tangled with the pain on the surface of Yoonshin\u2019s face, Sehun loosened his grip and kindly explained, \u201cI don\u2019t like defining my relationships on a personal level with someone I don\u2019t know very well. You can only call me by three titles: Attorney Kang, Senior Attorney Kang, or Team Leader Kang.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Yoonshin replied, hands trembling. He clutched the wet towel in his hands tighter for no reason. He glanced down at his wrist, but Sehun saw the other man glancing and quickly took a step back. Still, the distance between the two was close.\u201cYesterday, you asked me how I brought the business partner to court, right?\u201d Sehun asked.At the random question, Yoonshin flashed back to yesterday. When he nodded calmly, Sehun continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t give her anything.\u201d\u201cRidiculous. Going there was crazy, especially if there was nothing to gain.\u201d\u201cInstead, if she didn\u2019t appear and tell the truth, I threatened her that I\u2019d send out the evidence that her only son was getting together with the chief officer of the security team. Fourth-year, a mother\u2019s love always gives me results far beyond my expectations.\u201dYoonshin tilted his head in confusion, not understanding Sehun\u2019s explanation. He narrowed his eyes, deep in thought until he came to a rational conclusion.So, instead of bribing her with money, was Sehun saying that he blackmailed her with her family member?This method forced her to voluntarily step foot into the lion\u2019s den to protect her family.It was a low and dirty method beyond his imagination, so even though Yoonshin thought his expectations were so low that there was nothing more to be disappointed about, he was quite disappointed.\u00a0\u2018This piece of trash\u2026\u2019\u201cDid you have to go as far as to find and use such a weakness?\u201d Yoonshin\u2019s clear eyes were full of genuine reproval. Sehun, who was looking down, bit his moist lips. His eyes turned cold as if he had heard the worst, most vulgar insult. His face turned icy. Although it seemed to never waver, his visage was in turmoil.\u201cWhat, do you think you\u2019re Jesus or someone? If you want to act high and mighty, you should have gone to a religious organization. Why did you come here?\u201d Sehun snapped.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! I just mean at least you could have\u2014!\u201d Yoonshin was about to clarify his criticism, but at that moment, the other firmly grasped Yoonshin\u2019s tie just like he did a few days ago after barging into his room. Then, he pulled the knot up tightly and threateningly.\u201cSir? Urgh!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were in a tie-sharing relationship with Secretary Tak.\u201d\u201cHow did you\u2014? This is\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want to explain yourself? That\u2019s not what I want. Shut up.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s bewildered eyes shook, losing focus. However, Sehun didn\u2019t care about the other\u2019s panic and simply gripped the fabric in his hands even tighter.Eventually, instead of the strip of fabric, the pressure given by the rather large hands made Yoonshin distressed. The sturdy back of Sehun\u2019s hand pushed on the younger man\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. It was futile for Yoonshin to squirm and struggle despite being gradually suffocated. Sehun acted violently without a trace of leniency.\u201cPlease let go first. Urk, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\u201cEven if you can\u2019t breathe, you can still hear, so listen carefully. \u2018Going that far\u2019 is my way of survival. I had nothing, so it was also the only method I could use. If you\u2019re so disgusted at these methods, I have nothing to teach you. I\u2019m the native here, and you\u2019re the alien. I won\u2019t stop you. Get out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Adjournment\u201cNgh, Attorney Kang!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to remain here, put away that contempt in your eyes. I feel like crap every time I see them.\u201d\u2018My eyes?\u2019\u00a0The warning was completely unforeseen, so Yoonshin stopped thrashing about in pain and stopped himself from coughing. He stared back at the other with dumbstruck eyes, his face reddened from being unable to breathe properly. Sehun slowly released the younger man.His face gradually returned to normal, but Yoonshin kept quiet instead of reproaching Sehun\u2019s outrageous action. It would be more accurate to say that he felt such a mix of emotions that he didn\u2019t know what to say.Amid the stillness, Sehun regained composure first and broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a few days off. Think carefully about what you want to take from me. You can formally sign your contract then. I\u2019ll let Attorney Song know of this.\u201dPat, pat. Some moisture must have remained on Sehun\u2019s hand as he lightly patted it on Yoonshin\u2019s dry shoulders. Then, Sehun turned on his heels and left without looking back.Yoonshin rubbed his head against the cold surface of the marble wall that he was leaning against and collected his breath. He stood all by his lonesome before turning his head to the mirror on his left side. He still looked pallid.\u201cPut away that contempt in your eyes. I feel like crap every time I see them.\u201dGoethe said that man tended to despise what he could not understand.Yoonshin wasn\u2019t aware that he was looking at Sehun in a particular way, but Sehun was probably right. Perhaps Yoonshin constantly had those eyes since he came to the firm. There was no way the experienced lawyer couldn\u2019t catch that.Did the other man read contempt in his eyes for a month?He had a feeling that it was likely the case.\u2018What the hell is this feeling?\u2019No matter how Yoonshin saw it, Sehun was the one in the wrong, a fact which Sehun himself knew very well.But strangely enough, Yoonshin felt troubled because he felt like he battered Sehun.* * *There was a saying in the practice.The best lawyer was one that didn\u2019t take the lawsuit to trial.Yoonshin generally agreed with that saying. He felt accomplished when the two\u00a0pro bono\u00a0cases he was working on for two months ended with a successful settlement. But no matter how cut out he was for public interest cases, Yoonshin felt that it was only right for him to stop warming up.It had been two months since he was hired. There were still no instructions from Sehun.\u201cHe told me to think. What can I think about if he won\u2019t even show his face?\u201d Yoonshin grumbled.Yoonshin was technically a member of Sehun\u2019s team, yet he had never actually assisted any of Sehun\u2019s cases to date. This time as well, a new\u00a0pro bono\u00a0case was sent to his room as soon as his files closed. He had inherited two cases from his other seniors.Much like the time before he entered the firm, Yoonshin had hoped for another coincidental meeting and loitered around the parking lot and lobby in the morning a few times. The time Sehun got off work was inconsistent, but he generally went to work at the same time, so there were higher chances of running into him in the morning. However, as if the two were nemeses in their past life, disallowed to meet, whenever Yoonshin waited for Sehun, he always missed the other lawyer narrowly.Yoonshin peeked out his office door window out of habit and rested his eyes on the room across. Demonstrating the cold and unfriendly nature of the other, his door was obscured with blinds. Today was not the only day that this was the case. In passing, Yoonshin once asked Secretary Tak, who replied that Sehun did that frequently. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t bring himself to grab Sehun for a chat because he had seen how busy the older lawyer was every day.\u2018Somehow, I ended up just waiting to hear from Sehun Kang all month long.\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin wondered what Sehun wanted to do with him.Could it be that Sehun wanted to exhaust Yoonshin so he would go away on his own?His train of thought continued until he reached the worst-case scenario, making him bolt up from his seat. Unwilling to prolong the situation any more, he exited his office.It was lunchtime, but thankfully, Secretary Tak was still in his office. Yoonshin casually leaned his arm against the desk partitions. While glancing at Sehun\u2019s room, he whispered, \u201cHey, Secretary Tak. Have you heard anything from Attorney Kang? Do I keep doing\u00a0pro bono\u00a0files?\u201dSecretary Tak tilted his head questioningly and replied, \u201cI know, right? There\u2019s no word from him. You clearly passed the first test.\u201dThe memory of being humiliated in front of his seniors surfaced and Yoonshin redness bloomed in his cheeks. \u201cThat was a pass? I don\u2019t need to retake the exam?\u201d\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know Attorney Kang well, huh? He\u2019s really ruthless. If you didn\u2019t pass, he would have sent you to a different team already. Just wait. He\u2019ll give you the second test soon.\u201d\u201cWill he though? I waited another month and he never followed up.\u201dSecretary Tak glanced at the worried Yoonshin, then at the covered windows of Sehun\u2019s room before he leaned in and whispered, \u201cYou look a bit anxious, so I\u2019ll tell you something. All the associates in the other teams saw a copy of your printout.\u201d\u201cThe one from the last test? How?\u201d\u201cApparently, Attorney Kang told one of them to copy it and pass it around. He said it was somewhat decent. He also said that, from now on, everyone should write up the main issues of each case like the printout. You know, lawyers work with a lot of documents, so it requires good writing, but even at our firm, a lot more people than you think write legal documents quite sloppily. Just so you know, none of the other associates have ever received such a compliment from the Senior Attorney before.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Adjournment\u201cSomewhat decent? That\u2019s a compliment?\u201d On the day of, Sehun outright threw the papers in the air, so Yoonshin thought Sehun had a problem. Yoonshin, who was very dumbfounded, was inadvertently loud, but the secretary simply shrugged. \u201cHmm, he is quite defensive in general, I guess.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. He sometimes acts like a piece of his brain has been messed up.\u201d Yoonshin\u2019s reply that sounded akin to a self-utterance must have come across to the secretary as having multiple overtones because he fell in deep thought momentarily.Prudently, Secretary Tak replied after a pause, \u201cThe senior attorney knows very well what\u2019s right or wrong. He may feel uncomfortable about it, but he just ignores it. However, he thinks of himself as the weaker party by birth. Other people give him work, and he does that work. He never said it himself, but I think he feels used. Besides, this is the world where the law of the jungle prevails. If you lose the battle, you lose your value.\u201dWhen Yoonshin, who felt impatient, heard that, he felt like he stopped breathing for a moment. He couldn\u2019t move an inch. He recalled what Sehun had said to him in the past.The older man was aloof in every situation. Yoonshin wanted to know why Sehun was so shaken up by the contempt in his eyes. This had bothered him all along.After he heard Secretary Tak\u2019s observation, Yoonshin could finally come up with a reasonable explanation. However, it wasn\u2019t Sehun\u2019s personal opinion, so it was hard for Yoonshin to come to a clear-cut conclusion about Sehun Kang.Was Sehun a bad person?With complicated feelings, Yoonshin stared at Secretary Tak. Their eyes met, and Yoonshin noticed that his lips started to move before he realized it. \u201cSecretary Tak, do you like Senior Attorney Kang?\u201dThe other laughed like he heard something absurd. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d\u201cIs that such an obvious thing?\u201d\u201cMr. Kang has his good points. He\u2019s very clear about rewards and punishments. Aside from doing your job properly, he doesn\u2019t demand anything else. He never asked me to handle anything personal for him. Isn\u2019t that the best kind of boss?\u201d\u201cI just thought it was the first time I heard anyone talk about Senior Attorney Kang like this.\u201d\u201cWell, other people you heard from don\u2019t know Senior Attorney Kang well. I\u2019m just telling you my opinion, as someone who has watched him as long as I have. This is my hunch, but I think he has been paying a lot of attention to you.\u201dYoonshin wasn\u2019t sure what the secretary meant by paying attention, but this was probably based on what Sehun told the secretary, so it couldn\u2019t all be nonsense. Sehun said that he didn\u2019t like Yoonshin. He even warned Yoonshin that he ruined Sehun\u2019s mood. This was apparent to others too. Yoonshin tried to shake off his irrelevant thoughts and thanked the secretary. He was about to return to his room when Secretary Tak stood up first. \u201cI was about to head down to the cafeteria. You should eat too. Hope you enjoy it.\u201d\u201cOh, right, I should. Let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cGo where? You should eat with Senior Attorney Kang.\u201dThis was so out of the blue that puzzlement was written largely on Yoonshin\u2019s face. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to eat with me? When? Where? Why?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you come out to meet him after you heard? He said he would tell you himself. I can confirm with him for you. One moment.\u201d Secretary Tak lifted the intercom receiver to double-check when they heard a click.The subject of the conversation, Sehun, came out from his room. Seeing the two side by side in the secretary\u2019s office, he gave a questioning yet subtly irritated and listless look.Was it Yoonshin\u2019s imagination to think that the gaze stung slightly?\u201cHave lunch with me,\u201d Sehun said.Yoonshin couldn\u2019t remember the last time that he heard this baritone voice from this close that he almost felt happy hearing it again. But before he could even convey his positive feelings, Sehun tossed his car keys at Yoonshin. Yoonshin reflexively extended his hands and caught the object. At the same time, he nodded enthusiastically which made Sehun frown slightly.Slightly shaken, Yoonshin glanced at Secretary Tak to let the other know that he would go on ahead. Chasing after Sehun, he picked up his speed as he got closer to the elevator, bypassed the other man, and quickly pushed the down button.The two stood next to each other, enveloped by a heavy silence.The silence made Yoonshin uncomfortable, so he spoke, \u201cSenior Attorney, did you know this is the first time you called me in a month?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re asking about my cognitive awareness or if you\u2019re reproving the fact that I neglected you for a month, but I\u2019ll pass on both of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026I was just trying to start a conversation. Not all people talk to scope the other person out.\u201dTheir eyes met in the glass surface of the elevator doors. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure if he saw right, but there seemed to be pity in Sehun\u2019s eyes.Yoonshin froze\u2014he wasn\u2019t trying to hide the fact that he was a bit sad as he looked at Sehun. He was worried that his eyes unintentionally made the other upset again.About to explain himself in case there was a misunderstanding, Yoonshin turned his head in Sehun\u2019s direction, but at that moment, the elevator doors opened.\u201cI was on the phone all morning, so my mouth is numb. Let\u2019s go quietly, mouths shut,\u201d Sehun said grudgingly and entered the elevator, with Yoonshin quickly behind him.After the doors closed, Yoonshin\u2019s eyes, once fixed on the instrument panel of the elevator, started to descend slowly like the floor numbers in the display. His eyes eventually landed on his destination, and while sneaking peeks at the striking curves of Sehun\u2019s profile, a thought suddenly occurred to Yoonshin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Trust and ConfidenceMaybe the other man chose to become bad because he didn\u2019t want to be weak.Like walking on eggshells, Yoonshin carefully spoke up. \u201cUm, Attorney Kang. About what you said to me last time\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re definitely trying to scope me out this time. Rejected.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even say my point yet. I practically only mentioned the \u2018o\u2019 in opening.\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s the opening or the closing, you won\u2019t hear my answer, so stop staring. I\u2019m not a painting.\u201d Sehun growled, causing Yoonshin to flinch. He didn\u2019t think that Sehun wouldn\u2019t notice his gaze, but he didn\u2019t think that he was feeling conscious of it. Yoonshin was flustered. As if caught doing something impertinent behind another\u2019s back, he started to feel embarrassed.Perhaps it was because Sehun told him to quit, but it only made his curiosity-filled eyes try to chase after the other even more. Yoonshin felt troubled by his impulse, so he looked away and bit his pursed lips. While Yoonshin was distracted and diffident, the machine faithfully descended to the lower floors.The two men were still reflected in the elevator doors, but Sehun was not looking in Yoonshin\u2019s direction anymore. The moment this registered in Yoonshin\u2019s head, he realized\u2014Sehun was avoiding talking about what happened back then on purpose.\u2018Coward.\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin uttered the two syllables in his head, and his sigh dissipated into his surroundings.Act 04The interior of the private room was like a sturdy sailboat.It felt like they were floating on calm, rolling waves, and all the while, Yoonshin kept glancing at Sehun. There was no way the other didn\u2019t feel the eyes of the younger, but he continued to quietly have his meal.Time kept ticking.Sehun dabbed his mouth with a napkin and looked directly at Yoonshin, who was sitting across from him. Yoonshin was sipping his water, but he set it carefully back down. \u201cYou have something to say, right? Go ahead. I\u2019m also done eating.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll cut to the chase and ask. What\u2019s your relationship with Attorney Song?\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t grasp the intention of the question, so he couldn\u2019t help but talk back. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re asking.\u201d\u201cYou met with her three times at a hotel before coming to the firm\u2014once to give your CV and twice for interviews.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s ri\u2014 How did you know?\u201dSehun\u2019s lips twisted wryly, and his overall expression changed. As if to confirm that it wasn\u2019t Yoonshin\u2019s delusion, Sehun\u2019s follow-up question had a hint of prurience despite it being midday. \u201cDid you sleep with her? You met her in a hotel room, Taesan Hotel\u2019s suite room.\u201dYoonshin was fidgeting aimlessly with his napkin, then froze stiffly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. \u201cWhat in the world do you\u2026?\u201dNothing was set in stone at the time, so after searching for a place that avoided the prying eyes of others, they ended up having no choice but to choose a hotel suite room.Each meeting was around two hours. Yoonshin\u2019s sister\u2019s secretary was also there each time. As Yoonshin heard about the firm\u2019s culture and atmosphere, Attorney Song advised him on how to work at the firm going forward. Yoonshin told the older woman about himself, his sister, his father, and his working style so far. Converse was the only thing they did in that room.However, it still didn\u2019t look good to go back and forth from a hotel with an older woman lawyer with a family, so Yoonshin\u2019s sister stopped information about this meeting from leaking. The fact that Sehun found out a closely guarded secret made Yoonshin realize that Sehun\u2019s network of information was not to be overlooked.\u201cWhy are you asking this sort of question?\u201d Yoonshin asked, not hiding that he was nonplussed.Sehun tapped the table and replied nonchalantly, \u201cI\u2019m just asking in case you two were involved privately. Even if you\u2019re Professor Do\u2019s son and a link to Soohan Group, Attorney Song\u2019s choice was strange. Handam, Taesan, Daeyoung\u2014I\u2019m one of the few lawyers who has dealt with all of the corporate giants in this country. Naturally, I know a lot of secrets related to different projects. Yet, to plant a specific company\u2019s in-law next to me? Obviously, I would be suspicious.\u201d\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a connection between my sister and Attorney Song, and that for Soohan, I sold my body to pluck out information from her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite unlikely, but the possibility is still there. No?\u201d\u201cSo what if I slept with her?\u201d Yoonshin retorted, sharper than usual. Yoonshin looked agitated. Sehun stared and then leaned back as if he lost some interest. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure what the other lawyer would say, but whatever it was, he read the truth in Yoonshin\u2019s face.\u201cSo you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cShould I do it now if it\u2019s not too late?\u201d\u201cDo you want to? That\u2019ll be the proof to confirm my suspicions.\u201dIt was perfectly reasonable for Sehun to doubt Yoonshin. It was as he said\u2014Sehun was someone who held a lot of confidential information about many companies. If Yoonshin were in Sehun\u2019s position, he would have had the same doubts.However, he couldn\u2019t understand why Sehun would doubt Attorney Song, who he knew since his childhood and who financially supported him, and think she would stab him in the back.\u201cWhat can you do with that evidence?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll make a good cause to terminate you,\u201d Sehun answered without a hint of hesitation, which caused a lump to rise in Yoonshin\u2019s throat. It wasn\u2019t just from being targeted with an inappropriate and ridiculous question. For some reason, Yoonshin felt disheartened that it was Sehun who questioned who Yoonshin slept with and followed by saying it was a good cause for termination. It seemed like stealing peeks at Sehun every day made Yoonshin one-sidedly feel some sort of friendliness with Sehun.Maybe that was why Yoonshin impulsively asked a question that might have been better unasked. \u201cThen what if I sleep with you? Who\u2019ll get fired between the two of us?\u201dEven Sehun, who was always prepared for any reply, was thrown off by this question. Sehun opened his mouth to retort, but he let out a burst of wry laughter.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d Yoonshin snapped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - Trust and Confidence\u201cI think we need to straighten out your misunderstanding first. Unfortunately for you, I\u2019m not a person to get fired. I\u2019m the one who fires people.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll be terminated regardless of who I sleep with.\u201d\u201cSo it works out like that. If you want to quit the firm, let me know any time. I\u2019ll help.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t quit. I will never sleep with Attorney Song or you.\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t figure out what he said that bothered the other, but it was clear that he did leave a scratch somewhere. Sehun\u2019s face was placid as always, but Yoonshin instinctively felt the annoyance radiating from behind the calm surface. Even so, he couldn\u2019t think of a way to address the situation except for changing the topic. \u201cT-the two of you have an age gap, but I heard that you were very close friends. You\u2019re comfortable with each other, and I know that Attorney Mihee Song was the one to scout you to Doguk and allowed you to come this far with her support. Is that not so?\u201dThankfully, despite the awkward change in topic, Sehun added his thoughts. \u201cIt seems like you get along well with your close friends, and they would never betray you even in death, huh?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so extreme.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have friends. I only have business partners who trust each other\u2019s abilities. That person and I just have a long history together. Oh, and now she entrusted me with a piece of baggage.\u201dThe way Sehun glanced at Yoonshin\u2019s way was graceful. Even though he was saying such cynical things, he was strangely elegant. Yoonshin felt like he was watching a scene in a well-executed, artistic film.Stupefied like a pitcher hit with a grand slam, the silent Yoonshin stroked his throat with his palm. Then, he looked directly at the other resolutely. \u201cExcuse me, but\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not excused.\u201d\u201c\u2014When did you start being so twisted?\u201d\u201cDo you want an opinion letter about why I\u2019m twisted? I could write an entire epic out of it.\u201d It was a cold-hearted response, but Sehun didn\u2019t seem upset. Yoonshin had an inkling of this since before, but Sehun didn\u2019t seem to get upset when a subordinate was outspoken when exchanging opinions\u2014on the condition that they were stating the truth.As long as he felt like he was right, Yoonshin was the type to say what he wanted and achieve what he sought, regardless of age and the societal position of the other party. However, the practice of law moved vertically. One of the reasons he never considered applying to a large law firm was because he was somewhat uncomfortable with hierarchical relationships. The difference between Sehun and his positions was like night and day, so Sehun\u2019s open-minded attitude in his respect always felt unprecedented to Yoonshin.\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with her. Are you satisfied now?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel more bothered.\u201d\u201cYou still doubt me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Yoonshin carefully asked, gauging the other.Sehun didn\u2019t seem to mind and replied, \u201cNo, you\u2019re too simple for me to doubt you.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a compliment\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause it isn\u2019t.\u201dYoonshin bit his lower lip and observed the other. Sehun, who had been kindly looking back, explained indifferently, probably thinking he would have to explain sooner or later. \u201cThat was the last shred of suspicion I had of you. Rationally, I don\u2019t think you have anything to do with it. But there\u2019s a thing called a one in a million chance. You need to be particularly wary of anomalies and variables. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d\u201cThere should still be a limit to doubting others.\u201d\u201cYou said so yourself, about the professional negligence case five years ago involving a savings bank executive director. You said that the prosecutors thought that the business partner would never appear as a witness. Then what happened?\u201dAfter feeling convinced that the partner wouldn\u2019t appear, the prosecutor disregarded any possibility that Sehun would bring the business partner and constructed his theory for the litigation. In the end, the prosecutor suffered the humiliation of watching the defendant, who he put in his effort to charge, getting away with probation before his very eyes. Sehun wanted to point out this one in a million chance.Removing all suspicions with no space for error was a big strength as a lawyer. Double-checking everything, down to the small facts that could easily be overlooked, was truly working for the best interest of the client\u2014this was something that Yoonshin felt like he could learn from Sehun. Looking strictly from the lens of a client, Sehun was the textbook example of a good lawyer.However, that was limited to work\u2014Yoonshin didn\u2019t think that he could bear to live so neurotically in his personal life. Wasn\u2019t it normal to trust a dependable, long-time friend?\u201cI thought so from the beginning, but we\u2019re a bit different from each other.\u201d Truth be told, Yoonshin wanted to ask if Sehun ever felt lonely living so mentally isolated from others. However, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask that. Maybe it was because he couldn\u2019t fathom how the other man would answer.\u201cI know that too.\u201d\u201cWait, then if you say that this was your last shred of doubt, then\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you return to the firm, Secretary Tak will give you a contract. Sign it\u2014of course, if you\u2019re willing.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201dAfter a short pause, Sehun glanced at Yoonshin. Yoonshin, who was slightly downcast before, looked brighter. The real deal started now. However, compared to the past two months of anxiety while being conscious of Sehun\u2014who didn\u2019t even talk, let alone look at him\u2014it was true that Yoonshin finally overcame one hurdle. Time at a law firm was denser than for other people, so two months felt like two years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - Charterparty\u201cThank you for accepting me. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to think about it at all? I told you to pick me apart.\u201d\u201cIf I was going to have doubts after coming in, I wouldn\u2019t have come in the first place.\u201dSehun nodded knowingly. \u201cSee? You\u2019re very simple.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t quite a compliment, but it wasn\u2019t an insult. Secretly relieved, Yoonshin grinned to himself, then his eyes widened in realization. Questions were written all over his pale face. \u201cBut why are you accepting me all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018all of a sudden.\u2019 I was watching all along and simply came to the conclusion that you\u2019re decent enough to keep\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even show your face often. I thought I was the only one who missed you.\u201d Yoonshin didn\u2019t understand why he was complaining as he would to a romantic partner. Despite being the one who said it, he was internally shocked at himself. What he wanted to convey wasn\u2019t supposed to have that suggestive nuance, but he kept his mouth shut because trying to explain himself was also weird. Maybe if Sehun said something, the weird situation would have been alleviated, but the older man also must have thought it was suggestive. His eyebrow twitched as he stared at Yoonshin. The mood grew weirder.Yoonshin cleared his throat and quickly changed the topic again. \u201cWell, then, what do I need to do?\u201dSehun checked his watch. He must not have had enough time left because he replied instantly, \u201cThere was something I needed to check with you, so I asked you to have lunch with me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\u201cFourth-year, as you already know, I sometimes do brazen things. Of course, this is only when needed.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cDo you in detail?\u201d\u201cI know that you coerce people using their weakness and sometimes topple over an entire company over the course of a day.\u201dSehun gave an affirmative look and straightened up his attire. He tightened his tie and aligned his cufflinks quite mechanically. Yoonshin didn\u2019t want to admit it, but Sehun was dashing in every moment.\u201cFinding the weakness of a corporation is a given. The opposing party\u2014plaintiff or defendant and their surroundings, including their lawyer, prosecutor, and if necessary, the associate judge of the trial\u2014I find their weakness at any cost. I\u2019m a big fan of bargaining, negotiations, and expediency. Plus, I\u2019m skilled at lying. I didn\u2019t hit rock bottom yet to forge evidence, but it\u2019s a common ordeal to pretend to not know of existing evidence. It\u2019s not against the law to genuinely not know of evidence instead of having it and ignoring it.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that I have to follow your ways from now on?\u201dSehun\u2019s hands stopped, then he flatly replied, \u201cIf you were the kind of person who could do that, I wouldn\u2019t have taken you out for lunch when I\u2019m always so busy. You keep working as you do because I\u2019ll only give you what you can handle. Of course, I could give you something that you have to follow my tactics for. Even if I do, if you get caught by an outsider, then you will be responsible for your actions. I\u2019m your superior, but I\u2019m not your caretaker. Up to here\u2014did you memorize all that?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cAnd here\u2019s the most important thing\u2014don\u2019t you dare question my judgment. You\u2019ll never have this chance again. If I decide on it, you have to sleep with me.\u201dYoonshin understood the gist of what the other wanted to say. It seemed like Sehun wanted to say that a partner\u2019s words were an associate\u2019s law. However, Yoonshin was a bit startled at the example Sehun gave, so he stayed silent for a moment. Sehun must have read Yoonshin\u2019s thoughts because he added, irritably, \u201cDon\u2019t make that face. I\u2019m not interested in your lower half.\u201dLooks were exchanged silently as if measuring each other. Yoonshin said what he felt was needed, so he decided to be mindful of Sehun\u2019s warning. Sehun seemed to implicitly know that this was Yoonshin\u2019s concern because he followed up by saying, \u201c\u2018This is against the law, this is contrary to the principles of morality, this is a violation of a lawyer\u2019s professionalism and ethics. Why did you go that far?\u2019 I can\u2019t stand when people have the sass to say those kinds of things. You\u2019ll need to pack your bags if you do.\u201d\u201cSo you hate when someone points out that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like to hear it, I have no reason to. I\u2019m never wrong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cWell, this may be the first time I was wrong about something. Taking you in, I mean.\u201dYoonshin pointed to himself, asking if Sehun was talking about him. Sehun didn\u2019t respond, but his reaction was an answer in itself. The younger man smiled awkwardly, which made Sehun knit his brow, seemingly displeased. The outlook of these two antipodal men\u2019s journey didn\u2019t look like it would be smooth sailing. But whatever the future held, today marked the day they weighed the anchor.\u201cNo matter how I spin it, it\u2019s my loss. Do I need to make a new deal?\u201d Sehun muttered to himself.\u201cDid you make a deal with Senior Attorney Song on the condition that you babysat me? Can I ask what it was?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I always wanted. Freedom of sorts.\u201dThe answer was abstract, so Yoonshin tried to find the answer himself. One idea immediately came to mind. \u201cWas it about your dividend payout?\u201dSehun didn\u2019t answer. That only solidified Yoonshin\u2019s suspicion. \u201cThat means I\u2019m profitable, right? Do you like money?\u201d\u201cMoney is a trophy of victory. I don\u2019t hate it.\u201d\u201cIt sounds to me like you don\u2019t like it either.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to spend it because I\u2019m busy cleaning up after other people.\u201dYoonshin pursed his lips and recalled what Secretary Tak said about Sehun feeling like the weaker party by birth. Perhaps he saw through Sehun\u2019s true nature and perfectly hit the mark.Yoonshin sat quietly, overcome with a complicated feeling. Sehun was done saying what he wanted and stood first. Then, he looked at Yoonshin as if he was foolish for not moving. \u201cIf you get the point, get going. There\u2019s a mountain of documents to read.\u201dYoonshin got up, collected his jacket and other belongings, and opened the private room door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - CharterpartyNext to the building of Doguk was an annex with the offices of the firm\u2019s incorporated association. Yoonshin was currently sitting in the said annex, in the corporate social responsibility team\u2019s office.The incorporated association was approved and founded 10 years ago, and after being granted permission from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, it operated as an organization performing volunteer work and charitable donations. It consistently encouraged the philanthropic activities of the firm\u2019s lawyers. Doguk\u2019s representative attorney sat as the chairman of the board of directors, and the board of directors was composed of several partner lawyers of Doguk, including Attorney Song and Sehun.Thus far, Sehun only donated a fixed amount of money yearly, yet he never did volunteer activities. Despite working at the firm for years, it was almost as if he had never set foot in the annex building even once.The partner didn\u2019t make an effort to invest his time into these matters, so his assigned time was being filled by Yoonshin instead. This was the first task that Sehun personally ordered, so to speak.\u2018He gave me a job that fits me, but why do I feel like I\u2019m just being used?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin exhaled steadily and recalled the other\u2019s fair face before shaking his head. Then, he handed documents to the middle-aged woman sitting across from him.One day every month, the organization ran a free legal clinic offering consultation and services to the elderly, low-income citizens, women with discontinued careers, and others who fit the legal definition of the socially disadvantaged class. The clinic booked phone and internet appointments in advance, then proceeded with face-to-face interviews. Yoonshin met the woman\u2019s eyes and continued his helpful explanation. \u201cMa\u2019am. So\u2026 The domicile\u2014I mean, people who leave where they used to live and aren\u2019t likely to return for a long time are called absentees.\u201dThe inquiry was simple enough. The woman scraped up all her assets and loaned them to an acquaintance that she thought she knew quite well so he could use it as his business funds. She lost touch with the debtor for a long time, and the debtor went missing. She was asking if there was any way that she could get her money back as it was now. Thankfully, in this case, the debtor owned a piece of commercial property in an apartment building.Yoonshin opened a window with an explanation of the relevant law on his computer screen.\u201cIf you look here, Article 22 of the Civil Act defines managing the property of an absentee. This allows personal property to be managed temporarily until the absentee returns or until their living status is confirmed. Simply put, this isn\u2019t limited to family members. Creditors can also become the administrator.\u201d\u201cThen, if I become the administrator, can I get back the amount that I lent? That old man has a shop in the storefront of the apartment. It\u2019s a one-story building. He owns it. I didn\u2019t think he would run away leaving that behind, so I lent my money to him\u2026 I never imagined not hearing any news of him\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can dispose of the property as his administrator, but you can manage it. You can make an application to the court and request to be appointed as the property administrator. Then you can lease out the building to another tenant and receive the monthly rent.\u201dSeemingly having found the key to reclaiming her money, the middle-aged woman\u2019s face brightened. \u201cCan Doguk do it for me? You could do it for me, young mister.\u201dYoonshin looked apologetic and shook his head. \u201cOur firm doesn\u2019t take on cases for individuals. I thought about how I could help and told a lawyer that I know. You can tell him that I told you to go to him. He\u2019ll do a good job helping you.\u201d\u201cOh, but it would\u2019ve been nice if Doguk did it for me\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps another time.\u201dYoonshin wrote down the address of the law office he worked with before he came to Doguk as well as the contact information of the office manager and handed it to the lady. She still seemed to be slightly disappointed, but she repeatedly bowed to express her gratitude and left the office.Yoonshin was left feeling sorry for being unable to help further yet fulfilled about assisting to some degree\u2014the contrasting emotions clashed, and he looked over the next client\u2019s documents again. He read it once before he came, but he reviewed the details of the case.\u201cLiving separated\u2026 And the man is unemployed long term,\u201d he muttered to himself.Yoonshin opened the legislation he had searched up beforehand and picked up the intercom. He let the secretary know that the next client could come in.A few seconds later, there was a rap at the door and a man around 30 came in and sat in front of Yoonshin. He greeted the other warmly and got straight to the point like a person of action. \u201cI read through your questionnaire. Your wife agreed to live separated for a certain period, but she still hasn\u2019t returned home. How long was your separation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been about eight months. Originally, we agreed to try living apart for around four months.\u201d\u201cHmm, the original period doubled. By any chance, did you leave anything about the agreement in writing?\u201dThe man was pensive for a moment, then answered in a trembling voice. \u201cNothing of the sort. Oh, but there is an audio recording. There was a lot of conflict at the time about getting a divorce, so I recorded every conversation I had with her just in case. That\u2019s probably on my old phone. Do recordings have legal force?\u201d\u201cThankfully, recordings between the related parties can be evidence. What was the reason for your separation?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - New File\u201cI quit my job and went back to school for a long time. After years of hardships with no results to show, our tension just kept accumulating. So we decided to take some time for ourselves first, organize our thoughts, then start fresh. I finished collecting myself, so I went back home, but I haven\u2019t heard from my wife since. I found out she quit the part-time job she did in her spare time and changed her phone number.\u201d\u201cSo, at this point, you haven\u2019t put together any documents and your wife one-sidedly\u2026 Sir, what do you want to do? I see you wrote down what you want, but it is a bit abstract.\u201d\u201cI want to make her return home. But my wife\u2019s family keeps saying that since we decided to live separately, wasn\u2019t our relationship over? They started talking about divorce settlements. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201dHearing the man\u2019s story so far, Yoonshin, as he did for the other clients, showed the other man the legislation on his screen. Then, he explained to the other, who was staring at the monitor. \u201cYou might have heard of this before. Married couples are obligated to live together. You had agreed to live separately for four months, so because twice the agreed amount of time went by, your wife is not fulfilling her marital duties. Cohabitation has a psychological and physical aspect.\u201d\u201cIt means we have to live together, right?\u201dYoonshin calmly nodded. \u201cYes. It seems like your wife has not fulfilled her duties, while you have attempted to. If you don\u2019t intend to divorce, you\u2019ve done well. If you ultimately cannot come to an agreement and go to trial, you will have concrete evidence that you intended to maintain the relationship, so it\u2019ll be difficult for your wife to win the litigation.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cBut in this case, I recommend trying to have a conversation first. If you try to force your wife to come back because she went against the law, there\u2019s a chance that she may retaliate further. Nine times out of 10, the relationship becomes worse. I would advise you to go to a couple\u2019s therapy before going to a lawyer. There are a few decent places in your neighborhood.\u201d Yoonshin was about to sincerely convince the man without hurting his feelings when he heard an urgent knock. A familiar face popped in through the door soon after\u2014it was a senior lawyer under Sehun. He seemed to have business at the annex.Yoonshin glanced at the client to excuse himself for a few minutes, but the senior lawyer spoke up first. \u201cAttorney Do, Senior Attorney Kang is looking for you urgently. You need to go back to the main building. He said he\u2019ll give you 10 minutes.\u201d\u201cI was just finishing up with my last consultation. Please let him know that I\u2019ll go after finishing up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean to meddle, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. It\u2019s better to run when he calls. He has a team meeting shortly.\u201d\u201cA meeting? I didn\u2019t hear about that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for the entire team. It\u2019s corporate/commercial, so he only called a few seniors from each expertise.\u201dBased on when Yoonshin timed himself before, it took about nine minutes to walk from the annex to the main building. He had to take into account the time that passed since he received the senior\u2019s directions, plus the time taken in the elevator. If he didn\u2019t run at full speed, it would be a close call.\u201cOh, then I\u2019m sorry, but could you finish up for me, please? The wife isn\u2019t returning after the agreed separation period. He can only contact the in-laws, and this man doesn\u2019t want a divorce.\u201d As he pointed to the monitor and briefly explained, the experienced senior understood the situation and signaled that he got it. The senior probably agreed because Yoonshin was summoned by Sehun and not that he wanted to do Yoonshin a favor. In any case, Yoonshin was grateful for the assistance. He gave the client a very apologetic look and asked for his understanding. \u201cHe\u2019s also a lawyer at our firm. He has more experience, so he\u2019ll take good care of you. I\u2019m sorry, but I need to leave first.\u201dThankfully, the client agreed. He bowed respectfully to the two in the interview room and swiftly left the room. Then he slowly started to jog and checked his watch.\u201cTen minutes\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I can make it.\u201dHis pace quickened, and his breath started to fill his lungs.* * *The main conference room on the seventh floor was filled with hubbub.The meeting about their corporate commercial lawsuit was impending, and the team of lawyers was hustling with the preparation.A certain private equity firm wanted to sue another company, which was a part of a consortium, for damages for failing to exchange shares. The meeting was in preparation for the lawsuit. Normally, it would have gone to the litigation group, but Mihee knew the clients well and personally gave the case to Sehun.Yoonshin was out of breath by the time he arrived from the annex and stood before the conference room. Sehun wasn\u2019t at his office, but he didn\u2019t even see the other\u2019s shadow in the conference room either. Yoonshin reached out to grab a senior lawyer to ask where Sehun was, but he soon quit that thought. Everyone looked extremely busy. This was no different from a battlefield. However, the room was abuzz with more vitality than he expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - New File\u201cSet the damn font for the financial statements in a readable one! C\u2019mon, what\u2019s with this readability? Leave ours but reprint Senior Attorney Kang\u2019s. Don\u2019t you know that he doesn\u2019t read and throws the papers on the ground if the font is shit? I\u2019ll give you four minutes. Run! And who organized the final document on corporate legislation for Attorney Kang? Final draft on corporate legislation?!\u201d\u201cI did that! I\u2019m also going to do the briefing. Someone put in a request for more juniors on our team, so we can make them do these tiny, tedious things. Are we at that position to be preparing all these meetings?\u201d\u201cPrecedents! The precedents, the precedents!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m printing them! Secretary Tak will bring them!\u201dYoonshin gawked at the scene, then was overcome with a strange feeling. It felt like a different room than when he did his presentation. He kept feeling this inexplicable feeling since he came to the firm. These were all people who had the same qualifications as him, but they looked like they lived in a different world.Yoonshin always considered a big law firm to be where lawyers grew fat and a pillar of corporate power and influence in Korea. Following that, he thought this place would be barren as a desert. Contrary to his prejudice, the work of these people was so healthy, so he was bewildered.Should he go in to help? Was he allowed to butt in without Sehun\u2019s permission? If so, he didn\u2019t know anything about corporate litigation, so what could he do? Was there a place for him to stand amongst those lawyers? Yoonshin\u2019s brain ran at full speed. Entranced, he was about to enter the room to at least help distribute the documents.Someone grabbed his bony shoulders from behind. He could feel the other party\u2019s supple skin over his clothes. Yoonshin gasped audibly and turned around to see Sehun, who he was waiting for. The office manager quickly caught up to the partner and handed him an envelope of documents before leaving on Sehun\u2019s request.\u201cAttorney Kang? Where were you? You weren\u2019t in your office.\u201d\u201cAnd where were you going to go?\u201d\u201cThe seniors looked very busy.\u201d\u201cDo you know how much that litigation is worth? It\u2019s not your turn to be a part of that yet. Then again, I gave you 10 minutes. Are you late or not?\u201dYoonshin admitted to his wrongdoings sheepishly, \u201cI\u2019m four minutes late. I ran fast, but I felt the limit of my stamina\u2026\u201dThe other\u2019s handsome brows crumpled slightly. However, since he was also not in his office, he seemed to give Yoonshin some leeway for his tardiness.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Without a second thought, Sehun took his hand off the other\u2019s shoulder and beckoned with his finger. Yoonshin stared at Sehun\u2019s back, going ahead first. He unconsciously touched his shoulder on the spot where Sehun touched. It felt like the softness of the touch lingered. Then, he snapped out of it and quickly followed.Sehun haphazardly tossed his documents on his office desk and leaned against it. Then, he stared at Yoonshin, who still didn\u2019t quite finish catching his breath. \u201cFourth-year.\u201d\u201cYes, Senior Attorney?\u201d\u201cWhere the hell were you? Why weren\u2019t you on stand-by at your office? Don\u2019t make me look for you.\u201d\u201cOh, I stopped by the annex. The free consultation clinic is scheduled on the last Friday of every month, which happened to be today.\u201dSehun didn\u2019t respond. He simply fixed his frigid eyes on Yoonshin and crossed his arms. Yoonshin started to feel the pressure of the tenacious and obstinate eyes, so he looked at the hallway through the office window for no reason. Now that he noticed, the blinds that were down nearly every day were raised. After registering that change, he looked back at Sehun, who was still maintaining the same posture and atmosphere.Yoonshin realized his mistake and excused himself. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in my office next time.\u201d\u201cYou took one hour\u2014that\u2019s three times the amount of time you could use for a quickie. You dropped by the annex? I\u2019m sure you meddled in far more than necessary when you could just give them brief advice. Nobody here does volunteer work as sincerely as you.\u201d\u201cWere you watching me work?\u201d\u201cDo you think I did? I was at the firm all day.\u201dSehun just meant that Yoonshin was that obvious.\u201cWell, I was only trying to work wholeheartedly. They\u2019re all struggling people. Moreover, the records will have your name on it, so I thought it would be better than just doing it casually.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m so touched. I could even cry. You can spend your time on it overnight and come back to me tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll use my time appropriately from now on.\u201dSehun shook his head in defeat, but he didn\u2019t reprimand Yoonshin any further. He uncrossed his arms and reached behind. He picked up the envelope that he had tossed and chucked it at Yoonshin. Yoonshin caught it reflexively and gave Sehun a quizzical look. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cYour case.\u201d\u201cWhoa. You\u2019re giving me a case?\u201dHeavy feelings such as trust were crafted carefully and gradually; like weaving fabric, they wouldn\u2019t just appear one day because one decided to trust another. The two started to weave their first fabric by putting the warp and the woof in the loom for the first time.Even though the change was small, Yoonshin was plenty satisfied. Thanks to that, his white face was filled with joy, adding a pink tint to his cheeks.Yoonshin stood at the boundary of dreams and reality, and all the while, Sehun was observing him. His cheek twitched, barely noticeably, and then he bit his lower lip. Surprisingly, he looked a bit psychologically swamped.Yoonshin was oblivious to Sehun\u2019s reactions. He pulled out the papers in the envelope and scanned its contents. His head snapped up, and at that moment, their eyes locked. Astonishingly, Sehun averted his eyes first. It was the first time this happened.\u201cSenior Attorney?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pro bono. Organize it yourself.\u201d\u201cAm I really in charge of this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Intent\u201cYou\u2019ve done a few pro bonos here, and you\u2019re doing two right now. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cBut the files I\u2019ve done so far were just rolling around and dumped on me. This one is a pro bono case that you\u2019ve personally given to me. I\u2019ll do my very best so that I don\u2019t cause you any harm,\u201d Yoonshin replied.Sehun squinted, displeased, then suddenly recalled something and said, \u201cWhile we\u2019re on this topic, return the two pro bono files to their original teams. From now on, listen to my instructions only, and do what I give you. You\u2019re on my team. You can\u2019t transfer departments without my permission.\u201dAfter saying what he wanted to, Sehun stood up from his desk and straightened his back. Then, he coldly walked by Yoonshin, whose eyes were focused on Sehun like a baby bird. Yoonshin felt that the conversation would end one-sidedly, so he instinctively grabbed the other\u2019s arm. The skin of another\u2019s palm touched the older man\u2019s bony and sturdy wrist. At that moment, Sehun whipped his head around.Sehun pointed an irritated glower down at his wrist.Surprised, Yoonshin took his hand off and bowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You told me to not touch you.\u201dSehun used his other hand to rub off the traces of the other from his wrist that was just released and said, \u201cDid you have questions? I have to go to my meeting. You have 30 seconds to ask.\u201d\u201cWell, Attorney Kang\u2026\u201d Yoonshin babbled.\u201c25 seconds.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been five seconds.\u201d\u201c10 seconds.\u201dYoonshin had something he wanted to say, but the other\u2019s hasty countdown made him anxious for no reason, and his mind drew a blank. Yoonshin kept hesitating and then finally opened his mouth to speak. He cautiously rolled his eyes up and realized that Sehun\u2019s sleek and sharp eyes were staring attentively. But for some reason, Yoonshin felt like the other\u2019s eyes were focused on his lips instead of his eyes.Was that just his imagination?It had to be his imagination.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dBut maybe it wasn\u2019t.\u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d\u201cBut 30 seconds haven\u2019t passed yet?\u201d\u201cIs that your question? Time just ended.\u201dSehun jutted his chin at the clock and walked out of the room in long strides.The door closed with a click.In a flash, the guest was left alone in a room without its owner. Yoonshin tried to gather his thoughts. He had a strong desire to look around this room a bit longer.Two months ago, when he first went to this room to wait for Sehun, he was so nervous that he never looked around fully. Now that he was alone and in a similar situation to last time, he thought back to when he saw the copy of\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0on Sehun\u2019s desk. He was overcome with an inexplicable impulse to confirm whether Sehun re-read the book because of Yoonshin.\u2018What should I do?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin glanced at the secretary\u2019s office through the office door\u2019s window and felt like he was given tacit permission. Perhaps it was because they were preparing for the meeting; Secretary Tak, the office manager, and the office assistant were away from their desks.Yoonshin hugged the file folder in his arms and checked Sehun\u2019s desk. However, all he could see were two laptops and a few volumes of precedents. The book that he was looking for was nowhere to be seen.\u2018I guess no matter how busy he is, he could already be done reading it in his spare time in the last two months,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought.He felt somewhat disappointed for some reason. As he turned to leave, he caught sight of\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0on the bookshelf. Mesmerized, he walked toward it and opened the first volume of the two books. Apparently, Sehun was the type to read books cleanly as there were no underlines or sticky notes in sight. Swallowing back his disappointment, Yoonshin started to return the book to its place.Plop. A golden ribbon hung from the bottom of the book. Yoonshin tugged it, opening where it was placed, and familiar words filled Yoonshin\u2019s vision.\u201cAnd then I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.\u201dIt was the quote he had used at court.When he saw that, his face suddenly started burning. He dabbed at his cheek with the back of his hand, hurriedly shoved the book back on the shelf, and ran away from the office. He went back to his room, locked his door, and pulled down the blinds\u2014something he had never done since his arrival.Only after he was completely isolated, he leaned against the wall, catching his breath.It could be a coincidence, but all the evidence pointed to one thing.It could be that there wasn\u2019t a grandiose meaning and simply another famous work of literature by a great man of letters. Regardless, Yoonshin felt funny to think that he made Sehun, who was always buried deep in work, do something.Yoonshin instinctively thought back to just moments ago, when Sehun\u2019s gaze fell exactly on his lips. Yoonshin bit his own lips.\u201cJust why\u2026?\u201dWhy did he feel embarrassed like a secret was uncovered?The only contact they had was Sehun\u2019s wrist, yet he felt like they had kissed.Yoonshin let out a long and troubled sigh, then swallowed dryly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - IntentAct 05Outside the window, it was dusk. Yoonshin got off work past midnight, but instead of going to his cozy abode, he dragged his leaden body to the 24-hour caf\u00e9 on the first floor of his apartment.He ordered a very bitter cup of americano, enough to jolt him awake, and bought a few donuts to pacify his taste buds. Then, he started to study the pro bono file that Sehun personally assigned. He was stuck, trying to understand this case for two days straight. Yet the longer he dwelled on it, Yoonshin\u2019s eyebags grew darker.The case was about the conflict between a president and manager of a mid-sized company. The manager, a married woman, sued the male president for s*xual harassment, but due to the lack of evidence, no charges were laid. Except for the complainant\u2019s testimony, all the documents submitted were insufficient. The situation ended haphazardly, so in turn, the president sued the manager for libel.\u2018He must have a reason. Why did he give me this file?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin wondered.Sehun clearly said that he would only give work that Yoonshin was capable of handling. He wasn\u2019t giving him mere homework\u2014he was teaching him how to work at the firm going forward in general, so Sehun was most likely being genuine.But the longer he stared at the investigation report for this case, the more he felt like he wouldn\u2019t be able to find the answer on his own. He read through all the documents twice, but it was the same. The accused couldn\u2019t be indicted for the crime no matter how hard he looked.Moreover, libel was difficult to prove, and yet the president counterclaimed. He clearly had concrete evidence showing that the woman\u2019s claim was intentional and told falsehoods. One wrong move and the client could be driven into a corner and hurt in the process.\u201cCCTV footage, texts, testimonies from colleagues, chat history\u2026 How could nothing turn up anywhere?\u201d Yoonshin mumbled, exasperated.Unlike other crimes, in the case of s*xual assault, if there was no material evidence but the complainant\u2019s testimony was consistent and detailed, there were cases when the accused was indicted. This case was different. All the witness statements excluding that of the complainant were consistent. Most notably, the accused and the other witnesses\u2019 testimonies matched.At this point, Yoonshin wondered whether the woman sued the innocent president for no reason. However, he needed to believe in this person, so he made an effort to shake off that nagging feeling. But that was all. There was a severe lack of evidence, so how could he demonstrate that his client was telling the truth? He still couldn\u2019t make a breakthrough.What would Sehun do in this case?\u2018How would you save the client, Sehun?\u2019\u00a0As those thoughts flashed by, Yoonshin was hit with a reasonable theory. \u201cIs this the second test?\u201dIf Sehun wanted to observe how Yoonshin worked at Doguk, the pieces of the puzzle fit together. Yoonshin was underlining a sentence with his nose practically diving into the papers when he put down the pen with a loud thwack. He looked up, looking troubled.Yoonshin was sitting in the corner-most seat of the caf\u00e9 at a bar-styled table facing a large window. He stared vacantly outside when he suddenly flinched on his stool.A familiar figure walked by.\u201cHuh\u2026? Attorney Kang?\u201dHe had just spotted Sehun.Sehun was wearing casual clothes. The black crew-neck sweater draping his firm upper body and the pair of jeans that accentuated his long legs suited him surprisingly well. He also matched his outfit with white sneakers. Everything he wore seemed to highlight his preference for cleanliness and tidiness. It looked like the snake in a suit had temporarily molted.The horrible timing that prevented them from meeting by chance not too long ago somehow allowed for the right timing this time. Sehun\u2019s perfectly timed appearance was almost uncanny.Yoonshin bolted up from his seat and knocked on the window.Sehun must have felt Yoonshin\u2019s gaze as he stopped his walking and glanced in Yoonshin\u2019s direction. Sehun stared back, so the younger man thought Sehun would either tell him to come out or he would come in himself. If neither was the case, Yoonshin thought Sehun would approach the window, but perhaps he had too high expectations.\u201cS-sir\u2026?\u201dSehun simply stared impassively, then resumed going on his way as if he had never even noticed Yoonshin in the first place. Yoonshin knocked on the window again, but the older man didn\u2019t even stop to look this time.\u201cWow, the nerve of that guy\u2026 There\u2019s nothing cute about him,\u201d Yoonshin grumbled.Yoonshin gathered his documents in a rush and returned his tray with his cup and plates to the pick-up counter. Then, he sprinted full speed after Sehun, afraid that he would miss him. After running in the direction Sehun went for a short distance, luckily, he saw the other turning into a darkened street.He gasped for breath and slowed down to walk beside Sehun. \u201cHahh\u2026 huff\u2026 Senior Attorney Kang. Nice w-weather today\u2026 hah\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you gather your things properly? You got out of there quicker than I thought.\u201d\u201cI moved as fast as I could.\u201d\u201cMaintain your class. I\u2019ll cut your paycheck if you ruin the firm\u2019s image.\u201dYoonshin grinned, telling Sehun not to worry about that. Then, Sehun finally looked at the younger man. He glanced at the na\u00efve, grinning face and frowned, seemingly annoyed again. Meanwhile, Yoonshin caught his breath and observed the other\u2019s unordinary outfit. He carefully asked, \u201cWhere are you going at this time of night?\u201d\u201cTaking a walk.\u201d\u201cYou must be the type to think as you walk. Me too. But the apartment\u2019s park is that way, not this way.\u201d Yoonshin pointed to the road on the left, and Sehun\u2019s eyebrow raised slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Approach\u201cDon\u2019t you think I would know better, considering I\u2019ve lived here longer than you?\u201d Sehun replied. Then, to show Yoonshin, he took an exaggerated step to the left. The road on the left passed by an elementary school. Since there were no kids who would be out this late, it was a tranquil road. Additionally, the stores were all closed. It looked like Sehun enjoyed this type of empty and deserted road at night.Maybe it was because of the languorous atmosphere, but the two walked side by side wordlessly. Eventually, uncomfortable with the heavy silence between the two, Yoonshin was about to break the silence. However, Sehun spoke up first. \u201cWhy are you following me? Just get to the point and go away. You\u2019re distracting me from my thoughts.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll walk with you only for a while longer. But I have something to confess to you first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a very skilled lawyer. Consider that first, then tell me.\u201d\u201cI read a novel from your bookshelf yesterday. There was something that bothered me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gone crazy. Capital punishment for you.\u201dYoonshin was shocked that the older man gave him a sentence without even hearing the rest of the story, so he instinctively reached out to Sehun\u2019s sleeve. Then, before touching the other, he pulled back and instead asked precipitously, \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to ask which novel it was?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what you saw in my office. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d Sehun retorted.\u201cBut that book\u2026\u201d Yoonshin started.Sehun interjected, \u201cI don\u2019t have it. You don\u2019t get it?\u201d\u201cYou want me to shut up now?\u201d\u201cI see you still have a brain.\u201dBut Yoonshin\u2019s convictions were solidifying. If nothing else, Sehun picked up\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0once more because of him.It just so happened that the quote he used in his hearing was bookmarked\u2014whether Sehun liked it or not, he naturally ended up bookmarking that page. Yoonshin briefly contemplated whether he should mention that. But seeing as Sehun caught on to what Yoonshin wanted to talk about just by mentioning the novel in Sehun\u2019s office, Yoonshin kept it in.Hesitantly, Yoonshin found another suitable topic and asked, \u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201dSehun looked aghast and countered, annoyed, \u201cWhat does it matter to you?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. But I figured sharing the bare minimum of personal information would allow us to show each other a bottom line of consideration\u2026 Oh, I don\u2019t have one.\u201d\u201cGreat. I hate when others are happy for no good reason.\u201dYoonshin grinned knowingly to himself. Sehun surely didn\u2019t read Yoonshin\u2019s thoughts, but what he said felt loaded. \u201cAnd above all, I\u2019m most bothered when you\u2019re the one who\u2019s happy.\u201d\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t even know me that well.\u201d\u201cExactly. I want to know why too. Why do I react so sensitively when it comes to you?\u201d\u201cIn any case, I\u2019m glad that there\u2019s something I could help you with.\u201dSehun suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked down at Yoonshin at a position slightly diagonal to him. So far, Sehun didn\u2019t look particularly angry. He didn\u2019t look like he was looking down scornfully either. However, Yoonshin felt an inexplicable curiosity coming from Sehun, so he was taken aback. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cIs it because you\u2019re an affluent young master, or do you just have no sense of fear? You\u2019re not afraid of me? Why\u2019re you so clingy? This is the first time I\u2019ve met someone like you, so I\u2019m genuinely curious.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s either, but if I must choose, it\u2019s probably closer to the former. The influence of the former probably made me into the latter,\u201d Yoonshin replied.From a young age, Yoonshin grew up without wanting anything. His mother passed away shortly after he was born, so he did feel something was missing, but that was only a fraction of his life. Besides, his sister raised and cared for him well, so he never felt lonely. On top of it all, his prestigious father was always respectable, and the inheritance that his mother left was significant enough that he was never in a financial pinch.Thanks to Yoonshin\u2019s thoughtful personality and his temperament unaffected by inferiority, he was always surrounded by a lot of people. He must have received the good genes because he was intelligent as well as good-looking. He didn\u2019t understand defeat, which was similar yet different to Sehun. He never lived walking on eggshells. These circumstances were why Yoonshin could look after the weak and chase after justice.This was also why he could intuitively see that Sehun thought he was absorbed in his affluence and disliked him.\u201cEach time, I feel like you\u2019re quite perceptive. Annoyingly enough.\u201d\u201cBut I do care about what you think. I want to learn more about you. I also want to get closer to you.\u201d\u201cGet closer? Do you do these things to get to know other people better? Disturbing walks? Eliciting small talk?\u201dIt was such an unexpected question that Yoonshin thought about the answer more sincerely and replied, \u201cRather than that, I start with the school they came from, where they live, and what their parents do.\u201dYoonshin paused to wait for Sehun\u2019s reply and glanced up at the other man. However, the man who had willingly replied now kept his mouth shut.Yoonshin racked his brain to think whether he misspoke, then swallowed nervously. He felt slightly troubled since he had just recalled that Sehun didn\u2019t have parents growing up. \u201cOh\u2026 So, what I meant was\u2026 Well\u2026\u201dSehun saw how flustered Yoonshin was and saw through the younger lawyer\u2019s thoughts. He could probably deduce that Yoonshin indirectly learned of his childhood. \u201cThis is why we can\u2019t be friends. Just do your work properly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - ApproachYoonshin had simply wanted to have a more personal conversation, starting with the existence of a girlfriend. This was his solution. Yoonshin knew what school Sehun graduated from, they lived in the same building, and he knew that his own father was a mutual connection. From the conversation, Yoonshin hoped that Sehun would bring up his teacher\u2019s name and expected the conversation to flow in a more heartfelt direction.But perhaps it could have been a mistake, depending on the point of view. Yoonshin corrected himself, \u201cPlease excuse me. I just thought my father was a mutual topic for conversation. I just wanted to chat with you a bit longer.\u201dThe other was increasing the distance between the two but stopped suddenly. Yoonshin also stopped.They were standing in a secluded corner of an alley. There were no streetlights here.It seemed like Sehun enjoyed pushing others into both psychological and physical corners. Although he hadn\u2019t laid a finger on Yoonshin, just walking toward him steered Yoonshin toward the wall. Yoonshin felt anxious and stepped back; eventually, his skinny frame hit the wall with a thud. At that moment, Sehun stood before him like a looming shadow.Just as before, he grabbed Yoonshin\u2019s chin and leaned toward him, tilting his face. His obstinate eyes were determined to probe the face of the other despite the poor lighting. Yoonshin felt uneasy and swallowed, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing.The way Sehun\u2019s red lips slowly opened was quite sensual.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you found a common topic between us and decided to chat me up?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t wrong, but it wasn\u2019t quite right either.\u201cIsn\u2019t there another way you can phrase that? Other people could misunderstand if they heard that,\u201d Yoonshin replied. He recalled a question that he constantly yet unwittingly carried these days. Sehun didn\u2019t give him a special reason, but for some reason, Yoonshin\u2019s thoughts somehow kept flowing in a suggestive direction, so he wanted to address it at some point.Just a few months ago, he had no idea that he would ask this kind of question to the other man. With the back of his hand, he brushed his pink-tinged cheeks and asked, \u201cSenior Attorney, are you interested in me by any chance?\u201dSehun looked bemused and simpered. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who keeps making advances at someone who wants to leave.\u201dYoonshin humbly conceded\u2014Sehun said nothing false. Not only did he hold Sehun back, who left after ignoring him, but he also disrupted the other\u2019s personal time by following him. It wasn\u2019t like Yoonshin particularly liked Sehun, but for some reason, he kept chasing after the other.\u201cBut you\u2019re the one who made us stand like this. I\u2019ve only seen this position in movies.\u201d\u201cSo you think that this position is a proceeding for a writ of\u00a0habeas corpus\u00a0that shows that I\u2019m interested in you. You know, I hate being indebted. Think about what Soohan Group could do to me if I laid hands on you recklessly. I\u2019m not interested in finding out.\u201d\u201cYou keep grabbing my face and taking me apart with your eyes. Why do you do that?\u201d\u201cI just feel like observing you thoroughly when I see you. That\u2019s all.\u201dThat was what made it weirder. They didn\u2019t have positive feelings for each other, but sometimes, an oddly heated air hung between the two. It was quite confusing.But it seemed like Sehun couldn\u2019t figure out the exact reason either, so Yoonshin gave up on his interrogation. The chilly air of the night felt like it got warmer, so the best he could do was wrap things up. \u201cI get it. I won\u2019t take it the wrong way. I only asked just in case.\u201dThe expressionless older man stared at Yoonshin\u2019s clear face. As his heated gaze continued to linger, Yoonshin, who was trying to calm down, became nervous yet again.It was because of these moments. Sehun, who seemed uninterested in his surroundings, kept behaving in a way that flustered Yoonshin. Yoonshin silently watched Sehun for two months at the firm, but never saw Sehun behave like this with anyone else. Therefore, he felt more nervous and more conscious of the other. It was all Sehun\u2019s fault.Despite acknowledging that he reacted more sensitively to Yoonshin, Sehun also said he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in Yoonshin\u2014Yoonshin had to accept this as it was now. Honestly, it was better for Yoonshin that the older man was disinterested in him.\u201cUm, Attorney Kang,\u201d Yoonshin called the other.The other didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he slowly backed away, retracting his looming shadow, then resumed his walk. Barely releasing his tension, Yoonshin chased after him again. The two were slightly further apart than before as they walked beside each other in the darkened alley.\u201cSo, you know the case you gave me today. This is your second test, right?\u201d Yoonshin carefully asked.\u201cIt\u2019s something like that. You\u2019ve never done a s*xual assault case before, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s my first.\u201d\u201cFormally accepting you into the team is one thing, but I also need to figure out how to use you the most efficiently and what tasks to assign you. Solve it the way you want. I\u2019m just looking at the basics, like what you pay the most attention to, how you interview the client, and how you plan your strategy.\u201d\u201cWhile we\u2019re on that, could I ask you for some advice? More than anything, I also want to learn how you work.\u201dSehun shot a displeased glare at Yoonshin in disbelief and looked away. \u201cDo you know how much I charge per 10 minutes of advice? Ask after you pay.\u201d\u2018Not only does he have a bad temper, but he\u2019s also mean.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Blind SpotYoonshin searched Sehun\u2019s face with narrowed eyes, then looked down. As he watched the sleek line along his nose bridge and lips, it occurred to Yoonshin that if Sehun hated this conversation, he would have already sent him away. After all, Sehun had the power to do that.Feeling braver, Yoonshin asked, \u201cI looked through the documents for the case and found a clear lack of evidence. Plus, the witness statements all match up to each other. Evidence and witnesses are crucial in s*xual assault. The accused seemed to have kept that in mind and defended accordingly.\u201cYou\u2019re right. The majority consistently and precisely said the same words. Your client was the only inconsistent one.\u201d\u201cYes, everything seems to be completely against the client, enough to make me think that the lawyer who submitted the claim was a thug wanting to rip out money. Honestly, I was wondering if we should leave it be. I thought that maybe settling at this point mitigates the most risks.\u201dDeciding to drop the charge meant that the prosecutor couldn\u2019t find evidence to pursue the charge. The police investigations couldn\u2019t uncover evidence that she was s*xually harassed. But even at this point of the situation, Yoonshin\u2019s client continued to protest that she was being wronged.\u201cIs there any piece of evidence that you can trust?\u201d Sehun asked.\u201cHmm, well the manager is consistent in her statement that she was s*xually harassed. She went to see her therapist after every business trip she went with the president. She submitted records of her visit as part of her evidence. However, that is simply her consultation history, so it could be used against her as proof she was intentionally acting out\u2014that she went to get consultations to back up her false claims against the president as revenge.\u201dSehun sighed in agreement. \u201cThis is why the police and her lawyer didn\u2019t believe in the client.\u201d\u201cThe complainant was the only one saying something contrary to the majority with no substantial evidence at all to back her claims.\u201d\u201cDo you believe the police disclosure? Rather than your client\u2019s words, you seem to believe the conclusion of the government administration.\u201d\u201cBut they already investigated it\u2026 and if I don\u2019t believe the disclosure, I can\u2019t do anything as a lawyer. You know that.\u201d\u201cNo, sometimes lawyers can do more than the prosecution,\u201d Sehun said.Yoonshin stopped and stared at Sehun. Surprisingly, Sehun also stopped. He leaned against the wall of a building\u2019s enclosure and stood crookedly, waiting for Yoonshin to continue. Their eyes were glinting with professionalism. It was then that Yoonshin finally understood why he was given this case. It wasn\u2019t as simple as defending the client against libel.\u201cDo you expect me to completely turn the case on its head? We\u2019re at a disadvantage no matter how I see it.\u201d\u201cTherefore, if you show me how you win, your life at the firm will be around 0.1% smoother.\u201d\u201cI also want to believe in my client\u2014I truly do\u2014but what can I do when the court is where evidence speaks for itself? It\u2019s plain to see that we\u2019re holding back a guiltless person. Of all people, I want to find something.\u201dUnspoken rules and moral exceptions existed in society; however, everything about law relied on evidence. The client was the only one claiming s*xual harassment yet couldn\u2019t prove it. On the other hand, the president was probably obtaining evidence that demonstrated that the manager was lashing out with vengeance for his counterclaim of libel.Directionless and deep in thought, Yoonshin gnawed on his bottom lip.Just then\u2026Sehun, who was also lost in thought, took one step forward. Then, he staggered like he sprained his ankle. He lost his balance and extended one of his long arms toward the ground. He barely managed to steady himself, but perhaps because he was in an awkward position, he ended up grabbing Yoonshin\u2019s bulge over his pants. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he squeezed it with considerable force.\u201cGasp, are you okay\u2014what are you, urgh! Are you nuts?!\u201d Yoonshin flinched. The briefcase he was holding dropped loudly. With both hands now free, Yoonshin grabbed the other\u2019s firm shoulders to push him away. However, the moment he pressed forward, the hand which grabbed Yoonshin\u2019s member rubbed the outline of his shaft over his pants. Yoonshin felt his arms grow weak.Yoonshin\u2019s face grew red, and he gasped. \u201cW-wait, ah, ngh! Senior Attorney!\u201dRegardless of how bewildered the other was, Sehun kept at it. Confusion filled Yoonshin\u2019s eyes as he looked up at Sehun. The other\u2019s eyes were void of guilt.Not knowing what to do, Yoonshin staggered backward. Then, his trembling hands clutched the other\u2019s shoulders. The fabric of the older man\u2019s sweater crumpled and its softness tickled his palms.\u201cLet\u2014go, agh! Angh!\u201d\u00a0Slap! Yoonshin mustered up all the strength that he had and whacked the other\u2019s shoulder. Sehun finally let go without looking very affected. Yoonshin slumped on the ground. He panted heavily, heated breaths escaping his lips.It was the first time Yoonshin was the target of something like this, so he had no idea what to do. He was so stupefied that he sat there like that for a while. When he could finally get back to his senses, he merely stared at the slim legs in front of him. He slowly looked up and saw Sehun\u2019s unabashed face looking down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Blind SpotYoonshin clutched his briefcase handle and stood up, bringing himself closer to Sehun\u2019s eye level.\u201cWhat did you just do? You\u2019re out of your mind, right?\u201d Yoonshin said bitterly.\u201cFourth-year.\u201d\u201cI want to hear an apology first!\u201d\u201cListen carefully. You were just assaulted by me. Now, a question for you.\u201d\u201cQues\u2014 What?\u201dYoonshin was appalled while Sehun remained tranquil. He continued steadfastly, \u201cI grabbed your d*ck without consent. I\u2019ll stay consistent and claim that I tripped, and to retain my balance, I reached out and happened to grab you accidentally. Proof? Look\u2014the street is narrow and the ground is uneven with rocks. The judge will believe my statement.\u201dRocks?Seeing the fairly large, jagged rocks that Sehun pointed out, Yoonshin was dumbstruck. He thought back to when he thought Sehun staggered for no reason. \u201cYou did it by accident?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t make mistakes.\u201d\u201cBut then\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut I said that\u2019s what I\u2019ll claim. Then what can you do?\u201dNow levelheaded, Yoonshin looked around. This was a very secluded road. The surroundings were so quiet that he wondered whether this neighborhood always had such a quiet road. There were no streetlights. There were also no parked cars. It didn\u2019t seem like he could obtain CCTV or dashcam footage as evidence. As mentioned, Sehun knew this neighborhood better because he lived here first.\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence. Then I\u2019ll have to prove the assault with circumstantial evidence.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cYou pushed me against the wall on that road over there. You also did it at the firm\u2019s bathroom once. Sometimes you stare intently at me when you walk by, and in your office, on my lips\u2026\u201dBefore Yoonshin could finish, Sehun interrupted, \u201cWhat did I do to your lips? Did I kiss you?\u201d\u201cSorry? No.\u201d\u201cDid I grope you anywhere below your collarbone? Did I undo a shirt button?\u201d\u201cNo to that too.\u201d\u201cDid I try making a pass at you usually? Did I send you a suggestive signal? Did I make lewd jokes to you?\u201d\u201cNo, none of that\u2026 You never did those. You didn\u2019t even really look at me.\u201dAs if that was the answer, Sehun snapped his fingers at Yoonshin. \u201cThe firm\u2019s employees will also say that. I never even looked at you. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019ll say something different. Plus, since you were groped in a blind spot, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201dYoonshin tried to choose his words wisely, but there was no backbone to his claim. Knowing that, Sehun then asked, \u201cDo you think this is unfair?\u201dYoonshin\u2019s answer was immediate. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYour client feels the same.\u201dShe also believed that the law would save her and sued, but she never expected that her situation would worsen. There was neither the evidence that could support her claim for what she suffered nor witnesses to testify in her favor\u2014exactly like this current situation.\u201cListen carefully, Fourth-year. s*xual assault cases may look simple, but it\u2019s a very finicky area. You can\u2019t simply try to support a claim as you did so far with your labor law cases with visible evidence. You don\u2019t know what the mood of the room felt like at the time of the crime. Only the victim knows. Such things can\u2019t be \u2018proven.\u2019 You said that I stared at you intensely. How do you define the degree of intensity? Where\u2019s your proof? All judges like proof.\u201dYoonshin regretted admitting to being conscious of Sehun\u2019s gaze and felt embarrassed. His face was pallid.\u201cYour mouth is the only lively thing. So far, you only represented people who were upset and wronged. It\u2019ll be different going forward. Even if it doesn\u2019t meet your standards and you think, \u2018Is this okay? I might get f*cked over at this rate,\u2019 you might have to follow and respect the firm\u2019s position and direction. Otherwise, you will get f*cked over. That\u2019s why you need to win,\u201d Sehun said.There was always a trail of evidence when a person was wrongfully terminated, unpaid for their labor, or injured from construction. Sehun\u2019s words were a warning, telling Yoonshin to take a fundamentally different approach to the cases he took on so far.Yoonshin nodded slowly, crushed by the composed but firm atmosphere between them. Sehun continued in a low voice, \u201cIf you have time to question whether you\u2019re going after a guiltless party, I recommend you trace back and investigate how that b*stard of a president coordinated all the witness testimonies and just why in the world the investigators couldn\u2019t find evidence. Now, back to square one. How do you want to prove that the other party s*xually assaulted the client?\u201d\u201cShould I look for another victim? s*xual assault is an offense likely repeated. I could print the list of employees and search for a person who wasn\u2019t able to sue the president yet. Or what if I look for traces of bank transfers of an inordinate amount of money?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I call a waste of time. Even if you find something, it\u2019s all over if the third party isn\u2019t brave enough. The IT industry is small. You may be able to risk your job to live beautifully, but the majority of people can\u2019t do that. Can you take responsibility for their livelihood? Then your chances may be increased by 25%.\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s a battle of win or lose, the probability is actually 50%,\u201d Yoonshin shot back.\u201cThe lawyer is stupid, so I think I\u2019d better adjust that to 15%,\u201d Sehun retorted.Yoonshin tucked in his bottom lip and sighed.Blind spot.He mused about the hint that Sehun gave, then said, \u201cThe client said that she was assaulted three times in total. If that\u2019s the case, the offense occurred three times, but weirdly, there\u2019s no evidence in this day and age. The assailant must have known in advance that the location had a blind spot, just like how you knew.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Pandora\u2019s BoxAt a loss for words, Sehun scoffed, yet he didn\u2019t deny what Yoonshin said. Instead, he asked, \u201cSo, what can you do?\u201d\u201cThe assailant is the president of a company. He doesn\u2019t move alone and makes public appearances in various places. There might be someone who told him where all the blind spots are. Should I investigate the correlation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been two days since I\u2019ve given you the file, yet you still haven\u2019t done that?\u201d Sehun queried, then raised his left hand. Yoonshin flinched and raised an arm defensively, thinking that the older man was going to touch him again, yet the other man scowled as he simply checked his wristwatch. Yoonshin felt a bit sheepish and averted his eyes. \u201cOh, I thought you were going to touch me again.\u201d\u201cYour initial approach isn\u2019t bad. The investigation in the disclosure is too clean. As you may know, there\u2019s rarely a time where all the witnesses of the same incident have the same testimony. This isn\u2019t murder, and it isn\u2019t robbery, so in the perspective of the police, this case is insignificant, so they didn\u2019t dig deep enough. You need to be open to the possibility that there could be gaps in the police investigation.\u201dAbove all, it was likely they felt that it was too much work. Yoonshin never handled such a case, but he watched similar things happen from the sidelines. Plus, he didn\u2019t say it to Sehun, but it was also possible that another lawyer interfered and made a deal with the prosecution. They were all likely possibilities.\u201cOkay. I think I can salvage something if I look into it deeper. First, I\u2019ll meet the secretaries, especially the ones who personally follow the president.\u201d\u201cHe hired a professional security company. The personal secretaries under him all have a close relationship, so instead of them, look into the employees at the security company.\u201d\u201cI really should look at the company cash flow, right?\u201d\u201cI already taught you everything. It\u2019s time to hike down the mountain. I\u2019ll be grateful if you write your resignation letter while you\u2019re on your way,\u201d Sehun said derisively.Yoonshin thought that Sehun was being too nice. Their conversation looped back to the beginning.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even reach the summit yet.\u201d\u201cIf you want to keep going, find something first. Then negotiate with or blackmail the president. Pressure the other party so that they retract the counterclaim against your client. While you\u2019re at it, make them give some money to the client and apologize. Finally, go comfort your client on a white horse. You like that, playing the hero.\u201dYoonshin had never threatened or coerced anyone before, but based on the prospective result, Sehun\u2019s method was the best option. Even if he found evidence that the client was harmed, it would be the president\u2019s first charge, and considering how light the sentence was in proportion to the nature of s*xual offenses, the president wouldn\u2019t be greatly affected. Ultimately, it was better to be somehow beneficial in substance to the client.Yoonshin gripped his briefcase and bowed his head in a way ambiguously in between apology and gratitude. Sehun stared intently at Yoonshin\u2019s craned neck before he swiftly turned around and walked forth with no further explanation.Yoonshin made a complicated face as he watched the other go. He was amazed that Sehun knew the case better than he expected.\u00a0\u2018I thought he wasn\u2019t interested in pro bono cases.\u2019Sehun was someone who clung desperately to victory; yet he was more helpful to the client than Yoonshin, who was hung up with the evidence he could see. Honestly, it was a shock for Yoonshin, who had unconsciously felt a bit of ethical superiority to Sehun. He felt the tune of his mind transpose uncomfortably from harmony to dissonance.\u201cWait for me, Senior Attorney!\u201dDeep in thought as he watched the other\u2019s slim frame grow smaller, Yoonshin chased after Sehun a step later.* * *Yoonshin went to work earlier than usual to read the file. He made a large arc in the air with his pen wedged between his long fingers. He couldn\u2019t sleep well last night. What Sehun had said the other night bothered him and made his throat feel tight.\u201cYou like it, playing the hero.\u201d\u201cHow come everything he says is full of himself? That\u2019s a talent,\u201d Yoonshin muttered.But in a different light, Sehun hit the nail on the head. With mixed feelings, Yoonshin resumed reviewing his documents. Funnily enough, he felt like he could find the path to the right solution by following the advice from his superior last night.\u201cI got the list of restaurants and bars that the client went to with the assailant\u2026 Checked the point of contact between the security company and the restaurants\u2026 I wonder if it\u2019s possible to track the bank accounts of the security guards at the company?\u201dTo track a person\u2019s bank account, one would need to formally request permission. It was only possible if the investigation authority granted a search warrant. However, Yoonshin wanted to proceed covertly. He knew that the opposing party was the type to be thoroughly prepared when it came to legal issues.He wondered if it was possible to secretly investigate through the professional investigation unit at a big law firm. He contemplated whether to ask Secretary Tak and looked up. But instead of just Secretary Tak, he also saw Sehun, who was listening to a brief of his schedule upon coming to work. As always, he was in a well-ironed suit. Sehun was perfectly put together at all times.He was also always busy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Pandora\u2019s Box\u2018That sadist is always working except when he sleeps. Does he ever feel out of breath?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin felt his thoughts muddle for no reason, so he leaned his chin on his hand and observed Sehun\u2019s handsome profile. Just then, Sehun, who was facing the front, suddenly looked at Yoonshin\u2019s office.Yoonshin felt a pang of guilt for peeking, so he turned around and pretended to concentrate on something. At the same time, he heard the other rapping at his window. Feeling troubled, Yoonshin barely managed to lift his head and nod at Sehun. However, it seemed like Sehun wasn\u2019t asking for a respectful morning greeting. He remained standing in front of the office door.\u2018What\u2019s he up to first thing in the morning? So what if I watched him a little bit? He takes me apart in my face,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin grumbled internally and stood from his desk. As he did so, the other beckoned with his finger. Yoonshin glanced at Secretary Tak questioningly, but although the secretary clearly was in the know, he simply indicated with his hand to follow Sehun.With no other choice, he chased after Sehun into his office, and as soon as he stepped foot inside, a yellow envelope was pushed\u2014almost thrown\u2014into his arms. Yoonshin looked down at the envelope. \u201cNgh\u2026 What is this?\u201dSehun hung his jacket neatly on a hanger, then started looking at the piles of documents on his desk. He replied disingenuously, \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d\u201cAre they related to my file?\u201d Yoonshin pressed on.\u201cSomething like that. It\u2019ll help with your negotiation. Don\u2019t ask for the source.\u201d\u201cIs it all right for me to open something with dubious origins?\u201dSehun didn\u2019t look very pleased that Yoonshin was questioning the reliability of the document he gave, so he retorted cynically, \u201cDangerous documents should be used surreptitiously and silently. Do I need to teach you that too?\u201d\u201cI see that there\u2019s no source, but it\u2019s also\u2026 dangerous.\u201dDespite explaining in a way Yoonshin could understand, he still looked skeptical. Sehun ended up frowning. \u201cFourth-year. What did I say my words were?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re an associate\u2019s law,\u201d Yoonshin answered.\u201cIf you got it, you can leave.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Thank you, even though I don\u2019t know what this is and where you got it from. I\u2019ll use it significantly and dangerously well.\u201d Yoonshin bowed and turned around. He thanked him while wishing Sehun would hold him back, but the older man ignored it despite knowing Yoonshin\u2019s wishes.The sound of paper quickly shuffling continued. Yoonshin took one slow step forward before turning back again. He marched up to the other\u2019s desk and received the typical, haughty glare of Sehun.\u201cWhat is it this time? There\u2019s a mountain of opinion letters I have to read, so I\u2019m busy. Ask fast.\u201dOf course. Sehun didn\u2019t hold Yoonshin back even though he knew.This jerk.\u201cHave you ever dealt with a s*xual assault case before? Or did you always do legal advisory work from the beginning?\u201d\u201cI was in the corporate law team from day one.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean you haven\u2019t?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I did a few pro bono cases until I hit my fifth year. Then I went to school overseas.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me how you worked back then? I\u2019ll keep it in mind when I plan my approach.\u201d Yoonshin was extremely curious about Sehun\u2019s past. He hadn\u2019t been this curious about anything in years. He was dying to hear Sehun\u2019s story, so although the other didn\u2019t agree to answer yet, Yoonshin\u2019s eyes were already sparkling in anticipation.Seeing Yoonshin\u2019s excitement, Sehun perhaps had a few minutes to spare as he glanced at his watch before leaning back in his chair. \u201cFor the most part, I didn\u2019t go to trial; instead, I found ways to rip off the most settlement money as possible.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 settlement.\u201d\u201cEven if you go to court, there\u2019s very little in it for the victims. They\u2019re only seared with the brand that they\u2019re a victim of s*xual harassment. Not only that, but that process is very painful. It would be nice if the assailant received a heavy sentence at least. However, as you may know, unless the offense was cruel and unusual, prison sentences are rare.\u201d\u201cBut what if the complainant wants a heavy sentence rather than a few more dollars?\u201d\u201cFourth-year. There are times when money is the touchstone of justice instead of a high sentence. You have to think of what the ultimate win is for the client. If your client has the wrong idea, then it\u2019s your job to persuade and lead them on the right path.\u201dYoonshin mused on the advice that Sehun was giving casually when one question cropped up. The question inflated like a balloon that was about to explode at any moment. It was hard to imagine the current Sehun doing this, but he had a feeling that perhaps he was different in the past. \u201cBy any chance, when you did pro bono work, have you ever sincerely consoled the victims? Since this type of case requires that to some extent compared to others.\u201dAs Yoonshin reached the crux of his question, Sehun frowned, failing to understand why he would ask such a ridiculous question. \u201cI don\u2019t do that kind of thing. End of discussion. Get out.\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2019m not done asking\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re still here in the next minute, I\u2019m going to call the police on you for obstruction of business. What\u2019s your move?\u201dYoonshin knew that if he stayed, Sehun would carry out his threat. Yoonshin gave a sidelong glance at Sehun, who stared dryly at the younger man with the intercom receiver in his hand. He then gripped the envelope tightly with both hands like he was strangling Sehun and stomped out of the office.He traversed across the secretary\u2019s office back into his room and sat upright at his desk. Then, he gazed at the yellow envelope on his desk and fell into deep thought.\u2018A dangerous document of mysterious origin that would help in the negotiation, huh?\u2019\u00a0The envelope was Pandora\u2019s box. Once opened, Yoonshin felt like he wouldn\u2019t be able to turn back.Whatever was inside seemed like Sehun\u2019s shortcut which led to the destination the client wanted. Yoonshin was compromising bit by bit with himself. It wasn\u2019t as difficult or unsettling as he had expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - Essence of the TestAll people had multifaceted personalities.Maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014the facet that Yoonshin was looking at could be just one of many. Sehun must have been annoyed by Yoonshin when he disrupted his walk, yet the older man listened attentively, guided him in the right direction, and created a new path for Yoonshin.Oddly enough, Yoonshin believed that he could somehow win if Sehun stepped forward to help him. Sehun was absolutely on the client\u2019s side.Yoonshin knew that Sehun ultimately wanted personal victory, but true to the saying \u201cthe end justifies the means,\u201d Yoonshin would hire Sehun if he were the client, no matter how high his fees.\u201cYour client feels the same,\u201d\u00a0Sehun had said.Yoonshin thought,\u00a0\u2018He does anything to win. He\u2019s also a man of a thousand faces\u2026 But maybe one of those faces can empathize with clients who are victims.\u2019Yoonshin placed one long finger on the end of the envelope and drew a circle over it.Then, resolutely, he opened the envelope and pulled out a memory card.Act 06Knock knock.Someone knocked on his door from outside. Preoccupied with reading documents, Yoonshin lifted his head slightly to check the clock. It was already lunchtime. He didn\u2019t expect to have time to go down to the cafeteria today, so he asked Secretary Tak in advance to buy a sandwich for him. It seemed like it was Secretary Tak at the door.\u201cYes, come in.\u201d The door opened, and someone entered the room. Yoonshin waved at the coffee table to tell the person to leave the food there. \u201cIf you leave it there, I\u2019ll eat it at some point. Thank you and have a nice lunch.\u201d\u201cHoney, are you very busy? Can\u2019t I eat with you? I haven\u2019t eaten yet either,\u201d an unexpected voice said. Surprised, he looked up and saw Mihee with a paper bag containing the packaged sandwich and a drink carrier.\u201cAttorney Song? What brought you here?\u201d\u201cI was on my way down when I bumped into Secretary Tak. He told me that you\u2019d be eating in your office. I wanted to have lunch with you, so I bought these myself. Come here if it\u2019s all right with you.\u201dSmiling, Yoonshin stood up and approached the older woman. They sat across from each other and took out their sandwiches from the bag. Although it didn\u2019t quite exceed Sehun, Attorney Song\u2019s workload made her nearly as busy as Sehun. She must have had a specific reason to visit just another junior lawyer. Yoonshin pushed a coffee cup in her direction and asked, \u201cI don\u2019t think you came to visit me for fun.\u201d\u201cI just came to chit-chat with you. How\u2019s work going so far?\u201dYoonshin took a sip from his cup and smoothly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s all right so far. I\u2019m not in charge of any big files. I\u2019m just doing tasks of various sizes when Attorney Kang asks or skimming through the public interest case that he gave me.\u201d\u201cYour team is corporate, but most of the files are M&A, so a labor law specialist will be useful. You\u2019ll be able to participate in team meetings soon. You know what I mean, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m grateful that he even accepted me and raised my salary to that of a fourth-year associate. I think I would also find it suspicious if a nepotism hire suddenly dropped from the sky. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll call me if he thinks I\u2019ll be helpful. I\u2019ll just keep going at it.\u201d As he replied, he couldn\u2019t help but glance out his window for no reason. Yoonshin opened the plastic lid to his disposable cup and inhaled the scent of the coffee. Then, observing him, Mihee asked, \u201cIs your sister doing well?\u201d\u201cMy sister? She seems pretty busy these days. We used to call each other up to twice a week, but I haven\u2019t been able to contact her these days. I\u2019m starting to miss her children, but it\u2019s not working out.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I was surprised when I was first contacted by Ms. Ikyung. We work closely with Soohan Group, but most of our communications are through their legal department\u2014I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to personally meet the second wife. I did see her once in passing at Professor Do\u2019s funeral a few years back, but I thought that was the end of our relationship.\u201d It was a roundabout question of his sister\u2019s intention for sending him here.Quite frankly, Yoonshin didn\u2019t have the answer\u2014only a hunch. \u201cThis is just my guess, but I think that my father told my sister about you. He occasionally told us about his most outstanding students when he came home from work and cracked open a bottle of soju. I didn\u2019t appreciate what he was talking about at the time, but\u2026 In any case, since she contacted you, I suppose she thought that you were trustworthy enough to take care of me.\u201d\u201cOh, she has a lot of confidence in our firm, then.\u201dThat was one thing he knew for sure. Yoonshin was always very near and dear to his sister\u2019s heart. His sister felt their mother\u2019s warmth until she was in middle school, but Yoonshin had never been held in their mother\u2019s arms. She had always felt sorry for Yoonshin and took good care of him.Yoonshin smiled, affirming Mihee\u2019s comment, and took a bite into his sandwich. While he was chewing the contents thoroughly, Mihee grinned and stared at him intently like she was examining him through a microscope. Slightly astonished, Yoonshin wiped the corners of his clean mouth and tilted his head. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Essence of the Test\u201cNo, I was just thinking about how Sehun managed to keep you so far. He was quicker to concede than I had expected. I thought he\u2019d bully you persistently for about half a year, yet he gave you the green light in two months. I don\u2019t know why he was in such a rush.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone else who suited the word \u2018bully\u2019 better than Senior Attorney Kang,\u201d Yoonshin said.Mihee clapped enthusiastically in agreement. She laughed heartily. \u201cHe\u2019s a character, isn\u2019t he? He kind of looks like someone who\u2019d be inclined to S&M.\u201dYoonshin almost spilled the contents of his coffee cup. He attempted to keep a straight face and breathed evenly. He had no idea what face to make in this kind of situation. Mihee didn\u2019t pay any mind to Yoonshin\u2019s reaction and added, \u201cAttorney Kang makes a lot of money, but you know, he isn\u2019t obsessed with material wealth? Did you know that?\u201d\u201cCan someone be both a high earner and not greedy for money?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably just taking money into account because it\u2019s the easiest way to confirm his worth since a lawyer\u2019s individual net value is important. But Sehun doesn\u2019t make deals based on how much he can make. He decides based on how much it stimulates either his desire for accomplishment or his competitiveness. That\u2019s why he especially likes taking on appeal cases.\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t understand this at all. \u201cHe likes appeals?\u201d\u201cYep, so when he\u2019s drowning in consultations, he brings one of those in. He\u2019s not in the litigation group, but it seems like he can\u2019t give up on appeal cases. He thinks that everyone works 24 hours just like him, so the team\u2019s seniors sometimes curse\u2026 Well, he\u2019s pretty much asking to be insulted. Anyway, you\u2019ll also have to do some tedious work like organizing documents for him because of that.\u201d\u201cI knew he liked fighting the difficult fight, but I thought he would hate picking up things others have touched.\u201d\u201cThink about it this way. There\u2019s a charm in turning the tables where another lawyer lost in the trial. He says that\u2019s what makes it exciting. To begin with, it\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dYoonshin pondered about it for a moment, then he answered, a bit let down. \u201cIs it for the feeling of superiority? It suits him too well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just saying he\u2019s perverted.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to\u2026\u201d Yoonshin couldn\u2019t bring himself to finish his sentence and chuckled awkwardly, and Mihee simply nodded in understanding. If Sehun made people tense, Mihee was the opposite, easing the other person\u2019s tension\u2014like unwinding one\u2019s fatigue. Yoonshin felt this way since his first interview with her. That was probably why Sehun also returned to Doguk despite his many other options.Hesitantly, Yoonshin then said, \u201cI want to know what kind of person Attorney Kang is.\u201d\u201cSehun? He\u2019s just as you see him\u2014smart, talented, and handsome.\u201dYoonshin was going to bounce back lightly with a joke, but then he pursed his lips.When he heard Mihee\u2019s comment, a certain handsome face came to mind. As if the person himself were standing before him, the image was clear and vivid.Yoonshin wasn\u2019t usually interested in other people\u2019s appearances and could only clearly recall the faces of his sister, father, and close friends. He realized then\u2014he had stolen peeks at Sehun for no particular reason and thought about him so frequently that he could easily remember the other man\u2019s face.Feeling a bit of anguish, he swallowed dryly and said a beat later, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot more to him than that. There were parts of him that I misunderstood, and I think he\u2019s a lot scarier than I had imagined.\u201d\u201cScary? I heard that Sehun hasn\u2019t even shown you anything for real yet. Whatever you saw is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\u201cSee\u2026 Not too long ago, he sent me some files regarding a pro bono case I\u2019m working on.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know how, but it seemed that Mihee already knew that Sehun took steps to make Yoonshin\u2019s work easier. Her eyes gleamed with curiosity, and she leaned forward, showing how eager she was to listen. \u201cWhat was in it? I heard Attorney Kang used a private investigator. I don\u2019t know if you know, but those guys are really difficult to handle and very pricey. They also always meet at different places, so I have never seen their faces before.\u201d\u201cWell, perhaps I should say that it was just a fatal weakness of a mid-sized company that looks trustworthy on the surface. I could also say that it\u2019s a vital key to push one man and his family into an abyss in an instant.\u201d If Yoonshin threatened to leak the information he received to the media, the opposing party would promptly retract his claim, compensate his client, and hold a press conference in apology. There was a full spectrum of everything from corruption at his company to scandalous stories about the president\u2014it was a matter of Yoonshin choosing what to use.He beat around the bush, but the woman sitting opposite to him seemed to get a gist of the contents of the information. Mihee looked amused, then lost in thought for a moment, she said calmly, \u201cSehun always seduces people with the concept of reward and punishment. He probably gave it to you because it was decent enough to give you. Use it well so that it doesn\u2019t go to waste. It also looks like he wants to see how you use it, while you\u2019re at it. He\u2019s not very trusting of others.\u201d\u201cYou think so too, right? He gave it to me to use. I guess I\u2019ll get in trouble if I don\u2019t use it, huh? But the scale is too large. It\u2019s only a mid-sized company in name, but it\u2019s a longstanding company that most know the name of.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a skill to cherry-pick the information and use it well.\u201dYoonshin finally grasped the goal of Sehun, who designed this plan. \u201cSo this is the real test. He\u2019s trying to see if I\u2019m ready to dirty my hands.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - SisterMihee simply shrugged, neither confirming nor denying. \u201cWell, following Ms. Do\u2019s wish, Attorney Kang is the best teacher to show you how to survive. Just endure under Sehun for two years, then go study overseas.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s eyes became wide. \u201cWill I be sent overseas? I\u2019m asking in case my sister had other plans for me.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. I only brought it up because it\u2019s normal for juniors to study overseas after they hit their fifth year. Why? Do you like it here? Your sister said you\u2019d stay for a few years before you\u2019d want out.\u201dOf course, Yoonshin had this in mind since he first entered the firm. He was planning on listening to his sister\u2019s request by staying for a few years until she could appreciate that he had done as much as he could. But he felt slightly bothered to know that his sister expected him to do that. She knew her younger brother better than he had thought.Since he couldn\u2019t readily agree in the face of the daughter of the firm\u2019s director and the one who actively recruited him, Yoonshin bit his lower lip. Maybe Mihee knew that he felt conflicted, so she changed the topic. \u201cYou siblings take after Professor Do. You must miss him. He was a good man\u2026 Sehun pretends he doesn\u2019t, but he and I both respect him very much because he was always impartial and considerate.\u201dSehun Kang respecting someone\u2026Yoonshin couldn\u2019t picture that very well. Even if he somehow sketched the outline, he couldn\u2019t add color to it. Yoonshin grinned bitterly. Mihee took a bite of her sandwich, but she tilted her head in confusion. Only after getting that confused look did Yoonshin realize that he smiled. He felt even more troubled than when he realized that his sister read him like an open book.He feigned composure as best he could to hide his bewilderment. \u201cI do miss him from time to time, but I\u2019m fine since I have my sister. Her kids are also cute. My brother-in-law isn\u2019t as bad of a person as other people say he is. After all, my sister chose him.\u201d\u201cI thought this before, but you and your sister are quite close.\u201d\u201cI consider her to be someone to protect. I\u2019m sure my sister thinks the same about me.\u201d\u201cAttorney Kang calls that a weakness\u2014something to protect. He thinks people shouldn\u2019t have that.\u201dPerplexed, Yoonshin blinked like a flickering tail light. He thought the opposite\u2014that it was a sign of strength.Mihee read the question in his eyes and added, \u201cWhat I mean is that if you want to last long under that guy, don\u2019t expose yourself too much. If he needs to attack or control you, he\u2019s going to touch that first. There are a few juniors who were shaken off in that way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cGood. Oh my, did I take too much of your time? Let\u2019s eat quickly. This tastes pretty good.\u201dYoonshin started to dig in, matching Mihee\u2019s pace. He ruminated on the conversation they had as he munched on the fresh vegetables in his sandwich.As someone acquainted with Sehun for a long time, Attorney Song seemed to know a lot about him. Thanks to that, Yoonshin felt that, despite the casual conversation, he indirectly learned a lot about Sehun. Secretary Tak\u2019s hints were also greatly helpful.Clearly, Sehun seemed to be the type to act on his words. If he thought people shouldn\u2019t have things to protect, he wouldn\u2019t hold anything dear enough to want to protect it.\u2018Is that why he\u2019s always on the offensive?\u2019Based on Yoonshin\u2019s observations to date, Sehun fit the stereotype of a \u201csmart but bad guy,\u201d yet that stereotype also seemed contradictory. Sehun was ruthless, powerful, and merciless, which seemed like defense mechanisms to Yoonshin.Maybe that was why Yoonshin couldn\u2019t help but be concerned about Sehun. Without realizing it, his eyes kept chasing after the other man, and he wanted to know what the other was thinking.Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure of what he felt. Was it tension in front of his supervisor, consideration from dealing with a person who he fundamentally didn\u2019t get along with, or another feeling that he was unaware of?Like there was a thorn in his side, he continued to feel bothered about his strained relationship with that scathing critic.* * *Yet again, Yoonshin was buried in documents at the firm until late, only managing to return home near midnight. He felt like he would drive half asleep, so he took a cab. When he got off at the entrance of the apartment, he got a call that stopped him in his tracks. It was quite late at night, so there was only one person who would call him.When he checked his phone, as expected, it was his sister.He accepted the call and perched on a nearby bench.The chilly night air nipped and bit at him a bit painfully, but he felt more awake thanks to that. He enjoyed this refreshing feeling, so he stayed seated. \u201cIkyung? I didn\u2019t hear from you for a while\u2014what made you call so late at night? Are the kids doing well? And my brother-in-law?\u201dIkyung replied, sounding hoarse, \u201cEveryone is doing fine. I stocked up your fridge with some side dishes. I told you to hire someone\u2014why didn\u2019t you? Your place is a mess. Crack open a window from time to time.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need a housekeeper for a single man\u2019s apartment\u2026 I go there just to sleep these days. But when did you visit? You should have contacted me first. Then I would have gotten off work earlier.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just on my way back from your place. I just got to the garage. I came because I had something to tell you, but you were a lot later than expected. I\u2019ll come back next time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - SisterYoonshin stopped fidgeting with his hands. \u201cWhat? Then, are you still in the basement?\u201d\u201cYep. Are you still at the firm? I only see one of your subcompact cars.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2026 Wait there for a moment.\u201d Yoonshin had stretched out his long legs leisurely, but now, he stood up from the bench and started walking briskly. He was making his way through the entrance, which was fashioned like a triumphal arch with an attic, when he saw a black sedan turning the corner of the garage exit. The number on the license plate was familiar. He waved cheerfully, and the car stopped.The car shifted to neutral next to the park, and its back windows rolled down.\u201cIkyung!\u201d Yoonshin ended his call and looked at his sister in the backseat. Her dark bucket hat was pressed down on her head as it covered her face, her scarf was wrapped several times around her neck, and she was wearing a black face mask. Yoonshin could barely see a square inch of her skin. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to show me your face? Why\u2019re you so hard to see these days?\u201dOnly then, Ikyung finally lifted the brim of her hat slightly to meet her brother\u2019s eyes. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t be sure since it was dark, but she looked very tired. As he thought, she must have been very busy. Her voice was also cracking unlike usual. He had thought her voice was hoarse over the phone, but it sounded even worse when he heard in the flesh. \u201cYoonshin, thank goodness\u2014I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to see you before I left. Is work going well for you?\u201dYoonshin was quiet but then grabbed onto the edge of the window. \u201cNo wonder your voice sounded a bit weird. Did you catch a cold?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s nothing serious, so don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\u201cWhy did you come over when you\u2019re sick? Roll the window back up\u2014cold air will get in. I\u2019ll get in the car instead.\u201d\u201cNo, stay there and listen. I won\u2019t take long before I leave.\u201d Ikyung stretched her hands out and forced Yoonshin\u2019s hands out of the car. Yoonshin looked shaken after he was suddenly pushed back from his sister\u2019s car.Ikyung wasn\u2019t being her usual self. She had never pushed him away like this before. But today, she was clearly refusing her brother\u2019s approach. The fact that she averted her eyes after pushing him away seemed to confirm that. To others, it could appear to be just another action with no further meaning, but Yoonshin could feel that this was different because she had never pushed him away like this before.Frankly, he felt quite disheartened. If she told him to, he was ready to eat foods that weren\u2019t to his tastes and wear uncomfortable clothes. Even though it had been a while since they last met, he found it regrettable that she was uncomfortable with Yoonshin getting closer.Yoonshin was numb from being hit full force with the uncomfortable air between the two, then he warily asked, \u201cDid something happen between you and my brother-in-law?\u201d\u201cNothing happened.\u201d\u201cDid he tell you not to go outside without permission again? You fought about that last time. Or is it about the kids? If there\u2019s anything I could help\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. In any case, Yoonshin\u2026\u201dYoonshin got increasingly upset and shoved his hand in the car window again. Then, he gently grasped his sister\u2019s shoulder, asking her to look at him while talking. He did this several times when they bickered. But for some reason, his sister was reacting very defensively to his physical contact today and slapped away his arm irritably.A loud slap rang out as their hands collided. Ikyung\u2019s silky scarf caught on Yoonshin\u2019s hand and slithered down onto the floor. His sister hurriedly tried to cover her neck again, which Yoonshin thought was very suspicious. \u201cIkyung?\u201dThere was one thing Yoonshin learned from meeting with the interested parties in several cases over the years. In cases like now, his gut feeling was correct nine times out of ten. People who were injured or suffered monetary damages always tried their best to hide their suffering from the people they cared for the most. They hated the thought of making their loved ones worry. His sister\u2019s behavior was a good example of this.Yoonshin got a bad feeling and glanced at his sister\u2019s personal secretary, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. He steadfastly faced the front despite the small commotion in the back.The good-natured secretary was a university junior who their father trusted. Ikyung took him with her when she got married 10 years ago. Yoonshin had thought that the secretary was hiding something from him last time, and it seemed like what he was trying to hide had to do with his sister.Now having conviction, Yoonshin yanked off Ikyung\u2019s mask while she bent over to pick up her scarf and cast it aside.\u201cYoonshin Do! What are you doing?!\u201d Ikyung yelled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Sine Qua NonIf it wasn\u2019t a very skilled robber who broke into their highly secured mansion, the only other person who could harm Ikyung was his brother-in-law. He never was one to keep his hands to himself, so he always had bad rumors follow him, but he had never touched his family before. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the case anymore.Upon making that connection, Yoonshin urgently tapped at the window that was rolled up to the top. \u201cIkyung! Ikyung! I said open the door!\u201d\u201cAre you not going to keep your voice down? Someone might hear! It\u2019s nothing. Just take this first.\u201d Ikyung slid out a thin, white envelope through the narrow crack of the window. Instead of taking it, Yoonshin simply stared at it. In her impatience, Ikyung finally opened her door and stepped out, showing herself. The moment Yoonshin was face to face with his sister, his expression crumpled completely.\u201cWas it my brother-in-law?\u201d\u201cYoonshin.\u201d\u201cI asked if it was my brother-in-law.\u201d\u201cTake this first. I told you I had something to tell you.\u201d She made Yoonshin take the envelope with his trembling hands and said as she adjusted her clothes, \u201cShe\u2019s a daughter of a decent family. All the information is summarized in the envelope. Try meeting her.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to go on a blind date? In this situation? Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cI think your brother-in-law needs that family. I\u2019m not asking you to marry her right now. Just meet her first. You have to make some sort of move so I have something to report back.\u201d\u201cYou came to me looking like that, and you\u2019re telling me to go on a blind date because my brother-in-law wants me to? What is this world coming to?!\u201d\u201cCalm down and listen. This is an opportunity. My husband needs this family. To say differently, if you\u2019re connected to this house, you\u2019ll be safe no matter what happens. Thankfully, the other side seems to like you very much. They\u2019ll contact you first, so if you like her, you can try going out. Even if you\u2019re going to reject her, at least go to the first meeting.\u201dYoonshin was about to protest, but his sister was faster. \u201cAnd I already ordered from the people I always buy wine from. If you get a call, ask your firm\u2019s staff to receive it quietly. It\u2019s one bottle for Attorney Kang and one for Attorney Song. I already personally delivered the bottle to the director. They\u2019re very expensive wines, so\u2026\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t make sense of what she was saying. He was bewildered. His head throbbed, preparing to explode because he was injected with too much information at once. Yoonshin angrily cut off his sister, \u201cIkyung, I can\u2019t understand a thing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of collecting evidence!\u201d She was speaking calmly before, but this time she raised her voice. Then, she looked around, worried that someone heard, which Yoonshin felt bad about.Yoonshin had no choice but to lower his voice. The air going through his throat shook uncontrollably. \u201cHe\u2019s doing such horrible things to you that you need to collect evidence. Yet you\u2019re still telling me to see a woman that the b*stard wants me to meet. How bad is it that I at least have to be safe? Please, explain to me.\u201d\u201cI told you, I\u2019m collecting evidence. I wasn\u2019t just a sitting duck\u2014I knew and allowed it to happen. He was always one to thirst after love, and he told me that he found someone he loved. He wanted a divorce because he didn\u2019t want to cause an uproar at the company with rumors and feared potentially influencing his succession, but I didn\u2019t want a clean breakup. Even if I do end up getting a divorce, it\u2019ll be a lawsuit. That\u2019s why I\u2019m waiting for the right time.\u201dDivorce?Lawsuit?Ikyung was wiser and smarter than Yoonshin. Their father always praised her for those traits. His sister always had a purpose for her actions. So when she said that she was going to marry her current husband, their father and Yoonshin both believed in and supported her. Unlike his dirty public image, perhaps there was something else that they couldn\u2019t see in his brother-in-law that captivated Ikyung.His brother-in-law truly loved and cared for Ikyung. The couple\u2019s married life was generally smooth sailing. They had minor conflicts, but they were all issues that every married couple had.But something must have changed.\u201cThe other party is a chaebol. You can\u2019t even compare to those people. Just run away when he says he wants to break up.\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019ll be a long battle, and I\u2019ll get more hurt than now. Most big law firms won\u2019t even take my case. Not only would they stop getting work from Soohan, but Soohan would use every means to bite back. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking at this in the long run. No matter what, I have to get my hands on evidence and ensure. I have my kids to worry about too.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t hand over the kids?\u201d\u201cFor his succession and inheritance, he will do everything to keep the custody and care of the children. I have to fight if I want to keep them.\u201dDespite the rope burns on her neck, his sister\u2019s eyes were clear. She was very resolute. Knowing her, she probably already contemplated this and simulated multiple scenarios in her head. Yoonshin knew that he needed to go along with her wishes. In his heart, he wanted to pull her out of that house immediately, but he knew deep inside that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do that in the end.\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m physically strong, and I\u2019m sturdy. I\u2019m worried about you. I\u2019m worried that you\u2019ll get swept up in this.\u201d\u201cIs now the time to be worried for me?\u201d\u201cBut if it\u2019s Doguk\u2026 Doguk is a good firm. They have a good reputation and a stable foundation. The partners are all very skilled. A lot of them are our father\u2019s students. Moreover, Soohan gives a lot of work to the firm, so Doguk holds many of its weaknesses. The company can\u2019t go after them so easily. I thought it was the best choice out of all the firms.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Sine Qua NonNaturally, the events of the past few months flashed in Yoonshin\u2019s head.Once he connected his sister\u2019s and his situation these days, everything seemed to fall in place. All his questions seemed to be answered.One needed to be prepared to give up much more than what they wished to take away from others. There was no way his sister didn\u2019t know that. Moreover, her target was the second son of one of the top 10 conglomerates in the country. She had to place Yoonshin in a safe zone before her fight truly started.\u201cThat\u2019s why you sent me to Doguk, to shield me? Selling our father\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cIf you had continued to do free legal work at Jaeya, that man would have tried to mess with you first. He knows that I care for you deeply. If you care for me at all, make a place for yourself at the firm and pretend that I\u2019m dead to you for a few years. After that, go study overseas. That\u2019s how you and I will survive. Learn well from Attorney Kang and take what you can from him. His mind is a treasure trove that you can\u2019t buy with money. He also knows more of Soohan\u2019s secrets than anyone else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you chose Senior Attorney Kang?\u201d\u201cEven that aside, Sehun Kang is the best person to protect you.\u201dIf that was the reason, Yoonshin couldn\u2019t comprehend her thought process. \u201cWhy would that person protect me?! There\u2019s nothing to call a relationship between us. There\u2019s no way that would happen.\u201d\u201cOf course he wouldn\u2019t actively try to protect you! But you know, Yoonshin, nobody does that. Even so, Sehun Kang will not dismiss you or put you at a disadvantage because of a third party\u2019s opinion. He\u2019ll simply act according to his standards. And in my judgment, he\u2019s the only person in the practice who can do that. You\u2019re good at what you do. Just prove that you\u2019re worth it. No, I hope you truly do, for my sake.\u201dThere was nothing he could say in reply to her words. Her judgment of Sehun was the same as his.Sehun wouldn\u2019t try to protect Yoonshin. He had no reason to. However, he was very competitive and had strong self-assurance\u2014so when external pressures started to mount, he could be the only person who could throw a wrench in those efforts. Yoonshin pleaded in a trembling voice, \u201cIkyung, I\u2019ll help you. I\u2019m a lawyer. If you can\u2019t settle, go through mediation\u2014I can get you a lot of alimony if he\u2019s a spouse at fault. You don\u2019t need to go as far as litigation. I can prepare well for you.\u201d\u201cThe opponent is Soohan. Do you know how many employees are in their legal department? They\u2019re all former judges and prosecutors, and each individual\u2019s experience is more than a decade. Plus, their network is wide. Whatever judge sits at my divorce hearing, they will have a colleague at Soohan. What can you do against those people? It\u2019s a piece of cake for Soohan to crush a baby lawyer like you. I lived as a part of Soohan for 10 years, so I know this the best. Don\u2019t you get how I feel?\u201d\u201cThen what about you?!\u201d\u201cThis is my problem. I got married, and this matter is about my family. You have no say in this. Got it?\u201dHis sister drew the line, yet he couldn\u2019t protest, which pained him. She knowingly added, \u201cJust live your life. Live comfortably doing something academic in your later years. I\u2019m thinking of asking for a professor position for you at your alma mater as one of my conditions of alimony.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need any of that! I just want you to be safe. Physical abuse only gets worse. This isn\u2019t my opinion but statistics. You have to end it quickly when he\u2019s willing to settle, all right? Please?\u201dDespite his pleas, Ikyung was firm. \u201cI need to do this. I\u2019m saying this again\u2014don\u2019t try to butt in. This isn\u2019t a warning; it\u2019s a declaration. If you interfere by doing something useless, I won\u2019t see you ever again. I have to protect my children, but if I also have to protect you, my fight will become more difficult. Please don\u2019t make my situation worse.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say a word to anyone. Got it? Yoonshin, whatever I do, you know nothing about it. This is solely my business, and you have nothing to do with it. You should listen to your sister. You\u2019ll do that for me, right? Please, I\u2019m asking you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to ask why she never told him in the first place. However, Ikyung\u2019s considerate thoughts hurt Yoonshin even more.In a way, Sehun\u2019s philosophy was correct. The more one had to protect, the more disadvantages they had on the battlefield\u2014just like his sister now. While doing more than she needed to protect Yoonshin and her kids, she considered all her possibilities and chose the path to take.Yoonshin\u2019s face was dark with chaos and denial. Ikyung examined his face with heartbroken eyes and hugged her brother\u2019s thin frame. They exchanged warmth to comfort each other\u2019s anxious hearts for a few moments.His sister spoke up first to mark the end of the silence. \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. I\u2019m our father\u2019s daughter. I will win. It\u2019ll just take a bit of time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be off now.\u201d\u201cIkyung, don\u2019t go.\u201d Yoonshin held onto her hand as she pushed his shoulders away, but that was all. Ikyung patted his arm and got back in the car. The car quietly went on its way and slowly disappeared from his sight. Yoonshin stood vacantly where he was left behind. Glancing between the empty spot where his sister stood and the position where he stood, he let out a very deep and heavy sigh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - PiquedHe was so shocked that he only now vividly felt the repressed flood of emotions that filled him to the brim. His throat tightened, and soon his eyes felt hot. His pale and bewildered face fell. \u201cWhat in the world is going on?\u201dWho first used the phrase \u201chit with a bolt out of the blue\u201d?Yoonshin was feeling just that.He didn\u2019t feel this empty inside when his father passed away. It was the saddest moment he had experienced, but he didn\u2019t feel this powerless back then. Nearly half of his father\u2019s life was spent helping people who were struggling to survive. It felt fitting that he died while doing righteous deeds. However, his sister wasn\u2019t like that. She was someone who should live happily, yet she was falling into a bottomless pit, and there was nothing he could do.By collecting evidence, it probably meant she was collecting the traces of abuse like what he saw just now. His brother-in-law was having an extramarital affair or some other despicable act. If his brother-in-law already brought up divorce, then they probably already fell out of love. Yoonshin didn\u2019t know when the conflict started, but considering his sister\u2019s tendency to mull over her decisions, it didn\u2019t seem like it was a recent change.He had seen his sister\u2019s face around every two months. So far, it had never once occurred to him that she would be experiencing such things. He never saw any visible scars before. But he saw them today.This most likely meant that his brother-in-law was growing more violent by the day. From the invisible to the visible, his sister said that she would endure that. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t gauge the strength of her resolve.\u2018Just when did it start?\u2019\u00a0The tears that clung to his eyes rolled down his cheek. The stream that started to flow silently surged and drenched his cheeks. His legs trembled in sadness and defeat.Naturally, he slumped down. He pressed his forehead into his knees.The crisp but refreshing night breeze now stung him like daggers.\u201cWhat do you want me to do when you tie my hands and tell me to ignore it\u2026?\u201d Yoonshin buried his head and fought back his tears in a corner of the sidewalk. The chilly air circled him, remained for a moment, then blew away elsewhere.All the while, there was a luxurious sedan black as night, loitering a few meters behind.The man in the car extended and rested his arms on the steering wheel. He propped his clean-shaven chin on his arms, observing Yoonshin\u2019s sorry back for a long time. The voice that seeped out of his well-shaped lips was like the low tide. \u201cWhat an interesting picture.\u201dA woman shoved an envelope in a man\u2019s arms, leaving behind the crying man.The man whose deep and dark eyes were fixed on the outside was Sehun, who just got off work.As he was driving at the entrance, he spotted a man and a woman arguing in a narrow road to the side. He was going to ignore it at first, but the man looked familiar. He parked at a safe distance and started to watch the fight. Then, the woman left first, and the man was left alone.For a short while longer, Sehun watched Yoonshin, who was crying and unable to move, then sat back up. He took out his phone from his inner jacket pocket. It was just past midnight. Then, he called Secretary Tak, who picked up immediately despite the late hour. \u201cYes, sir. Did your meeting end well?\u201d\u201cSecretary Tak, I\u2019ll send you the details in a message. You\u2019ll need to look into a vehicle,\u201d Sehun said, getting to the point.\u201cA vehicle? Right now? Is this urgent?\u201d\u201cJust let me know in due time. I already have a hunch on who it is, but I just thought it would be better to be clear.\u201d\u201cThis is related to the case you\u2019re working on, right? I\u2019ll note it down, just in case. Which file\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo need to. It\u2019s just personal curiosity.\u201dThere was no answer for a moment, then the other man asked, \u201cPersonal curiosity? What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d\u201cI think this is the first time you\u2019re asking me something of this nature, and I\u2019m more shocked than I thought I would be. Is it a woman?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so interested in my business. I told you already. You\u2019re not my type.\u201d\u201cAnd I told you I\u2019m not gay. You know it\u2019s weirder that you react so defensively, right?\u201d\u201cTomorrow morning, before work.\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019ll call you. Sweet dreams,\u201d Secretary Tak replied.Sehun grunted carelessly and hung up. Then, he continued to watch Yoonshin, who was crouching in the corner of the street.The way Yoonshin curled up into a ball while clutching the envelope tightly with one hand was quite a pitiful sight. The bright and confident image he usually projected was gone without a trace. Inevitably, a very old memory of a certain day overlapped with this image.A very long time ago, Sehun had seen Yoonshin, who was around 20 at the time, cry just like this. It was at Professor Do\u2019s funeral.Back then, Yoonshin had also crouched in a corner of a hallway at the funeral home while sobbing. Then, he grabbed the hem of Sehun\u2019s jacket, who was practically a stranger. Sehun had already offered incense, so he was going to brush the other off to leave, but the hand clutched his jacket so tightly that his knuckles were white. Yoonshin managed to say in his shaking voice,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but could you stay with me for a moment? I don\u2019t think I can stay here alone.\u201dIt looked like Yoonshin wanted to stay next to someone and cry all he wanted, but he didn\u2019t want people he knew to see him like that.Even now, Sehun couldn\u2019t understand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - PiquedSehun had believed that he could skillfully deal with any situation that he was met with despite never having seen it before. But back then, for some reason, he couldn\u2019t push away the hand that reached out for him.After a moment\u2019s deliberation, Sehun leaned against the wall and stood next to Yoonshin briefly. Neither said a word. After Yoonshin shook away the last drops of his tears, he thanked him, bowed respectfully, and walked into the cafeteria next to the memorial altar. He greeted the other visitors with a smile on his white face and conversed with the elderly who came to the funeral house alone. Sehun turned around after watching the inner strength under the grief.Sehun didn\u2019t know Yoonshin\u2019s name until after a few years had passed. He knew that Yoonshin was the son of Professor Do, so if he wanted to, he could have easily found out\u2014yet Sehun didn\u2019t do so. He felt like the memory of that day when he stood by a stranger, which was unlike himself, would repeatedly resurface.People said that the first attachment was the scariest. Sehun wondered if that applied to cases like these.Moreover, Sehun disliked caring for another person very, very much.\u201cHe\u2019s crying alone again.\u201d He clicked his tongue but couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Yoonshin. His eyes grew fierce and sharp like a bird of prey.Act 07His phone vibrated.Sehun, who was tying his necktie in front of the mirror of his dressing room, turned to the origin of the sound. His phone, sitting atop a shelf, was vibrating.Looking at the screen, it was Secretary Tak. He finished straightening out his clothes and picked up the call.\u201cIt\u2019s Secretary Tak,\u201d the other man on the line said.\u201cWhich one is it?\u201d Even though Sehun went straight to the point without any form of greeting, Secretary Tak wasn\u2019t shaken. There was a click of a device before the secretary continued, \u201cIt was a vehicle registered under Soohan Group. The true owner is the secretary of the second son\u2019s wife\u2014the one working under Director Ikyung Do. Apparently, the car is used when she moves around privately.\u201dIt was as he expected. Yoonshin ended up pouring tears at the end of the conversation, so the other person had to be someone who could elicit such a reaction. Based on what Sehun had read from the report about his relationships, his sister seemed to be the most likely subject.With women, unless they were extremely tall, it was difficult to differentiate between them solely based on their silhouette. Just in case it was a girlfriend, Sehun wanted to confirm. He already had a hunch that it was Ikyung in the first place. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cYou only asked to find the registration, so that\u2019s as far as I looked into it,\u201d Secretary Tak replied.\u201cYou said it was shocking and weird yesterday. Knowing you, you wouldn\u2019t have just looked past this. Plus, you had enough time between then and this morning.\u201d\u201cThe other party is Soohan. If I wanted to find out more, it would cost a lot. You should formally put in a request to the firm or use your private investigators.\u201d\u201cYou would\u2019ve snagged something that costs less in time and money.\u201dSehun must have hit the mark because Secretary Tak was wordless for a moment. Then, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to find out, but when I was asked the investigation unit to look into Attorney Do\u2019s surroundings, I picked up something about Soohan\u2019s second wife.\u201d\u201cIs this something on the report that you gave me?\u201d\u201cNo. Apparently, her public appearances are very irregular these days. She used to attend the group\u2019s events quite regularly, but she\u2019s been missing those often. She also used to go to her art gallery every day, but she\u2019s been missing work frequently.\u201d\u201cIs this related to Yoonshin Do?\u201d Sehun asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. If it had anything to do with Attorney Do, it would have probably been a part of the report from the investigation unit.\u201dWas it just his sister\u2019s personal affairs? With that in mind, it made sense that Yoonshin reacted so severely when he learned of it.Sehun mused, leaning against the counter with one arm. He was silent for a moment. Secretary Tak then added, \u201cWhat should I do? Should I request further investigation at the firm?\u201d\u201cNo, good work. See you in 30 minutes.\u201d\u201cYes, sir, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dAfter hanging up, Sehun was expressionless. He recalled the scene he witnessed last night and fell into deep thought. Everything else aside, his sister showing up and personally giving Yoonshin a document was suspicious. There was a high chance that something happened in their family that needed to be managed through documents.But one thing bothered him. For it to be a simple documentary exchange, Yoonshin\u2019s reaction was too abnormal.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a power of attorney,\u201d Sehun muttered to himself. He checked his watch and put on his jacket. Following that, he grabbed his briefcase and car keys and left his dressing room.His train of thought continued as he waited for the elevator.Whatever happened to the siblings didn\u2019t seem like a simple case. Yesterday, Yoonshin cried just like when his father passed away. Sehun was certain that something as shocking as a family member\u2019s death hit Yoonshin.\u2018So annoying.\u2019\u00a0He was irritated at himself for continuing to think about Yoonshin. He reached for the back of his neck with his rather large hands. As he massaged the muscles of his neck, the mouth of the elevator opened.The numbers on the elevator display decreased quickly.He soon reached the lobby of the parking garage and slipped out of the glass middle door. At that moment, a familiar face popped out of the entrance of Building C \u2014Yoonshin.Sehun stopped in his tracks and glared at Yoonshin.Eyes puffy, Yoonshin barely managed to put a smile on his face, just like back then.\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, huh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - On My MindSehun spoke snarkily. For some reason, Yoonshin\u2019s smile got on his nerves.Yoonshin reacted straightaway, \u201cThen should I cry first thing in the morning?\u201d\u201cGreetings first. Who do you think you are, being so rude?\u201d\u201cOh, right. I\u2019m sorry. Good morning, Senior Attorney. How are you today?\u201d Seeing the younger man rushing to greet him made his insides twist even more. Somehow, the aversion for that face bubbled up from the pit of his stomach. He bit his lower lip irritably and resumed walking.As they made their way to the shared parking lot, the glass wall reflected the image of the two men. \u00a0Glancing at Yooshin, Sehun knitted his brow.He wasn\u2019t planning on asking, but his lips moved without thinking. \u201cWhy\u2019s your face so swollen?\u201dThe question was unexpected, and Yoonshin turned his head slightly to peek at Sehun. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d\u201cI asked first.\u201d\u201cI was hungry so I ate some ramyun before I went to bed.\u201d\u201cDoes your face get this swollen from eating ramyun? You should try to improve your health then. How about swimming? It helps with your blood circulation.\u201d\u201cEvery day, I go between my house, the firm, my house, the firm like a zombie. How can I find time for exercise? This only happens occasionally if my body is in bad condition.\u201dSince he knew what happened, Sehun scoffed at the sloppy lie being told without so much as a blink of an eye.\u201cSeeing puffy eyes makes me sleepy. Don\u2019t come to work with puffy eyes again, or else.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019ll try not to.\u201d After glancing one last time at Sehun, Yoonshin didn\u2019t try to talk back anymore. Instead, Yoonshin seemed genuinely concerned about how bloated he was and checked his face through the reflection of the glass. The two men continued to walk in long strides. Silence hung between them.Since Yoonshin took a cab home, one of his cars was still at the firm. He had a backup car, but then he would have to park both cars at work, and his future trips to and from work wouldn\u2019t be very efficient. After peeking at Sehun who was walking ahead of him, Yoonshin swerved away from the direction of his other car and chased after his supervisor.\u201cUm, Senior Attorney, could you give me a ride?\u201dSehun stopped mid-step and turned around. He looked nonplussed, unable to understand the situation. The saturation of disbelief in his eyes was like a flash flood during monsoon season. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLast night, I took the cab because I thought I would fall asleep at the wheel. But if I take my other car, I would only be taking up space in the firm\u2019s parking lot, and since I ran into you this morning\u2026\u201dSehun cut Yoonshin off. \u201cThen call another taxi or take the public transit. Or you can call the firm and ask them to send a car. There are many options. Do I need to tell you this? Are you a toddler?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2014\u201d Yoonshin instinctively was about to protest but closed his mouth. Sehun walked over to Yoonshin, closing the distance between the two swiftly. Yoonshin wanted to find an escape route, but they were already half a meter away from each other.\u201cFinish your sentence.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so stingy.\u201d\u2018What\u2019s with this guy?\u2019\u00a0Sehun\u2019s long eyes seemed to ask. To confirm Yoonshin\u2019s suspicion, Sehun let out a long sigh.It was the first time Sehun met an associate lawyer like Yoonshin. A junior who grabbed a partner going to work to ask for a ride\u2014Sehun had never heard of such a thing before. Even Sehun, who had people call him cocky behind his back, wasn\u2019t at this level. He never chased after a partner lawyer and bothered them, let alone talk to some of them. \u201cReally, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met a guy like you. Don\u2019t you know I practically control your employment?\u201d\u201cI know. Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know this, but if I truly don\u2019t want to see someone\u2019s face, I fire them. You don\u2019t listen to the rumors?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. I have a lot of experience in wrongful dismissal hearings.\u201d\u201cThen what am I, a cardiac surgeon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not asking for a free ride. You drive yourself to and from work, right? I can drive you.\u201dThey were at the peak of the argument. In a subdued voice, Sehun explained, trying to persuade Yoonshin, \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t use a chauffeur when I go to work, unlike the other partners, is because I don\u2019t want anyone to interrupt my time. It takes 15 minutes one way for a total of 30 minutes every day\u2014that\u2019s my personal time.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I just stay quiet on the way? I just felt relieved when I saw a familiar face after being alone all night.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s words threw Sehun\u2019s head into turmoil, and he suddenly pressed his lips together. Yoonshin silently observed the other.When Yoonshin saw Sehun\u2019s well-groomed, handsome appearance that morning, he was a bit shaken. So instead of greeting him, he simply smiled and stared at him.Yoonshin didn\u2019t quite understand why he felt so relieved after seeing Sehun. For some weird reason, Sehun felt like the first line of safety in his zone of security. If anyone heard his thoughts, they would laugh that he was chasing shadows.\u201cWould that be possible?\u201dStaring down at Yoonshin, Sehun asked, \u201cI\u2019m asking because I can\u2019t seem to remember. Have I ever borrowed money from you or ripped you off?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cHave I ever made a huge mistake to your father that I didn\u2019t know about?\u201d\u201cDid you? My father would have forgiven it anyway.\u201d\u201cDid I ever reject your sister in her youth? I don\u2019t remember it, but it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\u201cWhatever happened between you and my sister, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cRight. I don\u2019t have any debts to you, so I have no reason to give you a ride.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - On My MindYoonshin was shocked at how he was swept up by Sehun\u2019s skillful rejection and fell silent. Instead, he looked up at the grinning Sehun with his puffy face. The other frowned slightly, but he soon turned his back on Yoonshin without another word.The older man\u2019s slim and tall frame walked up to his car. Sehun got in his luxurious sedan and drove out of the parking lot without looking back.\u201cAttorney Kang!\u201d Yoonshin reflexively took one step forward to chase the car, then gave up. Following someone who concisely expressed his disapproval was no different from stalking. Yoonshin thought they were getting closer, although by a modicum, but Sehun must not have thought the same. Maybe Yoonshin stepped slightly over his bounds to his senior.Sehun didn\u2019t know that Yoonshin couldn\u2019t sleep well the other night, so frankly speaking, he had no reason to be considerate. Even if he did know, there was no guarantee that he would be that understanding.\u201cYeah, go on then. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have friends. I was dumb for trying to appeal to him.\u201d Yoonshin stood staring at where Sehun\u2019s car used to be, then slowly turned around. He was slowly starting to run late, so he walked toward his car. As he was walking past a pillar, a familiar car came back inside, stopping him in his tracks.Unless his eyes suddenly turned bad, that car was Sehun\u2019s.Sehun honked at the surprised Yoonshin and stopped his car nearby. Not only that, Sehun stepped out of his car, looking very irritated, and glared at Yoonshin, who stood a few meters to the side.Yoonshin was bewildered. \u201cDid you leave something at home?\u201dSehun jutted his chin at the passenger seat, looking extremely displeased.\u201cGet in.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI said, get in. Don\u2019t make me repeat myself. Get in before I change my mind.\u201dYoonshin didn\u2019t know what caused this change of heart, but he decided to hurry. He tactfully got in the passenger seat and fastened his seatbelt, and Sehun returned to his seat as well.Confused, Yoonshin kept glancing at Sehun. The older lawyer must have felt uncomfortable because he jerked his head at the younger man, telling him to talk. Yoonshin took the bait immediately. \u201cWhy did you come back? I thought you would just leave.\u201d\u201cYeah, I thought I would do that too.\u201d Sehun sounded surprised at himself. Just as he did before, Sehun looked like he also didn\u2019t understand his own actions, which were unlike himself, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t press on. He quietly sat in the passenger seat and watched the other drive with skillful control.When Yoonshin thought about it, it was probably the first time Sehun did something like this, as Sehun mentioned. While working at Doguk, Yoonshin could feel from time to time how extraordinary his conditions were when he was recruited to the firm.Associates aside, even the partners with more years of experience found Sehun difficult. Sehun was the billboard of Doguk and accepted this attitude like it was a given. Yoonshin was told to assist Sehun as a team member by Attorney Song, but even so, using the room across as just another junior was against the unspoken hierarchy and culture of the firm.\u201cI could have driven you.\u201d\u201cTouch as little as possible in my car. I don\u2019t like when other people\u2019s fingerprints get on my stuff.\u201dYoonshin immediately folded his hand on top of his briefcase which he meekly placed over his lap. \u201cIt must be the first time you\u2019re behind the wheel with an associate as your passenger. You\u2019re experiencing something new today.\u201d\u201cYou keep forgetting what I told you. That\u2019s not a good habit.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ll keep quiet.\u201d\u201cSay one more word and I\u2019ll kick you out in the middle of the road.\u201dIntuitively knowing that Sehun would keep his word, Yoonshin pressed his lips in a line and gazed at the other man. Unable to stand it any longer, Sehun whipped his head around while at a stoplight. Their eyes met. The older man glared daggers at Yoonshin\u2019s pale face.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to keep your eyes to yourself? Your puffy eyelids look so miserable that I hate it.\u201d\u201cDo I look that miserable?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an invention called a mirror. It was created for people like you to use.\u201dYoonshin took out his cellphone and examined his face through his camera.The reddened eye rims and swollen eyelids were that of a person who spent a sleepless night. Considering how perceptive Sehun was, even if he didn\u2019t know Yoonshin\u2019s exact situation, he would immediately realize that the younger man had cried. Oddly enough, this theory explained why Sehun came back for him.How very odd.Yoonshin couldn\u2019t call Sehun Kang a good person even if there was a knife at his throat. He could readily call him the opposite. Sehun was generally rude, arrogant, vicious, and heartless. But this man, who could sit across from another while calculating his next move, wasn\u2019t bad to Yoonshin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Double-Edged SwordYoonshin didn\u2019t find Sehun particularly difficult or scary. It wasn\u2019t because Yoonshin had nothing to lose. It was the opposite since he needed to stay at Doguk for the time being. Yoonshin could act as he did entirely because of Sehun.Sehun was surprisingly patient and had good judgment since Yoonshin entered the firm, at the first test, when asking for advice on the pro bono file, and to now.He was very level-headed, but he also left room for Yoonshin to breathe. When Yoonshin put in a lot of effort, Sehun didn\u2019t ignore the efforts and recognized them. Instead of only coldly criticizing his mistakes, he also taught him how to fix them. Sehun was always annoyed, but he was attentive.It seemed easy enough to do on the surface, but this was a difficult feat for Sehun, who was practically billable by the minute.Yoonshin could start to see why his sister chose Sehun to be his guardian.\u201cMost big law firms probably wouldn\u2019t take my case.\u201d\u00a0Her composed and resigned tone from last night replayed in his head, and he swallowed dryly.\u00a0\u2018If Sehun Kang took the case, then wouldn\u2019t my sister have a chance too? It\u2019s Sehun Kang, of all people.\u2019Ikyung couldn\u2019t trust her brother with her case, but maybe she could rely on Sehun if he willingly stepped forth. However, persuading Sehun in the first place would be difficult. The opposing party was a corporate giant, and she was bound to get hurt in the process. A highly reputable and well-earning lawyer didn\u2019t need to throw himself into that impending pandemonium.Moreover, Sehun didn\u2019t take on family law cases and other relatively small cases. There had to be something that appealed to him for him to throw himself at it.\u2018Is there no way at all? How can I convince him to represent Ikyung?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin fidgeted his fingers. He started wanting something from Sehun, so he couldn\u2019t bring himself to glance at the older man anymore. Left with no other choice, Yoonshin turned to look outside the window. He watched the leaves waltz away in the wind and filled his vision with the view of the morning hustle.* * *Yoonshin peered at the laptop screen sincerely.The memory card he had received from Sehun regarding the pro bono case was a gold mine, so to speak. However, some areas looked more like landmines designed to guard the pots of gold, so he couldn\u2019t help but tread carefully.Starting with easy money from their business partners to a plethora of various derelictions of duty, tax evasion, laundering funds, and illicit solicitation\u2014there was an overwhelming amount of evidence. Not only was there business-related corruption, but there were also a lot of unspeakably scandalous incidents related to the family. If Yoonshin spread any of these to shake up the opposing party, this would become a huge scandal.\u201cDefrauding an auction using his young daughter\u2026 And various other things. It\u2019s amazing he never got caught.\u201dGiven his track record, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this wasn\u2019t the opposing party\u2019s first s*xual crime. The level of sophistication that was revealed when they traced back the destruction of evidence confirmed that fact. Yoonshin gave the man\u2019s photo a scornful look before flipping to the next page, which listed various counts of the man\u2019s abuse of authority.\u201cBribery of a high-level official\u2026 gift cards, golf clubs, resort passes\u2026 Delivery of paintings and precious gems through his wife. It\u2019s in the millions. After these funds were passed on\u2026 The leader of the ruling party, a long-serving opposition assemblyman, and a minister currently in office,\u201d Yoonshin mumbled to himself.Each link hooked onto each other like a chain, and as he continued to read, faces that he had never imagined seeing popped up like moles in a whack-a-mole game. From assemblymen so well-known that Yoonshin knew their names to party leaders\u2014they were all there. With this information alone, he could cause an uproar in Korea.Yoonshin wondered if he should just hand this over to the police.Yoonshin drew a circle in the air like he was circling the faces of familiar politicians and rubbed his chin. This information was indeed a gold mine, but the scale was growing out of proportion. Besides, Sehun didn\u2019t give this info for Yoonshin to release it to the public like some hero of justice, but to use it as a sword to earn something for his client. Sehun\u2019s warning to use this dangerous material carefully was proof of that. On that note, no matter how hard Yoonshin thought about it, it seemed too dangerous to nose about in the world of politics.Besides, it wasn\u2019t like people didn\u2019t spread this because they didn\u2019t know. It just showed that political and financial cartels were deep-rooted. The company of the opposing party wasn\u2019t a large corporation. Such a sound mid-sized company was involved with this many people of power; a larger company like Soohan would have even more.\u201cWhile he\u2019s at it, he must want to watch how you use it.\u201d\u00a0Mulling over the hint from Attorney Song, he tried to envision Sehun\u2019s method. Sehun had a major in duress, but his minor was in conciliation\u2014that was how skilled the older lawyer was at negotiation. He must have used that skill effectively to arrive at a settlement instead of litigation in the several cases he handled. It wasn\u2019t simply a matter of winning; Sehun would have tried to earn a benefit during the process of negotiation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Double-Edged Sword - WordExcerptDeep in thought, Yoonshin decided to call his client first. She picked up after the phone rang three times. Yoonshin cut to the chase and said, \u201cI\u2019m Attorney Yoonshin Do from Doguk who called you last time.\u201d\u201cYes, I know. What made you call today? If it\u2019s important, should I go to the firm like the first meeting?\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to. Are you at home by any chance?\u201d\u201cRight now? I am, but\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat. I\u2019m going to send you a document by courier right now. If you could confirm what you can, return it. Then I was hoping to plan a strategy from there.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of document is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about corruption at your company. I was thinking of negotiating a settlement using it. Of course, upon your consent.\u201dThe woman didn\u2019t seem to quite understand Yoonshin. \u201cSettlement? I\u2019m not a whistleblower. I just want a legal affirmation of what happened to me. I want to return to work instead of being indefinitely suspended. Last time, you said you were almost done tracking the president\u2019s trail of evidence destruction.\u201d\u201cThis might sound cold, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to get back at the president as well as you hope to, based on the limits to our country\u2019s laws. I considered how a lawsuit would go and concluded that, despite the other side obstructing justice, his sentence will still be disproportionately low because this will be his first offense on paper.\u201d\u201cI heard that sexual assault for a first-time offender once got a jail sentence. The lawyer who helped me file the suit said so,\u201d the client said.\u201cThat\u2019s only when you have clear-cut evidence. But the law that prescribes that isn\u2019t very reliable. This is a matter of which path you choose\u2014you make him miserable for a short time or receive compensation in a different form.\u201dAbove all, if the matter closed without scratching the other party at all, it was highly likely that the other party would strike back in a bigger and more covert way before the client could even react. This was possible because the woman was already a heretic in her industry.There was no way for Yoonshin to help after the matter was closed. He couldn\u2019t clean up after this case forever. As Yoonshin deliberated over how to explain this in a rounded manner, the woman said, more agitated than before, \u201cI testified consistently and precisely explained the situation. Are you trying to get me monetary compensation because my statement isn\u2019t good enough to prove my injury? Is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d\u201cPaying for your damages is implicitly acknowledging the crime. Going through with settlement doesn\u2019t nullify your injury,\u201d Yoonshin replied calmly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you\u2019re too lazy to do the hearing because I can\u2019t even pay the retainer?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m not bothered by that at all. This case is important to me too.\u201d\u201cThen you should punish that man. I thought you were a nice person, but how could you stab me in the back like this? I thought I met a good lawyer this time\u2026\u201d The dwindling voice of the client conveyed her anger and sorrow. Yoonshin squeezed his eyes shut and genuinely thought about what he should do.He then said, \u201cIf you truly wish to go through with litigation, I can do that. However, you told me you wanted to go back to work. You want to do that because you\u2019re innocent, and you want to prove it. I\u2019m simply telling you that you can do that in a different way.\u201d\u201cJust how much are you saying you can get me? Like in the ten thousands?\u201d\u201cI can get you more than that. Not just compensation, but I could even get you a public apology.\u201dThe client didn\u2019t seem to process this as she fell silent. Her heavy breathing evened out, and Yoonshin could hear her calming down. She was probably thinking over his words as she caught her breath. Then she snapped sharply, unable to fully grasp his words, \u201cThe law is too weak to punish him properly, but he\u2019ll give me a lot of money and apologize? That doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you. The law can\u2019t reach him, but the document I\u2019ll be sending you can do that, but only if you are willing to help. Could you look over it at least once?\u201dThe client finally seemed to regain her cool and understood the pith of Yoonshin\u2019s words. As if recounting the conversation when they first started the call, she mumbled to herself inaudibly. Yonshin waited patiently instead of pressing her on.Not long after, she spoke up. \u201cWhat if I wanted to go through with the trial after I looked over your proposal enough times?\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll proceed with the trial.\u201d Yoonshin would clearly get failing grades from Sehun if he didn\u2019t use the documents. But if this was the client\u2019s ultimate instructions, Yoonshin couldn\u2019t help it. Yoonshin quietly stared at the windows on his computer screen.The other person on the line asked in a much more composed tone than before, \u201cCan I trust you?\u201dThankfully, she was trying to understand Yoonshin, who was genuinely thinking about her best interests. He held back his sigh and replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to force yourself. It\u2019s my job to earn your trust.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for lashing out earlier. I just felt so upset.\u201d\u201cI understand. It\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cYou wanted me to look over the parts that I know about in the document you\u2019ll send me, right?\u201d\u201cYes, and after I organize the facts, let\u2019s brainstorm together about what we can get and how much you want to get from the opposing party. Oh, you have to receive the document personally and return it through the courier that I send, okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Thank you.\u201d\u201cThen, take care.\u201d After hanging up, Yoonshin rang up Secretary Tak. He asked to send the documents, which he prepared in advance, to the client, then he saw the secretary off. Secretary Tak waved his hand reassuringly, and Yoonshin could lean back comfortably in his chair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Break and Enter - WordExcerptYoonshin let out a deep sigh, and in place of the air that left, useless thoughts started to flood in. He stared at the screen, eyes brimming with apprehension. He couldn\u2019t imagine how such crippling information could be obtained in such a short time. The one thing he was sure of was that it wasn\u2019t the work of one person.Sehun always held the reins to these kinds of things\u2014things that could completely bury one person alive.\u2018My brother-in-law probably has more flaws than this,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought.Soohan Group wasn\u2019t the most transparent with their business operations. He could intuit that Soohan Holdings, which his brother-in-law operated, was the same. Yoonshin recalled that was partly why the adults of that family were so assertive and open to becoming in-laws with Yoonshin\u2019s father, who had a clean public image.His father wasn\u2019t blind to these circumstances. He retired from all his public positions after his sister\u2019s marriage and threw himself into social justice cases at Jaeya. He probably thought that if his social influence diminished whilst his in-laws were benefiting from it, it would ultimately be a detriment to everyone.After his sister\u2019s last visit to his apartment a few days ago, he heard nothing from her. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t brave enough to leave a message either. He wanted to find a way to overcome this obstacle together. The desire to help her was brimming, but that was all.As Sehun once said, Yoonshin was good at knowing his place. He knew that if he jumped in recklessly with determination as his only saving grace, he could make his sister\u2019s situation worse, so he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do anything. Maybe he could find a way if he learned about the situation in detail, but given how defensive Ikyung was, it didn\u2019t seem like she would ever tell him the particulars.\u2018She should have still told me what exactly is going on.\u2019 \u00a0Yoonshin felt nauseated because there was nothing he could do for now. The feeling of defeat tangled with another uncomfortable feeling. He felt even more unsettled when he recalled Ikyung\u2019s messed-up face.His sister said that it would be a long fight, so there was no other way than to get a sense of the flow of the situation. For the time being, he had to work to survive at this firm.That was one step in protecting her and himself.* * *Yoonshin stepped out of the break room and stood in front of the window facing the outside.The three in the morning view was dark. It was the darkest time before it grew brighter, so it felt a bit more haunting than other hours of the night. It was quite ominous to see the earth\u2019s atmosphere stained in such a dark color. Yoonshin felt more chilled since half the offices on his floor were unoccupied.The skyscrapers in the view had handfuls of lights, glimmering much like this firm\u2019s building. He wondered why everyone was working so hard. He also wanted to know what in the world he was doing, standing here. This was the first time in his life that his situation felt so delicate and precarious.Not only did he not come here despite his wishes, but he also felt bewildered when he learned that he came here upon his sister\u2019s decision to protect him from being harmed by her husband of 10 years.\u2018Is there no possibility that Sehun Kang knew everything about this situation? What if he took me in despite knowing?\u2019Sehun was on nobody\u2019s side until the client formally signed a retainer agreement. To phrase it a different way, he could become anyone\u2019s ally at any time. And most of the time\u2014no, 100% of the time\u2014he was on the stronger side.Yoonshin shook his head at the very unlikely possibility and returned to his office. He kept having useless thoughts. Perhaps it would be better for him to drop by his home for some shut-eye. He blinked his gritty eyes as he picked up his jacket and bag from his room when he saw Sehun\u2019s office with its lights off from across the hallway.The secretary\u2019s office was \u00a0empty. Nobody was watching.At that moment, he remembered the time when Sehun gave him the \u201cdangerous\u201d documents and told him not to ask for the source. Unable to ignore this opportunity, he seized the chance and started to make his way to the partner\u2019s room.Yoonshin was overcome by the thought that it was now or never. He knew that he was about to do something bad, but he also thought this was the best he could do since Sehun would never tell him the truth. Even if the partner\u2019s words were the law and Yoonshin had to blindly follow it, he couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye without knowing about the weapon that he would use for his client. It was only right that he went as far as he could go.\u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I really am. I\u2019m really, really sorry.\u2019\u00a0He apologized three times in his heart. He turned the handle of Sehun\u2019s office and carefully went inside.He flinched at the chilly air that surrounded him in the darkened room. He rubbed his face with one hand and looked around.He turned on his phone\u2019s flashlight and saw the array of certificates of Sehun\u2019s qualifications on the wall. Next to them was a coat hanger that was around Sehun\u2019s eye level, and from it hung several spare suits and ties covered with stiff plastic.Past the wall, Yoonshin saw Sehun\u2019s bookshelf. He was overcome with a strange sense of loneliness. Other lawyers had their family photos or other personal effects to decorate their room, but Sehun had none of that. Everything was all work-related. The only thing that was out of place was\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0on the bookshelf.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Break and Enter - WordExcerpt\u201cThis place feels strangely lonely. Maybe the room takes after the owner,\u201d he mumbled to himself before he snapped back to his senses and walked over to the desk. He was hopeful that he could salvage something related to the source of the dangerous information. Although there was no way Sehun would leave anything truly important in his office, perhaps Yoonshin could find some small hint at least.However, the desk was clean, and the drawers were all designed so that they couldn\u2019t be opened without a password. Yoonshin was astonished. \u201cI guess I had too high hopes for Sehun Kang.\u201dFeeling defeated, Yoonshin was about to leave before it was too late when he discovered a desk calendar. He temporarily set aside his original goal as his curiosity about Sehun that crowded his mind resurfaced. He sat in the other\u2019s chair and flipped through the calendar. But as expected, everything was about work.Just as he was disappointed that he didn\u2019t find anything of merit, he saw an X the size of a speck on the last page of the calendar. It was the last day of December.What was this? Was this a birthday?\u201cI need to find some sort of weakness so I can beg him to please help me.\u201d Yoonshin tilted his head then put down the calendar. He was about to turn the flashlight off, but he then realized that his desk was visible from Sehun\u2019s room\u2014since he could see Sehun\u2019s desk from his desk, he should have known the inverse was true. Yet Yoonshin had never considered this because the other man\u2019s room was covered in blinds more days than not.He wondered if Sehun watched him occasionally.He extended his hand into the light and cast a shadow, pretending Sehun was patting Yoonshin\u2019s head. Then, realizing that he was imagining something ridiculous, he bolted up from the seat.\u201cReally, what am I doing?\u201d His ears turned pink. He decided to end his adventure and leave the office for real when he spotted a thick object between a gap in the documents next to Sehun\u2019s laptop. It was the only thing that stood out, so his eyes naturally fell on it. He pushed his index finger in and something smooth touched his fingertips. As he carefully pulled it out with the traction of his fingers, he discovered that it was a file folder. Its contents were familiar.\u2018Why is this\u2026?\u2019\u00a0They were copies of some of the documents that he asked Secretary Tak to retain the originals of earlier the other morning. He saw the main points which he underlined with a pen after reading the documents thoroughly.Yoonshin couldn\u2019t be sure since this case was something that Sehun gave him to begin with, but since before, Sehun seemed to know a lot more details about the case than Yoonshin expected. This was Sehun Kang he was talking about, the ace of Doguk who didn\u2019t do any pro bono work. Yoonshin found it a bit suspicious that Sehun had already read the documents that just another associate prepared on the day of.\u201cWhat do you think Soohan would want from me if I touched you? I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\u2018But I think you\u2019re interested in me\u2026\u2019\u00a0He cooled his warm cheeks with the back of his hand. Glancing at the volume of\u00a0Great Expectations,\u00a0he put the file folder back in its place.Following that, he quickly closed the door to the office and left.The door closed with a click.At that moment, the motion sensor above the door blinked with a red light then vanished.Act 08Upon coming back to work after the weekend, the first thing Sehun did was turn on his laptop. After that, he asked Secretary Tak for a cup of coffee. \u00a0As he was pulling out files from his briefcase, he was met with a screen that was different from usual.Sehun\u2019s office had a motion sensor over his door. If someone entered his room while he was away from his office, the camera would activate and start recording. Doguk was a place where any of the employees could enter his room at any time should they put their mind to it, so setting up cameras was the firm\u2019s solution to mitigate the risk of leaking sensitive information that the partners held.Sehun wasn\u2019t so careless as to leave very important information in his office, but one in a million chances still existed. They still had to keep the office clean, and he couldn\u2019t control everyone, so he agreed to install the system as a formality in the unlikely case of an intruder. This was a fact that most people at the firm knew because the other partners also consented to installing this system.\u2018Three in the morning?\u2019\u00a0There were two alarms on the bottom right corner of the screen. Normally, there was exactly one alarm around six a.m. when the custodians came to clean his room. But today was different. When his card key wasn\u2019t in the room, another person visited this office.This was the first time after it happened once last year when a custodian came back to retrieve the cleaning materials that they accidentally left behind. He quickly accessed the security program and replayed the video from three in the morning.He saw a fuzzy figure in the darkness.It was Yoonshin.Sehun scoffed in disbelief.\u201cLook at the gall of this b*stard.\u201dResolutely, Yoonshin entered Sehun\u2019s office and turned on his flashlight. Then, he looked around the office here and there. It looked like he was looking for something. Sehun turned up the volume just in case, and then he could hear footsteps and Yoonshin talking out loud to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Lenience - WordExcerpt\u201cThis place feels strangely lonely. Maybe the room takes after the owner.\u201dSehun frowned, at a loss for words. On his screen, Yoonshin held his flashlight to walk over to his desk, then flipped through his calendar. That wasn\u2019t all. He pointed his flashlight at his own room, then he extended his hand in the stream of light and had a fun time playing with shadow puppets.\u201cDoes he think my office is a playground? I went too easy on him.\u201d He gritted his teeth, about to press the button on the intercom to summon Secretary Tak.Yoonshin said in a troubled voice, making Sehun stop mid-movement, \u201cI need to find some sort of weakness so I can beg him to please help me.\u201dHe continued to stare at the screen. He watched the uninvited intruder open a file on his desk, and in a matter of minutes, he set everything back in place and left the room. Furrowing his brow to form a deep crease, Sehun continued to glower at the short video recording that had already ended. A complex look flashed by his cold eyes.Yoonshin wasn\u2019t an idiot; he should have known that there wasn\u2019t anything important enough to waltz in and steal. But the fact that he poked around meant that he had some reason to take a risk and dig around, or he used that as an excuse to grasp at straws.\u2018Help him\u2026 with what?\u2019\u00a0Sehun tapped his desk at a steady rhythm. As he mulled over the audio that was recorded with the video, the event he witnessed a few days ago near their apartment replayed like a reel of film.Sehun raised the blinds of the window facing the hallway. He could immediately see Yoonshin through his large window across the hall. He looked very busy\u2014he had the receiver of his phone in one ear, his cellphone against the other ear, and was talking animatedly while moving his hands.Shortly after, he put down the phone\u2019s receiver and continued to talk passionately into the cellphone. It didn\u2019t seem like the conversation went well. As he stood up while continuing his phone conversation, he spotted Sehun, who was staring at him from across the hall. Yoonshin silently greeted the older lawyer. Sehun didn\u2019t respond and continued to stare.Yoonshin looked a bit taken aback and grinned awkwardly. He clearly felt guilty about something. It was an obvious reaction since Yoonshin probably didn\u2019t need to lie very much. Sehun knew that very well and continued to drill holes into the other with his eyes.\u201cOf course you\u2019d feel guilty since you did something bad,\u201d Sehun\u2019s voice slipped out from between his lips, but it didn\u2019t reach Yoonshin.Yoonshin mouthed, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d and tilted his head, but Sehun simply shook his head in response. Yoonshin seemed conflicted on whether he should focus on Sehun or his call, so to tell Yoonshin to work, Sehun pulled down his blinds once again.With his vision blocked from the outside, Sehun\u2019s eyes drifted down to the figurine of Dike, the goddess of justice, on his desk. \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201dThere were two things he could do immediately. \u201cOn the left, I could ignore it for now, and on the right, I can screw him over by exposing him to the world at large.\u201dHe gnawed on his lip as he touched the moveable scale hanging on one hand of the statue. Then, as if to leave the decision to the goddess, he slightly pushed the circular plate of the scale.The scale wobbled and bounced from left to right while screeching like a top set to motion with a whip. It bobbed back and forth as if to determine which side was heavier. Despite only starting its work, it quickly lost its momentum and stopped after a few oscillations. And of all things, it tilted to the right. Sehun frowned slightly when he saw that.\u201cScrew him over.\u201d He made an ambiguous face and pushed the scales a bit harder to give it a second chance.This time again, it creaked sharply as it moved before it slowly came to a stop. However, the scale leaned to the right yet again. Sehun made a complicated face as he stared down at the scale and flicked it again.\u201cIt seems the gods aren\u2019t on your side, Yoonshin Do.\u201d Sehun knew intuitively that he shouldn\u2019t overlook the sides of Yoonshin that he wanted to hide. He felt that his own life would start twisting if he thoughtlessly interfered. It wasn\u2019t just a simple feeling but an objective judgment based on his sense of reality.However, the problem wasn\u2019t Yoonshin\u2014it was Sehun who held the power to choose in his hands. He could simply ignore the younger man, just as he ignored others so far, but for some reason, it wasn\u2019t easy.Why did his eyes keep following Yoonshin?What was so special about him?While Sehun was furrowing his brows, there was a knock at his door. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201dThe door opened cautiously at his answer. Sehun didn\u2019t look at the door and continued, \u201cCould you bring some pain meds from the infirmary? I keep having a pain in the neck these days.\u201d\u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d the man at the door asked.Sehun thought that the visitor must have been Secretary Tak, but it wasn\u2019t the case. Yoonshin, who had finished his call at some point, had the coffee that he asked from Secretary Tak in his hand. Sehun leaned back leisurely into his chair and stared silently at Yoonshin at the door. The younger man shrugged. \u201cSo, can I come in?\u201d\u201cSince when did you come in with my permission?\u201d Sehun made a pregnant remark, startling Yoonshin, cheeks turning pink. He seemed a bit ashamed on one hand, and he also looked a bit sorry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Lenience - WordExcerptKnowing the other\u2019s honest personality, Sehun had a feeling that Yoonshin wanted to apologize for coming into his room at three in the morning. But once Yoonshin was on the receiving end of Sehun\u2019s cold gaze, he seemed to be reluctant about bringing it up and squirmed. It was understandable; after all, coming into the room with no owner and spending a fair amount of time in it was quite rude. Plus, Sehun wasn\u2019t merciful.Sehun\u2019s voice, as cold as ice, hammered at Yoonshin\u2019s eardrums. \u201cIs this about work?\u201d\u201cOh, not really,\u201d Yoonshin said.\u201cThen leave that here and go.\u201dDespite the command, Yoonshin didn\u2019t look like he was going to budge. Instead, he kept trailing off his sentences. \u201cWell, Senior Attorney\u2026\u201dSehun cut him off, his voice cracking, \u201cI said, leave the cup and go. I\u2019m in no condition to listen to you. I\u2019m tired, and I\u2019m starting to get annoyed just looking at you.\u201dUpon hearing that, the younger man\u2019s pallid expression slowly turned into concern. Yoonshin\u2019s worried gaze transferred into Sehun\u2019s sense of touch and tickled his skin.\u2018Those earnest eyes will one day come back as shackles on your ankles,\u2019\u00a0Sehun\u2019s instincts whispered urgently to him.\u201cDoes your head hurt a lot? Should I go down to the infirmary to get some pain medication? It might be good to get an IV drip.\u201dThe cause of his headache was Yoonshin. However, there was no treatment for Sehun.\u201cDo you want me to repeat my words three times? Go about your way. Don\u2019t bother me.\u201d After Sehun\u2019s prickly reaction, Yoonshin quickly approached the desk and placed the coffee down. He hurriedly and politely made his way out of the room. Before he closed the door completely, he looked back worriedly, but that was all he could do since Sehun was standing his ground.The door closed with a click. Now alone, Sehun stared vacantly at the cup that Yoonshin left behind and became lost in thought. The stern and ever so slightly egotistic, dark eyes were directed on the lid. Sehun didn\u2019t look very good.Sehun\u2019s life always had a logical structure. Nothing bypassed it. From a young age, he had nothing to his name, so he had to teach himself how to survive the jungle called society. Once he tasted proper victory for the first time, it was so thrilling that he studied all the ways to win and tenaciously climbed to his position now. Everything he did had a start, end, cause, and result.But every time Yoonshin was involved, Sehun felt his logical structure blur.It was like that since the beginning. Yoonshin bothered Sehun for no particular reason. As Sehun continued to get swept away, he did things that he never had done before. He carelessly accepted the other into his territory, and now he was giving attention to another person, something which he had never done before.He gazed at the statue of the goddess and raised his index finger. He poked the scale.Creak, creak.The grating sound of metal repeated a few times. Finally, the scale ran out of energy and tilted slightly to the left. \u201cOverlook it for now\u2026\u201dSehun tapped the sword that the goddess was carrying in her other hand. Finally satisfied, he opened his files.* * *Yoonshin was talking with a guest beyond the glass walls of Conference Room A. The other person looked like legal counsel from a certain company. The other lawyer kept turning red and blue; despite not being able to hear the conversation from the outside, the tension in the air was conveyed to the people outside.Only the back of Yoonshin\u2019s head could be seen, but his attitude was \u00a0opposite to that of his guest. He sat in a composed manner, pointed to several documents, and steadfastly tried to convince the other party.Sitting at a table on the outside, Sehun meticulously watched every move.Yoonshin always put his all into everything he did. He clearly had endurance, and based on his observations, he was quite smart. Sehun couldn\u2019t stand some aspects of Yoonshin, but that could be summed up as a difference in style. Since Yoonshin was good at understanding his situation, Sehun felt like he could train the younger lawyer to fix that.\u2018Should I use him now?\u2019\u00a0He crossed his arms in deep deliberation as he continued to observe Yoonshin.Sehun felt the presence of another person at his elbows. He glanced in that direction and saw Secretary Tak holding out a mug of hot tea. Sehun took the mug and savored the scent and flavor of the drink.\u201cI was wondering what you were watching after coming out of your office so abruptly. It was Attorney Do, huh?\u201d Secretary Tak remarked.\u201cI\u2019m not watching the Fourth-year but the negotiation by the Fourth-year,\u201d Sehun replied.\u201cHow much is the information you gave Attorney Do worth?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get hurt if you know.\u201d\u201cI see it\u2019s super expensive.\u201d\u201cAnyways, mind your own business. How much did that lawyer bring to the table?\u201dSecretary Tak seated himself beside Sehun and replied earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t know the details yet. But when I briefly went to bring them tea, it seemed to be in the ten thousands. Compensation for damages, living expenses for the past few months, the expenses for the next half year for the client\u2019s re-employment preparation, and a bit of money for non-disclosure. As a side, he demanded a public apology and withdrawal of the action against the client.\u201dSehun was sipping tea while listening, then narrowed his eyes which were still fixed on Yoonshin\u2019s pale cheeks.\u201cIn the ten thousands, you say\u2026 If he only brought that much to the table despite being prodded with some very strong documents here and there, the other lawyer severely underestimated the Fourth-year.\u201d\u201cThe rumor that we recruited the in-law of Soohan Group spread across the practice. It seems like he thought that Attorney Do would be incompetent since he came in through nepotism.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Intervention - WordExcerptThe way the other man was treating Yoonshin could have hurt his pride, yet he continued to respond with composure. Amused, Sehun watched on like he was watching a very intense sports match.\u201cI wonder how much more he can grill the other guy?\u201d Sehun remarked.\u201cWhat do you think, Senior Attorney?\u201d Secretary Tak asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no limit to settlement, so it\u2019s up to how much the representative is willing to give. If Fourth-year decides to take a modest deal of ten thousand instead of turning the client\u2019s life on its head, then just send him to the litigation group without telling me. Oh, and label him a failure.\u201d\u201cThen, your bright-line test for passing?\u201d\u201cTen times.\u201dSecretary Tak turned slightly toward Sehun and chuckled lightly. \u201cThis must have been your last test. If it were you, how much would you take?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t calculated it before, so I don\u2019t know. But if I were in that room, I\u2019d browbeat the other lawyer for a couple million.\u201dUpon hearing that, the secretary flinched in surprise, which Sehun saw from the corner of his eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that shallow reaction?\u201d\u201cWhat in the world did you give him? The offer that the other party brought to the table is already several times more than the typical offer of the same crime.\u201dSehun shrugged instead of replying.\u201cWow\u2026 I thought this was a simple pro bono, but it was much bigger than I thought. No wonder you randomly took a pro bono case. You had all this information beforehand, didn\u2019t you? The familiar-looking person was the assailant in that case, right?\u201d\u201cI just happened to come across it when I was helping Senior Attorney Song with a trial a few years ago. Back then, I thought it was a card to throw away, but I never expected to use it like this. It\u2019s a bit late, but it seems like it\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d\u2018Of course,\u2019\u00a0Secretary Tak nodded as he thought. Then he suddenly asked, \u201cBut still, doesn\u2019t Attorney Do exceed your expectations?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to get at. I don\u2019t remember meeting anyone who exceeded my expectations in my life.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s good at processing whatever you throw at him. To be honest, I initially thought he wouldn\u2019t be flexible, but he was, which surprised me. He used what you gave. The secretaries all were betting whether the rigid and stubborn human rights lawyer would be too prideful to use it.\u201d\u201cDid you win?\u201d\u201cSeems like I\u2019ll get the whole pot.\u201dAfter a glance at Secretary Tak, he affixed his eyes on Yoonshin in the conference room. Secretary Tak observed Sehun\u2019s attentive profile, then he turned to look at Yoonshin, curious to know just what Sehun saw in the younger lawyer.\u201cDo you trust him or not? Seeing that you gave him the info that you got from your private investigators, you do seem to trust him, but on the other hand, giving it to him to check if he takes the shortcut seems like the opposite is true.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust or distrust him. I\u2019m simply checking if the Fourth-year has brains, whether he has an average IQ or not.\u201d\u201cHow harsh. He passed the second test easily. You should at least praise him.\u201d Most of what Secretary Tak said was correct. He made many excuses, but Sehun wanted to see whether Yoonshin would use the dangerous information from dubious sources. In his view, Yoonshin couldn\u2019t let go of his life before Doguk. Unlike other associates who did whatever it took to earn a money-making case, Yoonshin continued to be satisfied with pro bono work.So Sehun wanted to see if Yoonshin was ready to stain his blank canvas with color, or if he was saying empty words. Besides, this test was rather soft and considerate of the other person\u2019s disposition and temperament for Sehun.\u201cI practically brought the spoon to his lips. He only needed to open his mouth. Do I need to praise him for eating the food that I spoon-fed him?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s Attorney Do of all people. He was brave enough to immerse himself with our firm. If you don\u2019t praise him at all, don\u2019t you think he\u2019ll be discouraged?\u201d\u201cIf you like raising children, you can take him, sir.\u201dSecretary Tak smiled agreeably. Then, he glanced at the staff hovering behind them and lowered his voice. \u201cI always wanted to ask this, but are you interested in Attorney Do or his sister?\u201dSehun took a sip of his warm coffee and scoffed. \u201cWhat b*llshit are you saying? The former is a man, and the latter is a married woman.\u201d\u201cYou know you\u2019re acting strange these days, right? You asked me to investigate something out of personal curiosity, and you took time out of your hectic workday to watch a lawyer several years your junior. I\u2019ve never seen you be this curious about another person and caring for them. Really, why are you acting this way?\u201dSehun was indeed acting weird. He usually worked every minute of the hour. Putting his work aside and sitting out here was ridiculous, even in Sehun\u2019s opinion. That was also probably why he kept feeling the gazes of the other employees glancing at him.A few meters in front, Yoonshin was still in a heated discussion with the other party. The negotiation seemingly wasn\u2019t going so well as he turned his head to the side and sighed deeply.However, the small show of dissatisfaction by Yoonshin, who was thus far respectful, seemed to push the wrong buttons of the other side. The middle-aged man suddenly started pointing at Yoonshin angrily and huffing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Intervention - WordExcerptSecretary Tak hurriedly whispered to Sehun. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should try to calm them down? Or should I go in?\u201d\u201cStay put. That\u2019s Yoonshin Do\u2019s stage.\u201d Sehun glared at the conference room as he calmly sipped his coffee. He was adamant that he wouldn\u2019t miss a second of what was going on in that room.Secretary Tak quietly stared at the other man. He soon tilted his head when he realized that the smooth curves of the older man\u2019s profile gave off a different feeling than usual. \u201cYou reeeaaally care for him a lot.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a pain in the neck whenever I see him.\u201d Sehun\u2019s slightly off-kilter answer seemed to throw off Secretary Tak.But the secretary found his calm again and asked, \u201cWhy? Because he picked you of all people when he got hired through nepotism?\u201d\u201cRather than that, my attacks aren\u2019t effective against him. He\u2019s the first person like that, so I\u2019m not used to it.\u201dSecretary Tak didn\u2019t seem to fully comprehend that, so the silence dragged on. Sehun didn\u2019t bother to explain every little detail. He had never done so for anyone. Although, strangely, he ended up doing that frequently for Yoonshin, so he felt nonplussed about it.Throughout his life, he had met hundreds, if not thousands, of different kinds of people. He could effortlessly see through people like Yoonshin.But Yoonshin was truly weird. He was always genuine. Everything about him was real\u2014the younger man felt disappointed in Sehun, relied on Sehun, worried for him, got bothered about him, was curious about Sehun, and felt uncomfortable around him. Yoonshin was always faithful to his emotions. He didn\u2019t flatter people for no reason, and he didn\u2019t bow down to others more than needed. He said everything he wanted, yet he kept the minimal level of respect.Everything about Yoonshin was so transparent that Sehun\u2019s will to attack evaporated.Most people who Sehun met either started a fight from their very first meeting or groveled and crawled to him\u2014it was one or the other. However, Yoonshin was both yet neither. It was the first time Sehun met anyone who treated him as he was, so that perplexed him even more.Sehun also fell silent, so Secretary Tak, who seemed to have thought of something, continued his questions. \u201cDo you feel uncomfortable because he\u2019s someone you\u2019ve never dealt with before?\u201dThere was no better way to describe how Sehun was feeling right now. \u201cI think so.\u201d\u201cHonestly speaking, your face right now is exactly that of a person uncomfortable about dirtying a pure person.\u201dSehun turned to look at Secretary Tak. Sehun, who had been replying languorously, glared irritably. \u201cEveryone has an unclean side to them. What is he, a saint? Saint Do? Look, he\u2019s the same as everyone else.\u201d\u201cSee?\u201d\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d\u201cYou act defensively whenever you talk about Attorney Do. So it wasn\u2019t the married sister but the guy. How should I take this? Well, I guess I\u2019m rooting for you. It\u2019s not an easy path to walk.\u201d\u201cAre you writing a novel? What a joke\u2026\u201d Sehun retorted in annoyance. As he was about to go back to his office, just then, the lawyer in the conference room\u2014who kept expressing his anger\u2014bolted up. Yoonshin, who was conversing as composed as he could, stared up at him. He gestured to the other man\u2019s seat, politely asking him to take his seat again.That was when it happened.The middle-aged man\u2019s chunky hand reached for Yoonshin\u2019s neck. He was about to grab the younger lawyer by the collar, which the two men outside witnessed.\u201cHuh? Senior Attorney, don\u2019t we have to\u2014\u201d Before Secretary Tak could finish his sentence, Sehun slammed his mug down on the table and stood up, walking straight toward the conference room. He burst in without knocking and grabbed the wrist of the man who was shaking Yoonshin by his shirt collar.\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cA-attorney Sehun Kang?\u201dYoonshin and the other lawyer recognized Sehun at the same time. The middle-aged man flinched. As Sehun threw the other man\u2019s arm off forcefully, the man rubbed his sore wrist and seemed troubled as he tried to make an excuse. \u201cSee, this young fellow was being too cocky. He keeps grating at you while acting all polite. You know those unspoken rules in our industry, yet this junior keeps crossing the line\u2014\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why you decided to act out of line? Yoonshin Do is my associate who I taught. If you think he\u2019s being so cocky that negotiation is impossible, you can talk to me, his senior. However, that means your client will lose everything. Yoonshin is at least considerate, but I don\u2019t have that.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Senior Attorney Kang. How about we calm down first?\u201d The middle-aged man looked very troubled now that things started to go awry and glanced at Yoonshin for help. Yoonshin, who was observing so far and reading the situation, slowly stood up. He stood between the two men and faced Sehun.\u201cSenior Attorney.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m in the middle of a discussion? Don\u2019t butt in. Move.\u201d\u201cI know, but\u2026 this is my case. Please let me handle this.\u201dSehun was hit with a realization and narrowed his eyes, then he glanced outside the room. Secretary Tak lifted Sehun\u2019s mug. The man outside said nothing, but he seemed to say, \u201cYou told me to stay put since this was Attorney Do\u2019s stage, no?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Legal Outland - WordExcerptRealizing too late that he burst into the room without thinking after seeing Yoonshin being shaken by his collar, Sehun let out a hollow laugh. This had never happened in his entire life.He retorted cynically at Yoonshin, who was waiting for his answer. \u201cEven though you were getting beat up?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t get hit yet. And now that you gave a warning, it\u2019s not going to happen either. This much help is enough. I can do it.\u201dSehun made an inexplicably ambiguous face and heavily patted Yoonshin\u2019s shoulder. He seemed to bring himself together through his rough contact. Then, he glared at the other lawyer, who was anxious and at a loss for what to do. He glowered long and hard before turning around. The middle-aged man respectfully bowed, and Sehun left the conference room without looking back.Upon leaving the room, he stomped irritably to his own office. Secretary Tak wanted to follow him but stopped himself upon seeing that Sehun\u2019s face was different than usual. He could only look down at the mug left behind.Yoonshin followed Sehun out of the room. To the slim back getting further, he shouted, \u201cThank you! I\u2019ll wrap things up well. Please take care of yourself as you work. Don\u2019t get sick ag\u2014\u2026 Senior Attorney Kang!\u201dDespite being at a range where he could hear, Sehun didn\u2019t respond. He stomped away and disappeared into his room. Near the secretary office, Secretary Tak and Yoonshin exchanged looks. Secretary Tak said, \u201cDid Attorney Kang say he felt sick?\u201d\u201cIt seemed like his condition wasn\u2019t good for a few days. He said his head hurt. I don\u2019t know if he took any pain medication.\u201d\u201cDid he happen to say he had a pain in the neck?\u201d\u201cYes, and he asked for medication. Since you didn\u2019t know, he must not have taken it. Maybe he\u2019s all right then.\u201dThe secretary\u2019s friendly and sincere eyes pierced through Yoonshin. Then, he smiled kindly and shook his head, indicating that there was no need to worry. Yoonshin felt a bit relieved and asked, \u201cWell, that\u2019s that, but did he say anything about me? He seems to keep watching what I do.\u201d\u201cFor starters, I think you met his standards. You can consider what just happened as an exception.\u201d\u201cThank goodness. To be honest, that other lawyer was looking down on me because I didn\u2019t have that many years of experience, so the discussion was going nowhere. I started aggravating him slightly, and he came out like that. In any case, I think the rest will go smoothly since Senior Attorney Kang helped me. I\u2019ll try my best to the end.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve pulled a lot more out of Attorney Kang in a few months than what I\u2019ve observed in years.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly as I said. You\u2019re one type of person that he\u2019s never experienced before, so he doesn\u2019t know how to handle you very well. Really, this is so fun. Please work at our firm for a long time, okay?\u201dYoonshin met Secretary Tak\u2019s refreshed eyes before the secretary walked away without further explanation. Yoonshin tilted his head in confusion, attempting to decipher the meaning, but the secretary had already returned to his seat and resumed his work. Left standing alone in the hall, Yoonshin\u2019s eyes inevitably stopped at Sehun\u2019s office.As he pursed his lips and recounted what Sehun had said back in the room, his cheeks stained pink and twitched.\u2018My associate\u2026 who I taught?\u2019\u00a0Then, his mood quickly deflated.\u00a0\u2018A type of person he\u2019s never seen before\u2026\u2019Could it be a good thing that the two polar opposites had at least one commonality?Yoonshin also felt that Sehun was novel. Even though his eyes always chased after the other man, Yoonshin had no idea how to deal with him. He also had no idea why his mind kept straying toward the other.Maybe Sehun was the same.For the last time, Yoonshin looked at Sehun\u2019s closed door and took a few deep breaths before returning to the conference room.* * *In a meeting room of the annex, Yoonshin skimmed through the documents relating to the day\u2019s free consultation clients and fell into thought.The law regulated the baseline of ethics.That was one of the important rules of civil law that Yoonshin learned. To say it a different way, the law didn\u2019t prescribe anything more than a modicum of ethics. At times, the world presented several unfair things to people, yet there was no way to help them through civil law. Each time that happened, Yoonshin felt bad about it. This situation reflected in his consultation documents was the same.\u201cThis will probably have to go through litigation. I wonder what the family thinks about it.\u201d After he tapped at the paper with his pen, Yoonshin pressed the intercom, ending his deliberation. \u201cPlease let the next client in.\u201dNot long after, there was a knock and the door opened. Yoonshin got up slightly and gestured to the other person to sit across from him. The client was a man around his late forties to early fifties. He looked like a nice person, but his face had traces of the many troubles he faced in his life.\u201cYou came to talk about your inheritance, correct? I looked through your note. You took care of your aunt until she passed away.\u201d\u201cYes, I did. Not her children\u2014but me, her nephew. But she didn\u2019t leave a will in the end, so all her assets went to her children, who she was estranged from the very end. But I was the one who took care of her in her later years, for several years. I was wondering if I could ask for a monetary return for my contribution through a claim for a legal portion of an heir.\u201dWhere should Yoonshin start?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Legal Outland - WordExcerptThe man seemed to have picked up bits and pieces of information or found inaccurate information. Yoonshin carefully thought through his words and slowly started his explanation. \u201cHmm\u2026 Frankly speaking, contributions have nothing to do with legal portions as an heir. The \u2018legal portion\u2019 is a legislated share of the deceased\u2019s assets set aside for the heirs of an estate. This was made so that qualified heirs can get equal portions of inheritance.\u201dThe man snapped back immediately, \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not qualified? I was the one who lived with my aunt, not her children. My cousins were all busy taking care of their own family and they visited once a year at best. Don\u2019t I have a better right to receive inheritance since I contributed to her care? She also told me before that she would give me all her possessions after she passed.\u201d\u201cDo you happen to have any evidence of that in her handwriting or in her voice?\u201d\u201cHow could I ask a sick person to do that? It was all oral\u2026\u201dYoonshin felt for the man and said, \u201cThen the children are always first in line. Those are the laws of succession of this country.\u201d\u201cThen what should I do? I\u2019m in a lot of debt for her hospital fees and I was going to repay them when I got my share of the inheritance.\u201d\u201cIn these cases, you could negotiate with all the heirs and request payment for performance, or if that doesn\u2019t work, you will have to fight with your cousins in a family law court. Even if you litigated it at court and you win the costs for your contributions, this won\u2019t be deducted from the legal portion of the heirs. All the children will get a set share of the inheritance. But first, read this. I found a similar case to yours.\u201dYoonshin turned his screen to the man so he could read the precedent from the Supreme Court. Perhaps it was because Yoonshin summarized it in simple words, the man read it with intense concentration.As he waited, Yoonshin checked the time on his phone and saw that there was a message from Secretary Tak. It said that the lawyer from the pro bono case was willing to settle for the amount Yoonshin called, along with issuing an apology within his company.Here and there, the world was full of cases that the law couldn\u2019t solve.Yoonshin swallowed back a bitter sigh.* * *Upon returning from the annex, Yoonshin went to the library on the second floor of the main building. Nobody had enough free time to waste by reading in this room. Thanks to that, Yoonshin was alone.Originally, he had planned to snap a few pictures of the pages that he needed but found himself being pulled in a different direction. He leaned against the shelves and flipped through a book of divorce precedents\u2014by the time he looked up, one hour had already passed.\u2018Oh my God, look at the time.\u2019\u00a0Upon checking the time, Yoonshin hurriedly gathered his books and got up. Just then, he heard the door opening. He didn\u2019t know who it was, but he was planning on greeting them anyway and moved to the hallway. But the moment he saw the person who came in, he couldn\u2019t say anything.It was Sehun in a clean suit.Sehun also discovered Yoonshin as he stopped with two books in his hands.\u201cYou look free.\u201dYoonshin was surprised at this coincidence, but he soon frowned. \u201cYou always greet me like that. Yes, I\u2019m happy to see you too.\u201d\u201cAs I thought, we should try to avoid each other as much as possible.\u201d Sehun moved, about to leave at any moment. Yoonshin quickly caught up to him and grabbed Sehun\u2019s shoulder. Yoonshin had stopped Sehun almost instinctively, but after remembering that Sehun told him not to touch him last time, he felt distressed.Yoonshin swallowed nervously, took his hands off, and was about to apologize. In retaliation, Sehun grabbed Yoonshin\u2019s bony wrist and pushed the younger man\u2019s skinny frame against the bookshelf.Yoonshin, with his back to a shelf, looked up quietly.He considered pushing the other man away, but Sehun\u2019s grip was quite strong, and Yoonshin was still holding the divorce precedents in his other hand, so he couldn\u2019t move. Moreover, he was the one who made a mistake first, so it didn\u2019t feel right to react any more than necessary. \u201cYou seem to have a habit of pushing people to the wall. Do you do this to everyone? They\u2019ll misinterpret this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I only do this to you.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll misinterpret it. I\u2019ll get curious for no reason, and I\u2019ll keep thinking of you.\u201d\u201cFor example, you\u2019ll think that I stare at you too intensely?\u201d\u201cThat was\u2026!\u201d A million replies popped up sporadically in his head, but he was reluctant to say it out loud. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t answer in the end and only gawked.As the silence continued, Sehun maintained his grip and pushed his knees between the younger man\u2019s legs, restraining the other\u2019s movements completely. Their breaths were too close to each other. Yoonshin awkwardly averted his eyes and carefully changed the topic. \u201cW-what brought you here? You usually ask the secretaries when you need something.\u201d\u201cDonating some books.\u201d Sehun waved the two books before Yoonshin\u2019s eyes and placed them on the trolley of the library. Yoonshin glanced at the cover and saw that it was\u00a0Great Expectations. A flurry of emotions swirled in his head. Then, mustering up his courage, Yoonshin looked straight at the other man. As he had expected, Sehun had been gazing down at him all along.Sehun\u2019s deep and subdued eyes scared Yoonshin for the first time. The younger man couldn\u2019t say anything and simply pursed his lips. Sehun brought up his now free hand. Then, he brushed Yoonshin\u2019s eyelids lightly with his fingertips.\u201cYou look better, not swollen. You look less gloomy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Awareness - WordExcerpt\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d Yoonshin flinched and let out a short grunt. Yoonshin had never imagined that his eyelids would be this sensitive, so when he let out that sound, he felt silly and distressed. He squeezed his humiliated eyes shut before he opened them again, only to be met with Sehun\u2019s words that threw him into turmoil.\u201cWhy are you so shaken up? I\u2019ll be the one to misunderstand you.\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? I just want to know why I\u2019m suffering.\u201d Yoonshin questioned.\u201cBecause I feel like it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a better, more substantial reason\u2026?\u201d Yoonshin was cut off.\u201cI always end up touching you. I could just ignore you, but I can\u2019t when I see you. I really hate this inexplicable, uncomfortable feeling.\u201dCausal links.Sehun liked when a situation had definitive causes. It gave legal responsibility to the actor. But the things that continued to happen between the two of them did not seem to have clear causes, which made Sehun uneasy. Yoonshin\u2019s appearance created anomalies in Sehun\u2019s structured life.\u201cWell, I\u2019m very sorry. But if you hate it that much, isn\u2019t it as simple as not touching?\u201d\u201cIf I could, I would have already done that.\u201d When Sehun said he couldn\u2019t help it, it wasn\u2019t a matter of simple physical contact, and Yoonshin could feel that. Sehun seemed to be expending a part of his emotions on Yoonshin. As they continued to bump into each other, Yoonshin felt like they were becoming entangled in each other\u2019s territories. Despite not sharing their innermost thoughts, they innately intruded on each other, and there was no way to get around it.Sehun gazed intently at Yoonshin\u2019s fair face, then he rolled his eyes down smoothly like a droplet of water along the younger man\u2019s face. They fell upon the divorce precedents which Yoonshin\u2019s bony fingers were tightly clutching.\u201cWhatever\u2014let\u2019s end that conversation here. Did you come here to borrow that?\u201dFeeling Sehun\u2019s gaze, Yoonshin glanced at the cover and nodded. \u201cOh, yes. I thought I would give it a read. Reading precedents helps when my mind feels cluttered.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re getting a divorce?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been married. Are you that disinterested in me?\u201d\u201cEven if I were interested in you, you think you can handle me? I\u2019m very persistent. I\u2019ll scour through your entire life.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t received your attention before, so I don\u2019t know yet. But, uh\u2026 could you let go of me? It hurts,\u201d Yoonshin asked quite desperately, and only then, Sehun stared at the younger man\u2019s wrist as if he had only just noticed it. Sehun\u2019s thoughts were opaque to Yoonshin as he leaned in.Maybe it was because their distance was too close, or maybe it was because a dizzying fragrance came from the other; Yoonshin felt his heart race faster than usual. His shoulders grew stiff. He was unfamiliar with such feelings\u2014when Yoonshin tried to wriggle out, Sehun rather easily released his grip.Yoonshin felt a bit defeated that he was freed so easily. He stared down at the red handprint on his wrist before he looked back up at Sehun. Before Yoonshin realized it, Sehun was already two steps back, leaning against the bookshelf across and facing Yoonshin. \u201cHow much was the settlement? Why didn\u2019t you report it to me?\u201d\u201cI was going to once I had all the documents in order. It was 10 times the OP\u2019s offer. They also withdrew their claim. The case isn\u2019t completely over, but the biggest obstacle is out of the way. Thank you for your help. To be honest, my vision turned blank for a moment when that lawyer with so many more years of experience grabbed me by my collar.\u201dMore than anything else, if it weren\u2019t for Sehun, he would have been stuck with a lawsuit that would most likely end with probation. Yoonshin would have won in any event, but he would have ended up awkwardly comforting himself that he did his best despite not being able to compensate his client proportionately for her suffering.Sehun taught him several things with only one command. Yoonshin was probably drunk on his own grand ideologies. The older man standing on the other side of the river saw Yoonshin through accurately. The law was excellent and grand, but the truth was not. At times, for reasons like having insufficient evidence, the law couldn\u2019t protect the victim for inadequate reasons, and it was a system full of flaws.Yoonshin needed a different power to truly win. Sometimes, it was the power of authority, and other times it was information from dubious sources, like this case. There were probably many more solutions that existed which Yoonshin never experienced. Sometimes, there was nothing he could do with simply candor to his name.Yoonshin held back a heavy sigh, and Sehun\u2019s bass voice cut through his useless thoughts. \u201cFourth-year.\u201d\u201cYes, Senior Attorney?\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201d Sehun\u2019s stoic voice was enough to astound Yoonshin. He didn\u2019t do anything amazing, but this simple phrase felt like a positive assessment for ignoring all his past precedents and only following this law firm\u2019s rules.While he was fumbling about at the unexpected praise, Sehun cast a sharp glance at Yoonshin and left the younger man. Perhaps he was looking for a book because he walked over to the shelf with commercial law precedents. In Yoonshin\u2019s vision, he saw the older man\u2019s elegant gait, the slight fluttering of his necktie, and his handsome face earnestly selecting the right book, framed by the spaces between the bookcases.For some reason, he felt an impulse to catch Sehun pound in his chest. Yet he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. With a couple of bookshelves between the two, he simply watched Sehun.He didn\u2019t know how much time passed. Sehun found his book and was about to leave when Yoonshin called to him without thinking. \u201cSenior Attorney Kang.\u201d\u2018Please stay with me\u2026 like back then. No, stay longer than last time.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Awareness - WordExcerptYoonshin hesitated\u2014he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the rest of his thoughts out loud. Sehun, who was about to leave completely, turned around. As if to connect the time that was dragging on, he said in his low but steady voice. \u201cAre you practicing your right to silence? Just say whatever you want to say.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Please go ahead.\u201dSehun frowned in irritation at the lackluster answer. Yoonshin felt like he could hear the other\u2019s retort despite not leaving his mouth. He protested anyways, \u201cIs using a few seconds on me that much of a waste to you?\u201d\u201cYeah, it is. It\u2019s more of a waste on you than anything else.\u201d\u201cOh, of course, I\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see how much longer you can be that cocky.\u201d As Sehun shook his head, he turned to leave but then stopped without being called this time. He looked like he was analyzing something in his head briefly, then he gave Yoonshin quite the shocking offer. \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll be working on all my cases with me. Get briefed on all my files from Secretary Tak, and going forward, go to the meetings for the cases I assign to you. Before that, I\u2019m in charge of a trial for a case, so sit in on that first. Of course, that\u2019s if you\u2019re willing.\u201dYoonshin brightened up, hugged his book tightly, and nodded enthusiastically. Then, he suddenly recalled what Mihee told him and asked, \u201cIs it an appeal case? I heard you like those.\u201dSehun frowned, questioning what Yoonshin meant. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the first trial.\u201d\u201cHow many cases do you take on at once? Your body won\u2019t last.\u201d\u201cI take enough to last. It\u2019s a simple corporate trial that I took as a bit of a service to an old client.\u201d\u201cSimple or not, I\u2019ll go even if there\u2019s a natural disaster.\u201d\u201cHow resolute. If there\u2019s a natural disaster, the judge can\u2019t come, so just stay put in your house.\u201d Sehun clicked his tongue and completely turned around. The doors opened and closed, and Sehun, who exuded the heavy atmosphere of a conqueror, vanished like seafoam. Now left alone, Yoonshin staggered and flumped down wherever he could sit.Sehun was cold-hearted yet kind. Yoonshin felt like this antipodal description was difficult for others to understand, but it was true. As Yoonshin thought about what Sehun said, he slowly raised his left hand. He touched his eyelids. He imagined it was the other\u2019s soft touch and unconsciously brought his fingertips down and rubbed his lips.His fingers met his lips like a kiss. Yoonshin\u2019s heart leaped, and he felt himself coming back to his senses.He coughed, choking on air. His entire face grew as red as a tomato. To further confirm that, his entire face felt extremely hot.\u2018Why did I do that?\u2019\u00a0He wanted to deny what had happened, but he had to admit that he was feeling sexual attraction. There was no other explanation. If Sehun ever found out, Yoonshin felt like he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave in one piece. After all, Sehun was someone who was okay if he did something, but he was intolerant when others did the same thing.Like a retreating soldier, Yoonshin jumped up and ran out of the room, unable to collect the mess that he was.The door slammed loudly, closing firmly.Act 09Sehun\u2019s case was a corporate lawsuit. It was a claim against an officer of the company for the compensation of damages. Sehun represented the plaintiff corporation which took action against one of its officers who went against the articles of incorporation. Next to Sehun was the managing director, who was elected as the representative by the general meeting of employees, per the\u00a0Commercial Act.In the center of the court, the chief justice gestured at the bailiff. The bailiff called the witness a few times, and a man took the witness stand. While that happened, the defendant\u2019s lawyer glanced at Sehun, who was preparing his documents, before averting his gaze when their eyes met.Yoonshin and Secretary Tak were observing from the gallery.When they first met, it was the opposite\u2014now, Yoonshin had Sehun\u2019s permission to watch his trial. He was amazed at how much things had changed.The first trial of Sehun that Yoonshin watched was like treading on thin ice. It was slippery, and the air was frigid. It felt like the lawyers were duking it out in the middle of a blizzard with little visibility. Sehun dealt the first blow.\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s counsel, proceed with your examination.\u201d As soon as the judge permitted, Sehun stood before the witness, wearing his three-piece suit. His eyes were so cold that they looked oppressive as he stared directly at the man on the witness stand.When the tall man with a sharp expression stood in the center of the court, the eyes and attention of the entire room naturally focused on Sehun. His well-formed lips parted and all the people in the court watched him. \u201cHave you heard about the Commercial Act, Article 399, paragraph 1?\u201dThe man, who was watching Sehun cautiously, nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf a corporation\u2019s directors violate the act or go against their articles of incorporation when they neglect to perform their duties, they are jointly and severally liable for damages to the company. Do you recognize this paragraph?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear of Article 399 of the Commercial Act most recently?\u201d\u201cSee, I already knew about this legislation since it\u2019s common knowledge among executive officers of any company.\u201d\u201cI asked where you most recently heard this being said.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Dinner - WordExcerptSehun repeated his question, pointing out the witness\u2019s mistake. His voice was low but gentle. The witness glanced at the defense attorney and hesitated before finally saying, \u201cDirector Jeong said there was such an article, and I heard it when we were both smoking in the conference room together. The director said that if you violate it, the director and auditor are responsible for damages.\u201d\u201cBy Director Jeong, are you referring to the defendant?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen did you have this conversation with him?\u201d\u201cIt was around early this year\u2026 not long after the new year.\u201d\u201cIt was around the same time that the defendant incurred the huge damages on the corporation. Even if they are an officer, it\u2019s uncommon to rant and talk about the articles and paragraphs of the\u00a0Commercial Act\u00a0unless in specific circumstances. Maybe they would but in a summarized fashion. Normally, corporate counsel or people involved in litigation talk about it. Do you think that the defendant had something that pricked his conscience?\u201d As soon as Sehun finished his spiel, the defense lawyer stood up.\u201cI have an objection. My friend is asking the witness to speculate.\u201dThe judge gave Sehun a stern look. \u201cObjection accepted. Counsel, please only examine the witness on facts.\u201dSehun nodded and continued his cross-examination. \u201cAll right, please look here. This recording will prove that this is a fact.\u201dA senior lawyer who worked under Sehun opened a screen. It was surveillance footage of the conference room of the company. The footage was recorded with the consent of all the officers who attended that meeting, but it seemed that an employee accidentally recorded their break as well.After clearly showing that the defendant was visibly anxious while talking about the\u00a0Commercial Act, Sehun returned to the witness stand. \u201cYou entered the company at the same time as the defendant. It was just the two of you. At the time, the country encountered a foreign exchange crisis, so it was a difficult time for everyone. After preparing furiously during this difficult time, you probably put in your blood, sweat, and tears into your work for the sake of your company. That is how you could sit in your position today.\u201cYou\u2019re correct.\u201d\u201cHowever, you and the defendant have the same position, yet your salaries are different. You have twice the salary, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, as far as I know.\u201d\u201cAfter working so hard, only his colleague got a pay raise while his pay was frozen. What if this was all due to academic background instead of work performance? Naturally, the human psyche would lead to intentionally neglecting\u2026\u201d\u201cI have an objection!\u201d Before Sehun finished, the defense attorney objected.Sehun narrowed his eyes and stared at the other party. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d\u201cCross-examine with closed questions! The court isn\u2019t where you speculate.\u201d\u201cI was examining based on material facts. It\u2019s a fact that the two officer\u2019s salaries are different and that the defendant neglected their duties, leading to millions of dollars in damages to the corporation which resulted in this lawsuit! What am I speculating? I\u2019m curious to know.\u201dThe two lawyers seemed to start a dispute, so the judge stopped them immediately. An indescribably uncomfortable ambiance hung in the air.Yoonshin watched every moment of the trial unfold and slowly started to realize that the frigid atmosphere that Sehun created was so he could push an emotional narrative.This case was simply a matter between two parties of unequal power balance, so Sehun didn\u2019t need to shake the weakness of the defendant in their face. That was probably why he called it a simple hearing. However, the narrative was that the defendant was angered, so they intentionally caused harm to the company for their differential treatment; Sehun was trying to emotionally stimulate the judiciary and the audience and make them come to one conclusion.It initially seemed like the defendant was pitiful in getting differential treatment. However, after starting this career, Yoonshin learned that the world didn\u2019t run that way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - Dinner - WordExcerptSurprisingly, as time went by, people tended to favor the stronger side. They neither pitied the weak nor fought for them. Sehun would probably continue to take advantage of this proclivity throughout the hearing.\u2018That officer probably worked hard their entire life, but they made one mistake\u2026 It doesn\u2019t feel that great,\u2019 Yoonshin thought. Sehun, looking perfect, returned to the center and glanced around the gallery. His eyes met briefly with Yoonshin, who was sitting in the corner. When Yoonshin acknowledged his look, Sehun turned around as if he had never gazed Yoonshin\u2019s way in the first place and continued to skillfully cross-examine the witness.Yoonshin felt wronged for no reason. He bit his lower lip. Just then, he got a call.When he checked the caller on the screen, he made a complicated face. With a glance, he told Secretary Tak that he would be back soon, then he quietly slipped out of the courtroom.When he reached an empty hallway, he accepted the call. \u201cThis is Yoonshin Do of Doguk speaking.\u201dAfter listening quietly to the other person on the line, he frowned, looking troubled. However, he sounded as respectful as possible and replied, \u201cOf course. I heard from my sister the other day. Unfortunately, my schedule is full this weekend, so that\u2019ll be hard for me. Maybe next week or the week after\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s fine with me. Yes. Yes, sure. Taesan Hotel? The first Sunday of next month at 6:00 p.m. I\u2019ll write the date down.\u201dYoonshin felt weak and leaned against the wall, pressing a hand on his forehead. He wasn\u2019t feeling feverish, but strangely enough, it felt hot where his skin met. He couldn\u2019t let the other party on the line notice, so he feigned brightness, \u201cNo, probably not. I don\u2019t think my sister can attend. I\u2019ll go alone. It\u2019s not a formal meeting between the families and we\u2019re meeting for the first time. I\u2019ve seen her picture, so I can recognize her. Okay, then I\u2019ll see you then.\u201dAfter the short phone call, Yoonshin let out a deep sigh.Yoonshin didn\u2019t have any fantasies about marriage. He didn\u2019t even have any expectations. It wasn\u2019t that he was wary of it or avoided it\u2014he just wasn\u2019t sure what to think.He had vague impressions that he would meet the right person when the time came, and he would end up marrying that person. Maybe he would suddenly meet someone one day like his sister did and feel a spark leading to passionate love. He was fine with anything. He was open to anything. Whether his feelings were hot or tepid, his share of destiny would let him meet someone, someday, somehow or another. However, this was not the way he wanted.Yoonshin was fine with blind dates. If it was truly meant to be, he thought he didn\u2019t need to discriminate on the method. However, this relationship was one that his brother-in-law wanted, so his stomach felt like it was in a knot. Despite being in divorce talks, his sister personally delivered the photos, which meant that his brother-in-law was genuinely investing a lot of effort into this matter.\u2018I have to meet her at least.\u2019But whether he felt good about the meeting or not, both cases worried him. If it were the former and his marriage proceeded smoothly, his situation might turn for the worst when his sister split with her husband later. If it were the latter and he just didn\u2019t develop any feelings at all, then it would be horrible of him to force himself to maintain the relationship with his blind date.He felt like a child, unable to do anything. The adults kept their secrets under wraps and proceeded to do what they needed to do while Yoonshin was in the middle, being swept away with nothing to hold onto.He wanted someone to anchor him so that he didn\u2019t fall over.As he thought that, a certain person\u2019s handsome face came to mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Dinner - WordExcerpt\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me these days? Do I have nobody to rely on? Of all people\u2026\u201d Yoonshin\u2019s face turned red in embarrassment as he looked around his surroundings. It was then that Secretary Tak appeared from around the corner. Yoonshin\u2019s heart raced like he was caught red-handed while doing something bad. He cooled his rosy cheeks with the back of his hands and walked toward the secretary.\u201cOh, Secretary Tak, why are you out here?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cWhy do you have nobody to rely on? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. I was talking to myself.\u201d\u201cLet it be me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your words.\u201d Yoonshin managed to smile, genuinely appreciative, and Secretary Tak smiled back.Then, Secretary Tak said, \u201cBased on how things are moving, it seems like it\u2019ll soon be over. The other side just can\u2019t compete.\u201d\u201cIt seemed like that was the case.\u201d\u201cOh, right. Senior Attorney Song asked if we wanted to have dinner with her since we\u2019re already out. I already asked Senior Attorney Kang, but I forgot to ask you. Will you be free? If you are, I can make the reservation.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be intruding on the three of you, right?\u201d\u201cNah. Me aside, Attorney Kang doesn\u2019t have feelings of attachments like that. Besides, if you\u2019re going to talk about intruding on people, I would be the intruder. Three lawyers and I\u2019m the only secretary. Is there anything you want to eat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the hardest answer to cater to.\u201d Perhaps Secretary Tak wasn\u2019t satisfied with that answer because he wrinkled his brows. Then, nodding in understanding, he turned around. Yoonshin returned to the courtroom, leaving behind Secretary Tak, who was on the phone. Upon returning to his seat, he watched Sehun talking to his client at the plaintiff\u2019s table.Perhaps Sehun felt the dogged stare because he glanced back at Yoonshin while the other lawyer was examining their witness. But seeing Yoonshin sitting limply with only his eyes gleaming at him, Sehun furrowed his brows.His face was usually as rational as a mathematical equation, but it now mixed with emotions like an impurity. His face was written with\u00a0\u2018What\u2019s your problem?\u2019Yoonshin couldn\u2019t bring himself to answer his silent question and averted his eyes first.* * *The dinner that Yoonshin expected to end at the first restaurant continued at a second location. Thanks to Attorney Song calling over a couple of other lawyers who were still at the firm, the party grew in size. The private room of the extravagant bar was lively and bustling.This was Yoonshin\u2019s first time attending something reminiscent of a firm dinner and was taken aback by it. Before Yoonshin\u2019s eyes, the people\u2014who always carried themselves rigidly in their suits and were buried in work\u2014were having a good time. Regardless of age and position, they were all engrossed in enjoying the drinking party.Throughout all of this, Sehun tolerated his conversation with Mihee in a slightly quieter atmosphere, but he seemed a bit too tired to bear the rest. He slipped out to the terrace smoking area in the middle with a cigarette between his lips. He was patting his jacket pockets when Yoonshin, who followed him out, quickly pulled out a disposable lighter. \u201cHere, a light.\u201dSehun looked down at Yoonshin for a moment, who glided out next to him before he leaned down to let Yoonshin light his cigarette. His red lips barely clamped onto the filter.\u201cIf you have something to say, just say it.\u201d\u201cDo you usually stick around at dinners like this? I thought you\u2019d leave soon, but I didn\u2019t expect you to stay.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me why I\u2019m not dicking out like usual\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask in such a vulgar way. What do you see me as?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Tension - WordExcerptPerhaps Sehun was a bit tipsy because he grinned and readily replied, \u201cIt\u2019s in the appendix of my contract.\u201d\u201cWow, that must be the work of Attorney Song. I don\u2019t know if I should say she had the foresight or simply knew you well.\u201dSehun didn\u2019t reply, but Yoonshin felt that the older man silently agreed to both cases. As they momentarily enjoyed the fresh air in silence, a cold breeze surrounded the two men. Sehun leaned back against the rails with his elbows supporting him. With every breath, a puff of smoke appeared then dissipated. Yoonshin chased after it in futility with his narrowed eyes.Every moment he was together with Sehun felt like a scene from a novel.They were engrossed in tranquility when Sehun suddenly pulled himself out of the moment. \u201cWhy did you follow me out again? You were with me all day. Let\u2019s get a divorce. I\u2019m sick of this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always fresh to me. I\u2019ve never met anyone like you before.\u201d Yoonshin ended up telling what he had heard from Secretary Tak back to the person in question. Sehun scoffed at Yoonshin\u2019s ridiculous reply. Then, with his free hand, he jabbed a finger at Yoonshin\u2019s chest. His long finger pushed into Yoonshin\u2019s shirt like an arrow, then it slowly lifted itself.Yoonshin thought that was the end of the physical contact, but Sehun touched Yoonshin\u2019s chest again. This time, he didn\u2019t take his finger off and slowly dragged it upward, teasing his Adam\u2019s apple. That wasn\u2019t the end. Going back the way it came from, Sehun drew his finger down at a slow pace. The unhurried trail downward past his solar plexus and gradually toward his buckle felt unbearably erotic.It was the first time Yoonshin had ever felt so endangered by the same sex. Sehun presented this feeling each time they met.Yoonshin swallowed nervously. As the older man\u2019s hand touched his abdomen, Yoonshin grabbed it.Despite their skin touching, Sehun didn\u2019t get angry. He looked amused as he clamped down on his cigarette. He grabbed the back of Yoonshin\u2019s neck, yanking him closer.\u201cSenior Attorney.\u201d Astonished, Yoonshin tried to call the older lawyer, but it was all for naught. Sehun pulled the younger man\u2019s skinny frame until he was even closer; then, when they got close enough, he snuffed out his cigarette and blew smoke into the younger man\u2019s face. Yoonshin coughed and squinted, his vision filled with Sehun.\u201cAre you planning on killing me through second-hand smoking?\u201d\u201cThat takes too long. It\u2019s also too risky. I wouldn\u2019t use that method.\u201d\u201cAre you drunk by any chance? You did seem to drink endlessly.\u201d\u201cI did drink a bit more than usual today.\u201d\u201cWhy? Your arguments were good\u2026\u201dSehun interrupted Yoonshin mid-sentence. \u201cMy head hurts because of you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get what you mean all of a sudden. Did I do something wrong?\u201d\u201cYou keep pissing me off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMy headaches and insomnia are pretty bad these days. It\u2019s all your fault.\u201dYoonshin didn\u2019t recall making the older man irritated at work or in private. To say it another way, Sehun was picking on him for no reason.Yet strangely, Yoonshin didn\u2019t feel upset by it. The pre-existing emotions that the usually seasoned and professional older man kept hidden probably morphed to a different form. Yoonshin didn\u2019t know exactly what those feelings were, but he could feel their existence.The palm that wrapped itself around Yoonshin\u2019s neck moved. Sehun rolled his hand over the soft skin of the other, massaging it. Where their skin touched, heat naturally arose. Yoonshin\u2019s whole body seemed to heat up along with it.They were so close to each other that Yoonshin could smell the alcohol mixed with the spicy scent of nicotine in the other\u2019s breath. The cologne that the older man frequently wore floated on the top notes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Tension - WordExcerptYoonshin felt his vision spin, and he pushed Sehun\u2019s hand away. Following that, he outstretched his arms, locking Sehun between them. He detained Sehun with his body in all directions. Sehun, who was resting his arms on the rails behind him, stared down at Yoonshin with frosty eyes. \u201cAre you revolting against me? I\u2019m sure I told you not to touch me.\u201d\u201cI did it because you groped me enough to make me feel threatened. I\u2019m not going against you; it\u2019s my way of self-defense.\u201d Yoonshin couldn\u2019t understand the older man. Sehun would approach him, ready to bargain while playing hard to get, but when Yoonshin questioned him, he would back out and feign ignorance. When Yoonshin felt enough was enough and he decided to forget about his misunderstandings, Sehun would approach him again like before and poke around.Of all people, Sehun Kang didn\u2019t need to try to maintain good relations with just another associate lawyer like Yoonshin. Therefore, the accumulation of misunderstandings was Sehun\u2019s negligence and liability without fault.Was Sehun truly not interested in Yoonshin? Sehun denied it, but the harder Yoonshin thought about it, the more convinced he was of his assumptions.Yoonshin hesitated briefly then borrowed some of his liquid courage. \u201cAndr\u00e9 Gide once said that man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.\u201dSehun unexpectedly received the comment well. \u201cWhat new ocean do you want to discover, Fourth-year?\u201d\u201cAn ocean to save me from my perils.\u201dHearing that, Sehun must have gotten a hunch of what Yoonshin wanted from him, so he asked in a more relaxed tone, \u201cWhat dangers are you exposed to?\u201d\u201cI want you to be clear first. Are you harboring any indecent feelings for me? I\u2019m asking you very sincerely and not because I\u2019m tipsy.\u201dSurprisingly, Sehun didn\u2019t jeer at him. He met Yoonshin\u2019s eyes very patiently. So despite his growing embarrassment, Yoonshin urged on, filling the air with his voice, \u201cDo you?\u201dSehun leered down doggedly like he was stripping the younger man naked, then he retorted, emphasizing each syllable.His voice was deep and subdued. \u201cAnd if I do?\u201dSehun\u2019s deep, monotonous voice lingered in Yoonshin\u2019s ears.Yoonshin winced that instant and swallowed nervously.Sehun\u2019s reply was terse, but those words bounced around until they completely filled Yoonshin\u2019s brain. Sehun\u2019s calm voice made Yoonshin\u2019s bony body tenser than if the older man had yelled at him. He asked after throwing all caution to the wind, but he had never imagined this answer coming from the lips of the cold and self-justified Sehun.\u201cIf you do\u2026\u201d Yoonshin echoed, his face growing warm. Unlike usual, it was difficult to look directly at the other\u2019s handsome face.Yoonshin\u2019s mouth felt parched, and his heart pounded in his chest.\u201cIf you do, then\u2026 Instead of keeping it to yourself, couldn\u2019t you just give it to me? I\u2019m in an urgent situation.\u201dSehun, who was thus far listening attentively, asked, \u201cAre you gay?\u201d\u201cI never really thought about it. I just assumed that I was straight.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not gay, and you\u2019re not interested in, attracted to, or curious about me in that way. Yet you\u2019re telling me I can have ulterior motives and that you\u2019re hard-pressed for time. This is fun.\u201dYoonshin felt his cheeks burning and bit his lower lip. All the while, he felt conscious of Sehun\u2019s gaze. There was no way Sehun, with his beast-like intuition and judgment, couldn\u2019t catch every minute change in Yoonshin\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Tension - WordExcerptYoonshin tried to gather himself by taking a few deep breaths to himself. He replied a beat later, \u201cI have respect for you in a professional sense, at least. I sometimes wonder how you could be so self-centered and ultimately win all the time. I wish I could learn that from you, and sometimes I envy you.\u201d\u2018Sometimes you look a bit lonely, you have good sides that other people don\u2019t realize you have, and sometimes you make my heart pound,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought, but he kept those thoughts to himself for now.Yoonshin felt ambivalent about Sehun. Sehun was worthy of respect, yet also it wasn\u2019t strange for him to receive the arrows of disdain. Yoonshin thought Sehun was a bad person, yet he wanted to get closer. Above all, Yoonshin needed Sehun.It was fine if Sehun couldn\u2019t help him and his sister substantially. He just wanted someone to lean on when he was feeling weary. People said that love didn\u2019t feed you. Yoonshin knew that. Money and substantial power brought food to the table. The heart\u2014whether in the form of love, friendship, or something else\u2014was powerless. Even so, there were times when he needed psychological comfort and support.Now was one of those times.For the first time in years, Yoonshin felt this impulse, this desire toward Sehun. However, the other man kept sending him mixed signals, making Yoonshin unsure he could cross the first boundary.\u201cThere should be some reason for pushing me into the wall and groping me. Have you still not found the answer? Ridiculous. You probably already know, but you don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201dSehun, who was silent all along, refuted nonchalantly, \u201cWho groped you? I probably just brushed past you.\u201dAfter coming so far yet still closing his eyes to it, Yoonshin finally snapped, \u201cWho \u201cbrushes past\u201d someone while rubbing their chest and neck?\u201d\u201cDo you have proof?\u201dObviously, Yoonshin didn\u2019t. Even if there was surveillance footage, Sehun could say that he simply brushed off some dust from Yoonshin\u2019s clothes, and people would believe him. But just as Sehun said before, the victim could perceive the strange mood when they were touched one-sidedly. Yoonshin always felt a peculiar sensation whenever the other man acted this way.\u201cFine. Let\u2019s say that you haven\u2019t. Then why do you keep trying me?\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re too toxic to swallow up right away.\u201d\u201cIs that why you\u2019re stewing me up? Are you sure I\u2019m fully cooked?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so curious. The answer won\u2019t turn up if I also start to wonder. Covering it up and walking away is best for you.\u201dUpon hearing that, Yoonshin felt the vague pieces in his head coming together to form a clear image. Sehun must have forgotten about it, but he had said that Yoonshin was a so-so, decent lawyer. Since this was about him, Yoonshin couldn\u2019t be objective\u2014but he was skilled enough in observation and judgment to understand the situation.\u201cAre you afraid that you\u2019ll come to like me?\u201d Yoonshin asked.He wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he hit the mark or if it was absurd. Unlike his former leisurely attitude, Sehun\u2019s face suddenly stiffened, and he pursed his lips. Yoonshin\u2019s hands trembled as he felt his insides simmer. Sehun didn\u2019t miss the moment Yoonshin was thrown off and flipped him around, making the skinny frame turn against the balcony rails.Yoonshin\u2019s back slammed against the hard structure and was made to stand where Sehun once stood. He looked up at Sehun with some resentment in his eyes. \u201cUrgh! That hurt. Even if I\u2019m a guy, I feel pain, you know.\u201d\u201cWhy did you cry back then?\u201d Sehun asked.It was a topic that Yoonshin never dreamed Sehun would bring, so he stuttered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Indirect\u201cCr\u2014Wh-who, who cried?\u201d\u201cShould I start by reciting your date of birth?\u201d Sehun asked sarcastically.\u201cJust what did you see?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014my associate, crouching in the corner of the street at night eating ramen?\u201d\u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201d Yoonshin attempted to retort without thinking but stopped himself.Sehun must have seen through his shabby lie in the first place. Inputting the fact that Sehun saw him crying into the equation, what happened the following day made sense. Sehun returned to the parking garage because he was concerned about Yoonshin, who had cried.Yoonshin assumed that Sehun might suspect that something upset him and that he cried based on his swollen eyelids and bloodshot eyes, but knowing the truth felt different. He wondered if Sehun Kang was truly capable of being thoughtful of others.\u201cYou were bawling your eyes out, crumpled in a corner just like when your father passed away. Do you know how annoyed I was that day because of you? I was sleepless all night.\u201d What came out of those red lips was not about the present but the past. Yoonshin, who was confused as to what Sehun was talking about, widened his eyes upon realization.Not only was it so long ago, but it was such a short moment that he wasn\u2019t sure if the older man remembered. \u201cYou remembered that?\u201d\u201cYou keep catching my eyes. No, I keep glancing at you secretly because I\u2019m bothered if you\u2019d hole yourself up somewhere and cry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe thought that something other than work is in my head bothers me greatly. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201dYoonshin could finally fit the last few pieces of the puzzle together. Sehun also remembered everything, so when he came to watch his trial with Mihee, they kept meeting eyes. Sehun had recognized Yoonshin.The two men exchanged looks fiercely with each other. Sehun stared at the other\u2019s pale face for a while, then unable to bear it any longer, he bit his lip and messed up the knot of his necktie. His breathing was a bit rougher and his face a bit rosier. He grabbed the end of his tie made of soft material and held it out to Yoonshin.\u201cKiss this.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s eyes grew round. Redness spread on his face like ink in water. \u201cWh-what now, all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cKiss the tie.\u201d\u201cWhy in the world on your tie\u2026 and not even on lips? Isn\u2019t that a bit cowardly?\u201d\u201cShut up and do it. It\u2019s an order.\u201dYoonshin felt irked for some reason, but that was all. Sehun said he didn\u2019t want to, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t keep asking why Sehun wasn\u2019t expressing his emotions clearly. Moreover, Yoonshin didn\u2019t know how he felt about the older man, although he was sure it was more unclear and indefinite than Sehun\u2019s feelings for Yoonshin\u2014he had no right to press on.After some hesitation, Yoonshin made up his mind and exhaled deeply. His reddened cheeks twitched because of the older man\u2019s persistent gaze that lingered on his lips. Then, Yoonshin grabbed the end of the tie and rubbed his lips like he was wiping his mouth.Sehun watched from start to finish, then once Yoonshin lifted his lips off, Sehun rubbed his red lips over the fabric. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he stuck out his tongue and traced over the fabric. Held captive, Yoonshin watched helplessly, unable to resist or react.Sehun had tilted his head slightly as he kissed his tie. He looked back up at Yoonshin. The moment their eyes met, Yoonshin felt dizzy, and his chin quivered.Their sensitive skin didn\u2019t even touch, yet both sighed at the same time.Yoonshin had never felt this embarrassed in his life. He couldn\u2019t come up with anything to say. While Yoonshin was collecting his breath, Sehun said in his deep voice, \u201cYoonshin Do.\u201dSehun called Yoonshin by his full name for the first time.Yoonshin didn\u2019t know why. He heard and saw his name every day, but for the sole reason that Sehun said it, he felt a strong, strange jolt. It sent chills up his spine. He couldn\u2019t pinpoint the reason exactly, so he could only gape, dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - IndirectWhile he was in disbelief, Sehun leaned in, turning his head slightly. Yoonshin was conflicted on whether he should close his eyes or push him away, but before he could register, his eyelids slowly closed.Then, Sehun\u2019s moist tongue briefly touched Yoonshin\u2019s lips.It was just then.Someone appeared from the back.\u201cAttorney Kang! How about we let the young ones enjoy themselves and us partners lea\u2014Oh my, did I disturb you?\u201dMihee who burst out onto the terrace saw the two almost embracing each other and stopped in her tracks. After looking back to check, Sehun finally let go of Yoonshin, who had been imprisoned in the older man\u2019s arms. They naturally stepped apart. Yoonshin rubbed at his bright red face.Mihee must have felt that the mood in the terrace was suggestive as she was reluctant to come closer. Then, Sehun said frankly, \u201cDon\u2019t misinterpret things. Nothing happened.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s just that this was quite a new sight for me. I never thought I\u2019d see you with someone in your arms. Attorney Do, if you were uncomfortable, report him to the police. I\u2019ll be your witness.\u201dYoonshin glanced between the two then waved his hands in decline. \u201cNo, I liked it.\u201dThen, the two older lawyers gave him strange looks. Sehun frowned, asking him what in the world he was going on about, and Mihee looked amused. He had chosen his words in consideration of the older man, but on second thought, it could sound different only a bit too late depending on the perspective and added, \u201cI meant that I wasn\u2019t uncomfortable. I\u2019m used to it because he does it every now and then.\u201d\u201cMy word, Sehun does that every now and then? I\u2019m just surprised all over again.\u201d\u201cFourth year. You could stay silent if you think you\u2019ll say bullshit.\u201d Sehun, unable to bear him any longer, grabbed Yoonshin by the shoulders and pushed him away, then he faced Mihee. Sehun had just called Yoonshin by his name, but they were back to square one. Yoonshin stared at the back of the older man\u2019s head and chewed on his lips. He felt the urge to mess up the well-groomed hair and clenched his fist.Ignorant to Yoonshin\u2019s thoughts, Sehun pretended like there was nobody behind him and walked toward Mihee. \u201cLet\u2019s go. And the car?\u201d\u201cSecretary Tak called a chauffeur. We can take your car. Listen, I think I came at the wrong time given the mood\u2026 Is it all right to leave him like that? I\u2019m starting to feel sorry.\u201d\u201cI said you\u2019re misunderstanding the situation.\u201d\u201cStill. Leaving like this is rude to Attorney Do. Wrap up the situation, and I\u2019ll just go on ahead. Have a restful weekend, and I\u2019ll see you Monday, soldiers.\u201dShe smiled awkwardly, looking truly apologetic, and waved before running off. Sehun watched for a moment then shook his head, making his way out. Yoonshin felt a bit upset now that he wouldn\u2019t even turn back once after pushing him against a hard place.Just before Sehun disappeared into the corner, Yoonshin snapped back to his senses and hurriedly chased after him. Then, he caught Sehun\u2019s wrist as the other was walking toward the parking lot, out of the exit. Normally, Yoonshin would have let go immediately in surprise the moment they touched, but he didn\u2019t this time. He grabbed Sehun intentionally. \u201cWait a moment, Senior Attorney. I have something to tell you.\u201dSehun glanced down at his caught wrist and frowned. \u201cAre you making light of your superior\u2019s words?\u201d\u201cDid our lips touch?\u201d Yoonshin asked anyway.Sehun retorted, \u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m sure your tongue\u2026\u201d\u201cThey did not.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to fool me because my eyes were closed? No way. That\u2019s inhumane of you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m inhumane. Is that what you need to tell me?\u201d\u201cSee? They did touch,\u201d Yoonshin burst, then realized that this wasn\u2019t the most urgent thing to address. He tried to look composed and continued, \u201cThis is just\u2026 I\u2019m telling you this, just in case. If you think this has nothing to do with you, you can just forget it. Well, I guess this probably wouldn\u2019t impact your life in any case.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be the one to judge that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going on a blind date next Sunday.\u201dThat moment, Sehun\u2019s brow twitched, unable to hide how perturbed he was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Indirect [V1 End]They were looking at each other, so Yoonshin could see that change. However, Sehun didn\u2019t confirm or deny how shaken up he was and simply let the silence trickle like a quiet stream of water. Getting a bit anxious, Yoonshin attempted to maintain his composure and kept going, \u201cThings will probably progress without a blip, and if she\u2019s not a bad person, I\u2019ll probably go with the flow and get engaged, then I\u2019ll get married. My sister said her husband wants to be connected to that family, suggested them to her, and said that it\u2019s much needed for everyone. Plus, I listen to my sister very well. To say it another way, I don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201dYoonshin was cautious, trying to gauge Sehun\u2019s feelings. So far, Yoonshin had never considered the possibility of being sexually attracted to the same sex. He mustered up all his courage for this one possibility that the relationship could develop. He was often conscious of Sehun, while Sehun sometimes felt conflicted because of him. For that reason alone, he thought this was the tree to bark up.Inside, he wanted Sehun to stop him, but there was nothing between the two, so he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask directly. However, if Sehun had any mind to hold onto Yoonshin, even if nothing formed from these feelings immediately, it had to be now. Yoonshin was running out of time. He was sure there was willpower to make this progress, but if they kept measuring each other and missed this moment, there might not be another opportunity. He tried to convey all of this through his eyes.Sehun quietly gazed down at Yoonshin. However, he replied quite unhurriedly, \u201cWhy\u2019re you telling me that you have no time?\u201dYoonshin\u2019s shoulders that were tense instantly relaxed and turned to mush. \u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d\u201cDo I need to say more?\u201d\u201cForget it if you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cExcuse you, but I understood very well.\u201d Thanks to Sehun\u2019s firm and cold tone, Yoonshin flinched, then he blinked slowly. Reiterating his tone, Sehun dryly added, \u201cKeep yourself together and go on your date. If your brother-in-law wanted it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll help your lousy career. Oh, I guess it would help our firm too. Best of luck.\u201dSehun yanked off his wrist from the younger man\u2019s grip and walked away. Sehun disappeared from sight, and Yoonshin was left to ponder about the ambiguous answer that wasn\u2019t quite encouragement, a greeting, or mockery. Too late, Yoonshin bowed and saw him off, but Sehun didn\u2019t see.Sehun plodded on, now completely out of the corridor.He saw his car parked in a corner. A driver from the firm, who was standing by, opened the backseat door. Sehun reached the hood of his car and was about to get into the backseat but stopped to glance at the entrance of the bar. As expected, Yoonshin was not there.Then he slammed his hands on the frame of the car in a high-strung manner. \u201cF*cking hell.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going on a blind date next Sunday.\u201dWhen he heard that, he had to acknowledge that he felt more rage bubbling in him than when he saw Yoonshin smile with his swollen eyes.Sehun was extremely vulnerable to such feelings. He had never been possessive of anyone before, so he had no idea how to get ahold of himself. Plus, what he loathed the most in the world was being unable to control himself. That was why his defense mechanisms activated.He got in the car after some delay. The driver closed his door, and while he was walking to the driver\u2019s seat, Sehun leaned back comfortably and fell into thought. Inevitably, he ruminated on Yoonshin\u2019s words.\u201cAre you afraid that you\u2019ll come to like me?\u201dHe glanced down at the necktie that they layered their lips over and ground his teeth. Following that, he yanked off his tie irritably. He hurled it at the passenger seat then closed his eyes in an attempt to push away all his idling thoughts.But no matter what he tried, Yoonshin\u2019s voice continued to linger and pester him.After meeting Yoonshin Do again, everything was getting twisted and messed up.(To be continued in volume 2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Cognizance (19)Act 10Sehun sat in front of his laptop monitor in the study of his apartment and turned on his USB microphone. He snapped his fingers, making the senior lawyers on the screen stop hustling about and focus on Sehun. These lawyers were the manager-level members of a larger group in charge of a company acquisition matter project by Doguk.Sehun quietly stared at the screen behind the lawyers\u2019 heads, then he said, \u201cIf you made a partner sit at his study on a Sunday, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d need to make my voluntary service worth it? I hope this is a discussion that will help your careers as well.\u201dThen, the most experienced lawyer in the group raised his hand. His face clearly showed his determination not to ruin Sehun\u2019s weekend. He inhaled deeply, then he pointed at the lawyers next to him in order. \u201cStarting with me and going clockwise, we determined the key conditions of the contracts signed by the company to be acquired, articles of incorporation and rules for the board of directors, the collective agreement and labor regulations including employee insurance, the status of the assets including chattels and real property, and the status of the human resources of the company. As instructed, we investigated various areas of law and are writing a due diligence report. We thought it would be best to have an interim check-in with you to report a few key points in brief.\u201dFlipping through the printouts, Sehun asked calmly, \u201cIn the printed documents that Secretary Tak sent by courier, I see that the details on licenses, IP rights, and taxation are missing. Is Team B doing those?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. The various licenses and IP rights are being investigated by Team B. An accounting firm is investigating the tax issues independently, so those will be reported separately tomorrow. Our team is doing its best so that the acquired company can operate smoothly after the deal closes. But we need to finish gathering and organizing within the team first. I was wondering if you were all right to resume the meeting in one hour.\u201dSehun clapped shut the document and replied, \u201cI also need to look over the additional documents I received today, so I\u2019ll give you some leeway.\u201d\u201cThank\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you 25 minutes,\u201d Sehun one-sidedly ended the conversation. He flicked off the switch, muted his mic, and watched the lawyers on the screen running around wildly. He brought over the printouts and a fountain pen, then he sat on his sofa, out of view from the lawyers.He leaned back comfortably. As he quickly sifted through the documents, his eyes gradually became very focused.\u201cThe likelihood of success or failure of the deal on the line\u2026 Why is this opinion letter so verbose? Did they not look at the report written by the Fourth-year?\u201d Sehun muttered to himself. As he flipped through the pages, he marked the relevant points.Just then.A page fell from between the documents. Sehun picked it up, and his handsome face wrinkled faintly. It was part of the document submitted by a senior who specialized in labor law. The page was an addendum with charts on issues such as the overdue status of wages and termination pay and on the status of temporary workers. That itself was nothing special. However, the name on the top right corner made his brow knit together.He stared at the short note in the corner, requesting feedback if there were any errors, along with Yoonshin\u2019s name and number.\u2018The team\u2019s assistant manager asked Yoonshin to do work without my permission,\u2019\u00a0Sehun thought.It was only Yoonshin\u2019s name, yet Sehun felt his throat getting parched. This was probably because this was a trace left by Yoonshin. Sehun threw down the pen and paper roughly and rubbed his face with both hands.Since the other day, Sehun\u2019s time passed a bit differently than usual. Time felt slow like driving over a rough and bumpy, unfinished road, and the next moment, his car would bounce around uncontrollably. This was all thanks to the incident between him and Yoonshin at the bar a few days ago.He recalled the chilly breeze that blew on the dark terrace, their bodies pressed on each other as if to melt the cold air. The younger man\u2019s eyelids slowly closed as Sehun leaned in, his dense eyelashes fell like curtains around his eyes, and his ruby red, moist lips squirmed, nervous because of the impending kiss.And then, what touched Yoonshin\u2019s supple skin\u2026Sehun\u2019s lower half gradually felt tight as he thought back to that day. Sehun grew aware of an electrifying sensation spreading below his waist and bit his lips. He lowered his eyes and saw the bulge of his pants.He unzipped the front.The sensual sound of the zipper filled the air.Sure enough, he saw his member, swelling up in size and pitching a tent.He was rendered speechless for a moment, then he cursed out loud, \u201cDamn it, what the hell am I doing?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Cognizance (19)He bit his bottom lip and removed his hand from his abdomen. He crumpled the paper with Yoonshin\u2019s name on it and chucked it behind his sofa.He heard the ball of paper land, then he relaxed his limbs, letting himself slump like slime. He leaned his head back and took deep breaths to calm down.So far, he had felt a sort of covetous desire bubbling within him whenever he saw Yoonshin, but this was the first time he felt a wave of lust surging from his lower half.He didn\u2019t suddenly feel this way, and he didn\u2019t drink that much then. The feelings that he had bottled up inside boiled over, and he felt it becoming increasingly difficult to keep those feelings in. Sehun was awkward when it came to emotions, but he did know how to differentiate between them.\u201cDid our lips touch?\u201dSehun said no to that question, but they both knew that the tip of Sehun\u2019s tongue had touched Yoonshin\u2019s lips. If Mihee hadn\u2019t come in then, Sehun would have probably done a lot more than that. He wasn\u2019t going to deny it on the inside. At that time, he didn\u2019t just want to kiss Yoonshin, he wanted to have s*x with him. Perhaps even to this day, after two days had passed since then.At first, he thought this desperate thirst for attention and discomfort stemmed from the trauma when a child, who he treated like his younger sibling, died. \u00a0He assumed that the small scars left behind when he couldn\u2019t take care of those close to him manifested in a vexatious direction when he saw Yoonshin hiding in the corner to cry after losing someone dear to his heart. That was why he was so bothered by Yoonshin. It was almost like, through Yoonshin, he was acknowledging and staring straight into his weakness that he was hiding all along.But now he knew that wasn\u2019t the case. Sehun simply was hyperaware of everything about Yoonshin Do.As his mind shifted to his present emotions, he suddenly had a thought that made him quite bothered.\u2018Do I happen to think of that fool in\u2026\u2019\u00a0As if to cut off his thoughts, he sat up before that thought could be completed.He couldn\u2019t simply shake off the thought. This premonition had to be false. Yet the nagging feeling that the opposite would be true kept swelling up in his throat.He couldn\u2019t explore his feelings any longer. He learned things that he didn\u2019t need to know, and he felt like the thoughts that he shouldn\u2019t be caught having were going to be exposed.In the end, he didn\u2019t look back and ran away from his study.* * *Sehun rushed out of his office while looking at his watch but ran into the associate lawyer who was waiting for him at his door. Of all people, it was the person Sehun didn\u2019t want to meet the most, so his forehead creased in a frown.\u201cWhat?\u201d Sehun snapped.\u201cSenior Attorney, I heard you were going to a client meeting.\u201d Yoonshin looked into Sehun\u2019s eyes, who did not welcome the present situation. Yoonshin was asking for a bit of his time. One eyebrow twitched, but Sehun then turned away coldly, treating Yoonshin like he was invisible.Sehun headed toward the secretary\u2019s office and gestured to Secretary Tak. This time, Yoonshin stepped in front of Sehun, completely blocking his way. He waved the envelope in his hands leisurely. \u201cYou said you needed this, so I prepared it for you.\u201d\u201cDid my legal secretary change without my knowledge? The operation of this place is a mess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m still a lawyer. I also have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that free to have a one-on-one meeting with an associate when they need me. Take your number and line up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll only be a minute. \u00a0I\u2019ll accompany you to the parking lot instead of Secretary Tak. Your driver is waiting downstairs. After you.\u201dAngrily glowering at Secretary Tak, Sehun passed his briefcase to Yoonshin reluctantly.Yoonshin barely managed to catch the bag which was pushed roughly into his flat chest. He pattered off behind Sehun, who was walking ahead. After following close behind, he quickened his pace upon seeing the elevator grow closer. Yoonshin then sprinted ahead to catch the elevator. He then gestured for Sehun to get on. Sehun didn\u2019t even look in Yoonshin\u2019s direction as he got into the elevator.The two stood side by side, and the door closed firmly.Until a moment ago in the hallway, busy employees were going about their way, so it didn\u2019t feel awkward, but now that they were alone, a strange current flowed between them. This was probably the first time they were together in a closed space after last week\u2019s incident at the bar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - DefectPerhaps Sehun wasn\u2019t feeling conscious of this situation as he was preoccupied with adjusting his tie. After gauging for a good time to speak, Yoonshin asked, \u201cSenior Attorney, did you chew out the lawyer who made me do research? Secretary Tak seemed stressed out.\u201d\u201cWhether I tell him off or murder him, that\u2019s none of your business. I just had a conversation with him. You just focus on doing your work properly,\u201d Sehun said.\u201cWas my opinion letter bad? Was that why you criticized him\u2026? I was bothered about it.\u201dSehun sighed, then he turned to look at Yoonshin. The numbers on the elevator display continued to descend toward the basement.\u201cThe issue here isn\u2019t whether you did a good job or not. It\u2019s about whether I instructed you to do that work. Don\u2019t do anything that I didn\u2019t tell you to do ever again,\u201d Sehun said firmly.\u201cLast time, you said that I could attend meetings for the cases that you assigned, so I thought I was allowed to help,\u201d Yoonshin replied.\u201cI\u2019m looking for a decent case right now. That case isn\u2019t the one.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be more careful from now on.\u201dSehun was bothered by the disheartened reply, so he questioned in a sharp tone, \u201cHey, Fourth-year. Why do you think I gave you these instructions? Because I hate you that much?\u201d\u201cIf you hated me, you would\u2019ve already murdered me,\u201d Yoonshin replied.\u201cYou know that very well. From the moment you managed to crawl into my team, you were mine. I decide what you do and when. Everyone saw the deputy team leader getting his a*s handed to him today, so nobody would attempt it in the future, but later, if someone randomly gives you work, refuse it and tell them I said no.\u201d Sehun\u2019s explanation didn\u2019t answer all of Yoonshin\u2019s questions, but it hit the key points. Yoonshin understood that Sehun wasn\u2019t acting this way merely to put Yoonshin in a bad position. Sehun probably thought that this case was simply not a good fit for Yoonshin.Yoonshin felt slightly sorry for his senior who was openly shamed in front of his team just because he asked Yoonshin to do a few small favors.Abashed, Yoonshin hugged the file bag that he was holding securely even tighter. That wasn\u2019t the main reason for starting the conversation, so he spoke up again, \u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to rush you, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you the right advisory case when the time comes. The more you pester me about it, the longer it\u2019ll get delayed. Learn to be patient.\u201d\u201cNo, not that. Do I really go on my blind date? It\u2019s this Sunday.\u201dSehun, who was fastening his cufflinks meticulously, looked up. His eyes were sharper than usual. The Adam\u2019s apple of his long neck undulated roughly. Yoonshin missed it because he happened to look up at the elevator display at that moment, and just then, the elevator door opened with a ding.Sehun ultimately didn\u2019t answer and walked ahead. As Yoonshin said, the driver, who was standing by, opened the backseat door. Sehun hurriedly got in the car.Yoonshin, who was following Sehun thoughtlessly, glanced at the driver, asking him to wait, and went into the other side of the seat. Sehun laughed hollowly, not expecting this move. \u201cAre you crazy? I have no time to lose. Get out.\u201d\u201cJust this once. Since that dinner, all along, I\u2026\u201d Yoonshin started.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. You\u2019re not getting off?\u201d Sehun\u2019s icy voice and chilling glare pierced through Yoonshin like sharp icicles. Feeling the pointed things stabbing at him, Yoonshin felt upset from being stabbed by the other\u2019s pointed glare and callously threw the bag and envelopes in his arms. The items scattered carelessly on the luxurious car seat, and Yoonshin got off as if he had never entered in the first place. It was quite an impudent reaction, but instead of reproaching it, Sehun ignored it completely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - DefectYoonshin now knew what Sehun\u2019s reactions were like. Sehun had a natural talent for agitating people. Sehun Kang was ignoring Yoonshin on purpose.At this point, Yoonshin thought that he needed to say this at least once. He gnawed on the tender skin of his bottom lip as if he were chewing Sehun out, then he bent over and stuck his head back in the car.\u201cI gave you two chances. Just don\u2019t regret it later.\u201d After passing off the ball, he slammed the car door shut. He greeted the driver respectfully and turned around without looking back. To be honest, he was a bit disappointed at Sehun for acting like it wasn\u2019t his business. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t sleep well since the day the other man\u2019s lips touched his and wondered how Sehun could act this way despite being the instigator.Angry, Yoonshin stomped off as fast as he could. But by the time he reached the elevator, he heard a quiet and prudent sound of heels behind him, making him stop. While he stood perplexed, his shoulders were grabbed.When he turned around, surprisingly, Sehun was standing in front of him.\u201cSenior Attorney?\u201d Yoonshin asked in surprise.\u201cFourth-year. You seem to want an explanation for that day, so I\u2019ll give it to you. That was my mistake. Also, I don\u2019t want my life to have any flaws.\u201dYoonshin, shocked by the answer, chuckled hollowly. \u201cDid I ask you to make excuses? I don\u2019t need that. I just\u2026!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care if you want an excuse or a confession. Regardless of any of that, I\u2019m just telling you not to shake me up. It\u2019s getting harder for me to hold back.\u201dHis explanation was roundabout, but the main point was simple. Sehun was being shaken up by Yoonshin. Yoonshin didn\u2019t quite believe it, but apparently, Sehun was holding back something, and it was hard on him. Sehun\u2019s labyrinthian heart was opaque to Yoonshin. And perhaps Yoonshin finally lost his mind because when he heard that, he wanted to know more intimately about the inner workings of the other man\u2019s mind.Yoonshin was dumbstruck from trying to get a grip on his turbulent mind and missed his chance to reply. Sehun calmly added, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re someone that I can always fire.\u201dDid he mean Yoonshin should never bring this topic up again?\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cYeah. If you get it, go back to work.\u201dJust when Yoonshin thought he could finally take a step toward closing the gap between them, Sehun immediately threw him another threat-like warning. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t blatantly refused often, so he had no idea how to react after being coldly rejected twice.Yoonshin swallowed back his humiliation, clenched his jaws, and tried to laugh it off nonchalantly. \u201cYes, I understand. Have a safe trip.\u201dYoonshin bowed and stood for a while. Sehun stared at him for a moment, then he walked away. The figure of his flexible back grew smaller until he got in the car and disappeared from Yoonshin\u2019s view.Only after the rumbling motor of the car disappeared from the garage completely did Yoonshin pull down the trembling corners of his lips.Thinking back to what Sehun said, Yoonshin got enraged too late. \u201cDid he just call me a flaw in my face? What am I, the error of his life?\u201dWho was the one who shook Yoonshin up by doing things like kissing his necktie in the first place? Sehun did everything as he liked, and now, he called it a mistake?Yoonshin\u2019s judgment of Sehun that he started to carry in his heart was not wrong.Sehun was a sadist.\u201cB*stard. F*ck you,\u201d Yoonshin cursed, then he indignantly got on the elevator that was waiting for him all along.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - DefectYoonshin\u2019s face grew dark when he glanced at the calendar on his desk. Tomorrow was the blind date.He wondered what it would have been like if he hadn\u2019t known anything. If he had continued to believe that his sister was still having a peaceful married life, he would have accepted his meeting with a lighter heart. After the first meeting, if he felt that it was a good connection, he would marry her, or if not, he would politely apologize and split up.But that wasn\u2019t the case anymore. Seeing that his sister asked him to do this, she was dealing with her issues with fortitude, but she seemed to be backed into a corner. If this marriage went badly, Yoonshin couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how disadvantaged his sister would be. He felt anxious enough to make him want to deal with a passionate first love somewhere.That was why he was grasping at straws.\u201cI don\u2019t want my life to have any defects.\u201d\u201cI get madder the more I think of it,\u201d Yoonshin muttered.Yoonshin was an accomplice by closing his eyes before kissing, but Sehun initiated it. Yoonshin was upset that Sehun tried to dryly dump all the blame despite remembering everything.Of course, Sehun was free to reach out to Yoonshin or not. Yoonshin respected other people\u2019s autonomy. However, if Sehun was going to turn his back when at a critical point and continue to confuse Yoonshin, that was clearly Sehun\u2019s negligence. When Sehun, who never opened even a hair\u2019s breadth of his heart to anyone, kept opening the invisible room for possibilities, Yoonshin started to want to rely on him when he was feeling anxious.Yoonshin took a deep breath to empty his thoughts and fixed his gaze on the laptop monitor. While downloading documents that he needed from the firm\u2019s intranet, the personnel directory caught his eyes. When he searched up Sehun, a list of Sehun\u2019s academic background, law associations and boards, his case experiences, and specialty areas popped up.\u2018Corporate mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, private investments, securities regulations.\u2019\u00a0The most recent items on the list were related to his external legal advisor work. However, when he scrolled further down, there were some family matters, which Yoonshin didn\u2019t expect. They must have been the pro bono cases that Sehun mentioned at one point.\u201cHe also did a guardianship case. Wills, legal portions, division of estates\u2026\u201d Yoonshin mumbled out loud.Quite surprisingly, he also worked on matters on the division of property after divorce and lawsuits on parental rights. However, they were all long in the past. Even if Sehun took on Ikyung\u2019s divorce matter, he would most likely represent his brother-in-law.If Yoonshin met Sehun in court, Yoonshin wasn\u2019t confident that he would win. Cracking a rock with an egg could be easier.Just because his sister told him to stay put didn\u2019t mean that Yoonshin could take his hands off the matter. He needed to do something on his end. But since he didn\u2019t know what the situation was like, his starting point was vague. He was met with an obstacle at the first step.\u2018Sehun Kang surely wouldn\u2019t share his informants since that\u2019s a valuable resource,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought.Strict confidentiality meant that it needed to be kept that way. Sehun used some illegal routes contrary to a lawyer\u2019s professional ethics since he didn\u2019t even show his informants to Mihee. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t just go and ask Sehun to look into his sister\u2019s domestic situation. Yoonshin would need to offer a proportionate compensation or show his cards to Sehun.\u2018Maybe I could just be honest and beg for help,\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought, then he recalled the other\u2019s haughty and self-righteous gaze and abandoned the thought. \u201cLike he would help at all.\u201dNo matter how talented a lawyer Sehun was, it was a huge venture to turn a conglomerate like Soohan against him. In particular, since the firm was in a close relationship with Soohan, that move would negatively impact the firm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - DateIf Sehun won the case, he would only gain a slight profit and some recognition from having his name in the news, but Sehun already had enough of both. Yoonshin would have to persuade him with something that Sehun didn\u2019t have, but he couldn\u2019t put his finger on what Sehun wanted.Yoonshin had a faint suspicion that Sehun wanted Yoonshin, but despite the flustering experience of sharing an indirect kiss through a tie, Sehun\u2019s reaction was quite frosty.\u201cDon\u2019t say a word to anyone. Got it?\u201d\u00a0Yoonshin recalled his sister\u2019s warning, which made it feel riskier to express his concerns to Sehun without collateral. Knowing Sehun, he could always stand on Soohan\u2019s side.Defeated, Yoonshin closed the window and glanced at a certain book on his shelf. It was\u00a0Great Expectations.After watching Yoonshin\u2019s trial, what did Sehun unearth from the quote that he used from the book?The main character, Pip, was a laborer, but he inherits an inordinate fortune and changes his life by entering high society. In that process, he comes to understand what is truly important. Values, not gold, were the light of life.Yoonshin flipped the book to a page where he stuck a sticky tab, and the beautiful prose of Dickens entered his field of vision.\u201cI am not aware\u2026that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person, my dear. \u2026Thinking is easy enough\u2026 What is easier, you know?\u201dThis part reminded him of his own mind that circled back to Sehun all the time. After flipping toward the back, he found the page that he dog-eared because he thought it described Sehun perfectly.\u201c\u2026I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt\u2026 But you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no \u2013 sympathy \u2013 sentiment \u2013 nonsense.\u201d\u201cYoonshin Do.\u201dWhat did Sehun want to tell him back when he called him out in his dashing voice?Yoonshin closed the cover of the book and put it back in place. Leaning limply forward, he pressed his cheek against the desk protector to cool his cheek that started to burn up from the thought of the other man.He glanced at his phone, but the palm-sized device did not ring.* * *After parking in front of the large front gates, Yoonshin opened the passenger door of the car. The woman carefully set foot on the ground and pressed the doorbell. She bid farewell to Yoonshin politely, \u201cThank you for driving me back. Take care on your way.\u201dYoonshin wordlessly nodded at his date, who grinned shyly at him. He watched until she disappeared inside the gate of her house before he turned to the driver\u2019s seat.Then, the woman suddenly came back out and grabbed his sleeve. \u201cAttorney Do, won\u2019t you ask for a follow-up? Or were you going to ask me by phone?\u201dSurprised, Yoonshin took a moment before he said, \u201cOh, right. This was my first blind date.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had several already, so I\u2019ll ask. Can we meet again sometime soon? I want to meet again before the year ends,\u201d the woman asked.\u201cActually, it hasn\u2019t been that long since I entered Doguk. I\u2019m a bit busy trying to learn the ropes these days. Could I let you know once I get a feel for my situation? I can\u2019t give you an exact date right now.\u201d\u201cAre you refusing my offer?\u201d\u201cI figured that it\u2019s better to approach cautiously rather than being unable to keep my promise. I\u2019ll contact you for sure,\u201d Yoonshin replied.She seemed convinced as Yoonshin didn\u2019t seem to be lying. After going back into her front door, she waved at Yoonshin. Yoonshin finally got in his car when she completely vanished from sight. Yoonshin\u2019s face on the way back home was relieved of all tension.He learned a lot of things today when he met the woman for the first time. Several months ago, the woman saw the article about Yoonshin defending a famous athlete, who was accused of murdering her husband. Yoonshin was told that she asked around to secure a meeting with the view for marriage, which surprised him.She then happened to learn that her father\u2019s mass media corporation was on good terms with Soohan Group. Plus, her family had a good impression of Yoonshin because Yoonshin\u2019s father was a respectable figure in law.Yoonshin knew well that one meeting wasn\u2019t enough to make a judgment on a person\u2019s character. Even so, he didn\u2019t get a bad feeling from the other person, and they could talk easily with each other. He could also tell that she was greatly interested in him.It was all good up to that point. The problem was that everything was going too smoothly. She said upfront that she wanted to get to know him slowly and hold the marriage when the time was right. However, Yoonshin felt encumbered because he couldn\u2019t disassociate this situation with his sister. His brother-in-law was no longer an ally to Yoonshin.Yoonshin hoped that he could put out the most pressing fire first, but it was one obstacle after another.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Date\u2018Now what do I do?\u2019\u00a0His throat felt sandy like he caught a cold. He loosened up his faultless necktie and flinched when he felt the silky fabric. He fiddled with the tie unconsciously, then while he was at the stoplight, he pressed his lips on the bottom of the tie. Not surprisingly, he felt nothing.He was clenching and releasing the fabric like he was crumpling a piece of paper when his cell phone vibrated. He dropped his tie and took the call, hands-free. He felt more anxious as it was from his sister.\u201cIkyung?\u201d This was the first time he had a phone call with her since she came over to his apartment.\u201cYoonshin, is now an okay time to talk?\u201d Her voice sounded much better, making Yoonshin somewhat relieved.\u201cI\u2019m driving, but the speed limit is low here, so I can talk. How did you know to call? Did that family tell you that I met her?\u201d\u201cYeah. Apparently, she was raving as soon as she got home. How come you never dated anyone when you could captivate a woman\u2019s heart like that? You had girlfriends when you were still in school, but you stopped meeting anyone once you became a lawyer.\u201d\u201cWell, that was because I was quite busy. I was younger back then, but meeting someone was too burdensome because I had to also consider marriage.\u201d\u201cYou should start to consider that now. She said you were easy to talk with and kind yet manly. She said she liked you a lot. That\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cMy reaction was probably good because she was also a good person.\u201dIkyung must have thought this was a positive sign as her voice brightened up. \u201cDo you like her? That\u2019s even better.\u201d\u201cShe wasn\u2019t bad. I could probably marry her, but I don\u2019t think I could love her.\u201dAs joyful as she was, she found his reply to be odd and asked back, her voice a few decibels higher, \u201cHow do you know after one meeting?\u201dYoonshin could tell, vaguely. This wasn\u2019t the woman\u2019s fault. This was completely on him.Throughout the conversation, Yoonshin could only think of another person. It wasn\u2019t charged with like or hate\u2014he simply kept thinking about the other man. He wanted to stop, so he tried to push the other man out of his mind. Yet Sehun filled his brain, completely dominating it. He couldn\u2019t begin to express how guilty he felt by thinking of another person while sitting across from his prospective marriage partner.Yoonshin felt like he would never be able to forget this strange feeling he got today. For as long as he remembered that funny feeling, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see the other person who was with him rationally. Yoonshin was slightly more conscientious than the average person in that way.\u201cI just got the feeling. It\u2019s like an intuition of sorts,\u201d he said.Part of it was his sister\u2019s situation, but another part was because of Sehun, who littered his mind. Yoonshin didn\u2019t tell her that though because he thought it would be overly complicated to explain everything.\u201cIt could change after the second and third meeting. Love isn\u2019t all about something glittering at first sight,\u201d Ikyung said, trying to persuade her brother.\u201cI know. But I just kept thinking that this wasn\u2019t right. We\u2019re not meant to be. I didn\u2019t like her enough to ask for a follow-up meeting. I wasn\u2019t interested in her at all,\u201d Yoonshin continued.\u201cYoonshin.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019m confused because I didn\u2019t get an electrifying feeling from the meeting. I know what it feels like to wonder about another person and want that person to be by my side.\u201dIkyung fell silent for a moment and asked in a noticeably cautious tone, \u201cDo you happen to be seeing something else? I assumed that you weren\u2019t, so I never asked.\u201dUpon hearing that question, nobody should have come to mind. After all, Yoonshin had neither a lover nor anyone close enough to call a romantic interest.But still, Sehun floated in his mind.The image of Sehun\u2019s curved and arched lips, the cold eyes that pierced through him, and his rigid fingers that sometimes touched him all whirled in his head, making a mess of it. Yoonshin hesitated briefly and replied honestly, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t want to burden you. I only wanted to protect you\u2026 And you don\u2019t usually date anyone. I just thought it was a good opportunity. If you really don\u2019t like her, I can reject the offer for you. Still, meet her a few more times, okay?\u201d Ikyung said.Yoonshin didn\u2019t reply. It didn\u2019t seem like she was expertly trying to throw a wrench in his plans just yet, so he changed the topic in consideration of Ikyung\u2019s complicated feelings. \u201cAre you holding on well? If you showed up like that again, I don\u2019t think I could last.\u201dWhen he brought up his concerns that he had pushed down in his heart, she let out a sigh.\u201cWorry about yourself. I\u2019ve only bumped into Attorney Sehun Kang a few times, so I don\u2019t know him well, but he\u2019s very irritable and cold. But you said you were hanging on well. Attorney Song was praising you to the skies. Although that could just be empty praise to satisfy me.\u201dYoonshin automatically thought back to the dinner where he saw Mihee and Sehun. Yoonshin looked sincere and tilted his head slightly to the side. He tried to imagine what face his sister would make if he said that his thoughts were chaotic because of Sehun. He didn\u2019t think she would be very welcome to that, so he decided not to mention it.\u201cI have a lot to learn,\u201d he said instead.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear.\u201d\u201cHey, Ikyung, I told you this before, but I\u2019m a lawyer too. I know you don\u2019t have great faith in me, but let me know if you ever need my help,\u201d Yoonshin said.Ikyung chuckled at the sweetness of her brother, which in turn melted Yoonshin\u2019s heart with affection.\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring. Thank you. Let\u2019s hang up now. You should concentrate on driving,\u201d Ikyung said.Yoonshin understood that Ikyung didn\u2019t want to continue the topic. He wanted to go against her wishes internally, but as usual, Yoonshin agreed good-naturedly and bid her well, telling her to hang up first, \u201cOkay. It\u2019s late. Good night.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Promise To Meet\u201cOkay, be careful on your way back,\u201d Ikyung said before she hung up.Upon ending the phone call, Yoonshin\u2019s grip on the steering wheel tightened. Palms sweaty, he felt as though a thick fog filled his surroundings, obstructing his vision. He was scared, but there was nothing else he could grip. Yoonshin was feeling this hopeless\u2014his sister must be having it worse. So, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell her that he didn\u2019t want to meet his potential partner anymore.He was only coming back from a date, but why did he feel like he committed a crime? He felt guilty toward the woman, Sehun, and himself.He let out a heavy sigh, and his expression grew cloudier. His eyes glazed over with tumult despite trying to concentrate on driving.Was there any way out?There was one trick that could solve all his obstacles, but the only person who could do that was very defensive, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t find the right timing to bring it up.\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t care whether I wanted an excuse or confession\u2026\u201d As Yoonshin recounted the conversation after Sehun held him back, his thoughts became as chaotic as rush hour where cars were honking in all directions. On one hand, it was understandable that Yoonshin would be confused by Sehun. Sehun, who was always clear-cut about right and wrong, made a critical error. While he said that the risqu\u00e9 situation was a mistake, he mentioned that he was being shaken up by Yoonshin.What were his true feelings?Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure but figured it was both.That incident was a terrible mistake made on Sehun\u2019s part, and at the same time, it was getting more difficult for him to handle Yoonshin. The cryptic words he left to the silent Yoonshin confirmed that.\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder for me to hold back.\u201d\u00a0Sehun had said.\u2018What part of me is making it hard for him to hold back? He clearly wanted to kiss me\u2026\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought, then it occurred to him,\u00a0\u2018Does he want to sleep with me?\u2019Yoonshin\u2019s imagination that was running wildly stained his cheeks red. Perhaps he went a bit too far. Although nobody was watching, he felt embarrassed, so much so that just then, when he saw the company residences, he swerved into the adjacent lane without thinking. He was so flustered and his change of lanes was so abrupt that it warranted the drivers nearby to honk angrily at him.Beep beep! Beep beep!\u201cAck\u2026\u201d Yoonshin gasped.Even though the speed limit was low, he could have caused an accident. He blinked his emergency lights a few times in apology and took deep breaths before turning to the entrance of the building.He smoothly glided into the basement parking garage and parked. He felt like clearing his mind with some fresh air, so he headed upstairs via the emergency stairwell.Upon going outside, he stared up at the extravagant company residence building. He aimed his gaze up at Sehun\u2019s floor, then he observed it intently. He tried to shoot some telepathic waves at Sehun, who wouldn\u2019t listen to him anyway, then quit, wondering what the point of it was.Yoonshin headed to the right of the road toward the 24-hour caf\u00e9 he frequented. He ordered a coffee and took a seat on the inner side of the caf\u00e9 where the counter couldn\u2019t see him. The residents of the complex usually used this place, and considering that it was late, there were no people inside.As he listened to the classical music tickling his ear while fiddling with his mug, Yoonshin took out his phone.\u2018He\u2019s not going to call till the bitter end, huh?\u2019\u00a0he thought.Yoonshin didn\u2019t like to leave things hanging, no matter the subject. He found the other\u2019s name and hovered his fingers over it before resolutely calling the other man. He didn\u2019t have high hopes that the other man would pick up because he rested on the weekends, but Sehun responded quite fast.\u201cYes?\u201d Sehun answered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Promise to Meet\u201cOh, you picked up. I didn\u2019t expect you to since I\u2019m calling late on a weekend,\u201d Yoonshin replied.\u201cYou weren\u2019t calling because of work? Summarize in less than five words,\u201d Sehun said callously.\u201cIt\u2019s not because of work but personal reasons.\u201d\u201cYou called for personal reasons. That\u2019s over five words. I see.\u201d\u201cYes, so I was\u2014\u201d Just then, the call ended abruptly. Yoonshin didn\u2019t even get to his main subject. Taken aback, Yoonshin looked at his phone, wondering if his device broke or the battery lost juice, but Sehun truly did hang up on him.Frustrated, Yoonshin tried to call him again. Sehun didn\u2019t pick up despite the call ringing several times, so Yoonshin sent a message as if he had something important and work-related. When he called again, thankfully, Yoonshin heard the other man.\u201cSay it in five words,\u201d was how Sehun answered the call.Yoonshin counted the words that he wanted to say with his fingers, then he hurriedly replied, \u201cLet\u2019s meet up now!\u201dThe other man didn\u2019t react for a moment. Then, a beat later, he asked, \u201cWhy should I meet you? Today\u2019s Sunday.\u201d\u201cDid you have dinner? If you haven\u2019t, let\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cI ate. You would have already eaten too, no?\u201d\u201cThen, how about coffee? I\u2019ll buy you a cup.\u201d\u201cI drank already. My veins are already pulsing with caffeine.\u201d\u201cThen, aren\u2019t you going on a walk tonight? The snow piled up on the trees in the park behind the building is very pretty.\u201d\u201cI walk when I need to think. Walking with someone is distracting. Is that all you have to say? Then hang up.\u201dAs Sehun was about to one-sidedly hang up again, Yoonshin changed his tactic to the offensive. \u201cThis is what people call giving room for opportunity. When I sent you the message, you knew that I didn\u2019t have anything work-related to talk about. Yet you still picked up. You\u2019re either a suuuuper loose and easy person, or you\u2019re interested in me. Isn\u2019t the latter more palatable than the former?\u201dSehun\u2019s appearance was excellent, but he was just that\u2014Yoonshin wasn\u2019t gay, to begin with, so he couldn\u2019t arouse any other emotion. He was envious of the other\u2019s well-stacked career, but knowing the rough trajectory of it, he didn\u2019t completely look up to Sehun. Even so, Yoonshin kept being swept up by him. His concern for Sehun evolved, making him want to get more involved with the older man.Yoonshin\u2019s desire was projected in his question, and the other laughed hollowly. That subdued sound was strangely soft and sweet, lingering in Yoonshin\u2019s ears and flustering him.\u201cNarcissism is your hobby, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t you think I might have picked up by giving you the benefit of the doubt and for the possibility that you really had something work-related to say?\u201d\u201cNo, you definitely knew that I wasn\u2019t going to talk about work.\u201d His second attempt at approaching Sehun was shot down. However, Yoonshin felt like he needed to try one last time to not regret anything. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s hurting. My head hurts because of you too.\u201dPerhaps that was a more critical hit than anything else he had said because a sigh followed instead of a reply. Yoonshin didn\u2019t think he had ever heard such a deep and heavy sigh coming from Sehun before. Yoonshin instinctively knew that this was the prime opportunity to bring up the topic for conversation, so he bit his lower lip. \u201cDid you forget that I had a blind date today?\u201d\u201cDo I look like a goldfish to you? I remember,\u201d Sehun retorted.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t call me.\u201d\u201cWas there a rule that said I had to call? You should have told me.\u201d\u201cDid you make me call you on purpose, or do you truly have no interest in me?\u201dSehun didn\u2019t reply, so Yoonshin pressed on harder, \u201cI just came back from my prospective marriage meeting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Promise To MeetYoonshin braced himself to hear a defensive retort like, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m your boyfriend or something?\u201d or \u201cWhy are you bothering me?\u201d but surprisingly, Sehun had nothing to say. Rather, that was why Yoonshin got the courage to say what he wanted to.He wasn\u2019t sure why it was Sehun Kang. It might be because Sehun accepted everything as it was without any bias and could forget about it all if needed.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to get pushed into marriage like this. There are too many things that bother me about it. But my sister would be put in a bad position if I stopped here because she was the matchmaker. What should I do? You think of all the possibilities and the solutions to them,\u201d Yoonshin rambled.\u201cFourth-year, how much did I say a 10-minute consultation with me was?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at everything like a potential case to be retained on. It\u2019s even in the code of ethics for lawyers. Article One: a lawyer protects and enhances human rights and freedoms\u2026\u201dSehun cut him off mid-sentence and threw the solution to Yoonshin irritably, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll give you the answer. It\u2019s simple. Go study overseas. People usually go in their fifth year, so you could just go a few months in advance. Go get licensed to practice and spend a few years there. When you come back, it\u2019ll all be solved.\u201d\u201cI can come up with that much too. But I can\u2019t leave Korea any time soon.\u201d\u201cWhy not? Do you think you\u2019re a patriotic martyr?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of my sister.\u201d\u201cYeah, so what about it?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the details. There\u2019s just a thing like that.\u201dBetween the impulse to spill everything against his sister\u2019s warning for advice and his rationality telling him not to leak anything without any countermeasures in place, Yoonshin put his palm over the opening of the still-warm mug. While he was appreciating the warmth, Sehun continued in his subdued voice, \u201cI can\u2019t take on a case that I don\u2019t know all the details of. Think for yourself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very cold today.\u201d Yoonshin looked out the window and stared blankly at the pitch-black sky. The stars were faint, but he could feel that they were glittering brightly. He couldn\u2019t see them from where he was, but he imagined that Sehun also glanced out the window then. \u201cAnd I wish someone was beside me right now. I\u2019m lonely.\u201d\u201cCall the woman you went on a date with,\u201d Sehun shot back.\u201cHey, we live in the same building, yet you\u2019re so cold. Am I that much of an eyesore to you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that you\u2019re earnest about everything. I\u2019m temperamentally unsuited with clean people.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you raising me? Your innocent lamb is suffering and slowly dying here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bury you at least as a means of staff welfare.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just save me instead? I\u2019m in the caf\u00e9 in front of the building. The place where we bumped into each other last time.\u201d\u201cDamn it,\u201d he heard the other man mutter quietly. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure he heard correctly because Sehun mumbled with the mic away from him. Yoonshin pressed his device to his ear and fumbled with his mug handle. It felt nice to be rubbing it to the point that it squeaked.While they spent time individually, silence hung over them both. It went on and on. Yoonshin looked at his screen, worried that Sehun hung up, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Sehun seemed to be thinking about it.\u201cAttorney Kang, how long should I wait? Ten minutes? Fifteen minutes?\u201d Yoonshin asked, unable to maintain the silence longer.\u201cOne hour,\u201d Sehun replied tersely.\u201cYou weren\u2019t at home right now?\u201d\u201cI am at home. Still, one hour.\u201d After saying what he wanted, Sehun hung up on Yoonshin just like last time. Dumbfounded, Yoonshin looked down at his now-black screen and wrinkled his brow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Test CaseIf he was going to come down anyway, couldn\u2019t he at least say it nicely?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought but then chuckled at himself for getting used to this irritable man.\u201cSo bad-tempered. It\u2019s because it\u2019s me that I\u2019m debating whether to pick you up or not. Just know that you\u2019re lucky.\u201d Yoonshin rapped his knuckles once on his screen, then he went up to the counter. His steps had a light spring to them. As he ordered a drink for Sehun, a grin blossomed on his face.* * *Sehun, in casual clothes, got off the elevator and checked his wristwatch.He told the other to wait an hour, but he was the one who couldn\u2019t sit still and got out of his house. After following the path that he frequented when he had a lot to think about, he saw Yoonshin sitting at the bar table along the window like last time. What was different from before was that instead of working, he looked deep in thought.As he approached Yoonshin, the younger man jumped up and greeted Sehun, presumably sooner than he expected. When he saw that innocent smile, Sehun felt his insides twist.Barely swallowing back his irritation, Sehun went around the building and entered the caf\u00e9. Yoonshin must have ordered Sehun\u2019s drink in advance because he picked it up from the pick-up counter and waved at Sehun.Yoonshin said, \u201cHere you go. I put one more shot than my drink because you seem to like it bitter.\u201dSehun stared at Yoonshin as the younger man placed the coffee on the table before taking the seat next to the younger man. Yoonshin, the one who invited Sehun, spoke first, \u201cYou came earlier than I expected.\u201d\u201cYou could wait if you like. Do you want to do that?\u201dAs a loss for words, Yoonshin stared at Sehun, then he turned his torso away from Sehun. Then, he took a sip from his already cold drink.The transparent window reflected the two men\u2019s images. Yoonshin was in a neat suit while Sehun was in a thick cable-knit sweater\u2014they contrasted each other. Another silence flowed between them before Yoonshin once again interrupted it. \u201cYou dressed so thinly for it being winter. You should have put on a coat.\u201d\u201cWhy should I when I\u2019m in my neighborhood?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice if I just\u2014bam!\u2014took off my jacket for you all coolly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nice. Strip.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a coat because I came by car, so I\u2019m cold.\u201d\u201cThere it is\u2014your superficial respect for me.\u201d\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201dSehun scoffed, and Yoonshin smiled along. Then, the younger man asked, \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\u201cWork.\u201d\u201cAt home? Today\u2019s an off-day.\u201d\u201cI work in my car, I work in my dreams, and naturally, I work at home.\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re sitting here having coffee with me, that means you made time for me.\u201dInstead of denying it, the older man spun the facts slightly. \u201cI\u2019m doing pro bono work of sorts.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you be a bit more sincere about my matter then? Why aren\u2019t you asking about the details? I met with a prospective marriage partner.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not curious about a story with a defined ending. You said so yourself that unless there is some unforeseen event, you\u2019d just go with the flow until marriage. I\u2019m not interested in a rally where I can\u2019t shift your paradigm.\u201d\u201cStrictly speaking, you\u2019re just afraid to cause the shift, or you\u2019re just not interested enough to put up with the hassle,\u201d Yoonshin retorted.Sehun turned his head at that. He made such an irritated face, as if all his nerves were inflamed, and glowered at Yoonshin. Despite the glare, Yoonshin had no reason not to look back, so he locked eyes with the older man. The other\u2019s pupils, deep as the bottom of the ocean, were filled with Yoonshin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Test Case\u201cFourth-year, why are you acting like this? You\u2019ve become strange. I\u2019m not that insensitive that I can\u2019t feel that change. Why are you poking at me?\u201d Sehun asked.There was no way Sehun didn\u2019t know that Yoonshin was continuously feeling him out, and Yoonshin was vaguely aware of it. Sehun read that from Yoonshin\u2019s quivering eyes and added, \u201cI\u2019m good at reading people. You don\u2019t like me\u2014at least, not in\u00a0that\u00a0way.\u201dIn one way, Sehun was right. However, there was one pitfall. Yoonshin\u2019s feelings for Sehun weren\u2019t as simple to be summarized in one sentence. Although it was true that he didn\u2019t like Sehun \u201cin\u00a0that\u00a0way\u201d yet, Sehun was the only one that Yoonshin was currently open to having romantic feelings for.Yoonshin thought about how to express his ambiguous feelings, then he slowly said, \u201cI am interested in you though. I want to know what kind of person you are. Sometimes\u2026 I get confused by you. You must know since you\u2019re so good at reading people.\u201dSehun didn\u2019t deny that logic because Yoonshin was right.Yoonshin felt Sehun\u2019s intense stare heating up. When the older man\u2019s languid gaze and Yoonshin\u2019s tense eyes met, Yoonshin felt a peculiar ache squeezing his heart. Yoonshin said in a low voice, \u201cIf I just got married before we could try anything when we had the chance, wouldn\u2019t that be a loss for both of us?\u201d\u201cWhy is that my loss?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re upset about it, you could just say it\u2019s my loss. I don\u2019t want to lose.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send you off to a well-off family, yet why do you have so many things you don\u2019t like? Marriage is also business. Use it to your advantage.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I keep thinking that it\u2019s wrong.\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t bring himself to explain that feeling and hung his head instead. Sehun watched quietly, then he reached out for the mug, displeased with Yoonshin. After a sip of the steaming hot coffee, he placidly said while staring at the cup in his hands, \u201cYou should have expected that much the moment your sister married into Soohan. Resent your father for allowing the marriage and your sister for marrying. I\u2019m not your dear diary.\u201dHis long fingers wrapped firmly around the handle of the mug. Upon spitting out his calm and cool words, he took one more sip of coffee. That moment, Yoonshin retorted quietly, quiet enough that he could be talking to himself, \u201cIf you were going to be like this, why did you kiss me? You must have felt pressed, pushing in your tongue first like that.\u201dClunk. Yoonshin\u2019s utterance made Sehun lose his grip on the mug, making it slip and fall instead of being set on the table. The wobbling cup dropped on the tray.Clatter! The mug hit the hard surface and spun like a top. Black liquid tipped and surged in the cup\u2019s mouth before it ultimately spilled on Sehun\u2019s hand.Sehun grimaced at the burning sensation on his hand. \u201cUgh, hot. Damn it.\u201dSurprised, Yoonshin took out a handkerchief from his jacket\u2019s inner pocket. He started to wipe off the fluid from Sehun\u2019s hand, then Sehun snatched the cloth away and wiped himself off. Still, Yoonshin grabbed the other man\u2019s hand and turned it over several times, inspecting it for any burns. He saw that the web between the older man\u2019s long index and middle finger was red, so he rubbed that spot with his fingers. \u201cOh no, are you all right?\u201d\u201cLet go.\u201d\u201cDoes it hurt? Should I go and buy some ointment? There should be some in the convenience store. Or if you have a first aid kit at your place\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m reaching the limit of my patience, so let my hand go. I told you, it\u2019s hard to hold back!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Test CaseYoonshin needed some time to comprehend what Sehun meant. He tried thinking pessimistically, yet it seemed that Sehun\u2019s true feelings matched what he had imagined back in the car. Yoonshin grew embarrassed but held onto Sehun\u2019s hand for several seconds more before Sehun yanked his hands away.\u201cMove. I shouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d Sehun said.The older man tossed the handkerchief roughly on the table and left the caf\u00e9. Yoonshin hurriedly put the trays with the cups on the counter and chased after Sehun. He finally processed what the other said. Sehun was clearly shaken up, but he was unaccustomed to and displeased at himself for being so. Yoonshin also felt similarly, so he knew.Yoonshin felt like he could finally grasp at the other man.As Yoonshin picked up his pace and went down to the basement, he could see Sehun\u2019s lean figure going through the indoor arcade and into the apartment complex. As soon as he saw him, Yoonshin popped his head out to let the other know of his presence. It was meant to implicitly ask why Sehun was ignoring him despite knowing that he was following, but he was immediately shut down. Yoonshin stood up straight and walked beside Sehun.\u201cBy any chance, if the firm has any receivership cases, could you put me on that? Files that get a lot of work in a short timeframe, I could probably buy enough time. I pushed back the second meeting. I thought it would be rude of me to meet that woman when I felt like this.\u201d Yoonshin promised the next meeting with a vague timeline, but he couldn\u2019t keep pushing it back indefinitely. He thought it would be nice if he had an excuse to hide briefly.\u201cNot only do we not have cases like that right now, how dare a junior vie for a receivership case without anything to show? No,\u201d Sehun said, rejecting Yoonshin\u2019s plea.\u201cThe number of years of experience one has isn\u2019t everything. You\u2019re the prime example of that. There are no other partners with your years in such a large-scale law firm like Doguk. If it\u2019s anything like organizing a labor relations log, I can do it well. I\u2019m confident that I can produce a concise application to the court. If not, I\u2019m also happy with doing the most work-intensive file our team has.\u201d\u201cI work with people who can find 10 solutions to one question. Your DNA is still closer to an uptight human rights lawyer. Societal success, massive payback, or immense accomplishment\u2014I\u2019ll give you a big one if any of these worldly goals get included in your category of desire. Climb up steadily from the trenches.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very desperate. I don\u2019t want to lie. I just need work that makes me spend all-nighters every day,\u201d Yoonshin said.Sehun finally stopped walking down the tranquil hall and turned to look at Yoonshin. The older man\u2019s handsome and formerly expressionless face now had a slight hint of a frown. Looking in the direction against the chilly wind, Yoonshin stared back at Sehun, who stood in front of him.\u201cYou want me to give you work because you want to escape from the reality that you\u2019re faced with. Don\u2019t you think you would be deceiving the other person? What\u2019s different from that and lying? You\u2019re already not being honest,\u201d Sehun said.He hit the bull\u2019s eye. Yoonshin nodded, admitting to everything Sehun said. Sehun, who was watching Yoonshin earnestly, carefully added his advice. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one warning. If you keep glossing things over, you can\u2019t solve anything. The core is the essence of the matter, and the essence is the core of the matter. You\u2019re not the type to hate having a blind date. You think that any meeting can spark a relationship. The first problem you need to solve is why you don\u2019t want that marriage.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Tryst\u201cHow do I solve it?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cAs I said, you\u2019re acting strange these days. I see pent-up frustration in your eyes that I normally don\u2019t see in people like you. Plus, your only strengths are being honest and candid, but those are faint. You can start there,\u201d Sehun pointed out.Sehun knew practically nothing about the situation, yet his comment struck at Yoonshin\u2019s key concerns. One concern was Sehun, who stood before him, and the other was his sister\u2019s situation.However, the latter was a conflict so massive that it was impossible to solve by himself. Plus, it was technically not Yoonshin\u2019s business. He oscillated between telling Sehun and the worry that this would get his sister into a stickier situation. Yoonshin spoke before he knew it. \u201cSenior Attorney, so you see\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d Sehun cut him off.\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019ll want to listen to your request. I don\u2019t want more things to think about.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right, the pro bono ends here.\u201dSehun was about to turn and leave Yoonshin in the dimly lit corner. Frustrated that all he saw was Sehun\u2019s back, Yoonshin tugged at the older man\u2019s sleeve. His hands slowly traveled lower. They passed the other\u2019s firm and bony wrist before lightly grasping the soft hand of the other. Sehun flinched. He was about to push him away when Yoonshin grabbed the older man\u2019s hand firmly.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, Fourth-year?\u201d Sehun asked sharply.Yoonshin paused momentarily, then he slowly leaned toward Sehun. He leaned his head toward the other\u2019s chest and rested his forehead against it.\u201cHave you heard the saying, that the greatest weakness is the fear of showing your weakness?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d\u201cA flaw formed in your life the moment you feared that I would become a flaw in your life.\u201dSehun didn\u2019t reply. Yoonshin stepped closer, leaning in deeper into the older man\u2019s chest. Sehun took a sharp intake of breath, and Yoonshin could feel the rise and fall of Sehun\u2019s chest. Yoonshin calmly closed his eyes.Yoonshin felt lonely enduring his difficulties, but Sehun magically appeared before him. Perhaps Yoonshin was the one who searched for Sehun.\u201cYoonshin Do,\u201d Sehun said in a low voice.Yoonshin liked the low rumbling tone of the other\u2019s voice when he called his name. He felt as though he could hear the other\u2019s heart beating loudly, which he also liked. Sehun might not believe it, but Yoonshin also liked how Sehun\u2019s hand twitched, conflicted between whether he should turn around and hold the younger man.When that thought hit him, Yoonshin\u2019s initial intention to calm his heart in Sehun\u2019s embrace shattered. Yoonshin felt his heart starting to pound. At a loss for what to do, he could only gasp when Sehun pushed the other man away.Sehun took a few steps back and put distance between them, staring intently at Yoonshin. Sehun\u2019s expression slowly grew complex. He seemed a bit diffident and slightly angry.\u201cDid you just get dumped by a woman you had a crush on for 20 years?\u201d Sehun asked.It was so out of the blue that Yoonshin tilted his head in confusion. \u201cNo, but I did go on a blind date.\u201dBesides, Yoonshin had never had a crush on anyone before.\u201cThen, did you get severely defrauded? Did you burn through the entirety of the inheritance your father left you?\u201d\u201cMy father didn\u2019t leave a lot behind. I did buy a house with my share of my mother\u2019s estate and my sister\u2019s assistance. That\u2019s for the security of my later years in life.\u201dOnce Sehun heard that, his face twisted in utter confusion. \u201cThen, why do you look like you\u2019ll cry again?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Tryst\u201cMe? I\u2019m not going to cry at all.\u201d Yoonshin felt his face with his hand. Unlike Sehun\u2019s concern, Yoonshin didn\u2019t feel any dampness. However, his vision did seem slightly blurry. He felt hurt when Sehun pushed him and backed away like he was the plague.Just the other day, Yoonshin thought that it didn\u2019t matter what Sehun thought of him. Why was he so upset now? Apparently, his face was showing how bad he felt.After a few more pats with nothing coming off on his hands, Yoonshin dropped his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s because you pushed me away. You might think I don\u2019t have strong opinions, but I get hurt too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re making that face? Do you expect me to believe that?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t change the truth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy am I acting like this? I keep thinking about your feelings. Are you going to continue to reject me?\u201dDuring that time, people were passing by the arcade, so Sehun grabbed Yoonshin\u2019s hand and pulled him to a more secluded place.Under the shadows, the two men\u2019s hands were still touching. Reacting late, Yoonshin was worried that the older man would push him away again, even though Sehun initiated it this time. He reflexively tried to let go, but Sehun prevented him from doing so by pulling his hand. It wasn\u2019t just that. Sehun\u2019s fingers interlocked with his, closing the gaps between their fingers.\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d Yoonshin was about to ask. Sehun released his hand and wrapped it around the back of Yoonshin\u2019s head. He placed his other hand on Yoonshin\u2019s back, pulling him closer. Their bodies pressed against each other. Yoonshin\u2019s jacket rustled against Sehun\u2019s sweater. They each heard the other\u2019s heartbeat.Yoonshin realized Sehun hugged him voluntarily.All along, Yoonshin needed moments like these\u2014moments where another person comforted him with their warmth.From the moment he met his sister in front of his home until now, Yoonshin felt so sorrowful and scared.Although it may be trivial for some, it wasn\u2019t to Yoonshin. His sister was the only family he had left. Her children couldn\u2019t replace her. When he saw the strangulation marks on her neck, he was scared that she would face greater danger and he would lose her as well. He couldn\u2019t tell anyone, so his anxiety only deepened.\u201cYou\u2019re warm.\u201d There was a hint of tears in Yoonshin\u2019s voice. Sehun must have noticed because he pulled the younger man tighter, almost crushing him in his arms. Not only that, but he also pushed his fingers through the younger man\u2019s soft hair, stroking it gently. Yoonshin felt the pressures on his body and sighed. \u201cWhy are you hugging me? I\u2019ll take it the wrong way.\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to see your face.\u201dIt was such a Sehun-like answer that Yoonshin chuckled. He managed to raise his limp arms to hug the older man back.Yoonshin wondered whether Sehun knew that he always acted sincerely with Yoonshin despite claiming that he disliked how Yoonshin was always too sincere. While Yoonshin didn\u2019t hide his sincerity, Sehun always hid it. The warmth that confirmed Sehun\u2019s feelings just barely surfaced\u2014it meant so much to Yoonshin that he clenched Sehun\u2019s clothes tightly.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to push me away again, right?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cDid the sun rise from the other side?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cActually, I knew that.\u201dSehun chuckled softly and kissed Yoonshin\u2019s smooth hair, making the younger man freeze in surprise. Sehun sighed, then he vented in a defeated voice, \u201cThis is why I tried to keep this buried. I hate going into a losing game.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - TrystYoonshin assumed that this meant that the weight of their feelings toward each other wasn\u2019t equal. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t deny it. This stage was leaning against Sehun. But surprisingly enough, Yoonshin was the one who was psychologically more dependent on the other.Yoonshin somewhat understood what the other meant, but he thought now was a good time to ask for a clear answer. Yoonshin cast his line, slowly and cautiously. \u201cIf I\u2019m ever lonely from now on, could you\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask. I won\u2019t answer you.\u201d\u201c\u2026remain by my side?\u201d Yoonshin quickly threw the remainder of the question after Sehun interrupted. Yoonshin pursed his lips. At the same time, Sehun sighed. Yoonshin waited for a moment, but the other man didn\u2019t answer. Feeling somewhat anxious, Yoonshin added, \u201cYou\u2019ve already shown your cards, so there\u2019s no taking them back. You can turn a trial around, but you can\u2019t turn me away. I\u2019m at a cul-de-sac.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019ve never been at a cul-de-sac. You\u2019re just a kid acting like the world is falling apart from a small and insignificant misfortune. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be that big of a deal once you peel back the layers.\u201dYoonshin felt upset by Sehun\u2019s words and pushed himself away from the older man. Their eyes met.\u201cAre you done?\u201d Yoonshin snapped.\u201cI\u2019m planning on being done. I\u2019m going to do something else. I\u2019ve been wanting to kiss you this whole time, and I\u2019ve been holding back too long.\u201d Sehun yanked at Yoonshin\u2019s necktie that was awkwardly hanging over his shirt, leading Yoonshin against the wall. Even if people saw them, Yoonshin would be obscured by Sehun\u2019s back. The older man leaned in. It was different from the last time at the bar. Their lips unquestionably overlapped, and Yoonshin witnessed it all, his eyes wide open.Their lips met, then they pulled apart. Several times, their skin rubbed shallowly yet sensually.Yoonshin\u2019s throat bobbed, holding his breath as he tried to push down the tension that reached its threshold. He wanted to say something, but the moment that his lips parted, Sehun hungrily rushed into his lips. \u201cSenior Attorney, ngh!\u201dYoonshin was thrown off by how passionately their lips met, but it was momentary. Yoonshin held onto Sehun\u2019s shoulders for balance. Then, so that their lips could fit into each other better, he tilted his head in the opposite direction to Sehun. Their silky skin pattered against each other several times. Sehun tasted both Yoonshin\u2019s upper and bottom lip.Then, he slowly slipped in his tongue between the parting of the other\u2019s lips.\u201cNgh, mmph\u2026.\u201dTheir sultry flesh tangled, filling the gaps between the bumps and ridges of each other\u2019s tongues. Fluid saliva mingled with every tryst of their tongues.Yoonshin\u2019s back clattered into the shutters of a store, closed for the night. He felt as though he would succumb to gravity, so he tugged Sehun\u2019s arms closer, pulling the older man into a darker and more private corner.Sehun, making Yoonshin lean against the wall, continued to explore the younger man\u2019s glistening lips. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t used to being kissed like this\u2014he struggled, feeling breathless. Even so, Sehun refused to let him go, charging voraciously at him repeatedly.\u201cNgh, I can\u2019t\u2026b-breath\u2026!\u201d Yoonshin clung to Sehun as he tapped at the older man, begging Sehun to let go. Sehun savored the softness of Yoonshin\u2019s lips, the titillating sensation of his tongue, and the irresistible sweetness of the young man before finally pulling away. Their faces remained close to each other.Ragged sighs diffused upon each other\u2019s lips. Sehun pecked lightly at Yoonshin\u2019s chin, not wasting the time that they were apart.\u201cYou\u2019ll drool, your mouth hanging open like that.\u201dYoonshin, who was catching his uneven breath, closed his mouth in shame. Then, he narrowed his eyes, shooting a glare at Sehun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Investigation\u201cIs diving headfirst your style? You\u2019re not going to profess your love before or anything? I need some time to prepare myself mentally, to do this with another man,\u201d Yoonshin protested.Sehun grabbed Yoonshin\u2019s chin, not wanting to hear anymore. At the same time, a memory flashed in Yoonshin\u2019s head. A few months ago, in Sehun\u2019s office, Sehun had grabbed his chin, and his eyes searched Yoonshin\u2019s face. Yoonshin wondered if the older man felt a similar impulse back then. Sehun didn\u2019t seem to be pleased that Yoonshin was distracted with another thought. He growled, \u201cMy style is giving orders as a superior. Open your mouth.\u201dYoonshin obediently parted his lips. The other roughly pushed his tongue back into the dark and warm cavern of the younger man\u2019s mouth. Their flesh swept against each other like it was their first encounter.Sehun made a mess out of the inside of Yoonshin\u2019s mouth. In reply, Yoonshin\u2019s arm, with nowhere else to go, clung to Sehun\u2019s neck eagerly.Their deep, indulgent kiss, away from the eyes of others, stretched on and on into the darkest hour of the night.Act 11As Sehun flipped through the pages of the documents, he felt an uncomfortable feeling from a foreign object on his finger. On his forefinger was a bandage with crocodiles. The moment Sehun got to work, Yoonshin barged into his office and changed the bandage on the burn he got the other night. Floating in the white background, the green crocodile\u2019s black eyes glinted as it opened its jaws at Sehun.Sehun felt a bit funny as he stared at it, so he was about to take the bandage off when he heard a knock at his door.\u201cYes, come in,\u201d he responded. The door opened, and Mihee poked her head in.\u201cAttorney Kang, do you have some time?\u201d she asked.Sehun stared at Mihee from his seat. She had two envelopes, one in each hand, and they were probably the reason for Mihee\u2019s visit. Both were probably very important.\u201cIt depends on how much you need,\u201d Sehun replied.\u201cI only need a moment.\u201dHe gestured for her to come in. She closed the door behind her and sat on his office couch.\u201cSehun, I heard you had a meeting with the representative of the business administration consultation in the morning.\u201d\u201cYeah, I only had time today. But what\u2019s up? You\u2019re usually the busiest on Mondays.\u201d\u201cJust dropping by on the way. I heard that Secretary Tak picked up some pain medication at the infirmary throughout last week. Since Secretary Tak went himself, I figured that you were the culprit.\u201dSehun nodded, not feeling the need to hide that. Mihee put on a worried look. \u201cYou\u2019re healthy, so you don\u2019t need medication often. What happened? You have been like that since the dinner. Did something happen between you and Attorney Do? The atmosphere between you two was pretty intense.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason anything would happen between me and Attorney Do. Stop being nosy, and let\u2019s talk about work. What are those in your hands?\u201d\u201cGeez, I\u2019m so done with you. Okay, here\u2014two files for your review. Which do you want to open up first?\u201d She raised both hands and waved the envelopes. The envelope in her left hand was very thin. The other envelope was relatively thicker, but it was still on the thin side.Sehun pointed to the left with his chin. \u201cThat one.\u201d\u201cMrs. Ikyung Do directly sent a letter of direction\u2014here\u2019s her retainer agreement. You just need to sign it.\u201d\u201cDirectly? To you?\u201d\u201cYeah, she sent it by courier to my house last night. I considered contacting you immediately, but it seemed too simple of a matter to bother you on your day off, so I\u2019m handing it to you today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - InvestigationSehun finally stood up and approached the couch. He sat on the armrest and took the envelope that Mihee handed to him. He skimmed over the contents of the file, expressionlessly. However, he said in a somewhat subdued tone, \u201cShe wants an agent to sign off on purchases of overseas artwork.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what she does as the art gallery director\u2014manage works of art.\u201d\u201cAre you sure these are regular purchases? There\u2019s nobody in the industry who doesn\u2019t know that Soohan uses artwork for tax evasion. To my knowledge, there\u2019s a whole unit dedicated to that in their headquarters.\u201d\u201cWho knows? I guess you\u2019ll find out if you talk to her since there\u2019s a lot that can\u2019t be put to writing. She asked me to arrange a meeting with you. She has probably wanted to meet you.\u201dThis confirmed all of Sehun\u2019s presumptions. He didn\u2019t understand why Ikyung Do would ask Doguk to act for her when there were people who specialized in this kind of work, making them more efficient and reliable.\u201cIsn\u2019t it weird? Why would she want me to do this?\u201d\u201cMaybe she wants to ask you to take care of her brother. She specifically asked for you, and her compensation offer is massive. I have never seen that number offered to an individual lawyer before. There\u2019s separate compensation upon success as well.\u201dSehun glanced at Yoonshin\u2019s empty room and frowned. Mihee followed Sehun\u2019s eyes and observed the office on the other side before turning back to the man. Sehun was skimming through the file as if he had done nothing.Perhaps he was trying to read beyond the letters printed on the surface of the paper. He concentrated until his brows furrowed deeply. Sehun then tossed the slightly crumpled envelope and its contents on the coffee table. The papers flew out and landed perfectly in front of Mihee.\u201cI won\u2019t take it,\u201d Sehun declared.\u201cThe Do siblings are very close. Since Professor Do was quite busy, his sister practically raised him.\u201d\u201cHe has long grown up, yet she\u2019s practically trying to bribe me at a parent-teacher conference. Wasn\u2019t it enough to stick him here? I only accepted him to settle my debt to you. To begin with, I\u2019m not fit for babysitting, but if she\u2019s asking me to take responsibility for the child, I have no choice but to cut the deal. If you don\u2019t want to lose her business, give it to another partner, or give it to Fourth-year.\u201d\u201cDirector Do said to give it to you, specifically.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not Soohan\u2019s pet dog. If the deal doesn\u2019t meet my standards, I would even send away Yoonshin Do\u2019s grandfather. Turn this one away.\u201dSeeming that there was no way of convincing Sehun, Mihee stared into Sehun\u2019s eyes then asked, \u201cShould I really turn it away? You\u2019re not even going to think about it?\u201d\u201cThinking is for people who have time to do that. If she truly wants to repay me, give me a big one instead of something trivial like this. We recently hired a tax accountant who was formerly the director of the National Tax Service, so maybe a tax case. Or international trade deals\u2014our performance is quite good these days. My favorite, M&As, and international investments sound good. Anything like that where I get paid for doing real work, I\u2019ll consider. Next.\u201dMihee hid her disappointment\u2014she knew that she would only make matters worse the more she pushed. To begin with, she expected this from Sehun. He already had plenty of money. He probably figured that he would be given a bigger and unknown burden if he bit this seemingly charitable bait.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do this one. This was the construction company matter that you\u2019ve been interested in since last year.\u201dThis time, Mihee tossed the yellow envelope in her right hand and crossed her legs. Sehun read through the files carefully, and Mihee watched him, looking amused. Sehun always read texts very seriously. After a few minutes, she presumed that it was enough time for him to know the contents of the files and asked, \u201cDoes this stimulate your interest?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rumors were going around, but it\u2019s pretty much set in stone now. The places that were eyeing the company are going mad. Taesan Construction sniffed this out and wanted to purchase the company.

Then I\u2019ll just let Taesan know that you\u2019ll most likely take the case. I\u2019ll think on Director Do\u2019s matter and deal with it. You\u2019ll get busy.

She could tell that Sehun had something more to say and stared intently at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, holding back a leaving person? It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be work-related,\u201d Mihee asked.\u201cAbout Yoonshin Do\u2026\u201d Sehun started.When she heard Yoonshin\u2019s name, Mihee snapped her fingers as if she suddenly remembered. \u201cOh, right. I forgot to mention. Attorney Do is downstairs on my order. A client said that they were coming in, and I was supposed to meet them. The conference room, interview room, and consultation room were all being used and the VVIP room wasn\u2019t available, so he\u2019s in the caf\u00e9 on the first floor. Sorry for using your associate.\u201d\u201cClient? I didn\u2019t give him a new case. I was just about to include him in one of my cases.\u201d\u201cSee, he\u2019s a personal client. My mom\u2019s friend\u2019s youngest son got into an accident. I couldn\u2019t think of anyone but Attorney Do to take this case. It\u2019s an impaired driving accident, and he hit someone at the scene. He was driving slowly, and the accident wasn\u2019t too big. But the victim is\u2026\u201dSehun, who was listening intently so far, could grasp what the situation was about and knit his brow. If she could only come up with Yoonshin, then it was a case that only he could do.\u201cAn elderly person, pregnant woman, disabled person, or a minor. Which one?\u201d Sehun asked.\u201cA minor,\u201d Mihee replied.As Sehun mused on the answer, Mihee added, \u201cPlus, he was charged with a hit-and-run. He did return to the scene of the accident shortly after, but he did initially flee the scene. If Attorney Do agrees to take it, I was thinking of making it pro bono.\u201cHe\u2019ll need to settle. Money is probably more important than an apology. This kind of thing suits him.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a tricky case, so I\u2019m sure he can also do the work you give him.\u201d\u201cI understand. That\u2019s that, but anyway, about Yoonshin Do\u2026\u201d Sehun glanced at Yoonshin\u2019s room again, but there was a different glint to his eyes. Mihee\u2019s face also grew complex, unable to grasp why Sehun was peeking at the empty office. Sehun could feel that Mihee was getting a kick out of this, so he frowned in discomfort. \u201cHave you, by any chance, heard anything about him getting married?\u201d\u201cAttorney Do said that he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend when I interviewed him. Why?\u201d\u201cI think his sister played matchmaker for him not too long ago.\u201dMihee was perplexed\u2014everything Sehun said was so out of the blue. \u201cThis is the first I heard of it\u2026 Is Attorney Do getting married?\u201d\u201cHe met a prospective partner.\u201d\u201cI guess he\u2019s around the age when he would get offered those. His previous affiliation was the only thing that left much to be desired, but now that he\u2019s in a decent firm\u2026 Wait. Why do you care about that? Did you guys actually\u2014\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Critical Clue\u201cI told you you\u2019re wrong. I just need to know more about him, that\u2019s all,\u201d Sehun said.Mihee hummed, trying to pull out as much information from the depths of her brain. Her forehead creased in concentration, and she pursed her lips. However, nothing big seemed to come up.Sehun asked Mihee only because Yoonshin\u2019s skepticism about his blind date bothered him. Sehun waved his hand, having not expected too much from the beginning. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know anything, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know anything about Attorney Do getting married, but\u2026\u201d Mihee said, trailing off.\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cSpeaking of marriage, there\u2019s a rumor that there\u2019s friction between Ikyung Do and her husband.\u201dMost marriages between wealthy families had some sort of deal between them. However, Ikyung and her husband were one of the few cases where they got married out of love and were treated as an anomaly. The general public paid more attention to their activities for that reason. Perhaps that was why, but even before their wedding bells rang far and wide, several groundless rumors were floating around. Sehun, who knew all of that, wasn\u2019t very reactive.\u201cAren\u2019t there always weird rumors about that family? Nothing big has happened for 10 years since they got married,\u201d Sehun said blandly.Mihee waved her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit different this time. Attorney Do\u2019s brother-in-law\u2014no, Soohan Holding\u2019s Director Jeongwon Yoo said himself that it\u2019s hard for him to handle his wife.\u201dUpon hearing this new information, Sehun frowned. \u201cHard to handle\u2026 He says that as if he\u2019s a victim. Either he is a real victim, or he wants to become one.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it? Director Yoo met a good wife, so he\u2019s being presented as a decent human being, but we both know that deep down to the core, he\u2019s an elitist bully.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t they have two children?\u201d\u201cTwo sons. Neither of them is elementary school age. I don\u2019t think things will turn too sour. They have the kids, they\u2019re young, and Ikyung is particularly clever and meticulous, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll act rashly. It\u2019s just that since Attorney Do is at our firm, I just can\u2019t ignore gossip about that family. You should keep it in mind.\u201d\u201cI will. Okay, you\u2019re free to leave,\u201d Sehun said.Mihee patted Sehun\u2019s shoulder in encouragement and left his office. When the door closed, Sehun, who was perching on the armrest all along, leaned against his plush sofa. He sat as still as water while his thoughts ran wildly. The strong rays of sun smeared into the office.Sehun closed the blinds to the outside windows first before dialing an extension on his office phone.Secretary Tak picked up instantly. \u201cYes, Attorney Kang.\u201d\u201cJust a moment ago, Senior Attorney Song brought some paperwork for a new file. It\u2019s from Taesan Construction about acquiring Youngjin Construction, so make the seniors in the team scrape up some reference material. Also, there\u2019ll be a pro bono that Attorney Song assigned to Yoonshin Do. Once he comes up, he\u2019ll bring documents from the client. Make a copy for me too,\u201d Sehun instructed.\u201cUnderstood. Oh, is your headache all right now? You had it all last week. If not for Attorney Do, I wouldn\u2019t have known that you were having headaches.\u201dThe one who triggered his vertigo of thoughts and prickling pain was Yoonshin. Sehun thought back to the deep kiss they shared the other night and pressed his bottom lip with his finger. The soft sensation of something covering his smooth lips was still vivid as if it had just happened moments ago. The memories of it revived every time he stroked his lips.He felt blood pooling into his heart and frowned, making his reply delayed. \u201cIt\u2019s much better. You don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just hand over the documents when they\u2019re ready. Is there anything else?\u201d\u201cNo, thank you.\u201dUpon hanging up, Sehun surrendered his back to his sofa. Perhaps it was because of the new information that Mihee left. He inevitably recalled when he bumped into Yoonshin in the second-floor library.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Critical ClueBack then, Yoonshin had divorce precedents in his arms. Naturally, he also thought back to when the younger man cried after meeting his sister, his disconcertedness since then, and the anxiety and bitterness festering in Yoonshin\u2019s eyes. Sehun felt the pieces to the puzzle were slowly coming together.\u201cI\u2019m at a cul-de-sac,\u201d\u00a0Yoonshin had said.Would he use such a dramatic phrase if his sister\u2019s family circumstances weren\u2019t that serious? If Yoonshin\u2019s sister were getting a divorce, the societal rebound would be inevitable, given that the other party was the son of a conglomerate family and because they built an image of a loving couple to the public. But as long as Sehun remained a third party, he could separate himself from the issue upon the onset of pain and suffering.Ultimately, there were two possibilities. Either Yoonshin was bold but he was helplessly feeble in mental fortitude and morality, or there was another serious issue behind the curtains.Sehun threw his head back against the couch and looked around his tidy office before closing his eyes.* * *At the caf\u00e9 on the first floor of the firm\u2019s building, Yoonshin sat across from the client and was thoroughly looking through the evidence. He came down at Mihee\u2019s earnest request, but he wasn\u2019t feeling up for this matter.Sehun often compared their work to shopping. Legal work was a type of service industry. It was easy to think that the customers had absolute power, but that wasn\u2019t the case. If the seller didn\u2019t want to sell their services, that was that. Matters like this were a type that Yoonshin would never have taken if he were still employed elsewhere.Honestly, Yoonshin was overcome with the impulse to get up and leave this meeting. He flipped through the papers and then locked eyes with the man in front of him.\u201cI was just briefed on this as I was coming down. I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to properly review the details. So, hmm\u2026 You were driving under the influence, hit a child on the road, then fled. You left the child behind. You also tampered with the scene of the accident.\u201dPerhaps Yoonshin sounded dour as the man quietly gave his excuse. \u201cI was just so shocked, and it was dark\u2026 But I did go back and report the accident. I have the transcript of my call.\u201dThe man flipped the documents for Yoonshin to a page near the back of the package. Yoonshin focused his attention on the paper. The transcript of the recorded phone conversation with the 911 dispatcher was printed. The client must have genuinely been shocked because he was all over the place, and the dispatcher had to repeat questions several times.\u201cWhat about CCTV surveillance? Why is that not in the list of evidence? There are usually a few cameras around,\u201d Yoonshin asked pointedly.\u201cIt was a national highway on the outskirts of Gyeonggi province. The police said that there were none because it was such a remote location.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then, do you have pictures or videos of the scene of the accident?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think to take any myself, but I do have my car\u2019s dashcam. Here\u2014I came here to deliver the original. According to Attorney Song, it won\u2019t be all that favorable to me.\u201dYoonshin dropped the memory card in the file folder. Then, he flipped through the documents again. He snapped a picture of the witness\u2019 name and contact information and the contact information of the complainant child\u2019s mother.\u201cThis witness saw you flee, right?\u201d\u201cYes, and they also saw me coming back to the accident.\u201d\u201cYou did well to get the name and contact information of the witness,\u201d Yoonshin told the client.Yoonshin pulled out the picture of the child in between the files and stared at it. \u201cSo, it\u2019ll take eight weeks for the patient to fully recover\u2026 He fractured his bones. His condition isn\u2019t great.\u201d\u201cSince he\u2019s young, I only bumped into him slightly, but his bone snapped quite easily,\u201d the client added.Once he heard that, Yoonshin glared coldly at the man. \u201cDid you also say that in front of the child\u2019s parents? That their child\u2019s bones probably broke easily because he\u2019s a child?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Your blood alcohol level was on the low side, but you still consumed alcohol, and you did enough things to be mistaken for a hit-and-run. The moment you drove away, you lost their trust. Motor vehicle accidents are personal in nature, so the best you can do is opt for settlement. You can\u2019t have that attitude, even more so when apologizing wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201dSettlement for prosecution cases couldn\u2019t be solved purely by money, unlike civil suits. It needed more care and attention. Just a year ago, Yoonshin would have been consoling the parents as the child\u2019s representative. Attorney Song knew this, so instead of asking other lawyers or taking this herself, she offered it to Yoonshin.\u201cI\u2019m upset about a few things too. I didn\u2019t drink that much, and I was driving slowly. Also, I went back, I personally reported the accident, and I tried to help the kid.\u201d\u201cThe parents of an injured child won\u2019t see or hear that. Don\u2019t feel upset. Someone was hurt because of your mistake. A child has a long future ahead, yet his body was damaged.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give them however much they want, within reason. I think this kid\u2019s house isn\u2019t very well off,\u201d the client offered.Yoonshin seethed silently. Not catching on, the man added, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll give them double the amount they have in mind. There\u2019s nobody who doesn\u2019t like money.\u201dHowever, Yoonshin was still quiet.\u201cMr. Attorney?\u201d the client asked tentatively.As long as Yoonshin was bound to this law firm, he already learned from Sehun that he couldn\u2019t always take on clients with clean hands. When he finally got a handle on his feelings after recalling the older man\u2019s low voice, he replied, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll try to meet with the other party. They might want an apology from you. If you ever have to meet with the family of the complainant, just do as I tell you. Let them get angry at you and let them hit you if they want to. Let them pull your hair out. They\u2019ll be able to calm down then and maybe consider your position.\u201d\u201cDo I need to go that far?\u201d the man asked nervously.\u201cYou drove under the influence of alcohol and committed a hit-and-run, but you weren\u2019t expecting to do that much? Also, just know that I\u2019m going to calculate the settlement amount considering the long-term effects of the accident.\u201d\u201cO-okay. I\u2019m fine with anything, so just help me deal with this as cleanly as possible. I\u2019m destined for big things.\u201d\u201cSomething big\u2014I think you\u2019ve already done that,\u201d Yoonshin muttered.\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201dAfter gazing at the man\u2019s face for a moment, Yoonshin repressed his heavy sigh. Then, he pushed forward the retainer agreement for the man to sign.* * *Yoonshin, swaddling the documents in his arms, called someone at the window of his office floor. Perhaps it was because it was from an unknown caller, but the call\u2019s recipient didn\u2019t pick up after several rings. When they finally received the call, Yoonshin looked relieved and carefully introduced himself. \u201cHello, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m Yoonshin Do from Doguk Law. I represent the accused in the recent car accident. I called to ask if you could meet with me sometime soon.\u201dAfter listening carefully to the response of the other side, Yoonshin replied, \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not calling to settle immediately. Your child\u2019s recovery is first. Is he all right? He got a fracture when he\u2019s not fully developed, so I was really worried.\u201dYoonshin wedged his phone between his ear and shoulder and awkwardly reached out. He managed to open the creaky window, and the winter wind, as if it were waiting for a chance, blew into his face.\u201cOf course. I won\u2019t bring any documents. Yes, I\u2019m also fine with today. Oh\u2026 Then what time should I go? Thank you. I\u2019ll let you know before I leave my office. Okay, I will see you then.

He filled his lungs with fresh air before closing the window with unwilling hands and went about his day.He mindlessly walked down the hallway, reaching the secretaries\u2019 office in no time. Secretary Tak greeted him, at the ready, and stretched out his hands. \u201cAttorney Do, you can give all your documents to me. I\u2019ll copy them and return them to you.\u201dYoonshin obliged, handing over the documents. Trying to disguise his exhaustion, he added, \u201cThe memory card for the dashcam is also there\u2014please copy that as well. Could you keep the retainer agreement in storage? And could you look into the backgrounds of the complainant child\u2019s parents? I want to know if there is anything in their academic, personal, or familial backgrounds I can use.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Secretary Tak replied.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe photocopier started whirring, and Yoonshin leaned his arm on the partition of the office desks. His eyes naturally turned to Sehun\u2019s office. The owner of the room was no different from usual.Sehun, in his perfect attire and posture, focused on his work with a serious face as he rolled his pen in his hand. He looked flawless. Yoonshin was in awe of the perfection of Sehun, unattainable but for his extraordinary combination of genes.Yoonshin propped his chin with one arm and stared at Sehun. But then, Yoonshin\u2019s eyelashes fluttered with a twitch.\u2018Are we going out with each other?\u2019\u00a0he wondered. He leaned further into his hand and narrowed his eyes.\u00a0\u2018Or maybe we\u2019re not yet?\u2019They kissed, but Sehun didn\u2019t profess his feelings or officially ask him out. To be fair, Yoonshin, who wasn\u2019t sure of his feelings yet, didn\u2019t either. They weren\u2019t children\u2014as adults with the capacity to consent, they could start with a purely physical relationship. All the possibilities were open.\u2018Does he even like me?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin wanted to know what Sehun thought about him, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask, not wanting to add to the already negative impression he gave to Sehun.\u2018How do I make him ask me out on a date?\u2019\u00a0he continued to wonder.Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure if Sehun Kang was the type of person who could have a passionate romance. Before that, he wasn\u2019t even sure if Sehun had the time for any romance at all. For the past few months, Yoonshin saw the other man every day at work, but they had no time to truly get to know each other. They merely observed one another from their offices. Their relationship to each other was formed solely through each other\u2019s opinions that were far from the truth.However, there was one thing for certain. Regardless of who Sehun was as a person and regardless of his feelings, Yoonshin was instinctively attracted to Sehun. Perhaps it was because they were such polar opposites.Yoonshin didn\u2019t enjoy fighting. He became a lawyer simply because he liked untangling problems. Rather than accruing conflict with someone completely different in personality, Yoonshin typically smiled and avoided the other person. He didn\u2019t usually chase after others like how he followed Sehun.The discomfort that Yoonshin always felt around Sehun could have been Yoonshin\u2019s animalistic instinct that his feelings could grow in an unimaginable direction.\u2018Strangely, I feel like I can rely on you,\u201d\u00a0Yoonshin said to Sehun in his heart.Knowing Sehun, he would probably remain aloof, unchanged, and unmoving. He would be difficult and arrogant as ever, yet he would listen to Yoonshin once in a while and give him hints.Yoonshin\u2019s lips trembled, attempting unsuccessfully to suppress a smile as he analyzed Sehun\u2019s detailed and refined face. Yoonshin\u2019s eyes landed on Sehun biting his red, bottom lip, seemingly frustrated by hitting a block.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead of hating it or feeling repulsed, it was exhilarating.Upon coming to that thought, a blush stained Yoonshin\u2019s cheeks.At that moment, Secretary Tak finished copying the files and was returning to Yoonshin with the originals and the copies. \u201cHere you go, Attorney Do.\u201dYoonshin took the papers and leaned in, whispering, \u201cThank you. Right, did Attorney Kang say anything about any work that he\u2019ll assign me? I looked through all the team\u2019s matters, but he told me to attend the case meeting for only the ones that he directed me to. He told me to wait, but I can\u2019t help but feel a bit impatient.\u201d\u201cOh, actually, he had some instructions for you this morning. I think you\u2019ll be taking on a new matter. Attorney Kang said he\u2019s probably going to take an acquisition case.\u201d\u201cAcquisition? Who\u2019s selling what?\u201d\u201cYoungjin Construction is being acquired. Taesan Construction heard the word that Youngjin was finally going to sell and wanted to buy the business. Taesan asked us to frame the circumstances as naturally as possible. Senior Attorney Kang is quite good at designing these. Since it\u2019s an M&A of a publicly listed company, he needs a lot of specialists, so he\u2019s choosing the members of this project from other teams as well.\u201d\u201cMembers? Our team isn\u2019t taking it?\u201dSecretary Tak shook his head at the absurd question. \u201cThese things need a lot of specialized knowledge. It\u2019ll be so large-scale that even if our entire team went at it, we wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. There\u2019s a mountain of taxation and financial issues like acquisition tax, transfer tax, registration fees, and all sorts of other things. It\u2019s better to pick people from different departments.\u201d\u201cI guess it\u2019s a special team of sorts then?\u201d\u201cYes. He usually does M&As like that. Sometimes, we do it with other law firms. That\u2019s where you\u2019re involved. Your specialty is in labor law, right? I\u2019ll send you the documents by email soon.\u201dThe work Yoonshin was doing so far was all from Sehun\u2019s individual file load or smaller matters involving a few lawyers, so a large-scale collaboration was new to him. Yoonshin felt like he finally was a part of Doguk. He met Secretary Tak\u2019s eyes with anticipation and worry. Yoonshin thought he might as well ask, \u201cI\u2019m just asking since I feel like you might know well, but December 31\u2014do you know what that day is?\u201d\u201cDecember 31? That\u2019s the year-end. It\u2019s not a weekend this year, so it\u2019s not a holiday,\u201d Secretary Tak replied.Yoonshin pressed harder. \u201cI saw it marked with an X in Senior Attorney Kang\u2019s desk calendar. It didn\u2019t seem like a birthday. Is it the anniversary of his first trial date? Or his parent\u2019s date of passing?\u201d\u201cOhhh, Senior Attorney Kang. Not as far as I know. It\u2019s just a vacation day.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s eyes grew round, unable to comprehend immediately. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that he marked a simple vacation day in advance like that?\u201d\u201cMmm, well, to be honest, I\u2019m not very sure. He takes that day off every year no matter what. I don\u2019t know anything more than that. Maybe he plans on resting thoroughly after a year of hard work and in preparation for the next year.\u201d\u201cSo there are things that you don\u2019t know, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah, right? I can\u2019t tell you anything more than that. Honestly, I only talk about work with him. Senior Attorney Song is closer to him on a personal level, so you could ask her.\u201dThere was no reason for Yoonshin to loiter any longer. He thanked the secretary for his tips and shook the papers in his hands before returning to his office. Then, feeling reluctant to go back to his office, Yoonshin changed directions. He knocked on Sehun\u2019s door and heard a subdued, \u201cYes?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When his visitor didn\u2019t say anything, Sehun raised his head from his documents. Then, the partner lawyer leaned back in his chair, making it squeak.\u201cGreat. Just keep hanging on the doorframe. It\u2019s exactly like your life,\u201d Sehun commented snarkily.\u201cAre you calling me ambiguous?\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you offended?\u201d\u201cHonestly, yes.\u201dWhile the other was laughing hollowly, Yoonshin came into the room and closed the door behind him, then he walked toward Sehun\u2019s desk. With his own documents in his arms, he stood next to Sehun and peeked at the documents Sehun was reading. The older man crossed his arms and legs haughtily and stared intently at Yoonshin.\u201cIf you entered my space, state your business first. Don\u2019t steal anything.\u201d\u201cWho stole anything?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like stealing things?\u201dYoonshin winced at Sehun\u2019s comment, fraught with meaning. His cheeks grew faintly pink. It almost sounded as if Sehun knew that Yoonshin had snuck into this office before. He thought he should come clean, yet he didn\u2019t want to wipe away the gentle expression Sehun had, testing his honesty.\u201cSo, Senior Attorney,\u201d Yoonshin started to say, wanting to confess his wrongdoings after contemplation.However, Sehun cut off this topic immediately, \u201cWhat were you going to say? You\u2019ve interrupted me, so you need to tell me something of equivalent importance.\u201dIt was the first time Yoonshin met anyone who was so well-suited for high-handed words. Frankly speaking, Yoonshin got a similar impression from his brother-in-law back in the day. However, if his brother-in-law\u2019s arrogance was from the power he held since the day he was born, Sehun\u2019s was from confidence born from his efforts. Yoonshin couldn\u2019t say there were rights and wrongs to arrogance, but in his eyes, Sehun\u2019s attitude was a lot more justified.Yoonshin took his eyes off the documents and stared at Sehun. Sehun ended up staring just as intently back, whether from the enjoyment of Yoonshin\u2019s gaze or discomfort. They were exchanging looks wordlessly, but Yoonshin couldn\u2019t understand why he was starting to feel shy. Eventually, Yoonshin raised the white flag first. \u201cI\u2019m going to get off work early to go to the hospital today.\u201dOnce he brought up the main point, dropping all the context, Sehun\u2019s brows creased slightly. \u201cAre you the ill one or someone else?\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m sick, would you be worried?\u201d Yoonshin answered with another question.\u201cSo, it\u2019s someone else.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s shallow attempt was seen through. He leered at the other man. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t this work on you?\u201d\u201cMy class is different from yours.\u201dYoonshin couldn\u2019t deny that, so the best he could do was change the topic. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t bring it up first, so I\u2019ll be the one asking again. Do you want to meet me tonight? I\u2019ll buy you coffee.\u201d\u201cWho do you think you are to ask if I want to meet you?\u201dYoonshin carefully reviewed what he said for any problem. He asked again, less certain, \u201cCould you\u2026 meet with me, please?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d After the terse answer, Sehun resumed concentrating on his work.Taken aback, Yoonshin placed his documents on the desk and slammed his hands on the desk, bringing the attention back to him.The man who said he didn\u2019t like gluttons voraciously made out with him last night like a starved person. By virtue of that, Yoonshin felt like he could still feel the other man\u2019s tongue inside his mouth. Numbness filled his mouth. He was left with only a slippery sensation after the bumpy papillae of his tongue were rubbed out by repeatedly being crushed against another.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are we not going on any dates whatsoever?\u201d\u201cWhy should I go on a date with you?\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Yoonshin exclaimed, struck dumb when he heard exactly what he expected. Sehun had a point though. Their relationship wasn\u2019t clear enough to be a sufficient reason for needing to go on a date together.Last night, Yoonshin felt a thin wire now connected them, allowing a small current of emotive electricity. They had yet to share any deep conversations, and Yoonshin\u2019s feelings toward Sehun might not be that big. However, something that cropped up into existence couldn\u2019t simply be undone and vanish.\u201cDo you hate talking to me by any chance?\u201d Yoonshin asked.\u201cNo, I like to,\u201d Sehun replied.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you have a problem with that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou looked like you did just a moment ago when you exclaimed, \u2018Wow\u2026\u2019\u201d\u201cI said I don\u2019t have a problem.\u201dThe word \u201clike.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s lips stuck together in a rigid line as he had never dreamed that the word would come from Sehun\u2019s mouth. His face was probably burning up. His thoughts completely froze solid like a water pipe in the winter, so he couldn\u2019t come up with an appropriate response in time. While he struggled to hide his astonishment, Sehun waggled his finger at the remote control on the coffee table.\u201cFourth-year, close the blinds, lock the door, and come here,\u201d he ordered.Yoonshin wanted to deliberately act difficult just like Sehun sometimes did, but before he knew it, he had walked over to the table and picked up the remote. Before Yoonshin lowered the blinds, he checked the hallway in case anyone noticed anything strange. Thankfully, all the employees were focused on their work and weren\u2019t paying attention to Sehun\u2019s office.Upon confirming, Yoonshin locked the door and closed the blinds. He felt the presence of another person from behind him.It was Sehun.At some point, Sehun had approached Yoonshin and hugged him from behind. Then, he angled his head slightly to gently kiss Yoonshin\u2019s neck. Yoonshin leaned his head against Sehun\u2019s shoulder and stretched his arms behind him to pull Sehun closer.Sehun was the one who instructed Yoonshin to come over after he was done locking the door, yet the older lawyer couldn\u2019t wait, pressing his body against Yoonshin. Yoonshin felt the impatience in Sehun\u2019s actions, and he felt flattered about it. Even so, he hadn\u2019t heard from Sehun how he truly felt about Yoonshin, so he still felt like he was getting the short end of the stick.\u201cI want to see your face,\u201d Yoonshin said breathlessly, wanting to turn his head. Sehun grabbed Yoonshin by the back of his neck and forced him to turn his way. Sehun\u2019s fingers brushed teasingly inside his shirt collar. Where Sehun touched, Yoonshin\u2019s skin flared up.Flustered, Yoonshin tried to repress his excitement when he heard Sehun\u2019s low, melodious voice vibrating in his eardrums, \u201cWho do you think will say it first?\u201dSehun dropped all the context, but Yoonshin knew exactly what he meant. Sehun was talking about who would say he liked the other or express a deeper sort of emotion first. They had already kissed, yet Sehun was still trying to feel out and measure the other. It was just like Sehun to do that.Yoonshin, who was getting doubly uneasy, asked, \u201cSo\u2026 Are we actually going out with each other? I think you need to make that clear before I can answer your question.\u201dSehun\u2019s eyebrows scrunched together, baffled as to why Yoonshin would ask that so suddenly. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You want to go out with me.\u201dThe desire to refute brimmed to the tip of his tongue, but Yoonshin couldn\u2019t since it was the truth. Sehun was right. Yoonshin wanted to define their relationship, preferably in the direction that Sehun mentioned.Sehun must have led Yoonshin to bring it up first. Yoonshin ended up asking Sehun out first, and Sehun accepted it. Yoonshin tried to hide being upset about playing into Sehun\u2019s hand and declared indignantly, \u201cNever in a million years will I like you first.\u201d\u201cSay that again, enunciating every word.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s declaration must have struck a nerve. Sehun\u2019s pristine face became stiff as a rock. Yoonshin glanced from the side and winced, but Sehun pushed harder against Yoonshin.\u201cI won\u2019t like\u2014urk!\u201d Yoonshin yelped.A chilling voice pricked his eardrums. \u201cEarlier, you said that you would never sleep with me. Do you remember that?\u201dYoonshin had said that when they ate lunch together for the first time. At that time, he simply used it as a metaphor to express his intent that he wouldn\u2019t slip away from Doguk.\u201cOf course I do. But what I meant that time was\u2014!\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of things you\u2019ll never do with me, don\u2019t you? Does that mean we\u2019re going out, but we don\u2019t like each other yet?\u201dTo confront someone like Sehun, who considered all the possibilities to ultimately incapacitate the opposing party, Yoonshin knew that the weight of his feelings had to be lighter than Sehun\u2019s. Moreover, Yoonshin needed to learn how to effectively utilize his relationship with Sehun. If the balance of emotions leaned further to one side, Yoonshin could get swept along in Sehun\u2019s pace and be fettered up slowly but surely. Yoonshin didn\u2019t want to ruin his situation like that.\u201cYou\u2019ll be the one to tell me that you like me first,\u201d Yoonshin said with conviction.\u201cI\u2019ll return those words to you. I\u2019m very competitive. You\u00a0will\u00a0say it first,\u201d Sehun proclaimed flatly, and then he yanked Yoonshin\u2019s head by his hairs. He angled Yoonshin\u2019s head toward him. In pain, Yoonshin took deep breaths as he turned his head.At the same time, the older man\u2019s eyes glinted guilefully as he leaned in to kiss Yoonshin.\u201cNgh! Mmmm.\u201dTheir tongues roused a fierce battle in the depths of their mouths, tangling with each other. Sparks seemed to fly in the air as their flesh overlapped.A sultry atmosphere hung above the two. Their power struggle continued as they pressed onto each other, silently sinking\u2014or perhaps floating to the surface\u2014together.Yoonshin pulled in the other\u2019s hips firmly. He moved around, matching Sehun\u2019s movements, and their kiss grew deeper.Yoonshin already knew that the picky and haughty Sehun Kang wasn\u2019t an easy match as his boss and as a lover. There was no turning back.If one was caught in the rain without an umbrella, one would have to brave through it.Act 12Night had already fallen. The sky grew dark past the evening hours. Cars scuttled busily outside the hospital. The constant influx of cars caused a hubbub, but the energy of the crowd wasn\u2019t necessarily lively\u2014rather, it was the opposite.The temperature drops throughout the day were drastic, chilling the nighttime air. Thoroughly feeling the approach of winter, Yoonshin came out from the in-patient exit. He pulled his jacket closed and perched on the bench in front of the flowerbed.He sighed, staring blankly at the fog from his mouth, before he called his client. \u201cIt\u2019s Yoonshin Do from Doguk.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You said you were going to the hospital. How did it go?\u201d his client answered.\u201cI just came out from the hospital. I called to let you know a few things. Are you free to chat right now?\u201dOnce he met with the parents of the victim, Yoonshin saw a faint sign that this could be solved well. He could tell from when the parents first allowed his visitation that they weren\u2019t going to be nasty or coldhearted. So, Yoonshin aimed to get friendly with them and searched for a connection.Thankfully, the mother attended the same elementary school as Yoonshin\u2019s younger cousin. In addition, Yoonshin remembered visiting the school when he was younger. They broke the ice while chatting about inane topics such as the small size of the school\u2019s field.Yoonshin was always good at engaging with people like that. He had seen his father and his sister using those skills as well.\u201cYes, I have time. You told them I\u2019d give them a lot of money, right?\u201d the other man on the line replied.Yoonshin grumbled internally that it wasn\u2019t always about money.Yoonshin bit his lip, enraged at the superficial reply, but instead said, \u201cBefore that, you\u2019ll need to apologize to them in person, sincerely.\u201d\u201cOf course, I would happily do that, if they allow me to. I can go to apologize properly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re willing to do that. As you mentioned, I think it would be good if you gave them a decent settlement. There\u2019s no precise standard, but usually, we calculate the sum per week of recovery time. There is a lot of room for variation. Considering all the circumstances and the hospital costs, I came up with $23,800.\u201d\u201cHow about just rounding it up to 25,000?\u201d\u201cThe child\u2019s parents would likely be agreeable to that offer. Your sincerity is more important than the amount.\u201d\u201cWell, money equates to sincerity. If it\u2019s not enough, you can use more.\u201dHaving the client be so willing to spend money was a good thing. Yoonshin gripped his phone tighter and quietly stood from the bench. \u201cThen I\u2019ll recalculate with that in consideration. You will need to come to the hospital to apologize. The child\u2019s parents want me to visit with you, so let\u2019s arrange a date that works. I\u2019ll get all the paperwork straight and contact you soon.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be looking forward to your call. Thank you for your efforts.\u201dAfter ending the call, Yoonshin was about to head to hail a cab. He didn\u2019t bring his car, so he needed to use some other method of transportation. He lined up at the end of the long taxi line, then he stared at his call history. On the bottom of his screen was the evidence of his call to Sehun the other day.\u2018Does that mean we won\u2019t see each other today after all?\u2019\u00a0Yoonshin thought.In the end, Sehun never replied to Yoonshin\u2019s request to meet after work. They kissed again, but Sehun didn\u2019t retract his question of why they needed to go on a date.Of course, he could call Sehun first. However, he didn\u2019t want to try to flirt immediately after declaring that he wouldn\u2019t say he liked him first. He didn\u2019t want to appear desperate.He tapped on Sehun\u2019s name, hiding his disappointment, and tucked his phone in his jacket pocket. He took one step forward, following the person in front of him.It was then.Beep beeep. There was a loud honking from the parking lot to Yoonshin\u2019s right. Everyone in line turned their heads toward the source of the honk. Yoonshin followed the sound as well. The source of the honk was from a luxurious sedan parked in the lot.Then, the window to the driver seat silently rolled down and Sehun\u2019s face appeared from it, his hands on the handle. Perhaps because of his handsome face, a wave of murmurs swept through the crowd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/No MoralCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAttorney Kang?\u201d Surprised, Yoonshin made his way through the crowd and ran to Sehun\u2019s car. He stood in front of the window and looked at Sehun, preventing the general public from seeing the older man. \u201cWhat brought you here?\u201d\u201cIs your hand broken?\u201d Sehun asked, out of the blue.Yoonshin looked down at both hands and shook his head. Perhaps Sehun was asking backhandedly why Yoonshin didn\u2019t call, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. They never promised to meet, so Yoonshin was quite pleasantly surprised to see Sehun. Yoonshin wasn\u2019t sure whether he felt happy to see Sehun because he simply liked Sehun as a person or because of something deeper than that. In any case, he was glad.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Yoonshin replied.\u201cGood. I can\u2019t get out and open the door for you. It\u2019s cringy and embarrassing. Get in.\u201d\u201cDo you always have to say things that way? You could have just told me to get in.\u201d\u201cI keep wanting to tease you because it\u2019s amusing that you react every time. Quit yapping and get in.\u201dConsciously repressing his pink lips from jutting out, Yoonshin ran to the passenger\u2019s side. While Yoonshin got in and stared at Sehun\u2019s profile, Sehun rolled up his window and leaned toward the younger man.Yoonshin knew that nobody would care to stare into the car, but there were still a lot of people around. Regardless, it seemed like Sehun wanted to lean in for a kiss.Feeling that this was wrong, Yoonshin carefully wrapped his hand around Sehun\u2019s wrist.\u201cHere is a bit\u2026\u201d Yoonshin refused the older man\u2019s advances. Sehun narrowed his eyes, then he pulled Yoonshin\u2019s belt with his free hand, securely buckling him in. He twisted his arm away from Yoonshin\u2019s grip.When Sehun\u2019s hands were both back on the steering wheel, Yoonshin finally grasped the situation. He had misinterpreted the older man\u2019s actions. He whipped his head away in mortification. His pale reflection in the window was enough to clearly show how embarrassed he was.Witnessing Yoonshin\u2019s reaction, Sehun tightened his grip on the wheel. He bit his bottom lip, holding back the laughter threatening to explode before letting out an airy sigh, and drove out of the hospital lot. Yoonshin looked a bit relieved; he was worried that Sehun would snicker sarcastically.They drove like that for quite the distance.Yoonshin had been merely blinking and breathing as he recovered from his embarrassment. When he recovered somewhat, he mustered up his courage and peeked at Sehun. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\u201cTo take you as a hostage.\u201d\u201cWhat were you hoping to achieve by holding me as your hostage?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still thinking. Secretary Tak said that you didn\u2019t bring your car, so I just dropped by on my way. I was getting off work anyways, and we happened to live in the same building.\u201d\u201cYou came to pick me up? You couldn\u2019t have known when my meeting would end.\u201d\u201cI just figured you would stay until the end of the visitation hours. It was obvious, knowing you.\u201dHe felt like he was in the palm of Sehun\u2019s hand. Frankly speaking, Yoonshin already knew that. Yoonshin had nothing to refute, so he changed the subject. \u201cDid you have dinner?\u201dSehun was rather nice about responding to his inane question. \u201cYep. I ate with a client. You?\u201d\u201cI just grabbed a bite to eat with the kid\u2019s parents. But why do I feel like our conversation is going too smoothly? You have a champion-level certificate in sarcasm and snide remarks. It\u2019s awkward when you\u2019re nice.\u201dBaffled, Sehun finally looked at Yoonshin. \u201cWhy are you complaining when I\u2019m treating you decently?\u201d\u201cThen would you reflect on your usually cold and irritable attitude\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to be disturbed while you traveled between work and home because you considered it your personal time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He truly looked and sounded like he was being disturbed on a personal level. Before, Yoonshin was fine when Sehun was cold to him, but now he felt a bit hurt. He felt upset even though he knew that Sehun was merely being honest. Yoonshin was rarely hurt by people, so this was new for him.Yoonshin\u2019s confidence to continue the conversation was depleted. Right before silence settled in the car, Sehun added, sounding somewhat restrained, \u201cYou\u2019re tolerable.\u201dYoonshin\u2019s shoulders jumped up. This didn\u2019t simply mean that Yoonshin was the only exception. Sehun\u2019s life was still rolling on as usual, but it meant that now, Yoonshin was a part of it. Sehun permitted this deviation to happen. Yoonshin had heard that one couldn\u2019t react when one was too surprised, and this was exactly how he felt right now. Sehun must have known as well; he continued in an even and low voice, \u201cI know what light you see me in. You think I excel at measuring, nitpicking, and hurting others, and that may as well all be true. But the moment I decide on something, I won\u2019t renege on my words. We\u2019ve already gone beyond the boundaries of coworkers. Regardless of what you think of me, I know that this is what I wanted to do.\u201dEntranced, Yoonshin stared at Sehun\u2019s side profile. When Sehun looked like he was about to turn his head around, Yoonshin quickly looked down at his knees. He glared lasers at the swell of his kneecaps, jutting out from under his pants. When the older man\u2019s eyes turned back to the road, he resumed stealing glances at Sehun\u2019s profile. The older man felt his gaze and calmly said, \u201cI\u2019m not used to having a significant other in my life. I\u2019ve never been with another person. The first time anyone asked me to stay by their side was at a funeral when a certain someone asked me.\u201dThis was surely about Yoonshin. Yoonshin wavered to jump in, and in that moment of hesitation, Sehun said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing at a transition point right now. If you continue to stand there, you\u2019ll probably also be swept away by the storm with me.\u201dIt sounded like a warning that Sehun might hurt Yoonshin, and both might get exhausted with one another. It also doubled as advice, telling Yoonshin to turn back now if he wasn\u2019t confident.Was he telling Yoonshin long-windedly that he wasn\u2019t good at creating significant relationships because he was a lawyer, or because he was scared on the inside?Perhaps, as Yoonshin had guessed, Sehun could also be a coward.Yoonshin said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t even start anything, and you\u2019re trying to scare me off. But I\u2019m different from you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. In your life, you probably always had someone around. If you prefer to be with me rather than other people this time as well, I think you\u2019re tolerable, so you can interrupt my time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAsk away if you\u2019re still curious.\u201dIt sounded like a sign that he would answer any question as sincerely and honestly as possible. Sehun had suddenly set up the situation in favor of Yoonshin so unexpectedly that Yoonshin\u2019s head turned blank\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure what to ask first. He breathed in deeply, then he warily asked, \u201cThis is a date, right? You came to pick me up when I didn\u2019t even ask you to. Am I right?\u201d\u201cThe one who discussed their after-work schedule first should be the one who knows best,\u201d Sehun replied.\u201cYou can only answer yes or no.\u201dInstead of a retort, Sehun chuckled. His grin was so refreshing that it was hard to associate it with Sehun. This was the same man as yesterday, yet he was slightly different. He looked like he was enjoying spending time with Yoonshin\u2014enough so that Yoonshin could be certain of his convictions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or no?\u201d Yoonshin pressed on.Sehun shook his head, shooting Yoonshin a look wondering why he was being so childish. Yoonshin, feeling a bit pricked in his conscience, took a step back. \u201cThen, buy me coffee in front of our building.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cDid you come here because you missed me?\u201dSehun fell silent as he changed lanes. His lips pressed together and apart in hesitation. As Yoonshin felt the urge to press his finger to feel the temperature of those lips, Sehun suddenly yanked the younger man\u2019s tie.\u201cUrgh\u2026\u201d Yoonshin groaned.The younger man\u2019s head was yanked toward the driver\u2019s seat, and his eyes grew round, slow to process the situation. Sehun was in the middle of driving, so Yoonshin couldn\u2019t struggle freely in fear of endangering them both. As he stayed still for a moment, Sehun leaned into his lips as soon as they were stopped at a traffic light.Sehun\u2019s lips compressed onto Yoonshin\u2019s in a gelatinous, bouncy kiss.Surprised, Yoonshin wiped his lips without thinking. Upset, the older man leaned in for a deeper kiss. The tip of his tongue glided in between Yoonshin\u2019s lips, tapping the younger\u2019s even teeth then pulling away.Sehun then resumed driving as if nothing had happened. Sehun\u2019s response with his body was much easier to understand than his words. Yoonshin felt elated at the feeling that somebody wanted him. Even so, Yoonshin said defensively in shyness, \u201cYou should have just used words. What\u2019s this about when you\u2019re driving? That was dangerous.\u201d\u201cFor whose benefit?\u201d\u201cYou said I was a hostage. You need to keep me alive for now.\u201d\u201cWhy should I, to someone who wouldn\u2019t like me first in a million years?\u201d Hating to enter a losing game, Sehun was quite upset about what Yoonshin said before. He already exacted retribution for that, yet he felt like he needed to reiterate it.Yoonshin thought that was quite endearing. He chuckled. He felt joy pooling up from the bottom of his heart and giddiness bubbling up to the surface, threatening to overflow.\u201cThat had some other context,\u201d Yoonshin replied.\u201cYou seemed resolute when you said that.\u201d\u201cThis can be easily solved if you like me first.\u201d\u201cI could like you, but you might never like me back.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, you must already like me.\u201dWhen he heard that placid response, it occurred to Yoonshin that this was not how he wanted the discussion to go. \u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re going to count it as something I said first then, aren\u2019t you? I won\u2019t fall for it twice.\u201dSehun didn\u2019t deny it and merely shrugged. Yoonshin watched the other man and then turned his head, practicing his right to silence. With his eyes, Yoonshin traced Sehun\u2019s outline and faint reflection in the window.When he was with Sehun, Yoonshin felt peace returning to his heart despite the unresolved tension accumulating between them. Naturally, he wanted to feel at ease in their relationship. The desire to learn more about the other bubbled.Actually, Yoonshin greatly enjoyed his time with Sehun. He was happy that Sehun came to pick him up. His heart skipped a beat when Sehun didn\u2019t forget that Yoonshin wanted to see him in the evening and appeared before him. When Sehun kissed him, his heart started to race. He didn\u2019t hate the other\u2019s awkwardness. He was grateful for the space for an opportunity that was only granted to him.His heart was overwhelmed to know that he was the first human to step foot on the rich soil that Sehun tended and kept to himself.Yoonshin slowly lifted his hand and touched his lips. The sensation of Sehun\u2019s lips lingered. Yoonshin\u2019s lips felt particularly soft.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
