    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 Divine vein awakeningNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euBai Muchen was a peak expert of the Nine Firmaments Continent. He possessed extraordinary talent in the five Heavenly Spiritual Meridians, and was called the number one genius under the starry sky.Since he was young, he had joined one of the eight great sects, the Profound Sky Sect, and stepped into the martial arts world at the age of eight. After that, he rode Juechen and became an expert at the Fortune Realm at the age of twenty-five!He had even arranged a marriage with Xuan Qingzhu, the daughter of the Heavenly Profound Sect Master, which could be said to be doted on by thousands of people.He was the brightest new star in the Nine Firmaments Continent in the past hundred years, and he was regarded as the person with the best chance of reaching the peak of martial arts.However, when he was cultivating with Xuan Qingzhu and trying to break through the bottleneck, he was plotted by his beloved woman.The Heavenly Profound Sect Master and Xuan Qingzhu's father and daughter conspired to frame Bai Muchen, causing him to go crazy and seize his Heavenly Spirit's five meridians' talent, which was absorbed by Xuan Qingzhu.Bai Muchen, who had failed to break through the bottleneck, died with hatred because of the devilish fire.Since then, Xuan Qingzhu, who was known as the number one beauty in the Nine Firmaments Continent, had stepped into the clouds, replacing Bai Muchen as one of the top characters on the Nine Firmaments Continent.Perhaps God's compassion had given Bai Muchen a chance to be a person for two generations.\" Little Nan , little Nan , you're finally awake!\"Bai Muchen slowly opened his eyes. At the same time, accompanied by intense pain in his head, the memories of the two of them mixed together.Nan, who had just turned sixteen, was a little thin and frail. He looked quite handsome, inheriting the delicacy of his mother and the handsomeness of his father.At this moment, the middle-aged man who was shaking his shoulders vigorously was a middle-aged man who looked dignified but had a haggard face.Bai Muchen looked at the middle-aged man's face empty-handed. The memories in his mind gradually became clear.It turned out that he had been reborn, reborn on a dying youth, his current physical body. His name was Xiang Nan.The Xiang Clan was once a rising clan in Cang Lan Continent, Wolong Continent, and Bluestone Town. Because the current clan head, Xiang Zhanxiong, was powerful, this clan had once enjoyed unlimited glory.However, the path of martial dao was unpredictable. When Xiang Zhanxiong broke through to the Heaven Origin Realm, he had fallen into a bottleneck. Since then, he had been trapped for twenty years, and his cultivation had not improved by a single bit. He had become a laughingstock.There are nine realms in martial arts: Body Tempering Realm-Innate Realm-Origin Realm-Heaven Origin Realm-Heaven Scryer Realm-Good Fortune Realm-Divine Martial Realm-Martial Saint-Heavenly Tribulation.Each realm had nine levels, and Xiang Zhanxiong was trapped in the ninth level of the Origin Reversion Realm, unable to break through.On the contrary, the Wang Clan, the Li Clan, the Mo Clan, and the three great clans broke through to the Heaven Origin Realm one after another, ruthlessly suppressing the Xiang Clan.Perhaps it was because these three great clans had once humbled the Xiang Clan, and now they were even more afraid that the Xiang Clan would rise again, so they would intensify their crackdown on the Xiang Clan.This was a world where everything was tested and talked about.They frantically carved up the Xiang Clan's property and secretly killed all the geniuses of the Xiang Clan, causing the Xiang Clan members to die and flee, eventually leaving behind a desolate field of withered grass in the courtyard.Xiang Zhanxiong was Xiang Nan's grandfather, and the middle-aged man in front of him was Xiang Nan's father, Xiang Shaohua.At this moment, the Xiang Clan was already in dire straits. They weren't as powerful as an ordinary wealthy clan. Apart from their parents and grandfather, there was only a loyal old housekeeper left in the entire clan. He was not abandoned by a few servants.Xiang Nan's memories went deep into Bai Muchen's heart, and he couldn't help but feel sad when he thought of the Xiang Clan's desolate scene.\"Father, this is\" Xiang Nan struggled to do it.\"Oh, it's nothing. I accidentally bumped into it last night.\" Xiang Shaohua casually wiped the blood off his forehead and said, \" little Nan , what's wrong with you? You can't even sleep after coming back last night.\"Looking at Xiang Shaohua's concerned gaze, Xiang Nan also managed to squeeze out a smile and said, \"Nothing much. Last night, there was a small mistake in training. There was no major problem. Father, please rest assured.\"Xiang Nan lied. In fact, it was the Wang Clan's Outsider Prince Zong Lin who ambushed him and broke his internal organs with a kick.If it weren't for his sudden reincarnation in Xiang Nan, this Xiang Nan would probably have died in the early hours of this morning.However, Xiang Nan knew that his father was also lying. The injury on his father's forehead was obviously caused by a weapon. It was impossible for it to be a small injury caused by a knock.\" Little Nan , your face is pale. Quickly lie down and don't move.\" Xiang Shaohua hurriedly helped Xiang Nan lie down again, his eyes filled with concern.This kind of concern caused a trace of warmth to flow through Xiang Nan's heart. In his previous life, he was extremely aloof and arrogant. He had never experienced this kind of warmth before.His only relatives were his respected master and the woman he loved the most. He never thought that the one who betrayed him would be his father and daughter.\"Not good, Young Lord, Young Master not good!\"Suddenly, the door was knocked open. A servant of the Xiang Clan rushed in in a hurry and said anxiously, \"Old Li has been caught by the Wang Clan. He is currently outside the mansion. Young Lord, hurry up and take a look.\"\"What?\" Xiang Nan and Xiang Shaohua were shocked and hurriedly ran out of the room.Old Li was the old butler who had devoted his entire life to the Xiang Clan, Li Zhong.Although Li Zhong and the Xiang Family were slaves, in the hearts of the Xiang Family, Li Zhong had always been treated as one's own family. Especially since Xiang Nan was raised by Li Zhong, that feeling was quite deep.Xiang Nan felt that although there was some pain in his body, his injuries had basically healed.\"What's going on!\" As Xiang Shaohua ran, he berated the servant, \"Didn't I tell you that no one can take half a step out of the Xiang Clan in the past month?\"Xiang Nan's mind buzzed and his memories surged. It turned out that three days later was the day of the selection of the outstanding juniors of Bluestone City.The outstanding young martial artists from the Wudao Town Selection could participate in the Bluestone City's Wudao City Selection in a month's time. At that time, there would be young geniuses from the Wolong Province's Wudao Sect.It could be said that this was the most important day for all the clans in Bluestone Town, and even for all the young martial artists in Bluestone City.If a junior of a clan was chosen by a certain Martial Arts Sect to become a disciple, then it would be a great thing for the clan to shine brightly, and their clan status would soar.The Wang Clan, one of the three great clans of Bluestone Town, was the one that attacked the Xiang manor the most ruthlessly. They drew a large circle around the entire the Xiang manor and warned that within a month, those from the the Xiang manor who stepped out of the circle would be killed without mercy!The purpose was to prevent the Xiang Family from participating in the Martial Town Election and the Martial City Election.Thinking of this, Xiang Nan clenched his fists tightly, his eyes almost spitting out fire. He thought to himself, Wang Clan, you dare touch a hair on my Grandfather Li Zhong!The father and son rushed out of the mansion and saw a group of Wang Clan youths looking at them in a cruel manner.Three steps away from the entrance of the the Xiang manor was a long red line. That red line represented the Xiang manor 's life and death line.Outside the red line, Wang Jiayuan's Prince Zong Lin was leading a group of subordinates, and under his feet, Li Zhong, who was bleeding from the corner of his mouth, was stepping on a dead dog!Wang Zonglin caught a glimpse of Xiang Nan with a slightly different expression. He muttered to himself in a very small voice, \"This brat is actually still alive? Could it be that he attacked too lightly last night?\"\"Wang Zonglin!\" Xiang Shaohua poured blood into his pupils and angrily said, \"Let go of Li Zhong!\"As Wang Zonglin stepped on Li Zhong, he pointed at the red line between the two sides and said, \"We said that the Xiang Clan that crossed this red line will be killed without mercy.\"\"Could it be that you've taken my Wang Clan's words for granted?\"Someone beside him immediately laughed loudly, \"Do you really think you are still the the Xiang manor ? Old dog Xiang Zhanxiong hasn't left the Xiang manor for three years, so he might have died long ago.\"\"Old dog\" Xiang Shaohua's body trembled with anger. Unfortunately, he was not born to be a martial artist. He had cultivated bitterly for 40 years, but he was only a small Body Tempering Stage fifth layer martial artist.Xiang Nan's talent was much better than his father's, but he wasn't that outstanding. He was only sixteen years old and had only reached the seventh level of Body Tempering.However, Wang Zonglin, a 16-year-old distant relative of the Wang Clan, was already an expert at the ninth level of Body Tempering!\"Wang Zonglin, get rid of your dirty feet.\" Xiang Nan took a step forward. His toes were just about to touch the red line. He said in a deep voice, \"Aren't you worried that my Xiang family will participate in the martial arts town election?\"\"I can promise you, as long as you let Grandpa Li go, I will withdraw \u2026\"\"Young Master, no!\" Half of Li Zhong's face was trampled on the ground. At this moment, he did not know where the strength came from. He suddenly raised his head and said with difficulty, \"This old man's remnant life is not worth anything. Young Master, you \u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, Li Zhong was stomped back by Wang Zonglin, and he even used the sole of his shoe to ruthlessly crush Li Zhong's face twice.Seeing this scene, Xiang Nan immediately clenched his hands tightly and gritted his teeth, saying word by word, \"Let go of Grandpa Li. I will be chosen not to go by Wudao Town.\"Wang Zonglin looked up and smiled, \"It's just an old dog raised by a family. It's worth your sacrifice. You're truly a loser. It seems that even without the suppression of my Wang family, your Xiang family wouldn't have done much.\"\"Since you want this old dog, I will return it to you.\"With that, Wang Zonglin picked up Li Zhong and kicked him on the back.Li Zhong immediately flew out, and Xiang Nan Xiang Shaohua and his son charged forward, stopping Li Zhong from flying backwards.\"Grandpa Li!\" Xiang Nan looked at Li Zhong's injuries and saw that his internal organs were shattered by Wang Zonglin's kick just like he did last night.\"Old Li\" Xiang Shaohua's eyes also became moist. He supported Li Zhong and choked, \"You are \u2026 why bother.\"Although Li Zhong's mouth had been bleeding, he forced a smile, \"Young Lord, Young Madam is not well. As a servant, you can see it in your eyes and feel pain in your heart. This is \u2026 this is me \u2026 cough cough \u2026\"As he spoke, Li Zhong trembled as he took out something from his bosom. The Xiang Clan's father and son were already in tears when they saw his colleague.It was a bag of herbs!Xiang Nan's mind buzzed. He finally understood why Grandpa Li was lying on the ground when he was trampled by Wang Zonglin, and his back was slightly arched!It turned out that Li Zhong had risked his life to protect this bag of herbs!Li Zhong had been beaten by Wang Zonglin to the point that his bones were broken, a long shirt was tattered, and even his organs were shattered. However, this bag of herbs was unexpectedly intact.\"Old Li!\" Xiang Shaohua pinched the herbs and choked, \"My Xiang Clan \u2026 I'm sorry about you.\"\"Grandfather.\" Xiang Nan grabbed Li Zhong's hand and said, \"Grandpa, little Nan still wants to play with Grandpa and go to the back mountain to pick mushrooms with Grandpa. Grandpa, don't go \u2026\"Li Zhong kindly stroked Xiang Nan's temples, and the doting look in his eyes was as warm as the sun. \"Good child \u2026 Grandpa Li, cough \u2026 I can't accompany you anymore.\"\"Grandpa Li is leaving. You have to take good care of yourself \u2026\"\"Old \u2026 Old man, I have served the Xiang Clan all my life. Now that I am able to die for the Xiang Clan, it can be considered \u2026 it can also be considered \u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, Li Zhong spat out a mouthful of blood on Xiang Nan's chest and died.At this moment, Xiang Nan felt as if he had been struck by five bolts of lightning. At the same time, a thunderclap exploded from his dantian!The divine veins in his body that had been hidden for a long time had awakened!Liked it?

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 Make a forceful movePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euA martial artist's innate talent was divided into several grades, which were Mortal Grade, Spirit Grade, Earth Grade, and Heavenly Grade.Each level of talent had five types of affinity for the five elements, known as the five meridians: wind, wood, water, fire, and earth.Wind represented the potential of speed, wood represented the potential of life, water represented the potential of enduring battle, fire represented the potential of battle, and earth represented the potential of the physical body.Most martial artists did not possess the affinity of the five meridians, but they only needed to possess one affinity to be considered a genius!Take the Mortal Grade talent as an example. Under the heavens, there were countless martial artists who possessed the lowest level of Mortal Veins. It was like crossing a river.However, if there was a person who possessed the Mortal Grade Fire Vein, and he only needed to cultivate diligently, then he would suddenly rise up. This meant that his explosive power and combat strength would far surpass that of an ordinary martial artist.If one possessed two types of pulse affinity in a talent level, then this kind of person could be called a genius.In his previous life, Bai Muchen had five types of meridians! Including five affinities! Moreover, it was the highest level of the five heavenly meridians!This was also why Bai Muchen was called the number one genius in the starry sky.However, what others did not know was that Bai Muchen actually had six meridians! Apart from the wind, wood, water, fire, and earth, there was another vein that was always hidden.Bai Muchen had always known about his hidden bloodline, but he had never been able to develop it. The reason for that was because he had never been able to find it in his entire life.Later, Bai Muchen was killed, and the five Heavenly Spiritual Meridians were also seized by Xuan Qingzhu.Perhaps, this could be considered a blessing in disguise? After his rebirth, Bai Muchen, the current Xiang Nan, had actually awakened the last bloodline that Xuan Qingzhu had failed to seize!Rumbling thunder exploded in Xiang Nan's dantian. The sound was like a bolt from the blue, but only Xiang Nan could feel it.\"This is\" Xiang Nan was stunned, and then his heart was incomparably shocked.Divine Grade! Lightning Meridian!Divine grade talent was definitely at the legendary level. Throughout the entire history of martial arts, there were only a few records of divine grade talent. No one had ever been able to say clearly what kind of existence divine grade talent was.Even for Xiang Nan, this divine vein was still filled with uncertainties.Originally, Xiang Nan, who had been robbed of his strongest talent, was already disheartened. The clinker had been bestowed upon him by the heavens, awakening his last pulse. It turned out that it was a divine pulse that was one level higher than the five Heavenly Spiritual Meridians.The cycle of the Heavenly Dao, retribution was not good!However, at this moment, Xiang Nan was extremely grieved and didn't have much time to slowly think about his talent.\"Wang Zonglin!\" Xiang Nan suddenly turned around and angrily pointed at Wang Zonglin and shouted, \"I have promised to give up the Martial Arts Town Election, but you still refuse to let go of an old man who is in his late teens!\"Wang Zonglin crossed his shoulders and mocked, \"I can kill as many old dogs as I want, Li Zhong. I'm not afraid to tell you the truth, my Wang Clan will definitely eat you!\"\"One day with my Wang Clan here, your surname Xiang will behave like a dog and lie down obediently!\"\"There's something else.\" Wang Zonglin pointed at the red line beneath his feet and said, \"Your useless father secretly went to get medicine for your sickly mother today, but he was surrounded by us. He was lucky enough to escape back to the Xiang manor.\"\"Could it be that your Xiang Clan remembers whether to eat or not? Have you forgotten the pain after recovering from the scar?\"It turned out that Xiang Shaohua had actually done the same thing as Li Zhong. The scar on his forehead was left behind by the Wang family.\"Good, good, good!\" Xiang Nan greeted him three times in a row. He laughed furiously, \"Since you didn't even care about these words and put them out in front of everyone, then let's settle the old debt together with the new debt.\"With that, Xiang Nan turned around and returned to the Xiang manor.Outside the mansion, Wang Zonglin laughed loudly, \"You little seventh level Body Tempering martial artist, you want to fight to the death with me at the dignified first level of the Xiantian realm? You're simply courting death.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan strode out of the Xiang manor with a Xiang Family steel gun in his hand.\" Little Nan , don't be impulsive. You're not his match.\" Xiang Shaohua's expression changed drastically. His Xiang Clan had already fallen to this point, and he could no longer lose his only son.The martial dao realm could be said to be the first level of the Heavens, and the Body Tempering realm was the body refining realm. The first level of the body refining realm represented the lethality of a punch of one hundred kilograms.Wang Zonglin was at the ninth level of Body Tempering, and his punch had a strength of 900 jin.As for Xiang Nan, he was only at the seventh level of Body Tempering, which was only 700 jin. The gap between him and Wang Zonglin was still very big.However, Xiang Nan's killing intent had already been decided. He carried the spear backwards and walked out step by step.Xiang Shaohua originally wanted to stop Xiang Nan, but at that moment, he saw a trace of strangeness on Xiang Nan's face, an expression of arrogance.This unfamiliar arrogance made Xiang Shaohua hesitate, as if he couldn't recognize his son.This kind of arrogance is the imposing manner of not lowering my head to look at ants, not raising my head to look at the heavens, my feet stepping on the earth, everything beneath my feet!Xiang Nan held his head high, his waist straight, and crossed the red line with his spear in his hand!Wang Zonglin was stunned for a moment. He didn't expect Xiang Nan to actually dare to come out.At this moment, Xiang Nan's second foot also stepped out. He tilted his head slightly and said in a low voice, \"I've crossed the red line. I'm going to buy a good coffin for my Grandpa Li now.\"\"You, stop me!\"Wang Zonglin was stunned and angrily said, \"What a trash kid! How dare you shout at me! I'll take this opportunity to kill you!\"After saying that, Wang Zonglin pulled out a low-grade Spirit Grade saber from his back. The power in his body surged and he slashed down fiercely towards Xiang Nan.Weapons, martial arts, and the same cultivation realm were divided into Mortal Grade, Spirit Grade, Earth Grade, Heaven Grade, Profound Grade, Dao Grade, and Divine Grade.Wang Zonglin's saber was using the Wang Clan's Intermediate Spiritual Grade Saber Technique, the Yuan Shattering Saber Technique! This saber strike had forced Wang Zonglin's basic strength to 1,300 jin!However, what Xiang Nan had learned earlier was only an ordinary mid-grade cultivation technique, the Xiang Clan Spear. It could force a maximum of 700 jin of strength to 800 jin.Thus, the Wang Clan's ridiculing laughter that frightened the crowd immediately rang out in the surroundings.However, Xiang Nan could no longer hear the ear-piercing sounds of mockery. In his mind, he quickly recalled a cultivation technique he had seen before.Back then, Bai Muchen had seen a rare lightning-attributed cultivation technique called the Rushing Lightning Spear.Actually, this cultivation technique wasn't too powerful. It was only a low-grade spirit grade cultivation technique, but because of its lightning attribute, its power far surpassed that of a cultivation technique of the same level!\"Alright!\" Xiang Nan took a deep breath and thought to himself, \"I want to see just how strong this Divine Grade Lightning Meridian talent is!\"It was also at this moment that Wang Zonglin leapt up high and slashed down with his saber. He shouted, \"Heaven Breaking Slash!\"The Yuan Shattering Saber Technique, Heaven Breaking Slash, carried a terrifying strength of 1,300 jin as it slashed towards Xiang Nan.Even if he thought about it with his toes, he knew who was stronger.However, what shocked everyone was that Xiang Nan didn't dodge or dodge and actually shot at Wang Zonglin's saber!He had slashed down from top to bottom, but Xiang Nan had raised his spear from bottom to top. Not to mention the rest, Xiang Nan was at a great disadvantage just because of his position.\"Haha, this brat is courting death!\" Everyone burst into laughter.Xiang Shaohua's heart was burning with anxiety. He had already stepped forward and prepared to charge forward. No matter what, he had to save his son.At this critical moment, the knives and spears collided!\"Jing Long \u2026 go out to sea!\" Xiang Nan muttered to himself.This was one of the techniques of the Rushing Thunder Spear, and it was also one of the simplest starting moves. It was called Dragon Awakening!At this moment, the Lightning Veins in Xiang Nan's dantian suddenly became irritable. They surged with lightning, and the power of the Lightning Veins instantly filled Xiang Nan's entire body.At the same time, the power in Xiang Nan's body instantly exploded!700 jin! 800 jin! Nine hundred \u2026 it's still rising!1111! One thousand two! One thousand three, one thousand four! Fifteen thousand!The terrifying lightning attribute increased the strength of Xiang Nan's spear to 1500 jin like an explosion!The blades and spears collided, producing a loud sound that caused one's eardrums to ache.The Lightning Meridian Attribute was indeed worthy of its resounding reputation!\"Hiss\" Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air on the first floor and took half a step back in shock.Wang Zonglin was actually knocked over by Xiang Nan's spear! Even the man and the gun were sent flying. The saber in his hand rose high into the sky and spun buzzing.Wang Zonglin's body quickly fell down. The tremendous vibrating force caused Wang Zonglin to spit out a mouthful of red blood.The moment Wang Zonglin shot backwards, Xiang Nan suddenly took a step forward and held his gun! Attack! The spear was like a lightning dragon, piercing through Wang Zonglin's heart!Rolling hot blood flowed down the shaft of the gun and onto Xiang Nan's right hand, turning into a line of blood.Xiang Nan raised his spear and thrust Wang Zonglin into the air.A gust of wind blew through the corner of Wang Zonglin's robe, which was still flipping.Body Tempering Seventh Layer, one shot to kill a Body Tempering Ninth Layer expert!Xiang Nan looked ahead and didn't even look at Wang Zonglin. He said in a deep voice, \"I'll take your dog life as a tribute to Grandpa Li.\"It was only at this moment that the Wang Family's subordinates woke up from their dreams and rushed forward one by one with roars.It wasn't that they weren't afraid of death, but that Wang Zonglin was dead. If they didn't give the Wang Clan an explanation, they would die on their way back.Seven or eight Body Tempering Seventh Stage martial artists rushed forward at the same time. Xiang Nan took a deep breath and muttered in his heart, \"Dragon Spear!\"The spear was like a dragon, a fast spear.Light! Swift! Accurate! Hate!Xiang Nan stood almost where he was. With a slight step, he fired his spear everywhere. The spear tip attacked so quickly that it formed a fan-shaped spear shadow in midair!The fan-shaped spear figure disappeared in a flash. Xiang Nan stopped his hand and carried the spear behind him as he strode forward.The seven or eight martial artists were still in mid-air. At this moment, they were all pouncing on the spot where Xiang Nan was just now, but none of them could raise their heads again.Each of these people had a bloody hole pierced through their hearts, and their blood hadn't yet dyed their clothes red.The Lightning Meridian talent not only possessed an extremely powerful explosive power, but also possessed a world-shocking speed!\"Father.\" Xiang Nan took three steps forward and said without turning his head, \"It's time to pay off the debts owed to us by the three great clans.\"\"Please stay in the Xiang manor and prepare for Grandpa Li's funeral. I'll go pick a coffin and come later.\"The sky was cloudy and drizzling, and the streets of Bluestone Town were sparsely populated.Xiang Nan walked in the rain with his spear on his back. His emotions were complicated and difficult to understand, and his eyes gradually became firm.Life is precious. Since the heavens have given me another chance to revive, and given me a heaven-defying divine talent, I must make good use of it this time.Bluestone Town was not small. It belonged to Bluestone City and was one of the most prosperous towns under Bluestone City's rule. Because of the existence of the three great clans, the town's reputation was very resounding.At the end of the Grand Dao in front of him was a coffin shop.After Xiang Nan expressed his intention to come, he was told that the coffin had to be ordered beforehand.This scene made Xiang Nan immediately realize how insignificant his understanding of the real world was.In the past, he could be said to have used money like earth. He never had to care about any worldly matters. As long as he wanted something, the Profound Sky Sect would help him obtain it.He didn't even know that coffins needed to be reserved.Liked it?

    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 Rain Night BerserkPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\"I can pay more, but I have to get the coffin today.\" Xiang Nan thought for a moment and took out a cloth bag. When he opened it, a bag full of silver coins scattered on the counter. There could be more than 300 silver coins.The shopkeeper of the coffin shop was overjoyed when he saw the silver coins. He hurriedly said, \"The Zhang family in the east of the city has ordered a coffin for Old Master Zhang in advance. It has just been completed. If you are in a hurry, this coffin can be given to you first.\"It was a fine golden nanmu coffin, with even braced carvings on it.\"Sure.\" Xiang Nan sized up the coffin. Although it was still far from what he had expected, this was still a small town. It was already quite good to have a Golden Nanmu coffin.\"Alright.\" The shopkeeper put away the silver coins and rubbed his hands with a smile, \"Go ahead. I'll have a few assistants carry them to your mansion later.\"\"No need, I'll take it myself.\" Xiang Nan expressionlessly carried the huge and heavy coffin on his shoulder and walked out of the shop with one hand clasped in his arms.The shopkeeper of the coffin shop looked at Xiang Nan's back with envy on his face. A martial artist in the dark was good. A coffin as big as this would normally take a lot of effort to carry. However, Xiang Nan looked as if he could carry it effortlessly at such a young age.The rain outside was getting heavier and heavier, and the dark clouds in the sky were occasionally mixed with the sound of rolling thunder.\"That's all my savings.\" Xiang Nan thought while carrying the coffin.The Xiang Clan had long since fallen into a terrible state of despair. They were almost unable to pay for their daily expenses, and Xiang Nan was even more short of money. Now, he even spent the only three hundred silver coins he had.However, cultivating martial arts is an act of burning money. Without money, even if you have the talent of number one in the world, it would be difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice.Xiang Nan rubbed his chin and suddenly remembered something from the past. \"Oh right \u2026 this is the Wolong Continent, I vaguely remember \u2026\"In his previous life, he had a treasure map. The treasure should be nearby. Back then, he hadn't been here because of the distance. Now, he could go take a look.Mm \u2026 Thinking about it carefully, those things should be buried in the Wolong Continent and the Black Sharp Mountain Range. They shouldn't be far from here.Xiang Nan was pondering, but his footsteps gradually slowed down. He looked up and saw a dozen black-clothed men standing quietly in the middle of the street opposite him.\"You came quite quickly.\" Xiang Nan carried the coffin and narrowed his eyes. \"But isn't it too much of a joke to deal with me with such a small number of people?\" He said.It hadn't rained when he killed Wang Zonglin. There were some bystanders around. Someone must have tipped off the Wang Clan.As he said this, Xiang Nan secretly observed that according to the fluctuations of the weather in the bodies of the dozen or so black-clothed men, there were actually two Xiantian First Stage experts!As for the others, they were all at the eighth to ninth level of Body Tempering.Most of these people were twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and they should be the generals raised by the Wang Clan.This time, Xiang Nan's expression became serious. The strength of a Xiantian realm expert did not start from 1,000 jin, because the Xiantian realm expert's body had already condensed Xiantian Weather!Therefore, the actual basic strength of a Xiantian 1-dan expert was 2,100 jin!Among the crowd, the two Xiantian experts took a step forward. One of them should be the boss. He smiled sinisterly and said, \"You are quite courageous. Even our Wang Clan's outsiders dare to kill you. However, your luck is pretty good.\"\"If not for the fact that the Wang Clan's elders had all gone to the City Lord's Mansion to attend the wedding banquet, you would definitely have died even more miserably.\"\"A wedding banquet?\" Xiang Nan frowned slightly. It seemed that the Wang Clan did not know that Wang Zonglin had been killed by him. Only the clans that stayed behind would deal with him ahead of time.However, City Lord Bluestone City? He only has two sons. Didn't he start a family long ago? There was no such thing as a wedding banquet.The leading Xiantian expert laughed loudly, \"For the sake of your imminent death, there's no harm in telling you.\"\"Today is the engagement of Xuan Qingzhu, daughter of the Nine Firmaments Continent's Heavenly Profound Sect Master, and Feiyun Liuhai, son of the Soaring Cloud Sect Master.\"\"The marriage of two of the eight great sects is an earth-shattering event!\"\"Together, the two great sects have scattered countless amounts of money, causing the entire world to celebrate! Even our Blue Tide Continent has been affected.\"As he said this, the leader was extremely arrogant, as if it was already a great deal of face for him to be able to attend such a wedding banquet.\"What a large sum of money.\" Xiang Nan felt a faint pain in his heart. The woman he once loved deeply, and the woman who betrayed him, had finally come together with Feiyun Liuhai.Xiang Nan took a deep breath and closed his eyes.\"Alright, I've talked enough nonsense to you. We have to take your head in advance and go back to report!\" The Xiantian Clan General waved his hand and eleven experts immediately rushed forward.Xiang Nan remained motionless, his eyes still closed, but in his heart, he was doing a meticulous plan that no one else could have imagined.With my current strength, confronting those two Xiantian First Stage experts head-on will definitely not bring me any benefits. Especially since there are so many of them, consuming them will be detrimental to me.Since it was impossible to clash head-on, he could only use his brilliant battle techniques to win, striving for a quick conclusion!At this moment, eleven experts had already arrived in front of Xiang Nan. The three at the front drew out their long sabers and launched an attack!At the same time, Xiang Nan suddenly opened his eyes, and a light flashed in his eyes.With a loud boom, he placed the coffin on the ground. At the same time, he rushed forward with a gun in one hand!A short charge, slightly tilted, dodging the two knives, the spear pierced through the chest of the first person, his left arm bent to block the neck of the second person!Then, Xiang Nan took a step forward and pulled out the spear from the back of the first person's body. He threw the second person with his left arm and collided with the third person.The spear swung and pierced through the chest of the second and third person!In one move, he killed three people in a row! That movement was smooth and flowing without the slightest delay.\"This\" Not far away, the expressions of the two Xiantian generals who were hugging their shoulders and laughing coldly changed drastically.The leading general was shocked, \"Something is wrong with this brat! He is clearly only at the seventh level of Body Tempering, but why does he have such astonishing speed and strength?\"The junior general next to the leader shouted, \"How did he do it? How did he manage to walk so smoothly in such a dense attack?\"At this moment, Xiang Nan had already entered a state of absolute concentration. In the shower, he killed three people at a time!\"There are still eight\" Xiang Nan pulled back his spear and dodged the long blade slashed at him by the fourth man. His left hand clenched the enemy's wrist and slightly trembled. The enemy's wrist was immediately dislocated and the steel saber fell.Xiang Nan soared into the air and kicked the hilt of the saber with his left foot. The steel saber flew out with a whoosh, piercing through the fifth person's eyebrows! At the same time, the spear in his hand swept across!The Rushing Thunder Spear swept through a thousand troops!The spear swept out, sending three people flying in succession. A long spear was fiercely thrown out, and both of its feet shot onto the ground. Its entire body rushed out like an arrow that had left a string.The spear pierced through the space between the fourth person's eyebrows. Xiang Nan happened to arrive and casually pulled out the spear from the back of the fourth person's head. His legs clasped around the sixth person's neck!A beautiful pair of scissors kicked the sixth man up and grabbed the gun with his right hand! He pierced through the neck of the seventh person and kicked the spear back with his left foot, causing the spear that pierced through the neck of the sixth person to stand up and kick the shaft of the spear heavily!The spear pierced through the sixth man and flew out, piercing through the seventh man's chest.\"Hurry! Hurry up and attack! Something's wrong with this brat!\" The leader shouted in horror and rushed forward with another Xiantian expert.It wasn't that these two experts were too slow, but that Xiang Nan was too fast!The remaining four eighth level Body Tempering generals were already stunned by Xiang Nan's action, and their movements instantly slowed down.Xiang Nan's eyes were fixed on the two Xiantian generals, while the weapons in his hands were attacking the four Body Tempering generals. These four people had no ability to resist in Xiang Nan's hands and were instantly killed.\"You're courting death!\" The leader sliced down the long saber in his hand, and a small arc of saber Qi rushed towards him.A sign unique to the Xiantian realm, the weather first!Xiang Nan forcefully twisted his body. The saber Qi almost shot out from his shoulder. Even half of his sleeve was cut off, but Xiang Nan ignored it at all. He was not in a hurry to make a move.Almost at the same time, the attack of the second Xiantian Clan general arrived. The Xiantian Clan general wiped out the long saber in his hand horizontally. The arc-shaped crescent saber Qi was intended to slash Xiang Nan's waist.Although the cultivation methods of these two people weren't as high as Wang Zonglin's, their cultivation realms were still high. With 2,100 jin of basic strength amplified by the cultivation methods, they would be around 2,300 jin!Xiang Nan's small seventh level body tempering realm immediately felt exhausted!\"Let me see how you can escape!\" The leader's eyes were already shining with triumph.As a result, a faint arc suddenly appeared at the corner of Xiang Nan's mouth. His entire body suddenly jumped up, his body swinging horizontally in mid-air, and he rotated at high speed!\"Raptors swing their tails!\" Xiang Nan shouted in his heart. With the help of his body's lateral rotation speed, he swung the spear longitudinally.The Lightning Meridian Innate Ability in his body was activated, and his seven hundred jin strength increased to fifteen thousand kilograms! With a loud swing of his spear, Peng landed on the leader's neck, smashing the leader's entire body to the ground.The spear continued to advance, and in the second half, it landed on the stomach of another general, sending the general flying.Seeing the opportunity, Xiang Nan's feet suddenly jumped again the moment he landed. A spear pierced through the heart of the general in the air and pulled it out from his back. Then, he threw the spear towards the ground.That gun had just pierced through the back of the general's neck!Xiang Nan relied on his astonishing combat skills to make up for the gap in cultivation realms.Rain poured down, and the rolling blood flowed everywhere.Xiang Nan landed lightly on the ground. The spear rotated half a circle in his hand, and with a whoosh, he turned back behind him. Then, he carried the coffin with one hand and walked towards the depths of the rain curtain.Xuan Qingzhu, today is your wedding day. The scenery is truly boundless. Even the distant Blue Tide Continent is helping you celebrate.And do you remember that there was once a Bai Muchen in this world?When you were smiling and welcoming thousands of people, I was alone in the rain killing people.One attracted the attention of tens of thousands of people, while the other traveled alone in the night rain.Qingzhu, Master, Mu Chen will come back for you.Liked it?

When it rains on a cloudy day, I can't get up.\"Xiang Nan nodded, \"I want to see my mother. Put away this coffin and we'll bury Grandpa Li tomorrow.\"After passing through the empty courtyards, Xiang Nan's footsteps slowed down slightly. This place was once bustling with flowers, but now, it was so desolate that no one paid attention to it.\"No matter what, my fleshly body belongs to the Xiang Clan. I will be as loyal and filial to the Xiang Clan as Xiang Nan is.\"Xiang Nan clenched his fists and pushed the door open.The room was very big, but it was also very empty. Over the years, the Xiang Clan had deteriorated. The valuable furniture had basically been sold, and the air was filled with a faint smell of inferior herbs.Xiang Nan stood quietly beside the bed, carefully examining the middle-aged woman. A soft light gradually appeared in his eyes.Xiang Nan suddenly felt a little relieved. Perhaps his death wasn't a bad thing.After he died once, he had a mother that he had never had in his previous life.He slowly retreated outside the door and said, \"Mother, I hope you will recover soon.\"\"Father, I want to see grandfather.\" Xiang Nan found Xiang Shaohua and said solemnly.Xiang Shaohua hesitated for a moment and muttered, \"But your grandfather hasn't come out of seclusion for three years, so you\u2019re interrupting him without permission \u2026\"Xiang Nan shook his head slightly. \"Your son knows.\"Xiang Shaohua hesitated for a moment before leading his son to the deepest courtyard.Xiang Shaohua had many questions about why his son had suddenly become so strong, and why his temper was calmer than before.Xiang Zhanxiong's seclusion was in an extremely deep underground secret room in the Xiang manor.The father and son arrived one after another and knocked on the stone door. After a full cup of tea, a deep voice came from inside the door, \"Come in.\"Xiang Shaohua patted Xiang Nan on the shoulder and turned to leave.Xiang Nan entered the stone room, closed the stone door and said, \"Grandpa Li Zhong has gone.\"Hearing this, a long sigh came from the shadow of the stone room. The sigh contained helplessness and guilt.Through the light, Xiang Nan observed his own grandfather, Xiang Zhanxiong. His nose and mouth were wide, his eyebrows were sharp, and his eyebrows revealed a heroic aura. However, the white hair on his temples was enough to show that this old man had been living a very depressed life in recent years.The Xiang Clan's only backing now was Xiang Zhanxiong. He had been trapped in the ninth level of the Origin Core Realm for so many years, so perhaps there was a way to help him break through.Xiang Nan looked at Xiang Zhanxiong's face at this moment, and his heart was more or less full of emotions.Xiang Zhanxiong also looked at Xiang Nan and said, \"Have you reached the seventh level of Body Tempering? It seems that we, little Nan , are very diligent.\"Xiang Nan bowed slightly and said, \" little Nan doesn't dare to neglect. Grandpa, have you been cultivating smoothly recently?\"These words made Xiang Zhanxiong even more worried. It seemed that there was still no progress in breaking through the bottleneck.The grandfather and grandson chatted for a long time before they parted ways.Xiang Nan thought to himself. Grandpa's eyebrows were glittering with red light, and his words were filled with anger. Obviously, it wasn't a mistake in his cultivation, but he had really encountered a bottleneck.Xiang Nan did have a way to help his grandfather through this difficult time. The key was that he didn't have any money, so he couldn't buy the spirit herbs and spirit pills he needed. At this time, the Xiang Clan's financial resources had long since dried up.After returning to his room, Xiang Nan sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to refine his pill field and raise his martial arts realm.With his heaven-defying divine talent and the conjoined body technique of the Thunder Spear, he had entered the breakthrough stage in less than an incense stick of time, reaching the eighth level of the Body Tempering Realm!However, at the moment of his breakthrough, Xiang Nan felt a great sense of emptiness appear in his body. His skin was rapidly aging at a visible rate, and even wrinkles had appeared.Xiang Nan hurriedly stopped, his expression extremely solemn. Gradually, the wrinkles on his skin dissipated again.'\"No\" Xiang Nan shook his head and thought to himself, \"Upgrading my cultivation realm will rapidly drain the spiritual energy from my body. If I increase my cultivation recklessly, I will become a dried corpse.\"Without spirit herbs or pills, raising one's cultivation level would be equivalent to courting death. However, ordinary first-grade spirit herbs were also worth three hundred gold coins!Both pills and spirit herbs were divided into ninth grade. Spirit herbs were important ingredients for refining pills. A single pill was tens or even hundreds of times more valuable than a spirit herb of the same grade!Xiang Nan smiled bitterly. He didn't even have a first-grade spirit herb. A medicinal pill? It was a kind of daydreaming luxury.It's time to take a look at the treasure trove.Xiang Nan did not hesitate at all. He took advantage of the heavy rain and rushed to the Black Sharp Mountain Range overnight.The Black Sharp Mountain Range was located at the border of Bluestone Town, so the journey wasn't too far.Xiang Nan shuttled through the mountains and forests, constantly recalling the location of the treasure trove in his mind.\"I found it! So it really exists.\" Xiang Nan pushed open the dense bushes and found the stone door in front of a section of the mountain wall.At this moment, a red light suddenly appeared in the distant sky.Xiang Nan turned around and saw that it must be Blue Stone City releasing fireworks to celebrate Xuan Qingzhu's engagement.Xiang Nan recalled the last words that Xuan Qingzhu had said before he died.\"Mu Chen, I really liked you.\"\"But I won't regret killing you today. Between love and the future, I choose the future.\"This was the last thing Xuan Qingzhu said to Bai Muchen before the steel needle in her hand landed between his eyebrows.\"Heh \u2026 future?\" Xiang Nan laughed miserably.\"Xuan Qingzhu, is this what you want?\"\"Let's meet again in the future! At that time, I hope you won't regret it either.\"With that, Xiang Nan strode into the cave and disappeared into the darkness.In the depths of the cave, lights shone.In an instant, the multicolored colors shone on Xiang Nan, making him unable to open his eyes.\"My God \u2026\" Xiang Nan was stunned.Inside the cave, it was beaten into a small palace pattern. In the middle, there was a pile of gold coins as tall as two people. It was simply a small mountain of gold coins.It was roughly estimated that there were at least five to six million gold coins! Such a large number, even in the most glorious period of the Xiang Clan, it had never been possessed before.\"Mm\" Xiang Nan was overjoyed, \"So much gold is enough to buy the spiritual herbs I need.\"Beside the walls of the small palace were rows of wooden frames.The south wall wooden shelves were filled with all sorts of calligraphy, paintings, and antiques. The value of these items was astonishing! Another good income.However, he had no choice but to not sell these things. Now that he was too weak, it was easy for him to stir up trouble.On the north wall, there was also a whole row of wooden shelves, all of which were filled with spirit herbs and even medicinal pills!A light flashed in Xiang Nan's eyes.Liked it?

    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 Trap oneself in a trapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euXiang Nan counted the wealth he had obtained and couldn't help but start to breathe quickly.Spirit herbs were fine. The key was that medicinal pills were definitely priceless! You may not even be able to buy it even if you have money. You value luck very much.There were plenty of spirit herb pills here, enough to break through the bottleneck for Grandpa!Xiang Nan was very impolite and directly swallowed a Tier 1 Fire Bath Pill.There were also high-grade third-grade fire bathing pills, but he still didn't dare to eat them. Because his cultivation level was too low, if he ate a pill of too high a grade, his body would explode and die.As the name implied, the Flame Bath Pill was a kind of thing that could violently purify the meridians of martial artists, and it could also strengthen their dantian.Very quickly, the fierce medicinal properties of the Fire Bath Pill burned inside Xiang Nan's body. He could clearly feel his meridians being baptized by the medicinal properties of fire.He immediately sat cross-legged, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, once again breaking through to the eighth level of Body Tempering!Xiang Nan instantly broke through to the eighth level of Body Tempering! There was no longer a state of exhaustion.\"Whoosh\" Xiang Nan let out a deep breath and slowly stood up, allowing the remaining medicinal herbs in his body to continue to nourish his body.He had just broken through to the eighth layer, so it was not appropriate for him to immediately break through to the ninth layer. His body still needed a short period of adaptation.A first-grade fire bathing pill was indeed a good thing!Finally, look at the east wall.On the first wooden shelf on the east wall, there were two small brocade boxes. When they opened, they were actually two priceless intermediate storage rings!Xiang Nan couldn't help but laugh and put one on his finger.A storage ring was a spatial ring. A primary storage ring could store one cubic meter of dead objects, an intermediate storage ring could store ten cubic meters of dead objects, and a high-grade storage ring could store a hundred cubic meters of dead objects.The starting price of an Intermediate Storage Ring in the auction house was three million gold coins! Ordinary people simply couldn't afford to wear it.The other storage ring should be left to Grandpa.Looking back, there were seven sets of gorgeous embroidered clothes hanging on the wall. Each set was magnificent, made of ice silk, and was extremely valuable.After the seven sets of luxurious clothes, there was a small, pitch black vest. This vest was jet black and heavy, but when held in his hand, it suddenly fell.\"Third Grade Profound Snake Leather Armor, not bad. Third Grade Profound Snake is equivalent to the Origin Returning Realm\"Although this leather armor does not carry any Yuan Qi defense, it is comparable to the skin defense of an Origin Returning Realm expert. It can withstand three fatal strikes from an Origin Returning Realm First Layer expert.\"He put the Black Snake Leather Armor on his body on the spot, which could be considered as an additional life-saving treasure.Next, there was a wooden shelf under the east wall. On top of it was an ancient wooden box. Opening the wooden box, there was an uncovered book lying inside.Xiang Nan curiously picked up the book and flipped through it. He discovered that the book recorded the life of the owner of the treasure.The owner of this cave was called the Heavenly Thunder Martial King. He was a great figure three thousand years ago. He possessed a rare heavenly-grade lightning vein talent! In just fifty years, he had already stepped onto the peak of martial arts, becoming a Heavenly Tribulation Realm expert.However, this person was too obsessed with martial arts. He even reached the state of madness. He actually tried to break through to the Heavenly Tribulation Realm to find a way to rise to a higher level. Thus, he devoted all of his life to learning and created a heaven-defying cultivation technique, the Nine Transformations of Thunder!However, because the Nine Transformations of Thunder were too heaven-defying, the Heavenly Lightning Martial King himself had failed to cultivate and died from being devilish.Xiang Nan was completely stunned when he flipped through the contents of the next page.After a long time, Xiang Nan finally regained his senses, \"Nine Transformations of Thunder! This second half of the book is actually the incantation of Nine Transformations of Thunder!\"Only now did Xiang Nan realize how terrifying the Nine Transformations of Thunder were! This was simply a cultivation technique that shouldn't have appeared in the world! This was because cultivating the Nine Transformations of Thunder required absorbing a total of nine types of divine lightning!If he truly succeeded in practicing the Nine Transformations of Thunder, he would possess the power to pierce through the heavens and earth, overturn the rivers and overturn the seas, and destroy a world with a flick of his finger!Divine lightning was a kind of ferocious lightning bred from heaven and earth. Every kind of divine lightning that descended on the world would definitely cause heaven and earth catastrophe. That was an existence that even martial arts experts would not dare to touch easily.After each type of divine lightning descended into the world, it would leave behind a \"lightning source\".What was even more terrifying was that there was actually a thunder talisman on the last page of the cultivation technique! It was described in the book that this lightning talisman actually contained the lightning source of the White Flame Blazing Lightning, which was ranked 17th on the Divine Lightning Rankings!Xiang Nan held the lightning talisman and struggled in his heart.If he wanted to take revenge, he had to cultivate the Nine Transformations of Thunder, because the difference between his realm and Xuan Qingzhu's was simply too great! That Xuan Qingzhu might already be a Divine Martial Realm expert.However, even the Heavenly Thunder Martial King himself was unable to complete this Nine Transformations of Thunder. If he went to practice it himself, would he end up with the same fate as the Heavenly Thunder Martial King?After thinking for a long time, Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and put away the lightning talisman. The Martial King is a Heavenly Grade Lightning Vein, and I am a Divine Grade Lightning Vein! If he can't, maybe I can!Moreover, to practice the Nine Transformations of Thunder, the minimum requirement was to start from the Xiantian Stage, so he still had some time to think about it.The only regret was that the Nine Transformations of Thunder was just a cultivation technique, and it did not contain any specific martial skill moves.When Xiang Nan handed the storage ring to Xiang Zhanxiong, Xiang Zhanxiong was stunned. \"This is an Intermediate Storage Ring! It's even better than the Basic Storage Ring I wore myself.\"Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Grandpa, open it and see what's inside.\"Xiang Zhanxiong opened his storage ring, and large amounts of gold coins and spirit herb pills poured out.At this moment, Xiang Zhanxiong was truly dumbfounded. After a while, he shouted, \"Heaven help my Xiang Clan!\"Xiang Nan replied, \"Grandpa Li and I used to go to Black Wind Mountain to pick mushrooms and catch some game to eat. We accidentally found a stone door.\"\"I missed Grandpa Li last night and went there again. I didn't expect that the stone door would be opened. I took out all the things inside.\"Xiang Zhanxiong's eyes turned red. Each of these techniques was even more advanced than the Xiang Clan's.\"Grandpa, I also found something in the cave that might be beneficial to your cultivation.\" Xiang Nan took out a small book, about seven or eight pages thick.Xiang Zhanxiong opened his eyes and said, \"This is the way to break through the bottleneck of the Heavenly Yuan Realm!\"Of course, this book was written by Xiang Nan himself. The spirit herbs and pills needed to break through the bottleneck were all in his grandfather's storage ring.At this time, Xiang Zhanxiong was so excited that he was speechless that he ignored Xiang Nan for a long time.Xiang Nan smiled and whispered, \"Grandfather, you should slowly study it yourself. Grandson, please leave.\"After leaving the secret room, it was already dawn. Xiang Nan immediately set off for Bluestone City and the City Lord's Mansion!When Xiang Nan arrived at the City Lord's Mansion, the entire mansion was filled with banquets and lanterns. All the people from the various clans in the towns were here.Xiang Nan took a deep breath and shouted, \"Xiang Clan, Xiang Nan! Come to the banquet!\"With this voice, all the guests in the hall stopped and looked at Xiang Nan.\"It's you little bastard!\" Instantly, a furious curse rang out in the reception hall. Three elders of the Wang Clan had already rushed out.These three people were all experts of the Origin Realm. All three of them were at the seventh level of the Origin Realm. One of them was named Wang Rongsheng. He was Wang Zonglin's distant uncle.\"Little bastard, how dare you come here to die!\" Wang Rongsheng's expression was not good.The surrounding guests whispered.\"Look, that's Xiang Zhanxiong's grandson, right? Why is he here?\"\"Sigh, the Xiang Clan has long since fallen into ruin. Isn't Zhan Xiong's grandson coming to the City Lord's Mansion to humiliate himself? Why bother?\"\"Heh, this brat must think that he is still some rich young master, shamelessly attending the wedding banquet.\"Everyone had different expressions. Some were watching the show, some were mocking, some were sympathetic, and some were pitiful.\"What!?\" Xiang Nan shouted loudly, \"I, Xiang Nan, have come to offer a gift to the City Lord. Is this the way the City Lord treats guests?\"In the reception hall, a tall and sturdy figure strode over.The city lord was over two meters tall. The moment he stood at the entrance of the reception hall, he gave off tremendous pressure. Moreover, this person was at the third level of the Heavenly Yuan Realm. He could be said to be the number one expert in the entire Blue Stone City.\"Xiang Nan.\" The city lord's expression was a little complicated as he said, \"Why \u2026 did you come here?\"Liked it?

I want to tear him into pieces!\" Wang Rong's eyes burned with anger.However, Xiang Nan didn't even look at Wang Rongsheng, as if Wang Rongsheng was a mad dog barking alone.\"City Lord.\" Xiang Nan took out a scroll and opened it on the spot.This is a painting of ink and pill. The scenery, fish and insect on it, the beautiful green forest, can be said to be a masterpiece.It was normal for people to be arrogant and elegant, especially those who could come to the City Lord's Mansion. All of them were either rich or expensive. Everyone had great eyesight and immediately caused an uproar.\"I didn't expect Zhan Xiong to still have such a good thing.\" The City Lord took the painting and his expression softened slightly.\"Xiang Nan, your grandfather and I are good friends. Leave now. I can help you stop the Wang Clan.\" Whispered the City Lord in Xiang Nan's ear.Xiang Nan smiled instead, \"I haven't finished my work yet, so I'm not in a hurry to leave.\"\"City Lord!\" Wang Rongsheng was furious, \"He killed my nephew and was so arrogant. I must kill him today!\"The city lord waved his hand and interrupted Wang Rongsheng. He frowned at Xiang Nan and said, \"Why are you such an ignorant child? You've caused a great disaster, but you don't know how to advance or retreat!\"The guests all shook their heads as they looked at Xiang Nan. They thought to themselves, \"This kid is spoiled. Can't you even tell that the City Lord is helping you?\"However, the expression on Xiang Nan's face subsided slightly as he said in a deep voice, \"A great calamity? Lord City Lord, let me ask you.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan pointed in the direction of the Wang Clan and said, \"His Wang Clan caused the destruction of our the Xiang manor ! Use a red ring to trap the Xiang manor like a livestock. Whoever stepped out of the red line will be killed without mercy!\"\"What? His Wang Clan just bullied us? You and everyone else watched coldly. My Xiang Clan only killed one person from his Wang Clan, yet it's considered to have caused a great calamity?\"\"This\" The City Lord was speechless after being asked by Xiang Nan, his face filled with shame.The surrounding guests also shut their mouths.\"Are you here to reason?\" Suddenly, a voice came from inside the reception hall, followed by a person slowly stepping out.This person was wearing a loose snow-white robe. He was the current head of the Wang Clan, an expert at the first level of the Heavenly Yuan Realm, Wang Changhe!Wang Changhe put his hands behind his back and said in a condescending manner, \"The world of martial arts is originally like this. Reason doesn't work. It depends on who is strong.\"Xiang Nan nodded, \"Everything depends on strength, right? Remember what you said.\"Xiang Nan turned his head to look at the City Lord. \"I will register for the Martial Arts Town Election two days later. Will I be able to obtain protection during this period?\"The City Lord's eyes lit up and he said, \"That's right.\"\"But \u2026\" The City Lord hesitated for a moment and said, \"The registration ended two days ago. Now \u2026\"\"It doesn't matter.\" Wang Changhe interrupted again and said, \"Didn't he want to participate in the martial arts town election? I will recommend him to participate.\"\"But there is one condition, Xiang Nan, do you dare to accept it?\"Xiang Nan laughed loudly, \"Patriarch Wang, just say it.\"Wang Changhe nodded, \"You have already violated the rules of the town election by asking to participate. However, as long as you sign the life and death treaty, I will personally recommend you.\"\"Life and Death Treaty?\" Everyone exploded.Killing was not allowed in the tournament of Martial Town. But a life and death treaty would be different.In other words, others could kill Xiang Nan, but Xiang Nan could not.At this moment, the clans of the other towns under Blue Stone City were also watching the show, and there were also people who started to heckle.Xiang Nan agreed without hesitation.The City Lord is so angry. He thinks that your future life is too ungrateful. Can't you see that they are trying to kill you on an excuse? You actually agreed.\"I hope you\" The City Lord patted Xiang Nan on the shoulder and sighed, \"I hope you can show some outstanding skills.\"\"Come on, the City Defense Corps, listen to the order and escort Xiang Nan back to the manor. Stay in the manor until the town election is over!\"Wang Changhe sneered and \"watched\" Xiang Nan leave.Everyone in the streets and alleys was watching the show. Who were all the youths protected by the city guards?Xiang Nan did a good job. He went to the City Lord's Mansion alone and even dragged the City Defense Army over.In the past two days, Xiang Nan did not leave the house. He used a large wooden bucket to crush the spiritual herbs he needed into powder and pour them into clean water.As for himself, he was immersed in that bucket of potions and meditated cross-legged, absorbing the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, continuously raising his cultivation level.Each of these herbs was of exceptional quality, so expensive that it made one's flesh hurt. However, Xiang Nan didn't care about it and put a lot of them into the water.With his tyrannical divine talent, he crazily advanced to the ninth level of Body Tempering within a day!The cultivation method he used was still the cultivation method of the Rushing Lightning Spear. Before he could find a new Lightning Meridian cultivation method, he could only make do with it.\"After the town selection is complete, I have to go to the largest auction house in Blue Stone City. Perhaps I can find something related to the Lightning Meridian Technique there.\"On the morning of the third day, today was the day of the Martial Town Election, and Xiang Nan finally opened his eyes abruptly.At that moment, the Spiritual Qi in the world suddenly increased in speed and frantically entered Xiang Nan's body. Only a faint muffled sound could be heard from his dantian.Advanced!Xiantian realm, first level!Xiang Nan slightly raised his right hand, and a translucent ball of gas slowly rotated in his palm. This was the first day!With the blessing of the previous weather, his basic strength instantly became 2,100 jin!\"Time to go.\" Xiang Nan cleaned his body briefly, swallowed another Grade One Marrow Cleansing Pill, and pushed the door open.This precious Marrow Cleansing Pill was able to consolidate Xiang Nan's body, which had just been raised to a higher realm, and immediately stabilize his unstable realm, making him look like an experienced Xiantian realm expert.Xiang Nan's parents came from a large family and knew a lot about it. They knew that they couldn't go to the town elections, otherwise they would draw a lot of unnecessary hatred towards Xiang Nan.On the day Xiang Nan participated in the town elections, the Xiang family held a funeral for Li Zhong.This time, the martial arts town selection was held at the same time in every town in Blue Stone City. Each town was held separately, and outstanding martial arts talents were selected.The town election is limited to sixteen to eighteen years of age.After the Martial Arts Town Selection is over, it will be the time for the various sects to pick people. They will be called the Martial Arts City Selection. At that time, all the outstanding people in the town will participate together.Moreover, the restriction would be relaxed to between the ages of 16 and 20, and outstanding martial arts youths would be selected by various sects.There were six families in Bluestone Town participating in the town elections. Among them, the Wang Family, Li Family, and Mo Family of the three great families were enemies of the Xiang Family.An empty arena was placed in the middle of the arena, and the spectators of the Bluestone Town had already occupied their seats.At this time, a person suddenly slammed into Xiang Nan's shoulder fiercely. Turning around, he saw that it was the Wang family.\"Little bastard, you really dare to come.\" A Wang Clan disciple coldly said to Xiang Nan, \"I'll personally kill you later!\"Immediately after, another group of people entered the arena. This time, they were from the Mo Clan. The people in front of the Mo Clan laughed strangely and made a gesture of beheading Xiang Nan.After that, the Li Clan's people also came. They patted Xiang Nan on the shoulder and whispered, \"Xiang Nan, don't worry, I won't let the Wang Clan succeed.\"\"Because \u2026 before they do, I will kill you in advance!\"The people of the three families and each team welcomed the cheers of the spectators.After all the clans entered, Xiang Nan finally entered the arena without any hesitation.When he entered the arena, the whole arena was booed.These people were trying to curry favor with the three great clans.Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Three great clans? Haha \u2026\"\"What you said to me just now? How did you say it? How did you swallow it!\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a martial arts expert from the City Lord's Mansion as the chief referee, and four deputy referees were in charge of observing the four corners of the arena.The referee announced loudly, \"There are a total of 320 participants in the Bluestone Town Martial Arts Town Election.\"\"The first round is the arena competition. Each of the two contestants is a group. Draw lots to determine the group. There are a total of 160 groups. Let's compete on the arena.\"\"In the end, the top 40 contestants will automatically advance and participate in the Martial Arts City Selection in a month's time.\"Afterwards, the referee announced that 320 contestants had come forward to draw lots.When Xiang Nan went to draw lots, there were quite a few people in the audience who flattered the Wang Clan and angrily scolded Xiang Nan, doing their utmost to insult him.Xiang Nan turned his head, looked at the shouts and handed the number token in his hand to the referee.The referee nodded and wrote Xiang Nan's name on the stone slab behind him, marking \"sixteen\" behind him.On behalf of Xiang Nan, he was the 16th contestant.In the end, a youth named \"Zhang Chuang\" was also selected as \"sixteen\".Seeing this result, everyone in the audience booed. They felt very regretful that Xiang Nan had not been able to draw with the Wang Clan.The referee spoke and began to announce the specific rules.The duration of each group's final battle shall not exceed five minutes, and the opponent shall not be killed.\"Alright, let's invite the first group of contestants to the stage.\" The referee raised his right hand.At this time, two contestants walked up to the arena. One of them was named Liu Kai, and the other was Wang Jinghai from the Wang Clan.Wang Jinghai was only sixteen years old, but he was already at the fourth level of the Xiantian realm! Liu Kai's strength was also extraordinary, and at the age of eighteen, he was at the Xiantian First Layer.\"My God, look, that's Wang Jinghai! He's one of the Wang Clan's young geniuses!\" The crowd immediately boiled.\"That's right. I heard that Wang Jinghai has a talent for earth veins of the Mortal Stage!\"The scene was in chaos, and after Liu Kai heard about the Earth Vein Talent of the Mortal Stage, his expression changed slightly.Earth veins represented the potential for defense.Wang Jinghai smiled faintly and leapt up into the arena. With just this move, he won the applause of the crowd.In the spectator stands and in the direction of the VIP seats, the Li Family Patriarch smiled and said, \"Changhe, Jinghai is a very good child. He is indeed a genius who possesses the affinity of the five elements, especially the affinity of the earth vein. It is truly rare.\"Wang Changhe cupped his fists and saluted, \"Brother Li, you're too polite. Your Li Clan's youths are also extraordinary heroes.\"\"Haha.\" The two Patriarchs looked at each other and smiled, both feeling extremely proud.\"Now I declare!\" The referee raised his right hand and quickly sliced down his palm, \"Begin!\"On the arena, Wang Jinghai and Liu Kai stood opposite each other. Wang Jinghai waved to Liu Kai, \"Come, let me give you three moves.\"Liu Kai's face was filled with anger as he rushed towards Wang Jinghai, \"You underestimated me too much!\"Wang Jinghai shook his head in disdain and turned to look in the direction of Xiang Nan.Furthermore, under the gazes of the crowd, he made a gesture of beheading Xiang Nan.\"Where are you looking!\" Liu Kai leapt into the air and swept his fierce right whip leg towards the back of Wang Jinghai's neck.This whip leg even brought with it the whistling sound of the wind. It could be said to be extremely powerful!On the other side, Xiang Nan didn't dodge Wang Jinghai's fiery and murderous gaze and just looked at Wang Jinghai indifferently.Suddenly, with a muffled sound, Liu Kai's leg ruthlessly swept across the back of Wang Jinghai's neck.But in the end! The next scene shocked everyone.Wang Jinghai was hit by the whip leg and only took half a step sideways. He then turned around to look at Liu Kai and shrugged his shoulders, \"Is that all?\"Liu Kai's expression changed drastically.\"Come, there are still two more moves.\" Wang Jinghai smiled and waved at Liu Kai.This time, even the young geniuses of the Mo Clan and the Li Clan had serious expressions on their faces.\"Jinghai, this brat\" Mo Qi of the Mo Clan frowned. \"He hasn't fought with him for half a year. His defense is already so abnormal.\"Looking at the arena, Liu Kai took a deep breath. He took three steps back and began to condense his Yuan Qi.A faint glow wrapped around Liu Kai's entire right arm.\"Oh? The weather first.\" Wang Jinghai smiled faintly, \"Come on, you use the weather to attack, and I use the weather to defend.\"After saying that, Wang Jinghai straightened his chest, and a layer of pre-weather that was much denser than Liu Kai attached itself to his body.After Liu Kai finished gathering, he sprinted forward and threw a heavy punch at Wang Jinghai.Wang Jinghai's Xiantian was instantly moved to his forehead, and his head was actually pushed forward!Liu Kai's fists collided heavily with Wang Jinghai's forehead.Peng's muffled sound was followed by a cracking sound!Liu Kai was actually knocked backwards by Wang Jinghai's fist, and his arm bone was broken!\"Hiss\" The scene was filled with gasps of cold air.\"I\u2026 I admit defeat!\" Liu Kai clutched his broken arm, his face ashen with pain, large drops of cold sweat.After the atmosphere froze for a moment, the crowd immediately cheered and shook the heavens!Wang Jinghai defeated Liu Kai without a single move! What heaven-defying strength was this?\"I haven't even finished three moves.\" Wang Jinghai shook his forehead in disdain. Without looking at Liu Kai, he turned back to look at Xiang Nan and said, \"Xiang Nan, you'd better pray that you don't meet me.\"\"The first winner, Wang Jinghai!\" The referee announced on the spot, and then said, \"The next match will be played by both sides.\"In the next eleven matches, there weren't too many bright spots. Even though a few youths from the three great clans had appeared on the stage, they quickly defeated their opponents.But no one else showed Wang Jinghai's overwhelming advantage.Until the twelfth match, Xiantian Fourth Layer expert Mo Qi appeared!The auditorium was boiling again.\"It's the Mo Clan's Mo Qi! He, Wang Jinghai of the Wang Clan, and Li Lingfeng of the Li Clan are known as the three heroes!\"\"That's right, he really is a young hero. I heard that he also possesses the affinity of the Five Elements. He seems to be \u2026 a Mortal Grade Fire Vein!\"What was even more remarkable was that Mo Qi's opponent was a Li Clan's Li Yuntian. He was eighteen years old and was at the Xiantian Third Layer. The battle between the two of them was very interesting.Mo Qi pulled out a snow-white longsword from behind him. He poured the weather into the sword and saw that there was a dazed air current on the sword.\"It's indeed a fire vein!\" Wang Changhe nodded and said, \"This kind of flame affinity is too rare. It is worthy of being as famous as my Jinghai.\"The airflow around the sword was caused by the temperature! Anyone who looked at it would feel terrified.Li Yuntian's expression was incomparably grave. He drew out his saber and poured the weather into it. He rushed towards Mo Qi.Every time the two weapons collided, Li Yuntian was knocked back a few steps. His face turned green and red, and he felt extremely uncomfortable. Finally, he was knocked out of the arena in the eighth move.Mo Qi casually carried his sword behind him and raised his head calmly.The two of them were only one level away! Especially since Li Yuntian was a genius from one of the three great clans!Mo Qi used this crushing strength to defeat Li Yuntian, who was two years older, and his shocking power was not inferior to Wang Jinghai's.Liked it?

This was the kind of thrilling, hot-blooded competition everyone wanted!These spectators didn't care about human lives at all. They even hoped that the two sides would fight to the death.A youth's death arena represented a sad end to his short life, but to the audience, it was just a good performance, a conversation after tea.The indifference in the hearts of the people had already reached this level.What was even more exaggerated was that a large number of spectators had voluntarily set up a gamble! Moreover, it was a gamble specifically aimed at Xiang Nan.The bet was when Xiang Nan would die! How many battles did he die in! Moreover, the odds were astonishingly low. The number of spectators betting on Xiang Nan's victory was zero!There were a total of 20,000 spectators at the town election. Everyone bet, but none of them voted for Xiang Nan to leave the town election alive.\"Xiang Nan!\" A spectator stood up and shouted at Xiang Nan, \"I bet half of my worth on you! You must die in the first match!\"\"If you die in the second match, I will lose a lot of money!\"Another spectator stood up and laughed, \"I will only die if I suppress you in the second match. Xiang Nan, even if you are beaten like a dead dog, you must climb out of the arena. Don't die in the first match!\"Zhang Chuang smiled and said, \"Xiang Nan, you should just admit defeat. I don't want to offend the Wang Clan by killing you. I just need you to kneel down and call me Grandpa and I'll let you go.\"\"Oh right, I heard that your grandfather is a cripple. I presume that you are also a cripple. Why bother to humiliate yourself?\"The reality was such an irony. In the past, the Xiang Clan was a clan where many people were kneeling and crawling to curry favor. Now, the trees were scattered and the walls were pushed down by the crowd.Xiang Nan smiled faintly. He took out his spear and said, \"Leave this to you.\"\"I really don't know what's good for me.\" Zhang Chuang shook his head and rushed towards Xiang Nan with his sword in hand, \"Grandpa, I gave you a chance, but you gave me no face! No wonder I was ruthless!\"The moment Zhang Chuang rushed forward, the entire audience held their breaths, feeling extremely nervous.The youngsters from the Wang Clan, Mo Clan, Li Clan, and the three great clans also frowned. They didn't want Xiang Nan to die at the hands of anyone else.\"Try this move of mine, Moon Setting Slash!\" Zhang Chuang shouted as he drew a large arc on the sword in his hand and slashed towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan raised his hand and shot! This spear actually sent Zhang Chuang flying with his sword!Zhang Chuangpu coughed out a mouthful of blood, and his entire body flew off like a flying spin, falling out of the arena in a spiral shape!The entire arena was completely silentOne move!Everyone was stunned. They couldn't even find an adjective to describe their shock at this moment.Xiang Nan walked to the edge of the arena alone and said to Zhang Chuang, who was lying half dead on the ground, \"Who did you call trash just now? Sorry, I didn't hear you clearly.\"Zhang Chuang's throat rumbled a few times, but he didn't say a word. Blood flowed out of his mouth.The young experts of the three great clans looked at each other, but they did not react after a long time.The next match was still very long. Xiang Nan simply sat cross-legged and began to taste his thunder vein talent.According to Xiang Nan's own actual exploration, if he activated his Lightning Meridian Innate, his strength would instantly triple to a terrifying level! That was 6,300 jin! This is the current limit.Of course, the price of doing so is also very high, and that is to burn a large number of pre-weather.Therefore, when fighting, you should try to minimize unnecessary consumption and avoid overloading your Lightning Meridian stats.Xiang Nan didn't even watch a single match in the next arena match, so he didn't care.However, it was worth mentioning that the Li Clan had produced a genius, Li Lingfeng! This person did not have the affinity of the Five Elements, but his talent was spiritual!Mortal, Spirit, Earth, Heaven! With four levels of talent, the higher the level, the greater the potential of a martial artist.Although Li Lingfeng did not possess the affinity of the Five Elements, just his talent in the Mortal Stage had already caused everyone to go crazy with envy.As expected, Li Lingfeng, a 16-year-old Xiantian 4-dan expert, defeated his opponent by an overwhelming margin.After a total of 160 groups of matches were played, it was already late. All the contestants rested for one night and continued the next day.Of the 320 people, 160 were eliminated, leaving 116.The next day, the competition continued. One hundred and sixty contestants drew lots for the second round.Xiang Nan also picked an insignificant figure and won, while the other contestants' matches were no longer fresh.One hundred and sixty people, eighty eliminated, leaving eighty people. Among them, Xiang Nan won and advanced.That afternoon, the third round of elimination began and ended successfully. Forty people were eliminated, leaving 40 people. Xiang Nan still advanced.These forty people were definitely eligible to enter the city.However, it was worth mentioning that in all three matches, Xiang Nan had defeated his enemies in one move! Moreover, he had never really used the spear in his hand.This gave the audience a huge amount of expectation! Was Xiang Nan lucky or was his strength heaven-defying?Obviously, after the three matches, Xiang Nan had caused all the spectators to lose all their money, and the biggest winner was the City Lord.But in the end, the next stage of the competition truly ignited the enthusiasm of all the spectators.This was because this stage of the competition was a competition for the top forty spots! Moreover, the rules of the competition were extremely exaggerated!The referee stood on the arena and raised a finger. \"At this stage, the top 40 contestants are going to have a wheel battle!\"The cheers of the spectators were deafening when they heard the words \"Chariot Battle\".The referee waited for a long time. After the cheers, he continued, \"Let the audience vote for a contestant. The first one to stand on the arena!\"\"Then, let the other contestants take the initiative to challenge him! If the first contestant wins, then stay on the arena and continue to meet other contestants' challenges until he loses, or until he wins completely!\"This was another big bomb! The audience cheered and roared, the veins on their necks bulging.This kind of rule was clearly eye-catching! And it was aimed at Xiang Nan! Because even with his toes, he could imagine who the audience would vote for first!It was also because of this rule that the gambling game was opened again! Similarly, none of the spectators placed a bet on Xiang Nan, because Xiang Nan could not leave alive!Xiang Nan's support rate was still \u2026 zero!Those spectators who had lost money earlier would not hesitate to bet more chips on Xiang Nan's death!\"Alright.\" The referee clapped his hands and said, \"Voting begins.\"The results came out.Of the 23,000 spectators present, 22,940 voted for Xiang Nan! Only sixty people voted for someone else.After the referee announced the result of the election, the atmosphere at the scene instantly exploded!Liked it?

You'd better die more quickly!\"\"Xiang Nan, I bet all my money on you. You must die!\"Xiang Nan looked at the judge and said, \"Your City Lord's Mansion is a dealer. I want to ask, if I bet on myself, what is the odds?\"The referee said, \"Let's put it this way. Our casino is different from the casino. But if you vote for yourself and you win, then you can take all 3.1 million!\"\"Alright!\" Xiang Nan casually tossed out a gold coin and was caught by the referee.The referee nodded, \"According to the rules, if you bet a gold coin, you will win!\"The curses from the crowd shook the heavens, while Xiang Nan maintained a faint smile.In the shadows, the City Lord quietly observed Xiang Nan and nodded his head in praise, \"No matter how strong Xiang Nan is in battle, just his unchanging calmness against ten thousand people is worth admiring.\"\"Alright!\" At the edge of the arena, the referee clapped his hands to silence everyone and said, \"Next, the Chariot War is about to begin.\"\"I have a request.\" Xiang Nan raised a finger and said, \"Give me a jar of wine.\"\"Sure.\" The referee immediately ordered someone to carry a jar of wine and some bowls to the arena.Xiang Nan slapped open the wine jar's sealing mud and drank it all in one gulp, \"Happy!\"\"I'll do it!\" Someone below the stage raised his hand angrily and a Xiantian First Stage martial artist jumped onto the stage.The other experts all hugged their shoulders and watched. The stronger the person, the more they wanted to step back to show that they were extraordinary.The contestant flipped onto the stage and said, \"My name is \u2026\"Xiang Nan shook his head. \"Cut the crap and do it.\"The contestant was instantly enraged. He held the sword in his right hand and injected the weather into the sword, causing the sword to begin to tremble slightly.\"Sure enough, it's different from the previous arena competition. The contestants are very strong.\" Xiang Nan smiled and took a step forward. Lightning energy surged in his dantian!The first thing he did was to inject a spear into the sky and sweep it out, sending the contestant flying out of the arena with a loud boom!One move to subdue the enemy!\"It's still one move\" An audience exclaimed.The referee was a little unable to react. After a moment of shock, he said, \"Xiang Nan wins.\"Xiang Nan poured himself a bowl of wine and drank it all in one gulp, smashing the bowl onto the arena!\"I'll do it!\" Another contestant jumped onto the arena. This person was also at the Xiantian First Layer.This person wanted to introduce himself, but when he saw Xiang Nan walking towards him with big strides, he closed his mouth and ran towards Xiang Nan.The moment he was about to attack, Xiang Nan attacked even faster!Before the contestant could lift his right hand, he felt the cold spear tip pressing against his throat.Xiang Nan said indifferently, \"You're already dead.\"With that, he turned the spear around and sent the opponent flying with a loud bang. It was still a single move to suppress the enemy!Faced with the hostility of the audience, Xiang Nan took a bowl of wine and wiped his mouth, \"Good wine! So good!\"\"I'll do it!\" Another contestant stepped onto the stage. Because of his previous experience, this contestant no longer introduced himself and directly attacked Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan, a frightening dragon, went out to sea. First, the weather was mixed with a powerful lightning-attributed martial skill, and with a single shot, he knocked the enemy over!Under the dumbfounded expressions of countless spectators, Xiang Nan drank another large bowl of wine, \"Not enough to see! Something really capable!\"\"Jinghai, are you coming on? This kid's strength is beyond our expectations.\" A young man from the Wang Clan asked in a low voice.Wang Jinghai's expression was serious as he said, \"This kid's progress is exaggerated. But since he has already reached this stage, I'm not in a hurry to step onto the stage. Mo Qi and the others haven't moved yet. Let's watch from the sidelines.\"Then, the fourth, fifth, eighth, tenth, and fifteenth contestants all came on stage, all of them defeated by Xiang Nan's attack!At this moment, there was not a single sound in the colosseum.The audience could not even cry, let alone laugh.\"This guy \u2026 is he really going to fight thirty-nine of them? Oh my God, I'm not dreaming, am I?\"Previously, the audience had hoped that Xiang Nan would die, but Xiang Nan was using one person and one gun to frantically turn the situation around in the town election. This scene was completely unexpected.When the twentieth challenger arrived, the spectators finally rekindled their hopes.The last 19 people were all young experts from the three great clans! They're finally on stage.\"Wang Jingtian, eighteen years old, Xiantian 2nd layer,\" said a handsome man as he stepped onto the stage with a long saber in his hand.Seeing this person, Xiang Nan laughed loudly, \"Good job! I'm waiting for the people from your three great clans!\"Wang Jingtian shouted and rushed towards Xiang Nan, \"Let me see what you can do!\"Wang Jingtian chopped down with a half moon slash!This saber strike brought with it a fierce weather, like a crescent moon descending from the sky! Its lethality soared to 2,700 jin!Xiang Nan did not use any tricks. The most straightforward revenge was undoubtedly to use violence to counter violence!The thunder energy within Xiang Nan's body roared, and the weather quickly rose. A spear swung out, carrying a strength of 3,000 jin!Boom!The arena was trembling. Wang Jingtian didn't even let out a miserable scream and fainted when he flew backwards.\"Weak!\" Looking at Wang Jingtian flying out of the arena, Xiang Nan drank a large bowl of wine.\"I'll do it!\" The Mo Clan jumped onto the arena and said, \"Eighteen-year-old Xiantian 2nd layer martial artist, Mo Hongying!\"Mo Hongying's body moved like a leopard, bringing with it strong winds. He pulled out three sword flowers from his sword and roared, \"A hundred flowers dazzle!\"Every single sword flower was a bunch of weather before it was released! Sword Qi could not be measured purely by strength, because it was extremely sharp!Xiang Nan waved his spear with one hand! The spear was like a dragon!A fan-shaped spear Qi shot out, instantly shattering Mo Hongying's three sword flowers. Following that, the spear body was very close, and the spear tip pierced through Mo Hongying's left leg, blasting him out of the arena!\"Too weak!\" Xiang Nan drank a large bowl of wine and looked around, \"Who else?\"At this moment, the entire arena was so quiet that the needles could be heard. Everyone was stunned.Xiang Nan held a spear in his hand and pointed it at the sky. \"How did you humiliate my Xiang Clan back then? Today, I want to return them to you one by one!\" He shouted.\"What an arrogant and domineering little bastard!\" A person from the Li Clan rushed out. This person quickly ran under the arena and suddenly jumped five meters away from the arena!\"Slash the Wind!\" The young man from the Li Clan roared in a low voice, his sword coming from the sky!This sword brought along two strong winds, which formed a whirlpool and smashed towards Xiang Nan with great might.The audience immediately clenched their fists in excitement, \"It's the Li Clan's cultivation technique, Wind Severing!\"This person was a Xiantian 3rd layer expert, far surpassing the previous Xiantian expert!Xiang Nan's waist was straight and he laughed loudly. So what if he was at the Xiantian 3rd layer?This time, Xiang Nan charged forward like a fierce dragon! He wrapped the gun's body around the stronger weather, and the gun's body even started to tremble slightly.The weather continued to soar, 4,000 kilograms of strength! The basic strength was tripled from the terrifying Lightning Vein attribute!Boom!The Li Clan expert even had his sword shattered by Xiang Nan! A piece of broken sword fragment floated in the sky, but the bones of the Li Family's entire body were broken and they fainted under the stage.\"Isn't there anyone who can fight!\" Xiang Nan drew his gun and stood upright, proudly sweeping his gaze across the entire arena.The entire arena was completely silent.The following battles became fiercer and fiercer. The challengers grew stronger and stronger, but Xiang Nan crushed the entire arena with unimaginable strength!The entire town election seemed to have become a stage for Xiang Nan alone! After knocking over one person, he drank a bowl of wine!\"Weak!\" \"Weak!\" \"Too weak!\" \"Too weak to see!\"Everyone present was filled with Xiang Nan's voice. Those weak words caused the faces of the three great clans to be disgraced!The young masters that the three great clans had cultivated with all their effort were actually so weak against this destitute disciple of Xiang Nan's.At this moment, the faces of the three masters were ashen, as ugly as if they had eaten a dead mouse.Xiang Nan, on the other hand, grew more and more courageous. He didn't even rest for a minute, defeating thirty-six powerful enemies in a row.In the end, only Wang Jinghai, Mo Qi, and Li Lingfeng were left.The three of them exchanged a glance and saw that Wang Jinghai's expression was extremely ugly. He said in a deep voice, \"It seems that only the three of us can punish him.\"Mo Qi rubbed his wrist and said, \"Let him see the heavens and the earth. Otherwise, it would be annoying for him to continue being so arrogant.\"Li Lingfeng laughed loudly, \"I thought this town election would be very boring. I never thought that someone from the Xiang Clan would be able to let us stretch our muscles and bones. I didn't expect that, but that's good. The three of us don't have to hide our strength anymore.\"Xiang Nan hugged the wine jar and poured a few mouthfuls of liquor into his mouth. Then, he smashed the jar onto the arena and laughed loudly, \"You bullied my Xiang Clan!\"\"Today, I will turn around and bully all of you by myself!\"\"What three heroes, what three great experts, let's go together!\"Liked it?

He wants to fight three times?\"\"Haha, I actually bought it right! I bought him the last time he died. This time, he made a big profit!\"The audience boiled over.Xiang Nan proposed to fight three of them one at a time. This was a situation that had never occurred in the previous year's Town Election Arena Tournament.Someone asked, but someone in the audience shouted, \"One versus three? Is that in line with the rules of the game?\"After some thought, the referee nodded and said, \"Since Xiang Nan is the one who accepts the challenge, as long as Xiang Nan is willing, it will not be against the rules.\"This could be considered a loophole in the rules. No one thought that the challenged would be willing to fight alone against everyone. Therefore, there was no specific provision for such a situation. Since there was no specific provision, it was not a violation of the rules.Wang Jinghai, Mo Qi, and Li Lingfeng exchanged glances with each other, their expressions extremely ugly.\"You're too arrogant.\" Wang Jinghai's face was gloomy as he took the lead in jumping onto the arena.It seemed that the three great masters had their own pride, and it was impossible for them to accept one versus three.As Wang Jinghai spoke, he took out a set of thick black armor from his low-grade storage ring and began to slowly wear it.\"That's!\" Mo Qi frowned and said, \"Black Kui Battle Armor, high-grade Spirit grade protective equipment!\"The audience clamored. Protectors were also considered weapons, sharing the same level algorithm.The lowest grade was Mortal Grade, and then Spirit Grade. Weapons and protective equipment of Spirit Grade all had the ability to enhance the weather first.Li Lingfeng nodded silently, \"Looks like Wang Jinghai took out all the treasures of the housekeeper.\"Xiang Nan did not expect that Wang Jinghai would use such a powerful defensive armor. He silently calculated in his heart that high-grade spirit-grade protective equipment could resist at least 3,500 jin of attack power!As for the spirit armor, it could be enhanced by the first weather. After Wang Jinghai's own first weather enhanced the Black Kui armor, he should be able to withstand a maximum of 4,200 jin of attack power. This was only the defensive power of the armor itself!This terrifying defensive power was simply a nightmare for a Xiantian realm martial artist! Even a Xiantian ninth layer martial artist would only have a strength of 2,900 jin.\"Previously, I had always used one move to defeat the enemy. I wasted one-third of my time on the weather first, and the last two-thirds needed to be used properly.\"Xiang Nan's expression was solemn. His Lightning Meridian talent allowed him to erupt at most three times his strength, or 6,300 jin. However, this eruption was extremely terrifying to the previous weather.Two-thirds of the initial weather was barely enough to erupt three times! After three times, he would immediately fall into a weak state.This was also one of the reasons why Xiang Nan wanted to fight three enemies at once. He wanted to use his strongest explosion period to deal with three enemies at once.It seems impossible now.Wang Jinghai was already dressed in battle armor. After the referee announced the start of the match, he rushed towards Xiang Nan.This Black Kui Battle Armor was too thick. It slowed down a portion of Wang Jinghai's flexibility.Xiang Nan first tentatively exploded with twice his strength, and with a strength of 4200 jin, he shot Wang Jinghai in the chest.With a loud bang from Peng, Wang Jinghai was sent flying backwards and landed on the edge of the arena!Hiss!The entire arena was gasping for breath.\"You actually have such powerful strength?\" Wang Jinghai stood up in disbelief.The 4200 jin attack power was the critical point of the Black Kui Battle Armor's defense, so Wang Jinghai didn't suffer any damage.Xiang Nan furrowed his brows and looked down at the gun in his hand. He thought to himself, \"Indeed.\"Numerous cracks had already appeared on the spear's tip, and with a loud crash, the entire spear tip was scattered into pieces on the ground.\"Hahaha!\" Wang Jinghai laughed loudly, \"Your tattered mortal-grade spear also wants to fight against my high-grade spiritual-grade protective gear?\"Xiang Nan's Mortal grade spear was simply unable to withstand such a powerful attack and was still shattered.\"It's my turn.\" Wang Jinghai suddenly leapt up. The terrifying surface of the Black Kui Battle Armor howled before the weather. His entire body was like a giant boulder falling from the sky, fiercely smashing down towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan immediately poured the weather into his legs and dodged, while Wang Jinghai smashed into the arena where Xiang Nan was just a moment ago.There was a loud boom, and the entire arena was cracked open by Wang Jinghai!\"Too scary\" The audience exclaimed.That arena was made of earth crystal stones! It was actually able to be blasted open by Wang Jinghai's attack!Wang Jinghai became even more arrogant as he roared as he charged towards Xiang Nan, \"You don't have any weapons, how can you resist me?\"Xiang Nan frowned, but a cold light flashed in his eyes, \"Without weapons, you can't be crippled?\"Before he could finish speaking, Xiang Nan's voice flickered rapidly. After drawing a large arc, he not only dodged Wang Jinghai's attack, but even arrived behind Wang Jinghai.In the next moment, Xiang Nan's hands pierced into Wang Jinghai's armor at the same time! Following that, the weather erupted, and his hands actually tore off Wang Jinghai's shoulders!\"What, you!\" Wang Jinghai was shocked.Clang!Xiang Nan threw two thick shoulder pads down the arena. He twisted his wrists and moved his body, ready for the next attack.Although the armor is extremely defensive, your Wang Jinghai's speed is not as fast as mine, Xiang Nan. Could it be that I can't rely on this advantage to remove your armor?A trace of fear appeared in Wang Jinghai's eyes. He hadn't expected Xiang Nan to have such strength with his bare hands. One had to know that the Black Kui Battle Armor had adherence! That was about the same as his own defense.In other words, unless Xiang Nan used more than 4,200 jin of strength, he would not be able to remove the Black Kui Battle Armor.The panicked Wang Jinghai didn't have time to think too much. He hurriedly launched a fierce charge towards Xiang Nan. The weather beneath his feet erupted, causing his entire body to rush out! His strength and speed had increased unprecedentedly.Xiang Nan once again circled Wang Jinghai's front at a faster speed. His body was like a flexible cheetah, and he suddenly climbed onto Wang Jinghai's back.At the same time, Xiang Nan's hands had already lifted the armor on Wang Jinghai's back.At this instant, a sharp first-day sky suddenly shot out from below the arena! The weather was like sword Qi, approaching Xiang Nan's head.This sudden change made it impossible for anyone to dodge, but Xiang Nan's perception was incomparably sensitive.In the blink of an eye, Xiang Nan decisively gave up on tearing Wang Jinghai apart and flicked his body backwards.The sword qi flew out close to the arena, and with a whoosh, a corner of the arena was cut off!The cut was as smooth as a mirror!Looking at the arena, there was already one more person. It was Mo Qi!\"You really can't wait any longer.\" Xiang Nan sneered and glanced at the sword in Mo Qi's hand.The sword in Mo Qi's hand was no longer the weapon he had used earlier, but had been temporarily replaced!The entire body of the sword was pale red, and without pouring in through the previous weather, it carried a faint temperature.Mo Qi pulled the sword into a sword flower and said, \"Scarlet Fire Sword, a high-grade spirit weapon.\"Everyone was in an uproar! Another high-grade spirit weapon!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was because the sword qi did not belong to the attack power, but to the sharp cutting power!At this moment, Wang Jinghai no longer cared about his dignity. He roared in a low voice, \"Mo Qi, I'll charge from the front, and you'll slay him from the side!\"After saying that, Wang Jinghai roared angrily. Relying on the strong weather, he rushed towards Xiang Nan and completely sealed off Xiang Nan's frontal line of defense.As for Mo Qi, he waited for an opportunity to attack. He swam beside Wang Jinghai. The Scarlet Flame Sword in his hand was already buzzing because of the abundance of the previous weather. The sharp sword qi was ready to deal a fatal blow at any moment.\"Good job!\" Xiang Nan's eyes erupted with a bright light!Although he couldn't lure Li Lingfeng out, it was still worth it to seriously injure the two of them!Xiang Nan did not have nowhere to hide as everyone had expected. Instead, he unexpectedly launched a counterattack against Wang Jinghai, who had the strongest defense!\"What?\" Mo Qi was shocked.Xiang Nan rushed out abruptly. He stabbed his legs into a sideways horse step and spread out his fingers. His entire right hand was wrapped in the weather and was ruthlessly stamped on the armor on Wang Jinghai's chest.In that instant, the Lightning Meridian talent suddenly exploded! The power of Xiang Nan's palm exploded to 6,300 jin!With a single palm strike, he heavily struck the high-grade spirit-grade battle armor!The terrifying power of the lightning vein had forcefully imprinted an inch deep palm print on the Black Kui Battle Armor's chest!A muffled boom rang out. The voice was deep and terrifying, causing Wang Jinghai's entire armor to instantly disintegrate! Thick pieces of armor scattered in all directions!The three masters stood up at the same time, their eyes wide open, as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight!The Black Kui Battle Armor was blasted apart by Xiang Nan!Wang Jinghai coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His internal organs were all shaken by a terrifying force. In that instant, he had already fainted.Swoosh! An incomparably sharp sword Qi cut through the cracks in the armor that scattered in all directions, and directly approached the southern gate of the Necklace.This time, Xiang Nan's explosion of strength had not yet completely ended. He did not dodge or dodge, and casually grabbed a piece of flying armor and placed it horizontally in front of him.Without Wang Jinghai's blessing, the armor was cut in half by Mo Qi's sword qi, but the sword qi was also cancelled out.Xiang Nan grabbed the armor plate with his left hand and placed it with his legs. He quickly rotated half a circle and threw the armor plate out with a buzzing sound, just about to hit Mo Qi's chest.At this moment, Li Lingfeng suddenly attacked. He rushed out of the arena with a heavy saber in his hand, but he came too quickly to release his saber Qi. He could only use his long saber to protect Mo Qi's chest.Mo Qi also drew out the Scarlet Fire Sword.At the same time, he was struck by the armor fragment that contained 6,000 jin of attack power.Clang!A deafening collision sounded. Mo Qi and Li Lingfeng were smashed to the point that they vomited blood. With their combined strength, they were knocked back more than ten steps and both retreated to the edge of the arena.Xiang Nan took advantage of the victory to chase after them and rushed towards the two of them with a slippery step.At this moment, a sound of air breaking suddenly sounded from outside the arena. A small object suddenly shot towards the arena. The target was Xiang Nan!Xiang Nan was caught off guard and hurriedly turned around, sweeping the bare barrel of the gun in the direction of the concealed weapon.The thing that flew over made Xiang Nan feel extremely threatening. It was with this spear that he exploded to the limit, pushing his strength to the peak of 6,300 jin!The barrel of the spear suddenly collided with that thing, and it actually shattered the spear barrel into pieces on the ground.As for Xiang Nan, because he was bombarded by a huge force, he quickly retreated. The blood in his body surged, and he almost spat out a mouthful of sweet blood. Fortunately, he suppressed it in time.\"Who ambushed me? How shameless!\" Xiang Nan cursed angrily.He had already seen clearly that the thing that flew over was actually just a grain of peanut!Moreover, that peanut was definitely not accompanied by the weather first, but by a genuine Yuan Qi!Only experts at the Origin Realm above the Xiantian Realm could release their Yuan Qi.Seeing the opportunity, Mo Qi and Li Lingfeng immediately counterattacked Xiang Nan without hesitation.Xiang Nan's palm landed on the side of Mo Qi's sword, sending the Scarlet Flame Sword flying. Then, he punched Mo Qi's chest.Outside the arena, another peanut had actually flown over!The accuracy of this peanut was astonishingly high. In the next instant, it would hit Xiang Nan's fist. If it hit, then the power of the peanut would definitely cripple Xiang Nan's right hand.In a hurry, Xiang Nan immediately removed the power from his fist and took three steps back, only to be kicked in the stomach by Mo Qi.Li Lingfeng, who was rushing over from the side, was about to hit Xiang Nan's back with the long saber in his hand.Xiang Nan quickly poured the weather into his feet. With an almost impossible posture, his entire body leaned against the ground and slid out, avoiding Li Lingfeng's heavy saber.After settling down, Xiang Nan coldly turned around and saw a man dressed in white standing in the direction of the Wang Clan.The man was in his early twenties, and his cultivation level was around the fifth level of the Origin Return Realm!At this moment, the man was holding an empty peanut shell in his hand. He looked at Xiang Nan with a smile that was not a smile, and there was a grain of peanut between his right fingers.\"Good opportunity!\" Mo Qi and Li Lingfeng got a chance to catch their breath and wrapped around Xiang Nan from both sides.Xiang Nan glared angrily at the handsome man in the direction of the Wang Clan. The man raised his fingers with peanuts between them, which meant that if you dared to move, I would jump out.\"Stop!\" At this moment, City Lord Hong Zhen stepped forward and shouted, \"Who is so bold to disturb the town selection?\"However, now that the City Lord had just appeared, it was too late. The battles on the arena were changing in the blink of an eye.Mo Qi and Li Lingfeng had already arrived, using their best abilities.The Scarlet Flame Sword in Mo Qi's hand instantly slashed out three times. Three sharp sword qi shot towards Xiang Nan at the same time like a trident.These three swords were hacked out almost at the same time, which showed how shocking Mo Qi's technique was.Li Lingfeng chopped down the heavy saber in his hand. The heavy saber was like a huge mountain, and it pressed down with a magnificent momentum.The man in the direction of the Wang Clan was still smiling faintly, his eyes closely following Xiang Nan's every move.Xiang Nan was furious. He glanced at the Wang Clan man provocatively, as if he was saying, \"You want to help them?\" Alright, today, I will personally defeat Mo Qi and the others under your disturbance!At this moment, Xiang Nan moved. At this moment, time seemed to have stopped.Mo Qi's sword, Li Lingfeng's saber, and the peanuts in the hands of the Wang family man were all aimed at Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan's upper body suddenly bent backwards like a bow!At the same time, the last peanut in the Wang Clan man's hand pierced through the sky with a whoosh and shot in the direction of Xiang Nan.This peanut was incredibly fast after adding a small amount of Yuan Qi! It instantly cut through a long distance, and almost in the next moment, it was already close to sticking to Xiang Nan's back.At this moment, the lightning veins in Xiang Nan's body once again exploded to its limit!The direction the peanuts flew in was predictable. As long as Xiang Nan's upper body bounced back, he would definitely be hit.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He forcefully pierced through the back of his long shirt, but failed to hit Xiang Nan's fleshly body.This time, Xiang Nan's back somersault focused all of his strength on his feet. Not only did he dodge the peanuts, he dodged Mo Qi's Trident Sword Qi, and dodged Li Lingfeng's heavy saber descending from the sky.He even used his feet to kick Mo Qi and Li Lingfeng's chests.Mo Qi and Li Lingfeng were kicked to the point their chests caved in. They didn't even have time to react. At the same time, they coughed out a large mouthful of blood and fainted before they were sent flying out of the arena.Swoosh! Xiang Nan successfully landed on the ground and stood upright on the arena.The entire arena was completely silent.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!Won? The audience was dumbfounded.He actually \u2026 won? Xiang Nan won the battle with one versus three?Especially since he was alone, he had defeated thirty-nine young masters without rest!This was an unprecedented victory in the Bluestone Town Election! He won so beautifully, so shockingly.\"I declare!\" When the referee came on stage, he grabbed Xiang Nan's right hand and raised it high up, shouting loudly, \"Blue Stone City, Blue Stone Town's regional town election is over.\"\"First place, from Bluestone Town, Xiang Clan, Xiang Nan!\"Boom! The scene exploded, and countless spectators cheered loudly.This way of winning overturned everyone's perceptions and even made them forget that they had lost the bet.If it weren't for the fence blocking the edge of the spectators' seats, there would probably have been spectators rushing down by now.The referee raised Xiang Nan's hand high up, announcing Xiang Nan's glorious victory. This was the most unbelievable victory in the history of the town election.At this moment, countless people cheered for Xiang Nan. There was only one protagonist in the entire town selection, and that was Xiang Nan.\"Since the Xiang Clan has this child, it seems that they are going to rise again.\" City Lord Hong Zhen nodded in relief. He seemed to have seen the future of the Xiang Clan.The referee said to Xiang Nan, \"According to the previous agreement, you won all the money in the gambling house. Someone will personally deliver it to the Xiang family later.\"Xiang Nan nodded slightly. He took a deep breath. He was in a good mood. It seemed like his Lightning Meridian talent was really strong.However \u2026 the young man from the Wang ClanHe turned around and looked at the Wang Clan. The mysterious young man had already disappeared.Only the Wang Changhe Clan's Clan Master roared angrily, \"Bring those useless trash home for me!\"Very quickly, the Wang Clan, Mo Clan, Li Clan, and the three great clans carried away the defeated juniors of their clans.This time, Wang Changhe had painstakingly tried to kill Xiang Nan, but in the end, he had become the biggest loser! It became the joke of the entire Blue Stone City.Everyone in Blue Stone City knew about the life and death contract that Wang Changhe had made with Xiang Nan.In the end, not only did Xiang Nan not die, he also won. Not only did he win, he even won so fiercely!This slap was enough to make the Wang Clan unable to lift their heads in the next few years.However, one thing made Xiang Nan feel very strange. The young man from the Wang Clan had clearly ambushed him and the City Lord had clearly seen him. However, City Lord Hong Zhen did not say anything and let the young man leave.Thinking of this, Xiang Nan secretly thought that the young man's background was definitely not simple.\"Xiang Nan.\" The City Lord personally came down to congratulate Xiang Nan and said, \"Come to the celebration banquet tonight. At that time, all the winners of the town selection in Blue Stone City will come.\"\"Alright, thank you Uncle Hong for your hospitality.\" Xiang Nan smiled and nodded. He did not have the arrogance he had after winning.Seeing this, Hong Zhen praised Xiang Nan, \"Xiang Zhanxiong has a grandson like you. It's worth it!\"In a noisy atmosphere, Xiang Nan left the arena and returned to Bluestone Town.But behind him, there was a tide of people. As they followed Xiang Nan, they rushed to inform everyone about what had happened in the Bluestone Town Election.It was as if the winner was not Xiang Nan, but the spectators who were fortunate enough to see Xiang Nan's spectacular game.At this moment, no one dared to shout at Xiang Nan anymore. Even a fool knew that Xiang Nan was a youth with boundless prospects! Who would dare to offend him in the slightest?This was especially true for Xiang Nan, who was definitely a celebrity beside City Lord Hong Zhen.Xiang Nan was unable to withstand the disturbance and directly used force to speed up his return to Blue Stone Town like a gust of wind.When he got home, he couldn't wait to tell his parents the good news.Xiang Zhanxiong even made an exception and left the cultivation room. The entire family was filled with joy.Before Xiang Nan could chat with his family, he heard someone shouting loudly from outside the mansion.\"Bluestone City, the Huang Clan is here to pay their respects!\"\"Oh, Huang Clan?\" Xiang Zhanxiong and Xiang Shaohua were both stunned, but they saw a large group of people rushing in from the gate outside the mansion.The Huang Clan was one of the clans in Bluestone City, but it did not belong to the Martial Arts Clan.The leader was the Huang Clan's Clan Head, Huang Dengtian. Behind him were dozens of servants and many servants carrying two large boxes.Huang Dengtian cupped his fists and smiled, \"Brother Zhan Xiong, I heard that your mansion's Xiang Nan has won a great victory. I am here to congratulate you.\"\"Hahaha.\" Xiang Zhanxiong was very pleased with himself, so he was naturally in a good mood. \"Brother Huang, you're too polite,\" he replied.\"Black Rock Town, the Liu Clan is here to congratulate you!\" Outside the door, another shout sounded, and a large group of people surrounded them as they walked in.\"Oh? Patriarch Liu Luan Xiong.\" Xiang Zhanxiong had just received Huang Dengtian and quickly went to greet the Liu Clan.\"I didn't expect that even the people from Blackstone Town would come.\" Xiang Shaohua smiled incomparably happily.\"Greenwood Town, Liu Clan, Zhang Clan, and Cai Clan, come and congratulate us!\"Xiang Zhanxiong was overwhelmed and hurriedly called for Xiang Shaohua and his wife, along with a few servants, to greet the guests.However, the Xiang Clan had been in a terrible state of despair in recent years. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been in such a hurry.The news of Xiang Nan's victory spread across the entire Blue Stone City like wings.There was an endless stream of people coming to congratulate him. There were wealthy families, commercial clans, and many martial arts clans also came to congratulate him.It had been many years since the Xiang Clan had become as lively as it was today.Some people even knew about the Xiang Clan's recent situation. They even brought red lanterns and hanging colors, causing the Xiang Clan to decorate their lanterns and gongs and drums.Those who came to congratulate him all rushed over to chat with Xiang Nan, hoping to get to know a young hero like Xiang Nan.But before they could get close to Xiang Nan, the outside of the the Xiang manor became lively again.Two hundred city guards personally rushed to the Xiang Clan, and the one leading them was the referee who presided over the selection of Bluestone Town.The guests who came to congratulate him naturally moved aside tactfully.The referee smiled heartily and handed a wooden tray over to Xiang Nan. He kindly said, \" little Nan , open it and take a look.\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The more he looked at his grandson, the happier he felt as if he had eaten honey.Xiang Nan opened the red cloth covering the tray and saw two things lying inside.One was a red invitation card, and the other was a shiny golden card.The referee said, \"This invitation is from the City Lord who invited Xiang Nan to participate in the town election celebration banquet tonight.\"\"And this storage card contains more than three million gold coins. It is the winning bet you won today. I personally delivered it to you according to the agreement.\"\"Three million?\" The onlookers immediately cried out in alarm.Even Xiang Zhanxiong and Xiang Shaohua were shocked. They hadn't heard that Xiang Nan had won the bet!Because the news of Xiang Nan's victory in the battle was too shocking, so much so that everyone rushed to tell each other how powerful Xiang Nan was and how outstanding he was.However, they did not publicize that Xiang Nan had won the bet. It was probably because those spectators felt embarrassed that they deliberately avoided this matter.Xiang Zhanxiong laughed until now, his face stiffened, but he still felt pleasantly surprised one after another.Previously, Xiang Nan had sent back five million gold coins and a large amount of herbs, but now he had won another three million gold coins! This time, the Xiang Clan's turnover was certain!As for the guests, they all looked at Xiang Nan with envy. They all envied Xiang Zhanxiong for having such a good grandson.Look at him! The City Lord's Mansion personally sent 200 City Guards to send invitations! What kind of identity was this?Xiang Nan smiled as he accepted the invitation and handed the storage card to his grandfather, Xiang Zhanxiong.Then, he cupped his fists and cupped his hands to the guests, saying, \"Thank you, uncles and uncles, for coming to congratulate me. However, please make amends. I have to hurry back to Bluestone City to attend the City Lord's celebration banquet.\"Everyone hurriedly cupped their fists and cupped their hands, expressing their understanding.\"Naturally, little Nan doesn't need to be so polite.\"\"That's right. The City Lord personally invited him. That's a matter of great importance. Of course, it's the most important.\"The referee smiled and said to Xiang Zhanxiong, \"Brother Zhanxiong, let's go to the City Lord's Mansion together. It's been a long time since you and our City Lord have gathered.\"These words made Xiang Zhanxiong feel incomparably comfortable. He only felt that he had lost face for many years, and today, he had recovered all of them.However, Xiang Zhanxiong still clasped his fists and apologized, saying, \"I, Sun Xiaonan, will go alone. Someone Xiang's avatar is useless, so he has to stay behind to entertain the guests.\"\"Mm, understandable.\" The referee nodded reasonably, \"Then please find time to meet with the City Lord another day. Our City Lord misses you very much.\"\"Alright, Xiaonan, let's go.\"\"Grandfather, father, mother, little Nan has gone.\" Xiang Nan waved goodbye to his family and went to Bluestone City with the city guards.By the time they arrived at the City Lord's Mansion, the carriages and horses had already gathered outside the City Lord's Mansion.The town selection wasn't just Blue Stone Town, there were also six other towns, big and small. In each town's town selection, the top forty winners were invited.The other clans were thriving. Naturally, the elders brought their juniors to the celebration banquet. Only Xiang Nan came alone from the Xiang Clan. He looked a little lonely.At the entrance of the City Lord's Mansion, the people of the various towns and clans were greeting each other and humbly giving way to each other. They were all squeezed at the entrance.Xiang Nan felt strange in his heart. Why didn't those people enter the manor? Why were they all squeezed here?It was only when they got closer that they realized that City Lord Hong Zhen was actually standing at the door! Naturally, the people from all the clans didn't dare to cross Hong Zhen and lead them into the manor.\" Little Nan , you're here!\" Inside the crowd, City Lord Hong Zhen laughed loudly.Xiang Nan was stunned and asked in surprise, \"City Lord, are you welcoming me?\"\"Naturally, I will welcome you.\" Hong Zhen laughed and pushed the crowd away, heading straight for Xiang Nan.Everyone didn't dare to enter the manor without permission. Instead, they stayed at the entrance and waited for the City Lord to enter the manor. Yet, the City Lord's actions were only to welcome a Xiang Nan? This treatment is a little too bad.The young disciples of the victorious clans had originally thought that it was a good thing to be able to attend the celebration banquet. However, when compared to Xiang Nan, they felt both envious and jealous.Especially the Wang Clan, Li Clan, and Mo Clan of Bluestone Town.They were secretly staring at Xiang Nan, who had received special treatment, with ugly expressions on their faces.\"This\" Xiang Nan sensed everyone's gazes and said humbly, \"Thank you for your invitation, City Lord. Xiang Nan has felt honored to be prepared. How dare you trouble City Lord to personally go out to welcome him?\"The city lord patted Xiang Nan on the shoulder and said, \"You came to the city lord's mansion personally before the town election to try to get a spot in the competition. How courageous!\"\"In order to participate in the town election, you did not hesitate to sign a life and death contract. What courage!\"\"In the town election, you fought alone against all the heroes and won the first place. What a hero!\"The city lord seemed to intentionally say these words to others, and his voice was raised several times.He grabbed Xiang Nan's right hand and said, \"Such a courageous and courageous young hero deserves to be welcomed by me, Hong Zhen!\"\"Come, Xiang Nan, come with Uncle Hong! Our celebration banquet officially begins!\"Under everyone's gazes, Hong Zhen actually pulled Xiang Nan into the manor together!Everyone knew what was going on when they saw this scene. If they couldn't even tell what the City Lord meant, then they would really be an idiot.Xiang Nan had truly become the number one celebrity that City Lord Hong Zhen had taken a fancy to!Within the City Lord's Mansion.Six towns, each with 40 winners, a total of 240 people.Amongst them, only the top five experts of each town, a total of 30 people, and their family elders, could sit in the Ying Living Room of the City Lord's Mansion.The other winners and their families sat down in the main courtyard outside the living room to participate in the celebration banquet.Because the Bluestone Town's town selection competition was Xiang Nan's victory from the first to the last, he was unable to rank 2345.Therefore, Xiang Nan, Wang Jinghai, Li Lingfeng, and Mo Qi entered the living room.There were many seats in the living room, but they were also filled with people from various clans.The main seat was naturally the seat of City Lord Hong Zhen, and there were six seats beside him. The champions of the six towns were seated on each side of City Lord Hong Zhen.After Xiang Nan sat down, he immediately discovered the members of the Wang Clan, the Li Clan, and the Mo Clan.It was worth noting to Xiang Nan that the young man from the Wang Clan who had used peanuts to ambush him in the last round of the town election was actually one of the Wang Clan's disciples!While Xiang Nan was looking at the man, the man was also looking at Xiang Nan.The gazes of the two of them met in the air, but the young man's eyes carried a very interesting expression.This kind of gaze made Xiang Nan feel a little strange. Normally speaking, the Wang Clan had lost so much face now, so they should try to stay as far away from him as possible. However, the young man from the Wang Clan seemed to have a confident look on his face.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because of their existence, our Blue Stone City can grow stronger and stronger!\"Everyone raised their glasses and congratulated in unison.After three rounds of drinks, the atmosphere was lively, and the topic of discussion was naturally around martial arts and the wonderful performances of the six township selection areas.Following that, the City Lord announced on the spot that he wanted to introduce a very important guest to everyone.The important guest he invited over was the mysterious young man from the Wang Clan.Upon seeing this person, Xiang Nan paid extra attention.Seeing how respectful City Lord Hong Zhen was towards that mysterious youth, he knew that that person's identity was extraordinary.\"Let me introduce you.\" City Lord Hong Zhen pointed at the man from the Wang Clan and said, \"This person is Wang Xiaoyun, the eldest son of Wang Changhe, the current head of the Wang Clan.\"\"At the same time, Wang Xiaoyun is also a core disciple of our Blue Tide Continent's second-rate sect, Chihuo Sect.\"Once these words were spoken, there was an uproar!Second-rate sects? That was an existence second only to the eight great sects! To a person in a small place like Blue Stone City, a second-rate sect like Chihuo Sect was definitely an existence above the clouds!A junior from the Wang Clan actually entered the Chihuo Sect ? Moreover, he had become a core disciple of the Chihuo Sect !\"Congratulations! I knew the Wang Clan would definitely be extraordinary!\"\"That's right, Xiao Yun, this child has been talented since he was young. I've already seen it.\"\"Patriarch Long River, the nobility has produced such a talented person. This is truly the glory of our Bluestone City.\"Everyone's attitudes towards the Wang Clan instantly changed. Even the large clans in the other towns looked at the Wang Clan differently.\"So that's the case\" Xiang Nan nodded to himself. No wonder Wang Xiaoyun ambushed him on the day of the election, but the City Lord didn't blame him. So he didn't dare to offend Chihuo Sect.Immediately after, the City Lord threw out another bomb!Wang Xiaoyun was actually the sect representative representing the Chihuo Sect ! In other words, Wang Xiaoyun's words could determine who would be able to enter the Chihuo Sect in the future.This news instantly praised the Wang Clan to the heavens! His status had even surpassed that of the City Lord in this sensitive period.Everyone from the Wang Clan stood up one after another and went to establish a relationship with the Wang Clan.At this time, the Wang Clan sneered in Xiang Nan's direction.The situation was obvious. Most of the sects that had come to select outstanding talents were third-rate sects or even fourth-rate sects.At this moment, the involvement of a second-rate sect would definitely make the other sects very fearful. It could be said that the representatives of the other sects would follow Wang Xiaoyun's lead.Now that everyone looked at Wang Xiaoyun again, they were already quite respectful. This kind of respect came from fear and admiration.Xiang Nan frowned. He knew that his path of retreat was getting narrower and narrower. He and the Wang Clan were enemies, but the Wang Clan had obtained the absolute right to speak in the selection of Martial City.He was afraid that his future path would become even more difficult.Thus, the focus of the celebration banquet shifted from the six champions to Wang Xiaoyun alone.Xiang Nan also sensed that everyone's attitudes towards him had also quickly turned indifferent, as if everyone had deliberately kept a distance from him.Wang Xiaoyun gave Xiang Nan a meaningful look and cleared his throat.Everyone knew that Wang Xiaoyun was going to speak, and the scene fell into absolute silence.Wang Xiaoyun smiled and said, \"If it weren't for my strong recommendation, how could we, Chihuo Sect, have fallen for such a remote corner of Greencloud City?\"\"And this time, Chihuo Sect only gave me five spots, so I hope that the young geniuses of each clan can work hard.\"Everyone nodded respectfully.\"Young Master Wang is right. We will do our best to live up to the expectations of the Chihuo Sect .\"\"Yes, we will not let you down. On behalf of Bluestone City, I would like to thank you for your kindness.\"As the representative of the Chihuo Sect , Wang Xiaoyun had become a local emperor.At this moment, City Lord Hong Zhen looked at Xiang Nan indifferently with a look of sympathy and helplessness in his eyes.\"Young Master Wang, I heard that Chihuo Sect's status is extraordinary. He is only inferior to the power of the eight great sects.\"\"That's right, Young Master Wang. To be able to enter the Chihuo Sect is truly the glory of our entire Bluestone City.\"\"Can you talk about the situation of the Chihuo Sect so that we can broaden our horizons?\"Everyone asked, but the question they were asking was clearly to curry favor with Wang Xiaoyun.As for the young people who were preparing to participate in the selection of Martial City, they treated Wang Xiaoyun as if they were worshipping an idol.\"Haha.\" Wang Xiaoyun smiled and said, \"The reason I was able to enter the Chihuo Sect is partly because of my outstanding martial arts talent, and partly because I cultivated hard.\"\"I always remember one thing, that is, you can't be too ostentatious. You have to learn to be humble.\"When the women heard Wang Xiaoyun's words, their eyes flickered with bright little stars. They admired Wang Xiaoyun very much.Wang Xiaoyun's words were obviously a side attack on Xiang Nan, mocking him for being \"arrogant and domineering\" in the selection of Martial Town.\"Xiang Nan, you are one of the most outstanding young men in our Bluestone Town. Do you think what I said makes sense?\" Wang Xiaoyun suddenly asked Xiang Nan.This question exceeded everyone's expectations. No one expected Wang Xiaoyun to directly point the spear at Xiang Nan at the celebration banquet.Everyone's gaze shifted to Xiang Nan.In the entire celebration banquet, everyone was standing and listening to Wang Xiaoyun's speech, but Xiang Nan was the only one sitting in his seat.Xiang Nan's actions caused everyone to frown, believing that Xiang Nan was too arrogant.Xiang Nan's voice was loud and clear as he said, \"Our Xiang Clan was too low-key and couldn't bear to suppress our rival clans. That's why they ended up in such a miserable situation.\"Everyone's expressions changed when they heard this. They all thought that Xiang Nan would lower his head to Wang Xiaoyun. At the very least, he should be more polite, right?Who knew that not only did Xiang Nan not bow his head, he was actually fighting with Wang Xiaoyun!These words had already made Wang Xiaoyun's expression unsightly.Then, Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Also, keeping a low profile and being humble? That's the behavior of the weak. Sometimes, it's not our choice to keep a high profile, but because our opponent is too incompetent.\"\"Oh?\" Wang Xiaoyun's face was gloomy as he slowly played with the finger ring in his hand and said, \"You're too arrogant to say that.\"\"You think you're the most outstanding person? Even so, do you dare to compete with other geniuses on the spot?\"\"Haha.\" Xiang Nan smiled faintly and said, \"Your Wang Clan really doesn't forget to suppress our Xiang Clan at all times. Do you want me to make a fool of myself in public?\"\"However, that's good. I've fulfilled your wish. If you have any ability, just take it out.\"\"Right, right, right.\" The city lord hurriedly came out to make things right, saying, \"Since you want to compete, then naturally you will have to compete in martial comprehension. I have collected some very good cultivation techniques over the years. How about letting the outstanding geniuses on the scene learn them on the spot?\"Liked it?

The city lord's own cultivation technique was actually going to be taken out for others to learn! Every single one of those precious cultivation techniques was priceless.\"We can't use it here. Let's go to the main courtyard.\" The City Lord immediately ordered people to retrieve their cultivation methods and invited everyone to go to the open space.After hearing this news, all the families in the main courtyard were overjoyed. Even young people who knew that their talent was inferior to others would squeeze their heads open to participate in this competition.Even if I lose, what's the harm? After all, he had seen the cultivation technique. Remember, he would quickly write it down when he returned home.Soon, the main courtyard was emptied of a large area, and on a table at the scene, three cultivation techniques were placed by the City Lord!Looking at the three cultivation technique manuals, everyone present was restless. They rubbed their fists and were eager to try. Some even took a few large mouthfuls of tea. No matter what, they had to memorize as many cultivation technique manuals as possible!The City Lord stood behind the table and said, \"These three cultivation techniques are not of very high grade. The first one is a low-grade Spirit Stage, the second one is a mid-grade Spirit Stage, and the third one is a high-grade Spirit Stage.\"Hearing this, everyone's blood immediately boiled! Heavens, all of them are spiritual cultivation techniques!At this moment, the City Lord took out a stick of incense and said, \"Let's set a time limit of one stick of incense. Even if the person who learns a cultivation technique within the time limit wins, he can participate in the second round of the competition, learn the second cultivation technique, and so on.\"\"In that case, all the geniuses and youths who won the town election should come and participate.\"Everyone cheered happily. Spiritual grade cultivation techniques were extremely rare. A clan like the Wang Clan, the Li Clan, and the Mo Clan, probably only had three books and five books. If they memorized these three books today, it would be a great harvest.Looks like the City Lord has really invested a lot of money.Unexpectedly, Xiang Nan suddenly spoke. He looked at Wang Xiaoyun and said, \"It's just that it's too boring to compete with the winner of the town election.\"\"Brother Xiaoyun, since you want to make things difficult for me, why don't you join us?\"\"Xiang Nan.\" The City Lord's expression changed slightly as he whispered, \"You're crazy! Wang Xiaoyun is a core disciple of Chihuo Sect. Do you need me to remind you of his comprehension?\"Xiang Nan only smiled and didn't say anything, but Wang Xiaoyun laughed and stared at Xiang Nan, \"Are you sure? Do you really want to humiliate yourself?\"Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Then let's invite Brother Xiaoyun to humiliate me. How about it?\"\"Alright!\" Wang Xiaoyun raised his robe and walked to the center of the arena. \"Today, I will meet you, you ignorant brat!\"The City Lord loved and hated Xiang Nan. He loved Xiang Nan for his courage and courage, and hated him for the same reason.Immediately, the City Lord let the two hundred and forty winners of the town selection, together with Wang Xiaoyun himself, enter the reception hall. The rest of the idle people stayed in the courtyard.The City Lord held the first cultivation technique in his hand. Two hundred and forty-one people formed a circle. The City Lord personally read out the incantation of this cultivation technique. Everyone immediately comprehended it after listening to it.Hearing the incantation chanted by the City Lord, two hundred of the two hundred and forty people revealed expressions of embarrassment.Xiang Nan listened to the cultivation method and laughed in his heart. This cultivation method was quite strange. It was very different from ordinary cultivation methods, so it was naturally extremely difficult for ordinary people to learn it.However, he was knowledgeable. To him, this cultivation technique sounded like a child's play.On the other hand, Wang Xiaoyun had a calm expression. After all, he had seen a high-level cultivation technique in Chihuo Sect, so he had some ability.After the City Lord finished reading the cultivation technique, he said, \"This cultivation technique is called the Blue Cloud Sword. If you want to learn it to great success, it will take at least one to three years.\"\"My request is very simple. You only need to learn within one incense stick to reach a small success. Even if you follow suit, you only need to not lose the essence of the Blue Cloud Sword to pass the test.\"\"Alright, everyone, let's go out.\"Arriving at the courtyard, the City Lord held a long sword in his hand and said, \"I will use the three moves of the Blue Cloud Sword on the spot for everyone to judge.\"As he spoke, the City Lord pointed at a tree in the courtyard and said, \"The first stance of the Blue Cloud Sword, Autumn Leaf Slash!\"\"If you want to do a drill, you must stand within my limits.\"The City Lord drew a straight line on the ground, and then threw a fallen leaf into the sky. The straight line was exactly ten meters away from the fallen leaf.Immediately after, the Yuan Qi of the sword in his hand condensed and slashed out. The Yuan Qi condensed into a sword light and sliced open the fallen leaves with a whoosh!Everyone was filled with envy. That was the sword light! Only those who were activated by Yuan Qi could be called sword radiance, while those who were activated by the first weather could only be called sword qi.After the fallen leaves fell to the ground, the pupils of everyone who knew something about martial arts contracted!The fallen leaf was actually sliced in half by a single sword strike. Not only was the place where it was broken very smoothly, it was almost incomplete!One had to know that sword qi or sword light could be easily hacked out, but when the sword qi and sword light hit a fallen leaf, basically all of the leaves would be destroyed.However, the fallen leaves were neatly divided into two halves. This required that the sword qi and sword light must be refined! Be careful!It's the same as hacking a leaf with an axe. The leaf must have been smashed. Only by cutting a leaf with a steel needle can the leaf be preserved so intact.Seeing this, everyone clapped their hands and applauded, while the youths participating in the competition all had bitter expressions on their faces.\"Let's begin.\" After the City Lord finished his drill, he lit a stick of incense.Many youths were each assigned a sword, so they began to practice on the spot with all sorts of hands and feet.Only two people did not hold a sword, one was Xiang Nan, the other was Wang Xiaoyun.Xiang Nan had gone through the Autumn Leaf Slash's incantation once in his mind, and he already knew what to do. This move was to highly condense the Primordial Weather or Yuan Qi, compress the strike surface of the sword qi and sword light to the narrowest, and strive to obtain the sharpest cutting effect.Sword? It's just a carrier. The true essence lies in the way Yuan Qi circulates.Xiang Nan sat down cross-legged, and the Xiantian in his body moved according to the unique way the Autumn Leaf Slash operated.Wang Xiaoyun stood on the same spot and used a finger to draw, as if he was groping for something.The parents of those clans were all sweating for their clan's younger generation.After an incense stick, the City Lord asked all the participants to practice the Autumn Leaf Slash on the spot.The expressions of the youths were awkward. It was obvious that they had not learned it, so they could only brave it.A youth walked forward and stood in a straight line. He held a sword in his hand and condensed the weather into a sword. Then, he slashed out with his sword.However, the fallen leaves thrown out of the sky by the City Lord did not follow a fixed trajectory. The youth's sword qi actually failed to hit the fallen leaves!\"Failed.\" The City Lord shook his head. He didn't even touch the leaves and was eliminated.The next youth was even more exaggerated. His sword qi was actually more than ten feet away from the fallen leaves!\"Failed.\" The City Lord shook his head.Afterwards, of the 241 people, 210 were actually cleaved!The spectators were all confused. If one were to say that their clan's juniors were considered outstanding, how could they not even be able to cut the leaves?\"Autumn Leaf Slash is still too difficult for you. You have to do your best to compress the width of your sword qi. This will make it difficult for your sword qi to remain stable,\" sighed the City Lord.Liked it?

It's already pretty good that you can do this. Most people can't even cut a straight line.\"Only then did everyone understand that it was not that the accuracy of those youths was too bad, but that this sword qi was too difficult to control.In the end, the top 30 geniuses and youths began to practice.Wang Jinghai was the first to perform, and his performance caused a lot of cheers.This was because Wang Jinghai was the first person to be able to hit a fallen leaf with his sword qi! Unfortunately, the sword qi was not refined enough, and the entire leaf was destroyed.The second Li Lingfeng was about the same as Wang Jinghai. The sword qi also hit the fallen leaf, but it didn't cut down the leaf at all. Instead, it pushed the leaf away.Mo Qi's performance was the best. He had originally used his sword. This sword hit the leaf, but the sword energy was not enough to condense it. He directly cut the leaf in half.The city lord immediately took the leaf to take a look. However, he saw that the leaf was indeed cut open, and it was also cut from the center. Unfortunately, the entire leaf had lost about 90% of its surface area.\"Very good.\" The city lord nodded, \"It's good to be able to leave some fragments of the leaves behind.\"When the Mo Family heard this, they were extremely proud.As for the others, most of them were similar to Wang Jinghai and Li Lingfeng. They could touch the leaves, but they were unable to cut them apart. They either blasted the leaves away or sent the light leaves flying.Of the six champion youths, five had done almost the same thing as Mo Qi, and could already be ranked in the top six.In the end, only Xiang Nan and Wang Xiaoyun were left.Everyone's gazes were focused on the two of them. The two of them were the protagonists who provoked this dispute.\"Are you coming or am I coming?\" Xiang Nan smiled faintly without the slightest bit of pressure.Wang Xiaoyun also maintained his demeanor and said, \"Since I provoked the competition, I will give you more time to slowly study. I will first, then you.\"After saying that, Wang Xiaoyun straightened his body. He held a sword in his hand and his waist was straight. Just this hand stance was very handsome and beautiful, and it inevitably caused the female guests to scream.\"Xiang Nan, watch carefully. Let's see what a genius's perception is!\"Wang Xiaoyun circulated his Yuan Qi and poured it into the longsword, causing the entire longsword to immediately flash with a faint light.Immediately after, the City Lord threw out the fallen leaves, and Wang Xiaoyun slashed out with his sword!Its Yuan Qi condensed into light, and the sword light gathered without dissipating. When it hacked out, it was a meter long, but when it hit the fallen leaves, it was actually a meter long! It could almost be said that there was not a single bit of dissipation!One had to know that the sword qi that the teenagers had chopped out earlier was already showing signs of dispersing halfway through the journey.Swoosh! The leaves split in half.Everyone watched nervously as the City Lord recalled the fallen leaves. The City Lord lowered his head and looked at the fallen leaves in his palm. He couldn't help but nod in admiration and then showed the leaves to everyone.Everyone cried out in alarm when they saw the leaves.The fallen leaf was split vertically from the middle, and it was accurate! And the loss of fallen leaves was only 40%!\"Alright!\" The Wang Changhe Clan's Clan Master applauded on the spot, \"To be able to achieve such a degree within a stick of incense is truly worthy of being the number one genius of our Wang Clan.\"The City Lord also nodded, \"Thinking back to the first time I cultivated Autumn Leaf Slash, I didn't reach this level. Wang Xiaoyun, a genius.\"\"It's your turn.\" Wang Xiaoyun casually carried his sword behind him and made a \"please\" gesture to Xiang Nan.The city lord looked at Xiang Nan worriedly and tossed the fallen leaves out.And Xiang Nan, swinging his hand was a sword!Quick! Too fast! It was so fast that the audience didn't even have time to exclaim and question.At the very least, Wang Xiaoyun did a hand stance and aimed at the fallen leaves. However, Xiang Nan immediately drew his sword the moment the City Lord threw out the leaves.This sword strike seemed to be extremely casual, as if it had been practiced thousands of times.The sword qi sliced through the sky, and the fallen leaves were divided into two halves, slowly drifting away.When the City Lord saw this, his expression immediately changed drastically. He quickly retrieved the fallen leaves and held them in his palm to watch. This gaze was actually dripping with cold sweat!When he showed the leaves to everyone, none of them could speak.The fallen leaves that Xiang Nan cleaved were exactly the same as Wang Xiaoyun's. He only caused the fallen leaves to lose 30% of their value!However, this was based on three prerequisites. Only after careful consideration did he know the path.First, Wang Xiaoyun was six or seven years older than Xiang Nan, and he was also an expert at the Origin Realm! He spent much more time cultivating martial arts than Xiang Nan!Second, Xiang Nan drew his sword even faster. It could be said that he didn't even make any preparations and directly attacked, but Wang Xiaoyun did.Third, Yuan Qi itself was more condensed than before! The first weather was very easy to dissipate. A streak of sword qi was usually the most complete within five to six meters, and it was also the most powerful.But beyond this distance, it would easily collapse, and even change its shape.However, Yuan Qi was not. In the hands of powerful experts, Yuan Qi could be hacked out by hundreds of feet, or even thousands of feet, or even tens of thousands of feet!Of course, this depended on the strength of the cultivation technique. A powerful cultivation technique could better condense Yuan Qi before the weather, allowing it to gather and not disperse.However, Wang Xiaoyun and Xiang Nan used the same cultivation method! As for Wang Xiaoyun, he used Yuan Qi that was naturally stronger than the previous weather.Judge!Even though the City Lord did not announce who was stronger, Wang Xiaoyun's expression was extremely hard to see.How could it be! How could this be! How could that kid surnamed Xiang do this?The City Lord interrupted everyone's whispers and said, \"Second stance, Autumn Leaf Scroll!\"After saying that, the City Lord tossed out a fallen leaf. Following that, the tiger beneath his feet blew with the wind, and his entire body took light steps to reach the bottom of the fallen leaf. Then, the sword in his hand continuously slashed towards the sky.Streaks of sword light crisscrossed each other, but they never touched the fallen leaves. They only used the air currents brought along by the sword light to prevent the fallen leaves from falling, rising, deviating, or leaving.It was as if the leaf had been frozen in mid-air, and it didn't move at all!Seeing this scene, the spectators on the scene were all excited, and they clapped their hands and applauded vigorously.\"One incense stick.\" The City Lord put away the fallen leaves for everyone to see. The leaves were intact, and he said, \"After an incense stick, please invite the thirty youths who won the first round to come and practice.\"Those 30 people were all using Autumn Leaf Slash, and those who touched the fallen leaves could be considered to have passed the test.Everyone immediately started practicing again, but this time, they were clearly even more anxious.After bringing along an incense stick, the thirty most outstanding youths began to practice.The first teenager sliced the leaf aside and turned it into powder with a single sword strike.The second youth was even more exaggerated. With a single strike, the strong wind brought by the sword qi blew away the leaf without a trace.The rest of them also practiced one after another. They followed the example of the City Lord and chopped out strands of sword qi, intending to counteract each other with the strong winds brought about by the sword qi, producing the result that the fallen leaves would always soar into the sky.Unfortunately, the difficulty of this Autumn Leaf Scroll far exceeded that of Autumn Leaf Slash. After an entire round, all of them failed! Not even Mochi could do it.In the end, only Xiang Nan and Wang Xiaoyun remained.Liked it?

After the City Lord abandoned the fallen leaves, he took a quick step forward.He saw the sword in his hand continuously hacking out, streaks of sword light crisscrossing and swishing towards the sky.As for that leaf, it was constantly leaping up and down in the wind driven by the sword light, clashing with each other and swaying unsteadily.This was already extremely rare. Everyone was intoxicated as they watched it. Waves after waves of cheers rang out.In the end, Wang Xiaoyun let the fallen leaf stay in mid-air for nearly ten breaths before landing on the ground due to a mistake.A single breath of this world represented the time an ordinary person took to breathe in and out. It was about four seconds, and ten breaths was forty seconds, almost a minute.\"It's your turn.\" Wang Xiaoyun wiped the sweat from his nervousness. His face was full of confidence. He believed that this time, Xiang Nan could not surpass him no matter what.Xiang Nan smiled and walked into the open space. Then, the City Lord tossed the fallen leaves away.Immediately afterwards, Xiang Nan actually had a sword in his hand, his left hand behind his back, and he casually slashed out with a sword!Sword Qi soared into the sky, blowing the falling leaves in the sky, followed by the second, third, fourth, and fifth swordsSword after sword, sword after sword! The strands of sword qi were neat and even, like the perfect lines written on rice paper with ink brush against a ruler!He seemed to act casually, but in reality, the sword qi was extremely accurate, no more, no less. Each sword qi had the same strength, the same speed, and the same degree of condensation!The leaf seemed to have stopped moving in the sky. It didn't move, nor did it tremble.The scene fell into a deathly silence once again.If it was said that the city lord of the first round was still able to take care of Wang Xiaoyun's face, he didn't give Xiang Nan and Wang Xiaoyun the upper hand.In this second round, anyone with eyes could see who was the strongest genius.Wang Xiaoyun's face was filled with frustration. His face was completely red from being suppressed. He had never thought that he would want to make things difficult for Xiang Nan, but in the end, he was fiercely beaten in the face by Xiang Nan.\"This doesn't count!\" At this moment, Wang Xiaoyun no longer cared about his dignity. He angrily said, \"The cultivation methods I cultivate are all biased towards the berserk type!\"\"This Blue Cloud Sword Technique clearly doesn't conform to my martial arts characteristics! That's why Xiang Nan took advantage of me.\"As soon as these words were spoken, the City Lord frowned slightly. He thought to himself that this Wang Xiaoyun looked elegant and graceful, but he was actually such a petty person. If he lost, he would lose, but he refused to admit it.\"Alright then.\" The City Lord nodded, \"Since only the two of you have won this round, then the third round will begin.\"In the third round, the City Lord practiced the Blue Cloud Sword. The name of this move was exactly the same as the cultivation technique. It could be seen that it was the most difficult and powerful move.The City Lord tossed out the fallen leaves, and he was in a straight line, ten meters away from the fallen leaves. However, he used sword beams to swiftly hack at the fallen leaves.The fallen leaf swayed back and forth in the collision of the sword light, jumping up and down, finally landing on the ground, and was retracted by the City Lord.What was frightening was that when he showed it to everyone, everyone's faces had already turned pale from fear.The fallen leaf was not chopped into pieces, but on the surface of the leaf was a neat and neat word \"sword\"!Even Xiang Nan couldn't help but applaud this scene. It seemed that City Lord Hong Zhen really had some skills.Seeing this, Wang Xiaoyun's face had already turned very pale. Obviously, he felt extremely exhausted.After an incense stick, Xiang Nan and Wang Xiaoyun were going to compete in the last round of the Blue Cloud Sword.The other contestants could only watch from afar, but the way they looked at Xiang Nan was very different. It could be said that there was a kind of fear in their eyes as if they were looking at a monster.He didn't know how terrifying the difference in talent between him and Xiang Nan was.\"I'll go first.\" Wang Xiaoyun took a deep breath and was ready.Wang Changhe's expression was very nervous. He knew that Wang Xiaoyun definitely wouldn't be able to do it well, but he expected that Xiang Nan would definitely be worse.\"Begin.\" The City Lord tossed the fallen leaves away.Wang Xiaoyun took a deep breath and immediately slashed out with the sword in his hand!Sword beams shot out randomly, causing the fallen leaves to churn up and down. However, it was clear that the leaves were in a terrible state.After the leaves landed on the ground, the City Lord took them back and showed them to everyone.The leaf had already been hacked into a sorry state. Fifty percent of its surface had been lost. On the remaining leaf surface, one could only see a paradoxical word \"sword\" crooked and crooked.Moreover, this sword only had the upper half, and the lower half had disappeared along with Yezi.Wang Xiaoyun gritted his teeth and looked at Xiang Nan fiercely. He thought to himself that if I could do this, you definitely wouldn't be able to do it!Everyone's gaze shifted to Xiang Nan once again.\" Little Nan , you're ready!\" The City Lord threw out a new leaf.Xiang Nan still had a smile on his face. He had his left hand behind his back, and there was a sword in his hand aimed at the fallen leaves in the sky. It was directly the Nine Swords!Quick! His speed was frighteningly fast! He didn't chop one sword qi after another, but used his fastest speed to chop out nine sword qi at once!The nine strands of Sword Qi struck the leaves one after another. Each strand of Sword Qi did not cut the leaves apart, leaving only traces of the sword Qi's edge.The drill ended in an instant.\"Beautiful!\" The City Lord no longer cared about his identity and shouted on the spot.After retrieving the fallen leaves, the expression on his face was incomparably wonderful, and he then showed the leaves to everyone.\"Sword!\"On the fallen leaf, the word \"sword\" was incomparably clear and true!Moreover, this sword character actually contained the charm of the sword, the smell of the sword, and the spirit of the sword!If the word \"write\" of the City Lord was just a word.In that case, the sword character Xiang Nan wrote really carried a bit of the sharpness of the sword.It had a charm!The City Lord held the fallen leaves and was speechless for a long time.Xiang Nan's sword characters weren't as neat as his own, but they had a taste that he couldn't even write.This kind of character could not be written unless he had been immersed in the path of the Sword Dao for dozens of years.However, this kind of character was written by a sixteen-year-old youth. It was simply unimaginable.Everyone present had big mouths and almost forgot to breathe in shock.\"Wang Xiaoyun.\" Xiang Nan turned around and retracted his sword. He stood there in a beautiful retracted position. He pointed at Wang Xiaoyun and said, \"What else do you have to say?\"Wang Xiaoyun's entire face was red and purple, purple and blue, and he wished he could find a crack in the ground.In his entire life, he had never encountered such a huge defeat in martial arts, especially when he was defeated by a sixteen-year-old youth at the first level of the Xiantian realm.This sense of defeat made Wang Xiaoyun unwilling to accept it, and he was absolutely unwilling to accept it!\"That's right.\" After a long time, the City Lord let out a long sigh and said, \"Both of you did well. Actually, I think \u2026\"\"No!\" Wang Xiaoyun roared. He was so angry that his long hair fell down like a madman.\"Xiao Yun.\" The City Lord frowned.Wang Xiaoyun said angrily, \"What kind of comprehension consideration is this!

So what? Smart? A woman needs to be smart! This is martial arts, not sewing!\"Wang Xiaoyun had completely lost his demeanor, causing everyone to be stunned.\"Then what do you think we should do?\" The City Lord frowned. He originally wanted to give Wang Xiaoyun a step down, but Wang Xiaoyun didn't appreciate it.Xiang Nan looked at Wang Xiaoyun with a faint smile. He saw that this brat had lost his dignity and identity. He saw that he was written as a \"rogue\" in the hearts of everyone.Wang Xiaoyun said angrily, \"To compete with comprehension, it is naturally to compete with comprehension ability! Then we need to find an unfathomable cultivation technique, and everyone will compete with comprehension ability!\"\"No one else can do it. Only I can do it. This is called a high level of comprehension!\"Only I can succeed? These words were uttered by Wang Xiaoyun and sounded extremely ear-piercing.Obviously, Wang Xiaoyun had been spoiled by his family since he was young. He could only accept that everyone praised him alone and would never allow anyone to steal his limelight.This kind of behavior was clearly a child who fought for the favor of his parents. How could he be an adult?\"Alright.\" The City Lord was already in a bad mood. He nodded and said, \"What do you mean, there's no need to compare the next two cultivation techniques?\"\"No need!\" Wang Xiaoyun waved his hand and said, \"Find a high difficulty technique! It would be best if you, the City Lord, didn't learn it.\"The City Lord took a deep breath and endured Wang Xiaoyun's arrogant words. He nodded and said, \"Coincidentally, I have one here.\"With that, the City Lord flew into the air and returned in less than a cup of tea. He already had a damaged book in his hand.The book looked tattered, without even a cover, as if it had existed for many years.The City Lord said, \"This technique was obtained by chance when I was young. Because it is incomplete and has never been practiced, the grade of the technique cannot be determined.\"\"In my opinion, this should be a fire attribute cultivation technique, but strangely, its cultivation technique is very awkward. No matter what, it can't be cultivated.\"\"Awkward?\" Xiang Nan frowned. He noticed that the City Lord's words weren't difficult, complicated, but awkward.\"Since you want this kind of cultivation technique, then you and Xiang Nan should come and comprehend it together.\"The City Lord directly invited Xiang Nan and Wang Xiaoyun into the reception hall, and then only taught them the cultivation technique and chant.Xiang Nan's brows furrowed deeper and deeper as he listened to the mantra.On the other hand, Wang Xiaoyun was at a loss when he heard this.This cultivation technique is very strange. As far as the existing part is concerned, the entire technique revolves around fire attributes.However, the awkward part was that if he cultivated according to the incantation, he would not be able to condense Xiantian into fire energy and Yuan Qi into Yuan Qi flames.It was as if an outsider had randomly created it. However, he carefully tasted it, and it seemed that there was some kind of essence hidden within it.Xiang Nan secretly mobilized the weather and used the cultivation technique to describe it, but he tried three times and failed to condense his fire energy.\"Strange\" Xiang Nan thought to himself, \"There is such a peculiar cultivation method in the world. Every time before the fire qi is successfully condensed, the weather will suddenly dissipate.\"\"This technique doesn't seem to want people to condense fire energy, but its description seems to want people to condense fire energy. Isn't this inconsistent?\"\"Could it be \u2026 that's right! That's right!\"Xiang Nan was shocked and broke out in cold sweat. He thought to himself, \"Damn it, this is not a fire attribute cultivation technique! This is a lightning attribute cultivation technique!\"After thinking through this section, Xiang Nan thought about it again. Every time he thought deeply, he was very surprised!This was a Fire Lightning Cultivation Technique!It surged like fire, and it was as fierce and domineering as thunder.Ray was too tyrannical! Moreover, it was too condensed, just like a bolt of lightning falling from the sky!Therefore, lightning-attributed cultivation methods were mostly difficult to form damage ranges. Even if they could be formed, they would still spread out into a huge power grid. The consumption of Yuan Qi was unimaginable.However, this book forcefully turned the power of thunder into fire! It exploded like a flame, forming a large-scale destructive move, but its consumption was far less than that of lightning.He really had no place to find after stepping through the iron shoes, so it didn't take much effort to obtain them!The lightning attribute cultivation technique that he had been thinking of day and night had actually been obtained because of Wang Xiaoyun's troubles.However, the power of this technique was too shocking. Xiang Nan decided to only do a drill and not display the power of this remnant technique in public.Later, the city lord invited the two of them back to the courtyard and said, \"I used 23 years, but I was unable to cultivate this technique. Therefore, I will give you more time today. Three incense sticks.\"\"Furthermore, I don't want you to really be able to cultivate it. You only need three incense sticks before you can tell me the truth.\"Hearing this, Xiang Nan smiled. He knew that he would win.Wang Xiaoyun couldn't possibly succeed! This was because one had to possess the Lightning Meridian talent to learn this damaged book.Even Wang Xiaoyun could not think of the mysteries of this damaged book.Afterwards, the three incense sticks began to count. Xiang Nan sat down cross-legged and quietly cultivated.The three incense sticks quickly passed, and the moment everyone was looking forward to finally arrived.The city lord clapped his hands, signaling that the time was up. \"According to the introduction of the incantation in this damaged book, an incomplete incantation can be practiced into a move.\"\"If I can successfully cultivate this move, I should be able to activate a fire ring. Unfortunately, I have not succeeded before. Then, I would like to invite the two of you to talk about it now.\"\"What exactly did you see in this cultivation technique?\"Xiang Nan smiled at Wang Xiaoyun and said, \"Do you want to go first or should I go first?\"However, Wang Xiaoyun sneered, \"Since I used to be the one to go first, then I'll go first this time.\"As he spoke, he looked at the City Lord and said, \"Lord City Lord, it's a bit too simple to tell the secrets of this cultivation technique. I can practice it on the spot!\"\"What?\" The City Lord and Xiang Nan were stunned.The city lord was shocked, \"You actually learned it?\"\"Naturally.\" Wang Xiaoyun was filled with high spirits.Everyone present was also shocked. With such a powerful martial artist like the City Lord, Wang Xiaoyun had only used three incense sticks to master a cultivation technique that he had not been able to learn for twenty-three years! And he could even practice on the spot?Xiang Nan also found it inconceivable. He couldn't figure out why Wang Xiaoyun could learn it. Could it be \u2026 Wang Xiaoyun also had the talent for lightning veins?\"Hurry up!\" The City Lord hurriedly brought over a table and said, \"Please Xiaoyun drill. It's right here on the table.\"The Wang Clan was so happy, especially Wang Changhe, who could be considered arrogant! Although his eldest son had lost to Xiang Nan in the front, so what?In Wang Xiaoyun's words, the thing before him was simply nonsense! As long as Xiao Yun could comprehend this cultivation technique, he would see what face Xiang Nan had.Under everyone's gaze, Wang Xiaoyun regained his calm and collected appearance. He tied up his long hair and enjoyed the admiration and admiration of everyone.Afterwards, he walked to the table and pressed his palm against the table, keeping a small distance between his palm and the table.Immediately after, he closed his eyes and secretly mobilized his Yuan Qi.After about three breaths of time, Wang Xiaoyun shouted in a low voice, but a ring of fire suddenly appeared in his palm!Liked it?

The core disciples of the second-rate sects were indeed extraordinary!

He raised his hands high and shouted, \"Who exactly is the number one genius of Bluestone City?\"Everyone sighed in admiration as they clapped their hands and applauded.However, the City Lord still had a suspicious expression. He seemed to feel that something wasn't right, and it couldn't be said that something wasn't right. He had flipped through this cultivation technique by himself. Although he hadn't succeeded in cultivating it, he still knew more or less about it.If this damaged book was successfully cultivated, would it really be like this? Something's wrong, isn't it\"Can't you figure it out?\" Xiang Nan stood on the city lord's body and said, \"You can't figure out what's wrong, can you?\"The City Lord nodded in confusion, \"Xiao Yun is indeed talented, but \u2026\"\"But the effect is different from what you expected, right?\" Xiang Nan laughed out loud, \"Do you know what's wrong?\"The City Lord shook his head, and the spectators beside him were surprised to hear Xiang Nan's words.Xiang Nan laughed loudly, \"Because Wang Xiaoyun did not succeed at all. He is cheating!\"\"What are you talking about?\" The City Lord was shocked.Xiang Nan nodded and said, \"Wang Xiaoyun only used a fire attribute cultivation method to deceive everyone. Perhaps he used Chihuo Sect's own cultivation method. Perhaps the effect of that cultivation method is somewhat similar to that described in this damaged book.\"\"So that's the case\" The City Lord woke up from a dream and patted his forehead. \"No wonder I always felt that something was wrong!\"Wang Xiaoyun's face immediately turned red and he angrily said, \"Xiang Nan, what nonsense are you talking about? What evidence do you have that I cheated? I'm using the technique from the damaged book! Since you've lost, you have to admit it.\"\"Stop spouting nonsense here! Do you think this will prove that you're stronger than me? It's so funny.\"Xiang Nan walked to a table with a faint smile and said, \"You want evidence? Open your eyes and see clearly. This is evidence!\"With that, Xiang Nan's right hand pressed down on the table, and a crackling sound came from the center of his palm.Immediately after, a very strange ring of fire instantly spread out!The ring of fire was actually crystal blue! It was precisely the fire energy condensed from the previous weather, but its color was too strange!What was even stranger was that the table wasn't burnt to ashes by the ring of fire, but instantly shattered the entire table!It was as if a five-horse corpse had been torn apart, and the table was directly blown apart, causing it to shoot everywhere!The power of the explosion was not due to the high temperature of the flames, but to the lethality of the explosion!The guests at the scene couldn't help but applaud. This was due to admiration from the bottom of their hearts, so much so that they temporarily forgot about their own positions.If he forgot to do so, would he offend the Wang Clan and Wang Xiaoyun?Tonight, Xiang Nan's skill was shocking. The talent he displayed was truly amazing.\"Wang Xiaoyun, what else do you have to say?\" Xiang Nan looked at Wang Xiaoyun indifferently.This time, the scene immediately quieted down. Everyone knew that Wang Xiaoyun had lost. Moreover, his loss was too embarrassing. He had such a high status.He actually chose to cheat in order to win against a youth five or six years younger than him! It was a disgrace.It was just that no one dared to make a ruckus on the spot.Everyone quietly looked at Wang Xiaoyun and waited for his reaction.Wang Xiaoyun stood on the empty ground. His face was first pale, then it slowly turned into an iron green color. Finally, it turned red, and even his eyes turned red.This expression clearly meant that Wang Xiaoyun was already furious.\"Alright!\" Wang Xiaoyun shouted. His right hand grabbed back and unsheathed his sword. He angrily said to Xiang Nan, \"How dare you humiliate my Chihuo Sect disciple in front of everyone! How dare you!\"\"My Chihuo Sect has never suffered a loss!\"\"Not good!\" When City Lord Hong Zhen heard this, his heart was filled with anxiety.Hong Zhen had seen too much of Wang Xiaoyun's expression and behavior.Sure enough, before Wang Xiaoyun could finish his sentence, he unexpectedly stabbed at Xiang Nan with his sword in hand. He wanted to kill Xiang Nan on the spot!The long sword sliced through the sky, bringing with it a sharp and domineering sword light. It was incomparably dazzling under the night sky.Wang Xiaoyun was an expert at the fifth level of Origin Return. Even if Xiang Nan used all of his strength, he would not be able to withstand his sword strike.Everyone present was shocked. No one expected that Wang Xiaoyun would start a massacre after losing the competition!At this critical moment, another thick and fierce Yuan Qi suddenly pierced through from the other side.The two strands of Yuan Qi collided violently in the air, causing a deafening explosion. Wang Xiaoyun's sword light was inclined towards the Yuan Qi, causing it to be blasted into specks of light all over the sky.The Yuan Qi that saved Xiang Nan was clearly many times stronger. After shattering Wang Xiaoyun's sword light, it still flew into the distance until it disappeared into the night sky.\"Hong Zhen!\" Wang Xiaoyun was furious and turned to look at Hong Zhen.Sure enough, City Lord Hong Zhen was maintaining his punch, and his fist was shining with primordial energy.Wang Xiaoyun pointed at Hong Zhen's nose and said, \"Even you, the little Bluestone City Lord, dare to stop me! Aren't you afraid of offending me, Chihuo Sect?\"Hong Zhen's expression was also very ugly, but he was speechless. Indeed, with his status, the Chihuo Sect could annihilate him with just a flick of his finger.At this moment, a sudden applause rang out from the clinker.Everyone looked at the source of the applause in unison, only to see that Xiang Nan was smiling and applauding. There was not even a trace of panic on his face, as if the person who had almost been killed earlier was not him.\"Little bastard.\" Wang Xiaoyun glared at Xiang Nan angrily.Xiang Nan said neither humbly nor arrogantly, \"What a good core disciple of the Chihuo Sect ! How magnanimous!\"\"But don't forget your identity. What are you doing in Blue Stone City?\"Wang Xiaoyun was shocked and immediately fell silent.Yes, he, Wang Xiaoyun, represents the Chihuo Sect to select outstanding disciples. If he killed Xiang Nan, then the Chihuo Sect would not have to mix with him anymore.What, your Chihuo Sect 's disciple representative killed someone because the candidate's talent was too strong? Then who would dare to enter the Chihuo Sect in the future?Xiang Nan's words pierced into Wang Xiaoyun's heart like steel needles.Especially when Xiang Nan opened his arms and said to Wang Xiaoyun, \"Come, if you are not afraid that your sect will punish you, then come kill me.\"Wang Xiaoyun hesitated for a long time and could only stomp his feet angrily. He pointed at Xiang Nan's nose and said, \"Good boy, there's yours. Wait for me!\"After saying that, Wang Xiaoyun stomped his right foot on the ground. After a violent burst of Yuan Qi, his entire body rushed into the night sky with a whoosh and disappeared.The moment Wang Xiaoyun left, the Wang Clan didn't have the face to stay here. They wanted to kill Xiang Nan three times and four times, but they were slapped fiercely by Xiang Nan three times and four times.First, Wang Jinghai and the others were overthrown by Xiang Nan, then the Wang Clan moved out of Wang Xiaoyun, but they were still defeated by Xiang Nan.After the Wang Clan left, the other clans came forward and cupped their fists towards Xiang Nan, saying some respectful and kind words.Liked it?

Everyone knew that Xiang Nan would definitely make a big splash in the future. Taking advantage of Xiang Nan's young age, it was important to get on well with him.\"Alright, alright.\" City Lord Hong Zhen clapped his hands and said, \"Since that's the case, the celebration banquet has come to an end. Everyone, let's disperse.\"\"Xiang Nan, it's been a long time since I talked to your grandfather. Let's go. Today, I'll go back with you to catch up with Xiang Zhanxiong and drink wine.\"Hearing this, everyone was moved.Hong Zhen's words were too profound! He was obviously not going to see Xiang Zhanxiong, but was afraid that the Wang Clan would kill Xiang Nan halfway and wanted to personally escort Xiang Nan home.Xiang Nan was also very touched. He whispered to Hong Zhen, \"There is no need for the City Lord to do this. If you do this, you will be at odds with Wang Xiaoyun openly. You are afraid of offending Chihuo Sect.\"Hong Zhen laughed heartily three times and said heroically, \"I, Hong Zhen, have been a smooth person for half my life. I was ignited by your hot blood tonight, so what if I accompany you to fight?\"Xiang Nan nodded solemnly and said, \"Xiang Nan will not forget the kindness of the City Lord.\"Hong Zhen grabbed Xiang Nan's hand and shouted, \"Someone, accompany me to the Xiang Clan in Bluestone Town!\"The night was getting darker and darker, but the little Bluestone Town was still brightly lit. It was all because many clans had gone to visit the Xiang Clan tonight and had not been willing to leave. They were just waiting for Xiang Nan to come back and talk to Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan and City Lord Hong Zhen easily arrived outside the Xiang manor under the protection of the two hundred city guards.The city lord smiled when he saw the large number of carriages at the entrance of the the Xiang manor . \"It seems that the the Xiang manor is very lively today. little Nan , you can go in first. I'll wait for you to have a cup of tea before entering.\"Xiang Nan looked at the city lord and was grateful. He cupped his fists at Hong Zhen and strode into the house.Hong Zhen was very meticulous. He knew that Xiang Nan was the main character tonight. If he and Xiang Nan entered the house together, he would steal Xiang Nan's limelight.At this moment, it was a crucial period for the Xiang Clan, so Hong Zhen took the initiative to give a cup of tea to Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan had just entered the courtyard when he saw that the courtyard was full of shadows and guests were everywhere to congratulate him. However, the atmosphere seemed to be a little strange at this moment.\"Ah, Xiang Nan is back.\" When the surrounding crowd saw Xiang Nan, they all smiled and greeted him.Xiang Nan nodded to the crowd one by one. From the path everyone had opened, he saw hundreds of strangers in the middle, \"confronting\" his grandfather.When Xiang Nan saw this, memories immediately surged out of his mind. These hundreds of people who had suddenly appeared were actually the Xiang Clan's fleeing clansmen.\"Huh? Why are they back?\" Xiang Nan frowned and continued forward.\"Haha, this must be little Nan . I haven't seen him in years. He really looks like an adult.\" Among the hundreds of newly returning clansmen, three old men stopped Xiang Nan's footsteps.Xiang Nan frowned. These three people he knew were his own uncle, his third uncle, and his fourth uncle.Xiang Zhanxiong had a total of four brothers. Among them, the eldest brother, the third elder, and the fourth elder were the three great elders of the Xiang Clan, while Xiang Zhanxiong was the second elder and inherited the position of Xiang Clan's Clan Master.However, when Xiang Nan saw the expressions of the three elders and his grandfather Xiang Zhanxiong's ugly face, he realized that things weren't that simple.Looking at his cousins, cousins, and cousins that he hadn't seen for a long time, all of them had arrogant expressions on their faces.As for his parents, he was unable to find them all of a sudden. After searching carefully, he discovered that they had actually been pushed to the periphery by the crowd.This scene caused Xiang Nan's eyes to narrow.\"Boss, Third Brother, Fourth Brother.\" Xiang Zhanxiong took a deep breath and his face sank like a waterway, \"Could it be that what you said just now is true?\"\"That's right. Naturally, it's serious.\" The Great Elder stepped forward and said with a smile that was not a smile, \"We are also members of the Xiang Clan. It is only natural for us to take back half of the Xiang Clan's property.\"\"That's right.\" A young man stood beside the Great Elder and helped. This person was the Great Elder's grandson, Xiang Zhonghua.Xiang Zhonghua said to Xiang Zhanxiong, \"Old Grandpa, in the past, you controlled half of the Xiang Clan's property, while my grandfather, third father, and fourth father held the other half together.\"\"Now that we've returned to the Xiang Clan, it's still the same as before, and it's still the same now.\"Hearing these people's words, Xiang Nan almost burst into laughter.With these people, they came back to split the money! Seeing that the Xiang Clan was about to rise again, they ran back to get a piece of the pie.Previously, the Xiang Clan was destitute. Later, Xiang Nan brought back five to six million gold coins. After winning the bet, he brought back another three million gold coins. In addition, there were countless guests giving gifts today. That was a huge fortune.This group of people had previously abandoned the Xiang Clan and escaped, but now they wanted to come back and split the money? The abacus was a little too good.Xiang Zhanxiong was furious. He angrily said, \"The reason our Xiang Clan was able to come back from the dead was because of little Nan 's efforts to turn the tide! If it weren't for his brilliance in the town elections, how could our Xiang Clan have the current status?\"\"You people are really shameless.\"Third Elder chuckled and said, \"We naturally know that it was little Nan 's contribution, so we won't compete with little Nan for anything. He can continue to be the future successor of the Xiang Clan's Patriarch.\"\"That's right.\" Third Elder's grandson said, \"We brothers have given up the position of successor to little Nan . We just want our own share of the property back.\"Xiang Zhanxiong was left speechless by everyone's words.As a matter of fact, everyone was a member of the Xiang Clan, and they all had close relatives. Their request made it impossible for Xiang Zhanxiong to refuse.Fourth Elder added another fire and said, \"Why, Second Brother, aren't you planning on letting us return to the Xiang Clan? You want to dominate the Xiang Clan?\"\"Grandfather, look what you said.\" A graceful girl covered her mouth and chuckled, \"Second Grandpa is the most reasonable. How could he do such a thing? Otherwise, how would he face the ancestors?\"At this moment, Xiang Nan suddenly laughed.Everyone was arguing fiercely when Xiang Nan's laughter sounded a little abrupt. Everyone looked at Xiang Nan with strange expressions.As for the guests who came to congratulate him, they were secretly observing. They wanted to take this opportunity to see if this young man, Xiang Nan, would panic when dealing with such a scene!If Xiang Nan's performance was good enough, then it meant that everyone had come to deliver the congratulatory gift today. It was the right gift!If Xiang Nan was captured by the returning tribesmen, it meant that Xiang Nan was not a big shot.\"Little brother Nan, do you have something to say?\" Grand Elder's eldest grandson, Xiang Zhonghua, asked with a smile.Xiang Nan did not answer directly. Instead, he smiled as he walked towards the crowd and pulled his parents over.\"Father, mother, you guys stand here.\" Xiang Nan placed his parents beside Xiang Zhanxiong and said, \"This is the position of your two elders. No one else can snatch it away.\"Good! Everyone secretly raised their thumbs.The first step was to straighten out his parents' positions. This was done beautifully.Liked it?

This was equivalent to slapping the faces of those juniors in disguise.Those Xiang Nan peers had interrupted without restraint when the elders were talking just now, and they seemed to know very little about the rules.Xiang Zhanxiong was very pleased. He nodded and said, \" little Nan , you can express your opinion. Our Xiang family understands the rules.\"Xiang Zhonghua and the others blushed when they heard this.Thus, Xiang Nan thanked his grandfather first, and then faced everyone with a serious expression.He swept his gaze over his clansmen and suddenly said, \"The Xiang Clan was in trouble earlier. Grandpas and uncles, did you leave the Xiang Clan reluctantly and take away all the property of the Xiang Clan?\"Everyone's faces turned red when they heard this.The three great clans were led by the Wang Clan. When they were about to annihilate the Xiang Clan, all of them ran away.Xiang Nan continued, \"You all disappeared, leaving us alone to guard the Xiang Clan. Have you ever thought of giving us a gold coin?\"Everyone was still speechless.Xiang Nan nodded, \"Since that's the case, there's no need for little Nan to talk about the feelings of his clansmen. Let's talk about it when we have something to say.\"\"By escaping from the Xiang manor , you are abandoning the Xiang manor . This entire the Xiang manor belongs to my grandfather and my parents.\"\"You've taken so many things, but you didn't leave a single one behind. Since you came back today, you want to divide them up? Alright, I'll return half of what you took earlier.\"\"Grandfather, how many properties did they take with them?\"Everyone was shocked. This \u2026 not only did Xiang Nan not give money to his clansmen, he even wanted money from his clansmen?Xiang Zhanxiong laughed loudly, \"At that time, the Xiang Clan was already depressed. Everything was worth about 2.3 million gold coins.\"\"As for them, they took 2.2 million.\"\"Yes.\" Xiang Nan nodded and said, \"Since you are a blood-related clansman, then spare change. Master, Third Master, and Fourth Master, if you want to share your family property, you can.\"\"Hand over one million gold coins. This is exactly half of what you asked for.\"The expressions of the various clansmen changed drastically. They all looked at the Great Elder in unison, hoping that the Great Elder would be able to solve this difficult problem.The Great Elder smiled coldly and said with a gloomy face, \"You want a share? Sure, we won't just give you one million gold coins, we'll give you two million and two hundred thousand gold coins!\"\"These 2.2 million gold coins will be directly put into the Xiang Clan's treasury, and then we will split it equally!\"What a scheme! At this moment, the Xiang Clan had nearly nine million in cash alone, and with the addition of two million and two hundred thousand in half, they would be able to obtain nearly six million!A few elders were overjoyed when they heard this, and they thought to themselves, Xiang Nan is still young, after all, and he is not in the mood for it.Everyone smiled as they looked at Xiang Nan and saw how this brat had bound himself.Xiang Nan's smile did not diminish. \"Alright, that's settled. The Xiang Clan probably only has seven to eight hundred gold coins left, right?\"Xiang Zhanxiong immediately nodded and said, \"That's right. Seven to eight hundred gold coins plus 2.2 million gold coins. Let's split it equally. Please hand over one million gold coins, boss, elder three, elder four.\"\"What nonsense! Do you really think you can deceive us? At this moment, there are millions of gold coins in the Xiang Clan!\" The Great Elder said angrily.\"It's 8.6 million, but it's all my money, not the Xiang family's money,\" Xiang Nan said with his hands behind his back.The scene suddenly became quiet. That's right, those were all Xiang Nan's \"private property money\". The clan's branch properties were all divided from the clan treasury, and they weren't directly taken from the younger generation.The Great Elder suddenly panicked. He pointed at a large number of gifts and said, \"Then \u2026 then, can we at least split these? These are the things of the Xiang Clan.\"\"Is that so?\" Xiang Nan calmly looked around at the guests and asked, \"May I ask everyone, are these gifts for my Xiang family or for me?\"At this time, the guests had already looked at Xiang Nan differently and were very satisfied. Naturally, they would not make things difficult for Xiang Nan.For a moment, everyone shouted, \"Of course it's for little Nan .\"All of the clansmen who had just returned were instantly ashen.Of course, the reason why they came to the Xiang Clan to present gifts and make friends with each other was because they came for Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan smiled faintly. He extended his right hand and said to the First Elder, \"Then, all of you, grandfather and uncle, if you still choose to return to the Xiang Clan, please take out one million gold coins.\"\"If you refuse to take it out, then pack up your things and go back where you came from!\"\"Well said!\" Many guests applauded in succession. Although this scene in the Xiang Clan had nothing to do with them, it was relieving to just watch from the side!The three elders glared at him angrily. They didn't expect that stealing chickens wouldn't erode rice!\"Divide or not?\" Xiang Nan's smile gradually turned cold.Everyone, look at me and look at you. All of them have bitter faces.They saw that the Xiang Clan was about to rise, and they really wanted to return. At the same time, it was because they were really not doing well outside.However, if they came back, they would have to pay a million gold coins as a price, which was unacceptable to them.\"Lord City Lord is here!\"Right at this moment, the loud shouts of the city guards suddenly came from outside the door.Immediately after, a burly figure walked in laughing loudly. It was City Lord Hong Zhen.Everyone on the scene moved aside and hurriedly bowed, \"Greetings, City Lord.\"Hong Zhen waved his hand and laughed loudly, \"Everyone, you're welcome. Today, I'm here to deliver a gift!\"Gift? Even the City Lord came to present gifts?City Lord Hong Zhen secretly gave Xiang Nan a thumbs up. Obviously, he had heard what Xiang Nan had just said.Then, Hong Zhen said, \"I came here specifically for Xiang Nan alone. As for my gift, it's very simple.\"\"As long as it's Xiang Nan's words, all the shops that the Xiang Clan opens in Blue Stone City in the next three years will be exempt from tax! Furthermore, they will receive all support policies.\"Once these words were spoken, the entire audience erupted into an uproar!Tax exemption for three years! How much is that?More importantly, all support policies! With the City Lord's guarantee, the Xiang Clan would be able to reopen their property. That was to say, they would have a smooth journey and be able to ignite their flames in the wind.While everyone was dumbfounded, the City Lord threw another bomb.The city lord asked Xiang Nan, \" little Nan , the Xiang Clan has already transferred all their shops in order to make a living, right?\"\"Indeed,\" Xiang Nan nodded.The city lord said, \"The new urban area of Bluestone City has just been completed recently. Then I will draw a boundary for the Xiang Clan to use as an industrial area.\"\"In the first five years, the Xiang Clan didn't spend a penny. They would first use it for five years. After five years, they would return the rent they owed for the first five years, okay?\"If the gift 'in front of the City Lord made everyone envious, then this gift would really make everyone's eyes turn red.New city!

With the promise of the City Lord, ten of them would be able to earn back a million!Even if one of their clansmen gave them a million gold coins, they would directly hand it over to Xiang Zhanxiong.After Xiang Zhanxiong received the money, he remained silent for a long time, but everyone was on pins and needles, depending on Xiang Zhanxiong's opinion.After a while, Xiang Zhanxiong let out a long sigh and said, \"Forget it, since you want to come back, then come back.\"Many clansmen hurriedly bowed in gratitude. This time, they were convinced and did not complain at all.\"Brother Zhan Xiong.\" The City Lord laughed loudly and walked forward, saying, \"It's been a long time since we've met. I'm not leaving today. Let's drink until dawn.\"\"We're not leaving anymore. Let's celebrate with the City Lord.\" Many guests expressed their opinions. This was a good opportunity to get close to the City Lord.\"Good, good, good.\" Xiang Zhanxiong was very spirited and waved his hand, \"Good wine and good food greets the dawn!\"This night laid a solid foundation for the rise of the Xiang Clan.That night, Xiang Nan's name shook Bluestone City.Everyone knew that a sixteen-year-old youth had relied on extraordinary strength and courage to pull the Xiang Clan back from the brink of death.Saying this was simply a bit of a fantasy, but the truth was that it was so dramatic.To Xiang Nan, this was just a small starting point.Afterwards, the Xiang Clan officially went on the right track, mainly because Xiang Nan brought back a large amount of gold coins as a foundation, allowing the Xiang Clan to regroup.Xiang Zhanxiong personally presided over the arrangements for the clansmen, and then started to get busy like a raging fire.On the other side, Xiang Nan didn't slack off at all. He didn't waste a minute, spending all of his time to increase his strength.This was because he knew very well that the Xiang Clan was not strong enough and could be suppressed by the three great clans at any time.A month later, the selection of the Martial Arts City was the key to the Xiang Clan's solid footing.Wang Xiaoyun had to get a good result before he could be chosen by an outstanding sect. At that time, Wang Xiaoyun would not dare to touch the Xiang Clan.Otherwise, without the support of the sect, the Xiang Clan would be devoured by the Wang Clan in a minute.After all, this was a world where martial power reigned supreme.In the Black Sharp Mountain Range, in a secret woodland.After two hours of cultivation, Xiang Nan spat out a mouthful of turbid air.He raised his right hand slightly, and a ball of early weather was slowly beating in his palm.As he refined the remaining medicinal pill power in his body, he muttered to himself, \"There is still one month left before the Martial Arts City Selection.\"\"As for the city selection, the age limit for the contestants has been relaxed to twenty years old. I'm afraid that there will be some Xiantian eighth-level or even ninth-level experts at that time.\"\"As for me, I'm only at the Xiantian First Stage. It won't be easy for me to fight them.\"Xiang Nan's expression was solemn. Although his Lightning Meridian talent could erupt with three times its maximum strength, it could only erupt three times.These three eruptions could defeat three peak Xiantian realm experts, then what? At that time, even a Xiantian First Stage cultivator would be able to easily kill him.Therefore, in order to win the City Election Battle, one could not rely solely on the heaven-defying attributes of the Lightning Vein. Only solid strength was a hard method!\"It's time to practice that half of the broken book.\"The remaining half of the book was temporarily named \"Fire Lightning Technique\" by Xiang Nan.He didn't know what grade this Fire Lightning Technique belonged to, but Xiang Nan knew that the power of this technique was astonishing. At least, it was above the high-grade Spiritual Grade!It might even be an Earth Grade cultivation technique that surpassed spirit grade.Xiang Nan raised his right hand slightly. A crystal blue dot the size of a grain of rice floated in the center of his palm. It was exceptionally dazzling.\"On that day, I was in the City Lord's Mansion to test my skills. It's not clear how powerful this ring of fire was.\"Xiang Nan thought for a moment and named this move Thunder Clap .\"I'd like to see just how powerful this Thunder Clap is.\"With that thought in mind, Xiang Nan circulated the Xiantian Qi in his dantian and quickly converted it into lightning power. Then, he used the Lightning Vibration Art to hold this power in his right hand.In this way, he felt that his previous weather was being sucked away like a whale absorbing water.His right fist actually shone with a dazzling crystal blue light, but what was even more shocking was that Xiang Nan felt that he could no longer control this power, as if he was carrying a mountain on his back.\"Sh*t!\" Xiang Nan's pupils constricted and he exclaimed, \"I didn't expect the complete power of the Thunder Clap to be so great. I must release it immediately, otherwise, my body will explode and die!\"Xiang Nan didn't have time to think about it, so he immediately jumped up and punched heavily on the ground.Crystal blue lightning energy poured out. Following Xiang Nan's punch, the crystal blue lightning energy instantly transformed into a giant crystal blue ring of fire.Boom! !The entire earth trembled from this punch, and the terrifying crystal-blue flames scattered like waves.Xiang Nan could only feel a blue light in front of him. The ring of flames roared, roaring furiously, tearing apart everything that had happened to him.The deafening explosions that filled the mountains and fields were even mixed with the faint howls of tigers!After the blue light in the sky disappeared, the scene in front of him shocked Xiang Nan, who had seen a lot of things.\"This \u2026 Is this really caused by a Xiantian First Stage martial artist?\" Xiang Nan's eyes widened in disbelief.It was a hemispherical \"crater\" with a diameter of ten meters. The outer edge of the crater was a radial pattern that spread in all directions. Xiang Nan stood at the core of the giant crater.What was even more terrifying was that an entire radius of one mile had been razed to the ground!The trees and rocks were all gone! The ground was flat and smooth, looking down from above, it was a neat circular clearing.Only at the edge of the \"radiation zone\" a mile away could one see intact trees and rocks.Xiang Nan took a few deep breaths, his mood unable to calm down for a long time.\"This fire and lightning technique is definitely an earth-level technique!\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and clenched his fists. That's right, it was at least an earth-level technique!At the very least, it was an Earth Grade cultivation technique that could trigger a Heaven and Earth phenomenon, and when he released Thunder Clap earlier, he clearly heard the roar of a tiger.\"No, it's not suitable to stay here for long. Retreat!\" Xiang Nan calmed his emotions and immediately ran into the distance.With such a big move, he would definitely disturb the martial arts experts of the nearby towns. If anyone found out that he, Xiang Nan, had created this open space, the consequences would be unimaginable.As he sprinted, Xiang Nan was thinking about another question.His previous weather wasn't enough to consume Thunder Claps! The Thunder Clap waves did not display their full power at all. It was precisely because his previous weather was too little that he drained all of his previous weather at once.Liked it?

This is not the result I hope to see.\"He calmly analyzed the situation and found the crux of the problem.This Thunder Clap was like a car, and his strength was equivalent to an ox. Obviously, he was now a little cow pulling a big cart, and his initial weather was too little, so he had to hurry up and raise his cultivation level.\"What a pity.\" Xiang Nan shook his head, \"That Fire Lightning Technique is only half a damaged book. There is only one skill in it, but there is no body refinement or Qigong technique.\"Skill moves were only used for battles. Only body refinement and Qigong techniques could be used to raise a martial artist's realm. Choosing between body refinement or Qigong techniques could both raise a martial artist's realm.His own characteristic was the power of thunder and lightning, so it was obvious that Qi Condensation was more suitable for him.However, at this moment, Xiang Nan thought of something else. He muttered, \"Speaking of lightning-attributed Qi Refining Techniques, the Nine Transformations of Thunder is definitely the strongest in the world.\"\"Since I don't have a fire and lightning technique, I can use the Nine Transformations of Thunder to replace it.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan took out a yellow talisman paper from his storage ring. This was the lightning talisman that sealed the 17th place on the Divine Lightning Rankings, White Flame Lightning!Xiang Nan sat down cross-legged and threw the lightning talisman into the air. What was amazing was that the lightning talisman actually floated in midair without falling.Xiang Nan's expression was hesitant. He thought to himself that the minimum requirement for cultivating the Nine Transformations of Thunder was the Xiantian realm. He didn't know if he could withstand it, so he decided to give it a try.After finishing his plan, he first swallowed a small pill. This pill was not a medicinal pill, but was made by grinding the first-grade Spring Return Grass.As the pill entered his stomach, the medicinal properties of the spiritual herbs slowly spread out. Xiang Nan was bathed in a warm atmosphere. In less than a cup of tea, all of his previous weather had recovered.Thus, after making complete preparations, Xiang Nan took a deep look at the lightning talisman in midair, and then silently circulated the Nine Transformations of Thunder incantation in his heart.He possessed a rare divine grade Lightning Meridian talent. This formidable talent allowed him to have an incomparable affinity for lightning attribute techniques.The profound and mysterious Nine Transformations of Thunder were actually circulated extremely smoothly by Xiang Nan, as if a fish was getting water.After the incantation successfully entered a circle, the air around Xiang Nan fluctuated, and the lightning talisman floating in the air began to tremble.The Lightning Talisman sensed the summoning of the Nine Transformations of Thunder Art. Strange white arcs of lightning quickly spread out from the surface of the Talisman Paper!The white arcs were densely packed together and interweaved into a power grid, causing the land to form a vacuum belt. The surrounding trees were attracted to the ground and flew towards the Lightning Talisman one after another.However, the moment the trees touched the white lightning arc, they turned into powder!Seeing this scene, Xiang Nan was shocked. That was the source of the divine lightning. It was definitely not a joke.However, he gritted his teeth. Since he was ready to fight, he couldn't stop!Thinking of this, Xiang Nan immediately waved his hand, drawing only a white lightning arc from the countless lightning arcs on the lightning talisman.The moment the white lightning bolt touched Xiang Nan's body, it quickly merged into his body.In that instant, Xiang Nan's entire body was bounced up by lightning. His limbs were incomparably stiff, and he was unable to move at all. However, he could clearly feel the overbearing power of Bai Yan Lightning rampaging through his body!The terrifying white flame lightning filled Xiang Nan's entire body. At that moment, Xiang Nan was very worried that he would go crazy because he couldn't bear it.But then, a scene that frightened Xiang Nan appeared.He felt that the white lightning bolt had been refined by the Nine Transformations Thunder-shocking Cultivation Technique and transformed into power that fused into his body. At the same time, his realm began to explode! That speed was out of Xiang Nan's control.\"This \u2026 my realm!\" Xiang Nan's eyes flashed brightly.Xiantian 2nd layer!Breakthrough!The realm that he could only improve by assisting with high-grade pills and diligently cultivating was actually crossed because he had only absorbed a bolt of lightning from the white flames!However, he had only consumed a tenth of the energy of that lightning arc when he advanced from the first level of the Xiantian realm to the second level of the Xiantian realm! There was more stored in his body.If he did not quickly think of a way to consume the remaining lightning power, then what it would bring him would not be help, but destruction.However, his realm had just risen, and his body was in a full state. He didn't know if he could hold on to it even if he raised it once more.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth. He was truly reluctant to disperse this precious energy, so he forcefully continued to absorb it!He felt like his body was being blown up like a balloon, growing bigger and bigger, becoming fuller and fuller! He was about to reach the limit of what his body could withstand.At this time, the energy of the White Flame Lightning allowed Xiang Nan to break free from the bindings of his realm once again, and his realm soared in a straight line!Xiantian 3rd layer!However, eighty percent of the lightning bolt's energy was still left!\"I can't! I've reached my limit!\" Xiang Nan immediately gave up on advancing his cultivation.This was because every time a martial artist advanced a realm, it would take a period of time for their bodies to adapt to the new realm.However, there was still too much White Flame Lightning in his body. Xiang Nan thought of how to dissipate the remaining energy.He suddenly took a step forward and punched heavily into the sky. He roared, \"Thunder Clap!\"The Thunder Clap waves from this punch had actually drained all of the excess energy in his body! The Thunder Clap was blasted into an incomparably large fan-shaped light that shot straight into the nine heavens! This time, the power of the Thunder Clap was more than ten times greater than the previous time!Even half of the sky was reflected in crystal blue! The roar of a tiger in the sky was unexpectedly deafening!\"Hu \u2026 Hu \u2026\" He took a few deep breaths in succession, shocked by the terrifying divine lightning.This was too scary! He had only pulled out a small arc of lightning and created such a terrifying situation. What if he absorbed the entire White Flame Lightning?At the same time, that Thunder Clap was too abnormal! So many remnants of the lightning power in his body were still drained by the shock of the lightning?Xiang Nan couldn't help but be shocked in his heart. What kind of realm did he need to level up to before he could release Thunder Clap twice?\"Let's test it now. My weather first.\" Xiang Nan closed his eyes and checked the weather in his dantian.\"Huh?\" Xiang Nan abruptly opened his eyes and said happily, \"My current Xiantian Storage is actually three times that of the Xiantian First Stage.\"Under normal circumstances, every time a Xiantian realm martial artist leveled up, the Xiantian weather in their dantian would only increase their storage by half, and every time they leveled up, they would double their storage!In other words, just by looking at the amount of storage in the first layer of the weather, if he were to increase his cultivation by one layer, it would be equivalent to someone else's cultivation by two layers!That's horrible! This was the astonishing thing about the Nine Transformations of Thunder!He hurriedly rushed away. After leaving this place far away, he spent half a day to adapt his body to the third level of the Xiantian realm, and then continued to improve!Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately sat down cross-legged, and the Nine Transformations of Thunder Formula began to circulate again.He cautiously drew a white arc according to his previous method and merged it into his body.However, what happened this time was something that Xiang Nan hadn't expected!The white lightning bolt did not increase his cultivation like it did the previous time.Rather, the power of the White Flame Blazing Lightning actually began to directly attack Xiang Nan's body!\"Uh\" Xiang Nan let out a muffled snort, and his entire body actually floated into the air from the ground.That white arc of lightning split into countless threads of lightning that seemed to wrap around him like a round ball of lightning.Every inch of his skin was under the electric shock of the white flames and lightning!Liked it?

All the bones in his body were howling in pain, and his muscles were spasming.No! We must persevere, we must persevere! Xiang Nan clenched his teeth.However, the situation did not improve as he had imagined. Instead, it became even worse. He even felt his skin begin to crack and even break apart!\"Sh*t!\" Aware of the seriousness of the problem, Xiang Nan was unable to endure the indescribable pain anymore, so he quickly disbanded the Nine Transformations of Thunder's incantation and circulated it.In an instant, the white lightning shattered and dissipated in the sky.As for Xiang Nan, he fell to the ground from midair. During the entire time he spent drinking a cup of tea, he was convulsed by pain. Only after drinking a cup of tea did he recover.\"How could it be like this? How could it be like this!\" Xiang Nan frowned and gently rubbed his joints.Right!He suddenly understood that the reason why he had absorbed the lightning bolts of the White Flame Lightning for the first time was because he did not possess the attributes of the lightning bolt in his body! That was why the power of the lightning bolt had increased his cultivation by leaps and bounds.However, the second time the arc was absorbed, the increase was not in \"quantity\" but in \"quality\"!If the first bolt of lightning he absorbed was only one thousandth of the power of the White Flame Lightning, then the second bolt of lightning he absorbed could reach two or three thousandths of the power of the White Flame Lightning.In other words, every time he absorbed a bolt of lightning from the white flames in the future, the attribute power of the lightning in his body would rise to a higher level!\"Just now, I was almost fatal because I was unable to withstand the stronger power of the lightning. There are only two ways to solve this problem,\" Xiang Nan said as he rubbed his hands.\"First, raise my cultivation level. Second, increase my resistance to electricity.\"\"What's troublesome is that there is no formula to improve one's resistance to electricity in the Nine Transformations of Thunder.\"Xiang Nan sighed. The Thunder Martial King had created the Nine Transformations of Thunder in the Heavenly Tribulation Realm. Naturally, he didn't need to improve his resistance to electricity, and he didn't write a solution to this matter into his cultivation method.His Divine Grade Lightning Meridian talent also had a very abnormal resistance to electricity. If it wasn't for this talent, he would have been shattered when he absorbed the first bolt of lightning.\"There's no other way. I can only think of a way to solve it myself.\"To improve one's resistance to electricity, one couldn't use Qi Condensation to solve it. That required body refinement.Xiang Nan nodded, took out a paper and brush from his storage ring, and wrote down a paragraph of text.\"Second Grade Snow Cicada Grass, Second Grade Thunder Vine, Second Grade Rejuvenation Pill, Second Grade Blood Condensation Grass, Second Grade Stone Skin Pill, Spirit Grade Pill Furnace.\"Xiang Nan looked at the words and was satisfied.In his previous life, he knew many strange and capable people, some of whom his master called strange and disdainful to associate with. However, at that time, Bai Muchen's nature was carefree, but he didn't care about these things.Among the people he knew was a peculiar alchemist. That person had once mentioned a method of body refinement.That is, using the method of refining pills to allow martial artists to refine their bodies! Put a martial artist into a pill furnace like a pill.This idea could not be said to be unbold, but Xiang Nan felt that it was very feasible.Although this wasn't a body refining technique, it could increase his resistance to electricity and achieve his goal.\"I already have a Tier 2 Rejuvenation Pill, a Tier 2 Blood Coagulation Grass, and a Tier 2 Stone Skin Pill. Although I don't have any, the main ingredients for the Stone Skin Pill can be found in my storage ring.\"Xiang Nan pondered, \"Right now, we can only find Tier 2 Snow Cicada Grass, Thunderbolt Vine, and Spirit Grade pill furnaces.\"\"Looks like we need to go to the Azure Stone City's auction house.\"Apart from the pill furnace, although the other two were not pills, they were only spirit herbs, but because they were too rare, they should not be found in ordinary spirit herb shops.Thinking of this, Xiang Nan was unwilling to rest and immediately set off.In this troubled autumn, Xiang Nan knew that his identity was sensitive, so he made a simple disguise. He wore a loose black robe and covered his nose and mouth with a black cloth.Fortunately, Blue Stone City was close to the Black Sharp Mountain Range. Normally, there were many hunters, herb gatherers, and various caravans in the city. In this kind of place, there were many people who covered their faces to avoid unnecessary battles.Xiang Nan's outfit, which covered his figure and appearance, did not attract much attention.Sure enough, as soon as he entered Blue Stone City, he heard people discussing about the blue phenomenon in the sky. Some people said that it must be a martial arts expert cultivating nearby! I heard that many experts from the clans have gone to the back mountain to look for that expert.This caused Xiang Nan to lower his hood a little.Experts, those people definitely can't be found. How could they know that such a terrifying phenomenon was created by this young boy Xiang Nan?However, Xiang Nan searched the city until dusk. He could be said to have visited all the famous spirit herb shops, but he couldn't find the Snow Cicada Grass and Thunder Thunderclap Vine.However, the spirit pill furnace was already available, so it wasn't difficult to find this item.As for the two spiritual herbs, it seemed that he could only try his luck at the auction house.However, buying things at the auction house was likely to cost a large sum of money. At this time, Xiang Nan didn't have much cash on him, so he gave it all to his grandfather.The Xiang Clan was now at a critical juncture in their comeback. He did not want to ask for money from his grandfather. Fortunately, he still had quite a few spirit herb pills and precious calligraphy and paintings on him. He could use them to exchange for money.The only auction house in Bluestone City was just about to start a large-scale auction.This place was called the \"Treasure Gathering Pavilion\". Behind these three golden characters, there was a small pattern.When others saw the pattern, they didn't feel anything, but when Xiang Nan saw it, he was shocked!It was a clover logo. This logo represented an ancient mysterious clan in this world, the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan!The scope of this clan's business covered almost all fields. Just how enormous it was and how much energy it hid were still a mystery.Xiang Nan only knew that this clan definitely could not be easily offended. Even the people from the eight great sects had to be respectful when they saw the upper echelons of the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan.\"Their hands have actually reached such a remote corner.\" Xiang Nan hesitated for a moment before walking in.In any case, he was here to openly buy things. How strong this Huangpu Aristocrat Clan was had nothing to do with him.There were two exhibition halls in the Jucai Pavilion Auction House, and there were six auction halls of all sizes. Today, the largest auction hall was opened.The exhibition hall was responsible for displaying the items that were about to be auctioned off. It had already ended three days ago, and Xiang Nan had not caught up. Therefore, this time, it was just a blind cat trying to kill a mouse. It was all due to luck.The auction hall was already filled with people, and the buyers who came were all silent, their expressions extremely solemn.Although no one knew the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan in this small place, everyone knew that the Treasure Gathering Pavilion was built by a large foreign clan. Therefore, even the local wealthy didn't dare to make a mistake here.Very quickly, the oppressive scene slowly became lively. An auctioneer walked up to the exhibition platform and greeted the buyers politely. Then, he began to auction the first treasure.Xiang Nan glanced at the treasure and landed on a woman beside the auctioneer.Normally, there would be two assistants next to the auctioneer, but that woman was obviously not an assistant. She was just standing there for no apparent reason.Xiang Nan frowned and quietly sensed that the woman's identity was extraordinary!This woman wore a black veil and could not see her appearance clearly. The key was that there was not a single trace of spiritual energy fluctuation in her body! But Xiang Nan knew that she was definitely a martial artist.\"Her spiritual energy fluctuations are suppressed very ingeniously.\" Xiang Nan nodded silently, knowing that this woman was a master that could not be provoked.But at this moment, the woman caught Xiang Nan's gaze amidst the countless gazes of the audience.The two's gazes collided in the air. Xiang Nan pretended to look away as if nothing had happened, but the woman nodded slightly, appearing extremely cultured.Liked it?

The starting bid was 50,000 gold coins. The buyers on the scene all bid.The buyers who came to participate in the auction were all wealthy businessmen from the six towns. The upper echelons of the clans were also very generous. This inadvertently increased the pressure on Xiang Nan.Very quickly, the first weapon fell into the hands of the Mo Clan in Bluestone Town.The second item was a calligraphy and painting. The starting bid was 50,000 gold coins, which was equivalent to the price of a first-grade medicinal pill.However, Xiang Nan's attention was not on the auction item. He always felt that there was a pair of eyes that were secretly observing him intentionally or unintentionally.When he followed that gaze and captured it back, he discovered that it was still the same woman. However, the woman looked elsewhere and dodged in a timely manner.Xiang Nan became more cautious and began to pay more attention to the woman.The following auction process was very lively. People often bid up the price to an unbelievable height in order to compete for the same item.The result of Xiang Nan's secret observation was that the woman was observing the buyers all the time, not knowing what her purpose was.Finally, the eighth item was actually the second-grade Snow Cicada Grass that Xiang Nan wanted!The auctioneer smiled at the crowd, \"Second Grade Snow Cicada Grass. The starting bid is 30,000 gold coins. Every time the bid is increased, it will start at least 5,000 gold coins.\"Hearing this, many buyers were shocked.The average price of a Tier 2 Spirit Grass was 3,000 gold coins, but this Tier 2 Snow Cicada Grass cost 30,000 gold coins. It was still the starting price!Thus, the problem arose! Originally, many people didn't know what this Snow Cicada Grass was, but when they heard that its starting bid was so high, they were all curious.Someone raised his hand on the spot, \"Forty thousand.\"The auctioneer smiled in that direction. \"This buyer is bidding 40,000 yuan. Is there anything higher?\"Xiang Nan frowned and raised his right hand, but did not bid. The auctioneer nodded and pointed in Xiang Nan's direction, \"This buyer offers 45,000 gold coins.\"In the end, the buyers bid one after another. In just half a cup of tea, the Snow Cicada Grass was actually lifted to 100,000 gold coins!This was the last thing Xiang Nan wanted to see. This was a vicious circle! Everyone was curious about the unknown, and the more people rushed to buy this mysterious Snow Cicada Grass, the higher the price would be.Higher prices attract greater curiosity.\"150,000!\" Someone shouted loudly. The price was already ridiculously high.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and raised his hand again to bid 155,000 yuan.One hundred and fifty thousand was no longer a small number. It was enough to buy three mid-grade spirit weapons. Many people had given up at this time.However, there were still more than 20 families in six towns competing!\"Two hundred thousand.\" Someone made a bid.Xiang Nan was determined to obtain the Snow Cicada Grass. He couldn't allow everyone to pay such a high price. He had to give them a high enough price to intimidate them.Thinking of this, Xiang Nan raised his hand in pain and lowered his voice as low and hoarse as possible, \"Four hundred thousand.\"As soon as the price was announced, the entire arena fell silent.This time, no one bid again. 400,000 yuan for a second-grade spirit herb, isn't that crazy?Such an astronomical price was almost enough to buy a Tier 2 Spirit Pill!After the auctioneer asked the crowd, he saw that no one was bidding and decided on the spot. The Snow Cicada Grass returned to Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan secretly heaved a sigh of relief.Under normal circumstances, the Snow Cicada Grass was only worth 40,000 to 50,000 gold coins. However, there was no other way. Who would have thought that there was only such a single plant here?To be honest, Xiang Nan wasn't interested in the next auction item, so he didn't bid anymore. He just waited for the auction to end before trading.There were a total of twenty-five items in the auction. After all the items were sold, Xiang Nan was ready to go backstage to trade.But at this moment, the woman who had been silently standing beside the auctioneer suddenly walked towards the exhibition stand! But also replaced the position of auctioneer.She took out an item from her storage ring and placed it on the exhibition stand. For the first time, she said, \"This is a knife.\"Hearing this, the originally orderly scene immediately became restless!It wasn't because of the knife, but because of the woman's voice!People often use the sound of nature to describe a person's voice, but what exactly is the sound of nature? I'm afraid no one has really heard of it.However, if there really was a heavenly voice in the world, then this mysterious woman's voice would definitely be considered one!Xiang Nan was also shocked by the woman's voice, but his eyes were quickly attracted by the saber.It was a very strange saber. The length of the blade was three meters, which was considered too long for ordinary people.The blade was pitch black without any reflection, as if it was carved out of a piece of carbon. There were strange patterns on the blade.At first glance, this saber was too heavy, too large, and ordinary. It could even be said to be too simple.However, when Xiang Nan saw the blade, the Lightning Meridian attribute in his body suddenly changed!\"Saber!\" Xiang Nan was shocked and thought to himself, \"That blade is strange!\" My Lightning Meridian attribute can actually sense it.Buy this knife no matter what!At this moment, the woman pressed her hands down, signaling everyone to shut up. \"This saber is a low-grade weapon of the Mortal Stage. The starting bid is one million gold coins.\"The scene became even more restless. Just now, everyone's restlessness was shocked by the sound of the woman's voice. Now, the restlessness was shocked by the sky-high price of this saber!What does a low-grade Mortal Realm mean? That meant that this saber was no different from a saber forged from ordinary steel!This kind of sh*tty thing could be bought for a dozen or twenty silver coins!As a result, the scene was noisy, but there wasn't even a single bidder.No one could see anything special about this saber. The woman seemed to have no intention of introducing it at all, but her eyes curved as she swept across the crowd. Obviously, her face was smiling under the black veil.\"Is anyone bidding?\" The woman's eyes swept through the crowd, still maintaining a calm and elegant demeanor.Xiang Nan was worried in his heart. At this moment, his bid had become the focus of everyone's attention. However, he really wanted that saber.Not to mention a million gold coins, even if it was two million, three million, Xiang Nan would definitely buy a saber that could cause the lightning vein attribute to feel stress.Seeing that the woman had already stretched out her hand, she wanted to take back her saber.Xiang Nan sighed helplessly and raised his hand. \"One million, I want it.\"At this moment, countless pairs of eyes on the scene aimed at Xiang Nan.An unusual splendor quickly flashed through the woman's eyes, and that splendid gaze disappeared in an instant.\"Haha! Someone really fell for this trick!\" Someone finally couldn't help but laugh out loud.Others echoed, \"Yes, this broken saber costs a hundred silver coins.\"Xiang Nan ignored everyone's mockery and sat down calmly.The auctioneer stepped forward and smiled. \"This auction is officially over. VIP bidders, please come and trade later.\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On both sides of the corridor were a number of small trading halls that contained the treasures that had been auctioned off.Xiang Nan followed a maid to the tenth trading hall and pushed open the door. There were only two people inside.One was the mysterious black-veiled woman, while the other was a teenage girl.The little girl looked like she was carved out of jade. Her pair of big black eyes shone brightly, her small nose was cute and cute, and her snow-white skin was like a porcelain doll.She was dressed in brocade-clothed mink fur, and her large furry collar made her even more exquisite and cute. However, it was a bit too exaggerated to wear such thick clothes at this time of year.The little girl rippled her legs playfully. She took out a small piece of translucent pastries from an exquisite plate and put it into her mouth. She bit her head and tilted her head as she looked at Xiang Nan curiously.The black-veiled woman still did not take off her veil. She dotingly stroked the little girl's black hair and spoiled her, \"Do you want some water? Don't choke.\"The little girl grinned like the sun.Xiang Nan hesitated for a moment, then said, \"I'm here to take the things I took, but \u2026\"The woman's eyes curved and she smiled as she asked, \"But what?\"\"But I don't have any cash.\" Xiang Nan shook his head and said, \"Can I exchange it for something else?\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan took out a calligraphy and painting from his storage ring. This was the best and most expensive calligraphy and painting he had preserved, and it was even better than the one he had given to the City Lord earlier.Xiang Nan said, \"This calligraphy painting is worth about two million gold coins. It is extremely difficult to find a similar level in the market. I will use it to offset 1.5 million gold coins. How about it?\"Xiang Nan's actions were equivalent to a loss of 500,000 yuan, but who knew that the woman would shake her head with a smile?Xiang Nan frowned, \"Two million for 1.5 million, you're not even going to change?\"The woman smiled and said, \"I only want cash.\"Xiang Nan took a deep breath. He could tell that this woman was clearly making things difficult for him!As a businessman of an auction house, how could he not take advantage of it?\"Alright!\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and said, \"Wait for me. Two hours later, I'll take the money to buy it.\"The woman shook her head and said, \"If you want to buy it, trade it face to face. After two hours, I won't sell it. This knife is my personal belongings. It doesn't violate the rules of the auction house.\"The little girl giggled as she listened to the two of them. Her voice was as crisp as a pair of bronze bells.As for Xiang Nan, he couldn't help but say in a low voice, \"What do you mean? Tell me clearly.\"The woman stroked the black saber and glanced at Xiang Nan intentionally or unintentionally. \"You have to tell me why you bought this saber.\"Xiang Nan's heart sounded an alarm. Could it be that this woman knew that this saber could sense the attributes of thunder meridians? However, he said, \"It's just a personal preference.\"The woman shook her head, \"You're too disingenuous to say that. I won't sell the saber anymore.\"Xiang Nan felt that this woman was not simple, but if he really wanted to tell him why he bought the knife, it would be impossible!Lightning Meridian talent was rare in the world, how could it be exposed for a saber?Immediately, Xiang Nan took out another painting and said, \"This painting is worth about 700,000 gold coins. It's for a second-grade Snow Cicada Grass.\"After saying that, Xiang Nan picked up the Snow Cicada Grass and left.The Snow Cicada Grass was a treasure that was auctioned by the auction house. Xiang Nan had decided on a purchase contract after bidding. Women could not stop Xiang Nan.After leaving the auction house, Xiang Nan quickened his pace, wanting to leave this place as soon as possible. He always felt that the mysterious woman had other plans.Along the way, he quietly changed into his normal clothes. When he returned to his room, he found his mother waiting at a table with a steaming bowl of ginseng soup on it.\"Mother.\" In Xiang Nan's mind, memories and emotions belonging to the real Xiang Nan appeared, causing him to involuntarily use the intimate term \"mother\" instead of the word \"mother\".Mother kindly pulled Xiang Nan to sit down beside her. She stroked Xiang Nan's temples and said softly, \"Mother has cooked a bowl of ginseng soup for you. It has been three hours. Nan Nan should take advantage of the heat to drink it.\"Xiang Nan watched his mother recover from her long illness and her slightly pale face. He immediately felt a choke in his throat and a sour nose. He hurriedly said, \"The child is in good health. Mother, drink it.\"The mother lovingly said, \"Silly child, in recent years, the Xiang Clan has fallen into a state of despair, which has made you suffer. Mother's heart aches when she sees it \u2026\"\"Mother, stop talking.\" Xiang Nan couldn't help but hug her mother.Xiang Nan, who had never experienced maternal love in his previous life, couldn't help but feel his eyes turn red, and tears rolled in his eyes.He only felt that this life was worth it! Even if he didn't have any divine talent or lightning meridian attributes, just having a loving mother was enough.Her mother patted Xiang Nan's back gently as if she had coaxed him when he was a child. \"Nan Nan, come, drink the soup.\"Xiang Nan shook his head. \"Mother doesn't drink, and neither do I.\"Mother didn't know whether to laugh or cry, \"Then I'll drink half of it, Nannan, okay?\"\"Alright!\" Xiang Nan withdrew from his mother's embrace and quickly wiped his eyes.Mother drank half a bowl of ginseng soup and looked at Xiang Nan happily as he drank half a bowl of ginseng soup. Only then did she bloom with a happy smile.This half bowl of soup was probably the most delicious ginseng soup Xiang Nan had ever tasted in his previous life.At this moment, in the courtyard outside Xiang Nan's room, there was an ancient tree.The crescent moon curved. Through the moonlight, one could vaguely see that there was a woman standing on the tree. She was the mysterious woman of the Conglomerate Pavilion Auction House.The woman could clearly see what was happening in the room. Her eyes were slowly filled with a layer of gentle light.\"Right.\" In the room, Mother said to Xiang Nan, \"Your grandfather and the others are looking for you. I almost forgot. Nan Nan will go over after a rest. Mother will leave first.\"\"Alright, I'll send mother out.\" Xiang Nan escorted her mother out of the door and glanced at the tree, but it was empty.Later, he hurried to his grandfather's room.In Grandpa's study, the three elders of the family, his father, and some uncles were discussing.Xiang Nan came in and found a seat to sit and listen. Originally, there wasn't a seat for a junior like Xiang Nan here, but because Xiang Nan had made a special contribution to the Xiang Family, Xiang Nan also listened to what had happened in the family recently.After listening to the elders' conversation, Xiang Nan finally knew the whole story.The City Lord did draw a plot of land for the Xiang Clan in the newly completed new city, but if that place was to be put into use, it would take at least one to two years.In this short period of time, the Xiang Clan could not remain idle, so they wanted to buy back the property that originally belonged to the Xiang Clan in the old city.Unfortunately, this matter was obstructed by the three great clans of Bluestone Town. No matter how much the Xiang Clan wanted to buy back the property, the three great clans increased their prices even more.\"Bullying!\" Xiang Shaohua slammed the table angrily, \"They are clearly going to cut off our Xiang Clan's path of retreat!\"Liked it?

See if you can \u2026 let the City Lord talk to you.\"\"This is the only chance for our Xiang Clan to rise. If we can't get the deeds to the houses and land of those shops, our Xiang Clan will \u2026\"\"Alright, I'll discuss it with the City Lord tomorrow.\" Xiang Nan knew that this matter was of great importance, so he could only do so.After receiving Xiang Nan's reply, the faces of the elders of the clan became much more relaxed. At this moment, no one dared to make things difficult for Xiang Nan at all.It could also be said that the Xiang Clan now relied on Xiang Nan alone.\"Alright, let's stop here. little Nan , stay here. Everyone else, go back.\" Xiang Zhanxiong waved his hand, leaving Xiang Nan alone.After everyone had left, Xiang Zhanxiong lowered his voice and said, \" little Nan , your martial arts cultivation has improved by leaps and bounds recently. What exactly is going on?\"Xiang Nan knew that he couldn't conceal this matter, so he was mentally prepared and said, \"Grandfather, actually \u2026 someone secretly helped little Nan .\"\"Oh?\" Xiang Zhanxiong was shocked, \"So, that person secretly taught you cultivation techniques and taught you how to cultivate? Who is that person?\"Xiang Nan shook his head. \"It's an old senior, but little Nan doesn't know his name. He didn't take little Nan as his disciple.\"\"However, the old man said that he valued my talent. He wanted to nurture me first. If I had any future prospects, he would consider accepting me.\"Xiang Zhanxiong's face was filled with joy. He stroked his beard and smiled, \"The strength and combat skills you've displayed lately, even Grandpa is ashamed of being inferior to you. I guessed that there must be an expert behind you.\"\"Even so, you must cultivate diligently. Don't waste their goodwill.\"\" Little Nan understands,\" Xiang Nan said respectfully.Xiang Zhanxiong nodded and smiled, \"Don't bother about the family matters. Just focus on your cultivation. You must be selected in Martial City and hand in a satisfactory answer to that senior.\"\"Yes.\" Xiang Nan nodded in agreement.Early the next morning, Xiang Nan brought all the ingredients and pill furnaces with him and rushed to the back mountain to refine the Second Grade Stone Skin Pill.However, before that, he still sent a message to City Lord Hong Zhen, indicating the Xiang Clan's request for help.Signaling was an expensive means of communication. It was a type of token filled with Essence that could be sent directly to the City Lord's Mansion.Back mountain.Xiang Nan set up a pill furnace and placed all the spiritual herbs needed to refine the stone skin pill in front of it.Apothecary was an extremely noble profession in this world. Their martial arts might not be very strong, but their status was exceptionally high.Just like how an ordinary mortal would have money and status, one day you would ask for a doctor, and a martial artist would definitely ask for an alchemist.Pill concoction was a profound and unfathomable knowledge. This thing only depended on talent, not hard work.If you don't have talent, even if you work hard all your life, you definitely won't be able to become a beginner alchemist.In his previous life, Xiang Nan was a disciple candidate that countless alchemists wanted to frantically snatch. He had indeed learned some very high-end alchemy techniques, but he was more focused on martial arts.\"I've lost my five Heavenly Spiritual meridians. I wonder if I still have the talent to concoct pills in this life.\" Xiang Nan took three deep breaths in front of the furnace.To tell the truth, he really didn't know if he could refine pills in this life.The second-grade pill, the Stone Skin Pill, was complex as well as simple. It depended on who refined it.\"The ingredients are just superficial knowledge.\" Xiang Nan muttered to himself as he threw all kinds of spiritual herbs into the pill furnace.Then, he took a deep breath and the weather in his body flowed to his right hand, slapping the pill furnace's outer wall with his palm.The palm landed on the outer wall of the pill furnace, and the weather contained within it immediately poured into the pill furnace!Almost at the same time, a fire rose beneath the pill furnace!The temperature of the furnace quickly penetrated through the outer wall and entered the interior. The temperature was swept up by the previous weather and began to swim inside the pill furnace, preheating the spiritual herbs first.There were far too many things to consider for an alchemist in pill concoction.From the intensity of the fire, the speed of the fire, the timing of the furnace opening, to the alchemist's perception of the changes in the medicinal properties, every detail of the reaction of the spiritual herbs to the high temperature had to be taken into account.If he wanted to write out this knowledge, he was afraid that even a dozen or so thick books wouldn't be able to hold it.At this moment, Xiang Nan's expression became uglier and uglier.He possessed extremely strong control over the weather, and the accuracy of his strength could be said to be rare in the world.But the trouble is\"Damn it!\" Xiang Nan frowned and said, \"I can't feel the changes in the medicinal properties anymore!\"Wood talent was a great help in pill refinement. It allowed Xiang Nan to feel the changes in the temperature of every spiritual herb at any time.However, in this life, he had already lost the innate attributes of the five elements. Although the fire could be controlled to perfection, he was unable to sense the medicinal properties inside the spirit herbs, nor could he sense the changes in the temperature of the spirit herbs.Without this kind of perception, it would be foolish to refine pills.At this moment, Xiang Nan was able to control the fire, but he didn't know what was going on with those spirit herbs.\"No, continue to refine blindly. All the spiritual herbs will be destroyed.\" Sweat appeared on Xiang Nan's forehead. It wasn't a pity that the spiritual herbs had been destroyed. Unfortunately, he had lost his talent in pill refining.Just as he was about to give up helplessly, he suddenly had an idea. He suddenly converted the weather that swept the temperature of the furnace into thunder and lightning.The Divine Grade Lightning Meridian innate talent allowed Xiang Nan to control the lightning power with absolute precision!Thunder and lightning swept through the high temperature and quickly pierced through the spiritual herbs. In the next moment, a miracle occurred!Those thunder and lightning energy actually pierced through the spirit herbs, dialyzing the most basic components of the spirit herbs!Xiang Nan was shocked and said, \"This \u2026 I actually \u2026\"The power of thunder and lightning pierced through the spirit herbs, allowing Xiang Nan to understand the most detailed changes in the spirit herbs in his chest. The level of detail was even accurate to the molecular level!Not only did he not lose his talent in alchemy, he was even more powerful! His perception of the changes in spiritual herbs was simply unprecedented!Xiang Nan felt everything inside the pill furnace in disbelief. It was clear, thorough, accurate, and perfect!After the herbs were preheated, Xiang Nan immediately increased the power of lightning and tempered the furnace fire to a higher temperature!An hour later, Xiang Nan slammed his palm heavily on the outer wall of the furnace, and the top of the furnace instantly opened.Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swooshThree yellow pills were rolling in his palm, and Xiang Nan sucked in a breath of cold air.The Second Grade Stone Skin Pill had succeeded, but it didn't waste the slightest bit of medicinal power. It had been refined into three pills!Each grade of medicinal pill was divided into four grades, namely, low-grade, intermediate-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.As for the second-grade Stone Skin Pills that Xiang Nan refined, they were all top-grade second-grade pills, top-grade second-grade pills!Liked it?

It turned out that his Lightning Meridian talent was so heaven-defying! No wonder Lightning Meridian martial artists were so rare from ancient times until now.And this heaven-defying talent could also bring him such tremendous help in the path of pill refining!In other words, according to his previous thoughts, if he used himself as a pill to refine his body, wouldn't the success rate be even higher?\"Since that's the case \u2026\" He put the three Stone Skin Pills into his storage ring and nodded. \"The only ingredients I need for body refinement are the Thunderbolt Vines.\"It seemed that his bold idea could be realized, and Xiang Nan immediately felt very happy.However, where would he find something like the Thunderclap Vine?This stunned Xiang Nan. He was not familiar with the abundant spiritual herbs within the Bluestone City.\"Right.\" He patted his forehead and said, \"I can ask the City Lord. He is in charge of Blue Stone City.\"Thinking of this, Xiang Nan immediately set off towards Bluestone City.To enter the City Lord's Mansion, one had to cross a busy trade street called Welcome Street.This was because merchants and martial artists traveling from south to north would sell their goods here, making this street a must for all families.Back then, the Xiang Clan had four shops on this street, including two weapons shops, an armor shop, and a spirit herb shop.\"Right \u2026\" Xiang Nan walked down the street and thought to himself, \"Grandpa and the others want to buy back a few shops. It seems that they are here. I wonder if they have succeeded.\"Since I\u2019m here, I'll go take a look.After advancing for a while, Xiang Nan arrived at a spirit herb shop. This place used to belong to the Xiang Clan, but Xiang Nan looked inside from the door and saw a round table in the shop.Sitting around the round table was the shopkeeper of the Spirit Herb Shop. On the other two sides were his father and two uncles.Xiang Nan walked in and sat down beside his father. However, he saw that his father's expression was extremely ugly. It seemed that the conversation was not going very smoothly.\"Aren't you asking a sky-high price!\" Xiang Shaohua's face turned ashen as he angrily said to the shopkeeper, \"Back then, we only sold this shop to you for 70,000 gold coins, but now you're asking for 500,000 gold coins!\"The shopkeeper's expression did not change. He glanced at Xiang Shaohua indifferently, \"Today is different from the past. The new city district is about to open. This Welcome Street is also inch by inch. As the water rises, the boat will naturally be much more expensive than before.\"\"Furthermore, if it weren't for the City Lord helping your Xiang Clan, I wouldn't even have sold it to you.\"\"Shao Hua, what do you think we should do?\" One of Xiang Nan's uncles turned to look at Xiang Shaohua.Xiang Shaohua struggled in his heart for a long time before he let out a sigh and said, \"500,000 yuan is 500,000 yuan. I want this shop.\"\"Since that's the case\" The shopkeeper revealed a smile. Just as he spoke, he was interrupted by a very ear-piercing voice.\"Wait!\" Two people suddenly appeared in front of the shop. They were Wang Rongsheng of the Wang Clan and a woman around the age of eighteen or nineteen.When Xiang Nan saw the Wang Clan appear, he immediately frowned. He knew that the Wang Clan had indeed come looking for trouble again.Wang Rongsheng strode into the shop and sat down directly opposite the shopkeeper. He smiled and said, \"Our Wang Clan has offered 550,000 yuan to buy this shop.\"When the shopkeeper heard this, he immediately waved his hand at Xiang Shaohua and said, \"Sorry, someone is bidding higher than you.\"Xiang Shaohua glared at Wang Rongsheng and said, \"Our Xiang Clan asked the City Lord for help, so the shopkeeper was willing to sell this shop! Otherwise, the shopkeeper wouldn't sell it at all.\"Wang Rongsheng didn't care at all. He said, \"Of course, the highest bidder will get the goods. Our Wang Clan is bidding higher than yours. This shop will naturally belong to our Wang Clan.\"The shopkeeper smiled and nodded, \"Brother Wang is right.\"When Xiang Shaohua heard this, he could only ruthlessly say, \"Then our Xiang Clan will pay 570,000 yuan!\"\"Too stingy.\" Wang Rongsheng mockingly said, \"Our Wang Clan will pay 600,000 yuan.\"\"You\" Xiang Shaohua pointed at Wang Rongsheng, speechless.\"What happened to me?\" Wang Rongsheng crossed his legs and sneered, \"I can tell you that none of the four shops of your Xiang Clan will be taken back!\"At this moment, a group of people arrived at the entrance, but they were the three elders of the Xiang Clan.Xiang Shaohua hurriedly stood up and said, \"Big Uncle, Third Uncle, Fourth Uncle, how are things over there?\"The faces of the three elders were extremely ugly. It was obvious that they were angry. The Great Elder gritted his teeth and said, \"The other three shops were messed up by the Wang Clan's Li Clan and the Mo Clan. We were unable to take them down.\"Hearing this, Xiang Shaohua sat down and his heart went cold.Wang Li Mo and the other three families worked together to deal with the Xiang Family. Even if Xiang Shaohua was willing to spend more money to buy it, how could he withstand the financial resources of the three families?Xiang Nan had been sitting on the side and listening. When things got to this point, Xiang Nan's heart was filled with anger.\"Father.\" Xiang Nan stood up and whispered, \"It's better for us to go back and discuss the matter of buying a shop before making a decision.\"Xiang Nan was very clear in his heart that this matter had already reached a dead end. He had to rely on the help of outsiders to coordinate it. Perhaps he could talk to the City Lord.Xiang Shaohua was helpless and could only sigh as he walked out of the shop.\"You \u2026 are Xiang Nan?\" At this time, the Wang family in the shop followed. The woman who had always been standing beside Wang Rongsheng asked.Xiang Nan turned around to look at her and saw that she was eighteen or nineteen years old and pretty. What was even more rare was that she had reached the eighth level of the Xiantian realm!\"I've heard of you.\" The woman smiled faintly and extended her right hand to Xiang Nan. \"I heard that you shouldered the heavy burden of the Xiang Clan by yourself. I admire your character very much,\" she said.\"My name is Wang Jingyun. We will meet in the city selection in a month. I hope you can perform better then.\"Xiang Nan hesitated for a moment, but he still held Wang Jingyun's hand together. This Wang Jingyun was not as arrogant and domineering as Wang Jinghai, so it seemed to be easy to accept.At this moment, a muffled bang suddenly came from the side, followed by a miserable scream.A figure suddenly flew backwards from outside and landed at Xiang Nan's feet.Xiang Nan stared intently at the man lying under his feet who was seriously injured and vomiting blood. He was actually the grandson of the First Elder, Xiang Zhonghua!\"Zhong Hua!\" The Great Elder was shocked and hurriedly wanted to help Xiang Zhonghua.Xiang Nan pulled Xiang Zhonghua up and frowned, \"Cousin, how are you?\"Before Xiang Nan could finish his words, a ray of early weather suddenly shot towards him from the crack in the crowd. The target of the early weather was Xiang Zhonghua!Xiang Nan was instantly enraged. Who rewarded Xiang Zhonghua? That person was unexpectedly unforgiving, and he was actually still chasing after them!At this critical moment, Xiang Nan raised his hand and slapped the weather away!Suddenly, a cold breath sounded from the crowd.That was the first day! He was actually sent flying by Xiang Nan's slap?Xiang Nan looked in the direction of the weather and saw Wang Jinghai!\"You\" Wang Jinghai was still smiling sinisterly, but his face was already pale. He pointed at Xiang Nan and said, \"When did you reach the third level of the Xiantian realm?\"\"Wang! Jing! Hai!\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and raised his hand.This weather was not a joke. When Xiang Nan was at Xiantian 1st layer, he could easily defeat Wang Jinghai. Now, Xiang Nan was already a Xiantian 3rd layer martial artist.Wang Jinghai could definitely break a few of his ribs in this weather.Liked it?

Quickly save me!\"Almost at the same time, Wang Jingyun suddenly made a move. She raised her hand and waved it. A strong Xiantian gathered on her palm, sending the Xiantian that Xiang Nan had attacked flying away.Xiang Nan did not hesitate at all. When Wang Jingyun sent her flying, he had already rushed out.Xiang Nan's figure circled around Wang Jingyun and punched Wang Jinghai in the chest.\"Xiang Nan, stop!\" Wang Jingyun frowned and grabbed Xiang Nan's wrist. Moreover, she used the Xiantian eighth layer of Xiantian Qi in her hand. The strength of her hand was astonishing.She was sure that Xiang Nan could not break free from her wrist, so she opened her mouth to speak.Clinker, Xiang Nan secretly converted his previous weather into lightning power, and its power instantly doubled to a total of 4,600 jin!Wang Jingyun's expression changed. She shook her wrist and whispered, \"Capture the Snake Hand!\"At that moment, the Xiantian that Wang Jingyun had attached to her hand suddenly turned into a ferocious python, tightly gripping Xiang Nan's wrist.Xiang Nan's explosive power doubled, but he was unable to break free!One had to know that the strength of a Xiantian realm martial artist could no longer be measured solely by strength.Xiantian could indeed strengthen a martial artist's own strength, but not only did it exist to increase one's strength, it also had an even more important role to play, and that was to activate a martial skill!Her eighth level Xiantian realm allowed her to use even more Xiantian Qi at once! As for the so-called Snake Capturing Hand, it was clearly a high-grade Spiritual Grade martial skill.At this moment, Xiang Nan only had one trump card of the Thunder Clap Martial Skill. He couldn't use it casually, so he couldn't compete with Wang Jingyun in terms of martial skills.He could only clench his teeth and expend a lot of energy to triple his strength.This time, Xiang Nan's strength soared to 6,900 jin!Even though Wang Jingyun had forcefully sealed off Xiang Nan's strength with her powerful martial skill, it wasn't enough to lock down nearly 7,000 jin of strength.Xiang Nan shook his wrist and directly pushed away Wang Jingyun's right hand. Then, he slapped Wang Jinghai with his palm.Wang Jinghai had already begun to flee, but Xiang Nan and Wang Jingyun had fought too quickly, allowing Wang Jinghai only five or six steps away.Xiang Nan slid over and saw that his palm was about to be imprinted on Wang Jinghai's back, and the annoying Wang Jingyun caught up with him again. She grabbed Xiang Nan's arm.This pull of hers pulled Xiang Nan's strength back a lot. Unfortunately, she took action a little later than Xiang Nan, and Xiang Nan's palm was still on Wang Jinghai's back.\"Pu!\" Wang Jinghai spat out a mouthful of blood and flew out.\"Xiang Nan, you!\" Wang Jingyun's eyes turned red with anger. She pointed at Xiang Nan's nose and angrily said, \"I thought you were a responsible man, but who would have thought you would be so aggressive!\"\"I've put aside my family feud and admired you. I really saw the wrong person!\"Xiang Nan's eyes gradually narrowed as he said in a deep voice, \"It was clearly Wang Jinghai who injured my cousin first, but I can only be considered as avenging my cousin.\"\"Wang Jingyun, could it be that only your Wang Clan can injure others? Our Xiang Clan's counterattack has become aggressive?\"Wang Jingyun blushed angrily and shouted, \"You really have sharp teeth and sharp tongue. A grown man's mouth is so sharp, it's too narrow-bellied!\"Xiang Nan frowned deeply. Don't tell me I can't explain your slander of me for being aggressive?However, Xiang Nan did not say anything further. Since the Dao was different, then he did not conspire.This time, Xiang Nan's only good impression of Wang Jingyun was also destroyed.\" Little Nan \" Behind him, Xiang Zhonghua grabbed Xiang Nan's shoulder. He gave Xiang Nan a grateful look and sincerely said, \"Thank you.\"Xiang Nan nodded. Although he had a conflict with Xiang Zhonghua in the family, he could not allow outsiders to bully the Xiang family.At this moment, another group of people walked in from outside the crowd. They were all men and women of eighteen or nineteen years of age.Upon seeing these people, Xiang Nan's heart skipped a beat. Xiang Nan had heard of two of the leaders among them.One was Li Qingchuan from the Li Clan, and the other was Mo Hai from the Mo Clan!Li Qingchuan was skinny and had a hook nose. He looked unfriendly and was a Xiantian eighth layer expert.Mo Hai was even more powerful. He was tall and sturdy, two meters tall. Behind him was a broadsword. He was known as the number one expert of his age in the six towns! With the strength of the late Xiantian ninth layer, half of his foot had already stepped into the Origin Realm.It could even be said that Mo Hai was already able to walk horizontally in Bluestone City, and no one dared to provoke him.These people were all young martial artists who were two to three years older than Xiang Nan, and they were also the top experts who were about to participate in the selection of Martial Dao City.Mo Hai's nose was wide and his mouth looked extremely calm. He smiled at Wang Jingyun and said, \"Xiaoyun, is there someone looking for trouble with you?\"This person's tone was full of anger, which meant that his previous weather was very rich.Wang Jingyun's pair of heroes were crimson and her face was shy. It seemed that her personal relationship with Mo Hai was extraordinary.\"Sister-in-law, just say that Brother Hai will help you out.\" Li Qingchuan laughed.Wang Jingyun's face turned even redder as she spat, \"Don't talk nonsense.\"Mo Hai was very infatuated with Wang Jingyun's expression. He smiled gently and said, \"It's fine. With me here, no one dares to look for your misfortune.\"\"Is it him?\" Li Qingchuan dug his ears and casually pointed at Xiang Nan's nose.Wang Jingyun looked at Xiang Nan with a complicated expression and hesitated, \"Actually, both of us \u2026\"\"Then he's right.\" Li Qingchuan didn't even wait for Wang Jingyun to finish her sentence. He directly pulled out a long sword and slashed at Xiang Nan!This Li Qingchuan possessed the strength of the eighth level of the Xiantian realm. His sword strike actually slashed out a terrifying sword qi that was more than five meters long!When Xiang Nan saw the sword qi, his heart sank. He immediately condensed three times the explosive force and punched out. At the same time, his body quickly jumped to the left.Xiang Nan's Xiantian condensed into the shape of a fist, carrying 6,000 kilograms of power as it collided with Li Qingchuan's sword qi.However, Xiang Nan's previous weather was cut open by Li Qingchuan's sword qi on the spot! As a result, the sword qi weakened more than half of its power, but it still flew out and fiercely sliced into the ground five to six meters away.The ground was instantly cut open by a deep crack!Xiang Nan's expression was solemn. He did not have any weapons in his hands, so it was very difficult to fight Li Qingchuan.Although Xiang Nan's strength erupted, it was like throwing a tree weighing several hundred jin at a sharp sword that weighed only ten jin.Although the sharp sword was light, it could easily cut through trees.However, the expressions of Mo Hai and Li Qingchuan also changed slightly. Mo Hai said in a deep voice, \"A Xiantian third layer kid can actually dodge Qing Chuan's sword strike?\"Li Qingchuan chuckled at Xiang Nan, \"Alright, kid, I heard that you are at the top of your class. From the looks of it, are you showing your pride?\"\"Today, as a senior, I will teach you a good lesson so that you do not know the heavens and earth!\"Liked it?

Wang Jingyun was also very clear about this sword incident.However, Wang Jingyun only watched the battle with a complicated expression and did not say anything to stop Li Qingchuan, an older man, from attacking Xiang Nan, a younger teenager.This made Xiang Nan couldn't help but sigh in his heart. He thought to himself, I thought that Wang Jingyun would be different from others. In the end, she was just a nest of snakes and rats.Li Qingchuan laughed loudly, \"Brat, let's see how arrogant you are this time!\"With that, Li Qingchuan wielded his sword and slashed towards Xiang Nan. This sword qi was sharp and harsh, accompanied by the ear-piercing sound of the wind.\"It's even more powerful than the sword qi just now!\" Xiang Nan's pupils constricted, injecting the first weather into his feet. The first weather erupted, pushing his body to the side quickly.The sword thrilled Xiang Nan's right arm and cut off a small piece of Xiang Nan's sleeve.Li Qingchuan followed closely behind and jumped up. The longsword in his hand fell from top to bottom, and he shouted, \"Flying Cloud Slash!\"This Flying Cloud Slash was extremely powerful! Li Qingchuan instantly struck out with two swords. The two strands of sword qi suddenly fused in midair, turning into an even more violent and gigantic sword qi!Two five-meter-tall sword Qi merged together to form an eight-meter-tall sword Qi. Its power was simply unparalleled!Xiang Nan had just dodged a sword strike when this even greater sword qi shot towards him!\"He can't dodge.\" Mo Hai hugged his shoulders and said confidently.Wang Jingyun's expression suddenly changed. She said in shock, \"Qing Chuan can't kill! He, Xiang Nan, is going to participate in the city selection.\"However, it was already too late for her to say those words.Everyone thought that Xiang Nan was going to be hit by the sword qi, and even if he didn't die, he would still have to cut off an arm.As Xiang Nan was in a hurry, he instantly converted the Xiantian Qi in his body into thunder and lightning. Furthermore, the thunder and lightning were white!He used the power of the White Flame Lightning to condense the power of the White Flame Lightning under his feet and kicked it on the bluestone road.He saw that the bluestone pavement was stepped on with a muffled boom, and it sunk into a crater that was nearly a meter in diameter. As for Xiang Nan, due to the terrifying backlash, he directly turned into an afterimage and disappeared on the spot with a whoosh!\"He's dodging!\" The faces of everyone present changed drastically.Mo Hai and Li Qingchuan exchanged a glance, and none of them dared to believe what they saw.\"There he is!\" Mo Hai's eyes were sharp, and his gaze suddenly looked up high.Everyone hurriedly chased after him, only to see Xiang Nan standing on the roof of a two-story restaurant.\"So fast!\" Wang Jingyun covered her mouth in disbelief. Just now, Xiang Nan's speed was actually unable to catch even a Xiantian eighth layer expert like her!On the roof, Xiang Nan's expression wasn't good, because he had no choice but to use the power of the White Flame Lightning Flame. The power of the Lightning Flame couldn't be regenerated! He had absorbed a bolt of lightning, but he had only absorbed twenty to thirty percent of it. It could be said that he had used a little less.At this moment, there was only eighty percent of the precious lightning power left in Xiang Nan's body.\"Sigh\" Xiang Nan sighed in his heart. If he could absorb the lightning source of the lightning, then the power of the lightning would be endless.\"This kid is very evil.\" Li Qingchuan gritted his teeth, killing intent flashing in his eyes.Previously, Li Qingchuan only wanted to teach Xiang Nan a lesson, but now that he saw Xiang Nan's strength, he knew that Xiang Nan was not allowed to stay!\"I told you to run!\" Li Qingchuan pulled out his sword and chopped down, \"Flying Cloud Slash!\"The veins on Xiang Nan's forehead bulged, could it be that he was still wasting the power of lightning to dodge? If he didn't use the power of lightning, he would have been hacked to death!\"Young Master Xiang, take the knife!\"At this critical moment, just as Li Qingchuan was about to draw his sword, a resplendent voice like a river of stars rang out on the spot.It was the mysterious woman from the auction house!The woman had already stood behind the crowd and watched the battle. At this moment, it was also her who tossed the strange black blade of the auction house towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan originally did not intend to interact with this mysterious woman too much, but at this moment, he could not choose.He could only take the mysterious black saber and merge the power of thunder and lightning into the saber without any hesitation, hacking down on Li Qingchuan's sword qi.With the weapon, Xiang Nan was unwilling to waste the power of lightning. He only used the power of ordinary lightning to counterattack. At the same time, he wanted to see how powerful this black blade was.What happened next was something that Xiang Nan hadn't expected.When the black saber came into contact with the power of thunder and lightning, its grade had actually risen by leaps and bounds!It was originally a low-grade Mortal grade trash weapon, but with the infusion of thunder and lightning, its grade had soared to the middle-grade Mortal grade.No, it's still improving!High-grade Mortal Realm! Lower Spirit Stage! Intermediate Spirit Stage! High-grade Spirit Stage!\"Good \u2026 so fast!\" Xiang Nan was greatly shocked. This black saber had actually risen to a high-grade Spirit Grade within a single thought!As for the saber Qi that he had sliced down, the surface of the saber Qi was covered with tiny electric currents that were hard to see with the naked eye!In midair, Xiang Nan's saber qi collided with Li Qingchuan's sword qi.With a loud explosion, waves of energy spread out in all directions, causing everyone watching the battle below to be blown into beard dancing wildly.As for the saber qi and sword qi, they actually cancelled each other out!\"This\" Li Qingchuan was dumbfounded. The Flying Cloud Slash he used was a martial skill! That Xiang Nan only used his pure Yuan Qi to slash out, yet he was actually able to cancel out his own Sword Qi?Everyone was shocked beyond words, but their gazes fell on Xiang Nan's black saber. Obviously, everyone thought that it was the black saber that played an inconceivable role, not Xiang Nan's own strength.Even the majority of the people present revealed unreserved greed towards the black saber.Xiang Nan was the only one who didn't immediately appreciate the black saber. Instead, he looked at the mysterious woman in shock.Something's wrong! Something's wrong! This saber could actually be upgraded with the power of thunder and lightning? In other words, this saber \u2026 could test out the Lightning Meridian talent!At that moment, Xiang Nan felt his heart sink!Not good, exposed!Sure enough, the mysterious woman's face was also filled with shock, but her beautiful eyes bloomed with excitement that Xiang Nan could not understand!Li Qingchuan gritted his teeth and said, \"Good boy, have you obtained a precious weapon? My Flying Cloud Slash can't deal with you anymore?\"\"Alright, then let me use a stronger martial skill to experience the power of your weapon.\"After saying that, Li Qingchuan raised his sword, and then his arm suddenly trembled! He saw the Xiantian Qi rolling towards his wrist in waves on his right arm.Buzz buzzThe sword in Li Qingchuan's hand started to roar under the pulsation of the wave-shaped Yuan Qi, and the brightness of the sword became more and more intense.\"Wind meridian talent?\" Xiang Nan frowned. It turned out that Li Qingchuan possessed the talent of a Mortal Grade Wind Meridian. No wonder his sword qi was so fierce.However, it also reflected how domineering Xiang Nan's Divine Grade Lightning Veins were!It was precisely because of this heaven-defying innate level of divine grade that Xiang Nan was able to cross five small realms and use pure Yuan Qi attacks to counteract Li Qingchuan's Flying Cloud Slash Martial Technique.\"Stop!\" At this moment, a loud explosive shout sounded.Liked it?

Why are you fighting here?\"\"This\" Wang Jingyun's expression was ugly. She knew that Wang Jinghai had provoked this matter, so she feared that the City Lord would hold her accountable if she told Wang Jinghai about it.Mo Hai, on the other hand, hugged his shoulders. He glanced at Xiang Nan and said, \"You have to seek the protection of the City Lord in everything. Xiang Nan, is that all you have?\"\"Yes.\" Li Qingchuan was furious and said angrily, \"Relying on the fact that you are a famous person in front of the City Lord, is this the capital of your arrogance?\"\"Haha, I've let you guys finish your sentence.\" Xiang Nan held the black saber in his hand and jumped off the roof of the restaurant, landing steadily on the ground.Hong Zhen knew that today was the day the Xiang Clan purchased the shop. He was entrusted by Xiang Nan to come here to take a look at the situation.However, now that he saw that the people from the three great clans were all here, the City Lord had an idea. He looked at the shopkeeper and asked, \"Shopkeeper Zhao, didn't you agree to transfer the shop to the Xiang Clan?\"Shopkeeper Zhao smiled respectfully, \"That's right, but there are people who bid even higher. There's no reason why we shouldn't choose a buyer with a higher price, right?\"At this moment, Wang Rongsheng stood up and said, \"Lord City Lord, although you are in charge of Blue Stone City, you have no reason to force us traders to do business, right?\"City Lord Hong Zhen was also in trouble. He really wanted to help Xiang Nan, but he could only persuade Shopkeeper Zhao. He could not order anyone to sell the shop to him.Thus, the three great clans all sneered at the Xiang Clan, as if saying that we have many methods to kill your Xiang Clan.As for the mysterious woman in the crowd, she walked out leisurely. Her beautiful eyes raised her long eyelashes and her gaze landed on Xiang Nan, \"Oh? Is Young Master Xiang going to buy this shop?\"Everyone looked at the mysterious woman, but seeing that she was wearing a black veil, they could not see her appearance clearly. However, based on her pair of soul-stirring eyes, they could guess that her appearance must have fallen from grace.Xiang Nan didn't really want to provoke this woman, so he casually let out an oh, as if he was dealing with it.Who knew, the woman laughed, \"Shopkeeper Zhao.\"The shopkeeper surnamed Zhao's expression suddenly changed. He respectfully came to the woman's side, and there was a detail that attracted everyone's attention.Shopkeeper Zhao deliberately lagged behind the woman by half a step. Moreover, his body was slightly bent, completely like a servant standing beside his master.The woman smiled and said, \"Young Master Xiang, how many shops do you want?\"Shopkeeper Zhao said, \"As far as I know, the Xiang Clan intends to take back a total of four rooms.\"The woman nodded, \"Then these four shops are all free to the Xiang Clan. I remember that we should have eight other shops on this street, right? Give Young Master Xiang two more.\"Shopkeeper Zhao bowed deeply, \"I'll listen to your orders.\"Hearing this, everyone was stunned.A total of \u2026 six shops, free gifts to the Xiang Clan? Who was this woman?The Xiang Clan's side is where you look at me and I look at you. They won't be able to react in a short period of time.Xiang Nan frowned even deeper. He wanted to reject the woman's kindness, but when he saw his father's eager gaze, he hesitated in his heart.He thought of his father, his mother, and his grandfather, who had been guarding the Xiang Clan, and sighed in his heart.Forget it, since I was reborn in the Xiang Clan and took over Xiang Nan's body, I can't think of everything for myself.With that in mind, Xiang Nan could only clasp his fists at the mysterious woman and say, \"Thank you.\"The woman smiled elegantly, \"It's just a small matter. It's not worth mentioning. It's also my honor to be able to help Young Master Xiang.\"\"Great, this is really great!\" The three elders of the Xiang Clan didn't react until this time, and they were all so excited that they couldn't help but feel uncontrollably excited.The people from the other three great clans suffered a huge loss here in Xiang Nan, losing face once again. They were so angry that they almost knew nothing about it.Wang Rongsheng hit a nail on the back of Xiang Nan several times. He was so angry that he angrily said to the woman, \"We have already agreed with Manager Zhao. You said that we would give it to the Xiang family?\"Hearing this, even Xiang Nan couldn't help but roll his eyes. He thought to himself, Wang Rongsheng, are you really old and foolish?As a result, the mysterious woman who had always been smiling suddenly turned cold. Her beautiful eyes narrowed as she looked at Wang Ronghua and said, \"I asked you a question? Our own shop, I can do whatever I want. It's your turn to talk more.\"As she spoke, a wisp of frost flashed across the woman's eyes.This gaze made Wang Rongsheng suddenly feel as if he had fallen into an ice cave in the summer! A chill rose from the soles of his feet and rushed straight to the top of his head.Xiang Nan was increasingly unable to see through the mysterious woman. When she smiled, it was like spring breeze, but when it was cold, it was like a sharp blade that scratched bones.The three great clans knew that if they stayed, they would be even more humiliated, so they hurriedly left.City Lord Hong Zhen took a deep look at the mysterious woman and then laughed loudly, \"Since the deal has been reached, let's get close. How about setting a table at the Drunken Immortal Building to celebrate?\"\"Yes, yes. I'll be the east. little Nan , you can take care of the City Lord and this girl.\" Xiang Shaohua hurriedly smiled.The mysterious woman shook her head. Just now, Leng Ruohuang's face became friendly again. She pointed to the Drunken Immortal Building beside her and said, \"I want to talk to Young Master Xiang alone. Young Master Xiang, I'll go up first.\"After saying that, she turned around and went upstairs.Leave everyone to look at me, I look at you, I just feel that this woman's behavior is strange, difficult to understand.Xiang Shaohua hurriedly asked, \" little Nan , what is the background of this girl? How can she be willing to give the six shops to my Xiang family for nothing?\"Xiang Nan shook his head and said, \"Father, go sign the deed contract with the three elders. I'll go see her.\"\"Good, good. You must thank her.\" Xiang Shaohua expected that a woman's status was noble, so she didn't ask too much.After the Xiang family left, Xiang Nan asked the City Lord, \"Lord Hong Zhen, do you know the identity of this woman?\"Hong Zhen stroked his beard and shook his head, \"I only know that she is a big shot behind the scenes of the Treasure Gathering Pavilion. I don't know her exact identity, and this is the second time I've seen her.\"\"Xiang Nan, that woman's background is unknown. You must treat her with caution.\"\"Understood.\" After sending the City Lord off, Xiang Nan took a deep breath and stepped into the Drunken Immortal Building.Since that woman might know his thunder meridian talent, he should go meet her and see what her purpose was.On the second floor of the Drunken Immortal Building, near the window.The mysterious woman was already sitting at the table. The table was filled with rich dishes.She gracefully stood up and waved at Xiang Nan, \"Young Master Xiang, please sit down.\"Xiang Nan pulled out his chair and handed the black knife over, \"Your knife.\"The woman looked at Xiang Nan with a faint smile and did not receive the knife.Liked it?

However, you won't receive any rewards \u2026\"\"What?\" The woman interrupted Xiang Nan and raised her eyebrows. \"You've taken all six shops. You already owe me a favor. Do you still need this knife?\"Xiang Nan really couldn't see through her, so he could only put the black saber aside and sat down to pick up his glass. \"Since that's the case, I won't be a mother-in-law. Thank you for your help.\"The woman picked up the wine glass, but did not put it into her mouth. Instead, she slightly moved her red lips behind the black gauze. The wine in the glass turned into a thin water rope, which unexpectedly circled the gap in the black gauze and directly sucked it into her mouth.\"I admire you.\" Xiang Nan nodded and drank all the wine in his cup.The woman held her cheek with one hand and looked at Xiang Nan with a smile that was not a smile.Xiang Nan could not stand the look in her eyes and said somewhat embarrassedly, \"Why are you helping me like this?\"The woman gently waved her hand and said, \"There's no need to talk about a few shops. It's just a matter of a few small coins. This saber is a gift to a hero from a treasured saber, not to mention that it can't play any role in my hands.\"Xiang Nan's spirits instantly rose. The second half of the woman's words were true.The woman picked up a piece of vegetable and put it into Xiang Nan's bowl. Her voice was hoarse and sexy, \"Honestly, I have something to ask. I've been searching all over the world these past few years, and I just want to find someone who possesses the talent of lightning veins.\"\"Haha.\" Xiang Nan stood up, cupped his fists and cupped his hands. \"Thank you for your help, but you've found the wrong person. Goodbye.\"With that, Xiang Nan turned around and left without even taking the black saber.He knew very well that an ordinary man was innocent of his sins. If news of his lightning meridian talent were to spread, many people would want to kill him.After returning to the Xiang manor, Xiang Nan thought for a while and sent a message to the City Lord asking about the Thunderbolt Vine.This was because it was impossible to raise one's cultivation to the seventh or eighth level of the Xiantian Realm in just a month. It was impossible to rely solely on medicinal pills, and one could only rely on the heaven-defying Nine Transformations of Thunder.Today, he had fought with Li Qingchuan and already knew that Li Qingchuan's strength was unfathomable, and that Mo Hai could only be stronger than Li Qingchuan!He urgently needed to raise his cultivation level, otherwise, he would definitely suffer a great loss in the city selection.It didn't take long for the City Lord's message to return to Xiang Nan, and he told him that the Thunderbolt Vine could only appear in the depths of the Black Sharp Demon Forest, and repeatedly advised Xiang Nan not to blindly enter.\"Black Sharp Demonic Forest?\" Xiang Nan muttered to himself as he went to the Clan Book Collection Pavilion to find information about the Black Sharp Demon Forest.The Black Sharp Demon Forest was located in the northwest of the Black Sharp Mountain Range. It was a dangerous area filled with demonic beasts. Many merchants and martial artists who had come to Blue Stone City from the north and south of the world were also aiming for the Black Sharp Demon Forest.The Black Sharp Demon Forest was rich in demonic energy. It was rich in grade one to two spirit herbs, but at the same time, there would also be powerful demonic beasts roaming around.Especially at the core of the Black Sharp Demonic Forest, there were even more terrifying Heavenly Yuan Realm demonic beasts! With the strength of a city lord, even a person like him wouldn't be able to easily penetrate into it.\"Heaven Origin Realm\" Xiang Nan rubbed his temples as he struggled in his heart.As a Xiantian realm martial artist, not to mention meeting a Heaven Origin realm demonic beast, even meeting a Returning Origin realm demonic beast would be a dead end.However, he urgently needed a second-grade Thunderbolt Vine, so he didn't need to go into a tiger's den to gain anything.\"I may not be that unlucky. I will really encounter a Heavenly Yuan Realm demonic beast.\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and the ruthlessness in his heart rose again. \"At most, just do some disguise.\"Xiang Nan immediately went to Bluestone City to buy a variety of common herbs and even some fur from wild beasts.After buying what he wanted, it was already late at night. He took advantage of the night to rush to the Black Sharp Mountain Range.It was dawn in the depths of the Black Sharp Mountain Range.At the edge of the Black Sharp Demon Forest, Xiang Nan took out all the materials he had purchased and said, \"Most demonic beasts come out in the daytime and hide in the night. I will be more confident if I take advantage of the dawn to enter.\"He simply mixed the herbs he had bought with the fur of the wild beast, crushed them into powder with Yuan Qi, poured water into them, mixed them into mud, and stripped off his clothes and smeared the mud all over his body.This mud could hide the scent of humans to the maximum extent possible. At the same time, the reason why herbs were chosen instead of spirit herbs was because spirit herbs were too spiritual and easily attracted the attention of demonic beasts.After making all the necessary preparations, Xiang Nan nodded his head in satisfaction. He bent his body slightly and shot into the Demon Forest with a whoosh.At this moment, his entire body was smeared with mud, leaving only the parts of his eyes and nostrils behind. In addition to his swift and agile figure, he jumped back and forth between the trees like a vigorous night leopard.But gradually, as he went deeper and deeper into the demonic forest, he felt an increasingly dense demonic aura.Demonic Qi was the unique Spiritual Energy fluctuation on the body of a demonic beast. It was equivalent to the primordial weather and Yuan Qi of a human martial artist.Normally speaking, demonic energy was invisible to the naked eye, and could only be seen when one's body entered a place filled with demonic energy.However, in the process, Xiang Nan discovered another benefit of the Lightning Meridian Innate.He injected the power of lightning into his eyes, and an unusual bolt of lightning flashed through his pupils. At this moment, he actually saw a substantial demonic aura!Wherever he could see, the entire forest was filled with a pale gray mist. The mist slowly rose, causing the surrounding scenery to become somewhat dazed, as if it was a hot day when he saw the airflow surging on the bluestone road.This was the first time Xiang Nan had seen such a scene, and he couldn't help but feel shocked.\"So the Lightning Meridian talent can still see this kind of thing! Hmm? The demonic aura there seems to be a little more dense.\"Xiang Nan suddenly discovered that the demonic aura in the demonic forest was different in color. Some places were very light in color, while others were slightly denser.\"Understood\" Xiang Nan nodded excitedly. \"Where the demonic energy is dense, there must be high-level demonic beasts hibernating and circling around.\"With the ability to spy on demonic energy, Xiang Nan was like a tiger adding wings. He walked around the dense demonic energy area without disturbing any high-level demonic beasts along the way.However, as he approached the Black Sharp Demon Forest's core region, the situation became somewhat complicated.Although he could see a substantial amount of demonic energy, the demonic energy in the core region was dark gray! There was no way around it.Xiang Nan's pace slowed down, his expression slightly hesitant.\"Is there no other way?\"Suddenly, Xiang Nan heard a hoarse but gentle voice.\"You?\" Xiang Nan suddenly turned around and recognized the owner of the voice.Sure enough, on a tree behind him, the mysterious woman was looking at him gracefully.And in her right hand, she was still pulling the cute little girl.Liked it?

He was too careless! He didn't even realize that there was someone following behind him.The woman seemed to be able to see through Xiang Nan's thoughts. She chuckled and said, \"The difference between our realms is too great. You won't be able to detect my existence.\"The little girl beside him blinked her big eyes and pouted, \"Big sister, I want to eat sweet fruit.\"The woman dotted on the little girl's head and said, \"Yu'er, be good. You can't eat any more sweet fruits today. Be obedient.\"The little girl said angrily, \"In the past, I could still eat three pills a day, but now I'm only allowed to eat one. Big sister, am I going to die?\"The woman hurriedly covered the little girl's mouth with her fingers and crouched down to whisper, \"Yu'er will not die. Big sister promises Yu'er!\"\"When Yu'er recovers from her illness, elder sister will definitely let Yu'er eat sweet fruits every day, ten a day, alright?\"When she said this, although the woman was smiling, her eyes were red.The little girl finally laughed happily, \"Sister, don't lie to Yu'er. Eat ten a day. You can't go back on your word.\"The woman hugged the little girl tightly and said, \"Never go back on her word. Even if elder sister doesn't want this life, she still wants to let Yu'er live a good life.\"\"Sister \u2026 I can't breathe because of your hug.\" Little Yu'er pushed the woman with difficulty.Below, Xiang Nan heard the conversation between the two sisters. He looked at Little Yu'er in surprise and felt a little sour in his heart.Was such a young child suffering from an incurable disease?The woman pulled Little Yu'er's hand and gently descended from the tree. She walked to Xiang Nan's side and said, \"To enter the core of the Demon Forest, a detour alone will not work.\"\"I can help you.\" As she spoke, the woman took out a small light green porcelain bottle from her storage ring.She pulled out the porcelain bottle, and an unpleasant stench came out from it. Then, she took a deep breath and spat it out.Xiang Nan saw that Qi clearly. It was definitely Yuan Qi! Moreover, it was not an ordinary level of Yuan Qi.The Yuan Qi that the woman spat out engulfed the smell emitted from the porcelain bottle. It was actually blown hundreds of feet, or even thousands of feet away!\"Don't be stunned.\" The woman grabbed Xiang Nan's right hand and said, \"What I blew just now was Demon Spirit Powder. Immediately, a powerful demon beast will be attracted over. Hurry up and leave.\"She pulled Little Yu'er with her left hand and Xiang Nan with her right. She jumped lightly on the spot, and her body was actually dragging the strength of the two of them out.Xiang Nan allowed the woman to fly with him, and he was shocked. She could fly! Heaven Origin Realm expert!Flying was a typical symbol of a Heaven Origin Realm expert. A martial artist would condense the first weather into Yuan Qi in the Origin Realm. In the Heaven Origin Realm, the quality of Yuan Qi would improve by leaps and bounds, allowing a martial artist to escape the restraints of the ground and fly through the air.Only then did Xiang Nan realize that this mysterious woman was at least not his enemy.Otherwise, with her strength at the Heaven Origin Realm, if she wanted to obtain something from him, then she could directly snatch it away. There was no need for her to do anything to help him.Thinking back to the way she looked at her sister and the tears that made him feel sad, Xiang Nan finally had a deeper understanding of this woman.\"Alright, this is it.\" The woman brought Xiang Nan and Little Yu'er to the ground slowly and said, \"The powerful demonic beasts have been attracted to where we were previously. We will go deeper from here.\"Xiang Nan wondered, \"Since you can fly, why don't you take us straight in?\"The woman glanced at Xiang Nan and said, \"If we go further, we will reach the core area. Flying will leave behind a strong Yuan Qi fluctuation, which will attract the attention of the demonic beasts.\"\"Oh\" Xiang Nan nodded silently.Indeed, he had never interacted with demonic beasts before. In his previous life, Bai Muchen had everything he wanted in the Profound Sky Sect. There was no need for him to personally search for demonic beasts.In his previous life, apart from cultivating, he had practiced cultivation.Thus, the three of them swiftly penetrated into the true core of the Black Sharp Demon Forest.At this point, a flash of lightning flashed in Xiang Nan's eyes. He discovered that the demonic aura here was extremely dense, and it was not on the same level as the area outside the core!Xiang Nan looked around, his gaze swiftly sweeping past every plant, searching for the second-grade Thunderbolt Vine he wanted.The woman also became cautious here. She lowered her voice and said, \"What exactly are you looking for? You must come to such a place.\"Xiang Nan whispered, \"Second Grade Thunderclap Vine.\"The woman chuckled softly, \"That fits well with your innate attributes. It looks like you're thinking of a way to improve your cultivation.\"When it came to innate attributes, Xiang Nan remained silent again.The woman glanced at Xiang Nan and said, \"Your guard is very heavy. Could it be that you have been betrayed by someone close to you?\"\"None of your business.\" Xiang Nan's voice became a little cold.The woman narrowed her eyes. Just as she was about to say something, her expression changed. \"Wait!\"She immediately stopped and hinted at Xiang Nan to lower his body.Right in front of him, in a dense forest, the shadow of a colossus slowly flashed past.The shadow looked at least three meters tall and five meters long, but it didn't make a sound as it walked!When Xiang Nan saw it, he couldn't help but gasp, \"I saw it in the Demonic Beast Tu Zhi. It's the Wind Bull!\"The Wind Bull was a type of wind-attributed demonic beast. It had a huge body, but its movements did not match its body. It could be said to be extremely agile.\"First level of Origin Return!\" The woman whispered, \"Don't attract its attention, or it will attract more demonic beasts.\"Xiang Nan Xia looked at Little Yu'er consciously.The woman said casually, \"Yu'er is wearing a black turtle armor. Demonic beasts below the Heaven Scryer Realm will not discover her.\"Xiang Nan grinned. \"Mysterious Turtle Protective Clothes \u2026\" He knew that the protective cloth was worth at least 50 million gold coins! What a big deal.After the Origin Realm Wind Bull left, the woman immediately pulled Little Yu'er forward and quickly stealthily said, \"Speed up. My Demon Spirit Powder only lasts for two hours.\"The three of them rushed towards the dense Demon Forest's core, but Xiang Nan's search for the Thunderbolt Vine was getting harder and harder.The deeper they went, the denser the vegetation became. The towering trees pierced through the clouds, and the broad-leaved vegetation below made the visibility very poor.The three of them spent another half an hour and passed through layers of dense jungle. Suddenly, their eyes brightened and a magnificent and peculiar woodland appeared.\"Ya!\" Little Yu'er clapped her hands in surprise and shouted, \"So beautiful.\"There was a large amount of strange-looking vegetation in that woodland. The key was that these vegetation would shine by itself!The dense jungle made the interior of the jungle as dark as night, and the glowing vegetation was especially dazzling.Liked it?

If there are Thunderbolt Vines in the demonic forest, it must be inside.\"The three of them carefully hid in the shining jungle. Everything around them seemed to be so mysterious and dreamy.A large number of plants emitted different colors of magnificent light, and even the insects inside would emit colorful light.Little Yu'er was the happiest. She touched this one while touching that one. Her face smiled incomparably brilliantly.When the woman saw this, she dotingly rubbed Xiao Yu'er's hair.\"Here, Thunderbolt Vine!\" A bright shadow flashed across Xiang Nan's eyes and he hurriedly rushed over.On a shining tree, there was a bright vine wrapped around it.Xiang Nan grabbed the vine but was disappointed.He put away the first-grade Thunderbolt Vine and the woman reminded him, \"We still have two hours. The smell of the Demon Spirit Powder is almost gone.\"Xiang Nan looked at Little Yu'er and really liked this girl in his heart. He said, \"Forget it, first grade is first grade. Let's go out.\"The woman shook her head. \"Isn't that for nothing? If you look again, there's still time.\"The three of them began to grope again. They found all sorts of strange spirit herbs here. Xiang Nan was naturally very impolite and kept them all.\"Ah, grapes.\" Little Yu'er pointed in one direction and giggled.When Xiang Nan heard this, he looked over with the woman and said in unison, \"Thunder Explosion Fruit!\"On a vine hung two clusters of grape-like things, but both of them emitted a dazzling glow.\"You know it too?\" The woman looked at Xiang Nan in surprise.\"Good stuff!\" Xiang Nan walked over excitedly and carefully reached out to pick a string of thunder explosion fruits. \"This thing will explode when it encounters a violent collision. It's very powerful!\"\"Judging from this grade, it should be a second-grade thunder explosion fruit. Throwing one out is enough to blow up a ninth level Xiantian expert. Throwing a string out is not a problem for a first level Gui Yuan expert!\"It's really good stuff! Xiang Nan carefully picked the two strands of Thunder Blast Fruits and separated them. There were a total of forty of them!Just as he was delighted, a ray of light appeared behind the Thunder Explosion Fruit Vine, causing Xiang Nan to be even more overjoyed.\"Thunderbolt Vine! My God, it's actually a third grade!\" Xiang Nan's eyes widened. He took off the Thunderbolt Vine and his heart was filled with delight.Originally, he wanted to find a second-grade Thunderbolt Vine, but he didn't expect to find a better third-grade Thunderbolt Vine!With this Tier 3 Thunderbolt Vine, the lightning resistance he had to temper was definitely better than he had expected!\"Alright, since you've found what you want, hurry up and leave.\" Seeing that Xiang Nan was so happy, the woman smiled infected.\"Thank you.\" After Xiang Nan put away the Thunderbolt Vine, he nodded to the woman sincerely.The woman smiled and pulled Little Yu'er out, \"The Demon Spirit Powder is still half an hour away. If we don't stop, there will still be plenty of time.\"\"Big brother.\" Little Yu'er grabbed Xiang Nan's hand, raised her head and blinked her big sparkling eyes, \"Can I have some grapes for Little Yu'er?\"Xiang Nan smiled and pinched Little Yu'er's nose. \"The grapes can't be eaten. It's very hot.\"Little Yu'er wrinkled her nose and said, \"Chi, you're stingy.\"The woman watched from the side and burst into laughter.The atmosphere between the three of them became even more harmonious, and they quickly left the shining jungle.However, not long after she left the flashing forest, Little Yu'er suddenly stood still. She slowly opened her mouth wide and coughed. Her beautiful face turned pale blue.\"Yu'er, what's wrong with you?\" Xiang Nan panicked and hurriedly grabbed Little Yu'er's hand.\"Get out of the way!\" The woman suddenly seemed to have gone crazy. She threw Xiang Nan aside. She hurriedly placed Little Yu'er on the ground and said anxiously, \"Why is it happening here?\"\"Sister \u2026 I \u2026 I'm cold \u2026\" Little Yu'er's expression was extremely painful. In just a few seconds, a layer of frost had formed on her body!Her cute little face had changed from light blue to dark blue, and her pair of big eyes were covered with frost.The strange low temperature circled around Little Yu'er, making her breathing even harder, and her heart almost stopped beating.Xiang Nan was stunned. He had never seen such a strange symptom before. What kind of illness was this?The woman, on the other hand, was familiar with Little Yu'er's work. She sat behind Little Yu'er and quickly rubbed her hands together. She immediately put them on Little Yu'er's back.In this way, she poured thick and dense Yuan Qi into Little Yu'er's body without any hesitation.Xiang Nan was shocked to see this scene and realized that Little Yu'er's illness was too strange.The woman continuously poured a large amount of Yuan Qi into Little Yu'er's body. Normally speaking, that massive amount of Yuan Qi was enough to blow up a Origin Returning Realm martial artist!However, the Yuan Qi that entered Little Yu'er's body only slightly slowed down Little Yu'er's freezing speed.At this moment, Little Yu'er didn't even have the slightest bit of aura, as if she was a dead person.The woman shed tears. She clenched her teeth and sent more Yuan Qi into Little Yu'er's body like crazy. \"Yu'er, don't be afraid. With Big Sister here, Big Sister won't let Yu'er die. Big Sister \u2026 Big Sister will definitely protect Yu'er.\"The woman cried as she spoke, choking her throat.Xiang Nan's nose turned sour and his eyes turned red.But at this moment, the bushes beside him suddenly shook, and the shadow of a colossus appeared.\"Wind Bull?\" Xiang Nan felt as if his brain was going to explode!Why did that damned wind bull appear at this time?At this moment, the woman was continuously injecting Yuan Qi into Little Yu'er's body. She could not be disturbed at all. Otherwise, she and Little Yu'er might both die.This situation was really urgent!The woman anxiously swept a glance at Xiang Nan. She wanted to speak, but unexpectedly, Xiang Nan turned around and ran away without saying a word!Xiang Nan quickly rushed out of the dense jungle and disappeared.Seeing this, the woman let out a miserable laugh. She shook her head, and all her words turned into a mouthful of silent sighs.As for the Origin Realm Wind Bull, it seemed to have smelled the \"fragrance\" of the woman's Yuan Qi. It actually knew that the woman was unable to move at this moment, so it spat out an excited white Qi from its nose.The wind bull's hooves moved twice on the ground before rushing towards the woman and Xiao Yu'er.The woman's face was ashen as she shook her head in desolation.Boom!Suddenly, a ball of flame exploded on the right side of the wind bull's body!The violent impact forcefully knocked the Wind Bull out.\"You?\" The woman was delighted and saw Xiang Nan's face through the cracks in the bushes.Xiang Nan's expression was extremely serious as he quickly said, \"Don't be distracted! Quickly suppress the ice cold for Little Yu'er!\"In Xiang Nan's hand, there was a thunder explosion fruit.Liked it?

Obviously, it was enraged by Xiang Nan.The enormous wind bull lowered its head and aimed a pair of sharp horns at Xiang Nan. Its four hooves moved and it turned into a gust of wind that charged towards Xiang Nan.\"So fast!\" Xiang Nan's pupils constricted, and he shot backwards with all his might. At the same time, he threw a Lightning Burst Fruit towards the Wind Bull.The thunder explosion fruit directly exploded above the wind bull's head, but it was unable to overturn the furious wind bull!The wind bull's speed only paused for a moment before quickly returning to its original speed and shooting towards Xiang Nan with a whoosh.Xiang Nan, a small Xiantian 3rd layer martial artist, was so stressed that he couldn't breathe when facing an enraged 1st level Origin Returning Wind Bull.That wind bull came too quickly. Xiang Nan was in a hurry, so he could only mobilize the power of lightning to push his Peng's voice out.At this moment, the wind bull brushed past Xiang Nan and rubbed his shoulder with its thick body.Even though it was just a scratch, Xiang Nan still felt as if he had been smashed by a mountain. His bones all over his body twitched violently a few times, and a mouthful of sweet blood oozed out from his throat.However, Xiang Nan's jump was fast enough and far enough.The wind bull lost Xiang Nan's target and turned around to run towards the woman and the little Yu'er sisters.The woman saw the wind bull getting closer and closer, and a look of despair appeared on her face.But at this moment, a whoosh rang out.Boom! The Wind Bull's body was struck by the Lightning Blast Fruit and was once again blown off course, smashing horizontally into a giant tree surrounded by five people.The giant tree was instantly smashed apart, and wood chips scattered everywhere.Xiang Nan jumped out and wiped a mouthful of blood from the corner of his mouth. \"Stupid cow, come and play with Grandpa. Your target is me!\"The wind bull jumped up furiously and charged towards Xiang Nan!The attributes of the Wind Element allowed it to be incredibly powerful, but at the same time, it was also extremely fast! This charge caused afterimages to appear on the enormous bull's body.\"Be careful!\" The woman cried out worriedly.Xiang Nan once again used the power of lightning to pour power into his feet and leap out horizontally.However, in midair, although the horns of the bull's head could not penetrate Xiang Nan's stomach, the bull's body once again rubbed against Xiang Nan's shoulder.This rubbing caused Xiang Nan to be directly smashed into an afterimage. He flew out and smashed into several ancient trees in succession.The bull had knocked Xiang Nan far away. After discovering that he had lost track of Xiang Nan, he turned around to deal with the two sisters.This time, the wind bull's momentum was inevitable. Its nostrils were wide open, and it spat out white gas as it rushed forward.Boom!Another explosion exploded on the bull's shoulder, sending him flying.Xiang Nan jumped out again from nowhere. He kept coughing and coughed out a mess of blood every time.\"Really hard!\" Xiang Nan let out a few painful groans and ripped off the long robe that had been torn into rags, revealing the black snake skin armor inside.If it wasn't for the protection of the Black Snake Leather Armor, just the collision of the Gui Yuan First Wind Bull would have been enough to shatter Xiang Nan's body.\"Pfft!\" Xiang Nan spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva and said, \"With this daddy here, you can't touch any of their sisters!\"As he said that, Xiang Nan heavily punched his chest, \"Come on, you damn stupid cow, I'll play with you to the end!\"Unfortunately, Xiang Nan thought to himself, Thunder Clap was a large-scale attack. In order to avoid injuring the two sisters, there was no way to use it here.The woman looked at Xiang Nan in shock. Seeing Xiang Nan in such a sorry state, yet he was so tenacious, a layer of gentle light gradually appeared in her eyes.That wind bull is really going crazy! It jumped up and down violently on the spot, throwing out a fierce beef temper, and then rushed towards Xiang Nan crazily.This time, it was really furious to the point of hysteria. It let out a \"moo\" roar from its throat. The strength of this charge was unprecedentedly great!Xiang Nan gritted his teeth. He knew that he could not dodge the charge of the wind bull no matter what, so he grabbed ten lightning explosive fruits in one go and threw them all at the wind bull.\"You're crazy!\" The woman cried out, \"You'll blow yourself up!\"Ten lightning explosive fruits exploded above the wind bull's head!Xiang Nan's calculations were very good. The two sisters happened to be behind the wind bull, at the dead end of the explosion of the thunder explosion fruit.At the same time, Xiang Nan used all of his strength to set up a weather shield in front of him! The first day the power of lightning was activated, and the surface of the shield crackled.However, a protective shield of this level was useless against the wind bull's charge. However, what Xiang Nan wanted was not to resist the wind bull's charge, butThe explosive fire wave instantly engulfed Feng Niu and Xiang Nan, and the fire wave landed on the protective shield, sending Xiang Nan flying.As Xiang Nan flew backwards, he felt as if his entire body had been knocked apart. He felt extremely painful, and even his mind started to buzz. His consciousness began to blur.\"Fortunately \u2026 getting blown up is much better than getting hit by that wind bull.\"Not only did the ten Lightning Blast Fruits send Xiang Nan flying, they also sent the Wind Bull flying. Its sturdy body flew through the air and fell heavily into the distant jungle.At this moment, the dark blue color on Little Yu'er's face had already turned pale blue. Her nose also had a weak aura, and she was about to recover.However, the horrifying wind bull at the first level of the Origin Realm actually jumped back!After being bombarded by ten lightning explosive fruits, this wind bull actually didn't injure its muscles and bones. However, there were some faint black horn marks on its fur. This bull's defense was much stronger than that of a human martial artist of the same realm.It looked around furiously, wanting to find traces of Xiang Nan, but after searching for a long time, it didn't see anything.As a result, its scarlet eyes were aimed at the two sisters.Just as it was about to dig its front hooves and charge at its sisters, something suddenly flew over from the sky.It was a translucent fruit.This time, the fruit was not shot over, but rather, it powerlessly drew an arc in the air and landed on the back of the wind bull.Boom!The fruit exploded, but due to a problem with the angle, the wind bull only shook its body a few times and did not overturn it.The dense bushes rustled, and Xiang Nan \u2026 appeared again!He dragged his miserable body out step by step. The black snake skin armor on his body had long since disappeared. It was estimated that it had been shattered by the intense explosive impact.Even Xiang Nan couldn't stand up straight anymore. His skin was cracked and blood seeped out from all over his body. He just stood there and his body kept waving.\"Come \u2026 come \u2026\" Xiang Nan chuckled, wiping the blood from the corner of his eyes and patting his chest, \"I haven't had enough fun yet \u2026 cough cough \u2026\"A large mouthful of blood was coughed to the ground.Liked it?

It stared at Xiang Nan with its eyes wide open. It must be thinking, what was going on with this tiny human?However, the demonic beast did not think too much. Since it did not understand, it raised its horns and decided to give Xiang Nan a final fatal blow.Just as the wind bull was about to charge forward, Xiang Nan finally knelt down on one knee because of exhaustion.He had blood in his mouth, but he was still smiling, \"Can \u2026 can \u2026 can you kill this daddy? It's also considered great fortune for you.\"Once upon a time, the number one genius in the starry sky would be killed by a small Origin Realm Wind Bull. I wonder what kind of virtue that Wind Bull had accumulated in his previous life.However, Xiang Nan looked at Little Yu'er and thought to himself.Although I have the intention to seek revenge on Xuan Qingzhu and her daughter, but \u2026 I really can't bear to see Little Yu'er killed. She's still so young.The wind bull had already begun to charge.Facing the charging wind bull, Xiang Nan spread out his arms and said, \"If I want to die \u2026 I will also die in a frontal battle. I will never escape.\"However, before the wind bull could charge over, Xiang Nan's body shook and he lost consciousness.The intense pain caused Xiang Nan to wake up from his coma.He immediately jumped up and shouted, \"Come on, you damn \u2026 huh?\"He suddenly realized that he was actually standing on the bed, with the quilt that had just been knocked over beneath his feet.The quilt was pink and emitted a faint fragrance of daughter.\"This \u2026 what kind of place is this?\" Xiang Nan looked at himself in surprise and found that he had changed into a new personal garment.He opened his clothes and looked again. A large number of dense cracks on his body were also smeared with ointment that emitted a faint medicinal fragrance.Looking at the surroundings, it was clearly the daughter's boudoir.At this moment, the door was pushed open with a creak, and a graceful figure stepped in.It was a woman. She had a pair of big eyes, but the corners of her eyes were tilted upwards. These eyes were called \"fox eyes\", and they carried an indissoluble charm.Her little nose was curved up, her lips were red, and the corners of her mouth drew a soul-stirring arc.Her cheeks curved perfectly, but there was also an inexplicable temptation mixed within them, coupled with that long and graceful snow neckXiang Nan had seen many peerless beauties, even Xuan Qingzhu, who could be called the number one beauty in the Nine Firmaments Continent.However, every beauty had her own style, and the beauty of this woman was a kind of \"seductiveness\" that was different from that of ordinary people. It belonged to an unquenchable desire that would arise from the depths of one's heart when one looked at it.\"You\" Xiang Nan was stunned for a moment. This woman made him feel very unfamiliar.\"You're awake.\" The woman smiled.\"It's you?\" Xiang Nan was stunned. This was actually the mysterious woman. She took off her veil?\"Can't recognize me?\" She put her two slender, white and tender fingers around the corner of her eyes and said, \"You should recognize these eyes.\"\"So it's like this.\" Xiang Nan suddenly came to a realization. No wonder! It turned out that this woman had disguised herself on her eyes. Her real eyes were the fox's eyes.\"Where's Little Yu'er! How is she?\" Xiang Nan shook his head and hurriedly asked.The woman said gratefully, \"Yu'er is fine now, thanks to you.\"\"That's good.\" Xiang Nan breathed a sigh of relief, but he always felt that this woman's manner did not match her appearance.This woman could be said to be calm and dignified, giving people the feeling of maturity without losing the style of a big family.However, her appearance was not like this. Perhaps this was the reason why she covered her face.The woman walked to the window with a light lotus step and placed her hand on Xiang Nan's shoulder. \"You're not well yet. Lie down and rest. I'll bring you a bowl of soup.\"Her approach brought with it a faint fragrance of daughter, filled with Xiang Nan's sense of smell.There was nothing wrong with this action, but her appearance gave her a foxy smell.Xiang Nan's eyes were blank. \"You \u2026 you really are that woman? Why don't you feel like it?\"The woman used a finger to lightly tap Xiang Nan's forehead, \"It's really me! Alright, quickly rest for a while, my hero.\"After saying that, the woman turned around and walked out of the room.Xiang Nan sat on the bed and scratched his head. \"Big hero? What's the matter? Did she take the wrong medicine?\"However, after a while, this woman returned with a bowl of soup. Furthermore, under Xiang Nan's uncomfortable circumstances, she had to personally feed Xiang Nan a cup of soup.She sat at the head of the bed and looked down at Xiang Nan. Suddenly, she said softly, \"Did you know that no one has ever protected Little Yu'er so recklessly?\"\"Although you are only a small Xiantian 3rd layer martial artist, what you have done in the Black Sharp Demon Forest is more courageous than all the men I know.\"\"It's not as exaggerated as you said.\" Xiang Nan drank the bitter soup and said, \"I'm in such a sorry state because I'm not strong enough. That's why I look so heroic.\"The woman smiled and shook her head, \"But it is precisely because you are weak that you dare to stand up to that wind bull again and again, that makes you even braver, isn't it?\"\"The moment you spread out your arms and stood in front of the wind bull, I felt that you were the bravest hero in the world, the hero of me and Little Yu'er.\"Xiang Nan felt that there was something wrong with the woman's tone. He felt a little embarrassed and changed the topic, \"What happened to Little Yu'er?\"Hearing this, the woman smiled bitterly, \"Yu'er has been suffering from a strange disease since she was born. At first, she would attack once a month. When she attacked, her entire body would be incomparably icy cold. Every time she attacked, her life would be in danger.\"\"In order to treat Yu'er, we used all the methods we could think of, but none of them worked.\"\"In recent years, the frequency of Yu'er's illness has become higher and higher, becoming more and more serious. Although our clan has used all their strength, it is still unable to cure her. Some of our clan's elders even advised me to give up \u2026\"The woman sniffled and wiped away the tears from the corner of her eyes, \"But I refuse. Little Yu'er is my life!\"\"So you took her away from the clan and went to seek medical attention?\" Xiang Nan's heart was filled with emotions. This was also a bitter woman.At the same time, Xiang Nan was deeply moved by the woman's feelings for her sister.The woman said softly, \"I've traveled almost all over the continent. As long as I can cure Yu'er, I'm willing to give everything I have.\"Xiang Nan let out a long sigh and suddenly laughed, \"Could it be that only Lightning Meridian martial artists can cure Yu'er's illness? So you brought that black saber and searched everywhere to find a Lightning Meridian martial artist.\"The woman nodded. \"Don't worry, I know what the Lightning Meridian attribute means to a martial artist. You've done enough for our sisters. I won't ask you to risk your life to help us anymore.\"\"Can I trust you?\" Xiang Nan asked.Liked it?

I'm willing to help you.\"\"You \u2026\" The woman sobbed with joy, \"Are you really willing?\"Xiang Nan curled his lips. \"I'm not as selfish as you think.\"\"I know, I believe it!\" The woman nodded her head forcefully, \"You rest for half a day. I'll come to see you in the morning and talk about Yu'er's illness.\"When she took the medicine bowl from Xiang Nan, her fingertips accidentally touched Xiang Nan's hand, but a red cloud flew up on her charming face.\"I'm Huangpu Ruyan and my sister's name is Huangpu Ruoyu,\" she whispered as she pulled open the door and stepped out.Looking at the closed door, Xiang Nan sighed, \"I only heard of the Huangpu Clan in my previous life. I never thought that I would get to know them in this life.\"\"I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing for me.\"In his mind, he gradually recalled what his master had said to him in his previous life.\"The Huangpu Aristocrat Clan is an ancient clan that has lasted for thousands of years. Every generation of Patriarch of this clan is a person who stomps his feet, causing the entire world to tremble.\"\"Mu Chen, try not to get too involved with this clan. At the very least, don't be hostile to them.\"The next day, Xiang Nan's health greatly improved. He did not want to stay in his room, so he came out to exercise.Only then did he realize that this was a manor located in the outer suburbs of Bluestone City, and it could be said to be a beautiful scenery with beautiful birds singing and flowers singing.Xiang Nan took a deep breath and stretched his body. He felt that his skin injury had basically healed. Only his muscles and bones still had some injuries. He needed to recuperate for a few days before he could fully recover.\"How is your health?\" Beside an artificial stream, Huangpu Ruyan walked over from the willow forest with a smile.\"Much better.\" \"Looks like you've used a lot of precious spiritual herbs for me,\" Xiang Nan said.\"Compared to what you've done for our sisters, what I've done isn't worth mentioning.\" Huangpu Ruyan held a bowl of soup in her hand, \"Here, drink it.\"Xiang Nan took a sip and said, \"Since there's no problem, let's quickly think of a way to save Little Yu'er.\"Ruyan smiled and nodded, \"I'm ready. Follow me.\"The two of them passed through the willow forest and arrived at a rockery. The rockery was very big, and it was actually a hidden mechanism.Ruyan activated the mechanism and the entire rockery moved out, revealing the entrance to an underground cave. The two entered the cave downwards, hiding an extremely open secret chamber in the deepest part of the cave.Xiang Nan looked around. This secret room was a training ground. All kinds of tools and facilities needed for cultivation should be available.Xiang Nan noticed that there were two things on the opposite wall of the secret training ground. One was a pill furnace, and the other was a human-shaped stone.Seeing the stone, Xiang Nanqi said, \"You have a Spirit Testing Stone? That's great.\"Ruyan smiled faintly, \"That Spirit Testing Stone can only detect attacks below the Heaven Origin Realm at most. You can use it.\"\"Right, before that, I have something for you.\"As she spoke, Ruyan took out three items from her storage ring. They were a black saber, a set of black armor, and a book.\"You want to give these to me?\" Xiang Nan asked curiously. He had already seen the black saber, but this was the first time he had seen the black armor and books.Ruyan pointed at the black saber first and said, \"This saber is called 'Black Scales', while the soft armor next to it is called 'Ink Spot'.\"\"This saber and armor are compatible. As long as you absorb the power of the Lightning Meridian attribute into it, its grade will naturally increase. As far as I know, the limit they can reach is Earth Grade Beginner Stage.\"\"Earth grade?\" Xiang Nan asked in surprise, \"Such a high level? I'm afraid the entire Blue Stone City will never find such a high-grade weapon or armor again.\"Ruyan said, \"Your current realm is still relatively low. Under normal circumstances, you can upgrade the Black Scaled Cui to the Intermediate Spirit Stage. When it explodes, you can reach the High Spirit Stage.\"\"There's also this book. It's a secret manual of its own. It's called 'Flash Shadow Steps'. It's an Earth Grade Elementary Movement Technique. It can be activated through the power of the Lightning Meridian attribute.\"\"Another Earth Grade!\" Xiang Nan sucked in a breath of cold air. This secret manual was too precious!This was because generally speaking, movement technique manuals were rarer than cultivation technique manuals. A local-grade movement technique manuals were far more valuable than an earth-grade cultivation technique manuals.Ruyan said, \"These past few years, I've brought Yu'er around to search for Lightning Vein attribute martial artists. I've also collected these three items related to Lightning Vein, and it just so happens to be for you, Young Master Xiang.\"Xiang Nan was not a hypocrite. If someone else gave it to him, he would accept it impolitely.Ruyan said, \"You wanted to use the Spirit Testing Stone just now, right? I'll help you test your current state together.\"\"Mm, I just want to know more about my combat strength.\" Xiang Nan stretched his muscles and bones, full of energy.The humanoid spirit stone was transported to the center of the training ground.Ruyan took a notebook and stood at the side, \"Now, test your normal strength.\"Xiang Nan raised his hand and punched the Spirit Testing Stone. The Spirit Testing Stone trembled a few times.Ruyan carefully observed the situation of the Spirit Testing Stones, wrote and drew in the notebook, and reported several times, \"Normal strength is 2,300 jin. Next, the limit strength is tested.\"Xiang Nan transformed his strength into thunder and lightning, instantly increasing his strength by three times. With a punch, the Spirit Testing Stone was knocked back by the impact and slipped back an inch.Ruyan nodded and said, \"Seven thousand jin, about three times the normal strength. Now, let's test the power of the normal weather first.\"After careful testing, Xiang Nan came up with the following figures.Currently, Xiang Nan was a Xiantian 3rd layer martial artist.The normal strength was 2,300 jin, and the maximum explosive strength was 7,000 jin.Normally, the power of the first weather was 2,300 jin, converting the first weather into thunder and lightning, and then 3,500 jin. The thunder and lightning attribute erupted to the limit of 9,000 jin.After Xiang Nan used the precious power of lightning, his strength was 13,000 jin!Since Ruyan already knew about Xiang Nan's lightning vein attributes, Xiang Nan didn't even conceal the Fire Thunder Technique and immediately tested the power of the Thunder Clap s.The Thunder Clap waves he used with the power of thunder and lightning completely drained the power of thunder and lightning in one go. Its lethality was 35,000 jin!The lethality of the Thunder Clap waves he activated with the power of lightning was 90,000 jin!Even Xiang Nan himself was shocked. At first, he didn't think much of it, but now that he had obtained the exact value, he knew that the power of lightning and Thunder Clap s were so abnormal!\"How is it?\" Xiang Nan leaned weakly against the wall, for he had used up all his previous weather and lightning power.Ruyan was first shocked, then frowned, \"To tell the truth, both joy and sorrow are mixed.\"Liked it?

But at the same time, it's also your weakness.\"'\"Because your cultivation level is too low, you have to use the Limit Burst to defeat your enemies when fighting against others. The Limit Burst means that you are overloaded.\"Ruyan looked at Xiang Nan seriously and said, \"Whether it's strength, weather, lightning, or martial arts, you need to explode to the limit!\"\"But your own dantian only has that little capacity. It's simply not enough.\"\"Yes.\" Xiang Nan sighed, \"That's why I urgently want to improve my cultivation.\"Ruyan nodded, \"Mm, so when you fight someone, try not to use it without exploding. This is not to conceal your strength, but to be able to fight for a longer period of time.\"\"But I still have something to tell you.\" Ruyan raised her \"Flash Shadow Steps\" and said, \"This local grade elementary movement technique is too high, so it is also very terrifying to your physical strength consumption.\"\"Next, let's test your speed.\"Xiang Nan rested for a while and began to test his speed. He got a result.Based on the Xiantian 3-dan test, Xiang Nan normally sprinted at 20 meters per second.Medium speed sprint: 30 meters per second.The maximum charge was 40 meters per second.Thunder and lightning poured into his feet, and the explosive charge was: 100 meters per second.Ruyan nodded her head and said, \"I've seen the Flash Shadow Steps. This Earth Grade Movement Technique can increase the movement speed of a Xiantian realm martial artist by five times. Because this movement technique requires the power of thunder and lightning, you will be able to use the Flash Shadow Steps to reach 500 meters per second.\"\"As for the Shadow Steps, they can increase the speed of Origin Realm martial artists by four times, Heaven Origin Realm martial artists by three times, and Heaven Scryer Realm martial artists by two times.\"Xiang Nan said, \"In other words, I can only use this Flash Shadow Step to the Heaven Origin Realm. It won't be of much use in the future.\"Ruyan said, \"Of course, these speed values are based on your Xiantian 3rd layer. If you reach the Xiantian 4th or 5th layer, your normal speed will increase.\"\"Yes, but can the Xiantian realm be increased by five times?\" Xiang Nan smiled. A five-fold short-range movement was definitely at the Overlord level in this realm!What was the concept of five hundred meters in a second? There would definitely be afterimages in the sprint! Moreover, his speed had already surpassed that of the third level Origin Returning Wind Bull.\"As for defense.\" Ruyan held the black armor and said, \"This black armor can only provide you with a proportional amount of defense.\"\"That is to say, if the enemy uses 10,000 jin of power to smash you, Ink Spot can absorb 3,000 jin of power for you, but if the enemy uses only 10,000 jin of power to smash you, it can absorb 3,000 jin for you.\"\"Oh \u2026 I understand.\" Suddenly, Xiang Nan said, \"So this is the defensive mode of the defensive armor.\"Not only was Xiang Nan not disappointed, he was also very happy. Because of Mo Ban's defensive properties, Xiang Nan would be able to enjoy its benefits in any day-to-day battles.Unlike the Black Snake Leather Armor, it would only work when faced with a fatal blow.At the same time, this ink-stained armor was not easily damaged.Then, Xiang Nan increased the power of his weapon once more.Xiang Nan's normal strength was 2,300 jin, and his limit was 7,000 jin. However, after he grabbed the giant black scale saber, the value remained unchanged.On the other hand, Xiang Nan's normal initial weather strength was 2,300 jin, and after using the black scale, it was 3,000 jin.The lightning attribute was 3,500 jin of weather power first, and 4,000 jin after using the black scale.Xiang Nan considered the black scale and said, \"As expected, a weapon with intelligence can only increase the power of the weather.\"\"Yes.\" Ruyan nodded and said, \"But something like saber qi cannot be measured by strength alone. It involves the sharpness of saber qi, the characteristics of cultivation techniques, and how high and complex a specific martial skill is. This is not going to be introduced here.\"Naturally, Xiang Nan was very clear about this, so he didn't say anything else.The more he looked at the black scale, the more he liked it. This huge saber had a calm and reserved aura, and it was a big coincidence that it didn't work. It won Xiang Nan's favor.\"I've finished all my questions. Now, let's talk about Little Yu'er.\" Xiang Nan put away all the treasures.Ruyan smiled and took out hundreds of spirit herbs from her storage ring!Xiang Nan was dumbfounded. These spirit herbs were priceless and rare in the market.Ru Yan said, \"An Imperial Physician once told me that to cure Yu'er's illness, one must rely on the lightning meridian attribute of the weather or Yuan Qi to refine pills.\"\"Although we are only practicing third-grade pills, we still have to wait. I have already sent a message to ask the family alchemist for help.\"\"Alchemy?\" Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Then don't bother your family members. I can do it.\"\"You?\" Ruyan said happily, \"How many surprises are you hiding? The more I dig, the more I will discover that you are unfathomable.\"Tier 3 medicinal pills weren't too high-grade. Xiang Nan was confident that he could easily obtain them, and he could guarantee that they were all top-grade Tier 3 medicinal pills!Immediately, the two of them ignited the pill furnace in the training room.Ruyan personally controlled the fire and released a ball of Yuan Qi. The Yuan Qi burned into Yuan Qi flames and directly burned the bottom of the pill furnace.This matter concerned her younger sister's life and death. Ruyan also became nervous as never before. Soon, fine beads of sweat appeared on her forehead.She nervously looked at Xiang Nan and said, \"Okay?\"\"No problem.\" Xiang Nan smiled confidently. According to the formula provided by Ruyan, he divided the hundred pills into ten batches and put them into ten batches.Following that, Xiang Nan used the power of thunder and lightning to enter the pill furnace, accurately controlling every tiny bit of change inside.To tell the truth, Ruyan was still very nervous at the beginning, because it was an extremely complicated process to train a hundred kinds of spirit herbs together. As long as there was a single mistake, all the spirit herbs would be burned to the ground.However, as Xiang Nan's pill refining progress deepened, the expression on her face changed from nervousness to relaxation, then to surprise, then to disbelief, and finally to shock!More than a hundred spiritual herbs were put into the pill furnace one after another, and not a single spiritual herb had gone wrong!\"My God \u2026\" Ruyan was incomparably shocked. \"Young Master Xiang's control over the temperature of alchemy is simply comparable to an Empire Alchemist! No, even more terrifying than an Empire Alchemist!\"Boom!The top of the furnace opened and a batch of fresh pills appeared.Every pill was glowing with a faint red light. It was indeed a third-grade pill, and it was a top-grade pill amongst top-grade pills!Ruyan held these pills and cried out in joy, \"I finally got them. After years of hard work, I finally saw hope.\"Xiang Nan wiped his sweat and looked at it. \"There are almost three hundred, right? Is it enough?\"Ruyan nodded excitedly, \"Enough, enough. A hundred is enough. Young Master Xiang, I \u2026 I don't know how to thank you.\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 Raise rapidlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euXiang Nan waved his hand and said, \"It's too unusual to tell me this now.\"Ruyan shook her head seriously and said, \"No, you saved Yu'er, that's equivalent to saving my life! Ruyan will never forget such a great kindness.\"\"There are three signaling orders. They are filled with my blood and Yuan Qi. You can send me a message at any time.\"Xiang Nan took the message and put it away solemnly. \"Go, hurry up and give Little Yu'er some pills. I have to go home,\" he said.The two of them were separated at the manor. Xiang Nan received a Wind Chasing Horse and hurried back to Bluestone Town.The Wind Chasing Stallion was a Xiantian First Stage demonic beast. It could use demonic energy to run wildly for a long distance. Its speed was comparable to the speed of a Xiantian realm martial artist. It was an extremely expensive item.This Wind Chasing Colt was especially sturdy. Its head was two zhang long from head to tail, and its hooves were eight feet tall from back. Its entire body was pitch black, and it was extremely mighty.Xiang Nan rode on the Wind Chasing Stallion and rode on the wind. He could only feel the scenery on both sides rapidly retreating.After returning to the Xiang manor, he took a quick look and chatted with his mother for a while before rushing to the Black Sharp Mountain Range.The Xiang Clan's industry was rising methodically. There was no need for Xiang Nan to worry about all of this. What he needed to do now was to find a place where no one else could help him improve his resistance to electricity.The overlapping Black Sharp Mountain Range.Here, Xiang Nan easily found a deserted place.After arranging the necessary appliances, he took three deep breaths in a row: \"It's about to start.\"\"I hope that I can get a big improvement this time. It's worthy of my hard work in searching for materials.\"After seeing that there was no one around, he used the three-meter-tall black-scaled heavy knife to dig a large pit that was twenty meters deep on the ground. This pit had already penetrated deep into the interior of the mountain.Then, he put the pill furnace into the pit, jumped into the pill furnace himself, and buried the soil above in the first day.After confirming that he was safe and sound, Xiang Nan nodded in satisfaction. He was in the darkness of the pill furnace and put a stone skin pill into his mouth.\"That crazy alchemist said that refining a martial artist into a pill would have an unexpected effect.\"\"I hope what he said is correct.\" Xiang Nan was somewhat uneasy, but there was no turning back now.He slammed his hands on the inner wall of the furnace, causing the fire inside the furnace to instantly burst into flames.A human, even if he was a Xiantian realm martial artist, would not be able to survive in the midst of the flames.Therefore, Xiang Nan used the Stone Skin Pill. This pill was extremely effective, causing Xiang Nan's skin to be petrified within the next two hours, thus guaranteeing that it would not be burned to death.Then, there were all sorts of other spirit herb pills that were either orderly consumed or used to smear the body.Even so, as his body refinement progress increased, Xiang Nan also began to feel his body burning hot, and his suffocation became more and more severe.Fortunately, with the help of the Rejuvenation Pill, the powerful medicinal properties allowed him to get rid of his dependence on the air, while the Snow Cicada Grass cooled his body.Finally, it was a third-grade Thunderbolt Vine.Plants had an incomparable tolerance for nature. Plants could be found in almost every corner of the world. They could adapt to any harsh natural environment.The Thunderbolt Vine was a special spiritual herb that grew up in the baptism of thunder and lightning all year round.This time, Xiang Nan slowly fused the lightning resistance of the Thunderbolt Vine into his human body.The flames inside the pill furnace became even more intense. Xiang Nantong's body turned red, as if he was a human-shaped sculpture that had been burned red. The lightning resistance of the Thunderbolt Vine penetrated into his skin, entering his bone essence and organs.At the end of the refinement, Xiang Nan's entire face flushed red. He gritted his teeth and endured unimaginable pain. He thought to himself, \"It's almost done.\"\"I've practiced almost all the bones in my body. In the end, I only have my dantian and meridians left.\"At this moment, the Shi Fu Pill still had ten minutes left to act.The Thunderbolt Vine's powerful electric resistance swiftly flowed through Xiang Nan's body. Xiang Nan's eyes suddenly opened, and a flash of lightning flashed in his eyes.The power of thunder and lightning was activated to its limit. Instantly, an arc of lightning that was rarely seen by the naked eye wrapped around Xiang Nan's entire body.First, the weather had condensed into thunder and lightning attributes! It started from its dantian with the medicinal properties of the Thunderbolt Vine and swam to every meridian structure in its body.At this point, after swimming for two whole cycles, the medicinal properties of the Thunderbolt Vine were finally completely absorbed by Xiang Nan.Boom!The top of the pill furnace opened, and the dirt from the pill furnace was directly lifted into the sky. Immediately after, a figure soared into the sky!Xiang Nan rolled over in midair and landed on the ground. Within the storage ring, the pill furnace had just landed.\"Success!\" Xiang Nan looked at his body excitedly. He found that his skin became more smooth and lustrous, like a newborn baby.\"I didn't expect that this body refinement would not only increase my resistance to electricity, but also eliminate a lot of impurities from my body.\"Xiang Nan chuckled. Looks like his harvest this time was not small.The next step was to continue absorbing the lightning arc power of the White Flame Lightning.After he was fully prepared, he tossed the Lightning Talisman into the air and muttered to himself, \"Every time his realm rises, the difficulty will greatly increase. I wonder if this advancement will allow him to jump two small realms in a row like last time.\"As he spoke, he still circulated the Nine Transformations Lightning-shocking Art. The powerful summoning power in his body was summoning the White Flame Lightning.In an instant, the lightning talisman cracked. Layers of white lightning visible to the naked eye wrapped around the lightning talisman. The surrounding wind roared loudly, and all the trees were shattered.\"I wonder how long it will take to truly absorb the lightning source of the lightning.\" Xiang Nan let out a breath and casually waved his hand, causing a white lightning bolt to fly over.After the lightning bolt touched Xiang Nan's body, Xiang Nan's eyes widened, and a wisp of intense lightning flashed in his eyes.In less than an instant, the power of the lightning arc had completely penetrated every inch of Xiang Nan's skin, muscles, and bones.\"Indeed!\" Xiang Nan snorted in pain, his expression slightly twisted.This arc belonged to the second arc. Last time, it completely failed to absorb the second arc. And this time, the resistance to electricity really worked.Xiang Nan could clearly feel the pain he had endured, but it was much better than last time! At least his muscles haven't spasmed yet.The terrifying lightning power contained in that arc was even more intense and mellow than the first!\"It's starting!\" Xiang Nan's pupils contracted, and he felt his realm loosen.Xiantian 3rd layer \u2026 Xiantian 4th layer!Breakthrough!\"So fast!\" Xiang Nan's heart skipped a beat. The distance between the third level and the fourth level was much greater than the distance between the second level and the third level!Even so, he still managed to cross over so quickly!Liked it?

However, this weakening was just a drop in the bucket.\"Get through it! You must get through it!\" The corners of Xiang Nan's mouth twitched and his muscles began to unconsciously spasm.The violent power of lightning was frantically activating Xiang Nan's realm.Xiantian 5th layer!\"Two small realms.\" Xiang Nan was so miserable that he could no longer speak, so he could only mutter to himself in his heart.However, nearly 90% of the lightning bolts were still inside Xiang Nan's body, waiting for him to be accepted.\"This second bolt of lightning is much more powerful than the first?\" Xiang Nan was shocked.One small realm increase had already filled Xiang Nan's body, while the two small realms had completely saturated his body.Do you want to hold on? Perhaps he could break through to another small realm.He had the intention to stop, but the fifth level of Xiantian was still not enough!Forget it, you have to suffer bitterly before you can be a master! Only if others didn't dare to do so would they be able to become true experts!\"I don't believe it.\" Xiang Nan clenched his teeth. Both rows of silver teeth were about to collapse. He roared in his heart, \"Divine grade talent is definitely not that bad! I can hold on any longer!\"Ka ka ka ka!Fine cracks appeared on his skin. Red blood seeped out from the cracks. When the cracks opened, a strange sound similar to that of a rock shattering could be heard.In fact, tears of blood flowed out of his eyes.\"I can hold on for a while longer! Aaaaaaaaaaah!\" Xiang Nan suddenly opened his mouth and squeezed out a roar from his throat.Xiantian, sixth level!\"Success! I've really crossed three small realms \u2026 Ah, not good!\"Xiang Nan had only just arrived when he discovered a serious problem!He had already broken through the limits of what he could withstand, causing his consciousness to rapidly decline.At this moment, Xiang Nan panicked and paled, wanting to stop the circulation of the Nine Transformations of Thunder Cultivation Technique, only to discover that his consciousness had declined too quickly and was not enough!\"It's over\" Before Xiang Nan lost consciousness, this was the only word that flashed through his mind.Boom!The lightning exploded, forming a ball of lightning that enveloped Xiang Nan's entire body.At this moment, Xiang Nan was lying flat at the core of the thunderball, fainting.Xiang Nan did not know how long he had been unconscious. He only realized that he had woken up many times in a daze.Every time he woke up, he could only last for a few seconds, and every time, he could feel pain like a purgatory.He was crazily destroyed by the power of lightning, as if he was in an eternal cycle of infernal hell.Even the moment he woke up, he realized that he hadn't really woken up. Instead, he was in a state of half-awake and half-dreaming.He felt that he was in an endless darkness, and there was only one feeling in his body, pain!The pain was so painful that he couldn't bear to live. His heart was torn apart, and he kept roaring in the darkness.He could vaguely feel that his body was on the verge of shattering. His skin had originally only cracked, but now it was shards of skin falling off his body.Blood stained him as a bloody man, his muscles showed signs of disintegration, and his internal organs quickly collapsed.\"I didn't expect \u2026 to actually die in such a place because of greed.\" Xiang Nan sighed silently, but he didn't regret what he had done.If he didn't dare to fight, could he still be considered a man?Slowly, he felt that the pain in his body had subsided.\"Are you really going to die?\" Xiang Nan weakly remembered that he couldn't even feel the pain anymore.However, in reality, a miracle was happening!The skin fragments that had fallen off Xiang Nan's body had actually begun to return to his body!At that moment, Xiang Nan suddenly opened his eyes. He felt his skin and muscles tighten.\"Break and stand!\" Xiang Nan's eyes flashed with a bright light. He discovered that he was still at the center of the violent thunderball.Thus, he deduced that he had only fainted for a few seconds, but in the sensory world, it was as long as several decades.He didn't have time to sigh with emotion before decisively stopping the Nine Transformations of Thunder incantation.The tyrannical ball of lightning quickly disintegrated and turned into lightning bolts. The lightning bolts then disintegrated into smaller arcs and disappeared into the air.As for Xiang Nan, he suddenly leapt into the air and landed on the ground!Boom!This time, the landing was not violent, but it caused the ground to shake. Under his feet, there was actually a circular cracked hole. That hole was charred black.\"I still have a large amount of remnant lightning power in my body.\" Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes slightly, looking at the sky like a Thunder Clap.He protected the precious power of lightning in his dantian, and at the same time sucked out all the excess power of lightning in his body.Boom! A round of fan-shaped crystal blue light soared into the sky! The light exploded in midair, causing the wind to blow away the clouds in the sky.\"So strong?\" Xiang Nan's eyes widened. This was the strongest Thunder Clap he had ever released.It seemed like the truth was just as he had guessed. The power of this second bolt of lightning was far more powerful than the first bolt of lightning.Then, Xiang Nan's thoughts stirred. He waved his hand and drew a new arc, the third arc. However, he did not suck it into his body and only observed it carefully.The power of this third arc was extremely violent. It was countless times stronger than the second arc. Xiang Nan did not dare to attempt to absorb such a powerful arc.\"Strong again.\" Xiang Nan frowned, \"With the strength of my body that I have tempered now, I don't dare to touch this lightning bolt easily. However \u2026\"He pondered for a moment. The formula he had just used to improve his resistance to electricity was already the most powerful prescription he had.Obviously, if he wanted to absorb the third arc, he had to find a stronger recipe.Xiang Nan didn't have any high-grade prescriptions, so he had to go to the library of some powerful sects to find them.\"Mm\" Xiang Nan nodded. After the city selection, he could join a sect. At that time, he would have another chance. Now, he should start cultivating the Flash Shadow Steps.He inserted the black scale into the ground and took out the Shadow Stepping Technique to slowly watch. This technique itself belonged to the Earthly Grade Beginner Stage, and was a martial skill that was specifically used to move figures. It did not have any attack effects.\"Mm \u2026 Although it's complicated, it's easy to understand.\" Xiang Nan flipped through the Shadow Steps and nodded.In his previous life, he had cultivated countless more complicated cultivation methods, so this Flash Shadow Step was nothing in his eyes.Liked it?

It's not difficult to understand it. What's difficult is to master it.\"He stood up and muttered to himself, pouring the weather under his feet.The moment the Flash Shadow Step Art took effect, the dust particles under Xiang Nan's feet slowly floated upwards.Whoosh!Xiang Nan took a step forward, followed by Peng!\"Damn it\" He rubbed his forehead and discovered that he had actually crashed into a mountain wall.\"Mountain wall?\" Looking at the huge cracks on the mountain walls, Xiang Nan was stunned, \"There are no mountain walls in my place. Could it be \u2026 ah!\"He turned around and saw that the surrounding scenery was very unfamiliar.He immediately recalled that the Flash Steps were five times faster than his limit speed, five hundred meters per second!This was because the Black Sharp Mountain Range was densely forested, and he only needed to walk a hundred meters away to be unable to see where he had been previously.\"Ha \u2026 haha!\" Xiang Nan sat on the ground and couldn't help but laugh out loud.\"My saber! My saber is still far away.\"He once again used the Shadow Steps to charge in the direction he had come from.At that time, the scenery on both sides became blurry due to the rapid retreat, followed by a series of explosions.After Xiang Nan stopped, he picked up the wood chips on his head and looked back. A dozen trees were broken wherever he passed.Xiang Nan inserted his black scale behind him and carried it on his back instead of putting it into his storage ring.This was because he knew that a martial artist's weapon had to be worn close to his body from time to time. If this continued for such a long time, it would create an illusory tacit understanding between the martial artist and the weapon.However, this black scale was three meters tall, and Xiang Nan was only a little over 1.7 meters tall. He looked a little disproportionate with the knife on his back, but there was no lack of visual shock.He adjusted his angle a few times before using the black scale to absorb his body, preventing the sword from touching the ground.Then, Xiang Nan muttered to himself, \"If he used the Flash Steps to cooperate with the Splitting Blade's movements, wouldn't it be that its power has increased dramatically?\"Thinking of this, he immediately went into the experiment excitedly.Xiang Nan held the hilt of the saber in his right hand and made an advance motion of drawing the saber, aiming at a tree ten meters away.Immediately after, he shouted, \"Flash Shadow!\"Whoosh! Peng!His speed was too fast, and his entire body turned into an afterimage! Even though his saber had just been raised, he had already leaned against the tree.The tree was indeed destroyed, but it was hit with his face.\"Haha\" Xiang Nan helplessly smiled bitterly, \"The Shadow Flash Steps are really fast, but it's too fast.\"The Flash Step was only five hundred meters in a second, which made it extremely difficult for Xiang Nan to make a short distance movement of five meters or ten meters.This was the first time that Xiang Nan felt the difficulty of cultivating a high-level movement technique in advance.\"In order to solve this dilemma, we have to go through a lot of training.\" He rubbed his shoulders and said.If he was too fast, he wouldn't be able to keep up with his reaction speed, and if he couldn't keep up with his reaction speed, he would lose his flexibility.Xiang Nan carried his huge black saber and the dust under his feet slowly floated up. With a whoosh, it turned into an afterimage and rushed out.As a result, the entire mountain range was filled with traces of Xiang Nan crashing into trees and mountains.Peng!\"Aiya \u2026\"Peng!\"Damn it!\"Peng!\"Ahhh, another collision!\"From midnight to dawn, a red sun illuminated the forest through the cracks between the mountains.Xiang Nan sat cross-legged under a tree, tearing at the leg of lamb he carried with him as he ate and flipped through his storage ring.\"The Flash Steps have consumed too much energy and weather.\" He wiped his mouth. In the storage ring, almost all the spirit herbs and pills used to recover had been eaten clean!Every time the Shadow Steps rushed 500 meters, it would consume nearly a tenth of his previous weather! This figure was incomparably terrifying.Xiang Nan packed his things and looked at a tree ten meters away.Following that, dust rose from beneath his feet and his body turned into an afterimage as he rushed out.In an instant, the sprint stopped. Xiang Nan steadied himself and turned around to see that the tree was already five meters behind him.\"I rushed fifteen meters.\" Xiang Nan nodded, \"The error is controlled at about five meters, but it is still far from enough.\"Xiang Nan sat down cross-legged, slowly absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, absorbing it into his body, refining his dantian into his own weather.This was the most common way for martial artists to cultivate, but it was a bit too time consuming for Xiang Nan.\"I need spirit stones.\" Half an hour later, Xiang Nan's body was finally filled with primordial energy, he muttered to himself.He found his Wind Chasing Stallion and rode away.Spirit stones were a peculiar type of ore. They contained abundant spiritual energy, which was absorbed faster than the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth. They could quickly replenish a martial artist's energy consumption, but their price was extremely expensive.Spirit stones were divided into five grades: defective spirit stones, low-grade spirit stones, mid-grade spirit stones, high-grade spirit stones, and top-grade spirit stones.In Bluestone City, there was a spirit stone shop.There were two floors in this shop. The first floor sold defective spirit stones, the second floor sold low-grade spirit stones, and there was no higher grade spirit stones.Even so, those spirit stones were still very precious and kept in the counter window. Every single one of them was sold as gemstones.A defective spirit stone was enough for a Xiantian sixth layer martial artist like Xiang Nan to replenish the weather twice.However, looking at the price tag of \"five hundred gold coins\", Xiang Nan was a little discouraged.At this moment, there was only some change in his storage ring, and if he put it together, it would only cost around 1,300 gold coins.\" Young Master do you want to see the defective spirit stones?\" The waiter smiled as he spoke.Xiang Nan nodded awkwardly and said, \"I want two.\"At the same time, he thought to himself, if he had known earlier, he would have left more money with him. Last time, he had given all of the millions of gold coins to his grandfather, and he had only left this little bit. It was not enough to spend.\"Just two? Do you want a few more?\" The waiter rubbed his hands and urged.Xiang Nan was so embarrassed. He thought to himself, \"How could this guy not be sensible?\" He said, \"Two is enough.\"\"Oh? Isn't this Xiang Nan?\" Just as he was speaking, an ear-piercing voice came from the door.Xiang Nan followed the direction and saw three eighteen or nineteen-year-old young men. Their faces were somewhat familiar.When Xiang Nan looked at the person who spoke, he remembered that when he was fighting Li Qingchuan in Welcome Street a few days ago, these kids were following Mo Hai and the others.Liked it?

He only bought two spirit stones? Isn't that too shabby?\"The other two laughed loudly, \"Yes, Brother Zhang, why don't you give Young Master Xiang Nan some Copper Flower Flowers?\"The one known as Brother Zhang was a Xiantian seventh layer martial artist. At his age, this kind of realm was pretty good.\"Fuck off.\" Xiang Nan frowned, \"I'm not in the mood to waste my breath with you.\"Xiang Nan knew very well why there were always people looking for trouble with him.Amongst their peers, no one dared to shout at Xiang Nan. The key was these three or four-year-old fellows from Da Xiang Nan.It was like in a school, when the senior students heard that the junior students were very arrogant, they would definitely step on it because they were unwilling to accept it.\"Keep your mouth clean.\" Brother Zhang's smile cooled down as he said in a gloomy voice, \"You didn't ask around. Who doesn't know that I, Zhang Ming, am with Brother Mo Hai in Blue Stone City?\"\"So?\" Xiang Nan looked at Zhang Ming indifferently, \"Moving out of Mo Hai to scare me?\"Zhang Ming smiled sinisterly and said, \"Looks like I, Brother Li Qingchuan, didn't teach you enough that day.\"Xiang Nan hugged his shoulders and said, \"Even if Li Qingchuan comes now, I will make him suffer.\"\"What a big breath!\" Zhang Ming pointed at Xiang Nan's nose and loudly said, \"I will pass these words on to Brother Li. I will keep them for you \u2026\"Zhang Ming had seen Xiang Nan and Li Qingchuan make a move. He knew very well that he was no match for Xiang Nan, so he only wanted to humiliate Xiang Nan with words.However, Xiang Nan was too lazy to talk nonsense with this kind of dog. He immediately shouted in a low voice, \"Get out!\"With that, Xiang Nan slapped the ground with his right hand.The weather condensed into palm power and suddenly exploded about an inch from the ground. A wave of air instantly knocked the three of them out of the door.The three of them crawled up like they had seen a ghost.Zhang Ming was shocked, \"Xiantian sixth layer? Weren't you at Xiantian third layer a few days ago? Why did you cross three small realms in just a few days?\"At the side, the waiter changed his attitude and said respectfully, \"It's Young Master Xiang Nan, right? Our young miss has already instructed that if it's you, the spirit stones in the shop can be taken at will, and you don't have to pay for it.\"\"Oh? I see.\" Hearing this, Xiang Nan thought to himself that Miss Ruyan was really thoughtful. She actually guessed that she would use spirit stones.He thought of the Huangpu Clan's enormous inheritance. This little spirit stone was indeed nothing, so he was not polite.Even if he wanted ten low-grade spirit stones.Low-grade spirit stones were ten times more expensive than defective spirit stones, and their effects were ten times more effective. A low-grade spirit stone was enough for Xiang Nan to fill his dantian with spiritual energy twenty times.These ten low-grade spirit stones were worth 50,000 gold coins, enough for Xiang Nan to use 200 times.\"Thank your young miss for me.\" Xiang Nan put away the spirit stones and said to the waiter, \"I'll pay her a visit another day.\"The waiter immediately smiled and said, \"You go well.\"Xiang Nan walked out of the spirit stone shop and swept his eyes across the street. The three of them were staring at him covetously across the street.Who would have thought that Zhang Ming would not change his character and dare to be so domineering after suffering a loss?But then, Xiang Nan knew why Zhang Ming was acting like this, because behind Zhang Ming, a burly figure walked out.\"Mo Hai.\" Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes as he thought to himself, \"These troublesome flies can't be thrown away no matter what.\"\"Xiang Nan, we meet again.\" Mo Hai crossed his shoulders, and the muscles between his arms bulged high, containing a rich amount of strength.\"Is something the matter?\" Xiang Nan asked because Mo Hai had already blocked his path with the three of them.\"Brother Hai, it's this brat!\" Zhang Ming stood beside Mo Hai and gritted his teeth. Obviously, he looked like he had found a backer, so he pretended to be a tiger.Mo Haixia looked at Xiang Nan and said, \"You really are a troublemaker. You provoke wherever you go.\"Xiang Nan sneered, \"It's clearly your dog that bit people first. I advise you to properly train it so that you don't bite people you can't provoke.\"\"You dare to call me a dog!\" Zhang Ming was furious and raised his hand to slap Xiang Nan's face.Xiang Nan flipped his left hand, his palm condensing a tyrannical Xiantian slapping towards Zhang Ming.\"Retreat!\" Mo Hai pushed Zhang Ming away, and then he also took out his palm. The huge palm was connected to Xiang Nan's.The speed of these two people's palm strikes was very slow. The most important thing was the condensed weather in their palms.As the two of them clasped hands together, Xiang Nan immediately became more cautious. This Mo Hai was called the number one expert of his age, and it definitely wouldn't be too simple.On the other hand, Mo Hai had a confident look on his face. He had clearly decided to eat Xiang Nan.There was a fierce contest between the two's palms in the dark.Xiang Nan did not underestimate his opponent from the beginning and poured into Mo Hai's entire arm in a fierce and brutal manner.However, right after that, he felt that there was a dense and vast weather in Mo Hai's palm, and it was as calm as a mountain, continuously devouring it in the opposite direction.\"Fire attribute.\" Xiang Nan frowned. His previous weather had actually been suppressed by Mo Hai!Moreover, Mo Hai's previous weather was actually fire attribute, and he had been refined to such an old age by Mo Hai.\"Huh?\" Mo Hai was also shocked. A strange light flashed in his eyes, \"Your cultivation has actually improved greatly.\"Xiang Nan thought to himself, this Mo Hai was much harder to deal with than Li Qingchuan! Thinking of this, he couldn't help but increase his strength.He used his full strength of five successes to fight against Mo Hai, pushing back Mo Hai's torrential incoming Xiantian once again.Mo Hai's expression was solemn, but when he saw his right arm tremble slightly, a magnificent Xiantian rushed back.Both of them were shocked. Xiang Nan did not expect that Mo Hai's strength would far exceed his previous expectations. Could it be that this person's fire attribute talent was spiritual?Mo Hai furrowed his brows. He was at the late Xiantian ninth stage! He was about to advance to the Origin Realm soon, but today, he couldn't get any advantage from Xiang Nan, a Xiantian sixth layer kid.\"Xiang Nan, good move.\" As Mo Hai spoke, he began to move his true form.As he spoke, Xiang Nan could clearly feel that Mo Hai's weather had changed! Then Mo Hai used a cultivation technique!Xiang Nan immediately felt that something was wrong. Mo Hai's first wave after wave of weather pounced on him. He struggled hard to destroy the first wave, but he knew that the second wave was even more powerful than the first wave. He was full of energy.Xiang Nan had really suffered a hidden loss, and he was almost unable to withstand it.The reason was that although Xiang Nan also had a cultivation method, his only cultivation method was the Nine Transformations of Thunder! This Nine Transformations of Thunder was not used to attack, but to absorb the Divine Thunder Lightning Source.Liked it?

He was about to be blown away by Mo Hai in the next second.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and couldn't care less. He immediately pulled out a trace of lightning power from his body.That Mo Hai's fire attribute was first the weather, coupled with the addition of a powerful cultivation technique. Although it was berserk, the power of flammable lightning was even more berserk than berserk!In that instant, the power of lightning was like a bolt of lightning snake, crazily destroying Mo Hai's fifth wave, followed by the sixth wave!Seeing that Xiang Nan was about to win, Mo Hai's gaze became complicated. His gaze was first shocked, then decisive!As for Mo Hai's weather, the moment he was about to retreat, it suddenly transformed into a wondrous state, and its power rushed back like a storm!\"Yuan Qi?\" Xiang Nan's heart shook! Then Mo Hai's previous weather was actually able to transform into Yuan Qi?No, this isn't Yuan Qi, it's just a transitional stage from the weather to Yuan Qi.But even so, this kind of semi-primordial energy and semi-primordial weather was much more powerful than the pure primordial weather!Even when they heard a muffled boom, Xiang Nan and Mo Hai both took three steps back.Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes, his left arm trembling uncontrollably, and he had some misgivings about Mo Hai.Xiantian and Yuan Qi were two completely different things! At this moment, Mo Hai should already be at the half-step Origin Realm.Mo Hai's right hand also twitched slightly. The expression on his face was indescribable, because he couldn't understand why Xiang Nan's weather was so vicious.\"I admire you, I admire you.\" Mo Hai was the first to speak. He cupped his fists at Xiang Nan and said, \"Little brother Xiang Nan's strength is unfathomably hidden. Thank you for showing mercy that day and not hurting Qing Chuan.\"It seemed that Mo Hai thought that when Xiang Nan fought Li Qingchuan, he had deliberately concealed his realm and strength. Otherwise, how could a person have risen from the Xiantian 3rd layer to the 6th layer in just a few days?\"In the town election, you defeated three experts of the same age on your own. That makes sense.\"Xiang Nan looked at Mo Hai as if he was facing a great enemy. He replied, \"We are each other. Brother Mo Hai is also extraordinarily strong.\"Mo Hai smiled faintly and said, \"We haven't decided yet. Why don't we leave this suspense in the Martial Arts City's selection in twenty days?\"\"I have this intention. Goodbye.\" Xiang Nan nodded. He turned around and left. He had already found out Mo Hai's true strength, so there was no need to waste his breath.But before Xiang Nan could go far, Mo Hai suddenly said to Xiang Nan's back, \"But Xiang Nan, I advise you to be more tactful. She's not your woman. Don't provoke her. Stay as far away from Wang Jingyun as possible.\"Xiang Nan's back paused for a moment. Originally, he wanted to explain, but after thinking for a while, he and Wang Jingyun couldn't get along, so there was no need.After returning to the Xiang manor, Xiang Nan greeted him and hurriedly left. He only told his family that Martial Dao City was about to be chosen and that he was going to cultivate in seclusion for a period of time.\"Huh? Young Master Xiang wants to borrow my manor?\" Huangpu Ruyan put on her iconic black veil again.\"Yes, the training grounds in your manor are very good. I want to borrow them for a few days.\" Xiang Nan told the truth.Ruyan said, \"Do you want to cultivate the Flash Shadow Steps?\"\"Miss Ruyan is smart.\" Xiang Nan laughed.After a Black Sharp Yao Sen expedition, the relationship between the two of them became very familiar.\"That manor was originally my usual resting place.\" As Ruyan spoke, her tone was a little sad, \"In a few days, I will bring Yu'er back to the clan to seek a better recuperation environment for her.\"\"Then the manor will be given to you, Young Master Xiang.\"Xiang Nan was stunned and said, \"Miss Ruyan is leaving now? Why don't you stay a few more days?\"Ruyan suddenly stood up and bowed to Xiang Nan Yingying.Xiang Nan hurriedly went forward to help, but was interrupted by Ruyan.Ruyan whispered, \"Thank you, Young Master Xiang, for exposing the secrets of your talent and healing my sister. Such a great kindness will never be forgotten by Ruyan. However, there is no banquet in the world that will not end. In the end, we have to part ways.\"Xiang Nan's gaze softened a lot as he sighed, \"Miss Ruyan, you don't have to be so courteous. I like Little Yu'er very much myself. Even if you didn't ask for it, I wouldn't ignore her.\"Ruyan's eyes turned red and she said, \"Yes, I know.\"Xiang Nan thought for a moment and then said, \"I just remembered that Miss Ruyan and I still have a feast to finish. Why don't we have a drink together tonight?\"Ruyan took off her black veil and smiled sweetly at Xiang Nan.That night, Xiang Nan and Lady Ruyan went to the manor, borrowing the night to enjoy the wine.Xiang Nan was originally not from a small place, and Ruyan came from a wealthy family. The two of them were actually more and more speculative when they talked. They discovered that there were too many similarities between them, and there were always endless things to be said.However, the more this happened, the more sentimental the departure of Miss Ruyan became.\"Ruyan, a toast to Young Master.\" Ruyan picked up her wine glass and said to Xiang Nan, \"Young Master and I met each other the same time. I only hate that we met too late.\"Xiang Nan gave Ruyan a brilliant smile, \"The ancients had clouds, and I heard that dying at night is fine. Although this sentence is not appropriate to describe you and me, this is my current state of mind.\"After toasting this glass of wine, the two of them, who were originally unable to finish their words and chatting, fell silent.The night was intoxicating, but the wine was not intoxicating. The two of them drank back and forth until dawn. In the end, neither of them remembered what they had said.It was dawn and Xiang Nan woke up from his drunkenness, only to find that Miss Ruyan had already left.Xiang Nan simply washed his face and thought to himself, Miss Ruyan is leaving in a few days. I wonder if I can catch up with her and see her again before she leaves.Thus, Xiang Nan entered the underground secret training room alone.After placing the ten low-grade spirit stones, he took a deep breath into the large training room and said, \"No matter what, you should quickly practice the Flash Shadow Steps!\"As soon as he finished speaking, the ground beneath his feet trembled slightly. Immediately after, he turned into an afterimage and rushed out.At this moment, Xiang Nan felt great pressure in his heart, because he realized that he had underestimated the experts of the same age in Blue Stone City.After witnessing Mo Hai's strength, Xiang Nan's heart became much heavier than usual. He realized that Mo Hai definitely had a trump card! He would never reveal his full strength in a single clash with him.And there were countless hidden experts like Mo Hai, at least Li Qingchuan was still hiding part of his strength.If he could cultivate to the seventh level of the Xiantian realm before the Martial Arts City Selection, then he would be more confident.As such, Xiang Nan was cultivating in this secret training room day after day.Liked it?

One day was divided into two halves. Half of it was used to cultivate the Flash Shadow Steps, and the other half was used to cultivate his own realm.The Flash Shadow Steps used up all of the early weather before absorbing spirit stones. The upgrade of their cultivation realms was in conjunction with the medicinal pills he had collected.However, during this period of time, he discovered a very serious problem! That was his previous realm, which seemed to have risen too quickly! So much so that he actually encountered a bottleneck in the late Xiantian sixth stage!The bottleneck was very difficult to overcome, especially because he had consumed too many pills and had a strong resistance to them. If he continued to eat them, their significance would become very small.Ten days later, there were still ten days left before the Martial Arts City Selection.In the beautiful manor, a figure suddenly appeared!The shadow appeared beside the rockery, but in the next moment, it blurred and disappeared! It was already at the entrance of the manor.\"En!\" Xiang Nan took a deep breath. He clenched his fists and said, \"The Shadow Steps have been practiced to perfection. The talent of this divine grade is indeed incomparably powerful.\"\"It's a pity that my cultivation level is still stagnant. It's useless to consume more pills. I have to cultivate through nature to increase my cultivation level.\"\"If we can find a good place with rich spiritual energy, it will be perfect.\"There are three ways for martial artists to increase their cultivation. One is to naturally absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the other is to consume medicinal pills with better effects, and the last is to increase their cultivation during battles.The best place to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was where the spiritual energy was abundant.Thinking of this, Xiang Nan couldn't help but sigh. The places with dense Spiritual Qi were usually spirit caves and spirit mountains, but those places were all controlled by various sects.In Wolong Province, it seemed that they had never heard of such a place.\"I hope that there will be some new harvests in the last ten days.\" Xiang Nan stepped onto the Wind Chasing Stallion and rushed back to the Xiang Clan.As soon as Xiang Nan returned to his mansion, he was stopped by Xiang Zhonghua and ran away, \"Cousin, you're back! Come with me, something big has happened at home!\"\"What's the big deal?\" Xiang Nanqi said.\"Don't ask me. Follow me to the reception hall and tell me that the Xiang Clan has been in a mess for the past ten days since you left!\" Xiang Zhonghua was both anxious and dry. He looked like an ant in a hot pot.Xiang Nan couldn't help but frown. This was truly a troublesome autumn. Troubles came one after another. Could it be that my small Xiang Clan would encounter so many troubles if it wanted to rise?After arriving at the reception hall, the two of them discovered that all the elders of the clan had arrived, including even the younger generation's peers.\" Little Nan ! You're back!\" When Xiang Shaohua saw Xiang Nan, he immediately stood up.\"What's going on?\" Xiang Nan looked at everyone strangely. He found that everyone was looking at him as if he had caused a great disaster.Xiang Shaohua said, \"Didn't our Xiang Clan plan to restart their own business? Not long ago, we ordered a large amount of ores, armor, and spirit prairie materials from a few large suppliers in Bluestone City.\"\"Yes.\" Xiang Nan felt even more puzzled. If his family wanted to run the weapons and armor business, they naturally needed to purchase large quantities of raw materials.Xiang Shaohua stomped his foot anxiously and said, \"But they \u2026 they collectively went back on their word! They did not hesitate to pay a high penalty for breach of contract and no longer provided us with raw materials.\"\"Then why?\" Xiang Nan was shocked. Without ores and raw materials, they were still in the weapons business. Without fur and spirit prairie materials, they could simply close the shop.\"Because of Qian Ling'er.\" Xiang Shaohua looked at Xiang Nan reproachfully.\"Qian Ling'er? Who is that?\" Xiang Nan was a little dumbfounded.When Xiang Shaohua heard this, he anxiously said, \" little Nan , you are too foolish. Why did you forget what you did? Then the Qian Clan sent people to propose marriage!\"\"You should at least say hello to us about this so that we can have some time to prepare.\"\"Qian Ling'er, propose marriage?\" Xiang Nan was puzzled, \"Where are we going? Where did Qian Ling'er come from? What kind of kiss did she bring up?\"\"That's true.\" Xiang Zhanxiong interrupted Xiang Shaohua and said to Xiang Nan, \"A few days ago, you were engaged to Qian Ling'er privately for life. The Qian family sent people to send out wedding stickers, hoping that our Xiang family would come to propose marriage.\"\"But what you don't know is that this matter has angered Cai Jianyun. Since Cai Jianyun and Qian Ling'er were childhood sweethearts, he has been furious.\"\"And Cai Jianyun is Cai Baohua's grandson. Cai Baohua is also one of the elders of our Blue Stone City Chamber of Commerce.\"At this point, Xiang Zhanxiong sighed and said, \"Cai Baohua threatened that unless our Xiang Clan lowered their heads to admit their mistake and cancel the engagement with the Qian Clan.\"\"Otherwise, they have already contacted a large number of suppliers. They will come to the Xiang Clan tonight to break the contract and deliver the contract payment. From now on, they will not provide any raw materials to the Xiang Clan.\"The entire Xiang Clan sighed. The Xiang Clan's path to rise was truly difficult.However, Xiang Nan frowned deeply, \"Wait, this matter is not right. I don't know any Qian Ling'er at all, and it's even more impossible for me to settle a lifetime relationship with her privately.\"\"What?\" Everyone from the Xiang Clan was dumbfounded.\"So it's a misunderstanding?\" The Great Elder heaved a sigh of relief and said, \"Since you and Qian Ling'er don't have that kind of relationship, then let's show our attitude. We won't marry the Qian Clan. Isn't this settled?\"\"No, it's not that simple.\" Xiang Nan shook his head and rejected the Great Elder's suggestion.The Great Elder said anxiously, \"Why not?\"Xiang Zhanxiong said, \"Indeed, it won't work. If news of this were to spread, it would be very unpleasant to hear. Others will definitely think that our Xiang Clan was frightened.\"Everyone suddenly realized, that's right! Others would definitely say that the Xiang Clan was so scared that they didn't even dare to propose marriage. They would lose face from this clan and be laughed at by everyone.This was because even though the Xiang Clan had been suppressed by the three great clans of Bluestone Town, they had never lowered their heads in their most desolate days. Xiang Zhanxiong had always stuck to the Xiang Clan.\" Little Nan .\" Xiang Zhanxiong said seriously, \"This matter must be treated well. What do you think?\"Xiang Nan took a deep breath and said, \"Since we haven't got engaged yet, it's not like we're going to renege on our engagement. I will definitely reject the Qian family, but not now.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan bowed deeply to the crowd, \"Grandfather, uncles, little Nan has caused trouble for the Xiang Clan. I will go to the Qian Clan to find out the cause and effect.\"After that, Xiang Nan rushed to the Qian Clan in Bluestone City with a stomach full of questions.The Qian Clan was one of the major clans in Bluestone City. It was a pure commercial clan. It had nothing to do with martial arts. Just talking about the wealth of the clan would definitely far exceed the so-called three great clans in Bluestone Town.As soon as Xiang Nan arrived at the Qian Clan, he was warmly welcomed. It seemed that they had already designated Xiang Nan as their uncle.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the Qian Clan, a commercial clan, could marry the Xiang Clan, it would be considered a good thing for them to have both merchants and martial artists.Soon, Xiang Nan saw Qian Ling'er.This was a young and energetic woman. She was seventeen years old, and she was exquisitely carved. She could also be considered a symbol of beauty.\"Young Master Xiang, you're here.\" Qian Ling'er's eyebrows were filled with spring, and she gave Xiang Nan into her boudoir with a little embarrassment.Xiang Nan looked at Qian Ling'er, who was a little embarrassed by her behavior, and he didn't know why. He said, \"Miss Qian, this marriage proposal \u2026\"Qian Ling'er's eyes were lowered and her cheeks were flushed red. She whispered, \"Young Master Xiang's performance since the beginning of the town has been very attractive. Ling'er can be considered to have secretly admired Young Master Xiang.\"Xiang Nan didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and said, \"If it was just like this, it wouldn't be to the point of proposing marriage, right?\"\"What \u2026\" Qian Ling'er's face turned pale. \"Is Young Master Xiang going back on his word?\" She asked in shock.\"What regret? I didn't know you before,\" Xiang Nan said.\"Xiang Nan still has one more thing to ask of you. I'll have to trouble Miss Qian to communicate with the Cai Clan and secretly resolve this misunderstanding.\"Xiang Nan thought very clearly. Reneging on this matter was clearly not good for the Xiang Clan. If the Qian Clan could resolve this misunderstanding with the Cai Clan, it would be considered that he had fulfilled Qian Ling'er and Cai Jianyun's wishes.Moreover, he didn't even know these two people, so there was no need to stir a stick between them.Who would have thought that Qian Ling'er's expression would be very ugly. She would turn green and then white. She hatefully shouted, \"Since Young Master Xiang is ruthless to me, why would he accept my spirit stones as gifts?\"\"My daughter's family took the initiative to express her goodwill to Young Master Xiang. You accepted my kindness as well. Isn't this a sign that you are willing to accept me?\"Hearing this, Xiang Nan really had ten thousand animals running through his heart! My God, that spirit stone was not given to me by Miss Ruyan, but by Qian Ling'er!\"This \u2026 this is a big misunderstanding.\" Xiang Nan didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He shook his head and said, \"I thought it was another woman \u2026\"\"Good good good, another woman!\" Who would have thought that Qian Ling'er would be even angrier after hearing this? She pointed at the door and said, \"Young Master Xiang, please leave! I won't send you off!\"Xiang Nan came for no reason and was inexplicably chased out of the Qian Manor.This matter caused a misunderstanding, and Xiang Nan did not know what to say. He could only return to the Xiang Clan to talk about it helplessly.This time, it was dark.After arriving in the Xiang manor, he discovered that the large reception hall was filled with people, and the City Lord had also come. At this moment, he was sitting on the first seat chatting with Xiang Zhanxiong.\"Lord City Lord, you're here.\" Xiang Nan greeted the City Lord.Hong Zhen saw Xiang Nan and said, \"Well, I've heard that the Bluestone Chamber of Commerce is going to boycott the Xiang Clan. It's a big fuss.\"\"I'm here this time to help the Xiang Clan talk things over and see if I can reconcile their relationship.\"\"However\" Hong Zhen's words changed and he suddenly smiled, \"It seems that not only did Xiang Nan offend many martial artists of the same age, he also attracted many women of the same age.\"Xiang Nan didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He said, \"Lord City Lord, since when are you joking? This matter concerns the life and death of our Xiang Clan.\"The three great clans of Bluestone Town were able to suppress the Xiang Clan, but if the Bluestone Chamber of Commerce wanted to set up the Xiang Clan, it was really a big deal.Hong Zhen also became serious, \"I will try my best to help you reconcile. However, that old man Cai Baohua's temper is notoriously bad. I'm afraid he won't let the Xiang Clan off easily.\"\"Elder Cai of the Blue Stone Merchant Guild is here!\"Immediately after, a large group of people walked in. The one leading them was one of the elders of the Bluestone Merchant Guild, Cai Baohua!Beside Cai Baohua was a rather handsome young man, and this person was Cai Baohua's grandson, Cai Jianyun.Everyone on the scene stood up to greet him, and even the City Lord himself stood up.However, Cai Baohua was so powerful that he ignored the crowd and walked straight to the deepest part of the reception hall without looking sideways.Someone from the Xiang Clan hurriedly added a main seat. Cai Baohua snorted and sat down with his golden saber.The large group of people that followed Cai Baohua were the suppliers of raw materials from various fields in Blue Stone City.This group of people were eyeing him covetously, not giving the Xiang Clan a good look at all.\"You are Xiang Nan!\" Before Cai Baohua could say anything, his grandson, Cai Jianyun, suddenly pointed at Xiang Nan and said. He was acting like a high-ranking person pointing at a servant.When Xiang Nan was pointed at by Cai Jianyun, his heart was filled with anger. He said, \"I am Xiang Nan.\"Cai Jianyun's face was gloomy as he said, \"What a mighty presence! I heard that you wanted to touch Mo Hai's woman a few days ago and had a fight with her on the street.\"\"What, you're scared of being beaten up, and you're turning around to touch my woman? Xiang Nan, as a martial artist, if you don't cultivate martial arts properly, you're still playing around all day, what kind of man are you!\"These words were extremely unpleasant to hear!Xiang Nan frowned and said, \"I advise you to keep your mouth clean. This matter \u2026\"Cai Jianyun interrupted Xiang Nan with a wave of his hand and shouted, \"You don't dare to provoke Mo Hai, but you dare to provoke me? Xiang Nan, you're blind!\"\"Mo Hai is indeed the number one expert in this age group, but you must know that my strength can be ranked second!\"\"Furthermore, that Mo Hai is only an expert from this town, and I, Cai Jianyun, have a much wider network than him, Mo Hai!\"Cai Jianyun pointed at Xiang Nan's nose and shouted, \"Believe it or not, if I let go of this sentence, all the people of Wudao City's age will listen to my orders and kill you together!\"Originally, Xiang Nan was worried about the future of the clan and wanted to say something good, but now that Cai Jianyun was barking at him with a dog's eye, he couldn't help but feel his heart.Xiang Nan was furious and said in a low voice, \"Is that so? Bring your horses over, and I'll wait for you to destroy me!\"\"Alright!\" Cai Jianyun smiled sinisterly and said, \"Now, you're going to kneel down and beg for mercy.\"\"Alright, alright.\" Hong Zhen hurriedly stepped out to make things right. He laughed and said, \"Young people are full of vitality. Everyone, suppress your anger. If you have something to say, you can speak slowly.\"\"Old Master Cai.\" Hong Zhen looked at Cai Baohua and said, \"You're so old, don't be too angry. Just leave the young man's affairs to the young man. Why are you trying to move so many people?\"\"Everyone is doing business for money. If there's anything you can't sit down and talk about, why do you have to make a scene?\"Cai Baohua smiled and said, \"Lord City Lord is right. Then I'll have a good chat with his Xiang Clan.\"\"Patriarch Xiang.\" Cai Baohua's eyes fell on Xiang Zhanxiong.Xiang Zhanxiong nodded slightly, \"Elder Cai.\"Cai Baohua lifted the lid of the cup and said, \"I have two choices for you.\"Liked it?

At the same time, the Xiang Clan must swear in front of everyone that they will never think of hitting on Qian Ling'er again.\"Xiang Zhanxiong was a First Grade martial artist, and his anger wasn't any worse than that of a young man! He immediately laughed out loud, \"The second one!\"Cai Baohua sneered, \"Second of all, you can continue to do as you please, but I can guarantee that from now on, there will be no place for your Xiang Clan in the entire Blue Stone City!\"\"Haha!\" Xiang Nan laughed angrily and shouted, \"I choose the second one! I want to see how you drive my Xiang Clan out of Bluestone City!\"\"Don't say that there's nothing between me and Qian Ling'er. Even if there is something, it's not your turn to come to our Xiang Clan to act wildly!\"Xiang Zhanxiong stood up and nodded at Xiang Nan, expressing his full support for Xiang Nan's opinion, even at a painful price!\" Little Nan !\" Hong Zhen suddenly stood up and said, \"Don't be impulsive! Let's have a good talk \u2026\"\"City Lord, there's no need to say anything.\" Cai Baohua also stood up. He looked at Xiang Nan and said, \"Alright! I admire your young man for being angry and courageous. He dares to say such presumptuous words to me!\"\"However, I advise you to walk through your brain before you speak and weigh yourself a few kilograms and a few taels.\"\"Come on!\"Immediately, eight suppliers stood out from the crowd. The eight suppliers cupped their fists and cupped their hands at Xiang Zhanxiong at the same time, saying, \"Clan Head Xiang, I'm sorry.\"\"This is the raw materials trading contract we signed with the Xiang Clan.\"Eight people handed over eight contracts.One of the suppliers said on behalf of the others, \"Today, we will tear this contract apart. We will pay not less than a cent of the liquidated damages.\"\"And in the future, your Xiang Clan will no longer think of doing business with us. We will no longer accept any cooperation intentions from the Xiang Clan.\"The scene went deathly silent. Everyone watched helplessly. The eight suppliers tore the contract apart on the spot, tore it like snow and threw it all over the sky.\"It's not just the eight of them.\" Cai Baohua sneered and waved his hand, \"Today, apart from the eight suppliers, I've also found all the leading and respected suppliers in Blue Stone City.\"The group of suppliers expressed their stance one after another, saying, \"We obey Old Master Cai's instructions and will no longer have any cooperation with the Xiang family in the future.\"\"How is it.\" Cai Baohua looked at Xiang Zhanxiong and said, \"Do you regret it? Follow me again! Follow me again!\"Xiang Nan looked at his grandfather, Xiang Zhanxiong, with a guilty expression.However, Xiang Zhanxiong laughed loudly, \"Regret? I, Xiang Zhanxiong, have never regretted it! Since you've come to find my grandson Xiang Nan's misfortune, I, Xiang Zhanxiong, will sacrifice all of my family business to waste with you, so what's the harm?\"Pa pa pa!The sound of applause came from outside the door, followed by a vigorous and powerful shout, \"Old Master Xiang is so courageous! I admire you!\"Everyone looked at the door in unison, only to see another group of people strode in with their heads held high.The two people in front of him were a man and a woman. The man was about seventy or eighty years old, and his face was flushed red. His temperament was definitely something that could only be cultivated after he had been in the upper echelons for a long time.As for the woman, she was actually\"Miss Ruyan?\" Xiang Nan's eyes twitched and he said, \"Why are you here?\"That woman was precisely Ruyan, and from behind her, a small shadow appeared playfully.\"Brother Xiang Nan, Little Yu'er has come to see you.\"Xiang Nan couldn't help but laugh, \"Alright, big brother will treat Little Yu'er to a sweet fruit later.\"\"Really? I want to eat ten!\" Little Yu'er's cute eyes widened.They were talking to each other, but the others were a little shocked.\"Old Master Duan.\" Cai Baohua was overjoyed and hurriedly said to the old man beside Ruyan, \"Why are you here? Haha, it's enough to deal with the Xiang Clan with me here. I don't need to trouble you to come personally.\"The suppliers hurriedly cupped their fists and bowed, \"Old Master Duan.\"As he spoke, Cai Baohua also noticed Ruyan. Immediately after, his expression changed slightly!Everyone else saw the details that Cai Baohua had seen!Old Master Duan was the boss behind the Fortune Gathering Pavilion and also the elder of the Bluestone Merchant Guild.He was an elder! Not an elder like Cai Baohua!What caused everyone's expressions to change was that Old Master Duan actually took half a step back from Ruyan!Doesn't that mean that this woman has a higher status than Old Master Duan?Although everyone was shocked by the identity of the mysterious woman with the black veil on her face, they all agreed that the Xiang Clan was truly going to die this time!This time, Cai Baohua had moved Old Master Duan out. No matter how capable the Xiang Clan was, they had to obediently lie down!At this moment, the old man smiled at Cai Baohua and cupped his fists, \"Elder Cai, long time no see. However, this time, this old man is not here to punish the Xiang Clan.\"\"I want to introduce an important person to everyone.\" Old Master Duan took another half step back and extended his hand towards Ruyan, saying, \"This person is our backstage owner, an important figure of the Huangpu Aristocratic Family, Miss Ruyan.\"\"Oh, so it's Miss Ruyan.\" Cai Baohua tried his best to squeeze out a smile and hurriedly greeted Ruyan, but his eyes clearly carried an inexplicable expression of shock.For many people who weren't high enough, they didn't know the meaning of the words \"Huangpu Aristocrat Clan\".However, Cai Baohua had heard of it. He knew that the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan was an incomparably powerful existence in the Blue Tide Continent and even the Nine Firmaments Continent.However, Cai Baohua could not tell how powerful the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan was. He had only heard about it.All the suppliers at the scene kept a secret and respectful attitude towards Ruyan. They did not know about the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan, but they could see Old Man Duan's attitude towards Ruyan.Ruyan said lightly through the black veil, \"Elder Duan, can you leave the right to speak here to me?\"Old Master Duan smiled and bowed deeply, \"I'll listen to your orders.\"Such a deep bow caused everyone's hearts to beat fiercely!\"City Lord.\" Ruyan gently walked towards the main seat of the throne.Hong Zhen laughed loudly, \"Miss Ruyan, please sit down!\"As he spoke, he secretly glanced at Xiang Nan and thought to himself that the Xiang Clan had been saved this time!\"Brother Xiang Nan, what are you guys doing? Let's go eat some fruit.\" Little Yu'er jumped up and down to Xiang Nan's side and used her small hand to pull the corner of Xiang Nan's clothes in a spoiled manner.Xiang Nan touched Little Yu'er's hair and said, \"Yu'er, be good. Big brother will take you there later.\"'\"Miss Ruyan has personally come. I really can't afford to be someone like you.\" Cai Baohua said respectfully to Ruyan.Beside him, Cai Jianyun proudly raised his head, his expression clearly saying, \"Look!\" My grandfather has great face! He had attracted such a noble person as Miss Ruyan.Ruyan said expressionlessly, \"Of course you can't afford it.\"\"Ah?\" Cai Baohua was stunned, but he still hadn't reacted.Liked it?

The heroic words just now made Ruyan admire him very much.\"\"With you here, the Xiang Clan will definitely rise to prominence in the future.\"This was the first time Xiang Zhanxiong had seen Ruyan. Before he knew where this woman came from, he said politely, \"You're flattering me.\"At this point, the atmosphere at the scene changed again. Everyone seemed to see something different from Ruyan's different attitudes towards Cai Baohua and Xiang Zhanxiong.Miss Ruyan smiled at Xiang Zhanxiong and said, \"Seeing you, I know why Xiang Nan is so outstanding.\"As she spoke, Ruyan waved her hand and Elder Duan of the Chamber of Commerce respectfully handed over a pile of papers.Ruyan stood up with the paper in her hand and looked down at the eight suppliers, saying, \"Just now, it was you who tore the contract with the Xiang family.\"Those eight supplier representatives, looked at each other. They don't know how to deal with her, so they can only nod and say yes.Ruyan couldn't see the slightest smile on her face. She flipped through the paper in her hand page by page and said indifferently, \"If I'm not mistaken, the boundaries used by your eight clans are all rented from our Huangpu Aristocrat Clan.\"\"At the same time, the raw materials you wholesale are all from our Huangpu Aristocrat Clan.\"\"Yes\" A supplier representative hesitated for a moment. Actually, they had rented it from Old Master Duan. But now, it seemed that Old Master Duan was a subordinate of Ruyan.After a long time, these suppliers were Old Master Duan's channels, purchasing raw materials from other provinces. In other words, Ruyan was their top supply chain!\"En, since it is, then it will be easy.\" Ruyan's eyes suddenly became sharp. She spread the paper in her hand and said, \"These are your lease agreements.\"As soon as she finished speaking, a fierce ball of Yuan Qi erupted from her right hand. That Yuan Qi turned into Yuan Qi flames and instantly burned the eight contracts to ashes!She looked down at the eight people from above. The contract had just been burned by her, and then she lost eight more gold coin storage cards. She said, \"I burned the lease, and I will not provide you with any channels to purchase it in the future.\"\"Take your penalty and scram out of Blue Stone City!\"The faces of the eight suppliers instantly changed drastically. All of them looked miserable and almost burst into tears.\"Fuck off.\" Ruyan lightly spat out a word. Her right hand pressed down, and a fierce aura surged out, sending the eight suppliers flying out of the door.Everyone in the Xiang Clan was overjoyed.\"And you guys.\" Ruyan took a thick stack of contracts from Old Master Duan and swept her gaze over the other suppliers that followed Cai Baohua.The suppliers were all frightened out of their wits.Ruyan said, \"You came to help the Cai Clan and suppress the Xiang Clan together? That's good. If I'm not mistaken, nine out of ten of your raw materials were purchased from our Huangpu Clan.\"\"Nianzai, you guys are just here to watch the show. Let's cut the supply of raw materials to you by half. We'll see how you perform in three months.\"\"Do you understand what I mean?\"\"I understand!\" The suppliers wiped away their cold sweat and nodded repeatedly.Judging from her performance? What are they looking at? It was clear from her attitude towards the Xiang Clan that if anyone dared to make things difficult for the Xiang Clan, their fate would definitely be as miserable as the eight suppliers just now.\"Then\" Ruyan's gaze tilted to the left and landed on Cai Baohua.At this moment, Cai Baohua was dumbfounded and hadn't reacted yet.He thought that Old Master Duan and Ruyan were here to help him, but who would have thought that they would stand up for the Xiang Clan!What was even more unexpected was that Ruyan was a nail! Hard nail! He kicked the nail with one kick.Ruyan looked at Cai Baohua and said, \"Half of the merits of the Blue Stone Merchant Guild's establishment came from Elder Duan.\"\"Yes, yes.\" Cai Baohua hurriedly nodded.Ruyan said, \"Looks like you've been sitting in the position of an elder for too long. Have you forgotten your identity and responsibilities?\"\"Using private power to suppress a clan? Haha, it's really impressive.\"\"In my opinion \u2026\" Miss Ruyan's eyes suddenly turned cold as she said, \"You should give the position of elder to Xiang Zhanxiong and the Xiang Clan's Clan Head.\"Cai Baohua fell back to his seat, his entire face deathly pale.The scene was completely silent, and even the City Lord was shocked! He really didn't expect Ruyan, this weak woman, to act so decisively and ruthlessly and act so swiftly.\"This\" Cai Baohua's voice was filled with tears. If he were no longer an elder of the Chamber of Commerce, his current status would be greatly reduced.\"Why?\" Ruyan said indifferently, \"Today, I will tell you why.\"\"Because Young Master Xiang Nan Xiang is my benefactor.\" Ruyan's face turned into a thick smile. She looked at Xiang Nan and said, \"Whoever dares to provoke Young Master Xiang will provoke me.\"\"And whoever provokes me, I will make him suffer!\"No one dared to say another word at the scene, that Ruyan was simply a thunderbolt! Whoever dared to touch her brows would explode.Ruyan looked around the crowd, \"Is there anyone else who wants to deal with the Xiang Clan?\"The scene was completely silent.Ruyan nodded, \"Since there is no such thing, why are you still staying?\"\"Yes, yes, Miss Ruyan, Old Master Xiang, we still have matters to attend to. We'll be staying soon.\" Many suppliers panicked and ran away.Xiang Nan couldn't help but give Ruyan a thumbs up and thought to himself, Amazing! This is amazing!He had never seen Ruyan like this before. Normally, Ruyan smiled at Xiang Nan and spoke in an incomparably friendly tone.However, the mall was like a battlefield. Once they arrived at the mall, Ruyan immediately felt like a different person.Of course, her confidence and decisiveness also came from the strong foundation of the Huangpu Clan.The shopping mall was the same as the battlefield, so they naturally had the right to speak.\"Old Hero Xiang.\" Ruyan smiled at Xiang Zhanxiong and said, \"I know that you are a martial artist and don't have much time to manage the Chamber of Commerce.\"\"So, the position of Guild Leader is still yours, but you can recommend someone to temporarily help you succeed, okay?\"\"Good, good, good. Thank you, Miss Ruyan, for your kindness.\" Xiang Zhanxiong laughed heartily and said, \"Big brother, you should take over the position of Chamber of Commerce's Elder first.\"Great Elder was struck by lightning! The old man was stunned for a long time, but his eyes were still red. He bowed to Xiang Zhanxiong, \"Second Brother, we treated the Xiang Clan like this earlier, but you still \u2026\"Xiang Zhanxiong waved his hand and said, \"There is no need to mention the past. We are all bleeding from the Xiang Clan. We have broken bones and tendons.\"\"Yes, yes.\" The Great Elder smiled. His heart returned from the bottom of his heart. He firmly believed that no matter what happened in the future, he was born a member of the Xiang Clan, and death was also a ghost of the Xiang Clan.Liked it?

They were not excluded by Xiang Zhanxiong, but were sincerely accepted as relatives.\"Little brother Nan, it's all thanks to you.\" At this moment, Xiang Zhonghua and several other sisters of the same age were relieved of their grievances towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"They are all family members. You're welcome.\"Miss Ruyan walked down and said to Xiang Nan, \"Young Master Xiang, I have something to say. Shall we talk outside?\"\"Alright.\" Xiang Nan nodded and went out with Miss Ruyan and Little Yu'er.Outside the door, Ruyan stared at Xiang Nan's eyes with a faint smile, but did not say a word.Xiang Nan felt that although her eyes contained a smile, that smile made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.\"Miss Ruyan, if you have anything to say, just say it.\" Xiang Nan said awkwardly.Ruyan took a deep look at Xiang Nan and said, \"I heard that you are engaged to the Qian family's daughter.\"Xiang Nan was stunned and smiled bitterly, \"It's just a misunderstanding. I don't even know the Qian Clan's daughter.\"\"Oh, I see.\" Ruyan's smile did not change, but her tone seemed to relax.At this moment, a strong wind suddenly blew in the sky! Pairs of giant wings blotted out the sky and covered the sun!Hearing the howling wind, the Xiang family members in the reception hall, including the City Lord, rushed out together.Everyone looked up at the sky and saw that the sky was dark. Pairs of giant black wings appeared extremely shocking under the night sky!\"A flying demonic beast!\" The City Lord's pupils contracted.Those were enormous flying demonic beasts. They slowly descended from the high clouds. Some of the flying demonic beasts even snapped their noses and spat out surging flames from their mouths and noses.It was as if the black clouds had been burned.More than a dozen flying demonic beasts stopped in midair. Each of those demonic beasts had terrifying and shocking faces, and each of them possessed a demonic aura that covered the sky and the sun! It was actually comparable to a late Heavenly Yuan Realm expert.\"Hiss\" Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air!Where did these flying demonic beasts come from? If they wreaked havoc together, they would definitely be able to destroy the entire Blue Stone City within an hour.\"Miss, it's time.\" Old Master Duan said respectfully from the side.A touch of sadness flashed through Ruyan's eyes. She forced a smile on everyone's faces and said, \"Everyone, don't panic. It's my clansmen who came to pick me up.\"When Xiang Nan heard this, he sighed and said, \"Are we leaving now?\"Ruyan's eyes turned red as she cupped her fists at Xiang Nan and said, \"Young Master Xiang, there must be a separation between us.\"\"It's just \u2026 it's just that today's farewell, the mountain is far away. I wonder when we'll meet again.\"\"Young Master will participate in the city selection in ten days. At that time, he will definitely be chosen by the Martial Arts Sect and leave Bluestone City.\"\"In this way, the day of meeting is even more distant. The heavens and the earth are vast \u2026\"At this point, Ruyan choked up.Xiang Nan wanted to open his mouth, but was interrupted by Ruyan.Miss Ruyan continued, \"Ruyan is here. I wish Young Master Xiang great success and a bright future!\"Xiang Nan's heart was also extremely sad, but he insisted with a brilliant smile, \"Miss Ruyan, I also wish you a good reward. From now on, you will definitely enjoy the good fortune.\"\"I hope that you will go all the way \u2026\"Before Xiang Nan could spit out the word \"good\", Ruyan used two white onion fingers to cover her mouth.Ruyan looked deeply into Xiang Nan's eyes and said softly, \"Don't say goodbye.\"After saying that, Ruyan smiled with tears and took off her veil. She moved her head and lightly kissed the finger across Xiang Nan's mouth.After this kiss, Miss Ruyan's cheeks flushed red. She pulled back her fingers and pulled Little Yu'er into a beam of bright light that shot straight into the sky!In the sky, Little Yu'er's silvery laughter could be heard.\"Brother Xiang Nan, you still owe me ten sweet fruits.\"Xiang Nan stopped on the spot for a long time. Seeing the huge fleet of flying demonic beasts ascend into the clouds, his heart was filled with emotions, unable to say what it felt like.Behind him, the City Lord patted Xiang Nan on the shoulder and said, \"We're already far away.\"Xiang Nan turned around and smiled at the crowd. \"Everyone, come back. I'll be alone.\"After leaving the Xiang Clan, Xiang Nan returned to the manor that Ruyan had given him.It was still the same night and the same beautiful scenery, but today, Xiang Nan was once again alone.The betrayal of his beloved woman in his previous life caused Xiang Nan to lose all confidence in things like love. It could even be said that he was on high alert.He no longer believed in love at all, and he only felt endless gratitude towards Miss Ruyan in his heart.He drank alone in front of the moonlight.The night gradually darkened, and the wind gradually cooled.However, the intense sadness in Xiang Nan's heart gradually faded. He picked up his glass and said to himself, \"If I could go further and become stronger on the path of martial arts.\"\"Then, I will definitely meet Miss Ruyan again one day.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan raised his glass to Yue Gao and said, \"Miss Ruyan, thank you for taking care of me during this period of time in Blue Rock City.\"\"Here, you help me with everything. In the future, I, Xiang Nan, will definitely go through fire and water for you!\"In the woods, the Wind Chasing Colt snapped twice.After returning to the Xiang manor, it was already dawn, and Xiang Nan fell asleep. He had been cultivating hard for days, and he rarely had time to rest.He didn't feel tired during the excited days of cultivation, but now, he was completely relaxed, and his sleepiness instantly engulfed him.This sleep lasted from before dawn until night. When he woke up, there was a full moon hanging in the sky.\"I can't believe I've been asleep for so long.\" Xiang Nan stretched.\"Right, I've only been focusing on my own cultivation these past few days. I've forgotten how my grandfather's martial dao bottlenecks are. Let's go and see him.\"He simply cleaned up and pushed the door open.The moonlight fell on the small courtyard. A few simple flowers and plants, a small tree, were quite artistic.At this moment, Xiang Nan's mood was very relaxed. He recalled that many things had really happened between Miss Ruyan's appearance and her departure.Xiang Nan smiled sincerely and walked towards the arch of the courtyard.Right at this moment, a great sense of danger caused Xiang Nan's heart to pound!It was an invisible killing intent that enveloped Xiang Nan, causing Xiang Nan to feel an unprecedented crisis of death.Xiang Nan didn't even think about it and subconsciously used the Shadow Steps.The powerful Flash Shadow Steps caused him to turn into an afterimage and retreat in the blink of an eye.Almost at the same time as Xiang Nan retreated, an extremely sharp sword light suddenly came from the pitch-black night sky.Even though Xiang Nan dodged very quickly, the sword light still touched Xiang Nan's chest and brushed past him with extreme danger.Liked it?

Essence!\" Xiang Nan lowered his head and looked at the long robe cut off from his chest. He couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.After the sword light missed, it flew out and hit a stone table in the courtyard, as well as the courtyard wall behind it.\"So fast!\" Xiang Nan's pupils constricted. Fortunately, his Flash Steps had succeeded, but even so, he was only able to dodge the enemy's attack with the Flash Steps.Without any time to think, he immediately raised his head and looked into the night sky, trying to find the enemy who had ambushed him.However, with Xiang Nan's keen perception, he was unable to sense the enemy's Yuan Qi fluctuations, nor was he able to determine the enemy's realm, nor was he able to lock onto the enemy's location.This situation could only explain one problem, and that was, the enemy's martial arts realm had far surpassed Xiang Nan's!This was a very common and fatal phenomenon in the world of martial arts.Realm suppression!What was realm suppression?For example, if Xiang Nan was at the Xiantian 1st layer and could release 4,000 jin of power, and his enemy was at the Xiantian 6th layer and could also release 4,000 jin of power, then the one who would lose would be Xiang Nan.For example, if a rock was compared to a mountain, the material of the rock was the same, the density was the same, and the quality was the same. However, if the two collided, the winner would definitely be the mountain, not the stone.Every time the enemy was a small realm higher than their own, the effect of realm suppression would become even more obvious.Why was it that even though Xiang Nan's explosive power was extremely strong, it was still unable to obtain any benefits against Li Qingchuan and Mo Hai? A large part of the reason was because of the suppression of the realm.\"Damn it\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth. He knew that the enemy's realm far surpassed his own. Even if he risked his life, he could not be the enemy's opponent.As soon as Xiang Nan dodged the first sword light, he jumped onto the wall without hesitation.The slight tremor caused by his action caused another scene to appear.The stone table and the courtyard wall that had been sliced by the sword light had previously remained untouched. Now, after a jump from Xiang Nan, they were all broken apart!The stone table quietly split into two halves and fell to the ground. The wall of the courtyard also collapsed!This scene caused Xiang Nan's pupils to contract. When the courtyard wall collapsed, he once again jumped onto another wall and prepared to sprint towards the southeast.Southeast was where his grandfather, Xiang Zhanxiong, was.The enemy that had come to sneak attack him was at least above the Origin Realm. The only person in the entire the Xiang manor who could save him was probably only Grandfather.However, the enemy was obviously unwilling to let Xiang Nan off easily. In the blink of an eye, a second sword light came from the night sky!This second sword light was faster and fiercer than the first! That strong sense of crisis even caused Xiang Nan's muscles to tighten fiercely.This time, Xiang Nan was prepared in advance. When the second sword light struck, he had already executed the second flash step accurately, and his body turned into an afterimage that cut through the night sky.The second ray of sword light actually cut off the heel of Xiang Nan's boots! His left boot fell in response.\"The enemy is too fast!\" Xiang Nan's heart was beating wildly as he rushed towards his grandfather's house in the night sky.However, the Xiang manor was huge, and the buildings were scattered in a disorderly manner. There was no path that allowed Xiang Nan to run wildly in a straight line. This forced him to jump back and forth.The enemies in the darkness clenched their teeth, and vaguely, their blurry shadows flickered under the night sky.Xiang Nan raised his perception to its limit, unable to sense even the slightest presence of the enemy, as if no enemy had appeared tonight.Qiang!With a trembling sound of the sword, a third ray of sword light came!Just as Xiang Nan's body was soaring into the air, he kicked an ancient tree beside him with his right foot. He executed the Flash Shadow Steps and his body turned into an afterimage again.The sharp sword light struck the ancient tree and pierced through it. This time, it almost brushed past Xiang Nan's right shoulder.This time, the sword light was even faster than the last time. Not only did it cut off Xiang Nan's sleeve, it even cut off a small piece of his skin and flesh. Blood immediately soaked out.It was extremely dangerous! Every move of the enemy made it difficult for Xiang Nan to resist. Even if he used the powerful Flash Steps to dodge, it could also be said to be a step-by-step shock.\"Damn it!\" Xiang Nan covered his shoulders and took advantage of the gap between the enemy's attack and the enemy's attack to run frantically towards his grandfather's residence.He thought to himself, in order to conceal his identity, this enemy didn't even use a single martial skill and used pure Yuan Qi to attack.This made it impossible for Xiang Nan to determine the origin of the enemy.\"What a fast movement technique.\"Suddenly, a hoarse and deep voice came from above Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan's heart trembled. He was so close!The addiction seemed to come from above Xiang Nan's head, and it sounded more like a soft whisper.This kind of voice that suddenly sounded in his ears brought great danger to Xiang Nan.\"But \u2026 so what? With your tiny Xiantian sixth layer, it's as easy as killing you!\"As soon as the enemy's voice settled, the next attack arrived in an instant.This time, the enemy unexpectedly chopped out three sword lights in a row!These three sword lights weren't enormous. Each of them was only a meter long, but the power contained within them was unimaginable.These three sword lights were extremely vicious, sealing off Xiang Nan's front, left, right, and three other directions.No matter which direction Xiang Nan dodged in, he would be split in half by the enemy's sword. However, if he stopped in time, he would be able to dodge the sword light, but the enemy would take the opportunity to catch up with him.In his helplessness, Xiang Nan chose the only path, which was to jump high.He borrowed the Flash Step to jump 40 to 50 meters tall. Although he had dodged the enemy's attack, this had forced Xiang Nan to another desperate situation at the same time.There was no point in borrowing power in the air! Xiang Nan's body soared into the air, and he was no longer able to use the Flash Shadow Steps.In the pitch-black night sky, the enemy's hoarse and sinister laughter slowly drifted over. Immediately after, a fatal sword appeared.The sword light accurately aimed at Xiang Nan. The bright Yuan Qi pierced through the sky, leaving behind a thick shadow of light.Xiang Nan couldn't avoid it and couldn't help but let out a sorrowful cry in his heart. Could it be that he was going to die tonight?\"Who dares to hurt my grandson!\"Right at this moment of life and death, a deep roar broke the silence of the night.Xiang Zhanxiong was shrouded in abundant Yuan Qi and soared into the sky. He clenched his fist with his right hand and punched heavily.Yuan Qi condensed into a huge fist light. The Yuan Qi fist smashed into the sword light and instantly shattered the sword light.\"Grandfather!\" Xiang Nan was overjoyed and heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.Liked it?

The power of the sword light was several times greater than the previous sword lights. However, because this was a heavy sword attack, not a light sword, it was not as fast as the previous sword lights.Xiang Zhan's ambition was filled with rage. Xiang Nan was his best grandson and the only future of the Xiang Clan. Tonight, someone dared to barge into his house and kill!Xiang Zhanxiong let out a low roar and punched out again.This time, when the fists and swords collided, the sword light once again landed on the ground and was shattered by Xiang Zhanxiong's punch.As for Xiang Zhanxiong's fist, it pierced through the night sky and gradually flew away. Obviously, he did not hit the enemy.Just as the fist rays pierced through the sky, the light of the fist rays finally allowed Xiang Nan, who was not far away, to see traces of the enemy.It was a mysterious person dressed in night clothes. His entire body was wrapped in a black robe, and only a pair of gloomy and cold eyes were exposed.Xiang Nan secretly nodded, knowing that he was safe.Grandfather Xiang Zhanxiong was at the ninth level of the Origin Realm, so the enemy of this night attack must be below the ninth level of the Origin Realm.\"Old bastard, you're courting death!\" In the night sky, the black-clothed enemy cursed hoarsely, but when he saw his body twist, his sword slashed towards him.\"Martial skill!\" Xiang Nan was stunned. The enemy had actually used a martial skill!The enemy's sword strike was no small matter. It was no longer a pure sword light. Instead, the sword light carried a distorted shape. As it sliced through the night sky, there was a faint hiss of a poisonous snake spitting out messages.This time, the enemy's attack did not conceal his strength. Xiang Nan judged from the Yuan Qi fluctuations of the sword light that the enemy should be between the fourth and sixth levels of the Origin Return Realm.Xiang Zhanxiong's punch collided with the sword light with a strange sound. The sword light actually split the fist light into two!Xiang Zhanxiong's heart skipped a beat, and then he continued to punch, using two punches to neutralize the enemy's sword power.Xiang Nan frowned deeply. The situation wasn't too good. The enemy was able to defuse Grandpa's fist light by lagging behind Grandpa's realm. This meant that the enemy's martial skill level must be far higher than Grandpa's.At the same time, Xiang Nan couldn't help but curse himself for being stupid!For a long time, he had been focusing on his grandfather's martial dao bottleneck, thinking that it was the bottleneck that had prevented him from advancing.But now, he suddenly realized why he hadn't provided his grandfather with a high-grade cultivation technique!Even though Grandpa had already broken through the bottleneck, just advancing from the ninth level of Origin Return to the first level of Heavenly Origin was a huge span in itself.\"What a thief!\" Xiang Zhanxiong cursed angrily and took out a bright spear from his storage ring.\"Xiang Family Gun?\" The enemy laughed coldly, his laughter filled with disdain, but he saw that the sword in his hand had slashed four times.These four slashes all used martial skills, but the four sword lights were extremely strange. The sword lights did not slash towards Xiang Zhanxiong in a straight line, but turned into four twisted shapes like poisonous snakes.The four twisted sword lights drew four arcs with completely different magnitudes, attacking Xiang Zhanxiong from four different directions.\"This\" Xiang Zhanxiong was also stunned. He had never seen such an unfathomable martial skill in his life!Xiang Zhanxiong gritted his teeth and shouted, \"Sweep through a thousand troops!\"His body twisted, and the spear swept out a huge ring of spear light!This spear had an extremely wide coverage, blocking off all the attack angles of the enemy's sword light.However, those four strange sword lights were like poisonous snakes, fiercely grabbing onto Xiang Zhanxiong's spear light.What was frightening was that with Xiang Zhanxiong's strength, which was at least four small realms higher than the enemy's, that spear beam was actually unable to resist the power of the four sword beams!Immediately, the ring-shaped spear light was crushed by the four snake-shaped sword lights at a speed visible to the naked eye.Xiang Zhanxiong shouted and burst out his Yuan Qi. He expended a large amount of Yuan Qi and swept three shots in a row.A total of four spear beams landed on the four serpent-shaped sword beams, finally canceling out the enemy's sword beams.However, at this moment, Xiang Zhanxiong was already panting, but the enemy who had lightly landed on the treetop was completely unaffected.Immediately after, the enemy laughed sinisterly, \"Old man, I want your life!\"\"Not good!\" Xiang Nan's heart skipped a beat without warning. He could feel the unusual Yuan Qi fluctuations on the enemy's body.Thus, an astonishing scene appeared.The enemy suddenly raised his sword high, and the Yuan Qi in his body began to flow rapidly in an abnormal manner. Even the Yuan Qi wrapped around the enemy's body and flowed back into the sky like a reversed vortex of Yuan Qi.Immediately after, a faintly visible giant phantom pattern appeared behind the enemy.It was a giant viper face! This viper's face was ten meters tall and eight meters wide. It was so strange that it enveloped the enemy's back.The huge viper's face was in stark contrast to the enemy who was less than two meters tall, making the cold viper in the night sky look extremely shocked!Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and sucked in a breath of cold air.\"At the very least, it's an Earth level beginner martial skill!\"Xiang Zhanxiong's expression also changed. His eyes were wide open as he looked at the scene in disbelief.At this moment, the enemy laughed sinisterly and said in a deep voice, \"Earth Fiend Snake King Sword!\"The moment he said the name of the martial skill, the viper phantom behind him suddenly opened its huge mouth!As for the enemy right in front of Viper, his sword suddenly stabbed out and shot out like an Adder's messenger.The sword light was actually scarlet red, and it could be as long as twenty meters.With this strike, even the surrounding air was abruptly sucked dry. The vacuum created a raging strong wind. The trees in the courtyard were uprooted. Stone tables, stone chairs, and a collapsed courtyard wall were all sucked into the sky.Regardless of whether it was the courtyard walls or trees, when these things encountered the fierce winds, they were crushed into countless pieces! This was only the power of the Spirit Wind. One could imagine how powerful that sword light was.The scarlet sword light caused the violent harbor wind to whistle towards Xiang Zhanxiong.Xiang Zhanxiong felt as if he was facing a great enemy. He held a gun in his right hand and a dantian in his left hand. His face showed an unusual flush of red.\"Sh*t, grandfather is burning his dantian!\" Xiang Nan was shocked.Burning a dantian was an extremely harmful action to a martial artist. As the name implied, a martial artist would sacrifice his dantian for a short burst of strength.Afterwards, this kind of behavior would cause serious injuries to martial artists, ranging from serious injuries to a retreat in cultivation!Liked it?

At the expense of spontaneous combustion of his dantian, he instantly drained nearly 70% of his Yuan Qi and fired a shot.This spear, however, condensed into a terrifying spear light that was forty meters tall!The spear light rushed in and collided with the scarlet sword light.The moment the spears and swords collided, the moonlight seemed to have lost its luster. It was also at this moment that the night sky suddenly became silent.Immediately after, two violent forces finally erupted.Boom! !The earth-shattering Yuan Qi collided, forming an unprecedentedly large circular shock wave.Right below, there were more than twenty buildings in the Xiang Clan that were instantly razed to the ground by the circular shock wave!Xiang Zhanxiong's face suddenly flushed red as he coughed out a large mouthful of blood.The enemy of the night attack also floated backwards a few zhang, his arms trembling slightly, and the viper phantom behind him also disappeared.Evidently, the Earth Fiend Snake King Sword used by this enemy caused his own consumption to be quite serious. He glared fiercely at Xiang Nan, turned around, and shot into the night sky, disappearing.Xiang Zhanxiong originally intended to catch up, but before he could take a step forward, another mouthful of blood spurted out.\"Grandfather!\" Xiang Nan hurriedly ran over and mixed in the tottering Xiang Zhanxiong.However, Xiang Zhanxiong said anxiously, \"Quick, let's see if there are any casualties among the members of the clan!\"Xiang Nan hurriedly shook his head and said, \"No, you just destroyed some houses and didn't hurt anyone.\"Hearing Xiang Nan's reply, Xiang Zhanxiong heaved a sigh of relief.The Xiang Clan had just returned, and they were not considered prosperous. Coincidentally, the houses in this area were empty. Fortunately, they were not able to injure the Xiang Clan.At this time, the Xiang Clan had already been alarmed, and a large number of them had rushed over.\"It must be the Cai Clan!\" Looking at the ruins, Great Elder's beard danced horizontally.The Second Elder's eyes were fierce as he coldly said, \"What a Cai Clan! He actually dares to ride on my the Xiang manor's head and act wildly!\"The Xiang Clan and the Cai Clan had just formed a grudge, but they hadn't expected their revenge to arrive so quickly.However, Xiang Zhanxiong and Xiang Nan exchanged glances and shook their heads.Xiang Zhanxiong coughed a few times and said weakly, \"From what I've seen, the person who attacked tonight may not be the Cai Clan.\"\"Yes.\" Xiang Nan's face was filled with anger, \"Although the Cai Clan has many experts, their cultivation methods are definitely not that high.\"Xiang Zhanxiong said, \"This person chose this opportunity to sneak attack the Xiang Clan. On the one hand, it was to frame the Cai Clan. On the other hand, it must be because he did not dare to openly attack little Nan .\"The enemy's strength was tyrannical, and their cultivation techniques were frighteningly high. At the same time, they hated Xiang Nan to the bone and did not dare to openly kill Xiang Nan. They only dared to sneak attack when the Xiang Cai Clan and the Xiang Cai Clan were at odds.Then this person can only beXiang Nan and Xiang Zhanxiong looked at each other again and said in unison, \"Wang Xiaoyun!\"Hearing these three words, the expressions of everyone in the Xiang Clan changed slightly.The current Wang Clan was different from the past. Wang Xiaoyun was a disciple of Chihuo Sect. To some extent, the Wang Clan's current status was even higher than that of the City Lord.\"Isn't Wang Xiaoyun at the fifth level of the Origin Reversion? How could he fight with Second Master to such an extent? Did we guess wrongly?\" Xiang Zhonghua, the grandson of the Great Elder, cried out in shock, \"Then, isn't Wang Xiaoyun at the fifth level of the Origin Reversion?\"Xiang Zhanxiong was at the ninth level of the Origin Realm and Wang Xiaoyun was at the fifth level of the Origin Realm. There were four small realms between them.If it was a Xiantian realm expert, killing an enemy across four small realms was difficult, but it wasn't impossible.However, the difference between each small realm of the Origin Returning Realm was much greater than the difference between a small realm of the Xiantian Realm.In other words, the higher the cultivation level, the more difficult it would be to kill enemies across borders.If one reached the late Martial Arts realm, the difference between each small realm would be an insurmountable heavenly chasm!\"This is the strength of the sect.\" Xiang Zhanxiong sighed, \"Wang Xiaoyun's cultivation in Chihuo Sect is no longer something a remote martial artist like us can imagine.\"How could a martial artist from a remote small clan be compared to a martial artist cultivated by a second-rate sect?Xiang Zhanxiong waved his hand and said, \"Great Elder, from today onwards, we will arrange for our clansmen to patrol every night. We cannot give the Wang Clan another chance.\"\"Understood.\" The Great Elder nodded and began to clean up the mess with his clansmen.\" Little Nan , follow me.\" Xiang Zhanxiong glanced at Xiang Nan and both of them left.The underground secret room of the Xiang Clan.Just as Xiang Zhanxiong sat down, another mouthful of blood spurted out.\"Grandfather, are you alright?\" Xiang Nan's face was anxious and he hurriedly went up to help.Xiang Zhanxiong shook his head and said, \"The Wang Clan has been relatively quiet these days. It made me relax my vigilance. I was too careless.\"The Wang Clan had always been ambitious and secretly wanted to get rid of the Xiang Clan. This was the hatred they had accumulated over the years.In particular, Xiang Nan had ruthlessly dealt a blow to the Wang Clan's arrogance at the Martial Arts Town Election and the celebration banquet, making Xiang Nan a thorn in the Wang Clan's side.Xiang Zhanxiong sighed helplessly. He looked at Xiang Nan and said, \" little Nan , if you are not chosen by the sect in the Martial Arts City Selection in nine days, then the Wang Clan will no longer be afraid.\"\"Then Wang Xiaoyun will definitely bring a large number of experts to flatten the Xiang manor.\"\"The life and death of our Xiang Clan is at stake.\"At this point, Xiang Zhanxiong's face was filled with shame, \"I, Xiang Zhanxiong, am incompetent. I placed the burden of the life and death of the Xiang Clan on a child of ours.\"Xiang Nan hurriedly said, \"Grandpa, don't say that. I'm a member of the Xiang Clan. This is all my responsibility.\"\"Sigh\" Xiang Zhanxiong let out a long sigh. Although he didn't say anything, his eyebrows were filled with deep self-blame.\"Right, Grandpa.\" Xiang Nan suddenly changed the subject and said, \"Do you remember what I said? There is a mysterious expert secretly guiding me in cultivation.\"\"I told him about your situation. He gave me a few things and a cultivation technique.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan opened his storage ring and took out a Third Grade Fire Bath Pill, a Third Grade Marrow Cleansing Pill, and a Third Grade Origin Tempering Pill.These were the only three third-grade pills that Xiang Nan had. There were two for each of them. At this moment, he took out half of them and handed them to Xiang Zhanxiong.Xiang Zhanxiong was shocked and asked in disbelief, \"Three Tier 3 pills? Is this for me?\"A Tier 3 medicinal pill was priced at at least five million gold coins on the market! The value of the three was already close to 20 million gold coins.The value of these three pills was nearly three times that of the Xiang Clan's total wealth!Not to mention Xiang Zhanxiong, even the Wang Clan's Clan Head, Wang Changhe, would definitely be shocked to see these three pills.Liked it?

Let me pass it on to you.\"Xiang Zhanxiong took the pill with a look of ecstasy on his face, but immediately after, he stuffed the pill into Xiang Nan's hand and said happily, \"With these three Tier 3 pills, little Nan , your cultivation will be even faster.\"When Xiang Nan heard this, his nose couldn't help but turn sour. The first thing his grandfather thought of was actually him.This was the depth of kinship.Xiang Nan shook his head and said, \"Grandpa, my realm is too low to withstand the fierce medicinal properties of Tier 3 pills. You should take it yourself. Only when you break through to the Tian Yuan realm will our Xiang Clan's foundation be more stable.\"\"Moreover.\" Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"If I can become a disciple of the sect, a Tier 3 pill is nothing to me.\"\"En \u2026 what you said makes sense.\" Only then did Xiang Zhanxiong reluctantly accept the pill.Then, Xiang Nan took out a pen and paper and began to write a cultivation technique. As he wrote, he said, \"That senior asked me to memorize a cultivation technique. I'll write it down now. Grandpa, you can start cultivating immediately.\"As Xiang Nan was writing, Xiang Zhanxiong lowered his head to look at it. He watched as the words were written into incantations, but his expression became even more shocked.When Xiang Nan handed Xiang Zhanxiong a newly transcribed cultivation technique, Xiang Zhanxiong was dumbfounded.\"This is \u2026 an Earth level beginner cultivation technique?\" Xiang Zhanxiong looked at the five words \"Cang Yuan Tian Yang Palm\" on the cover of the cultivation technique in horror.Xiang Nan smiled and nodded. \"It should be an Earth level junior, right? That's what the senior said.\"Actually, Xiang Nan also had a higher level cultivation technique, but it was not suitable for Xiang Zhanxiong to cultivate it. Because Xiang Zhanxiong's talent was relatively ordinary, only at the Mortal Grade.Although Xiang Nan was only a Xiantian realm martial artist, he possessed heaven-defying divine talent, so he was able to directly cultivate the Earth-ranked cultivation technique Flash Shadow Steps.However, Xiang Zhanxiong's talent wasn't that strong, so even though he had the ninth level of Origin Return, his current limit was that he could only cultivate to the Earthly Elementary Stage.If Xiang Zhanxiong was given a higher cultivation technique, it would only harm him, causing him to go crazy and destroy his cultivation.Xiang Zhanxiong held the [Blue Origin Heavenly Yang Palm] in his hand, but he did not immediately flip through it. Instead, he said to Xiang Nan in a serious tone, \" little Nan , no matter how high your achievements are in the future, you must not forget the great kindness of that senior.\"\"Those who practice martial arts must remember to repay their kindness and guard one of their hearts. They must not be swallowed by greed.\"\"In this way, Fang is a man and a martial artist who stands tall in the heavens and earth.\"Xiang Nan nodded solemnly. He really didn't expect that even though his grandfather lived in a remote place like Greencloud Town, he had such a broad mind.Xiang Zhanxiong added, \"In the next few days, I will cultivate in seclusion again and strive to advance to the Heavenly Yuan Realm as soon as possible.\"\"Until then, don't expose yourself. Continue to pretend that the Cai Clan did what happened tonight, in case Wang Xiaoyun jumps over the wall.\"\"Grandson understands.\" Xiang Nan stood up and said goodbye.The selection of Wudao City was a hurdle for the Xiang Clan. Before that, the Xiang Clan had to hide their strength and keep a low profile.After leaving the secret room, Xiang Nan was found by his father, Xiang Shaohua. It turned out that he wanted to give Xiang Nan a shock and to have a family reunion dinner together.This was the first time he had eaten with his parents since Xiang Nan's rebirth, and the three of them were enjoying themselves at the table.Xiang Nan looked at the kindness in his parents' eyes, and his heart was melted by the thick and selfless affection for his family.It turned out that having parents to love him was actually such a beautiful thing.After eating a meal for a long time, his parents constantly warned him to take good care of himself. Even if the Xiang manor was gone, his family would not disperse if he was still alive.After dinner, Xiang Nan personally sent his parents back to their room, experiencing the warmth of the human child.Outside the courtyard, Xiang Zhonghua and his older brothers and sisters were waiting for Xiang Nan.\" Little Nan , after tonight, there are eight days left before the Martial Arts City Selection. The few of us will also participate.\" Xiang Zhonghua said.Xiang Nan was stunned for a moment and asked curiously, \"Cousins, do you want to participate in the Martial Arts City Selection as well?\"\"Although we are inferior to you, we still have dreams and aspirations in our hearts. We cannot let all the responsibilities of the Xiang Clan fall on you alone,\" Xiang Zhonghua smiled.Xiang Nan hurriedly apologized, \"That's not what I meant. Brothers and sisters, don't misunderstand.\"Xiang Zhonghua and the others were the previous contestants. They had passed the town elections a few years ago, so they could directly participate in the city elections this time.Xiang Zhonghua smiled and said, \"Don't think too much. We only notified you in advance so that you can know that you are not alone. There are still us behind you.\"Xiang Nan smiled sincerely and nodded forcefully, \"Yes, I know. Our family fought together and carried the Xiang family together.\"\"Right, do you still remember Huangpu Ruyan? She gave me some pills and cultivation methods before she left.\"Xiang Nan took out all the Tier 1 and Tier 2 pills and distributed them to everyone on the scene without hiding anything. He said, \"The cultivation technique is still stored in Miss Ruyan's mansion. After I retrieve it, I will send it to my brothers and sisters.\"Everyone had originally come to comfort Xiang Nan, but they didn't expect such an unexpected harvest. All of them revealed expressions of ecstasy.\"My God! This is a second-grade fire bathing pill!\" Xiang Zhonghua was shocked and said, \"Such a precious medicinal pill, we \u2026\"Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Take it. These things are nothing to Miss Ruyan.\"Xiang Nan originally didn't know that Xiang Zhonghua and the others wanted to participate in the city selection, but now he knew that he could help as much as he wanted.\"But \u2026\" Although Xiang Zhonghua was happy, his expression was ugly. \"Such a precious pill should be used on you. Give it to us \u2026\"Xiang Nan shook his head. \"I've kept a few for myself. It's enough.\"As he said that, Xiang Nan sincerely said to Xiang Zhonghua, \"Brother, when you first returned, I hope you don't mind if I went too far.\"Xiang Zhong Hua and the others all laughed amiably. Xiang Zhong Hua said, \"I won't mind just calling you brother. Actually, what I did was even more excessive than yours.\"\"Alright, alright. Everyone is a family. Don't be such an outsider.\" The one who spoke was a cousin of Xiang Nan named Xiang Fei.At that time, when the clansmen returned, Xiang Fei was also one of the people who made things difficult for Xiang Zhanxiong. She was the granddaughter of the Third Elder. She was also one of the outstanding members of the Xiang Clan. Like Xiang Zhonghua, she was also a Xiantian Fourth Stage martial artist.\"Good brother.\" Xiang Fei grabbed Xiang Nan's hand and smiled, \"The family doesn't say anything out of the ordinary.\"\"Yes, Sister Fei is right.\" Xiang Nan smiled brightly.This was the first time the siblings of the Xiang Clan had gathered together to remove their grievances.The Xiang Clan truly embraced the foreign enemies.

Then, he handed them to Xiang Zhonghua and the others.Xiang Zhonghua and the rest of the Xiang Clan disciples didn't have the talent for the Five Elements, so they could cultivate any type of cultivation technique.The reason why Xiang Nan gave them the Earth Element Cultivation Technique was because of certain considerations.With Xiang Zhonghua and the others' current cultivation and strength, it was unlikely that they would be able to shine in the Martial Arts City Selection, and it was not very meaningful to increase their combat strength in a short period of time.Fighting power was not only a manifestation of strength and speed, it also took into account a martial artist's combat awareness and combat experience.Therefore, relatively speaking, Earth Element cultivation techniques emphasized defense, and defense didn't require that much combat experience.Xiang Nan's idea was very simple. He did not ask Xiang Zhonghua and the others to be able to top the selection in Martial Arts City. He only hoped that his older brothers and sisters could survive. At the very least, they would not die.After arranging these things, Xiang Nan began to make plans for his own Martial City.\"My realm is still pretty good. After absorbing the White Flame Lightning twice, I've also improved a lot. However \u2026\"Xiang Nan rubbed his temples. However, he did not have a martial skill that he could use.You can't use lightning to shake your moves when you're fighting with someone. This is very unrealistic.\"But \u2026 where can I find the Lightning Meridian martial skill?\" Xiang Nan was in a difficult situation and couldn't find an exit even after thinking for a while.The Lightning Meridian Technique was too rare. Even in the Auction House of the Gathering Money Pavilion, it could not be found.\"Let's go to the Heavenly Thunder Martial King's treasure cave again.\" Xiang Nan decided to pay attention and rushed to the Black Sharp Mountain Range again.At present, the Lightning Vein expert that Xiang Nan already knew was the Heavenly Thunder Martial King, so he could only learn from this person's experience.After returning to the Treasure Cave for the second time, Xiang Nan searched through the Treasure Cave and found nothing.Xiang Nan rubbed his chin and looked at the treasure cave that he had flipped through. He muttered to himself, \"This is the first treasure cave of a Martial King. It also means that he cultivated here in the early stage of Martial Arts.\"\"Even if there isn't any martial skill he cultivated in the early stage, he should at least leave behind some clues to his cultivation.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan suddenly felt something. He raised his head and glanced at the surrounding walls, \"Could it be \u2026\"This cave had existed for thousands of years. In the past, a thick layer of dust had accumulated on all four walls.Xiang Nan raised his right hand and a ball of early weather appeared in his palm. Then, the early weather whistled out and swept through the four walls. After the thick dust fell, some words appeared on the east and south walls!\"Indeed!\" Xiang Nan was overjoyed. The Heavenly Thunder Martial King had really written something on the wall.He studied the words seriously. In the process, he frowned, suddenly came to an understanding, and sometimes had doubts on his face.The words on the wall weren't martial skills, and no martial artist would write a martial skill incantation on the wall. As expected, the words on the wall were essays from the Heavenly Thunder Martial King's cultivation.Those words were one after another, and there was no orderly connection between them. It should be that the Martial King would write down two strokes on the wall at any time with a flash of light.According to Xiang Nan's deep understanding of martial arts, he copied all the words into a blank book and arranged them in order.After that, he carefully examined these words and muttered to himself in surprise, \"This is a random book of lightning veins.\"All of the words recorded were the Heavenly Thunder Martial King's insights into the attributes of thunder veins, and the general direction was towards Qi Condensation.For nearly a thousand years, martial artists had focused on body refinement. It was because their body refinement experience had made them stronger and brought them more durable combat abilities. It was not like Qi refinement, where they would lose their combat strength after the weather had been used up.Xiang Nan was greatly amused and continued to flip through it, muttering silently.According to the Martial King's own understanding, the wind, wood, water, fire, and earth elements were all existences in the world, but lightning was originally something that did not exist in the world, and it was derived from itXiang Nan nodded as he watched. The Martial King's insights into the Lightning Meridian allowed Xiang Nan's understanding of the talent of the Lightning Meridian to rise to a new level. This saved him a lot of time to explore it himself.And the real usefulness of this thunder vein chat lies in the second half, which is about two things.One is called \"Qi Condensation into Lightning\", and the other is called \"Thunder King Seal\".\"En \u2026 it's interesting to train qi to become electricity.\" Xiang Nan laughed and nodded.The lightning attribute precedes the weather, not the real lightning, just like the fire attribute precedes the weather, not the flame, but the explosive power.However, through the cultivation of cultivation techniques, fire attributes could be used to cultivate the Primordial Weather Flame and Primordial Energy Flame. Obviously, lightning attributes could also be used to cultivate the Primordial Weather Flame and Primordial Energy Flame.As Xiang Nan flipped through it, he raised his right hand and a ball of early weather appeared in his palm. This early weather contained the attributes of thunder veins, but it still looked like gas on the outside.Xiang Nan swiftly passed through his mind according to the formula of Qi Condensation and Lightning Condensation. The weather swiftly flowed through his meridians before rising from his palm.Unexpectedly, a ball of weather floating above his palm quickly transformed into a thunderball at a speed visible to the naked eye!\"It really succeeded!\" Xiang Nan's eyes widened. The ball of lightning was made of lightning, and it floated in the air with a cracking sound.He casually threw the lightning ball out, and with a loud boom, a large crater with a radius of two to three meters exploded on the ground, causing the entire treasure cave to shake a few times.\"This power \u2026 is too shocking.\" Xiang Nan was both surprised and delighted. After the same amount of early weather had been converted into thunderballs, its power had explosively increased by at least two to three times.Xiang Nan himself did not expect that he would actually be able to directly condense the lightning attribute of the first weather into lightning!\"En, this Qi Condensation into Lightning is quite easy for my divine talent. However, this Lightning King Seal is \u2026\"Xiang Nan continued to flip through it, but the introduction to the Thunder King Seal on the right opened his eyes wide.The Martial King believed that lightning was something that did not exist in the world, so its plasticity was endless.If it was activated in some specific way, it would allow lightning to achieve an unexpected effect. Based on this, the Martial King created six methods of sealing.These six hand seals are: Thunder Seal; King Sparrow Seal; Howthunder Seal; Lightning Photoelectric Eye; Group lightning array; Tyrant Body Lightning Body.The prerequisite for cultivating these six hand seals was to learn how to cultivate Qi into electricity.The reason for that was because the six hand seals were all purest methods of killing enemies with Qi.Martial artists used moves to fight, using \"skills\", while Qi to fight, using \"magic\".If \"body\" and \"Qi\" dual cultivation, then it is a technique dual cultivation.Liked it?

    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 Hao DianPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euHowever, according to Martial King's own experience, although he had created the Thunder King Seal, he had not gone deep into cultivation.This was because a martial artist's energy was limited. Even if a Martial King possessed a Heavenly Grade Lightning Vein, he could only cultivate his body to the limit, but he did not have any extra energy to cultivate his Qi.Xiang Nan muttered to himself, \"I have divine talent. Cultivating any martial skill and technique is faster than ordinary people. Perhaps the Thunder King doesn't have enough energy, but I do.\"\"But how are these six Lightning King Seals used? Find out.\"He took out the Spirit Testing Stones he had obtained from Miss Ruyan and injected them into the early weather. Therefore, the Spirit Testing Stones began to run in circles around the open space.This Spirit Measuring Stone was beaten into a human form. In fact, it was a humanoid puppet. After injecting it into the weather, the puppet could perform some simple basic movements.Xiang Nan watched as the Spirit Measuring Stone Puppet ran. He followed the first stance of the Thunder King Seal and began to form seals.He poured the weather into his hands before refining it into lightning. The weather attached to his hands turned into lightning visible to the naked eye.Afterwards, his hands quickly formed seals. His fingers constantly changed shape and collided with each other in a strange posture. The lightning attached to his hands changed astonishingly according to the process of forming seals.He aimed at the running Spirit Measuring Stone puppet and shouted, \"Fallen Thunder!\"Boom!Luo Lei did not succeed. Instead, Xiang Nan's own hands formed seals and exploded.A powerful lightning explosion sent Xiang Nan flying. His body heavily smashed against the wall and bounced back, causing all the muscles in his body to twitch violently.\"What the hell? Fortunately, I absorbed the White Flame Lightning and cultivated it to be more resistant to electricity.\" Xiang Nan rubbed his shoulders and stood up, smiling bitterly. \"Otherwise, I would have exploded myself to death.\"Forming a seal seemed simple, but in fact, it was extremely difficult, and the slightest bit of deviation would be useless.\"Again!\" Xiang Nan twisted his neck and formed another seal with his hands.\"Fallen Lightning!\"Boom! It exploded.\"Fallen Lightning!\"Boom! It exploded again.Xiang Nan had formed seals for nearly two hours in a row. He had formed seals more than two hundred times, and he had finally succeeded once.However, when he saw that the Lightning Seal had succeeded, his face was filled with joy. His index and middle fingers merged together to form a sword finger, and his finger slashed down from top to bottom!Under the high dome of the treasure cave, the air was originally empty, but the moment Xiang Nan's sword finger landed, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky!The lightning drew a \"Z\" shape, as thick as an arm, and slammed into the ground.\"It actually triggered lightning?\" Xiang Nan suddenly jumped up. It turned out that after the Lightning Falling Seal was triggered successfully, a bolt of lightning would fall out of thin air.Unfortunately, the angle he controlled wasn't good. This bolt of lightning didn't hit the Spirit Testing Stone puppet.He hurriedly rushed forward to examine his battle results. He saw that after this lightning struck the ground, it did not cause an explosion like he had failed to form a seal. Instead, it left a hole in the ground!On the ground, an arm-thick, bottomless black hole was still emitting green smoke.\"Ha \u2026 haha!\" Xiang Nan looked up and laughed loudly. Sure enough, two hours of hard work was not in vain!Then, he ran off into the distance and formed another seal.Because he had already formed a seal for an hour, he had already found his way to the door. This time, he had only failed a dozen times before succeeding.This time, the lightning struck the puppet directly, hacking the Spirit Testing Stone puppet flying horizontally.This caused Xiang Nan to be shocked once again. What was the use of spirit testing stones? It was used to detect attacks. This kind of thing's ability to withstand attacks was unimaginably strong.After the lightning struck the Spirit Testing Stone, it left a two-inch deep lightning penetrating wound on the Spirit Testing Stone's shoulder!\"Oh my God\" Xiang Nan widened his eyes and said in shock, \"When I was testing myself with Miss Ruyan, I fought with all my might and didn't even leave a single scratch on this Spirit Testing Stone.\"This was only the Lightning Falling Seal formed by the previous weather. What if it was Yuan Qi?That kind of power was truly powerful to the point of being unbelievably powerful!The key point was that although the Lightning Falling Seal was also terrifying to the previous weather, it was much better than the Thunder Claps. At the very least, it wouldn't use the Lightning Falling Seal to empty the dantian.\"However, this Lightning Seal is a bit too difficult.\" Xiang Nan took a deep breath and muttered to himself, \"With my divine talent, it's so difficult to form the simplest Lightning Falling Seal.\"\"If it were anyone else, it would be unimaginable.\"\"Then \u2026 what is the Sparrow King Seal?\"After Xiang Nan had witnessed the first Lightning Falling Seal, he couldn't help but feel great anticipation for the second Sparrow King Seal.He carefully studied the description of the Sparrow King Seal and discovered that this stance could not be accomplished solely by forming a seal. Instead, he needed to use something.\"Beast soul.\"The so-called beast soul was the soul of a demonic beast. Generally speaking, beast souls were commonly used in weapon forging. Powerful weapon forgers would seal the beast soul into weapons, producing unexpected effects.In the pill refining process, one would occasionally use something like a beast soul, but a martial skill would also use a beast soul? This was the first time Xiang Nan had heard of it.However, according to the Martial King's description, the power of the Sparrow King Seal belonged to the enhanced Thunder Falling Style, and its power ranged from two to ten times that of the Thunder Falling Style.\"En, find an opportunity to draw out a beast soul.\" Xiang Nan made up his mind and went on to look at the third style, the Hao Lightning Seal.After hundreds of failures, a complete Lightning Seal finally succeeded.He saw his hands clashing with lightning, his fingers forming a strange shape, leaving behind a prismatic gap between his hands.Then, Xiang Nan condensed the weather into his mouth before turning it into electricity. Then, he let out a sigh of relief at the prismatic gap in his hands and spat it out.As soon as that breath passed through the gap in the palm print, it actually formed a thunderball the size of a fist, and the thunderball rolled forward, becoming bigger and bigger!The ball of lightning had just left the palm of his hand and was the size of a fist. After flying out, it turned into the size of a watermelon and then into the size of a boulderWhen the lightning ball rolled on the Spirit Measuring Stone golem, it was already the size of a house!\"This \u2026\" Xiang Nan was shocked. \"The power contained in the thunderball is unchanged, but its volume is getting bigger and bigger. Isn't it equivalent to the lethality being dispersed?\"Boom!The ball of lightning instantly exploded when it touched the puppet, and lightning shot everywhere.Just as Xiang Nan thought, this lightning ball, which was getting bigger and bigger, did not have much lethality at all. It did not even possess one-fifth of the power of the Lightning Seal.However, another phenomenon caused Xiang Nan to be overjoyed.The Spirit Measuring Stone Puppet \u2026 stopped!The Hao Lightning Ball was actually used to stiffen enemies! When the lightning ball hit the humanoid puppet, the puppet truly stopped for a moment, and then it resumed running. Its speed slowly returned to normal.Liked it?

He was truly too surprised!Although the Thunderball didn't have any powerful lethality, it could instantly stiffen the enemy. This was much more precious than directly inflicting lethality!One had to know that the battle between warriors could be said to be extremely fast. An enemy pausing for a second could often decide whether they were alive or dead.Xiang Nan panted and sat on the ground, laughing heartily.Indeed, the Thunder King Seal was not prepared for the weather first. It was ideal to use Yuan Qi to form a seal, but it was still quite good to use it at a critical moment.\"Too strong, really too strong.\" Xiang Nan took out a small piece of Elementary Grade Spirit Stone. As he flipped through the fourth type of Lightning Photoelectric Eye, he absorbed the Spirit Qi provided by the Spirit Stone and quickly recovered the missing Spirit Qi in his body.\"Oh \u2026 I see.\" Xiang Nan nodded slightly. He quickly formed a seal with both of his hands. This time, it was a success.After forming the seal, he wiped his fingers on his eyes, which were immediately covered by a layer of thunder.Compared to the first three moves, the fourth move was much simpler. Moreover, the lightning optoelectronic's purpose was not to attack, but to\u2026Xiang Nan's eyes flickered with lightning, and he could clearly see the fluctuations of the first weather in the air!The Lightning Meridian attribute belonged to the Supreme Yang. After injecting the power of thunder and lightning into his eyes, he could see the demonic energy flowing in the air. Xiang Nan had already known this when he broke into the Black Sharp Demonic Forest.However, the only drawback was that Xiang Nan could not see the fluctuations of Yuan Qi due to this type of Yang attribute.The Lightning Photoelectric Eye strengthened the Lightning Meridian's eyes. Not only could it clearly see the existence of demonic energy, it could also see the residual fluctuations of Yuan Qi or the residual fluctuations left in the air by the weather.Xiang Nan nodded and said, \"If Wang Xiaoyun ambushes me again, I will be able to catch the Yuan Qi fluctuations he left behind with my lightning-like eyes!\"The last time Wang Xiaoyun appeared, Xiang Nan was unable to sense Wang Xiaoyun's whereabouts, and the appearance of the lightning bolt had greatly improved this point.The fifth form of the Lightning King Seal was a group lightning array. Xiang Nan did not practice this hand seal because the Xiantian Qi contained in his body was not enough.As the name implied, the group lightning formation was a group lightning formation that could trigger a large amount of lightning to smash down together. It was a group attack. This could only be cultivated after Xiang Nan condensed his Yuan Qi.Sixth stance, Tyrant Body Lightning Body.After many failures, Xiang Nan finally succeeded.The moment this palm print succeeded, Xiang Nan's entire body was completely enveloped by a layer of dense electric current!From afar, Xiang Nan had completely turned into a lightning bolt.\"This\" Xiang Nan, who was immersed in thunder and lightning, looked at his hands in shock. He felt that his strength was exploding crazily!Double! Twice! Three times!\"I \u2026 my God! Nine times!\"Xiang Nan felt as if his entire body was about to explode, and the surging power in his body was like waves, as if it was endless.The Divine Grade Lightning Meridian innate talent had tripled in power, and after using the Tyrant Body Lightning Body, it had soared to nine times!He was at the sixth level of the Xiantian realm, and his basic strength was 2,600 jin. A nine-fold eruption had reached an unbelievable 23,400 jin!This was only the basic strength after the explosion. If Xiang Nan made a charge, chop, and other actions, his power would continue to increase.\"Ah, ah, ah, ah!\" Xiang Nan roared. The surging power that he had nowhere to vent caused him to run wildly with his saber in his hand!The moment he charged forward, it immediately turned Xiang Nan into a lightning maniac. As he explosively ran, there was actually a lightning tail that was nearly a meter long behind him!Things frantically retreated in his field of vision. He sprinted through the Treasure Hidden Cave and sprinted wildly through the long corridor.He instantly crossed the corridor. Both sides of the corridor were cracked and broken stones fell off.In the Black Sharp Mountain Range, under the night sky before dawn.Suddenly, a strong light appeared on the mountain where the treasure cave was located. Then, the secret stone door shattered with a boom, and it flew out in a radial manner.At the same time, Xiang Nan rushed out!He jumped into the air and slashed out with his saber. The two-meter saber energy transformed into lightning. The lightning saber energy raged wildly, crazily climbing to ten meters in size!Even the air was engulfed in chaos. Wherever the lightning saber energy passed, the trees and rocks were destroyed.What was even more terrifying was that Xiang Nan soared into the sky, but he did not fall. The powerful explosive power brought by the Tyrant Body Lightning Body could actually make him run wildly in the sky!Lightning Xiang Nan ran wildly through the mountains under the night sky. Every turn turned into a refraction of lightning. He continuously charged left and right in midair, causing thunder-shocking bursts.I can fly! When he used the Tyrannical Body Lightning Body, he actually temporarily possessed the ability to fly.However, Xiang Nan quickly realized the shortcomings of the Tyrannical Lightning Body. Although it was extremely violent, the consumption was astonishing.After Xiang Nan entered the Tyrant Body Lightning Body, he only lasted for five seconds before his body weakened and he quickly fell down.Fortunately, there was a small river flowing between the mountains below, allowing him to fall into the river without falling to his death.Xiang Nan swam weakly to the river bank and lay weakly on the bank, panting for breath. He muttered to himself, \"This \u2026 this Tyrannical Lightning Body is indeed tyrannical, but like Thunder Clap, it can only be used once to weaken.\"At this moment, Xiang Nan probably wouldn't even be able to kill a sheep.\"Something's wrong \u2026 Hmm? My weather is still here.\" Suddenly, Xiang Nan's eyes lit up.It turned out that the Tyrannical Body Lightning Body only consumed physical strength, not the weather! At this moment, the weather in his body was still abundant.'\"In other words\" Xiang Nan was shocked. If I had used the Tyrant Body Lightning Body and entered the weakened stage, I would still be able to use the Lightning Falling and Lightning Flash skills.This is great news.\"Haha \u2026 What a big harvest.\" Xiang Nan lay by the river and laughed loudly.With the Tyrannical Body Lightning Body, Lightning Vibration could be discarded. In the future, when absorbing the lightning source, he could only use the Lightning Vibration to consume the excess divine lightning power in his body.\"I finally have my own trump card.\"Afterwards, he picked a few leaves of the Spring Return Grass and put them into his mouth to chew and swallow.After exhausting his stamina, he could recover through spirit herbs, spirit medicines, and pills.\"With the Six Styles Lightning King Seal, my confidence in the selection in Martial City has increased a lot.\"\"But \u2026 in this way, will my Lightning Meridian talent be exposed?\"Xiang Nan frowned again. Once the Six Styles Thunder King Seal was used, it would produce real thunder and lightning. Anyone with good eyesight would be suspicious at a glance.He thought for a while and finally focused his mind on the giant black-scaled saber. He smiled and said, \"Many people have seen the effects of this saber before. Then give this saber the'blame 'of the lightning produced by the Lightning King Seal.\"He heaved a sigh of relief and said, \"Looks like I have to go to the Black Sharp Demon Forest again. I have to draw out the beast soul of a bird before I can practice the Sparrow King Seal.\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was already the third day he had wandered through the Black-edged Demon Forest. There were still six days left before the Martial Arts City Selection.For the past three days, he had been walking around the Demon Forest's core region, trying to catch a flying demonic beast with a higher realm.By noon, Xiang Nan was leaning against a tree and eating roasted meat. On the ground beside him, there was a Xiantian eighth-level \"yellow finch\" tied to it.Xiang Nan ate a large mouthful of cooked meat and said to himself, \"Although this little bird's cultivation level is not high, it is barely enough. If we can't catch a demonic beast with a higher cultivation level today, then let's just use it.\"Although Xiang Nan had returned to the Black Sharp Demon Forest this time and his cultivation had improved a lot compared to last time, he was still only a Xiantian sixth layer martial artist. Without Miss Ruyan following him, he did not dare to venture into the core region alone.In that core region, any demonic beast was above the Origin Returning Realm. Thinking about it gave him a headache.After eating a large piece of meat and drinking a pot of strong liquor, he stood up and patted the dust on his body a few times, then bent down again and advanced through the demonic forest.Gradually, the sun began to slant to the west, and evening arrived.It was getting dark, but Xiang Nan still found nothing. He stood outside the core area with the yellow finch in his hand, his expression uncertain.Why don't we go in and take a walk? As long as he didn't encounter the wind bull, he should be able to escape, right?Just as Xiang Nan was in a dilemma, a roar suddenly came from the distant Demon Forest core.The roar echoed through the clouds. Even Xiang Nan was so far away that his eardrums hurt. Immediately after, the birds and beasts that filled the sky fled for their lives.\"Not good!\" Xiang Nan was shocked, \"Such a terrifying roar, I'm afraid that a big demonic beast is furious.\"He didn't even dare to think too much, so he ran wildly. No matter who disturbed the demonic beast, as long as it encountered him, it would definitely not let him off, or it would be better to escape.Just as he pulled out his leg and ran wildly, he felt a beam of intense light suddenly arrive from the core region! He shot out from the corner of his eyes.\"Ah! It's a flying bird demonic beast! Its realm is so high!\" Xiang Nan was overjoyed. He really had no place to find after stepping through the iron shoes. The Great Demon was furious and frightened the birds and demonic beasts in the core region out of their wits.That shadow was a flying bird demonic beast, and it flew at an extremely fast speed!A light flashed in Xiang Nan's eyes as he saw clearly the demonic aura of the flying bird demonic beast.\"Origin Realm, 1st level! That's the Gale Sparrow!\"The first level of the Origin Returning Realm was Xiang Nan's most ideal prey! If his cultivation was higher, Xiang Nan wouldn't dare to provoke him.Because demonic beasts didn't know any martial techniques, even though Guiyuan 1st layer was very strong, it was still easier to deal with than Guiyuan 1st layer martial artists.\"Catch up to it!\" Xiang Nan jumped into the air and lightly tapped his toes on the treetop.Flash Shadow Steps!With the help of the ejection force beneath his feet, Xiang Nan turned into an afterimage in a flash and charged 500 meters into the air.This sprint caused the distance between Xiang Nan and the Gale Sparrow to shrink to twenty meters.The Gale Sparrow also noticed Xiang Nan. It turned around and cried out to Xiang Nan.This bird cry actually brought out a thin and narrow wind blade.Xiang Nan raised his hand and slashed the wind blade away.\"Heh! Even if I encounter the Wind Bull again, I'm not afraid of it, let alone you little bird.\"Xiang Nan drew an arc and landed. He poked the treetop with his toes and rushed out with his second flash step. This time, he controlled the distance very precisely, and the landing point was right beside the Gale Sparrow.When Xiang Nan's shadow flashed and appeared beside the Gale Sparrow, the Gale Sparrow seemed to be a little panicked. It blew up all its feathers and let out a cry of alarm.\"Ah, not good!\" Xiang Nan had just raised his saber to cut down, but who would have thought that the Gale Sparrow's scream this time would have fired layers upon layers of wind blades!Xiang Nan did not expect this. He hurriedly moved his saber forward, only to hear the huge black scale saber being smashed by the wind blades.Every time the wind blade struck the black scale, Xiang Nan felt as if he had been hit by a siege car, and all the bones in his body were about to scatter.\"This bastard\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth, the veins on his forehead bulging out.This time, the Wind Blade was much more powerful than the first Wind Blade it released. Clearly, the Gale Sparrow had gone berserk.The intense collision sent Xiang Nan flying back to the ground. The furious Gale Sparrow's eyes were red. It did not continue to flee, but turned into a flash of light and rushed towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan was stunned for a moment and said angrily, \"You little bird, do you still want to imitate Feng Niu's temper? It's against you!\"Xiang Nan raised his hand and slashed out. The first thing he did was to refine his Qi into lightning. The saber Qi was accompanied by crackling lightning as it slashed heavily onto the Gale Sparrow's body.If Xiang Nan was hacking a martial artist, then the martial artist would definitely set up a weather shield to block it, but the Gale Sparrow wouldn't. This saber was actually hitting its body.The Gale Sparrow was struck by Xiang Nan's saber and flew out, screaming miserably.As for Xiang Nan himself, he felt even worse. In the end, he was an Origin Realm demonic beast! The backlash from this strike caused the long saber in Xiang Nan's hand to shake and fly away. He even shot backwards, breaking three towering ancient trees in succession.Xiang Nan felt a mouthful of sweet blood spill down his throat and was forced back by him.The Gale Sparrow flew up from the ground and turned into a ray of light as it charged towards Xiang Nan.\"Still coming?\" Xiang Nan raised his hand and grabbed the giant black-scaled saber in his hand. He jumped up and slashed at the Gale Sparrow again.Boom!Xiang Nan and the Gale Sparrow were blown away by the surging waves.Xiang Nan kept bumping into ancient trees. He was angry and anxious in his heart, but he still didn't dare to use the Tyrannical Body Lightning Body. If he killed the Gale Sparrow with a single slash, then the gains would be more than the losses.Then, the Gale Sparrow flew back and launched its third charge.Xiang Nan was helpless and could only endure the intense pain in his body and continue to fight against the Gale Sparrow.His slashes were heavier and heavier, and the Gale Sparrow's charge was fiercer and fiercer.After ten moves from both sides, Xiang Nan still exploded with three times his strength. He used all of his Qi Condensation and Lightning Condensation. His body was still covered in bruises, and the bones of his right forearm were shattered.The Gale Sparrow also felt uncomfortable, and its feathers fell off a large part of its body, causing it to be in a terrible sorry state.Seeing that the Gale Sparrow was coming again, Xiang Nan's eyes reddened and he angrily said, \"What the hell, don't worry! I hope you can withstand the lightning once.\"As he spoke, his hands quickly formed seals.Thunder King Seal, Lightning Falling!Printed! Xiang Nan's sword-finger slashed down.Failed\"Ah! Damn your grandmother, I failed at such a time!\"The Gale Sparrow hit Xiang Nan's lower abdomen! Xiang Nan was sent flying by the collision.Xiang Nan felt as if his internal organs were about to be shattered. As he shot backwards crazily, he coughed out a large mouthful of blood and stars appeared in front of his eyes.Fortunately, the Gale Sparrow was much weaker, and Xiang Nan was wearing black armor. Otherwise, it would have pierced through Xiang Nan's stomach.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes darkened and he almost fainted.Fortunately, the last time he distributed the pills to Xiang Zhonghua and the others, Xiang Nan had left some of the Rejuvenation Pills for himself. At this moment, he hastily stuffed a Tier 1 Rejuvenation Pill into his mouth.\"Damn it \u2026 this \u2026 this isn't right. Birds should be very docile. Why is this guy getting fiercer and fiercer \u2026\"\"Furthermore, it's a bit incredibly strong.\"Xiang Nan felt that something was amiss and hurriedly formed a seal.Lightning flickered in his eyes, and he could see the situation of the Gale Sparrow even more clearly.Looking at it, Xiang Nan discovered that there was something in the belly of the Gale Sparrow that emitted a strong yellow light.\"Huh? Yellow Essence Pill?\" Xiang Nan was dumbfounded. Why did the Gale Sparrow have the Yellow Essence Pill in its stomach?The Yellow Essence Pill was not a medicinal pill, but a precious treasure bred within the body of a snake-type demonic beast. Generally speaking, a snake-type demonic beast would transform into a flood dragon, and a floodA powerful python demonic beast would give birth to a Yellow Essence Pill after a fortuitous encounter. After that, it would spit out the Yellow Essence Pill to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and the essence of the sun and moon. After repeating this for nearly a hundred years, the Yellow Essence Pill would take shape.At that time, if the snake demon swallowed the refined yellow essence pill, it would be able to transform into a demonic flood dragon.Moreover, not all snake demons could produce the Yellow Essence Pill. It could be said that only one out of 100,000 snake demons could produce such a pill. More snake demonic beasts would continue to cultivate, and their cultivation realms would continue to rise. However, it was impossible for them to become flood dragons for the rest of their lives.\"Then the Yellow Essence Pill \u2026 is clearly ripe.\" Xiang Nan slapped his forehead. That's right!The roar from the Demon Forest Core just now was not the roar of the Great Demon, but the Heaven and Earth phenomenon after the Snake Demon lost the Yellow Essence Pill when it transformed into a flood dragon.This \u2026 this Gale Sparrow actually stole someone else's Yellow Essence Pill?Xiang Nan didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he couldn't laugh anymore. He pointed at the Gale Sparrow and scolded, \"Bastard! What's on your feet!\"There was a ring hanging on the little leg of the Gale Sparrow, and what was that ring that wasn't Xiang Nan's storage ring?It was unknown when the Gale Sparrow had stolen Xiang Nan's storage ring.\"Thief! Give me back my storage ring!\" Xiang Nan was so angry.You're a bird, you know! Not only did you steal the Yellow Essence Pill that someone used to transform into a flood dragon, you even stole my storage ring!The Gale Sparrow's eyes sparkled as it charged towards Xiang Nan.This time, Xiang Nan saw that it didn't want to fight to the death with him, but to snatch his Black Scaled Saber!Xiang Nan was anxious. He quickly formed a seal with both of his hands. He spat out a mouthful of lightning from his mouth to his palm, \"Hao Lightning!\"A ball of lightning rolled away. The ball of lightning grew larger and larger, engulfing the Gale Sparrow. It immediately exploded, causing the bird to instantly stiffen.Xiang Nan quickly formed a seal with both his hands, and his sword finger slashed down, \"Falling Thunder!\"The moment the Gale Sparrow regained its freedom, lightning flashed in the sky and an arm-thick bolt of lightning descended without warning, hitting the back of the Gale Sparrow.The Gale Sparrow was instantly sliced to the ground, not moving at all.Xiang Nan panted heavily and came to the Gale Sparrow's side. He took a closer look and found that the thief was still alive.He removed his storage ring from the bird's leg, put it on his index finger, and condensed lightning into his finger. He was about to poke it down at the Gale Sparrow.The Soul Absorbing Needle was needed to extract the beast soul of a demonic beast, but the Thunder King Seal that Xiang Nan cultivated contained the function of extracting the beast soul.The lightning in his hand shrank to the thickness of a needle, but after aiming at the head of the Gale Sparrow, his heart softened again.Seeing the little bird lying on the ground with tears in its eyes, Xiang Nan could not do anything.This thing had cultivated for quite some time. It was already human. It could even shed tears when feeling sad. It was really strange and unbearable.\"Sigh \u2026 Forget it.\" Xiang Nan sighed and said, \"I won't smoke your beast soul anymore, but you have to promise me that you will help me cultivate the Sparrow King Seal.\"It wasn't impossible to directly use demonic beasts to form the Sparrow King Seal, but there was one drawback. If the Gale Sparrow escaped, Xiang Nan wouldn't be able to release the Sparrow King Seal skill.The little bird lay on the ground, looking pitifully at Xiang Nan without moving.Xiang Nan said helplessly, \"Don't worry, I'll let you go when I catch a new bird demonic beast in the future.\"Finally, Little Sparrow nodded in understanding.\"Damn, it's really scary.\" Xiang Nan held the bird in his hand, \"They say that demonic beasts have a high cultivation level and can understand human nature, but your cultivation level is not high.\"\"Oh right, it must be because of the Yellow Essence Pill. If you swallow the Yellow Essence Pill, you will definitely have a bright future in the future. I can't bear to kill you either.\"Who told him to be soft-hearted?Xiang Nan placed the Gale Sparrow on his shoulder and left the Black Sharp Demon Forest.Instead of returning to the Xiang manor, he went to the treasure cave in the Black Sharp Mountain Range and started cultivating the Sparrow King Seal here.Since this little bird could understand human language, it would be much easier.After several hundred consecutive failures, Xiang Nan finally succeeded in forming the Sparrow King Seal.\"Come!\" Xiang Nan shouted in a low voice.The bird immediately jumped into Xiang Nan's palm and was wrapped in dense lightning.Xiang Nan took a step forward and threw the bird forward, shouting, \"Thunder King Seal, Thunder Bird!\"The little bird passed through the palm print and instantly transformed into a lightning bird made of pure lightning!The lightning bird flapped its wings and crackled as it collided with the Spirit Measuring Stone Puppet.This collision actually sent the puppet flying. The puppet smashed into the wall and sneaked deep into the mountain.Xiang Nan was stunned and shocked, \"What a great power!\"He took out the puppet and looked again. There was actually a bowl-shaped half-circle pit on the puppet's chest, and it was as deep as a fist! Moreover, there were dense cracks at the edges of the crater.This Sparrow King Seal was truly even stronger than Luo Lightning! With the naked eye, the King Sparrow Seal's lethality was currently around five times that of the Thunder Falling Seal.As for the Sparrow King Seal, it only consumed three times the amount of lightning.\"Hu \u2026 it's finally done.\" Xiang Nan heaved a sigh of relief and said, \"I'll be in Martial Arts City in six days. During this period of time, I need to properly master it \u2026 Where's my storage ring?\"Xiang Nan shouted angrily in the cave.There were a total of six styles of the Thunder King Seal. Xiang Nan could only learn five of them at present, but the advantage was that the Thunder King Seal was different from other cultivation methods. There was no small success, only the difference between proficient and unproficient.This was because the Thunder King Seal was determined by Xiang Nan's weather. The stronger Xiang Nan's weather was, the more powerful the Thunder King Seal would be.Currently, Xiang Nan's speed and proficiency in sealing were still very beginner. In the following days, he chose to stay here and practice sealing gestures non-stop every day.As for the little bird, it had temporarily become Xiang Nan's pet. However, it had to eat a large amount of spiritual herbs, which made Xiang Nan's flesh hurt.\"What the hell? I don't know what happened to you.\" Xiang Nan touched the little bird's head and said, \"A bird demonic beast actually likes to steal things. I really don't know who you learned it from.\"Xiang Nan was helpless and began to practice sealing. Suddenly, he found that his right index finger was empty\"Where's my storage ring! You stinking bird stole it for me again!\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 New, Lightning Rushing BladePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euIn the following days, Xiang Nan had been cultivating in the Treasure Cave, and he had to undergo a large number of complicated sealing exercises every day.Because the Thunder King Seal itself was the purest form of Qi Cultivation Technique, Xiang Nan had unknowingly surpassed the other martial artists of the same level in terms of the intensity of his Innate Weather during the days he cultivated the Thunder King Seal.This level was naturally a Xiantian realm martial artist.At the same time, he also used this period of time to examine his experience after his rebirth. He could say that in less than half a year after his rebirth, what he experienced was even more colorful than his previous life.In his previous life, Bai Muchen's reputation as the number one genius in the starry sky had given him unparalleled glory, and at the same time, it had made it impossible for him to see the real world.If you are a high-ranking person, then everyone else, good and bad, will greet you with a smile that makes you unable to see the real dark side of the world.Or perhaps it could be said that Bai Muchen had lived for eighteen years under the protection of the Profound Sky Sect in his previous life, but he was a pure-minded, hot-blooded youth.However, Xiang Nan's experience in this life was completely different from his previous life! Almost every outsider was hostile to Xiang Nan, which allowed Xiang Nan's mind to begin to leap forward, quickly mature, and gain a clearer understanding of the world.Then there was the little Gale Sparrow. Xiang Nan had thought that this stolen bird would find a way to escape, but that was not the case.The little bird enjoyed following Xiang Nan because Xiang Nan could always feed it some leaves of spiritual herbs.The Yellow Essence Pill was a genius treasure that the Snake Demon needed to transform into a flood dragon, but now that it was eaten by the little bird, this was probably the first time that the world had been opened up.Even Xiang Nan couldn't tell what this bird would evolve into in the future, but from the looks of it, the Yellow Essence Pill gave the bird a space for a \"hungry period\" after its death.This little bird eats almost everything! Not only does it eat spiritual herbs and grain, it even occasionally absorbs Xiang Nan's lightning power.Xiang Nan was also happy with the beauty of an adult bird. As long as he wanted to eat those expensive Tier 1, Tier 2, or even Tier 3 spirit herbs, Xiang Nan would feed them to him without reservation.The reason why Xiang Nan did this was on the one hand because this little bird was quite cute, and on the other hand, because the two of them had the intention of \"cherishing each other\".Xiang Nan was destined to embark on an extraordinary life, and this little bird was also walking on an extraordinary \"bird life\".Treasure Cave.\"Hu \u2026\" Xiang Nan succeeded for the hundredth time, forming the most complicated Sparrow King Seal, and finally stretched.\"I'm already proficient in controlling five types of palm prints.\" Xiang Nan raised his palm, and the Xiantian Qi in his body focused on his palm like flowing clouds and flowing water.The little bird stood on Xiang Nan's shoulder and gently poked Xiang Nan's cheek with its mouth.Xiang Nan smiled and picked a leaf of the Second Grade Spirit Grass Snake Gallbladder Flower, sending it to the little bird's mouth.The little bird immediately cheerfully grabbed it and swallowed it.Xiang Nan took a deep breath and looked at the black-scaled saber lying horizontally between his legs. \"Although the Lightning King Seal is strong, it is still the purest move to use Qi. I still need to find a common body skill.\"As he spoke, he took out a pen and paper, pondered for a moment, and then wrote down the scripture on the blank book.The Running Thunder Spear was the only body skill he had, but the spear technique was too low and was no longer suitable for Xiang Nan. Hence, Xiang Nan had a sudden idea to rewrite a new one according to his current formidable weather.The Thunder Running Saber had a total of four styles: Raptor Waving Tail, Azure Dragon Exiting the Sea, Berserk Dragon Battle Tide, and Dragon Shocking Day.In the Black Sharp Mountain Range, a mountain peak towered into the clouds.Xiang Nan looked at the sea of clouds and breathed in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to his heart's content. His eyes were sharp and he was making a posture of drawing a saber. He held the hilt of the saber in his right hand and pressed the saber with his left hand.Fierce Dragon Position was a hand stance. To be exact, it was a saber pull stance. It relied on the instant the saber was pulled out to make a powerful attack.He recalled the incantation he had created in his heart, and his eyes suddenly flashed with light as he shouted, \"The Raptor wagged its tail!\"As soon as he finished speaking, the weather in his body stirred up, and a violent saber pulling motion came with a large horizontal slash!This time, Xiang Nan chopped out an incomparably large crescent blade Qi. The blade Qi was already close to a complete circle, and it was the shape of a large crescent moon.The power of this saber slash was incomparably powerful. The saber qi swept out against the upper end of the sea of clouds, causing the boundless white clouds to be shocked into a wave of clouds.\"Yes.\" Xiang Nan nodded in satisfaction, \"I put the Lightning King Seal's Qi Condensation Method into the Lightning Rushing Spear. Sure enough, I obtained a great response. Looking at the power of the saber, I'm afraid the Lightning Rushing Saber is already comparable to an Earthly Elementary Grade Cultivation Method.\"Afterwards, he trained the Azure Dragon to go out to sea.The Azure Dragon went out to sea in a charging style. Xiang Nan held the hilt of the saber in his right hand and pushed down the tip of the saber. Almost half of the front of the saber was inserted into the rock. At the same time, his right arm was elbowed, and his elbow was on the back of the saber to provide support.Afterwards, the weather inside his body exploded violently, and his entire body bombarded forward. There was an aura of a person charging forward, and everything had to be avoided.Because his charge was too fierce, his large amount of early weather created a rapid friction with the air, causing a flame to rise. As for Xiang Nan, he was advancing against that flame. Just the visual impact alone was shocking to the heavens!After charging to its limit, Xiang Nan raised the giant saber that had plunged straight into the ground! The giant saber raised up and picked out a large crescent saber Qi that was even more powerful than the Raptor's tail swing!From the time he charged to the end of the charge, even the ground trembled.\"The effect is not trivial.\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth. The excitement brought about by the charge hadn't dissipated yet.He merged the principle of the Flash Steps into the charging process, allowing the charging to become faster and fiercer! However, the Azure Dragon's speed at sea was slightly slower than the Flash Step because of the large amount of pre-weather that erupted during the charge, causing friction with the air.At the end of the charge, he used the Raptor's tail swing as a reference. He used the earth as his scabbard and used the power of charging and drawing to execute a slash that was even more powerful than the Raptor's tail swing.The third was the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide.Xiang Nan moved like a dragon with his saber in his hand. The huge black saber in Xiang Nan's hand began to slash violently!Each slash was aimed at the sky, and each slash was even more powerful than the previous one! A blade was stronger than a blade, and a blade was fiercer than a blade!The air above the sea of clouds howled and bees roared. The sea of clouds beneath it was lifted up with waves that could not remain calm.This Berserk Dragon Battle Tide relied on its momentum to borrow the power of the first saber to slash out. Xiang Nan swung his energy and slashed out a second saber. The power was stronger than the first saber, followed by the next two, three, four, seven, and ten sabers.Before he could retreat, his posterior momentum had risen again! This allowed Xiang Nan to continuously break through his physical limit, break through, break through again!Liked it?

I hope it will succeed.\"Afterwards, he abruptly placed the saber in front of him, his eyes looking into the distance through the sharp edge of the saber.Immediately afterwards, the weather in his body surged once again, and then he slashed out at Fang Fang with a knife!This saber slashed out a five-meter-long saber Qi. The saber Qi was about the same size as the Raptor's tail swing, but the strength of the saber Qi was not as strong as the Raptor's tail swing.But \u2026 this was not the end!Xiang Nan immediately used the lightning vein attribute to entangle the saber qi, causing it to no longer advance violently, but to slow down greatly.Moreover, Xiang Nan struck out a second time! The second saber qi quickly rushed out and merged into the slowly advancing saber qi.The two five-meter-long saber Qi merged into a broader, larger, six-meter-long saber Qi, but this was still not the end!Xiang Nan immediately chopped out a third blade, a fourth blade \u2026 a ninth blade, a tenth blade!He slashed ten times in a row, and the ten saber energies merged together to form a huge saber energy that was three meters wide and fifteen meters long!The width and height of this saber qi were incomparably astonishing. Although it was fifteen meters tall, it looked like it gave off a heaven-piercing visual shock!\"Shocking Dragon, Sunshine!\" Xiang Nan leapt up, the saber in his hand pierced through the saber Qi, and he actually felt like he was in harmony with the saber. Then, he slashed down vertically with a single strike.The enormous saber Qi moved!The saber qi rumbled and slashed out, causing the rocks to shatter and the sea of clouds to boil!The saber qi slanted downwards and slammed into a mountain wall. The mountain wall instantly collapsed and was destroyed.Xiang Nan retracted his momentum. His gaze was like lightning as he unleashed a ferocious set of Thunder Rushing Sabers, causing Xiang Nan's own heart to surge, and his battle intent to soar to the heavens!Battle was all about fighting intent! The higher the fighting spirit, the more ferocious the momentum became.\"Hu \u2026 it's done.\" A smile appeared on Xiang Nan's face, and the little bird circling in the sky landed on his shoulder.\"Little fellow, I'll take you home.\"Counting the days, there were still two days left before the selection of Martial Arts City. It was time to return to the human world.After returning from cultivating in the Black Sharp Mountain Range, Xiang Nan's temperament was completely different. His entire body emitted a sense of vicissitudes. Although his eyes were calm, they were filled with sharp light.During his cultivation days, he had reflected on his previous life, which made him understand that in this world where the weak preyed on the strong, kindness to others might not be rewarded with kindness.Only with strength could one have the ability to speak.He mounted the Wind Chasing Horse and rode away, slowly arriving at the Blue Rock City area.\"My realm has loosened. It shouldn't be long before I can break through to the seventh level of the Xiantian realm.\"As he muttered to himself, he also saw a strange scene. He passed through several small towns and saw that the towns were decorated with lanterns and had a strong festive atmosphere.Xiang Nan was surprised and asked an old man who was hoeing the ground, \"Old sir, what's wrong here? Why are there red lanterns hanging in every house?\"Seeing Xiang Nan's dusty appearance, the old man said, \"He came from other places, didn't he? You probably don't know that today is a joyous day for our entire Blue Rock City region.\"\"Because the Martial Arts City Selection is about to open, all the powerful sect messengers have come.\"\"Those sect messengers are holding a banquet in Bluestone City. All the martial practitioners from the various towns have gone.\"\"So that's the case\" Xiang Nan suddenly realized that the Martial Arts Town Selection was the only day for all the young people in the six towns of Bluestone City to make a name for themselves. Now that the sect envoys had arrived, it was only natural that the entire family would be decorated with lanterns and colored lights.\"Thank you, old man.\" Xiang Nan cupped his fists and cupped his hands. He stepped onto the Wind Chasing Foal and continued on his way.\"Looks like I'm still a little late. The sect envoys have begun to host a banquet. I'm afraid I'll be late if I rush over now.\"\"I just don't know how Xiang Zhonghua and the others are cultivating.\"With this thought in his heart, Xiang Nan felt even more eager to return.\"I'm back!\" After returning to the Xiang manor, Xiang Nan laughed loudly and shouted.\"Aiya, Xiaonan, you're back.\" Xiang Shaohua was the first to charge forward. He grabbed Xiang Nan's arm and said, \"I thought you wouldn't be able to catch up. Now, the sect envoys \u2026\"\"Father, I already know.\" Xiang Nan smiled and nodded. \"It's fine. I'll be heading to Blue Rock City soon.\"\" Little Nan .\" Xiang Shaohua looked at Xiang Nan with satisfaction and said, \"You seem to have grown a little taller and your body is much stronger.\"The childishness on Xiang Nan's face had already been washed away by bitter cultivation. The edges and corners of his face were even more resolute, and the aura of a man was beginning to show.Sixteen years old was a good time to grow his body. With his hard cultivation and the nourishment of spiritual herbs, Xiang Nan's height was already close to 1.8 meters.Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Where are Brother Zhong Hua and Sister Fei? They should have already arrived at Bluestone City, right?\"At this point, Xiang Shaohua's face darkened and he hesitated, \"This \u2026\"Xiang Nan frowned and said, \"What's wrong?\"\"Sigh, you can ask yourself.\" Xiang Shaohua shook his head.\"Are they still in the Xiang manor?\" Xiang Nan was greatly surprised. Since when did Zhong Hua and the others stay at home?He vaguely felt that something had happened and immediately rushed to Xiang Zhonghua's room.The moment he pushed open the door, a faint aura of blood filled the room.Xiang Nan saw Xiang Zhonghua sitting cross-legged on the bed, and Xiang Fei and the others were also there.\"Brother, are you injured?\" Xiang Nan frowned.Xiang Zhonghua forced a smile, \" little Nan , hurry up and go to Bluestone City. There \u2026\"Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes and asked in a deep voice, \"What happened? Who injured you?\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan noticed that not only was Xiang Shaohua injured, even Xiang Fei and the rest of his peers were slightly injured.Facing Xiang Nan's many questions, Xiang Zhonghua only sighed and didn't say anything else. He said, \"Don't be distracted for us, you go.\"Xiang Fei, however, could not continue listening. She angrily said, \"Isn't it Cai Jianyun who did this?\"\"Little brother Nan, when you left the Xiang manor to cultivate, Cai Jianyun brought a group of people to find you to pick a fight with.\"\"They stood in the doorway and insulted you. Zhong Hua couldn't listen anymore. He stood up for you, but he was viciously insulted by Cai Jianyun who injured us.\"\"Then Cai Jianyun also said \u2026\"The anger in Xiang Nan's heart was almost out of control. He asked in a deep voice, \"What else did he say?\"Xiang Fei gritted her teeth and said, \"He also said that if we see each other in the future, he will beat us once. If we dare to go to Bluestone City, he will break Zhong Hua's dog leg.\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Quickly stop talking.\" Xiang Zhonghua hurriedly interrupted Xiang Fei and scolded, \"It's not like you don't know little Nan 's temper. If you tell him this now, it can only affect his mentality.\"\"Haha \u2026 Cai Jianyun.\" Xiang Nan's voice became even deeper.Xiang Zhonghua hurriedly said, \" little Nan , don't be impulsive. Although Cai Jianyun is the second expert of the same generation, he is from the city. More than half of the top 20 experts in our group are close to Cai Jianyun.\"\"Right now, the city selection is imminent. We would rather offend Mo Hai, the number one expert, than touch Cai Jianyun.\"Hearing this, Xiang Nan laughed heartily and said, \"He, Cai Jianyun, said that if we dare to go to Bluestone City, he will break your dog leg? Alright, Brother Zhong Hua, Sister Fei, come with me!\"\"I want to see how he breaks your legs!\"Xiang Zhonghua originally intended to persuade Xiang Nan, but when he saw the unquestionable expression between Xiang Nan's eyebrows, he swallowed his words back into his stomach.Bluestone City.The city selection was imminent, and the various sect envoys responsible for recruiting outer sect disciples in Wolong Prefecture had all arrived.Among them, there were three sects, the Cavalry Sect, the Absolute Saber Sect, the White Sword Sect, the Fierce Tiger Sect, the Berserk Lion Sect, and the Second Grade Sect, Chihuo Sect. There were a total of six sects.At this moment, the six sects held a banquet in the Colosseum of Bluestone City, entertaining the young geniuses of Bluestone City and giving a speech to recruit disciples.Every sect did their utmost to describe their own sect's strength in words, as well as how bright the future of young people would be after joining their own sect.Only Wang Xiaoyun, the messenger of the Chihuo Sect , did not say a word from above. He did not need to speak at all. With just the words Chihuo Sect , he had absolute weight.Under the envelopment of the Chihuo Sect , the five third-grade sects could be said to be subservient to the Chihuo Sect . They all had flattering looks and were eager to establish a good relationship with the Chihuo Sect .For this banquet, Bluestone City had even spared no expense in providing all the facilities, delicacies, and wine.Whether the young people of Bluestone City could jump through the Dragon Gate and change their future depended on the selection of Martial Arts City in two days.At this moment, the Wang Clan was the most proud of themselves. Wang Changhe was sitting on the first seat, and his seat was even higher than the City Lord's! It was all because of his eldest son, Wang Xiaoyun.Wang Xiaoyun was speaking from a high place. He looked around the crowd and said, \"I believe there is no need to say anything else. Everyone knows the status and strength of the Chihuo Sect .\"\"That's, that's.\" The elders of Berserk Lion Sect nodded their heads and flattered Wang Xiaoyun.The elders of the other sects were also eager to flatter him, expressing how much they admired the Chihuo Sect .The seats in the spectators' seats had long since been pulled out and replaced with wine tables. The representatives of the various clans raised their glasses to express their admiration for Chihuo Sect.On the huge open space inside the Colosseum were the contestants who had come to participate in the competition.\"Xiaoyun, Brother Xiaoyun has done a lot for our Bluestone City.\" Mo Hai sat beside Wang Jingyun and said with a smile.\"That's!\" Li Qingchuan said proudly, \"Brother Xiaoyun is the number one figure in our Bluestone City. He will definitely be able to dominate the Blue Tide Continent in the future.\"Wang Jingyun smiled sweetly and said, \"Thank you for your lucky words.\"At the other table, Cai Jianyun and the others walked over with wine glasses in their hands. These people were all powerful, and their average strength even surpassed Mo Hai's group.\"What are they doing here?\" When Li Qingchuan saw Cai Jianyun walk over, he lowered his voice and said, \"We must be on guard against this Cai Jianyun.\"Wang Jingyun smiled and stood up to welcome Cai Jianyun, saying, \"Jianyun.\"Cai Jianyun smiled faintly. The dozen or so super experts beside him made him feel extremely confident. However, he said, \"Jingyun, Mo Hai, let me propose a toast to you.\"\"Xiao Yun has made an appearance this time. He is worthy of being a great hero of our Blue Stone City. When the time comes, I hope that Jing Yun can put in a good word for me in front of Brother Xiao Yun.\"\"After all, the names of the three of us carry the word 'Yun'. This is not a shallow fate.\"Mo Hai and Li Qingchuan also stood up. Mo Hai raised his glass and said, \"Jianyun is too polite. We still hope that you can show mercy to us in the city selection. Haha.\"\"No, no, Mo Hai is too polite.\" Wang Jianyun smiled faintly and then said, \"I don't dare to call myself merciful, but \u2026 maybe we can cooperate.\"\"Oh?\" Mo Hai raised his eyebrows and subconsciously looked at Wang Jingyun.Cai Jianyun lowered his voice and said, \"Although we don't have a deep relationship, we have a common enemy.\"\"Xiang Nan.\" The smile on Mo Hai's face disappeared.\"That's right.\" Cai Jianyun nodded, \"This child is arrogant. He has to be beaten.\"Li Qingchuan laughed loudly, \"That brat? I already wanted to teach him a lesson! Coincidentally, this Martial Arts City Selection is a good opportunity.\"As he spoke, a group of people walked in from the entrance.\"Huh?\" Cai Jianyun was in a position where he could see the entrance. He saw Xiang Zhonghua and the others with a single glance.Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai looked towards the Xiang Clan team at the same time.Xiang Zhonghua and the others sensed Cai Jianyun's cold and fierce gaze, and Mo Hai and the others, who were eyeing Mo Hai covetously, were afraid to walk into the banquet hall.Cai Jianyun laughed from afar, \"Isn't this Zhong Hua? What, have you forgotten what I said? Your dog leg doesn't want it anymore?\"His voice was so loud that all the contestants immediately stopped and looked towards the Xiang Clan.Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai's team represented the highest battle prowess of the younger generation. Now that the two teams were standing together, they were simply existences that no one dared to provoke. They were so frightened that no one dared to say anything.Xiang Zhonghua was humiliated by Cai Jianyun, and his face immediately turned red. He opened his mouth, but didn't know how to respond.At this moment, a figure flashed out from behind Xiang Zhonghua. This person was carrying a huge black saber. It was Xiang Nan.The moment Xiang Nan appeared, Cai Jianyun, Mo Hai, Li Qingchuan, and the others narrowed their eyes.Everyone originally thought that Xiang Nan would make a harsh remark first and return the favor to Cai Jianyun, but who would have thought that this was not the case?Xiang Nan asked directly, \"Brother Zhong Hua, who injured you? Is it Cai Jianyun himself or his subordinates?\"The distant city lord also noticed Xiang Nan. Seeing that Xiang Nan's expression was not good and he was afraid that Xiang Nan would cause trouble, he stood up and said, \" little Nan , today is the wedding day of Bluestone City. Don't act recklessly.\"\"Oh? Is he Xiang Nan?\" The messengers of the five third-grade sects looked at Xiang Nan differently.The elder of the Absolute Saber Sect said, \"I've long heard that one of the top contestants in this year's competition is called Xiang Nan.

In front of him, no one could compare to the second to fifth place.As for Mo Hai, Cai Jianyun, and the others, they represented the highest combat strength of the old school contestants!Now that the new and old sects were on the verge of war, everyone felt that a good show was about to be played out.\"Brother, who hurt you? Name him.\" Xiang Nan faced everyone's gazes, but he was not afraid. He had the posture of causing a huge commotion in the Colosseum.\"It's the person behind Cai Jianyun.\" Xiang Zhonghua finally mustered up his courage and pointed at a tall and thin man standing behind Xiang Zhonghua.\"This person's name is Huang Tianyu. He is a nineteen-year-old Xiantian eighth layer expert. He possesses a rare talent for the wind meridians of ordinary grades. His cultivation method is the Water Severing Slash. He is very tyrannical,\" Xiang Zhonghua said.\"Especially since his strength ranking is extremely high, he is almost on par with Li Qingchuan, who has the same wind vein. He is only half a notch behind Li Qingchuan.\"Xiang Nan's gaze fell on Huang Tianyu. He was tall and thin, with a hooked nose and thin lips. From the looks of it, he was an unkind person.Huang Tianyu's weapon was a pair of half-meter scimitars.In today's world of martial arts, martial artists are generally used to using giant weapons. That's because martial artists often have to fight large demonic beasts, and giant weapons can play a better role.Huang Tianyu's pair of daggers looked exceptionally different, but this also showed that Huang Tianyu was a speed type martial artist.\"What?\" Cai Jianyun sneered and said, \"Hearing this, are you still here to take revenge? You really don't know whether to die or not.\"\"Xiang Nan.\" Wang Xiaoyun, the messenger of the Chihuo Sect , spoke in a faint voice that was transmitted to the ears of everyone present through Yuan Qi.He said, \"This place is full of sects. How can you be so wild?\"Once these words were spoken, everyone thought that there was no longer any liveliness. The six sects were all here, and no one dared to speak loudly. No one believed that there were still people who dared to cause trouble here.However, Xiang Nan walked to the nearest table, picked up a bowl of liquor and drank it all in one gulp. He smashed the bowl to the ground and laughed loudly, \"Wang Xiaoyun! Don't think I don't know what you did.\"Next, Xiang Nan pointed at Wang Xiaoyun, the messenger of the Chihuo Sect that everyone wanted to curry favor with, and shouted, \"You'd better pray that I can't come out.\"\"If I, Xiang Nan, have the day to turn around, I will definitely not spare you!\"Nuoda's Colosseum was completely silent after hearing Xiang Nan's words.Crazy! Then Xiang Nan is really crazy! It was too late for everyone to curry favor with Wang Xiaoyun, but this Nan actually dared to point at Wang Xiaoyun and curse angrily!Moreover, how could such words be put on the table? Even if you, Xiang Nan, hate in your heart, you still hide it in your heart. If you say it in front of everyone, wouldn't it be a fight with Wang Xiaoyun?Wang Xiaoyun was also stunned by Xiang Nan's scolding. The veins on his forehead bulged, but in front of the other sects, he couldn't personally go down and fight Xiang Nan, could he?\"Good, good, good!\" Wang Xiaoyun's face turned red with anger. He also pointed at Xiang Nan and said, \"You have guts! You really have guts!\"\"But!\" Wang Xiaoyun's eyes turned cold as he shouted, \"I don't care if you, Xiang Nan, are a bug or a dragon. Today, you have to pinch your tail for me! The city selection is imminent, and no private battles are allowed! If you dare to move, I will immediately disqualify you from the city selection!\"Everyone was in an uproar. Wang Xiaoyun's threat was too powerful! This time, he'll see what you do, Xiang Nan. Do you want revenge, or do you want to run for the election?Unexpectedly, Xiang Nan picked up another bowl of liquor and drank it up. He laughed loudly and said, \"Earlier on Welcome Street, Mo Hai Wang Jingyun and Li Qingchuan injured my Xiang Family and forcefully attacked me. How can this be settled?\"\"A few days ago, Cai Jianyun led a group of henchmen to the Xiang manor and injured more than a dozen of my brothers and sisters. How can we settle this debt?\"\"You said you can't fight privately before the city election?\" Xiang Nan laughed loudly, \"They hurt people first! If you want to disqualify me, disqualify them first!\"\"If you don't disqualify them now, there's no reason for you to interfere with me!\"Xiang Nan's words were like needles, causing Wang Xiaoyun's heart to bleed. Wang Xiaoyun was stunned from choking. He opened his mouth several times, not knowing how to return the favor to Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan also knew that breaking up with Wang Xiaoyun would not do him any good, but saving his face? It had already been torn apart.I, Xiang Nan, told you to take a step, but you all moved closer. I'll take another step, and you'll force me to take another step. Do you really think that I, Xiang Nan, have such a good temper?It wasn't magnanimity that was obtained by blindly tolerating, but the other party was even more unscrupulous!Seeing that Wang Xiaoyun was speechless, Xiang Nan laughed loudly, \"What, don't you punish them? If you don't punish them, I will make a move!\"As soon as he finished speaking, Xiang Nan clanged his black-scaled saber out of his back. The saber was buzzing in the cold wind.\"Cao! This brat really wants to make a move!\" The other spectators stood up in unison, their faces filled with disbelief.However, most of them gave Xiang Nan a thumbs up in their hearts.\"Copy the guy!\" Under Cai Jianyun's command, the friends beside him drew out their weapons one after another.On Mo Hai's side, many experts looked at each other and revealed their weapons. They chose to form an alliance with Cai Jianyun.\"Hahahaha, good job!\" Xiang Nan looked up and smiled. He stabbed the giant saber into the ground, held it in his right hand, and put his left elbow on the back of the saber. He shouted, \"Azure Dragon, go out to sea!\"In an instant, Xiang Nan turned into flames and charged in Huang Tianyu's direction!None of Mo Hai, Cai Jianyun, Li Qingchuan, Wang Jingyun, and the others had expected Xiang Nan to attack so violently!Everyone showed their martial skills to block Xiang Nan.But Xiang Nan's charge was too fast! Too fierce! He was like a fierce roaring tiger, instantly bombarding through the gaps between all the experts.The few experts weren't prepared enough, but they were sent flying by Xiang Nan!Everyone was shocked! Even experts as strong as Mo Hai and Cai Jianyun were sent flying by Xiang Nan's attack?\"What kind of martial skill is this?\" The faces of all the spectators turned deathly pale.Looking at the battle scene, Xiang Nan only had one target, Huang Tianyu!None of the martial artists blocking Xiang Nan's path of advancement were able to withstand the Azure Dragon and flew into the sky on both sides.When Xiang Nan's charge arrived in front of Huang Tianyu, he left behind a hand and didn't release his final saber-drawing slash. Otherwise, he would definitely slash Huang Tianyu at the waist this time!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he was stunned by Xiang Nan's domineering martial skill, he still dodged immediately.Especially when Huang Tianyu stood behind the crowd. He had enough time to react. When Xiang Nan's charge arrived in front of him, Huang Tianyu immediately leapt out.Huang Tianyu's wind meridian talent had a miraculous effect at this moment. His figure moved like a spirit monkey, and his body was covered in the breeze. He jumped seven to eight meters high with a shout, just in time to avoid Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon from going out to sea.At the same time, Huang Tianyu also made a counterattack. The scimitars in his hands began to spin rapidly, causing a strong wind to whistle in the air. He coldly shouted, \"Destroy the water!\"Swoosh! The two high-speed rotating scimitars, with strong weather, transformed into two wind wheels! They drew a big arc and pinched Xiang Nan from the left and right.\"Competing with me in speed?\" The corner of Xiang Nan's mouth rose slightly, \"You're still a little tender.\"As soon as he finished speaking, Xiang Nan's body suddenly turned into an afterimage and disappeared!The two scimitars hit the spot where Xiang Nan was standing earlier, splitting open two deep cracks.\"Not good!\" Huang Tianyu missed a move and hurriedly pulled back his hands, pulling back the two scimitars on the ground.However, at this moment, a shadow appeared at the corner of Huang Tianyu's eyes. When he was caught off guard and looked up, his entire body trembled.\"So fast!\" Everyone cried out in shock!Xiang Nan was actually faster than Huang Tianyu! In a flash, he reached Huang Tianyu's head.Huang Tianyu, who was known as a speed expert, didn't even have time to react when he was slapped on the back by Xiang Nan's saber.Huang Tianyu was slapped into an afterimage and heavily smashed into the ground. The impact force was so great that Huang Tianyu actually bounced back four to five meters! The entire ground shook!The tables and chairs in the surroundings were shaken to the point that they jumped up.\"Wow!\" Huang Tianyu was knocked into the air in a flat position. At that time, two ribs were broken and blood sprayed out of his mouth!At this moment, Cai Jianyun, Mo Hai, and the others rushed back one after another because the battle between Xiang Nan and Huang Tianyu was too short! It was only a few seconds.They wanted to stop Xiang Nan, but Xiang Nan held the back of Huang Tianyu's neck, and a flash step turned into an afterimage that pierced through the gaps between the experts.Peng!Huang Tianyu was heavily thrown in front of Xiang Zhonghua by Xiang Nan. Then, Xiang Nan kicked Huang Tianyu's leg and kicked him so hard that he knelt in front of Xiang Zhonghua. With this kick, he heard the crisp sound of his bones breaking.Xiang Zhonghua broke out in cold sweat. With his strength, he could no longer understand how strong Xiang Nan was now!Xiang Nan was expressionless, but the blade of the giant saber rested on Huang Tianyu's neck and he said calmly, \"Apologize.\"Huang Tianyu's veins bulged with pain, but he gritted his teeth and said, \"You dare to kill me?\"Xiang Nan sneered as he leaned his mouth close to Huang Tianyu's ear and whispered, \"What else do you think I don't dare to do?\"Hearing this, Huang Tianyu's mouth trembled. He was scared. This time, he was really scared!At this moment, Huang Tianyu could no longer care about his face. He immediately turned pale and said to Xiang Zhonghua, \"Xiang Zhonghua, I have let you down. I apologize to you. Please forgive me.\"\"Please, I don't want to die. Don't let Xiang Nan kill me \u2026\"Xiang Zhonghua's chest rose and fell violently, and he felt indescribably happy in his heart!Xiang Nan smiled and kicked Huang Tianyu to the side.On the other side, Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai had already rushed over angrily. Cai Jianyun laughed furiously, \"Good! Good! Good!\"He looked at his follower, Huang Tianyu, who had been beaten like a dead dog by Xiang Nan. He immediately said good-bye three times and shouted, \"You dare to move my men! Xiang Nan, I let you in today, but you can't get out!\"Xiang Nan looked up and smiled. He reached out with his right hand and pulled out a small wine jar from under the wine table beside him. He drank a few large mouthfuls of strong liquor into the jar.Then, he shattered the wine jar, placed his saber across his chest, and shouted, \"Come! If you want to fight, then let's have a good fight!\"This time, even Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei were frightened. Xiang Fei hurriedly said, \" little Nan , don't! If the fight continues, you will really be disqualified.\"At this moment, Xiang Nan had already reached the limit of the tolerance of several sects. If he exceeded this limit, no matter how reasonable Xiang Nan was, the sects would probably not sit idly by and ignore him.Xiang Nan laughed loudly, \"So what! Today, I'll just risk everything. Killing one is enough, killing two is enough!\"\"I can lose my qualifications for the city selection, but I can't lose our Xiang Clan's dignity!\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan's foot had already stepped on Huang Tianyu's head. That clearly meant that the first person to kill Huang Tianyu would be killed in a battle.Many young men from the Xiang Clan were stunned. Then, they took out their weapons and silently stood beside Xiang Nan.Although they didn't say anything, their actions had already shown their stance. Even if they killed each other today, they still had to accompany Xiang Nan until the end!\"Enough!\" At the critical moment when both sides were at war and a great battle was about to break out, City Lord Hong Zhen finally couldn't help it.Hong Zhen's face turned red from anger. He flew up into the sky and shouted, \"All of you, stop! Don't you think it's embarrassing enough!\"Looks like City Lord Hong Zhen is really furious. With his status as City Lord, he actually scolded the swordsmanship that martial artists used to scold back then.\"Enough?\" Cai Jianyun's expression was filled with resentment as he screamed, \"Is that enough?\"The City Lord was furious and shouted, \"You injured the Xiang Family earlier, but now the Xiang Family has avenged you. One return and one return will be considered as cancellation of each other!\"As he spoke, Hong Zhen's fists burst forth with a powerful light. He actually condensed a terrifying Yuan Qi. He coldly said, \"Do you really think that I, Hong Zhen, lost the anger of a martial artist after becoming the City Lord?\"\"Today, whoever dares to continue causing trouble in my territory, I will make him pay a heavy price!\"Hong Zhen, back then, he was a fierce general who fought bravely on the battlefield and had made great contributions to the battle. Everyone basically knew how hot-tempered he was.Now that Hong Zhen's temper had risen, everyone was truly a bit afraid.At this moment, Xiang Nan held the huge saber in his hand, but didn't make a move. He was giving Hong Zhen face and repaying him for taking care of him.When Cai Jianyun and the others saw that Xiang Nan was not moving, it was difficult for them to make a move. In fact, they were afraid of Hong Zhen and did not dare to make a move.Hong Zhen looked around at the young contestants and shouted, \"All of you, get back to your seats!\"Xiang Nan laughed loudly and carried the giant saber behind him. \"Brothers and sisters, come to the table!\" He said.Cai Jianyun gritted his teeth and stared at Xiang Nan from afar. He said coldly, \"Wait for me! I will make you regret what you have done during the city selection.\"Xiang Nan turned his head and stared fixedly at Cai Jianyun's eyes. \"I'll wait for you,\" he said word by word.Hong Zhen clenched his fists in the sky. He thought to himself, Xiang Nan, this brat has made my blood boil.Huang Tianyu lay on the ground, breathing heavily, \"Cough \u2026 Cough \u2026 Me \u2026 Where's my saber \u2026 Where's my saber \u2026\"On Xiang Nan's shoulder stood a small bird, with a pair of crossed scimitars in its mouth.Liked it?

It was very curious about the human world.Xiang Nan was afraid that this little fellow would steal something again, so he whispered, \"Little Sparrow, you have some prospects! Don't steal things in this kind of situation, so that others won't underestimate us.\"The little sparrow seemed to not have heard it, and its little eyes rolled around randomly, looking at other people's jewelry.Xiang Nan sighed helplessly, \"If you listen obediently, I'll give you a few glittering gemstones when you get out.\"The little bird became a hundred times more energetic and immediately became much quieter.This guy could clearly understand Xiang Nan's words! If Xiang Nan hadn't bribed it, it would have pretended not to hear him.At this time, the chaotic battlefield had been quickly cleaned up by the staff, and the great figures of the sect who had come from afar were also chatting in low voices.Xiang Nan looked over and saw that the sect envoys seemed to be arguing about something, occasionally pointing at him.\"Xiang Nan, I didn't expect that your progress would be so fast after not seeing you for a few days!\" Xiang Zhonghua finally couldn't help but grab Xiang Nan's arm excitedly and said, \"Even Huang Tianyu was subdued by you!\"\"Yes.\" Xiang Fei's eyes curved with laughter as she proudly said, \"Doesn't our little Nan mean that little Nan is the number one expert?\"The Xiang Clan youths were much happier. With Xiang Nan supporting them, would anyone dare to cause trouble for the Xiang Clan in the future?However, Xiang Nan shook his head and smiled, \"Just now, I was scheming without thinking. I took advantage of their carelessness to capture Huang Tianyu. Don't think that Mo Hai and the others are really so unbearable.\"\"Mo Hai, Cai Jianyun and the others are all unfathomable. I believe they must have some trump cards. Don't be careless.\"At this time, Hong Zhen, who was far away, finally spoke as the City Lord.Hong Zhen nodded politely to the messengers of the six sects before letting go of his throat. He said loudly, \"The Martial Arts City Selection will be held in two days. Before that, I will briefly introduce the principles of the City Selection.\"At this point, everyone quieted down and listened attentively to Hong Zhen's reading.Hong Zhen said, \"First and foremost, there is no restriction on killing people in the Martial Arts City Election. In other words, killing an opponent in the process of the City Election is not against the rules.\"\"I don't want everyone to stop, but I hope that all the contestants can chant a bit of homesickness. If your opponent has no way to resist, I hope that you can forgive him.\"Xiang Nan nodded silently. Indeed, the Martial City Election was related to the future of the young people. No one would show mercy at that moment! Most of the time, if you don't kill others, others will kill you.Hong Zhen added, \"The second important issue is that the Martial Arts City Election has abandoned the arena competition mode. Instead, it will host a survival mode. That is to say, at that time, all the contestants will participate in the election together.\"\"For the sake of confidentiality, we cannot disclose the exact location. I hope that all the young contestants will be mentally prepared in advance.\"\"Chaos?\" Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei's expressions changed drastically.That Xiang Zhonghua angrily said, \"This is simply targeting our Xiang Clan!\"\"That's right, that's not fair!\" Xiang Fei frowned and said, \"Everyone knows that little Nan has many enemies. If we adopt the chaotic mode, wouldn't little Nan become the target of public criticism?\"Xiang Nan himself did not expect to face a chaotic battle mode. Right now, Mo Hai and Cai Jianyun's team hated him to the bone. It seemed that the city selection this time was much more difficult than he had imagined.Xiang Nan subconsciously glanced at Mo Hai's table and discovered that Li Qingchuan and the others were looking at him with a cold smile.On the other side, Cai Jianyun made a beheading gesture towards Xiang Nan.Once the scuffle mode was announced, the scene immediately exploded. There were too many people who wanted to kill Xiang Nan with their hands and fists rubbed together.On the other side, another discussion was going on with the sect messenger.At the Cavalry Sect, a female messenger said to the man beside her, \"Senior Brother, this Xiang Nan is very good. I'm going to recruit him into our Cavalry Sect. What do you think?\"The person called Senior Brother shook his head slightly, \"Although this Xiang Nan is outstanding, he is too impulsive and reckless. He is not tactful enough. This kind of person can easily cause trouble for our Cavalry Sect.\"The woman retorted, \"That's what I've taken a fancy to. Senior Brother, it's been many years since we've seen such a courageous young martial artist.\"\"Furthermore, are there not enough martial artists in this world who have smooth accidents? Aren't we martial artists supposed to be happy with our grudges and kill everyone?\"Hearing this, the senior apprentice-brother fell into deep thought.The Absolute Saber Sect on the other side had also set their sights on Xiang Nan, but what they were thinking was different from the Cavalry Sect.Within the Absolute Blade Sect, a middle-aged man with a beautiful beard suddenly stood up. He shouted to Xiang Nan, \"Xiang Nan, stand up!\"His loud shout attracted the attention of everyone present, and everyone looked over curiously.Xiang Nan stood up and cupped his fists at the middle-aged man from the Absolute Saber Sect. \"Junior Xiang Nan is here.\"\"Yes.\" The middle-aged man stroked his beard and smiled, \"I am the third generation elder of the Absolute Saber Sect, Yue Bufan, I have something to tell you.\"As he spoke, Yue Bufan took out a small brocade box from his bosom and opened it in front of everyone. Inside was a scarlet medicinal pill.What was shocking was that the pill was actually enveloped in a layer of faint fluorescence!Yue Bufan smiled arrogantly and said, \"Do you know what this is? This is the Essence Transformation Pill that countless martial artists have dreamed of!\"Whoosh!Everyone was shocked!The Origin Transformation Pill was a Tier 3 medicinal pill. As the name implied, the effect of this pill was to allow Xiantian realm ninth layer martial artists to directly convert Xiantian into Yuan Qi.For a moment, countless pairs of eyes focused their greedy gazes on the Essence Transformation Pill, unable to move away no matter what.Even Mo Hai and Cai Jianyun's faces turned red as they stared fixedly at the Essence Transformation Pill, their eyes filled with desire.Xiang Feiqi said, \"Xiang Nan, is this Essence Transformation Pill so powerful? Why do so many people behave abnormally after hearing these three words?\"Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes and nodded silently. He whispered, \"The Essence Transformation Pill is not an ordinary Tier 3 pill. The key point is that there are dozens of spirit herbs and various ingredients needed to refine the Essence Transformation Pill.\"\"As for these spirit herbs and ingredients, none of them can be found in our Bluestone City.\"Yue Bufan was very satisfied with everyone's reaction. He held onto the Essence Transformation Pill and said to Xiang Nan, \"What kind of martial skill did you use to charge just now?\"\"I'm willing to use this priceless Origin Transformation Pill in exchange for your charging martial skill. How about it?\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Especially Mo Hai.Mo Hai was a half-step Origin Realm expert, and what he longed for the most was an Origin Transformation Pill! If he obtained this pill, he would be able to advance to the Origin Realm within one night.What does the word Origin Returning Realm mean? This meant that he would be an invincible existence in the selection of Martial Arts City!Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and said resolutely, \"Thank you Elder Yue for your kindness. This junior dares not accept it.\"If Yue Bufan 's Essence Transformation Pill was enough to shock everyone, then Xiang Nan's words were simply unbelievable.Who would refuse the Essence Transformation Pill?Actually, Xiang Nan was also in a difficult situation. He had traveled all over Blue Stone City, and he couldn't even find any ingredients to refine the Essence Transformation Pill. He was also eager for the Essence Transformation Pill.However, the most important thing was that Yue Bufan wanted the Azure Dragon in the Thunder Running Saber to go out to sea! Other than Xiang Nan himself, no one else could cultivate such a martial skill.If he handed over the Azure Dragon Sea-going Art, his Lightning Meridian Attributes would be exposed as well.What was Huai Bi's sin? Xiang Nan was currently experiencing.Yue Bufan was stunned. He frowned and said, \"You have thought it through! The ninth level of the Xiantian realm to the first level of the Origin Reversion realm is the first heavenly chasm of a martial artist! It is the most important period when the first weather is converted into Yuan Qi.\"\"Even some genius martial artists need one to three years to refine their Qi and return to their Essence. Some even need three to five years.\"As he spoke, Yue Bufan said meaningfully, \"It's not like we haven't seen someone who has never been able to condense Yuan Qi in his entire life.\"\"I'm also willing to use a Soul Transformation Pill, plus the qualifications of the Cavalry Sect, in exchange for your martial skills!\" The woman from the cavalry gate also stood up.\"Junior Sister Yue, what do you mean? Are you trying to compete with our Juedao Sect?\" Yue Bufan turned his head and said angrily.The woman from the Cavalry Sect smiled and said, \"Senior Brother Bu Fan, we came here to compete for the genius youth. Did I do something wrong?\"The audience was dumbfounded.What's going on? The character was completely reversed?Shouldn't the contestants squeeze their brains and join the sect, and then go learn the sect's more powerful martial arts techniques?Why were the two sects competing for Xiang Nan's martial skills at this time? Who the hell was picking who?Someone in the spectator stands cried out in shock, \"This \u2026 is Xiang Nan's martial skill really that powerful?\"Someone whispered, \"We amateurs can't see the way out, but I think it should be extremely powerful. Otherwise, we wouldn't have let the elders of the two sects fight for it.\"The man's face turned pale when he heard this, \"The Xiang Clan has such a powerful martial skill? That old fellow Xiang Zhanxiong has hidden it deep enough.\"At this moment, Xiang Nan was already a little unable to ride a tiger. He secretly sighed in his heart, he shouldn't have used the Azure Dragon to go out to sea so early.A single move from the Azure Dragon had even caused them to start fighting. If they used the Lightning King Seal, what would happen to those elders?\"Xiang Nan, do you want to change it or not? Give me a hearty word.\" Elder Yue Bufan of the Absolute Saber Sect gave an ultimatum.The Cavalry Sect's Elder Yue said softly, \"Xiang Nan, there's no need to be afraid. If you trade with me, my Cavalry Sect will definitely protect you and protect your Xiang Clan.\"Because of the Azure Dragon's attack, the two sects became tense.Cai Jianyun is already gloating in his heart. Let's see what you, Xiang Nan, do! If two sects want your martial skills at the same time, whoever you trade with will offend the other side!The City Lord was extremely worried about Xiang Nan. He thought to himself that Xiang Nan was still young, so he really didn't have the experience to deal with this kind of situation. He hoped that he wouldn't say anything wrong.All the martial artists who harbored hatred for Xiang Nan were waiting for Xiang Nan to take action, while the insignificant others were secretly observing Xiang Nan's ability to conduct himself in the world.Was this brat just a reckless martial artist, or was he an outstanding talent who was strong enough and had a decent brain?Finally, under everyone's gaze, Xiang Nan took a deep breath and smiled instead.He cupped his fists and said to Jue Dao Sect and Iron Cavalry Sect, \"Thank you very much, Senior. Xiang Nan is very grateful. However, if Xiang Nan hurts the sect harmony of the two seniors because of an insignificant kid like Xiang Nan, he won't be able to offend them.\"\"Then what do you mean?\" Yue Bufan 's tone was unpleasant.Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Actually, the two seniors don't have to fight right now. If I, Xiang Nan, really pass the city selection by luck, then no matter which sect I join, won't I bring my martial skills into that sect?\"\"Mm\" Yue Bufan 's expression eased a lot. He nodded and said, \"You're right to say that.\"Actually, Yue Bufan knew this. He was afraid that Xiang Nan would make too many enemies and die in the Martial Arts City Selection, so he wouldn't be able to obtain Xiang Nan's martial skill. He planned to exchange it with the Essence Transformation Pill in advance.However, Xiang Nan's words could be considered as giving Yue Bufan a step down and taking care of the face of the two sects, so Yue Bufan had nothing to say.Elder Yue of the Cavalry Sect sat down with a smile and said to his senior brother, \"Look, isn't this Xiang Nan a brainless person?\"The senior brother helplessly smiled, \"Alright, alright. I know that junior sister has a sharp eye and is very accurate in judging people. Senior brother is willing to kowtow to you.\"After the banquet ended, all the contestants who were preparing to participate in the Martial Arts City Selection were left behind, and all those who had nothing to do with the city selection left the arena.City Lord Hong Zhen said, \"I left you here because the city selection will begin in two days. The venue for the city selection has already been selected. Then all the contestants participating in the city selection, come back with me to the City Lord's Mansion.\"\"Tomorrow morning, we will all head to the city selection trial grounds. Before that, no one is allowed to leave without permission. We cannot reveal the location of the trial grounds.\"\"So serious?\" Xiang Nan's heart trembled slightly. It seemed that the venue for the city selection this time was not a small matter.The next morning, all the disciples who participated in the city selection boarded the \"flying ship\" and sailed out of the Bluestone City area.A flying ship was a large ship that relied on the power of spirit stones to fly in the air. This type of flying ship had a very high capacity for carrying people and objects. Normally, only large clans had it, and it was used for freight transportation.As for the flying ship that Xiang Nan and the others were on, it belonged to the military and belonged to City Lord Hong Zhen.This was their first time riding a high-end flying ship. For a time, the cabins and decks were filled with curious contestants.Inside a secret cabin of the flying ship, the messengers of the six sects were all present.Absolute Saber Sect, Cavalry Sect, White Sword Sect, Berserk Lion Sect, Fierce Tiger Sect, and Chihuo Sect.Wang Xiaoyun and his three junior brothers were naturally leading the group of messengers from the Chihuo Sect .Wang Xiaoyun looked around at the messengers of the five sects and said in a deep voice, \"I summoned everyone here because I have something to tell them in advance.\"\"Oh? Nephew Wang, but there's no harm in saying it.\" Yue Bufan 's attitude was very respectful. These Third Grade sects would never dare to offend Second Grade sects.Wang Xiaoyun smiled coldly and said, \"Then I'll be embarrassed. In this city selection, I want to deal with Xiang Nan.

If you wanted to deal with a person, then deal with it secretly. Few people would put such words on the surface.However, since it was displayed, it meant that Wang Xiaoyun hoped that everyone would cooperate.The messengers of the five sects looked at each other, but no one dared to refute.Elder Yue Bufan of the Absolute Saber Sect couldn't help but be curious. He forcefully asked, \"I wonder how Nephew Wang intends to deal with Xiang Nan. Could it be that you want to personally take action?\"Wang Xiaoyun played with the ring on his thumb and said indifferently, \"The sect has its own rules. I, Chihuo Sect, pay more attention to the rules. Naturally, I will not violate the rules to deal with the contestants.\"\"Everyone, rest assured. I can guarantee that I will not force anyone to do anything that violates the rules of your own sect.\"Hearing this, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. Although they were afraid of Chihuo Sect, they were still unwilling to act recklessly under the pressure of Chihuo Sect.Wang Xiaoyun said, \"So my request is like this. Come and listen.\"Everyone conspired together and listened to Wang Xiaoyun's secret plan. Of course, other than Wang Xiaoyun's Chihuo Sect, the other sect messengers felt more regret in their hearts.Without a doubt, it was only natural for people to love him. Everyone had taken a fancy to Xiang Nan.It was strange that Xiang Nan had offended the wrong person. He should never have offended the Chihuo Sect .Xiang Nan, who didn't know anything about it, was still hiding in his room and cultivating for the last time.He had first combed through all the martial skills and techniques he had learned during this period of time, and it was very important to determine what kind of martial skills to use under what circumstances.The second was to examine his own martial dao realm.\"This advancement is a bit too strange.\" Xiang Nan checked his sixth level Xiantian realm, but he didn't know what was going on in his heart.Not to mention that he had eaten so many pills, even if he hadn't eaten any pills, just learning any of the powerful martial skills of the Thunder King Seal or the Rushing Thunder Saber was enough for him to break through to the seventh level of the Xiantian realm.However, in reality, the pills, together with the two abnormal martial skills, were still unable to break through to the seventh level.He felt the power in his body, which was about to erupt, but at this moment, it was like a sleeping tiger. He muttered to himself, \"Looks like if I can successfully advance this time, it should be a big stride.\"Then, he continued to practice the Thunder King Seal's seal gesture, thinking in his heart, \"If I can enter a sect this time, I should be able to find some ways to increase my resistance to electricity.\"Xiang Nan didn't care much about the martial skills of these sects. The reason he wanted to enter the sect was because he wanted the books of those sects.Each sect had its own collection of books. These books weren't just cultivation techniques and martial skills, but also alchemy, artifact forging, and even some precious historical documents.Xiang Nan recalled that of the six sects, Chihuo Sect had the oldest history and should have the largest collection of books. However, it was clear that Wang Xiaoyun could not allow him to enter Chihuo Sect.The remaining five sects belonged to the Cavalry Sect. They had the longest history of about 600 years. These sects had a large collection of books, and the chances of finding a way to increase his resistance to electricity were also the highest.\"It's the Cavalry Gate.\" Xiang Nan made up his mind, especially since Elder Yue of the Cavalry Sect had a good attitude towards him. Joining the Cavalry Sect was the best choice.The days passed so quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was already the day of the official city selection.In the early morning of this day, the military airship finally slowed down and began to descend from above the clouds.The flying ship crossed the boundless sea of clouds and saw everything below.All the contestants had been waiting on the deck for a long time, wanting to see where the training grounds were.\"Ah?\" Beside him, Xiang Zhonghua was suddenly shocked. He pointed downwards and shouted, \"Isn't that \u2026 isn't that the Black Sharp Demonic Forest?\"All the contestants also cried out in alarm.Down from here, within a radius of several hundred kilometers, it was all within the Black Sharp Demonic Forest's range!\"My god.\" Xiang Fei covered her mouth in fear, and her voice floated out from between her fingers, \"We're going to conduct the city selection in the Black Sharp Demon Forest? That's a fierce place. The demonic beasts inside are rampant.\"That's right, the Black Sharp Demonic Forest Demonic Beast is rampant, and these Xiantian realm martial artists are here for the city selection? It was simply a joke. Even if he wanted to survive inside, it would be very difficult.Xiang Nan furrowed his brows. He had been here twice and understood the danger the most.Even if an Origin Returning Realm martial artist entered, there was a high chance that this Black Sharp Demon Forest would die inside.\"This time \u2026 isn't it a little too big?\" Not far away, Li Qingchuan's face was also pale.The flying ship landed at the edge of the Black Sharp Demon Forest, but it did not land. Instead, it landed a hundred meters above the ground in mid-air.Looking down from here, he discovered that the people from the various clans were waiting outside the Black Sharp Demon Forest.\"Are they here to watch the battle?\" \"The elders of each clan arrived before us? Then what is the meaning of our so-called secret plan?\" Xiang Nanqi asked.At this time, City Lord Hong Zhen and the messengers of several sects had already walked out.Hong Zhen said, \"That's right, the location of the selection this time is the Black Sharp Demon Forest. Actually, the elders of each clan can also watch the battle, and they just arrived at dawn today.\"\"I see.\" Xiang Nan suddenly came to a realization and said, \"We've been wandering in the sky for two days now.\"\"The reason why you didn't reveal that Black Sharp Yao Sen is the election venue in advance is because you're worried that the powerful elders of the clan will make a move in Yao Sen and help their clan's younger generation cheat.\"Hong Zhen nodded, \"Exactly.\"Xiang Nan frowned and said, \"But even so, fairness is preserved. What about security? I'm afraid it's inappropriate for us Xiantian martial artists to choose in Black Sharp Demon Forest City.\"At this time, Elder Yue of the Cavalry Sect smiled and said, \"The demonic beasts within the Demonic Forest are rampant. There are many of them at the Origin Realm or even the Heavenly Origin Realm. Naturally, it is impossible for us to let you go in and die.\"\"Next, it's time to watch a good show.\"As he spoke, the messengers of the six sects exchanged glances with each other, and each sect took out something.The Cavalry Sect had a huge halberd, the Absolute Saber Sect had a half-broken blade, the Berserk Lion Sect had a lion's eye the size of a fist, the Violent Tiger Sect had a long whip made from a tiger's tail, and the White Sword Sect had a sparkling sword.As soon as these five items were taken out, all the contestants present felt their breathing become difficult due to the powerful pressure of those five items, as if even Chen Yang had lost his luster at this moment.City Lord Hong Zhen introduced, \"The five sects took out five low-grade profound weapons!\"The moment the word \"low-grade profound weapon\" was spoken, all the contestants were so shocked that they stopped breathing.Weapons are divided into grades: Mortal Weapons, Spirit Weapons, Earth Weapons, Heavenly Weapons, Profound Weapons, Dao Weapons, and Divine Weapons.According to legend, only City Lord Hong Zhen had an Earth Weapon in the entire area covered by Blue Stone City. This was already an extremely formidable weapon.And today, five low-grade profound weapons appeared together! These were simply the most spectacular weapons in the history of Bluestone City.Only the sect would be able to control a weapon with infinite power like the Profound Armament.In fact, Xiang Nan, who possessed extremely strong perception, had a premonition that the moment the five profound weapons appeared, the entire Black Sharp Demon Forest became silent.All of the powerful demonic beasts hibernating in the Demon Forest were completely silent.Liked it?

It was a small exquisite pagoda.As soon as this tower appeared, the weapons of the other five sects were instantly suppressed to the point of dimming.Many youths cried out in alarm.\"The weapons of the five sects are all elementary-level profound weapons. The weapons of the Chihuo Sect can still suppress them by one head. They must be intermediate-level profound weapons!\"\"That's right.\" Wang Xiaoyun smiled faintly and said, \"This is one of the most precious treasures of our Chihuo Sect. The Fire Cloud Pagoda is an Intermediate Profound Weapon.\"The eyes of all the young people shone with envy.\"The Chihuo Sect is indeed powerful. It can casually take out an Intermediate Profound Weapon.\"\"That's right. If I am lucky enough to enter Chihuo Sect, wouldn't my future be limitless?\"\"Hey, stop dreaming. The Chihuo Sect is a second-class sect. How can we enter as soon as we say?\"The young contestants exchanged words with each other, and their words were filled with incomparable desire for Chihuo Sect.The messengers of the Chihuo Sect listened very well, their faces carrying arrogant expressions.City Lord Hong Zhen also smiled and said, \"Yes, it is also a great honor for our Bluestone City to have Chihuo Sect come to a small place like ours to choose disciples. Everyone must work hard and seize this opportunity.\"Immediately, the contestants expressed their stance and swore that they would use all their strength to win the favor of the envoys of the various sects.\"Alright.\" Hong Zhen clapped his hands and said, \"Enough gossip. Let's start introducing the rules of the competition. Flying ship, Sheng!\"The flying ship rose high again. At the same time, the messengers of the six sects exchanged glances with each other and threw their sect's divine weapons into the sky.The six Mysterious Grade weapons flew into the sky at the same time, releasing tens of thousands of golden rays of light, causing the hazy dawn to instantly become as bright as noon.The contestants cried out in surprise again.Immediately after, the six profound weapons floated in the air. The golden light they scattered directly fell into the Black Sharp Demon Forest. It was actually inside the Black Sharp Demon Forest that they drew winding long lines with light.After landing on the ground, numerous long lines rose high, forming a wall of light that was a hundred meters tall!Looking down from the flying ship, the light walls were instantly as complicated as a maze.\"This seems to be \u2026 a lot of roads.\" Xiang Nan pondered.\"That's right.\" Hong Zhen nodded and said in a loud voice, \"Throughout the ages, many martial artists have used their blood and lives to explore the Black Sharp Demonic Forest, and they have even stepped out one safe path after another.\"\"These safe paths are divided into four levels. They are the Xiantian Road, the Origin Return Road, the Post Origin Road, and the Heaven Origin Road.\"\"Today, the six great sects used divine weapons to cut the Xiantian Road into three hundred equal parts. Therefore, that Xiantian Road is your first examination place.\"Everyone had heard of the four levels of paths. As the name implied, the paths of the Xiantian realm were basically Xiantian demonic beasts, ranging from the first level of the Xiantian realm to the ninth level of the Xiantian realm.Inside the Origin Return Road were demonic beasts from the 1st to 5th level of Origin Return, and from the 6th to 9th level of Origin Return. Inside the Origin Heaven Road were the habitats of terrifying demonic beasts in the Origin Heaven Realm, which was also the core area of the Black Sharp Demonic Forest.Hong Zhen pointed at the three hundred paths below and said, \"You have a total of three hundred contestants. Each of you will be thrown into a path.\"\"And all you have to do is cross your own Innate Road as fast as you can and arrive at the second examination hall.\"\"Points system will be adopted in this city selection. Those who arrive at the second examination hall within ten hours will be rewarded with ten points. Those who arrive at the second examination hall after ten hours will be rewarded with one point less for every additional hour. The highest point will be ten points, and the lowest point will be one point.\"\"Forward.\"The flying ship began to move towards the interior of the Black Sharp Demon Forest. Many contestants crowded around and looked down. Seeing the terrifying Black Sharp Demon Forest being cut into such a shape, their eyes were filled with shock.Immediately after, they flew over the area being cut and arrived at the top of a huge open space.Strangely, there were actually three hundred light cages in the open space, and each cage contained a demonic beast.Hong Zhen said, \"This is the second exam hall. What you have to do is to pass through the second exam hall and enter the last third exam hall.\"\"However, everyone has seen the Yuan Qi cages. Each cage contains a Xiantian fifth level demonic beast. From the beginning of the city selection, the first cage will be unlocked by the tenth hour.\"\"After that, every five minutes, a cage will be unlocked and a demonic beast will regain its freedom.\"\"In other words, whoever arrives at the second examination hall at the fastest speed will face the least pressure.\"Xiang Nan nodded silently. If he could arrive at the second exam hall within ten hours, then even one demonic beast would not be unlocked. It would be as easy as crossing the second exam hall.However, the longer he spent in the first examination room, the more demonic beasts he would face!Every hour, he had to unlock a total of twelve demonic beasts. This was no joke! Even though they were all Xiantian 5-dan demonic beasts, once their numbers increased, they would become incomparably dangerous.\"The last third examination room, move forward!\"The flying ship finally arrived at the other end of the Black Sharp Demon Forest. This place was far away from the core area, and there were almost no demonic beasts left.Hong Zhen said, \"This is the third exam hall. At that time, each of you will be given a famous brand. The third exam hall will be the place for you to compete for the famous brand.\"Hong Zhen introduced that a soldier had already given each contestant a famous brand. This brand was round and could be directly absorbed into clothes by the weather.On the name plate that Xiang Nan had obtained, there were two words written on it: \"Xiang Nan.\"Hong Zhen said, \"The third examination room will only be open for 24 hours. Those who do not arrive within the specified time will be eliminated.\"\"And in the third examination hall, you can compete for each other's famous brands. You can get one extra point for each brand you snatch.\"\"After the 24-hour closure of all the exam halls, the contestants with the highest scores will be given priority to be accepted by the sect.\"\"Alright, let's go back to the end of the first examination hall and begin to let the contestants in.\"The flying ship flew back to the starting point and asked the contestants to draw a number plate. The number plate Xiang Nan drew was 300, which meant that he would be placed in the 300th Xiantian Passage.Soon after, the flying ship flew sideways from left to right. The students' bodies were wrapped with Yuan Qi and placed into their own passages.During this period, Xiang Nan quickly asked Xiang Zhonghua and the others, \"How is your cultivation?\"Xiang Zhonghua smiled confidently, \"Don't worry, I was originally at the fourth level of Xiantian and was close to the fifth level. With little Nan 's help, I am now at the sixth level of Xiantian.\"Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei were both Xiantian sixth layer experts, while the other members of the Xiang Clan were Xiantian fourth layer to fifth layer experts.Xiang Nan nodded. \"Then I'm relieved.\"\"Alright, my passageway is here. Xiang Nan, I'll see you at the third examination hall.\" Xiang Zhonghua raised the number plate with the words \"137\" in his hand, and then he was thrown down, easily falling into the Black Sharp Demon Forest.Xiang Nan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Although Zhong Hua and Xiang Fei were only at the sixth level of Xiantian realm, this realm was more than enough to deal with 16-year-old contestants.After all, Wang Jinghai was only at the sixth level of the Xiantian realm.The last one was Xiang Nan. He held a 300-number token and was landed on the 300th passageway.The city lord shouted loudly, \"In order to avoid being disturbed during the city election, the venue is closed!\"As soon as he finished speaking, the six profound weapons suddenly emitted intense light. The front lights condensed into a hemisphere that actually covered the entire examination area with a boom!Within twenty-four hours, no one could enter the examination room, and no one could come out.Liked it?

Let's go to the sky and watch.\"The members of the various clans who came to cheer for their juniors, as well as some important figures who came to observe, all boarded the flying ship.The flying ship gradually rose above the giant hemispheric barrier of light.This screen, which covered nearly one-third of the Black Sharp Demon Forest's area, also had the function of projecting images. It enlarged the situation of each of the contestants below to the surface of the screen.Everyone looked down and could clearly see the situation of each contestant from the surface of the light screen.\"Now I declare that the Blue Stone City Martial Arts City Selection will officially begin!\"Along with City Lord Hong Zhen's command, the martial arts city selection that everyone was looking forward to finally began.The three hundred contestants below were lined up horizontally. After hearing the order to start, they all set off for the second examination hall.Mo Hai, who was called the number one expert of his age, looked out of the light wall on the right and nodded slightly.The person standing outside the light wall on the right was precisely the second expert, Cai Jianyun.Cai Jianyun clasped his fists and smiled faintly, \"Brother Mo Hai, please step aside!\"\"Chengjian!\" Mo Hai clasped his fists in return.At this moment, almost everyone's gaze fell on the two of them. They knew that the two of them were the strongest, so they were filled with anticipation towards the two of them.\"Brother Mo Hai, I'm leaving first,\" Cai Jianyun smiled.As soon as he finished speaking, Cai Jianyun's feet condensed into a cloud of white mist. Then, with a sound from Peng, the first cloud of white mist exploded. As for Cai Jianyun, he stepped on the white mist and his body turned into a shadow as he rushed forward.\"Good skill!\" Mo Hai broke down.That Cai Jianyun's movement technique was very peculiar. At first glance, it looked like he was stepping on an auspicious cloud, and the visual effect was astonishing.On the flying ship, everyone praised Cai Jianyun endlessly, while Cai Baohua, who was in charge of the Cai Clan, had an arrogant expression on his face.Mo Hai smiled. His body was slightly bent and his feet shot onto the ground. His entire body rushed out with a whoosh, and his sprint actually brought with it a faint howl of a tiger!The spectators on the flying ship were in an uproar again. The Mo Clan in Bluestone Town and the Clan Master Mo Hongqi were also extremely proud.\"Alright, alright. These two people are truly outstanding among the younger generation of our Blue Stone City.\"\"Yes, Old Master Cai, Patriarch Mo is so lucky.\"Hearing everyone's praise, the leaders of the two clans returned the greetings, but the arrogance on their faces could not be concealed.On the other side, Wang Jingyun and Wang Jinghai were next to each other, and there was only a wall of light between them.\"Sister, come on! We must get good grades this year.\" Wang Jinghai chuckled at Wang Jingyun. His feet moved slightly, but his body rushed out at a very fast speed.\"En, Xiaohai, be careful. Sister will be watching you at any time.\" Wang Jingyun's eyes were full of doting. She took out a red silk and shot it out.A red silk was like a rainbow that pierced through the sun, seemingly continuously shooting into the distance. However, Wang Jingyun was stepping on the red silk, her entire body sliding forward. This move was very elegant.\"Oh?\" Mo Hongqi congratulated Wang Changhe, \"Little Hai was still at the Xiantian 4th layer during the election. In just a short month, he actually advanced to the Xiantian 7th layer!\"Wang Changhe smiled calmly. Facing the two geniuses of the Mo Clan and the Cai Clan, Wang Changhe wasn't worried at all. There was a mysterious confidence in his eyes.Everyone was extremely envious of Wang Changhe! Needless to say, Wang Jinghai must be able to make such a terrifying leap in strength thanks to Wang Xiaoyun!Wang Xiaoyun casually gave a few Chihuo Sect pills to Wang Jinghai. This was enough for Wang Jinghai to benefit endlessly.Afterwards, everyone set their sights on Xiang Nan, who was the most worthy of attention among the newcomers.However, everyone couldn't help but frown when they saw him.This had already begun for almost a minute. Three hundred contestants had all set off, leaving only Xiang Nan standing there motionlessly!\"Hmm? What's going on?\" The City Lord was puzzled. He turned around and was about to ask the Xiang Clan about it, but he discovered that none of the Xiang Clan's elders were there.This was also what Xiang Nan meant. The most important reason was that there was no one in charge of the Xiang Clan! Old Master Xiang Zhanxiong was still in seclusion, and the various clans here, Wang, Mo, Li, and Cai, all harbored great hostility towards the Xiang Clan.In this city election, Xiang Nan had to fight against the people from the four families. If the elders of the four families were to become angry and vent their anger on the elders of the Xiang Family, then the gains would not be worth the losses.In order to prevent Xiang Nan from being distracted, the Xiang family was very considerate and did not come to watch the battle.\"What is this kid doing?\" Hong Zhen was starting to get anxious. This first battlefield could be said to be a race against time!The others on the flying ship were similarly puzzled. Only Wang Xiaoyun smiled coldly. However, the smile disappeared in a flash and was well hidden.Below, Black Sharp Demonic Forest.Xiang Nan frowned as he stood in his 300th passageway. A silver light flashed in his eyes, and he could clearly see the situation of the Demonic Qi Division with his Lightning Meridian attribute.\"Something's wrong.\" Xiang Nan's brows furrowed even deeper as he muttered, \"Could it be that I saw wrongly? Little Sparrow, go check it out.\"As soon as he finished speaking, the bird on Xiang Nan's shoulder immediately let out a cry and the painting flew out with a gust of wind.After circling a few times in the distance, the bird returned to Xiang Nan's shoulders.Xiang Nan whispered in the little bird's ear. Seeing that the little bird nodded, the anger on Xiang Nan's face couldn't be suppressed!When everyone saw this scene, their faces were filled with doubt.Xiang Nan cupped his fists at the flying ship in the sky and shouted, \"City Lord, elders of the various sects! I want to ask why there are Origin Returning Realm demonic beasts in this 300th passageway!\"A single word shocked a thousand waves! On the flying ship, everyone was dumbfounded.\"Gui Yuan?\" Hong Zhen was the first to jump into a rage and roar, \"Elders, what's going on?\"\"The first battlefield of all the contestants should be the Xiantian passageway. Why are there Origin Realm demonic beasts in the passageway of Xiang Nan? How can this be explained?\"Forget about Hong Zhen, the messengers of the other five sects also looked at each other. The cavalry elder asked curiously, \"How is this possible? We've planned the route beforehand, so we shouldn't have made any mistakes.\"\"In particular, Xiang Nan is located closest to the Origin Realm. That is the territory under the jurisdiction of the Chihuo Sect. How could the dignified Chihuo Sect make a mistake \u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, Elder Yue suddenly woke up like a dream! She looked at Wang Xiaoyun with a questioning expression in her beautiful eyes!Everyone understood! It was just that everyone was tacit and didn't dare to say it out loud.That's right. The most dangerous area is to be suppressed by the Fire Cloud Tower in Chihuo Sect. This is the safest place, but everyone has overlooked one thing. The person Wang Xiaoyun hates the most is Xiang Nan!Wang Xiaoyun definitely did it on purpose!\"Oh?\" Wang Xiaoyun faintly smiled and swept his gaze down a few times before saying, \"Looks like there's really been a mistake, but there's nothing I can do about it. The demonic beast's area of activity isn't fixed in the first place.\"\"This 300th passageway, um \u2026 seems to have been delimited into the Origin Returning Area.\"Xiang Nan laughed coldly.Wang Xiaoyun said nonchalantly, \"Since the accident has already occurred, there is no way to remedy it. Xiang Nan, you don't have to go forward. You just have to wait until the end of this city election.\"\"You're only sixteen, right? You're young, and you can still participate in the next city selection.\"Hong Zhen was so angry that his lungs were about to explode! But what could he do? He couldn't punch Wang Xiaoyun in the face, could he?Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let's see if we can find a more reliable solution.\" City Lord Hong Zhen refused to give up and immediately went to find the messengers of the six great sects for a meeting.Of course, Hong Zhen was unwilling to give up. Before this, his attitude had always been to protect Xiang Nan, and he had always stood on the same side as Xiang Nan.It was precisely because he valued Xiang Nan's potential! He had to protect Xiang Nan even if he wanted to offend the other clans. It could also be seen as placing his biggest bet on Xiang Nan alone.\"Envoys.\" Hong Zhen looked at the elders of the major sects seriously and said in a serious tone, \"Is there really no room for recovery? Can we open the light screen and let the contestants enter again?\"\"It's impossible.\" Wang Xiaoyun was the first to shake his head and refuse. He said, \"The six profound weapons of our six sects have already poured all their spiritual energy into it. If we remove the protective barrier now, the six profound weapons will also be in a state of spiritual energy deficit.\"Elder Menyue said thoughtfully, \"Nephew Wang is right. If the protective barrier is removed this time, it will take at least three to five days for the barrier to condense again.\"Wang Xiaoyun said, \"We can't disrupt the whole plan for Xiang Nan alone.\"The City Lord thought for a moment and said, \"Even so, can we send an elder into the Demon Forest to bring Xiang Nan out? Then we can throw him into another path.\"\"I'm afraid that won't be possible.\" Wang Xiaoyun shook his head, \"During the existence of the protective barrier, no one can cross the barrier, including us sect elders.\"Hearing this, Hong Zhen was already somewhat desperate. He looked up at the heavens and felt endless sorrow in his heart.There was an old saying that Mu Xiu was destroyed by Lin Feng. Could it be that this was the fate that Xiang Nan had to endure?Bluestone Town, the Xiang manor.In the meeting hall, all the clansmen of the Xiang manor were present.At the top was the Xiang Clan's Grand Elder. At this moment, the Grand Elder looked around and finally his gaze landed on Xiang Shaohua. \"Is Zhan Xiong still in seclusion?\"Xiang Shaohua nodded, \"Father is in seclusion. He intends to break through to the Heaven Origin Realm. I'm afraid he won't come out until he breaks through.\"The Great Elder nodded and looked at the other elders and clan stewards, asking, \"Has all business been temporarily suspended?\"Third Elder replied on behalf of everyone, \"Big Brother, all business has been suspended, and the shops are temporarily closed.\"\"Yes.\" The Great Elder nodded, \"Gather all the members of the clan who have the ability to fight, and let them wait in formation!\"\"By now, the city selection should have begun. If little Nan, Zhong Hua, and the others fail to enter the sect, Wang, Li, Mo, and Cai Clans will definitely come and destroy our Xiang Clan.\"\"We need to prepare for the worst. This time, we will live and die with the Xiang Clan!\"The expressions of the Xiang Family clansmen were resolute as they raised their weapons and shouted in unison, \"Live or die with the Xiang Family!\"Dark clouds seemed to have enveloped this troubled clan. Survival or extinction was only a single battle.Black Sharp Demonic Forest.Hong Zhencheng exchanged his anger and grief for a long sigh. He said to Xiang Nan below, \"Xiang Nan, I've wronged you. It's because we didn't plan properly.\"\"You \u2026 Sigh, you should just stay where you are and wait for the city selection to end. There's no need to worry about burning firewood.\"All the spectators who watched the city selection contest had different expressions. Some sighed for Xiang Nan, while others gloated at his misfortune.Below, Xiang Nan looked up at the flying ship and said, \"I refuse.\"\"Huh?\" Everyone was stunned.Hong Zhen said, \"There's nothing we can do about it. We've already thought of all the possibilities. There's really no way we can change another channel for you.\"Xiang Nan smiled and shook his head, \"You understand wrongly. I mean, I refused to stay where I was and waited. Instead, I chose to continue forward.\"\"What?\" The flying ship exploded.That was the Origin Returning Realm passageway! All of them were Origin Returning Realm demonic beasts! Wasn't it suicidal for a Xiantian sixth layer martial artist in Xiang Nan to venture into the Origin Realm?\"Xiang Nan!\" The City Lord's eyes were red as he shouted, \"Now is not the time to act emotionally!\"Xiang Nan smiled and said, \"Thank you, City Lord, for your kindness, but I have made up my mind.\"At this point, Xiang Nan thought for a moment, then knelt down on one knee towards the flying ship and cupped his fists. \"Xiang Nan's fate is hard to predict. If this is the last time Xiang Nan has a conversation with the City Lord, there's something Xiang Nan wants to say in his heart.\"\"Thank you, City Lord, for taking care of Xiang Nan. If Xiang Nan dies, then Xiang Nan will repay the City Lord's kindness in the next life! I will never forget it.\"With that, Xiang Nan bit the hilt of the saber and tore off a long strip of cloth from his body, tightly wrapping his right hand around the hilt of the saber!This was a sign that he had burned the boat and sank the boat, and it also represented Xiang Nan's determination! He would rather die than let go of the saber in his hand!Hearing Xiang Nan's words, Hong Zhen's eyes couldn't help but turn red. He clenched his fists tightly and thought to himself, Xiang Nan, if you were born decades earlier, then the two of us would definitely be intimate brothers!Seeing Xiang Nan's decisive departure, the messengers of the sects were all moved.Elder Menyue nodded and sighed at Xiang Nan's back, \"This is a hero who attaches great importance to love and righteousness.\"Black Sharp Yao Sen, 300th Origin Returning Passage.Xiang Nan held the huge saber in his hand, and his figure moved like a rabbit, jumping around in the complicated forest.His eyes flickered with lightning, and he could clearly see the situation of the Demonic Qi Division. There was also the little bird circling in the sky, sending out a warning signal for Xiang Nan at any time.The initial point of the passageway was relatively narrow, and the deeper it went, the wider it became. It was like a narrow-mouthed bottle.By the time Xiang Nan advanced three to five miles, the surroundings were already exceptionally open. With his eyes, he could no longer see the light walls on both sides.Suddenly, a sharp cry came from the little bird circling in the sky.\"Coming!\"Xiang Nan, who was speeding forward, instantly stopped. He waved his long black-scaled saber horizontally in front of him, and his sharp eyes stared out through the edge of the saber.The dense bushes in front of him shook a few times, and a huge monster slowly walked out.\"My God! It's actually that thing!\" The flying ship cried out in alarm.The first Origin Returning Demonic Beast Xiang Nan encountered was his \"old opponent\", Feng Niu!Unfortunately, the wind bull that Xiang Nan encountered was the same one that he had encountered last time, Gui Yuan Yi Layer.Hong Zhen was shocked, \"Xiang Nan, although this demonic beast doesn't understand martial arts and techniques and has an Origin Returning Realm body, its realm is too different from yours. Don't fight it head-on, just go around it.\"Xiang Nan did not have such a plan. From the anger in Feng Niu's eyes, it was not difficult to tell that even if he wanted to take a detour, this Feng Niu would not let him go.When enemies met, their eyes were especially red. The wind bull's eyes were incomparably red, and the tiny blood vessels in its eyes were about to explode.\"Moo!\"Following the roar of the wind bull, its enormous body turned into a shadow and rushed towards Xiang Nan.Liked it?

Even amongst demonic beasts of the same realm, it could be considered a powerful beast in the middle and upper reaches of the river.Xiang Nan dodged the Wind Bull's first charge with dexterity.The two brushed past each other halfway and did not touch each other.Xiang Nan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. It seemed that his speed was really not the same as before. This time, it was useless to even use the Shadow Steps to dodge the first round of Wind Bull's charge.Immediately after, the furious Wind Bull turned around and a strong wind rose beneath its four hooves, and an even fiercer charge was about to arrive.On the flying ship, everyone held their breath. Their mood seemed to be even more nervous than Xiang Nan's.Xiang Nan quickly analyzed the situation of the wind bull in his mind. Although the attack method of the wind bull was very simple, its strength was boundless and its speed was extremely fast. It was still very troublesome.Seeing that the strong winds beneath the wind bull's hooves had already started to rage, Xiang Nan also made up his mind.To deal with this kind of thing, one had to face it head-on! Any tricks won't do it much good.\"Moo!\" The Wind Bull finally launched its second charge. Its body surged across the land, and the strong winds whistled beside it. It was like a living land war chariot!With the sound of the wind bull running wildly, Xiang Nan lowered his center of gravity and inserted the black scale into the ground. His left elbow pressed against the back of the knife.As soon as the ordinary Black Scaled Saber encountered the lightning attribute, it instantly soared to a high-grade spirit grade!\"Azure Dragon, go to sea!\"The weather inside Xiang Nan's body instantly exploded. A terrifying force urged Xiang Nan to rush out, turning his entire body into a ball of raging flames.\"This is the move!\" Yue Bufan gritted his teeth and said, \"This brat, if you had known how good it would be to exchange pills with me! If he died, this charging martial skill would have been lost.\"A Level 1 Origin Returning Wind Bull collided head-on with a late Xiantian Sixth Stage human martial artist!Peng!A heaven-shaking and earth-shattering sound of confrontation rang out. Rolling waves of air and flames spread out in a ring, uprooting all the ancient trees within a radius of twenty meters!Xiang Nan and the wind bull were furiously pressed together. The black-scaled blade pressed tightly against the wind bull's curved horns, while his eyes stared at the wind bull's red eyes.The two of them were stuck in a stalemate. The wind bull's hooves were constantly shaking the ground, causing the land to tremble.Xiang Nan stepped firmly on the ground, using the previous weather to strengthen the firmness of the ground. Even so, his pair of feet also sunk deep into the earth.The wind bull desperately increased its impact force, trying to knock Xiang Nan away, and Xiang Nan's energy storage had reached the final stage.Finally, the wind bull roared angrily and exploded with all its might.The Xiantian in Xiang Nan's body also instantly exploded. The last half move of the Azure Dragon, the Drawing Saber stance, reached the highest peak in history!With his giant black saber raised fiercely, a ten-meter-long giant crescent saber Qi soared into the sky!Boom!The huge wind bull was sent flying by Xiang Nan! The large crescent saber Qi fiercely sliced through the forehead of the wind bull, causing flames to erupt one after another.Xiang Nan himself was also knocked backwards by the impact of the wind bull. He stood upright and his feet drew two deep gullies on the ground.Looking at the wind bull in midair, it used its sturdy forehead and saber Qi to fight to the death, but that saber Qi was simply too ruthless! In the end, the wind bull's final defense was still pierced by the saber Qi.A gale bull was actually cut in half by the crescent moon saber light in midair!Rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble\"He actually \u2026 actually won!\" The flying ship cried out in alarm.\"Huh?\" In the distance, Cai Jianyun had just slaughtered a Xiantian sixth layer demonic fox. He looked up at the sky with a look of pride on his puzzled face.He thought that everyone was cheering for Cai Jianyun's wonderful performance, but in his heart, he said, these people are too ignorant. Killing a demonic fox is nothing. I have even more powerful methods.On the other side, Mo Hai had also just killed an eighth level Xiantian Steel-backed gorilla. The gorilla was lying on the ground, and its entire head had been blown apart by Mo Hai.Mo Hai frowned slightly and thought to himself, \"Aren't the spectators on the flying ship giving themselves too much face? I just killed a steel-backed gorilla. Do they need to cheer so loudly?\" It seemed that his reputation was too high, so he had to keep a low profile in the future.Further away, Li Qingchuan and Wang Jingyun smiled and said in unison, \"Looks like Mo Hai's performance was very good. It caused everyone to cry out in alarm so quickly.\"Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan came to the corpse of the wind bull and used the tip of his saber to pick out a transparent ball from the head of the wind bull. The surface of the Yuan Qi was still stained with blood.\"Oh? So lucky.\" Xiang Nan's heart skipped a beat and he used the weather to get the ball.This was a wind-type demon crystal, commonly known as a demon crystal stone. This item possessed good medicinal value. Its own sturdiness allowed it to be used for artifact refinement and pill refinement. Its value was slightly higher than spirit herbs of the same level.Moreover, Demon Crystal Stones were the same as rare ores. Not every demonic beast had one, so the probability of them appearing was very low.He weighed the Demon Crystal twice and nodded, \"Well, although it's only a Second Grade Demon Crystal, it hasn't reached Third Grade yet, but it's not bad.\"As he spoke, Xiang Nan smiled and casually tossed the Wind-type Demon Crystal into the sky, \"Little Sparrow, here you go.\"The little bird was also a wind-attributed demonic beast. It happily held the demonic crystal in its mouth and swallowed it with a raise of its neck.After swallowing the Wind Type Second Grade Demon Crystal, the little bird was in a good mood. It landed on Xiang Nan's shoulder and lightly touched Xiang Nan's face with its beak.\"Haha, follow me. The benefits are indispensable to you.\" Xiang Nan smiled, stepped on it, and rushed out again with a whoosh.But not long after, the little bird on Xiang Nan's shoulder suddenly let out a scream and rushed into the sky with a whoosh. It began to rapidly circle around an area.The screams in the little bird's mouth became more and more urgent.Xiang Nan couldn't help but frown deeply and said, \"When we met the wind bull just now, the little bird wasn't so abnormal. What happened?\"Right in front of them were still dense shrubs. As they stood in a forest with towering ancient trees, two faint green lights flickered from the depths of the shrubs.Xiang Nan's eyes met the pair of green lights.Rustling, the shrub shook, and a demonic wolf slowly walked out of the shrub.When the demonic wolf landed on the ground, its head was about the same height as Xiang Nan's, but its four limbs were strong, and it didn't make a sound when it walked.The demonic wolf did not immediately attack Xiang Nan. Instead, it slowly walked around and let out a muffled roar. Its eyes did not leave Xiang Nan's body for a moment.\"First level of Origin Return.\" Xiang Nan heaved a sigh of relief. \"It's just a demonic wolf. The threat isn't as great as the wind bull. Isn't the little bird making a big fuss?\"But just as he said this, the little bird in the sky became even more impatient.Xiang Nan was puzzled by the bird's performance, but in the next moment, he was suddenly shocked.\"Sh*t! Wolves are gregarious animals!\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Generally speaking, a pack of wolves consists of many demonic wolves and a wolf king.Of course, they would occasionally encounter Lonely Wolves, but most of the time, Lonely Wolves would only become lonely after the previous generation of Wolf Kings had been expelled by the new Wolf Kings.Evidently, the demonic wolf in front of Xiang Nan was strong and strong. It was definitely not the Old Wolf King.The spectators also broke out in sweat.\"Damn it\" The veins on Hong Zhen's forehead twitched violently and he said impatiently, \"Why did you encounter such a difficult demonic beast?\"Wolves were notoriously difficult to deal with. They only obeyed the orders of the Wolf King and did not know what fear was! It's the kind of beast who never gives up until he gets what he wants.The key was the difference in cultivation realms! Xiang Nan might be able to defeat a Origin Realm demonic beast, but how could he resist so many Origin Realm demonic beasts at once?Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes and slowly retreated.As for the demonic wolf, it did not attack Xiang Nan. Xiang Nan retreated and entered, while Xiang Nan retreated when he entered.\"What is it doing\" Xiang Nan frowned and injected the lightning attribute into his eyes. In an instant, clouds of bright and clear demonic energy appeared in Xiang Nan's field of vision.\"It's broken! They're actually setting up an array!\"Wherever Xiang Nan could see, there were already demonic wolves ambushed in the surrounding bushes! They formed a circle and trapped Xiang Nan in the middle.Wolves have always been organized and disciplined, with a clear and efficient division of labour when hunting.Xiang Nan couldn't wait any longer. He expected them to secretly look for an opportunity, so it was better for him to take the lead!Thinking of this, Xiang Nan immediately held his saber and rushed towards the wolf. He raised the saber in his hand and a three-meter-long saber qi shot towards the wolf.At this time, the head wolf quickly retreated. Seven demonic wolves jumped out from the bushes beside Xiang Nan, each of them at the 1st level of Origin Return.The seven demonic wolves were arranged in a circular pattern, one on the left, one on the right, one on the right, two on the left, and five on the left.Xiang Nan dodged the attacks of the demonic wolves on the left and right, but was bitten by the demonic wolves on the right.The sharp fangs, the Origin Realm, instantly pierced through Xiang Nan's skin, and the wolf fangs mercilessly embedded themselves into his flesh and blood.When Xiang Nan slashed down with his saber, wanting to chop down the demonic wolf that bit him, the demonic wolf did not hesitate to fight and quickly let go of its mouth and retreated.\"Raptors swing their tails!\" Xiang Nan's aura sank, and the black-scaled saber slashed out horizontally. A crescent-shaped saber aura that was close to full circle slashed out in all directions.The other four of the five demonic wolves turned around and fled. They jumped into the bush and just happened to dodge Xiang Nan's slash.Meanwhile, the other two demonic wolves that hadn't moved all this time jumped over from mid-air!Xiang Nan slashed a demonic wolf's shoulder and landed on the ground. Half of the blade was embedded in the demonic wolf's flesh and blood, but the other demonic wolf bit on Xiang Nan's right shoulder.With this bite, Xiang Nan almost lost his grip on the giant saber.When he used the hilt of his saber to smash down the demonic wolf that was biting his shoulder and was about to make up for it, the demonic wolf quickly returned to the bush.At the same time, Xiang Nan felt a burning pain in his back, but it was a sneak attack by a wolf that bit Xiang Nan's back! The target was Xiang Nan's spine. Fortunately, Xiang Nan had black armor to defend himself.By the time Xiang Nan counterattacked, the head wolf had already escaped.In the next few rounds, Xiang Nan suffered many losses! The pack of demonic wolves did not clash head-on with Xiang Nan at all. They engaged in guerrilla warfare and attacked in batches. Every time Xiang Nan wanted to retaliate, they would immediately retreat.On the other hand, Xiang Nan's body was already covered in colors, and his clothes were dyed red with fresh blood.This kind of guerrilla warfare from the wolves made Xiang Nan extremely annoyed and unable to defend against it!Every demonic wolf was at the 1st level of Origin Return! This made Xiang Nan have to use great concentration to deal with one of them, but the other demonic wolves were waiting for an opportunity to attack, always making Xiang Nan's concentration insufficient.Xiang Nan thought quickly. It was obviously unwise to use lightning to deal with the pack of wolves at this time! One lightning strike after another was an unbearable amount of consumption.And the pack of wolves was too scattered, and it was impossible to destroy all of them at once with the power of the lightning.In the end, if the weather was wasted, the results might not be too good.While Xiang Nan was thinking, the pack of wolves didn't wait silly. They turned into shadows and swished across the battlefield. They all retreated in one blow, regardless of whether they succeeded or not.Xiang Nan's robe had been torn to pieces. Blood flowed down his fist and dripped onto the ground, splitting open red flowers of blood.\"It's broken.\" Elder Menyue's brows furrowed. \"Xiang Nan's cultivation level is too low. It's simply not enough to deal with so many opponents. Even if the wolves don't kill him, they can still drag Xiang Nan to death.\"Everyone was thinking about countermeasures quickly in their minds. Many people had come up with a solution, but their method could only be based on the premise that Xiang Nan must be at the Origin Returning Realm!At this moment, Xiang Nan suddenly turned around and sprinted towards the starting point! His speed was extremely fast.\"Haha.\" Wang Xiaoyun was the first to laugh coldly, \"I thought that Xiang Nan was so brave. In the end, he still wanted to flee in a sorry state. What about bravery? He was just pretending to be brave.\"Yue Bufan nodded his head, \"However, even if Xiang Nan escapes back to the starting point now, it will be useless, right? That pack of wolf demons will follow him back.\"Everyone sighed and mocked, pointing at Xiang Nan.'\"Hmm? Something's wrong\" No one could see the problem, only City Lord Hong Zhen could see it.He observed the situation below. Xiang Nan was running wildly in front of him, while the pack of wolves followed closely behind him.This scene suddenly reminded Hong Zhen of an array method he had used to fight on the battlefield\"This brat!\" City Lord Hong Zhen's eyes lit up and he laughed loudly.Just as everyone was puzzled by Hong Zhen's laughter, someone shouted, \"Look!\"Xiang Nan, who was sprinting at full speed, suddenly stomped right in front of him! The impact of this kick caused him to instantly turn from running wildly into retreating!Halfway back, Xiang Nan twisted his body and stabbed his saber into the ground! The Yuan Qi in his entire body surged, and then an explosive Azure Dragon went out to sea!Originally, the pack of wolves chasing after Xiang Nan could not maintain their formation because of the complicated terrain. They could only jump out of the forest and follow the road to chase after Xiang Nan.In this way, the eight wolves were dragged into a straight line by Xiang Nan.As for Xiang Nan, who was running wildly, without warning, it was a counterattack from the Jedi!One moment, Xiang Nan was still running wildly, but the next moment, he was charging in the opposite direction! He stood against the roaring flames like a long dragon going out to sea!Under Xiang Nan's current situation, that imposing aura actually appeared to be so fierce and domineering!Who said that dragons were played by shrimp in shallow water?This was a blow that Xiang Nan had used all of his strength! When the fierce dragon went out to sea, there was actually a faint dragon roar coming from the air.Eight wolf demons lined up in a row were completely overturned by Xiang Nan's single move!The final Drawing Blade Slash cut off the head of the wolf that had been pushed from the head to the tail of the wolf on the spot!The Great Moon Saber Qi soared into the sky, dazzling and dazzling.Liked it?

No matter how awkward he had been played by the wolves before, he was still a dragon!As soon as the head wolf died, the other seven wolves were immediately thrown into chaos. Especially now that they were still flying in mid-air, they had yet to land on the ground.Xiang Nan abruptly turned his head, his left index finger clattering against the black-scaled saber! He flicked his fingers three times!His fingers heavily and forcefully flicked against the blade, and a dense layer of lightning suddenly appeared on the pitch-black and shiny blade.\"His saber!\" Wang Xiaoyun's face immediately turned ashen with anger, \"His saber actually has a hidden attribute! It can stimulate lightning power!\"Everyone had been shocked by Xiang Nan's Jedi counterattack, but now they saw such a shocking scene. All of them were actually speechless with their mouths open.The lightning that appeared on the blade was naturally deliberately disguised by Xiang Nan. He wanted others to misunderstand and think that the lightning was emitted by the Black Scaled Saber.\"No wonder \u2026\" Wang Changhe gasped. \"No wonder his saber is so strange that it can be freely upgraded. It turns out that it has hidden lightning attributes.\"When Xiang Nan ejected the blade, he immediately removed the bandage and clashed with his hands more than a dozen times with the buzzing sound of the blade.Thunder King Seal, Lightning!Pu! Xiang Nan took a deep breath and spat out a huge ball of lightning through his palm print!The ball of lightning grew larger and larger, to the point that it was ten meters in diameter, enough to cover all the wolf demons.The seven Wolf Demons were struck by Hao Lightning, all of them stiff.Xiang Nan moved forward with his saber in hand. He raised his saber and landed. Seven times in a row, the fierce dragon waved its tail. Seven crescent moons of saber qi cut off all seven wolf heads.Everyone was dumbfounded, unable to find a single word to describe their current mood.A Xiantian sixth layer martial artist first killed a Xiantian first layer wind bull, then he killed eight Xiantian first layer demonic wolves!Xiang Nan's journey could be said to be incredibly dangerous, but he was also able to cut through thorns and thorns, adding an incomparable amount of excitement to his adventure.\"Damn it, how is this possible!\" Wang Xiaoyun cursed angrily on the spot.And in the demonic forest below, Xiang Nan wasn't feeling well either!Because the enemy's realm was too high, it was impossible for him to kill demonic beasts normally. Even if he found the best opportunity, he still had to use the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique to chop off the wolf head.At this moment, not only was Xiang Nan covered in bruises, but he was also facing the test of losing his physical strength and the previous weather.Xiang Nan sat cross-legged on the ground and took out a new set of robes from his storage ring. He tore open the old robes, mixed them with spirit herbs, and wrapped them around all the wounds on his body.\"Fortunately, there is no Wolf King, otherwise it would be even more troublesome.\" Xiang Nan muttered to himself.Looks like these eight wolves are only a small army of demonic wolves. Only the head wolf leads, but the wolf king is not here.Otherwise, the moment the Wolf King appeared, he would at least be a second level Origin Returning monster.Xiang Nan looked at the storage ring. There were only the last two second-grade Rejuvenation Pills left. Unless he had no other choice, he could not casually use them. He did not know what kind of predicament he would face in the future.Moreover, he didn't have much time left. Looking at the sky, more than two hours had passed. He could only rest for a while before continuing forward with his saber in his hand.In the other 299 tunnels, the contestants were also in high spirits. They used their various martial skills to display their brilliant side with all their might.Facing a Xiantian realm demonic beast that didn't use any martial techniques, this was a great opportunity for the other contestants to show themselves.However, they did not know that the 300th passageway was filled with spectacular and dangerous battles.\"Xiaoyun, do you see that?\" An envoy from Chihuo Sect whispered to Wang Xiaoyun, \"That brat can actually use the black saber to release a strange martial skill.\"Wang Xiaoyun nodded silently. Everyone saw Xiang Nan's Lightning King Seal.\"I didn't expect that this brat wouldn't reveal his secret.\" Wang Xiaoyun gritted his teeth and said fiercely, \"It must be that damned woman from the Huangpu Clan who gave him the martial skill!\"The envoy from Chihuo Sect smiled sinisterly, \"A saber with lightning attributes and a martial skill corresponding to the saber is really not bad.\"\"If we can seize that saber \u2026\"\"Junior Brother.\" Wang Xiaoyun waved his hand and interrupted the messenger beside him. He whispered, \"Don't say such words casually.\"At the side, City Lord Hong Zhen heaved a sigh of relief, and a smile appeared on his face again. \"This kid Xiang Nan always gives me too many surprises.\"Below.Xiang Nan was still advancing with the saber in his hand. He checked his storage ring and found that there were only two low-grade spirit stones left. After thinking for a while, he still couldn't bear to use them.The Rushing Thunder Saber was a martial skill that he had created himself. It consumed more physical strength. Whether it was the Rejuvenation Spirit Herb or the Rejuvenation Pill, their greatest function was only to heal wounds. Their recovery of physical strength was still relatively limited.Fortunately, he had spent less time on the first day, so he didn't need to use such a precious resource as low-grade spirit stones.After walking a bit further, a river that was hidden within the Demon Forest appeared.\"You came in time.\" Xiang Nan smiled and immediately rushed in, using the cool river water to wash his body.After two fierce battles, Xiang Nan's body was already exhausted. At this time, he could recover some of his spirit energy by rushing into Qing Shui's body.\"Hmm? That's\" Xiang Nan shook off the water droplets at the ends of his hair and suddenly saw a strange plant by the river.It was a very strange thing. The trees were shorter than the trees, but the grass was taller than the grass. It was four to five meters taller, and there were red fruits on the trees.\"Ah! It's actually the Demon Origin Fruit!\" After Xiang Nan saw the fruit clearly, he was immediately overjoyed.This was the Origin Returning Region. The demonic beasts' realms were all very high. The dense demonic energy gave birth to something that was rarely seen in other regions, the Demonic Origin Fruit!The Demon Origin Fruit was a treasure that could nourish one's meridians and martial cultivation. Its greatest function was to quickly recover one's strength!\"This is really what you want.\" Xiang Nan swiftly swept his eyes over the tree. There were a total of three Demon Origin Fruits on the tree! These three fruits were extremely precious to Xiang Nan.Just as he was overjoyed and was about to pluck the Demon Origin Fruit, a shadow flashed past the corner of his eyes!Xiang Nan's reaction was swift. He didn't even think about it. He subconsciously dodged the attack of the shadow.But then, another shadow appeared.Xiang Nan could only feel his left arm being grabbed by something, and then his entire body soared into the air and was fiercely thrown out of the river.Bang bang!The enormous projection force caused Xiang Nan to break two towering ancient trees in a row before stopping.He rubbed his shoulders and looked back. He saw two purple-furred monkeys hanging upside down on the Demon Origin Fruit Tree!The two purple-haired monkeys had a cluster of flame-like fur on their foreheads, and their eyes shone with a faint purple flame.\"Purple Flame Spirit Monkey!\" Xiang Nan felt his scalp go numb.Liked it?

Although its name was Spirit Monkey, it was actually a demonic beast. It was a demonic monkey.Almost no one would take the initiative to provoke such a monkey. Generally speaking, the Purple Flame Spirit Monkey would not take the initiative to attack humans.But as long as it was eyeing him, it would definitely be terrible.Xiang Nan had seen this kind of thing in the demonic beast atlas. At this moment, he observed that the two demonic monkeys in front of him were both at the 1st level of the Origin Returning Realm.\"Yes \u2026 the two of them must be guarding the Demon Origin Fruit.\"Xiang Nan understood. It must be because he coveted the Demon Origin Fruit that he angered the two monkeys. He then said to the two monkeys, \"I won't move the Demon Origin Fruit. We won't offend the water in the well.\"Based on the mentality that one more thing was better than one less thing, Xiang Nan did not want to add another battle to himself, so he turned around and left.However, he had barely taken three steps when he heard a sharp sound from behind him, and he hurriedly jumped to dodge.At the same time, a purple fireball almost wiped Xiang Nan's clothes and shot towards the land ahead with a whoosh, followed by a violent explosion!The fire wolf created by the terrifying explosion directly overturned Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan stabilized his posture in midair. He landed calmly and steadily. Turning around, two purple fireballs rose from the hands of the two monkeys.Xiang Nan said angrily, \"I've already said that I won't touch your Demon Origin Fruit! Don't force me to do it.\"On the flying ship, City Lord Hong Zhen shook his head and muttered to himself, \"It's useless to reason with these demonic monkeys. They're worried that Xiang Nan will go back to find help, so they won't let go of human martial artists easily.\"In order to interfere with the contestants as little as possible, City Lord Hong Zhen still didn't shout these words out for Xiang Nan to hear.However, just as Hong Zhen said, the two monkeys really didn't intend to let Xiang Nan off.A demonic monkey hooked a branch with its tail and swung it abruptly, soaring into the sky!The monkey threw two purple fireballs at Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan hurriedly turned around and dodged. Two violent explosions exploded in the place where Xiang Nan was previously! Fierce waves of fire and air swept around, causing Xiang Nan's body to become unstable.Immediately after, the other monkey jumped into the sky. The two monkeys launched an even fiercer attack, but their hands were continuously throwing out purple fireballs!Those purple fireballs were almost in a row, one after another, and in an instant, they had thrown out a total of sixteen fireballs!Xiang Nan sprinted wildly on the ground, jumping left and right. Fireballs chased after him one after another, exploding not far from his heels.Swoosh swoosh swoosh!Rumble rumble rumble rumble!A river was blasted into the sky and drizzled, while the surrounding forest was engulfed by a sea of fire.Too fast! The two monkeys quickly threw out fireballs, giving Xiang Nan almost no chance to catch his breath.The tyrannical waves of fire and air engulfed Xiang Nan time and time again, and every time they engulfed, Xiang Nan shot out from the waves of fire in the next instant, bringing out a rope-shaped flame.Although he wasn't at the heart of the fireball explosion, the edge waves were enough to give Xiang Nan a headache.The purple flames were very powerful, causing the robes that Xiang Nan had used to protect himself from the weather to be burned one by one. They were almost uncovered, and there were scorched black marks all over his body.\"Damn it, you're too much of a bully!\" With a saturated sound, Xiang Nan turned around and slashed out with his saber!The three-meter saber qi soared into the sky, but it was blasted into pieces by countless fireballs, and more fireballs descended from the sky.Xiang Nan thought to himself. He was about to flee this place, but the road ahead was blocked by fireballs. A string of fireballs rained down on him.The most hateful thing was that the two monkeys were able to keep their bodies suspended by the ejection force of the ball.Xiang Nan was helpless and could only continue to dodge. The rumbling explosions in his ears caused his ears to buzz and his brain to feel somewhat chaotic.\"Not good!\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and his mind was in a state of chaos. This was a sign of water loss from his body! He had stayed near the purple flames for too long. If he continued, he would probably go into dehydration shock.This purple flame was no ordinary fire! It was the Purple Flame Spirit Monkey's demonic fire.\"You forced me!\" Xiang Nan was ruthless as he turned around and disappeared in a flash!The next moment, Xiang Nan's afterimage suddenly appeared in the sky behind the two monkeys.The weather before the Flash Steps was consumed was extremely terrifying! Ten times was enough to exhaust Xiang Nan, because Xiang Nan was unwilling to waste it, but now he had no way out.\"Raptors swing their tails!\"The black-scaled saber swept horizontally, and a large crescent blade Qi appeared!However, at this moment, an earth-shattering roar appeared!The roar came from below. What was terrifying was that just this roar had actually spat out a thick air cannon!Before Xiang Nan and the two monkeys could decide, the terrifying air cannon had already sent all three of them flying.Xiang Nan fell into the air and looked down. He felt all the pores on his body open. He couldn't help but curse, \"Fuck your grandmother!\"A seven-meter-tall brown bear stood upright by the river!Earth Element, Steel Berserk Bear! The second level of the Origin Returning Realm!Xiang Nan thought to himself, how could he be so unlucky! Are there any good days left? The demonic beasts came wave after wave.Before the two demonic monkeys could be dealt with, an even more terrifying monster appeared.I wonder if the explosion just now lured this damned brown bear over.However, this was not the end! The bushes on the other side moved a few times, and a huge monster also walked out.\"Wind Bull!\" Xiang Nan didn't know what expression to use to describe his current state of mind.Another Wind Bull at the 1st level of the Origin Reversion Stage! Was he fated to be with the wind bull?Judging from its size, the brown bear was bigger than the wind bull!The wind bull didn't know what was going on, but it actually dashed towards the Demon Origin Fruit Tree.This action not only angered the two monkeys, but also angered the Steel Berserk Bear.\"Moo!\" Phoenix Eyes roared, her body moving like the wind!\"Roar!\" The Steel Berserk Bear's limbs landed on the ground, and it began to run rapidly.The two big fellows collided, but the Steel Berserk Bear used a pair of large front claws to firmly grab onto the horns of the Wind Bull.\"What a powerful impact! As expected of an Earth-type demonic beast.\" Xiang Nan was stunned for a moment. He knew how fierce Feng Niu's charge was.However, the Steel Berserk Bear actually managed to catch the Wind Bull's charge in one go.Immediately after, an even more terrifying scene appeared. The Steel Berserk Bear opened its mouth and bit onto the forehead of the wind bull, shattering the head of the wind bull!Following that, the Steel Berserk Bear's pair of forelimbs suddenly became twice as thick. Its hair stood upright, its muscles bulging high, and it was filled with explosive power.Swoosh! The Steel Berserk Bear actually forcefully tore the Wind Bull into two halves with its bare hands.Xiang Nan's pupils contracted, and he felt a buzzing sound in his mind.Liked it?

Looking down, there was no demon crystal stone in the torn head of the wind bull.Looking at the Steel Berserk Bear, it twisted its huge body a few times and walked towards the Demon Origin Fruit Tree step by step.The two monkeys were originally trembling with fear because of the appearance of the Steel Berserk Bear, but seeing that the Steel Berserk Bear was targeting the Demon Origin Fruit, the two monkeys immediately went crazy!Search! Swoosh!A series of purple fireballs shot towards the Steel Berserk Bear one after another.The Steel Berserk Bear suddenly turned around and roared angrily. Its entire body instantly swelled! When he stood on both legs, he had already grown from seven meters to ten meters tall!To humans, this height was simply insurmountable like a mountain.That 10-meter-tall visual impact caused Xiang Nan to immediately think of avoiding it.More than a dozen purple fireballs exploded on the Steel Berserk Bear's body. Rumbling sounds could be heard endlessly, and the surrounding trees were destroyed in one fell swoop! Only the Demon Origin Fruit Tree was blocked by the Berserk Bear's body and survived.However, what was terrifying was that when the flames dissipated, the Steel Berserk Bear stood unharmed on the spot! The hair on his body couldn't even be found to burn.Rough skin and thick flesh! His strength was boundless! These eight words were the perfect explanation for the Steel Berserk Bear.\"Monster\" Xiang Nan grinned.The Berserk Bear turned around again to pick the Demon Origin Fruit. The two Demon Monkeys tossed out a dozen more purple fireballs.The dense fireball exploded on the bear's back, causing it to fall two steps forward. This time, it turned around.The Violent Bear's eyes were bloody red. It roared angrily as its limbs landed on the ground and it ran towards the Monster Monkeys.That was a ten-meter tall body! He sprinted wildly and instantly arrived at the bottom of the demonic monkey.The two demonic monkeys hurriedly jumped into the sky and threw out a string of purple fireballs as they leapt into the air.When the Berserk Bear Man stood up, it was like a vertical jump on the spot! That terrifying height of ten meters caused it to jump more than fifty meters in an instant!A series of fireballs exploded on the bear's head, forming a rolling sea of fire.However, the top of the sea of flames was raised by something, and then a large claw pierced through the sea of flames, firmly grasping the tail of a demonic monkey.As it descended, the bear grabbed a monkey, swung it round, and smashed it fiercely onto the ground.If it was smashed solid this time, it would definitely smash the demonic monkey into pieces!Another demonic monkey let out a mournful cry. It actually rushed down first with a whoosh and then lay flat on the ground!The berserk bear grabbed another monkey and heavily dropped it, smashing it onto the back of the other monkey.Xiang Nan was shocked. He hadn't expected that another monkey would actually be willing to use its fleshly body to endure harm for its companion!The two monkeys were already on the verge of death. They looked at Xiang Nan in despair with pleading expressions in their eyes.The Steel Berserk Bear raised its leg and stepped on the back of a demonic monkey.The demonic monkey was trampled on, its entire stomach sunk deep into the ground, and its limbs and head were raised high, almost crushed into meat paste.The other monkey watched as his companion was abused, its mouth creaking in sorrow, but it was already powerless to save him.The demonic monkey stared at Xiang Nan with eager eyes. There were actually tears rolling in its eyes.However, Xiang Nan was stunned and was shocked by the love of the monkey couple just now.The love he had experienced was only the most painful betrayal. He no longer trusted his partner.The husband and wife were originally birds of the same forest, so they flew separately in the face of great calamity! What a sad and ridiculous sentence.At this moment, Xiang Nan looked at the helpless and sad look in the monkey's eyes. He gritted his teeth and angrily scolded the monkey, \"It's not the time for you to bomb me just now! Do you need my help now?\"\"I'm telling you, don't even think about it!\"After saying that, Xiang Nan held the knife and turned around to leave.Behind him came the roar of a berserk bear and the wailing of a demonic monkey.Xiang Nan took a step forward. After hearing the miserable scream, his footsteps paused for a moment. He braved his scalp and continued walking.Suddenly, another fireball exploded. It must have been the monkey that used the fireball to blow up the bear to save its companion. However, the explosion this time was so weak. Clearly, the monkey's demonic power was running out.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and raised his hand to slap his face. He scolded himself angrily, \"F*ck! I'll make your heart soften!\"With that, he turned around and pointed his saber at the bear, roaring, \"Let go of those two monkeys!\"The Steel Berserk Bear was grabbing the legs of a demonic monkey, preparing to tear it in half.The veins on Xiang Nan's forehead bulged, \"I told you to let go of those two monkeys!\"As he spoke, he raised his hand and slashed! Saber Qi whistled past and slashed heavily into the bear's chest.With this saber strike, even one of the bear's hair was cut off, but it angered the bear.The bear casually tossed the monkey aside, and a pair of blood-red eyes locked onto Xiang Nan.On the flying ship, everyone was speechless.No one expected that Xiang Nan would be so stupid as to seek his own death!City Lord Hong Zhen smiled bitterly, \"Is this brat just asking for a word of righteousness? Is he still the same for demonic beasts? Sigh!\"A gentle light flashed in Elder Menyue's eyes.The various elders of the other sects were filled with mixed emotions.In that instant, they were really moved by Xiang Nan. In fact, Xiang Nan didn't need to find this trouble. He could have turned around and left.\"If you have the ability, come at me! Let go of those two monkeys!\"Below, Xiang Nan's roar echoed endlessly in the demonic forest.The Berserk Bear had already landed on the ground and was running towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan took a deep breath and no longer regretted it. Since he had chosen to be so brave, he had to pay the price for his actions!His legs were crossed steadily, and the dense early weather poured into the black-scaled saber. The saber began to tremble unprecedentedly.This was the third move of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique, the Berserk Dragon Battle TideThis was also the first time Xiang Nan had used this move in front of others.The Berserk Dragon Battle Tide was a martial skill that grew more and more ferocious in the Vietnam War. Saber after saber chopping, saber after saber-accumulated strength. The next saber was always more powerful than the previous one!With a leap, Xiang Nan slashed down on the bear's forehead. This slash was three times as powerful as before, reaching 7,800 jin.The giant saber landed on the bear's forehead, producing a crisp sound of metal joining together.Clang!The tremendous rebound force not only sent Xiang Nan flying, but also numbed his entire right arm.Berserk Bear waved his left arm and easily sent Xiang Nan flying.It was so powerful that Xiang Nan felt as if he had been hit by a mountain, and his entire body was about to fall apart.\"Realm suppression is too powerful.\" City Lord Hong Zhen frowned.Xiang Nan was only at the Xiantian sixth layer, while Bao Xiong was at the Gui Yuan second layer! Between the two sides, there was a difference of five small realms!However, Xiang Nan, who had broken seven or eight ancient trees in a row, rushed out again.He tightly gripped the hilt of his saber. Although he was heavily injured by the Berserk Bear's attack, the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide's special attributes made Xiang Nan's fighting spirit even more intense!His strength was burning intensely, and the uncontrollable impulse to fight in his body made him ignore his own injuries.\"Again!\" Xiang Nan roared and took the initiative to charge towards the berserk bear.A blade descended from the sky!The power of this saber reached 8,200 jin! It was four hundred jin more powerful than the previous saber!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The three-meter-tall saber blocked Xiang Nan's entire predecessor. Moreover, the Berserk Bear did not possess the flexibility of a human martial artist, nor did it know any techniques such as changing moves or dismantling moves.This slap landed on the Black Scaled Saber.If it was an Inferior Grade Spirit Weapon, the saber would probably be shattered on the spot. If it was an Intermediate Grade Spirit Weapon, cracks would probably appear.However, the high-grade Spirit Weapon Black Scales was able to withstand the power of the Berserk Bear's claw. Although it still sent Xiang Nan flying, it still managed to save Xiang Nan's life.The terrifying impact of the berserk bear made Xiang Nan feel his bones groan and show signs of cracking at any moment.However, Xiang Nan's battle intent grew even higher, and it was almost about to soar into the nine heavens.Third Slash!Xiang Nan soared into the sky. He stepped on a tree trunk and ejected himself downwards. The giant saber slashed down, slicing off the head of the berserk bear three times!8,600 jin! The might of the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide increased by another 400 jin!Boom!The Berserk Bear was struck into a rage, and a pair of large claws went up enough for Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan dodged with a flash step, and the fourth blade descended!Boom!Nine thousand jin!The earth trembled, and deep cracks spread out from beneath the bear's feet.Before the Berserk Bear could react, Xiang Nan's fifth blade slashed down!Boom!9,400 jin!The fur on the bear's forehead was finally cut open! Even his skin and flesh had been split open, and traces of blood flowed out.The violent bear was so angry that it almost went mad. Its huge claws swung round and smashed into Xiang Nan's black saber.This claw was extremely powerful, only causing Xiang Nan to spit out a mouthful of sweet blood at the edge of the saber! His entire body quickly fell to the ground and rebounded from the ground.Under normal circumstances, this claw was enough to make Xiang Nan lose all his ability to move, but the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide had caused Xiang Nan to fall into a berserk state!Xiang Nan was in a state of excitement and intense fighting spirit. He could no longer feel the pain of his injuries. The more intense the injuries were, the higher his fighting spirit became.He jumped up and quickly rushed forward. The blade dragged the ground, raising a string of dust!Sixth Saber!With a single slash of his saber, he had a strength of 12,000kg! It had increased by a total of eight hundred kilograms!The bear lowered its head and bent its upper body slightly.As for Xiang Nan, he stepped on the bear's shoulder and his body rose. As he descended, the seventh blade slashed down!Boom! 11,200 jin! Increase strength by 1,000 jin!Xiang Nan felt his blood boil! There was a buzzing sound in his mind. He could not feel any pain or fear.There was only one word in his mind.Battle! Battle! Battle!The unprecedented berserk state caused Xiang Nan's various bodies to soar to an inconceivable height.With one claw of the bear, Xiang Nan actually turned sideways and dodged!Eighth Saber! 12,200 jin! Increase strength by 1,200 jin!The power of this saber strike was almost comparable to the power of a saber strike from Xiang Nan using the power of the White Flame Lightning Flame!On the flying ship, everyone was dumbfounded! Their heartbeats accelerated one by one, and as Xiang Nan slashed down with each slash, their hearts began to beat fiercely!Too violent! They had never seen such a reckless and violent fighting style!The violent bear's head was already dripping with blood. It roared angrily and scratched everywhere, but it was unable to catch Xiang Nan's body no matter what.Battle! Battle! Battle!At this moment, Xiang Nan only had these three words in his mind, echoing unceasingly!Bang it! Bang this damn bear!\"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!\" Xiang Nan leapt into the sky, and he finally drew out a trace of incomparably precious white flame lightning power.He flicked his left hand three times on the blade.Zheng! Zheng! Zheng!The white lightning instantly engulfed the black saber, causing Xiang Nan's strength to double!The power of lightning was 13,000 jin, plus the 12,000 jin just now. After removing three times the basic explosive power of 7,800 jin, it would be 17,200 jin of power!This was something Xiang Nan had no choice but to do. Although the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide had infinitely increased his combat strength, Xiang Nan's body was limited.If he continued burning his body like this, he would be able to burn Xiang Nan into a dried corpse with two more slashes.However, the 17,200 jin strength of this saber was definitely not something to be trifled with.The heavy saber slashed down in the sky, drawing a dense brilliance!The black blade wrapped in white lightning violently exploded on the Steel Berserk Bear's head.This saber directly smashed the bear to the ground, and its ten-meter-tall body actually fiercely rebounded!On the ground, cracks half a meter wide spread out in all directions.The Violent Bear rolled its eyes, and its huge body landed heavily on the ground again.Pu!The berserk bear smashed up the smoke and dust in the sky.As for Xiang Nan, he was finally exhausted. He leaned against a tree and panted violently. When the effects of the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide disappeared, the pain in his entire body caused Xiang Nan to grimace in pain and the corners of his eyes to twitch.\"My God \u2026\" Elder Yue Bufan 's eyes twitched. \"What kind of martial skill is that! It's even more powerful than his charging martial skill!\"No one was in the mood to answer Yue Bufan 's question. Everyone was dumbfounded and their blood boiled.This battle between a man and a bear was not an exaggeration to describe it as magnificent!Below, Xiang Nan was leaning against a tree, and his movements were extremely difficult.Not far away, blood flowed out of the bear's head and gathered into a stream that flowed into the cracks in the ground.But very quickly, the violent bear rolled its eyes back and jumped up.The hearts of all the spectators twitched!\"He's actually not dead yet!\" Elder Yue cried out.At the side, Elder Yue's senior brother said in a deep voice, \"After all, Xiang Nan is only at the sixth level of the Xiantian realm. To be able to do so, he has far exceeded our expectations.\"A second level Origin Returning demonic beast was not that easy to kill, and the suppression of one's cultivation realm was not just a matter of words.However, after looking at Xiang Nan, the bear limped away. Its huge body recovered to seven meters and disappeared into the bush.Xiang Nan, who was leaning against the tree, did not have the slightest bit of fear in his eyes. He chuckled and thought to himself, \"Consider yourself a savage bear.\"If you come again, I can only use the Sparrow King Seal. I still plan to keep this trump card.\"Pfft!\" Xiang Nan spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva, dragging his exhausted and severely injured body as he slowly moved into the distance.\"He still wants to advance?\" Everyone on the flying ship was stunned.Time waits for no one! Ever since Xiang Nan insisted on going his own way and deciding to enter this path of returning to his origin, he had no intention of giving up! If you want to leave, you have to go to the end.But as he walked, Xiang Nan's right hand was suddenly pulled.He turned around and saw that a relatively light-wounded demonic monkey was grabbing a Demonic Origin Fruit.Xiang Nan was stunned, \"This \u2026 this is the Demon Origin Fruit that you are desperately trying to protect. Are you prepared to give me one?\"The demonic monkey rubbed its head against Xiang Nan's calf, stuffed the Demonic Origin Fruit into Xiang Nan's hand, and limped to find the other demonic monkey.Xiang Nan held the Demon Origin Fruit in his hand and knocked the Schisandra BottleLater, he smiled and followed suit, heading into the distance.Liked it?

If one ate it in conjunction with the instant one's cultivation realm increased, then one would be able to display the maximum effect of the Demon Origin Fruit.One had to know that very few pills that could be seen on the market could directly raise the martial arts realm. This made the Demon Origin Fruit even more precious.Xiang Nan reluctantly put the Demon Origin Fruit into his storage ring, took out a second-grade Rejuvenation Pill, and muttered to himself, \"Right now, there is no sign of breaking through the bottleneck in my realm. I'll eat the Demon Origin Fruit when I break through.\"The Tier 2 Rejuvenation Pill was also a treasure of great tonification. When a pill entered his stomach, the warm medicinal power instantly spread to his limbs and bones, causing Xiang Nan to let out a long and comfortable cry.He had eaten the Spring Restoration Pill many times in the past, but never before had he drank a ladle of cold spring water as cheerful as this one, as if he was about to die of thirst.\"Eh \u2026 as expected, the weaker the pill is, the more effective it will be.\" Xiang Nan leaned against the tree trunk and stretched lazily. He felt his eyelids heavy and he felt somewhat sleepy.A few high- highly intense battles had exhausted his body.At this moment, countless wounds on his body and the cracks on his bones were being repaired by the Rejuvenation Pill at an extremely fast rate, especially the recovery rate of the dense wounds on his body's surface, which were visible to the naked eye.Raising his head, he looked at the sky. The sun had already begun to tilt towards the west. It was estimated that nearly seven hours had passed.According to the distance he had seen on the flying ship earlier, he had only walked half way.\"No way. If we continue at this speed, it will probably take 14 hours to reach the second examination room.\" Xiang Nan frowned deeply, hoping that the journey would be smoother.After that, he leaned against the tree and rested for almost an hour before he felt full of energy again. The injuries on his body had also recovered by seventy-seven to eighty-eight percent. Only then did he continue on his journey with a whip on his horse.At this time, eight hours had passed since the city selection began.At this moment, a loud bell-like voice suddenly sounded from the flying ship, \"Congratulations to the disciples of the Mo Clan in Bluestone City and Bluestone Town, Mo Hai. With eight hours of good results, you successfully passed the first examination hall and gained ten points.\"As soon as this voice appeared, the 299 contestants were stunned at the same time.\"So fast!\" One of the contestants exclaimed, \"As expected of Mo Hai! He really was the first to arrive at the second examination hall!\"The second examination room.\"Huh? Is this the second examination room?\" Mo Hai walked out of his own passageway. In front of him was an extremely wide-open area.This open space was enormous. It was about two thousand meters in diameter. Each of the light cages that were locked with demonic beasts stood in a forest. At first glance, these cages were arranged in a circular arrangement, one ring at a time.Mo Hai walked straight to the end of the second examination hall and discovered that there was actually a door on the light wall. There was a lock on the door, and there was a round hole in the lock.\"Lock?\" Mo Hai frowned and looked back. Suddenly, he found a statue of a fountain carved out of stone at the core of the cages.The fountain statue looked like a lion. There was a round hole on the lion's forehead, and there was a faint glow in the hole.Mo Hai took out his own brand and nodded, \"I see.\"He walked forward and poked his brand into the round hole in the lion's head. At this moment, the brand began to shine.Another voice appeared in the sky, \"Congratulations to Bluestone City, Cai Clan disciples, and Cai Jianyun for arriving at the second examination hall in eight hours and ten minutes. Increase by ten points.\"\"Mo Hai.\" As soon as Cai Jianyun walked out, he smiled and said, \"I've risked my life, but I'm still ten minutes behind you. Right, what are you doing?\"Mo Hai said, \"To enter the third exam hall, we have to unlock it. I found that we need to use a famous brand to place it inside the lion's head and charge it with spiritual energy.\"Cai Jianyun crossed the layers of light cages and arrived at the fountain. He wondered, \"Almost your entire arm is in! If a demonic beast comes out of the cage at this time, it would be very bad.\"\"Yes.\" Mo Hai smiled, \"But it doesn't matter. We don't need to deal with these demonic beasts.\"Just as he was speaking, a crisp ding sound came from the lion's head. Mo Hai took out the name plate. The name plate had already begun to shine. He said, \"I calculated that it would take about a minute from the beginning to the end of charging.\"\"Then I'll come too.\" Cai Jianyun also put the name tag in.After both of them had been recharged, they went together to open the light wall leading to the third examination hall.It was also discovered that this wall of light could only accommodate one person at a time. In other words, everyone had to recharge their own brand names.Flying ship.\"Senior Brother Xiaoyun.\" A disciple of the Chihuo Sect whispered, \"Look at Xiang Nan. He is much stronger than we imagined. If this continues, even if he will waste some time, he will still be able to enter the second examination hall, right?\"An imperceptible sneer flashed across Wang Xiaoyun's face. He lowered his voice and said, \"How can it be so easy for him, Xiang Nan, to pass the first examination? Watch the show.\"The first examination room, the 300th passageway.Xiang Nan, who had regained his vitality, sprinted forward as fast as he could. The more he lagged behind, the less points he would gain.From the looks of it, it was basically impossible to arrive at the second examination hall within ten hours.\"Eh? Something's wrong.\" Xiang Nan frowned. He looked at the scenery in front of him and said, \"Am I being paranoid? I think I've already been to this place once.\"The Black Sharp Demon Forest's environment was complex, and there weren't many iconic sceneries that could be used to observe.However, Xiang Nan had always maintained a high degree of vigilance as he walked through the Origin Returning Passage. This was also the reason why he discovered that something was amiss.With a puzzled expression on his face, he continued to charge out and quickly advanced.About an hour later, another voice came from the flying ship. Wang Jingyun and Li Qingchuan of the Wang Clan arrived at the second examination hall with good results in third and fourth place respectively.On Xiang Nan's side.Xiang Nan frowned and stared at the scenery in front of him. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Indeed, I did not see wrongly! After walking for an hour, I actually returned here!\"In nearly two and a half hours, he had already seen the same scenery for the third time.\"Could it be that my sense of direction is too bad?\" Xiang Nan raised his head to look at the sun and locked onto the direction before moving forward.Forty minutes later, he returned to his original location!\"How could this be!\" Xiang Nan's heart thumped. The tenth hour had arrived!During this period of time, a few more outstanding contestants arrived at the second examination hall.However, Xiang Nan was still trapped here!Xiang Nan began to feel anxious, \"Right, I can move horizontally and stick to the wall of light! This way, there won't be any detours, right?\"He walked a distance horizontally and found the wall of light on the far left. He continued to walk along the wall of light.Forty minutes later, Xiang Nan's face sank like water.In front of him was the same environment as before!Liked it?

If someone didn't have a good sense of direction, it was very likely that they would constantly circle around an area, unable to get out no matter what.At first, Xiang Nan did suspect that he had entered such a strange circle.However, when he walked back to his original location, he knew that the situation was not as simple as he had imagined!\"Is there some kind of hallucinatory poisonous grass here? I've always been immersed in hallucinations?\"He sniffed twice, but he didn't smell anything too peculiar.He quickly recalled that this world was very big. Indeed, there were many poisonous plants and flowers that released a strange fragrance that allowed people to enter hallucinations.However, those poisonous plants and flowers were all living in a land of great viciousness! This little Black Sharp Demon Forest wasn't enough to produce such plants.Xiang Nan frowned. He inserted the giant saber a foot deep into the ground, then quickly walked forward. The blade cut the ground, creating a long crack in the ground.Forty minutes later, Xiang Nan was stunned again.Right in front of him was actually the same place as before, and there was also such a crack in the ground there! Xiang Nan walked over, and the cracks in the ground that his saber had sliced just happened to coincide with them! Forming a straight line.\"Little Sparrow! Fly straight! Fly straight!\" Xiang Nan released the Gale Bird.The little bird spread its wings and soared, transforming into a strong wind that flew out with a whoosh.A short ten minutes later, the bird's cry came from behind!Xiang Nan turned around and saw the little bird flying over from behind and landing on his shoulder.\"What exactly is going on!\" Xiang Nan was furious! If it was just a demonic beast blocking the way, it would be easy to deal with. Just fight directly.But now, his time was wasted in circles!Moreover, after a period of torment, it was already the twelfth hour! Of the three hundred contestants, nearly two hundred had already entered the second examination hall!The second examination room.Twenty-four demonic beasts had already been unlocked on the huge open space. Later on, the contestants did not foolishly recharge their energy alone. Instead, they waited for the others. After gathering enough people, they all rushed towards the fountain.Among them were Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei.At this moment, Zhong Hua was poking his brand into the lion's head. He anxiously said, \"Why hasn't Xiang Nan come yet? What exactly happened?\"Xiang Fei was so anxious that her forehead started to sweat, \"I've been paying attention to the announcement of the flying ship. Indeed, I didn't hear Xiang Nan's name. The longer he stalls, the more demonic beasts there will be unlocked!\"\"Yes, the situation is getting worse and worse.\" Xiang Zhonghua gritted his teeth and looked not far away. When he was recharging, the other contestants were fighting fiercely against the demonic beasts to buy him time.But \u2026 what if Xiang Nan comes too late? At that time, he couldn't even find anyone to team up with Xiang Nan!Xiang Fei said ruthlessly, \"Zhong Hua, let's stay and wait for Xiang Nan! If there is no one to help him, he will definitely not be able to succeed on his own!\"\"That won't do!\" Someone beside him immediately cried out in dissatisfaction, \"It's your business if you two want to wait. We won't stay here to accompany you! Damn it, another demonic beast has come out of the cage. These are twenty-five!\"\"And you two take a look! These demonic beasts can't be completely killed!\"As they spoke, Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei turned to look at the light screen behind them.Sure enough! Every time he killed a Xiantian fifth level demonic beast, another one would come out from the light screen behind him! Refill with numbers.In other words, even if they killed all three hundred demonic beasts, there would still be three hundred new demonic beasts filling in.Stay here and wait for someone? That meant endless battles! Until he was killed by a demonic beast or died from exhaustion.\"What should we do! What exactly should we do?\" Xiang Fei was anxious.Xiang Zhonghua regained some calm and took out his name tag. \"Waiting is not the way. Before Xiang Nan comes, I'm afraid the two of us will die.\"\"Forget it, let's go! Believe in Xiang Nan's strength!\"Xiang Fei was also helpless. She could only clench her teeth and nod. After everyone had finished charging, she protected each other and walked towards the light wall of the third examination hall.Fourteen hours have passed.\"The 276th contestant entered the second examination hall. It was Blue Stone City, a disciple of the Su Clan, Su Mei.\"Only a few minutes later, the announcement sounded again, \"Su Mei is dead. She has lost the qualifications for the city selection.\"The second exam hall was an \"endless cage\". Killing a demonic beast would revive a demonic beast! If a person charged forward, the probability of completing the charge would be very low!The key point was that if they were unable to recharge their energy, they would not be able to leave the second examination hall. They could neither advance nor retreat, which meant that the contestants would have to fight the demonic beasts non-stop until they died!The spectators on the flying ship were all horrified when they saw this scene.It was already the fourteenth hour, and he had unlocked forty-eight Xiantian fifth level demonic beasts.\"This is bad.\" City Lord Hong Zhen couldn't hold his breath anymore. If Xiang Nan was the last to arrive at the second examination hall, he would have to face the siege of many demonic beasts alone!How could a person, under the siege of a demonic beast, spare a hand to charge up for up to a minute?\"What exactly is Xiang Nan doing?\" Hong Zhen lowered his head and saw that Xiang Nan was standing motionless. He was starting to feel anxious for Xiang Nan.Below.\"Wang Xiaoyun, you bastard!\" Xiang Nan held the knife in his hand and his eyes were incomparably red!He could already tell that he had always been lost. It was impossible for him to be a problem with the Black Sharp Demon Forest itself, but someone had done something here!Thinking with his toes, he knew that Wang Xiaoyun was definitely behind this!Xiang Nan took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, \"I must be in a formation! I'm so stupid! Why didn't I think of it earlier?\"Formations were profound and unfathomable knowledge. Their profundity had even surpassed alchemy and artifact forging.Xiang Nan guessed that the place he was in should have been set up with a lost array.The Lost Array wasn't a big one, but it was precisely because of this that there were hundreds of Lost Arrays in existence in the world! Unless Xiang Nan was proficient in formations, or was able to tell what kind of lost formation he was trapped in.Otherwise, it would be too difficult to break through the formation.When Xiang Nan thought about it carefully, he knew about thirty-two types of Lost Arrays! If he tried one by one, it would probably take too much time.Moreover, what if the lost array here was just one of the thirty-two that he knew?Liked it?

He first sketched out a diagram of the \"Wandering Demon Lost Formation\" in his mind.There were only two ways to break through the formation. One was to use a \"miracle of strength\" to directly destroy the entire formation region. Obviously, Xiantian realm Xiang Nan did not possess such a powerful strength.The second was to destroy the array eyes! The Liang Lost Formation had a total of three formation eyes. The three needle eyes changed directions every five minutes.\"This is where I got lost. This should be the core of the formation.\"Xiang Nan stabbed the giant saber into the ground, using the saber as the center of the circle, his hands pointing to calculate the direction of the formation's meridians.The moment he entered the array, the array was activated. He had been trapped in the lost array for six hours, and the array eyes had changed 72 times.Xiang Nan quickly calculated in his heart that if he changed directions seventy-two times, then the first array eye should be thirty-six feet to the right and twenty-four feet to the front.Xiang Nan immediately rushed out. He moved thirty-six zhang horizontally to the right and then twenty-four zhang forward. After finding his position, he injected the weather into his right hand and slapped it on the ground.The weather immediately pierced through the ground, but the crisp sound that should have appeared when the array hole was broken did not appear.Xiang Nan frowned. \"Did you really calculate wrongly? Looks like the formation here is not a Phantasm Lost Formation. Let's change it to another one.\"Time passed bit by bit.Ninety-nine percent of the people on the flying ship couldn't understand what Xiang Nan was doing.Only the messengers of the six great sects knew that Xiang Nan was trying to break the formation, but they didn't dare to say it out loud! Everyone knew that Wang Xiaoyun was in charge of passageways 250 to 300! The formation that trapped Xiang Nan was definitely created by Wang Xiaoyun.City Lord Hong Zhen also noticed that something was wrong. He leaned over to Elder Yue and whispered, \"I'm a martial artist. I don't know much about formations. May I ask if Xiang Nan is trying to break the formation?\"Elder Yue gave Hong Zhen a look of secrecy, but sighed.\"Is it really a formation?\" Hong Zhen was stunned. Elder Yue's reaction had already explained the problem.Hong Zhen angrily clenched his fists. He grabbed Wang Xiaoyun's collar and angrily said, \"You've gone too far! You actually used formations against Xiantian realm martial artists!\"However, Wang Xiaoyun was neither salty nor indifferent. He said, \"Let go of me and pay attention to your attitude. I am the messenger of Chihuo Sect.\"\"Also, what evidence do you have that Xiang Nan is trapped by the formation?\"Hong Zhen was furious, but he didn't know how to refute it.Wang Xiaoyun said, \"Ten thousand steps back, even if Xiang Nan is really trapped by the formation, what evidence do you have to say that it was the formation I set up?\"\"There are more than ten million experts who have come to Black Sharp Demon Forest. Perhaps it is the formation left behind by our predecessors.\"Hong Zhen was even more speechless.Wang Xiaoyun slapped Hong Zhen's right hand away and said, \"City Lord, be careful what you say in the future. You can't afford to slander Chihuo Sect if you slander me.\"Wang Xiaoyun, what a villain! Hong Zhen had thoroughly comprehended this point.At this moment, everyone's gaze towards Wang Xiaoyun was no longer just filled with admiration, but deep fear!To offend such a vindictive villain was truly a disaster that could never be recovered.Right below.Xiang Nan had tried ten different ways to break the formation, but all of them failed!It was already the sixteenth hour. All 299 contestants had passed the first exam hall. Thirty of them died in the second exam hall and 269 entered the third exam hall.A new battle had already begun in the third exam hall. Mo Hai and Cai Jianyun's two teams could be said to be unimpeded in the third exam hall!When all the contestants saw these two teams, they could only walk around. They prayed in their hearts that they must not become the targets of those two teams.As for Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei, they didn't even dare to show their faces. Without Xiang Nan's protection, the two of them did their best to hide themselves and never dared to appear.\"Hahahaha!\" Cai Jianyun led ten experts around the complex jungle of the third examination hall. He shouted, \"Xiang Clan bastards, get out of here!\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun was holding a martial artist who had been beaten half to death in his hand, while in his other hand, he was holding the martial artist's bloodstained name tag.On the other side, Mo Hai's team also walked over, and the two teams met.\"Jianyun, how many points do you have?\" Mo Hai asked.Cai Jianyun smiled and said, \"With this in hand, I just killed ten of them! Five famous brands were distributed to my brothers. I asked for five of them myself, and now I have fifteen points.\"\"Please \u2026 take my life \u2026 You've already taken my name tag \u2026 Take it away.\" The martial artist who was pinched by Cai Jianyun had a pleading expression on his face.Cai Jianyun smiled coldly and said, \"You are trash. What's the point of trash living? Rather than being humiliated, it's better for me to give you a ride. Don't step into martial arts in your next life. You're not worthy.\"With that, Cai Jianyun held onto his sword and pierced through the martial artist's throat amidst his pleading!On the other side, Wang Jingyun, who was beside Mo Hai, frowned slightly.\"Yes, I just won eight famous brands here.\" Mo Hai smiled. There were only five experts beside him, five fewer than Cai Jianyun.Cai Jianyun shrugged his shoulders, \"Xiang Nan isn't here, it's boring.\"Huang Tianyu, who was beside Cai Jianyun, subconsciously shrank his neck when he mentioned the word Xiang Nan. He was already scared by Xiang Nan.The two teams met and tacitly brushed past each other without interfering.The first examination room, the 300th passageway.It was already the seventeenth hour, and Xiang Nan had tried five more formations, but all of them failed!The spectators on the airship had completely abandoned Xiang Nan in their hearts, believing that it was impossible for Xiang Nan to enter the second examination hall.City Lord Hong Zhen also felt helpless, but he didn't know how to vent his anger.Xiang Nan stood there in a daze and gritted his teeth. \"Could it be that I was trapped by Wang Xiaoyun just like that?\"\"It's a pity that I didn't learn the Thunder King Seal's Thunder Array. Otherwise, I would have smashed this place into pieces and destroyed the array automatically.\"\"Huh?\" Speaking of the Thunder King Seal, Xiang Nan suddenly thought of something!The formation itself was made up of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. After absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the martial artist condensed it in his dantian.There was a move in the Lightning King Seal called the Lightning Photoelectric Eye. It could see the fluctuations of the weather and Yuan Qi intuitively, so could one also see the Spiritual Qi?Xiang Nan was shocked. He immediately flicked the black saber three times, then refined his Qi into electricity. Both of his hands were covered with a layer of electric arcs.The two hands interweaved lightning arcs and collided several times in midair, forming a seal. Then, they used their index and middle fingers to wipe their eyes.Lightning flashed in both of his eyes.Xiang Nan looked ahead and saw that there were two areas on the ground in front of him.

He shouted in shock, \"Lightning Photovoltaic Eye actually has such a use?\"Turning around, behind him on the left, was the third array eye!He was even more focused, and between the three array eyes, a faint meridian path could be seen.Formation Diagram! Xiang Nan's heartbeat was getting faster and faster. Not only did he see the array eye, he could also clearly see the direction of the array diagram's meridians.In this way, one could clearly distinguish which was the first needle eye and which was the second and third array eye!Xiang Nan was overjoyed. He raised his head and looked at the flying ship. He thought to himself, Wang Xiaoyun, Wang Xiaoyun, you want to stop me!Thinking of this, Xiang Nan didn't dare to delay any longer. He pulled out his giant saber and rushed to the first array eye. The giant saber stabbed down, and with a crisp sound, the first array eye broke!Immediately after, the second and third formation eyes were easily broken by Xiang Nan.On the flying ship, Wang Xiaoyun was dumbfounded as he watched this scene. He simply couldn't believe his eyes.\"Senior Brother Xiaoyun!\" The junior apprentice-brother beside him cried out in shock.\"Shut up!\" The veins on Wang Xiaoyun's forehead bulged out, and his eyes were almost bleeding.He hates Xiang Nan! Hate to the bone! He hated them to the depths of his soul!This kind of hatred did not only come from the grudges between the two families, but also because Xiang Nan was stronger than Wang Xiaoyun!Not long after Wang Xiaoyun entered Chihuo Sect, he was discovered by the sect elders and nurtured.Wang Xiaoyun had always been proud of this because the formation was too profound and profound. A martial artist's energy was limited. If he wanted to cultivate the formation while practicing martial arts, it would be difficult for him to achieve anything before he was 40 years old.But Wang Xiao Yunxing! He hadn't even reached the age of twenty-five when he had already found the path to the formation. With astonishing attainments, he had become the youngest person to enter the Chihuo Sect .But today, it only took Xiang Nan nine hours to break Wang Xiaoyun's lost array!If Wang Xiaoyun knew that Xiang Nan had actually broken the formation in less than a minute, he would probably be so angry that he would go crazy on the spot.The messengers of the other five sects looked at each other and felt inexplicable horror in their hearts!They really couldn't understand how Xiang Nan, who was sixteen years old, could break through the formation! Even though it was only the most basic of all the formations, it was only the most basic lost formation.At this moment, the third examination room.\"Sh*t! I've been discovered!\" Xiang Zhonghua, who was hiding in the jungle, saw Cai Jianyun through the cracks in the trees!\"Xiang Fei, run!\" Xiang Zhonghua held Xiang Fei's hand and ran wildly.At this moment, how could these two Xiang Family members have the time to seize other people's famous brands? It would be good if they could save their lives.Unfortunately, Cai Jianyun also saw Xiang Zhonghua.\"Xiang Clan bastard, what are you running from!\" Cai Jianyun was so excited that he almost went crazy. His eyeballs were bloodshot, and he surpassed Xiang Zhonghua with a slash.Xiang Zhonghua hurriedly counterattacked. Cai Jianyun sneered and smashed Xiang Zhonghua's spear down with his sword!\"Xiang Clan's bastard!\" Cai Jianyun grabbed Xiang Zhonghua's neck with one hand and said fiercely, \"It's so hard for me to find him.\"\"Xiang \u2026 Xiang Fei \u2026 escape \u2026\" Xiang Zhonghua's face turned red from being pinched and he kicked and beat Cai Jianyun. However, his sixth level of Origin Return was a joke in front of Cai Jianyun's ninth level of Origin Return.\"Run? Not a single one of them can escape!\" Cai Jianyun waved his eyes, and Huang Tianyu rushed out with a whoosh, directly stepping on Xiang Fei's head on the ground.Cai Jianyun looked up and laughed, \"Xiang Zhonghua, Xiang Zhonghua, I caught you! Let's see who else can save you this time!\"\"I will slowly torture you. You'd better hope that Xiang Nan can rush over as soon as possible and dare to kill you before I torture you to death!\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun swung his sword down, cutting off Xiang Zhonghua's left ear.The first examination room.Xiang Nan's heart skipped a beat and he had a bad premonition.\"Could it be that something happened to Zhong Hua and the others?\" After all, Xiang Nan and Xiang Zhonghua's blood was thicker than water. Especially in this kind of place, there was a slight sign of danger.\"It's broken! It's broken! Something must have happened!\"Xiang Nan didn't care about anything. He immediately sprinted wildly. In a manner that didn't care about the cost, he fiercely consumed his previous weather in exchange for faster speed.\"Zhong Hua, Sister Fei, you must not die. You must wait for me!\"Even though Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei entered the third examination hall at the fourteenth hour, they had already stayed in the third examination hall for three hours!Xiang Nan couldn't imagine whether Cai Jianyun's hatred for him had already killed Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei.Xiang Nan's heart was burning with excitement. His speed had already surpassed his usual limit, and the scenery on both sides was rapidly retreating.At this moment, he had only just passed the first exam hall, two-thirds of the way!\"Hurry! Hurry! I want to be faster! One minute later, Zhong Hua and Sister Fei will face a life and death crisis!\"Xiang Nan ran to his maximum speed, but he still felt that it wasn't enough! Even if he didn't run into a demonic beast at this speed, it would still take him nearly an hour to reach the second examination hall.The first exam hall wasn't too long. Everyone wasted their time in the first exam hall because they had to fight against demonic beasts.However, since it was already the last third of the journey, Xiang Nan did not hold back and displayed all of his speed.However, he still felt that it wasn't fast enough!\"Go all out!\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and flicked his left hand on the black saber three times in a row. Following three crisp collisions, he refined his Qi into lightning and directly injected lightning into his legs, replacing the previous weather!At this moment, dense lightning covered Xiang Nan's legs, and the speed at which his legs were replaced instantly soared to an unbelievable height!Everyone on the flying ship saw that Xiang Nan, who was already running at full speed, had instantly soared in speed, and with a whoosh, he turned into a ray of light and rushed out.And after Xiang Nan's legs, he actually ran out a lightning tail that was about half a meter long!Xiang Nan's feet landed on the ground. Every time he landed, he leaned forward and rushed seven or eight meters away! The speed at which his legs alternated had already turned into a phantom!Every second, his legs could be rotated thirty times! It was more than two hundred meters.This speed was already close to catching up with the 500-meter-per-second Flash Step, half of it!\"So fast!\" The spectators on the airship had already exploded!Quick! Quick! Quick! !Xiang Nan ignored the cost and burned his own weather. Charge! Charge!He's faster than the wind! Even the dense green grass on the ground bent over! His speed was sharper than a knife! Even the fallen leaves on the ancient trees on both sides were swept down by the strong wind, sweeping into a horizontal tornado, hanging far behind Xiang Nan.He no longer cared about anything, he directly placed the giant saber in front of him, not even dodging the obstacles, one towering ancient tree after another was sliced at the waist!Wherever Xiang Nan passed, large trees were sliced into pieces, and large flocks of birds were sent flying!Liked it?

It only took Xiang Nan a minute before he rushed out a full twelve li!This speed was five times faster than expected!However, his previous weather was burning too fast!\"I still have two-thirds of the weather left! Two-thirds left!\" Xiang Nan sprinted forward. He immediately took out a low-grade spirit stone and stuffed it into his mouth!Spirit stones weren't meant to be eaten at all, but Xiang Nan didn't care about that much anymore. He directly crushed the spirit stones with the power of thunder and lightning, accelerating the absorption of spiritual energy.As he frantically absorbed the spiritual energy, he spat out the dried spirit stone fragments one by one.His early days were burning, and at the same time, he was desperately absorbing spirit stones.Two minutes passed! Xiang Nan had advanced twenty-four miles.Three minutes, four minutes, five minutesXiang Nan's long hair fluttered about, and the trees in his field of vision were rapidly retreating. They retreated too quickly, turning into blurry shadows.The cold wind could only howl in vain in front of Xiang Nan.\"Chi!\" In the opposite sky, a forest vulture appeared. It was an eagle demonic beast. It was at the 1st level of the Origin Reversion Stage.After the forest vulture spread its wings, its wings were ten meters long! It soared over and dived towards Xiang Nan.\"Get lost!\"Xiang Nan swung his greatsaber and a fierce dragon waved its tail! Facing the dangers of his relatives, Xiang Nan did not hold back any longer. This saber dragon's tail was actually released by lightning.The saber energy turned into saber light! Coupled with his frantic speed, the Great Circle Blade Light turned into a ray of light at an astonishing speed!Light flashed in the sky, and the forest vulture at the first level of Origin Return was silently sliced into two halves in midair.\"Whoosh!\"\"One saber! He only used one saber to kill the forest vulture at the 1st level of the Origin Realm!\"The people on the flying ship cried out in alarm.\"Is this Xiang Nan's true strength?\"\"So strong!\"The third examination room.\"Hahahaha!\" Cai Jianyun fiercely grabbed Xiang Zhonghua's hair. His eyes were red and he smiled ruthlessly, \"Aren't you people surnamed Xiang crazy? Show me if you're crazy!\"\"That Xiang Nan, who only knows how to eat soft food, actually let a woman from the Huangpu Aristocrat Clan dismiss my grandfather's position as an elder of the Blue Stone Merchant Guild!\"\"Your Xiang Clan is nothing! They're just a bunch of dogs kneeling on the ground eating sh*t! How dare you rob me of women and my Cai Clan of business!\"Cai Jianyun swung his hand and slapped. The slap was extremely loud, leaving five purple fingerprints on Xiang Zhonghua's face.\"But now!\" Cai Jianyun glared at his blood-red eyes and roared, \"That bullsh*t Xiang Nan hasn't even passed the first examination yet!\"\"Are you still counting on him to save you? Stop dreaming, he will definitely die under the siege of the demonic beasts in the second examination hall!\"The more Cai Jianyun spoke, the angrier he became, and he began to roar, \"When I thought that I couldn't personally kill that bastard Xiang Nan, my anger burned!\"\"He dares to snatch women from me! Alright, I'll let him taste this today!\"With that, Cai Jianyun kicked Xiang Zhonghua in the stomach and sent him flying. Then, he threw Xiang Fei to the ground.\"Fey!\" Xiang Zhonghua was about to tear his eyelids apart as he jumped up from the ground like a madman.Huang Tianyu and another Xiantian eighth layer expert rushed forward at the same time and pressed Xiang Zhonghua heavily on the ground.Huang Tianyu licked his lips and smiled, \"Take a good look.\"Xiang Fei struggled like a madman, but Cai Jianyun tore open her robe and revealed her belly pocket.\"You are not humans! Beasts! All of you are beasts!\" Xiang Fei shouted heartlessly.Cai Jianyun had already lost his rationality. He didn't care about Xiang Fei's fight, he just forcefully tore at Xiang Fei's clothes.The people on the flying ship were dumbfounded.\"Enough!\" City Lord Hong Zhen roared angrily, \"Cai Jianyun! Stop!\"Cai Jianyun smiled sinisterly, \"No one can stop me! If they dare to enter this place, they have already made up their minds to die!\"Hong Zhen was so angry that he shivered. He turned to look at Cai Baohua and shouted, \"Old Master Cai, could it be that you are just watching your grandson do something good?\"Cai Baohua smiled coldly and turned his head away, pretending not to hear him.\"Rules are rules.\" Wang Xiaoyun played with his storage ring and said, \"No one has the right to interfere with the contestant, even if the contestant is doing something that is unacceptable to heaven.\"\"Bastard!\" Hong Zhen roared at the sky, but he was powerless to return to the sky.Just as Cai Jianyun was about to tear apart Xiang Fei's last personal garment\"Stop!\" A cold shout came from the other side.Cai Jianyun paused for a moment, then raised his head to look, only to see Mo Hai and the others coming over.\"What? Do you want to protect the Xiang family?\" Cai Jianyun stared at Mo Hai.Even Mo Hai was shocked by Cai Jianyun's expression. Cai Jianyun's current situation was no longer human, and he had completely fallen into a state of madness.Mo Hai frowned and said, \"Cai Jianyun, you can't kill without nodding your head. You are indeed going too far in doing so.\"\"What if I have to do it?\" The veins on Cai Jianyun's neck twitched.Mo Hai also had someone he liked, Wang Jingyun. At this moment, Wang Jingyun was standing beside him.Facing Cai Jianyun's actions at this moment, Mo Hai really couldn't remain indifferent. He could only sigh and say, \"Jianyun, I don't like the Xiang Family either, but you have to think about it. Right now, the messengers of the major sects are watching you.\"\"If you go too far, even if you can get a good result, which sect would dare to ask for you?\"These words truly made Cai Jianyun fearful.Cai Jianyun suddenly calmed down a lot. He gritted his teeth and casually pulled out two daggers. He stabbed them into Xiang Fei's left and right shoulders and nailed Xiang Fei to the ground.Xiang Fei trembled in pain, but she didn't let out a single scream. She just glared at Cai Jianyun with hatred, as if she wanted to peel him alive.\"Sister, when did we start pleading for the Xiang family?\" A person beside him said coldly.Cai Jianyun was not the only one who hated Xiang Nan. Wang Jinghai was also the one who was speaking!\"Brother Jianyun, how about handing Xiang Zhonghua over to me?\" Wang Jinghai walked up with his sword in hand.Cai Jianyun was stunned and immediately laughed, \"Good job, Jing Hai! He's much stronger than your sister and the others! That's what men should do. If you have a grudge, you can't take revenge on a gentleman!\" Cai Jianyun laughed loudly.The two people from the Xiang Clan were lying on the ground alone and helpless, like two injured little beasts, allowing the two groups of wild beasts to mercilessly bite them.On the other side, the first examination room, the 300th passageway.Xiang Nan sprinted through the first examination hall and arrived at the second examination hall!At this moment, ninety-nine Xiantian fifth level demonic beasts had been unlocked in the second examination room.Xiang Nan stepped on the lightning and descended from the sky! Like a meteor, it heavily bombarded the center of the dense army of demonic beasts!Lightning shot out in all directions, spreading out into a sea of lightning!Ninety-nine demonic beasts were sent flying in a circular radius.Liked it?

All of them were hugging their shoulders to watch the show. Xiang Zhonghua lowered his head and knelt in front of everyone.Xiang Zhonghua's eyes almost spat out fire. He swayed and stood up again, even though his leg bones were about to be kicked off.\"I'll make you kneel!\" Wang Jinghai walked up and slammed his knee into Xiang Zhonghua's chin, causing his eyes to turn pale and his mouth to spit out white foam.At any time, Wang Jinghai kicked Xiang Zhonghua and said, \"This is the fate of your Xiang family! You should kneel down and face us honestly!\"\"Bullsh*t!\" Xiang Zhonghua roared, his hands holding onto the Xiang Family Spear, and he forced himself to stand up again.Xiang Zhonghua stared at Wang Jingyun and gritted his teeth, \"Jingyun! Even if you don't have the slightest bit of love for me, you shouldn't let me be humiliated like this in your old relationship. Give me a good one and kill me with a single knife!\"Xiang Zhonghua was humiliated the most in his life, and he was humiliated in front of Wang Jingyun.\"Oh?\" Cai Jianyun was stunned and said, \"Jingyun? Oh, right, I almost forgot if you didn't tell me!\"Cai Jianyun laughed, \"I remember that a few years ago, you seemed to have an unsuccessful engagement with Jing Yun, right?\"\"Oh\" Everyone suddenly realized and recalled.Many years ago, when the Xiang Clan was once glorious, the Wang Clan betrothed Wang Jingyun to the Xiang Clan's Grand Elder's grandson, Xiang Zhonghua, in order to curry favor with the Xiang Clan.But then the Xiang Clan declined, so this matter was not settled, and Wang Jingyun also threw herself into Mo Hai's embrace.Li Qingchuan patted his forehead and said, \"I said, how could Big Brother Mo Hai get angry when he was in Welcome Street?\" Obviously, Jing Yun was only speaking to Xiang Nan with a pleasant expression.\"In retrospect, Brother Mo Hai should be worried that Jing Yun's old love for Xiang Zhonghua would reignite, so he spoke so kindly to Xiang Nan, right?\"Everyone thought that Mo Hai treated Xiang Nan as his love rival, but in fact, they thought that Xiang Zhonghua was the reason!After all, the verbal engagement between Xiang Zhonghua and Jing Yun was too early. At that time, everyone was still young and could not remember clearly. Later, when the Wang Clan had a feud with the Xiang Clan, everyone forgot about the existence of the verbal engagement.However, Wang Jingyun's expression was complicated. She looked at Xiang Zhonghua and said, \"Zhonghua, although you and I had an old relationship, that's already the past.\"\"But now \u2026 even if I read a little bit about my old relationship with you, I still can't help you \u2026\"As she said this, Wang Jingyun turned to look at Mo Hai. That meant that if I pleaded for mercy for Xiang Zhonghua, Mo Hai would definitely be jealous.Xiang Zhonghua smiled miserably and had nothing to say.All I wanted was a knife, but you, Wang Jingyun, made me refuse to even give a damn if I died so happily.\"You're still laughing?\" Cai Jianyun smiled and walked behind Xiang Zhonghua. He stretched out his hand and directly grabbed Xiang Zhonghua's neck. \"What right do you have to laugh? Kneel down and kowtow to us three times. I'll let you die a happy death.\"Xiang Zhonghua was indifferent and would never kneel.Cai Jianyun's right hand suddenly dug in! He grabbed the bone seam on the back of Xiang Zhonghua's neck! With the strength in his hand, Xiang Zhonghua's expression changed drastically!It was a kind of pain! The pain of losing heart and splitting lungs! The pain was like burning flames burning the body, and the soul was fiercely whipped!Xiang Zhonghua's painful eyes kept rolling upwards. Blood and tears flowed out from the corners of his eyes, and his entire body started to spasm.\"Does it hurt?\" Cai Jianyun still maintained a smile, \"If it hurts, kneel down and kowtow. I will immediately let go.\"Xiang Zhonghua was so painful that he couldn't even say anything, and his mouth was constantly bubbling with white foam.When everyone saw this scene, they all grinned and felt their scalps go numb. When Cai Jianyun did this, he actually had a smile on his face!\"Kneel down and kowtow.\" Cai Jianyun smiled and increased his strength.Xiang Zhonghua was already in so much pain that he wanted to commit suicide, but the back of his neck was pinched, and he couldn't even use his strength to move. However, this torture method made Xiang Zhonghua unable to faint.Xiang Zhong Hua's face was already completely devoid of blood. His mouth was wide open, and his throat was chuckling, chuckling, chuckling, chuckling, chuckling, chuckling, chuckling, chuckling.Seeing that Xiang Zhonghua was still unwilling to kneel, Cai Jianyun's strength increased again!This time, the inhuman pain caused Xiang Zhonghua's body to tremble violently. His body started to flee. This was completely unconscious behavior. It was an unconscious spasm caused by the intense pain.Wang Jinghai widened his eyes and said, \"Wow, it turns out that a person's pain has reached its limit. This is how he behaved.\"\"There's something even better.\" Cai Jianyun smiled sinisterly as he pinched the back of Xiang Zhonghua's neck with his left hand and pressed his right elbow against Xiang Zhonghua's spine!This time, Xiang Zhonghua rolled his eyes and spat out white foam. His entire body vigorously shook. His legs and arms actually cramped, and began to twist at a strange angle! The shape of the human body was almost out of the human domain.However, he still didn't kneel.The second examination room.Xiang Nan's heart was beating wildly, and he felt the pain of being stabbed by a needle!\"Zhong Hua, this is Zhong Hua!\" Xiang Nan was about to go crazy. Those damned demonic beasts had killed a bunch of them and came out one after another.At this moment, Xiang Nan had just inserted his brand into the lion's head when more new demonic beasts pounced on him! At this time, the number of demonic beasts had already reached a total of 100.\"No, I can't care about that much!\" Xiang Nan was ruthless. He took out his famous brand and flicked it three times on the black blade!Immediately after, his hands formed seals.Pu!He spat out a mouthful of the weather first, and the Thunder King Seal was formed with great lightning!The lightning ball rolled bigger and bigger, engulfing all the demonic beasts in front of it!Hao Lightning had its own damage. Although it wasn't high, dealing with this group of demonic beasts was already enough.A bolt of lightning not only slowed the demonic beasts down, but also severely injured them, especially keeping them on the verge of death. New demonic beasts would not be able to enter.However, Xiang Nan had already used up all of the two spirit stones in his previous frantic sprint. This bolt of lightning had almost emptied out all of Xiang Nan's previous weather.He inserted one hand into the lion's head to recharge the famous brand, while brandishing his saber with the other hand to drive away the half-dead demonic beasts.As such, time passed bit by bit.Xiang Nan had used up the last of the weather to attack the demonic beasts at the expense of Hao Lightning. Finally, it was filled with famous brands!\"Sh*t! Zhong Hua seems to be dying!\" Xiang Nan didn't know why he felt so strongly about Xiang Zhonghua today. Perhaps his relatives would have such an inexplicable feeling before they passed away.However, he could no longer care about it. His body turned into a gust of wind and rushed out, inserting the name plate into the light wall of the third examination hall.The wall of light finally rumbled open.The spectators who saw this scene almost cheered loudly!Xiang Nan is here! He really passed through the uncrossable Origin Returning Passage and went to the third examination hall!\"Beautiful!\" Elder Yue suddenly waved his fist.Liked it?

With his strength, he shouldn't have come so late.\"Cai Jianyun laughed excitedly, \"It's good that I didn't die! I just happened to kill him myself, so that I can avenge him!\"At the entrance of the third exam hall, Xiang Nan flew like flying. He quickly muttered, \"Zhong Hua, Sister Fei, you must wait for me. Don't die!\"But looking around, the environment of the third examination hall was extremely complicated. It was a mountainous area with overlapping mountains.There were mountains, rivers, and forest canyons here, and towering trees pierced into the clouds. It was as difficult to find a person with the naked eye in such a place as this!Xiang Nan's first action was to point at the tree. He sprinted all the way to the top of the tree. Then, he soared into the sky and quickly swept his eyes in all directions.It was a pity that the trees were dense. Looking down from a high place, one could see tree trunks and vast forests. No one could be seen at all.At this moment, Xiang Zhonghua and the others were in a large open space in a gorge, surrounded by tall green mountains on both sides.\"Since Xiang Nan is here, then this trash is useless.\" Cai Jianyun lost interest in Xiang Zhonghua and finally let go of his cruel right hand.Xiang Zhonghua fell to the ground with a loud slap, his mouth wide open.\"Zhong Hua! Zhong Hua, how are you?\" Xiang Fei was nailed to the ground not far away by a pair of daggers. She shouted at Xiang Zhonghua with all her might, but Xiang Zhonghua was already in a blurry state of consciousness and did not respond.Seeing that Cai Jianyun was about to cut off Xiang Zhonghua's head with a single sword strike, Mo Hai shook his head and said, \"Rather than us and Xiang Nan searching for each other, why don't we let this Zhonghua help us?\"\"Oh? I understand what you mean.\" Cai Jianyun smiled. He bent down and poured the weather into his index finger. Then, his index finger heavily stabbed at Xiang Zhonghua's third spine.\"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!\"The intense pain caused Xiang Zhonghua's miserable scream to pierce through the clouds.\"Zhong Hua!\" Xiang Nan immediately locked onto Xiang Zhonghua's position. He landed back on the treetop from midair. He pointed at the treetop with his toes and rushed out diagonally. Then, he pointed at another tree with his toes and rushed again.He kept jumping and shuttling between the trees. In less than ten minutes, he arrived at the canyon.When Xiang Nan saw the scene below from a high place, he was so furious that his eyelids were about to split apart!Both Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai's teams were hugging their shoulders as they watched the show. In the middle of the two teams was Xiang Zhonghua, who was lying half dead in the blood, and Xiang Fei, who was nailed to the ground by the dagger.\"Is he finally here?\" Cai Jianyun also saw Xiang Nan. He raised his sword and said, \"Xiang Nan, I want you to see with your own eyes how I killed your Xiang Clan's bastards like a beast!\"With that, Cai Jianyun's sword slashed down towards Xiang Zhonghua's neck.\"Zhong Hua!\" Xiang Nan's eyes were almost bleeding!However, he was still a distance away from Xiang Zhonghua in mid-air, so he couldn't save Xiang Zhonghua in time.At this critical moment, Xiang Nan didn't care about anything else. He immediately flicked the giant saber three times and his fingers were wrapped in lightning.\"Thunder King Seal, Tyrannical Lightning Body!\"With the success of the Tyrannical Lightning Body Palm, the lightning energy in Xiang Nan's body instantly exploded. This was the only martial skill that Xiang Nan could unleash at the fastest speed without expending any of his previous weather.The tyrannical lightning body caused Xiang Nan's entire body to be wrapped in lightning. He angrily rushed down from the sky, borrowing the power of the fall, as well as the speed at which his feet shot into the air.For a moment, Xiang Nan turned into a rolling \"lightning meteorite\" with a long tail of lightning behind him.Because of his ferocious momentum, the air was torn apart, and there was a howl in the sky that was like the cry of a ghost.\"Jianyun! Get out of the way!\" Mo Hai raised his head and looked at the way Xiang Nan descended with shock in his eyes. His entire heart was beating wildly.\"What?\" Cai Jianyun's sword was already halfway down, and he subconsciously raised his head to take a look.In the sky, Xiang Nan was less than a hundred meters away from the ground! His terrifying power was nine times stronger than before, and when he charged to this distance, even a hundred meters away from the ground, a strong wind pressure was created.A hundred meters away, before Xiang Nan arrived, the wind pressure had arrived! Everyone below could feel the oppressive force descending from the sky. The gale caused their bodies to shake and they were almost unable to stand firmly.\"What kind of damn martial skill is this!\" Cai Jianyun's pupils contracted. If he killed Xiang Zhonghua again, he would definitely have time to kill him, but he wouldn't be able to escape.Cai Jianyun didn't care about killing anymore and hurriedly jumped backwards.Everyone else turned around and fled, intending to leave the scene quickly.Xiang Nan was like a meteor! It directly exploded into the crowd and landed between Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei.This sprint could be said to be the strongest in Xiang Nan's history!Nine times the strength of 23,400 jin, coupled with the terrifying inertia carried by the charge from top to bottom, caused the strength of Xiang Nan's charge to soar to over 30,000 jin!Boom!It was like a meteor hitting the ground.This charge was actually within a radius of three kilometers. The ground instantly collapsed into pieces and shot into the sky like a blowout.Trees, flowers, and rocks were all unable to escape their doom! Countless things were blown into the sky, and before they could reach the highest point, they were shredded into pieces.\"Heavens\" Cai Jianyun and the others had already fled for nearly a hundred meters. They had originally thought that they would enter a safe area like this.But when he turned around and saw the spectacular scene Xiang Nan had created the moment he landed on the ground, he knew that he was thinking too much.Even before Cai Jianyun could utter the last word of his exclamation, his entire body was engulfed by the roaring waves!At the same time that Xiang Nan landed, he used the Shadow Steps to protect Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei, saving their lives.This time, the spectators were no longer the only ones on the flying ship in the sky.Even the sect envoys who were accustomed to seeing the big scenes were dumbfounded.Liked it?

However, his body was still retreating, and he felt as if it would be torn apart in the next second.This air shield only lasted for a second before collapsing!\"Damn it, what the hell is this!\" Cai Jianyun roared and immediately erected a second air shield.Within a second, the second air shield was also shattered. He used up a lot of energy to build the third air shield, but it was still shattered!For a moment, Cai Jianyun was already in despair. He thought that he couldn't escape this misfortune, but just as he was about to rush to the Yellow Springs, the terrifying shockwave stopped. Only the gale was still howling.The shockwave that Xiang Nan used to charge into the ground was the strongest. This kind of shockwave naturally came and went as quickly as it could when it touched the ground.In the other directions, Mo Hai and the others had almost the same experience as Cai Jianyun.However, apart from Mo Hai and Cai Jianyun, the others were more or less injured to varying degrees.So much so that Mo Hai froze on the spot and looked at the mountain rocks and tree fragments flying wildly in the sky. He couldn't help but be shocked and say in his heart, If Xiang Nan's charge this time wasn't on the ground, but on us, then the consequences would be\u2026Thinking of this, Mo Hai's forehead was already covered in sweat.On the other side, after Xiang Nan landed on the ground, he immediately disbanded the Tyrant Lightning Body. This move could only last for five seconds in the provincial state.At this moment, Xiang Nan had exhausted all of his energy, and his remaining strength could only last for three seconds. Therefore, he wisely chose to conserve his strength. This time, he only used one second to conserve his Tyrannical Thunder Body.At the same time, it also meant that less than half of Xiang Nan's strength was left.\"Zhong Hua, Sister Fei, are you alright?\" Xiang Nan was both angry and happy. What he was angry about was what Cai Jianyun and the others had done to Zhong Hua and Sister Fei.Fortunately, he had saved two Rejuvenation Pills earlier, so he wasn't willing to eat them! Xiang Nan immediately fed the two of them a Spring Restoration Pill. Only then did he let out a sigh of relief in his heart.No matter what, Zhong Hua and Sister Fei were saved!Looking at the scene again, there were originally some trees standing on this large flat ground, but at this moment, they were blasted into a real flat ground by Xiang Nan.Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai's team probed from two different directions and gathered together halfway.\"This\" The corner of Cai Jianyun's eyes twitched. He looked at Xiang Nan from afar and said in fear, \"Why is his strength at this level? What the hell are we talking about? All of us, run for your life.\"The others' faces were also pale. They truly did not have the courage to endure such a terrifying charge from Xiang Nan.\"Don't panic.\" Mo Hai remained calm. He looked at Xiang Nan in the distance and analyzed, \"Feel that his aura has greatly declined.\"\"In that charge just now, I suspect that he ate some kind of pill that burned his strength, or directly burned his own dantian.\"\"That's right!\" Cai Jianyun's expression suddenly relaxed a lot, \"You really said that!\"Xiang Nan held Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei in both hands and said anxiously, \"Why are there only the two of you? Where are the other brothers and sisters?\"After Xiang Zhonghua ate the Spring Recovery Pill, his body was recovering quickly. He could barely speak, so he gasped for breath and said, \"Relax \u2026 Don't worry, Xiang Fei and I separated from each other earlier so that they wouldn't get into trouble.\"\"Hu \u2026 that's good.\" Xiang Nan heaved a big sigh of relief. Then, he suddenly raised his head and shot his eyes at the enemy in the distance. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Zhong Hua, Sister Fei, you guys wait. I'll go take revenge for you.\"Xiang Zhonghua grabbed Xiang Nan's arm and said, \" little Nan , your health is very bad. Even I can feel it. Besides, there are a total of seventeen experts here. You only have one.\"Xiang Fei also said, \"I want revenge more than anyone else, but little Nan , you can't die! Don't be impulsive.\"It was good that they didn't say those words. Xiang Nan watched the two of them being tortured to such a horrible state and they were still worried about him. He was very moved, but this kind of emotion immediately turned into anger.Xiang Nan shook his head and said in a low voice, \"What's the harm of dying! It's better to die in a clean battle than to live in seclusion!\"After saying that, Xiang Nan ignored the two's persuasion and picked up the huge saber and walked towards the enemy. At the same time, he stuffed the Demon Origin Fruit he had accumulated into his mouth and swallowed it after a mouthful of random chewing.As such, Xiang Nan's strength and weather had begun to recover. However, the Demon Origin Fruit was not a medicinal pill after all. Its medicinal properties lasted much longer than the medicinal pills. However, the medicinal properties that erupted in an instant were only half of the medicinal pills.Xiang Nan's face was gloomy as he walked towards his enemies step by step. The blade of the giant saber was dragged onto the ragged ground, making a sizzling sound of friction.\"All of you \u2026 deserve to die.\" Xiang Nan gritted his teeth.\"Hahaha, boast!\" Cai Jianyun regained his courage and mocked, \"You don't even look at what you're like right now! With your half-dead state, you actually dare to speak crazily!\"Huang Tianyu hid behind Cai Jianyun and said sinisterly, \"Xiang Nan has a lot of strange moves. Just in case, let's go together with the seventeen experts! Don't worry about face now.\"\"That's right, that's what I think.\" Hearing Huang Tianyu's words, Cai Jianyun put on an expression that deeply touched my heart and asked Mo Hai with his eyes.Mo Hai nodded, \"One-on-one, it's the same as being stupid in such a place. I agree to attack Xiang Nan together.\"As soon as he finished speaking, the two teams, a total of seventeen people, all drew their weapons.Apart from Wang Jinghai and Mo Qi, the others were Xiantian eighth layer experts, while Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai were terrifying Xiantian ninth layer experts.Although Xiang Nan was furious, his mentality was very calm. The seventeen people in front of him were no ordinary demonic beasts! Rather, they were genuine experts, outstanding amongst their peers. Not only did they know martial arts techniques, they also knew very powerful martial arts techniques.\"Come with me? Just in time!\" With less than half of his strength, Xiang Nan rushed towards the enemy without hesitation.On the flying ship, the man who had once served as the chief judge of the Xiang Nan Town Election exclaimed, \"One against seventeen experts? This time, Xiang Nan is playing too risky!\"\"Yes.\" The City Lord nodded with a gloomy face, \"Furthermore, all 17 of them are at a higher realm than Xiang Nan. If Xiang Nan doesn't have a stronger trump card this time, I'm afraid it will be unlucky.\"Below.\"Brothers, go! Whoever gets Xiang Nan's head, I'll treat him to a year's worth of flower wine!\" Cai Jianyun ordered his ten subordinates to charge forward.Mo Hai also nodded to his people, \"Go! Be careful to adapt to the situation!\"The seventeen of them broke out in the early weather and charged towards Xiang Nan like a torrent.Liked it?

I, Xiang Nan, am afraid of you! Come on! Let's see who's tougher!\"Xiang Nan heavily punched his chest with his fist, and both of his hands immediately spread out.The seventeen of them all charged forward with the first wave of the weather. Although their first waves couldn't be superimposed together, their momentum was still immense when they rushed over together!On the other hand, Xiang Nan was alone. Facing a total of seventeen experts who were at a higher realm than him, he also dared to move forward and released a move of the Azure Dragon into the sea.On the other side, the seventeen experts had a mighty momentum, as if they were galloping over like thousands of horses.On this side, Xiang Nan fought alone against all the heroes, transforming into a fiery gale and greeting them without the slightest bit of fear.On the hillsides of the two green mountains on both sides of the canyon, there were already quite a few contestants who had rushed over when they heard the news. They all looked at this scene with horror on their faces. They simply did not believe that this was a battle between Xiantian realm martial artists!\"Charge!\" Mo Hai and Cai Jianyun took the lead, the weather climbing steadily.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and the veins on his forehead jumped violently.\"Bang them!\" Xiang Zhonghua barely managed to support himself. Seeing the surging scene, he could not help but clench his fists.Finally, the two sides were officially connected!\"Blue! Dragon! Out! Sea!\" Xiang Nan roared and instantly collided with the other 17 experts.Cai Jianyun desperately shouted.Boom!The two sides collided. A circular wave of air spread out in all directions. However, there were no trees or rocks protruding from the ground. The wave of air could only roll away and disperse further and further away.The collision between the two strands of weather was unprecedentedly intense.However, everyone's heartbeats were about to stop.\"Really \u2026 I can handle it!\" Someone cried out in shock, \"Look! The two sides are in a stalemate. Xiang Nan alone has managed to withstand the charge of seventeen experts!\"\"Damn it! So that move of Xiang Nan's is called the Azure Dragon Going Out to Sea. I finally heard the name of this charging martial skill!\"Indeed, when Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon went out to sea, it was suppressed by 17 experts in the middle of the field, unable to take another half step forward.However, the same was true for the seventeen experts!\"It's not possible!\" Cai Jianyun shrieked, \"Seventeen people can't beat him alone! All of you, use your full strength!\"\"Ahhh!\" The seventeen experts all roared in anger. There was still room for improvement in the weather first!As for Xiang Nan, he had already been pressed down by an even stronger oppressive force, causing his feet to slowly slide backwards on the ground. However, he was still calm, and his eyes shone with a sharp blade-like light.Xiang Nan's entire right arm bulged, his muscles wriggling. He carried a tremendous amount of strength and raised a huge saber that pierced into the ground.\"Break!\"Following Xiang Nan's words, the Azure Dragon took shape in the second half of its attack!With a long slash, a 20-meter-tall crescent-shaped saber qi soared into the sky!\"What!?! Yes?\" Cai Jianyun was going crazy! Twenty meters of saber qi! How could this be released by a Xiantian sixth layer martial artist?When Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon went out to sea, the saber Qi formed in the last half of his move was much stronger than the one released in normal conditions!Just like the charge he made when he descended from the sky, the Azure Dragon went out to sea and was strong when it was strong!This time, the Azure Dragon went out to sea to bombard 17 people! The highly intense pressure caused by the confrontation between the two sides doubled the power of the Drawing Blade Style.The Drawing Blade Style was originally the explosive force produced by the instant the blade was drawn, but under the pressure of the seventeen people, it was obvious how powerful the explosive force was!Twenty meters of saber qi! In an instant, he had knocked over seventeen of the opponent's experts!Cai Jianyun, Mo Hai, Li Qingchuan, and Wang Jingyun, the four top experts, immediately released the Xiantian Shield.The 20-meter-long saber qi smashed into the shield, causing the four of them to vomit blood one after another, but they were knocked flying towards both sides.Mo Hai grabbed his younger brother, Mo Qi, while Wang Jingyun grabbed Wang Jinghai, saving the two of them from death.However, the other eleven weren't so lucky!Although the saber qi of twenty meters was very high, it was not wide enough. It only enveloped seven of the eleven people! Four of them were slightly off position and were knocked sideways.However, the seven martial artists who were facing the saber qi didn't even let out a miserable scream. They were all annihilated by the saber qi.The saber Qi flew twenty to thirty meters away before it spread out and dissipated into the heavens and earth.\"Hu!\" Xiang Nan panted as he stabbed the huge saber into the ground and almost knelt down on one knee due to excessive strength.Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai climbed up from the ground not far from them. Their faces were filled with horror. They turned around and saw seven broken limbs scattered behind them.Xiang Nan was panting, Cai Jianyun and the others were shocked.At this moment, a panicked scream broke the silence.\"Ahhh! Monster, monster! I won't fight anymore, I still want to live!\"Run! On Cai Jianyun's side, one of the few people who could be called life brothers actually screamed and threw away their famous brands to escape for their lives.One person escaped, immediately forming a chain reaction. The other experts also escaped.This time, Cai Jianyun's face was like a vegetable, as if he had been slapped on the face by Xiang Nan, and his expression was as ugly as if he was in mourning.\"Huang Tianyu!\" Cai Jianyun quickly grabbed Huang Tianyu, who was planning to escape, and angrily said, \"Forget about the other trash escaping. Even you want to betray me?\"\"I, I I\" Huang Tianyu was so scared that his entire body trembled.\"You cowardly bastard!\" Cai Jianyun sliced off Huang Tianyu's head with his sword!The scene was completely silent.No one had expected that this would be the end result! Then Cai Jianyun was crazy enough to start killing his own people!What was even more shocking was that Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon had directly disintegrated the strongest team in the entire city selection! Leaving Cai Jianyun alone.On the other side, Mo Hai's team was relatively neat, and no one escaped.Wang Jingyun was the first to stand out. She used her hand to push Wang Jinghai and Mo Qi behind her. \"You two go and watch from afar. The battle here is far beyond your capabilities.\"\"Brother.\" Mo Qi looked at Mo Hai.Mo Hai nodded, \"Go, there's no need to feel embarrassed.\"Wang Jinghai and Mo Qi exchanged glances, stomped their feet angrily, and ran off into the distance.In the end, there were only Mo Hai, Cai Jianyun, Li Qingchuan, and Wang Jingyun left.On both sides of the mountain, all the contestants were also observing the direction of the wind. The outcome of the battle between Xiang Nan and the four of them would directly lead to the final direction of the city selection.This wasn't just a battle between Xiang Nan and his enemies, it was also a battle between other contestants who wanted to seize famous brands.Liked it?

If he could get all 42 famous brands, he would basically be first place.At this moment, Xiang Nan was panting violently. Although his physical strength and early weather had been recovering, that kind of recovery would definitely not be able to keep up with the rate of exhaustion.The current weather wasn't enough to activate the Azure Dragon's second voyage.Pa pa pa.At this moment, a burst of applause suddenly came. Everyone looked in the direction of the voice and discovered that it was actually Cai Jianyun clapping his hands.Cai Jianyun recovered from the anger he felt when he killed his friend. He smiled sinisterly and said, \"I really didn't expect that you, Xiang Nan, would have such a powerful strength. However, that's good. My opponent is strong, and I have my own face.\"\"If I kill you, I will be the person with the most fame in this Martial City!\"Mo Hai and the others frowned as they looked at Cai Jianyun. Wang Jingyun whispered, \"Jianyun, this brat is uncertain. He was so angry just now that he was like thunder. Now he can actually laugh out loud!\"Mo Hai nodded and said, \"This kind of person is very dangerous. Everyone needs to pay more attention.\"Xiang Nan looked at Cai Jianyun and didn't say a word. He was trying his best to buy more time to recover.Cai Jianyun slowly turned the sword in his hand and stared at Xiang Nan. \"You're very strong, I admit it! But do you really think you can scare me like this?\"\"Jianyun\" Mo Hai opened his mouth.\"Shut up!\" Cai Jianyun suddenly screamed again. He turned around and looked at his dead teammates and Huang Tianyu, who he had personally slaughtered.He could only imagine how high-spirited he was when he entered the city selection, but now he was left alone.Then Cai Jianyun angrily pointed at Xiang Nan, \"You made me so embarrassed! I will definitely settle this debt. If I don't kill you, Xiang Nan, I, Cai Jianyun, swear not to be human!\"Mo Hai was cursed by Cai Jianyun, and his heart was filled with anger, but looking at Cai Jianyun's current state, he swallowed his anger back.Xiang Nan coldly looked at Cai Jianyun, \"There's no need for nonsense. You tortured Zhong Hua and Sister Fei to this extent. No matter what you say, I will take your dog's life today.\"Cai Jianyun looked up and smiled, \"Do you think you are the only one hiding your trump card? I also have one!\"\"Originally, this move was used to deal with Mo Hai, but now that it has become like this, I am not stingy in using it against you.\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun took out two pills, one red and one yellow. The two pills did not have a faint fragrance, but instead had a faint blood energy.When Xiang Nan saw the two pills, he couldn't help but frown. However, the others didn't know what the two pills were for.Cai Jianyun said, \"These two are third-grade pills. One is a mad devil blood refining pill. It can double my overall strength in half an hour!\"\"The other one is called Earth Condensation Pill. Eating it will allow me to possess the attributes of the Earth Vein Innate within an hour.\"Everyone was in an uproar.The effects of the Mad Demon Blood Refining Pill were too powerful! His strength had doubled!As for Earth Condensation Pills, they were even more abnormal. They could actually allow martial artists to possess new innate attributes in a short period of time? There was actually such a pill in the world.\"Being an elder of the Chamber of Commerce is beneficial. This thing must have been obtained by his grandfather, Cai Baohua.\" Someone muttered softly.Looking at Cai Jianyun, he swallowed both of the pills and shouted, \"Today, Xiang Nan belongs to me alone! Only I can kill him! Whoever dares to stop me, I will be at odds with him!\"In order to regain face, Cai Jianyun decided to fight Xiang Nan one-on-one.As they spoke, everyone could clearly feel that Cai Jianyun's aura had started to rise crazily.Mo Hai said in a serious tone, \"Jianyun is originally a talent for ordinary water veins. In terms of protracted battles, no one can compare to him.\"\"Now that he has added a second Earth Vein attribute, he has become an invincible fortress!\"\"Haha! Hahahaha!\" Cai Jianyun raised his head, clenched his fists, and laughed even more crazily.So much so that his first weather erupted so fiercely that even his long hair fell down, and then he was danced around like a madman by the rising first weather.\"Come on, Xiang Nan! Didn't you have extraordinary offensive power? Now, let's try out my defenses!\" Cai Jianyun waved his sword and the sword made a crisp sound.The weather around the sword was more than twice as thick as before.When he walked towards Xiang Nan with his sword in hand, every step he took left a small hole in the ground!Earth Vein talent was always known for its defensive capabilities. Cai Jianyun's ninth level Xiantian realm and the strength of the Mad Demon Blood Refining Pill had led to this result.Cai Jianyun leapt up and descended from the sky with a sword!At this moment, everyone felt an indescribable pressure! Although Cai Jianyun looked tall and tall, when he landed, everyone felt as if they had seen the mountain descend from the sky!Xiang Nan had just condensed some of the previous weather, but now, he took out a portion and raised his saber to contend against Cai Jianyun!The sword qi froze on the sword body, and the saber qi froze on the saber body. At this moment, the saber and sword clashed fiercely.Clang!The swords collided with each other, making a deafening sound.Everyone cried out in alarm.Cai Jianyun's sword slashed Xiang Nan's legs into the ground! His legs went straight into his knees.Xiang Nan only felt a ten thousand jin boulder pressing down on his head, and his arms began to tremble.The key point was that Xiang Nan's cultivation base was insufficient. He had always used an explosive martial skill to kill enemies across borders. When he didn't have enough initial energy and energy to support himself, he could only rely solely on his lightning vein attribute.The power of Cai Jianyun's sword strike was something that Xiang Nan was unable to withstand under normal conditions.\"Give me another one!\" Cai Jianyun smiled sinisterly as he raised his hand and slashed down with his second sword.Xiang Nan decisively pulled out his legs and quickly retreated. At the same time, he brandished his huge saber to block Cai Jianyun's second strike.This second sword smashed into Xiang Nan's body, forcefully sending Xiang Nan flying horizontally. The giant black scale saber almost flew out of its hand.\"Hahahaha!\" Cai Jianyun laughed wildly as he continued his pursuit.As for Xiang Nan, he found an opportunity in his flying. He stepped on the ground with his right foot and suddenly made a turning point in his flying. The dense weather condensed on the blade, and he slid and swept across it.The giant saber slashed horizontally, and five meters of saber qi came out!\"Oh?\" Cai Jianyun stood upright and pushed forward with his left hand. A faint earthen yellow Xiantian Shield appeared.Xiang Nan's slash was already the strongest under normal circumstances.However, when the saber qi struck Cai Jianyun's shield, it actually collapsed! On the other hand, Cai Jianyun's Qi Shield was not weakened at all.Cai Jianyun casually talked about the dust on his shoulder and said, \"What is this? I want the Azure Dragon to go out to sea!\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Weather isn't enough first?\" Cai Jianyun smiled faintly and said, \"Do you think that because I want to regain my face, I will wait for you to slowly recover and then fight you openly?\"Xiang Nan stared fixedly at Cai Jianyun and began to retreat slowly. He knew that Cai Jianyun's temperament was changeable and he was a complete villain. He was always on guard in his heart.Cai Jianyun laughed, \"If that's what you think, then you're wrong. Who do you blame for running out of weather first? Blame yourself for not having enough cultivation realm! Why should I give in for your deficiency?\"\"You don't need the Azure Dragon to go out to sea? Then die.\"As Xiang Nan retreated, he quickly examined his own situation in his mind.If he had the chance to sit cross-legged and absorb the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, he would be able to recover to his peak state in twenty minutes with the Demon Origin Fruit.If he relied solely on the Demon Origin Fruit in battle, it would take him 40 minutes to recover to his full state.Not counting his stamina, if he only counted the consumption of the first weather, the Azure Dragon would need to consume one-tenth of his first weather for a single trip to the sea.And now, the weather in his body was gone. If he wanted to save enough time for the Azure Dragon to go out to sea, he would need to wait at least four minutes.But looking at Cai Jianyun, who was eyeing him covetously, Xiang Nan's mood became serious. This was not easy to accomplish.And he still had the power of the White Flame Lightning in his body, but this power needed to be used against Mo Hai. If it was used on Cai Jianyun, it would really cut off all of his retreat.\"Xiang Nan, die!\" Cai Jianyun crossed his sword in front of his chest and shouted, \"Come and try my Cai Clan's most proud martial skill!\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun slashed down with his sword and shouted, \"Cai Clan Sword! Break through the earth!\"Cai Jianyun slashed out a strand of sword qi, but the appearance of the sword qi was a bit strange. It was like a comb flying out. The crescent moon of the sword qi carried a pinion-like gas. With such a shape, the sword qi actually began to rotate in the midst of the flying shooting!Xiang Nan's heart skipped a beat! Ordinary sword qi was horizontal and vertical, so dodging was a little easier. As long as he dodged faster than the sword qi, it would be fine.However, this rotating sword qi rotated extremely fast and was about to turn into a hemispherical shape. Its enveloping area was much wider than ordinary sword qi.It was not enough to dodge directly. Xiang Nan directly stepped on the ground and jumped out. With such a large movement, he was able to dodge the envelope of the sword qi. The sword qi almost touched Xiang Nan's right foot.\"Your reaction is so fast!\" Wang Jingyun said curiously, \"The moment Jianyun's sword qi left, Xiang Nan had already calculated the direction and started dodging.\"Mo Hai nodded, \"That's right, most of the martial artists present are unable to react as quickly as Xiang Nan. It's very rare.\"If Xiang Nan hesitated for a moment, he would be struck by the sword qi.\"Oh?\" Cai Jianyun raised his eyebrows and said, \"Again! Break the ground!\"The second comb-shaped sword qi flew towards Xiang Nan.This time, Xiang Nan also reflected his speed. Before Cai Jianyun's sword qi could take shape, he had already determined the trajectory of the sword qi and once again dodged the sword qi with a big leap.\"Break the ground!\" Unwilling to accept it, Cai Jianyun slashed out one sword after another with the longsword in his hand.That Cai Jianyun was already a little mad, risking his life to have the support of the Mad Demon Blood Refining Pill and squandering his previous days without stingy.The sword Qi shot towards Xiang Nan one after another. The air was filled with whistling sounds of air breaking. The connection between the two sword Qi did not exceed half a second. It could be said that the speed was extremely fast.The sword Qi rushed over one after another. Even Mo Hai and the others in the distance saw that the area covered by this sword Qi \"net\" was too close. It was almost impossible for them to dodge it.What was even more serious was that it would be better to dodge ordinary sword Qi. A simple flash was enough, but facing Cai Jianyun's rotating sword Qi, he had to use a large jump to dodge it!The big move meant that more time would be wasted! However, Cai Jianyun's connection between each strand of sword Qi didn't exceed half a second. This kind of dense offensive was obviously not something that ordinary people could dodge.However, in this crisis, Xiang Nan had instead calmed down unprecedentedly. He accurately calculated the trajectory of each strand of sword energy, as well as the time difference between the other strands of sword energy arriving at his location.Xiang Nan made a big jump and jumped out horizontally.\"This is too unwise!\" Mo Hai immediately exclaimed, \"This jump is too big! Even if he dodges the first strand of sword qi, he definitely won't have time to dodge the second strand.\"However, the reality made everyone feel that it was unimaginable!Xiang Nan wasn't just hiding from the first strand of sword qi, he was also hiding from the first and second strands of sword qi! He directly jumped onto the trajectory of the third strand of sword qi.When the third strand of sword energy was about to hit Xiang Nan, Xiang Nan leapt to the right again. He made a lateral somersault and used his saber to block the ground.As a result, he dodged the third strand of sword qi, but in the process of dodging, he encountered the second strand of sword qi, and was about to collide with the second strand of sword qi.However, Xiang Nan was just a short moment away from the second strand of sword Qi! He was almost struck by the tail of the second strand of sword qi!In the eyes of others, Xiang Nan had simply collided with the second strand of sword qi! However, the slightest difference saved Xiang Nan once.Then, Xiang Nan leapt to the left again. This time, he dodged three strands of sword qi and arrived at the track of the seventh strand of sword qi. The seventh strand of sword qi was almost touching the tip of his nose. Then, he sliced the surface of the ground with his long saber and used his strength to rebound yesterday!In the eyes of others, Xiang Nan had collided with the fourth, fifth, and sixth strands of sword Qi yesterday. However, it looked like he had collided with them visually, but in reality, he was still not even a hair's breadth!This scene was too shocking! From a distance, the sword qi Cai Jianyun hacked out covered the area in a fan-shaped manner. Sou Sou Sou's frenzied shooting could only be seen with the naked eye. Light and shadows flickered past.Xiang Nanteng's jump speed was definitely slower than Sword Qi's, but he was able to shuttle back and forth through the countless streaks of light, dodging the speed of Sword Qi at a slow speed!\"My God!\"The contestants on the two mountain peaks sucked in a breath of cold air one after another! Then how precise was Xiang Nan's calculation to reach this level?To use an inappropriate description to describe what they were witnessing right now was a person walking in the rain, yet he was able to keep his entire body dry without being tainted by a single drop of rain!Although this description was too exaggerated, Xiang Nan gave everyone the feeling that it was like this!\"This brat!\" Li Qingchuan clenched his teeth and shouted, \"This is simply too terrifying! His evasion method is like an expert who has experienced hundreds of battles. Without sufficient combat experience, he would definitely not be able to do this.\"\"Mm\" Mo Hai's expression was grave, \"But this kind of combat experience, which was so rich that it could be called terrifying, appeared on this sixteen-year-old boy, Xiang Nan.\"Liked it?

Because no one would be stupid enough to go to the Profound Sky Sect to challenge Chief Disciple Bai Muchen.One of the reasons why Xiang Nan was able to do this was because he was born to practice martial arts! He was a person born for martial arts.The other was due to his god-level lightning vein attribute!Reaction, speed, and adaptability were all top notch!At first, Cai Jianyun was very pleased with himself, but now, not only did he have no choice but to feel his face burning! I just feel embarrassed!Just who was teasing who?\"Stinking bastard! You're fucking performing with me!\" Cai Jianyun was extremely furious. The weather in his body exploded, and he continued to chop the sword. However, this time, every strand of sword qi he chopped out was even greater than before!The Sword Qi from before was only three meters long, but the Sword Qi from this attack had actually reached six meters long! It directly doubled in magnitude.\"Sh*t, Jianyun is already panicking.\" Mo Hai frowned.Sure enough! Even though the area covered by the larger revolving sword qi had doubled, that meant that it would take longer to accumulate energy!Xiang Nan used a jumping distance twice as long as before in order to avoid this enormous revolving sword Qi. He was still looking for danger!However, don't forget that Xiang Nan's predicament didn't increase or decrease, but Cai Jianyun's speed of spending the first day was twice as fast as before! This was what Mo Hai was worried about.Cai Jianyun was not an idiot. He felt that his previous weather had passed quickly. He immediately realized this and abruptly retracted his sword.Xiang Nan stopped attacking with his sword Qi, and his chest rose and fell slightly, his eyes staring at Cai Jianyun.Cai Jianyun gritted his teeth and scolded, \"It really is like a troublesome monkey that jumps up and down! It seems that just using sword qi to attack you is already helpless against you. How about trying this move?\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun crossed his sword in front of his chest, and then his body arched, like a leopard ready to pounce at any moment.\"Cai Clan Sword, three consecutive strikes!\"With that, Cai Jianyun shot out like a bolt of lightning!\"En, it seems that Jianyun finally understands that only close combat can maximize his advantage.\" Mo Hai nodded in praise.Xiang Nan immediately jumped back and dodged the first strike, while Cai Jianyun suddenly turned halfway around! He drew a \"Z\" shape and attacked again!A long sword flashed past! Cai Jianyun brushed past Xiang Nan, and the blade of the sword slashed towards Xiang Nan's neck. Xiang Nan leaned back a lot. The extent of the leaning was so great that his head almost touched the ground behind him.Cai Jianyun's second strike missed, and the moment he rushed out, he immediately turned around again! This turn of events was almost equivalent to a double fold. It was a forward charge that instantly turned into a backward charge.Cai Jianyun's third strike was faster than the first two strikes, so much so that Xiang Nan had yet to recover from his big backward movement.In everyone's eyes, Xiang Nan's battle posture was too bad, it was impossible for him to dodge the third attack.Whether Xiang Nan turned his back into a backward somersault or simply jumped into the air with his feet, it was impossible for him to dodge it.However, Xiang Nan did something that no one expected. He grabbed down with both hands and directly dug into the ground. With the help of the pull-back force, he instantly lay flat on the ground.Just as Xiang Nan was lying on the ground, Cai Jianyun's sword brushed past Xiang Nan's face. A strand of Xiang Nan's long, cut hair gently flew into the sky.\"He's dodging!\" Everyone felt their scalps go numb when they saw that scene. It was truly shocking.Xiang Nan stood up from the ground, still holding the saber in his hand, not saying a word.\"I really didn't expect \u2026\" In the sky, Elder Yue praised, \"We were all focused on Xiang Nan's explosive martial skills. We were amazed at how powerful his martial skills were, but we ignored Xiang Nan's own combat skills.\"\"Yes.\" At the side, Elder Yue's senior apprentice-brother answered, \"This kind of combat skill is so skilled that it feels like Xiang Nan is someone of our generation.\"\"Dammit! Dammit!\" Cai Jianyun's three consecutive strikes failed. He roared angrily, \"Xiang Nan, you coward! What kind of man is dodging and dodging? How dare you fight me head-on!\"Xiang Nan coldly looked at Cai Jianyun. \"Do you think I'm stupid? Or are you too stupid? Fighting against you head-on? Why don't you just let me kill myself?\"\"I don't believe it! The Cai Clan Sword, three consecutive strikes!\" Cai Jianyun said angrily.Cai Jianyun once again used three consecutive strikes. This type of martial skill was extremely fast. The key was that when attacking, it had extremely astonishing turning flexibility.\"But\" Xiang Nan changed the topic and the giant saber stabbed into the ground. \"I'll help you!\"\"What!\" When everyone saw Xiang Nan's actions, they were immediately shocked! They were too familiar with Xiang Nan's starting stance! Isn't that the Azure Dragon going out to sea?Everyone had forgotten one question! Just now, Cai Jianyun and Xiang Nan were fighting too brilliantly, and time slowly passed in this kind of dangerous battle.Not only had Xiang Nan dragged on for four minutes, he had even dragged on for ten minutes! It was enough for him to activate the Azure Dragon twice!\"You!\" When Cai Jianyun saw this scene, he was stunned.Xiang Nan's saber landed on the ground and immediately charged forward! His entire body turned into a ball of fire and exploded.Three consecutive strikes against the Azure Dragon! Moreover, the two of them were charging at each other. How much impact would the two of them have this time?\"Ahhh!\" Cai Jianyun screamed in shock.Boom!The two sides collided fiercely, but although Cai Jianyun's three strikes were extremely fast, they were not charging martial skills! It's just more flexible.But when the Azure Dragon went out to sea, it was a real charge. It relied on the destructive power of the charge at that instant!The giant saber landed on the longsword. Cai Jianyun's longsword didn't even have a title for a moment before it was knocked away by Xiang Nan.On the other hand, Cai Jianyun had frantically condensed the weather and formed an air shield that was half a foot thick!Ordinary martial artists condensed a layer of Xiantian Shield that was so thin, and Cai Jianyun benefited from the blessing of Earth Element talent, allowing his defense to far exceed that of ordinary people.However, even such a frightening Xiantian Shield was unable to withstand the Azure Dragon going out to sea!The giant flaming saber pressed against the air shield, causing Cai Jianyun to continuously slide backwards. The air shield was first cracked, and then shattered with a loud sound.As for Cai Jianyun, he had already condensed the second half-foot shield and continued to resist!The second layer of shield shattered, and the third layer of Cai Jianyun had just taken shape!Xiang Nan pushed Cai Jianyun for nearly a hundred meters, and the final saber-drawing chop was about to take shape.The moment the third layer of the shield shattered, Cai Jianyun slapped his hands fiercely, and a massive amount of Xiantian energy condensed into a one foot thick shield!As for Xiang Nan's last move, the Drawing Blade Slash had also arrived!A ten-meter crescent saber qi soared into the sky! After colliding with the Chi Xu Qi Shield, the two opposed each other. The saber Qi rapidly shrunk, and the Qi Shield weakened layer by layer.In the end, when the air shield was used up to a thin layer, it shattered and the saber energy shrunk to only two meters, hitting Cai Jianyun's chest.This saber directly sent Cai Jianyun flying, causing a large amount of blood mist to fall from the sky.However, what shocked everyone was that Cai Jianyun, who had landed in the distance, had actually staggered to his feet again!Liked it?

    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 That knife is too ruthlessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe earth element's defensive power was indeed not something to be trifled with!In this confrontation between the two sides, anyone could tell that it was Xiang Nan's attack that defeated Cai Jianyun's defense.Unfortunately, Xiang Nan's saber strike was not enough to kill Cai Jianyun! The power was still a little lacking.The reason for that was because Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon had only used the Drawing Blade Style to provoke ten meters of Saber Qi this time. It was far from the twenty meters of Saber Qi he had used when he was fighting seventeen masters.\"Hehe\" In the distance, Cai Jianyun wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and staggered towards Xiang Nan. There was an oblique knife wound on his chest.The knife wound stretched from his left collarbone to his right crotch. The wound was deep and bone could be seen.Instead, Cai Jianyun laughed wildly, \"The Azure Dragon is indeed formidable, but you can't kill me! I have double my strength and earth vein defense! I am three small realms higher than you!\"Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon Saber could easily kill a first level Origin Returning demonic beast, but demonic beasts didn't know any martial arts! That's the problem.\"Hahahaha!\" Cai Jianyun looked up and laughed, \"Come on! I can still fight, you!\"As he spoke, he stuffed a Tier 1 Rejuvenation Pill into his mouth and stared straight at Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan frowned and didn't say a word. Cai Jianyun's defense was a bit troublesome. The Azure Dragon was strong when it went out to sea, but now he was only dealing with Cai Jianyun. He couldn't fully display the power of the Azure Dragon when it went out to sea.The current weather in his body allowed him to go out to sea once more, but this was still not enough to kill Cai Jianyun.\"Haha!\" Cai Jianyun held onto his sword and said as he walked, \"You can see that! You can't kill me in one move. This is your biggest problem.\"\"Xiang Nan, next time, I will let your head fall to the ground.\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun tore off his long shirt and directly naked his upper body. Then, he made a gesture that shocked everyone.That Cai Jianyun had condensed the weather at the tip of his index finger. He had actually stabbed down three places on his chest in succession! Every time he poked, his index finger would pierce through his skin and flesh, and every time he poked, Cai Jianyun's face would turn a little redder.Until Cai Jianyun's entire face and neck were as red as blood, and the veins on his forehead and neck jumped up and down, causing even his eyes to become congested with blood!It was like a furious beast.\"This is\" Everyone was shocked.'\"Self-mutilation\" Xiang Nan muttered these two words silently.The parts of his body that Cai Jianyun stabbed into could cause great pain.Pain was something that could be used. If the pain was too great, one would lose their ability to fight and even faint.If the pain was just right, it would greatly stimulate one's potential!Cai Jianyun, who had fallen into a state of madness, did not lose his mind. This time, he learned his lesson. He directly slapped his hands and condensed an air shield about a foot thick in front of him. Then, he pushed forward against the air shield and launched an attack on Xiang Nan.\"Looks like it's not enough for the Azure Dragon to go to sea?\" Xiang Nan licked his lips and rushed towards Cai Jianyun. He raised his hand and chopped down with a knife. A streak of saber energy shot out, but in the end, it brushed past Cai Jianyun's shield.\"Deviated?\" Mo Hai was stunned and frowned, \"Isn't this slash a bit too much?\"\"Cai Clan Sword, three consecutive strikes!\" Cai Jianyun shot forward, increasing his speed by a large margin, instantly arriving in front of Xiang Nan.The last time Cai Jianyun struck three times in a row, he almost hit Xiang Nan. This time, he activated his potential and his speed surpassed Xiang Nan's dodging speed.\"Let's see how you escape this time!\"Cai Jianyun roared as his sword pierced through his Qi Shield and struck Xiang Nan's throat.Xiang Nan was unable to dodge Cai Jianyun's speed, so he could only raise his saber and fight.As the two of them clashed, Cai Jianyun relied on his solid foundation in the earth veins to send Xiang Nan flying with a single sword strike.Xiang Nan felt as if he had been kicked in the chest and a stream of blood oozed out from the corner of his mouth, but he still forcefully twisted his waist as he flew backwards and slashed again.Cai Jianyun easily dodged this saber qi attack.\"Haha, your saber qi can't keep up with my speed!\" Cai Jianyun dodged the saber qi and caught up with him with his second strike!Xiang Nan was still flying backwards, and it was only less than ten meters away. He could only forcefully put the giant saber across his chest and forcefully receive a second blow.The second strike hit the giant saber, sending Xiang Nan flying again!Xiang Nan spat out a mouthful of blood in the air, but there was an unexpectedly sharp look in his eyes.Swoosh! Xiang Nan counterattacked again! Another strand of saber qi!Cai Jianyun easily dodged and caught up with the third strike! Boom! The two sides clashed, and Xiang Nan continued to fly backwards!That scene didn't look good. Every time Cai Jianyun chased after him, he would be able to send Xiang Nan flying, causing serious internal injuries to Xiang Nan.Every time Xiang Nan attacked with saber qi, it could be dodged by Cai Jianyun.\"This isn't right.\" Mo Hai frowned and asked curiously, \"This is not in line with Xiang Nan's style. He knew that his saber qi could not hit Jianyun, but he still chopped it out with a single blade.\"\"Shouldn't he have accumulated the weather first? Or should he just use the Azure Dragon to go out to sea again?\"\"Hahaha!\" After Cai Jianyun's three consecutive strikes ended, he immediately laughed arrogantly, \"Have you already injured your muscles and bones? Although you can block my sword strike with your saber lattice, you can't block the collision force!\"\"I only need two more three strikes. Even if the longsword doesn't hit you, your internal organs will shatter and die!\"Whoosh whoosh whoosh!Taking advantage of this, Xiang Nan slashed out three more times.Three streaks of saber Qi flew past the ground. Cai Jianyun moved his body and easily dodged, \"I really don't know what's good for you. You've already died, and you've even done something futile! Since that's the case, I'll send you to your death as soon as possible!\"The second three consecutive strikes came. Just like last time, Cai Jianyun slashed into Xiang Nan's giant saber every time. Every time, it made Xiang Nan's injuries worse by one point!As for Xiang Nan, he was still stubborn and used his saber qi to counterattack, but he failed every time.After the second three strikes, Xiang Nan was almost unable to stand.\"This third three strikes will take your life!\" Cai Jianyun's eyes flickered with killing intent as he rushed towards Xiang Nan.\"This time, do you still want to counterattack with futile saber qi? If it was me, I would rather save the weather first to release the Azure Dragon to the sea.\" Mo Hai commented from the side and shook his head, \"It seems that I overestimated Xiang Nan.\"As he spoke, Cai Jianyun's offensive had arrived, but Xiang Nan was unusual. He jumped into the sky with a single leap.\"Haha! You must have been beaten silly. There's no room to dodge in the sky!\" Cai Jianyun drew a \"Z\" shape and chased after Xiang Nan.In the air, Xiang Nan could not dodge no matter what.However, Cai Jianyun's arrogant smile was stunned when he saw something slowly moving in the sky.\"Hiss \u2026 what the hell is that!\" Everyone cried out in unison.Twenty meters above the ground, an incomparably huge saber qi was floating in the air, slowly advancing forward!Although the saber qi was only ten meters long, it was too thick! Too wide! Too big! The ten strands of saber qi were highly concentrated into one! The enormous saber Qi began to buzz in the air.When Xiang Nan jumped up, he stabbed his saber into the saber Qi, and then he turned around and slashed down with his saber!\"Jing Long, Yao Ri.\"These four words came out of Xiang Nan's mouth.In that instant, a huge saber descended! It was like doomsday.Cai Jianyun's Chi Xu Qi Shield encountered the Heaven-shocking Saber Qi and was cut apart by a single saber strike!The huge saber was bright, and the intense light enveloped Cai Jianyun, making him unable to open his eyes.\"Ahhh!\" Cai Jianyun shouted wildly as he crazily condensed the next shield. This second shield was also instantly sliced open! Immediately after, he tried to form a third shield.Unfortunately, that giant saber was too powerful! It destroyed Cai Jianyun's shield in a devastating manner, leaving Cai Jianyun with no time to condense a third shield.Saber, fall!Cai Jianyun was beheaded on the spot! His two bodies were thrown far away to both sides.After the giant saber landed on the ground, the earth jumped fiercely, leaving behind an unfathomable saber mark!Liked it?

Cai Jianyun could not hear their cries of alarm at all.Even though the other contestants had seen the saber qi, they had not guessed that the saber qi was used like this!Cai Jianyun died just like that, dying so \"spectacularly\".Xiang Nan descended from the sky. After landing on the ground, his body suddenly shook and he directly knelt on one knee. Fortunately, he used his right hand to support the giant saber, so he did not fall down.\"Jianyun!\"In the sky, Cai Baohua's heart-wrenching cries came from the flying ship.\"I'm going to kill him! I'm going to kill that bastard Xiang Nan!\" Cai Baohua jumped off the flying ship and landed on the light shield that enveloped nearly half of the black-edged demon. He punched his fist, causing blood to splatter everywhere.\"Open it!\" Cai Baohua screamed hysterically, \"Open this light barrier for me! I want to personally tear that little beast named Xiang apart!\"\"Sorry, I can't do it.\" City Lord Hong Zhen crossed his shoulders and said indifferently.Cai Baohua was so angry that he lost his mind. He pointed at Hong Zhen's nose and shouted, \"Did you hear me? Open it! Hurry up and open it! Didn't you see Xiang Nan kill my grandson?\"Hong Zhen's eyes flashed with a cold light, \"Firstly, you are no longer an elder of the Chamber of Commerce. Take your finger away, otherwise I will immediately order you to be arrested.\"\"Second, death and injury are inevitable in the city selection. Could it be that only your grandson is allowed to kill, and no one else is allowed to kill your grandson?\"\"Previously, when Jianyun abused the Xiang family, I didn't see any reaction from you.\"\"Ahhhhh!\" Cai Baohua let out an unwilling roar.Below.Xiang Nan looked at Cai Jianyun's corpse out of breath and said, \"Zhong Hua, Sister Fei, I have avenged you!\"Both Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei recalled how Cai Jianyun had abused them earlier, but what about now? Then Cai Jianyun had already been cut off by Xiang Nan!Release the hatred! Too much hatred! Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei were both happy and touched, and they couldn't help but burst into tears.\"He died just like that?\" The contestants on the green mountain hadn't recovered from the shock.\"Cai Jianyun, that's a Xiantian ninth layer expert! He's still the second strongest person in the city selection, yet he was actually killed by Xiang Nan?\"Everyone couldn't describe their feelings with words. Xiang Nan was only the number one expert of the new faction, so how could he kill the number two expert of the old faction?Moreover, under such a disadvantaged situation, how could such a thing happen? But it really happened.\"Xiang Nan!\" Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei rushed forward excitedly and placed their hands on Xiang Nan's arms.Xiang Zhonghua was touched and said, \"Xiang Nan, thank you for risking everything to avenge us.\"Xiang Nan smiled weakly, \"They are all family members, why \u2026 why are you being so polite \u2026 cough cough cough.\"\"Not good, little Nan . Your injuries.\" When Xiang Fei saw Xiang Nan cough out a mouthful of blood, she was immediately shocked, \"Your health is too bad.\"The current Xiang Nan was even worse than when he first arrived! He had already suffered internal injuries when he had suffered several consecutive three strikes. Especially now, his previous weather and stamina had been completely exhausted.ButEveryone turned around and saw that Mo Hai had already walked out with his wrist rubbed.There was also Mo Hai!Mo Hai clenched his fists and cracked his joints. He said, \"Xiang Nan, there is no deep hatred between us, but this is the city selection. I will settle your grudges even if we don't talk about personal grudges.\"\"Also, don't expect me to give you a chance to catch your breath.\" Mo Hai turned to look at Cai Jianyun's corpse and said, \"I've seen your strength. It would be unwise to let you recover.\"Everyone could tell that Cai Jianyun, who had been strengthened twice, had been slaughtered by Xiang Nan.Giving Xiang Nan a chance to recover was tantamount to depriving oneself of the chance to survive! Regardless of the reason, Mo Hai couldn't let Xiang Nan off.Xiang Nan gasped for breath and smiled, \"Don't worry, just now, you guys abused Zhong Hua and Sister Fei together. This vengeance hasn't been avenged yet, so none of you will be able to leave.\"Everyone was shocked! Was this Nan courting death? How dare you boast at such a time?\"I admire you.\" Mo Hai cupped his fists and cupped his hands, \"I really admire you for being so tough at this juncture. You are a man with strong bones!\"\"If you and I had gotten along well from the beginning, then you and I should be very good friends now.\"\"It's a pity that you've taken the wrong path. I've also chosen the wrong ally. At this point, you and I are unable to turn back.\"Mo Hai's right hand trembled, and a battle axe appeared in his hand. The axe was two meters long and was a single-edged axe.Battle axes were heavier than swords. Although Mo Hai's axe was not as long as Xiang Nan's saber, its overall thickness exceeded that of the saber.Normally, a martial artist would never use such a heavy weapon.\"You're wrong.\" Xiang Nan struggled to stand up and said, \"Even if we didn't go against each other, I wouldn't be friends with you.\"\"Because even if I face an enemy, I can't just watch as the enemy is abused. Instead, I'll give him a good saber.\"That's right. In the end, Xiang Nan didn't humiliate Cai Jianyun in any way and directly killed him.But before, Mo Hai and the others had personally witnessed how Cai Jianyun had abused Xiang Zhonghua, but none of them had stopped him. They had not even done a single word of dissuasion, not even a single knife had solved Xiang Zhonghua's pain.\"Perhaps.\" Mo Hai sighed. This sigh contained too much meaning. Perhaps Mo Hai regretted not helping Xiang Zhonghua, or sighed that he had become even colder after practicing martial arts.\"Come on.\" Mo Hai raised his axe and said, \"Today, either you die or I die.\"Xiang Nan tried to stand up, but he was too weak to succeed several times.\"Xiang Nan, don't move!\" Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei hurriedly pressed down on Xiang Nan.Xiang Zhonghua gritted his teeth and a decisive look flashed in his eyes. He picked up the Xiang Family Spear and rushed forward, shouting, \"Mo Hai, I challenge you!\"\"Heh, you want to buy time for Xiang Nan? Unfortunately, you are not qualified.\" Mo Hai did not intend to pay any attention to Xiang Zhonghua's intentions and headed straight for Xiang Nan.\"Your opponent is me! Don't forget that Wang Jingyun used to be my fiancee!\" Xiang Zhonghua shouted ruthlessly.These words caused Mo Hai's body to instantly freeze in place.\"Zhong Hua!\" Xiang Nan was anxious and shouted, \"Don't act recklessly!\"Xiang Zhonghua turned to look at Xiang Nan and smiled as if relieved, \"Xiang Nan, thank you for everything you've done for me, but \u2026 I'm also a man, and I have my own dignity.\"\"If you still think I'm your brother, don't stop me.\"Liked it?

This is his personal grudge with Mo Hai. It has nothing to do with you.\"I am also a man, and I have my own dignity. These words pierced into Xiang Nan's heart fiercely.\"Zhong Hua \u2026 you \u2026 you might die.\" Xiang Nan knew that he couldn't stop Xiang Zhonghua, so he could only say this.Xiang Zhonghua smiled and said, \"So what if I die? If as a man, I don't even have the courage to fight for myself, then what's the difference between living and being a pig or a dog?\"Xiang Nan finally sighed and nodded, \"I only have one hope. I hope you can survive.\"Mo Hai turned around and pointed his head towards Xiang Zhonghua.\"Come, Mo Hai! We are destined to have this battle!\" Xiang Zhonghua raised his Xiang Family Spear.Mo Hai nodded his head, \"I didn't expect that the Xiang Clan would all be men with strong bones. Zhong Hua, you've won my respect.\"Mo Hai let out a long sigh and said, \"Regarding Jing Yun, no matter what, it can be said that I stole your woman.\"\"I accept your challenge. Furthermore, I agree to leave you a chance to live. It can be considered an apology to you.\"Xiang Zhonghua shouted, \"Stop talking nonsense! If you think highly of me, don't show mercy!\"As he spoke, Xiang Zhonghua rushed forward with his gun.However, compared to the previous battles, Xiang Zhonghua's strength was simply too ordinary.Mo Hai waved his axe and easily swept Xiang Zhonghua away.Xiang Zhonghua scratched the ground and rolled over ten times in a row. He tried to stop the backflip twice but failed. Finally, the inertia of the backflip disappeared. He held his spear and stood up panting again.Mo Hai said, \"Give up. You are no match for me.\"\"Cut the crap!\" Xiang Zhonghua gritted his teeth and roared, \"Long spear, earth splitting!\"His spear was wrapped by the weather and rushed towards Mo Hai with a strong force. This was the Earth attribute martial skill that Xiang Nan had given Xiang Zhonghua a few days ago. It could increase his defense and the heaviness of the blow.Mo Hai raised his axe and used its side to block Xiang Zhonghua's spear.When the spear stabbed the axe, Xiang Zhonghua's Xiantian was the first to collapse, and he was bounced away.Mo Hai slid forward, his huge palm directly imprinted on Xiang Zhonghua's stomach.Xiang Zhonghua spat out a mouthful of blood and tumbled dozens of times in the air. After landing on the ground, he even wiped the ground and retreated far away.\"Zhong Hua!\" Xiang Nan was so anxious that he shouted, \"Hurry up and admit defeat! You have already proved your courage. If you continue fighting, you will die!\"\"Recover well.\" Xiang Fei pressed down on Xiang Nan's chest and firmly said, \"Don't let Zhong Hua's efforts be wasted.\"\"By the way, I still have some of the spirit herbs you gave us earlier. Quickly eat them.\"Xiang Fei did not have a storage ring, so the things she brought were very limited. She took out a small bag of first-grade Spring Return Grass from her sleeve and fed it to Xiang Nan.The medicinal effects of the Demon Origin Fruit continued. The thick and long medicinal effects were repairing Xiang Nan's injuries. At the same time, they were also restoring his natural condition and stamina.The two restorative medicines caused Xiang Nan's situation to quickly improve.\"Do you still want to fight?\" Mo Hai carried his axe and looked at Xiang Zhonghua from afar.\"Fight! Why not?\" Xiang Zhonghua struggled to stand up. Blood spurted out of his mouth and flowed down his chin.\"Yes.\" Mo Hai's right foot touched the ground and charged forward.\"Long spear, Earth Shield!\" Xiang Zhonghua hurriedly raised his spear.The long spear was wrapped in the weather, forming an oval-shaped air shield.However, with a simple charge, Mo Hai shattered the air shield and kicked Xiang Zhonghua in the chest, sending him flying into the sky.Everyone's gazes followed Xiang Zhonghua and watched as he was kicked into the sky. After spitting out a large mouthful of blood mist, he fell heavily.This could not be called a battle! It was a one-sided crushing.\"Do you still want to fight?\" Mo Hai looked at Xiang Zhonghua, who was lying motionlessly on the ground, and said, \"I promised to keep you alive, but if you keep trying, you will still die in the end.\"\"Heh\" Xiang Zhonghua climbed up twice and finally got up from the ground. He wiped the red blood from his neck and said, \"I didn't cough \u2026 so fragile.\"\"Yes, I saw it.\" Mo Hai nodded and kicked Xiang Zhonghua up, punching him in the stomach.Xiang Zhonghua hurriedly used his spear to block.Mo Hai's punch not only sent Xiang Zhonghua's spear flying, but also caused Xiang Zhonghua's right arm to crack and break in half!Xiang Zhonghua was heavily injured. He couldn't even lift the weather. Without the protection of the weather, he rolled on the ground dozens of times. His skin and flesh had been torn apart by the friction, and his entire body was covered in blood.\"Enough!\" Xiang Nan staggered to his feet and shouted, \"Mo Hai, fight me!\"This time, no matter how hard Xiang Zhonghua struggled, he couldn't get up anymore. He was too seriously injured.However, Xiang Zhonghua had also bought Xiang Nan more than ten precious minutes over and over again.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and swung the long saber in his hand, causing the blade to buzz.Mo Hai nodded and said, \"Zhong Hua used his life to buy you ten minutes.\"\"However, I am not Cai Jianyun. Xiang Nan, I will show my true strength.\"After saying that, Mo Haihu's body trembled, and an unimaginably thick first day suddenly erupted!The weather was so turbulent that it was like boiling water.\"That's Half Yuan Qi!\" Everyone was shocked.\"It's broken!\" Xiang Fei Xing's eyes were wide open, her face full of fear.Xiantian and Yuan Qi were not on the same level at all! The difference between the two can be said to be the difference between clouds and mud.Although Mo Hai's previous weather hadn't completely transformed into Yuan Qi, it wasn't something that Xiang Nan could contend against.Everyone had no doubt that even if Xiang Nan was at his peak state, he would definitely not be Mo Hai's opponent!Xiang Nan's expression was solemn. He had never underestimated Mo Hai, so he immediately sent out an Azure Dragon.Xiang Nanhua turned into a Fire Man and pushed towards Mo Hai with his black-scaled saber.Mo Hai, who had brought out his true strength, was not afraid at all. He actually chose to collide head-on with Xiang Nan.\"Fierce Tiger, come out of the cage!\" Mo Hai let out a low roar, and Wei An's body grabbed onto the axe and rushed towards Xiang Nan.The martial skills of the two of them were very similar, even their names were very similar. They were purely charging martial skills.Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon came out of the sea with a sharp edge. It was clearly more than one grade higher than Mo Hai's ferocious tiger.However, Mo Hai's Half Yuan Qi was more than one grade higher than Xiang Nan's.The two of them met halfway and collided heavily!A violent wave of energy swept through the surroundings. The two of them fought against each other with their sabers and axes. They were actually on par with each other!Xiang Nan's flames roared, desperately trying to shake Mo Hai.Mo Hai's Half Yuan Qi, \"Heavy Sword Without Sword\", was firmly and steadily unyielding.In the end, Xiang Nan's second half of the saber-drawing technique took shape. The giant saber was raised, and a huge amount of saber energy soared into the sky.Mo Haihu's body trembled, and his battle axe was raised high under the cover of Half Yuan Qi, smashing down heavily again!Boom!Xiang Nan and Mo Hai were knocked back by the second strike of the saber and axe! Both of them stepped on the ground and slid more than ten meters backwards.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was almost hacked to death.The difference between Xiantian and Half Yuan Qi was actually so huge.At this moment, Xiang Nan had finally recovered from the previous weather, and because of a single move of the Azure Dragon, almost half of it had been consumed.Xiang Nan was injured. He gritted his teeth and raised his saber, ready to attack again.Mo Hai casually shook his shoulder and said, \"You know, the ferocious tiger coming out of the cage is just an ordinary martial skill. Your Azure Dragon coming out of the sea is useless to me.\"These words caused the hearts of the spectators to sink again.It was unknown when everyone had already tilted their main target of observation, or their supporters in their hearts, towards Xiang Nan's side.However, Xiang Nan heaved a sigh of relief and said, \"I have seen the power of your Half Yuan Qi. In other words, Jing Long Yao Ri probably has nothing to do with you.\"Mo Hai smiled like a bell, \"That's not the case. Jing Long Yao Ri is very strong. He can still hurt my skin more or less.\"Xiang Nan nodded. \"Since that's the case, it's time for me to show my skills.\"Hearing this, everyone felt that what happened today had already exceeded their understanding.Watch the house? Xiang Nan had used so many frightening martial skills earlier, could it be that those were not trump cards? Just how many tricks does this Xiang Nan have!After Mo Hai heard Xiang Nan's words, he felt as if he was facing a great enemy. He knew very well that Xiang Nan was not a person who spoke without thinking.Xiang Nan stabbed the giant saber into the ground, his right index finger pointing at the blade and clanging three times in a row.Shortly after, a finger appeared on both of his hands and was suddenly wrapped in a layer of lightning.\"What is he doing?\" Everyone's eyes widened.All of them were dumbfounded as they watched Xiang Nan's hands perform all sorts of strange movements.\"Seal!\" On the flying ship, Yue Bufan 's eyes widened as he shouted in disbelief.Forming seals was an ancient method. Only people of Yue Bufan 's age and experience had heard of it. Even Wang Xiao Yun was confused.Below, Xiang Nan's hands moved in tandem. Finally, the middle finger of his right hand moved together with the index finger, and a sword finger slashed down.Thunder King Seal, Lightning Falling!At this moment, before Mo Hai could see anything, he had already felt a great crisis enveloping him!He didn't know where this crisis came from, but as an expert, he had a keen sense of danger and immediately raised his axe subconsciously, blocking the axe on top of his head.At the same time, his Half Yuan Qi exploded! The axe began to tremble.Just as Xiang Nan's sword finger landed on the ground, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky without warning!Pa!The lightning that was as thick as an arm smashed into the axe!Without even snorting, Mo Hai was smashed into the ground by the terrifying impact!On the entire ground, Mo Hai's people could no longer be seen! Only the enormous axe lay three feet deep on the ground.No one said anything, not even exclaiming.The scene was strangely quiet.\"Originally \u2026 I didn't intend to casually use this move.\" Xiang Nan let out a long sigh.The previous weather he had given birth to was only enough to trigger two lightning strikes. The reason why he didn't choose a stronger Sparrow King was because the Sparrow King consumed three times as much energy as the lightning strikes.Xiang Nan didn't want to take out the Lightning King Seal unless he had to, because all martial artists knew that the more cards he exposed, the less he had a means to save his life.Now that everyone had witnessed Luo Lei, they would also be on guard against this move.However, this lightning strike should be enough to deal with Mo Hai, right?However, the ground in front of him shook, and Mo Hai's enormous body jumped out from the ground.Boom!After Mo Hai landed on the ground, the ground trembled!He's this heavy?Everyone hurriedly looked at Mo Hai. Someone suddenly shouted, \"Look, Mo Hai seems to have grown a little bigger!\"Xiang Nan had also discovered that Mo Hai's height had already reached more than two meters! And his body was much stronger than before.What was going on?A thick layer of semi-Yuan Qi wrapped around Mo Hai's body. Mo Hai wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, \"To be honest, I really didn't expect this move of yours.\"\"However, my trump card is not only half-Yuan Qi, but also my cultivation technique, the Revolving Steel Body!\"\"And this\" Mo Hai stretched out a finger. \"It's just the first turn.\"Xiang Nan's brows furrowed. It seemed that the Revolving Steel Body was a cultivation technique that could make Mo Hai's strength explode. It wasn't just a simple explosion, even his body had become incomparably thick!Can a person weigh so much that the ground trembles when he jumps? Two hundred jin? Five hundred jin? 1,000 jin?At this moment, Mo Hai's weight was probably at least over 1,000 jin. This was already beyond the human realm!\"Haha, Xiang Nan, do it again!\" Mo Hai picked up his axe and ran towards Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan's eyes moved and his hands quickly formed seals.Thunder King Seal, Lightning Falling!Thunderbolt descended from the sky! Mo Hai raised his axe again.Pa!The lightning struck the axe, sending Mo Hai flying from the ground. The huge axe flew away, and the bones in his body were making a muffled sound that was overwhelming.Peng! Mo Hai's enormous body landed on the ground and he spat out a mouthful of blood.However, this did not cause Mo Hai to suffer any fatal injuries. He stood up again.\"Cough cough\" After Mo Hai stood up, he knocked a few times and coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood. His muscles began to spasm.\"Looks like \u2026 a single turn isn't enough to deal with you.\" Mo Hai gritted his teeth and stomped his right foot fiercely on the ground.\"Third Revolution Steel Body, Second Revolution!\"As soon as he finished speaking, the weather inside Mo Hai's body exploded! His entire body had actually grown by another circle under the gazes of the crowd, and his height had reached a terrifying 2.5 meters!Xiang Nan, who was 1.7 meters tall, stood opposite Mo Hai, who was 2.5 meters tall. His figure was already seriously out of proportion! Mo Hai was like a small mountain.What was even more serious was that Xiang Nan couldn't even use the first lightning strike.Xiang Nan thought to himself. Although I had never underestimated Mo Hai, I still greatly underestimated his strength.Half-Yuan Qi had already made Xiang Nan a little unable to resist. Now, Mo Hai had even taken out a three-revolution steel body technique!\"Come on, Xiang Nan! Let me see your strength!\" Mo Hai charged at Xiang Nan!His majestic body formed an irresistible momentum as he ran, as if a small mountain had been thrown over.Especially every time he stepped on the ground, it would cause the ground to tremble.As for his two-meter-long axe, it was swung over by him, immediately forming a fan-shaped half-Yuan Qi shock wave!The power of this axe caused a violent wind to rise!Liked it?

Although it was also burning with flames, the flames were mixed with strands of strange white.The huge fan-shaped shockwave that Mo Hai sent out was actually sliced in half by Xiang Nan's charge!\"What?\" Mo Hai was shocked and jumped up to smash the axe down.Xiang Nan drew his saber and raised it! The ten-meter-long saber qi mixed with the white lightning collided with Mo Hai's axe descending from the sky.Boom!The scene instantly exploded. A terrifying shockwave blew Li Qingchuan, Wang Jingyun, and the others backwards!The two of them were only standing on the outskirts and were affected by the collision between Xiang Nan and the other two. They were already in such a sorry state.Within the battlefield, Mo Hai's axe was sent flying high into the sky. Mo Hai's enormous body continuously reversed in the air and was fiercely thrown out.Looking at Xiang Nan again, he slowly landed on the ground and didn't even take a single step back!\"What the hell is that!\" Li Qingchuan got up from the ground and cried out, \"Yuan Qi? No! Yuan Qi is not like this!\"That's right, Xiang Nan used his incomparably precious White Flame Burning Lightning this time.He used the White Flame Burning Lightning to replace the effect of the previous weather and activated the Azure Dragon to go out to sea.\"Roar!\"From afar, Mo Hai's furious roar could be heard.\"Not dead yet?\" Xiang Nan was shocked, and when he looked over, he discovered that Mo Hai had already rushed over with large strides.\"He's getting bigger again!\" Everyone cried out in alarm.Mo Hai's height had already reached an inhuman height of three meters!In particular, Mo Hai's entire body was suffused with a layer of metallic luster. It was like a humanoid weapon!This was the third revolution of Mo Hai's three-revolution steel body!Mo Hai had really turned into a giant. His entire body was dripping with blood, but he was running like flying! The ground rumbled as his feet stepped on it.Everyone was afraid that Mo Hai's weight should have already reached an astonishing 2,000 jin! It was about the weight of fifteen or sixteen grown men.This scene was so shocking that even Xiang Nan couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.\"Xiang Nan! Eat my axe!\" Mo Hai's enormous body leapt up high and shouted, \"Blue Moon Slash!\"The two-meter axe suddenly shone brightly. A layer of half-Yuan Qi enveloped the axe itself. At first glance, it looked like Mo Hai was holding a terrifying axe that was ten meters long!That ten-meter axe was a real half-Yuan Qi!Before Mo Hai could land, the terrifying pressure of Mo Hai had already pushed the ground into a violent wind!Li Qingchuan and the others, who were watching the battle from close range, could only raise their hands high and use the weather to support the terrifying pressure of the wind.As Mo Hai descended lower and faster, Xiang Nan felt that his body was being pressed down heavily, and even his movements were not smooth.The power of this move was probably enough to kill a third level Origin Returning demonic beast alive!Xiang Nan's heart sank. If this axe falls, not only will I be smashed into meat sauce, even Zhong Hua and Xiang Fei, who are not far away, will probably be finished together!Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and fought!He flicked the giant saber three times, and his fingers were wrapped in the white lightning of the White Flame Blazing Lightning. Then, he quickly formed a seal with both of his hands.\"Thunder King Seal, Thunderbird!\"\"Chi!\" A little bird circling in the sky swooped down from a high place.The bird pierced through Xiang Nan's palm print and was grabbed by Xiang Nan, throwing it into the sky.The Gale Sparrow instantly turned into a lightning bird! The little bird's entire body was wrapped in white lightning. As it flapped its wings and flew forward, it emitted a series of crackling sounds.The tail of the bird was also elongated by the white lightning, turning into two threads of lightning about a foot long.Seeing this scene, everyone felt as if their brains were going to explode! Why did a new martial skill appear? What exactly happened to the bird?This was the Sparrow King Seal that was activated by the White Flame Lightning!The palm-sized bird collided with the ten-meter-tall axe in the air.In that instant, the sky shone with light!It was already night, and the reason why everyone could still see things clearly was because the six great profound weapons were shining.However, the collision between the Thunderbird and Mo Hai's Battle Axe shone brightly like daylight.At the intersection of the Thunderbird and the Battle Axe, a toroidal wave of air was blasted apart.Mo Hai's axe was shattered on the spot! It turned into debris that fell from the sky one after another.On the other hand, Mo Hai, who was three meters tall, fell from the sky. His enormous body heavily landed on the ground, rebounding once again and landing again.Xiang Nan grabbed the giant saber and stood there panting.In the distance, Mo Hai was already lying in a pool of blood.The scene was extremely quiet. Everyone was waiting for Mo Hai to get up again.After a full minute, Mo Hai's body finally moved, but \u2026 he shrank! He's back to normal.Xiang Nan finally let out a long sigh of relief. He thought to himself that Half Essence was too troublesome!If Mo Hai only had a three-revolution steel body and didn't have half-Yuan Qi, he could easily deal with Mo Hai with the Thunder King Seal activated by ordinary Xiantian.With that thought in mind, Xiang Nan's desire for Yuan Qi grew even stronger.Only a martial artist who possessed Yuan Qi was a true martial artist.\"Is it over?\"I don't know who said that.Xiang Nan had defeated Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai one after another, and the martial arts city's selection of the most exciting battles had finally come to an end?The contestants of the two green mountains had already pulled out their weapons and were ready to snatch each other's famous brands.And at this moment\"What a useless piece of trash.\" A flirtatious shout rang out, followed by a flash of red light, and Mo Hai was thrown flying.Everyone hurriedly turned around and saw that there was a person standing in front of Xiang Nan, and that person was actually Wang Jingyun?\"What \u2026\" Xiang Nan frowned. \"You want to fight me too?\"Wang Jingyun tilted her head, but there was an expression on her face that made Xiang Nan feel very unfamiliar. A kind of indifference suddenly appeared in her eyes.And that indifference was not something that could be created through disguise, that is to say, this indifference itself belonged to her! Her harmless appearance earlier was a disguise!Wang Jingyun chuckled, \"Originally, I was hoping to use Cai Jianyun and Mo Hai to get rid of you, you brat. It seems that I overestimated them, or rather, I underestimated you.\"In the past, Wang Jingyun was the only person in the Wang Clan who wasn't so hostile to the Xiang Clan, but now her performance showed everything.There was a hatred in her eyes! She hated the Xiang Family more than anyone else!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No!\" Xiang Nan frowned and said, \"It's Chihuo Sect!\"Xiang Nan immediately understood. No wonder! In such a remote place, how could Mo Hai obtain such a powerful cultivation technique as the Three Revolution Steel Body?It turned out that it was Wang Xiaoyun who brought this technique out of Chihuo Sect and gave it to Wang Jingyun. Wang Jingyun wanted to borrow a knife to kill, so she taught it to Mo Hai.Then, Xiang Nan said, \"Since you hate our Xiang Clan so much, why didn't you do it yourself in the beginning?\"Wang Jingyun did not answer such a \"sensitive\" question. She only glanced at the flying ship in the sky with her eyes.This gaze of hers made Xiang Nan suddenly understand!Wang Jingyun had always been shaping a kind of graceful appearance. She needed to maintain this kind of good image so that she could enter Chihuo Sect. In the future, she would continue to maintain this kind of image and obtain everyone's respect and recognition.Wasn't that the case with Xuan Qingzhu from the Heavenly Profound Sect? In front of outsiders, Xuan Qingzhu had always maintained a non-cannibalistic appearance. She was familiar with the sinister and vicious nature behind her back.Azure Bamboo Snake's mouth, Wasp's tail was stabbed. Neither of them was poisonous, the most poisonous woman's heart.Wang Jingyun said, \"What I didn't expect was that you actually have the strength to kill Cai Jianyun and defeat Mo Hai.\"\"Since that's the case, I can't let you live, lest you become a big trouble in my heart in the future.\"And now, Xiang Nan had nothing to say. It was a waste of words to talk nonsense with such a woman.Xiang Nan wasn't stupid. Mo Hai's Half Yuan Qi was already so powerful. Wang Jingyun's pure Yuan Qi was definitely more troublesome.Xiang Nan did not hesitate at all. Even after condensing a wisp of white flame and lightning power, his hands began to form the Sparrow King Seal.As for Wang Jingyun, she gently waved her right hand and a red silk started to spin around her body.The red silk had always been wrapped around Wang Jingyun's waist, and she usually released it, but after showing its true length, it was nearly fifty meters long!The entire red silk floated around Wang Jingyun and slowly rotated around her. As Wang Jingyun flipped her right hand, her Yuan Qi fluctuations suddenly began to change!Bright and dazzling Yuan Qi, mixed with a faint earthen yellow color! She was actually a Spirit Grade Earth Vein martial artist!\"My cultivation technique is called the Steel Barrier.\" Wang Jingyun's eyes flashed with killing intent as she said, \"The three-revolution steel body is just a derivative technique that I randomly adapted according to the Steel Barrier Technique.\"As soon as he finished speaking, the soft red silk that was slowly spinning around Wang Jingyun suddenly straightened up like a 50-meter-long sharp blade of steel!As for the hard red silk, it no longer coiled around Wang Jingyun in a circular shape, but instead began to walk in a straight line! They circled around Wang Jingyun at right angles, and every time the red silk turned, there was a crisp metallic sound!A faint metallic color appeared on the surface of Wang Jingyun's body.At this moment, Xiang Nan's Sparrow King Seal took shape!The bird rushed down from the sky and was grabbed by Xiang Nan, throwing it at Wang Jingyun.The little bird turned into a completely integrated lightning bird, flapping its wings and flying towards Wang Jingyun with crackling sounds.Xiang Nan used this move to completely defeat Mo Hai after Rank 3.A trace of disdain flashed across Wang Jingyun's eyes.Her right hand moved slightly, and the red silk that was as sharp as a knife and as strong as iron immediately coiled in front of her. The red silk was wrapped around her layer by layer, forming a steel wall!This so-called steel was not real steel, but an attribute!Gold, silver, copper, and iron were all ores, and ores grew in the soil, all of which belonged to the soil attribute.The remote martial practitioners of Blue Stone Town all thought that the Earth attribute was simply to increase their defenses. However, the Earth attribute was not real soil, but earth elements!Gold, silver, copper, and iron were all varieties of earth elements. Legend has it that there were powerful earth vein attribute martial artists in ancient times, and they could even turn their entire bodies into invincible Netherworld Gold, so that they could reach an invincible height of immortality and immortality.Xiang Nan had once possessed the Heavenly Grade Earth Vein Attribute. He knew too much about the power of the Earth Attribute!When he saw that Wang Jingyun's entire body had turned metallic, he already realized how bad the situation was.\"Steel barrier, city wall.\" Wang Jingyun indifferently spat out these words.The red silk coiled together instantly merged into one! With the crisp sound of clanging clanging, it actually merged into a steel city wall!The Thunderbird had already arrived and landed heavily on the steel city wall.In an instant, lightning shot out in all directions, illuminating the faint night. White lightning rioted in all directions at the scene.\"We must succeed\" Xiang Nan looked at this scene with an extremely heavy heart.Boom! !The terrifying collision caused smoke and dust to rise up into the sky. As the light in the sky gradually dissipated, the dust gradually settled. At the core of the dust, Wang Jingyun's shadow gradually became clear.\"No \u2026 fall!\" The audience exclaimed in unison.The Sparrow King Seal had failed!Wang Jingyun's city wall was still there! It was just three segments that had been broken by the explosion! One red silk turned into three.White Flame Blazing Lightning was a type of divine lightning. Although its power was incomparably powerful, once it appeared, it would definitely trigger a heaven and earth catastrophe.However, the amount of lightning power Xiang Nan absorbed was too little.A bolt of lightning emitted by the lightning seed contained less than a tenth of the power of the original body of the lightning, and this tenth of the power of the lightning was only absorbed by Xiang Nan by less than a thousandth!Wang Jingyun's red silk wall gradually dispersed. With a casual wave of her hand, the three pieces of red silk were glued together again and turned into a complete piece.\"This is truly astonishing.\" Wang Jingyun stared at Xiang Nan, \"This kind of martial skill is simply unheard of. It can actually break my red silk. Fortunately, you are only a Xiantian sixth layer martial artist.\"Wang Jingyun raised her hand and pointed at Xiang Nan. \"Steel Barrier, Viper,\" she said indifferently.The steel red silk suddenly shot towards Xiang Nan. As it flew through the air, it cut through the air! Let out a buzzing sound.It was hard to imagine how the originally gentle silk satin could suddenly become sharper than steel blades!Xiang Nan flipped over on the spot. He held the saber in his right hand and chopped down the huge saber on the ground. He borrowed strength to increase the speed of the flip!As for the steel red silk, it was in a perfectly straight line and directly arrived at the spot where Xiang Nan was at the last instant. When the red silk's attack failed, it did not withdraw, but immediately turned around!Clang! Red Silk made a turn in midair and continued to pursue Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan turned around again, and the red silk also let out a crisp metallic sound, firmly biting Xiang Nan! Living like a real viper.Xiang Nan had already been forced to retreat. His movement speed was completely inferior to that of the red silk. He could only clench his teeth and slash down with a single saber!When the giant saber hacked down on the red silk, it still let out a crisp clanging sound.As for Xiang Nan himself, he was actually bounced off by the rebound force of his saber strike.Liked it?

The knife just now struck the red silk, and it actually shook his wrist to the point of numbness.The red silk, on the other hand, did not even have the slightest indentation. It continued to walk straight, and in the shortest straight line, it caught up to Xiang Nan in midair.Xiang Nan had no choice but to retreat and lay his saber horizontally in front of his chest.Clang!The red silk stabbed at the black-scaled saber, but this time, it knocked the saber out of his hand and flew away!The giant saber was buzzing in the air, and Xiang Nan was slanted by the impact and slammed onto the ground fiercely.\"Pu!\" Xiang Nan opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood on the ground.Wang Jingyun's hands were shaped like sword fingers. Her sword fingers raised backwards, and the steel and red silk in the sky descended vertically again!Xiang Nan thought to himself that it was not a good idea to continue entangling with the red silk. Even if he could really risk his life and heavily injure the red silk, it would not hurt Wang Jingyun in the slightest.He had to use all of his precious lightning power on Wang Jingyun's true self.After thinking through this section, Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and took advantage of the gap where the red silk was chasing down, he immediately waved his right hand and pulled the giant saber back into his hand.Immediately after, the giant blade stabbed into the ground.\"Azure Dragon, go out to sea!\"Xiang Nan no longer had the weather to begin with. He had only used pure lightning power to activate the Azure Dragon to go out to sea this time!In this way, Xiang Nan's entire body was wrapped in a ball of white lightning. As the flames burned, the red flames also turned into white flames.This was the strongest Azure Dragon attack that Xiang Nan had ever launched. It was purer than the attack that he had used to deal with Mo Hai with only a portion of the power of lightning.Behind him, the steel red silk could no longer catch up with Xiang Nan's charging speed. The red silk simply softened and landed softly on the ground.Wang Jingyun gave up her control over the red silk. Her gaze was serious, her hands stacked together, and she gently pushed forward. Both her palms were aimed at Xiang Nan, who was charging at her.However, seeing her lips gently open, she lightly spat out a few words, \"Steel Barrier, Heavenly Chong!\"A shockwave of Yuan Qi with a metallic luster shot out from between Wang Jingyun's hands!The shockwave engulfed Xiang Nan and exploded!Xiang Nan lowered his head, desperately pressing against the giant saber, charging! Charge! Again!His speed was slowed down by the shock wave, but he still didn't stop.After the shockwave passed through Xiang Nan's body, a conical pit was blasted open on the ground behind Xiang Nan!The shape of the crater was like a meteorite flying over from the sky. The meteorite scratched the ground obliquely, leaving behind traces. The bottom of the crater was in the shape of a ring of ripples. The deepest part of the crater was actually ten meters!However, this was not the end! Wang Jingyun spat out another Yuan Qi shock wave from her hands.This shockwave once again struck Xiang Nan's body, causing Xiang Nan's charging speed to plummet a few cents, and another cone-shaped luxurious pit appeared behind Xiang Nan. The two luxurious pits were almost superimposed together, causing the ground to collapse instantly.Xiang Zhonghua and Xiang Fei were behind Xiang Nan. The cracked ditch created by the ground collapse was about to sink them. Xiang Fei hurriedly picked up Xiang Zhonghua and ran frantically into the distance.Boom! The third round of shockwaves was coming!This time, the shockwave hit Xiang Nan's body, causing Xiang Nan to feel a buzzing sound in his ears. His arms seemed to be on the verge of fracturing.Pressure! An unprecedented pressure!The pressure brought by Wang Jingyun's three shockwaves pushed the Azure Dragon to the peak when it encountered a strong one!\"Pull! Saber! Slash!\"Xiang Nan roared. This time, he held the hilt of the saber with both hands and fiercely pulled out the giant saber.A single slash soared into the sky! Ten meters of white saber light exploded out! Even the sky was illuminated.Although the saber light was only ten meters long, it was not saber energy, but saber light!It was like a Xiantian martial artist could easily chop out a blade qi of five to six meters. However, after they possessed Yuan Qi, if they chopped out another blade like this, it would be extremely frightening to be able to chop out a blade light of one meter.The power of this saber-pulling technique was more than ten times stronger than the one Xiang Nan used when he fought 17 times! This was the power of pure white flames and lightning.\"My God!\" On the flying ship, Elder Yue cried out in alarm, \"This is truly an eye-opener! The power contained in Xiang Nan's saber strike is something that even a true 1st level Origin Returning martial artist would not be able to chop with all his might!\"The soul-stirring battle between Xiang Nan and Wang Jingyun was no longer something that could happen in the Xiantian realm.\"Just how much potential does this kid have?\" Elder Yue Bufan felt his scalp go numb, and Xiang Nan seemed to be endless forever.Whenever Xiang Nan encountered a stronger opponent, it was as if he could erupt with greater combat strength to fight!Then, he looked down at the saber that had attracted the attention of the crowd.Wang Jingyun suddenly hooked her right hand and the falling red silk returned to her side in an instant with a whoosh.However, seeing her arms stretch out horizontally, she clenched her fists together and wrapped her right hand around her left fist, saying, \"Steel Barrier, Black Turtle!\"The steel red silk started to spin crazily around Wang Jingyun, twisting into a large red ball! This big ball completely enveloped Wang Jingyun.On the other hand, a layer of metallic Yuan Qi appeared on the surface of the red ball. This Yuan Qi had a shallow pattern, and it was actually like a prismatic turtle shell.Boom!The saber light crashed into the turtle shell! In that instant, the explosive force destroyed this area, causing countless dust to fly into the sky.With Wang Jingyun at the center of the circle, the explosive circle created a 50-meter-long hemispherical crater!The crater sprayed outwards from the center. The deepest part of the crater was more than ten meters deep. Only in the core area where Wang Jingyun was, the ground had not been destroyed, forming an earth pillar that stood alone in the crater.As for the turtle shell, it gave off a series of crisp cracking sounds. At the beginning, there were some fine cracks on the surface.Immediately after, those cracks suddenly intensified like mirror reactions! The cracks instantly grew deeper and larger, and the entire turtle shell shattered to the ground with a loud crash.The turtle shell made of Yuan Qi would disappear as soon as it landed on the ground.The red silk beneath the turtle shell was also broken into pieces. Then, he looked at Wang Jingyun who was at the innermost part.Her long hair fell down, and her body's strength equipment was damaged in a few places. Even a small bruise appeared on her face.But \u2026 that's all!The strongest Azure Dragon that Xiang Nan desperately launched went out to sea, not even Wang Jingyun's skin being cut!Wang Jingyun was also stunned. She looked at the broken red silk on the ground in disbelief. While she was stunned, she subconsciously raised her right hand and aimed it at Xiang Nan.\"Steel barrier, Tian Chong.\"Boom! A terrifying shockwave instantly struck Xiang Nan's chest.Like a broken kite, Xiang Nan rolled and flew backwards in the air, swaying up and down, spraying out a mist of blood.Liked it?

In particular, six of the ribs on his chest that had suffered a head-on collision had been broken in a row.The most serious one was his right arm. This was the hand he used to hold a weapon. The arm bone was broken, and the bone even pierced through his skin, revealing a bone spike with a dense white bone.Xiang Nan lay motionless on the ground, his consciousness somewhat chaotic.In his heart, he let out a sigh.Did he fail \u2026 In the end, he still couldn't survive the Martial Arts City Selection.I have already used the power of the White Flame Lightning without reservation, but I am still no match for Wang Jingyun.I only sigh that my realm is too low and uselessActually, it was no wonder that Xiang Nan was only a small seventh level Body Tempering martial artist when he was reborn on Xiang Nan's body.In less than two months, he had risen from the seventh level of Body Tempering to the sixth level of Xiantian. This speed had already shocked everyone.The battle between him and Wang Jingyun had been in a state where the weather had been depleted from the very beginning and his physical strength was about to be exhausted.He could only say that he had the intention to kill the enemy and was powerless to return to the heavens.Xiang Nan smiled bitterly in his heart. He didn't expect that he would die at the hands of a woman for two lifetimes. One was Xuan Qingzhu, and the other was Wang Jingyun, who was on par with Xuan Qingzhu's viciousness.\"Zhong Hua!\"At this moment, Xiang Fei's heart-wrenching screams suddenly came from afar.Xiang Nan sprawled on the ground and turned his head. What he saw made his eyes tear apart!In the distance, Wang Jinghai, who had always been \"invisible\", was currently grinning sinisterly as he pulled out a long sword from Xiang Zhonghua's heart.Xiang Nan did not know where the strength came from. Although his ribs and right arm were broken, he stepped on the ground and rushed towards Xiang Zhonghua.Seeing such a scene, Wang Jinghai, who was laughing sinisterly, was so frightened that his eyes widened and he turned around and ran away.Actually, the current Xiang Nan no longer had any fighting strength, and his ability to pounce over was his final limit.However, in Wang Jinghai's heart, there was an inexplicable fear of Xiang Nan! As soon as he saw Xiang Nan coming over, his mind was thrown into a mess and he began to flee regardless of everything.\"Zhong Hua!\" After Xiang Nan landed on the ground, he rolled a few times and held Xiang Zhonghua in his arms with his left hand.Wang Jinghai's sword strike was right in the middle! At this moment, dark red blood was gushing out of Xiang Zhonghua's heart.Xiang Nan's eyes immediately turned red. When he thought of how Xiang Zhonghua had risked his life to buy time for him to fight against Mo Hai, Xiang Nan's tears rolled down his cheeks.\"Xiang, Xiang Nan\" Xiang Zhonghua forced a smile, but that smile was incomparably desolate.\"I, I'm so unwilling \u2026\" Xiang Zhonghua panted and cried, \"I don't want to, I really don't want to die \u2026\"\"Brother! Don't talk, don't talk.\" Xiang Nan panicked and began to randomly grope through the storage ring. Regardless of what spiritual herbs he caught, he only continued to fill Xiang Zhonghua's wound.Xiang Zhonghua shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Xiang Nan. You tried so hard to protect us, but in the end, we dragged you down.\"\"However, we once gave up the Xiang Clan and chose to flee \u2026\"\"It's you, cough cough, it's you and Second Master who put aside their past grudges and generously accepted us.\"\"And this time \u2026\"Xiang Zhonghua's face was incomparably pale, and his eyes were covered with a layer of ashes. However, the corner of his mouth curled up slightly, \"But this time \u2026 I \u2026 I didn't escape \u2026\"\"This time, I didn't \u2026 I chose to fight alongside you \u2026 I didn't escape \u2026 I escaped \u2026 hey, hey \u2026\"Following Xiang Zhonghua's last miserable laugh, his body suddenly softened and his aura disappeared.\"Zhong Hua.\" Xiang Fei covered her face and cried in sorrow.\"Zhong Hua, brother! Don't die! Don't die!\" Xiang Nan hugged Xiang Zhonghua and thought of how Xiang Zhonghua had risked his life to buy him time to fight Mo Hai. He thought of what Xiang Zhonghua said, \"I am also a man, and I have dignity.\"Xiang Nan felt the pain in his heart.In the end, I still couldn't protect Zhong Hua.Gradually, Xiang Nan could no longer hear all the sounds, and only his own heartbeat could be heard.Peng Peng \u2026 Peng PengThe greatest grief in the world was to see his loved ones being slaughtered, but he was helpless.At this moment, Xiang Nan felt that the world had lost its colors.This time, I didn't escape! Xiang Zhonghua's last words before his death began to ring in Xiang Nan's mind, and it was as if a thunderclouds had suddenly exploded from the horizon!Xiang Nan slowly stood up.He expressionlessly looked at the siblings and muttered to himself, \"I was betrayed by my beloved woman and robbed of everything that originally belonged to me.\"\"And this life \u2026\"Everyone's ears were wide open, desperately trying to hear what Xiang Nan said, but they were too far away, and Xiang Nan's voice was too weak.\"In this life, I have obtained something more important than talent. That is, kinship.\"\"But you \u2026\"Sorrow to the extreme, anger to the top!A force sprouted in Xiang Nan's body, and the force began to erupt.The medicinal properties of the Demon Origin Fruit were instantly raised to its limit by Cui!The terrifying medicinal properties were like volcanic eruptions, and they wildly flew around Xiang Nan's body.All the wounds on his body began to heal at a visible rate, and even the bone spikes that had stabbed out of his skin had actually retracted.An indescribable imposing aura appeared on Xiang Nan's body. That imposing aura was burning! Xiang Nan's long hair fluttered in the air as it sprayed from top to bottom.The bottleneck of the sixth level of the Xiantian realm had finally been broken through!Late Greater Xiantian Six \u2026 Xiantian Seventh Layer!That power was still rising!Xiantian eighth layer!Xiang Nan didn't seem to have noticed his own realm at all. He cried and only thought of the scene before Xiang Zhonghua died.Who said that men weren't easy to tear up?\"Heavens! Look, Xiang Nan's strength is soaring!\" Everyone cried out in surprise.Xiang Nan's imposing aura was so fierce that it even blew the broken sand around him.\"But in this life\" Xiang Nan grievously clenched his fists, \"In this life, you have deprived me of even my most precious relatives.\"\"Ah, ah, ah, ah!\"Xiang Nan let out a heart-wrenching cry, which echoed through the jungle and echoed between heaven and earth.Xiantian \u2026 ninth level!Even Wang Jingyun was stunned. She blurted out, \"This \u2026 this is impossible! This doesn't make sense!\"As she spoke, Wang Jingyun raised her hand and struck a steel barrier, Tian Chong!The shock wave instantly engulfed Xiang Nan.However, after the shock wave passed, the smoke and dust gradually dissipated, and a figure slowly became clear within the smoke and dust.Xiang Nan lowered his head and stood where he was, with two long scratches beneath his feet.At that moment, Xiang Nan suddenly raised his head and his eyes shone again.He clenched his fist and recalled the black-scaled saber. He roared angrily, \"Wang Jinghai! I'll peel you alive!\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw an indescribable smell in Xiang Nan's eyes.The smell frightened Wang Jinghai to the point that his soul was shattered, and even his heart was on the verge of convulsing.\"Sister! Save me! Save me!\" Wang Jinghai was scared out of his mind and desperately grabbed Wang Jingyun's right hand.\"Hide well!\" Wang Jingyun felt as if she was facing a great enemy. With a flip of her right hand, the broken red silk on the ground fused again and turned into a 50-meter-long steel red silk.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth, almost bleeding. There was nothing in his eyes anymore, only Wang Jinghai!In his heart, there was only the sinister smile that Wang Jinghai had when he pulled the sword out of Xiang Zhonghua's heart.Xiang Nan raised his saber and rushed over with a flash.\"Steel Barrier, Viper!\" Wang Jingyun hurriedly raised her sword finger, and the steel red silk twisted continuously, chasing after Xiang Nan.However, after a martial artist had just advanced, there was a large explosive period. This explosive period would decline with the stabilization of the realm, and then return to normal.Xiang Nan was in such an explosive period, especially his explosive period, a super explosive period that had crossed three consecutive small realms.Wang Jingyun's red silk, which was wrapped in Yuan Qi, was unable to catch up with Xiang Nan!Lightning flashed everywhere under Xiang Nan's feet, dragging a long tail of lightning as he ran faster and faster.When Wang Jingyun saw this, she was so anxious that she could only use a stronger martial skill.However, when she saw her fingers clasped together and her index fingers stretched out, she tangled together and shouted, \"Steel Barrier, Great Snake King!\"The red silk that was powerless to catch up with Xiang Nan suddenly stiffened. The entire red chip actually began to erupt with a ring of air waves.Immediately after, the steel red silk twisted into the shape of a snake, and with a whoosh, it turned into an illusion and rushed towards Xiang Nan.Especially when the red silk was charging forward, it was actually enveloped in a faint shadow, like a giant python. However, this shadow was still too shallow, and most people could not even see it clearly.The Great Snake King's speed and power far surpassed that of the Viper. It caught up to Xiang Nan in an instant, and the \"snake head\" bit towards Xiang Nan's waist with a single bite.There was nothing else in Xiang Nan's eyes. He stared at Wang Jinghai all the time, but he pinned his saber behind him and blocked the bite of the red silk.However, this collision actually pushed Xiang Nan's speed backwards and knocked Xiang Nan into the siblings' side.\"Wang Jinghai, I want your dog life!\" Xiang Nan raised his hand and slashed down.Wang Jingyun quickly put away the red silk and said, \"Black Turtle!\"The red silk wrapped around Wang Jinghai like crazy.Xiang Nan's saber chopped down, but it did not split open the red silk parcel.Xiang Nan's eyes turned red as he shouted, \"Body Tyrant Lightning Body!\"Boom! Terrifying lightning flashed wildly around Xiang Nan's body, and his strength was rising.Double, double \u2026 five times, six times \u2026 eight times, nine times!After Xiang Nan had risen three small realms in a row, his Tyrannical Body Lightning Body had also greatly increased. The Tyrannical Body Lightning Body, which originally could only provide 23,400 jin of strength, had actually soared by 30,000 jin!However, this was only strength. Xiang Nan also had a stronger weather, stronger Qi Condensation and lightning! And the power of lightning.No one could stop Xiang Nan!Xiang Nan, who was in the Tyrannical Body Thunder Body state, jumped up and slashed down with his saber, cracking the village that had been sliced by the red silk and turning it into pieces on the ground.\"Sister! I don't want to die!\" Wang Jinghai screamed as his soul was exposed.How could Wang Jingyun have the leisure to attack Xiang Nan? As long as she could not instantly kill Xiang Nan in a second, her younger brother would die on the spot.\"Let's go!\" Wang Jingyun's right hand condensed Yuan Qi and pushed Wang Jinghai into the air.This push speed was extraordinary! That was pure Yuan Qi.Wang Jinghai was pushed into a remnant shadow and shot into the air.Xiang Nan drew his saber and chased after him. He stepped on the sky and ran out of thin air. The long tail of lightning behind him outlined a beautiful light in the air.\"Trample through the air?\" Wang Jingyun's heart skipped a beat as her pupils contracted, \"Xiang Nan, stop!\"Wang Jingyun really did not expect this scene. She hurriedly returned the red silk to its original state and another Great Snake King chased after it.Xiang Nan's speed was extremely fast, but the Great Snake King was even faster. In a short moment, it caught up with Xiang Nan, and the terrifying snake head fiercely swallowed Xiang Nan's face.Xiang Nan didn't even look at Red Silk. His eyes were bloodshot and he only stared at Wang Jinghai who was flying higher.\"Get lost!\" Xiang Nan slashed down with his saber, and lightning shot out in all directions, cutting the red silk into two halves.Wang Jingyun was already at the 1st level of Origin Return. The effective distance of her Origin Qi far exceeded that of the previous weather. This allowed Wang Jingyun to control the red silk from afar.She flipped her fingers like a madman, and the red silk fused into one, continuing to bite Xiang Nan.However, Xiang Nan, who was in the Tyrannical Body Lightning Body state, was unstoppable! Every time the Great Snake King caught up to him, it would be cut off by Xiang Nan's saber!Again, again! Again, again!Nothing could stop Xiang Nan's determination to kill Wang Jinghai!Wang Jinghai had already shot into the sky and was almost close to the light barrier.\"Brother! Save me! Save me!\" Wang Jinghai shouted with tears in his heart.Everyone was stunned by this scene.On the flying ship, Wang Xiaoyun descended and stood on the light screen. He looked anxiously at his younger brother, Wang Jinghai, and at the same time saw Xiang Nan, who was chasing him reluctantly.Before and after, this chase had only lasted for a short second, less than two seconds!Everyone couldn't keep up with their reactions. They only saw Xiang Nan and Wang Jinghai, two phantoms, rapidly advancing in the air.Pa!Wang Jinghai finally flew to the end and smacked the metal on the light shield.\"Brother, I don't want to die, brother!\" Wang Jinghai screamed in shock.Wang Xiaoyun was also anxious. His eyes were bloodshot as he desperately slashed at the light shield. The Yuan Qi on the sword body exploded, and each strike sent Yuan Qi flying in all directions.However, the light shield was formed by the six sects working together! Even if Wang Xiaoyun revoked the power of the Fire Cloud Pagoda, there were still five other sects' profound weapons supporting him! It's impossible to split.\"Xiang Nan!\" Wang Xiaoyun gritted his teeth and shouted, \"You dare!\"\"What do I not dare to do!\" Xiang Nan had already caught up. He gritted his teeth and shouted angrily at Wang Xiaoyun. Then, he raised his saber and landed on Wang Xiaoyun!With a single saber strike, Wang Jinghai was sliced at the waist!Wang Jinghai, whose body had been sliced in half, was still stuck to the light screen, slowly sticking to the ground as he fell.Wang Xiaoyun saw his younger brother being beheaded with his own eyes. He was so angry that he even used his fists to smash the light shield, \"Xiang Nan! I want your dog life! I want your entire clan to be buried with Jing Hai! I want to kill all of your Xiang Clan's bastards!\"Xiang Nan was also furious. He put his face close to the light shield and looked at Wang Xiaoyun at close range. He roared, \"Come on! Get down! I'll kill you with one blade! Damn it, come on!\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wait for me, wait for you to come out!\" Wang Xiaoyun pointed at Xiang Nan, his fingers trembling with anger.\"Jinghai!\" Above the flying ship, the Wang Clan's Clan Head Wang Changhe's sorrowful roar could be heard.Wang Changhe was extremely grieved and his mind was already in a mess. He waved his hand and shouted sternly, \"Wang Clan, listen to my orders! Follow me back and annihilate the Xiang Clan now!\"\"We can't let the Xiang Clan off with a single plant or tree. We can't leave a single person alive. I want everyone from the Xiang Clan to be buried with Jing Hai!\"The Wang Clan's crowd was furious, and the twenty-odd uncle-generation Origin Returning Experts released their surging Yuan Qi in unison.\"Let's see who dares!\" City Lord Hong Zhen took out a big halberd from his storage ring, and with a loud boom, the golden halberd stood on the ground.A ferocious Yuan Qi erupted from the halberd, causing the entire flying ship to shake.\"Everyone, calm down.\" Seeing this, the messengers of the other sects hurriedly stepped forward to make things right.On one side was the City Lord of Bluestone City, while on the other was the Chihuo Sect's Wang Xiaoyun's clan. The sect messengers definitely couldn't just watch the show.\"Don't stop me!\" Wang Changhe's eyes turned red. He pointed at City Lord Hong Zhen and angrily said, \"Hong Zhen, get out of the way! No one can stop me today! I must destroy the Xiang Clan.\"\"What if I don't!\" Hong Zhen raised his right hand, his face as cold as frost.\"Drink!\" Thousands of capable and capable soldiers shouted in unison on the entire flying ship, their momentum quite shocking.\"Hong Zhen! Remember your identity. You have no right to interfere in the personal grudges between our two families.\" Wang Changhe's tone was slightly lowered.Indeed, Hong Zhen did not dare to offend the Chihuo Sect easily, but the reverse was true. The Chihuo Sect did not dare to do anything to Hong Zhen either.Although Hong Zhen was only the City Lord of a small Bluestone City, he represented an official force behind him!\"Who said I have no right to interfere!\" Hong Zhen Lang Sheng shouted, \"As the lord of a city, a large-scale selection event like the city selection must be hosted by me! As long as Xiang Nan is not eliminated, no one can touch him in the slightest!\"What is the definition of the rights of a City Lord?The world of martial arts had its own set of rules. Struggles between martial artists and between clans would not violate the laws of the empire.Even if one martial artist killed another martial artist cruelly, the military still had no right to capture the \"murderer\".Since the duty of a soldier was to protect their country, the scope of their rights lay in protecting civilians and hosting large-scale activities in their own region.In other words, if you two martial artists fight in the wilderness and destroy each other, the City Lord will not care.However, if you fight in the civilian world, once your battle has affected ordinary civilians, the military can directly use force to suppress it!Therefore, if the Wang Clan wanted to destroy the Xiang Clan, the City Lord definitely could not control it. The key Xiang Nan was still a contestant of the City Election, so the City Lord had the right to protect Xiang Nan and his clan.\"Don't challenge my bottom line again and again.\" City Lord Hong Zhen was about to lose his temper. His face was ashen and his eyes swept across the crowd.\"From the beginning until now, your clans have been making trouble. I, Hong Zhen, have always maintained a peaceful attitude.\"\"But you guys have repeatedly touched my bottom line. Do you really think that I, Hong Zhen, am a dry eater?\"Hong Zhen raised his halberd and shouted, \"Where is the Bluestone Garrison?\"\"Roar!\" More than a thousand soldiers raised their weapons and roared heaven-shaking.Hong Zhen shouted, \"Surround the flying ship! Before the city election is over, no one is allowed to leave the flying ship. Otherwise, we will kill them on shot!\"\"If anyone dares to charge into the army, immediately gather a hundred thousand bluestones to suppress them!\"\"Order!\" More than a thousand soldiers shouted loudly with their true arms, quickly surrounding the entire flying ship. It could be said to be impervious to the wind.This kind of battle frightened Wang Changhe, and many sect envoys remained silent.Everyone felt fear in their hearts. It was too big, this time it was really too big!Hong Zhen's face was ashen as he scanned the crowd. Seeing that everyone was silent, he shouted to the crowd below, \"Continue with the city selection!\"At this moment, no matter how much resentment the Cai Clan and Wang Clan held towards Xiang Nan, no one dared to block their own lives to fight against the military.The moment Xiang Nan killed Wang Jinghai, he had already removed his Tyrant Body Lightning Body to preserve his strength.Xiang Nan stared at Wang Xiaoyun's eyes. His left hand was attached to the light barrier, and his right hand pointed downwards with a knife. \"Inside the light barrier is my world,\" he said coldly.\"Wang Xiaoyun, open your dog eyes and take a good look. How did I tear down your Wang Clan's last trace of dignity!\"After saying that, Xiang Nan released his left hand and his body naturally descended.Below, Wang Jinghai's elder sister, Wang Jingyun, was standing there in a daze. Her eyes were wide open, but there was no color in them.It was as if the moment Wang Jinghai was killed by Xiang Nan, Wang Jingyun's soul had also been cut off.However, in the next moment, as Xiang Nan's figure drew closer and closer to Wang Jingyun's eyes, the lower she descended, the deathly gray look in Wang Jingyun's eyes suddenly glowed with a mournful killing intent.\"Ahhhhh!\" Wang Jingyun's shrill cries resounded throughout the valley. Her long hair danced in the wind, and her entire body seemed to have transformed into a crazy witch.\"Xiang Nan, if you dare to kill my younger brother, I will make you pay with blood!\"Xiang Nan landed on the ground with a huge saber in his hand. His eyes were still as sharp as knives through the smoke and dust. \"You must commit your own sins, you must not live! Those who bully our Xiang Clan, you must kill them without mercy!\"The enmity between the Xiang Clan and the Wang Clan has reached an uncontrollable level. Either you die or I die.The Wang Clan had personally provoked this grievance. They had originally thought that the destitute Xiang Clan was the fish on the table and could be slaughtered.Unexpectedly, the Xiang Clan had a Xiang Nan. When the Wang Clan discovered that the Xiang Clan had begun to resist, and even had some results, all the Wang Clan members were unreasonable and unacceptable.You only allowed my Wang Clan to avenge your kindness and break down your Xiang Clan. You only allowed our Wang Clan to kill your Xiang Clan, yet your Xiang Clan actuallyAlso! Dare! Also! Hands!Xiang Nan did not hesitate at all. At this moment, he had just advanced to the third level in a row, and his strength was becoming violent. In addition, he was filled with hatred. He immediately caught up with Wang Jingyun with his saber and rushed towards Wang Jingyun.The current Xiang Nan was no longer the Xiantian sixth layer Xiang Nan. His strength was already beyond comparison.Wang Jingyun's eyes were filled with tears as she waved her hand and shot the red silk out.The steel red silk rattled in the air, making an ear-piercing sound of metal bending.Xiang Nan had already prepared for this. He was facing an Azure Dragon out to sea, bringing his charge to its limit.Wang Jingyun's eyes flashed with hatred as she screamed, \"Steel Barrier, Black Turtle!\"Black Turtle? All the spectators had suspicious expressions on their faces.The steel red silk coiled into a large bowl in the air, covering Xiang Nan, who had just charged.Liked it?

There was no point in doing so! The Black Turtle was only a defensive martial skill. Even if it could stop Xiang Nan, it could not do any harm to Xiang Nan.On the other hand, Wang Jingyun didn't get any benefits from doing this. She was just wasting her Yuan Qi.\"Could it be that she is buying time? But \u2026\" Elder Yue asked curiously, \"What is her purpose in buying time?\"\"Sh*t!\" Wang Xiaoyun was shocked.Other people didn't understand what Wang Jingyun wanted to do, but Wang Xiaoyun knew it best!Wang Xiaoyun said anxiously, \"Jingyun, don't do anything stupid! As long as you keep your life, it's enough. Xiang Nan will be dealt with by me! I will definitely let him die.\"However, Wang Jingyun turned a deaf ear to Wang Xiaoyun's words. There was only a monstrous hatred in her eyes, and she only wanted to personally kill Xiang Nan.Immediately after, Wang Jingyun made a gesture that shocked everyone.Wang Jingyun used her sharp fingernails to cut open her wrists. Blood immediately spurted out, and she even used her Yuan Qi to speed up the flow of blood.Along with the pressure of Yuan Qi, her hands were truly flowing with blood, spraying into the sky like two fountains, transforming into a rain of blood that sprayed all over her body.The more blood she lost, the paler Wang Jingyun's face became.\"This is\" Elder Yue exchanged glances with his Senior Brother. He looked at Wang Xiaoyun in unison and said in unison, \"Blood Sacrifice!\"In this world, there were no fewer pills and martial skills that could be used to increase one's strength.For example, Xiang Nan's explosive martial skills, such as Cai Jianyun's Blood Refining Pill.However, there were very few methods that could directly raise one's cultivation realm, and the Blood Sacrifice unique to Chihuo Sect was one of them.\"This is ruthless.\" Elder Yue's expression was solemn as he said, \"The Blood Sacrifice of the Chihuo Sect is usually used to flee for one's life at a critical moment.\"\"Releasing the Blood Sacrifice can directly raise a martial artist's cultivation level within a day, but after a day, the side effects of the Blood Sacrifice will come.\"Elder Yue's Senior Brother nodded and said, \"For the next year, any martial artist who has used the Blood Sacrifice will not be able to cultivate martial arts and will weaken into an ordinary person.\"The price of not being able to cultivate martial arts for an entire year was enormous. Not to mention ordinary people, even experts from Chihuo Sect wouldn't dare to use blood sacrifices.If your enemies are eyeing you and taking advantage of the fact that you have become an ordinary person for an entire year because of the blood sacrifice, wouldn't they be able to capture you easily?As she watched, the blood on Wang Jingyun's body started to boil, and her realm also began to rise rapidly.Even the spectators on the flying ship could clearly see that Wang Jingyun's aura was constantly growing.The sound of metal colliding with metal could be heard from the steel barrier. It was Xiang Nan attacking the barrier.The time that Wang Jingyun had gained allowed her to rise from the first level of Origin Return to the second level of Origin Return.Immediately after, her 1.7-meter-tall figure suddenly grew larger, turning into a 3.5-meter-tall figure.Her body was no longer suffused with a metallic luster. Instead, she had turned into a metallic woman, as if she had made a human sculpture out of pure metal.The bone-chilling metallic face made it impossible to see through Wang Jingyun's expression.Everyone cried out in shock, \"My God \u2026\"The second level of Origin Return was a powerful existence that could crush the first level of Origin Return in all directions.At this moment, in the distance, a fierce collision sound came from the inside of the black turtle shell made of red silk.Immediately after, the entire turtle shell split into two, and a streak of Heavenly Saber Qi soared into the sky!This was the final move of the Azure Dragon, the Drawing Blade Style, to increase the pressure to its limit.The vigorous weather made Xiang Nan ignore the gains and losses. Once he broke through the turtle shell, the next moment, another Azure Dragon went out to sea and fiercely charged towards Wang Jingyun.Wang Jingyun's metal face remained expressionless. She raised her hand and pointed at Xiang Nan. Her throat emitted an ear-piercing sound that was as sharp as metal friction. She said, \"Steel Barrier, Evolution Style, Greedy Snake!\"In this way, a piece of land seemed to be absorbed by a dragon as it was sucked away from the ground by an invisible force and transformed into a pillar of earth that flew towards Xiang Nan.The loose earth pillar suddenly rolled, and with a clang, it turned into a giant metal python!The giant metal python was as thick as a bucket, and its length had reached a terrifying ten meters. It let out a giggle, a giggle of metal bending.\"What? Her cultivation technique actually has a second stage?\"Everyone was stunned. Chihuo Sect was worthy of being a second-rate sect. He actually possessed a cultivation technique that could evolve. Such a cultivation technique was truly rare.Previously, Wang Jingyun had always used a red silk as her weapon.But now, she could actually turn the soil into metal! This metal python was countless times stronger than that tiny red silk.Xiang Nan's charge directly smashed into the steel python's head.As soon as the two sides exchanged blows, Xiang Nan was immediately sent flying by the giant metal python. The Azure Dragon was actually unable to hold on for even a moment!The difference was too great. The realms of the two sides were too great!Xiang Nan had already been sent flying, and the giant steel python did not hesitate at all as it continued to chase after Xiang Nan, who was flying backwards.This python's speed was extremely fast. It was actually more than three times faster than Xiang Nan's flying speed!Xiang Nan felt that his entire body was about to fall apart, but he still gritted his teeth and forcefully twisted his body in the backward dirt, pointing his back towards the ground. He casually drew his saber!The moment he collided with the steel python, an unprecedentedly terrifying pressure appeared. The strongest saber-drawing slash Xiang Nan had used was the reverse. It did not charge into the sky, but into the ground.This saber strike struck the giant steel python's head.Clang!Along with the deafening sound of the collision, the steel python was slashed by the unprecedentedly powerful saber. It tilted its body downwards and charged directly into the ground with a pu sound.On the ground, there was a pitch-black hole in the air.\"You hid?\" Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air and their hearts skipped a beat.However, almost at the same time that everyone cried out in alarm, Xiang Nan suddenly let out a pu sound from behind. The earth flipped and the giant metal python actually rushed out from the ground behind Xiang Nan.The python opened its large metal mouth, and its four sharp snake fangs flickered with cold light. From top to bottom, it tilted and dived towards Xiang Nan!At such a close distance, even though Xiang Nan had the strongest reaction ability in the world, his body was unable to keep up with it. It was impossible for him to dodge. He could only raise his black scale saber and place it between himself and the python.The python opened its mouth wide and pushed Xiang Nan backwards with its upper and lower jaws against the blade.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth and injected a large amount of pre-weather into his feet in an attempt to stabilize his retreat, because Wang Jingyun was right behind him.Liked it?

Regardless of whether it was the difference in cultivation realm or the difference between the weather and Yuan Qi, Xiang Nan was no match for Wang Jingyun.Even though Xiang Nan had risked his life, he still couldn't stop. It was as if he was a person who wanted to push a mountain with both of his hands.Xiang Nan gritted his teeth. Seeing that he was unable to contend against the python, he clenched his saber tightly and took a flash step, turning into an afterimage that quickly retreated.The speed of the Flash Steps had already surpassed that of the python, causing Xiang Nan to lose the oppressive power of the python. At the same time, Xiang Nan held onto the giant saber and directly chopped down Wang Jingyun.This was the benefit of the speed of the Shadow Steps.Even Wang Jingyun could not see Xiang Nan's position clearly. When she realized that Xiang Nan had disappeared, she felt a fierce blow coming from her back.Clang!The three-meter black-scaled saber slashed at the 3.5-meter-long metal Wang Jingyun's back, bouncing Xiang Nan back!Wang Jingyun, on the other hand, was only hacked and moved forward slightly by half a step.This was also the disadvantage brought about by the speed of the Flash Steps!The speed of the Flash Steps allowed Xiang Nan to attack the enemy unexpectedly, but it was because the Flash Steps were too fast! It was so fast that Xiang Nan didn't even have time to use his martial skill.Therefore, it was impossible to unleash a martial skill when attacking the enemy with the Flash Steps. He could only slash it flat.Obviously, Xiang Nan's slash was not a threat to Wang Jingyun at all.\"Jumping Clown.\" Wang Jingyun tilted her head slightly and spat out these harsh words.After Xiang Nan bounced back and landed on the ground, his body was slightly bowed, both of his hands holding the huge saber horizontally. His feet were still sliding backwards on the ground, but on his body, it was Peng who gave off a fierce first day.Rushing Thunder Blade, Berserk Dragon Battle TideIn the surging weather, Xiang Nan stopped, charged, and slashed the giant steel python.The python circled around Wang Jingyun and fiercely collided with Xiang Nan.Clang!Xiang Nan was unsurprisingly bounced away after hitting the head of the snake with his saber.The python continued its pursuit. Xiang Nan actually stepped into the air and used the rebound force to charge towards the python again.Clang!The second strike sent Xiang Nan flying without stopping for a moment.The two head-on clashes had caused Xiang Nan's blood vitality to become unstable and his hands to tremble.However, the giant steel python did not show any signs of deterioration.\"Stupid! That Xiang Nan clearly knows that he is no match for the python. Why did he continue to attack the python again and again? If this continues, Xiang Nan will probably not be able to hold on for a few more times and his body will be knocked to pieces.\"In the eyes of many people, Xiang Nan was practically courting death, doing meaningless acts.However, other onlookers could see the way.A sect envoy whispered, \"Look, does this change in Nan's aura look like the state he was in when he fought against the Steel Berserk Bear?\"Since the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide was not a one-off skill, it was very difficult for everyone to recognize it.Clang!The third slash was much more powerful than the first two slashes.However, this was still not enough to resist the greedy snake that was stimulated by the second level of Origin Returning Qi.The python smashed Xiang Nan to the ground and rebounded backwards.Pu! Xiang Nan opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale, and there were already signs of excessive blood loss.A martial artist's body was incomparable to an ordinary person's. A martial artist absorbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and the recovery speed of his body was also beyond ordinary people's reach.They could quickly recover from their wounds, and at the same time, their ability to regenerate blood was equally astonishing.However, no matter how fast Xiang Nan's blood regenerated, it would not be able to withstand the continuous loss of blood from his continuous battles.\"Are you still coming?\" Wang Jingyun's voice was ice-cold and ear-piercing. She hooked her right and the python continued to chase after Xiang Nan.Rather than asking for Xiang Nan's opinion, she was asking to humiliate Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan's small bows suddenly fell to the ground and he suddenly accelerated in the fierce backsliding. He rushed forward and chopped down on the python that could not be chopped down no matter how hard it was.Clang!Fourth Saber!Clang!Fifth Saber!One saber was more powerful than the other, and one saber was stronger than the other!The blood vessels in Xiang Nan's entire body burst out, as if they could split open and spit blood at any moment.The muscles in his arms were twitching from the violent collision.Even the Black Scaled Saber was almost unable to withstand such a terrifying impact force, causing the blade to begin to show fine cracks.Something suddenly occurred to Xiang Nan's mind. He immediately injected the powerful lightning vein attribute power into the blade, and the black-scaled saber advanced on the spot!Earth Soldier!The Black Scales' grade was increased by Xiang Nan's lightning vein power, and both of them rose. Previously, this saber had always been at the peak of the Spirit Stage. Now that Xiang Nan's realm had risen, it had raised that Black Scales Cui to Earth Stage.The black saber had undergone a slight change. The originally reflective black material had now become even darker. It was like a piece of charcoal, and even its luster had disappeared.The fine cracks on the blade were automatically repaired.Clang! Xiang Nan rushed forward and hacked again!The sixth slash was unprecedentedly fierce. This slash actually slashed down the invincible steel python for a moment.Again! Seventh blade, eighth blade, ninth blade!Xiang Nan repeatedly slashed out with even stronger saber power, and again and again, like a warrior who would never give up until he achieved his goal.When Wang Jingyun saw this scene, her ice-cold and bone-piercing face finally underwent a slight change. She said in a deep voice, \"How is this possible \u2026 the power of his saber is increasing again and again.\"The ninth blade was not enough. Again, the tenth blade, the eleventh blade, and the twelfth blade!Again! Thirteenth blade, fourteenth blade, fifteenth blade!Fresh blood had already seeped out of Xiang Nan's skin. His tiger's mouth had also been torn apart. Even the capillaries in his eyes had exploded due to the violent collision of his body. At first glance, it looked like two lines of blood and tears had flowed out.This fifteenth strike was already Xiang Nan's limit.\"Ahhhhh!\" Xiang Nan leapt into the air and descended from the sky. The giant saber finally unleashed its strongest attack!The sixteenth blade!Clang! !The giant steel python had its head lowered by Xiang Nan's saber strike, and its huge body was smashed into the ground.The power of this slash had actually caught up. Xiang Nan's strongest attempt to break through the black turtle earlier had been the Azure Dragon's trip to the sea.\"It's useless.\" Wang Jingyun lightly spat out these words and raised her right hand.The giant steel python once again charged out from the ground behind Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan narrowed his eyes. He did not turn around to deal with the python, but rushed straight towards Wang Jingyun.\"Azure Dragon, go to sea!\"Xiang Nan perfectly connected the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide to the Azure Dragon Sea!By borrowing the power of the sixteenth blade of the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide, the Azure Dragon that he had unleashed had already surpassed everyone's expectations.The moment he charged forward, the blade that pierced into the earth and crazily advanced actually opened a huge crack between Xiang Nan and Wang Jingyun.Even the soil on both sides of the mountain was being pushed by Xiang Nan's charge, causing the top of the mountain to tumble continuously, and two earth mounds to rise up.Liked it?

The one Wang Jingyun used was called the Mysterious Turtle, but this time, it directly turned into the Black Tortoise.At the same time that Wang Jingyun released her Black Tortoise, the giant steel python chasing after Xiang Nan instantly loosened into a handful of loess and fell to the ground.At the same time, a large amount of soil rose from beneath Wang Jingyun's feet. The soil turned into a large bowl and covered Wang Jingyun. The bowl also had turtle shell-like patterns flashing on its surface, but its color was actually black!Boom!When Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon went out to sea, its huge blade struck the Black Tortoise Shield. The entire big bowl-shaped shield was actually pushed back by Xiang Nan.The big bowl was knocked upside down on the ground, and as it retreated, it arched up an increasingly tall earth mountain.The higher the earth mountain, the greater the resistance, and the speed of retreat began to decline.Xiang Nan's Azure Dragon reached its peak when it went out to sea. Without hesitation, it drew its saber and slashed.Rumble!A ten-meter-long saber qi soared into the sky!This saber Qi was not huge, but it did not mean that it was weaker than the saber Qi that was nearly twenty meters long, but rather much stronger!This was because this saber qi was condensed from the sixteen sabers of the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide, and it was compressed into saber qi by the high pressure of the weather!The saber qi had even begun to shine. At first glance, it looked like a saber light.Kakaka!The surface of Wang Jingyun's Black Tortoise Shield was struck by such a terrifying saber strike, but it was only a crackAll the spectators who were looking forward to seeing a miracle immediately let out their anger.\"It's still too different \u2026 too much.\" Elder Yue's Senior Brother shook his head, \"The weather and Yuan Qi fight first. This gap is truly insurmountable.\"No matter how powerful Xiang Nan was, he was not a god! The difference between the weather and Yuan Qi was not something that could be surpassed just by desperate efforts.On the other hand, Wang Jingyun only hooked her finger and the cracks on the Black Tortoise Shield were repaired by herself.However, Xiang Nan did not give up!\"Azure Dragon, go out to sea!\"Just as Wang Jingyun was about to tear off the Black Tortoise Shield, Xiang Nan actually launched another Azure Dragon Sea Excursion.Boom! The ferocious blade slammed into the Black Tortoise Shield, pulling out the saber from the ground, and ten meters of sword qi rushed into the night!The small cracks on the Black Tortoise Shield were easily repaired by Wang Jingyun again.However, Xiang Nan was still releasing the Azure Dragon to the sea for the third time!\"This guy \u2026\" Yue Bufan was speechless. \"Did he use the Azure Dragon out of the sea as if it were a flat chop? He simply didn't want to die.\"Boom! Boom! Boom!Xiang Nan continuously used the Azure Dragon to go out to sea from all directions, charging at the Black Tortoise Shield time and time again.However, every charge would cause damage to the Black Tortoise Shield to be repaired by Wang Jingyun in the next moment.In everyone's eyes, this scene was already the end of the battle. No matter how unwilling Xiang Nan was, it was impossible for him to break through to the Black Tortoise Shield. If he continued to fight, he would only be stalling for a little bit of time.\"You don't want me to come out?\" Inside the Black Tortoise Shield, Wang Jingyun said indifferently, \"I'll wait until you're exhausted.\"Xiang Nan turned a deaf ear to anyone's criticism and did not think about it or look at it.He only gritted his teeth and tightened his grip on the huge saber in his hand, charging at the black Black Tortoise Shield time and time again.He maintained his saber strength in the Berserk Dragon Battle Tide. The sixteenth blade was already his limit, and he didn't dare to take another step forward.At this moment, Xiang Nan was almost exhausted. Although his saber power was still fierce, his entire body was like a balloon that was about to run out of air.\"It's finally coming to an end.\" Everyone shook their heads and sighed with emotion. Even though Xiang Nan worked hard, he was unable to turn the tide of the battle.Xiang Nan was at the end of his rope.\"Ah, something's wrong! Look!\" Suddenly, on the flying ship, Elder Yue shouted, \"Look at the sky!\"When everyone heard this, their expressions changed drastically as soon as they saw what was in the air.Saber Qi! Saber Qi still lingered in the sky!Because Xiang Nan's attacks were too fast, the Azure Dragons used them one after another, and there was practically no gap between them.This caused everyone to collectively overlook one thing, and that wasThe Blade Qi from the Azure Dragon's Drawing Blade Slash had stayed in the sky for too long!Ten! A total of ten strands of saber qi! A total of ten streaks of saber Qi that had been slashed out by the Drawing Saber!\"What?\" Wang Jingyun suddenly noticed this as she shifted her gaze away from Xiang Nan and shot a glance into the sky.Ten dense saber Qi that was ten meters tall were arranged vertically and horizontally in the sky.At this moment, Xiang Nan had already jumped into the air.\"You\" Wang Jingyun was stunned, but it was too late.Xiang Nan raised his saber high and let out a furious roar.In the sky, ten strands of saber Qi buzzed and trembled, and then they merged together with a loud boom.A dazzling saber Qi that was fifty meters in radiance rose out of thin air!The power of the saber Qi was so strong that it gave off a feeling of penetrating the heavens and the earth, as if the saber Qi was above the heavens and below the earth.As for Xiang Nan, he thrust his saber into the saber Qi. At that moment, he tilted all the remaining White Flame Lightning Power in his body and injected 50 meters of saber Qi into his head.The saber Qi bloomed with white light, shining brightly in all directions!\"Pour me \u2026 all of my previous weather, all of my stamina, and \u2026 all of my remaining White Flame Lightning Power \u2026\"\"This is my last blow. I will risk my life, my dreams and all my hatred.\"Xiang Nan raised his head to look at the sky and took a deep breath. Then, a sharp light appeared in his eyes.\"Shocking! Dragon! Shine! Sun!!\"Fifty meters of saber qi accompanied by white lightning was slashed down by Xiang Nan!This slash became the brightest demeanor in the history of the Martial Arts City Selection.At the same time that Xiang Nan struck out, his entire body was exhausted and he fell down from the sky. He didn't even have the strength to adjust his posture to welcome the fall.Countless pairs of eyes stared at the earth-shattering saber Qi.Countless hearts were beating rapidly at this moment.\"Bang! Bang her!\"The contestants on the surrounding mountain peaks were boiling with blood as they clenched their fists and shouted.\"Bang her!\" The spectators from the other towns on the airship also shouted.\"Bang her!\" Countless people shouted loudly. Everyone was lit up by such a spectacular scene.Xiang Fei covered her face, tears falling down her cheeks, \"Bang her, take revenge for Zhong Hua.\"\"Bang her!\" In the distance, the young disciples of the Xiang Clan shouted, \"For the Xiang Clan!\"The giant saber finally descended, like a galaxy descending from the sky.The unshakable black Black Tortoise Shield finally clashed with the Heaven-shocking Saber Qi.The Black Tortoise Shield only lasted for less than a breath before it exploded.Inside, Wang Jingyun finally revealed a frightened expression, \"Aaaaaaaaah!\"Shield Break, Blade Drop!The fifty-meter-tall saber qi slashed down, cutting Wang Jingyun into countless pieces of broken limbs.Puff, Xiang Nan fell heavily to the ground. He lay on his back, facing the sky, and said angrily, \"Zhong Hua \u2026 I have avenged you \u2026\"Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It taught us that a battle between low-level martial artists can also be shocking.\"The battles between high realm martial artists were either water-cut or sea-shattering, or even heaven and earth-shaking.However, everyone guessed today that the shock brought about by the battle of martial arts did not necessarily require a big scene.\"Looks like the results are out now.\" Many sect envoys exchanged glances with each other, believing that the battle was over and that Xiang Nan had won the final victory.However, the next scene caused everyone's hearts to rise again!There was another person!In the exam hall, there was another person carrying a sword, slowly walking towards Xiang Nan.\"Li Qingchuan!\" Everyone cried out in shock.How could he forget this person!However, Li Qingchuan of Mo Hai's team had never participated in the battle. He had always maintained his most complete strength.Especially Li Qingchuan, who was a late Xiantian eighth layer martial artist.At this moment, every step Li Qingchuan took towards Xiang Nan was affecting the hearts of thousands of spectators.\"Xiang Nan!\" Xiang Fei pulled out her spear and hurriedly ran towards Xiang Nan. She could not allow Xiang Nan to die under Li Qingchuan's sword in this final period.The current Xiang Nan didn't even have the strength to speak!Elder Yue's heart skipped a beat. \"Oh no, it's a blessing in disguise \u2026\"Xiang Nan Saber slashed Cai Jianyun at the ninth level of the Xiantian realm, suppressing half-step Guiyuan Mohai and fighting Wang Jingyun at the second level of the Guiyuan realm. Could it be that in the end, he would die at the hands of a Li Qingchuan at the eighth level of the Xiantian realm?Good fortune messes with people, really good fortune messes with people.\"It's broken.\" City Lord Hong Zhen's heart was burning with anxiety as he said, \"There is still one hour left before the city selection ends.\"This hour was enough for Li Qingchuan to kill Xiang Nan a hundred times.Facing Xiang Fei who was running over, Li Qingchuan shook the sword in his hand. The sword hummed, and the sword energy alone sent Xiang Fei flying.\"Don't kill Xiang Nan!\" After Xiang Fei landed on the ground, she continued to crawl towards Xiang Nan. At this moment, she could no longer care about everyone's elegant demeanor. She screamed, \"All the famous brands are yours. Please don't kill Xiang Nan.\"Xiang Nan was the Xiang Clan 's last hope. If even he died, the Xiang Clan would truly be doomed and would never be able to turn over.A faint smile appeared on Li Qingchuan's face. He stepped on the ground with his right foot and the circular air waves knocked Xiang Fei out twice.At this moment, Li Qingchuan had already arrived in front of Xiang Nan. He looked down at Xiang Nan condescendingly and suddenly asked, \"Do you regret it? Do you beg for mercy? If you beg for mercy now, I can let you live.\"Xiang Nan still laughed heartily, but his laughter was too weak. \"Do you regret it? I only regret being sophisticated in the human world and meeting people who are unreasonable. I have never regretted martial arts.\"\"Since you dare to step into martial arts, you should be willing to fight with your life.\"\"If you want me to be a dignified martial artist, you can only be killed. You don't know how to beg for mercy. Li Qingchuan, do it.\"Li Qingchuan nodded his head and waved his right hand. The sword in his hand condensed into the weather before humming again.Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air! But at the same time, everyone was moved by Xiang Nan's words.Li Qingchuan smiled and his right hand shook rapidly. A sword light flashed in front of him, while Xiang Nan lay on the ground, not even moving his eyebrows. He just accepted it calmly.ButHowever, that sword did not land on Xiang Nan. Instead, something floated down and landed on Li Qingchuan's hand.It was a famous brand with three words written on it: Li Qingchuan.Li Qingchuan personally cut off his own brand?Xiang Nan was also surprised and looked at Li Qingchuan strangely.Li Qingchuan took a deep breath. He raised his head and said, \"As the saying goes, human nature is originally good. No one is born to do evil.\"Xiang Nan smiled and listened to Li Qingchuan's words seriously.Li Qingchuan lowered his head and smiled, \"Actually, when I first came into contact with martial arts when I was young, I could be said to have thousands of beautiful dreams about the world of martial arts, just like grass that broke through the ground and saw warm sunlight for the first time.\"\"However, the more I grew up, the more I discovered that this world of martial arts was dirty! However, what was dirty was not martial arts, but people's hearts. It was all because of people's hearts that the world of martial arts became intrigued and schemed against each other. Everyone plotted against each other.\"\"The world of martial arts in my heart is not like this.\"Li Qingchuan's words caused all the martial practitioners to tremble and lowered their heads thoughtfully.Li Qingchuan took a deep breath and said, \"Therefore, I, Li Qingchuan, have never admired any experts. Those experts can only make me feel awe and fear, but not admiration.\"\"But I saw a Martial Spirit on you. I saw the demeanor of a martial artist, so I admire you and thank you.\"Speaking of this, Li Qingchuan respectfully placed the name plate between his two fingers in Xiang Nan's hand. He raised his head and shouted, \"I, Li Qingchuan, hereby announce that I will give up my name plate and be willing to admit defeat to Xiang Nan.\"Li Qingchuan's words aroused the hopes and dreams of every martial artist present. However, this world would never take the initiative to adapt to humans. Only people could adapt to the world.In this incomparably cruel martial law of survival, everyone gradually lost their original hearts. In order to survive, their hearts changed color.At this moment, the young contestants on the four mountain peaks also unknowingly came to Xiang Nan's side.The contestants stepped forward one after another and silently took off their badges on their chests. They respectfully placed them beside Xiang Nan.As more and more people gathered, more and more famous brands piled up beside Xiang Nan into a small hill.Xiang Nan was stunned. Xiang Fei was also stunned. Including the organizers of the selection of Martial Arts City, whether it was the City Lord of Bluestone City or the messengers of several large sects, they were all stunned.\"Senior Brother.\" Elder Yue was touched and said, \"Have you ever seen such a scene in your lifetime?\"Elder Yue's senior brother only shook his head, but he didn't know what to say to express his heart.In the end, apart from the dead contestants, all the contestants gave their brands to Xiang Nan.In a martial arts city election, Xiang Nan actually won the championship!This was an unprecedented martial arts city selection with only one winner.Liked it?
