After carefully examining the room\u2019s interior, which was sparkling so much that my eyes hurt, I put my hand on my stomach reflexively.\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026\u201dI calmly got out of bed and looked over my body. The scars that filled the whole body had disappeared, and my field of vision was slightly lowered.\u201cWhat the fuck is this\u2026\u201dThe scars disappeared and I became shorter. Secondly, I couldn\u2019t see my precious muscles. Every time I took off my shirt, the proud abs made people around me say, \u2018You look great,\u00a0Hyung!\u2019 were gone.\u201cOh!\u201dI groped the middle of my legs in a hurry, thinking about the thoughts that had passed through my head. Fortunately, the size wasn\u2019t bad. Of course, it couldn\u2019t compare to my original body\u2019s.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter looking around, I sat down with my buttocks on the bed and was lost in thought. First, I had to figure out the situation.My last memory was holding my stabbed stomach and struggling. No matter how serious the wound was, it was embarrassing to die because of the betrayal of my beloved younger brother. He was babbling something like he was sorry or he couldn\u2019t help it before he put the knife in my stomach.\u2018Then\u2026 am I dead?\u2019Being betrayed was not a new thing, but this time the situation was very bad. I was suddenly stabbed in the pit of my stomach, so my body probably couldn\u2019t stand it.I let out a dejected laugh.It had been years of struggling to survive, stepping in other people\u2019s footsteps, but I died in vain?\u2018\u2026\u2026so what the hell is this body?\u2019I was stunned by a reality I had never imagined. Actually, all of this could be a dream and I could be lying in the hospital. It was possible. Dreams that were as vivid as reality could be dreamed of. At least it was worth checking out.I jumped up and searched around the hotel room. However, no matter how much I looked, I couldn\u2019t find any knife or scissors. I threw a glass on the floor. The glass was shattered and scattered on the floor. It would take some trouble to clean it later, but I wondered what it would be like. To be honest, all of this felt more like a dream than a reality.I grabbed one of the broken pieces of glass and held it to my wrist. Red blood spurted out of my pure white skin. This wasn\u2019t enough, so I swung my wrist, letting red blood gush out.\u201c\u2026it hurts.\u201dWhy does it hurt? As I looked up at the blood dripping down, I saw a face I had never seen before in the mirror. The face under the fine brown hair was neat, and it looked pretty good. But his skin was too white and his body was thin, so I couldn\u2019t feel the vitality. Tsk tsk, you should\u2019ve worked out.The face reflected in the mirror was distorted. Whether it was a dream or not, if I felt this kind of pain, I should be careful. I sighed and pondered what to do with my bleeding arm when suddenly the door swung open and someone came in.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol! Stop sleeping and wake up! Master\u2026 what the fuck?\u201dThe man who was stomping towards me looked at me and asked in a pitying voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did you really harm yourself?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a mess\u2026 geez, you sure have been busy. You\u2019re such a loser.\u201dHe shook his head fiercely. I listened to what the other had to say in front of me. One thing I was sure of was my memory. Han Yi-gyeol. Why was this name so familiar? Han Yi-gyeol, Han Yi-gyeol\u2026\u2026\u201cAh.\u201dAfter contemplating the name for a long time, I raised my head as if receiving a divine message. Han Yi-gyeol! It was the character in the novel I read yesterday. He was the only person who appeared in \u2018Abyss\u2019 only to die.\u201cOh, what do you mean by \u2018ah\u2019? Are your speaking skills deteriorating? Forget it. Hurry up and come out quickly. The Master is calling.\u201dThe man forcibly pulled me away, uncaring about my bloody arm. As I left the room and walked down the hotel hallway, it was hard to come to my senses.Really? Really? Did this make sense? I didn\u2019t just come into someone else\u2019s body, but into a character?And why did I have to be this one?\u2018Wait a minute.\u2019Thinking up to that point, I belatedly remembered what kind of novel the Abyss was. Abyss was a male-oriented novel. That was, the number of female characters was significantly higher than that of male characters. In the end, all of them became a woman who was obsessed with the main character and cried out for his love.\u2018Fuck\u2026\u2026 Long live Han Yi-gyeol. Thank you.\u2019Suddenly, favourability for Han Yi-gyeol increased dramatically. Okay. He has a very good face, he has a good head, and he\u2019s a man above all, right? He\u2019s a man!\u201cGo in.\u201dI prayed in my heart to the godlike person who put me in this body, but the man who led me to the room opened the door and pushed me roughly. The hotel room I entered looked bigger and more expensive than the room I was in.\u201c\u2026\u2026what\u2019s wrong with your arm?\u201dAs I stood still and looked around the room, I heard a strange voice behind my back. I turned around and the man who had just left the bathroom was looking at me. His large upper body was visible through the white robe.I slowly raised my gaze to see a sculptural appearance wiping his wet dark hair roughly with his hand. It was a face that could only be described as outstanding. Even a popular actor who went to a salon to maintain his looks in his free time wouldn\u2019t look like that.The man\u2019s face made him look like a devout believer or an insidious murderer under subtly different lighting.The man who met my eyes, was looking at my face absentmindedly, and threw out a sentence.\u201cPoint your eyes down before I pull them out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he said that, I was sure of who he was. He was that bastard who Han Yi-gyeol always trembled around\u2014Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cI asked you what was with your arm,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon asked again. I thought about it for a while then answered politely.\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who heard me, looked at me with his eyes asking, \u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 Didn\u2019t I answer right? I answered with the utmost care in mind.As Han Yi-gyeol in the original story was so quiet, it wasn\u2019t easy to find references to him. Originally, Han Yi-gyeol trembled in front of Cheon Sa-yeon and barely nodded his head, and in front of the main character, he did what Cheon Sa-yeon told him to do and got beaten.I had no idea how a timid young man behaved. Most of the guys around me were the big and war-like type. Han Yi-gyeol was a young flower-like man who I had never met in my life.\u201cI heard that \u2018The Empress of Red Flames\u2019 will clear the G7 area and come out through the gate tomorrow afternoon.\u201dThe Empress of Red Flames. This naming was\u2026 Since the novel Abyss was written 10 years ago, the naming was a bit childish.\u201cWind is quite useful against fire. Go and kidnap her. Let the Roheon Guild kid get the news.\u201dWho was the Empress of Red Flames again? \u2026as I listened blankly, I naturally recalled the contents of the novel at the next command. In the beginning, it seemed that the main character rescued a kidnapped woman. The Empress of Red Flames that Cheon Sa-yeon said to kidnap was the target and the kid from the Roheon Guild meant the main character.What happened to Han Yi-gyeol at this time? I think he was beaten up by the main character. No, more than that.\u2018I don\u2019t know who the Empress of Red Flames is\u2026\u2026\u2019I was confused because there were so many women who appeared. Previously, I was full of confidence with my memory, but now I became unsure. Cheon Sa-yeon pulled out a cigarette while looking at the night view of Seoul outside the window and frowned.\u201cIf you understand, why don\u2019t you leave?\u201dI was going to ask Cheon Sa-yeon who the Empress of Red Flames was, but I stopped. There were a lot of things I didn\u2019t understand that I couldn\u2019t ask Cheon Sa-yeon, who was like the final boss. It was advantageous to step back quietly now.I opened my mouth, but thinking that I might be seen as crazy again, I just nodded and turned to leave. Behind my back, I heard a \u201cHm?\u201d but it didn\u2019t seem like anything to worry about, so I left the room as it was. When I came out of the hallway, the man who guided me was waiting for me. He looked at me and smirked.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you today? You usually come out crying.\u201dIt was a childish provocation. In my opinion, Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s personality and appearance were a problem. It was easy to ignore the kind and soft-looking face. If it had been my face in the past, these immature people would not have been able to talk to me recklessly.I just raised my eyebrows and brushed past him. All the way back to my room, I heard swearing behind me, but I pretended not to hear it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I skillfully healed my injured arm and took out a piece of paper and a pen. I needed to objectively summarize my situation.First of all, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s order. This had to be accomplished. If I didn\u2019t follow the progress in the novel, there may be some discrepancies, and now I was not in a position to openly defy Cheon Sa-yeon. I wanted to get rid of them all in my heart, but I couldn\u2019t because my body felt pain. Cheon Sa-yeon was a villainous boss who had neither blood nor tears, so if I disobeyed his orders, he would punish him relentlessly.I was right to keep an eye on him, at least until I found a place to hide. I moved the pen.\u300c1. Any pain or sensation in the body feels normal. Death seems possible.2. Whatever it is, if I want to be comfortable, I have to buy now.3. I need a way to break the relationship with Cheon Sa-yeon.\u300dI wrote this far and laid down as if tossing a pen, leaning my back on the sofa. I had to go to the \u2018Empress of Red Flames\u2019 tomorrow and kidnapped her, but there were so many things I didn\u2019t know.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know how to use my abilities.\u201dI was confident that I could use a knife or a gun well. With just that, there was no way I could threaten and kidnap someone who could handle fire freely.I looked down at my empty hands. It reminded me of my original hand, which was not very good looking, full of scars and bumpy bones. In comparison, Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s hands were much smaller, white, and slender\u2026 They really did seem like \u2018delicate hands\u2019 (\uc12c\uc12c\uc625\uc218).However, this pretty hand showed no sign of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s ability to wind. In the novel, he was able to handle wind with one hand skillfully. I looked at my palms with my palms open for a while, until exhaustion crept up and I lay down on the bed. I didn\u2019t do anything yet I was tired.\u2018What the hell did I do to be under that guy\u2019s (CSY) command.\u2019I clicked my tongue. I remembered my past life when I was growing up as an orphan and struggling to live. If I had the ability to control wind, I would have had a more comfortable and free life. In the first place, Han Yi-gyeol was forcibly tied because of his younger sister.\u2026in fact, even that I couldn\u2019t understand because I\u2019ve never had anything like a younger sister in my life.I closed my eyes, leaving behind the unpleasant thoughts. In an instant, my consciousness clouded and darkness fell.* * *\u201cUgh\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201dHis eyes were blurry. Hot tears were flowing down his face, and his hands on the grey rough cement floor were dirty. He barely raised his head and pleaded with a trembling voice.\u201cPlease, stay\u2026 with me\u2026\u201d\u201cHow persistent.\u201dThe voice that cut off the words relentlessly was very cold. There was contempt as he looked down.Beautiful lips opened. \u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cI said it clearly. I used your sister as an excuse all this time, but that\u2019s over now. Your little sister is dead and you are useless.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you understand, don\u2019t show up again. If I see you again\u2026\u201dWithout finishing his words, he turned his back. The back that had been stared at moved away as he grabbed his trembling chest.\u201cOh, no\u2026 no, I\u2026\u201dWhat if you leave too? How can I live alone?It was painful as if his chest had been mutilated. Tears pouring from his eyes blurred his vision. He forced his trembling body to stretch out his hand, but even the hem of his robe could not be touched.\u201cNo, please\u2026 Please, take me. I will do anything.\u201d\u201cTake him away.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHis two arms were caught by a strong force. He reflexively gathered the wind at his fingertips to shake them off, but in the end, he couldn\u2019t do anything. He was afraid that he would be hated even more if he rebelled here\u2014even though he knew it was already too late.\u201cHuh, huh, ah\u2026 please\u2026\u201dPlease, please.Please\u2026* * *My eyes shot open.\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dI muttered involuntarily and got up. As I lowered my head, tears fell on the blanket. My stomach was churning and my body was hot. Ugh, I moaned and ran my hand over my face. It was wet and I felt very dirty.\u201cHa, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026 asshole.\u201dTo be shedding precious tears for an asshole. Angrily, I threw my clothes and went into the bathroom to turn on the water. After taking a cold shower, I felt a little better. I checked the time and saw it was just past 11 am.I put on my bathrobe and drank water. I thought quietly.\u2018Why did I suddenly have that dream?\u2019The part where Cheon Sa-yeon abandoned Han Yi-gyeol was in the middle of the novel. It was a dream that did not fit the current situation.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dI put down my glass of water and sighed. It was easier to just skip questions that you couldn\u2019t find an answer to, even if you\u2019d thought about it. But there were some things to check.I raised my hand and flexed my fingers. For a brief moment, there was a moment in my dream where Han Yi-gyeol tried to use his powers. A strange sensation of something cold running through his body. I had to follow it.As I closed my eyes and focused, I felt something cool in my heart, to my surprise\u2014it was like smoke and water. The energy that had gathered in my heart began to move as I wanted it to. As energy flowed through my arms and into my hands, I heard the sound of the wind whistling like in the novel.I opened my eyes and pointed to the glass of water with my hand. Then, the water in the cup floated in the air in the shape of a whirlpool. It was strange yet so easy.\u2018If I hadn\u2019t dreamed it, it would have been difficult to find out.\u2019Still, I was glad I knew how to use it. I wanted to test the magnitude of the force a little more. I couldn\u2019t make a mess in the hotel room, so I thought I\u2019d have to go outside. Besides, the \u2018Empress of Red Flames\u2019 must also be kidnapped.* * *I ordered room service for lunch. Since it was the room that Cheon Sa-yeon gave me, I deliberately ordered the expensive one. As a master of a well-known guild, the cost might have just been a drop in the sea to him (\uac1c\ubbf8 \ub354\ub4ec\uc774\ub9cc\ud07c\ub3c4\uc548 \ub418\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc. Literally \u201cant\u2019s antennae\u201d).While waiting for dinner, I turned on the TV and the news came out. News is the best way to find out what\u2019s going on in the world. Watching with interest, I widened my eyes at the voice of the announcer that followed.[The \u2018Empress of Red Flames\u2019 Cha Soo-yeon, who went out for reconnaissance in the G7 area, is returning today. Most of the G7 area is inhabited by B-rank monsters, but the area is so wide that it is not easy to understand. She is expected to come out of the gate around 3 pm, and the guild is currently\u2026]I carefully looked at the picture next to the announcer. A woman with red hair, dark eyes, and slightly raised lips. Who cares if it was a male-oriented novel. She was an amazing beauty.Cha Soo-yeon. It was definitely a name I saw in the novel. She appeared a few times in the beginning, but she was one of the supporting actors who did not appear in the second half. I didn\u2019t think she had a strong personality\u2026When the announcer\u2019s explanation was finished, the screen changed and the reporter at the gate of the G7 area started the on-site broadcast. The gate was quite crowded with reporters and Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s guild members. I had to take Cha Soo-yeon out of there and kidnap her? It was driving me crazy.Room service arrived when the on-site broadcast was over and we moved on to the next news. After enjoying the expensive food, I changed into the clothes prepared by Cheon Sa-yeon and took my wallet. Regardless, I had to go to the G7 area gate.I wondered if at least one guard would follow me, but there was no one in the hallway. I came out of the hotel by myself and brushed the back of my hair.You thought that I wouldn\u2019t be able to run away because I had a younger sister. Well, I\u2019m fine.This world I encountered for the first time was more ordinary than I thought. There were no flying cars or monsters roaming the streets or anything like that. Come to think of it, in the novel, it was said that there might be one in a thousand talented people. Even within those numbers, the abilities vary according to the rank, so there were very few people with the ability to enter the gate where monsters inhabited.\u201cIt\u2019s beyond me.\u201dI walked down the street, stroking my wrists. I wanted to check how strong my ability was, but the world was so peaceful. If you used your ability anywhere, you could be arrested by the police.As I was contemplating what to do, I heard a sharp scream from the other side of the road.\u201cFire! The building is on fire!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShould I call this an opportunity?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cPardon? About Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s question, Kim Woo-jin made a bewildered face. He didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d be summoned all of a sudden and asked questions like this. However, there was no way that a single attendant like him could understand the intention of the handsome Master. Kim Woo-jin, who was scratching the back of his head, answered immediately.\u201cNothing special. Until the Master called, he was in the room as usual.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon asked again, tying a dark blue tie, \u201cOther than that?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWas there anything else unusual?\u201d\u201cYes, um\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin hesitated for a moment.\u00a0Unusual. Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s face, which faced him naturally before, came to mind. He had been an idiot who couldn\u2019t even make eye contact with him, but this time was different. The way he (Han Yi-gyeol) looked at him was dignified and showed confidence. Even his always withdrawn posture became straight like a model\u2019s, and everything changed, including his tone of voice, his accent, and his personality. He was like a different person.\u201cIt was a little strange. He didn\u2019t cry or\u2026 It\u2019s hard to explain, but the atmosphere has changed.\u201dBut it was somehow difficult to tell the boss about this. He tried to explain as much as possible, but he didn\u2019t know if he did it right.\u201cRight.\u201dFortunately, Cheon Sa-yeon put on a suit jacket and said something else. \u201cToday, Han Yi-gyeol is going out.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cFollow him. And if you find something strange, report it.\u201dKim Woo-jin was a bit surprised by the command that followed, but he did not express his surprise and bowed his head. Up until this point, Cheon Sa-yeon had never acknowledged Han Yi-gyeol as a person.He knew, of course, it wasn\u2019t because of a silly reason like he believed in Han Yi-gyeol. It was a natural choice since he was holding onto his weakness. All the followers knew that Cheon Sa-yeon had something to do with Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s last remaining blood relative.\u2018Indeed\u2026 he really is too different to ignore.\u2019An order was issued to monitor Han Yi-gyeol.Kim Woo-jin recalled the memory of being surprised that Han Yi-gyeol, who came out from Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s room yesterday, for some reason was not crying. He usually cried and trembled as if he had a seizure. It\u2019d be nice if it wasn\u2019t the case, but if Han Yi-gyeol was planning on giving up his blood relative and had other plans\u2026\u201cWhat an annoying bastard.\u201dKim Woo-jin wrinkled his face and clicked his tongue.\u00a0He should have lived quietly like a dead mouse. Caused so much trouble.* * *Next day. Kim Woo-jin smirked as he followed Han Yi-gyeol as he left the hotel leisurely after ordering his room service. What\u2019s with all that free time? Did you really go crazy? Kim Woo-jin activated his ability.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s ability was to \u2018blur his presence\u2019. Although it wasn\u2019t a high-level ability that made him invisible, it was still useful to follow others.Using his abilities, other\u2019s impression of him was blurred and his presence was sharply diminished. Even people who knew Kim Woo-jin\u2019s original appearance would pass by without recognizing him when he was using his abilities. The effect lasted until the ability was turned off, and there was no burden other than the fact that he\u2019d get easily fatigued from the constant consumption of mental power.He put on the hat he had brought and followed Han Yi-gyeol while keeping a certain distance. Kim Woo-jin sighed as he looked at Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s back as he looked around like a kindergartener who first came to the amusement park. Perhaps, as ordered, Han Yi-gyeol would head to the G7 zone gate to kidnap Cha Soo-yeon. It was quite a distance from here, so he would probably catch a taxi\u2026\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201dAt that time, Han Yi-gyeol started running. Did he happen to recognize him? Would that be possible? Kim Woo-jin, who started running quickly, frowned at the place where Han Yi-gyeol had arrived.\u201cKyaaaa!\u201d\u201cThe fire engine can\u2019t come in! Move your cars!\u201d\u201cWhat? There really is a fire?\u201dThere was a building with thick smoke billowing out of it. Han Yi-gyeol could be seen among the onlookers gathered at the cry that a fire had started.\u2018How surprising. Why did you run? Were you just trying to see a burning building?\u2019Fire trucks and firefighters arrived immediately. With the loud siren sound, the surroundings became even more chaotic. In such a crowded place, it became difficult to understand the target\u2019s behaviour. Kim Woo-jin glanced at Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s profile, who seemed to have no intention of escaping, and fell back. He thought it would be better to move around and watch.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd now.Kim Woo-jin muttered in despair, \u201cWhat are you doing, you bastard?\u201dAcross the street from the burning building. Kim Woo-jin, standing on the roof of a four-story shopping mall, was currently filming Han Yi-gyeol with a mobile phone video.Han Yi-gyeol, who floated in the air using the power of the wind, was helping put out the fire by moving the stream of water from the hose, or floating firefighters like himself in the air to enter the building through the window. Thanks to Han Yi-gyeol, the fire was quickly extinguished. A woman holding a child who barely escaped from the building thanked Han Yi-gyeol.\u201cTsk.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who took an accurate picture of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s shy smile, sent the saved video to Cheon Sa-yeon. He finished the transfer and checked the time, it was 1:50. The estimated time for Cha Soo-yeon to leave the gate was 3 o\u2019clock. Even now, you had to move quickly to arrive on time, but the slow bastard who couldn\u2019t understand the situation was useless and wasted time\u2026\u201cHi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dHearing the familiar voice coming right behind him, he turned around but was grabbed by the collar. Kim Woo-jin, who raised his head in panic, saw Han Yi-gyeol, who had just been flirting by the building across from him.\u201cWh-what!\u201d\u201cDid you have a good look?\u201d Han Yi-gyeol asked in a soft voice and smiled slightly. His brown hair glistened in the sunlight and fluttered in the wind.\u201cDamn it, what are you doing?\u201d After a brief moment of embarrassment, Kim Woo-jin quickly regained consciousness and shook off Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s hand. Not scared. He was a little surprised, yes, but it was Han Yi-gyeol.\u201cHey, I don\u2019t know who you think you are, but if you grab someone by the neck like that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must have been very surprised.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI wonder how surprised you must have been to unactivate your ability?\u201d Han Yi-gyeol said calmly, \u201cRight? Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt was creepy, he had goosebumps all over his body. Damn it! He was so surprised when he was grabbed by the neck that he lost his concentration. Kim Woo-jin, who was hastily examining his abilities, soon turned pale.\u201cDid I get you?\u201dThe ability\u2026 was activated. He had never turned it off. Han Yi-gyeol was making fun of him. This Han Yi-gyeol\u2026\u201cThis bastard!\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s body, rushing in anger, flew into the air. As Han Yi-gyeol lifted his finger, his upper body slid over the roof railing. If Han Yi-gyeol lost his powers as it was, he would fall off the building without any time to save himself. Kim Woo-jin, realizing the situation, desperately struggled to get out, but the wind around his body only roughly scratched his skin.\u201cLet me go, you bastard! What the hell are you pulling this shit for?\u201d\u201cJust putting the shameless little spy in his place.\u201dKim Woo-jin was very confused about this situation. Where the hell did the Han Yi-gyeol, who usually trembled and cried in front of him, go? The man in front of him was like a completely different person, with only the same face.He didn\u2019t know what the hell happened. Could it be that he deceived everyone with his acting skills comparable to that of a Hollywood actor? Or was someone really possessing Han Yi-gyeol?Most importantly of all, how should he explain this situation to his cold-hearted boss?\u201cWhat did you do after following me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTell me the truth and I will release you.\u201dKim Woo-jin thought about it for a while, but he decided that it would be better to answer honestly. He got caught early and couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201cVideo! I made a video!\u201d\u201cWhat video?\u201d\u201cOf you putting out the fire! Is it okay now? Shit, release your powers!\u201dHan Yi-gyeol, who only shrugged his shoulders, ignoring Kim Woo-jin\u2019s harsh swear words, reached out to Woo-jin. The wind that attacked Kim Woo-jin\u2019s skin turned into a gentle breeze in front of Han Yi-gyeol.Han Yi-gyeol casually rummaged through Kim Woo-jin\u2019s pockets and took his cell phone, tapped it a few times, and then threw it to the floor.\u2018Damn it, to do that to someone else\u2019s precious phone!\u2019Regardless of Kim Woo-jin grinding his teeth, Han Yi-gyeol said with a sad expression, \u201cHuh\u2026 I can\u2019t do anything about the video you\u2019ve already sent. But that\u2019s it. Go back because there\u2019ll be nothing else to see if you follow me any longer.\u201dKim Woojin\u2019s body was dragged inward and rolled down the roof like his cell phone.\u201cThis crazy\u2026 are you really saying that now?\u201d\u201cYou sent him a video, so that\u2019s enough. The kidnapping of Cha Soo-yeon will proceed as planned, so there is no need to follow.\u201d\u201cIs that even possible!\u201d\u201cWhat would be impossible? All you have to do is report that Han Yi-gyeol kidnapped Cha Soo-yeon as ordered.\u201dHe knew why Kim Woo-jin was following him. Han Yi-gyeol, who only thought of and spoke of finding his little sister, was actually quick-witted.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, tell the truth: \u2018I got caught and couldn\u2019t help it.\u2019 I don\u2019t care.\u201dOf course he couldn\u2019t. After adding that, Han Yi-gyeol smiled brightly. Han Yi-gyeol, who looked away from Kim Woo-jin and checked the time on his cell phone, continued.\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand the situation\u2026 Me telling you to not follow me isn\u2019t advice; it\u2019s an order. You can try following me like a dog one more time, if threats won\u2019t stop you.\u201dWith those words, Han Yi-gyeol turned his back without any regrets. Kim Woo-jin, who was left alone on the roof, could not catch him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was a coincidence that I thought of Kim Woo-jin.There was no other character who spoke like Kim Woo-jin in the novel, and the guy\u2019s ability came to mind when I felt someone following me from a certain distance.After waking up in Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, the only time I met Kim Woo-jin was when I went to see Cheon Sa-yeon. Kim Woo-jin, who was arguing with me in the hallway, was memorable in many ways and I remembered him clearly.Above all, Kim Woo-jin was the only attendant who followed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s orders with the ability to follow suit. He appeared several times in the novel, most of the time as the main character\u2019s watchdog.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s ability to \u2018blur his presence\u2019 was a skill that was so useful that even the SS-ranked protagonist, who was much more sensitive than the general public, couldn\u2019t sense him properly.If I hadn\u2019t known Kim Woo-jin\u2019s abilities in advance, I would have thought the person behind me was an ordinary person.\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand the situation\u2026 Me telling you to not follow me isn\u2019t advice; it\u2019s an order. You can try following me like a dog one more time, if threats won\u2019t stop you.\u201dIf Kim Woo-jin hadn\u2019t gotten any information on me, there would have been no use in threatening him, but he had sent a video of me helping put out the fire. Anyway, the reason why Cheon Sa-yeon had Kim Woo-jin follow me was to see what kind of action I would take after a sudden change. There was no meaning beyond that.As ordered, I would kidnap Cha Soo-yeon, and the protagonist would come rescue her. If the plan did not go awry, it was clear that Cheon Sa-yeon would cut off his interest in me again.\u2018It should be like that, so there should be no problem.\u2019It\u2019s just that it\u2019s bothersome that Cheon Sa-yeon became interested in me for no reason. I decided to get away from him, so I had to find a way out from now on while Cheon Sa-yeon was interested in me\u2026 Just imagining it was terrifying.I got out of the building where Kim Woo-jin was and immediately caught a taxi. When I told him to go to the gate of the G7 area, the driver asked with a smile, \u201cOh! Do you also have an ability? If not, at that G7 place, isn\u2019t there a Red Fire something or other there?\u201d\u201cYes. \u2018The Empress of Red Flames\u2019, Cha Soo-yeon. I\u2019m in the same guild,\u201d I lied shamelessly.\u201cWooow~ then what\u2019s your ability, young man?\u201d\u201cEh, I\u2019m nothing impressive. At the guild, I just process paperwork.\u201dWhen I answered with an awkward smile, the driver said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and smiled with me.* * *After 40 minutes, the taxi stopped. As I got out of the taxi, I sighed at the sight of the crowd, which was much larger than I had seen on the news. How would I get Cha Soo-yeon out of there?Cha Soo-yeon, who was called the \u2018Empress of Red Flames,\u2019 was an A-rank belonging to the Jayna Guild (\uc81c\uc774\ub098 \uae38\ub4dc). Cha Soo-yeon, who could handle fire like Han Yi-gyeol handled wind, was one of the representative talents in Korea who had attracted many followers with her strong power and beautiful appearance.I looked at the gate shining blue through the crowds. Like the Milky Way, black and dark blue were mixed at random, and the oval-shaped gate sparkled. Beyond that, there were a lot of vicious monsters out there that would kill any ordinary person immediately.As described in the novel, gates appeared 20 years ago. Gates that appeared suddenly from all over the world began to spit out monsters, and in an instant, threw the world into chaos.Six months after the gate appeared, ordinary people awakened one by one. Those who became ability users teamed up and went beyond the gate to subdue monsters by killing all the monsters, known as a \u2018clear\u2019.The gate had to be cleared once every two months to prevent monsters from overflowing the gate, and ability users established a guild to manage the gate.Many people were enthusiastic about ability users, who saved the world from ferocious monsters. This was an era when you could grab wealth and fame at once if you had the ability.\u2018But Han Yi-gyeol\u2026\u2019No matter how much I thought about it, I just couldn\u2019t understand why he would let his life be controlled by someone like Cheon Sa-yeon. If it were me, I would have let my abilities be recognized earlier and I would have made a lot of money and lived comfortably. No, even if I didn\u2019t catch a monster, Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s abilities were highly useful, so wherever I went, I wouldn\u2019t starve to death.\u201cWhoa!\u201d\u201cThe Empress of Red Flames!\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi! Please take a moment for an interview!\u201dAs I looked up at the clear sky and lamented Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s life, the surroundings became noisy. It seemed that Cha Soo-yeon came out of the gate. I was swept away by the crowds from behind and approached Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cThank you for waiting. The G7 area gate has just been cleared. All of the team members who came with me are safe and there were no problems inside the gate.\u201dCha Soo-yeon\u2019s voice responded to the interview. Cha Soo-yeon skillfully led the interview without showing a sign of surprise even when she saw the crowd. I listened to the interview in the middle of the crowd, but once I got through the crowd, I got out of the back. Far from kidnapping Cha Soo-yeon in that crowd, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to speak.I thought about how to take out Cha Soo-yeon, who was surrounded by people. I couldn\u2019t see a single hair. I thought about using my abilities but soon changed my mind.\u2018In the end, this is the only way in these cases.\u2019After waiting for a while on purpose, I ran straight to Cha Soo-yeon, who was getting out of the crowd after finishing the interview.\u201cCha Soo-yeon\u00a0seonbaenim\u00a0(senior)!\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who was about to get into the car parked on the road, turned her head to my cry. I walked over to her with the most innocuous smile I could ever see.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cGood morning! It\u2019s an honor to meet you! Ah, I am a newcomer to the Roheon Guild.\u201dThe Roheon Guild was the guild that the main character belonged to. At my words, Cha Soo-yeon naturally thought of the main character, so she made a friendly face.\u201cAre you new to the Roheon Guild? You have an ability?\u201d\u201cYeah. But I\u2019m not as good as Cha Soo-yeon\u00a0seonbaenim. My name is Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dCha Soo-yeon gladly took the hand I stretched out shyly and carefully.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cMe too! I really like you,\u00a0Seonbaenim. I\u2019m a fan. Ah! Is it okay if I call you \u2018seonbaenim\u2019?\u201d\u201cOf course. You belong to the Roheon Guild? Did the Roheon Guild get new ability users this time\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018cause I was cast on the street.\u201d *\u201cAah.\u201dFortunately for my quick thinking, Cha Soo-yeon nodded her head without any doubt. Contrary to her harsh impression, this person was pure. Right now, my appearance was truly award-winning.\u201cBut what did you come here for?\u201d\u201cNothing else\u2026\u201dI deliberately took a breather and lowered my voice.\u201cActually, I came here to convey an important message to\u00a0Seonbaenim.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDo you have any other plans afterward?\u201dWhen asked in a whisper, Cha Soo-yeon gave a bewildered expression on her face, but she answered faithfully, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dWhen I was truly relieved, a strong curiosity flashed in Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s eyes. Just for what reason would I be wasting time for? At this point, I felt that she had enough, so I smiled softly and brought out my main point.\u201c\u2026\u2019He\u2019 said he had reserved a high-class restaurant, and he gave me the precious task of bringing Cha Soo-yeon.\u201d\u201cHe\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Ha Tae-heon\u00a0seonbaenim.\u201dWhen Cha Soo-yeon heard his name, her eyes widened, and her cheeks immediately reddened. As she looked at me, her face was full of confusion, but she couldn\u2019t hide her anticipation nonetheless. She must really like him. My conscience hurt a bit.\u201cI\u2014really? Taeheon-ssi?\u201d\u201cYeah, really.\u201d\u201cBut why didn\u2019t he text or call\u2026\u201dI grinned.\u201cHe is in a meeting now. It was a meeting that suddenly came up and overlapped with Cha Soo-yeon\u00a0seonbaenim\u2019s gate clearing time, so he sent me as quickly as possible. He said he would come to the restaurant right after the meeting.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dCha Soo-yeon\u2019s cheeks turned even more red and she nodded her head. It was a look that meant she really liked him. She loved him so much. My conscience, which I had lost long ago, kept shaking my heart**. If the situation allowed me, I would\u2019ve confessed it was a lie to get rid of this feeling.Ha Tae-heon. He was the only main character in the novel \u2018Abyss\u2019.He was a handsome man who saved countless women and received their love. He had a handsome face (\uc5bc\uad74 \ud6e4\uce60\ud558\uc9c0), good ability, perfect personality, was quick-witted\u2014he was a man who had it all. Cheon Sa-yeon had a perfect face, abilities, and was quick-witted, but didn\u2019t he lack humanity? On the other hand, Ha Tae-heon was someone befitting the main character role.\u201cWhere should I go?\u201d\u201cI will guide you there,\u201d I quickly got into the driver\u2019s seat and answered boldly.Even though the driver\u2019s seat was taken away unexpectedly, Cha Soo-yeon sat in the passenger seat without saying anything. From the look on her face, she seemed to be half-conscious.\u201cI\u2019ll start driving now.\u201dAfter carefully fastening Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s seat belt, the car started. It was a lie I brought out to kidnap Cha Soo-yeon with no effort, and even if I could turn back time, I would do the same thing\u2026 I sighed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Taeheon-ssi\u2026 How did he look?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dAs soon as I started the car, Cha Soo-yeon asked me a question.How did he look? I\u2019d never met him so I don\u2019t know.Seemingly to test me, Cha Soo-yeon added, \u201cI heard that he visited the gate in China a while ago. I was wondering if he was hurt or not.\u201d\u201cAah.\u201d\u2026did something like that happen? Ha Tae-heon travelled abroad very often from the beginning to the end of the novel, so I couldn\u2019t remember the exact schedule. The reason he went out often was that the Roheon Guild Master took Ha Tae-heon whenever the Master travelled abroad\u2026 Of course, the guild master was a woman, as she was a character in a male novel.I laughed softly.\u201cOf course. He came back in good health. It\u2019s hard to get hurt if you have the ability like Ha Tae-heon\u00a0seonbaenim.\u201d\u201cIt is. I heard that he went with the Roheon Guild Master.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dIt was then that I realized the meaning hidden in the question.\u201cUm, I think\u2026 Ha Tae-heon\u00a0seonbaenim\u00a0seems to think of Master as just a good leader. You get what I mean, right?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Honestly, sharing personal feelings with the boss is a bit\u2026 It\u2019s not easy, is it? It\u2019s not bad though. It just doesn\u2019t seem like it would be easy to choose someone to date with Ha Tae-heon\u00a0seonbaenim\u2019s personality.\u201d\u201cDoes it look like that?\u201d\u201cBecause he\u2019s so serious.\u201dAt my words, Cha Soo-yeon blushed slightly and smiled. Her expression was much brighter than before. Apparently, Cha Soo-yeon was very concerned about Ha Tae-heon\u2019s departure to China with the Roheon Master.Well, that was only natural. Even if you said it was for work, the fact remained that he still went abroad with another woman. As if she had gained confidence at my words, Cha Soo-yeon clenched her fist and made a determined expression. What are you determined to do?The car pulled out of the suburbs and started driving down to the quiet road. While I was driving, I continued the conversation so that Cha Soo-yeon did not have any doubts. It was very easy. If it was related to Ha Tae-heon, Cha Soo-yeon listened to me with her twinkling eyes.About an hour after we got in the car, I looked out the window to see if Cha Soo-yeon had finally become anxious. I smiled awkwardly, pretending to be embarrassed.\u201cIt\u2019s a restaurant that has recently become famous through a TV show, but it\u2019s a bit far away. I\u2019m sorry. Are you bored?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWe will be arriving soon though. About ten minutes left.\u201dEven if Cha Soo-yeon felt something was strange, she wouldn\u2019t be able to make a hasty judgment. The restaurant was marked on the GPS and I shared various information about Ha Tae-heon. As I expected, Cha Soo-yeon only nodded her head, and she didn\u2019t ask any questions.The car drove without stopping and arrived at the restaurant. I said to Cha Soo-yeon, turning off the navigation system that said we had arrived at our destination.\u201cJust a moment, please. There is a parking lot behind the building, so I will park there first.\u201dI kept driving the car, looking around, pretending to find a parking lot. When I passed the restaurant and came to the real \u201cdestination\u201d about 50m away, I stopped the car.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived. You can get off now.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dWhen I got out of the car without hesitation, Cha Soo-yeon also got out.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a place to park\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon looked around and muttered. That was right. There were only a lot of trees and grass around, and it didn\u2019t look like the restaurant\u2019s parking lot. Instead of answering, I sighed and used my power. When I lifted my finger, Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s body floated about 10 meters in the air.Cha Soo-yeon looked down at me with a bewildered face as she let out an \u201cAck\u201d.\u201cWhat are you doing all of a sudden? Put me down right now!\u201d\u201cSorry. Actually, I\u2019ve been ordered to kidnap you.\u201d\u201cWhat? Kidnap?\u201d Cha Soo-yeon asked, still bewildered.Well of course. This was probably the first time in her life she was kidnapped.\u201cYou can swear. But if possible, I wish you would have cursed the person who ordered it rather than me.\u201d\u201c\u2026stop joking around and put me down immediately.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Still, I think my plan was pretty good to you, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi. Would you like to hear it?\u201d\u201cLet me down!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dCha Soo-yeon twisted her face. I quietly faced the intensely angry gaze.\u201cI warned you.\u201dAs Cha Soo-yeon swung her arms wide, flames burst out. I quickly wrapped the flame with wind and threw it to the ground to prevent the wood from catching fire.\u201cCalm down. Fire is dangerous here.\u201d\u201cShut up! I don\u2019t know what your intentions are, but I have no intention of ever getting caught. If I had known\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I have no intention of catching Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA few more fires flew from Cha Soo-yeon, but I threw them all on the ground like before. Fortunately, Cha Soo-yeon did not put heart into the attack, so the fire was quickly put out.\u201cDon\u2019t mess around. Obviously, you said it with your own mouth\u2026\u201d\u201cI said I was ordered to kidnap, but I don\u2019t really mean to kidnap. Now, isn\u2019t this an invitation for smooth communication rather than kidnapping?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, you crazy bastard!\u201dWhen I said it shamelessly, Cha Soo-yeon cursed me. She knew how to curse? This was news to me.\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke; it\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to do anything harsh either. My heart is softer than I look. If it\u2019s possible, I just want things to go smoothly, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not kidnapping me, turn off your ability immediately.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bit\u2026 I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be attacked. It\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019m a bit softhearted, you know?\u201dAs I shrugged my shoulders, Cha Soo-yeon made an annoyed face. That was a bit much. I was a little hurt because the atmosphere was so different from when we were talking about Ha Tae-heon.\u201cSince we\u2019ve come this far, let\u2019s hear some suggestions. With your cooperation, we can finish talking in two hours.\u201d\u201c\u2026how can I trust you?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just trust me in this situation where I am dealing with you alone? Cha Soo-yeon knows that it will be difficult for me to win if Cha Soo-yeon attacks seriously.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis was half a lie. Although Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s ability was never inferior to Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s, it was also true that it was not easy in terms of experience. If I collided with Cha Soo-yeon with all her might, we would both be seriously injured.\u201cIf you are willing to listen to my offer, I will release my ability.\u201dCha Soo-yeon frowned at my words and pondered. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t easy to convince her.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think hard. Isn\u2019t it okay to listen to suggestions?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you hear my offer and don\u2019t like it even then, I won\u2019t hold you here any longer. But, if you help, I\u2019ll give you an item as a token of appreciation. How about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026haa, I see. I understand. I\u2019ll listen to you, so release your powers right now.\u201dThe wind was removed from Cha Soo-yeon. Cha Soo-yeon, who landed with an easy movement, looked at me with a somewhat uncomfortable expression.\u201cPlease don\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s not really a big deal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal but you\u2019ve brought me all the way here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a bit of a pacifist.\u201dIt was not easy to kidnap a famous person like Cha Soo-yeon without the use of violence or drugs. Still, the reason I made this choice was because Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s cooperation was essential in order to proceed as planned.\u201cOkay, tell me what your offer is.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI pondered for a while on where to begin and then said the most important content.\u201cI will lure Ha Tae-heon this way.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCha Soo-yeon was shocked. Her happiness upon hearing Ha Tae-heon\u2019s name in the car couldn\u2019t compare to her angry expression now. Was this the wrong thing to say?\u201cDid you do this because Taeheon-ssi\u00a0was your goal? What are you going to do to Taeheon-ssi!\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll never cooperate with you! I\u2019d rather subdue you here\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201dI think it was too much to bring out the main point. I sighed, waving my hands in denial.\u201cTo be precise, my purpose is to prevent Ha Tae-heon from going \u2018there\u2019.\u201d\u201cExplain it properly.\u201d\u201cDid you know there is a gate-related meeting at the management headquarters at 5 o\u2019clock today?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the new gate assignment meeting?\u201d\u201cYes. If I\u2019m right, the new gate will be transferred to the Roheon Guild. The Gate Clear Team will, of course, consist of Ha Tae-heon as the representative, so Ha Tae-heon should also attend the meeting.\u201d\u201c\u2026It can\u2019t be that you\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m going to call Ha Tae-heon over here to prevent him from attending the meeting. That is my goal.\u201dTo be precise, it was Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s goal. He coveted the new gate this time, and used Han Yi-gyeol and Ha Tae-heon at the same time to prevent it from falling into the Roheon Guild\u2019s hands.There was a reason Cheon Sa-yeon, who was not interested in which guild took the gate, was interested in this gate.\u2018The world\u2019s first SS rank weapon. It came out of this gate.\u2019Normally, various grades of monsters appeared in the gate, and the gate grade was assigned based on the grade of the monster, but the gate where the \u2018boss\u2019 monster appeared was different.\u201cBosses\u201d were monsters that dropped weapons or weapon materials upon death, and the gate grade varied depending on the boss monster\u2019s rank. If the gate contained several B-class monsters and S-class boss monsters, it was determined as an S-class gate.Also, the grade of obtainable items were determined by the tank of the boss monster, and the higher the rank, the greater the material and attack power of the weapon.The highest level of boss gates that appeared in Korea so far was S-class. There were 5 A-class gates, and 2 S-class gates.But this time, the world\u2019s first SS-class gate appeared.The gate where the boss monster appeared was indistinguishable from the outside, so you must go inside. However, Cheon Sa-yeon knew that this new gate was an SS-class gate, and would surely take ownership of the gate to obtain SS-class weapons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is a possibility, but it\u2019s rather low. About 10%?\u201d\u201cWhat? So, there is a 90% chance that Taeheon-ssi\u00a0will come?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dI lifted my head and looked up at the building that smelled of cement.The abandoned building, which had been demolished, was barren. This abandoned building was accidentally discovered by Ha Tae-heon in the novel, and was useful in various situations. For example, catching and interrogating a cannon fodder villain.The abandoned building was discovered later so the only person who knew of it was me. The first person to find it is the owner.\u201c\u2026why are you so sure?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dCha Soo-yeon looked at me with complicated eyes as I looked around the abandoned building.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you expected it like that, but honestly, I\u2019m not that close with Taeheon-ssi.\u201d Cha Soo-yeon frowned and blushed. \u201cOf course, I love Taeheon-ssi\u2026 I think of him like that, but he doesn\u2019t seem to think the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only met him twice in person. I\u2019ll cooperate with you, but I think Taeheon-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cWill come.\u201dIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand what Cha Soo-yeon meant. If I hadn\u2019t read the novel, I would never have made a plan like this.\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t come, absolutely no harm will come to you, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi. You can hit me with all your anger. We\u2019d need a plausible excuse for the kidnapping to fail anyway.\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d\u201cI believe in Ha Taeheon-ssi. He will definitely come,\u201d I answered firmly on purpose.If Cha Soo-yeon became unsure now, it would mean all my efforts were for nothing. With a soft smile, I began to speak so that I could persuade Cha Soo-yeon, \u201cTrust Ha Tae-heon. Do you think he\u2019d turn away from Cha Soo-yeon-ssi,\u00a0who is in danger? Absolutely not, in my opinion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd Ha Tae-heon has already saved Cha Soo-yeon before, right? Ha Tae-heon is that kind of person.\u201dCha Soo-yeon\u2019s eyes shook. Cha Soo-yeon, who looked at me with her mouth slightly open, quickly averted her gaze and her ears turned red. I was puzzled by the strange reaction, but I didn\u2019t bother to point it out.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d Cha Soo-yeon nodded her head. \u201cThen what should I do now?\u201d\u201cPlease call Ha Tae-heon. When he answers the phone, tell him to help you. It would be nice if you could pretend to be scared, but\u2026 it\u2019s enough if you just say it well.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe took her cell phone out of the combat leather jacket she was wearing. Staring at the screen with a nervous expression, she pressed the call button desperately as if she had made up her mind.Trululu\u2014 Trululu\u2014As the ringing tone got longer, Cha Soo-yeon pursed her lips nervously. Until 20 seconds passed, Ha Tae-heon did not answer the phone. I didn\u2019t show it, but inside I was a little embarrassed. Has he already entered the meeting?Click.[Hello. This is Ha Tae-heon.]The moment I became anxious, the call was finally connected. A slightly low-key, very business-like voice was heard. My heart fluttered for a moment when I heard the main character\u2019s voice for the first time. What a good voice.\u201cH-hey, how are you?\u201d[Cha Soo-yeon-ssi?]Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s voice trembled as if she was more nervous than she looked. I nodded my head to Cha Soo-yeon, who was not sure what to do, with the meaning to not worry. Seeing me like that, Cha Soo-yeon closed her eyes tightly and opened her mouth.\u201cH-he\u2026\u201d[Pardon?]\u201cHelp\u2014help me please, Taeheon-ssi\u2026!\u201dIt was almost like a scream.Good. Cha Soo-yeon, whose face was so red, smiled, and handed over her cell phone.[Hello? Cha Soo-yeon-ssi? What happened?]Perhaps he was surprised by Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s sudden request for help, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s voice tone rose slightly.[Cha Soo-yeon-ssi!]\u201cGood morning,\u201d I greeted Ha Tae-heon without hiding my smile.Ha Tae-heon, who heard my voice instead of Cha Soo-yeon, spoke after a brief pause. His voice was much lower and harsher than before.[\u2026who are you?]\u201cIf you\u2019re curious, could you come over here now? I\u2019m taking good care of Cha Soo-yeon.\u201d[Cha Sooyeon-ssi, put her on the phone right now.]\u201cIt\u2019s a bit\u2026 Cha Sooyeon-ssi\u2019s condition is not good right now.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. It was because Cha Soo-yeon shook her head with a pale face at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s words.[If you don\u2019t change to her right away, you\u2019ll regret it.]I looked at Cha Soo-yeon again. Cha Soo-yeon shook her head more strongly. It seemed she didn\u2019t want to receive it. Well, acting kidnapped isn\u2019t easy.\u201cNo\u2026 She\u2019s not really in a position to receive it,\u201d I answered with a little more sincerity.[Ha\u2026 Where?]\u201cPardon?\u201d[Where do I go?] Ha Tae-heon became irritated upon my confusion.Huh, he was going to come. Success! Although Ha Tae-heon seemed a little pissed off, what was more important was that it was going according to plan.\u201cYou know the Sky Restaurant, right? If you pass by the restaurant, you will find an abandoned building. That\u2019s it. The time limit is\u2026 I\u2019ll give you 50 minutes. You\u2019re not gonna be late, right?\u201d[\u2026\u2026]\u201cIt can\u2019t be that you won\u2019t come, right? You should come for Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201dTut.While talking, the call was cut off. What a cold-hearted man. As expected, the main character was arrogant. I shrugged my shoulders while returning the phone with the screen off to Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cSee. He said he was coming, right?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t even say he was coming.\u201d\u201cHe asked about the location. Then why wouldn\u2019t he come?\u201dCha Soo-yeon looked at me with doubtful eyes. That was unfair.However, unlike Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s anxiety, I\u2019d gained 100% confidence through this call. The reason was that Ha Tae-heon\u2019s attitude was exactly the same as in the novel. In fact, I had a faint memory of the first part, so I only knew that Ha Tae-heon was coming to rescue Cha Soo-yeon, but as we talked on the phone, some additional lines came to mind.\u2018The words we said on the phone match the lines in the novel.\u2019In the novel, Han Yi-gyeol and Ha Tae-heon talked on the phone. Of course, the situation was different.Originally, Han Yi-gyeol bumped into her head-on to kidnap Cha Soo-yeon. Han Yi-gyeol, who was much better at handling his abilities than I was, beat Cha Soo-yeon and dragged her away to a deserted place. Originally, it was on the roof of a closed elementary school.There, Han Yi-gyeol took Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s cell phone and called Ha Tae-heon. Then the conversation between the two was like this:* * *\u2018Are you Ha Tae-heon?\u2019\u2018\u2026who is this?\u2019\u2018If you want to save this woman, come to the place I\u2019m talking about.\u2019\u2018Put Cha Sooyeon-ssi\u00a0on the phone right now.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s not possible.\u2019\u2018If you don\u2019t change to her right away, you will regret it.\u2019\u2018If you don\u2019t come, this woman will die.\u2019\u2018Ha\u2026 Where is it?\u2019\u2018Are you coming?\u2019\u2018Where is that place?\u2019* * *Afterwards, Han Yi-gyeol lost against Ha Tae-heon, who ran over immediately, then fell down the rooftop. He would have died if he had not used a handful of skills he had saved until the end and wrapped himself in the wind. It was why I didn\u2019t choose the school roof as Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s abduction site.\u2018Looking at this, the novel was correct.\u2019Everything went so smoothly that I forgot for a moment. I brushed my hair in the back and said, \u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201dAnyway, my plan was going smoothly, and I couldn\u2019t afford to think about anything else right now.\u201cThis is important. In fact, even though I succeeded when I got Ha Tae-heon to come over, Cha Sooyeon-ssi\u00a0isn\u2019t in the same situation as me, right?\u201d\u201cI-is that so?\u201dCha Soo-yeon had been struggling as if her mind had been sold elsewhere. Why are you like that?I nodded my head. \u201cAs you know, Ha Tae-heon is a bit quick-witted, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure he thought I kidnapped Cha Soo-yeon-ssi, but if you\u2019re fine, it will look weird.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter if Ha Tae-heon takes me as a kidnapper\u2026 But if Ha Tae-heon misunderstands me and Cha Sooyeon-ssi\u00a0as accomplices\u2026\u201d Having said this, I thought for a moment\u2026 After all, it wasn\u2019t a misunderstanding, was it?\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Cha Soo-yeon responded quickly.Yeah, I guessed so. I took two things out of my pocket and showed them to Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you tell just by looking? It\u2019s a necklace and a handkerchief.\u201d\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t know? I\u2019m asking why?\u201dBefore explaining, I approached Cha Soo-yeon with the necklace. Cha Soo-yeon trembled as if surprised by my sudden approach, but surprisingly, she did not run away and looked at me. Thanks to this, I was able to hang the necklace around Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s neck without much trouble.\u201cWh-what?\u201d Cha Soo-yeon awkwardly avoided my gaze and touched the necklace.\u201cThis is a necklace I just happened to have. Let\u2019s use that.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dThe necklace was an ordinary accessory with a rather childish appearance, studded with blue jewels.\u201cAn item that blocks the wearer\u2019s spirit. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d\u201cI know. You mean \u2018shutter\u2019, right?\u201d\u201cYes. From now on, that necklace is a shutter item. Pretend you\u2019re wearing it because I tricked you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon made a strange expression again. I was starting to wonder why but it was annoying to ask.\u201cAnd with this handkerchief, I will tie Cha Sooyeon-ssi\u2019s hands behind your back. I\u2019m going to tie it up pretty strongly, but it doesn\u2019t really block your abilities anyway, so if you\u2019re in danger, burn it.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d\u201cAfter that, you can just sit on the floor.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, Cha Soo-yeon reflexively looked down at the grey cement floor and wrinkled her face.\u2026it\u2019s a little dirty.\u201c\u2026would you like me to lay out my coat?\u201d\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting on your kidnapper\u2019s clothes when you\u2019re kidnapped, would you?\u201dIn that case. I turned my attention to the necklace hanging on Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s neck.\u201cFinally\u2026 When everything is in order, crush the necklace with your feet. He might try to check if the item is real later.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s kind of a waste.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cheap anyway.\u201dIn response, I forced myself to look away from the necklace.That necklace was a gift that Han Yi-gyeol bought for his younger sister. A necklace that he bought when he still had the expectation that they would meet up one day.\u2018I don\u2019t need it anymore.\u2019Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s younger sister was dead. Therefore, the necklace was nothing but a meaningless object.\u201cOkay, the preparations are all set,\u201d I said, smiling deeply to deliberately drive the uncomfortable feeling away.\u201cNow, shall we welcome the protagonist?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You look so tired.\u201dWhen Ha Tae-heon\u2019s mood became unusual, Lee Joo-ha, who was standing next to him, asked with a worried face.\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dHa Tae-heon shook his head, but Lee Joo-ha added another word. \u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too hard and let me know if you\u2019re tired. You are more important than that gate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201dLee Joo-ha and Ha Tae-heon had just arrived at the guild management headquarters to attend a meeting to decide on the new gate affiliation. Ha Tae-heon and Lee Joo-ha entered the central hall side by side, with a furrow in his brow.\u201cBy the way, it seems like there are times when everyone gets a little greedy. Is this gate that important?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just felt like I shouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t really know, so\u2026 Taeheon, you are the SS rank here.\u201dIf an SS rank, who had better senses than most ability users, said that, there was a high probability that it was a good gate. If you were lucky, it could be a grade gate that hadn\u2019t appeared in a while.\u201cIf possible, if it\u2019s assigned to our guild, you must be the one to attend\u2026 ah.\u201dLee Joo-ha, who was talking while looking ahead, shut her mouth awkwardly. In response, Ha Tae-heon raised his head and looked at the man standing opposite him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Master Lee Joo-ha.\u201d\u201c\u2026Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dMaster of the Requiem Guild, Cheon Sa-yeon. He walked towards Lee Joo-ha and Ha Tae-heon. The bright eyes that were exposed under the soft black hair turned towards Ha Tae-heon. Beautiful eyes with thin double eyelids, sharp nose and jawline. His white skin contrasting with his dark hair was as beautiful as his name, but he had an aura that made it hard to approach him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon pretended to be familiar with Ha Tae-heon and held out his hand. Holding the big, firm-hand, unlike his beautiful face, Ha Tae-heon replied calmly, \u201cLong time no see.\u201dBzzt, energy collided between their hands. Lee Joo-ha, who was standing a short distance from them, looked anxious and felt the pulsating energy from their handshake.\u201cHmm.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon exhaled, amused, and curved his eyes.The scene of two SS ranks shaking hands in the centre hall attracted much attention. Ha Tae-heon let go of his hand first when spectators gathered around him.\u201cAre you here to attend the meeting? Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dLee Joo-ha hurriedly stepped in between the two when he let go of his hand. Compared to Lee Joo-ha, who showed a lot of discomfort, Cheon Sa-yeon was relaxed.\u201cThat\u2019s weird. You weren\u2019t interested in the gate before?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s a misunderstanding. Wouldn\u2019t any guild be greedy about the gate?\u201dHa Tae-heon squinted his eyes.\u2018What is this feeling?\u2019There wasn\u2019t only a day or two when he couldn\u2019t read Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s intentions from his expressions, but he was more concerned about it today. Ha Tae-heon tried to stay calm, restraining his arms from jumping forward.\u201cI\u2019m also curious. The Roheon guild wanted this gate so badly\u2026 Whose idea might it have been? I don\u2019t think it was Master Lee Joo-ha\u2019s.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know. What does that have to do with the Requiem Guild?\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter\u2026\u201dAt Lee Joo-ha\u2019s sharp reply, Cheon Sa-yeon blinked his eyes and tilted his head slightly. All his actions resembled a lazy predator looking down at his prey. Even Ha Tae-heon, who had not received any attention, inadvertently clenched his fists, so it was natural that Lee Joo-ha, who was lower ranked, looked pale.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no desire to give it away. I hope you understand.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201dIt was then the cell phone inside Ha Tae-heon\u2019s suit jacket began to vibrate. A vibrating sound resounded between the three of them who had fallen silent.Cheon Sa-yeon asked Ha Tae-heon with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re not picking up?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon calmly took out his cell phone. The name that appeared on the screen was Cha Soo-yeon.\u2018If it\u2019s Cha Soo-yeon\u2026 Was she the ability user from the Jayna Guild?\u2019Ha Tae-heon had saved Cha Soo-yeon from danger, and since then, he had encountered her another time, so he knew her.\u2018But why\u2026\u2019For some reason, he had a strong feeling that the person calling was not Cha Soo-yeon. After thinking about it, Ha Tae-heon slowly pressed the call button.\u201c\u2026Hello. This is Ha Tae-heon.\u201d[H-hey, how are you?]He heard a trembling voice. With his cell phone to his ear, Ha Tae-heon made eye contact with Cheon Sa-yeon.Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s smile deepened.* * *After finishing the call, Ha Tae-heon got the car key from Lee Joo-ha and left the building. Ha Tae-heon, who got into the car, drove roughly towards his destination.\u2014You know the Sky Restaurant, right? If you pass by the restaurant, you will find an abandoned building. That\u2019s it. The time limit is\u2026 I\u2019ll give you 50 minutes. You\u2019re not gonna be late, right?\u201cTsk.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who recalled the kidnapper\u2019s words, clicked his tongue as he checked his time. Only now did he understand the mysterious attitude of Cheon Sa-yeon.Cheon Sa-yeon really wanted this gate. Like Ha Tae-heon, he was an SS rank, so the chances are high that he felt something when he saw the gate this time. Ha Tae-heon smiled coolly.\u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve done such a shameful thing.\u2019He was so concerned about the gate that he didn\u2019t sense Cheon Sa-yeon making moves. The person who kidnapped Cha Soo-yeon was likely to be related to him.It was very unpleasant for him to be taken advantage of by Cheon Sa-yeon, but he had no choice since he couldn\u2019t help it. He couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to Cha Soo-yeon because he felt bad. He was also very sorry to Lee Joo-ha, who readily handed over the car key to save Cha Soo-yeon and told him to go safely.As he passed the restaurant, an abandoned building appeared as he had heard before. Ha Tae-heon, who got out of the car, frowned and sighed. The meeting had long since started. Since he wasn\u2019t present, perhaps the gate would be handed over to Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been prepared in advance. The anger that welled deep inside naturally turned to the kidnapper.Ha Tae-heon pulled his tie loosely around his neck and walked into the old building. The sound of his shoes hitting the hard cement floor echoed through the old building.\u201cT-Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dUpon entering the large space in the centre of the abandoned building, Cha Soo-yeon, who was sitting on the floor with her hands tied, called Ha Tae-heon.\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cYou really are here.\u201dHa Tae-heon quickly looked over Cha Soo-yeon. Fortunately, everything was fine, except that she was wearing a necklace that he had never seen before. She didn\u2019t even look hurt or exhausted.Cha Soo-yeon was an A-ranked person. She was one of the top-ranked people with a fire ability. She was so strong that even a normal person could not even get close to her. But she was tied up helplessly\u2026 Ha Tae-heon looked at the necklace. It might be a shutter item.Cha Soo-yeon could run away by just loosening the necklace. Ha Tae-heon thought so and took a step forward.\u201cHello.\u201d A man who came down from the open ceiling greeted him with a friendly voice.\u2018I couldn\u2019t sense him\u2026 He is at least an A-rank.\u2019Ha Tae-heon looked at his opponent with an expressionless face.\u201cYou arrived with a minute left. That\u2019s great.\u201dThe man checked the time on his cell phone and smiled. His thin brown hair fluttered in the wind, and his brown eyes shimmered under long eyelashes. His pretty face and harmonious features gave off a neat atmosphere rather than a flashy one.Recognizing the voice he heard on the phone matched the voice of the man perfectly, Ha Tae-heon slowly began to use his ability. Since he came all the way here in the first place, he had no intention to take only Cha Soo-yeon back.\u201cAs you can see, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u2026 oh, wait a minute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSomething black began to gather around Ha Tae-heon. It was one of his two abilities. The ability to attract dust and transform it into the desired material. The black dust gathered in Ha Tae-heon\u2019s grasp and soon took shape. As soon as he held the black longsword in his hand from start to finish, Ha Tae-heon swung his sword with tremendous speed.Boom!\u201cThis crazy\u2014!\u201dThe place where the man had just stood was shattered, as if a bomb exploded, by Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sword. The man, who managed to avoid the sword, flew into the air and shouted, \u201cWait! You\u2019re rather impatient. Let\u2019s talk!\u201d\u201cNoisy,\u201d Ha Tae-heon responded with a cold voice and swung his sword once more.\u00a0Kwaang, the wall cracked, spreading cement powder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHow did this happen?The emotion I felt when I first met Ha Tae-heon was surprisingly pleasant.One way or another, he was the main character of the novel that I enjoyed reading. He was a very strong, righteous, and cool protagonist.I\u2019ve been poor all of my life. For me, \u2018Abyss\u2019 was the novel of its genre I encountered. Until then, I couldn\u2019t read books very often, and even if I did, they were all too boring and difficult to understand.\u2018This is fun.\u2019It was the first time I realized that books and stories could be so much fun. It felt natural to put down the first book and immediately pick up the second book.I read the story with a heart supporting Ha Tae-heon. When he got hurt, I frowned unconsciously, and when he smiled happily, I felt at ease.I was jealous of Ha Tae-heon. If I had that kind of power, would I have been able to live a different life?\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re really here.\u201dAs expected, Ha Tae-heon looked at Cha Soo-yeon as soon as he arrived. No injuries, no fear, no exhaustion. He was relieved only after checking everything.He came just before attending the meeting, had dark brown, half-curly hair and was dressed in a black suit. His broad shoulders and his scarred hands beneath the sleeves of his shirt showed how much effort he had honed since his awakening.I knew everything because I read it.\u201cHello.\u201dI stepped in at the right time and greeted Ha Tae-heon. His black eyes turned to me.\u201cAs you can see, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u2014\u201c\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was great up until this point.Ha Tae-heon suddenly used his ability. Dust glistening with black colour quickly gathered, creating a black sword. There was no time to be moved by the fact that I saw the main character using his ability, which I had only experienced in the novel before. A chill ran down my spine. Instinctively, I leaned my head back and used my ability.Boom!\u201cThis crazy\u2014!\u201dThe place I was just now was horribly broken. I hurriedly shouted at the injustice, \u201cWait! You\u2019re rather impatient. Let\u2019s talk!\u201d\u201cNoisy.\u201dMaybe because he was the main character, the way he talked was cool.My heart kept beating even though it wasn\u2019t the time for this. You\u2019d have to be like\u00a0that\u00a0to be the main character. That was really cool. I narrowly avoided the sword that was rushing at me once again.\u201cUgh, believe it or not, I didn\u2019t even touch Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u2019s hair!\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of nerve as a kidnapper.\u201dShamelessness was my charm.I took a step back and distanced myself from Ha Tae-heon. I thought if he attacked again, I could dodge it at least once.\u201cThere is a reason why I used Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u00a0to call you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d\u201cAah.\u201d I let out a sigh as I swept my hair back. Of course, I didn\u2019t expect you to be willing to listen to me\u2026\u2018Somehow, Ha Tae-heon is more aggressive than planned. What\u2019s wrong with him? Did he meet Cheon Sa-yeon before?\u2019I said with a bitter smile, \u201cAs you may have noticed\u2026 I was ordered, too. For me, bringing Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u00a0as safely as possible was the limit.\u201d\u201c\u2026what\u2019s your relationship with Master Cheon Sa-yeon? Are you a member of the Requiem Guild?\u201d\u201cHaha, no way.\u201dThose who belonged to the guild couldn\u2019t do this kind of dirty work. Guild members had to live in more rigorous procedures than civilians, with the detailed personal information registered in the country.Han Yi-gyeol did not belong to any guild as he had to fulfil any orders from Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are independent. I just have to catch you and figure it out slowly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little\u2026 I\u2019d like to say no.\u201dAs I reflexively recalled the contents of the novel about how cruel Ha Tae-heon was to villains, I broke into a cold sweat.\u201cThen how about we do this? If the reason why I brought you here is worth it, please let it slide.\u201d\u201cI have said I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d\u201cYou will regret it.\u201dAs I said that playfully, Ha Tae-heon tapped the floor a couple of times with the tip of his sword. No matter how much I looked at it, it was a gesture of thinking about how to deal with me, so I immediately gave up my plan to take more time and opened my mouth.\u201cYou know that this gate is pretty special, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you did this.\u201d\u201cIf you could get an item with a similar value to that gate, what would you do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon frowned and looked at me coldly. Wow, your eyes are no joke.\u201cAs I said before, this is just a deal. I\u2019ll tell you how to get the item, so please do me a favour later. Please let me off the hook today.\u201d\u201cHow can I trust you?\u201dWith those words, I sat quietly and glanced at Cha Soo-yeon, who was watching us. You asked the same question as Cha Soo-yeon. Did Han Yi-gyeol look like a fraud? From my point of view, he looked so kind, better than other people in the world.\u201cWell\u2026 I can\u2019t force you. But if possible, it would be better to try it once. Even if you beat me and dragged me here, I won\u2019t tell you about the item\u2026 Even if I was locked up, it would be quite annoying if my boss comes looking for me.\u201dI told half a lie.\u00a0If my boss comes looking for me. I didn\u2019t know anything else, but if it was the original story, he (CSY) was a son of a bitch who would not blink even if I died.Ha Tae-heon looked at me with a complicated gaze. Probably he was a little shaken by my persuasion. The only chance was now. I turned my head towards Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi? Aren\u2019t I right?\u201dGo ahead and support my opinion. I also lent you a necklace for your love. Cha Soo-yeon, who flinched from my blazing eyes, nodded her head in a hurry.\u201cI-I think so. Since you\u2019re getting an item, even if you\u2019re deceived\u2026\u201d\u201cItem grade is at least S-class!\u201d\u201cOh my!\u201d Cha Soo-yeon widened her eyes and supported me more actively. \u201cIt\u2019s an S-class item! You can\u2019t miss it, Taeheon-ssi! S-class items are really hard to get!\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who was very excited, looked at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sigh and curled up her tail.\u201cOh, no\u2026 It\u2019s just in my opinion\u2026 Of course, the decision should be made by Taeheon-ssi\u00a0because it\u2019s Taeheon-ssi\u2019s item\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAren\u2019t you giving up too easily?Ha Tae-heon, who stood still with his sword and pondered for a while, walked up to me with a determined expression on his face. The way he walked was as cool as a model.\u2018What? Are you going to say yes?\u2019I was a little scared, but I didn\u2019t back down and looked at him. If Ha Tae-heon had attempted to attack, he would have swung his sword earlier. Ha Tae-heon liked fair fights like a main character would, so coming close like this was for conversation.Thud!\u201cGeugh!\u201dA strong force hit the left side of my face. My vision flickered and my body, which was out of balance, crashed to the floor.\u00a0Beep\u2014a sharp ringing sound filled my ears from the pain.\u201cI accept the deal. But there will be no service. Now, that was the price of kidnapping Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dCovering my throbbing face with my hand, I smiled in dismay. Somehow I felt betrayed. The bitterness spread through my mouth and I spat out blood along with my saliva. Fortunately, it was only torn, and my gums and teeth were fine. It was thanks to reflexively biting the molars tightly, remembering the days when I was beaten a long time ago.Looking down at me coldly, Ha Tae-heon turned around and approached Cha Soo-yeon. Ha Tae-heon, who released Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s tied hands, also took out the necklace on her neck. The blue jewel in the centre of the necklace glistened.Ha Tae-heon dropped the necklace on the floor and stepped on it mercilessly with his shoes.\u00a0Crack, the necklace was crushed and the jewel was broken.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSeeing the horribly broken necklace, I groaned unconsciously. All of a sudden, I felt nauseous and nervous.\u201cUm, yes\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who was not sure what to do while looking at the necklace and me, nodded her head hard and followed Ha Tae-heon. After watching their backs for a moment as they left the abandoned building, I slowly got up. The place where I was hit was my face, but my whole body ached.I put more strength in my throbbing knees and staggered as I stumbled to the front of the necklace. A broken necklace lying on the dirty floor caught my eyes. I reached out my hand and lifted the necklace as carefully as I could, but the shattered blue jewel couldn\u2019t hold it and fell down. The centre of the necklace, which was embedded with jewels, was empty.Clatter, clatter.As I stared blankly at the necklace, I heard the distant footsteps again. Looking back, Ha Tae-heon, dressed in a white shirt, was standing with his suit jacket off and draped over his arm.\u201c\u2026you came back.\u201dI smiled slightly and hid the necklace in my hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed that Cha Soo-yeon was sent away first and he came back alone.\u201cI thought you left.\u201d\u201cI had to finish our conversation.\u201dAt that, I said with a puzzled expression, \u201cI\u2019m serious about giving you an item. I have something to gain from you.\u201d\u201cYour circumstances don\u2019t matter.\u201d Ha Tae-heon rolled up his shirt sleeve and exhaled, irritated. \u201cYou must know how much damage you have done to our guild. Don\u2019t resist, just follow me.\u201d\u201cFollow\u2026 wait a minute. To where?\u201d\u201cThe guild.\u201dGuild? I blinked my eyes.\u00a0Which guild? It can\u2019t be\u2026\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi. I\u2019m just asking in case\u2026 Are you going to take me to the Roheon Guild now?\u201d\u201cAnd if I am?\u201dI stepped back in a panic.\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019d have to be crazy to follow you? I said it clearly. Even if you drag me by force, you\u2019ll never\u2026\u201d\u201cThen explain it with that smooth-talking mouth.\u201d Ha Tae-heon stood up and looked at me. \u201cHow can I trust you and let you leave when the only thing you have is your body? How can I contact you later?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, how are you going to get back? The only car left is the one I took.\u201dAh.Come to think of it, I took Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s car when I came here, so there was no transportation to go back. I felt a bit awkward, but I answered in the most mischievous manner as best I could, \u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dYes, yes.\u201cEven so, if you want to lock me up, I can\u2019t follow you.\u201dI said it calmly, but without realizing it, tension flowed through my body. I already knew it, but when I actually faced Ha Tae-heon, the difference in power became more apparent. How long would I be able to survive if he made up his mind to attack?\u2018Probably 10 minutes. Even if I run away, I\u2019ll be caught.\u2019Ha Tae-heon looked at me without answering my words. As the silence continued, cold sweat formed behind my back and my fists tightened. Above all, it was hard for me to stand still because I was not feeling well.\u201cI have no intention of wasting energy.\u201dHow much time has passed? Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth as I worried.\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the guild to sign a contract.\u201d\u201cContract?\u201d\u201cYou asked me to make a deal.\u201dI hesitated for a moment and then nodded. \u201cDo you mean to make a contract for a deal?\u201d\u201cI have three things to establish regarding you. First, a fair contract. Second, a means of contact. Third, to inform my guild master of your presence.\u201d\u201c\u2026I wouldn\u2019t play a trick in the contract.\u201d\u201cYou and I will write a contract with the same contents. And the process will be carried out in front of the Master.\u201dA contract. Would that be an opportunity or a poison for me? I rolled the thought around my mind as calmly as possible.After taking the time to weigh various possibilities, I smiled slightly.\u201cThe second part, let\u2019s leave out the matter of determining the means of contact. Instead, add it to the contract. I will go to meet you at the right time, and if I don\u2019t keep it, I\u2019ll be penalized.\u201d\u201cThe reason is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in a situation where I can decide things hastily.\u201dI took out my cell phone and waved it towards Ha Tae-heon.\u201cI guess it\u2019s not yours.\u201d\u201cWith this, everything we exchange will go straight to my boss. I kind of hate it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon thought about something for a moment then turned around with an indifferent expression.\u201cLet\u2019s go back first.\u201dI don\u2019t know if he accepted my opinion or not. I dragged my throbbing legs and quickly followed Ha Tae-heon.* * *\u201cSo now\u2026\u201dThe woman who was looking at me from head to toe said with a puzzled expression, \u201cYou\u2019re saying you brought the kidnapper? To our guild?\u201d\u201cNot a kidnapper, but a business guest in this case\u2026\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ha Tae-heon answered, cutting my words off. The woman, the Roheon guild master, smiled with the attitude of asking if there was a problem.\u201cWhat kind of bullshit is this? Hand him over to the police right away!\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll lose the S-class item.\u201d\u201cDo you believe that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cThen why on earth\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon slightly raised the corner of his lips. \u201cBut I believe in the contract. If we sign the contract, even that foxy bastard won\u2019t be able to change his mind.\u201dWhat foxy\u2026 are you talking about me?\u201cSigh\u2026 Tae-heon. It\u2019s not like you to do this kind of thing.\u201dNo, if it was Ha Tae-heon, this was what he would do.Ha Tae-heon was the type of person who took revenge by chasing the person who touched him to the ends of the earth. He was a man of extraordinary persistence and obsession.\u2018So that\u2019s why he kept butting heads with Cheon Sa-yeon. And Cheon Sa-yeon is just as much if not more persistent than him, and certainly not any less.\u2019However, the better between the two of them was Ha Tae-heon. If Ha Tae-heon was the type to go head-on, Cheon Sa-yeon was the type to use everything around him.\u201cThe gate has passed. I think we have to make up for that loss.\u201d\u201cA gate like that\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a normal gate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAs I slipped into the conversation, Roheon Master glared at me. Compared to how Ha Tae-heon looked, it wasn\u2019t scary at all, so I smiled brightly on purpose.\u201cIt\u2019s a ranked gate.\u201d\u201cAs expected.\u201d Ha Tae-heon nodded with a face that said he expected my words.The Roheon Master, who saw this, retorted with a sharp voice, \u201cI guess it was A-class. That is nothing to our guild.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201dI purposely shut my mouth with a smile. There was no need to tell the Roheon Guild that this gate was SS-class. When I didn\u2019t respond, she wrinkled her brow even more.\u201cLet\u2019s get back to business. Please overlook the contract, Master.\u201d Ha Tae-heon blocked the Roheon Master from saying something else to me.\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dRoheon Master, who was a bit dissatisfied, decided that she had to send me away first, so she started the process right away.The place where I, Ha Tae-heon, and the Roheon Master were currently located was the drawing room inside the Roheon Guild.There was a soft and spacious sofa, a luxurious table, and fragrant tea, but I just felt uncomfortable. I just wanted to get out of here as soon as possible, so I quickly checked the contract.\u2018The personal information part is whatever\u2026 As for the contract, it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019It was a contract stating that if I didn\u2019t provide S-class or higher items to Ha Tae-heon, I would bear penalties. I looked at it step by step and asked Ha Tae-heon, who was sitting and writing the contract in front of me.\u201cThere is nothing in the contract about keeping contact. What about that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll fix that now.\u201dHa Tae-heon pulled something out of the pocket of his suit jacket and held it out. What I received was a small, old folding phone. There was only one number stored in the phone log.\u201cThis is a specially designed mobile phone that can only be contacted by my number. I\u2019ll take care of the contact.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dI expected this from the moment I informed Ha Tae-heon of my situation being monitored by Cheon Sa-yeon, but somehow I felt strange to receive it. I rolled the phone around in my grasp and decided to accept it first.\u201cWell, I guess I understand.\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s eyebrows twitched as if he didn\u2019t like my baffling answer, but fortunately, he didn\u2019t ask much.\u201cBy the way, please include what I want in the contract.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cWhen you receive an item, please do one thing for me. No matter when it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay. I\u2019ll put a limit on it.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. Ha Tae-heon-ssi, I\u2019m going to ask you to do it without causing any harm to you or anyone around you.\u201dMy contract and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s contract, which were completely written with the additional contents, were exchanged. Master Roheon, who was overlooking the situation, turned off the camera at the end of the declaration that she was a witness and she would watch the contract proceed fairly with honour.\u201cIf you want a video, I\u2019ll send it to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary. That\u2019s enough.\u201dIn the first place, it was not that I lacked trust in Ha Tae-heon enough to even leave a contract like this. Rather, I expected Ha Tae-heon to believe in me even a little bit through this incident.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI looked forward because I thought I heard my name, but Ha Tae-heon fixed his gaze only on the contract. What is it?I felt uncomfortable, but I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Rather, since the contract was over, I wanted to leave this place quickly.By now, news of Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s return to the Jayna Guild would have reached Cheon Sa-yeon. Now I really had to go back. Fortunately, the Roheon Guild and the Requiem Guild were not far apart.\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving. Good luck.\u201dI bowed and left the drawing room. I was very tired because I was hurt and exhausted. I just wanted to go back and rest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you here to pick me up? I\u2019m touched.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you ever shut up?\u201dAs I smiled and waved at him, Kim Woo-jin quickly got worked up and spat out swear words. He was such a funny guy.\u201cLook at this guy. Ugly ass face\u2026 tsk.\u201d\u201cAh, this?\u201d I said, touching my throbbing face. \u201cWhy? Are you jealous? Do you want me to do the same to you?\u201d\u201cWhat? Crazy\u2026\u201dLooking at me laughing, Kim Woo-jin twisted his face and shook his head, but in the end, he didn\u2019t run over at me. At another time, I would have played around more, but I was too tired to bother with him.\u201cOkay, so what do you want?\u201d\u201cShit! If it wasn\u2019t for his orders, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with a bastard like you! Come with me!\u201dEven if he didn\u2019t run at me, you couldn\u2019t kill that temper. Following Kim Woo-jin, who was shouting and walking aggressively, I entered the guild building. Even though it was past 7 o\u2019clock, there were still many employees working inside.As I got on a private elevator to the top floor with Kim Woo-jin, I said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t say anything unnecessary, Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cShut up, motherf*cker. If you failed to kidnap Cha Soo-yeon, you\u2019ll be dead meat. Don\u2019t mess around too much.\u201dI looked at him with kind eyes, but Kim Woo-jin growled more fiercely than before.So mean. Yeah, I guess that\u2019s your charm.Ding\u2014The elevator opened with a light beeping sound. The attendants in black suits looked at me in unison.\u201cGo in.\u201dAs I stood in front of the large and colourful door across the corridor, the waiting attendant opened the door directly. Cheon Sa-yeon was waiting in the representative room, leaving Kim Woo-jin behind.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dEven though someone came in, he was still concentrating on the documents. Not only that, he greeted me with \u2018You\u2019re late\u2019. That was absurd. Anyone could tell you\u2019d only been playing around until now.Internally, I complained, but I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mouth, so I answered politely. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It took a while to get back.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dOnly then Cheon Sa-yeon raised his head and looked at me. The black eyes that met mine glittered with interest.\u201cThere are no records of a person who could not only perfectly copy the appearance of others, but also their ability.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cBefore, you trembled; now you brazenly talk with no fear\u2026 This time, you are acting politely, so I don\u2019t know which rhythm to follow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was then that I vaguely remembered the first time I met Cheon Sa-yeon.\u2014Nothing.That\u2019s exactly what I said. At that time, I was taken away as soon as I became Han Yi-gyeol, so there was no sense of reality and I was out of my mind. If I had known it would be like this, I should have used honorifics properly.Even if you regret it, you\u2019ve already spilt water. I thought of making an excuse, but I just decided to act as shameless as usual.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted to change up my life, but I don\u2019t want to talk down to my superiors, so I changed the way I talk again. Do you like it now?\u201d\u201cHaha, \u2018superiors\u2019?\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon smiled with the expression that he heard bullshit. \u201cI see. It doesn\u2019t matter how you speak, so it\u2019s up to you. What bothers me is another thing.\u201dAlthough I was puzzled about how Cheon Sa-yeon easily fell for it, I accepted the change in topics for now.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDid you get punched by that woman?\u201dI belatedly covered my cheek with my hand as I licked my lips with my tongue. Maybe my lips were torn, but the taste of blood hung on the tip of my tongue.I didn\u2019t have time to look in the mirror because I was caught by Kim Woo-jin at the entrance of the building and came up immediately. If Cheon Sa-yeon pointed it out, it must have been pretty swollen.\u201cI wasn\u2019t hit by the Empress of Red Flames,\u201d I said bluntly. \u201cI was beaten by Ha Tae-heon of the Roheon Guild. That was your goal anyway, so why ask?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon narrowed his eyes and smiled brightly. \u201cYes. It was\u2026 That\u2019s why I asked, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou met Ha Tae-heon, and I\u2019m surprised you suffered only that much damage.\u201dI swallowed my dry saliva and shut my mouth. I could not answer hastily.\u201cI thought you\u2019d definitely be crawling around like a mop. That\u2019s why I sent Kim Woo-jin down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis was really unexpected. It\u2019s very funny.\u201dI swallowed a sigh.As he said, Han Yi-gyeol was originally facing Ha Tae-heon before he died.This meeting with Ha Tae-heon was not safe even for me. Human emotions were always unpredictable, so no plan was perfect. In fact, I trusted Ha Tae-heon and got hit for it.It was only thanks to Cha Soo-yeon that I was able to be in such good condition. If I had used force against Cha Soo-yeon like Han Yi-gyeol originally did, Ha Tae-heon would have pummeled me.\u2018There is only one thing that Cheon Sa-yeon has missed.\u2019\u2018I\u2019 possessed Han Yi-gyeol.If it wasn\u2019t for me, Han Yi-gyeol wouldn\u2019t be where I was today. He would have been taken in an ambulance to be treated.And Cheon Sa-yeon, who ordered Cha Soo-yeon to be kidnapped despite all of that, was really an\u2026\u2018Annoying bastard.\u2019Even when I read the novel, I didn\u2019t really like Cheon Sa-yeon. In terms of how frequently characters showed up, he was second only to Ha Tae-heon, but I was not particularly fond of him.\u201cAnyway, thanks to your hard work, I got a great opportunity.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s voice was heard through the tangled gap with thoughts. I hurriedly pushed the useless thoughts to the back of my head.\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said while organizing the documents. What I wanted. I was about to ask for it anyway, so there was no reason to refuse.\u201cI know that you will be directly involved in the gate-clearing work you\u2019ve got this time.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cPlease bring me two low-level items that can be obtained from inside that gate.\u201dAt my request, Cheon Sa-yeon leaned against the back of his chair, crossed his long legs with a very strange expression. Cheon Sa-yeon thought about something while tapping the table with his fingers and then opened his mouth.\u201cTwo low-level items\u2026 That\u2019s the price.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon stared at me without saying anything. An uncomfortable silence filled the room.\u2018What is it?\u2019The atmosphere was very bad. An ominous feeling climbed up my spine. I instinctively realized.I just made a mistake.What was the problem? The low-level items? Why?\u2018\u2026no. The items can\u2019t be the problem. I didn\u2019t even tell him what the items were yet.\u2019Swallowing dryly, I continued to look into Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s cool eyes. It was inevitable. I felt as if I was facing a wild beast that was ready to rush at me. It felt like I would be swallowed up if I relaxed even for a moment.\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s do this.\u201d The sound of tapping stopped suddenly as he said with a lazy tone, \u201cLet\u2019s go together. Clear the gate.\u201d\u201c\u2026but\u2014I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be a week from now. I\u2019ll send someone on time, so stay on the 23rd floor until then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI opened my mouth to retort but closed it again without saying anything. What I wanted to say was stuck in my throat.\u00a0I am not a member of the Requiem Guild. No way, I don\u2019t want to go to the gate. That is a price you have to pay, so why am I going there myself, you swindling bastard\u2026But I couldn\u2019t spit anything out. As I stood blankly, Cheon Sa-yeon smiled.\u201cNow leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I came to my senses, I was already outside the representative room. I couldn\u2019t see where Kim Woo-jin had gone, and instead, another attendant approached me.\u201cFollow me.\u201dYesss\u2026 I followed the attendant with a soulless answer. My body sagged even more than before. I had to come to my senses, but I had a headache because I had been through so much all day. Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon, I didn\u2019t know why they all had such personalities. I hoped that a bird would poop on them in the street.\u201cPlease, rest well.\u201dThe room on the 23rd floor, which Cheon Sa-yeon ordered me to stay in for a week, was so well equipped that it was hard to believe it was inside the guild building. I quickly took off my clothes and went into the bathroom.Checking in the large mirror, my body was relatively fine, but there was a dark bruise on the right pelvis and around the knee, probably from falling to the floor when Ha Tae-heon hit my face. The unusual size and colour looked like it would last quite a while.\u201cWow.\u201dWhen I checked my left cheek, I was amazed. Looking at it straight on, anyone would say it was the face of someone who got beat up. I sighed as I touched the tip of my chapped lips. It hurt a bit when I washed it.After washing as carefully as possible, I put on a bathrobe and scrambled out of the bathroom like a zombie and dived straight into bed. The only thing I ate all day was lunch, but sleep was more important than being hungry. Even with the simple act of turning over and looking up at the ceiling, my whole body ached.\u2018Well done, me\u2026\u2019It was a dynamic day, kidnapping Cha Soo-yeon, persuading Ha Tae-heon, deceiving Cheon Sa-yeon. I felt my consciousness becoming hazy as I prayed to God.What\u2019s wrong with the difficulty level here? Please make some adjustments.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a light mood, I went into the bathroom to wash up but when I looked in the mirror, I was startled.\u201cCrazy.\u201dI expected it, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this bad. My blackened, bruised face was so disgraceful that it was difficult to look at it with both eyes opened. Making Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s clean face look like this\u2026 There was a slight rush of guilt inside me.\u2018It doesn\u2019t hurt a lot because I\u2019ve been punched before this\u2026\u2019Perhaps it was because Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body was not strong enough, and the burden was much greater than my previous body. I would have to restrain myself in the future.After washing up and getting dressed, I sat on the sofa in an awkward position. I didn\u2019t know what to do now. Can I go out? I\u2019m hungry, what should I eat?I couldn\u2019t go out and had to spend a week in prison.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I remembered the smiling face of Cheon Sa-yeon whom I met yesterday, anxiety came over me. I\u2026 Have I been detained?Cheon Sa-yeon was a pretty crazy guy, so I wasn\u2019t sure about anything.Knock, knock.After thinking for a while, I heard a knock on the door. Even in the midst of bewilderment, I ran over and opened the door. Who came?\u201cGood morning!\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dBeyond the door that opened, there was a woman I had never seen before and one of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s attendants stood together. The woman smiled brightly and bowed as she made eye contact with me.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 right. Nice to meet you?\u201dI didn\u2019t know who it was, but I replied with a greeting first. I telepathically sent a message to the attendant standing behind her for an explanation, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t answer.\u201cAre you Han Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cYes. You are\u2026?\u201dA woman with bright brown hair tied up in a ponytail smiled and held out her hand.\u201cI am Healer Min Ah-rin. I look forward to your cooperation.\u201dReflexively holding her hand, I recalled the contents of the novel. Min Ah-rin, a healer from the Requiem Guild.\u2018You\u2019re one of the main characters in the novel!\u2019Min Ah-rin, one of the most important helpers who helped the main character, Ha Tae-heon. She came to see me.* * *Min Ah-rin was an A-class healer with the best healing capacity among healers. She stood out among the helpers who appeared with her bright personality, strong mentality, and warm heart. Even the vigilant Ha Tae-heon admitted that Min Ah-rin was reliable as his colleague.How would you feel when you meet a celebrity? I couldn\u2019t recognize Min Ah-rin, who was in front of me, for a moment. Actually, I was her fan.\u201cCan I come in?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dWhen I stepped back, Min Ah-rin and her attendant entered the room together. The attendant stood in front of her, closing the open door. He probably followed Min Ah-rin to protect her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for coming all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin looked around the room and smiled softly at me. \u201cThe Master asked me to come.\u201d\u201cYour master\u2026 is he Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201d\u201cYes, he is.\u201d Min Ah-rin put on an expression that asked why I was asking a question like that. No, she said Cheon Sa-yeon sent me a healer?\u201cHe just told me to go without saying anything, so I was puzzled, but after coming, I understand now. You look terrible.\u201d\u201cAh, this is\u2026\u201d I smiled awkwardly and touched my face. It was worth saying that it was more swollen than yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t hurt even though it looks like this. I can just apply some medicine\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that because I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really fine\u2026\u201d\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m not good enough, or do you not trust me?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201dI quickly shook my head at the unexpected words. To be honest, I\u2019m more suspicious of Cheon Sa-yeon than Min Ah-rin. There was no way that Cheon Sa-yeon would send a healer unless he had another plan. Even yesterday\u2019s mood was extraordinary, so it was hard to accept the healer with ease.\u201cAnswer me honestly. If so, I\u2019ll go back without making you feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin gave me sad eyes as I kept refusing. She became so gloomy and spoke timidly, but seeing her face-to-face was absolutely killing me. I\u2019d probably be more comfortable in the middle of a war full of knives and guns. Eventually, I struggled to make excuses.\u201cIt\u2019s because I met a healer for the first time. Besides, I\u2019m not hurt enough to receive such valuable healing.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dIt was so embarrassing that I broke out in a cold sweat. Min Ah-rin took a step closer to me with a sigh of relief as I was restless with apologies.\u201cThen can I treat you? Now I see you hurt your arm as well as your face\u2026 I\u2019ll treat you together.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dWhen did you see that again? I just rolled up my sleeves because I was too lazy to take care of them after washing up, but I got caught. Eventually, I had to sit on a chair.\u201cI will start the treatment.\u201dMin Ah-rin placed her hand gently on my face. Then, a soft white light came out from her hand and her cool energy spread out. As Min Ah-rin touched the long cut on my arm, the wound disappeared like it was never there. I couldn\u2019t check because I didn\u2019t have a mirror, but maybe my face was healed too.\u201cThank you. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cFufu, it\u2019s useful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Min Ah-rin said, her face looking slightly more tired than before. It seemed that she became tired as a side effect of using her powers.\u201cBig wounds take a long time, but these much can be healed quickly.\u201d\u201cI owe you one.\u201d\u201cNo, sir. I heard from the Master that you\u2019re going to participate in this gate clearing?\u201dAh. Then I understood Min Ah-rin\u2019s situation and nodded my head.\u2018It seems that she thinks of me as someone who belongs to the Requiem Guild.\u2019Well, it made sense. A gate-clearing participant living in the guild building. Moreover, Cheon Sa-yeon seemed to have taken me for a guild member, caring enough to send a healer.\u201cI\u2019m going, too. To that gate clearing operation. You\u2019ll be the one to protect me, so I have to do this.\u201d\u201cAre you going all the way inside? Don\u2019t healers usually wait outside?\u201d\u201cUsually, yes. But he asked me to go into this gate together\u2026 I heard it\u2019s a ranked gate, so I guess that\u2019s why.\u201dIt is true that the difficulty of this gate was high because it was SS-level, but the reason why Cheon Sa-yeon wanted to bring a healer was most likely because of her abilities. Clearly, if a healer was always on standby, he would be able to comfortably complete the clearing work that lasted several days.\u201cSince you fixed my ugly face, I have to work hard to protect you in return.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear that. It\u2019s so much better to see your face healed.\u201dWhen I laughed and said it in a playful way, Min Ah-rin also laughed and accepted my joke.\u201cIs it confirmed how many people are coming to clear the gate?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re still choosing. They\u2019re going to bring in about 15 to 20 people.\u201dIf there were that many people, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference if I joined them. I don\u2019t know why he was asking me to go with him. I cursed Cheon Sa-yeon inside and asked Min Ah-rin, \u201cAre you the only healer?\u201d\u201cNo, I think there\u2019ll probably be one or two more. There are only a few healers, so it will be more difficult.\u201d\u201cThat will be enough. The inside of the gate must be a burdensome place for healers.\u201d\u201cWell, you have to be careful. Above all, is the Master the kind of person who cares about such things?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201dMin Ah-rin playfully shrugged her shoulders. Cheon Sa-yeon, who even made the nice Min Ah-rin say something like this, is a great guy in many ways.\u201cThen I have to go. I\u2019ll see you at the gate.\u201d\u201cYeah. Goodbye.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who finished her job, left coolly. The silence sank in when the attendant, who was guarding the door, also followed Min Ah-rin out of the room. I was amazed to see my normal face in the bathroom mirror. Healer skills were the best.\u2018Min Ah-rin. It\u2019s Min Ah-rin\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t expect to see her so soon. I recalled the novel as I touched my cheeks that held no traces of being hit.Min Ah-rin was a healer who fell in love with Ha Tae-heon and changed her affiliation from Requiem to Roheon. She had rare healer ability and, because she was also A rank, Cheon Sa-yeon tried to get her to stay. But Min Ah-rin, who had already made up her mind, rejected all the benefits of staying and went to find Ha Tae-heon.\u2018The time when Min Ah-rin met Ha Tae-heon and moved to Roheon was midway through. She still doesn\u2019t know about Ha Tae-heon now.\u2019A-rank healer. Min Ah-rin. I was lost in thought, looking in the mirror for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How have you been this past week? I really didn\u2019t want to see Cheon Sa-yeon asking such a brazen question.I haven\u2019t taken a single step out of the room since Min Ah-rin left. No way, this crazy bastard really imprisoned me!When I opened the door, a huge attendant blocked me from leaving, and if I broke anything, the waiting attendants rushed into the room, and the window was locked and couldn\u2019t be opened. It was the perfect confinement.In the meantime, the meals were even more spectacular because I was served three meals a day. I\u2019d rather be starved and let go! I grabbed the attendant and shouted that this was a crime, but they didn\u2019t blink an eye.\u201cThanks to. You. I\u2019ve been. Very. Well.\u201d The corners of my lips that were forcibly pulled up trembled as I gritted my teeth.\u201cGood for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think I would have any other wishes if I could hit him just once. I was collecting all the world\u2019s swear words and reciting them as if I were rapping when I sensed movement next to me. Turning my head, I saw Kim Woo-jin standing there.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh, shit. I didn\u2019t come here because I wanted to.\u201dThe way he spoke was the same as usual, but he hesitated and looked around. Cheon Sa-yeon smiled at me and Kim Woo-jin alternately.\u201cKim Woo-jin said that he would participate in the gate clearing.\u201d\u201cWait. Haven\u2019t you already selected all the participants?\u201dWhy was Kim Woo-jin here all of a sudden? What difference would it make to take a C-rank who didn\u2019t even have the ability to attack an SS gate?\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal to add one more.\u201d\u201cBut Kim Woo-jin\u2026!\u201d\u201cOf course, I know very well that Kim Woo-jin is not suitable for combat.\u201d\u201cThen why did you include him?\u201d\u201cOf course, there is only one reason.\u201dThere was a smile in his calm voice. Recognizing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s intentions, I replied, suppressing my irritation, \u201cI understand you want to keep an eye on me, but why don\u2019t you hire another employee? Why is it Kim Woo-jin?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, Kim Woo-jin is the best.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled as he looked at Kim Woo-jin, but his eyes were surprisingly cold.\u201cEverything is agreed upon by the parties. The gate will open in half an hour, so it\u2019s too late to regret it now.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but you have an interview scheduled.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon neatly turned his back and walked to the place full of cameras. As Cheon Sa-yeon got closer, the cameras set off a huge amount of flashes as if they\u2019d been waiting.\u201cKim Woo-jin. What the hell were you thinking?\u201dAs soon as Cheon Sa-yeon moved away, I immediately grabbed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s arm and pulled him towards me.\u201c\u2026what do you care?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t care if you have to get on the bus to hell to continue watching me then? We still have 30 minutes left, so run away secretly.\u201d\u201cShut up. Don\u2019t interfere when you don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019ll take care of my own business.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m going crazy\u2026\u201dI looked up at the sky for a moment in a surge of frustration and anger then spoke again, \u201cDo you think going inside the gate is a joke? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019d be okay if it was another gate, but not this time. It\u2019s really dangerous\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dHe shook off my hand. Kim Woo-jin wrinkled his face, annoyed, and said, \u201cWho am I to run away? I\u2019m an ability user like you. You live without an affiliate, so you could run away easily. Do you think we are in the same situation?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard to get into the guild. You want me to give up all of that and run away? Because of one gate like this?\u201dI frowned and shut my mouth.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s ability to \u2018blur his presence\u2019 was so usable that even an SS rank did not easily sense him, but\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a rare thing or a skill that everyone needed. Even those types of abilities were often used for crime, so society did not think highly of it.\u201cCalm down and listen to me. This gate is\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of myself even if you don\u2019t do this shit, so just mind your own business. Hearing shit like this from a bastard like you is fucking disgusting.\u201dWith those words, Kim Woo-jin turned around before I could catch him. I looked at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s back, who was getting farther away, and thought about holding on to it, but in the end I didn\u2019t do anything and just sighed.The work was supposed to be done by Cheon Sa-yeon, so why do I have to do it? That\u2019s why if you have a boss who just lives his own life, only the subordinates will suffer.I had seen his face a few times though, so I tried to stop him from dying. If this happened, I had no choice but to stay alert and take care of Kim Woo-jin.\u201cKim Woo-jin, that idiot\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThere was a reply as I muttered, lamenting, to myself. I looked behind me in surprise. Min Ah-rin, with her eyes wide open, was standing there looking at me.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d Min Ah-rin greeted me with a smile. As if nothing had happened to her for a week, she looked bright and lively.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It looks like you\u2019ve had a fight with someone.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI changed my mind from saying it was nothing and asked Min Ah-rin, \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know how difficult the gate is\u2026 No, did the Master say something?\u201d\u201cNo, not really\u2026 He didn\u2019t say anything. However, seeing so many people gathered, everyone assumes that it will not be easy since the Master isn\u2019t going by himself.\u201d\u201c\u2026hmm. Min Ahrin-ssi. I said I\u2019d protect you, remember?\u201dThere was nothing we could do if the situation was like this. I leaned closer to Min Ah-rin and smiled softly. Min Ah-rin\u2019s eyes trembled slightly as she looked up at me.\u201cUh, yeah. I remember\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, there are low-level items that I need to obtain separately. I\u2019m trying to move slowly from the back of the line\u2026 If that\u2019s the case, I thought I\u2019d go with Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0to protect the healer team. How about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Min Ah-rin-ssi?\u201dWith lowered eyelashes and a pitiful expression that said to comfort her, Min Ah-rin had a strange expression on her face. Min Ah-rin, who looked at me with a blank expression on her face, came to her senses when I called her again and nodded in a hurry.\u201cWell, I\u2019d love to. If you would.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Inside the gate\u2026 It\u2019s dangerous and scary\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, of course. I will do my best to keep you safe.\u201dIt was a success. I was puzzled by the way she agreed, but it was satisfying to be near a precious healer anyway.\u2018If I stay next to Min Ah-rin, there won\u2019t be a big problem if Kim Woo-jin gets hurt.\u2019It was a situation in which half of the burden I had been carrying on my back was handed over to Min Ah-rin, but I didn\u2019t care. To protect my conscience, I wouldn\u2019t let a healthy child get hurt.\u201cFive minutes left until the gate opens!\u201dA voice was heard from the front row telling us to prepare to enter the gate. Cheon Sa-yeon was standing in front of the gate after finishing the interview.Cheon Sa-yeon, dressed in a dark red casual suit over his slightly tight black neck turtleneck, held a sword that did not match his attire. The naked sword with dried blood stains stood out in particular.\u201cThe gate is open!\u201dLike Cheon Sa-yeon, the guild members who took out their weapons looked at the gate with tense faces. The entrance, which had been tightly closed in a straight line, opened slowly in an oval shape and shimmered with dark blue light. As soon as the entrance was opened, Cheon Sa-yeon took the first step into it without hesitation.\u2018Where did Kim Woo-jin go?\u2019I walked forward with Min Ah-rin and looked around quickly. Wherever he went after arguing with me, Kim Woo-jin did not appear even though the gate was just around the corner.Did he run away on my advice? I\u2019d rather it be like that.\u201cUh, what should I do? I\u2019m nervous.\u201dWhen it was her own turn, Min Ah-rin dryly swallowed her saliva, pale. Her reaction was understandable. The gate, which glowed as if it would swallow anything, was as colourful and bizarre as a nebula in the universe. My stomach was churning with instinctive rejection, but I held out my hand pretending to be okay. I felt the coldness of touching dry ice from my fingertips.\u201cI\u2019ll go in first, so please follow me slowly.\u201dI deliberately pushed myself into the gate to show the stiff Min Ah-rin. Arms, legs, and upper body, I finally entered the gate completely and opened my closed eyes.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dThe first thing that caught my eye was a hazy red sky. I looked around, reflexively covering my mouth and nose, feeling suffocated. Soft sand, bare branches, and endless plains. The unfolding landscape was like a desert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s full of red sand.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 yeah.\u201d\u201cIf it was actually Mars, we wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe because of carbon dioxide, right? That\u2019s amazing! If electronic devices could work inside the gate, I would have taken a picture. What a shame.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHer fear at the gate entrance was nowhere to be found. Min Ah-rin was so excited that she began to look around. It was quite refreshing because it was my first time seeing her like that.\u201cI guess you watch that kind of documentary a lot.\u201d\u201cYes! It\u2019s a lot of fun. Isn\u2019t it interesting? It\u2019s an unknown planet you\u2019ve never been to. When I was young, my dream was to be a scientist. I gave up because I couldn\u2019t study well.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThe briefing begins now! Please gather around!\u201dIt was not long before all guild members came over and a voice was heard to gather people. I and Min Ah-rin moved in the direction where guild members gathered.\u201cMy name is Park Geon-ho (\ubc15\uac74\ud638), the head of the gate-clearing team. Before we get started, I will give you a final overview of the overall process.\u201d A man standing on a big rock spoke as he looked back at the guild members.Park Geon-ho. It was a familiar name.He had appeared several times in the novel. I think his ability was pretty useful, too, but I couldn\u2019t remember what it was.\u201cPark Geon-ho is one of the team leaders of the Special Operations Division. This is the first time I\u2019ve actually seen him,\u201d Min Ah-rin, who was standing next to me, whispered to me. I couldn\u2019t think of any information because I didn\u2019t have a lot of references on him.\u201cSpecial Operations?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? The dispatch division (including Special Operations) selects only high-level gates and clears them. There was a lot of talk about how the Master had personally recruited the ability users he liked. I guess that\u2019s true, seeing that you\u2019re participating in this clearing as well.\u201d\u201cHe must be incredibly strong. What\u2019s his ability?\u201d\u201cOh, what was it again? I heard he does something with beads? I don\u2019t really remember.\u201dI nodded for now. I\u2019ll find out by myself as I proceed through the clearing process anyway. After a brief conversation with Min Ah-rin, I focused on Park Geon-ho\u2019s words.\u201cIf you look far north, you can faintly see a building, and that\u2019s our destination. As with existing gates, the first monsters will flock in around 20 minutes and the grade inside of the gate will be rated first by measuring the monster\u2019s rating.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon or I knew that this gate was a ranked gate, even an SS-rank gate, but the other guild members didn\u2019t know. Judging from the atmosphere, Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t seem to care enough to give the information to the guild members. In the novel, it was stated that the gate was cleared without any damage and the weapon was successfully obtained, so I didn\u2019t have much to worry about\u2026\u201cThe grade inside the gate will continue to change according to the monster levels, so please don\u2019t let down your guard until you clear it. It will be difficult to find you if you get lost inside the gate, so please follow me. From now on, Master and I will take the lead. That is all.\u201dAfter finishing the explanation, Park Geon-ho went down from the rock and soon, we started moving. I looked at the other healers and ability users around Min Ah-rin.\u2018Based on these ability users, they must all be B -rank. It seems like it won\u2019t be easy.\u2019As they are guild members deployed to protect the healer team, they would not be fools. At that moment, among all the unfamiliar faces, I saw a man who seemed strange to me. I looked at the man for a long time, wondering what this uncomfortable feeling was, and just in case I grabbed him by the back of his neck.\u201cFuck, what the hell!\u201d\u201cOh wow.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even hide his tone because he expected to be found out quickly. I sighed, crossed my arms, and looked at him.\u201cYou\u2019ve been following me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTurn off your ability right now.\u201d\u201cI was going to anyway!\u201dGrumbling, the stranger disappeared and Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face was revealed. He already came in, so there was no point in getting angry.I said, tilting my head, \u201cI thought you\u2019d have run away since I couldn\u2019t see you, but you still followed me? Do you want to die so badly?\u201d\u201cShut up. I\u2019ll walk out fine, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\u201cOh, then please do that. Okay?\u201dLooking disgusted, Kim Woo-jin exhaled roughly with an angry look on his face. What are you staring at me for?\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi. Who is this?\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was listening to the conversation next to me, intervened with a curious expression. I was about to introduce him, so I quickly grabbed Kim Woo-jin.\u201cHe\u2019s Kim Woo-jin, an assistant. Hey, say hello to her. Min Ah-rin-ssi. She is a healer.\u201dShe was a very important person who was going to be responsible for your life. As I looked at Kim Woo-jin with a strong meaning, he greeted Min Ah-rin with a pouting mouth.\u201cI\u2019m Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cMy name is Min Ah-rin. You\u2019re the one working next to the Master, right? I remember seeing you a few times.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHere comes the first monster!\u201dWhile I was leisurely watching Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin shaking hands, I heard Park Geon-ho\u2019s cry in front of me. I quickly grabbed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder in a hurry and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, and stay close to Min Ah-rin-ssi. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI\u2014I got it!\u201dKim Woo-jin, who came in with a mind that couldn\u2019t be changed, was also scared when the monster appeared, so he nodded his head obediently and stepped back behind me. I took a deep breath and looked away. Something was coming, trampling on the red sand.There were several monster attacks inside the gate. It was more than three times when it was low-level, and more than 20 times when it was high-level, and how many monsters attacked at one time was also random. The most important thing was the flocking pattern. Even if it came from only one direction, it could suddenly come pouring out from all directions, so I always had to look around.So the back row where the healers were located wasn\u2019t safe either. I watched the monsters getting closer through the sand and dust.Kyeeek! Kyeek!\u00a0(\ud0a4\uc5d0\uc5d0\uc5d1! \ud0a4\uc5d0\uc5d1!)The creature covered in rough grey leather howled with a ripping sound. The open mouth had dozens of pointed teeth, and its tongue was long and thick. The head looked like a crocodile, but the legs were extremely thin and numerous, and the overall appearance was more like a spider. It seemed like there was poison at the ends of the legs, which were a bizarre red color.\u2018It sure is gross.\u2019It was the first time I had personally faced a monster inside the gate, so I was nervous. In the future, I would have to continue to face such disgusting bastards\u2026 The psychological pain was greater than the physical pain. I didn\u2019t want to see them in my dreams.The total number of monsters rushing towards us was four. I raised my arms, pulling up my ability.Kwadeudeuk!\u00a0(\ucf70\ub4dc\ub4dd!)As soon as I blew up the two legs of the monster running at the forefront, the monster jumped up and swung its legs exactly where I was.\u201cHurgh!\u201d (\ud06d!) I managed to fly up into the air and dodge the attack, swallowing back the scream that came up my throat. There was a chill and goosebumps on my back.Kyeeek!Perhaps dissatisfied with my avoidance, the monster opened its mouth menacingly as it dripped blood from its legs. I frowned at the unpleasant scene. Even the blood dripping out was blue\u2014was it an alien or something?I formed a wind blade again and sent it to the monster. Unlike the first time, I made several and threw them. The monster evaded the first wind blade nimbly, but the second and third hit it. The monster, whose left arm and half of the upper body were cut off by the wind blade aimed at the heart, fell on the sand with a gurgling sound.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dFortunately, it was a monster with low intelligence and no defense characteristics. In a similar way, I killed two monsters that rushed at me. The two of them rushed at the same time, so I hurriedly used my ability and got splashed with blue blood when I couldn\u2019t dodge in time.\u2018Ugh, disgusting.\u2019I turned my head to the side as much as possible to avoid getting my clothes wet, but the state of my face was hopeless. I looked back, wiping off the blue blood that had been smeared on the left side of my face. The one I missed was caught safely by the other guild member protecting the healer team.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dAs I trudged back, Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin ran up to me in surprise. Min Ah-rin shouted, \u201cAre\u2014are you hurt?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 My blood isn\u2019t blue.\u201dWhen I answered shakily, Min Ah-rin said \u201cAh,\u201d and brought out a handkerchief. She handed it over to me, and I took it, grateful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The desk full of papers that I had just looked at looked messy at first glance.\u201cWow, look at your face. Take better care of yourself,\u00a0Hyungnim, since you\u2019ve got a nice face and all.\u201d\u201cUppity little\u2026 Am I your friend or something? Give me what you bought.\u201dThe guy who was looking at me with a pout held out what he had in his hand.\u201cI run errands for you, buying coffee every day. You don\u2019t give me any face at all (\ucabd\ud314\ub9ac\uac8c)\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd yet you keep coming and going? Do you want me to kick you out?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d\u201cStudents who don\u2019t study and instead walk in and out of a thug\u2019s office shouldn\u2019t be given any face.\u201d\u201cYou ain\u2019t jack shit either, fuckin\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cFuckin\u2019?\u201d\u201cSheesh, you have keen ears.\u201dEven to the end, he was rebellious, faking a laugh and shaking his head. Whatever. What else can I say to him? Instead of nagging, I put a straw in the vanilla latte he bought and sucked it.I drank coffee in silence for a while, and the guy who was staring at me blankly swept his dog-looking hair back and said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s amazing how well you consume something so sweet\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit. Wine would look better with you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s it matter if I like sweets or not? If you\u2019ve no other business here, why don\u2019t you stop chatting and leave?\u201d\u201cUgh, I was going to leave anyway! Really, how annoying\u2026\u201dWho knew what his problem was, but the guy hurriedly opened the office door and walked out as he made a ruckus. I didn\u2019t pay much mind, so I just drank coffee.It was sweet and cool. Delicious.\u201c\u2026gyeol-ssi.\u201dSweet was the best\u2026\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cUmm?\u201dMy eyes flashed open (\uae5c\ube61). When I woke up, I saw sand through my blurred vision. Min Ah-rin, who shook me up, asked anxiously, \u201cAre you okay? Do you want me to use my powers if you\u2019re having a hard time? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI must have slept enough to even dream. I got up from where I was sitting and brushed the sand off my pants.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s four in the morning. They say we will be leaving soon.\u201dI nodded. I could see the sky, full of red dust, getting a little brighter.It had been four days since I entered the gate. As it was an SS-class gate, the interior was so wide that we were only halfway done. Looking around, I saw guild members cleaning up their beds.Offensive ability users had better stamina than ordinary B-rank users, so they could sleep anywhere, but non-offensive ability users like healers had the same body as ordinary people, so items such as sleeping bags were essential.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0looks more tired than me.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before.\u201dEven if you slept in a sleeping bag or tent, you couldn\u2019t rest comfortably inside a gate where monsters attacked from time to time. Min Ah-rin, who had dark circles caused by fatigue and rough skin, smiled awkwardly.\u201cIt\u2019s still bearable. Since no one is hurt\u2026\u201d\u201cAah.\u201dFortunately, the monsters that appeared for these four days were grade B. Most of the clear team members were A-rank, so it was easy to handle even if monsters flocked in groups.Healers could heal in exchange for their own energy so it was fine for now, but if people started getting hurt, Min Ah-rin would have a harder time than now\u201cBut it\u2019s easier than I thought. I thought the gate would be more difficult because the Master is also participating.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very easy gate.\u201dI told Min Ah-rin to be careful and to not relax too much. I was also sceptical that only grade B monsters appeared for these four days, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that this gate was SS-ranked.* * *As soon as the surrounding area was completely bright, the monsters attacked. It was confusing for a while because they hid in the sand, but since they were B grade, the commotion quickly subsided.Boom!Kweeehk!\u00a0(\ud06c\uc5d0\uc5d1!)Dozens of scorpion-like monsters were torn apart and fell to the floor.\u00a0Boom!\u00a0The ground shook slightly at the sound of the explosion.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dA small iron ball flew to the monster and exploded. The monsters that rushed in did not even come close and were swept away by the explosion.I nodded at Min Ah-rin\u2019s words and looked at Park Geon-ho, who was handling the monster. The ability to turn an iron ball into a bomb. It was powerful enough to explode grade A monsters, so the position of team leader of the Special Operations Division was understandable.The team that had dealt with all the monsters with Park Geon-ho\u2019s ability started moving again. As I was walking while chewing dried beef jerky, I raised my head at the sound of shouts.\u201cThis is the rest section!\u201dA thick green forest appeared in front of me, where I could only see the barren sand. The forest, which looked unlike anything from reality, like an oasis illusion, was a place called \u2018Rest\u2019, and it was a section that existed in some gates.A peaceful forest with a dense jungle of trees and a river flowing in the centre. It was large enough that you\u2019d have to walk half a day to leave it, and no monsters appeared in it, so it was named \u2018Rest\u2019.Min Ah-rin, who saw the rest section for the first time like me, opened her eyes wide and spoke in an amazed tone, \u201cWow, there\u2019s an actual forest.\u201d\u201cI heard there are no monsters here.\u201d\u201cRight. But don\u2019t go around unnecessarily because it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201c\u2026damn it, why are you only bullying me?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had been constantly nagging me for four days, complained. I sighed and lowered my voice so Min Ah-rin could not hear me.\u201cThere\u2019s something else I need to do, so I\u2019ll be out during the Rest section. Please don\u2019t make trouble and stay quietly next to Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhat? I\u2019m going too!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201dIt was the only place where I could get the two low-level items I asked for in return from Cheon Sa-yeon. It was my first time actually looking for it, so I didn\u2019t know how long it would take. I was planning to follow the healer team from behind and then move out separately.\u201cWhat is this nonsense? The reason I came in the first place was to keep an eye on you\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Master knows so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dTo be struggling to go get the two low-leveled items I should have gotten in the first place\u2026 oh, let\u2019s stop there. If I thought about it more, I would probably run up to Cheon Sa-yeon and grab him by the collar.\u201cAh, what am I supposed to do by myself\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy would you be alone? I introduced you to Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not close!\u201d\u201cAre you close to me?\u201dWhen I asked him that back, Kim Woo-jin closed his mouth and stared at me. There was no point in staring.\u201cSo you can be shy in this kind of situation\u2026 How troublesome\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! I just don\u2019t feel like being friendly!\u201d\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not bringing you along. I don\u2019t have time to take care of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I looked at Kim Woo-jin with a deliberately very pissed off and annoyed expression on my face, the guy turned his body with a red face and ran away into the crowd. As I was looking at him and clicking my tongue, Min Ah-rin asked me with a curious expression, \u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, do you have a younger brother?\u201d\u201cYounger brother?\u201dI swept around the back of my neck at the unexpected question. Should I say yes or no\u2026 To be honest, Han Yi-gyeol had a younger sister.It was strange for me to ponder for a long time, so I asked bluntly, \u201cWhat\u2026 Why ask all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cWhen I see you treat Kim Woo-jin-ssi, you act like you have a lot of younger siblings.\u201dI had a lot of brothers, yes. I laughed awkwardly.\u2018I had a lot. Of course, they\u2019re not my brothers in that sense.\u2019I remembered the big guys who followed me saying, \u201cHyungnim, Hyungnim\u201d. Thinking about it, they all looked so nice and innocent.Come to think of it, there was a guy with a similar personality to Kim Woo-jin. The blond hair which I had pushed aside from my memory came to mind.\u201cHow old are you, Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 No, no, twenty-four years old.\u201dI almost spat out my real age. I managed to come to my senses and say Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s age. It was the age I found out by looking at his ID card in his wallet. In the novel, Han Yi-gyeol had a small role, so information such as his age did not appear.\u201cTwenty-four? You look younger.\u201d\u201cWhat about Min Ah-rin-ssi?\u201d\u201cI am twenty-nine years old.\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0also looks much younger than your age.\u201dMin Ah-rin laughed at my words with a playful expression.\u201cHeh, heh. I hear that a lot, but it feels even better when Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0says it.\u201d\u201cHaha, I mean it.\u201dIt was beneficial in many ways to get points from Min Ah-rin, but what I just said was true. No wonder \u2018Abyss\u2019 was a man-oriented novel. Ha Tae-heon, who had so many women follow him around, must have felt great.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guild members, who settled near the river where the blue water flowed, rested and seemed happy as if they had come on a trip.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi! They\u2019re making curry over there. Let\u2019s go eat together!\u201d\u201cCurry? In here?\u201d\u201cYes. Because there\u2019s water here. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve eaten properly. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to eat!\u201d\u2026I didn\u2019t expect you to enjoy this so much. I took a step back and said to Min Ah-rin, who was about to drag me right away, \u201cAlright, you go first. I\u2019ll find Kim Woo-jin and go with you.\u201d\u201cOkay. If you\u2019re late, there\u2019ll be nothing to eat, so come quickly!\u201dAs if Min Ah-rin\u2019s words were true, the delicious smell wafted over here. Min Ah-rin, who hadn\u2019t had a proper meal in four days, was so excited that she urged me to come too.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201dBut I won\u2019t go.After sending Min Ah-rin off with a smile, I entered the forest in the midst of the energetic atmosphere. Unlike the riverside, the inside of the forest was full of large trees and was heavy and humid.\u2018It would be better to look for it from above.\u2019It would be much faster to find it by flying than from under the bulging roots that were the size of an adult male\u2019s thigh. I floated my body up with my abilities and thought of the items I had to get.First, the wings of the \u2018sapphire-tailed butterfly\u2019 (\uc0ac\ud30c\uc774\uc5b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub098\ube44), an insect that could only be found in the Rest section.It was called sapphire-tailed because it had a similar colour to a sapphire gem. This butterfly had wings that were a beautiful mix of blue and purple. It was an insect that no one paid any attention to because it was simply pretty\u2014nothing else special about it.Second, the horn-shaped branch of the \u2018bluish bighorn tree\u2019 (\ud070\ubfd4\ud478\ub974\uc2a4\ub984\ub098\ubb34) that grew only in a forest gate or the Rest section.This tree was engraved with a unique pattern that was not commonly seen elsewhere. It was a tree that grew only in a forest gate or the Rest section, but what I needed was a horn branch obtained from an A or higher grade gate, so I had to get it this time.Neither of them were easy to find, so I would have to search around for a while. I sat on a thick branch and looked around.Jjireureuk, jjireuk.\u00a0(\ucc0c\ub974\ub975, \ucc0c\ub975)A bright light shone through the dense leaves, illuminating the interior of the rainforest. An unidentified strange-looking bird flew around, and the soil wriggled as if something was crawling on the ground.Here, various creatures that could not be found outside the gate, such as the butterflies I had to look for, were alive and breathing. When the gate was created and the Rest section became known, various biologists showed interest, but it was a place that could not be entered except by the few who had awakened as ability users.\u2018Besides, even biologists who had awakened as ability users focused more on monsters than on the Rest sections.\u2019When you looked at it like this, it was not much different from the rainforest you saw on TV. It was so peaceful without the monsters.What exactly were gates? Why did they appear all over the world and spit out ferocious monsters?The research was still underway to find out. Five years after the first gate appeared, guilds were established and zones were divided, and in the tenth year, facilities that researched monsters and items were established. The world barely regained stability in the fifteenth year. However, the world still did not know why gates existed.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m curious, but it\u2019s none of my business.\u2019After all, this was just a creation made by someone. As long as you could find a way out, who cared?I stood from the branch I was sitting on and flew up again. I would have to find the horn branch before the butterfly, whose location was still unclear.Most of the horn branches grew on the tops of bluish bighorn trees. As I flew high into the sky, the wide forest of the Rest section unfolded beneath my feet.If the \u2018Abyss\u2019 I had heard of wasn\u2019t a novel, I would have been able to find it more easily. It was difficult because I had only read the descriptions through writing.\u201cAh, goddamn.\u201dUnfortunately, the horn branch that I barely found after flying over the Rest section for over an hour was a regular horn branch without a pattern engraved on it. I sighed as I held the ordinary horn branch the size of an adult male\u2019s fist in my hand.\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult than I thought.\u201dAbandoning the ordinary horn branch, I turned towards the entrance of the Rest section. I thought it would be better to comb through the forest from the entrance slowly. The sky was full of red before I knew it. The sun was setting.The butterfly had a fluorescent substance on the surface of its wings, so it was okay to search for it at night, but not the horn branches. I was in a hurry, so I increased my speed.After wandering around looking for the horn branch, it took a lot of time to return to the entrance. By the time I arrived, the sun had already set and the darkness had settled in a little. Fortunately, a large tree with a mysterious pattern, which I had been looking for, came into view.\u201cFound it.\u201dIt was the horn branch that I barely found after flying for almost 3 hours. I pulled out a horn-shaped branch covered in patterns that were difficult to explain in words. After putting it in the leather bag I was wearing on my waist, I slowly descended to the ground. The sapphire-tailed butterfly lived near plants, so it would be faster to find it while walking.I jumped over the thick root of a tree and pushed away the large leaves that blocked my view. I heard that tropical rainforests were full of animals and plants that were dangerous to humans, but I don\u2019t know what it was like here. As night fell, my sight was getting darker, so I was a little nervous.* * *\u201cWhere the hell are you, huh\u2026\u201dSo I walked for a long time like that. Han Yi-gyeol, an A-rank ability user, had a stronger body than ordinary people, but wandering through the rainforest for hours was quite difficult. Moreover, the high oxygen density and humidity tired me quickly.\u2018Aigo, I\u2019m going to die.\u2019I agonized as I sat on the branch of a suitable height. Let\u2019s give up the butterfly wings and go back. I was seriously conflicted, but in the end, I shook my head. If I gave up like this, I had to go through another gate to get the butterfly wings, but I didn\u2019t have time for that, because I had to go through a difficult procedure to enter the gate as an independent.I made the decision to take a break and look for it even if it was a little late to return, leaning my back against the tree trunk, and I saw a blue light through the crevice of the forest on the other side. At first, I thought I was mistaken, but whenever the wind swayed the bushes, the blue light continued to sparkle.\u201cA sapphire-tailed butterfly?\u201dI jumped up and flew towards the light. With a pounding heart, I removed the dense bushes and there were several sapphire-tailed butterflies fluttering their pretty wings.\u2018Crazy. What a victory*.\u2019I found it after 4 hours of searching. I clenched my fists and shouted in my heart. I had to be careful as the butterfly might be scared away if I actually screamed out loud.It was simple once I found it. I pulled the butterfly closer with my powers and just took off its wings. I didn\u2019t need much, so I only removed two pairs of wings. I put four palm-sized butterfly wings in my bag.I\u2019m sorry. I will put the wings I took to good use.Now that I had all the items I wanted, all I had to do was go back. I flew along the river with a light heart. It had been about 7 hours since I left, so the team must have reached the end of the Rest section. I flew leisurely to find the team, expecting nothing to have happened, but I blinked at the faint sound of an explosion in the distance.\u201cI think it\u2019s Park Geon-ho\u2019s ability.\u201dBoom!\u00a0There was another explosion and the ground shook slightly. I sped up a little bit as an ominous feeling passed through. Apparently, the team had already left the rest section and faced some monsters right away.Rustle! Crunch!\u00a0(\ud30c\uc0ac\uc0ad! \ud30c\uc0ad!)Moving rapidly, leaves and such slammed into me, but I did not stop. The team moved much faster than I thought. I expected them to stop at night in the Rest section.\u201c\u2026block it!\u201d\u201c\u2026please!\u201dBoom! Bang!Kyeehk!Urgent cries, explosions, and monster cries. The distant sounds came to me at once. I finally exited the Rest section and frowned at the sight in front of me.\u201cGet out of here!\u201d\u201cGrade identification is complete! They\u2019re S grade!\u201dKwaak!\u00a0(\ud06c\uc544\uc545!)Dozens of monsters with muddy bodies were rushing towards the team members, spitting out green acid solutions. The square-shaped and tightly packed teeth gleamed dangerously, and the carapace that covered the eyes was long and protruded outwards. Its arms were bent like a mantis, pointed like a sickle, and its lower body looked like a snake, moving quickly on the sand.\u201cKim Woo-jin!\u201dThe monster swung its sharp arm towards Kim Woo-jin. Kim Woo-jin hurriedly turned his body to the right and managed to avoid the attack, but failed to escape from the monster that was just around the corner. Seeing a monster trying to bite Kim Woo-jin with its teeth soaked with acid solutions, I hurriedly moved my hands.\u201cAck!\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s body flew towards me. Having caught him, I grabbed his waist and flew away from the monster. As Kim Woo-jin suddenly disappeared from its eyes, the monster made a sharp sound as if it was scratching the window with its fingernail.\u201c\u2026Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cGet your head on right.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was tired and covered in cold sweat, looked at me with a blank expression. I spoke coldly so as not to lose my temper, and looked around to find Min Ah-rin.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Our MC here went on a field trip of his own and came back to find trouble\u2026 How tiring it is for him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I saw the guild members confused by the sudden surprise attack of the grade S monster.\u201cAck!\u201dSomething flew right in front of me and I reflexively shook my head. The acid solution brushed past my ear and left it sore.Kyaaak\u2014!\u00a0(\ud0a4\uc544\uc544\uc545-!)One monster looked up at me and cried out with its jaws wide open, then the other monsters all raised their heads in unison. A long tongue, wet with a sticky acid solution, sprouted through the teeth, pouring acid solutions from the open mouth.Kweeehk! Kweehk!The acidic solutions flew towards me like a water gun. The first one was easy to dodge, but when it came to the second and third, it was difficult to dodge quickly. There was too much acidic solution pouring out.\u201cHold onto me\u2014ack!\u2014correctly!\u201dIt was more difficult to dodge while holding onto Kim Woo-jin\u2019s waist. I kept slipping up because I was not used to floating in the air with someone else.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, over there!\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was looking around, pointed to his left. When I turned my gaze, I saw the healers and Cheon Sa-yeon holding a long sword. When I found Min Ah-rin, who was terrified, I immediately flew there.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi!\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dMin Ah-rin, who saw me and Kim Woo-jin, welcomed me with great relief. I came down to the ground, let Kim Woo-jin go, and asked right away, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cAs\u2014as soon as we left the Rest section, a monster suddenly crawled out of the sand.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dEven as everyone was struggling, Cheon Sa-yeon was relaxed as usual. I suppressed my emotions as much as possible and opened my mouth, \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry? If you stayed in the Rest section, it would have been more\u2026\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the situation.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled softly. The black eyes that were exposed through his hair fluttering in the wind looked somewhat empty.\u201cStand back.\u201dKugugung\u2014!\u00a0(\ucfe0\uad6c\uad81-!)As soon as Cheon Sa-yeon finished speaking, the ground shook violently. Min Ah-rin, who couldn\u2019t keep her balance, sank down.\u00a0Kkwaaak!\u00a0A terrible roar rang out. Looking back, I saw a monster with its front feet on the shoulder of a guild member who fell due to the earthquake.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin trembled and stepped back. I supported Min Ah-rin and strained my body.\u00a0Thump, Thump, a pounding heartbeat rang in my ears and a chilling fear crawled up from my toes.Sasaksasak\u2026\u00a0(\uc0ac\uc0ac\uc0ac\uc0ad)The sand sprang up. It was a great sickle that broke through the tip of the sand that came up around.Ttuduk, crack, crack.\u00a0(\ub69c\ub451, \ub07c\ub9ad, \ub07d)The sound of bones hitting each other echoed in my ears. Flesh rushed through the sand, revealing a bare hand. Like a murderer returning from hell, or a corpse coming up from a grave. It slowly drilled through the sand and crawled out of the ground, snapping its teeth.\u201cThat monster\u2026\u201dI clasped my cold hands, wet with cold sweat. I felt instinctively the dozens of S-grade monsters could not compare to the one that arrived now. Covered in black, it thrashed its scythe with its tattered arms as if it had been bitten by something. At that moment, a shriek echoed in my head.\u201cThe middle boss of this gate. It\u2019s a monster that hasn\u2019t been rated yet. If I had to guess, it should be around S+.\u201dUnlike me, who became stiff, Cheon Sa-yeon looked at the monster in front of him. The act of unbuttoning the jacket and turning the hand holding the sword slightly seemed boring at first glance.\u201cBe careful not to get too close by mistake. Below S-rank, the fear can drive you crazy.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon raised his sword and cut the palm of his opposite hand without hesitation. I thought it was a light cut, but the amount of blood pouring from his palm was more than expected. Vivid blood was sprinkled on the blade that had already been covered in dried blood.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dThe sword that swallowed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s blood began to burn with a roar of dark red flames. One of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s powers was blood fire. Anything that touched that fire would burn to ashes until it disappeared.\u201cYou go and help Park Geon-ho.\u201d\u201c\u2026Park Geon-ho?\u201dI glanced at Park Geon-ho, who was hunting monsters not far away. It was not difficult for me to understand the intention of the words to help Park Geon-ho. Even if it wasn\u2019t, I was thinking of joining forces with Park Geon-ho, so I immediately nodded my head.\u201cThen what about that monster?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201dSince it was like this, I had no choice but to believe and do what I had to do. I looked back at Kim Woo-jin.\u201cStay with Min Ah-rin-ssi. Be careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026why are you worried about me? You be careful.\u201dFortunately, Kim Woo-jin seemed to have come to his senses. Yet his eyes fluttered anxiously.I left Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin behind and flew to Park Geon-ho. With a considering gaze, I looked at this situation where guild members and monsters were fighting. If I used my ability hastily, my team members would be swept away in an explosion.\u201cTeam leader.\u201d\u201cYou are\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have time to introduce myself. I cut the chase and got to the point.\u201cTeam leader\u2019s ability, what must be kept in order to detonate an iron ball as a bomb?\u201dIt was something I needed to know in order to implement my plan.\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cDo I have to fly with the iron ball by touching it? Or is it possible to explode if you can see them, Team leader? What is your range of abilities?\u201dHis eyes looked down at me with caution. It was understandable. Each of the ability users had their own limitations, which were fatal weaknesses. It was information that could not be easily said under any circumstance.\u201cMy ability is wind. It\u2019s possible to blow things up or move them where you want them to go.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who had accumulated a lot of experience in gates, understood what I was saying without further explanation.\u201cYou mean you can move the iron ball to the desired point?\u201d\u201cYes. I haven\u2019t tried it out, but at least 10 are possible at the same time.\u201d\u201cMy eyes must be on it before it can explode. The situation is urgent, so let\u2019s start right away.\u201dPark Geon-ho handed me the iron balls he was holding. The number was about 20. I took a deep breath and raised my ability.Hwiiing!\u00a0(\ud718\uc774\uc789!)A strong wind whirled around the iron ball in my palm. As I increased my concentration, iron balls began to pop up one by one. When the number exceeded 10 to 15, it was difficult to even breathe with the concentration raised to the limit.Standing behind me, Park Geon-ho raised his arm and pointed out exactly where he wanted to blow it like a compass needle.\u201cAt 11 o\u2019clock, two. If it explodes near the bottom of the skull, the brain explodes and dies immediately. 12 o\u2019clock position, one. 3 o\u2019clock, four. Four o\u2019clock, three. Five o\u2019clock, the rest.\u201dI shifted my gaze following Park Geon-ho\u2019s voice, which calmly commanded with a certain tone. As I stirred my trembling hand, the iron ball flew exactly where I wanted it. As soon as the iron balls arrived in order from 11 to 5 o\u2019clock, explosions erupted from all directions.Boom! Boom!\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe 12 o\u2019clock explosion was so close that I staggered from the smell of ammunition stinging my nose. Park Geon-ho grabbed my shoulder to support me while looking ahead.The two monsters that tried to eat the face of a fallen guild member exploded and became corpses. The upper half of the monster that was swinging its arms at the fleeing guild member also disappeared, and the monsters running towards us were torn to pieces by the explosion.Kyaaak! Kwaak!Kyaaak!However, there were still many monsters left. The guild members, who barely came to their senses, quickly raised their abilities and stared at the hordes of monsters running from the other side.\u201cOne more time.\u201dPark Geon-ho handed me a handful of iron balls he took out of his battle vest pocket. A cold sweat ran down my cheek.It was not as easy as I thought to move several iron balls exactly to the desired point. I forced the unstable energy to gather in my heart.\u201cTeam leader! The long-distance team has lined up!\u201d\u201cClose-distance team: 7 people are currently on standby!\u201dKyaaa! Kyek!The monster, which I thought was quite far away, was already in front of me. As I floated the iron balls in the air one by one, I said softly, \u201cPlease give the command.\u201dPark Geon-ho looked down at me and raised one eyebrow. He looked unhappy with my attitude, but I didn\u2019t have time to care.Park Geon-ho raised his arm like before. It was different from just now when guild members and monsters were mixed. Now, the monsters were flocking from one place, so it was easier to deal with.\u201cDivide what you have and send in the first round. When the bomb explodes, the monster in the lead will be knocked down and the ranged team will attack from behind. When the long-distance team stops attacking, send in the second round. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI lifted my lips up and smiled, even though I felt a piercing headache.\u201cNow.\u201dAt the command of Park Geon-ho, three of the several iron balls that floated in the air were fired at a high speed. The moment the iron ball hit the running monster\u2019s brain, a strong explosion occurred.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: You guys sure are busy\u2026 seems like clearing a dungeon is a lot more hard work than what video games say;;Rin: Han Yi-gyeol\u2026 His weakness is his body.

The corpses of monsters, killed in the explosion, were trampled on by swarms of monsters coming from behind.\u201cAttack!\u201dThe long-distance team unleashed their abilities at the running monsters. Ice shot like sharp arrows and lightning struck from the sky. Each of the various abilities tore and exploded the monsters apart.Kyaak! Kyek!The bodies gradually piled up, but there were still many monsters rushing towards them. The long-distance team was bewildered.\u201cDamn, there are too many!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sick of this.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t pierce through their hide.\u201d\u201cAim for the head! That\u2019s the weak point.\u201dThe opponents were grade S monsters. Because the attacks of B-rank abilities did not work, they could not exert their power in battle. When the long-distance team\u2019s attack was over, Park Geon-ho opened his mouth.\u201cSecond round.\u201dUrrgh, I groaned and threw out three iron balls. Low-pitched laughter was heard from me.You son of a bitch, you seem to be happy to get a very useful launcher. I\u2019m only enduring this because I\u2019m in a hurry to deal with the monsters.Kuuung! Boom!There was another explosion as the monsters neared the iron balls I threw. I got used to the deafening explosion.\u201cThe long-distance team is ready!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, I and the long-distance team will focus on attacking the middle area. Let the close-distance team take the lead.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe close-distance team, who was watching, blocked the front by holding their weapons out at Park Geon-ho\u2019s command.As I struggled to even breathe, Park Geon-ho said, \u201cThe third round.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI want to go home.I bit my lip and threw out the iron balls.* * *\u201cHah, hah\u2026\u201dLooking at the monster corpses, I bent down and let out a harsh breath. It was the first time I had squeezed my abilities like this, so it was difficult to catch my breath. I felt a jagged agitation and touched my forehead. The headache was much stronger than before. It seemed to be a side effect of using my abilities to the limit.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dI wiped the cold sweat and stood up. At least breathing had become a bit easier. Park Geon-ho, who looked at me with a wrinkled brow, smiled bitterly.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem very familiar with this kind of battle scene. You look pale.\u201d\u201cThis is my first gate.\u201d\u201cAs expected. You\u2019ll feel better if you go to a healer and regain some energy.\u201dEven if I wouldn\u2019t feel better, I was thinking of going back to Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, so I nodded and went past Park Geonho.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dPark Geon-ho suddenly grabbed my wrist. Park Geon-ho\u2019s hands, belonging to a man who was 180 cm tall, were big enough to wrap around my wrist.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dWhat\u2019s up with names all of a sudden? I blinked, tired, and looked up at Park Geon-ho.\u201cAre you part of our guild? Why haven\u2019t I seen you before?\u201d\u201cWhy all of a sudden\u2026 Please let go of me.\u201d\u201cIf you answer, I will let you go.\u201dSigh. I sighed and pondered. Could I say that I was independent? Since Cheon Sa-yeon brought me here at his own will, there was no reason to hide it.I was trying to stay down low, but I was probably doomed. I said while waving my captured hand, \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen me because I\u2019m not a member of the Requiem Guild.\u201d\u201cA mercenary? Hmm. Did the Master call you over?\u201dAlthough I was not a mercenary, I nodded as if it was true that Cheon Sa-yeon brought me here.\u201cI\u2019ve answered, so take off your hands.\u201dEven though I deliberately said it coldly, Park Geon-ho shrugged his shoulders and let go of my hand, no sign of being offended. As I returned to Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, complaining inwardly, I saw Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back in the midst of a battle with the mid-boss monster.Kkiiiik, kkiiik.Cut at least once, the monster\u2019s shoulders were burning with red flames. Cheon Sa-yeon seemed like he was at ease, avoiding the scythe that cut through the air at a speed that was too hard to follow with my eyes.I couldn\u2019t believe he looked comfortable against monsters that were so strong that even I couldn\u2019t fight against them once when they got close to grade S. I realized once again that Cheon Sa-yeon was also an SS-rank person like Ha Tae-heon.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes. Is everything okay?\u201dIt was Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin. Min Ah-rin, who came closer, looked around at the injured and said, \u201cThe healer team is all safe. There are more injured, so I\u2019ll have to go. Is Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0injured anywhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. It must be urgent, so go ahead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go help too.\u201d\u201cPlease make sure you rest.\u201dKim Woo-jin, likely because his conscience hurt from being protected, offered to help the healers. After looking at the back of the healer team and Kim Woo-jin, who rushed to the injured guild members, I turned my gaze back to Cheon Sa-yeon.Kiiiii! Kkiiiik!It wouldn\u2019t be easy to dodge the swinging sickle, but Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s steps were light as if he was out for a walk. The monster trembled, red eyes turned toward Cheon Sa-yeon, who had avoided all of its attacks.\u2018It\u2019s strange.\u2019Black smoke crept up from the blue scythe. Even though it was quite far away, I could feel the chill up to here. I watched Cheon Sa-yeon dodged an even faster attack.\u2018Why\u2026\u2019\u2026 did he look like he was very familiar with it?In the battle between the monster and Cheon Sa-yeon, the winner was already decided. Cheon Sa-yeon moved smoothly as if he already knew how and from which direction the monster was going to attack.Yes, it was like he memorized all the patterns.I thought of Cheon Sa-yeon, who had no reaction to the appearance of a grade S+ monster. Perhaps\u2026Kkiiik, chaeng!Cheon Sa-yeon, who blocked the huge scythe falling over his head with his sword, slashed it with a gentle movement then bowed his body to avoid the attack that followed while drawing the sword crosswise. A new flame was planted on the monster, prompting a terrifying scream that was hard to hear. The fire already burning on its shoulder had swallowed its right arm. The monster, who was twisting its body strangely, screamed and started swinging the sickle with its left arm.Kwaaang! Bang!The sand and dust rose thickly, and the figure of Cheon Sa-yeon was hidden. Through the hazy smoke, Cheon Sa-yeon and the giant scythe were blurrily seen jumping up the ground. Immediately after that.Boom!There was the sound of something huge collapsing. At the same time, the chill that had been holding me back disappeared. I carefully walked in the direction of Cheon Sa-yeon.Kkik, kkigik, gigik. Geuk.The monster that had collapsed to the ground was burning with its neck twisting like a broken machine. The tip of the sword dripping bright red blood relentlessly pierced the monster\u2019s head. The fire that was burning around the sword and monster disappeared.Cheon Sa-yeon, who killed the monster, was so put together that he didn\u2019t look like a person who was just in a battle. Not a single drop of sweat was dripping from the white skin visible under the slightly dishevelled black hair. The figure standing on the black monster looked noble, like a priest who had slain the devil.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026ah.\u201dI looked at him unconsciously. I quickly looked away and rubbed my nape. I felt like I\u2019d been caught\u2026Cheon Sa-yeon, who looked at me for a while, said with a strange smile, \u201cYou seem to like my face quite a bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026huh? No, it\u2019s not that.\u201d\u201cSo, what is it then?\u201d\u2026you son of a bitch.I answered, squinting my eyes at Cheon Sa-yeon, \u201cEverything is accounted for. There are no deaths and the injured are currently being treated by the healer team.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon glanced at the team behind me as he wiped the blood from his sword.\u201cThere are no deaths.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou really are good, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dI blinked my eyes. Now, this was\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a compliment, but sarcasm.\u201cIt\u2019s not me, but Team Leader Park Geon-ho\u2019s skills.\u201d\u201cNo. If Park Geon-ho had been alone, someone would have died.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what he wanted to say. What was wrong with him when no one died and everything was well organized?\u2018Well, when did he find out?\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon was tricky\u2014it couldn\u2019t be that he realized it at our first meeting? Giving up on deep thoughts, I said something else, \u201cYou should go to a healer.\u201d\u201cHealer?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re hurt. It\u2019s still bleeding.\u201dI frowned and pointed to Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s hand, which was dripping with blood. How could blood flow so much with just a cut from the sword? Don\u2019t tell me the pain got worse as he progressively lost blood?\u201cAh, this.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon waved his injured hand as if it didn\u2019t hurt. Drops of blood splattered here and there.\u201cI cut myself with this sword. It\u2019s an S-class sword, so the wound doesn\u2019t heal easily. I can just bandage it up.\u201d\u201cNo, doesn\u2019t that give more reasons to get treated by a healer?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m stronger than this sword.\u201dHe looked at the healers busily running among the injured.\u201cIt is already too much for those three healers to handle those injured. I don\u2019t need to get treated.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was genuinely surprised by that. To be honest, I thought that if it was Cheon Sa-yeon, he would be healed by a healer right away.I was somewhat embarrassed. I guess I\u2019d been looking at Cheon Sa-yeon too narrowly. No, but he really is a son of a bitch\u2026\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cEveryone must be tired, so let\u2019s rest, focus on recovery, and move tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dI looked at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back, who was in conversation with Park Geon-ho, with a complicated mind.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: woooo, fight\u2019s finally over. I wonder how things will play out between CSY and HYG.Rin: Lolol Sa-yeon always didn\u2019t waste any chance to flirt with Yi-gyeol (\u2267\u25bd\u2266)Also, it becomes more obvious that Sa-yeon probably was a regressor, reincarnator, returnee, or\u2026 whatever it called. Did you notice that in the previous chapter, Yi-gyeol got the feeling that Sa-yeon had somewhat empty eyes while looking at the second attack?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, after healing the injured and resting, the team moved on without delay. Everyone looked tired because it was right after a tough battle, but it was definitely the healer team who looked particularly tired. Min Ah-rin stumbled with a pale face.\u201cAre you okay? Do you want me to carry you?\u201dWith a tired smile to my worried question, Min Ah-rin said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sick or anything\u2026 I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look too well, though.\u201d\u201cUm, how should I say this\u2026\u201d Min Ah-rin pressed on her eyes with her hands. \u201cGoing to work the next day after working overtime? Drinking energy drinks and staying up all night for 3 days to finish a report?\u201d\u201c\u2026pardon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like that. My energy is running out, but I don\u2019t have any pain\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I understand.\u201d I nodded, barely understanding the explanation.Min Ah-rin sighed and continued. \u201cBut this is good enough. If I use my ability more, I get a headache and it\u2019s really exhausting to walk.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, I used my abilities a lot earlier and I got a headache.\u201d\u201cIt is one of the most common side effects. If it gets worse, you may vomit blood or faint, so be careful. If possible, it\u2019s good to replenish your energy from the healer.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI was perplexed inside. I thought it was just a headache and that it was a little hard to breathe, but you could vomit blood and faint?I thought carefully about the contents of the novel, but nowhere was a scene written in which Ha Tae-heon vomited blood or fainted by using his abilities a lot. As you could see, he was definitely the main character.Even if I read the novel, the main character Ha Tae-heon was the main focus, so I had nothing but this basic knowledge. With Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, there were not enough people around to ask questions, so this unexpected information was very important to me. I admired Min Ah-rin.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0knows a lot of things.\u201dWhen I said it with a big smile, Min Ah-rin smiled and her ears reddened.\u201cWh-what. This is\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dIt was then Kim Woo-jin, who was quietly listening to Min Ah-rin\u2019s conversation with me from behind her, suddenly interrupted, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to ask me?\u201d he asked in a very unhappy voice. The way he pouted his lips, it looked like he was upset.\u2018Suddenly asking such a question\u2026\u2019I wasn\u2019t curious about anything. What did I have to ask about? I scratched my head, pondered over it, and barely found something to ask.\u201cHow are you feeling about coming to the gate?\u201d\u201c\u2026it sucks.\u201d\u201cRight? It sucks, right? You must be thinking, \u2018Ah, why didn\u2019t I listen to that bastard?\u2019 Right? You regret it, right?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Kim Woo-jin shouted, as if I hit the nail on the head. It was like a kitten threatening a person. That was to say, he wasn\u2019t intimidating.\u201cWhat do you mean by no? Your face says that you\u2019ve had a hard time running away from monsters.\u201d\u201cUh, my face? Did I become ugly?\u201d Kim Woo-jin hurriedly asked as he covered his face with his hands, surprised.I grinned at the sight. \u201cWhat a funny question, asking if you became ugly. You seem to think you were never ugly in the first place,\u201d I teased, as Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face quickly turned red.\u201cOh my, how cute,\u201d Min Ah-rin helped.\u201cWell. It\u2019s not an ugly face.\u201d\u201cOf course. Isn\u2019t Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0popular among young people? He\u2019s exactly what an idol on TV looks like.\u201d\u201cHis style is definitely flashy. His hair is red; he has piercings.\u201d\u201cHey, shut up, will you?\u201dI sighed deeply and shook my head. \u201cAigo, look at the way he talks. That\u2019s why he\u2019s still single.\u201d\u201cWh-what?\u201d\u201cNo, Yi-gyeol-ssi. I heard it\u2019s good to be a little rough these days.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhat was that? I tilted my head at the incomprehensible taste. Wasn\u2019t it better to be kind?\u201cYes. There is such a thing. A man who is warm only to his woman and harsh to others.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering since you\u2019ve mentioned it, how does a person like that have a social life?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know? I\u2019ve only seen it in dramas, not in real life.\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201dKim Woo-jin, with angry eyes, glared at me. Why only me\u2026? Feeling a glare so cold like frost in midsummer weather, I felt like I was being unfairly picked on. Well, I teased him a bit, but I think I praised him too.Contemplating a bit, I asked cautiously, \u201cHey, Kim Woo-jin\u2026 I\u2019m just asking just in case.\u201d\u201c\u2026what,\u201d Kim Woo-jin responded with a slightly softened tone.\u201cHave you ever been in a relationship?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI mean, I ask because\u2026 ah.\u201dKim Woo-jin grabbed me by the collar with angry eyes that I had never seen on him before.\u201cYou bastard\u2026 Do you really want to die?\u201d\u201cAck, let go first\u2026\u201dI thought it would be easy, but his hands\u2019 strength was no joke. I reached out to Min Ah-rin next to me for help, but she only looked at me with an interested expression and didn\u2019t save me.Ah, this feeling of betrayal. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no one to trust in the world\u2026Kugugung!\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cA monster appeared!\u201d\u201cGet ready to rank it!\u201dThe ground shook violently and Park Geon-ho, who was leading the team at the forefront, shouted. Everyone who had been joking around until now turned serious in an instant.I hurriedly got away from Kim Woo-jin and flew into the air. A horde of monsters was seen pouring out from the west, blowing up dust.\u201cWest, check it out! They\u2019re S-grade!\u201dWere they only coming from the west? I dryly swallowed my saliva as my hair fluttered in the wind.\u201cNo. This\u2026\u2019I realized it intuitively. This attack.\u201cSouth, check it out! They\u2019re S-grade!\u201d\u201cEast, check it out! They\u2019re S-grade!\u201d\u201cNo, North, they\u2019re\u2026 S-grade\u2026\u201dIt was different from before.I turned counterclockwise. There were dozens of monsters running towards us with their mouths gaping open coming from all directions. There was no time. At that speed, we had to face the monsters in the next 5 minutes.I came down near Cheon Sa-yeon and stood behind him. It was to check how we were going to organize our ranks. To the guild members who had gathered around him, Cheon Sa-yeon said, \u201cThe healer, the identification team, and the non-attacking personnel will gather in the centre, and take the following positions, in order from the inside: B-rank, A-rank, and S-rank.\u201d\u201cWe will distribute A-rank and S-rank evenly to minimize damage.\u201d Park Geon-ho took over Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words.\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked back at me, touching his lips as if thinking about something. He looked as calm as when he found a grade S+ monster.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, what about you?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cAny ideas?\u201dWhen Cheon Sa-yeon asked me a question, all eyes turned to me in an instant. As I was facing the guild members who were bewildered as to who the Master was asking opinions from, a cold sweat broke out behind my back. Cheon Sa-yeon, you crazy bastard.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI pondered for a while. Of course\u2026 I had something in mind. However, I didn\u2019t want to talk in a situation where the focus was on me. Anyway, it would be difficult for guild members to accept my proposal for the first time without any doubts.\u201cThere is none,\u201d I answered with a forced smile, after weighing what I should do. Please, let\u2019s move on.\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201dThe corners of my lips trembled with all my might, whose hopes were being shattered. Stop. What do you want from me now?\u201cI really am not.\u201d\u201cReally? What a shame.\u201d While he responded with emphasis to each syllable, Cheon Sa-yeon nodded surprisingly easily.Not, I thought to myself.\u201cThen let\u2019s just move on. About half of our team members will probably be badly injured or killed, but it can\u2019t be helped. Too bad, if Han Yi-gyeol suggested a good idea, no one would die.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dCrazy bastard.I let out a hot breath boiling in anger and bit my lips.Among the confused guild members, Park Geon-ho, Kim Woo-jin, and Min Ah-rin could be seen.Cheon Sa-yeon, who stood with his back to them, looked at me and smiled. The way he looked at me meant, \u201cWhat do you want to do now?\u201dI was going crazy.\u201c\u2026I have\u2026 an opinion.\u201d I smiled, furious, at Cheon Sa-yeon.Now that I was here, I just had to go all out.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: haha, CSY you crazy bastard\u2026 anyway, I\u2019m really loving the trio\u2019s interactions.

I nodded and continued.\u201cI control the wind. I can fly or move objects.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who made eye contact with me, was smiling, but his black eyes were calm. He was observing me while hiding something.\u201cI will fly with the team leader to a certain distance and plant an iron ball in a way that surrounds the team. Currently, the monsters are approaching from the west side, so if you set it off on time, we can delay them.\u201dSome of the guild members who listened to my explanation made the expression like it wasn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201cAfter that, I will continue to fly counterclockwise with the team leader and break the flow by detonating bombs near the middle of the group of monsters. It probably won\u2019t be able to stop all monsters, but it will give us a chance to catch our breath. Looking at the number of monsters, I think we have to go around three times.\u201dI looked at Park Geon-ho for confirmation. Park Geon-ho nodded his head as if he understood. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was listening quietly, said, \u201cIt sounds like a lot of fun. I\u2019m jealous of Team Leader Park Geon-ho. After that?\u201d\u201cAfter that\u2026\u201dI paused. I didn\u2019t want to do it this way either. I swallowed a sigh.\u201cHow about the Master comes and attacks the monsters that come close? If you move with me, you won\u2019t have to run around on your feet, so I think it\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon looked back at the guild members and smiled. \u201cI accept the plan. We don\u2019t have much time, so get ready for battle. Team Leader Park Geon-ho starts right away with Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dWhen the order was given, everyone moved in order. Even without detailed instructions, everyone skillfully gathered up their weapons and stood in their designated position. I approached Park Geon-ho, who was looking around at the guild members who had finished preparations and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201dI stood close with my arms wrapped around Park Geon-ho\u2019s shoulders and neck. Park Geon-ho smiled at me and hugged my waist halfway.I carefully lifted my body and Park Geon-ho into the air so I wouldn\u2019t slip up. As we went up higher, the guild members in line could be seen below our feet. There was a circle around the healer team and non-attacking abilities in the centre.\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard on you.\u201dThe wind grew stronger as the distance from the ground widened a bit. Park Geon-ho\u2019s voice was heard through the sound of the wind passing through my ears.\u201cWhat\u2019s hard?\u201d\u201cThe Master seems to like you.\u201dI looked at Park Geon-ho with eyes asking if he was serious.\u201cYou must be mistaken.\u201dIt must be an illusion. I didn\u2019t want to hear such a terrible thing even in my dreams. Park Geon-ho pretended he didn\u2019t hear me speak and just said what he wanted to say.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lie that the Master hired you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCertainly, this is worth hiring for.\u201dWhile flying towards the destination, Park Geon-ho did not stop talking. I\u2019d like you to shut up because I was not in a situation to chat freely.\u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary A-rank user.\u201dIf Kim Woo-jin heard him, he would have been outraged that A-rank was considered normal, but the one he was talking to right now was an S-rank ability user.Compared to Park Geon-ho, I belonged to the average axis.\u201cYou know how to make funny jokes.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for you.\u201dI knew I was an outsider anyway, so I put aside my manners and let myself go. Park Geon-ho\u2019s eyes lit up at my rude reply.\u201cYou have a temper.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it as a compliment.\u201dI stopped moving and looked around. Even at this moment, a group of monsters approaching in real-time could be seen.\u201cIs this place fine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dPark Geon-ho pulled out an iron ball from his pocket. When I dropped the iron balls, I lowered them closer to the ground to make sure they wouldn\u2019t get too buried in the sand when they fell.Park Geon-ho threw an iron ball onto the sand as if sowing a seed. It didn\u2019t matter if it was a little covered in sand. If Park Geon-ho could see even a part of an iron ball, it was a bomb that could be detonated at any time.Park Geon-ho and I continued to move and plant iron balls. It was fortunate that he had brought plenty of iron balls. The iron balls we had now scattered would be a very useful first line of defence for us.Starting from the west, passing through the south, and returning to the west after passing through the east and north, the iron balls were planted in the ground.\u201cAre you ready?\u201dI saw a monster approaching right in front of me. The monsters didn\u2019t notice me and Park Geon-ho floating in the sky.\u201cSure.\u201dKwaaak! Kwaah!With a ravenous cry, the monster came closer to the iron ball. I counted in my head.3, 2, 1.Booom!The iron balls began to explode. The monster that stepped on the iron ball was shattered to the point that it was difficult to even recognize its shape, and the monsters next to it and behind it were burned with their lower body blown away or engulfed in explosions. The surroundings were filled with monsters\u2019 pained screams.\u201cI will start moving right away.\u201dIt was a successful start. I crossed the air straight toward the south. Bombs exploded like dominoes with a roaring sound wherever I and Park Geon-ho passed. Each time, the flesh of the monsters exploded back and forth.Kyeeek! Kyeek!The monsters approached steadily after stepping on fallen monsters. We returned to the west after exploding the planted iron balls to the south, east, and north.\u201cIf possible, it would be better for two people to do it.\u201dPark Geon-ho couldn\u2019t use both of his hands because he had to hold onto my waist with one hand and hold the iron balls in his other hand. I nodded and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to change the position of the iron ball while flying.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. Just throw it.\u201dI looked down. The monsters were different in each direction. The west had cockroach-like monsters with black shells and thin wings; the south had bumpy, round caterpillar-like monsters; and the east had dragonfly monsters with bat wings.Finally, the monsters with the largest body and countless hairs and legs were crawling from the north. Was it a special bug? As I watched on, goosebumps appeared on the nape of my neck.\u201cThrow it.\u201dAt Park Geon-ho\u2019s words, I slowly dropped the iron balls in my hand one by one. The monsters, which were running below us, had their shells broken and burned as bombs fell from the sky. Green sticky blood spurted into the air.Kweeehk! Kwaah!A few monsters burned to the ground and scattered their ranks. The horde of monsters, which previously headed forward without any blockage, fell into confusion. After throwing a few more iron balls, we went straight south.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dLooking down at the caterpillars crawling through the sand, I felt terrible. As in the west, we dropped iron balls to detonate bombs, but unlike in the west, the monsters immediately recognized us and raised their heads in unison. A black hole, like there was nothing in it, appeared in the plain body, and the hidden teeth were revealed.\u201cGet out of here!\u201dWhile I was bewildered by how easily we were discovered, I heard Park Geon-ho\u2019s cry out. As we hurriedly turned to the right, a black liquid brushed past us.\u201cAck!\u201d\u201cJust focus on dodging.\u201dStarting with that, black liquid poured towards us. Having returned the iron balls I had to Park Geon-ho, I focused only on avoiding the attacks.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dI flew through the sky avoiding the liquid at a high speed. Occasionally, an attack that I did not notice was barely avoided because Park Geon-ho pulled me.Kwaang! Kugugung!Kkiiiiiii! Kkiiiiik!While dodging, the iron balls exploded into the monster\u2019s chubby body. However, it was difficult to hold on as the angry monsters shot more liquid. In the end, we had to stop attacking earlier than we did in the west and moved east.\u201cHah, hah...\u201dI bit hard in my mouth so that I wouldn\u2019t lose my mind as I breathed heavily. In the east, there was a monster that could fly just like us. It wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201cHah, I\u2019ll go higher.\u201dI hardly caught my breath. It was a bit embarrassing to be in someone else\u2019s arms and gasp for breath, but I couldn\u2019t help it.Pudeudeuk! Pudeuk!Park Geon-ho dropped the iron balls as I opened some distance from the bat-winged monsters.\u00a0Booom, looking at the bombs exploding under my feet, Park Geon-ho told me, \u201cWe\u2019d better get through here quickly.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t we have two more laps to go? It\u2019s dangerous if it\u2019s like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026there are too many monsters.\u201dAs I and Park Geon-ho failed to handle them, it would put a burden on the team members gathered in the centre. I increased my movement speed by avoiding the monsters that attacked me.\u201cThe more enemies you face, the better it is to calmly deal with it without being hasty. It would be a greater loss for you to fall from exhausting your ability.\u201dPark Geon-ho\u2019s voice was firm. After contemplating, I finally agreed and left the east. The following monsters exploded in the air after being hit by an iron ball that Park Geon-ho threw.Fortunately, the north had no means of attacking us in the air like the east did. They were the biggest and most disgusting ones, but they were powerless against the numerous iron balls that fell from the air. Looking down at the monsters exploding here and there, Park Geon-ho and I had the same thought.\u201cWe just need to focus on the west and the north.\u201d\u201cIt would be better to entrust the south and east to our team members.\u201dPark Geon-ho handed over half of the iron balls left to me. About 100 or so. Including Park Geon-ho\u2019s, there were 200 iron balls. Holding the iron balls in my hand, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with and go back.\u201dT/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Blergh, why are all the monsters just huge bugs? ><;; on a side note, I really like the imagery of PGH holding MC\u2019s waist, ehehe.Rin: This chapter was full of Yi-gyeol with Geon-ho lolThe next ones came back with Sa-yeon and Yi-gyeol as the main couple (~\u203e\u25bf\u203e)~ *slappedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The monsters, whose huge bodies shook in pain, buried themselves in the sand little by little to avoid the explosions, and before long most monsters disappeared into the sand.\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201dThe sand that the monsters had crawled in bulged as it moved.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not S-grade for nothing. Things got complicated.\u201dPark Geon-ho frowned.The monsters that went into the sand were slower than before, but they were steadily moving forward towards the team. With monsters popping out of the sand in front of the team who was already distracted by the battle\u2026I returned the remaining iron balls to Park Geon-ho and said, \u201cWe\u2019d better go back. It would be better to go and check if the situation is okay, and point out the locations of the monsters that hid in the sand.\u201dAfter seeing Park Geon-ho nodding, we immediately turned and headed towards the team members. The team members in full swing could be seen through the sandstorm that obscured the view. Fortunately, they were holding up well and there was no distraction in the ranks. Over the piled up monster corpses, monsters from the south and from the east were constantly rushing in.Kyaaaak! Kkiii!The east monster\u2019s body was cut in half by the sword burning red with the blood fire ability. Cheon Sa-yeon, who cut down monsters with neat movements, was surrounded by hot flames all around. The monster that rushed at him burned and turned to ashes without even getting close.As I approached Cheon Sa-yeon, I could feel a heat so strong that it was difficult to keep my eyes open. A cold sweat formed on my exhausted body from using my abilities.\u201cMaster.\u201dKkiiii, kkiik! Kkyaaak!Numerous monsters that had caught on fire twisted their bodies and screamed loudly. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was standing in the middle, lowered his sword at my call and turned his head. After dropping Park Geon-ho to the ground, I moved a little closer to Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cDid you finish things up?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dI pondered for a moment on how to explain. Although the momentum was good, the result was not satisfactory.\u201cSouth and east were not very good, meanwhile west and north were half finished, but the rest hid in the sand.\u201d\u201cIn the sand. So it might appear suddenly from under our feet.\u201dI bit my lips. The team was holding up better than I thought, but there were still a lot of monsters left. Maybe we backed down too easily in the south and east. Even if it was dangerous, I should have tried to attack more.Inevitably, I felt regret. I felt sorry for the guild members who were tangled with monsters, wielding weapons and fighting fiercely with their abilities.\u201cCome closer, Han Yi-gyeol,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said to me while I was wondering whether I should tell Park Geon-ho to go back. I lifted my downcast gaze and looked at him.The fire that had been burning as if it would engulf everything that came near had already faded. The surrounding air, which was too hot to breathe, had also become better. I slowly walked towards Cheon Sa-yeon.Smiling as he watched me approaching, Cheon Sa-yeon soon took off his red suit jacket and put it over my head.\u201c\u2026what is this?\u201dI was dumbfounded by the unexpected behaviour. Cheon Sa-yeon said with a deft smile, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what\u2019? I\u2019m taking care of the rest.\u201dThen he lifted me up. Surprised by my suddenly light body, I grabbed him by the shoulder with both hands.\u201cWa-wait a minute\u2026!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon touched my buttocks with his lower arm and my thighs were held in his hand. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face, which could only be seen if he raised his head, became incredibly close. Terrified, I grabbed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s shoulder, stretched out my arms and pushed my upper body back. (Kinda like this pic below)\u201cCrazy, what kind of pose\u2026!\u201d\u201cCalm down.\u201dAs the flames subsided, Cheon Sa-yeon held my thighs tighter as he cut down the monsters that rushed in.\u201cI\u2019d love to hold you like a princess in a fairy tale, but I have to swing my sword\u2026 I can\u2019t help it. You should be satisfied with this.\u201dWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201cI\u2019d rather be on your back!\u201d\u201cWhat if a monster attacks from behind? Are you trying to take my place? What a great shield you are.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dUnable to find a proper answer, Cheon Sa-yeon bent his eyes and smiled brightly as he licked his lips.\u201cThat jacket is an A-class fire-resistance item, so you wear it well. It\u2019ll be difficult for you if you don\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s endure this. Now is not the time to be ashamed. They say to endure three times is enough to avoid murder.\u2018Don\u2019t think, don\u2019t think\u2026 fuck.\u2019I muttered swear words that only Cheon Sa-yeon could hear while leaning on him. As I relaxed my body, Cheon Sa-yeon raised the firepower again and said, \u201cTeam Leader Park Geon-ho, go back to your original position and participate in the battle. When monsters appear from the west and north, report immediately.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dPark Geon-ho\u2019s reply with a smile came from behind. Were you watching\u2026 My face turned red with shame.\u201cWell, then.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon swung his sword lightly. \u201cLet\u2019s see how good our handsome Yi-gyeol\u2019s skills are.\u201d\u201c\u2026what\u2019s with that creepy way of saying my name?\u201dI was fed up and used my powers. A light wind gently wrapped around Cheon Sa-yeon who was hugging me. Cheon Sa-yeon flew straight forward and swung his sword.Kkyeeek! Kyaak!Hot flames moved according to the sword\u2019s trajectory, sparks and ashes were scattered randomly. Five monsters that were about to attack the pale-faced guild member were instantly engulfed in flames and turned into ashes with one attack by Cheon Sa-yeon.Tak, the strength of the wind was increased a little more in line with the movement of Cheon Sa-yeon who jumped off the ground. Cheon Sa-yeon started to deal with the monsters in the east in an instant while the falling speed slowed.Watching the monsters writhing with their bodies on fire, I grabbed the jacket that covered my body. As strong as Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s ability was, it was too dangerous for me, an A-rank.Cheon Sa-yeon, who lightly turned around to avoid the monsters that rushed from above his head, slashed his sword from the top to the right. The monster was cut by the sword and the monsters next to it all burned.Even the monsters S-rank Park Geon-ho had difficulty with died with a scream every time he swung his sword. I could feel the difference in grade with my skin.With his superior physical abilities combined with his strength, Cheon Sa-yeon swept through the battlefield without hesitation. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was excitedly swinging his sword and slicing monsters, said with rare joy, \u201cIt\u2019s quite useful.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon hugged me tighter.\u201cLet\u2019s go a bit more wild, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 ah!\u201dI groaned at the ever-increasing heat. The flames surrounding the sword became redder and something muddy dripped down.\u201cWrap my fire with the wind.\u201dHe used his powers towards the roaring fire that seemed to burn his body. A dull pain swept through my head as the energy that escaped doubled.\u201cMove your powers to make the fire spread farther at the right time I swing it.\u201d\u201cWait. It\u2019s hard to keep up even now, how can I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can do it.\u201dAfter those words, Cheon Sa-yeon moved again. He bent his waist to avoid the attack of the southern monster rushing toward us with its black mouth wide open and he swung the sword strongly sideways. The fire attached itself to its gigantic body, quickly burning the flesh as it spread throughout the body. With the sound of something tearing apart, blood burst out and wet our clothes.I focused my mind on every movement of Cheon Sa-yeon. The steps he took, the direction of his upper body, and the aim of the tip of the sword. It wrapped everything in the wind and moved the wind to handle monsters faster and more accurately.\u201cHah, hah\u2026\u201dWhen I used my ability like water, I became more and more suffocated and my breathing became unstable. My head, which used to hurt like being stabbed by a needle, was now like being hit with a hammer.I clenched my teeth and rested my head on Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s shoulder. My body, which had not been able to rest for a while, cried out for rest.Behind Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back, the corpses and ashes of numerous monsters were seen. The number of living monsters was noticeably reduced.Kugugugung!As soon as I thought we were done, the earth trembled terribly. Park Geon-ho, who knew the cause of the trembling, was the first to shout.\u201cMore to the west and north!\u201dThe monsters that had been hiding in the sand had arrived. Monsters crawling out of the sand while moving their numerous legs came rushing towards this side. The guild members in charge of the south and the east, which were neatly organized, moved quickly.\u201cDisgusting\u2026\u201d I murmured unconsciously as I looked at the northern monsters I encountered again. I\u2019m sick and tired, but I have to deal with giant bugs.\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said with a smile. If only I could.\u201cI have to look to get the timing right\u2026\u201dIt was hard to speak loudly. I couldn\u2019t bother with honorifics. I blinked, feeling a cold sweat running down my cheeks.\u201cClose your eyes and do whatever you want. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon swung his legs and slashed the running monsters effortlessly. I closed my eyes for the last time.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Oh?

I left only the wind that wrapped around Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body and cut off the rest. As the energy escaping decreased, the headache subsided slightly.Beyond the darkness, the screams of monsters and the sound of fire spreading vividly could be heard. As I took a deep breath, I took in a cool and bitter scent. Did he put on cologne in a place like this?\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dI twitched my eyelids and opened my eyes with difficulty. With a blurry vision, I could see the edge of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s chest I was leaning on.\u201c\u2026are you done?\u201dI could no longer hear the monsters that disturbed my ears previously.\u201cYes, turn off your power.\u201dImmediately after saying that, I removed my wind. That alone made breathing a lot easier. The pain in my head was still there.\u201cYou did a great job,\u201d he said, rubbing my forehead.If there was any reason for him to suddenly act so kindly, then of course\u2014it must be because it was refreshing to him to drain others of their ability to this extent.\u201cThanks to you, I\u2019ve dealt with the monsters without much damage.\u201d\u201cI went through such hardship, so it\u2019s only natural. Even though I wanted to hit you in the middle.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so cold,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon, who took my words playfully, looked at me with a gentle smile.\u201c\u2026what are you looking at?\u201d\u201cI had a very good experience.\u201dIt was only a brief moment, but something deep and dark passed by in his eyes.\u201cI had never thought of using it this way. It\u2019s much better than expected. It was only for a short time, but enough to make me covet it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOh, um. I guess you\u2019re serious.I didn\u2019t know if I should be happy that I was recognized by Cheon Sa-yeon or if I should be angry at how he treated me like I was an object.With a trembling feeling, I replied, \u201cThanks for the compliment, but I\u2019m not very interested. You\u2019re not the kind of person I can handle.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. You definitely don\u2019t have enough energy. It would\u2019ve been nice if I could use it longer.\u201d\u201cThis is normal for an A-rank.\u201dSS-ranks seemed to have a different level of energy. It was kind of disgusting to see him looking fine even after dealing with monsters all day.\u201cIf we\u2019re done, please let me down. It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take you to Min Ah-rin.\u201d\u201cI will go on my own.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t even pretend to hear my request to get off. Fine. How could I even beat you anyway. I gave up on being released and asked another question, \u201cIs everyone okay? Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0and Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cOf course. I recommend taking care of yourself more than anyone else. You were the most in danger.\u201d\u201cPardon? No way. I\u2019m not hurt at all.\u201d\u201cAn ability user is most endangered when they\u2019re out of energy.\u201dIs that so? It\u2019s hard to endure a bad headache. But it\u2019s a lot better than getting hurt.\u201cYou seem to have gotten along quite well with those two.\u201dI glanced sideways at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face, who was looking ahead. I didn\u2019t expect him to ask such a question.As we entered the gate and suffered together, we got closer than before, but it was difficult to confidently say that we were close. Above all, I didn\u2019t think Min Ah-rin or Kim Woo-jin would think that I was close with them.\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re not really that close.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been sticking around people you\u2019re not close to. Don\u2019t you care about them?\u201dIt was true I cared, so I nodded my head.\u201cI care that much, of course I do. How can we say we don\u2019t know each other when we know each other\u2019s faces? It\u2019s better to clear the gate without any problems.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon muttered under his breath. \u201cI was expecting that.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dAs I was about to ask what he meant, I turned my head to Min Ah-rin\u2019s voice. Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin ran through the guild members who were cleaning up the monster corpses.\u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt?\u201dNext to Min Ah-rin, who was worried, Kim Woo-jin shouted in amazement, \u201cDamn, look at your pale face! I thought you were dead.\u201dYou punk.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve used a lot of your abilities, so you\u2019d better get your energy back.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon intervened before I could even say it was okay. Cheon Sa-yeon, who sat me on the rock, sheathed his sword and put on his jacket.\u201cLet Healer Min Ah-rin restore Han Yi-gyeol as the top priority. I\u2019m going to sort things out.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who heard Min Ah-rin\u2019s answer, turned his back without hesitation. Min Ah-rin looked at me with a sympathetic expression and asked, \u201cIt hurts a lot, doesn\u2019t it? You\u2019ll feel better when you get your energy back.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bearable.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing to hide. I\u2019ve been through it too. Could you give me a hand?\u201dAs soon as I reached out to her hand, Min Ah-rin took my hand without hesitation. I felt cool energy on my palm. Min Ah-rin\u2019s energy flowed through my arm and soothed my ability.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dMy soothed energy now gradually increased in size. Originally as small as a fist, my energy gradually grew in size and returned to its original size. My headache was gone and my droopy body was filled with strength.\u201cAs your energy becomes unstable and weaker, your physical condition also deteriorates. Natural recovery takes a long time, so most of them come to a healer.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been working hard.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work. Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0is always welcome.\u201dSeeing how much better I was than before, Min Ah-rin let go of my hand and smiled. She looked a little tired because she gave me energy.\u201cSo, if you get hurt or feel weak, please don\u2019t worry and come to me.\u201d\u201cI will try,\u201d I replied with an awkward smile. Fortunately, Min Ah-rin nodded her head without saying anything, although it was a subtle answer.\u201cHey, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d Kim Woo-jin, who was standing behind Min Ah-rin, called to me in a slightly low voice.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026you,\u201d Kim Woo-jin hesitated, unable to continue speaking. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201cWhat. Say it.\u201dKim Woo-jin opened his mouth with a very complicated expression when I prompted him out of frustration. \u201cWhat is going on between you and the Master?\u201d\u2026what are you talking about.I rubbed my neck at the sudden rush of fatigue. \u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t get along with the Master.\u201dThat\u2019s still the case.\u201cYou know it too.\u201d\u201cWhenever you saw the Master, you cried until you were out of breath. You broke everything around you because you couldn\u2019t control your abilities. You trembled and made a mess and tried to make it right\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDid he? I was reminded of the original owner\u2019s body. Han Yi-gyeol was a very weak person.Most scenes in the novel only showed his movements according to Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s orders, so I didn\u2019t know that it was that much. Come to think of it, after becoming Han Yi-gyeol, I cried a lot in the first dream I had with Cheon Sa-yeon.\u2018It\u2019s a little weird.\u2019Why did Cheon Sa-yeon abandon Han Yi-gyeol so relentlessly? If it was to take advantage of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s ability, it would be way more beneficial to keep him by his side rather than throw him away.When I was reading the novel, I was so focused on Ha Tae-heon that I didn\u2019t know it was weird, so I just skipped it, but now that I thought about it calmly, there were many odd things.I guess I had to spend some time looking into it. If I disregarded it, there might be a problem later.\u201cReally? Yi-gyeol-ssi? I can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d At Kim Woo-jin\u2019s words, Min Ah-rin made a surprised face.\u201cI was really annoyed at the time\u2026 And even with his ability, all he could do was whine.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dMin Ah-rin rolled her eyes as if imagining something and she immediately smiled brightly with red cheeks. Why was she so happy to hear that I cried?\u201c\u2026people are supposed to grow up.\u201d\u201cHah, what growing up? It was all a show, wasn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t you rather be an actor? And not waste time here.\u201d\u201cI know, right. It\u2019s a great skill to be able to fake cry. You\u2019d look good as an actor! I\u2019ll be your number one fan.\u201d\u201cThen I will be the manager.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be an actor, I won\u2019t!\u201dYou two sounded like actors yourself. Either way, these two weren\u2019t normal.\u201cAnyway, you were afraid of the Master until then. Besides, your little sis\u2026 ahem.\u201dKim Woo-jin hurriedly closed his mouth and looked sideways at Min Ah-rin. I didn\u2019t mean to hide my sister\u2019s story from Min Ah-rin, but I answered moderately because it wasn\u2019t something to talk about.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same. I don\u2019t like him very much.\u201d\u201cBut earlier\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was an emergency, so I had no choice. How could we argue when monsters were coming? They should be wiped out quickly.\u201dDespite telling the truth, Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin looked skeptical.\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth. Don\u2019t you know I\u2019m exhausted? I\u2019m just a good tool for him.\u201dIt was then that Kim Woo-jin\u2019s expression softened slightly. Were you jealous because your boss seemed to be close to me? A narrow-minded guy.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0seems uncomfortable with the Master. I think that the Master cares about Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0quite a bit.\u201d\u201cNo way. Don\u2019t say such scary things.\u201d As I shook my head with a straight face, Min Ah-rin didn\u2019t say anything else, but she was still unsure.From Park Geon-ho to Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin. After hearing the same question three times already, my heart pounded nervously.\u2018This isn\u2019t good\u2026\u2019I guess I had to come up with a plan to get away from Cheon Sa-yeon as soon as possible.There was more than one thing to look into. I let out a sigh at the dark days ahead of me.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: I wonder how KWJ and MAR felt when they saw CSY holding MC like that\u2026. ehe.Rin: Kinda mellow in the beginning until the middle part.

The faces of those recovering from the healer\u2019s simple treatment were full of laughter and joy.\u201cHah, I\u2019m so glad,\u201d Min Ah-rin, who came to see the guild members\u2019 condition with the healer team, said with a deep sigh of relief.\u201cThere were so many..

I saw Cheon Sa-yeon talking with Park Geon-ho from afar.Six days had passed since I entered the gate. The destination, where the exit was expected to be, was also quite close.\u2018It\u2019s almost time for the boss to appear.\u2019It was the boss that dropped SS-grade items, so of course, it must be SS-grade.I looked at the guild members who gathered around and made a bonfire. I didn\u2019t think everyone could have imagined that an SS-grade boss would appear. If I had known the truth, I wouldn\u2019t be making a bonfire leisurely.Cheon Sa-yeon, you bastard\u2026 it seems you won\u2019t talk about the boss until the very end.\u2018How the hell did Cheon Sa-yeon find out that this gate is SS-grade?\u2019According to the novel, Cheon Sa-yeon stole the gate from Ha Tae-heon and obtained SS-class items.Which wasn\u2019t helpful. It would\u2019ve been nice to know what kind of monster the boss was.I was lucky today, but I can\u2019t expect to be lucky when dealing with the SS-grade boss. Cheon Sa-yeon would be fine since he was the same grade as the boss, but it was obvious that other members would not even be able to stand properly.\u2018In the end, there is no other way than to leave it to Cheon Sa-yeon himself.\u2019If it was Cheon Sa-yeon, he alone would probably be enough. I remembered Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s moves while he was dealing with the mid-boss monster.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI quickly looked around at the thought. I couldn\u2019t see Cheon Sa-yeon, who had just been with Park Geon-ho before.I was too lazy to look around, but it was quite important to move on. Min Ah-rin grabbed my wrist as I was about to move to find Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cLet\u2019s go together, Yi-gyeol-ssi!\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cEveryone wants to say hi to Yi-gyeol-ssi. Come on!\u201d\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u201dIt was an unexpected development. People greeted me warmly as I was dragged by Min Ah-rin with a bewildered expression.\u201cOh! The one who was held by the Master!\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s right! Hello~ My name is Kim Ji-hoon from the close-range team.\u201dI smiled awkwardly and grabbed the hand that suddenly stretched out to me. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cHis name is Yi-gyeol-ssi. Han Yi-gyeol-ssi!\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi, take this. It\u2019s warm porridge.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you\u2026\u201dIn an instant, a bowl of warm porridge was placed on my hand. Min Ah-rin also kidnapped Kim Woo-jin, who was idling around me, after sitting me in an empty seat. Kim Woo-jin, who was brought over without being given a moment to refuse, had a strange look on his face as he received a bowl of porridge.\u201cOh, I\u2019m starving! Now I\u2019ll live for a little longer.\u201d\u201cYou almost had your neck ripped out by a monster but you\u2019re just hungry?\u201d\u201cHey, why are you talking about monsters now? Making our food taste worse!\u201d\u201cI admit it looked really creepy. Was it the northern type? The monsters that appeared last. I almost threw up when I saw it.\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201d he shouted as he wrinkled his face.Everyone burst into laughter. While I was staring blankly at the scene, Kim Woo-jin tapped my shoulder.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d\u201cOh? Ah.\u201dThen I lowered my gaze and looked at the porridge in the bowl. It was a common vegetable porridge, but the savoury smell made me hungry because of the situation. I carefully scooped out a spoonful and put it in my mouth.\u201cBy the way, umm\u2026 Han Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAre you really independent? The team leader said that you were.\u201d\u201cRight! I thought you were a guild member, but I was very surprised to hear that you were independent.\u201d\u201cYou have good skills, so why are you independent? A-rank, right?\u201d\u201cYour ability is wind, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The team leader and the master just floated in the air.\u201d\u201cAmazing. That takes a lot of energy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThen is it easy to fly?\u201dNumerous questions came from all over the place. I was perplexed by this situation I had never encountered before, so I was covered in a cold sweat. No, was it even okay for news that I was independent to spread like this?I looked around for a moment and then nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m independent\u2026\u201d\u201cUrk, are you really independent?\u201d\u201cWhat a shame! Come join our guild!\u201d\u201cWait, then, which department should you go to? Assistant position?\u201d\u201cStill, he\u2019s an A-rank with an elemental ability, so it\u2019s a waste for him to only assist.\u201d\u201cThen, wouldn\u2019t it be okay if he went with the team leader? When I poked him earlier, it seemed like he was coveting Han Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u2026what? Who did what?\u201cTeam Leader Park, he goes crazy (\ub208 \ub3cc\uc544\uac00\uc796\uc544) when he finds an ability user he likes. It happens a lot.\u201d\u201cHe was already complaining about the lack of people in the team. Once we leave the gate, wouldn\u2019t he just follow Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0around?\u201d\u201cMmh. Exactly\u2026 there\u2019s a big possibility.\u201dI forced myself into the terrible conversation with a smile. \u201cHaha, I don\u2019t see the team leader with that kind of personality\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just the way he looks.\u201d\u201cHis face looks fine. But inside, he\u2019s such a nutcase.\u201d\u201cTeam Leader Park is famous. I\u2019m only telling Han Yi-gyeol-ssi, but if Team Leader Park asks you to come to his team, you should refuse. It\u2019s a real hell of a place.\u201d\u201cJust the team? The Special Operations Division itself is a den of crazy people!\u201d\u201cStill, Team Leader Park is the worst. The last time I ran into his team in the hallway, they were all covered in blood and laughing hard. It was creepy\u2026 yeesh!\u201d\u201cOh my gosh. I heard that they also went to the Middle East gate\u2014is that true?\u201d\u201cThey went last month. I heard they cleared it in four days and four nights.\u201d\u201cWooow, the Middle East is really bad and the inside of the gate is unstable. It\u2019s crazy. If it were me, I would never go in.\u201dI smiled and kept the conversation going back and forth deeply in my mind. If Park Geon-ho offered me a job as they said, I would run away without looking back. I thought only Cheon Sa-yeon was crazy, but Park Geon-ho was also weird.So we all ate and drank and chatted until late at night. Kim Woo-jin, who had been vigilant about the surroundings, was also munching on snacks like he calmed down, and Min Ah-rin talked with the healer team about something and smiled brightly.In the middle of the dark desert, the faces of the people lit by the warm bonfire were at ease as if they had come on a trip. Seeing that, I smiled a little too.\u2018A day or so will be fine.\u2019Looking at the situation, I tried to talk a little bit about the gate with Cheon Sa-yeon and share some rating information with them. But the atmosphere wasn\u2019t right to broach such a subject.Well, I guess we needed this much rest to be able to survive. After a long time, I also stuck to my seat with a relaxed mind.* * *Through hazy consciousness, I could smell burning wood. Blearily, I could see that the fire had been extinguished and only smoke could be seen. I could hear my body cracking when I lifted my bowed head.After I slept with my back roughly lying on piled up luggage, my physical condition was not good. I stretched out my rumpled body and walked to where others were gathering.\u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was standing wrapped in her blanket, looked at me. The air in the early morning, when the deep blue light had subsided, was somehow cool.\u201c\u2026what\u2019s wrong?\u201dI could see the guild members whispering about something. Min Ah-rin, with a complicated expression, answered my question after lowering her voice.\u201cThat\u2026 It seems that the monster corpses have disappeared.\u201d\u201cThe monster corpses?\u201d\u201cYes. The monsters we killed yesterday. We couldn\u2019t deal with them properly because there were too many and they were too large\u2026 but they completely disappeared.\u201dYesterday, I turned my attention to the location where the monster corpses were scattered. As Min Ah-rin said, the place was empty. As if the corpses didn\u2019t exist from the start.\u201cThe corpses had never disappeared before.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel good about this. Not one or two, but many of them disappeared at once.\u201d\u201cWho was awake in the morning?\u201d\u201cMe. But nothing really happened. It was so quiet\u2026 I just realized that they were gone.\u201d\u201cFuckin\u2019 hell, I\u2019m scared enough to die.\u201dAs the commotion grew, Kim Woo-jin came to my side. His brow was wrinkled and his slightly bloodshot eyes looked quite tired.\u201cYou\u2019d better explain it to the team leader first.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dAt my words, a man nodded his head with a serious expression. Last night, he was a guild member of the close-range team who introduced himself as Kim Ji-hoon.\u201cWhere is Team Leader Park?\u201d\u201cHe was with the Master over there\u2026 ah?\u201dThe woman who was explaining to Kim Ji-hoon suddenly stopped all her actions and stood tall. Her surprised face gradually contorted into dismay.\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d\u201cN-no, I\u2026 my body\u2026\u201dSarararak.The sound of flowing fine sand was heard. The woman, who was standing still, gradually began to be buried in the sand. Kim Ji-hoon must have seen the same thing as me, so he quickly grabbed the woman\u2019s arm.\u201cWh-what!\u201d\u201cWhy is the sand\u2026!\u201d\u201cGet out of there quickly!\u201dKim Ji-hoon pulled her with force, but the woman didn\u2019t even budge. The woman, who was sucked into the sand up to her thighs in an instant, cried out with her pale face, \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t move!\u201d\u201cDamn it! What the hell!\u201d\u201cIs there a monster or something? Find out right now!\u201dThe woman\u2019s body was constantly dragged into the sand. I quickly lifted my spirits. I waved my hand to sweep all the sand away.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dMy ability did not activate. No, my ability didn\u2019t work against the sand.\u201cMy ability doesn\u2019t work!\u201d\u201cMine either!\u201d\u201cDamn it, why! Why are our abilities\u2026!\u201dI once again tried using my ability to lift the woman, but it didn\u2019t work either. Panicked shouts from the guild members who tried to use their abilities like me to save the woman came from all over the place.\u201cUgh, uh\u2026 I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201dThe woman who was submerged up to her neck trembled with tears. Despite the efforts of those around her to get her out, the woman completely disappeared into the sand.A terribly heavy silence sank. The face of the missing woman looked familiar. She was the one who smiled and handed me a bowl of porridge yesterday.\u201cWe\u2014we have to get out of here right now\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2014aaaaargh!\u201dLooking back at the scream that pierced my ear, I saw another guild member whose calf was buried in the sand just like the woman before. I took a deep breath.\u201cN-no!\u201d\u201cDamn it, I can\u2019t move!\u201d\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t want this\u2026! I don\u2019t want this!\u201dThere were screams everywhere. Kim Ji-hoon, who was kneeling with an empty face, also began to sink slowly. Unknowingly, I grabbed onto the arms of Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin, who were standing next to me. My hands trembled beyond control.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll lift you up into the air\u2026\u201dI tried to be as calm as possible. I tried using my abilities right away.\u201c\u2026Yi-gyeol\u2014Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dI could hear Min Ah-rin\u2019s shaky voice.Ah.I couldn\u2019t.I shut my eyes tight and opened them. Slowly, I turned my head to look at Min Ah-rin.Min Ah-rin\u2019s body was gradually sinking downward.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMy hand was shaky, but I tried to ignore it and used my ability. But the wind only stayed in my hand and could not reach Min Ah-rin.Min Ah-rin, who was watching my actions blankly, bit her trembling lips and closed her eyes. Tears dripped down her cheeks.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Ah, so scary\u2026 I guess\u2026 this is probably how you go to the next level? How mean of CSY to not say anything.

    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI used my ability on Kim Woo-jin while I calmed my breathing. Unlike Min Ah-rin, whose legs were already buried in the sand, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body flew into the air.\u201cHey, Han Yi-gyeol! You\u2026!\u201d Kim Woo-jin shouted with a distorted face.I knew what he was going to say, but I didn\u2019t listen. I shook my head and walked over to Min Ah-rin.\u201cI-it\u2026 It\u2019s dangerous, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dWhen I got down on my knees and started digging in the sand, Min Ah-rin cried and pushed my shoulder. I didn\u2019t care and continued digging.\u201cI told you I would protect you,\u201d I said, as if I promised myself. I dug at the hot sand covering Min Ah-rin\u2019s body. Cold sweat dripped down my forehead.The screams of the guild members that had been disturbing me gradually disappeared. The sand itself was devouring people at random as if it had become a monster.\u201c\u2026Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dMin Ah-rin was eaten up at a rapid pace as if to laugh at my crazy efforts to clear the sand. My arms and palms were burning.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201dMin Ah-rin didn\u2019t cry anymore. Her face was so calm that her tears had stopped. On the contrary, I was choked with extreme nervousness.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0won\u2019t die here. I know it. I mean\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin was one of the important figures around Ha Tae-heon. You couldn\u2019t just die in a place like this.\u2026surely, you couldn\u2019t.Min Ah-rin, who heard my words, smiled faintly. I opened my mouth to say something more, but nothing came out. The terrible feeling that I had forgotten crept out and began to devour my reason.With her statue-pale face and her closed eyes, Min Ah-rin disappeared into the sand. I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw before my eyes\u2014empty, only sand. The surroundings were terrifyingly quiet.It was then that I realized that no one was around.\u201cKim Woo-jin\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin, who floated in the air to avoid the sand, was also nowhere to be seen. I staggered to my feet and cried out loudly, \u201cKim Woo-jin!\u201dWhere were you? You\u2019ve been following me around so much that I got tired of it, but why did you disappear without saying a word at such an important time?\u201cFuck!\u201dNegative emotions ran up my body from my toes, like the sand that swallowed people. I struggled to swallow my anger and tried to think rationally.I looked down on the SS-grade gate too much. If I had known this would happen, yesterday, I would have come up with some countermeasures instead of laughing and talking. A heavy sense of regret overcame me.\u300cYou alone ruined everything.\u300dI heard voices. I covered my eyes with trembling hands. The smell of disinfectant came from somewhere.\u300cYou shameless son of a bitch\u2026\u300dHwiiing, the wind scattered the voice away. Stop it. This was not the time. I tried to somehow hold onto my splitting brain.\u201cHah, hah\u2026\u201dThink. There must be a way to solve it. It couldn\u2019t end like this. The boss didn\u2019t appear yet, so why\u2026\u201c\u2026Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dTaking a deep breath, I turned around, frightened by the familiar voice. There stood the missing Cheon Sa-yeon. In the middle of the desert where everyone had disappeared, Cheon Sa-yeon and I stood face to face.\u201cHmm. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen this happen.\u201d\u201cCheon Sa-yeon\u2026\u201d I called out his name absentmindedly. My mind was complicated. Wasn\u2019t Cheon Sa-yeon swallowed by the sand?\u201cAre\u2014are you okay?\u201d I couldn\u2019t even speak formally.With trembling eyes, I scoured Cheon Sa-yeon from head to toe. Cheon Sa-yeon, holding a sword in one hand and looking at me, was the same as usual. Only then did I let my guard down and sigh.\u201cPeople have disappeared\u2026 Is it because of the boss monster?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t get swallowed up because you\u2019re an SS-rank, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThat\u2026I dryly swallowed my saliva. It was clearly stated in the novel that it was cleared without much damage. Was there still a possibility? If you took care of the boss monster, you could get people back.\u2018Maybe they\u2019re still alive.\u2019Just the thought that there might be an opportunity calmed my trembling body. I blinked slowly, organizing my thoughts.It was still too early to be reassured. There might be a time limit before saving those who were dragged into the sand. It was best to find and kill the boss monster as quickly as possible.\u201cCheon\u2026\u201dI raised my head to ask Cheon Sa-yeon about the boss monster and met his eyes before I knew it. I was so focused that I didn\u2019t even know he was coming. I instinctively retreated, but Cheon Sa-yeon caught me in an instant.\u201cHgh!\u201dMy vision flipped over and my body fell on the sand. Cheon Sa-yeon, who grabbed my neck, pressed down on my struggling arms and legs.\u201cDamn, what the hell are you doing all of a sudden\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strange. You\u2019re A-rank.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face looking down at me was expressionless. The pretentious smile disappeared and lifeless black eyes were revealed.\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t disappear, Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cI\u2014ugh, don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cAnd you know the existence of the boss monster.\u201dThe grip on my neck gradually grew stronger. I gathered my ability in order to escape.\u201cBe still.\u201d\u201cHah!\u201dI clenched my teeth from the pain\u2014it was like I was stabbed in the chest with an awl. My ability to move, from my heart to my hand, was forcibly blocked.I twisted my face and grabbed his wrist with both hands.\u201cYou\u2014son of a bitch\u2026\u201dIt was another power Cheon Sa-yeon had: he could block any ability user\u2019s energy with his right hand. I never imagined that he would use this cheat-like ability on me, an A-rank.\u201cIt was weird from the start, come to think of it.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked down at me and slowly blinked his eyes. He just looked bored with all of this.\u201cUp until now, nothing like this happened.\u201d\u201cHgh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that the woman intervened already?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was muttering unknown words, tapped my cheek with his long finger.\u201cWhat should I do, Yi-gyeol-ah? Should I kill you here or should I keep you alive?\u201dCrazy bastard. I gasped for breath and raised the corners of my lips with difficulty.\u201cFuck you, you son of a bitch\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dWith that remark, the strangling power became even stronger. My face heated up and my mouth opened on its own.\u201cHurgh\u2026 urgh\u2026\u201dMy back twisted reflexively and the pain rushed in like my chest was going to tear.I\u2019m really gonna die.My eyes were closed as a fear of unknown depth came over me. This was the moment.\u201cHah, cough!\u00a0Haaah, hah, urgh.\u201dThe pressure on my neck disappeared and a handful of air entered my open mouth. My neck was as hot like it had been burned. Tears streamed down as I coughed. Cheon Sa-yeon, who had removed his hand from my neck, grabbed my tear-soaked face.\u201cHow pretty.\u201d\u201cHah,\u00a0huff, fuck\u2026\u201dIn between the swears I spat out at him, my voice cracked a bit. Under Cheon Sa-yeon, I trembled beyond control with an instinctive fear.\u201cIn the end, it\u2019d be a bit of a waste to kill you.\u201dWith that infinitely light attitude, I gasped for breath and glared at Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t care how different you became.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll spare you if you follow my orders.\u201d\u201cCrazy bastard.\u201dThere was no need to think about it. You almost killed me and you want me to follow your orders? How laughable. I laughed at Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cThat\u2019s an expected reaction.\u201d\u201cLet go of me and get the hell away from me, motherfucker.\u201d\u201cThen how about this?\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s long eyes were softly curved. \u201cIf you leave me, I will kill Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this an enticing offer?\u201d\u201c\u2026Then that means\u2026\u201d I quickly grabbed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arm and asked, \u201cThey\u2019re both alive, aren\u2019t they? What about the others?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThey could die depending on how I act.\u201dMy anger grew at his nonchalant attitude. I shouted in a hoarse voice, \u201cThey\u2019re your guild members! They believed in you and followed you all the way here!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who heard my words, looked at me quietly without any reaction. It was only me who was annoyed by the uncomfortable silence.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon!\u201d\u201cReally\u2026 You\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI will save everyone as you say, so please cooperate with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026what if I refuse?\u201d\u201cEvery single one of them will die here. Even Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, whom you were together with.\u201dI asked with a dejected smile, \u201cDid you bring Kim Woo-jin for this from the beginning? Because he didn\u2019t keep an eye on me?\u201d\u201cPerhaps. I am a very thorough person after all,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon replied, stroking my neck, which had a large red handprint. I realized something.\u201cEven Min Ah-rin\u2026?\u201dMin Ah-rin, who came to see me because she was sent by Cheon Sa-yeon. I clearly remembered her smiling face as she said, \u201cI look forward to your cooperation.\u201d\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u201dFor a moment, I wanted to slap the young me from the past, who thought Cheon Sa-yeon wasn\u2019t that bad.I knew he was a mean guy who used everything around him to get what he wanted. What the hell did I expect?\u201cEven if I kill the others, I have to keep those two alive. They\u2019ll become a precious leash to tie you to me in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026why are you doing this all of a sudden? You already have my sister, so why\u2014\u201d\u201cSister?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smirked coldly.\u201cYou already know that your sister is dead.\u201dT/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: OOOH! Waaaaah, Cheon Sa-yeon, you bastard. He\u2019s the yandere of the bunch, I see\u2026Rin: Yup, remind of chapter 12 from certain manhwa wwwwww ( \ua20d\u1d17\ua20d)And that\u2019s why I said Sa-yeon is a regressor. He already done this (probably) more than one but I\u2019m not sure what his goal or how he could break that regression circle in the future. \u256e(. \u275b \u1d17 \u275b.)\u256dI guess Min Ah-rin this time would stay in Requiem Guild because there\u2019s Yi-gyeol here.I also want to say I\u2019m sorry if you found this chapters full of swears wwwww I don\u2019t want to censor it because that\u2019s mc true personality (since he lived in gangster group in the previous life). Ah, I still search someone for proofreading this series (I haven\u2019t tried to ask Ciao-san if she wants to pick this or not when I edited this post).

    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI forgot how to answer for a moment and just stared.\u201cWhy are you so surprised? Did you think I didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s stupid, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dWith those words, Cheon Sa-yeon let me go. I raised my upper body and rubbed my scratchy sore throat, asking, \u201c\u2026when did you notice?\u201dNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Until now, while dealing with Cheon Sa-yeon, I never talked about my sister\u2026\u201cIf you thought your sister was still alive, Han Yi-gyeol\u2014\u201d he threw the red jacket he was wearing at me \u201c\u2014you would\u2019ve asked for her in return.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t cry or beg to see her like you used to.\u201dThen I remembered the conversation I had with Cheon Sa-yeon before entering the gate. What did I say to Cheon Sa-yeon who asked what I wanted in return?\u300cPlease bring me two low-level items that can be obtained from inside that gate.\u300dTwo low-level items. Immediately after answering that, I\u2019d even realized that I made a mistake.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dAs Cheon Sa-yeon said, I was really stupid.The existence of a younger sister was the most important thing to escape from Cheon Sa-yeon. The more I seemed to believe that my sister was alive, the more Cheon Sa-yeon would mistake her as my leash.I ruined my plan myself. I should\u2019ve considered that Han Yi-gyeol was obsessed with his only blood relative left, his sister. It was something that those who never had a family wouldn\u2019t understand.It was a complete defeat. I sighed and lifted my staggering body.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon.\u201dIn terms of a card game, I was caught playing Joker, but it was still too early to give up. I had a lot of cards left.\u201cI admit, I lost.\u201d It was at this time I purposely gave him a smirk. \u201cBut I also have a temper, so I don\u2019t like being dragged around meekly, okay?\u201d\u201cHmm. I thought you\u2019d be harder to handle\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked at me with glittering eyes as if interested in my attitude.\u201cI will cooperate with you until the gate is cleared. I don\u2019t know why an SS-rank would need an A-rank\u2019s cooperation to deal with the boss monster.\u201dI thought a lot in a short moment. Should I just throw it all away and run away? Anyway, it was a brief relationship. I felt sorry for them, but they weren\u2019t important enough to me to suffocatingly live with no freedom.\u201cBut that\u2019s all. I have no intention of being swayed by you even when I get out of the gate.\u201dBut in the end, this was the path I took.\u201cMin Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin will be my new leash?\u201dI maintained my smile as I narrowed my eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Those people, including my sister, can never be my leash.\u201dIn the novel, Han Yi-gyeol was one of many supporting characters. A character that appeared less than 10 times; his age was never mentioned.\u201cIf my sister died and Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin also died, do you think I would stay with you?\u201dEver since I woke up in Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, I did not bother to find out what kind of life Han Yi-gyeol lived.Why his sister died, why he loved Cheon Sa-yeon enough to give his life to him, how lonely he must have been by himself\u2026 I was too scared to face the past that resembled me.\u201cDo your best and try, Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dBut now I wanted to know. I had to know everything about Han Yi-gyeol if I didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake.\u201cMy little sister was the only leash you had on me.\u201dAt those words, Cheon Sa-yeon, who was looking at me with his eyes slightly wide open, pulled up his lips and started to laugh.\u201cHaha, really\u2026\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon, who was bent at his waist from laughing, looked somewhat relieved. \u201cOkay. I know for sure that she didn\u2019t intervene.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon took the red jacket that I had thrown off, dusted the sand off, and put it on my shoulders.\u201cLet me say something too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI see your point*. Even still, I was looking forward to seeing you cry. It\u2019s quite a shame.\u201d\u201cYou act like you\u2019ve got me all figured out, how arrogant** (\uaf34\uc88b\ub124).\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Really\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who had been silent for a while without continuing his words, spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake only beginners make, allowing others to take advantage of them just because their weakness was found.\u201dWhat nonsense all he was talking about suddenly. I raised my eyebrows.\u201cYou are surprisingly well-versed in the business.\u201d\u201cAre you going to keep talking nonsense?\u201d I asked, roughly removing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s hand on my shoulder. What kind of business was Han Yi-gyeol involved in?Cheon Sa-yeon, who was smiling with an unknown expression, pointed back and said, \u201cThe boss monster is over there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the building with the gate\u2019s exit?\u201dBeyond the hazy sandstorm, I could see the building that was our original destination.\u201cI\u2019ll explain the rest as we go.\u201d* * *Lilith (\ub9b4\ub9ac\uc2a4). Cheon Sa-yeon called the boss monster Lilith.\u201cThe more human-like the monster, the higher the grade.\u201dAs the building got closer, the sandstorm became stronger. As I walked forward using the red jacket, which was probably hundreds of millions of dollars, as a shield, I asked, \u201cWhy Lilith?\u201d\u201cBecause \u2018it\u2019 is a woman.\u201dSo, what does the name \u2018Lilith\u2019 have to do with it?Cheon Sa-yeon continued to explain as he stared sullenly, \u201cBecause Lilith is the representative female demon that targets humans. It started out as a pun, but it\u2019s actually quite a match.\u201dDemon? I tilted my head, not understanding, as we arrived at the building that seemed far away.Through the sandstorm, we could only see the shape of it, so it was called a \u2018building\u2019, but when I arrived, it was more a castle than a building. Beyond the collapsed wall, there was a staircase leading down to the basement and old feathered spears everywhere.\u201cIs there another way down?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon lifted his sword and cut his hand without hesitation. Without treatment, new wounds appeared on his tattered palms.Tuduk, tuk.His palm, cut by the S-class sword, was dripping blood nonstop. Cheon Sa-yeon, who sprinkled blood on his sword, took the lead and walked without any change in expression.\u201cFollow me from behind.\u201dThe underground stairs without a single point of light were subtly lit by the fire burning on the sword. A long, seemingly endless staircase continued down.Unlike the ground floor, which was filled with dry sand, the basement was filled with damp and unpleasant air. The sound of dripping water could be heard, and the stairway I stepped on was getting more and more muddy. Cheon Sa-yeon and I just went down the stairs without saying a word for a while.It was dark everywhere, so I couldn\u2019t tell how far down I had come. Unlike me, who carefully walked down the stairs and looked around, Cheon Sa-yeon looked very familiar with this place itself.\u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, pointing at the rough wall. \u201cHow to clear this gate.\u201dIt had been a few minutes since I came underground. No, it had been hours\u2026 I didn\u2019t know. I wiped the cold sweat running down my chin.\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s profile, with shadow fluttering in the red light, gave off a somewhat dangerous atmosphere. Cheon Sa-yeon, whose face was half covered in darkness, said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you ? I haven\u2019t heard how you know the existence of the boss monster yet.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell the others? About the sand\u2026\u201dMy eyes shook slightly. I put my hand on my forehead and didn\u2019t stop talking.\u201cIf you told me, I could\u2019ve taken action sooner\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon answered in a calm tone as if he was taking a walk. \u201cIf I told them, they would\u2019ve been confused. They would\u2019ve been scared. After that, they would have divided, fought, and acted individually. And then they\u2019d be eaten by the sand.\u201d\u201cThat\u2014it\u2019s of course because they didn\u2019t know it was a ranked gate\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if I announced in advance that it was an SS-grade gate and recruited applicants, nothing would change. Monsters would still appear where they appeared and things would go the same way. It would only add to the unnecessary fuss.\u201dI heard a harsh breath from somewhere. I turned my head around, but all I could see was darkness. Who was breathing? I put more strength to my trembling legs.\u201cHaah, hah, how are you\u2026 so sure\u2026\u201dMy trembling legs stepped on the stairs incorrectly and I stumbled heavily. I closed my eyes as my body collapsed helplessly without being able to hold out.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how I\u2019m so sure, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dInstead of the pain of rolling down the stairs, what came to me was the cool scent I had smelled before. Cheon Sa-yeon hugged my limp body like I was a child.\u201cBecause I\u2019ve already done it. A lot. Then you\u2019d see the things you\u2019ve said are meaningless\u201d\u201cUgh, what\u2026\u201d\u201cFor example, because this basement is under the influence of the boss monster, A-ranks can\u2019t stand it.\u201dI muttered curses even through my hazy consciousness. What is with this bastard?\u201cIf I let you know in advance, your mind would break down faster.\u201d\u201cHah\u2026 Then I\u2019d rather\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more dangerous out there. From the moment we entered the basement, monsters have been flocking towards this place. To protect the boss.\u201dThen what were you going to do? I managed to open my eyes and stared at Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cI can\u2019t leave you, so I have to take you with me. What do you think I should do?\u201d\u201cFucking\u2026 Shut up and quickly\u2026\u201dIt was very annoying that he knew what to do and was deliberately messing around. I was having a hard time, but this guy\u2026\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon clasped my sweat-soaked left hand and held it tightly. \u201cEven if it hurts, bear with it. It\u2019s my first time doing it, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do it right.\u201d\u201cWhat? Wait\u2026\u201dWith a tingling sensation in the palm of my hand, something slowly began to creep in. I twisted my body instinctively to escape from the dark, heavy, and cold energy that I couldn\u2019t compare to anything.\u201cHeuh, ah\u2026!\u201dFrom the palm of my hand to my heart, Cheon Sa-yeon energy engulfed me like fire. Chills ran up my spine as I shook uncontrollably.\u201cN-no\u2026 stop!\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201d\u201cUh, ugh!\u00a0Huurgh\u2026!\u201dI plunged into Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms and closed my eyes tightly. It\u2019s hot. Stop. It\u2019s weird. I felt like I was about to lose my mind at any moment at the strange sensation.\u201cJust a little more.\u201dWhether it was true that it was the first time he tried it, Cheon Sa-yeon also frowned and focused on pushing his energy. Energy poured out once more with the palm of his hand. My back twisted again.My energy, which had gathered in my heart and was wary of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s energy, was gradually pushed back by the momentum. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s muddy, strong energy enveloped my energy and heart like a shield.\u201cSS-ranks are said to be able to share their energy\u2026 It\u2019s really working.\u201d\u201cHaah, huh, ugh\u2026\u201dThe pain subsided as the sharp energy subsided. I let out a rough breath and got out of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms.\u201cFuck\u2026 Don\u2019t ever do that again.\u201dMy body, which had been limp as if I was drunk, became normal and my mind was refreshed, but it was an experience I never wanted to go through again.When I bared my teeth warily, Cheon Sa-yeon said in a light voice, \u201cBut it\u2019s not that bad, is it?\u201dCome to think of it\u2026 I checked my heart. The amount of energy and strength had improved tremendously. Was this like temporarily being S-rank? I was conflicted for a while, but my mind did not change.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a second time.\u201dAt my answer, Cheon Sa-yeon looked disappointed. I didn\u2019t know why he was disappointed. As I put on the dropped jacket again, I said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Lead the way.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon replied with a teasing tone, \u201cAs you wish.\u201dT/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Hm\u2026.

    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter going down the long flight of stairs, I saw the end. I looked carefully around at the large hall that spread out in front of me.A large, dusty chandelier hung from the ceiling and in the centre was a statue of a young angel with its face half broken. Burning candles embedded in the wall and broken pillars could be seen.Overall, it looked similar to the interior of a castle in the Renaissance period. It was brighter than the stairs thanks to the candles that lit the darkness, but the gloomy atmosphere was still there.Were those who disappeared into the sand still here? It was at that moment when I was looking around and wanting to ask Cheon Sa-yeon.\u300eHuhuhu\u2026\u300fA brief pain passed through my mind. Wrapping my hand around the side of my head, I said, \u201cLaughter\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mental attack. Don\u2019t listen to it.\u201d\u300eA fun child came along.\u300fThe voice was clear, as it was whispering right next to me.\u00a0Thud, thud. The sound of heels echoed throughout the hall.\u300eNow, shall I take a look at you?\u300f\u201cHah\u2026!\u201dI felt a cold hand on the back of my neck. I hurriedly looked back, but all I could see was an empty space where darkness fell. Dryly swallowing down my saliva and turning my head again, I opened my eyes wide.\u201c\u2026Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was next to me, was nowhere to be seen. I was the only one standing in the centre of the hall. The shadow of the angel statue whose face had been broken in half shook bizarrely.I tried to stay calm, but my heart started beating unsteadily. With no regard to my will, it was like someone was forcing fear into me.\u2018I have to get out of here.\u2019Perhaps the main ability of the boss monster was hallucinations. I was standing there thanks to Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s energy and becoming a temporary S-rank. If I was at my normal rank, I would have lost my mind by now.I took a deep breath and shook my head to break free from the hallucinations when I heard the voice again.\u300eI saw it, child, the pain you have.\u300fIt was a sweet and soft voice, like she was professing her love to her lover. I closed and opened my trembling eyes.\u201cHyungnim.\u201d\u201cHah\u2026\u201dSomeone approached me through the thick white mist. After checking the other person\u2019s face, I let out a despondent sigh.\u201cCome on. I came all the way here and that\u2019s your reaction?\u201dThe sloppy blond hair caught my attention. That was really too unfair. The grumbling guy raised one corner of his mouth and smiled wryly. \u201cAnyway, you should know it was difficult. Well, since it\u2019s a part of\u00a0Hyungnim\u2019s\u00a0charm, then it\u2019s charming\u2026\u201dThe way he glanced at me and kept making useless noises one after another seemed surprisingly real. I looked at him without answering. The clear, white cheeks that still had a youthful feeling, the piercings between the blonde hairs, and the faded jean jacket.\u201cIt feels like my face will get pierced by your gaze. What are you looking at me like that for?\u201dWith reddish ears, the guy avoided my gaze and looked down. He talked with a shy smile as if he had no idea what to do as he fiddled with his bangs.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, come over here. I brought someone who wanted to see you.\u201dI could tell who you were talking about without even listening. I twisted my lips. Was this all the pain I had?\u201cCome on. I had a hard time bringing you here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe stretched out his white hand.\u201cYou missed me a lot, didn\u2019t you?\u201dYeah. I missed you a lot. Back then and now.\u201cAren\u2019t you coming?You\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. Come on, grab my hand quickly.\u201dEven if that hand was real and not an illusion, I couldn\u2019t hold it. Perhaps it thought I was in conflict, the illusion began to urge me.\u201cCome on, come on. Hold my hand. Let\u2019s go together. This place is boring. I know everything. You want to go back, don\u2019t you? If you hold my hand, I\u2019ll give you everything.\u201dHis hands shook like flowers flying in the wind.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s give up and go. Why are you trying so hard to survive? Why alone? Why? Why?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was getting harder and harder to breathe. I wanted to get out of this terrible fantasy right away, but I also wanted to give up and follow him. I quietly lowered my gaze and bit my lips. The white hand, which was too white, was getting closer and closer.\u300eKkyaaaaak!\u300f\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dJust before the illusion caught me, a strong force pulled my arm as I heard the desperate scream. The fog that had obscured my vision disappeared and the person standing in front of me was clearly visible.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face was covered in bright red blood. Over his shoulder, I saw a woman groaning as she grabbed her head.\u300eHow dare you, you insignificant human\u2026!\u00a0Kyaaak!\u300fthe woman whose face was covered in blood, with one of the two horns sprouting from her forehead, exclaimed in an angry voice. Wearing a beautiful and colourful dress, she held a sword in one hand. Was that woman the boss monster, Lilith?\u201cNow that I\u2019ve cut off her horn, she can\u2019t use such strong hallucinations.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dApparently, he had a close battle with Lilith while I was hallucinating.While wiping my sweat-drenched bangs, I asked, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d\u201cOf course there is only one thing. Put your arms around my shoulders,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said as he leaned his upper body toward me.I expected this, but\u2026 it was a little uncomfortable to do it.\u201cCan\u2019t you hold me normally.\u201d\u201cI think the answer to that question was answered last time.\u201dDamn it\u2026However, I must say that I was glad that there were no eyes to see us this time. As I put my arms around his shoulders with an awkward gesture, Cheon Sa-yeon hugged me as if it was natural.\u201cShe\u2019s still an SS-grade boss. Can you fight while holding me?\u201d\u201cWell enough.\u201dI don\u2019t know. You do whatever. I sighed and slowly lifted up my energy. Being a temporary S-rank, there was plenty of energy to be used for my ability. After seeing the wind surrounding his body, Cheon Sa-yeon swung the sword at Lilith.Chaeeng!The flame spread wildly. Lilith blocked the S-class sword covered in blood with a light movement. Seeing her up close, Lilith had cat-like yellow eyes, sharp fangs, and large bat wings.\u300ePerhaps I\u2019ll make you beg for death, intruders!\u300fLilith quickly swung her sword.\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0The blade of the sword dug deep through the ground, shattering it. Seeing that, I was sure. The sword that Lilith was wielding was an SS-class item.\u300eYou little rats!\u300fCrack, boom!The angel statue broke and fell to the floor. White debris was scattered all over the place.\u00a0Ahahaha!\u00a0Lilith spread her wings and crossed the air.\u300eWhere are you running, you rats! When I catch you, I\u2019ll pluck off both legs! I\u2019ll cut off your head and put it in a big glass jar!\u300fCheon Sa-yeon, dodging Lilith\u2019s sword, turned his wrist to change the sword\u2019s trajectory. I changed the direction of the wind according to the flow.Chaeeng!The sword that aimed at Lilith\u2019s neck was barely blocked. Lilith snapped like a broken doll, tilted her head to one side and ripped her mouth into a long grin.\u300eA little rat carried by another little rat, two little rats, haha! Hahahahaha!\u300fThe sound of laughter made my head ache again. Cheon Sa-yeon, promptly aware of my condition, slashed Lilith\u2019s sword strongly. Smoothing my sore eyes, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep up. It\u2019s too fast.\u201dThe S-grade monsters we faced last time could not compare to what we were fighting now. It was even an air battle. The situation was not good.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at your opponent.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s eyes shone sharply under his black hair fluttering in the wind.\u201cFocus on me like you did back then.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe conversation did not last long. Lilith, who was smiling with a broken face, and the expressionless Cheon Sa-yeon collided again. Flames fluttered in the wind and shone across the face of the man who embraced me.There was only one thing I could do in this situation. To believe and follow Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words. I turned my gaze away from Lilith and focused on each and every movement of Cheon Sa-yeon.\u2018Ah.\u2019My eyes pointed slightly downwards. His shoulders were pulled back and his lower body strengthened.\u2018Is this what you mean?\u2019I quickly increased the strength of the wind below and changed the wind around Cheon Sa-yeon and the sword. The wind that wrapped around his legs made Cheon Sa-yeon more stable while also helping the tip of the sword move faster toward its target.\u300eKyaaaaak!\u300fLike a snake swallowing its prey, the sword mercilessly lodged in Lilith\u2019s left shoulder. In that brief moment, Cheon Sa-yeon twisted the blade once and dug into her flesh. Lilith opened her mouth and let out a long screeching sound.\u300eHaaak! Kyaaak!\u300fThe fire on her shoulder began to gnaw at Lilith\u2019s body. Since it was an SS-grade body, it didn\u2019t burn as fast as other monsters, but it was enough to cause constant damage.\u300eI\u2019m gonna kill you! I\u2019m gonna kill you!\u300fLilith, in a fit of anger, stomped her feet. Then, something started pouring down from above as the ceiling shookKyaaak! Kyaak!Kyaaaa!There were dozens of monsters. Various types of monsters, from spiders full of eyes to zombies with rotten flesh, were crawling towards us at an incredible speed.\u201cHold on tight,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon whispered. I held the jacket with one hand and Cheon Sa-yeon with the other hand.Kkyaaaaa!Cheon Sa-yeon thrust the sword into the monster\u2019s face as its black mouth was gaping wide open. Instead of pulling it out, he straightened his arm straight across and the monster\u2019s head approaching us was split in half. Muddy blood gushed out and sprinkled over me and Cheon Sa-yeon. Cheon Sa-yeon carefully swung his sword towards the monsters that rushed at us from all directions.Five, ten, seventeen. Every time the sword dug in, the monsters died, but the numbers were too many. I poured out my powers to make the fire burn bigger. Hot flames came out and surrounded Cheon Sa-yeon as if to protect us, but the monsters did not hesitate and rushed in.\u201cUgh, we have to find Lilith!\u201dThese were monsters that had lost their sanity in order to protect the boss. Unless you killed Lilith, the monsters would constantly flock to you.In a slightly rough voice, Cheon Sa-yeon said, \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock, right there.\u201d\u201cGurgh!\u00a0She\u2019s not there!\u201dA monster hiding in the chandelier attacked me. With his powers, he killed the monster and answered quickly, \u201c5 o\u2019clock.\u201dGurrrrgh\u2026 Maggot-infested hands reached out, but Cheon Sa-yeon cut off the monster\u2019s head.\u201cNot there!\u201d\u201cSeven o\u2019clock, behind the third pillar.\u201dThere were so many monsters that it was difficult to identify them. Cheon Sa-yeon swung his arms wide. The monsters surrounding the area were cut all at once. The sound of the skin tearing and screaming filled the air. A third pillar was revealed through the flames flying in the air.\u201cThere\u2026!\u201dFor a brief moment, the tip of a bat wing was clearly visible. Cheon Sa-yeon mercilessly cut off the several monsters that grabbed at him and jumped forward.\u300eKyaaaaak!\u300fKyaa! Kyaaaak!Kugugugung, Kugugugung!Lilith, who made eye contact with us, cried out once more and the monsters chased behind. As the number had increased, the ground shook and stones fell from the ceiling. Cheon Sa-yeon, who found the bewildered Lilith beyond the hazy dust, gave a bitter smile.\u201cFound it.\u201dT/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: oho, CSY holds our MC again in his arms\u2026.

Lilith, who managed to block the attack, hurriedly pulled back and shouted.\u300eWa-wait!\u300fLilith\u2019s left arm had been burned and badly distorted. She was constantly burning. I was reminded of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s power once again.\u300eIf you kill me, you won\u2019t be able to save the other humans!\u300f Lilith shouted, terrified, as her fangs were exposed. I frowned.\u2018Is that how it works?\u2019What should I do? If they had hostages, it was best to negotiate with the other party, but I wasn\u2019t sure if this would work against monsters as well.\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cWa-wait!\u201dAs I was contemplating what to do, Cheon Sa-yeon answered firmly while cutting down the monster that rushed in.Startled, I grabbed him by the neck and whispered, \u201cAre you crazy? What are you\u2014\u201d\u201cHmm. What is this posture? You want me to kiss you?\u201dThis fucking\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If she\u2019s so confident, there must be a device or a trap that you can\u2019t easily identify. Don\u2019t rush to kill her.\u201dWhen Cheon Sa-yeon and I stopped, Lilith raised her eyebrows and exclaimed triumphantly, \u300eHm, wouldn\u2019t you regret it? No one where they are but me! If I die, you guys will\u2026\u300fLilith\u2019s words didn\u2019t last. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was listening to Lilith with a grim expression, swung his sword before I could stop him, and Lilith\u2019s head fell to the floor. He leaned backwards as blood flowed from the fallen body and soaked the floor.\u201cYou stupid bastard!\u201dKyaaaak!Kkyaaah! Kyaaak!When Lilith died, the monsters that rushed as if they were out of their minds started to scream and run away. The monsters that had filled the hall disappeared in an instant, and all that remained were the astonished me, the relaxed Cheon Sa-yeon, and Lilith\u2019s corpse. Cheon Sa-yeon released me from his arms and put the sword he was holding into its sheath.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dPicking up Lilith\u2019s SS-class sword that had fallen to the floor, Cheon Sa-yeon swung the sword with a light hand movement and cut off Lilith\u2019s right arm.\u201cAll I need is her right arm.\u201dLilith\u2019s body, whose right arm was cut off, was devoured in the fire as if it was waiting. Cheon Sa-yeon, who grabbed her right arm, walked away, leaving the burning body behind.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon, explain it properly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s faster to see it for yourself.\u201dI jumped over the large pieces of stone scattered all over the floor and followed Cheon Sa-yeon. Underneath the large chandelier, Cheon Sa-yeon pressed down on something in the flat wall.Kugugugung!A strange pattern was then engraved on the flat wall, revealing a round hole in the centre. Cheon Sa-yeon shoved Lilith\u2019s right arm into the hole without hesitation.Kwareureureung, kugung!The ground shook so much that it was hard to stay balanced. As I turned my gaze to the direction of the sound, the floor in the centre of the hall split in half, and the entrance to the basement slowly appeared.\u201cLet\u2019s go down,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said, wiping Lilith\u2019s blood off on his sword.Faced with that natural attitude, I dryly swallowed down my saliva and hesitatingly said, \u201c\u2026Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dI thought it was unlikely, but you really\u2026\u201cYou already knew how to clear the dungeon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut is that all?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was walking to the basement entrance, looked back at me. He said with a soft smile, \u201cYou and I are the same, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt means that we\u2019re both hiding our hidden cards from prying eyes.\u201dHidden card. I tried not to react to that word, putting on a calm expression.\u201cAren\u2019t you being unfair? I told you one.\u201d\u201cStrictly speaking, I discovered it; you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201dHow petty. Cheon Sa-yeon gave me an interested look and said, \u201cBut this isn\u2019t bad. It seems like a lot of fun, doesn\u2019t it? Predicting, discovering, and using each other\u2019s hidden cards.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dIn fact, I was interested, but I shook my head in denial, thinking that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see a good one if I dared to play.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I wanted you to try.\u201dContrary to his words, Cheon Sa-yeon turned around with a face that did not show any regret.\u201cWe can talk about the rest another time. We have to go down in order to protect our great A-class\u2019s leashes.\u201dI let out a breath full of complicated feelings as I looked at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back, who walked down the dark stairs without hesitation.* * *The basement we arrived at was larger than I expected, and it wasn\u2019t dark because of the white lights embedded in the ceiling.I found people lying among the piles of sand and rushed to them.\u201cKim Woo-jin!\u201dI looked at Kim Woo-jin, the closest one. Kim Woo-jin, who exhaled evenly with his eyes closed, was only asleep, but fortunately, there was nothing wrong.\u201cWake them quickly, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cHhhhgh!\u201dAs Cheon Sa-yeon talked to me, he roughly kicked Park Geon-ho\u2019s side, who was lying on the sand. Park Geon-ho, who was suddenly attacked by his boss, jumped up.\u201cSince Lilith is dead, the castle will soon fall.\u201d\u201cWhat? So what do we do?\u201d\u201cWe go out.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon pointed to the right corner with his chin. When I found the gate with a dark blue light, I said with wide eyes, \u201cNo way, the exit gate?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe exit gate was underground. What would have happened if he killed Lilith without knowing the existence of the basement?\u201cKim Woo-jin. Wake up, dude!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 what.\u201dWhen I shook his shoulder strongly, Kim Woo-jin opened his groggy eyes. I was working my ass off this entire time, but this kid was sleeping like a log. I had hoped he would be safe, but when I saw him, my temper soared.\u201cHa-Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re awake, wake the others up quickly. We have to get out.\u201d\u201cWhat? Wait a minute. Where are we?\u201dI ignored Kim Woo-jin, who was saying stupid things, and tapped Min Ah-rin on the shoulder. Although she was woken up much more carefully than Kim Woo-jin, Min Ah-rin came to her senses quickly.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe, Yi-gyeol-ssi!\u201d Min Ah-rin said, who recognized me as soon as her eyes opened, and grabbed my hand.\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to say. I was very worried.\u201d\u201cAre the others okay?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll explain later. The building is collapsing\u2026 We have to wake the others and leave the gate.\u201d\u201cMmh, I got it.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was very sensible, didn\u2019t panic and began to wake up the people lying next to her. One by one, they woke up and looked at their bodies with confused faces.\u201cIs there anyone missing?\u201d\u201cNo. I checked three times.\u201d\u201cI woke up from a good night\u2019s sleep and this still feels like a dream\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? A SS-grade boss appeared?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s about grade SS since it can move this many people.\u201d\u201cPhew. I\u2019m going to avoid desert gates for a while.\u201dSeeing the guild members gathering and chatting, it seemed like there was no need to worry too much.\u00a0Kugugung, the basement shook as the building collapsed in earnest. The terrified guild members rushed into the gate. Leaving behind the dusty basement, the team left the gate without missing a single person.It was the world\u2019s first SS-grade gate clear.* * *[The new gate in the N19 area turns out to be an SS-grade gate and the whole world is paying attention to the Requiem Guild that has successfully cleared the gate without suffering any damage. In an interview shortly after clearing, the Requiem Guild Master informed that all guild members who participated in the gate-clearing were safe and that they had obtained SS-class items\u2026]\u201cHow good is an SS-class sword?\u201d Kim Woo-jin asked with a carefree voice as he picked up a snack.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s worth the call? A-class is at least a few billions\u2026\u201d Min Ah-rin, who was watching the news, replied.\u201cMaster is lucky, too. He already owns a lot of items, but he got a new SS-class.\u201d\u201cEven if I use that money to live the rest of my life in luxury, I wouldn\u2019t be able to spend it all. I envy him.\u201dThat was true. A fire-resistance A-class jacket, an S-class sword that hindered regeneration, and an SS-class sword with unknown abilities.Because it was Cheon Sa-yeon, he could handle it. They were huge items that no one else could use properly.[Master Cheon Sa-yeon currently possesses two swords, S-class and SS-class sword. Even though the netizens say that there are only two SS-ranks in Korea, the opinion that the number of items they own is too many\u2026]\u201cOh my.\u201dA photo of Cheon Sa-yeon giving an interview with a smile on the news came out in a huge size.\u00a0Aigo, he\u2019s so handsome.\u201cHow cool. Master certainly looks different. It\u2019s just that he has a weird personality.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d I nodded my head.He had a hell of a personality, but he had a great face.\u201cWhat? You agree?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was lying on the sofa and eating snacks, suddenly sat up and stared at me. What was it now?\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t it true?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAs Min Ah-rin and I stared at each other, Kim Woojin slightly avoided eye contact.\u201cN-no. It\u2019s not\u2014I mean, do you like that kind of look? It\u2019s rather burdensome\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you talking to Min Ah-rin-ssi? It\u2019s not polite to ask that.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, I\u2019m talking to you! You!\u201dOf course I thought he was asking Min Ah-rin. I immediately had a weird look on my face.\u201cI prefer pretty people more than handsome people.\u201d\u201cP-pretty people? Pretty people\u2026\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, do you have an ideal type?\u201d Min Ah-rin asked, curious.Ideal type? I had never thought about it, so I tilted my head and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. If I have to say, a pure beauty?\u201d\u201cA pure beauty, you say? Like white tees and jeans would look good on them.\u201d\u201cPure\u2026 White tee and jeans\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin smiled broadly at my words and Kim Woojin muttered with a serious expression.\u201cWell, yes,\u201d I answered half-heartedly.\u2018\u2026but what is this situation anyway?\u2019It was so natural I forgot to ask. I turned to Kim Woo-jin and said, \u201cBut what are you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026keeping an eye on you.\u201dKim Woo-jin coughed and sat down on the sofa again. I also asked Min Ah-rin, \u201cIsn\u2019t Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0busy?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I\u2019m on vacation.\u201dNo, I mean, why did you come to my room during your precious vacation\u2026[Next news. Victims of the monster attack in District C12 three months ago are holding their 15th protest today. The Blun (\ube14\ub7f0) Guild Master has yet to say what position he\u2019s going to take on this\u2026]Beep.I turned off the news and asked Min Ah-rin with a serious face, \u201cDid the Master give you any instructions? Like, to make sure I don\u2019t leave my room.\u201dAfter I left the gate, I had nowhere to go, so I followed Cheon Sa-yeon to the Requiem Guild.Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin came to me after I returned to the room on the 23rd floor, where I had been locked up for a week, and lay around without doing anything. The sudden visit inevitably raised doubts. I wonder if Cheon Sa-yeon sent them after me to make sure I didn\u2019t run away.\u201cWhy? Do you like confinement?\u201d\u201cCould that be\u2026?\u201dEvery time this happened, I realized that Min Ah-rin was not a normal person either. That was weird. I didn\u2019t think it was like this in the novel.\u201cI\u2019m just here to play. I think Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0would have a better idea about that?\u201d\u201cWhat? Nope. I don\u2019t know either!\u201dI sighed as I saw Kim Woo-jin shaking his head in surprise.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you know? You said you were here to keep an eye on me. Didn\u2019t you get any instructions?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 didn\u2019t get any\u2026\u201d Kim Woo-jin answered while fiddling with his fingers.Rather, just proudly say that you\u2019re here to play hooky. As I was contemplating how to get these two out, I heard a knock on the door.\u201cWho is it?\u201dThere was no one else who should have come. I looked at Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin just in case, but they both looked puzzled just like me.I walked over and pulled the doorknob. As soon as the door opened, I frowned upon the owner of the knock.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dPark Geon-ho, the team leader of the Special Operations Division. He looked down at me and gave me a sly smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shall we go eat together?\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dDespite how I didn\u2019t hide my discomfort at his presence, Park Geon-ho remained steadfast in the face of my question.I had felt this since last time, but Park Geon-ho had the look of an expensive bed*\u2014that is, unshakeable shamelessness.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, who is that?\u201dI didn\u2019t know if they heard the conversation, but Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin showed their faces. Min Ah-rin saw Park Geon-ho standing in front of the door and her eyes widened.\u201cOh\u2014Team Leader Park Geon-ho\u2026 oh my!\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was greeting him warmly, immediately became startled and covered her mouth with her hand. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face, standing behind her, also became weird at the same time. Why were you guys like that?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, Yi-gyeol-ssi,\u201d Min Ah-rin said in an excited voice, rushing up to me and grabbing my arm.\u201cTeam Leader Park Geon-ho\u2019s outfit!\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dWhy are you suddenly talking about his outfit\u2026I reflexively glanced at Park Geon-ho\u2019s clothes. Park Geon-ho also bowed his head with a puzzled look and checked his clothes.\u2018Oh, jeez.\u2019I covered my forehead and lamented. No, why this all of a sudden?\u201cThat\u2019s it: white tee and jeans! Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s ideal type!\u201d\u201cIdeal type?\u201d Park Geon-ho, who was still listening, asked.\u201cIt definitely seems pure. I think I know what Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s taste\u2026\u201d\u201cStop! Stop, Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201dI hurriedly blocked Min Ah-rin\u2019s words. However, Park Geon-ho smiled with an odd look on his face as if he had already figured out the situation.\u201cI guess a pure person in a white t-shirt and jeans is your cup of tea? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d like that but\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not that.\u201dI gritted my teeth and answered firmly, but Park Geon-ho patted me on the shoulder without even pretending to hear it.\u201cWell, I understand. I do look pretty good in a white t-shirt and jeans.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep talking nonsense like that, please leave.\u201d\u201cRight. Tell him to get lost.\u201d Kim Woo-jin growled. Apparently, he didn\u2019t like Park Geon-ho.\u201cDon\u2019t be too thorny. How about we get to know each other as we eat?\u201dPark Geon-ho ignored Kim Woo-jin\u2019s words and looked at me. Knowing what he wanted from me, I shook my head.\u201cI will decline any offer to join the Special Operations Division.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you hear me out? I\u2019m the team leader, but objectively, my division\u2019s benefits are quite worth the work we do.\u201dI looked at him with distrustful eyes. Objective? If it was worth the work, other guild members should have thought the same.\u201cRumors say otherwise.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re false rumours.\u201d\u201cYou know what I heard and they\u2019re all false rumours?\u201d\u201cWhatever you heard,\u201d Park Geon-ho answered confidently and looked down at me with his arms crossed. Reading the persistence in those eyes, I sighed. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to shake him off.\u201cI don\u2019t intend to belong anywhere. Right now, I\u2019m just helping Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI seriously refuse. There are plenty of A-rank talented people like me, so look for someone else.\u201dWhen I spoke calmly, Park Geon-ho made a complicated expression. Park Geon-ho, who was thinking about something while touching his lips, smiled bitterly.\u201cThis makes it hard to push recklessly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Park Geon-ho frowned and continued with a voice full of regret. \u201cHan Yi-gyeol. As you said, there are many A-rank ability users. But there are very few people who can judge situations and use their abilities as efficiently as you do. I\u2019m not suggesting you because you\u2019re an A-rank, but I\u2019m making a suggestion based on your skills.\u201d\u201c\u2026still, my answer is the same.\u201d\u201cAh, too bad.\u201d He shrugged lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone for now. I\u2019m sorry to interrupt your rest.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dAre you really going? Just like that?It was rather me who was embarrassed to see him backing away more calmly than expected. Park Geon-ho turned his back on me neatly and left.\u201cThat\u2019s surprising. Team Leader Park Geon-ho is so well-known for his persistence that everyone in the guild knows it,\u201d Min Ah-rin said, having the same thoughts as me.I closed the door and asked Min Ah-rin, \u201cDoes he recruit people a lot?\u201d\u201cNot a lot, but when someone he likes appears, he chases after them and persuades them to join the team.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with that? So trashy,\u201d Kim Woo-jin grumbled next to me as he listened. Wasn\u2019t \u201ctrashy\u201d a little too much?\u201cBut most of them accept his offer. Needless to say, the Special Operations Division has better welfare and higher salary than other divisions. There is also a separate risk allowance because they only go to dangerous gates\u2026 The schedule is not very tight, so they\u2019re usually free except when they enter the gate.\u201d\u201cDefinitely\u2026 not bad.\u201d\u201cNot bad, my ass. It\u2019s completely absurd.\u201d Kim Woo-jin kept interrupting me. What was he so dissatisfied with?\u201cWell, anyway\u2026 I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t come to see me anymore because I\u2019ve refused.\u201d\u201cYeah. Stop paying attention to that bastard and eat some snacks.\u201d As if Kim Woo-jin was waiting, he handed a bag of snacks to me.\u201cHow about eating something other than snacks? There\u2019s a new famous pizza place nearby. Let\u2019s order pizza!\u201d\u201cPizza all of a sudden? No, wait\u2014how long will you guys be here\u2026\u201d\u201cGood, pizza. Let\u2019s order right now.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who hadn\u2019t even been pretending to listen to Min Ah-rin until now, actively joined the opinion of ordering pizza. Min Ah-rin, who felt better, smiled broadly when Kim Woo-jin, who was difficult to get close to because of his timid and vigilant nature, responded back.\u201cRight? It\u2019s pizza at times like this! Woo-jin-ssi, do you have a favourite type of pizza?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine with anything\u2026 Hey, Han Yi-gyeol. What do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019ll go for something on the spicy side\u2026\u201d\u201cThen how about this? Hot Chicken.\u201d\u201cGasp. Let\u2019s put shrimp in it, too. Does anyone have a shrimp allergy? Then let\u2019s go with this.\u201d\u201cOkaaay\u2026\u201dBeing swept away by pizza like that, I failed to kick out Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin.The two of them, after finishing a whole pizza, begged to watch a movie which ended at midnight. In the end, I had to give them a place to sleep.* * *Since there was only one bed, Kim Woo-jin and I gave up the bed to Min Ah-rin and slept on the sofa together. No matter how big and nice the sofa was, it was very cramped for two adult men to sleep, but Kim Woo-jin unexpectedly lay down quietly without making a sound. I was going to kick him out if he complained. Like a ghost, he had keen instincts**.The next morning after spending the day like that.Bang bang!\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI woke up half-asleep at the noise coming from somewhere.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs soon as I opened my eyes, what I saw was Kim Woo-jin\u2019s white neck above his t-shirt. I wondered why it was so hot and stuffy\u2014this kid was sleeping while hugging me like a bamboo wife***. I, who had a stiff upper body, swept back my frizzy hair and kicked Kim Woo-jin\u2019s stomach.\u201cUgh!\u201dKim Woo-jin yelped and fell down the sofa. That was the price for treating me like a pillow.Bang bang!\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201dThe source of the noise was knocking on the door. Who was here so early in the morning? I walked towards the door while complaining and opened the door roughly with annoyance.\u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPark Geon-ho smiled at me brightly. Yesterday\u2019s situation overlapped with the present and my expression became bitter.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re awake now.\u201d\u201c\u2026hello, Team Leader Park Geon-ho.\u201d\u201cOh, wait, wait.\u201d Park Geon-ho blocked my mouth as I was about to say something. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here to offer you a place on the team today.\u201dWhen I stared suspiciously, Park Geon-ho raised the corner of his mouth and held out a box. \u201cHere.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t had breakfast yet, have you? Let\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dI tried to close the door quickly, but Park Geon-ho was faster. Park Geon-ho, who put his foot through the gap in the door, forced the door open.\u201cHey, that\u2019s\u2026 Do you use your S-rank power for something like this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cYou put your feet there and pretend you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to have breakfast with you, but you\u2019re treating me like this. That\u2019s unfair.\u201d\u201cDo people who feel wronged die?\u201d (TN: as in, \u201cbig whoop, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re dead.\u201d)After struggling for a while, I finally gave up. There was no way an A-rank could defeat an S-rank by force. It would be my loss to waste my energy like this.\u201cOkay, wait here. There are guests who came first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI brought my exhausted body back into the room. Kim Woo-jin, who woke up with me, looked very unhappy like he noticed that Park Geon-ho had come, and Min Ah-rin, who had just come out of the bedroom, seemed to be unaware of the situation yet.\u201cI\u2019m fine with it. Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0is the owner of this place. I\u2019ll wash up first.\u201dWhen I said that Park Geon-ho had come, Min Ah-rin said he was free to come in, and she headed to the bathroom. I, who hoped Min Ah-rin would refuse, stretched my shoulders and gestured to Park Geon-ho to come in.* * *\u201cI didn\u2019t know what Han Yi-gyeol likes, so I bought several. This is great.\u201d\u201cWow. Isn\u2019t this a very expensive Korean restaurant lunch box?\u201dAfter Min Ah-rin, Kim Woo-jin, and I washed up, Park Geon-ho took out lunch boxes one after another as if he was waiting. Min Ah-rin, who saw the logo embedded on the lid of the lunch box, exclaimed with joy.\u201cI really wanted to try eating at this place, but it was fully booked, so I couldn\u2019t even afford to. How did you get it?\u201d\u201cI know the person in charge.\u201dI picked up a lunch box as I held the chopsticks in my mouth. It certainly looked expensive, with a variety of side dishes and had a fine appearance. I had no particular dislike except for raw carrots, so I opened the lunch box without any complaints.\u201cKim Woo-jin. Aren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to eat.\u201dCompared to Min Ah-rin, who ate very well, Kim Woo-jin only glared at Park Geon-ho with a sullen face but had not touched the lunch box. I looked at the lunch boxes spread out on the table and handed him the one with pork cutlet and sausage.\u201cBut you still have to eat breakfast. This one looks like it\u2019ll be delicious.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt looked cute and seemed like young people would like it, so I thought it was a perfect fit for\u00a0 Kim Woo-jin. As expected, Kim Woo-jin did not refuse and received the lunch box.\u201cWhat does your family look like?\u201d Park Geon-ho asked, who was watching Kim Woo-jin with his chin on his hand.I put the tofu in my mouth and answered without sincerity, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of you asking that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s cold. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Kim Woo-jin interrupted, swallowing his food in a hurry. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a white t-shirt and jeans again today. Obviously, he has an ulterior motive.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being likeable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good mindset!\u201d\u201c\u2026can we stop talking about that?\u201dI lowered my head as I felt my face heat up.Oh, it\u2019s really hard to handle these three.T/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: oho, Kim Woo-jin made the most progress\u2026.

But the obvious one is, of course, Geon-ho lolAnd no, if you read carefully, the one who mentioned \u201cwhite t-shirt and jeans\u201d is\u2026 Min Ah-rin? Yi-gyeol just said he likes an innocent woman or a pure woman (though he was kind of not sure about his answer himself).Also, let\u2019s give award for Woo-jin who was the first one to sleep together with Yi-gyeol and cuddled him lol congrats congrats wwwwwwwIf you noticed, the previous chapter has cut scene for the summary of this series.

It\u2019s perfectly normal for a man to have that kind of taste\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, why don\u2019t you just shut up and eat?\u201dPark Geon-ho, who sat across from me and smiled, was an ass*. I looked for the remote control and pressed the button to distract my attention.Beep.[Yes! This is in front of the Guild Management Headquarters. Guild Masters are arriving one after another to attend the afternoon meeting. Ah, as I speak, the Roheon Guild arrived!][Kyaaaa~!][Master Lee Joo-ha!]On the screen, I could see Roheon Guild Master and Ha Tae-heon just getting out of the car. The two in black suits looked very good together in my opinion. The Roheon Guild Master smiled and waved a hand to the cheering people around her.[You\u2019re pretty, Joo-ha\u00a0unnie~!][Kyaaa! Ha Tae-heon!][Please look this way!\u00a0Oppa!][So cool, Ha Tae-heon!]Ha Tae-heon\u2019s name could be heard quite loudly while he was standing silently. The girls who cried out his name even held up placards.\u201cHe looks like an idol\u2026\u201dI knew he was popular, but I didn\u2019t expect it would be to this extent\u2026 As I mumbled, Min Ah-rin murmured while eating egg rolls, \u201cHa Tae-heon is more than an idol. He\u2019s SS-rank. The number of fan cafe members** is no joke.\u201d\u201cA fan cafe?\u201dO-our main character, Tae-heon, has a fan cafe? With trembling eyes, I asked Min Ah-rin again, \u201cThere\u2019s a fan cafe? Really? How many members are there?\u201d\u201cThat, I don\u2019t know. To be exact, well\u2014there\u2019s probably a separate site for it. If you look it up, you can find it?\u201d\u201cFan cafe\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s fan cafe\u2026 No, he had many fans even before that.Come to think about it, it was well deserved. He was handsome, cool, sincere\u2026 It would be weird not to have one, right.\u2018How do I find a fan cafe? Can I search for it? Can I sign up with Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s information?\u2019Somehow, I lost my appetite. I put down my chopsticks and seriously thought about the fan cafe. To be honest\u2026 I\u2019m a little curious.After all, as a reader of \u2018Abyss\u2019, I knew more than most people. Wasn\u2019t it okay to go to a fan cafe? Or, when I meet Ha Tae-heon later, I\u2019ll talk about the fan caf\u00e9\u2026\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, do you like Ha Tae-heon?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201c\u2026what is it? Why are you so surprised? Suspicious.\u201dAs I was thinking about something else, I was caught off guard. Kim Woo-jin looked suspiciously at my strange reaction. Min Ah-rin and Park Geon-ho looked excited.\u201cEhem. Don\u2019t be suspicious. It\u2019s not like that.\u201dIn embarrassment, I coughed in vain and looked elsewhere. The voice of a lively reporter filled the space where a strange silence fell upon the room.[What a popular guild! There are a few guilds that have not arrived yet. Thirty minutes left until the meeting begins\u2026]I picked up a glass of water to avoid the three pairs of eyes that were stuck on me. I filled my mouth with water and tried to swallow it.[Requiem Guild! Requiem Guild has arrived!][Kyaaaaa! Cheon Sa-yeon~!][Get out of the way! Master Cheon Sa-yeon! Please look this way once!][You\u2019re so cool,\u00a0Oppa! Cheon Sa-yeon!][Milky white Cheon Sa-yeon! My love, Cheon Sa-yeon!] (Milky white [\uc6b0\uc733\ube5b\uae54] is meant to praise someone\u2019s fair and clear skin)\u201cPfft\u2014!\u00a0Cough, cough!\u00a0Gurgh!\u201dAt the sudden news of Cheon Sa-yeon, I coughed out half of the water I was holding on to as if vomiting blood.\u201cCough, cough! Ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you okay, Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cThe hell, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cHaha, hahahaha!\u201dI coughed violently until tears came out. Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin patted me on the back restlessly, while Park Geon-ho grabbed his stomach and laughed like he was out of breath.[Wow, Master Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s popularity is beyond imagination. It\u2019s amazing every time I see it!][Kyaaaaa! Cheon Sa-yeon! Look over here!][Hngh, he\u2019s so handsome\u2026][Cheon Sa-yeon! Cheon Sa-yeon!][Master Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s greeting the fans! It\u2019s really sweet. I can see why there are so many fans.]\u201cBullshit.\u201dWhat \u201csweet\u201d?It was hard to see Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s brightly smiling face as he bowed his head. He was only there for a meeting, did this make sense? It was really ridiculous.Iith mixed feelings, I asked, \u201c\u2026by any chance, is Master Cheon Sa-yeon more popular than Ha Tae-heon?\u201d\u201cWhat? Of course he is.\u201dWhy was that so natural? I couldn\u2019t argue with Min Ah-rin, so I grumbled inwardly.\u201cEven if Roheon Guild\u2019s member and the Master are both SS-rank, the difference in influence is huge. It\u2019s not easy to get the position of No. 1 Guild Master in Korea.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who laughed cheerfully, said as he opened a bottle of water, \u201cMaster is welcome both at home and abroad. His network is wide enough to get acquainted with SS-rankers all over the world.\u201d\u201cYou know very well.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve known him for a long time.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was listening to her words, said, \u201cThere was a rumor that you were an early member of the Requiem Guild\u2026 So it\u2019s true.\u201dPark Geon-ho nodded his head. \u201cNow, the guild is stable in many ways, but in the beginning, things were uncertain. At that time, the Master was also young.\u201d\u201cA younger Master. I can\u2019t imagine it.\u201dI quietly agreed with Min Ah-rin\u2019s words. A young and immature Cheon Sa-yeon. It didn\u2019t suit him.\u201cIt\u2019s understandable when you see it now. He used to be the sensitive type, but he struggled a bit to raise the guild by himself so his personality got worse over time.\u201dI blinked slowly and leaned back on the chair.\u2018He raised the guild by himself?\u2019It was very interesting because the past of Cheon Sa-yeon was never mentioned in the novel. I didn\u2019t expect to get such valuable information from Park Geon-ho. It was an unexpected harvest.\u2018His appearance is like a young master from a\u00a0chaebol\u00a0family\u2026\u2019 (Chaebol = conglomerate)I tapped the handle of the chair with my finger and glanced at Park Geon-ho.\u201cWell, whatever past he had, I am satisfied now that he is a good-paying boss.\u201d\u201cThat is the most important thing.\u201dSeeing how he changed his words, it seemed that he had no intention of talking about Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s past anymore. I turned my gaze away from Park Geon-ho, who was talking with Min Ah-rin, and looked at the TV. On the screen, it seemed that the broadcast had ended and advertisements for drinks were appearing.* * *\u201cThank you, it was fun.\u201d Min Ah-rin looked at me and smiled brightly.\u201cHaha\u2026 Me, too,\u201d I answered, fakely happy.\u201cLet\u2019s hang out again next time! Together with Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0and Team Leader.\u201dNo, that\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf I let it go any further than this, they\u2019ll set a day for next time, so I hurriedly pushed Min Ah-rin\u2019s back.\u201cYes, yes. Go ahead, Min Ah-rin-ssi. You need to catch the bus.\u201d\u201cEhh, I don\u2019t want to go. Shall I just cancel the appointment?\u201d\u201cI heard they are friends you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. You can\u2019t do that. Have fun.\u201dMin Ah-rin, befitting her sociable nature, had countless appointments during her vacation. She said she cancelled some of them and spent the day with me and Kim Woo-jin, but I want to tell her that next time she didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201cSee you after vacation!\u201dMin Ah-rin left the room, waving her hand softly. I sighed at the closed door and shifted my gaze to Park Geon-ho, who was standing behind me.\u201cAren\u2019t you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m free.\u201dI remembered Min Ah-rin\u2019s explanation that the Special Operations Division\u2019s schedule was not tight. Damn it\u2026\u201cI want to take a rest\u2026 I\u2019ll see you later, so let\u2019s call it a day.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Park Geon-ho raised his eyebrows as if he was surprised by my words.\u201cIt was an honour to meet you.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re seeing him later? Why\u2026 why?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was lying on the sofa and fiddling with his cell phone, came running in surprise.\u201cYes. I\u2019m curious too. Why did you suddenly change your mind?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe reason was, of course, to find out about Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s past, but my conscience hurt to answer honestly. It could hurt Park Geon-ho\u2019s feelings and I could miss the chance.After thinking about it, I came up with the easiest answer.\u201cI became interested.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. It was true that I was interested.\u201cInterested?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0Interested?\u201d Kim Woo-jin pulled my arm strongly. What was with you?Kim Woo-jin, who was constantly fussy, was annoying, but right now meeting with Park Geon-ho was more important.Before Park Geon-ho said nonsense, I added, \u201cI\u2019ll decide the day we meet.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201dPark Gun-ho nodded his head. For a person who came into the room with packed lunch, this was a simple reaction.\u201cThen see you next time.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who accomplished his purpose, left the room without hesitation. Kim Woo-jin, who was staring at Park Geon-ho more intensely than ever before, started whining as soon as the door closed.\u201cWhy are you meeting him? What are you going to do with him? I\u2019m coming, too!\u201d\u201cWhy are you coming?\u201d\u201cTo keep an eye on you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t have orders to.\u201dKim Woo-jin flinched at my words and closed his lips. I said it out of uncertainty, but I guessed it was true. Right. Cheon Sa-yeon was not an idiot\u2014there was no way I was going to let Kim Woo-jin watch over me.\u2018That will make it more complicated\u2026\u2019There was a possibility that he sent someone other than Kim Woo-jin. It was not easy to understand his intentions as he was someone who could not be vigilant.\u201cHaa, Kim Woo-jin.\u201dNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn\u2019t find the right answer. I called for Kim Woo-jin, who looked around and glanced at me.\u201cOkay, go get some coffee.\u201d\u201cCoffee?\u201dIf he was going to stick around anyway, I would just have him run an errand. You\u2019ve been provided with a place to stay and meals, so pay for it.\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a cafe across the street.\u201d\u201c\u2026what are you going to drink?\u201d\u201cVanilla latte. With ice.\u201dWhile answering the question, I suddenly found something on my t-shirt. It was dark navy, so it didn\u2019t show much, but it was uncomfortable to keep wearing it.\u201cSweet things that don\u2019t fit your personality\u2026 Uwaack!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dWithout hesitation, I crossed my arms and took off my t-shirt, and Kim Woo-jin, who was grumbling and carrying his wallet, screamed. It was so loud that my brow wrinkled.\u201cWh-what! W-why\u2019re you\u2014t-taking off your clothes\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about now? Are you crazy? Go get some coffee.\u201d\u201cHah, fuck. Damn it\u2026 my heart, ah\u2026\u201d\u201cI said to go.\u201dKim Woo-jin grabbed his chest and spat out swear words. I had been wanting to say something for a while, but well. I clicked my tongue as I watched Kim Woo-jin leave the room with a staggering pace.\u201cIt\u2019s a little quiet now.\u201dWearing a white shirt, I opened the package and looked around the room with satisfaction. Because I was comfortable being alone.\u201cHmm, hm.\u201dI hummed and lifted the bed mattress with my ability. Fortunately, the items that I hid before entering the gate were still there. I turned it on right away and pressed the call button.\u2018I wonder if he can\u2019t pick up right now.\u2019The start time of the meeting held at the Guild Management Headquarters was 3 hours before now. If the meeting had been prolonged, it was highly likely that it was not over yet. When I was trying to figure out when I could try again, I heard a click in my ear.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi?\u201d[\u2026say what you want.]His voice was cold and blunt, enough that I could feel his dissatisfaction even over the phone.With a smile on my face, I said, \u201cPlease make time for a date.\u201dT/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Wao, sleeping with one man, setting a date with one man, going on a date with another man\u2014 //slapped*was an ass. \uc7ac\uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4.

It was 2:00 a.m. in the morning, and it was very quiet outside in the thick darkness.\u201cMmh\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was sleeping on the sofa, tossed and turned. After looking at him for a moment, I turned my head and leaned out the window without hesitation. As I raised my powers and wrapped myself in wind, I could see an empty street beneath my feet.I closed the window and put the backpack I was holding in my hand on my back. The amount of trouble I was going through for this\u2026There could\u2019ve been a watcher sent by Cheon Sa-yeon, so I came out through the window instead of the building entrance. Since people with the ability to fly were very rare, the sky was the only way I could travel safely.\u201cThis should be the right place.\u201dI flew east for about 20 minutes and looked at the surrounding buildings. A large luxury hotel caught my eye. I said I\u2019d wait near that hotel. I\u2019m sure somewhere here\u2026\u201cAh.\u201dI found a black sedan parked in the dark alley, just next to the hotel. I flew straight there. I landed onto the ground and knocked on the car window, then opened the car door slightly.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dAs expected, Ha Tae-heon was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. When I greeted him with a smile, he raised his chin and motioned to get on.\u201cThen excuse me.\u201dI put my buttocks on the passenger seat and closed the car door. Inside the clean car, there was a faintly heavy scent. Was it the cologne Ha Tae-heon used?\u201cWe\u2019re setting off now.\u201d\u201cAh, wait a minute.\u201dAs if he had been working until this hour, Ha Tae-heon was still wearing a suit. I took a black hat from my backpack and held it out to him.\u201c\u2026what are you doing now?\u201dWhat do you mean \u2018what are you doing\u2019? That\u2019s unfair.\u201cWe need to stop by somewhere before the gate.\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s black eyes, which were looking down at the hat, turned toward me. When I met Ha Tae-heon\u2019s stern gaze in the already dark car, my mouth went dry.\u201cSince you\u2019re here, please come with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs I spoke with a clever smile, Ha Tae-heon frowned.\u201cAhem. S-class or higher item.\u201d Before he could change his mind, I coughed and reminded him of my value once again.\u201c\u2026put on your seat belt.\u201dPhew.As soon as I fastened my seat belt, Ha Tae-heon started the car.* * *Those with the crafting ability were interested in the materials and items of the monster corpses that could be obtained inside the gate.They usually produced and studied items in research institutes established in large guilds such as Requiem or Roheon, but there were many who did not.Red Market.It was a marketplace for items selling in a space twisted by a space ability user, where producers working in the shadows gathered.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIn an empty subway station. As I spoke while looking at the flat wall, Ha Tae-heon, who was standing behind me, sighed and put on his hat.\u201cMh.\u201dSlowly I raised my hand to touch the wall. It rippled like water and swallowed my hand. After confirming that there were no problems, I went through the wall without delay.As soon as they passed the wall, the first thing I encountered was a red lantern. Under the light purple sky, shops with red cloths stretched out in a row, and various items were displayed on the counter. The market\u2019s interior, with colourful lanterns flying like flower petals, was lively as if a festival had been held.\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with and get out.\u201d Ha Tae-heon said in a tired voice, as he followed behind me. Although it was a unique outfit that consisted of a black suit and a hat, it matched quite well. As expected of the main character\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can get it in no time.\u201d\u201c\u2026get what?\u201d Ha Tae-heon asked in a curious voice.I didn\u2019t feel the need to explain, so I walked ahead and motioned him to follow me.\u201cSnail fluids, good for your skin!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re selling swords and shields made of Grey Turtle Monster shells!\u201d\u201cHow much for three of these?\u201dThe market was crowded with people buying and selling items. I looked carefully at the store, recalling the contents of the novel.\u2018It was said that it was in the alley on the right of a store that only sells red fabrics?\u2019Red, red\u2026 Because there were so many people passing by, it was not easy to check the items in the store. As I scrambled to see the inside of the store shrouded in crowds, my feet twisted and my body stumbled.\u201cHhgh!\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dHa Tae-heon quickly grabbed my falling body. I would have rolled the dirt floor if he hadn\u2019t.I smiled awkwardly as I looked up at Ha Tae-heon, who hugged me around my waist.\u201cThank y\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Ha Tae-heon said, as he looked at me with a stern look and let me go.\u201cIf I leave it to you, we\u2019ll be wandering around here until morning. Tell me, what are you looking for?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t know it would be this hard to find\u2026I didn\u2019t have the courage to complain openly, so I answered meekly, \u201c\u2026a store that only sells red fabrics.\u201dLet\u2019s see how well you find it. It wasn\u2019t easy to find when there were so many people\u2026\u201cThere it is. A store that only sells red fabrics.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dWas it there\u2026?Ha Tae-heon pointed to the other side with a sullen expression. There was a store with only red fabrics on display.\u2018What? The protagonist can even find this sort of thing?\u2019I couldn\u2019t believe it.Ha Tae-heon looked down at me as I was frustrated. What on earth.As mentioned in the novel, I entered the alley on the right. As I walked along the narrow and messy alleyway, there was an old and messy store as if it was about to collapse.\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d I shouted as I moved away the cloth covering the entrance.The interior, where large pieces of leather were piled up at random, could not be said to be clean. Ha Tae-heon, who liked things to be neat, had a wrinkled brow.\u201cWho are you?\u201dSomeone walked out from the dark. It was an old man with a very thin body and a grey beard that went down to his chest.\u2018That\u2019s him.\u2019I smiled and greeted him politely when I saw the round, black sunglasses draped over his nose.\u201cHello. We\u2019re here to browse your goods.\u201d\u201cGoods?\u201dThe old man raised his long eyebrows that came down to his temples. His eyes were clearly different without the sunglasses.\u201cAs you can see, this old man only has animal skins. Do you want to look at what I have anyway?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d I continued to tap the dusty desk with my fingers. \u201cWhat I want is an \u2018inventory\u2019 that you\u2019ve made yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was standing next to me, looked a little surprised. That was understandable. You would never have imagined that such a shabby old man would be an inventory item maker.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, young man,\u201d after a moment of silence, the old man said. \u201cYou got the wrong person. I\u2019m just a little old man guarding this old store.\u201dThe old man coughed harshly and turned his back away from me. His hand on his bumpy cane trembled thinly.\u201cIf you understand, just go back.\u201d\u201cThen you don\u2019t need this either.\u201dI carefully pulled out the items I had in my backpack. The old man\u2019s face, who looked back with a puzzled expression, was instantly distorted with astonishment.\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026!\u201dA hazy blue light spread in the dark store. Seeing the item on my palm, Ha Tae-heon murmured, \u201cA sapphire-tailed butterfly?\u201dCorrect. The wings of the sapphire-tailed butterfly, which didn\u2019t lose their light no matter how long it\u2019s been, sparkled brilliantly.\u201cW-wait! Show it to me!\u201dThe old man, who\u2019d been acting helplessly like he was going to fall over at any moment, threw his cane aside and ran towards me.I smiled brightly and swung my hands upwards. Then the old man, who was only half my height, stomped his feet and cried, \u201cHey, let me see for a second!\u201d\u201cHaha, what do you want to see?\u201d\u201cOf course I want to confirm with my own two eyes that it\u2019s a real sapphire-tailed butterfly wing\u2026!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I am giving this to the inventory maker. You can\u2019t see it.\u201d\u201cWh-what\u2026!\u201dAt my words, the old man bit his lip and shook.Li Wei (\ub9ac\uc6e8\uc774), the creator of only 800 inventory items and the first space controller in the world. He was an old man who was crazy about shiny things.Li Wei, who used his powers to gather shiny objects around the world, had a few favourite items, one of which was a sapphire-tailed butterfly wing.\u201cI am very sorry, too. I thought he\u2019d be here, so I brought the wings, but it was in vain.\u201dOnly a few knew that Li Wei was collecting sapphire-tailed butterfly wings. It also meant that there were very few people who could retrieve them for him.\u201cI even got four.\u201d\u201cFour!\u201dThe old man, Li Wei, opened his eyes. I smiled with compassion.There was no way he wouldn\u2019t fall for it. The number of sapphire-tailed butterfly wings that Li Wei currently collected\u2014\u201cI-I\u2019m Li Wei! I\u2019m the inventory maker! Show me right now!\u201d\u2014was 96.\u201cWhat? Are you the old man? But you weren\u2019t earlier\u2026\u201d I widened my eyes, pretending to be startled.\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to get rid of all the idiots who come visit me all the time! Come on, show me!\u201dLi Wei stomped on his legs like he was frustrated. Oh my, pardon me*. I grinned and this time hid the wings behind my back.\u201cThis bastard! I asked you to show me, so why are you hiding it?\u201d\u201cEh, it\u2019s a loss if I show it to you.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you a little bastard?\u00a0Engh!\u201dLi Wei, who was glaring at me, turned his back and started looking around the corner of the store. I looked at him with joy and my eyes met Ha Tae-heon, who was standing next to me.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s eyes on me were uncomfortable. It was like they were saying I was the best scammer in the world\u2026 What? What did I say?\u201cHere, take it!\u201dAfter searching for a while, Li Wei threw something at me. It was a small bag made of leather.\u201cOh.\u201dWhen I touched the bag, I felt a unique energy with my fingertips. It was clear it was an inventory item.\u201cHow big is it?\u201d\u201c100 items of any size.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have 200?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dYou could put 100 things. It would have been better if there were 200, but this was enough.You could get an inventory item that usually cost at least 700 million won with 4 sapphire-tailed butterfly wings.\u201cHere you go, the wings.\u201d\u201cOh oh\u2026!\u201dI packed the inventory item into my backpack and handed the wings to Li Wei. Li Wei, who carefully picked up the wings with both hands, let out a scream of joy and jumped up and down.\u201cFinally, I have collected all 100! Hehehehe! Pretty, pretty! Hehe!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI got goosebumps as I watched Li Wei stroking the wings with half-crazed eyes. That was real madness\u2026As I dragged Ha Tae-heon, who had an unpleasant expression on his face, to the door, I shouted, \u201cThen, old man, I\u2019ll come again next time.\u201d\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t come again!\u201dAlthough Li Wei was a space controller, he was also an outstanding producer.He was a wasteful person who only made and finished inventory items. I left the store thinking I should come back again later.\u201cPhew, we\u2019ve got what we need, so let\u2019s go to the gate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI easily got the item as planned and a proud smile came out. I smiled brightly and told Ha Tae-heon, but somehow he looked at me with a much more complicated gaze than before.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Do you have anything to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who had been still for a while, turned away from me without saying a word. I tilted my head, looking at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s back as he walked ahead.What was with him?Even if you asked me, I didn\u2019t know the answer. I sighed and followed Ha Tae-heon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was one of the gates that the Roheon Guild handed over to Ha Tae-heon.\u201cWhen was it last cleared?\u201d\u201cA week ago.\u201dSo, if there were any monsters, there\u2019d only be around one or two. I walked into the gate.Hwiing\u2014As soon as I entered the gate, a strong wind blew past my face. A barren wilderness spread wide before me.\u201cIt\u2019s very spacious for a B-grade gate,\u201d I said to Ha Tae-heon, who followed me into the gate.He replied, as he used his ability, \u201cI\u2019ve brought you to the B-grade gate in the D8 area, as you requested.\u201d In Ha Tae-heon\u2019s hand, there was a long sword made of black dust.\u201cYou\u2019d better get it right.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me much, do you? I\u2019ve even signed a contract.\u201d\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t me, it\u2019d be hard for anyone to believe you in this kind of situation.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dWas that so?\u2018He has a point. I\u2019m familiar with him, but Ha Tae-heon has only seen me twice now\u2026\u2019It made sense to be wary.I was a little sad, but I thought this opportunity would make progress in our relationship.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that.\u201dAs I approached him with a smile, Ha Tae-heon narrowed his eyes and backed away slightly.\u201cI came all the way here to find Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u2019s item. If I was going to scam you, I would have run away before signing the contract. So.\u201dI wrapped one arm around Ha Tae-heon\u2019s waist and pulled him in. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body, which was touching my side, stiffened.\u201cLet\u2019s find the item first and talk. Then I will look a little more trustworthy.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 Let go.\u201d\u201cPlease be patient. This is more convenient if you\u2019re going to use your abilities.\u201dActually, I was uncomfortable, too. I reflexively thought of Park Geon-ho and Cheon Sa-yeon. It would be too much to ask Ha Tae-heon to do the same thing like with those two.When I used my ability, Ha Tae-heon and I easily rose up to the sky. I found something round on the west end that looked blurry.\u2018I think that\u2019s it.\u2019I looked up at Ha Tae-heon and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the west for now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy are you looking at me like that again?Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes staring at me were incredibly cold. I pondered and asked, \u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, are you afraid of heights\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cYessir.\u201dSince you said it was scary, I tried to lower the altitude. I pulled Ha Tae-heon\u2019s waist a little more and hugged him, raising his body high.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis gaze became more intense. I guess he really was scared of heights. Serves you right*.I inwardly hummed and moved to the west.The blurry thing grew clearer as we got closer.\u201cWow.\u201dIt was the corpse of some living creature. The dry outer skin was covered with grey sand and thick ribs over the pierced belly skin. The long snout was slightly open, with pointed teeth embedded in the exposed mouth, and its thick, short front feet were hardened like stones. The appearance was similar to that of an alligator in many ways.\u201cBrilliant.\u201dPointing to the area near its belly button, I asked Ha Tae-heon, \u201cHave you ever been inside by any chance?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t go to places where monsters don\u2019t appear.\u201dThat seemed right. Others would look around out of curiosity. Ha Tae-heon was the kind of person who would clean up the monsters neatly and leave the gate.I descended to enter the pierced belly. As soon as my feet touched the ground, Ha Tae-heon mercilessly struck my arm wrapped around his waist.I rubbed my stinging wrist and complained. \u201cOw, that hurt.\u201d\u201cBe grateful that your arms are still intact.\u201dChills.I quietly shut my mouth and followed Ha Tae-heon as he walked ahead.The inside of the corpse was dark and dreary, like an empty building.\u201cLet\u2019s go up towards the head for now.\u201dFirst, I had to find the heart. If this creature was similar to an alligator, the heart would also be located below the neckbone.In the novel, there was only a simple description of \u201cI went inside a giant creature and found a heart\u201d so I didn\u2019t even know where the heart was.\u201cDo you have a lighter or something?\u201dIt was too dark inside to wander around looking for the heart. While I held a thick tree branch I found on the ground, Ha Tae-heon took out a lighter from the inside pocket of his jacket.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, do you smoke?\u201d\u201cSometimes.\u201dYou smoked? I tilted my head. There was never a smoking scene in the novel.After lighting the branch, I applied wind on it once. I moved slowly, lighting the surroundings with a roughly completed torch. Inside the corpse, which was so wide that we couldn\u2019t see the ends, there were many crows with shining golden eyes.Kkaak, kkaak.Despite being monsters, both size and behavior were that of ordinary crows. The crows\u2019 eyes turned to Ha Tae-heon as they flapped their black wings.\u201cAre you saying there\u2019s an item in this place?\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look like there\u2019s a hidden treasure here just by looking at it?\u201dAs I was walking with the light on the floor, I saw an unfamiliar object and stopped walking.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you walking?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m coming.\u201dI turned around, scratching the back of my head. I wasn\u2019t too sure. I\u2019ll have to think about it after finding the item.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dAfter walking for a while, I looked up and asked, \u201cWhat does Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0think that could be?\u201dI raised the light up to check properly. As the darkness receded, something large and round appeared.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dClose to the oval, it had a relatively deep red colour. The stem, which stretched out in many branches, was facing the inner wall, and a clear vein appeared on the surface as if it would wriggle at any moment.\u201cA heart?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dNo matter how you looked at it, it was a heart. Now all that was left was to find the hidden device near the heart.\u300cWhile looking around the heart, Ha Tae-heon found a hole with a unique pattern. What could this be?\u300dThe location of the hidden device was not properly explained, so I had to find it myself. I put the branch on the ground and floated.\u201cI will take a closer look.\u201dI needed to check the heart first. As I got closer to the heart, several crows that had been staring at me as if they were on guard flew away and cried loudly.\u2018It\u2019s like the heart of a living creature.\u2019Maybe it was because it was the only red colour in this place full of achromatic colours. I carefully placed my hand on the heart. It was cold to the touch.I scrutinized the heart carefully, moving to the side little by little. I couldn\u2019t find the pattern I was looking for, but there was something strange about it.\u2018Why is it\u2026 so hard?\u2019The heart of the dead creature was too cold and hard. Like touching a machine.The object I found earlier suddenly came to mind. This\u2014there was no way\u2026\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI stopped thinking at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s call and looked down. Pushing the dust piled up on the floor with his feet, Ha Tae-heon asked, \u201cAre you looking for this?\u201dMy eyes widened. Where the dust had brushed aside was the pattern I was looking for.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI went down and knelt down on my knees, examining the pattern closely. When the wind blew away the remaining dust, all the hidden patterns were revealed.\u201cCan you open it?\u201d Ha Tae-heon murmured, looking down at the pattern..It was difficult to identify the pattern engraved with squiggly letters at first glance. In the novel, Ha Tae-heon found the pattern quickly, but it took a while to figure it out.I pulled out the second item I had already brought from my backpack.\u201cThis is what you need to open this device.\u201dA horn branch from the top of a bluish bighorn tree in an A-grade or higher gate (from chapter 15). Without it, the device couldn\u2019t be activated.I turned the triangle-shaped branch upside down and inserted it into the device. The horn branch and the device fit perfectly as if they were one body from the beginning. After confirming that it was properly inserted, I turned the horn branch to the right.Clack.Kugugugung!I could hear it unlocking from beyond the floor, and the patterned device began to split in half as if it opened its mouth. A cloud of dust rose and a horn branch fell under the device. I took out the box hidden inside it.\u201cTa-da~ look at this, Ha Tae-heon-ssi. It\u2019s the treasure.\u201dWhen I lifted the pretty heavy box and showed it to Ha Tae-heon, he gave me a shaky expression.\u201cWhat. Aren\u2019t you happy? Do you know what trouble I went through to get this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous to open without thinking.\u201d\u201cYou are worried too much.\u201dI put the box down on the floor and opened the lid without hesitation.\u201cWait\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dEven if something happened, there was nothing to be afraid of when an SS-class item was next to you. I checked the inside of the box after throwing aside the lid.\u2018As expected.\u2019Seeing the navy blue coat neatly folded, I smiled deeply.An SS-class coat. Even if you don\u2019t identify the rank, the aura it exuded was extraordinary. I picked up the coat and handed it to Ha Tae-heon.\u201cHere you go, Ha Tae-heon-ssi. It\u2019s yours.\u201dHa Tae-heon looked at the coat in my hand slowly. As I said, it was a sharp gaze that seemed to confirm whether it was an S-class or higher.\u201cIf you want to check its stats, it would be a good idea to measure the rank. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s SS-class, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with checking it out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s above S-class.\u201dHowever, Ha Tae-heon only looked at the coat and did not receive it. Contrary to my thoughts that he would be happy to get an SS-class item, the air surrounding Ha Tae-heon became heavier for some reason.What, why?\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was standing still with a frown on his forehead as if in thought, suddenly grabbed my wrist and pulled me strongly. After this sudden action, Ha Tae-heon said in a low voice, \u201cWhat the hell is your game?**\u201dBlack eyes fluttered in disbelief. A big hand gripped my wrist strongly.\u201cFrom the Red Market to this coat. Have you planned it all?\u201d\u201cUgh, wait\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat were you aiming for when you approached me? Did the Requiem Guild Master order it? Pretend to find the item, and earn my trust?\u201dThe pain was so strong that I grimaced. Feeling my wrists throb, I forcefully smiled. \u201c\u2026why is that important?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhatever reason I approached Ha Tae-heon-ssi, the result is an SS-level item, isn\u2019t it?\u201dI wrapped Ha Tae-heon\u2019s hand with the opposite hand.\u201cThink rationally. Do you think you will be able to deal with the Requiem Guild, which is putting pressure on the Roheon Guild, without a single item?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d\u201cLet me be clear.\u201dI expected that it would look suspicious anyway.Like Min Ah-rin in the novel, there was never a moment when I expected Ha Tae-heon to recognize me as a colleague. Just a good guy who knew a lot\u2014that was enough for me.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon and I don\u2019t have the kind of relationship you think we do.\u201dWithout avoiding the cold gaze, I faced it firmly.\u201cI want to break free from Cheon Sa-yeon, and in order to do that, Roheon needs to be stronger than he is now.\u201dT/N :Proofread by Ciao Ciao.Ciao Ciao: Waaaaaah, now it\u2019s HTH\u2019s turn to hug HYG!

    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe number one guild in Korea was Requiem and the second was Roheon, but the gap between the two guilds was quite large.Whether Ha Tae-heon was aware of that fact, instead of refuting my words, he narrowed his eyes.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to believe that?\u201d\u201cI just\u2026\u201dAs I continued speaking, I lost my balance and stumbled upon the sudden shaking of the ground. I didn\u2019t fall because Ha Tae-heon was holding my wrist, but my whole body tensed because of an ominous feeling.Kugugugung!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dOnce again, the surroundings shook violently. Ha Tae-heon supported my upper body, which was shaking backwards, and lifted his head.Kkaak, kkaak!Countless crows, hiding in the dark, flew up and passed by. A chirping sound could be heard in the midst of the frantic crow cries.\u201cNo way\u2026\u201dGWAAAAH, a heavy roar echoed in my ear. I hurriedly handed the coat to Ha Tae-heon and raised my ability.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here for now.\u201dHa Tae-heon put on his coat and nodded his head.\u201cGgh!\u201dThe ground leaned heavily to one side. I hugged the sliding Ha Tae-heon and hurriedly flew into the air.\u201cI think we need to rip through the leather to leave.\u201dHa Tae-heon grabbed my waist and nodded his head. I continued to climb up past the heart that glowed much redder than before.\u201cNow!\u201dHa Tae-heon raised his sword and swung it over him. As if cutting down through the darkness, the black leather was split in half, revealing the sky between them.As we escaped through the cracked leather, the origin of the quaking revealed itself.\u201cIs it alive?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s dead.\u201dA gigantic, unidentified creature thought to be dead twisted its body as it roared, mouth wide open. A flock of crows were pouring out of the pierced skin, and horrifying screeching echoed all over the place.\u201cIt\u2019s a machine.\u201d\u201cMachine?\u201d\u201cIt looks like the body was modified.\u201dThe strange object inside the corpse. It was part of a large mechanical piece.\u201cMost of the body, including the heart, was machine-like. You can\u2019t say it\u2019s alive.\u201dGiiing, gigiiing!The creature\u2019s mouth, with its eyes tightly closed, gaped open in our direction. An ominous light flashed in the centre of its throat.\u201cHgh!\u201dI quickly turned around. As soon as a chill ran down my spine, a hot laser flew past us and slammed into the ground.Kwagwagwang!The dry soil floor cracked and collapsed with a roar. I dryly swallowed my saliva.\u201cIt seems that the corpse is an S-grade monster.\u201d\u201cThe reason it woke up\u2026\u201dMy and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes turned to the coat at the same time. The SS-class coat. Of course, I didn\u2019t think it would be easy to get, but\u2026GWOOORGH!The monster swung its heavy, long tail and shifted its feet.\u201cYou knew where the item was hidden but didn\u2019t know about the monster?\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s comment was correct. Since such a monster did not appear in the novel, I was very embarrassed by this situation itself. A monster above S-grade suddenly appeared.\u2018Why? Because I twisted the flow of the original plot?\u2019According to the original story, Ha Tae-heon would get the SS-class coat after three months. He pulled out his coat three months earlier, so did the monster wake up as a side effect?While I was thinking about it, the monster fired a laser once again. Ha Tae-heon, who barely avoided the laser by pulling my waist, said in a calm voice, \u201cFocus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Now was not the time to analyze why this happened. Increasing the strength of the wind, I asked, \u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi. Is that monster worth fighting against?\u201d\u201c\u2026for now (no)*. It\u2019s different from normal monsters, so I can\u2019t really measure the stats.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s been modified, there has to be limits. Definitely.\u201dI focused on the monster\u2019s movement. The gesture of crushing the ground with its legs and swinging its tail indiscriminately was very unnatural.\u201cIt looks like the machinery running inside is rusty. There are probably a few things that are broken.\u201dA machine that supported such a large body couldn\u2019t survive without proper management, if you look at all those parts.\u201cNo matter how strong it is, it\u2019s only about S+. It\u2019s not SS-grade.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s S+, it\u2019s the grade newly announced by Requiem at the earlier meeting.\u201dSararak.Black dust gathered from all directions. A long, sharp spear began to form behind Ha Tae-heon\u2019s back.Kudeudeudeuk!The monster swung its tail. A piece of rock popped up as the ground dug in and flew toward us. I looked back, smashing the stone with the wind.The number of black spears that appeared one by one suddenly reached hundreds. The black spears, so dense that the sky could not be seen, shot at the monster with Ha Tae-heon\u2019s single gesture.Kkiiiiik! Kkiiik!The black spears, stuck in the skin, exploded. Numerous explosions occurred on the monster\u2019s large body, leaking reddish-brown liquid. Ha Tae-heon, who fixed his sword, moved his body toward the monster.I\u2019ve already experienced battles with Cheon Sa-yeon and focused the wind on Ha Tae-heon. The black blade mercilessly cut through the large front feet of the monster passing overhead.A reddish-brown liquid splashed on my face. The thick liquid had a strong oily smell that gave me a headache.\u201cHold on tight.\u201dI wrapped my arms around Ha Tae-heon\u2019s neck. At the same time, the monster slammed down on the floor with its tail, and dust came up in a haze and obscured our view.\u201cUurgh\u2026!\u201dThe knee of the monster\u2019s hind legs split and a machine gun appeared. A machine gun aimed precisely at me and Ha Tae-heon started raining bullets with a roar.Ha Tae-heon, who noticed the machine gun just like me, raised his sword while keeping his body stable with his thighs. The black sword scattered into dust, then transformed into a large shield.Tudududu!The gunfire rang out to the point it was deafening, but they were all blocked by the shield Ha Tae-heon made. When the gunfire was over, the shield changed its shape to a sword, held in his hand. I let the wind flow by Ha Tae-heon\u2019s feet to the tip of his sword.Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sword, which was accelerated by the flow of wind, cut off the monster\u2019s hind legs. Instead of bones, machinery could be seen through the leather and oil gushed out.Kkiiiiik!Gukung, gukung!The monster lost its balance and staggered when its legs were cut off. A cloud of dust came up and enveloped Ha Tae-heon.\u201cThe one who cut off all the legs\u2026**\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s words did not continue to the end. Through the thick dust, something was rushing towards us. I opened my mouth with a heavy breath.\u201cIs that\u2014a crow?\u201dKkaaak! Kkaak!It was too big to be a crow. The monster opened its mouth wide, flashing gold eyes embedded in its forehead. Ha Tae-heon cut down the enemy that came within range.\u201cUgh\u2014are they the ones that originally appeared?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it.\u201dWe flew into the air to avoid the crow. The crows clacked and followed in an instant. Dozens of crow monsters the size of an eagle opened their mouths towards us.Ha Tae-heon continued to cut down the crows that rushed at us like they were going to pluck our eyes out. I helped Ha Tae-heon by changing directions in the air.\u201cUurgh\u2026!\u201dAn intense pain throbbed in my head. Feeling limited in my abilities, I hurriedly asked, \u201cIs the exit gate very far from here?\u201d\u201cAbout 20 minutes north.\u201dHa Tae-heon swung his sword and glared at the flocking crows. At that moment, I was hugged by Ha Tae-heon and I felt so cold that I flinched.Among the crows, several black spheres appeared at the same time and exploded like bombs.Whooosh!Kyeeek! Kyek!The spheres exploded and tore apart the crows nearby. Ha Tae-heon looked annoyed at the number of crows that rushed in to prevent him from dealing with the modified monster.\u201cI think\u2026\u201d I forcefully held my shaking eyes and said, \u201cI think we\u2019d better get out. Anyway, we got the item\u2026\u00a0 and as it is\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon, who had been contemplating for a moment, nodded his head and turned to the north. I used my powers in a cold sweat to keep my body from falling. In order to escape from the crows that rushed at us, I couldn\u2019t slow my speed.\u201cHgh, hah\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t overcome the headache and buried my face in Ha Tae-heon\u2019s shoulder. Hundreds of crows were chasing behind us. It was driving me crazy.Kyaaak!Ha Tae-heon, who accurately cut the crow\u2019s neck that was grabbing at the flapping coat, held my waist tighter. My hazy mind became a little clearer.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201dThe energy rushing from my heart began to stutter as if to express that it was no longer possible. My body lost strength and my eyes were forcibly closed. I chewed my tongue, trying to come to my senses.\u201cHuuh\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201dFor a brief moment, my vision went black and returned. Perhaps my ability was cut off, Ha Tae-heon was running on the ground instead of in the air. Ha Tae-heon, who was running while holding my limp body, exclaimed, \u201cHan Yi-gyeol, breathe!\u201dFortunately, the exit gate was just around the corner. Recognizing that he was running away, the crows groaned in a bizarre way, folded their wings and slammed into Ha Tae-heon. There was a limit to cutting down all the crows, biting like a pack of dogs, with one sword.The remaining distance to the exit gate was 20m. I raised my ability to swing unsteadily once again.\u201cGgh!\u201dWith intense pain like someone was driving an axe into the back of my skull, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s legs rose into the air. Ha Tae-heon, who ran forward in line with the wind pushing his feet, threw his body towards the gate exit.Kkaaak! Kkaak!Finally, Ha Tae-heon and I got out of the gate with the crows struggling to stop us. I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and lowered my head.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. Wake up, Han Yi-gyeol!\u201dAs I forcibly lifted my heavy eyelids, I saw Ha Tae-heon\u2019s face under the starry night sky. I looked up blankly at Ha Tae-heon, who grabbed my cheek, and murmured softly, \u201c\u2026you still\u2026 have\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2014have the\u2026 coat with y\u2026?\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s handsome brow was severely wrinkled.\u201cIs that what you\u2019re concerned with right now? You used your ability beyond your limits. You need to get some energy from a healer right now\u2014\u201d\u201cRather\u2026 than a healer,\u201d I stuttered and touched the backpack on my back. Fortunately, it was safe from the chaos.\u201c\u2026yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi\u2026 call\u2026 to meet\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want to meet Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u00a0in this situation? What\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWait. Han Yi-gyeol? Han Yi-gyeol!\u201dHa Tae-heon called me urgently, but I couldn\u2019t answer. My mind was barely holding on and my eyes closed.I\u2019d completely and undeniably fainted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA bright laugh passed by.\u201cReally? So what happened?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d the man sitting in front said in a soft voice. \u201cHe bowed deeply and apologized. Said he didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dI covered my mouth and looked at the man with a smile. The sunlight coming through the window brightly lit the man\u2019s side profile. His fine-grained black hair shone and his slight smile caught my attention.\u201cHow amazing. He didn\u2019t recognize the Master\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, unlike Korea, America is large, so it\u2019s possible they wouldn\u2019t know.\u201dI tilted my head. Is that so? Even if you didn\u2019t know his identity, looking at his face, you can tell that he wasn\u2019t a normal opponent.\u201cHe\u2019s a fool.\u201dAs I murmured, the man raised the corners of his mouth. In a three-piece suit, with his jacket off and only his vest on, the man leaned back on the sofa with a languid expression on his face. He seemed to be very pleased with the leisure time he\u2019s had for the first time in a while.I lifted my teacup to moisten my dry lips, feeling my heart beating rapidly. There was a fragrant scent of tea.\u201cDid anything happen while I was in America?\u201dAt the man\u2019s question, I pursed my lips and lowered my gaze. What should I say?\u201cJust\u2014no, everything was fine\u2026\u201dBy his side, no matter how much time passed, I was not used to life in the guild. Without him, I always missed my dead sister at any time, and it was hard to hold back my tears.A few days ago, while crying in the bathroom on the first floor, I ran into an attendant, and as soon as he saw me, he left with a very unpleasant look on his face. Unlike the other attendants who always wore black suits and kept a neat style, he had red hair and piercings, so he was particularly memorable.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dNo one liked me.When I remembered my younger sister\u2019s face, who always smiled at me, my eyesight became blurred. The man came closer to my eyes, which were dripping with thick tears, and gently wiped them.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dAs if he\u2019d been waiting for them, the man patiently wiped away the tears dripping down.\u201cYou can be sad if you want. She was your only family.\u201d\u201cHhgh,\u00a0hic\u2026 yeah. Really,\u00a0hgh\u2026 I miss her so much\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI was so sad that I couldn\u2019t meet my sister anymore, but at the same time, I was happy. The moment I entrusted my body to the man\u2019s touch was very comfortable. I looked up at him cautiously.\u201cRely on me. You are not alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, don\u2019t even think about dying.\u201dI opened my eyes wide. The gaze of a man who comforted me more tenderly than anyone else.\u201cDon\u2019t die, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dIt was terribly cold.* * *\u201cHhgh\u2026!\u201dI opened my eyes with a heavy breath. I felt a little dizzy as I raised my upper body, covered by a white blanket.A cold sweat ran down my cheeks, but my body was surprisingly cold. I put my hand on my pounding heart and thought about the dream.\u2018\u2026what the hell?\u2019Are you saying that Han Yi-gyeol and Cheon Sa-yeon enjoyed tea time together? Whether it was possible or not, I had never seen anything like that in the novel.\u2018Was it just a dream?\u2019I couldn\u2019t be sure because I didn\u2019t know about Han Yi-gyeol or Cheon Sa-yeon. As I sighed in frustration, the previously closed door swung open as someone entered.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dInstead of a suit, Ha Tae-heon was wearing a white shirt with a Chinese collar. He looked closely at me and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright. More important than that, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the hospital room of the Roheon Guild.\u201d\u201cRoheon Guild? Ah.\u201dOnly then did I remember that I had fainted as soon as I got out of the gate. I panicked and got out of bed.\u201cWhat\u2014what time is it now?\u201dHa Tae-heon checked his watch.\u201c11:32 a.m.\u201d\u201cJeez\u2026\u201dI grabbed my head and lamented. I\u2019m doomed.I was going to go back before Kim Woo-jin woke up.By now, he would have known that I was gone, but I was already at a loss as to what kind of excuse I should make.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026uh, it\u2019s nothing. I have to go now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201dAs I looked around the room to find the backpack I was carrying, Ha Tae-heon quickly approached and grabbed my shoulders.\u201cYou just woke up from fainting. Where are you going?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cThe healer will come soon. The healer who looked over you when you passed out. I can\u2019t let you go until we get one more check on your condition.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I am in my best condition right now,\u201d I insisted with a big smile, but Ha Tae-heon did not even pretend to listen.Trying to push Ha Tae-heon\u2019s hands from my shoulders, which were heavy as stones, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m not in a situation where I can just stay. Can\u2019t you just let me go?\u201dHa Tae-heon looked down at me and smiled, almost grimacing, at my complaints of being held down by an SS-rank.\u201cIf I let you go, where would you go with that body? Are you going to meet the Requiem Guild Master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026\u201d\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, can I come in?\u201dAn unfamiliar voice came from behind Ha Tae-heon\u2019s back. Ha Tae-heon let go of my shoulder and looked back.\u201cCome in.\u201dAs soon as Ha Tae-heon granted him permission, a sad-looking man in a pure white robe entered.\u201cHello, Han Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d A man with curly brown hair and silver-rimmed glasses looked at me and smiled. \u201cNice to meet you. My name is Do Ha-seok (\ub3c4\ud558\uc11d), an S-class healer from the Roheon Guild.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the healer who looked after you when you fainted.\u201dDo Ha-seok held out his white hand. I smiled awkwardly and held his hand.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d\u201cDo you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ve troubled you (thank you for your time).\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not the first time Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0has brought injured people.\u201d\u201cSpeaking nonsense.\u201dOh. Then I remembered Do Ha-seok, who appeared in the novel. The healer who treated Ha Tae-heon every time he brought in women, saying he was a sinful man. He did not appear very often, but I remembered he was close with Min Ah-rin, who moved to Roheon.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAh! However, he\u2019s never brought a man before. Every time, he\u2019s only brought women\u2026\u201d\u201cDo Ha-seok.\u201dHa Tae-heon interrupted Do Ha-seok in an uncomfortable voice. Others would have been frightened by that cold gaze, but Do Ha-seok kept his smile and shrugged his shoulders playfully.\u201cYou\u2019re so mean. Anyway, I\u2019m glad. When you arrived, you were in such a bad condition that I thought he came to hide a corpse.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d Ha Tae-heon sighed.\u201c\u2026was it that bad?\u201d\u201cMh. The \u2018hiding a body\u2019 part was a joke, but it is true that you were in bad shape.\u201d Do Ha-seok looked at me with his arms folded. \u201cEnergy is a very important part for those with abilities. When you run out of energy, the impact on your body is huge. For an ordinary person, it\u2019s similar to drawing blood until it\u2019s dangerous.\u201dCome to think of it, Cheon Sa-yeon also said that it was the most dangerous when you ran out of energy.\u201cThis time you had a healer and it\u2019ll get better after a few days off, but it\u2019s never good in the long run because the shocks are cumulative. Be careful from now on.\u201d\u201cMh, yes. I will.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t have used my energy like that if I had the choice. I quietly nodded my head.\u201cHmm\u2026 okay.\u201d Do Ha-seok, who looked at me with strange eyes, immediately turned around. \u201cHe\u2019s in good shape, so I\u2019ll be on my way. I\u2019m busy with work. Ha Tae-heon-ssi, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dDo Ha-seok, who sent Ha Tae-heon a gentle greeting, left the room. After he talked about this and that, he went away, and an uneasy silence settled in the room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAhem. Ha Tae-heon-ssi. Can I have my backpack\u2026\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dHa Tae-heon interrupted me as I carefully asked about my backpack, and pointed to the bed. I shook my head and expressed my displeasure.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I could go if you got confirmation from the healer? I really have to go\u2026\u201d\u201cWho told you not to go?\u201d Ha Tae-heon frowned. \u201cI called Cha Soo-yeon-ssi. She said she\u2019ll arrive in an hour, so meet her before you leave.\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi?\u201d I asked in amazement. \u201cDid you really call her?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me to call her?\u201d\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d I smiled shyly and sat down with my buttocks on the bed.It couldn\u2019t be helped. I had to meet Cha Soo-yeon and finish what I had planned. I just hoped that Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t know that I was away.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cWhere is my backpack?\u201dHa Tae-heon looked at me. I gave him a big smile.\u201cHey, you know how important the thing inside is. It was hard to get in the Red Market\u2026\u201d\u201cHaah.\u201d Ha Tae-heon sighed loudly and opened the built-in closet on the left wall. The backpack I was looking for was neatly placed there.Knock, knock.Ha Tae-heon, who threw the backpack at me, approached the door at the sound of a knock. Meanwhile, I opened the backpack and looked inside. Fortunately, nothing was missing and everything was in good condition.Ha Tae-heon, who was talking to someone through the door, immediately returned to the room. With the crumpled envelopes on the table, he threw the clothes that were draped over his arms at me.After suddenly being hit in the face with clothes, I grumbled, \u201cHey, can\u2019t you give it to me nicely? Why are you throwing it like this?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you want.\u201dSomehow I thought it was familiar\u2014it was the clothes I wore before. My clothes, which had become dirty from rolling around in the gate, had been washed cleanly.\u2018Oh? Wait a sec.\u2019I fumbled to look at the clothes I was currently wearing. It was an ordinary hospital uniform. So then\u2026\u201cSomeone changed my clothes while I was out?\u201dHa Tae-heon nodded his head.\u201c\u2026who?\u201d\u201cMe.\u201dI asked angrily, \u201cWhat about my doctor?\u201d\u201cShould he even pay attention to some fainted bastard? You complain about everything.\u201dHa Tae-heon took a bowl out of the plastic bag and put it on the table.\u201cStop talking nonsense and eat this.\u201dWhen I approached to see what it was, it was\u00a0abalone porridge\u00a0with a fragrant scent (abalone porridge or\u00a0jeonbokjuk\u00a0(\uc804\ubcf5\uc8fd), is perceived as the very item to offer someone who\u2019s sick).\u201cI\u2019m not a patient\u2026\u201d\u201cEat what you\u2019re given.\u201d\u201cOkaaay.\u201dI quietly picked up the spoon.The abalone porridge was very delicious, but it felt very strange to eat porridge in a hospital uniform with a healthy body.\u201c\u2026Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWith a sour look on my face, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a stomachache. If you\u2019re not going to eat with me, please go out.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was sitting in front of me and staring at me with a fierce look, answered, \u201cHow can I trust to leave you alone?\u201d\u201cIf not, then you could at least turn your eyes away.\u201dHearing those words, Ha Tae-heon raised his eyebrows, crossed his legs and leaned against the back of his chair. I was dumbfounded by the more arrogant posture.\u2018Did Ha Tae-Heon always have such a personality?\u2019I thought it was a little different from the novel. I endured Ha Tae-heon\u2019s gaze and swallowed the porridge. I just hope Cha Soo-yeon will come soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to escape this hellish silence as soon as possible, even if it was only for a second.\u201cIs there a place to wash?\u201dHa Tae-heon, who got up from his seat, opened the door on the right side of the bed and showed me the bathroom.\u201cPut your clothes in the basket, and there are the towels in the cabinet.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWithout looking back, I went into the bathroom and closed the door. I looked at myself in the mirror and sighed.\u201cHow did I end up like this\u2026\u201dEven though I just woke up, I was very tired. Were we already starting the attacks on my psyche*\u2026?As I slowly took off my hospital clothes, I looked down at my lower body and my eyes widened. I couldn\u2019t see the underwear I was supposed to be wearing.What is this? Why aren\u2019t I wearing underwear?At that moment, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s face, who proudly declared that he had changed my clothes, flashed through my head.I thought he changed my outer clothes, but\u2026\u2018Damn it.\u2019I tightly closed my eyes and swallowed back swear words.No, but isn\u2019t it kind of weird to take off my underwear? If it was just my outer garments, I could understand, but to take off all my clothes\u2026!\u201cEnough. Let\u2019s stop thinking.\u201dAs soon as I left the bathroom, I felt like I was going to grab Ha Tae-heon by the collar.Son of bitch. Even if it wasn\u2019t for the fact he was the main character\u2026I tried to find my composure under the cold water pouring over my head.Let\u2019s think positively. It was incredibly embarrassing, but once the conversation with Cha Soo-yeon was over, I\u2019ll run away quickly.After finally gaining peace of mind, I finished taking a shower and took out a towel from the cabinet. Now all I had to do was put on my new clothes and go out.\u2018Oh? Wait.\u2019New clothes? Did I bring those in?\u201cHell.\u201dI rushed into the bathroom to escape from Ha Tae-heon, so I couldn\u2019t bring any clothes to change into. I sighed once again, putting the towel on my wet head.I had no choice but to pick up the hospital clothes I took off. Even though I wanted to wear this, I sweated so much because of the weird dream, so it\u2019d be uncomfortable to wear it again.After staring at the hospital clothes for a long time, I gritted my teeth and wrapped a towel around my lower body.\u2018First, let\u2019s open the door slightly and check the room. If Ha Tae-heon is there, I\u2019ll ask him for some clothes. If not, I\u2019ll run out and pick up the clothes on the bed and wear them.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a bad plan. As expected, I was a genius. I sighed and opened the bathroom door slightly as I praised myself. Ha Tae-heon was nowhere to be seen. I opened the door a little more to check it out. The room was empty.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi?\u201dI called his name just in case, but there was no answer. I guess he really went out.I inwardly celebrated and rushed to the bed. First off, pick up the pants and wear them.The moment I reached out to my jeans on the bed.Thud\u2014\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon was back.I hurriedly crossed my arms and covered my upper body, uttering abusive language inside. It was an act of instinct rather than reason.Ha Tae-heon looked at me from head to toe with a calm expression.\u00a0Drip, drip. The sound of water dripping echoed through the quiet room.\u201cI was just\u2026 the clothes\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI forgot\u2026 to take them with me\u2026\u201dMy face was bleached white. My voice, stuttering and spitting out excuses, shook wildly.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon, who had been staring at me for a long time, gave me a low-key response, which made my face crumple.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cYou need this.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who approached me without hesitation, held out what he was holding in his hand. It was brand new underwear wrapped in a thin wrapper.He went out to buy underwear. Looking up, I saw Ha Tae-heon who had an indifferent expression as usual.\u2018\u2026am I being too prickly?\u2019I couldn\u2019t even imagine that he would even take off my underwear, so I guess I became sensitive without realizing it.I said, stroking the tips of my damp hair awkwardly, \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this right?\u201dThud!As Ha Tae-heon came in, the tightly closed door suddenly opened wide. My eyes and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes turned to the door at the same time.\u201cOh\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was a beautiful woman, red hair neatly tied up.Cha Soo-yeon looked at Ha Tae-heon, her eyes widening.\u201cOh, uh\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI dropped the underwear I was holding. Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s gaze turned to the men\u2019s underwear that had fallen on the floor. Her eyes shook wildly.\u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me, the two of you are like that\u2026?\u201dDamn it!\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi,\u201d Ha Tae-heon calmly said, hiding the terrified me behind his back. \u201cAs you can see, please leave for a moment.\u201dWait, what\u2019s with this situation? Explain it properly! And you get out, too!\u201cTae-heon-ssi\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon looked at Ha Tae-heon and said in a trembling voice, \u201cWhen you said you didn\u2019t want a girlfriend, did you mean this\u2026?\u201dWhat? When did you two have such a conversation?Rather than that, shouldn\u2019t you leave?I hurriedly pulled the hem of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s clothes. \u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dTake Cha Soo-yeon with you and leave.\u00a0Ha Tae-heon nodded his head as if he understood my earnest eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the right place to talk about that.\u201dCha Soo-yeon covered her mouth with a pale face. \u201cT-that\u2019s right. There are other people here, but I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhat kind of bullshit was this?I covered my eyes, lowering my head. I don\u2019t know what kind of conversation this was. Meanwhile, Cha Soo-yeon continued to talk without paying attention to the atmosphere.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m very disappointed, but\u2026 it\u2019s okay. If Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0is happy, I can cheer you on.\u201d\u201c\u2026Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a bias against it, either. Well, I\u2019m surprised that your inclinations lie that way, but\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon made a subtle expression. I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and said in a weary voice, \u201cPlease stop talking and leave.\u201d* * *\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201dCha Soo-yeo, like she didn\u2019t know what to do, apologized. I only just got my clothes on. I looked at her blankly.\u201cWell, I\u2019m a little bad with directions\u2026 I went to the wrong room several times, so I thought this would be another empty room and opened it without knocking! I never intended\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. I understand,\u201d I cut her off abruptly. It felt like 10 years had passed in a matter of seconds. \u201cFirst of all, the reason I called Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u2026\u201dI put my backpack on the table and began to explain, but I stopped. I asked Ha Tae-heon, who was looking at me and Cha Soo-yeon, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u2014can\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s going to work?\u201dI didn\u2019t think so either. I shifted my gaze to Cha Soo-yeon. If you have a conscience, do something.As I stared at her persistently, Cha Soo-yeon broke out in a cold sweat and spoke in an awkward tone, \u201cTae\u2014Tae-heon-ssi. Could you leave?\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cHe kept his promise with Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take long.\u201d\u201cIt could be dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that weak.\u201dCha Soo-yeon and I were of the same rank A. If either side tried to attack, there would definitely be a big commotion. Ha Tae-heon had the same thoughts while looking at me and Cha Soo-yeon alternately.\u201cYou just have to wait 10 minutes outside the door.\u201dWhen I added a word, Ha Tae-heon finally nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019ll be back in exactly ten minutes.\u201dHa Tae-heon checked the current time on his watch and went out. As soon as I heard the door click, I pulled out an inventory item from my backpack.\u201cAs I promised, here\u2019s the inventory item. I got it directly from Li Wei.\u201d\u201cHhh, really?\u201dCha Soo-yeon held the inventory item in her hand. After carefully examining the energy, she smiled brightly.\u201cReally? How did you get it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a trade secret.\u201dWhen I first met Cha Soo-yeon and asked for cooperation in kidnapping, this was the condition I put forward. \u2018If you help me with the plan, I\u2019ll get you an inventory item that Li Wei made.\u2019Cha Soo-yeon has a strong elemental ability to handle fire, but she had one big flaw.Although she could control the fire she created herself, it was impossible to control the fire that spread from it.That was the reason why I took Cha Soo-yeon to a tree-filled forest to try to negotiate. Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s ability was too risky to use anywhere other than a gate.So, in addition to items that increased her firepower, she also wore items related to water all the time just in case. The problem was that the items were too cumbersome and heavy.There was a limit to carrying it in a normal bag, so Cha Soo-yeon naturally coveted inventory items. The idea came to my mind in the car because there was no other way.As for Cha Soo-yeon, there was no reason to refuse.\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive\u2026 Is it really okay to have it?\u201d\u201cYou can have it. Instead, please do me a favour,\u201d I said, pointing to an inventory item. \u201cIt\u2019s an inventory that can hold 100 items of any size, no matter how heavy. Please save me only three spaces for me.\u201d\u201cWhat are the three for?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, this.\u201dI took out the things I had carefully placed deep in my backpack. Seeing the object in my hand, Cha Soo-yeon widened her eyes.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the necklace back then?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe cheap necklace that was trampled by Ha Tae-heon breaking the jewelry. I looked at it and said quietly, \u201cI heard that if you put it in your inventory, you can store it safely without risk of breakage.\u201d\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease keep the necklace for me. I\u2019m not in a position to take good care of it.\u201dCha Soo-yeon hesitated to take the necklace.\u201cI\u2019ll ask for the other two later.\u201dThe necklace went into the inventory item in front of me. The whole time I looked at the necklace, I felt the corner of my chest that had been stuffy relieved a little.\u201cThat\u2026 you know.\u201d Cha Soo-yeon, who looked at me with a hesitant expression, struggled to open her mouth. \u201cThis necklace is important, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important\u2026\u201dWould it be okay if I told Cha Soo-yeon? After thinking for a while, I answered, \u201cI bought it for my little sister.\u201d\u201cWhat? Your gift is ruined, then?\u201d\u201cYes. But it doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s dead.\u201dCha Soo-yeon\u2019s complexion turned white.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhy is Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u00a0apologizing?\u201dSomeone else should be apologizing. I tilted my head with a faint smile.\u2018No, now that too is\u2026\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure. In the current situation, nothing was for sure.\u201cSince I gave you the item, so I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you going?\u201dI got up and put on my backpack. Cha Soo-yeon stood up at the same time with a bewildered face.\u201cDid you really call me for this?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dYou ask all sorts of weird questions. I opened the window and said to Cha Soo-yeon, \u201cWhen Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0comes in, please tell him that I left.\u201d\u201cAre you going without telling him?\u201d\u201cI think that would be good\u2026\u201dFor my mental health.I slowly raised my ability.\u00a0Hwiiing, a gentle wind wrapped around my legs and came up.I unexpectedly fainted, but after a good rest, the amount of energy in my heart was quite large.\u201cSee you next time, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh? Okay\u2026\u201d Cha Soo-yeon, who was half dazed, replied blankly.Cha Soo-yeon also had a very dynamic day today, so it was understandable. I felt a sense of unity with her.Without delay, I exited the window. I exhaled worriedly as I raised the altitude to avoid attracting the public\u2019s attention.I didn\u2019t know what excuse I should say when I went back.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t confident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was difficult to properly understand the situation inside through the window that barely revealed half of the living room.\u201cIt\u2019s weird that it\u2019s actually quiet.\u201dI thought a lot about what to do on my way to the Requiem Guild, but I decided that it would be best to go back to my room first.After all, there was no one other than Kim Woo-jin who had noticed that I was away. Min Ah-rin went on vacation, and I had promised to meet Park Geon-ho, so it was unlikely that he would come again.\u2018The problem is Cheon Sa-yeon, but it should be fine.\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon, who cleared the SS-grade gate for the first time, seemed busy, so there was a high probability that he would not be in the guild again this time.After various calculations, I carefully opened the window. As expected, there was no one in the living room.\u201cPhew.\u201dAfter closing the window as if nothing had happened, I put my backpack down on the sofa, took off my shoes, and picked it up.That\u2019s a relief. As long as Kim Woo-jin calmed down, I think I could handle things without much fuss.I walked to the shoe rack in relief and soon found expensive leather shoes neatly laid out.\u2018Whose shoes are these?\u2019In an instant, my body became cold. Staring blankly at the shoes, I heard a relaxed voice from behind me.\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI turned my neck, stiff enough that it made a creaking sound, and looked back. The person who was leaning against the bedroom door made eye contact with me and smiled softly.\u201cDid you enjoy going out? Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026Cheon Sa-yeon,\u201d I said with a deep sense of frustration.\u2018Why are you here, you idiot\u2026\u2019* * *Cheon Sa-yeon, wearing a cream shirt and black slacks, instead of a suit or the A-class jacket, tilted his coffee cup and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been walking around since dawn; you must be tired.\u201d\u201cWhat, do you have CCTV installed here?\u201dI clicked my tongue and looked around the room. There was nothing that stood out, so where did you install it?\u201cNo way,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said in his unique relaxed tone. \u201cI just knew you were living with Kim Woo-jin.\u201dClack.\u00a0The coffee cup was placed on the table.\u201cDue to your personality, you probably wouldn\u2019t have explained it to Kim Woo-jin. Then there\u2019s only one thing. To sneak out at dawn when Kim Woo-jin was asleep and come back in the morning.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who spoke up to that point, gave a meaningful smile.\u201cWell\u2026 It doesn\u2019t look like it went as planned.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to Kim Woo-jin, did you?\u201d I asked in a sharp voice. It was very suspicious that only Cheon Sa-yeon remained in the room where Kim Woo-jin was supposed to be.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I just told him to go home.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cBecause unnecessary control is not my taste.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked at me with calm eyes.\u201cI agree with you that Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin can\u2019t be your leash. Above all else, if I tied you up like that, it would only make you rebel.\u201dYou know it well. I smiled crookedly.\u201cThere is no CCTV and there\u2019s no one watching you, so act comfortably. Just in case you\u2019re curious, the same goes for the cell phone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt means don\u2019t let me down for nothing.\u201d\u201cAnd what if I decide to run away?\u201d\u201cThat. Even though it\u2019d be unfortunate, I\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to trust me that much.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon leaned his back on the sofa for a long time and playfully lifted his crossed legs. It was a cunning gesture as if he was seducing me.\u201cYou trust me. You must be curious about everything I have. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI frowned.Sadly\u2026 I couldn\u2019t refute it. Because every piece of information I needed to know was related to Cheon Sa-yeon.Cheon Sa-yeon smiled languidly at me who couldn\u2019t answer. \u2026oh, shit.The higher the rank, the better the appearance, but isn\u2019t that too much? Of course, Ha Tae-heon was also incredibly handsome, but Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s behaviour\u2026\u201cHmm. I\u2019ve been thinking about it since last time, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\u201cEvery time you do this, you fail to manage your facial expressions. I didn\u2019t see you that way, but I guess you are surprisingly weak towards beautiful people?\u201dI felt the nape of my neck getting hot and lowered my head to cover my eyes.\u201cAre you calling yourself a beauty\u2026?\u201d\u201cSo you think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, but I\u2014\u201dUnable to bear the embarrassment, I choked up and opened my mouth to argue.\u2018Just how many times did I do that? Sure, this time\u2026\u2019How many times was it? I slowly recalled.When I first met Cheon Sa-yeon, I was dazzled by his face and he threatened to pluck out my eyes.Then, when he was fighting the middle boss of the gate\u2026And again\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFor some reason, I was embarrassed to the point of feeling anger, so I quickly turned my gaze away and coughed in vain.\u201cWhy do you stop talking? Finish talking.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dThat\u2019s why it\u2019s my loss if I talk to Cheon Sa-yeon for a long time. I brought up the next point to change the topic.\u201cSo, why are you here? You probably didn\u2019t come here to chat about these meaningless things.\u201d\u201cHow unfair. I\u2019m having a lot of fun.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon shrugged his shoulders and tapped the centre part of the silver metal watch he was wearing. Then, a small square-shaped accessory box appeared in the air.\u2018Is the watch an inventory item?\u2019It was an inventory item that automatically spit out its contents in such a small size. It was a valuable inventory that couldn\u2019t be compared with Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s.\u201cTake it.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon held out an accessory box. Instead of taking it, I stared at it with sullen eyes.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cA gift.\u201dWhen I took it carefully and opened it, I saw a silver bracelet with red gems. Looking at the energy, it was not an ordinary accessory.\u201cIt is an A-class item that doubles the energy recovery speed when worn. It arrived later than expected because it was crossing over from Russia.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy are you giving this to me?\u201dWhen I looked at him with suspicious eyes, Cheon Sa-yeon answered with a smile, \u201cWhy not? You should get something for the SS-grade gate.\u201dOh, that. My lips hardened as I remembered the painful mistake I had made at that time.\u201cYou got the two low-level items yourself, so I prepared this separately. I hope you like it.\u201d\u2026if that\u2019s the case, maybe I should accept it. There was no excuse for refusing. I pondered for a moment then nodded.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to take it back later, are you?\u201d\u201cYour suspicion hurts my pride. Feel free to use it.\u201dSince it was like that, I put a bracelet on my left wrist. I had a lot of energy right now, so I didn\u2019t feel any difference.Knock, knock.As I looked at the deep red glittering jewel, I heard a knock.One of the attendants opened the door and stepped in.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master. You must go right now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt is said that a monster appeared in Area C13.\u201dMy eyes widened at the unexpected report. Like Cheon Sa-yeon, it was the first time I had heard it, and his expression suddenly became cold.\u201cWhat is the situation?\u201d\u201cThey are blocking monsters and evacuating civilians, but the situation is not good. The identified monsters are B- and A-grade.\u201d\u201cWhich guild is in charge of Area C13?\u201d\u201cThe Blun Guild (\ube14\ub7f0).\u201dHah. Cheon Yeon-yeon let out an annoyed breath and got up. I also stood up and said hurriedly, \u201cLet\u2019s go together, Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dAt my words, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s black eyes turned to me. More than ever, his eyes were cold and my mouth was dry.\u201cI need to check something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe need to clear up the monsters quickly so that the damage doesn\u2019t get worse. I\u2019ll help you.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon narrowed his eyes. Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been looking at me for a long time as if trying to gauge something, turned his back.\u201cFollow me.\u201dPhew. I clenched and opened my fists, which were cold with tension, and followed Cheon Sa-yeon.* * *While driving the car, Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t say a single word. He simply fixed his gaze outside the window with an expressionless face.It was a serious situation for the monster to come out of the gate, but there seemed to be another reason.\u2018What is it?\u2019I pondered while touching the bracelet. It was a gift and it wasn\u2019t like this when I was handed the item.Being next to Cheon Sa-yeon, who had become very sensitive, also did not relieve my tension.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201dAs soon as I got out of the car at the attendant\u2019s words, I could hear a gurgling sound from afar.As we passed over the control line by passing the common people gathered with anxious expressions, the ability users who were waiting looked shocked when they found Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cRe-Requiem Master.\u201d\u201cSo fast\u2026\u201d\u201cDarn it. Go ahead and contact the Master!\u201dAmong them, a thin man with a nervous impression rushed to Cheon Sa-yeon. The man smiled uncomfortably as he brushed his waxed bangs.\u201cOh, welcome, Requiem Master.\u201d\u201cWhere is the Blun Master?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2026\u201dAt Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s question, the man became covered in a cold sweat. My face frowned as I watched him open and close his mouth, unable to answer properly.The monster burst out because the gate in your area wasn\u2019t managed properly, but the guild master wasn\u2019t here? Cheon Sa-yeon and I arrived late, didn\u2019t we?Whoosh!\u201cKyaaa!\u201d\u201cWatch out!\u201dThe flimsy barrier that seemed to have been built in haste in the Blun Guild shook violently as we heard a scream.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon called me. As I approached him, Cheon Sa-yeon took out the A-class jacket and the S-grade sword from his inventory and handed the jacket to me.Cheon Sa-yeon, holding the S-class sword with the bloodstains still intact, ordered the man.\u201cRemove the barrier.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dThe man who asked reflexively shook his head with a puzzled expression.\u201cOh, no. The monsters are out of control right now, if you remove the barrier, they will jump out\u2026\u201d\u201cVice Master Yoon Jae-min (\uc724\uc7ac\ubbfc).\u201dI flinched and looked at Cheon Sa-yeon. Yoon Jae-min, facing the chill emanating from him, trembled.\u201cRemove it. Why are you making me repeat myself?\u201d\u201cGhg,\u00a0I-I apolog\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon, who was next to me, wrapped one arm around my waist and pulled me over. \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll give you 20 minutes, so make sure you bring the Blun Master in front of me.\u201d\u201cP-pardon?\u201d\u201cIf the Blun Master isn\u2019t here even after I have dealt with all the monsters\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon slashed his palm with a sword while holding me in his arms. A little bit of bright red blood splattered on my cheek, as I was held in his bloody arms.\u201cWell, that would be fun.\u201d\u201cI-I understand. I\u2019ll make sure the Master is here within 20 minutes\u2026!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t even pretend to listen to Yoon Jae-min\u2019s desperate answer, and wiped the drops of blood from my cheeks with his finger. Looking at him up close, I could easily see Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s visible displeasure.Sighing, I put on the jacket Cheon Sa-yeon had handed over. Because of the difference in physique, it was very loose.\u201cLet\u2019s finish it quickly.\u201dSince I felt like I could be heard by Yoon Jae-min, I urged him respectfully instead of half-heartedly, and Cheon Sa-yeon, who smiled with his wide eyes, grabbed me and hugged me like he did at the gate. Still, it felt much more comfortable than the first time since we had done it a couple of times.My body and Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body came to mind. At the same time, perhaps Yoon Jae-min gave instructions, the cement-like barriers scattered like sand. Beyond the barrier, which was in full swing, the floor was covered with blood.Kyeeeek!Kyaaak! Kyaak!Skeleton warriors emitting black ominous energy came out and screamed sharply at Cheon Sa-yeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFortunately, there were no monsters higher than A-grade. The bigger and more aggressive ones seemed to be A-grade, and the rest were B-grade.I disassembled the bones of the monster that rushed behind Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back while maintaining the wind that lifted us up.Kkyeeek! Kyaak!As I looked at the monster that melted, without leaving a trace, on the blazing sword, I said, \u201cIt seems you didn\u2019t know about this situation.\u201dWhen I saw and heard it, I remembered Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s expression, who frowned as if he was confused. It was an unusual reaction from him, since he was always relaxed.Cheon Sa-yeon made eye contact with me and said in a whisper, \u201cYou are very quick-witted.\u201dHwiiing, black hair fluttered in the wind.\u201cI can\u2019t give you any more details than this, so I\u2019d like to pass on it. I\u2019m pretty flustered* right now.\u201dFlustered, my ass,\u00a0I replied nonchalantly.\u201cGo figure. I didn\u2019t expect you to give me the right answer anyway.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no trust between us. How sad.\u201dOf course, my speed was significantly slower than Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s speed. Cheon Sa-yeon, who melted all the monsters in front of him, turned and flew upward. As we went up higher, I saw ordinary people watching us under our feet. There were also many large cameras.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Because I have something else to think about.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAs I swung my hand out wide, the four B-grade monsters that were running were split in two in an instant. The monsters I killed were soon engulfed in Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s flames.\u201cCome to think of it, you said you had something to check when you were begging me to bring you along.\u201d\u201cWait, what did you just say\u2026? Begging?\u201dIt was ridiculous, so I stared at Cheon Sa-yeon. He had a look on his face that asked what was wrong.\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t I right? Like an abandoned dog with pitiful eyes\u2014how sad you looked.\u201d\u201cNo. When did I ever look like that?\u201dThe atmosphere was a bit off, so I was a little self-conscious. \u2018Pitiful\u2019\u2026 I\u2019ve never looked anything like that.\u201cIt\u2019s even worse if you did it unconsciously.\u201d\u201cStop talking nonsense.\u201dThe soaring annoyance naturally turned to the monsters that rushed in. I tied six B-grade monsters at once, lifted them up, and then slammed them down hard on the ground. The skeletons were shattered with a scream. Seeing the scene, Cheon Sa-yeon smiled.\u201cOur Yi-gyeol is tough, too. There\u2019s no one else who\u2019s as well-rounded as you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFine, fuck. It was weird when I listened to you.I let out a deep sigh, shutting off my powers. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was holding me, slowly descended to the ground. There were corpses of monsters all over the place.I got out of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms and took off the jacket.\u201cIt took exactly 17 minutes.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who checked the time, roughly shook his bloody hand. Upon seeing that, I said, \u201cAt least bring some bandages.\u201d\u201cBandages? Speaking of bandages\u2014\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon, who put his jacket and sword in his inventory, unbuttoned a couple of shirt buttons. \u201c\u2014the research team said that they had created a new A-class bandage that was good for\u00a0haemostasis.\u201dOh, wasn\u2019t that nice?\u201cNot bad. There will be plenty of places to use it.\u201dSince there were not enough healers, useful items for healing were always important. If the situation arose, I would buy it and keep it.\u201cWrap it with something like that. It\u2019s much better than leaving your bloody hands alone.\u201dI wasn\u2019t even acting smug that he got hurt. Clicking my tongue as I spoke, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s expression became stranger.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat was wrong with him? I didn\u2019t even joke like I did before.I became awkward at the quiet gaze that only looked at me, so I shut my mouth, but a gasping voice intervened between me and Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cMa-Master Cheon Sa-yeon!\u201dI turned around and saw a slightly chubby man with a sweaty face. After that, Yoon Jae-min, whom I saw earlier, was also there.\u201cHa-have all the monsters been dealt with?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you tell when you see it?\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon, who slowly looked away from me, looked at the man and answered indifferently.\u201cHey, Master Cheon Sa-yeon. This time, I\u2019m really embarrassed!\u201dThe man\u2019s behaviour of hurriedly making excuses was very distracting. Stepping back from Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back, I thought, \u2018This time?\u2019When Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t say anything, the man\u2019s complexion brightened up a bit and added more excuses.\u201cReally! It\u2019s been a while since the clear team went in, and I just happened to have an outside schedule today, so I went\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cOh, huh?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon slowly tilted his head to one side and asked quietly, \u201cWhen was the last time you cleared it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2014that\u2026\u201dThe man wiped the sweat running down his chin with a bewildered expression. Cheon Sa-yeon smiled slightly and said softly, \u201cIf you\u2019re a guild master, shouldn\u2019t you know about the timing of clearing the gates in your area?\u201d\u201cAhem, yes, yes. Maybe\u2026 a little over two months\u2026\u201dI frowned involuntarily.The clear cycle for each gate was two months. For safety reasons, most guilds, including Requiem, had managed the gate every 50 days.\u2018It means you missed the clear time.\u2019It was like a time bomb where you didn\u2019t know when it would explode if it\u2019s been over two months, but even that was uncertain.\u201cMore than two months.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked down at the man in a crooked position and opened his mouth.\u201cMaster Kang Seung-geon (\uac15\uc2b9\uac74).\u201dThe S-rank master of Blun Guild, Kang Seung-geon, trembled at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s cold tone.\u201cI must have told you clearly then. If you can\u2019t manage the gate properly, disband your guild and live in a foreign country.\u201dA fire burned in Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s black eyes as he murmured quietly.\u201cUp \u2018til now, the C12 Area incident was not properly organized, then the C13 Area exploded, so this time it will be difficult to avoid disciplinary action from the headquarters.\u201d\u201cMa-Master Cheon Sa-yeon! I\u2019m really sorry! I mean, I need you to talk to the headquarters, okay? Headquarters\u2014we\u2019ll die if you tell them the truth! Besides, there was no major damage this time\u2014hgh!\u201dBefore Kang Seung-geon could finish speaking, Cheon Sa-yeon grabbed his neck with one hand.\u201cHhh, Master!\u201d Yoon Jae-min, who was waiting behind him, screamed with a pale face.\u201cHaha, you must be a piece of trash. It\u2019s hard for me to listen because I\u2019m afraid my ears will rot.\u201d\u201cKeuh,\u00a0hgh, wai\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten, Master Kang Seung-geon? During the C12 accident, I definitely gave you one last chance. Did I only give you a chance? You made a ruckus about how you had no money to pay the penalty, let alone the cost of rebuilding an area that was wrecked by monsters\u2014I gave it all to you. I also held funerals for the victims. You said you would never forget this grace and you hit me in the head like this after three months?\u201d\u201cHgh, c-can\u2019t br\u2026 please\u2026!\u201dKang Seung-geon\u2019s feet floated in the air. With his body caught in Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s right hand and he struggled without even using his powers.\u201cBecause of the Sector C12 incident, Requiem has taken over control of the entire sub gate in Sector C.\u201d\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon, please stop! You\u2019ll be in big trouble!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in a very bad mood right now because this shit happened in my sub-management area. I\u2019m wondering how this will be compensated.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon threw Kang Seung-geon to the ground.\u00a0Kwaang, the ground was dented and the dust rose. Yoon Jae-min ran to Kang Seung-geon, who was lying on the ground and coughing harshly.\u201cMa-Master! Are you all right?\u201d\u201cCough, this fuckin\u2019\u2014cough, you son of bitch! How dare you!\u201dKang Seung-geon\u2019s veins rose on his neck, where the reddish handprints were clearly visible, and shouted, \u201cA bastard like you, if I tell my father, you\u2019ll\u2026!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon with a heartless expression turned his back on Kang Seung-geon. As I followed Cheon Sa-yeon, who left without any regrets, he continued to shout in anger.\u201cWhat a dirty orphan! I won\u2019t leave you alone! I\u2019ll kill you, you son of a bitch!\u201d* * *When I returned to the parking lot, there was another car beside the car I had been riding in before.\u201cGo back to the guild. I have a place to go right away,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said to me, opening the back seat door and looking at me.\u201cI can go alone.\u201dWell, it was convenient for me. I climbed up and asked the question I had been curious about for a long time. \u201cDo you know where Kim Woo-jin\u2019s house is?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201dWhy? I\u2019m going to go see him, why?\u201cI thought I\u2019d ask. Do you know or not?\u201d\u201cWhat if I do know?\u201d\u201cTake a picture of the location and send it to my phone.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked at me without saying a word for a moment. What\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019ve been like this since before. As if we were having a snowball fight, I set my eyes on Cheon Sa-yeon and stared blankly.He asked, with an unknown look on his face, \u201cIs this the first time you actually met the Blun Guild Master?\u201d\u201c\u2026maybe. Why?\u201d I couldn\u2019t answer yes hastily, so I deliberately answered this way.\u201cWhat do you think of him? Of the Blun Guild Master.\u201dI frowned. I couldn\u2019t figure out the intent of the question.\u201cWhat do I think? I don\u2019t know. What\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was silently looking at me, shook his head as if it was nothing.\u201cI\u2019ll send you a message where Kim Woo-jin lives. Go.\u201dThe car door closed firmly. After hearing a few words from Cheon Sa-yeon from outside, the attendant nodded and got into the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cI\u2019m going to the guild.\u201d\u201cYessir.\u201dThe car started smoothly.I looked out the window and tapped my knee with my finger. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s question kept running through my mind.The master of Blun Guild, Kang Seung-geon. Why were you asking about him?\u2018Did this guy have something to do with Han Yi-gyeol?\u2019Has he ever appeared in the novel? I didn\u2019t know. I tapped my forehead to the window and closed my eyes.* * *I returned to the guild and opened the door to the 23rd floor. After going out, I immediately noticed a backpack that I had not been able to organize because I was following Cheon Sa-yeon to the C13 Area.Unlike when I went out at dawn, I put my empty backpack in the closet, and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s cell phone was hidden under the bed mattress, just like the last time.It was close to 7 o\u2019clock after I washed my body and changed clothes after fighting in C13 Area. It was around that time that my original cell phone rang.After possessing Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, a message popped up on the smooth screen of the cell phone, which had never received any contact.\u300cThis is a message from an unregistered user. Please be careful not to suffer financial demands and avoid damage.\u300d\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: (Photo)\u300d\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: ^^\u300dThe picture was part of the map. Judging from the location, it was a place not too far from the guild. This is enough for me to go alone.I thought about it for a while, instead of closing the phone screen without replying. Still, he might\u2019ve thought I left him on read**. I slowly touched the keypad.\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: \u3147\u314b (ok)\u300d\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: \u3131\u3145 (gamsa = ty)\u300dThis should be enough. I closed the phone screen with a satisfied smile. I was about to put my phone in my pants pocket, but it vibrated again.\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: Is that it?\u300d\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: That\u2019s unfair.\u300dI was a little embarrassed because I didn\u2019t expect a reply. I pressed hard on the keypad. Even if I pressed carefully, mistakes kept popping up.\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: ?\u300d\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: What do you want?\u300dThis time, I kept staring at the screen without turning off the screen. As expected, the reply came quickly.\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: I wonder.\u300d\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: A sincere greeting?\u300dSo nothing important. I snorted, but this time, I wrote my reply carefully so as not to make a typo.\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: Thank you very much (\uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4).\u300d\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: ^^\u2026\u2026\u300dWhen I saw the smiley emoticon, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s unlucky face came to mind. You use emoticons that look like you. I turned off the phone screen and tucked it into my pants pocket.Perhaps because of the time, I was hungry. The abalone porridge eaten during the day had long since been digested.\u2018I\u2019ll have to buy something to eat and go.\u2019I left the room while thinking about the menu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Carrying the plastic bag emitting an oily scent, I entered the alley of an old residential area.In the messy and narrow alley where darkness fell, only the old street lamps shone.\u201cIt reminds me of the old days\u2026\u201dA long time ago, I moved to a similar place when I had just started working.\u2018I think it\u2019s around here.\u2019It was difficult to find the correct location because the address plates on each house were missing or broken. As I wandered the alley for a long time, I heard a man shouting.\u201cYou bastard, you stop there!\u201dA person appeared on the other side as I heard a box fall.I stopped to see what was going on. The man who was running away was caught by the man who was following him and rolled roughly on the street.\u201cKim Woo-jin, you punk, you\u2019re just a pitiful bastard that they felt sorry for, so why are you making such a big fuss? Huh?\u201d\u201cFuck, let go!\u201dWatching the high-energy chase that was taking place, I frowned at the name Kim Woo-jin. As I approached a few steps, I could see the face of the person caught in the streetlight.\u2018It really is Kim Woo-jin.\u2019The corner of his mouth was torn as if he had already been beaten once, and the side of his face was red. The man who gripped Kim Woo-jin, who was struggling, raised his chubby cheeks to the fullest extent and laughed sarcastically.\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019re going to last? You were all high and mighty after a guild accepted you even with your lackluster ability, fuckin\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cGgh\u2026\u201d Kim Woo-jin, who was glaring at the man through his sweat-drenched red hair, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cFuck off, goddamn. Even if you give me a few thousand, I won\u2019t go, so unhand me!\u201d\u201cCocky little bastard.\u201dThe man rolled up the sleeves of his silk shirt and clenched his fists. I could tell his fists were bigger than Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face with just a glance.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re still so uppity when you\u2019ve been beaten \u2018til you can\u2019t breathe.\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes shook unsteadily. As I watched up to there, I sighed and raised my ability.\u00a0Huuk, my body quickly jumped forward.\u201cYou\u2019re going to die today\u2014gu-hgh!\u201dThe man, who was hit on the shoulder by my foot, flew to the side. Kim Woo-jin, who had tightly closed his eyes in preparation for his pain, looked surprised.\u201cHa-Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014you bastard, who do you think you are!\u201d The man who had been suddenly attacked staggered and stood up.I said bluntly, \u201cA passerby.\u201d\u201cYou pass by to wherever\u00a0 you\u2019re going then, fuck you, why are you interrupting me!\u201dOh. I corrected my answer.\u201cActually, I\u2019m his colleague.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe man with a wrinkled expression shouted in a voice full of anger, \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re a guild member? How dare an ability user touch a commoner? I\u2019ll report you to the Requiem Guild immediately\u2014\u201d\u201cOh, wait. Come to think of it, I\u2019m not even his colleague. I\u2019m an independent.\u201dThe man made a stupid expression for a moment. Kim Woo-jin, who had been looking up at me in awe, intervened in the conversation. \u201cHan Yi-gyeol, why are you here?\u201d\u201cTo have dinner together.\u201dSpeaking of which, I handed the fast-food bag I was holding to Kim Woo-jin. Kim Woo-jin, who was suddenly handed the bag, frowned.\u201cSo why are you being beaten up?\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cHey,\u00a0I said\u00a0hey!\u201d The man who alternated looking at me and Kim Woo-jin shouted in an annoyed tone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay out of this and get lost? If you go now, I\u2019ll let you go!\u201dThe words reminded me of the past when I had quarrels. I smiled back.\u201cThat\u2019s what I should be saying. Get the hell out of here. Don\u2019t bully a kid.\u201dAt my words, the man\u2019s face turned red. The man clenched his fists, exhaled a rough breath, and ran towards me.\u201cYou bastard, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dI swung my hand, lightly dodging the obvious attack that flew towards my chin. Wind wrapped around the man\u2019s legs and pulled him down. The man screamed as his face slammed into the cement ground.Aigo, take it easy. I kept moving the wind while looking at the man swear. The man\u2019s body flashed up and crashed into the wall, his arm moved on its own and hit his face, and his leg bent in a strange direction. The man who had been squawking and screaming could not hold on for long and ran away from me in haste.You wait and see!\u00a0He threw out the lines like a third-rate villain and clicked his tongue as I looked at the man\u2019s back who was moving away. That\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have the will to do that. While I was playing with the man, Kim Woo-jin, who got up with his injured body, looked at me with an awkward gaze.\u201c\u2026Hey, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWasting time in useless places only made me hungry. The hamburgers must be cold.\u201cReally, why are you here?\u201d Kim Woo-jin asked, roughly wiping the tear- and blood-stained eye area with his sleeve.\u201cI told you, I\u2019m here to have dinner with you. I have something to talk to you about.\u201dI carefully examined Kim Woo-jin\u2019s condition. When I looked closely, his hands were injured when he fell and his pants were dirty. I guess I\u2019ll have to treat it.\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s go home first. Take the lead. I\u2019ve been looking around for a while to find your house.\u201d\u201cH-house? My house?\u201d\u201cThen are you asking me to go to someone else\u2019s house? Stop asking stupid questions and let\u2019s go.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had been hesitating for a while, took the lead. Seeing from behind, Kim Woo-jin looked very uncomfortable while walking. He must have sprained his ankle, too.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s house was just around the corner. Kim Woo-jin, who entered by the opened rusty door, headed to the basement. There was a strong musty smell.Kim Woo-jin, who stopped by the creaking iron door, spoke to me in a slightly depressed voice.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m telling you beforehand. It\u2019s very narrow inside. Messy too.\u201d\u201cSo what, I don\u2019t even have a home. Now that you\u2019ve told me, open the door.\u201dIn response to my indifferent reaction, Kim Woo-jin let out a small sigh and opened the door.The inside of the house was very cramped, as expected. An old mattress was placed in the corner and there was a hanger with clothes next to the poor kitchen.While looking out the small window and down at the alley ground, I thought, \u2018Wow, it really is similar.\u2019I guess all the semi-basement rooms look like this. The room I lived in was just like this.Kim Woo-jin opened a small folding table and placed the fast food bag on it.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s narrow, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYeah, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAlthough the room was small, it was much cleaner than I thought. After washing my hands in the bathroom, I sat down at the table and unwrapped the burger.\u201cLet\u2019s eat first. I almost died of hunger.\u201d\u201cHuh? Okay\u2026.\u201dAt my words, Kim Woo-jin, who had just washed his hands in the bathroom, also grabbed a hamburger. It must have been very uncomfortable to eat a hamburger because his mouth was torn, but he mumbled and ate well. There was an occasional rustling sound in the quiet room.\u201cKim Woo-jin,\u201d I said, sipping a coke. \u201cDid you try to find me after waking up this morning?\u201dKim Woo-jin wrinkled his face and became irritated as if he had forgotten about what happened in the morning.\u201cDamn, are you talking about that? Where did you go, wandering alone?\u201d\u201cI had some work to do.\u201d\u201cGive me your number. I tried to call you, but I didn\u2019t know your number\u2026\u201d\u201cI left my cell phone behind, so I couldn\u2019t answer.\u201d\u201cI was going to wait, but the Master came\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, okay.\u201dKim Woo-jin became sullen when I cut off his whining in the middle. Seeing that, my conscience pricked me a little and added a word. \u201cNext time, if possible, I\u2019ll tell you. Okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin still pouted his lips as if he was dissatisfied, but his expression was more relaxed.Having filled my stomach, I wiped my oily hands and went to lie down on the mattress. Lying down right after eating was very bad for your health, but I wanted to know something. It was all very annoying and tiring.Kim Woo-jin, who had been glancing at me, began to diligently clean up the trash. Like some neighborhood delinquent, I was lying around on his mattress*, but I got up when he was finished cleaning things up.\u201cBring some medicine.\u201d\u201cHuh? Medicine?\u201d\u201cYes. Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0is absent and can\u2019t treat you, so I\u2019ll apply some medicine on you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dWhile talking like that, Kim Woo-jin faithfully brought ointment and bandages. As I took away the crumpled bandages that looked like it had been around for a while, I said, \u201cSit down. I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you going to do it with that broken mirror in the bathroom? Sit down.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was watching me, sat down in front of me.\u201cClose your eyes.\u201dHe gave me the medicine, but it was a bit too uncomfortable to exchange glances, so I closed his eyes. I left Kim Woo-jin with his eyes closed and squeezed the ointment on my finger.\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cEndure it.\u201dWhen I tapped the wound on the corner of his mouth with my finger, Kim Woo-jin shuddered as stung a lot. From what I could see, he quietly accepted the touch, which was not gentle, as his forehead wrinkled.\u201cNow that I\u2019m done with your mouth, explain.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLooking at him up close, the blood that fell under his eye was not a sign of a serious injury. I was glad.\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what\u2019? Tell me who the bastard from earlier is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin, who didn\u2019t say anything until I applied the medicine and put on the bandage, carefully opened his eyes and grabbed my arm. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s copper-coloured eyes, facing me in front of him, flickered in the light.\u201cIt\u2019s because of my abilities.\u201d\u201cDid he ask you to help him with his work?\u201d\u201cYes. Actually\u2026 he helped me a little while ago.\u201dKim Woojin slowly blinked his eyes. I saw a small dot under the right eyebrow. It was a mole.\u201cI first awakened my abilities when I was 17, and when he found out, he suggested that I work for them in that area.\u201dThat was understandable. In the eyes of people like me, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s abilities would be quite useful.\u201cAt that time, I was young and had a hard time living, so\u2026 I accepted.\u201dHowever, there was no way that labour could have been properly paid. Those guys were the best at beating up stupid people.\u201cIt was fine at first. The job was not too difficult, and he paid for it.\u201d\u201cAnd then the work was getting more dangerous and he wouldn\u2019t pay.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Then, fortunately, I caught the Master\u2019s eyes and I managed to escape from those bastards. When I explained the situation, the master rented a guild room, so I left the house for a while.\u201d\u201cIs the guy who came here today from the place where you worked at that time?\u201d\u201cNo. That bastard is different. He keeps coming back to see how I had been from two months ago. He asked me to help transport drugs\u2026\u201d\u201cRefuse it. Don\u2019t ever get involved with druggie bastards because they\u2019re tenacious.\u201d\u201cHuh? Right\u2026\u201d Kim Woo-jin made a subtle expression.\u201cDid he make a fuss every time he came?\u201d\u201cUntil the last time, he only suggested thinking about it positively, but I didn\u2019t come home often and started to avoid him, so he tried to take me by force.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t do business with them.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Just stay with me in my room.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSince you have been beaten up today, they will start swarming starting tomorrow. Can you handle it?\u201dAt those words, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes sparkled and shone.Kim Woo-jin, who had been sitting stiffly the whole time, relaxed his body and leaned back against me.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t handle it\u2026 I was scared today.\u201d\u201cMh. I guessed so.\u201dThe guy lowered his sharp eyebrows and made a sad face. It was like seeing an abandoned cat on a rainy day.\u201cSo, stay in my room like yesterday. Is the sofa a little uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cNope. The sofa is fine. Much better than here\u2026\u201dI nodded my head. How could a sensitive person like Kim Woo-jin endure such a thing? I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cI\u2019m not asking for another room, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the only one in the room I use. Let\u2019s just pack up and go right now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dPerhaps because Kim Woo-jin felt better after the problem was solved, he smiled slightly at me. I smirked at the sight.It was like having a younger brother with a big age gap. It was cute.Having healed the other minor wounds, I got up and said, \u201cHe might force the door open and come in. Most things might get destroyed, so pack your important belongings properly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing here.\u201dThe only things Kim Woo-jin brought were a cell phone, a charger, and a few clothes. It was very simple.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSo, with Kim Woo-jin at my back, I returned to the guild building. I had an unexpected partner to stay with, but it wasn\u2019t particularly bad.Anyway, for now, Kim Woo-jin was the most comfortable one to be around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meanwhile, I found a first aid kit.\u201cAre there any more injuries?\u201d I asked Kim Woo-jin, who had washed up. He shook his head with his cheeks stained red, probably because he was just in the shower.\u201cDidn\u2019t you sprain your ankle?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not serious.\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dI pointed my chin at the sofa in front of me. I grabbed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s ankle, who was sitting and staring blankly at me, and pulled it.\u201cUwack!\u201d\u201cI see. If it\u2019s like this, with simple taping, it should subside tomorrow.\u201dIf it was badly swollen, he would\u2019ve had to go to the emergency room or wait impatiently for the hospital to open. I was relieved.\u201c\u2026Hey, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cDo you know how to tape it?\u201dKim Woo-jin looked at me fiercely with a face much redder than before, perhaps because it was quite embarrassing to be caught by someone else.\u201cThen why do you know how?\u201dEven though I was doing this for you, you were still making a fuss.\u201cShut up and take it easy.\u201dIf he grumbled one more time, I was going to just stop without hesitation, but maybe because he noticed my thoughts, Kim Woo-jin quietly shut his mouth and let me tape his foot.After I finished taping him, I briefly washed up and changed into comfortable clothes. As I entered the bedroom yawning, I realized later that there was a message on my cell phone, which I\u2019d not paid attention to since meeting Kim Woo-jin today.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRubbing my tired eyes, I turned on the phone to see message.\u300cCheon Sa-yeon: Have you arrived?\u300dWhy did this guy keep in touch with me like this\u2026The message came two hours ago.\u201cUmm.\u201dI brought back the one he sent home, so I should explain the situation to Cheon Sa-yeon, but I had no idea what to write.Actually, I accidentally found Kim Woo-jin being chased by a thug and saved him, but when I heard about the situation, he seemed a bit pitiful, so I asked him to come back to my room\u2026 oh, that\u2019s too long.After staring at the cell phone screen for a long time, I carefully wrote a reply.\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: I brought back Kim Woo-jin\u300d\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: That\u2019s all\u300dIf I got a reply, I would\u2019ve explained more, but Cheon Sa-yeon did not read the message. Was he busy? I swept it to the back of my head and put my phone down.I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s think about it after I wake up.* * *The next morning, I woke up from a good night\u2019s sleep and opened my eyes, refreshed.As I left the bedroom, ruffling my hair with my hands, a delicious smell passed through my nose.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dWhen I went to the kitchen, I saw Kim Woo-jin standing with a frying pan. Kim Woo-jin, who was startled at the sound of my voice, turned around and said with a somewhat sullen expression, \u201cWhy are you up so late?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m late?\u201dI looked at the clock. 11:32 am. Wasn\u2019t it okay to wake up late on a day off?\u201cYou\u2019re cooking? Did you make mine too?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person do you see me as? Of course I made yours too.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThat was a bit surprising. You had more manners than I\u2019d thought.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026omurice.\u201d\u201cIt looks delicious.\u201dRight. If you have been provided with a bed, you should cook. It was a very proper division of work in the household.I took out cold water from the refrigerator, poured it in a cup, and moved out of the kitchen into the living room. I drank water, looked for the remote control, and turned on the TV.[The criticism of the failure of the gate management in C13 Area is growing stronger. Master Cheon Sa-yeon, who attended the meeting held at the Guild Management Headquarters around 10 a.m., expressed deep regret for this incident and expressed his hope that Master Kang Seung-geon would take responsibility. The guild in charge of the gates in the C13 Area, Blun, will be severely disciplined\u2026]Kang Seung-geon, who entered the Management Headquarters to attend the meeting, appeared on the screen. Judging by his nervous face, he seemed to have been called out everywhere he went. I clicked my tongue and drank the water from the cup.[Next news. He\u2019s a person who became a hot topic when the video was released yesterday. He\u2019s an A-rank ability user who neatly handled the monsters that appeared in C13 Area.]I was surprised to see the picture next to the announcer and dropped the cup.Crash!The cup fell to the floor and broke into magnificent pieces, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the TV. At the sound of the cup breaking, Kim Woo-jin rushed out into the living room.\u201cWhat was that sound\u2026 Hell! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t important. I fixed my eyes on the news.[The main characters in the video are Master Cheon Sa-yeon and an A-rank ability user. Experts presume that he has a wind ability and they expressed great surprise at his excellent chemistry with Master Cheon Sa-yeon.]In a startled voice, like he only just understood the situation, Kim Woo-kin asked, \u201cWhat is this? Is that you?\u201d[Surprisingly, the young man turned out to be an independent, not a member of the Requiem Guild. He has a personal relationship with Master Cheon Sa-yeon and it has been confirmed that he also participated in the SS-grade gate cleared a while ago.]My face, as I was flying in the sky in Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms, appeared on the screen as wide as a door. I touched my forehead with complicated emotions.Come to think of it, there were a few broadcast cameras among the spectators. It was quite a distance away, so I thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if they took a picture.\u2018Hey, how could you openly disclose the identity of an independent person in the news like that?\u2019I knew that people with abilities were treated very differently from ordinary people, but\u2026\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\u201cHey, Han Yi-gyeol\u2026 are you all right?\u201dAs I contorted my face and became annoyed, Kim Woo-jin, who was standing next to me, began to pay attention. I took a deep breath and moved carefully so as to not step on the broken glass.\u201cI\u2019m going to wash up first. I\u2019m sorry, but please clean up the broken cup.\u201dI desperately needed a cold shower more than ever before. I walked behind Kim Woo-jin, who nodded his head, and entered the bathroom.* * *Someone violently opened the door to the conference room where silence had fallen.\u201cAre you all here?\u201dClack, clack. The sound of heels filled the conference room.Choi Mi-jin (\ucd5c\ubbf8\uc9c4), the head of the gate management centre had a sharp look, dressed in a black suit. She put down the file she was holding and sat down.Jayna Guild Master, Hong Si-ah (\ud64d\uc2dc\uc544), who had a bored face, twisted her gorgeous blonde hair with her fingers and greeted Choi Mi-jin with curved eyes.\u201cHeh, heh. Long time no see, Centre Head Choi Mi-jin.\u201dBrushing her black bobbed hair, Choi Mi-jin said coldly, \u201cLet\u2019s move past useless greetings. Everyone knows why we\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201d At those words, Kang Seung-geon, who looked around as if sitting on a cushion of thorns, was sweating and coughing in vain.\u201cTurn it on.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dWhen the attendant operated the laptop at Choi Mi-jin\u2019s command, a video was played through the conference room screen.In the video, there was an image of a man and Cheon Sa-yeon, who killed the monster that burst out of the gate.Ha Tae-heon, who attended the meeting as Roheon\u2019s representative instead of Lee Joo-ha, frowned involuntarily.\u2018Han Yi-gyeol?\u2019A pure white face with soft brown hair fluttering. No doubt the man in the arms of Cheon Sa-yeon was the man he knew.\u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to say, Master Kang Seung-geon?\u201d\u201cWell, Centre Head Choi Mi-jin! There\u2019s a misunderstanding here\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing that you broke the gate twice in three months. And Master Cheon Sa-yeon even took care of the follow-up?\u201d\u201cNo, listen, I happened to have an external schedule at that time.\u201d\u201cExternal schedule*?\u201dChoi Mi-jin openly laughed at him.\u201cPlaying golf with the children of a rich family? You want to make excuses for golf when the gate has been blown apart?\u201d\u201cIt was for my guild\u2019s sake! Everyone gets the idea!\u201d\u201cHaah.\u201dAs Kang Seung-geon\u2019s face turned red, Choi Mi-jin touched her forehead as if she was in pain and let out an annoyed sigh.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m frustrated. Master Kang Seung-geon. Guilds exist to facilitate the management of abilities and gates. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t gather funds**. You\u2019re supposed to manage the gates diligently according to the position of a guild master. Why are you messing around with your schedule, just to play around?\u201d\u201cW-what? Who\u2019s playing around? Are you finished, Centre Head Choi Mi-jin?\u201d Kang Seung-geon jumped up from his seat, huffing.\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what business is all about! And, what\u2019s wrong with the gate bursting for a moment? Even if Master Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t come, our guild was enough to block it! Even if there was some damage, I\u2019d tell my father!\u201d\u201c\u2026now look here, Master Kang Seung-geon.\u201d Choi Mi-jin cut off Kang Seung-geon\u2019s words with an expression that said he was being absurd. \u201cSpeak clearly. What about this situation do you think is pretty enough that a legislator can fix it? All I see is a child-like man who just paints his father\u2019s face with shit.\u201d\u201cCentre Head Choi Mi-jin!\u201d\u201cIf you are so confident, call the senator now. \u2018I had an accident and needed compensation, but I don\u2019t have a penny because I was playing around.\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201dKang Seung-geon, who was staring at Choi Mi-jin, let out a harsh breath at her cold words and stormed out of the conference room with abusive language.Kwaang!\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dChoi Mi-jin exhaled a tired breath at the sound of the conference room door closing. Looking at the scene, Hong Si-ah said in an amused tone, \u201cYou\u2019re still the same as ever, Centre Head Choi Mi-jin.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201dWhen Choi Mi-jin, who responded insincerely, beckoned, her attendants handed out each document to the guild masters.\u201cThis is an explanation of the Blun Guild discipline and a guide to the redistribution of the gates. We\u2019d like to ask you to divide 70% of the Blun Guild gates.\u201d\u201cUrgh, it\u2019s just trash,\u201d Hong Si-ah, who turned over the document, pouted her lips and grumbled.\u201cAnd Master Cheon Sa-yeon. I\u2019m sorry, but can you look over the entire sub-management of Area C?\u201d\u201cWell, I can do it if you want,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been sitting quietly until now, answered in a relaxed tone. \u201cActually, the distribution ratio should be raised a little. Because of this incident, our guild\u2019s image also suffered some damage.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand. I\u2019ll raise it to 12%.\u201dIn return for taking over the entire sub-management of Area C, 10% of the revenue from the gate unconditionally went to the Requiem Guild. 10%, considering the number of gates in Area C, was not a bad deal.Thanks to Kang Seung-geon\u2019s accident, it had now gone from 10% to 12%, which was an added boost to fairness.Still, it was an inevitable choice for Choi Mi-jin. Managing the entire area was not an easy task and Requiem was the only guild capable of that.\u201cThat\u2019s it for now\u2026\u201d Choi Mi-jin, who paused for a moment and pondered on something, looked at Cheon Sa-yeon and asked, \u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon. I have a question for you.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled as if to give his consent. He seemed to have already figured out what Choi Mi-jin Choi was going to ask.\u201cThe A-rank ability user in the video\u2014how do you know each other?\u201d\u201cRight, right! I also saw it on the news yesterday and was very curious. Even at just a glance, it seemed like you were having a lot of fun. What\u2019s going on? You\u2019ve never looked like that before,\u201d Hong Si-ah intervened, eyes sparkling with interest.Ha Tae-heon, who had been concentrating on the documents the entire time, looked up at Cheon Sa-yeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Surely I\u2019m not expected to report even private details..\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d like to hear a bit about the A-rank ability user.\u201d\u201cA bit, you say?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve been investigating, but there was no information on when he awakened his powers, or where he was and how he had been. As if someone had intentionally erased it.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon did not blink an eye despite Choi Mi-jin\u2019s sharp words.\u201cWhat is your relationship with him?\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, right now, it\u2019s not a relationship to be particularly proud of.\u201dChoi Mi-jin frowned. \u201cYou look pretty close if that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201cIn many ways, he\u2019s a fellow with distinguished ability. I think why I desire to get closer to him is quite obvious.\u201dIn response to his sly serpent-like response, Choi Mi-jin retorted, \u201cYou are well aware that it\u2019s not good for a large guild master to get along with an independent ability user more than necessary, Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201d\u201cTo get along with him more than necessary\u2026 well. I want to, but the other party doesn\u2019t want to. So even though that\u2019s not the case, I can only regret it.\u201d\u201cStop joking around.\u201d\u201cI answered with sincerity, so I\u2019m sad that you\u2019ve dismissed it as a joke.\u201dTadak.Cheon Sa-yeon tapped on the table with his long, white fingers. The atmosphere that had been swirling around Choi Mi-jin moved to Cheon Sa-yeon at once.\u201cAs you know, he is an independent. He\u2019s not affiliated with any guild, yet if the management headquarters intervenes\u2026 That seems like too much interference, Gate Management Centre Head Choi Mi-jin.\u201dLeaning her body on the back of the chair, Choi Mi-jin closed her lips and raised her eyebrows as he spoke slowly.\u2018I didn\u2019t know that you would avoid answering to this point\u2026\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon seems to treat everything lightly, but I know that in reality, he is a tougher opponent than anyone else. That\u2019s why I deliberately brought it up in an unavoidable situation\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be this wary.Choi Mi-jin decided that it would be better to take a step back. If they talked more about it now, it would only stimulate Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s vigilance. It would be much better to prepare properly later and approach the A-rank ability user rather than Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201c\u2026I understand. Let\u2019s stop talking about this.\u201d Choi Mi-jin got up from her seat with the documents. \u201cI\u2018ll wrap up the meeting. Thank you all for attending, see you next time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving too. It\u2019s not fun here. Centre Head~ Let\u2019s go together!\u201dPerhaps because Hong Si-ah had lost interest in Cheon Sa-yeon and the unidentified A-rank, she got up without any regrets and followed Choi Mi-jin.A cold silence fell in the conference room where Choi Mi-jin, her attendants, and Hong Si-ah had left.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon, who quietly collected the documents, got up without paying attention to Cheon Sa-yeon. A laughing voice caught Ha Tae-heon\u2019s attention as he was about to leave the conference room.\u201cI heard some interesting news yesterday.\u201dClack. There was the sound of neat heels behind his back. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s cold gaze turned to Cheon Sa-yeon. Cheon Sa-yeon opened his mouth once more while slipping his hand in the pocket of his trousers.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I\u2019ve heard about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dThe invisible air between Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon met violently. Ha Tae-heon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Cheon Sa-yeon, who was smiling as usual.\u201cIf you listen, you might think differently. How about you think about it?\u201d\u201cMy answer is the same.\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s too bad.\u201dAs always, it was a tone that did not give off the slightest regret. Just as Ha Tae-heon was going to turn his back, Cheon Sa-yeon continued, \u201cThen, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to report to the media that another SS-class item has appeared?\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s movements suddenly stopped.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite noisy, whether it appeared in the country or abroad. A new SS-grade gate didn\u2019t even appear, but the item appeared.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a cold chill in Ha Tae-heon\u2019s gaze. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s smile widened.\u201cNow you seem to be interested.\u201dThe documents were crumpled in his hands. Ha Tae-heon calmly stared at Cheon Sa-yeon, forcing the storm-like chaos down.How did he find out? Actually, the answer was simple. Didn\u2019t you see him a while ago? He was held in Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms and dealt with monsters.\u2018Han Yi-gyeol.\u2019He knew that the man had something to do with Cheon Sa-yeon. However, knowing in his head and seeing with his own eyes were two different things.The video that Choi Mi-jin showed. Ha Tae-heon saw it and felt very strange. Judging from what he felt, it was closer to the unpleasant side.\u2018\u2026they weren\u2019t breaking apart.\u2019When he thought of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s face smiling brightly as he handed him the SS-class coat, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s mouth flattened.He felt pathetic that he believed even a little bit that he (HYG) wanted to get away from Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cHa Tae-heon.\u201dFacing Ha Tae-heon who was expressionless as usual, Cheon Sa-yeon, with eyes glittering like a beast\u2019s, said, \u201cYou must be quite curious about the dog* who goes back and forth between me and you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhether he\u2019s lost, abandoned, or has an owner\u2026 You want to know those things.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon took one step closer to Ha Tae-heon. His long eyes, which were exposed under his black hair, were slightly curved. \u201cOnce it becomes clear that he doesn\u2019t have an owner, you want to take him right away. He\u2019s pretty useful.\u201dHa Tae-heon wrinkled his brow slightly as if he didn\u2019t like his vulgar words. But in the end, he didn\u2019t contradict him.\u201cHa Tae-heon, would you like to make a bet with me?\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said in a soft voice. \u201cWho, between the two of us, can put a leash on the dog\u2019s neck? Whoever wins pulls on the leash to show him off to the other person.\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the dog, not me.\u201d In response, Cheon Sa-yeon tilted his head slightly. \u201cEven I don\u2019t know\u2026 The dog\u2019s dumber than I thought. Or, he\u2019s greedy enough to try to have both SS-rankers in his hands.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t lying. Cheon Sa-yeon couldn\u2019t really understand Han Yi-gyeol, who gave the SS-class item to Ha Tae-heon.If it was an SS-level item, it would be good enough for an A-rank person to use. But why did he go to Ha Tae-heon and hand it over?Because Ha Tae-heon is strong? Did he think that putting an SS-rank in debt will help someday? Or\u2026\u2018Do you want to raise Ha Tae-Heon?\u2019Whatever it was, it would be fun to watch. Han Yi-gyeol, whom he had seen so far, was not boring.\u2018Well, I\u2019ll figure it out slowly.\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon finished his thoughts and smiled softly. \u201cAre you going to accept my proposal? Let\u2019s try our best.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon deliberately patted Ha Tae-heon on the shoulder a couple of times and then left the conference room.Ha Tae-heon heard his words and began to doubt Han Yi-gyeol. Previously, he was just watching an opponent he didn\u2019t understand. And now, he wanted to figure out which side he was on.How naive.Even though he was cold-hearted, he was a bloodthirsty man.Since he had a lot of cards, he could easily get at least one or two of Roheon\u2019s secrets, even if he didn\u2019t have to use Han Yi-gyeol.When things went according to his plan, Cheon Sa-yeon smiled happily and took out his cell phone. Just then, a message came from Han Yi-gyeol.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s expression, as he read the message while smirking, gradually hardened subtly.* * *Hearing the sound of the conference room door closing, Ha Tae-heon lowered his gaze.He felt like a worm caught in the spider\u2019s web.\u2018It\u2019s my mistake.\u2019Only the guild master Lee Joo-ha and healer Do Ha-seok knew that he had obtained SS-level items.It was suggested that the information be disclosed after the surrounding situation had been sorted out, and Ha Tae-heon agreed.\u2026it would\u2019ve been, but Cheon Sa-yeon noticed. He was pretty accurate too.\u300cAre you going to accept my proposal? Let\u2019s try our best.\u300dIf he did not accept the proposal, Cheon Sa-yeon threatened to disclose the existence of the SS-level item to the media.Ha Tae-heon let out a suffocated breath.\u2018What\u2019s the possibility that Han Yi-gyeol did not leak the information?\u2019There were many places where it felt uncomfortable to doubt Lee Joo-ha and Do Ha-seok. She was a master who acted for the benefit of the guild, and Do Ha-seok was not the kind of person to do such a troublesome thing.There was no one suspicious except for Han Yi-gyeol. If so, why did Han Yi-gyeol do this? As Cheon Sa-yeon said, was it just because he was blinded by greed?Nothing was certain. Has he ever been so helpless?\u300cThink rationally. Do you think you will be able to deal with the Requiem Guild, which is putting pressure on the Roheon Guild, without a single item?\u300dHe remembered Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s words he heard inside the gate. That\u2019s right. The difference between Cheon Sa-yeon and himself was much greater than he expected.\u2018If I had known this would happen\u2026\u2019He should have asked Han Yi-gyeol properly. He regretted it. At the same time, to his surprise, wild and ferocious emotions ran through his chest.If he thought about it, he was a suspicious opponent from start to finish. A bright smile directed toward him and a sparkling gaze as if wishing for something.I will never make this mistake again. In order to do that, I have to properly understand Han Yi-gyeol.Suddenly, he remembered the contract he had with Han Yi-gyeol. He hadn\u2019t taken the price of the item from him yet. If so, he would contact him in the near future.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA strange light passed through Ha Tae-heon\u2019s calm black eyes.Brrrrrr, brrrrrr.The cell phone inside the suit jacket\u2019s pocket vibrated. Ha Tae-heon wiped his tired eyes and answered the phone.\u201cYes.\u201d[Hello? Is the meeting over?]\u201cYes. It just finished.\u201dLee Joo-ha, who could not attend the meeting due to a business trip to China, asked with a worried voice, [Why is your voice like that? What happened?]\u201cNo, everything is fine. I have all the documents related to the meeting. You can check it out when you arrive.\u201d[Thanks. I was worried**. Kang Seung-geon, that guy, makes trouble even when he\u2019s been involved in an accident.]\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d[\u2026well, you know, Tae-heon-ah. Can\u2019t you just pretend you can\u2019t win at this point and take over as the Vice Master?]\u201cMaster.\u201d[I know. You hate it because it\u2019s burdensome and there are so many things to worry about. But honestly, what you\u2019re doing right now is no different from what a Vice Master does, right? It\u2019s just a rank up.]Lee Joo-ha\u2019s soothing voice was full of regret.[And please take a look at your position as a general guild member with SS-rank, of which there are only two in Korea to be able to do so. I\u2019m dying of self-consciousness here.]Ha Tae-heon was silent for a moment at those words.He, who was about to say no as usual, quickly changed his mind and answered quietly. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll think about it.\u201dLee Joo-ha was pleased that he didn\u2019t automatically decline.[What\u2019s going on? You\u2019ve thought about it? Thinking about it is good! Are you recording this? Don\u2019t think about getting out of it later. Please think about it seriously. The position of Vice Master is really good, you know.]\u201cYes.\u201d[Others get down on their knees and beg for it. Oh, my bad.] Lee Joo-ha, who was grumbling playfully, immediately apologized and said, [I should hang up now. You had a hard time today. Go back and rest. I will contact you when I arrive in Korea tomorrow.]\u201cYes. I\u2019ll see you when you arrive in Korea.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who hung up the phone, stood still for a while, holding his cell phone, out a low sigh and left the conference room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was that afternoon when the call came from Cheon Sa-yeon. Kim Woo-jin, who followed me to the front of the elevator going to the top floor, asked me with worried eyes, \u201cIs it really okay if you go alone?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be okay?\u201dI had always met him alone. You were asking me all sorts of questions.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s changed attitude caught my eye.When I first possessed Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, regardless that there was a wound on my arm, he pushed me into the room where Cheon Sa-yeon was, and the second time I met him, he cursed me and made it obvious that he hated me.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve changed? Me?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t care this much about me.\u201dAt my words, he had a flustered expression. \u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t care whether things were hard on me or not, right?\u201dSuddenly, I remembered what Kim Woo-jin had said to me before.\u300cWhat\u2019s up with you today? You usually come out crying.\u300dThat was how Kim Woo-jin dealt with Han Yi-gyeol. When I possessed Han Yi-gyeol, Kim Woo-jin also changed.If it wasn\u2019t for me, Kim Woo-jin would still hate Han Yi-gyeol and would have tailed Ha Tae-heon as ordered by Cheon Sa-yeon.The future changed when he became kind to me. Cheon Sa-yeon did not have Kim Woo-jin by his side anymore.\u201c\u2026I\u2014\u201d Kim Woo-jin\u2019s complexion, who understood what I meant, instantly turned pale. \u201cBack then\u2026\u201dWith a distorted face, he licked his lips several times and grabbed my wrist with a trembling hand.\u201cW-what should I do to\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can stop.\u201dJust then, the elevator arrived. I let go of Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand and said calmly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk nonsense now. I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201dI know what Kim Woo-jin was trying to say. But it wasn\u2019t me who should be listening to it.Even if I became Han Yi-gyeol, I couldn\u2019t handle those feelings and take responsibility for it. I didn\u2019t even want to.I got on the elevator.\u201cSee you later.\u201dBefore the elevator door closed, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face was so miserable that it could not be described in words. I looked away from him and sighed.When I arrived at the top floor, the attendant opened the door for me. When I entered the representative room, Cheon Sa-yeon, who was sitting on the reception sofa and looking at his tablet PC, greeted me.\u201cWelcome, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dFaced with that bright smile, I frowned as if I had swallowed something bitter.What was this? It was incredibly ominous.\u201cIf you put on that kind of expression as soon as you arrive, I can\u2019t help but feel sad.\u201d\u201cSpeaking nonsense.\u201dI trudged over and sat across from him. Cheon Sa-yeon, who put down his tablet PC, said in a relaxed tone, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you already saw the news.\u201d\u201c\u2026ah, that.\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t, there was still something to be said.\u201cWhat was the reason for the broadcast?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend. You could have stopped it if you wanted to.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon had a strange face. \u201cDid you want me to stop it?\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026 If you were to use me in the future, you should have blocked it.\u201dIn the original novel, in order to do what Cheon Sa-yeon ordered as an independent, Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s face must not have been known. So, I thought that everything broadcast- and media-related would be blocked if possible.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean what do I mean?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon continued with a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing complicated about it. It\u2019s just a waste of time to get rid of trash. An important person has a job worthy of their importance.\u201d\u2026 Since I was more useful than you thought, you decided to use me to the fullest extent*?\u201cSo you decided to sell my face?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see any need to stop them. Since you\u2019re only A-rank, the public can change interests at any time. You don\u2019t have to be sensitive.\u201dThat was funny. If it was Han Yi-gyeol, Cheon Sa-yeon would have done his best to keep him from being known to the public until the end.\u201cThe situation\u2019s become bothersome.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll be quite fun.\u201dI didn\u2019t like it. The \u2018fun\u2019 Cheon Sa-yeon mentioned was far from normal fun, I was very anxious.\u2018More than that, I can\u2019t proceed like in the novel if this happens.\u2019The problem was that there were too many things that had already changed.Had it already changed so much that I didn\u2019t even have time to try following it? I couldn\u2019t measure how wide the margin of error was due to my actions.It was also necessary to find out why the gates in C13 Area burst. It concerned me since the incident did not exist in the original story.I went to check it myself, but there was no information I could find, so it was very frustrating for me.\u201cThere are three gates scheduled to be cleared next week.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon tapped the tablet PC a few times and held it out to me. Three gate photos were floating on the screen.Area C32, Area C18, and Area N42.\u201cThe two gates in Area C are the gates passed over by the Blun Guild, and N42 is our guild gate\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who stopped explaining for a moment, looked at me and said, \u201cIn the case of C32 Area and C18 Area, they are both B-grade, so other guild members are enough. The problem is the N42 Area gate, which is S-grade. The original plan was to send Park Geon-ho, but I changed my mind.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll need to go to the N42 Area gate, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon smiled brightly. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want to.\u201dI groaned and shook my head. You want me to go through a gate again with Cheon Sa-yeon? The things I experienced at the SS-grade gate came to mind like a nightmare.\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair to say no before I\u2019m done explaining?\u201d\u201cOf course not. In the first place, I don\u2019t even belong to this guild.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon did not respond much to the fact that I even presented myself as an independent. He replied with a sour look on his face, \u201cBut I think that it\u2019ll be good if I follow along?\u201d\u201cNo matter what, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to properly check the problem inside the gate?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI frowned and shut my mouth.\u201cWhen I checked the C13 Area gate\u2019s clear record, there was something strange. The last time it was cleared was 58 days ago. For the sake of safety, all guilds use 50 days as the standard, but to be honest, 58 days is not enough for the gate to burst.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you mean there\u2019s a reason?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon blinked leisurely. \u201cThe Blun Guild did one thing wrong: if Kang Seung-geon had followed the 50-day standard, at the very least, the monsters wouldn\u2019t have burst out of the gate.\u201dWell, I didn\u2019t expect much in the first place.Cheon Sa-yeon added seriously, \u201cIt brings up the question if there\u2019s a problem inside the gate that caused the burst after only two months.\u201dI recalled things that had happened before.The gate in the D8 area where I woke up the boss after taking out the SS item with Ha Tae-heon. The C13 area where monsters suddenly burst out. Both were gates that have changed from the original plot.\u201cDo you want to double-check the C13 Area gate?\u201d\u201cC13 has already been cleared since yesterday. Not just C13, but we need to see if other gates have the same problem.\u201dThat was true. If there was a problem with all the gates, we had to check it out as soon as possible and take measures.I sighed and nodded my head. \u201cIf there was a reason for this, it would\u2019ve been nice if you explained it first.\u201d\u201cI wanted to see your reaction.\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon curved his eyes and smiled brightly.So you were still a jerk.\u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d\u201cNext Thursday.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you want just the two of us to go.\u201d\u201cThat would be great, but\u2026\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon shrugged his shoulders as if it were a pity. \u201cBecause it\u2019s been officially scheduled**, we have to fill in the minimum number of people. Let\u2019s move our date to a later time.\u201d\u201cWhat date are you talking about.\u201dJudging from his useless comments, it seemed that the main point was over. I got up from my seat.\u201cI\u2019ll go if we\u2019re done talking.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quick-tempered. I still have something to talk about, so sit down.\u201dWas there anything else we had to decide on? Cheon Sa-yeon gave a deep smile as he looked at me slumping over. Somehow, the atmosphere seemed to have changed a bit.\u201cI have a question for you about the contents of the text.\u201d\u201cText?\u201dWhat\u2019s this all of a sudden? I sat back down on the sofa and tilted my head.\u201cWhat do you mean you brought over Kim Woo-jin?\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dI guess I texted too simply. I scratched the back of my head and briefly explained. \u201cI went to see Kim Woo-jin and I happened to see him being threatened so I helped him\u2026 I beat up his opponent. I thought he was going to take his anger out on Kim Woo-jin, so I brought him to my room. It was difficult to leave him at his home.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cAs you may know, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s abilities are a bit\u2026 like that. From what I\u2019ve heard, he said that he\u2019s suffered from a number of other people besides the one I met. After all, he was helping me, so I said we could live together.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dI tried hard to explain, but Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s reaction was not good. He seemed to not like something.\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like being with other people.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dI was speechless. It\u2019s definitely Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s personality. It doesn\u2019t matter to me because I\u2019ve been living in the midst of people since I was so young.I added hastily, \u201cNow, uh, I think it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible to live with me then.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2026what did this bastard just say? Did I hear it wrong?I rubbed my ears once and asked again, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cLive with me.\u201dFuck off. Feeling goosebumps all over my body, I leaned my back against the back of the sofa. It was an instinctive act of wanting to get away from Cheon Sa-yeon as much as possible.\u201cDon\u2019t say crazy things.\u201d\u201cI was just about to get you a house. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea at all to come to my place.\u201dNow that it has come to this, I was afraid.Why were you like this, Cheon Sa-yeon? You were not like this.\u201cI was very considerate of you because you wanted to be alone, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better. You can come and live in my house right now.\u201d\u201cNo, no! That\u2019s enough. I\u2019m satisfied with my room now\u2026\u201dShaking my head in fright, I noticed that Cheon Sa-yeon was smiling very deeply.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat\u2019s with this motherfucker again?\u201cAre you saying this because you knew I was going to refuse?\u201d\u201cYou got me,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon admitted.I left my seat and got up. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dOf course. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been caught with this kind of prank. What a waste of time.Cheon Sa-yeon held out the papers lying on the table, regardless of my cold gaze.\u201cThis is the gate information for the N42 Area, which we will enter next week. Read it carefully and understand it.\u201dI glared at him and took the documents roughly. Please, let\u2019s not meet again until we enter the gate.\u201cAnd Kim Woo-jin will be given another room, so let him know that.\u201dWell done, really.\u2018Annoying bastard,\u2019 I muttered to myself and left the representative room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKim Woo-jin, who was kicked out of my room by Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s order, had a very depressed face. The room he was assigned to was not the next room or on the same floor, but the room at the end of the hallway on the 24th floor.The interior of the rooms was all the same, but because the building was so big, the distance from the end of the 24th floor to my room was quite far.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin, who packed the luggage he brought from home, looked at me with droopy eyes. He looked like a cat that had been forcibly kicked out of the box he liked and looked so wronged and miserable.\u201cYou still have to go.\u201dUnfortunately, there was nothing I could do for him. The guild owner was Cheon Sa-yeon and the owner of the building was also Cheon Sa-yeon. As long as he lived in the guild, he was in the position to make the decision.\u201cI\u2019m going then\u2026\u201d Kim Woo-jin, who was slowly looking into my eyes, asked with an unsure voice, \u201cCan I come see you again?\u201dYou\u2019d come even if I said no.\u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cMmh.\u201dAs soon as I allowed it, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face brightened in relief.Perhaps because he was thinking of coming to play next time, he did not insist on not going and quietly followed the attendant.\u2018It\u2019ll be quiet for a while.\u2019To be honest, I didn\u2019t feel sorry because there was no difference whether there was Kim Woo-jin or not. I closed the door and returned to my room then lay on the sofa.I closed my eyes and a peaceful stillness came to me. In that state, I calmly organized my thoughts.It was a relief that I was able to deliver the SS-class coat, which was one of my important plans, to Ha Tae-heon safely. Although, it seemed that another problem had arisen in the process.It was also important to find out Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s past or Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s plan, but the urgent thing now was the gate.I needed to solve the gate quickly, so there would be no problems with my future plans.\u2018Let\u2019s check the gate first. Then meet Ha Tae-heon\u2026 Oh, come to think of it, I need to see Park Geon-ho as well.\u2019Why the hell do I have so much work to do? It wasn\u2019t easy to get along with people I couldn\u2019t handle like this.Knock, knock!As I was enjoying my leisure time, I heard a knock on the door.Ah, how annoying. When I got up and opened the door, Kim Woo-jin, who had left earlier, was standing there.\u201cWhat.\u201dWhen I looked at him from speechlessness, Kim Woo-jin proudly said nonsense. \u201cYou said I can come to see you.\u201dThis kid\u2026\u201cHasn\u2019t it been less than 30 minutes since you left?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do in my room.\u201d\u201cDo you own my room?\u201dKim Woo-jin slumped his shoulders again as I stood in the way of the entrance.So what do you want? I stared at him without paying any attention, even his pointy eyes drooped and he began to murmur. \u201cYou said I could come. You cheated me.\u201dOh my God.\u201cYou cheating bastard\u2026 Be honest with me. You hate me, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you keep your distance\u2026\u201d\u201cHaah.\u201dWhy don\u2019t you write novels. You should write novels*. You\u2019re not even an elementary school student, so why would you say that?I let out a deep sigh and turned away.\u201cI\u2019ll let you in, so don\u2019t go anywhere and say that\u2026\u201d\u201cMh.\u201dKim Woo-jin entered the room and went to the kitchen with a smile. Did you like it that much?\u201cWhy go to the refrigerator?\u201d\u201cWe should eat dinner.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it five o\u2019clock now?\u201d\u201cThen snacks?\u201dDid you get possessed by a ghost around food or something? Lying on the sofa like an uncle on a holiday, I said, \u201cForget it. I\u2019m not going to eat.\u201d\u201cNo, you have to eat. You\u2019re too skinny.\u201dMh. I agreed with that.Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body was thin and weak. Even though I wasn\u2019t the type to eat much, even I thought I was getting thinner than before.Should I try to exercise anyway? Even if nothing happened, there was nothing wrong with diet and exercise.Since I had a strong weapon called an ability, my physical state was a little wretched. Anyway, there wasn\u2019t much that needed to be fought in close combat.\u201cLook at this. You barely have any ankles.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was sitting on the sofa like me, grabbed my ankle. Startled by the sensation of being touched where I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be touched, I looked down.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand completely wrapped around my ankle. That was how big his hands were.\u2018Is this revenge?\u2019Like the\u00a0since you touched my ankle while taping it, I\u2019ll do the same to you\u00a0sort of revenge.\u201cEven if I eat a bit more, my ankles and wrists stay thin.\u201d\u201cStill.\u201dKim Woo-jin lowered his gaze and looked at my legs. His hand, which had been wrapped around my ankle, gradually moved upward. The hand reached into my pants and gently caressed my calf.\u201cWould you like a massage?\u201dI guess it wasn\u2019t revenge. It was just pure favour.\u201c\u2026do you know how to?\u201dThat was suspicious. Kim Woo-jin nodded his head and pulled my body slightly.\u201cNo, wait\u2026\u201dThe hand on the underside of my calf began to gently caress my skin. His hand, which had been stroking my calf several times, went straight up and pressed the back of my knee firmly. My legs trembled reflexively.\u201cHey, stop it.\u201dHis long fingers slowly moved toward my thighs. My loose pants were already up to my knees, revealing pure white calves. I frowned at a strange sensation for a simple massage.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand, stroking my half-open calf, passed my ankle and wrapped around under my ankle bone. As one of my legs was draped over Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder, my position became so strange that it was hard to explain in words.\u201c\u2026Kim Woo-jin.\u201d I called out Kim Woo-jin, who was completely focused on the other leg.\u201cLet go before I kick you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin was in conflict for a while and slowly released my ankle.Come to think of it, Kim Woo-jin had already been kicked once. It must have been quite painful because I kicked him hard, but I think he remembered the pain.\u201cI haven\u2019t done the other side yet.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need you to.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had a regretful expression on his face, pushed my foot to the other side and got up. This guy didn\u2019t even let others lie down.Were you bored? I\u2019d heard that cats and dogs bothered their owners when they were bored. I thought it would be better to make him do something else.\u201cKim Woo-jin, go and cook. Just eat quickly and clean up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon hearing my words, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s expression was not very good. He turned his head away from me with a cold face. Was this not the right answer?\u201cNo\u2026 If you don\u2019t want to, then don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI will. You have to be fed.\u201dI wasn\u2019t going to starve if you didn\u2019t cook. There was an option to order food.But before I could stop him, Kim Woo-jin slipped into the kitchen. I didn\u2019t know what to do.Kim Woo-jin, who was sulking while preparing food, quickly blushed and grinned when I complimented him several times that it was delicious. He was such a simple man.* * *\u201cHey.\u201dIt had been peaceful since then. I spent time reading the gate data I received from Cheon Sa-yeon or watching TV, and Kim Woo-jin was by my side no matter what he did. Everything was fine until then. It was okay.\u201cAren\u2019t you going?\u201dKim Woo-jin did not think of going back to his room after 11 pm and almost 12 o\u2019clock in the evening. He pouted his lips as if he was offended by my words again.\u201cDo you want me to go back?\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d I said while turning off the TV with the remote control. \u201cGo and sleep. I\u2019m going to sleep now.\u201d\u201cI want to sleep here.\u201dHe was saying something weird again.\u201cWhy are you sleeping here when you have a good bed in your room?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay because the sofa is big.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and get out.\u201d\u201cJust for today!\u201dKim Woo-jin shouted as he grabbed the armrest of the sofa. I was thinking about using my abilities to kick him out, but he made a very sad expression as if I had done something wrong.\u201cI cooked for you! You said it was delicious. Are you going to use me as much as you can and then kick me out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI crossed my arms and sighed. Fine, do as you please.\u201cOkay, but starting tomorrow, don\u2019t be stubborn and go back to your room.\u201d\u201cMh.\u201dIn the end, it was the same. Was there a point in having separate rooms, then?However, despite my permission, Kim Woo-jin could not achieve what he wanted. After 12 o\u2019clock, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s attendants came to my room and they dragged him away without a blink of an eye despite Kim Woo-jin\u2019s rebellion.I quietly nodded when the attendant told me not to worry that they were just taking him to his room. Kim Woo-jin looked at me as if I was a traitor, but I couldn\u2019t help it. As I said before, the owner of this building was Cheon Sa-yeon.* * *As time passed by, the promised Thursday came and the attendant came to see me. After painstakingly removing Kim Woo-jin, who was acting like he was going to go too, I went down to the entrance of the guild building where Cheon Sa-yeon welcomed me.\u201cLong time no see, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cI saw you last week.\u201dWhat \u2018long time.\u2019 Cheon Sa-yeon opened the car door and said softly, \u201cThat\u2019s a shame to say. I\u2019ve missed you every day.\u201d\u201cYou must have been busy making plans for how you\u2019re going to work it out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sharp.\u201dWhen I got into the car, Cheon Sa-yeon sat down next to me and closed the car door.\u201cDid you read the gate information?\u201d\u201cTo some extent.\u201d\u201cAsk me if you have any questions. I\u2019ll let you know with all of my heart.\u201d\u201cThank you, but I will politely decline.\u201d\u201cToo bad.\u201dThe car moved. Cheon Sa-yeon, who had not spoken for a moment while looking out the window, looked back at me and said, \u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI think you and I have built up some trust, but what do you think?\u201dWhat was he saying now?I asked with all of my heart, \u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cWhat can\u2019t be done? I understand that there are other issues that are hidden from each other, but isn\u2019t it different when it comes to gates? I think we could have a very good partnership.\u201d\u201cCheon Sa-yeon.\u201d Not hiding my irritation, I asked sharply, \u201cIf it were you, would you trust a guy who grabbed your dead sister and threatened you? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to trust a passing dog?\u201dAs if surprised, Cheon Sa-yeon opened his eyes slightly wide and then tilted his head.\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected. Do you care about that?\u201d\u201cWell, obviously\u2014\u201d\u201cYou and I would be the same in that regard,\u201d Cheon Sa-yeon said in a soft voice.\u201cDidn\u2019t you keep pretending not to know even after you knew that your sister was dead? To make use of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I decided to think that you don\u2019t really care about your sister\u2019s death. Am I wrong?\u201dIt was then that I realized why he could offer cooperation so easily. Cheon Sa-yeon was making sure that I was not obsessed with my younger sister.However, he suspected that I had changed from the moment I wanted an item that wasn\u2019t my sister in return, so it was a natural result.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon.\u201dHowever.\u201cThat may be true.\u201dEven so.\u201cBut you\u2019re not in the position to say that, are you?\u201dFor some reason, it was hard to hold back what I kept to my chest.No, how could someone who just came to this world be the same as her real brother? Of course, it was true that I was a complete stranger to his sister, but at least I didn\u2019t talk about Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s younger sister recklessly.\u201c\u2026I guess. I made a mistake.\u201dHe, who quietly listened to me, meekly admitted his mistake. With a subtle expression, Cheon Sa-yeon tapped on his knee and opened his mouth again after a moment of silence.\u201cSo, what about the gate?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to be swayed by emotions in a situation like this? Do you need my help to figure out the gate problem?\u201dThis guy and that guy were persistent. I sighed and answered, \u201cGate only.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled contentedly as if he liked my answer.There was nothing I could do. I had some responsibility for the gate\u2026 It was too good to refuse if I gave it to Cheon Sa-yeon, so I could quickly grasp the situation.\u201cNow that we\u2019re in a partnership, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re ready to be bossed around, Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201d\u201cSure. I am very much looking forward to it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s arrived!\u201d\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon!\u201dAs soon as the car entered the gate entrance, reporters flocked in like a flood. While the bodyguard, who was rushed in, stopped the reporters, I and Cheon Sa-yeon got out of the car and moved to the place where the guild members were.\u201cMaster.\u201dAmong the guild members, the tallest and most muscular man greeted Cheon Sa-yeon politely. Like the bodyguard, the man in a black suit stood out with his neatly raised pomade hair and a hard expression.\u201cHow many people?\u201d\u201cAll in the list attended without missing a beat.\u201dThe man who answered the question as if he was waiting for it, then looked at me.\u201cAh. Come to think of it, this must be the first time you two enter the gate together.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was looking back at me and the man alternately, pulled my shoulder lightly.\u201cThis is Han Yi-gyeol. He\u2019s an independent, but he\u2019s a great mercenary who came to help clear the gate.\u201dIt would be nice to introduce me myself, but what\u2019s with this ambiguous posture?\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Woo Seo-hyuk (\uc6b0\uc11c\ud601), who is working as the master\u2019s secretary.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 nice to meet you.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk calmly shook hands with me without any change in expression, whether this situation was awkward or not.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk stayed in Japan for two months on my order and arrived the day before yesterday. Since it is an S-grade, he will be of great help in this gate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201dThis is Woo Seo-hyuk. I kept an awkward smile and thought of the content of the novel in my head.\u2018I think he was mentioned. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a very important person, given that I don\u2019t remember much about him.\u2019He seemed to be a character who had no contact with the main character, Ha Tae-heon. Apparently, due to the nature of the novel, I remember the meeting with the women, while with the men made me confused because they didn\u2019t have enough footage.\u201cCome on, then.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who put his arm on my shoulder, said to me in a voice full of laughter.\u201cOnce you\u2019re ready, you should have an interview before you go in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhy are you looking at me\u2026 hold on.\u201cLet me go.\u201dSensing the ominous feeling, I groaned to shake off Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arm, but to no avail.\u201cNow that your face has been revealed, you don\u2019t even do an interview.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dBecause of Woo Seo-hyeok standing in front of me, I was forced to use respectful words, so it was like death. I refused while putting down the abusive language that reached the end of my neck, but Cheon Sa-yeon did not even pretend to listen and grabbed me in front of the camera.\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon!\u201d\u201cPlease look this way, Requiem Master!\u201dWhen Cheon Sa-yeon appeared in the interview zone that had been prepared in advance, the waiting camera flashed randomly as if waiting.I was overwhelmed when I saw the white light that filled my eyes and the reporters who were so excited and pointed their microphones in.\u201cThank you for coming. The clearing gate of the N42 Area, which starts today, will be held for four days, and a total of 12 people including myself will depart.\u201dContrary to me, Cheon Sa-yeon skillfully started the interview with his unique smile. He didn\u2019t even blink an eye even with the flash that went off right in front of his face.\u201cWho are the people?\u201d\u201c5 close team, 4 long-distance team, 2 healers, 1 measure man.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason to take the measuring ability to the gate that has already been measured?\u201d\u201cIn order to judge the gate more accurately.\u201d\u201cIs there a benefit to taking more measurements?\u201d\u201cIn terms of stability, I think at least three measurements are necessary.\u201dI glanced at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s eyes.He took the person with the measuring ability probably to check if there had been any change inside the gate. Not a bad way.\u2018The gate I went into with Ha Tae-heon was also a B-grade, but an S+-grade monster appeared.\u2019There is no guarantee that this will not happen again. It was fortunate that the people who entered the gate were me and Ha Tae-heon, but if an S+-grade monster appeared in front of a clear team made up of general guild members, a catastrophe would occur.\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon. Who\u2019s the man standing with you?\u201dThinking seriously about the monster, I shivered at the next question. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was close to me, noticed that I was surprised, so he smiled gently and said softly.\u201cThis person is an A-rank independent talent and he\u2019s on this clearing gate schedule. He has a very special relationship with me.\u201d\u201cHa. Ha\u2026 ha\u2026\u201dI laughed, forcefully raised the corners of my lips. Cheon Sa-yeon, you son of bitch.\u201cI thought you looked familiar, but you were that A-rank person who worked with Master Cheon Sa-yeon in the C13 Area!\u201d\u201cCan you tell me your name, please?\u201d\u201cLook over here, please! I\u2019ll just take one picture!\u201d\u201cOh, uh\u2026 I mean, I am Han Yi-gyeol, and I\u2014\u201dA cold sweat formed on my forehead. I\u2019ve never dreamed of having an experience like this in my life. I thought it would have been much better to have a fight with a weapon.\u201cOh, my.\u201dAs I stuttered foolishly in embarrassment, Cheon Sa-yeon stepped in between me and the camera.\u201cIt seems that our Yi-gyeol is not used to this, so he was very surprised. Let the interview end here.\u201dAre you crazy?\u201cWhat did you just say\u2026 Master Cheon Sa-yeon!\u201d\u201cMaster! Wait!\u201dClick! Click! Click!The camera shutter became even noisier. Attendants, who were waiting to stop reporters calling for Cheon Sa-yeon, rushed to the scene.What a terrible experience. After leaving the reporters behind, I left the interview zone and grabbed my trembling chest while muttering softly.\u201cYou idiot bastard it became like that\u2026\u201d\u201cNow you know that?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon answered with a funny voice and took out a jacket and a sword from his inventory.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving soon.\u201dCheon Saa-yeon took the lead, followed by Woo Seo-hyuk. Looking at the gate shimmering in the light of chaos, Cheon Sa-yeon tapped the ground with his sword a couple of times and walked into it without hesitation.I also pushed myself into the gate entrance after Cheon Sa-yeon. For a moment, the cold air wrapped around my body, I felt the moist, unpleasant air at the tip of my nose.\u201cUnderground prison?\u201d\u201cExactly an underground dungeon.\u201dThere was the sound of chains being pulled from somewhere, a gloomy and heavy atmosphere weighed on my shoulders. A small torch on the wall was the only light and I could see insects and centipedes crawling here and there.\u201cIf you fall behind, you\u2019re dead.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon said, grabbing my wrist as I looked around.\u201cBe careful not to fall.\u201d\u201cAh, seriously. Stop\u2026\u201dWhen I was about to say something because I was annoyed by the constant pulling, my eyes met with Woo Seo-hyuk, who was standing next to me. Damn it.\u201c\u2026all right, Master. I\u2019ll stick with you~\u201d\u201cKeuk.\u201dWhen I spoke with a forceful eyebrow, Cheon Sa-yeon turned his head and burst into laughter. Are you having fun, you bastard?When all the guild members arrived inside the gate, Cheon Sa-yeon began to move slowly. As stated in the material given by Cheon Sa-yeon, it usually took three days to clear. It was said that the schedule itself was set up for three days in order to look around slowly.\u201cThis is the first room.\u201dChwareureureuk!When Cheon Sa-yeon pressed on a particular wall, the rusty iron bars that blocked the front went up with the sound of a chain wind. The iron bar automatically descended after a certain period of time, so once you entered, you couldn\u2019t go back.Dozens of coffins were placed in a large room with soft candles flickering. The scenery inside the room filled with dusty coffins was horrifying.\u201cKim Ji-hoon (\uae40\uc9c0\ud6c8), Park Yoo-jun (\ubc15\uc720\uc900).\u201dA guild member standing behind came running to Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s call. Among them, Kim Ji-hoon was somehow familiar and he was one of the close team that cleared the SS-grade gate.\u201cCount the number of mimics (\ubbf8\ubbf9). Check if it\u2019s less or more than 47.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dKim Ji-hoon and Park Yoo-jun, each with their weapons out, began to examine the coffin. The two of them carefully counted the number of coffins and then they came back.\u201c47 confirmed.\u201d\u201cNo change in numbers.\u201d\u201cTake care of it.\u201dAs soon as the report was over, Cheon Sa-yeon put his sword in the centre of the coffin next to him.\u00a0Puhak, bright red blood spurted out.Kkieeek!Mimic struggled and opened its mouth. Through the black aura, large teeth resembling human teeth were visible.Kieeek! Kkieeek!Mimic\u2019s screams, which were attacked by guild members, were heard everywhere. Mimic was a B-grade, doppelganger-type monster that disguises itself as an object and devoured opponents who approached it.Since there were so many mimics, it took time to process them one by one. Unable to pierce through a solid coffin without any special weapon, I stood quietly. So did Woo Seo-hyuk.\u2018What is your ability?\u2019Except in special cases, most abilities used weapons. That was why it was rather rare that there were no weapons.Woo Seo-hyuk, who was empty-handed like me, looked only forward with no expression. As the curiosity about his abilities grew, the waiting of mimic processing was over.Across the room to the end, another rusty iron bar was blocking the way to the next room. Unlike before, Cheon Sa-yeon stepped on a part of the floor pattern this time.Kugugung, chwareureuk!The door opened as if waiting. Is there a sign somewhere? The location of the hidden device wasn\u2019t even listed in the data.\u201cDid you memorize all the locations?\u201d\u201cThere are a total of 15 devices per room. One of them is random.\u201d\u201cRandom?\u201dIn other words, to open a room, you have to find the right device with a 15 to 1 chance.\u201cYou just succeeded once. The same as before.\u201d\u201cI was lucky.\u201dI frowned at the firm answer. Aside from the insincere answer, what is this kind of attitude?\u2018It seems like he\u2019s like that every time he walks into the gate?\u2019Perhaps this was one of the \u2018hidden things\u2019 that Cheon Sa-yeon talking about.The second room, as shown in the data, was a human-type A-grade monster, a ghoul (\uad6c\uc6b8). As we entered the room, the monsters lying like corpses opened their eyes at once and stood up.Geueueuk, geuoook.Although they looked like zombies, ghouls had a much stronger body and better reflexes. Being hungry all the time, it was quite violent and it distinguished enemies by its excellent sense of smell.Geuaaak!The spear was stuck in the ghoul\u2019s heart which was running with its mouth wide open towards the healer who was nearby. In order to deal with the ghouls coming from all directions, the guild members, who stood by the healers and the measuring ability, immediately started fighting.Cheon Sa-yeon, who dug through the gaps of the gathered ghouls, skillfully swung his sword without even using his ability. After confirming Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s safety, I blew a blade-shaped wind at the ghoul who was aiming for the back of the guild member.\u201cUgh!\u201dBelatedly, I noticed the sharp claws of the ghoul aiming at my side as I paid attention to others. As I hurriedly pulled myself back and went up into the air, the ghoul cried loudly. Fortunately, only the clothes were torn, but there were no injuries.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi!\u201dOops. As I flew up, the ghouls flocked to Woo Seo-hyuk, who was next to me. That was when I was in a hurry to use my powers on him.\u201cCrazy.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk suddenly started taking off his clothes! For a moment, I was so flustered that the flow of energy was almost cut off. I managed to lift my falling body again and looked at Woo Seo-hyuk with trembling eyes.\u2018N, no. Why the hell\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t even care about the upcoming ghouls and Woo Seo-hyuk calmly took it off, layer by layer. He took off his black suit jacket, untied his tie, and unbuttoned his shirt. Surprisingly, the other guild members in battle did not even care about Woo Seo-hyuk.Woo Seo-hyuk, who finally took off his shirt and held it in his hand, looked at the ghoul in front of him. The ghouls, who were over 2 meters tall, smelled Woo Seo-hyuk and ran excitedly.Woo Seo-hyuk raised his other hand which not held his clothes. The entire arm, which was full of strong muscles, gradually began to turn black. I was mesmerized by the shocking sight.Udeudeuk, udeuk.The sound of bones hitting Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s arm was heard and his black arm began to grow bigger. His palms were filled with flesh and thickened, and his long stretched nails looked hard and sharp even at a glance.Woo Seo-hyuk swung his arms around the ghoul without hesitation, with an arm in a shape that could hardly be considered human.Kwajijik!The two ghouls couldn\u2019t even scream and their upper body was torn apart. Not only did it burn, but the wall behind it was dented in the shape of a nail.After watching all of that, I put on a tired expression on my face.What the hell is that, shit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe processing ghoul was quickly finished. Originally, the number wasn\u2019t that many and there was no reason for it to take long as four or five ghouls died every time Woo Seo-hyuk swung his arm.I came down from the air and stood in front of Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi. That arm\u2026 is that your ability?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen it was confirmed that the ghouls were all dealt with, Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s arm returned to normal.The exposed muscles of the upper body were no joke. Thick shoulders, chest, and clear abs. I looked at the perfect inverted triangle body with envious eyes.That\u2019s the kind of bones he was born with. It was not a body that could never be built with a little bit of exercise. I was sure it must be because of S-rank. Come to think about it, the people around me were all in good shape.\u201cThen Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s will be pierced, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dStartled hearing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words from behind, I came to my senses. As soon as I took my gaze away from Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s body, he opened his mouth, who was standing still.\u201cCan I get dressed now?\u201d\u201cAh, ahem. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re in good shape, so I don\u2019t know.\u201dI politely apologized and backed away in case I was seen as a pervert. Fortunately, Woo Seo-hyuk started wearing the shirt with a face that he didn\u2019t care too much about it.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that a man\u2019s body would be your cup of tea.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon said in a teasing tone, shaking off the blood that stained his sword.\u201cEu, are you crazy? I didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201dI answered with sincerity.\u201cYeah, of course, it\u2019s great that he managed to get to that level.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t as good as Han Yi-gyeol, but I wasn\u2019t the type to get muscles well. I tried twice as hard as others to build my muscles, but in the end, I failed to achieve the desired level of the body.I was pretty depressed back then. Thinking about it now, it wasn\u2019t as bad as Woo Seo-hyuk, but I think I set my ideal too high.\u201cA-rank and above are usually more developed than ordinary people. Everyone is in good shape even if they don\u2019t take care of their bodies.\u201d\u201c\u2026I am also an A-rank.\u201d\u201cThat. Let me cheer you on.\u201dYou punk.\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cI think you need to gain some weight before building muscle.\u201d\u201cStill, I eat well these days.\u201dIt was thanks to Kim Woo-jin who took care of three meals a day. Even the menu changed every day, so the satisfaction was very high.Anyway, let\u2019s stop chatting here.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi, what is your ability? It seems I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI tell you (\uadf8\ub7f4 \uac70\uc57c). It\u2019s an ability that is hard to forget once you see it.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, wearing a shirt, pulled out of his pocket something similar to a cell phone. When he tapped the screen, the suit jacket and tie he was holding disappeared. I think it\u2019s an inventory item.Woo Seo-hyuk looked at me and calmly explained.\u201cI can transform my body into a certain shape. In my case, it is a wolf.\u201dAha. I nodded my head. Somehow, when he changed, I thought it looked like an animal\u2019s foot, but it turned out to be a wolf.\u201cCan you change completely?\u201d\u201cThe whole thing is quite large, so it\u2019s difficult in a place like this.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHe certainly had to take off his clothes. If his body grew big that much, he wouldn\u2019t be left with anything he wore. That would be inconvenient too.\u201cMaster.\u201dA person with a measuring ability who looked around the room approached Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cThere are no major problems, but the grades have changed a bit.\u201d\u201cTo what extent?\u201d\u201cWhen I first came, the grade was 12.89% of grade A and now it is more than 57%.\u201dWhen the rank value exceeded 100%, the monster\u2019s grade would go up. The person with a measuring ability lowered his voice and asked.\u201cShall we continue to find out?\u201d\u201cWe have to. We\u2019ll measure the next room.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who sent off a person with a measuring ability, looked at me. I said, making eye contact with him.\u201cThat\u2019s not particularly good news.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find out more, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s never happened before.\u201dSince Woo Seo-hyuk was listening next to me, I couldn\u2019t go into more detail. Cheon Sa-yeon found a device to open the iron bars at once again.Chwareureuk, thud!The next room appeared in front of me. Not a single candle was seen in this room. A white body swayed through the pitch-black darkness that could not even see an inch ahead.\u201cSpectre (\uc2a4\ud399\ud130).\u201dSpectre from ORV (just let you know)I remembered the name I saw in the data. A bizarre cry echoed through the room as if in response to my whisper.Kkiiiii\u2014Gigik, gik\u2014Whoops, a creepy energy came rushing into the entrance. Something felt strange.\u201c\u2026wait, this is.\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dBlack smoke crawled slowly towards us like snakes. A person with a measuring ability who noticed the strangeness similar to me shouted to Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cThe, the grade!\u201dHaa, the air surrounding him froze cold and white breath scattered. Due to the sudden drop in temperature, the guild members instinctively took a step back. A feeling of fear rising from the toes.\u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who passed me forward and raised a sword with a cold expression.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough that the Spectre, which should have been an A-grade, became an S-grade, but the number has increased.\u201dChwareureureuk! Kuung!At the same time as Cheon Sa-yeon cut off his palm with his sword, the door that was open behind his back closed tightly.Syaaaa\u2014Kkiii\u2014kkii\u2014As the blood flowing through the sword turned into fire, the Spectre who had been hiding in the darkness was revealed. The black cloth that was constantly swaying flew like smoke, the hands beneath it were too long and sharp, and there was nothing visible on the face except the long torn mouth.\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s only the third room, what kind of S-grade is coming out?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Spectre Grade A? It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201dThe guild members raised their weapons with tense faces. Twenty spectres, which were over 5m tall, flew in quickly with their mouths open.Kkiaaaa\u2014!Kkiiiik! Kkiii!A bright red fire flew through the darkness, cutting the Spectre at the forefront. In the meantime, the guild members in line also began to attack the Spectre who was rushing to them intensively.Kwadeudeuk!Woo Seo-hyuk, whose arms had changed, jumped up aiming at Spectre\u2019s head. I raised my ability to support Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s body, and at the same time, wrapped around Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body who wielded a sword. As the energy escaped on both sides, the bracelet I was wearing vibrated slightly, and the jewels sparkled.\u201cNot bad.\u201dSince it was not just one-time support, Cheon Sa-yeon immediately noticed my ability and began to utilize it. He swung the sword flexibly between the spectres as if dancing.On the other hand, Woo Seo-hyuk struggled a few times as if the body floating in the air was unfamiliar, but after killing a spectre, he expanded the range of movement a little more to get used to it. Woo Seo-hyuk leapt up the wall with agile movements, grabbed Spectre\u2019s arm, and shoved his fingernail into its mouth. Spectre howled, pouring out black blood.\u201cPhew.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon and Woo Seo-hyuk, who had no movement restrictions thanks to my abilities, ran wildly. A bright red light burned in the spot where Cheon Sa-yeon passed and clear claw marks were left near Woo Seo-hyuk. I was worried about 20 S-grade Spectres for a while, but this was a pretty good situation.Kkiiiiik, kkiiik\u2014Seuaaak\u2014\u2018One, two, three\u2026 fourteen. Fifteen.\u2019I frowned as I counted the number of Spectre corpses that fell to the floor.\u201cWe\u2019re done dealing with one spectre!\u201dOne more that the guild members just dealt with it. Cheon Sa-yeon and Woo Seo-hyuk were facing three. So there were nineteen in total.The other one\u2026The moment I thought about it, I got goosebumps all over my body. I instinctively threw myself back and spread the wind like a shield.Kkiiiiik\u2014!Along with the bizarre Spectre\u2019s cries, a burning pain flashed through my mind. Spectre\u2019s long, spider-like hands pierced the windshield and brushed my shoulders and arms. Black smoke spread like poison over the deep wound.\u201cKeueuk!\u201dIf I hadn\u2019t avoided it while delaying the attack with my ability, my shoulder would have been torn off. I used my ability to escape, but the energy was unstable and did not activate. My body, which had been hurriedly raised, staggered without being able to focus as if paralyzed.Syaaaak\u2014Spectre opened its mouth and ran towards me at high speed. As I was preparing to dodge sideways in time, someone stepped in front of me.Kwajik!It was Woo Seo-hyuk who grabbed Spectre\u2019s arm and broke it. The screaming Spectre looked blurry. The body that had barely endured could not focus and lean to the side.\u201cOh, my.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon caught me as I collapsed helplessly. I forced my eyes to open and told him.\u201cTh, this\u2026 seems like poison\u2026\u201d\u201cOriginally, it doesn\u2019t have the poison. Since it went from A-grade to S-grade, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had at least one of those abilities.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was holding me gently, said in a voice full of laughter.\u201cI\u2019m so careless. From now on, I will always fight with you in my arms.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense\u2026\u201dHow could an A-rank deal with S-grade monsters? If I had known this would happen, I would have been hiding among the guild members. Spectre was dealing with Cheon Sa-yeon and Woo Seo-hyuk, so I thought it wouldn\u2019t be able to come to me.The healers who ran after hearing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s call looked at my condition and put on a perplexed face.\u201cIt\u2019s an S-grade monster\u2019s attack and there\u2019s poison on it, so I think it\u2019s going to take some time to heal completely.\u201dThe healers who participated in this clearing gate were both B-rank. Min Ah-rin was away on vacation, and there was also a sudden gate in Area C that she suddenly took over, so two B-ranks were the best. In other words, there is a shortage of manpower.\u201cHe will rest in this room. Treated him as much as you can.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon gently laid me down. Two healers quickly removed my clothes and checked the wounds.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi? Calm down.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, I will push the poison away, but it\u2019s going to be a little painful. Can you stand it?\u201d\u201c\u2026huu, yes.\u201dI responded by holding back a groan as the hand touched the wound. Soon after, a pure white light erupted from the healer\u2019s hand that covered the wound and terrible pain poured in.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dMy body swelled up. It was like a fire burning a wound. Something shoved into my mouth, which was tightly closed to avoid screaming. Huh, ugh, exhaling a rough breath, looking up, there was Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to bite it.\u201dBefore I could answer, a white light flashed again, and an unbearable sensation struck in. Ugh, my head tilted back and bit Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s finger strongly that had entered my mouth. My face was wet with cold sweat and tears mixed together. My body trembled uncontrollably.\u201cI will do it one last time. You can\u2019t lose your mind.\u201dHealer, who had exhausted a lot of energy to push out the poison, said in a tired voice.I wanted to refuse treatment right away, but I forcibly closed my eyes and nodded my head.I could feel the faint taste of blood in my mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t ask for more from healers who had reached their limit just by getting rid of the poison.\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself. Thank you for your treatment.\u201dI reached out a bandage from the bewildered healer. Then the healer looked sorry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve awakened as a healer, so I haven\u2019t learned much yet.\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d\u2026lack of manpower.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You two should go and rest.\u201dWhen the healers left, Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been away for a while, returned. Seeing the bandage in my hand, Cheon Sa-yeon raised his eyebrows.\u201cUse this instead of that.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who took an ordinary bandage from my hand, took another bandage out of his inventory. As I looked at the bandage, I felt a sense of energy.\u201cA-class bandages you mentioned last time?\u201d\u201cThis would help stop the bleeding if the wound opened in the middle.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who had taken the bandage off his hand, wrapped a bandage around my shoulder and arm with skilful hand movements.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon, your hand\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind it.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s finger was injured as expected. It was because I chewed as much as I could to endure the pain.At least, he has an SS-rank body. If it had been an ordinary person\u2019s finger, it would have been seriously injured.\u201cIt\u2019s an A-grade gate, and I also include Woo Seo-hyuk in, so I purposely assigned a talent healer to another clearing team.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s gaze turned to my shoulder.\u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong choice.\u201d\u201cI just let my guard down.\u201dAfter putting all the bandages on and changing into a new shirt, I asked quietly after confirming that there were no hearing ears around.\u201cDid you find out the cause?\u201d\u201cAccording to the report of the measuring ability, the grade level has increased abnormally. Other than that, nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat is the current S-grade level?\u201d\u201c31.2%. Previously, 24.6% of grade A.\u201dIt meant that it had risen from 24.6% of A-grade to 31.2% of S-grade.\u201cWith that much difference, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna make it SS-grade.\u201d\u201cThe S+ is well worth considering.\u201dWhen I said that, Woo Seo-hyuk approached me.\u201cAre you okay with your injuries?\u201d\u201cYeah, that would have been dangerous, but thank you for your help.\u201dI thanked Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cNo, more than that\u2026\u201dIn a brief moment, Woo Seo-hyuk, who looked at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s eyes, continued.\u201cI was able to fly during battle. Is it Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s ability?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s because I have wind ability. Did you feel uncomfortable?\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk shook his head.\u201cThanks to you, I was able to deal with monsters easily. It\u2019s amazing to be able to use the wind in that way.\u201d\u201cA-rank does not work well against S-rank opponents. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do anyway.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk was silent for a moment at my words. He looked at me with somewhat complicated eyes and then opened his mouth.\u201cI knew it when I saw the news, but to be honest, when I received it in person, I was surprised that it was much better than I thought.\u201dIf you saw the news, you\u2019re referring to the footage in Area C13. Even thinking about it again made me sick. I glanced at Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cIt may sound like too much interference, but how about refraining from using your ability on others in the future?\u201d\u201cOthers, does it include Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi?\u201d\u201cI have already experienced it, so it is an exception.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t see this guy like that, but he\u2019s surprisingly shameless.Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been quietly listening to Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s conversation with me, intervened.\u201cI agree with that.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I have such a great ability to worry about that.\u201d\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel that special if you just look at it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different when you take it yourself.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon spoke softly like an adult.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. You need to understand the rarity of your ability. Do you know how much most talented people covet the ability to fly?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, most monsters have flying abilities from Grade A or higher. It can only be cumbersome from the point of view of the talented.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that with my help, you have a lot less to worry about?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. There are no restrictions on movement.\u201dI understood the explanation, but it didn\u2019t really make sense to me. Maybe it was because I didn\u2019t have any experience dealing with monsters without the wind ability.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have low-ranking abilities, but if you\u2019re high-ranked, you will be very interested in Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s abilities. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to bring any good results.\u201dI pondered for a moment at Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s explanation then nodded. Physically, talented people were basically militant, and the higher their rank, the stronger their tendencies, so there was nothing wrong with being careful.\u201cI know what you mean.\u201dUp until now, I had only thought of helping, but I had not thought about how the other person would receive it.First of all, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever meet a person with a high level of ability, however. As soon as I meekly agreed, Cheon Sa-yeon rose from his seat.\u201cI\u2019ll call it a day. You will have to move with an injured body starting tomorrow.\u201dI nodded and leaned my back against the wall. I was very tired because I struggled quite a bit to get the poison out of my body.* * *Still, it was because I had been treated by a healer and had a good bandage wrapped around it, so when I woke up, my condition was much better than I expected. As soon as I finished breakfast, I was told that it was okay by the healers who checked my wounds, I was greatly relieved.\u201cI\u2019m still not strong enough. It\u2019s a little difficult right now and I think it will be possible to treat in the evening.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dWhen I smiled and nodded, the healers also smiled at each other. They are good people.After having a friendly time with the healers, Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been waiting early, looked back at me when I came forward to move.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201dI kept feeling a throbbing, mild, dull pain, but not hurt enough to take painkillers. Cheon Sa-yeon, who looked at me with an unknown expression, said as if it was very unexpected.\u201cYou\u2019ve become friends with the healers.\u201d\u201c\u2026why are you asking that again?\u201dMy face hardened as I remembered being asked if I was close with Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin. As if expecting this kind of reaction from me, Cheon Sa-yeon shrugged his shoulders and answered skillfully.\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re more popular than I thought.\u201dIs that a compliment or a curse?\u201cStop talking nonsense and let\u2019s go.\u201dWhen I spoke coldly, I found a device that gently opened the door to see Cheon Sa-yeon was talking about it seriously (the random key to enter the rooms like Sa-yeon said in the previous chapter). As expected, this time it was a success as well.\u201cIs this random? No matter how I look at it, it doesn\u2019t seem like that.\u201d\u201cI wish you could trust me a little more.\u201d\u201cYou are too greedy.\u201dChwareureuk, kung!Fortunately, I did not feel the S-grade energy in the next room. As we entered the room, a number of bats hanging from the ceiling roared and rushed towards us.B-grade monster. It was a vampire bat (\ud761\ud608\ubc15\uc950\uc600\ub2e4).The guild members were excited about the first B-grade they encountered after entering the room. Before I, Cheon Sa-yeon, and Woo Seo-hyuk could even step out, the bats were attacked by guild members and fell to the ground like rainwater. A person with a measuring ability who finished the measurement by running hard in the meantime approached Cheon Sa-yeon and reported it.\u201cThe grade B monster was 78.9%. The previous one was 31.44%.\u201d\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s up.\u201d\u201cThe rate of increase is too fast.\u201dThat\u2019s 78.9%. If we had come in a little later, we would have dealt with an A-grade vampire bat.\u201cHey, Master.\u201dThe person with the ability to measure made an anxious face.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, right? The numbers keep getting weird\u2026\u201d\u201cIf we check the rest of the rooms, it will become clear. You don\u2019t have to worry too much. No matter what level monsters appear, I\u2019ll make sure we will all be able to get out of here safely.\u201dAt Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s relax reply, the person with the ability to measure breathed a sigh of relief. I opened my mouth as I watched the person with the ability to measure leave.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? End it like that.\u201dAfter I said it, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I forgot that Woo Seo-hyuk was by my side and talked comfortably, so I noticed it late and felt guilty.\u201cAs the Master, I have to do this.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled with his eyes bent.\u201cI\u2019ve been a pretty friendly Master since then.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I see.\u201dI wonder if you have a conscience.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was looking down at me with a funny face, leaned down and whispered in my ear.\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d\u201cCra\u2014\u201c (\ubbf8\u2015, probably \u201ccrazy bastard\u201d, thanks FLyingtiger-san!)I managed to keep my mouth shut as I reflexively shouted not to say anything crazy. Cheon Sa-yeon, who smiled as if it was understandable, made sure that all the bats had been dealt with and headed to the entrance of the next room.\u2018Because I can\u2019t let my guard down anyway.\u2019If I relaxed a little bit, he would talk nonsense as if he had been waiting for it. I sighed and followed him.This device leading to the next room was located on the ceiling. As I climbed into the air, I found a flower shape among the murals carved on the ceiling and pressed it down as explained by Cheon Sa-yeon. The iron grate went up with a clicking sound, revealing the entrance to the next room.Keureureung\u2026As soon as the door opened, the cry of an animal could be heard through the darkness. According to the data, the monster in this room was Skeleton Cerberus (\uc2a4\ucf08\ub808\ud1a4 \ucf00\ub974\ubca0\ub85c\uc2a4). A-grade skeleton monster in the form of a three-headed dog.Kung! Kung!As we entered the room, the monsters barked and drooling. While looking at Cerberus, who was growling as if it was measuring my power, I turned to Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can ask you this question.\u201dI asked, pointing to Cerberus, which looked like a rather large dog (skeleton to be exact).\u201cWhen a dog meets a strong relative, it gets scared and lowers its tail, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t they be afraid if Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0comes forward? What do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dI asked because I thought the wolf would win if it was a big dog and a big wolf, but Woo Seo-hyuk had an ambiguous expression that was hard to explain, and Cheon Sa-yeon burst into laughter briefly.I added a word quickly.\u201cI thought it would be easier to kill if it was scared\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any use because I am not afraid to see the Master with a big difference in rank before my kind.\u201d\u201cAs expected.\u201dI was hoping that it might work. I was mixed with the guild members who started the battle with the regrets behind me. If it was an A-grade, I was able to handle it well.Cerberus, who was aiming for my neck and rushing at me, was blown away with the wind, raising the energy and creating a strong gust of wind throughout the room. Cerberus, who had been holding up with their claws, flew away helplessly in the strong wind and smashed into pieces. I tried it as a test and it worked better than expected.\u2018It may be difficult to do it in a spacious exterior, but it is usable in a confined interior.\u2019The downside was that the nearby guild members also have to stop attacking and endure the wind. However, when all Cerberus was killed by the gust of wind, the guild members raised their thumbs up to me, saying it was okay.I didn\u2019t know if it was because they were really okay with it or because I looked close to Cheon Sa-yeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cheon Sa-yeon said to be especially careful and decided to get enough rest at the end of each room in case of an accident.It was good for me. Anyway, the injury didn\u2019t heal, so I was uncomfortable.I was resting with my back against the wall, swallowing the painkiller I had received beforehand, and Cheon Sa-yeon, who came to see the condition of the guild members once in a while, said to me.\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat a different kind of shit this is. I answered, feeling my body slightly heavy due to a slight fever.\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d\u201cToo cold.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon gave Woo Seo-hyuk, who was standing behind him, with a sad look.\u201cI\u2019ve been being treated like this lately. What do you think?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk responded calmly with an expression not in the slightest surprised.\u201cI\u2019ve deceived everyone for your sake\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, wait a minute.\u201dI wrapped my forehead, which was starting to itch.\u201cWhat do you mean by deceiving?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be this tactless. Woo Seo-hyuk, please explain it instead.\u201d\u201cYes. The Master took care of Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0to rest under the pretext of preparing for an accident.\u201d\u201cDo you think that if I\u2019m not the reason for it, it will be all over? It is true that we have to be prepared for accidents.\u201d (\uac16\ub2e4 \ubd99\uc774\uba74 \ub2e4\uc778 \uc904 \uc555\ub2c8\uae4c?, I don\u2019t understand this)\u201cThe Master never delays the breakout time. This is unusual.\u201d\u201cDid you hear that?\u201dI had to listen to it. I don\u2019t know what to say.When I looked at him sullenly without answering, he put on a sad expression like Cheon Sa-yeon was teaching a student who couldn\u2019t study.\u201cDo you still have something to say, Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Thank you.\u201dCursing that he was a madman inside, I bowed my head. Do you avoid it because you are afraid or because it is dirty? (\ub625\uc774 \ubb34\uc11c\uc6cc\uc11c \ud53c\ud558\ub0d0, \ub354\ub7ec\uc6cc\uc11c \ud53c\ud558\uc9c0, what the\u2026 forgive me.)In my experience, it was best for a crazy person like Cheon Sa-yeon to do what he wanted to do and turned around quickly.As I expected, Cheon Sa-yeon put on the expression that he was lacking in the thanks. That\u2019s what you have to do then. Gradually the headache subsided and the pain from the wound improved.\u201cNow let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWhile looking back at Cheon Sa-yeon, who was looking for a device to open the door, someone poked me in the back. When I looked back, it was the healers.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi, would you like to eat this?\u201d\u201cYou must not take painkillers on an empty stomach!\u201dI already ate.It wasn\u2019t that tactless to reply like that, so I smiled slightly as a token of appreciation and accepted what they were handed to me. On my hand was a cookie wrapped in a pretty wrapper.\u201cI, I made it. I\u2019ve made it a few times, so it should taste good.\u201d\u201cI get tired easily in places like this, so I need sweet snacks. If it\u2019s okay with you, please have some.\u201d\u201cThank you for the food. I have a sweet tooth.\u201dThe two healers, who appear to be of the same age as Han Yi-gyeol, smiled brightly at my thanks, promised to make them next time, and went back to their seats. Received a cute gift, I couldn\u2019t hide the heartwarming smile that leaked from my lips.\u2018Yes. Sometimes this happens.\u2019I want to stop dealing with crazy people. I held the cookie bag with a fragrant scent in my arms. Everything was good, but there was no bag to store the cookies.As I was contemplating whether I should carry it or just eat it, Cheon Sa-yeon who opened the door smiled and held out his hand.\u201cGive it to me. I\u2019ll keep it.\u201d\u201cIn the inventory?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI pondered for a while. Can I leave it to you? Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s brightly smiling face bothered me, but I couldn\u2019t keep carrying it around, so I handed the cookie bag to Cheon Sa-yeon.When Cheon Sa-yeon tapped his watch, the cookie bag disappeared.\u201cStill, more than half came.\u201dThat\u2019s true because this is the 6th room. I could feel the A-grade energy through the open entrance. A spider monster (\uac70\ubbf8 \ubaac\uc2a4\ud130) that used to be a B-grade was upgraded to an A-grade.Syaaaak!Kkureuk, kkureureuk!Dozens of tiny spiders that looked the same flashed their eyes on the back of the hairy spider. The guild members took out their weapons with a tired expression. No matter how many gates you go through and encounter monsters, it was not easy to get used to these spiders.Spiders, the size of a large dog, came down one after another from the ceiling on a web.\u00a0Dagak, dagak. The sound of hard legs hitting the wall could be heard from all directions.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi, you can\u2019t do that this time!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to imagine that you will bump into a spider flying in the wind!\u201d\u201cJust let us take care of it!\u201d\u201cThe wounded, back off!\u201dThe guild members were terrified and stopped me as I was about to step forward. While I was bewildered because I did not expect such a reaction, the guild members rushed out to deal with the monster. There was nothing to worry about because the big spider was an A-grade and a small spider hanging from its back was not even a C-grade.\u201cDog skeletons are okay, but spiders aren\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand to some extent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m not that delicate.\u201d (\uc774\ub807\uac8c \uc12c\uc138\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574\uc11c\uc57c)Woo Seo-hyuk and Cheon Sa-yeon seemed to sympathize with the opinions of the guild members. I smoothed the back of my head in embarrassment.\u2018What does it have to do with being delicate?\u2019Anyway, the wounded was beaten, so I did not step forward and stood by Cheon Sa-yeon, waiting for it to be dealt with.As expected, it didn\u2019t take long to deal with all the monsters. The person with the ability to measure the body while walking around then reported in a very gloomy voice.\u201cIt has risen from 11.6% in B-grade to 56.8% in A-grade. For some reason, the more I pass through the room, the higher the grade rises up.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon was probably thinking the same as me now.This gate is an S-grade gate. That meant that an S-class or higher monster could appear at any time.\u2018There is a high probability that an S+ grade monster will appear.\u2019Measuring ability and other guild members were also concerned. Fortunately, there was Cheon Sa-yeon, so everyone was calmly breaking through.\u2018If only one S+ grade monster appeared, it would be fine\u2026\u2019I remembered the Spectre I was dealing with yesterday. It was not enough that the grade was raised from A-grade to S-grade, and the number also increased. Even a new ability that wasn\u2019t there before was added.As I recalled Spectre\u2019s nails that had been stained with poison, I reflexively felt a throbbing pain in my shoulder.S+ grade monsters would have to deal with in a small room, but could they handle it without any damage?\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who had sent back the person with a measured ability, beckoned me to come closer.\u201cThere are four rooms left.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who had his arms crossed and his fingers flicked, asked.\u201cWhich monster do you think is the most troublesome?\u201dI slowly recalled the contents of the data. After examining the list of monsters that did not appear one by one, I answered carefully.\u201c\u2026Ghost (\uace0\uc2a4\ud2b8).\u201dThe remaining monsters were two grade S and two grade A. Among them, I chose the S-grade Ghost.\u201cThe reason is?\u201d\u201cIf it continues as it is now, there is a high probability that not only Ghosts but also Banshee (\ubca4\uc2dc\ub3c4) will become S+ grade anyway. Then the problem will be the number of monsters, not the grade.\u201dBanshee appeared alone, but there were five Ghosts. If the number increased and abilities were added like the Spectre, the Ghost would be more difficult than the Banshee.\u201cThere are more than 5 S+ grade monsters. The only people who can actually go into battle are Master and Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who was standing behind Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s back, nodded.\u201cWe need a countermeasure.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was quietly listening to the conversation, opened his mouth.\u201cMy thoughts are the same. Ghosts are probably more difficult than Banshee.\u201dHe gazed down at me. To see it simply because he had something to say, his black eyes contained a strange light.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026what is it?\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re not feeling well, but I need you to move with me.\u201d\u201cAre you playing a role?\u201d\u201cYes. So Woo Seo-hyuk, stay far from the guild members. You will face the monsters that Han Yi-gyeol and I missed.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cIf it was a different gate, I would have come up with more diverse methods, but this is the one. If you use a half-measure for nothing, you will do more damage.\u201dI agree with that. The space was too narrow and limited to fight comfortably.\u201cEven though I\u2019m wearing the bracelet, I can\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019ll be able to handle the Master. Do it while watching my condition.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s a bit disappointing. There\u2019s nothing we can do about A-rank.\u201d\u201cThe item you gave me as a gift must have been decorated.\u201dI replied harshly.I wanted to hide my true feelings because of being looked at by Woo Seo-hyuk, but after two days, I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. How can I just stay still after being teased by you?Fortunately, Woo Seo-hyuk did not respond to any conversation between me and Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi, are you okay? This plan.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not SS-grade, but it\u2019s still an S+ grade higher than the S-grade. If you are not careful, you may get hurt.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to deal with it at least once.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dHe was just blunt as if he had no emotions, but Woo Seo-hyuk must be an S-rank too. Or maybe it\u2019s the inevitable instinct of a man who wants to meet a strong opponent at least once.\u201cYou never know when or where they will appear in the rest of the room, so always be careful.\u201d* * *In spite of the countermeasures, an A-grade monster appeared in the 7th room.\u201c89.34% of A-grade. It didn\u2019t make it to S-grade.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dI said to the guild member who was cleaning up the moth monster corpses that were scattered around and Cheon Sa-yeon said.\u201cThat\u2019s it for today. Let\u2019s pack up and rest.\u201dEveryone sat down with a sigh of relief. Perhaps it was because of the tension from the cramped air of the underground and the constantly rising monster grades, everyone seemed very tired.\u201cI\u2019m going to die\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyone who has a clean cloth left over?\u201d\u201cWhen burning a corpse, remove the wings. If you bring the wings, the research team kids will be delighted.\u201dAs I looked at the guild members taking a break, a healer team with a new bandage approached me.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi, how are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI will treat you. I brought you a new bandage.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI unbuttoned my shirt and sat down. Still, if I received treatment this time, the wound would heal to some extent. Since we had to deal with S+ grade monsters, we had to reduce the burden on our bodies to a minimum.\u201cIt\u2019s A-class bandage. Master took care of it.\u201dLooking at the bandage in the healer\u2019s hand, I really felt the energy of the item. I thought it would be a regular bandage this time. It seemed that Cheon Sa-yeon really liked the A-class bandage.\u201cI don\u2019t need an A-class bandage for treatment, do I?\u201d\u201cEi, still. It\u2019s a waste since I got it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIs that so?That was then I was persuaded to nod my head and take off my shirt.Kugugugung!The surrounding area shook violently and there was a roar. Stone dust fell from the ceiling, and the candles shone anxiously as if they were about to go out at any moment.\u201cWh, what?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe guild members who were resting were surprised and quickly prepared for battle. I also got up while re-buttoning my shirt.Uuuung\u2014!Kugung!An ominous cry could be heard over the still-unopened entrance. I found the purple smoke slowly spreading through the darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guild members, who were immersed in the purple smoke up to their ankles, groaned and staggered.\u201cKeuk, wait a minute\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dClink.The guild members who dropped their weapons bowed their heads with empty faces. Waving their arms helplessly, they began to walk in unison to somewhere involuntarily.\u201cWake up!\u201dThe same was true of the two healers standing next to me with frightened faces. They blocked me, pushed me, and walked forward as if possessed.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk ran to me. Fortunately, he looked fine. Cheon Sa-yeon, who quietly watched the guild members staggering and moving in the direction of the monster\u2019s cry, turned to me.\u201cHmm.\u201dHe smiled at me. Why are you laughing in a serious situation?\u201cMaster! This smoke\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who took out his sword and jacket, suddenly pulled my arm strongly.\u201cUgh, what\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat should I do, Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dHe looked down at me and smiled brightly.\u201cIt\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun, I think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201dYou\u2019re already crazier there? I opened my eyes wide and couldn\u2019t hide my embarrassment. Woo Seo-hyuk, who was watching from behind, also made a surprised face.Kugugung! Kureureung!The sound of falling stones was heard one after another. The distance was very close.\u201cLet\u2019s put this on for now.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon put the jacket over my shoulder and smiled pleasantly.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s change the plan. I don\u2019t think we need to worry about the guild members.\u201d\u201cUgh, wait!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon held me tightly in his arms as I freaked out. I grabbed his collar and asked.\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have to care?\u201d\u201cLiterally.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon drew his palm with a sword. A gorgeous-looking long sword. I immediately recognized the identity of the sword. It was an SS-class, Lilith sword.\u201cBenshi\u2019s magic skill. Do you know that?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the ability to make one subject submissive? But that.\u201d\u201cSince the grade has increased, the conditions for activation of that ability seem to have changed.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that Banshee is coming this way?\u201d\u201cIncluding Ghosts.\u201dBanshee cast a spell on one person and ordered them to protect their relatively weak body. As Banshee, which used to be S-grade, become grade S+, the range of its magic ability had expanded to this extent.\u201cIf you are under a spell, there is no need to worry about being attacked by monsters. So, the first thing to do is to deal with the Ghosts first. Woo Seo-hyuk, you check Banshee to prevent any more useless spells from being used.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk stepped back. When the distance widened enough that the conversation could not be heard, Cheon Sa-yeon opened his mouth using his ability.\u201cI\u2019m telling you because you don\u2019t seem to notice, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\u201cA-rank, everyone except you is under the spell.\u201dI frowned at the words whispered in my ear.It was then that I realized why Cheon Sa-yeon was so happy. I smiled in vain while wearing a jacket with my body in close contact with Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cI did something.\u201d\u201cIt is not a light problem.\u201dKkiiii\u2014Geugeuk, geugeuk. Gigik.Beyond the darkness, a blue light flickered along with the cry of the Ghost. At first glance, it wasn\u2019t just one or two. Like the last line of defence, the remaining iron bars shook as if they were about to break.\u201cSo? Do you want to hear the answer, or do you want to dig into it yourself? If it is the latter, I think we should reconsider our partnership.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry, but I have to put up with it.\u201dCome to think of it, even at the SS-grade gate, everyone except me and Cheon Sa-yeon was dragged into the sand. Even the S-rank Park Geon-ho was helpless and the SS-grade boss Lilith\u2019s ability was deflected by me. It\u2019s definitely not normal.Kkigigik! Kuung!The iron bars were crumpled like paper. The flames surrounding Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword burned even hotter.\u201cFor whatever reason, it is true that you should be careful. Above all, Woo Seo-hyuk is a quick-witted person, so there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d noticed it.\u201dThat\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think Woo Seo-hyuk would be the type of person who can talk about it in haste.\u201cWhatever it is, I have fun.\u201dIt must be interesting, including the situation that Woo Seo-hyuk would have noticed. I sighed and raised my ability. At the same time, the entrance collapsed and the monsters appeared.Geugeugeuk, geugeuk.A ghost with an opaque body and blue light presumed to be eyes entered with a bizarre cry.The guild members standing at the entrance passed the Ghost and walked towards Banshee. Banshee, floating in the air with its grey rough hair fluttering, tore its mouth long and smiled at us.The hem of its overgrown, dirty robe flew in the wind, and rotten teeth could be seen through the open mouth. The guild members surrounded Banshee, which looked like a witch from an old fairy tale.Kihihihi. Hihihik.When Ghosts and Banshee added up, there were a total of 16 S+ grade monsters. My body stiffened at the horror of that number. I breathed in calmly and lifted the Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body.The Ghosts, who had twisted their bodies like broken machines, came out at once and turned their heads towards Cheon Sa-yeon.Gagagak, geugeuk. Geuk!Pajijik, the electric current that wrapped around the Ghost\u2019s body flashed. At the same time, Cheon Sa-yeon flew to the right.\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Blue lightning struck and the floor shattered. I swallowed the scream.\u201cUgh!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon swung his sword sharply.\u00a0Geugagag!\u00a0Prickly electricity passed through the cheeks, splitting the centre of Ghost\u2019s body near him. Blood splattered and splashed.As it was a monster with electric current flowing through its body, every time it was killed, strong electricity rose through the sword. Fortunately, Cheon Sa-yeon, who had to attack directly, was SS-grade, so he didn\u2019t take any major damage.Cheon Sa-yeon looked at the blood flowing down torn my cheek. I shook my head.\u201cDon\u2019t mind.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t help anything if I cared about getting hurt. Perhaps Cheon Sa-yeon had the same thoughts as me, and there was no hesitation in his hand wielding the sword.Kiaaaak!A number of poisonous crystals flew with the screams of Banshee that piercing my ears. I quickly changed the wind flow around me and lifted Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body high. The poisonous crystals that hit the floor sizzled and melted the ground.\u201cRight!\u201dAt my cry, Cheon Sa-yeon bent his upper body forward and drew his sword horizontally at the same time. As soon as the poisonous crystal passed right over my head, a hot electric current ran through my body once more.\u201cUgh!\u201dGeuook! Geugeuk!White light exploded in my vision and I felt a burning pain on my forehead.\u00a0Jureuk, a slimy thing flowed past my eyes and down my cheeks.\u00a0Kwagwang! Kwang!\u00a0Lightning struck everywhere Cheon Sa-yeon passed.Again, my body shuddered. I clenched my teeth and endured the pain. The number of remaining Ghosts is 12.Among the Ghosts, I saw Woo Seo-hyuk fighting with Banshee. It didn\u2019t seem easy to attack the guild members who were blocking him.I pulled out the energy that surrounded my heart strongly.Huuung!\u00a0The strong wind gradually increased in size around me. The jewel on the bracelet I was wearing began to glow and the energy started to fill up little by little, but it didn\u2019t help because the amount that escaped was enormous.Gagagak, gigik! Geugeuk!A whirlwind strong enough to stop the Ghost swept over the guild members. Noticing my intentions, Woo Seo-hyuk put his changed arm on the floor and endured the wind.Kkiaaak!The guild members who were guarding Banshee flew off due to my ability and crashed into the wall then fainted. There were no injuries because there was no attack, it was just a strong wind.When all the guild members were flying away by the wind, Banshee began to panic. As the wind subsided, Woo Seo-hyuk rushed to Banshee as if he had been waiting.\u201cNot bad.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was not attacking the Ghost, swung his sword again with the intention of watching what I was going to do.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe Ghost was devoured by the blazing fire along with the electric current. I endured the pain by grabbing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s clothes.The wound on my shoulder throbbed heavily and was soaked in hot liquid. I could even tell without having to check it. The wound was suddenly opened.\u201cYour body will not be able to handle them one by one.\u201d\u201cWhat, I\u2019m going to\u2026\u201dThe blood surrounding the sword burned hot as if it would burn the surroundings.Instead of answering, Cheon Sa-yeon hugged me tightly and quickly dug into the centre of the Ghosts. Noticing what he was trying to do, I spit out a curse and grabbed him tightly.Geuooo! Geugeuk! Geuo!Huung, as he swung his sword, the three Ghosts were set on fire at the same time. The opaque body turned to black ashes and a strong electric current ran through it.\u201cHu, huh, ugh!\u201dIt was a different intensity than when I killed one, my back twisted and screams came out. A thin cut on the back of the hand and thigh was drawn, and blood was dripping down.\u201cYou, bitch\u2026\u201d (\uac1c, \uac19\u2026, thank you, bbbluesnow!^^)\u201cHold on.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon said sternly. Unlike me, who suffered from the current flowing through the sword every time a Ghost died, Cheon Sa-yeon, who didn\u2019t take any damage, seemed to enjoy the battle.Kureureung! Kureung!The darkroom flashed with blue lightning. Ghosts flocked to capture Cheon Sa-yeon.Cheon Sa-yeon spread his legs and lowered his upper body. Muscles grew in his shoulders and arms, and his wrists twisted slightly. From left to right. I fixed my gaze on the tip of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword.Geugagak! Geuak!The Ghost\u2019s body, which was approaching close to the hot flames, melted little by little. Lightning flashed among the crowd of Ghosts. At the same time, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword moved quickly with the power of the wind.The bright red fire and blue lightning struck and blazed splendidly. The Ghost liquid that had melted into the sword poured down on the floor.\u201cHuu, ah\u2026\u201dMy body trembled at the unbearable pain. The electric current that ran through my body tore through my back. My heart was beating so fast that I couldn\u2019t control it as my breathing became rough.\u201cThere are three left.\u201dHe asked, avoiding the lightning that was aiming at him, Cheon Sa-yeon lightly patted my bloody back.\u201cWhat should I do, Yi-gyeol-ah? Are you having a hard time?\u201d\u201cShut up\u2026\u201dIt was very heinous to pretend to be sweet to the subject that he was having a lot of fun with.\u201cShould I kill them one by one, or should I kill them all at once? Ung? I will do whatever you want.\u201dI answered with a cold sweat.\u201c\u2026at once.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon fixed and hugged me who was drooping and said in a smiling voice.\u201cHold on, then.\u201dHuuk, as soon as the body jumped forward, the flames rose sharply.\u00a0Geuoo, the pain that was waiting along with the Ghost\u2019s last cry passed through my waist and heated the back of my neck.\u201cUgh, uh\u2026 uugh.\u201dAs Cheon Sa-yeon walked through the flames burning the Ghost corpse, he held onto my body which was writhing in pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI lean my face on Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s shoulder, exhausted, and looked at Woo Seo-hyuk, who was dealing with Banshee, through the blurry vision.Hihihik, hihihi!Banshee raised its wrinkled hands and spread the poison containing the spell.\u00a0Chiiiik!\u00a0The wall that had touched the poison melted as white smoke rose. Cheon Sa-yeon said to Woo Seo-hyuk, who hurriedly backed away.\u201cGet its attention. I will attack it from behind.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. Calm down and use your ability on Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201dWith those words, I grabbed hold of my trembling energy and raised my ability.\u201cHaa, very\u2026 You\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d\u201cIf you want to cooperate with me, you have to do this.\u201dYou\u2019re such a jerk. Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s body came to mind.Woo Seo-hyuk rushed first towards the giant Banshee that reached the ceiling. To avoid Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s attack, Banshee\u2019s body leaned slightly with its upper body pulled back.Kkiiiiik!Banshee screamed with its mouth wide open. A sense of dread made my body tense. Cheon Sa-yeon, who moved to the right of Banshee, who was struggling to get rid of the rushing Woo Seo-hyuk, blinked at me. I increased the strength of the wind that was wrapping around my legs.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dAs soon as I used more energy, a headache came as if I had been waiting. Cheon Sa-yeon flew upwards and swung his sword at Banshee\u2019s neck.Haaak!Noticing that it was still living, Banshee twisted its body. Banshee, who had its shoulder cut instead of its neck, let out the screams in pain from the blazing fire. Woo Seo-hyuk, who was looking for a chance, did not miss a chance and thrust his sharp claws into Banshee\u2019s face.Kkiiiiik! Kkiiii\u2014!Red blood gushed from its clawed eyes and mouth. The fire on its shoulder quickly scorched Banshee\u2019s weakened body.\u201cGasp\u2026\u201dThe little energy left ran wildly and squeezed my heart painfully.\u00a0Huuk, I lowered my head as it became dark in front of me.* * *\u201c\u2026-gyeol. Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dSomeone tapped my cheek. When I forced my tired eyes to open, I saw the burned-out corpse of Banshee and Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face.\u201cI think you\u2019ve been overworked.\u201dI kept closing my eyes from extreme fatigue. Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cNot in good shape.\u201d\u201cBecause he is so weak.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cHmm, I guess I\u2019ll have to finish it myself.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon with a sword handed me over to Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cWake up the fainted guild members and prepare to exit the gate. In the meantime, I will deal with the remaining monsters and find an exit.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk answered with me on his back. Finally, I lost my mind.* * *A cool breeze blew through the tip of my nose. Feeling a heavy headache, I slowly opened my eyes to see Cheon Sa-yeon talking to someone.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. Are you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026ah.\u201dA familiar voice was heard. As I slowly turned my gaze to the side, I saw Kim Woo-jin with a wrinkled brow.\u2018Is it outside the gate?\u2019I remembered Kim Woo-jin\u2019s words that he would go out to meet me. You\u2019re really here.It was then that I came to my senses. I must have passed out for quite some time.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you to clean up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who ordered Woo Seo-hyuk, bowed his head and looked at me.\u201cSleep more. You\u2019re going to the guild right away.\u201dIt was only then that I realized that I was in Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms.\u201cNo, stop it\u2026\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u201dThe posture with the back of the knee supported was very burdensome. It would be better for him to carry me on his shoulders. (\ub4f1\uacfc \ubb34\ub98e \ub4a4\ucabd\uc744 \ubc1b\uccd0 \ub4e0 \uc790\uc138\uac00 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6e0\ub2e4, I imagine this scene as carrying him in bridal style?? Am I wrong?)\u201cTo the guild.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who came out of the waiting car and pushed Kim Woo-jin in, ordered the driver.\u00a0Tak, the car door closed and the car started without Cheon Sa-yeon getting on.\u201cDoes it hurt a lot?\u201d\u201cMy head\u2026\u201dA hand gently stroking my forehead, avoiding the wound, was cool. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand, which came down, touched my neck.\u201cThe heat is rising because of the wound. When we arrive at the guild, we should treat it immediately. That healer woman is waiting for you.\u201dHealer woman?\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi?\u201d\u201cYeah, that person. She has been contacted.\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0is still\u2026\u201dIsn\u2019t she on vacation? I mumbled through the blurred consciousness.* * *I thought I had fallen asleep for a while, but when I opened my eyes, it was the first place I had seen. I couldn\u2019t get a sense of reality, so I blinked blankly, but the door opened and someone I was glad to see entered.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dIt was Min Ah-rin that I met after a long time. Min Ah-rin, who came straight to me, smiled comfortably and said.\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s been a while, Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cI know, right. Actually, I need to take a few more days off, but I just came back after hearing the news that Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0was ill. How is your body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much better.\u201dExcept for an IV on the wrist, all the wounds had disappeared and my energy was stable.\u201cThis place\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hospital room inside the Requiem Guild.\u201dIt looked great and the facilities were good. That\u2019s why you came to the guild, not the hospital. I nodded and fiddled with the IV. Seeing this, Min Ah-rin sighed and said.\u201cYou need to rest more. It seems to me that you\u2019ve been overworked and your body aches\u2026 The fever doesn\u2019t come down at all.\u201dOh, so that\u2019s why my head hurts. My throat was sore and uncomfortable.\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d\u201cWoo-jin-ssi\u00a0went up to change his clothes for a while\u2026 Master, he must be busy in one way or another.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who pulled up the chair and sat next to my bed, gently patted me on my chest and opened her mouth.\u201cStop worrying about other people and get some more sleep. When the fever goes down, you have to eat. Healers can\u2019t cure colds and body aches, so you have to take care of them yourself.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin looked at me tenaciously. She seemed intent on watching until I fell asleep.Rest. Yeah, good. I forcibly closed my eyes and tried to sleep.* * *The body aches that I thought would get better soon tormented me for three days. It was hard to come to my senses because of the constant fever and vomiting after eating.\u2018Driving me crazy\u2026\u2019I could feel how weak Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body was once again. I was shocked in many ways because I didn\u2019t catch a cold easily, let alone body aches. Even he\u2019s an A-rank. It was terrifying just to imagine how much he would have been bullied if he was an ordinary person.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen an A-rank that hurt this much.\u201dI was so ill that even Min Ah-rin was embarrassed, and on the morning of the fourth day, I was finally able to return to normal body temperature.\u201cI thought you were going to die\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201dAs I mumbled while drinking the water that Kim Woo-jin had given me, she replied with sharp eyes.\u201cBe careful from now on. When I look at you, Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0seems so careless with his body.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who had been nagging a lot while taking care of my sick for three days, also said the same thing. I replied with an awkward smile at the gaze from both sides.\u201cI didn\u2019t do that on purpose\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy is it that everyone else is fine, but you\u2019re the only one on his back?\u201dThat\u2019s because your boss driving me around\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even guild members with a lower rank than Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0were not hurt.\u201dEveryone was under the Banshee\u2019s spell\u2026There were only meaningless answers to explain, so I kept my mouth shut and accepted their concerns.[Breaking news. The return of the Jayna Guild Clear Team who entered the G21 Area gate is being delayed. Experts say that hasty judgment is dangerous\u2026]Knock, knock.While I was watching TV leisurely, I heard a knock on the door of the hospital room. Since there was no one to come, so someone did, but the one who opened the door was none other than Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cYeah, what\u2026\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, standing in a black suit and holding a fruit basket in one hand, had the same grim expression as he had a few days ago.\u201cOh, Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cYes. Long time no see. Healer Min Ah-rin.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk lightly bowed his head to greet Min Ah-rin, who greeted him warmly.\u201cBut what brings you here?\u201d\u201cI have come under orders from the Master.\u201dOrder from Cheon Sa-yeon? While puzzled, Woo Seo-hyuk pulled something out of his arms and held it to me. It was two cards that he took unexpectedly.\u201cThe white card is a card made under Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s name and the black card is a master card.\u201dWhy card all of sudden?\u201cThe price for participating as a mercenary at this gate is in Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s card.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cMaster said you can use the master card as much as you want if you are short on money.\u201dI looked down at the black card in a sour mood. A card with a gold number engraved on its black body gleamed gently in the light of a fluorescent lamp.\u201cHave Master seen any dramas?\u201dMin Ah-rin responded that it was fun, and Kim Woo-jin had an unwilling expression similar to mine. As expected, Kim Woo-jin knew something. It was difficult to receive such an excessive favour.\u201cHey, Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi.\u201d\u201cI tell you in advance, I can\u2019t get it back. I was just ordered to deliver. If you want to refuse, please meet the Master in person.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk said firmly. There\u2019s nothing I can do. I nodded my head once.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way. Take a good rest.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk left the hospital room without looking back. I looked at the two cards in my hand.\u201cHow much do you think he gave me?\u201d\u201cMaybe two thousand? I heard the contract for A-rank mercenaries is about that much.\u201dMin Ah-rin took out the fruit from the basket and informed me.Two thousand. I took out my phone and installed the app and nodded. Two thousand isn\u2019t bad.\u201cThat\u2019s enough for me to go shopping.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming, too!\u201d\u201cM, me too\u2026\u201dI laughed happily. As expected, the best treatment is financial therapy. I checked the balance with a pounding heart.\u201c\u2026what the hell is this, fuck.\u201dI rubbed my eyes and checked the numbers again.\u300cBalance 100,000,000 Won\u300d \u00a0(Around $85.000 USDDid I count one wrong zero? No, right?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi?\u201dAfter taking a calm, deep breath, I turned off the app with the balance indicator and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think I need to take a call for a moment\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go to a cafe with Woo-jin-ssi. Is there anything you want to drink?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to buy you a vanilla latte?\u201d\u201cUn. Go ahead.\u201dWithout any doubt, Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin left the room. I immediately pressed the call button.The ringing tone continued for a long time. He\u2019s very busy, so there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll get it. Just as I was about to give up, the other person answered the phone.Clack.[Yes, Yi-gyeol-ah.]\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201dAs soon as the call was connected and I asked a question, I heard a low laugh from the other side.[Unfortunately, I\u2019m not sane.]\u201cWhat are you doing in someone else\u2019s name?\u201d[How long can I not pay for an item?]\u201cSo you put such a ridiculous amount in?\u201d[I expected you to contact me.]I rubbed my forehead and sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t need a card or money or anything. Give me the cookies you brought.\u201d[You\u2019d better take it even if you don\u2019t need it. There is nothing bad about having it. I\u2019ll give you the cookies later.]\u201cActually, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the money. The person who gave it is the problem.\u201d[Han Yi-gyeol.]Cheon Sa-yeon said in a soft, subdued voice.[Didn\u2019t I tell you? Please don\u2019t lose your energy by standing up for me needlessly.]\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been through so many things, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d[I just paid the price. This gate was especially dangerous.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[I hope you accept it comfortably.]Umm, looking out the window, I scratched the back of my head.I was going to return the black card, but I don\u2019t think it will be easy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t know how things had gone since I left the gate because I was suffering from the pain.[It would be better to talk about that later.]\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d[Let\u2019s meet face-to-face. I\u2019m going back in two days, so you should rest until then.]Going back? I asked casually.\u201cWhere are you?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon said as if he was having fun.[Why do you have so many questions about me? I\u2019m so touched.]\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d[Haha.]A voice other than Cheon Sa-yeon could be heard over the phone. At first, it looked like an attendant.[I\u2019ll hang up now. Please just keep it in mind even if you want to see me in the meantime.]Crazy guy.I was disgusted and ended the call right away.\u2018Wait. I didn\u2019t hear where you are.\u2019Nothing has been resolved. I sighed.Bump\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re back\u2026 Yi-gyeol-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dMin Ah-rin and Kim Woojin, who had gone out to buy coffee just in time, returned. I said as I was handed coffee by Kim Woo-jin.\u201cToday, I\u2019m going to clean up the hospital room and go back to the 23rd floor.\u201d\u201cAre you okay? Why don\u2019t you lie down for a day or so?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do it because it hurts a little.\u201dI was well, so there was no need to stay here any longer. Min Ah-rin, who rolled her eyes as if contemplating my words for a moment, nodded her head.\u201cOkay. The vacation is over, so if something happens, Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0will be dispatched to emergency service, huh?\u201d (\uc800 \ud734\uac00\ub3c4 \ub05d\ub0ac\uc73c\ub2c8\uae4c \uc5ec\ucc28\ud558\uba74 \uc774\uacb0 \uc528 \ud55c\uc815 \uae34\uae09 \ucd9c\ub3d9\ud574 \uc8fc\uc8e0, \ubb50, wait, I can\u2019t translate it well this sentence)\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t because I\u2019m anxious.\u201dMin Ah-rin took the cell phone out of my hand. Min Ah-rin, who touched the screen at a speed that I couldn\u2019t even follow, immediately returned the cell phone.\u201cI saved my number. Do you know how difficult it is to get a healer number?\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIf anything happens, please call me.\u201dMin Ah-rin opened her eyes wide and spoke as if scolding me, but she was not scary and just looked cute. I smiled awkwardly and looked at the phone where Min Ah-rin\u2019s number was saved. For some reason, it seemed that more and more numbers were saved.As I left the hospital room with my luggage, Min Ah-rin offered to watch a movie, but she got a call before I even refused. From what I had heard, it seemed that an injured person came out of the gate that had just been cleared.\u201cFor sure next time! Let\u2019s go play.\u201dMin Ah-rin left with a sad face.* * *I returned to the room on the 23rd floor with Kim Woo-jin.I took off the shirt I was wearing in the hospital room and put on a white tee and a dark navy blue blouse. When I changed my clothes, Kim Woo-jin asked with a puzzled voice.\u201cWhat. Are you going out?\u201d\u201cI have a place to go to.\u201d\u201cI will go, too.\u201dWhy not, however. I pondered for a while and answered yes. Kim Woo-jin, who looked at me with no expectations because I rejected every time, shone brightly.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dAfter searching for a destination on my cell phone, I came out of the guild building with Kim Woo-jin. At that moment, I grabbed a taxi passing by and got on and answered.\u201cG21 Area.\u201d* * *As I got out of the taxi, I frowned at the crowd gathered near the control line. There is nothing to see in this state.\u201cKim Woo-jin. Come closer.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKim Woo-jin came close to my call. I hugged Kim Woo-jin\u2019s waist with one of my arms and used my ability. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body hardened in an instant.\u201cHey, don\u2019t stay still and hold onto my waist. Your posture is very\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cKim Woo-jin?\u201dCurious, I looked up and saw Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face, which was red as if it was about to explode. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201cKim Woo-jin, are you okay?\u201d\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026\u201d\u201cHold my waist.\u201dI have to go higher, but I\u2019m worried. At my words, Kim Woo-jin squeaked like a machine that had not been lubricated and hugged my waist. It\u2019s better now. I increased my altitude.\u201cIs it okay? I guess it\u2019s comfortable for the two of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look good. If you don\u2019t like it, wait downstairs.\u201dWe should be able to float separately, but then I have to worry about the amount of energy that escaped twice, so it was annoying.\u201cNope. It\u2019s really okay.\u201dKim Woo-jin hurriedly shook his head to deny it, but his complexion did not improve at all. Are you afraid of heights like Ha Tae-heon?I guess I\u2019ll have to move on my own next time.\u201c\u2026anyway, why here?\u201d\u201cI need to check something.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon told me to rest until he returned, but I wasn\u2019t the one who would listen to it.\u2018I don\u2019t want to believe the information that Cheon Sa-yeon gave me.\u2019Of course, there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it. I just came to the G21 Area just in case.\u201cOpen!\u201d\u201cThe gate is open!\u201dAfter a while, the reporters who were looking at the gate took out their cameras all at once. The gate, which had been firmly closed, opened its mouth and people came out.\u201cStand back.\u201d\u201cPlease keep a safe distance!\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi! Please interview with me!\u201d\u201cWhy is the clear time delayed?\u201dThe bodyguards managed to stop the reporters, who became fiercer as they waited for a long time. I found a familiar face among the clear teams that each embraced their wounds.\u201cLend me a hat and you use your ability.\u201dI brought the hat that was worn on Kim Woo-jin\u2019s head and said while wearing it. Kim Woo-jin was puzzled but used his ability. The boy\u2019s face suddenly clouded like a mist.In that state, he went down to the safety line out of sight.\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201dI approached Cha Soo-yeon, who was being treated for injuries. Cha Soo-yeon, who looked back at me reflexively, widened her eyes.\u201cHow can you be here\u2026\u201d\u201cI need to talk to you about something.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Cha Soo-yeon said to the healer.\u201cI\u2019m fine now, so please look at others.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAs the healer left, Cha Soo-yeon looked around and dragged me to a relatively deserted place. I gently lifted the hat that I had been wearing deep enough to cover my eyes and smiled at Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cAre you seriously hurt?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dTo my question, Cha Soo-yeon snorted and answered with a proud smile. That\u2019s right. If it was Cha Soo-yeon, it was not like she was easily defeated.\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cI came here just in case, and I\u2019m lucky.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell.\u201dI meant it, but Cha Soo-yeon didn\u2019t seem to believe it. She didn\u2019t trust me as much as she used to. That\u2019s unfair.\u201cWhat did you come here for?\u201d\u201cI have a question for you about the gate.\u201dAt those words, Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s eyes shone sharply.\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come here to ask a useless question\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quick-witted.\u201dIn fact, asking for information about the gate belonging to another guild was an act against etiquette. But as the situation was like this, I just hoped Cha Soo-yeon understood it.\u201cI went to the gate with the Requiem Guild members a few days ago.\u201d\u201cI know. I saw you did the interview.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI almost failed to keep a straight face. I, who managed to straighten out my wrinkled face, continued to say what I had stopped.\u201cThe inside of the gate has changed a lot from before.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, most of the monsters have been upgraded. The numbers have also increased.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who had heard that far, nodded her head as if it was understandable.\u201cAre you here to ask if the gate I entered did the same?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201dCha Soo-yeon blinked with a worried look, then folded her arms and sighed.\u201c\u2026right. I was just like you were.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me the details?\u201d\u201cHere, G21 Are is one of the gates I have been in charge of for a long time. It was an easy gate to clear because the number of B-grade monsters was small and not wide.\u201dThe B-grade gate, the gate of the G21 Area where C-grade and B-grade monsters, were predominant.There was an unexpected change in the gate.\u201cAll the monsters were getting stronger without omission. I don\u2019t know exactly because I didn\u2019t bring the person with a measuring ability, but everyone on the team, including me, felt it. Something is wrong.\u201d\u201cGrade C has been upgraded to Grade B, and Grade B has been upgraded to Grade A.\u201d\u201cI guess so. As you said, not only did it get stronger, but the number also increased.\u201dThis was the third time Cha Soo-yeon had cleared the gates of the G21 Area. As they entered twice, it was said that they already knew exactly where and to what extent monsters came out.\u201cTwenty animals appeared where 10 should appear, and another monster intervened in the middle\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon grumbled in a tired voice.\u201cI\u2019m glad I took one healer along as the Master said because I thought it was a B-grade gate and it almost got me into trouble.\u201d\u201cIf your master\u2026 Master Hong Si-ah?\u201d\u201cUng. She\u2019s not the kind of person who usually cares about that, but this time, she has been nagging me a lot to make sure I take the healer.\u201dCha Soo-yeon tilted her head with a subtle expression.\u201cWait. It\u2019s strange to say that. Why must\u2026\u201d\u201cYou may have guessed.\u201dIt\u2019s been four days since I and Cheon Sa-yeon cleared the gate and got out. If Cheon Sa-yeon informed the masters of the dangers of the gate while I was suffering for a while, it is understandable that Master Hong Si-ah reacted like that.\u201cFor sure, we don\u2019t know which gate is strange unless we go inside. Not all gates have changed. Master Hong Si-ah must have invited the healer because she was worried about Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026well, she seems to have a surprisingly delicate personality.\u201dHer tone was blunt, but her proud to her guild master could be seen on her face. Seeing that scene, I reflexively thought of Cheon Sa-yeon.\u2018No, not this one.\u2019I\u2019m an independent, so why do I think of Cheon Sa-yeon? I said hurriedly, erasing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face from my mind.\u201cThank you for letting me know. I will go now.\u201d\u201cWhat? Already?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was nothing to say now, and Kim Woo-jin, who was standing still during the conversation, also concerned me. I was just about to leave, but unexpectedly, Cha Soo-yeon caught me.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not really like that. That\u2019s kind of ridiculous! Like last time. Are you all done when your business is over?\u201dAs I stared blankly, wondering what to do, Cha Soo-yeon reached out to me with a frustrated expression.\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhat. Cell phone!\u201dI was about to take out my phone involuntarily at the words she said proudly, but I finally came to my senses and shook my head.\u201cWell, the cell phone is a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to give me your number?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with you? I\u2019m scared.\u201cThis is the case that\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201dEven though she smiled awkwardly and stepped back, Cha Soo-yeon was persistent. The tenacious gaze made me had a cold sweat, and a hard voice came from behind.\u201cGet away. He doesn\u2019t want to give it to you.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had been quiet until now, released his ability. Then Cha Soo-yeon noticed Kim Woo-jin standing behind me and wrinkled her brow.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m.\u201dAt Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s question, Kim Woo-jin glanced at me.\u201cFri, friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf you\u2019re going to cheat, say something brazenly, but why are you stuttering?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kim Woo-jin grabbed my arm and pulled me with a suspicious look.\u201cLet\u2019s go now, Han Yi-gyeol. You\u2019re done with your business.\u201dThat\u2019s true.\u201cWhere are you going? Give me your phone.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to give it to you. What an ignorant woman.\u201d\u201cWhether I\u2019m ignorant or not, who are you to keep interfering?\u201d\u201cBe, because he\u2019s my friend!\u201d\u201cWhat a friend. If you\u2019re going to lie, do it right.\u201dI rubbed my forehead and sighed. Why did this happen?\u201cBoth of you, stop.\u201d\u201cBut this woman!\u201d\u201cThis person keeps picking a fight!\u201dIn the end, it was my responsibility to manage the flow.\u201cBe quiet, Kim Woo-jin. When did I say you can step in? Unleash your abilities at will.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi. I can\u2019t give you the number right now due to circumstances. I will pass on the business through him.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s him\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who immediately recognized what I meant, made a displeased face.\u201cMaybe the situation is\u2026 Is it because of him?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dWhat is this again?\u201cI didn\u2019t see you like that, but I guess you think that it would severe your lover? You can\u2019t even save a girl\u2019s number.\u201d (\uadf8\ub807\uac8c \uc548 \ubd24\ub294\ub370 \uc560\uc778 \ub2e8\uc18d\uc774 \uc2ec\ud55c \ud3b8\uc778\uac00 \ubd10?, I\u2019m not sure about this but we could see for sure that Soo-yeon misunderstood Tae-hoon as Yi-gyeol\u2019s lover here)\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dMy mind went blank at the unexpected words. Kim Woo-jin, who was listening to Cha Soo-yeon with me, asked with an annoyed voice.\u201cWhat is that woman saying now?\u201dIt was then that I remembered what happened in the Roheon Guild hospital room that I had forgotten. Don\u2019t tell me the misunderstanding was still\u2026\u201cReally, it\u2019s ridiculous. Isn\u2019t that what you meant to ask for a number?\u201d\u201cNo, I know that. I know.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019m totally caught up. I see.\u201d\u201cSo this is a misunderstanding\u2026\u201dBefore I could finish my words, Cha Soo-yeon turned her back to her team. (\ud329\ud558\ub2c8, I don\u2019t understand this but I think it\u2019s her team or her pack)\u201cFirst of all, I have a schedule today, so I will go first. If there\u2019s anything else, he will do it! Contact me through him.\u201d\u201cNow, wait a minute\u2026\u201dAt the last words with sharp thorns, Cha Soo-yeon left me without any regrets.I looked at Cha Soo-yeon, who had gone away before I could even clear up the misunderstanding, but Kim Woo-jin opened his mouth in a harshly low voice from behind.\u201cLover?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was having a hard time figuring out where to start solving this situation.* * *After that, I returned to the room on the 23rd floor and had to suffer from Kim Woo-jin for over a day. Kim Woo-jin treated me with a very distrustful face.\u201cSo who is the lover she was talking about?\u201d\u201cIt is not a lover\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat does that woman mean, then?\u201d\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a misunderstanding\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat happened to make such a misunderstanding?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, the questions Kim Woo-jin asked were only vaguely answered. I was so embarrassed that I just scratched my cheek. In the end, there was only one answer I could give.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin looked at me like a traitor. At this point, I was rather curious.\u2018No, what if I had a real lover?\u2019Of course, I don\u2019t need a lover, but anyway.Even if I said it was a misunderstanding, they wouldn\u2019t believe me, so there was nothing more I could do. As my expression grew sour in real-time, Kim Woo-jin gently lowered his sharp eyes and started making excuses.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you\u2026\u201dYou don\u2019t believe it, do you?\u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Think as you please.\u201dI gave up trying to make him understand and got up. I was going to eat something simple and wash, but Kim Woo-jin grabbed my wrist.\u201cThat\u2019s so mean\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201dKim Woo-jin looked up at me with a gloomy face. It was as if he had done nothing wrong, but his eyes were full of unfairness as if I had scolded him.\u201cI took you home too and told you all the past I wanted to hide.\u201d\u201cYa, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYou just hide it from me. Do you still hate me?\u201dI think I\u2019ve heard this word before.\u201cSon of a bitch\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin bowed his head, muttering a curse in a melancholy voice.Are you crying? I sighed and lifted Kim Woo-jin\u2019s chin up.I looked closely at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face, who was bewildered by my actions. Well, fortunately, he didn\u2019t cry.\u201cI am really sorry. Kim Woo-jin, can\u2019t you believe me?\u201d\u201cUh? No\u2026 I, I believe you.\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s expression in answering was somewhat dazed.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later when the situation is settled. Then that\u2019s okay. Trust me now that I don\u2019t have a lover.\u201d\u201cUh, uh\u2026\u201dWhen I spoke softly as if to appease an adolescent child, Kim Woo-jin nodded his head, saying that he would understand. It was like this from the beginning. Kim Woo-jin looked like a high school student in his prime in many ways. Sensitive, emotional, and such.\u2018I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been living alone for a long time.\u2019Maybe it was because I had the same experience, so it was hard to put it down.When he let go of his chin, Kim Woo-jin covered his blushing face with his hand. Yeah, I\u2019m sure you think you should be ashamed of your whining behaviour.\u201cAre, are you going to tell me later? The first thing to me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI don\u2019t know when it will be, but.I retorted without sincerity and recalled Ha Tae-heon\u2019s cell phone hidden under the mattress. Come to think of it, I thought it was time to get in touch. I have to tell him the price\u2026\u201c\u2026aren\u2019t you hungry? What would you like me to make?\u201dKim Woo-jin pointed to the kitchen and asked if he liked my answer. Even if it wasn\u2019t, I was about to go out, so I accepted it.\u201cSomething simple to fill your stomach.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI looked at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s back as he walked towards the kitchen with joy. That guy, I don\u2019t know about anything else, but he\u2019s pretty good at cooking.* * *The next afternoon, a call came from Cheon Sa-yeon. When I went up to the representative room, there were Cheon Sa-yeon looking out the window in a black suit and Woo Seo-hyuk standing with a document.\u201cYou look very busy.\u201dAs Woo Seo-hyuk was watching, I opened the door with respect instead of half-talk, and Cheon Sa-yeon turned to me and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been busy at this time.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always been boring, but this time it\u2019s not, so it\u2019s good.\u201dSo what are you talking about?Cheon Sa-yeon sat down and beckoned to the sofa opposite him. As I sat down on the sofa, Woo Seo-hyuk approached and handed me the papers.\u201cIt turned out that abnormal movement was detected at the gate not only in Korea but also around the world.\u201d\u201cDo they have anything in common?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, not yet.\u201dI opened the papers. There, the gates included in Seoul were listed by section.\u201cYou can\u2019t check it from outside, so you\u2019ll have to go inside.\u201d\u201cIs this a list of gates that need to be cleared?\u201d\u201cYeah, just half of the gates in Seoul. I\u2019m planning to clear half of the gates within two months. The other half will be dealt with later.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s neat.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon slowly crossed his legs and looked at me. Why are you looking at me like that again? Cheon Sa-yeon said with his eyes fixed on me.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk, leave for a moment.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter a brief silence, Woo Seo-hyuk left the representative office.\u00a0Click. With the sound of the door closing, a quiet silence came.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who opened his eyes slowly, opened his mouth first.\u201cThere is something I need to point out at this point.\u201dHe was still smiling, but the atmosphere was different. I answered calmly, trying to avoid the growing tired eyebrows.\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cHow far are you planning to intervene?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIntervention. I put the papers I was holding down on the table. Intuitively, I felt that there was something else that Cheon Sa-yeon wanted to say.\u201cThat will depend on the situation.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the right answer.\u201dI swallowed a sigh.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for the past few days. About why you care about the gate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? You\u2019re just an independent A-rank talented person, but the fact that you\u2019re paying so much attention to the fact that the gate has changed. As far as entering the gate directly.\u201d\u201c\u2026you have too many useless interests in me.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s black eyes turned to me. It was a calm, yet ruthless look.\u201cAren\u2019t you expecting me to notice anyway?\u201dThat\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ask me like this.\u201cTell me, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon demanded firmly, perhaps noticing my attitude of trying to get over it.\u201cAs long as we are partners, we need to know what is important.\u201d\u201cI want to end the partnership.\u201d\u201cOh, my.\u201dHe laughed briefly. It seemed regrettable at first glance, but we both knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. It was also true that no matter how difficult Cheon Sa-yeon was, the information he brought was necessary.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not great.\u201dI struggled with how to organize it and explain it. He\u2019s not a good opponent to pass like Kim Woo-jin.\u201cI\u2019m just guessing.\u201d\u201cIf you guess\u2026 Is the gate the cause of the strange thing?\u201dTsk. I clicked my tongue. As expected, you knew everything. You have a really dirty personality.\u201cOkay, I think I\u2019m the cause.\u201d\u201cThe reason is?\u201d\u201cI accidentally touched something I shouldn\u2019t have touched.\u201dAn SS-grade coat that was taken out three months earlier. An unidentified S+ grade monster awakened in the process. Immediately after that, a monster exploded from the gate of the C13 Area, so the timing was perfect.\u2018Is that really a coincidence?\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon, who was lost in thought, tapped his finger on the knee at my words and opened his mouth not long afterwards.\u201cHave you ever heard of the butterfly effect?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cIt looks like that to me.\u201dWhat do you mean? When I frowned, Cheon Sa-yeon explained in a relaxed tone.\u201cJust because you touched something hidden doesn\u2019t me you\u2019re not going to twist this much.\u201dHidden? I looked at Cheon Sa-yeon calmly.If it was someone else, I would have just said it, but I was really concerned because my opponent was Cheon Sa-yeon. Maybe he even noticed about the SS-class coat.\u201cDon\u2019t beat around the bush, say it clearly.\u201d\u201cIf you are the cause, it\u2019s not because of any action, it\u2019s your existence.\u201dAt those words, one side of my heart became cold. I twisted the corners of my lips and smiled.\u201cExistence itself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an assumption to the end, but it doesn\u2019t seem like an impossible story. I\u2019m sure you already feel that.\u201dI lowered my gaze. I couldn\u2019t answer right away.\u201cIt\u2019s fun for me, so I don\u2019t care what the cause is. But I don\u2019t know if others will take it the same way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a boring threat before.\u201d\u201cThreat?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon raised the corners of his lips slightly.\u201cIs it a threat? It\u2019s a kind consolation that you can be honest in front of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dHe said in a very soft voice.\u201cI already know that a lot of you have changed. But that\u2019s it. Has anything changed between you and me?\u201d\u201cThat.\u201d\u201cYou are still tied to me, and I am the one who knows you best. More than anything.\u201dI wanted to deny it right away. But the tightly closed lips were unable to spit out a word.\u201cYou want it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou hope me to see you as \u2018you\u2019, not as Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dI couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and get up. I forced myself to swallow something that was shaking and opened my mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you know. I\u2026\u201dI\u2026 I couldn\u2019t finish my sentence.Emotions swirled in a complicated way. The desire to grab Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s collar and shout, and the desire to immediately turn around and run away coexisted.Cheon Sa-yeon slowly approached me, who was standing still, not knowing what to do. A white, outstretched hand ran across my neck and wrapped around the nape of my neck.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dWhat he said to me was too sweet. It was so sweet that it felt like poison.\u201cIt\u2019s an unavoidable instinct to want to be seen as the perfect you, not as someone else.\u201d\u201cI never asked for such consideration.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who came one step closer to me, wrapped around my waist. A cold perfume grazed the tip of my nose when I was held in his arms.\u201cIf you just wander around without taking care of yourself, you\u2019ll probably be the first to break down.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s funny to hear that from the person who treats me the worst.\u201d\u201cOh, my. Were you upset?\u201dI exhaled a shaky breath. It was very bittersweet to realize how careless I had been.\u300cYou alone have ruined everything.\u300dA mournful voice ran through my head. A feeling of despair that had been forgotten slowly swallowed up my body.I was fortunate to be embraced by Cheon Sa-yeon. I didn\u2019t want to show this face to anyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI grabbed the documents and lay down on the sofa. I fixed my gaze on the documents, but the contents did not enter my mind.After lying idly for a while, Kim Woo-jin, who had left the room saying he was going to his room for a while, came back. After getting used to Kim Woo-jin\u2019s behaviour by sticking to me, no matter what he did, I was the first to open my mouth.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThe cup in my room. And extra clothes.\u201d\u201cWhy are you bringing it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to leave it here.\u201dWhy would you leave it in my room\u2026?Regardless of whether it was absurd or not, Kim Woo-jin started moving the things in the Lululala (\ub8f0\ub8e8\ub784\ub77c,\u00a0Lululala\u00a0can be used in any sentence to show happiness) room one by one. This bastard, I think he only goes upstairs when he really sleeps.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who moved things freely, finally approached me. I was going to tell you anyway, so I handed over the documents to Kim Woo-jin.\u201cThis\u2026 Is this a list of gates?\u201d\u201cYeah. Did you hear that there was a problem with the gate?\u201d\u201cUng.\u201d\u201cThis is a summary of the gate list that needs to be cleared for two months\u2026 Among them, the gate marked in red is the guild that asked me to run as a mercenary.\u201d\u201cAll guilds except Blun requested two each.\u201dJayna sent two A-grade requests, while Roheon sent B-grade and A-grade requests. Requiem is A-grade and S-grade.\u2018I\u2019m sure Cheon Sa-yeon has checked it out.\u2019You made me suffer at the S-grade gate a while ago and ask for it again. You have no conscience.\u201cHow can they not reach you?\u201d\u201cThey requested it through Requiem. Cheon Sa-yeon was talking about it in the news that he was close with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin pouted his lips as if he didn\u2019t like it.\u201cLet\u2019s just ignore it.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, I shook my head.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can\u2019t go at all\u2026 I\u2019m going to get a suitable gate.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you not go?\u201dKim Woo-jin knelt on the floor under the sofa and looked at me. I couldn\u2019t be honest with him, so I gave an appropriate excuse.\u201cWell, first of all, it\u2019s the official recruitment of mercenaries. I will get the money.\u201d\u201cDo you need money?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to have.\u201dThere should be 100 million that Cheon Sa-yeon gave me, but I couldn\u2019t keep living in the Requiem Guild room. Even if there was no reason for that, if you save money, you will have a place to spend it.\u2018It\u2019s surprising that Cheon Sa-yeon gave me permission.\u2019I remembered Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face, who was smiling at me the day I was about to leave the representative room, saying that he was looking forward to which gate I would choose. I didn\u2019t know what he was thinking at the moment.\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s a great opportunity.\u2019It was an official schedule that allowed me to work confidently without paying attention to Cheon Sa-yeon. I didn\u2019t think it would be a bad idea to build a proper friendship with Ha Tae-heon by taking charge of the Roheon Guild gate.I got paid as a mercenary, checked the gates, and made a contact with the talented people. It\u2019s like a pumpkin coming in from a vine (it meant he got a lucky, the bigger one,\u00a0here).\u201c\u2026how much do you need?\u201dI was thinking of a plan to get the best compensation with minimal labour, but I turned my attention to Kim Woo-jin\u2019s words that I heard late.\u201cI didn\u2019t really set a specific amount\u2026 Why?\u201d\u201cI will earn it. So let\u2019s ignore the gate request. There\u2019s a lot of buzz about the gates being unstable, so why are you trying to get in dangerously?\u201dI frowned. This kid, don\u2019t tell me.\u201cHow are you going to make money? Are you trying to use your ability?\u201dKim Woo-jin hesitated and avoided my gaze. I smiled ridiculously.\u201cAren\u2019t you determined to never do that again?\u201d\u201cRight. I wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d\u201cBut why all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cYou said you need money.\u201d\u201cOkay. I need money, so why are you earning it?\u201dI honestly couldn\u2019t understand, so I asked, but Kim Woo-jin had wounded eyes.\u201cYou hated it enough to refuse even if you were threatened by a scumbag.\u201d\u201cI still hate it now.\u201dKim Woo-jin looked directly at me and said in a clear voice.\u201cBut you can do it if you want.\u201d\u201cKim Woo-jin.\u201dWhy would I want such a thing?I sighed and said.\u201cDon\u2019t do anything useless. I\u2019m not happy with the money I earned from that kind of work.\u201d\u201cThen what are we going to do to ignore the gate request?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going in no matter what, so give up.\u201dWhen I said firmly, Kim Woo-jin glared at me quite fiercely. Even so, I couldn\u2019t miss the pumpkin vines.\u201cThen I will go with you.\u201d\u201cWill it be\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s not like a dog begging to be taken to the owner when he goes to work. At this rate, I thought there would be no end to this, so I decided to hand over one job to Kim Woo-jin.\u201cKim Woo-jin, if you\u2019re really bored\u2026 please find out something for me while I\u2019m at the gate.\u201d\u201cUng?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s some information I\u2019d like to get. I was originally going to move on my own, but as you know, things are not going well right now.\u201dIt was difficult to fully trust the information given by Cheon Sa-yeon. In order not to depend on him, I had to acquire a useful informant.Kim Woo-jin, who lowered his gaze as if contemplating my words for a moment, asked in a calm voice.\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201dI was rather surprised by that statement. I thought you\u2019d be annoyed about how I did that.\u201c\u2026is it possible?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKim Woo-jin placed his hands on his thighs and looked at me with an obedient expression.\u201cTell me, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dIt was the first time I saw Kim Woo-jin like this. Kim Woo-jin raised the corners of his lips and smiled at me in embarrassment.\u201cWhatever it is, I will give you what you want.\u201d* * *The guild management headquarters acknowledged the fact that the gate was unstable and officially announced the gate management schedule for each guild. Maybe that was why it was noisy inside and outside the guild regarding the gate.\u201cWho is this? Isn\u2019t this our famous A-rank mercenary, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs I was just getting out of the elevator, I crumpled my face at the shrill voice coming from behind my back. When I turned my head, Park Geon-ho, as expected, was waving his hand at me with a smile.\u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me by a strange name.\u201dThere were already a lot of people around. Of course, Park Geon-ho was adamant despite my complaint.\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d\u201cWhat is correct about being hit?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen your face, isn\u2019t it too harsh?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m kind of a consistent person.\u201dI was ignoring it and going on my way, but Park Geon-ho chased after me and kept talking to me.\u201cYou never contacted me when you said you were going to meet me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any contact information.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you now, so you can take it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring my cell phone.\u201dActually, I brought it out, but I want to know something.I tried to approach Park Geon-ho to find out Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s past, but my plans went awry when the gate burst and the situation changed.There was no benefit in touching things unnecessarily. Once the problem from the gate was resolved, there would be room to look back on Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s past or Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s past.\u201cIt\u2019s so cold after shaking other people\u2019s hearts\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, come on.\u201dAs Park Geon-ho sniffed sadly, the female employees passing by glanced at us with strange eyes. This man really.When I got really annoyed, Park Geon-ho stopped pretending to cry and raised the corners of his lips.I swallowed the curse and sighed. Never mind. It\u2019s my loss if I get angry at this guy.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You seem to be in a very good mood.\u201d\u201cYou got me.\u201dHe shrugged and said softly.\u201cI just heard that the rating has been increased by one level as the gate becomes unstable.\u201d\u201cWhy on earth is that so good?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been a little bored these days.\u201dEww. I took a step away from Park Geon-ho. I think I could understand why this person was able to stay with Cheon Sa-yeon for a long time.\u201cDid the Team Leader also have a gate schedule?\u201d\u201cOf course. I got an S-grade one.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s S-grade, there could be S+ or SS-grade monsters, is that okay?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s quite a lot of people in there and there are healers. You will have to roll a little, but you won\u2019t die.\u201dIsn\u2019t that too carefree? Even if it was S+, the attack power would be cut in half.\u201cMaster will take care of it, but\u2026 If it\u2019s considered dangerous, he will assign two S-rank people.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s not bad.\u201dNodding my head, I found a familiar person passing by behind Park Geon-ho. A blunt face in a black suit. It was Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk turned his attention to my call. Woo Seo-hyuk, who had been lightly bowing towards me, noticed Park Geon-ho standing next to me and frowned slightly. What is it?\u201cAre you going out?\u201d\u201cYes. Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0is\u2026\u201d\u201cI was just coming in after finishing an outside schedule.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who approached me, made eye contact with Park Geon-ho for a moment as he answered my question. However, there was no greeting exchange between Woo Seo-hyuk and Park Geon-ho.\u2018What is it, this atmosphere?\u2019Unlike usual, Park Geon-ho only looked at Woo Seo-hyuk, but did not open his mouth first. Between Woo Seo-hyuk, who was so expressionless to the point of feeling stiff, and Park Geon-ho, who was smiling, I became extremely uncomfortable.\u201cDid you choose the gate?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I was about to go to the Roheon Guild.\u201dThere was nothing to hide, so I answered honestly.Yesterday, after thinking through the documents, I finally chose Roheon Guild\u2019s A-grade gate. It was the gate that Ha Tae-heon was most likely to participate in.When I called the number written next to the gate name and expressed my intention to participate, I got a reply saying that I would like to attend the meeting tomorrow.\u201cIf it\u2019s Roheon, it must be an A-grade gate.\u201dHow did you know? Your eyes are a ghost.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s appropriate. Above all, Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0does not belong to a guild, so it is better to experience various guilds and gates.\u201dWhile smiling awkwardly, Woo Seo-hyuk checked the time on his wristwatch and opened his mouth.\u201cI have a place to go to. So, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk said bid farewell to me as he did when he arrived and then left. Looking at Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s back, I asked Park Geon-ho quietly.\u201cAre you two having a bad relationship?\u201d\u201cWell, as you can see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s surprising. There are people who don\u2019t get along well with the Team Leader.\u201d\u201cHmm. Is that a compliment?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an insult, though.\u201dObjectively speaking, Park Geon-ho had a pretty decent personality. Although he was rumoured to be a bit funny, oddly enough. From what I had heard, he seemed to have a good relationship with his teammates.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like such a tight-knit type. It\u2019s frustrating when I look at it from the side.\u201d\u201cDid Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0stay in the guild for a long time?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s been like three years.\u201dSeeing the indifferent expression on his face, it seemed he was really not interested in it. Since Woo Seo-hyuk turned a blind eye to Park Geon-ho, so did they hate each other?\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say that you should go to the Roheon Guild? You\u2019re pretty relaxed.\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201dI didn\u2019t have a watch like Cheon Sa-yeon or Woo Seo-hyuk, so I took out my cell phone and checked the time. It was close.As I was contemplating whether it would be faster to fly or take a taxi, my phone fell out of my hand.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say. You said you didn\u2019t bring your phone?\u201dOops.Park Geon-ho laughed at me and saved the number in his cell phone. I took the phone back and said.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in advance, I will block you if you make unnecessary calls.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dLeaving behind Park Geon-ho, who smiled badly, I quickly left the guild.I happened to meet Park Geon-ho\u2026 I groaned and soared into the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was my third visit since I passed out.\u201cUgh, what is it?\u201dAs I was about to enter the front door, I was terrified to see the reporters surrounding the building. Why are there are so many of them?\u2018If I pass through them\u2026\u2019I\u2019m sure the reporters will catch me. Recalling the horrific interview experience I had in N42 Area, I found another entrance without question.Fortunately, there were several entrances as the building was large. I headed upstairs via the elevator in the underground parking lot.\u201cI heard that the situation is the same with the Reina (\ub808\uc774\ub098) Guild.\u201d\u201cThe Requiem dispatched people with mental abilities and kicked them out\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t we do the same?\u201dWhen I got off the elevator for officials and moved to the main hall, I could hear complaints from employees everywhere. It seemed pretty uncomfortable because of the reporters who camped in the building.I slowly looked around the first floor of the Roheon Guild, which was full of commotion. The atmosphere was definitely different from Requiem. Once again, I realized how quickly and skillfully Requiem dealt with it.While looking around, I found Ha Tae-heon standing near the entrance of the hall. Ha Tae-heon, dressed in a white shirt, was staring at reporters outside the building with an annoyed expression.Come to think of it, Ha Tae-heon hated reporters. In the novel, Ha Tae-heon hated reporters who were persistent and even caused friction several times.Even Ha Tae-heon, who ignored them so as not to harm the guild, was able to guess how bothersome reporters usually were.\u2018Should I say hello?\u2019Although I expressed my intention to participate in the gate, but it was not known whether Ha Tae-heon would join. But I can\u2019t just stand here all the time\u2026 I stopped the sound of footsteps and approached Ha Tae-heon.Well, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to just say that I\u2019m a fan and said I\u2019m happy to see him. Then asked him where the conference room was\u2026\u201cAh.\u201dAs I walked holding my breath, thinking about this and that, Ha Tae-heon turned his head with a flashing gaze. When I made eye contact with him, I was frozen in place like someone caught stealing.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t expect this situation.I stood awkwardly and looked at Ha Tae-heon. My mouth was completely dry from the awkwardness that came over me.Ha Tae-heon, who stared at me for a while, sighed and strode towards me.\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI asked the sudden question stupidly. I wasn\u2019t used to Ha Tae-heon\u2019s respectful words.\u201cYou said you would come, so we sent personnel to the entrance.\u201d\u201cAah.\u201dIt was then that I realized why there was no guide. There must be someone who came out to meet the reporters. I smiled at him with regret.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. The entrance looked so complicated, so I turned around and entered the underground parking lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026that\u2019s fine.\u201dEven if he said that, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s wrinkled forehead showed no sign of straightening. Um, did I just say that I had just come in through the entrance without any shame? (\u201c\uadf8\ub0e5 \ucabd\ud314\ub9bc\uc744 \ubb34\ub985\uc4f0\uace0 \uc785\uad6c\ub85c \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc62c \uac78 \uadf8\ub7ac\ub098, I don\u2019t understand this but this sentence fit well)\u201cFollow me. I will guide you to the conference room.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dHa Tae-heon pressed the elevator button in the centre of the hall. In the wide elevator that arrived soon after, only I and Ha Tae-heon got on.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA bitter silence fell. I coughed in vain and glanced at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s cold profile.\u2018Something\u2019s wrong\u2026\u2019Of course, it was true that we are in a situation where we have to act as if we have met for the first time, but more than that, I felt uncomfortable.I\u2019m just going to ask a quick question. Because now it\u2019s just the two of us.\u201cAhem, Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dTtiring\u2014This is on the 17th floor.What\u2019s with the timing? Ha Tae-heon looked back at me and nodded his head.\u201cGet off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs if I had not heard anything, I shut my mouth and got out of the elevator.\u2018What happened to him?\u2019It was too much to pretend not to know. What the hell? Is there any problem with the SS-class coat?While thinking about various things, I arrived at the conference room. As soon as I opened the door, the members of the Roheon Guild who had come first welcomed me.\u201cWelcome, Han Yi-gyeol-ssi. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Roheon Master Lee Joo-ha.\u201dLee Joo-ha, who was sitting at the top, approached me and smiled while asking for a handshake. She was quite different from when I came for a contract.\u201cThank you for your welcome. I\u2019m Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dI can\u2019t lose either. As I shook hands and smiled shamelessly, the corners of Lee Joo-ha\u2019s lips trembled slightly.\u201cSince Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0is also here, let\u2019s start the meeting.\u201dWhen I sat down on the empty seat, the attendant who was waiting in the back gave me the document. The document contained detailed information about the gate and a list of participating members.\u201cAs you all know, the gate we\u2019re going to clear this time is Area D17. Grade A gate is not that difficult, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being careful as the situation is.\u201dLee Joo-ha\u2019s cold voice, who led the meeting, had a boldness that grabbed attention.\u201cOur Deputy Master Ha Tae-heon will lead the team as the general manager. With trustworthy people and Han Yi-gyeol-ssi, we will be able to clear it without any major problems.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cWe will clean it up and come back!\u201dThe guild members, moved by Lee Joo-ha\u2019s words, exclaimed with excitement. I frowned.\u2018\u2026Deputy Master?\u2019I turned my head towards Ha Tae-heon. Just in time, I meet Ha Tae-heon, who was looking at me. I lowered my head slightly to hide my confused expression.Again. It was different from the original flow.I wanted to grab Ha Tae-heon by the collar and argue with him right away. While he hated such a position, why did he take it?I knew Lee Joo-ha was working hard to put him in the position of deputy master. She offered it whenever she had time and Ha Tae-heon rejected it over and over again.Ha Tae-heon believed in his own abilities and he was a personality that didn\u2019t bother with the position.Of course, after the passage of time and the influence of Cheon Sa-yeon had grown, he was seriously considering it\u2026\u2018No, I gave you the SS-class coat three months earlier. But why?\u2019\u2026is this because I moved differently from the original?\u201cThe departure is in three days. Please gather in front of the gate in Area D17 on time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201dI said goodbye to the members of the Roheon Guild who will clear the gate together while suppressing the complicated emotions.The mouth with a social smile on it got stiffer, but I did my best to keep it. I wanted to look good as they were the people who would clear the gate with Ha Tae-heon in the future.After greeting in a friendly atmosphere, the guild members rushed out of the conference room.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was standing at the entrance to the conference room at my call, looked back.It also shouldn\u2019t be like this. Even knowing that Lee Joo-ha was by his side, I opened my mouth without hesitation.\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s brow furrowed slightly.\u201cI think I can make that kind of request.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dHa Tae-heon stopped Lee Joo-ha, who was about to say something with a displeased face.\u201cPlease go ahead.\u201d\u201cBut Tae-heon-ah.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201dLee Joo-ha glared at me fiercely, but eventually withdrew due to Ha Tae-heon\u2019s tough attitude.\u00a0Click. When the door closed, only Ha Tae-heon was left in the spacious conference room.I was thinking about how to start a conversation, but surprisingly, Ha Tae-heon spoke up first.\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dHa Tae-heon used informal language to me as usual, but his cold eyes were still there.Of course, the relationship wasn\u2019t that good before. Still, I didn\u2019t feel this far away.I sighed and spoke in a voice that was as natural as possible.\u201cUm, first of all, congratulations on becoming Deputy Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no answer returned. I smiled awkwardly and rubbed the back of my neck.\u201cI thought Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0didn\u2019t like that kind of position because of your personality.\u201d\u201cI thought it was just a nuisance.\u201dHe came one step closer. There was still a shadow on the face looking down at me.\u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d\u201cI decided it was necessary, so I accepted it.\u201d\u2026so I guess there was a reason for that. I calmly counted the number of cases. Comparing the original and the present, is there anything that can influence Ha Tae-heon?\u2018Is that the gate?\u2019Maybe there is something wrong with the guild due to gate instability. Or to manage gates that had increased risk more thoroughly\u2026\u201cI would rather ask.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d like it because I accepted the position of Deputy Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026me? No. Of course, congratulations, but I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said you wanted to get away from the Requiem Master.\u201dI shuddered. I felt cold energy from Ha Tae-heon standing in front of me. I instinctively backed away from the tingling that touched my skin.\u201cYou said that Roheon needs to be stronger than he is now.\u201d\u201cWait, that\u2026\u201d\u201cI just chose the most obvious way for Roheon\u2019s rapid growth.\u201dI couldn\u2019t hide my confusion. So you accepted the offer to be deputy master?\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s not what I was hoping for. Even if you don\u2019t receive such a position, Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0will be able to\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s useless.\u201dHe cut me off with a displeased expression.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made because I wanted to hear your opinion. For now, it\u2019s rather suspicious. I wonder if what you said to me at that time was really true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s all that I have to say, I\u2019ll go first. I\u2019ll see you in three days.\u201dI couldn\u2019t catch Ha Tae-heon, who turned his back neatly without hesitation. Standing blankly until he closed the meeting room door and left, I covered my distorted eyes with my hand.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI exhaled a weary breath. Judging from Ha Tae-heon\u2019s attitude, it already seemed too late to turn back.\u300cIf you are the cause, it\u2019s not because of any action, it\u2019s your existence.\u300dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words came to mind. My mood sank endlessly. It felt as if something dark had swallowed it all under my feet.\u300cYou alone have ruined everything.\u300d\u300cIt must be your very existence.\u300dThe voice came out of nowhere. Words drawn from the past were tangled together in my mind. I closed my eyes tightly and opened them with a splitting headache. The smell of disinfectant wafted from somewhere.\u300cYou alone have ruined\u2026\u300d\u201cI know.\u201dI know. I know it well. More than anyone else.I slowly lowered the hand that was covering my face. My cold hands trembled slightly. Seeing that made me laugh somehow.\u2018Why am I like this\u2026?\u2019Will it be the same? Same as always. Now I want to change.I forcibly moved my heavy legs and left the conference room. The past, which was so dense behind my back, had persistently followed me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPerhaps it was because Ha Tae-heon refused to be interviewed in advance, the reporters were not seen. The atmosphere around the gate, where only officials gathered, was good without any noise.\u201cThe schedule will run for a total of three days, and unless there is nothing else, the queue will remain as it is. We\u2019ll be leaving in 10 minutes. Please check your items carefully.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was at the forefront, finished his briefing. Sitting in the middle of the queue, I waited quietly while others busily organized their equipment.\u201cYo.\u201dThe man standing next to me and rummaging through his bag called me.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t attend the last meeting. Nice to meet you.\u201dHis name is Kim Soo-hwan (\uae40\uc218\ud658), who was described as a B-rank talented person, held my hand and shook it a couple of times.\u201cI wanted to meet you after watching the video. I heard you were close with the Requiem Guild Master?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing particularly close\u2026\u201d\u201cEi, rumours have spread. Besides, you\u2019re a mercenary. If only I had the ability, I would have been promoting without an affiliate. It\u2019s a dream.\u201dEven though I didn\u2019t respond much, Kim Soo-hwan chimed in with excitement. As the departure time approached, he put a bunch of chocolate on my hand.\u201cDo you like sweets? When you enter the gate, you feel tired and stressed. I eat one each time.\u201dSweets\u2026Come to think of it, I hadn\u2019t been able to eat whole snacks these days, so I was really happy with the chocolate he gave me. When I peeled a piece of chocolate and put it in my mouth, the sweet flavour spread.\u201cThank you.\u201dIt felt like I was a little relieved from my gloomy mood. When I smiled sincerely, Kim Soo-hwan also smiled and confidently told me to trust only himself for snacks in the future.He is a good man. As I rolled a square piece of chocolate into my mouth, I suddenly felt a gaze from the side. When I turned my head, I saw Ha Tae-heon looking at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dI wondered if he had something to say, but Ha Tae-heon immediately turned away from me. What.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe guild member standing next to Ha Tae-heon shouted loudly. After confirming that the preparations were complete, Ha Tae-heon went through the gate without hesitation.Following the line into the gate, I frowned at the bright light.Thump.A white, hard marble floor spread wide and in the centre stood a huge statue of a goddess holding a sword. The colourful stained glass surrounding the room shone brilliantly and golden statues with angel wings were seen below it.\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing? This is the only gate with this kind of atmosphere.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201dI looked up at the ceiling so high that I could not see the end and nodded my head. It felt strange to see the goddess statues with delicate patterns and arrogant expressions engraved on the marble walls.The interior of the gate where monsters appeared was filled with a noble atmosphere.Ha Tae-heon led everyone past the statue and walked towards the front. After moving for some time, several huge doors that were invisible with their backs to the statue of the goddess appeared through the pure white mist.\u201cFrom now on, we will divide into two teams and move. There might be something wrong with the monster level, so don\u2019t relax.\u201dTeam 1 and Team 2 were divided from the point where I was standing. As the first team, Kim Soo-hwan and I entered the first room together with Ha Tae-heon.When Ha Tae-heon, standing in front of the thick marble door, pressed the blue jewel embedded in the centre, white marble powder fell and the door slowly opened.As I entered the room, the candle lit by itself and the door closed. The bodies that had been lying on the floor squirmed and got up.Swoosh\u2014 swoooosh\u2014A mummy, wearing a pure white robe engraved with a gold pattern, looked at us with a bizarre sound. A gleam of light flashed across its twisted face.\u201cClose team, forward.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cLet the long-distance team protect the healer.\u201dSararak, black dust gathered. Ha Tae-heon grabbed a sword made of dust and cut off the mummy that came close to his nose. The mummy, which had just collapsed, turned into a pure white powder and scattered. At first glance, it resembled marble powder.The battle began in earnest as long-distance talented people including me stopped them. The guild members, each holding weapons, poured their abilities and destroyed the mummy. Mummies, who were weak even for a B-rank, collapsed without being able to attack properly.\u201cAs expected, Deputy Master. So cool\u2026\u201dKim Soo-hwan, who was standing next to me and watching the battle, muttered in a moved voice.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Deputy Master so great?\u201d\u2026what did you do?I was taken aback for a moment, but I nodded my head.\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, the Requiem Master is great, but our Deputy Master is no joke either. You may not know, Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0as this is the first time we met. Haha!\u201dIt was then that I found out who Kim Soo-hwan was. This person is a big fan of Ha Tae-heon.A person similar to Kim Soo-hwan appeared several times in the novel. Most were women, but not without men. Come to think of it, I heard that he had many fan cafe members.\u2018Wait, then\u2026 Are there any big fans of Cheon Sa-yeon?\u2019I shook my head at the terrible thought. I never wanted to meet them in my life.\u201cLet\u2019s start measuring.\u201dWhen all the monsters died and turned to powder, the measuring ability with the healers ran to the centre. The person with the ability to measure with his hand on the powder closed his eyes for a moment and then opened it.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with it.\u201d\u201cAre you saying the numbers are the same as last time?\u201d\u201cYes. Although it increased by 0.5%\u2026 Changes like this often happen.\u201dIt was a fortunate result. The team immediately finished cleaning up and left the room. The jewel stuck in the centre of the door no longer shone as it did when we entered but dimmed. It seemed that if all the monsters were dealt with, the state of the jewels would change as well.Following the first team, the second team managed to handle the monsters and got out of the room safely. The S-rank guild member in charge of the second team reported to Ha Tae-heon in a calm voice.\u201cAs expected, a B-grade skeleton appeared. The measurement results remain the same.\u201dHa Tae-heon nodded and said.\u201cThen it would be better to keep the team going.\u201d\u201cYes. It seems that there is no problem with this gate.\u201dAs I watched the conversation between the two, I turned around, startled by the chilling sensation that hit my back at the moment.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dI caressed the cold nape of my neck and looked at the statue slowly. The statue of the goddess standing with a sword had not changed from the first time I saw it.\u2018Is it because of my mood?\u2019It was difficult to take my eyes off of the goddess statue in a strange feeling. After I stared at the goddess statue for a while, Kim Soo-hwan grabbed my arm and pulled me out saying that we had to leave.Like in the first room, when he pressed the blue jewel, the ground vibrated and the door opened. Perhaps because they thought there was no problem with the gate, the team members entered the room with a much more relaxed expression than before.As I entered the room with my teammates, someone grabbed my wrist. The owner of the strong and large hands was Ha Tae-heon. The leather of the black half-palm gloves he was wearing was clearly felt.\u201c\u2026what is it?\u201d\u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201dHa Tae-heon, who lowered his head slightly, whispered in a low voice. When I tried to pull my wrist reflexively due to the sense of closeness, Ha Tae-heon held it even harder.I looked at the guild members around me and said quickly.\u201cLet it go.\u201d\u201cAnswer me first.\u201dFortunately, this room was very dark with no lights on. I heard people looking for things to brighten up the surroundings.\u00a0Kugugung, when the open door closed, nothing was seen except Ha Tae-heon\u2019s face.\u201cNot really, it doesn\u2019t matter. Just\u2026\u201d\u201cSay it. I\u2019ll decide whether it\u2019s a big deal or not.\u201dI frowned. I couldn\u2019t understand Ha Tae-heon\u2019s tenacity.\u201cNothing really\u2014\u201d\u201cI found a device that turns on the light!\u201dA light was lit up in the room while I was answering. As I hurriedly pushed Ha Tae-heon away, Kim Soo-hwan spoke in a bewildered voice.\u201cDeputy Master?\u201d\u201c\u2026let the close team at the back and the long-distance team follow me.\u201dHa Tae-heon passed me by ordering as if nothing had happened. After that, Kim Soo-hwan whispered to me.\u201cHey, Yi-gyeol-ssi. What did the Deputy Master do? I thought you were talking.\u201d\u201cNo. What\u2019s there for the Deputy Master to talk to me about?\u201d\u201cReally? I must have misread it.\u201dKim Soo-hwan, who was nodding his head, accepted my answer with a look that said yes. I was glad he was simple.\u201cIn line with the long-distance team.\u201dSomething wavy appeared from the pure white wall in front. A monster with an opaque and limp body looked similar to a stingray swimming in the sea.A B-grade monster spewed poison, Shriker (\uc26c\ub9ac\ucee4). In the case of this monster, the blood also contained poison, so the closer it got, the more dangerous it was. Dozens of Shrikers found us trembling and emitting white poisonous smoke.Chwiiiik\u2014I knew what to do without Ha Tae-heon\u2019s command. I raised my ability and gathered dozens of poisonous smoke in one place.\u201cAttack.\u201dAs soon as the pale azure curtain was erected, the powerful men attacked the Shriker.Kim Soo-hwan also swung the transparent, thin fishing line he was holding in his hand towards Shriker. Then the Shriker was cut into several pieces as if cut by a sword.Siiiit! Siiik!The white blood of the poison-filled Shriker splashed here and there, but it was all blocked by an open azure curtain. When all the Shrikers died, the poison smoke I was holding slowly disappeared.\u201cI will take the shield. Back off.\u201dThe poison smoke, which was Shriker\u2019s ability, disappeared, but the blood remained. When all the guild members stepped down, the shield-talented man carefully reaped his abilities.\u201cHey, you did a great job.\u201d\u201cAs expected, Shriker is a B-grade and it\u2019s difficult to deal with.\u201dThe close team who was watching the returning long-distance team welcomed them. Meanwhile, the person with the ability to measure who finished measuring near the blood of the Shriker told Ha Tae-heon.\u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d\u201cJust in case, keep continuing to measure the rest of the room.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI forgot the chocolate I got from Kim Soo-hwan earlier and thought.\u2018Certainly, each guild has a different fighting style and atmosphere.\u2019Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s words that it would be better to experience different guilds and gates made sense. The clear team led by Cheon Sa-yeon was free and individual, while the clear team led by Ha Tae-heon was more organized and orderly.\u2018Neither of them is bad.\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon had a hard time, instead of having fun and Ha Tae-heon was comfortable, instead of a little bored. Should I say that I could see the leader\u2019s personality? (\ub9ac\ub354\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc774 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\uace0 \ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub098, not sure how to translate here)\u201cSecond team, this room has also been cleaned up. There\u2019s nothing special.\u201dWhen I came out of the room, the second team who came out first reported. Ha Tae-heon nodded his head and opened his mouth to the guild members.\u201cWe will rest here. Check your weapons and don\u2019t go too far.\u201dThe guild members sighed and sat down. I glanced around and slowly slipped back.I\u2019ll have to check the goddess statue properly during this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I saw the guild members resting, from over the goddess statue, looked small.\u201cIf you look at it this way, it\u2019s just an ordinary statue, but\u2026\u201dWas the horror I felt earlier was due to my mood? The goddess statue carved out of marble was delicately sculpted down to every hair, giving it a lively feeling as if it were alive.I kept snooping around the statue like a fly hovering around a person, but I didn\u2019t find anything particularly special.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dI guess it was an illusion. It\u2019s ridiculous to keep doubting a normal statue. I sighed, turned off my ability and went downstairs.\u201cHuh?\u201dSomething round was trampled on the floor on the right side of the statue. When I leaned down and looked closely, I saw a blue jewel. It looked just like the jewel that was embedded in the door. Why is this here?Geugeuk.At that moment, a strange sound was heard from somewhere. I frowned and looked around, but there was no problem.\u2018Did I hear it wrong?\u2019I scratched the back of my head for nothing, leaving the goddess statue behind and moved.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi! Where have you been? I\u2019ve been looking for you for a while.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhen I appeared, Kim Soo-hwan started talking to me as if he was waiting.\u201cI made some simple soup. It\u2019s mealtime. But there\u2019s nothing left now\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine.\u201dI don\u2019t really feel hungry at all. It didn\u2019t matter that it wasn\u2019t a big deal to skip a meal. I smiled at Kim Soo-hwan, who was sorry and said not to worry about it, but something flew away from the other side.\u201cAh.\u201dReflexively I accepted. It was a wrapped sandwich.\u201cEat it.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who threw the sandwich at me, said in a hard voice. It\u2019s really good. I guess I just made you worry.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Yi-gyeol-ssi. If you\u2019re hungry later, it\u2019s hard to keep up. And Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0needs to eat some. You\u2019re too skinny.\u201dKim Soo-hwan, who looked at Ha Tae-heon with sparkling eyes, nagged with a stern expression.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Look, your wrist. I can hold it all in one hand.\u201dKim Soo-hwan grabbed my wrist and chattered. Isn\u2019t the wrist the part that can be held in one hand?\u2018Han Yi-gyeol doesn\u2019t look good.\u2019He is too skinny. For a man, his skin is too white. Should I go to the beach in summer and burn it on purpose?\u201cKim Soo-hwan-ssi.\u201dI just nodded my head to Kim Soo-hwan\u2019s words while thinking of something else, but Ha Tae-heon interrupted with a cold voice.\u201cAren\u2019t you too rude? Let go of your hand.\u201d\u201cHuh, yes! I\u2019m sorry. Sorry, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dKim Soo-hwan was embarrassed by the chilling point that came to the bone and released my wrist. At the same time, I was perplexed.\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dIn this situation? All of sudden?\u2018Crazy. What\u2019s wrong?\u2019I glanced at Kim Soo-hwan and shook my head, but Ha Tae-heon didn\u2019t care and only sent a glance, asking what I was doing. Ha, I can\u2019t honestly say no.In the end, I left behind Kim Soo-hwan, who had become gloomy, and followed Ha Tae-heon. Kim Soo-hwan\u2019s expression did not look good at his idol\u2019s voices he heard.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, wait a minute.\u201dI almost ran after Ha Tae-heon, who was walking with long legs. The place where he stopped and stood was behind a large pillar, where the light did not reach and a thick shadow was cast.Ha Tae-heon looked down at me after confirming that the distance with the guild members had widened to a certain extent. His expression was not much different from his usual expression, but looking at his cold eyes, it was clear that he was in a bad mood.\u201cIs this okay? If you talk to Kim Soo-hwan-ssi\u00a0like that\u2026\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019ve just become friends. You worry about him unnecessarily.\u201d\u201cWho am I friends with? I\u2019m talking about Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u2019s attitude.\u201d\u201cWhat about my attitude?\u201d\u201cAre you asking because you don\u2019t know? Even in the Shriker room earlier.\u201d\u201cAs long as we entered the gate together, it is more unnatural to not care.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses. Are you the type of person who gives someone a sandwich because someone you don\u2019t know has skipped a meal?\u201dHa Tae-heon raised his eyebrows at my words and pointed to the sandwich.\u201cYou spoke well. Others eat everything on time, but where are you and what have you been doing, so you can\u2019t do that?\u201d\u201cShould I even report what I did during my break? And it\u2019s okay to skip over one meal.\u201d\u201cAre you proud of skipping meals on a topic that you\u2019re already squeaky? Stop talking nonsense and eat right now.\u201dHow do you eat in this situation? I handed him the sandwich I was holding.\u201cI don\u2019t like it. Just take it. I don\u2019t even have an appetite.\u201d\u201cEat it yourself before I force you.\u201d\u201cI said I didn\u2019t need it.\u201dAs I refused firmly, an ominous light flashed in Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes. Ha Tae-heon grabbed my neck as I instinctively tried to step back.\u201cUgh, what\u2014\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u201dI grabbed Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arm and gave it strength, but I couldn\u2019t escape. His arm felt as hard as a rock.While I was struggling, Ha Tae-heon, who took the sandwich, ripped open the wrapping paper with his teeth.\u201cWa, wait a\u2026\u201dWere you serious when you said you will force me to eat? This crazy!\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, wait a minute. I\u2019ll eat it. Let this go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be deceived by such obvious lies. Open your mouth.\u201dA sandwich with the wrapping paper removed came to my mouth. I shook my head in fright, but Ha Tae-heon looked at me with an expression that he would keep this posture forever until I eat it.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi\u2026 I was wrong. If you let it go, I will eat it with my own hands. I\u2019m not lying.\u201dThis can\u2019t. I changed my method and began to beg to Ha Tae-heon with a very sad and pitiful expression. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s forehead twitched when I appealed to him to let me go with my eyes full of sincerity. Is it working?\u201cThis is the last time. Open your mouth. If you don\u2019t open it again\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, oh! I got it. Open it, open it!\u201dYou\u2019re stubborn bastard that it\u2019s annoying! I closed my eyes tightly and opened my mouth as slowly as possible. Then the sandwich came between my lips.\u201cChew and swallow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShit, bastard.My face heated up at the words he said as if he was teaching a child. I felt like I was going to die from shame. It was fortunate that a large pillar covered Ha Tae-heon. I didn\u2019t want to show anyone this ugly face.\u201cUup, wait, slow down\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you want.\u201dThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to eat it myself! I tried to look at Ha Tae-heon with resentment, but he firmly shoved a sandwich into my mouth.Munch munch\u2026\u201cIt takes a year to eat just one sandwich.\u201dMunch\u2026Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t answer because I was eating. Fortunately, Ha Tae-heon lightly grabbed my neck and I could swallow it.\u201cIs it because your mouth is small?\u201dNo matter what Ha Tae-heon mumbled, I was absorbed in chewing. I was full of thoughts of wanting to get away from Ha Tae-heon as soon as possible.When I barely chewed the whole sandwich and swallowed it, Ha Tae-heon released my neck. Ha Tae-heon laughed as he saw me tapping my chest, which had become cramped from eating in a hurry.\u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s be patient.I asked, tidying up the messy collar.\u201c\u2026weren\u2019t you dissatisfied with me? Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d\u201cDissatisfied?\u201d\u201cThe Roheon Guild used to make such a fuss, but now I\u2019ve skipped meals, so they take care of me. Which rhythm should I match to?\u201d\u201cMatch the rhythm.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who looked at me with a sad expression, answered.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you were willing to match it.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Ha Tae-heon-ssi, I could provide enough service for that level, but I don\u2019t think you want it very much.\u201d\u201cIt will be fun to watch.\u201dI sighed and said in a tired voice.\u201cI\u2019m suspicious that you\u2019re going to find it hard to believe in me. I know it well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut this attitude doesn\u2019t help anything. For Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dHe cut me off. The words that I could help with anything that I couldn\u2019t spit out lingered in my mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t care what you are hiding. I just want to know if you\u2019re a good guy. I will make that decision on my own.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha Tae-heon-ssi, I\u2014\u201dI hesitated for a moment.\u201cI thought that Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0and I at least had enough trust to make a deal.\u201dIt was not that I didn\u2019t know Ha Tae-heon\u2019s position. It\u2019s been the worst since I first met him. I know it all. I know.\u2018It\u2019s still sad. I mean it.\u2019In my heart, I wanted to tell you everything if I could. How sincerely I supported and liked Ha Tae-heon.\u201cBut now that I see it, it seems that I was the only one who thought so.\u201dIf you can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s probably right to back off. It\u2019s ridiculous to force someone to believe in you.I focused my eyes on Ha Tae-heon, who was listening to me without any reaction.\u201cDo you remember the terms of the contract? You said that if I provide an S-class or higher item, you will get one thing I want.\u201d\u201cI remember.\u201d\u201cWhat I want, I will tell you now.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to tell you this way, but I can\u2019t help it. It would be better to keep things neatly organized.\u201cYou will have a schedule in China in three months.\u201dHa Tae-heon frowned at my words.\u201cThere, you will meet a prophet who can see the future. Just give me information about him.\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re sure. I will meet the Prophet.\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201dSince the flow of the original has changed a lot since I intervened, there was a possibility that he wouldn\u2019t meet. Still, there was nothing to lose by saying it first.\u201cIf you can\u2019t meet him then, please let me know when we meet at any time after that.\u201d\u201cFrom what I hear to what you say, it seems that you are the prophet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not a prophet, how do you know the future?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen I apologized while avoiding his gaze, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s expression became even colder.\u2018There is a novel that I enjoyed reading, and you\u2019re the main character of the novel\u2026 If I tell the truth, what kind of reaction will you have?\u2019If you do well, you\u2019ll be treated like a madman. It\u2019s not much different from now.\u201cPlease keep the contract. If you do that, I will not interfere with Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0anymore.\u201d\u201cHa, yes. Contract.\u201dHa Tae-heon spat out the words like he was chewing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m curious as to how far your words are true.\u201dHa Tae-heon turned his back and walked out of the pillar. Being left alone, I took a deep breath that I had been holding back.That\u2019s why I tried to talk about the contract slowly when things got better. It\u2019s all gone wrong.The Prophet didn\u2019t sit still in one place but travelled around China, so I needed Ha Tae-heon\u2019s help to meet him. If it went according to the original story, Ha Tae-heon would definitely meet the prophet.\u2018It\u2019s bothering me.\u2019Now, it had become difficult to openly help Ha Tae-heon. Well, I guess I\u2019ll have to secretly help out from behind.Brushing off my clothes one last time, I slowly walked out of the pillar.I sighed at the situation where I had to go around the gate for three days with Ha Tae-heon, who became furious. I hope everything\u2019s fine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed satisfied with the fact that he had a conversation with Ha Tae-heon.\u201cDid you just see it? Ha Yi-gyeol-ssi? That clean and neat move!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 yes.\u201dI killed the spider that rushed back roughly. I wanted to stop paying attention to Ha Tae-heon for a moment, but even that it was not easy because Kim Soo-hwan kept making a fuss to looking at him.\u201cThat\u2019s why. Our Deputy Master is so popular, right? Last time, the female employee\u2026\u201d\u201cKim Soo-hwan-ssi.\u201dDuring the break after dealing with all the monsters, I cut off Kim Soo-hwan\u2019s words and asked.\u201cI heard that Deputy Master also has a fan cafe. Is it real?\u201dAnyway, if I\u2019m going to have a conversation with Ha Tae-heon, I\u2019ll have to ask anything I\u2019m curious about. Kim Soo-hwan smiled brightly at my question and grabbed my shoulder strongly.\u201cOf course, it is! Are you interested, Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cYeaah\u2026\u201dI nodded my head, avoiding his burdensomely twinkling eyes.\u201cAs expected! I thought Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0would recognize the charm of our Deputy Master!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen we get out of the gate, I will send you an invitation. Once you receive it, you can sign up immediately. It is difficult to find publicly because it is a cafe where only real people gather.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI nodded in surprise. It was a recommendation system where you could only join if you had an invitation. I\u2019m glad I brought it up.More than that, the invitation\u2026How are you going to send it?\u2018I\u2019ve seen something similar before.\u2019I remembered that a man who had been in and out of the management bar offered a black invitation card. Then he told me to come to play golf.Is it the same way here? Surely\u2026 It\u2019s the place where Ha Tae-heon\u2019s fans gather, so it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be an ordinary place.\u201cIf you send it, I will be grateful. I\u2019ve been interested in it ever since.\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s good. I can\u2019t believe Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0will become the same Haning (\ud5c8\ub2dd\uc774, it seems that Tae-heon\u2019s fans called themselves as Haning, \u201cHa\u201d from Tae-heon\u2019s surname \u201c\ud558\u201d, the detail\u2019s\u00a0here)!\u201dHaning? Before I even asked what it was, Kim Soo-hwan put his arms around my shoulders and exclaimed the rules of the cafe. This time, there were a lot of words I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cJust because the Deputy Master said that he was going to take a pictorial next month, we decided to pay tribute together. Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0can also participate.\u201d\u201cA tribute?\u201dWhat is it?As I was confused, Kim Soo-hwan nodded his head with an understanding face.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, is this your first time? When I was just starting out being a fanatic, there were a lot of things I didn\u2019t know.\u201dWhat else is being a fanatic?\u201cThe tribute is, um, all members prepare and give gifts to the Deputy Master. You can think of it something like that.\u201dOh. They gave him gifts too. Very interesting.\u201cYou know, the Deputy Master is very kind, unlike what he looks like, right? He always said thank you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so much better to prepare.\u201d\u201cWhat do you usually give as a gift?\u201d\u201cEvery time it\u2019s different, it\u2019s like a luxury item or a lunch box\u2026 They even send him a food truck during the photoshoot.\u201dI don\u2019t know anything else, but I know if it\u2019s a luxury item. In other words, you have to give him something expensive.\u2018It\u2019s like sending a gift to someone in a business relationship. The price will be sincere.\u2019It was convenient to have someone next to me to tell me everything. For the first time since I became Han Yi-gyeol, I became curious about the other person\u2019s contact information.\u201cKim Soo-hwan-ssi, can you give me your number when we leave the gate later?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Of course, I\u2019ll let you know. Now we\u2019re going to be the same Haning!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAre you going to tell me anyway? I smiled contentedly. It wasn\u2019t bad if it was Kim Soo-hwan as the first friend of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s life.* * *By the second day after entering the gate, the number of rooms processed was over 10.In the meantime, I also got to know some other guild members.I didn\u2019t really do anything, but Kim Soo-hwan dragged me everywhere he went, so I naturally greeted and talked to them.When this happened, another problem arose. Whether he was dissatisfied with me getting close to the Roheon guild members, Ha Tae-heon kept staring at me with a cold look.\u201cHey, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dAs I lowered my gaze at the hesitant call, I was given the soup bowl he was holding.\u201cThis is the soup I just made. Would you like some?\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dThis person\u2019s name is Baek Da-yeon (\ubc31\ub2e4\uc5f0). As a talented member of the long-distance team, he used to be around me and take care of things since I became a member.When I received the soup bowl, Baek Da-yeon smiled with a slightly relieved expression. It was awkward for me too, but I smiled at him.\u2018Here again.\u2019The gaze I felt behind my back from the moment I received the soup bowl became even more intense when Baek Da-yeon and I smiled at each other. I looked back because I wanted to get my back pierced.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven though he was caught staring at me, Ha Tae-heon didn\u2019t shyly avert his gaze. That\u2019s absurd. No matter how unreliable I may be, what is it that he hated me being so close to guild members?I don\u2019t think he was that petty in the novel. I sighed, turned away from Ha Tae-heon, and ate the soup. It\u2019s my fate.After a quick meal, Ha Tae-heon divided the guild members into team 1 and team 2 to handle the remaining rooms. Again, I was the first team led by Ha Tae-heon.Ha Tae-heon, standing at the entrance of the 14th room, pressed the jewel and the door opened. Standing at the far end and following my teammates into the room, I noticed a jewel embedded in the door flashing red.\u2018What?\u2019Obviously, it was blue until Ha Tae-heon opened the door.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, what are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026no. I\u2019m coming.\u201dAt Kim Soo-hwan\u2019s call, I entered the room before the door closed.\u2018Why did it turn red all of a sudden?\u2019I\u2019m afraid this\u2026 I should report it to Ha Tae-heon. There might be problems.I looked around looking for Ha Tae-heon, but the guild members said in a confused voice.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I see the monster?\u201d\u201cWhat was the monster in this room?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a poison-tooth worm (\ub3c5\uc774\ube68 \ubc8c\ub808\uc694). It should be on the wall\u2026\u201dThe interior, which filled with white light more than any other room, was empty. The guild members, who suddenly had nothing to do, lowered their weapons and murmured.\u201cThen how do we get out?\u201d\u201cThe door won\u2019t open now, will it?\u201d\u201cOh, my God.\u201dAs expected, was that red jewel some kind of device?I walked passing them and hurried to Ha Tae-heon, who was standing in the deepest part.\u201cDeputy Master.\u201dAs I approached, Ha Tae-heon raised an eyebrow. Then he opened his mouth in a hard voice.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis guy. I want to keep ignoring him. I can\u2019t help but report.I forcefully raised the corners of my mouth and said with a smile.\u201cI have something to tell you. The jewel in the door\u2026\u201dKkigigik.I paused for a moment. What did I hear just now?I looked around, but nothing had changed. When I interrupted my speech, Ha Tae-heon urged me.\u201cWhat about the jewels? I\u2019ll tell you in advance, but you can\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know. Why would I take such a thing?\u201dJewels that blocked the room where monsters come out, it\u2019s very uncomfortable. The specifications were here.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m going to take the jewel, it\u2019s because the condition seems to have changed.\u201d\u201cCondition?\u201d\u201cYes. The colour of the jewel has changed. Red\u2026\u201dKugugung! Rattle!I couldn\u2019t finish the conversation. As soon as an ominous sound was heard from the floor, the floor on which Ha Tae-heon was standing disappeared in an instant. Ha Tae-heon, who was looking at me, fell into a black hole that suddenly appeared.\u201c\u2014Ha Tae-heon!\u201d\u201cKyaaa!\u201d\u201cWh, what!\u201d\u201cDeputy Master!\u201dI hurriedly stretched out my arm, but I was unable to catch him with a spur of the moment.Damn it! Without hesitation, I threw myself into the hole. The screams and shouts of the guild members resounded.\u201cHa Tae-heon!\u201dWith my back against the light pouring from above, I reached out as hard as I could to catch Ha Tae-heon, who was being eaten into the darkness.\u201cHOLD!\u201dHa Tae-heon, with a frown on his forehead, barely caught me. Even in the midst of an emergency, I felt a sense of relief in his hand holding me.\u2018Ability\u2026!\u2019Hwiiiing!I tried to stop the falling body by pulling up the wind, but it didn\u2019t work like I wanted it to. It felt like something was pulling us down. I couldn\u2019t stop the fall with my own strength.I clenched my teeth and raised my ability to the max. The bracelet trembled as an enormous amount of energy was used.\u201cUugh, a little\u2026! Bit!\u201dEven the wind that supported the body swayed unstable. Ha Tae-heon also tried to make a foothold using dust like me but failed repeatedly. My wind and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s black dust barely maintained their shape and enveloped us.Kuung!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cKeuk!\u201dAs soon as the ability succeeded, my body hit the floor. Had it been a little late, I would have died instantly or was seriously injured. A cold sweat broke out.\u201cUh, are you all right?\u201dIt was not easy to check Ha Tae-heon\u2019s condition because he was in the dark without a single light. I stuttered my hand on the floor, but somehow it was warm and soft.\u201c\u2026move away.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dThe voice sounded pretty close, but nothing was visible. I frowned and brought my face closer to the direction the voice came from.Ha Tae-heon, who had much better eyesight than the general public, said as if threatening in a much lower voice than before whether he could see what was ahead unlike me.\u201cMove.\u201d\u201cNo, even if you say \u2018move\u2019, you have to be able to see\u2026\u201dI touched the floor as carefully as possible. I felt a round curve. There is something between the legs that are spread apart. What the hell? When I moved my legs to lift up my body, the floor trembled.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon took a deep breath and used his ability. The dust that flew from somewhere in the sky began to shine white. Then the dark eyes in front of my eyes brightened a little.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI realized then. My body was crouching with Ha Tae-heon\u2019s face, close enough to feel the sound of breathing. I thought it was a strange-looking floor, but it was, so that\u2026\u201c\u2026move away.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dI pulled off my hands from Ha Tae-heon\u2019s chest, which I had rubbed to my heart\u2019s content because I thought it was the floor, and raised my upper body hurriedly. It was Ha Tae-heon\u2019s lower body when I saw what was in between the legs.As soon as I got up and took a step backwards, Ha Tae-heon also scrambled to get up. Both of us received the shock of falling, so it seemed uncomfortable even for an SS-rank body.\u201cGreat, so.\u201dI coughed in the awkward air and opened my mouth first.\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dWell. If I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have been hurt.\u201cThe jewel stuck in the door has turned red. I think it has something to do with this situation.\u201dWe must have fallen deep enough, and even I looked up, I couldn\u2019t see the entrance. The only thing that could light up the surroundings was Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sparkling dust.I stretched my arms out wide. Fortunately, I could feel the wall on both sides. Is it a hallway?\u201cLet\u2019s move on. If we were to stay here the whole time\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did you follow me?\u201dHa Tae-heon interrupted me and asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of question is this?\u201cI didn\u2019t follow you, I was trying to save you. Because I have the ability to fly.\u201d\u201cThen.\u201dHa Tae-heon came one step closer to me.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the ability.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have fallen behind, would you?\u201dI shut my mouth.The moment it was confirmed that Ha Tae-heon was falling, my body moved before rational judgment.If I hadn\u2019t had the wind ability, would I have acted differently?I wasn\u2019t even sure about that.\u201c\u2026what\u2019s the point of such a question? Anyway, I moved with the intention of saving you. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201dWhat does Ha Tae-heon want from me? From the moment I met him in Roheon a few days ago, his subtle and strange attitude kept coming to my eyes.Even if I want to get closer, you get farther away. It seemed to me that even Ha Tae-heon himself couldn\u2019t sort out his confusion.\u2018Then why are you doing this? Please, let my words cool you down.\u2019I\u2019m so frustrated. He\u2019s the kind of person who doesn\u2019t trust other people. I knew it because I read the novel\u2026 It was incredibly uncomfortable for me to go through.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Now it\u2019s not the time to talk about it. Let\u2019s find the way out first.\u201dAs I sighed and changed my words, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s expression darkened somewhat. Did I see it wrong? It\u2019s so dark I\u2019m not sure.Ha Tae-heon, who created a black sword, passed me by and took the lead. Every time Ha Tae-heon moved, the dust wrapped around him and shimmered. He looked like a princess from a fairy tale with fairies.I walked along the dark hallway for a while. Ha Tae-heon, who had been quietly walking forward without a word, stopped suddenly.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right. I think we\u2019re going around the same place.\u201dHa Tae-heon raised his sword and swung it towards the wall.\u00a0Kagak, deep scratches left on the wall.\u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been since you fell here?\u201d\u201cAbout 50 minutes. It\u2019s not accurate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not even sure how many times we\u2019ve wandered in 50 minutes.\u201dI said as I put my hand against the wall.\u201cNow that we have left traces, let\u2019s walk against the wall. Let\u2019s check if it\u2019s a simple maze or a monster\u2019s ability.\u201dHa Tae-heon nodded his head and, like me, stepped forward, leaning against the wall.It was dark all over the place, so it was not easy for him to make an accurate judgment in which direction he was walking. I swallowed dry saliva and focused all my attention on the wall felt in my palm.\u2018You shouldn\u2019t be nervous.\u2019The most important thing in this situation was to remain calm. If you started to agitate, you might miss something important.\u201c\u2026we\u2019re back.\u201dThe traces that Ha Tae-heon had left before were touched by the fingertips that were touching the wall. It took about 15 minutes.There\u2019s nothing we can do about it now.\u201cHow about just breaking down the wall?\u201d\u201cIf you act rashly, you can touch a hidden device.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s better than being stuck around, though. Shouldn\u2019t we get out of here as soon as possible? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with the guild members.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who had been thinking about my words for a while, blinked at me.\u201cStand back.\u201dAs I quickly hid behind Ha Tae-heon, dust gathered on the wall.Kugugung! Bang!The dust clinging to the wall began to explode all at once.\u00a0Kururu, the wall crumbled down and a cloud of smoke spread under his feet. When the shaking ground had calmed down, I asked.\u201cWhat do you see?\u201dBeyond the wall, there was nothing in black space. Glittering dust flew over the wall, illuminating the surroundings.\u201cNothing.\u201dAm I and Ha Tae-heon standing in the middle of a large space with nothing but darkness? Horror, I got goosebumps.\u201c\u2026if you don\u2019t know, can you take a look below?\u201dGlowing dust drifting through the empty space slowly went down following Ha Tae-heon\u2019s gestures. Holding my breath, I noticed something grey as I looked at the swarms of light descending.\u201cJust now\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is something.\u201d\u201cWe have to go down.\u201dI swallowed dry saliva and looked down. I couldn\u2019t even guess what was underneath this.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no other way.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to, but as Ha Tae-heon said, I had no choice but to do it. I stood up to Ha Tae-heon and spoke frankly.\u201cHold me tight. I\u2019m so anxious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the dark where even the person in front could be seen dimly. Still, I felt the body temperature and my anxiety subsided a little.Perhaps he felt the same way as me, but Ha Tae-heon, who paused for a moment at my words, pulled my back and hugged me.Huung, the wind came out and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body floated up. Beyond the collapsed wall, I slowly descended to a place where there was only darkness. In the distance, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s dust glittered and shone.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dWhat was reflected in the light was a part of a large stone statue.\u00a0Tap. As soon as my feet touched the ground, candles were lit everywhere as if they had been waiting.\u201cA goddess statue?\u201dI looked up at the huge statue of the goddess in front of me. It was a woman holding a sword and looking down at me. It was the goddess statue I saw in the central hall of the gate.\u201cHow can this be here\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dHa Tae-heon hugged me and hurriedly flew away.\u00a0Kugugung!\u00a0A gigantic sword made of stone statue slammed into the spot where I had just stood.Gurururung!The goddess\u2019 arms moved slowly. Several stone swords fell one after another towards us. I quickly used my ability.Kwagwang! Kugugung!Ha Tae-heon moved his body to avoid the sword while holding me. The energy of the sword that was stably piercing down was unusual. A frightening sense came over me.\u201cAt least, ugh!\u201dKwaang!\u201cS-grade or higher, that\u2019s it!\u201dGeugeuk. Gururung.The eyes of the goddess who was looking down moved. It was a sound I had ever heard. My mind went cold.\u2018That\u2019s what I heard when I looked at the goddess statue in the central hall. That\u2019s\u2026\u2019Are you saying her eyes were moving back then? I wiped the cold sweat running down my cheeks and said to Ha Tae-heon.\u201cAnyway, that statue\u2026 It seems to be S+ grade.\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201dKugugugung!The stone sword, which was stuck on the floor, was slowly pulled out and floated behind the goddess statue. The lips of the goddess who fixed her gaze on us were opened.\u300ePunish\u2026ment.\u300f (\ucc98\u2026\u2026\ub2e8)\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\u201cKeuk!\u201dI clenched my teeth at the heavy voice that shook my head. Even Ha Tae-heon groaned briefly as if he was shocked.Geugeugeuk, gigik.\u300ePunish them.\u300fThe huge sword the goddess was holding was lifted up at high speed. At the same time as the sound of cutting and shuffling the air, Ha Tae-heon jumped on the ground and ran.Kwagwang!The floor was dented with a huge impact and debris splattered randomly. The whole area shook as if a high-rise building had collapsed. The figure of the goddess, whose face was half immersed in the shadows, was very bizarre.Sarararak.Black dust gathered around Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body, which was holding me. As if wearing a shield, Ha Tae-heon swung his sword towards the statue with a lot of dust floating around.Kagagagak!The wrist of the goddess who had been hit with his sword was still intact. Ha Tae-heon frowned slightly. It\u2019s defensive against SS-rank attacks.The aura I felt was definitely an S+ grade. If Ha Tae-heon\u2019s attack didn\u2019t work even though it was not SS-grade.\u201cIt looks like it has some defence-related abilities.\u201dPerhaps he had the same thoughts as me, Ha Tae-heon calmly looked at the statue. Most of the monsters with defence-type abilities existed as a medium. Only by destroying the core, which was the main axis of its ability, would the attack become meaningful.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything worthy of being called a core.\u201dKuung! Pajijik!The sword of the goddess that fell over her head was blocked by Ha Tae-heon\u2019s dust and sparkled.\u00a0Uuung, the seven stone swords floating behind the goddess statue lay horizontally and flew toward us like arrows.Ha Tae-heon avoided the pouring stone swords and dug into the gap of the goddess statue. There was a difference in speed, even if it was fast, as much as its huge body.Kagagagang!\u00a0Aiming at the goddess\u2019 neck, he drew his sword horizontally, but again, there were no scratches left.It would remain in this state until the core was found. I looked through the goddess statue while being hugged by Ha Tae-heon. Find the hidden core\u2026\u201cAh.\u201dAt that time, a moment that had passed without meaning came to my mind.If I\u2019m right, the core.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dI said, raising the corners of my lips.\u201cThis goddess statue, can you deal with it alone?\u201dHa Tae-heon looked at me at the sound of my voice that was different from before.\u201c\u2026you must have figured something out.\u201d\u201cFive minutes at most. Is that possible?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dIt was a burden for Ha Tae-heon as the attack did not work on the opponent. But this was the best way.I nodded and pointed down.\u201cI\u2019m going to fall sideways at the right time. I will keep my ability. It will help you dodge the attacks.\u201dNow that the goddess statue was looking, I couldn\u2019t move hastily. I had to sneak away at the most insane moment. Ha Tae-heon, realizing the meaning of my words, flew his body towards the goddess statue.Kagagang! Kagang!Although the attack continued to be blocked, Ha Tae-heon continued to swing his sword regardless.\u00a0Geugeugeuk, the goddess statue who turned her eyes around once again opened her mouth.\u300ePunish them.\u300fHuuung!The seven stone swords rose into the air again. Ha Tae-heon naturally moved downward, avoiding the stone swords that were pouring out randomly from all directions.\u2018Now!\u2019Just as the stone sword passed over my head, I jumped out of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arms and jumped down. It was not very high, so I landed easily without any ability and ran straight to the right of the statue.\u201cOh, damn it.\u201dThere was a pile of broken stones piled up on the floor. I hurriedly lifted my head and looked at Ha Tae-heon. Ha Tae-heon was seen battling the goddess statue\u2019s attack.Should I use my ability? If my ability was used to both sides, the energy towards Ha Taeheon became unstable.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have time to think about it. I kept looking at Ha Tae-heon and began to clean up the pile of stones with my bare hands. Fortunately, there was no debris that was too heavy or too large to move. As I hurriedly clean it up without seeing it properly, a tingling sensation came up on both palms.\u2018Found it!\u2019The blue light flashed as I roughly moved the pile of stones to the side. A blue jewel that I found when I looked at the goddess statue in the central hall. Fortunately, it was also stuck in the same place here.If my guess is correct, this is the core that maintains the defence. It was the moment when I breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cGasp!\u201dKwagwang!\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi!\u201dWith the sound of falling down, I saw Ha Tae-heon buried on the wall. He was hit on the back by the sword the goddess statue wielded and flew away. The corner of my head was cold.Ha Tae-heon got up with a dry cough. Blood dripped down his cheeks as if he was injured when he bumped into it.\u2018Calm down.\u2019Feeling my heart beating rapidly, I fumbled for a fragment of an appropriate size from the pile of stones. A core embedded in the ground. If you just break that.\u201c\u2014Han Yi-gyeol!\u201dA shadow fell with an eerie sensation. When I looked up, I saw two huge eyes of the goddess looking down at me. The presence of shadows flickering in the light of candlelight approached with indescribable fear.Gururung.The goddess\u2019 sword rose and Ha Tae-heon was seen running from the opposite side.I bit my lip and smashed the jewel with a shard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, the goddess\u2019 sword that had been falling towards my head stopped.Kugugugung!The statue began to shake violently. Meanwhile, Ha Tae-heon grabbed me, held me in his arms, and flew back. I pulled up the ability that had been cut off again and wrapped Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body with me.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, are you all right?\u201dI looked at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s physical condition. Fortunately, he was an SS-rank, so there didn\u2019t seem to be any major injuries other than scratches.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dHa Tae-heon made a surprised expression. He glared at me and said in an angry voice.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run away?\u201d\u201cRun away?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an S+ grade monster. Your life would have been in danger if you got hit by that sword, but what the hell were you thinking?\u201dAt those words, I frowned too.\u201cWhat if I run away? How do we break the core?\u201d\u201cYou just have to look for the next opportunity.\u201d\u201cNext opportunity? If it failed this time, the monster would have defended it more thoroughly to protect its core.\u201d\u201cAre you just throwing your life for that reason?\u201d\u201cWhen did I throw my life? I\u2019m still alive! And.\u201d\u300eAaaaah!\u300fBefore I could finish my words, a sharp scream echoed through the hall. The pure white marble surrounding the statue began to fall off as if it were peeling off its shell.Ha Tae-heon looked at the scene and raised his sword.\u201cLet\u2019s take care of that first and we\u2019ll talk.\u201dI sighed and lifted Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body into the air.\u00a0Kugugung!\u00a0The goddess statue, with all the marble that protected her had fallen off, had blue skin and her white hair hanging down.The goddess\u2019 voice did not give us any more pain. Blood flowed from her black eyes as the goddess screamed with a thin and soft voice.The huge marble blue wings spread wide from the back of the statue and a strong light flashed, and the skeleton knights in silver armour from where they came from, surrounded the statue.The goddess raised her sword and pointed at us. A white halo shone brightly above her head.\u300eProtect the sanctuary. Drive out the intruders!\u300fClank, clank.At the order of the goddess, the knights pulled out the swords they were keeping around their waist in unison. Ha Tae-heon looked down at the knights, like before, covered in black dust like a shield.Kiaaaak!Seeing the knights running bravely, I whispered to Ha Tae-heon with a shaky voice.\u201c\u2026somehow, I think we\u2019ve become villains.\u201dHa Tae-heon ignored my words and swung his sword. Since the core of the defence was broken, neither the goddess statue nor the knights under it could block Ha Tae-heon\u2019s attack. The knights fell down with Ha Tae-heon wielding the sword.Kiak, kyak! Kiaak!The knights also swung their swords at us, but they were all blocked by dust. As her own knights fell helplessly, the goddess spread her wings once more.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi!\u201dThen, the seven stone swords that were stuck on the floor came back again. Ha Tae-heon jumped up to the goddess statue, cutting the heads of the two rushing knights.The defensive core was also broken, meaning there was no need to run away anymore. I twisted the direction of the flying stone sword as far as I could and looked at the tip of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sword.From right to left, diagonally. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes lit up as the wind blew on his wrist.\u300eKkiaaaak!\u300fCombined with my ability, the sword was swung at great speed and left a huge scar on the shoulder of the goddess. Her bright red blood splattered as a sharp scream rang in my ears.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dAs the blood flowed, the light of the halo that floated on the goddess\u2019 head became stronger and hot energy came. When I was in pain, Ha Tae-heon stepped back.\u201cYou are annoying.\u201dHe pulled something out of his pocket. It was a round ball tie with a black jewel in the centre. When Ha Tae-heon tapped the jewel a couple of times, a coat appeared in the air.\u201cWear it.\u201dI gratefully accepted the SS-class coat Ha Tae-heon brought out and put it on.\u2018It seems that the hot energy felt from the statue is not a flame attribute, but a strong divine power.\u2019If I remembered correctly, one of the attributes of the coat was chaos as opposed to divine power. Obviously, wearing this coat made me feel less pressured.When I regained my composure, Ha Tae-heon drew new dust and wrapped around the rushing knights.Kwaaang!Kkiiik! Kiiik!Each particle of dust began to explode with a loud explosion. In the reaction, the ranks of the knights were scattered randomly and the bones of dead skeletons were bouncing here and there.Ha Tae-heon took care of the Knights under his feet and rushed to the goddess statue again.\u00a0Kuuung! Kung!\u00a0Ha Tae-heon, who skillfully evaded the stone sword flying from various directions, flew to the front of the goddess statue in an instant and put the sword in her right eye.Kwarururung!The whole ground shook as the statue floundered and struggled. The marble wings on her back rose sharply and fell towards Ha Tae-heon, but even that was blocked by his shield and shattered.\u300eKiaaak! Haak!\u300fThe appearance of the goddess drenched in her blood began to change gradually. Black horns rose from her forehead and her half-broken wings were dyed black. Her eyes burned red from the tears of her blood and thick fangs sprouted from her mouth.\u300eCursed intruders! I will kill you!\u300fDark red flames soared around the goddess statue, spreading eerie energy widely.\u201cI guess this is what it looks like.\u201dThe surroundings were full of red and sparks were scattered everywhere. In the hot air that was hard to breathe, I covered my mouth with the coat and pushed the energy away with the wind as much as possible.When Ha Tae-heon swung his sword once, dozens of black spheres appeared around the goddess statue in an instant.Kwagwagwang! Kuung!\u300eKkiaaaa!\u300fThe spheres surrounding the statue exploded at the same time. The goddess screamed and staggered her body. Perhaps because of the wounds caused by the explosion, it was bizarre to see her drenched in blood and revealing her teeth.\u201cKeuk\u2026\u201dThe goddess statue\u2019s halo shone even more intensely and white chains poured from above. Smoke rose from where the chains had brushed past her. Her divinity, which had grown too strong, made my stomach churn and a dull pain rushed through my head.\u201cTsk.\u201dHa Tae-heon, noticing my condition, created dozens of black spears behind his back and narrowed the distance from the statue. Slowly, Ha Tae-heon, who had the chains tied his arms and was holding the sword and spears like snakes, didn\u2019t care and cut off the arm of the goddess statue.\u300eAaaaah!\u300fDozens of black spears floating in the air flew to the goddess statue with Ha Tae-heon in between. Red blood spurted out and the goddess missed the sword with a scream.Kuung!A huge sword fell to the floor as the statue\u2019s body began to slowly change. Before long, the goddess statue turned to marble as she struggled in pain.The chain that burned Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arm was also gone.\u00a0Tadak, tadak. Only the remained feeble flames burned continuously.\u201cIs it over?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dSlowly coming down, I turned off my ability and got out of his arms.\u201cWell done.\u201dWhen I handed the coat I was wearing, he opened his inventory and put the coat in.\u201cWhere shall we go now?\u201dI looked around the area, which had collapsed and became messy.\u201cDid you say that the jewel in the room turned red?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe should go to that room.\u201dExactly the same place as the main hall. Then there would be a room where monsters came out. I nodded and followed Ha Tae-heon.* * *Contrary to the central hall, which was dazzlingly shining with stained glass, this place, where only candles lit up the surroundings, gave off a dark and gloomy atmosphere overall.Tap, tap.As I walked without a word, all I could hear was the sound of footsteps. Forcing my tired body to move, I frowned at the pain I felt in my palms.\u2018Ah, when I found the core\u2026\u2019The palm I looked down was torn and my nails were broken. I didn\u2019t know until recently because I was so busy dealing with monsters.Anyway, if you just come to the gate, you won\u2019t be able to go back. With a sigh, Ha Tae-heon, who was walking ahead, stopped.\u201cIs it here?\u201dThe 14th room with a blue jewel. Looking at the room next door, I noticed that the jewel in the door was different.\u201cLook at this, Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dI said, pointing to the 13th and 15th room.\u201cUnlike the room at the gate, this one has red jewel except for the 14th room.\u201dFrom the atmosphere to the jewel, everything here was the exact opposite of the main hall. I looked back at Ha Tae-heon.\u201cProbably\u2026 the space seems to be warped. I think we\u2019ve come to a place that shouldn\u2019t be open.\u201d\u201cIs this a hidden place inside the gate?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just speculation, I\u2019m not sure. If you have space ability, you can check it properly\u2026\u201dAs a test, I pressed the red jewel embedded in the 13th room. But nothing happened.\u201cIt won\u2019t open.\u201dKugugung!\u201cThis place is open.\u201dFortunately, the door to the 14th room with blue jewel was opened. Ha Tae-heon and I walked into the darkroom, wary about the surroundings, just in case.Contrary to the expectation that monsters would appear in the room lit by the light of the candlestick, no energy was felt.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dHwiiing, I heard the sound of the wind blowing. There was a black hole about the same size as the gate and the wind was flowing through it.\u201cI think this is the exit.\u201d\u201cIt seems that way to me, too.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go inside. In case I don\u2019t know, the ability\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dHa Tae-heon stopped me from raising my ability.As I looked back at him in wonder, he pointed to the floor as he looked at where he had fallen.\u201cThis.\u201dThere was a pattern engraved on it which I had never seen before.He knelt down on one knee and looked closely at the floor. The pattern expressing the colourful roses and vines was a look that had not been seen anywhere else.\u201cThere\u2019s something you don\u2019t even know.\u201d\u201c\u2026that\u2019s natural, of course.\u201dI thought as I touched the pattern with my hand. Hidden space, the appearance of S+ grade monsters, and the floor with a pattern engraved on it.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi. Isn\u2019t this situation a bit similar to the D8 Area gate?\u201dThe S+ class monster that appeared in the D8 Area existed to protect the SS class coat.If the reason the statue awakened was under this pattern.\u201cAre you saying that the item might exist?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, and I don\u2019t know how to get it right now\u2026 that\u2019s what I think.\u201dUnlike the case of the SS-class coat, this was a place that did not appear in the original.\u2018In the novel, the Prophet taught Ha Tae-heon how to get a coat. If so, did the Prophet know this place as well?\u2019I couldn\u2019t make a hasty move right now. If this pattern itself was a device to open something, it would be better to leave it alone until you know how to.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here first.\u201dI finished thinking and nodded. Both of us were in bad shape to stay here.As I got up, Ha Tae-heon pulled me up and wrapped his arms around my waist. When I saw it, I felt a strange feeling. Ha Tae-heon seemed very accustomed to working with me as much as Cheon Sa-yeon.As the wind engulfed us both, black dust covered it. We entered the black hole with shields on just in case.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you both okay?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAs I watched the guild members rushing in, my tension was relieved. That was then.Kugugung!\u201cOoh!\u201d\u201cThe door\u2026\u201dWhen the tightly closed door was opened, the guild members came out with bewildered faces and looked at the door and Ha Tae-heon alternately. Seeing this, Ha Tae-heon sighed.\u201cLet\u2019s go out for now and talk.\u201dAfter leaving the room and moving alone, the second team that had gone to the other room greeted us. No matter how much time passed we didn\u2019t come back, they were waiting after taking care of all the other rooms.Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth to the guild members who looked at him with confused eyes.\u201cWe ran into an S+-grade monster in a distant place.\u201dThere were too many eyewitnesses to just ignore it, so it was better, to tell the truth.Above all, after me and Ha Tae-heon disappeared, it was right to tell the whole incident to the first team, who must have been terrified by being locked in the 14th room for 3 hours.After hearing the neatly organized explanation, the guild members made an expression that they understood.\u201cSo that\u2019s why Deputy Master and Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2026\u201dAs one of the guild members muttered, I smiled awkwardly and touched my face. I was belatedly thinking that the current situation would not make sense as I was rolling a lot while fighting.Ha Tae-heon didn\u2019t seem to make any difference other than the bloodstains on his face.\u201cThe space was distorted due to an anomaly in the gate, so I guess that we encountered a monster that was not found.\u201dHearing Ha Tae-heon\u2019s explanation, I turned my gaze back. The goddess statue was still standing in the middle of the hall in the same shape. The goddess statue beyond the twisted space and the goddess statue now.\u2018Obviously, I heard the moving sound of the goddess statue even here in the hall. If so, can that goddess statue also become a monster?\u2019The pattern that Ha Tae-heon discovered in the twisted space was also suspicious. If there was really an item hidden under it, I thought we could expect a pretty high rating.\u2018No more, no less, I just wish it could be an S-class. There is an SS-class coat for defence, so it\u2019s an offensive item.\u2019It felt pretty good to imagine Ha Tae-heon fighting with an S-class weapon.I was standing alone among the serious members of Roheon guild, one guild member glanced at me and asked a question.\u201cBy the way, Deputy Master. What\u2019s your relationship with Han Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOops.Only then I remembered what I did when Ha Tae-heon fell. I called his name and jumped to save him. It was definitely not something to do with the opponent I met at this gate for the first time.What should I do? What excuse should I make? I looked at Ha Tae-heon with a perplexed expression. It was ambiguous for me to step up first and say that there was no relationship.Ha Tae-heon, who was looking at the curious faces calmly, slowly opened his mouth.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol and I.\u201dAt that moment, I made eye contact with Ha Tae-heon. I cheered for him in my heart with anticipation.\u2018You must answer well, Ha Tae-heon.\u2019He would be able to overcome this situation skillfully. Because he was always prepared for various situations. You can do it, Ha Tae-heon. I believe.\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a long time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI was so surprised that I asked back.Ha Tae-heon pointed at me like that and added.\u201cIt\u2019s a relationship I\u2019ve had since before I awakened.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe still have a good relationship.\u201dAre you crazy?The guild members were all excited and chattering as if they couldn\u2019t even see my bewildered expression.\u201cNo wonder. The atmosphere between the two of you was strange.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a relationship before awakening!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0say that he was also close with the Requiem Master?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not an ordinary person.\u201dThe evaluation of me began to flow in an irreversible direction. I forced a smile and poked Ha Tae-heon\u2019s side with my elbow.Ha Tae-heon, who glanced at me, added in a slow tone.\u201c\u2026I thought it would only get complicated if I had to reveal it, so I first suggested Han Yi-gyeol to act as if we were meeting for the first time. He was just following what I said, so please refrain from talking nonsense.\u201d\u201cHa. Haha.\u201dThe way the guild members looking at me had changed from before. I felt like crying.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m going crazy.\u2019* * *After such a commotion, we immediately exited the gate. As soon as Ha Tae-heon came out, the reporters who were waiting outside rushed out and shoved their microphones in.Belatedly, the bodyguards blocked the gap, but the surrounding area quickly became a mess with reporters and onlookers who were desperate to get a picture or an interview.In the midst of that, I was about to escape, but I was caught by Kim Soo-hwan.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u2026\u201dKim Soo-hwan called me with a sad face. A voice full of regret pierced my conscience.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0was close with the Deputy Master\u2026\u201d\u201cI, that\u2026 Kim Soo-hwan-ssi, I.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to pretend to know everything in front of Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0like that.\u201d\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t tell you in advance\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I heard that the Deputy Master ordered it. You can\u2019t help it.\u201dKim Soo-hwan smiled with a really casual face and shrugged his shoulders. It looked like he pretended to be disappointed and played a joke.\u201cMore than that, give me your number. I\u2019ll send you an invitation later. Ah, the idea of joining the fan cafe is still valid, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThank, God. I was relieved and put my number on Kim Soo-hwan\u2019s cell phone.\u201cSee you next time and I\u2019ll do my best to be the Deputy Master\u2019s fan!\u201d\u201cHaha, yes\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know what it is to be a fan, but I nodded my head for now. I checked Ha Tae-heon, who was being interviewed with an expressionless face, surrounded by reporters. The only way to escape is now.\u201cKim Soo-hwan-ssi, I should get going.\u201d\u201cYes? Are you going? Why? We\u2019re having a dinner party! Stop by and go.\u201d\u201cNo, I have some urgent business. I will go next time.\u201d\u201cThen you should tell Deputy Master\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019ll understand. Then.\u201dI flatly refused and left Area D17 as if I was running away without looking back.* * *Tack, tack. The sound of tapping on the keyboard filled the room.Several large monitors shone brightly in the dimly lit room. The small man, who sat in front of it, hummed and moved his hands incessantly.Clink. Kkiik\u2014A thick iron door opened and someone entered. As soon as he entered the room, the man wearing a black stadium jumper and a cap pressed down violently kicked a large mechanical part nearby.Bang!\u201cAh shit, you scared me. What?\u201dThe man, who was singing along to the song with earphones on without knowing who came in, was startled by the sudden noise, turned his chair around, and looked back. Dressed in a grey hood with shaggy hair, big horn-rimmed glasses, he tilted his head when he saw his guest.\u201cWho are you? No one can come in here\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dEven though it was the first time he had seen his face, his voice was familiar. Besides, that blurry presence. The man, who was thinking about something, rolling his eyes, immediately exclaimed with a friendly face.\u201cKim Woo-jin! Kim Woo-jin, right?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dHe took off his hat and turned off his ability, revealing his red hair. The man jumped up from his seat and slowly approached him.\u201cWhat~ It\u2019s been a really long time. How long has it been?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dKim Woo-jin hit the man who was hanging on his arm and replied coldly. At that attitude, the man grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same. So? Are you here to see me?\u201dEven so, seeing that teasing smile on his face, he didn\u2019t want to admit it. Kim Woo-jin, with a frown on his forehead, strode forward and sat down on the chair where the man was sitting.\u201cHyde (\ud558\uc774\ub4dc).\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something I need you to find out.\u201d\u201cWoah.\u201dAt those words, the man, Hyde, swept up his bangs with a surprised expression on his face.\u201cWhat happened? You haven\u2019t even looked at me until now.\u201d\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cIs it necessary now?\u201dHyde, who dragged a new chair from a corner, sat down opposite Kim Woo-jin.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhat? Tell me. Because I\u2019m so expensive that I don\u2019t accept any outside requests.\u201dHe hummed lightly, rummaged through his hood pocket and pulled out his lollipop. Lemon flavour and strawberry flavour. After thinking about it for a while, Hyde offered the strawberry flavour to Kim Woo-jin. Kim Woo-jin said irritably.\u201cPut it away.\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s tasty.\u201d\u201cTake it away.\u201dSensitive.\u00a0Hyde put the strawberry flavour back into his pocket and shoved the lemon flavour candy into his mouth. Hyde, who had been rolling candy while rattling, opened his mouth immediately.\u201cIf you came to me, it wouldn\u2019t be normal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s noisy these days due to the gate problem. Do you know that?\u201d\u201cIt should be but\u2026 suddenly the gate? I heard you joined the guild, did they ask you to find out?\u201dKim Woo-jin shut his mouth without answering. Hyde, narrowing his eyes, tapped his knee.\u201cNo\u2026 If it\u2019s Requiem, they wouldn\u2019t have to ask you to do it.\u201dIt smelled funny. Hyde\u2019s eyes twinkled with interest.\u201cWho is it? Who\u2019s asking you come to me for the first time in years and ask for such a request?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cUwah.\u201dWith an unpleasant expression on his face, Kim Woo-jin kicked Hyde\u2019s chair in front of him without mercy. The chair\u2019s wheels slipped and Hyde struggled.\u201cDamn it! I can help, but you just can tell me that much!\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re going to search for more than I want you to find out, why should I?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s fun!\u201d\u201cDamn it, this is why I didn\u2019t want to come here\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had been staring at Hyde harshly, seemed to realize something, and raised the corners of his lips slightly.\u201cNo, no. Hey. I\u2019ll let you know, so will you check it out until it\u2019s full?\u201d\u201cReally? It\u2019s me then it\u2019s good. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, collect information on the current progress of the gate. Including gates where anomalies were found. I\u2019ll ask for it when I need it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin spoke in a soft voice that was different from before.\u201cThere is a talented person named Han Yi-gyeol. Find out about him.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cIf you look for it, you will find something about his sister\u2026 That part is more detailed.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. It\u2019s Han Yi-gyeol\u2026\u201dWhere did he hear that? Scratching his head and rolling his head, Hyde immediately recalled the news.\u201cI remember. That A-rank mercenary, right? He said he was close with the Requiem Master.\u201d\u201cNot close.\u201d\u201cEveryone talks like that, tho?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not close.\u201dKim Woo-jin shook his head with his stiff face. What\u2019s up with you?\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care\u2026 I just have to investigate all about Han Yi-gyeol, right?\u201d (\ud0c8\ud0c8 \ud138, I found that meant \u201crob\u201d, \u201cinvestigate\u201d, \u201call\u201d)\u201cInvestigate\u2026\u00a0ya. Why are you talking like that?\u201d\u201cThen what do you mean when you say you ask for his information?\u201d (\uadf8\ub7fc \uc815\ubcf4 \ud130\ub294 \uac78 \ud134\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0 \ubb50\ub77c\uace0 \ud574?, not sure)\u201cJust a little, just in case, I feel like I have to know\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of bullshit are you talking about?\u201dHyde made a face that he couldn\u2019t understand.\u00a0Kim Woo-jin, you bastard, I think you have lost a bit of flavour while I haven\u2019t seen you.\u00a0(\uae40\uc6b0\uc9c4 \uc774 \uc0c8\ub07c, \uc548 \ubcf8 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc880\ub9db\uc774 \uac04 \uac70 \uac19\uc740\ub370, again not sure)\u201cEi, damn it, anyway! Find out. Thoroughly. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dKim Woo-jin sighed deeply in response to the playful answer and stood up from his seat.\u201cAre you leaving already? I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time, why don\u2019t we hang out?\u201d\u201cWhat are we doing in a place like this? I\u2019m going.\u201dKim Woo-jin left without looking back.\u00a0Clink, bang!\u00a0As the iron door closed with a loud noise, Hyde, who was sitting in a chair, spun around, clicked his tongue.\u201cAnyway, still with a temper tantrum.\u201dEven after several years, nothing had changed. While grumbling, he recalled the contents of Kim Woo-jin\u2019s request.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dTap. When he searched for the name on the program, several windows popped up. Looking at it, Hyde grinned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ha Tae-heon\u2019s interview video, who dressed neatly, was coming out.As I expected, there was a warped space inside the gate and the news that an additional high-grade monster appeared became a big topic.But the trouble I feel now is not only the gate.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI clicked on an Internet article floating on the main site of the mobile phone screen.\u300cHa Tae-heon of Roheon Guild, are you familiar with the popular A-rank mercenary?

I calmly scrolled down.\u300cSS-rank Ha Tae-heon, who recently took the position as the Deputy Master of the Roheon Guild, has revealed the relationship with an independent A-rank talented man, Han Yi-gyeol.Ha Tae-heon, who went to clear the gate of Area D17, revealed the relationship he was hiding immediately after dealing with the S+ grade monster as a result of his participation as a mercenary.When asked by a guild member about what kind of relationship he had, it was reported that they had known each other before Ha Tae-heon awakened.After seeing the appearance of Han Yi-gyeol, who threw himself without hesitation to save Ha Tae-heon, who was almost seriously injured, there was speculation that they might have a special relationship.On this news, netizens were interested in which guild Han Yi-gyeol, who is currently an independent, will go to.Meanwhile, Ha Tae-heon is scheduled to appear in \u2018First Hunting\u2019, a specialized program for talented people.[email\u00a0protected]Photo courtesy | Reporter Han Yoon-jong\u300dWhat?

You keep writing articles about people you don\u2019t care about.\u2514 Are you interested?\u2514 I guess you don\u2019t know what everyone else knows because you\u2019re an outsider \u314b\u300d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI rubbed my forehead and turned off the phone screen.There were only those around who were not controlled, such as Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon, so the number of annoying things had doubled.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dWhile lying on the sofa contemplating how to solve this situation, Kim Woo-jin returned from going out.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cI went grocery shopping.\u201dKim Woo-jin lifted a bag with the logo of a nearby mart. It was quite large as it contained quite a lot.After clearing the gate and returning to the Requiem Guild, I slept as if fainting after only treating my hands.Kim Woo-jin, who was eager to make me the healthy food, seemed to rush to the mart like an arrow as soon as the morning dawned.\u201cIt\u2019s only been four days and I\u2019ve lost some weight\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know that you\u2019ve lost weight? How hard have you been to come back exhausted?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s.\u201d\u201cI saw the news, too. I heard you were dealing with an S+ grade monster.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you not to go, but you didn\u2019t listen to others. And even you hurt your hand, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026stop it. I know.\u201dAs I surrendered waving my hands, Kim Woo-jin pouted and went to the kitchen. It seemed like the nagging got worse as time went on.\u201cWhat are you going to do? I like everything you make because it\u2019s delicious.\u201dAnyway, there is no reason to refuse if you give me something delicious. When I approached Kim Woo-jin, who was taking out the ingredients, with a soft smile, he slightly bowed his head and answered.\u201cI was going to make beef short rib soup (sogalbitang)\u2026 If there\u2019s anything else you want to eat, I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201d (\uc18c\uac08\ube44\ud0d5, the pic is below)The frown and nagging figure disappeared, leaving only a shy face. What\u2019s going on suddenly?While looking at Kim Woo-jin, who exuded a strange atmosphere, someone knocked on the door.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, I\u2019m here~\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi.\u201dThe owner of the cheerful voice was Min Ah-rin. She greeted me with a big smile as she opened the door and sighed when she found my hand wrapped in the bandages.\u201cI knew it. As expected, you got hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard the news that you went to the gate, so I came just in case\u2026 Can I come in right away?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAs Min Ah-rin entered the Lululala room (see the previous chap), Kim Woo-jin frowned as if displeased, but when he saw her treating my hand, he erased his dissatisfied expression.\u201cFortunately, the wound is not as bad as the last time.\u201d\u201cIf you leave it alone, it will get better soon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient to live.\u201dIt was. I took the bandages off, clenched and straightened my hands a couple of times.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? You\u2019re preparing breakfast?\u201dAnticipation stood in Min Ah-rin\u2019s round eyes.\u201cWould you like to eat together?\u201dIt was Min Ah-rin, who deliberately took the time to treat me from this morning. Of course, I had to treat her a breakfast.\u201cOh, good! What is the menu?\u201d\u201cHe said it\u2019s beef rib soup.\u201d\u201cOh my God. It seems that Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0made something delicious because Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0worked hard.\u201dShe\u2019s quick-witted. So I headed to the kitchen with Min Ah-rin on my back.\u201cIs there anything I can help with? Chop the onion or something.\u201d\u201cNever mind. Do you want to get hurt again?\u201dI asked because I had nothing to do while preparing, but he touched my pride. That\u2019s ridiculous. Other than that, I\u2019m confident that I can handle a knife well.\u201cYa. I know how to do that.\u201dAt those words, Kim Woo-jin handed me an onion and a knife with somewhat an uneasy expression. What is this? I proudly placed the onion on the cutting board and held the knife.\u201cHey, Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? Why are you holding the knife like that?\u201dMin Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, who were watching, freaked out and grabbed my arm. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201cIsn\u2019t this how you hold it?\u201d\u201cUm, but that\u2019s what you do when you stab a person, not an onion\u2026\u201d\u201cPut the knife horizontally and hold it!\u201dAh, right. I coughed in vain and fixed the knife as Kim Woo-jin told me.\u201cCan I cut it now?\u201d\u201cOh. Cut it in half first.\u201dCut it in half? I pondered for a moment and then raised my arm. If you hit it with this amount of force, it will cut off neatly.\u201cCrazy bastard!\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, hand! Hand!\u201dKim Woo-jin once again grabbed my arm. I found my hand on the onion just then at Min Ah-rin\u2019s cry. I was just thinking about slicing the onion, so I hadn\u2019t checked the position of my hand.\u201cHaha. I made a mistake.\u201d\u201cYou like making mistakes. Get out!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better listen to Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0this time.\u201dKim Woo-jin kicked me out of the kitchen. Min Ah-rin asked me in a curious voice, after being kicked out without any excuses.\u201cI guess you\u2019ve never cooked before, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cIt just happened.\u201dI recalled memories of the past. When I was a teenager, I mostly stuffed my stomach with triangular kimbap or cup noodles, and after I started working, I always bought and ate them.* * *\u201cYou, wherever you go and cook, don\u2019t hold a knife. Okay?\u201dAfter the beef short rib soup was completed, Kim Woo-jin started a new nagging while eating.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It could have been dangerous before.\u201d\u201cYou went to the gate and got hurt every time, but now you want to get hurt while cooking?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI quietly shoved the rice into my mouth. From some time ago, when these two got together, they nagged a lot. It was difficult to even with one person, but there was no skill to defeat two people\u2019s cooperative attacks.Even though I ate nourishing food, I somehow withered and lay down on the sofa as usual, and Min Ah-rin left the room saying that she had work.Kim Woo-jin was enjoying his leisurely time, eating the apples he cut, when a new message arrived on my cell phone.\u300cKim Soo-hwan: Yi-gyeol-ssi! Did you go home well yesterday? This is Kim Soo-hwan!\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: (Emoji)\u300dKim Soo-hwan sent a picture of a cat waving its hand with a greeting. I replied with a grin.\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: Yes. I\u2019m taking a rest after coming home safely.\u300d\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: Did you enjoy the dinner party, Kim Soo-hwan-ssi?\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: Of course^^ We ate beef.\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: (Photo)\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: Let\u2019s go together next time~\u300d\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: Sure.\u300dSoon after, Kim Soo-hwan sent a serial number and a link.\u300cKim Soo-hwan: 53263\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: (Link)\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: This is the fan cafe link and invitation number. If you press the signup button and put that number in the invitation code, your signup will be completed within a day.\u300dAha. This was what the invitation meant.\u300cKim Soo-hwan: Once you have signed up, you can read the notice and follow the rules to be active^^\u300d\u300cKim Soo-hwan: If there is anything you don\u2019t know, feel free to message me anytime!\u300d\u300cHan Yi-gyeol: Thank you.\u300dI clicked the link without hesitation. Then, along with the title \u2018SS-rank talented Ha Tae-heon fan cafe\u2019, a picture of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s profile appeared in a huge size.\u201cWah.\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s face, seen through the white snowflakes, was admiringly so cool. They said he\u2019d be better than most celebrities and I guess that the photographers were also following him around.I barely found the sign-up button and wrote the serial number that Kim Soo-hwan gave me. It was hard to adapt because there were so many flashing things and there were words I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhat are you looking at, so serious?\u201d\u201cOh? Nothing.\u201dAt Kim Woo-jin\u2019s words, I quickly closed the phone screen and changed the topic.\u201cMore than that, what happened to my request?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a question I had high expectations for. Even if Kim Woo-jin didn\u2019t get any information, I could fully understand it. It was only been a few days since I left it.\u201cI got it. If you want, I\u2019ll bring it to you today.\u201dHowever, contrary to my expectation, Kim Woo-jin calmly replied that he succeeded. I became rather anxious at those words.\u201c\u2026what, you didn\u2019t you do something useless, did you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. What do you think I am?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strange. If you were me, wouldn\u2019t you be worried?\u201d\u201cWorried?\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes, which had been feisty, became soft slightly.\u201cYou were worried?\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t you?\u201dWhat I asked Kim Woo-jin for was detailed information about the gate progress and anomalies. Information beyond what was officially announced through the media by the management headquarters.Such information was not easily obtainable as the state thoroughly managed the gates. So I was even more suspicious of Kim Woo-jin.\u201cBe honest. Did you make a deal with some weirdo?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. Really. I know how to cover that much.\u201dEven when I asked again, Kim Woo-jin firmly shook his head.\u201cStop doubting and start with the data. After seeing it, you can decide if it is worthwhile.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI thought for a moment and then nodded. As Kim Woo-jin said, if the material had already been prepared, it would be better to receive it first.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll give them a call.\u201dKim Woo-jin grabbed his cell phone and entered the room.Seeing this, I sighed in a dreary mood. Is this really okay?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He answered with a tone that the other person, who had paused for a moment, could not stop him.[I knew this would happen. Can you at least say hello?]\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d[All right, all right. You\u2019re rushing me.]The sound of rustling paper was heard over the phone.[Can I send it right away?

The voice that followed became even smaller.\u201cWhat about the other one I ask?\u201d[Hmm\u2026 I have something to tell you about it.]Hyde\u2019s voice was somehow not satisfied.

Because it smells funny.]Tap. Tap.\u00a0The sound of the keyboard could be heard through the voices.[You know that, right? Ordinary people know everything from personal information to their life history, half a day is enough.]\u201cYeah.\u201d[Let\u2019s see about Han Yi-gyeol. I\u2019ve been searching for about 43 hours\u2026]Kim Woo-jin, who was listening, bit his lip.No way\u2026[Recent track record. Exactly after the video of Area C13 appeared.

Kim Woo-jin asked with a cold expression.\u201cWhat about his sister?\u201d[The result is the same as Han Yi-gyeol. It\u2019s classified as missing, but no further information is available. It\u2019s neat.]\u201cIs there no way?\u201d[Umm\u2026]Hyde answered in a difficult voice he had never heard before.[I\u2019ll try, but I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer. If it\u2019s cleaned up like this, I\u2019m sure the other person is as talented as me.]If the information about Han Yi-gyeol and his younger sister was deleted using a talented person\u2026\u2018Master.\u2019It must be Cheon Sa-yeon. He didn\u2019t expect him to be this thorough.\u2018But, if it had been hidden clumsily, Han Yi-gyeol would have already found it.\u2019Unlike before, Han Yi-gyeol is now getting what he wants from Cheon Sa-yeon.Kim Woo-jin lowered his head in a depressed mood. He thought it would be very helpful to Han Yi-gyeol if he found out information about his sister.\u201cDon\u2019t give up for now and look for more. His sister, she\u2026 I know she\u2019s very sick. Search for the hospital.\u201d[Hospital? Well, I got it. I\u2019ll send you the gate documents now.]\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter finishing the call, Kim Woo-jin left the room and found Han Yi-gyeol lying on the sofa with his eyes closed. His well-groomed face exhaled his breath evenly and the inside of his mouth was dry.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dGo to bed and sleep comfortably.\u00a0He came closer and said, but Han Yi-gyeol, who had fallen asleep, did not even move.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis soft brown hair, long eyelashes that fell below, his pure white cheeks, and his well-placed lips slowly entered his gaze.His heart pounded as he looked at his slender neck over his baggy t-shirt and his collarbone slightly rose due to his posture.Kim Woo-jin, who unconsciously raised his arm, wiped Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s cheek with his slightly trembling fingertips.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dThen, with a sound of pain, Han Yi-gyeol raised his hand and gently grabbed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand, which was touching his cheek. While Kim Woo-jin was startled like a child caught doing something bad, Han Yi-gyeol woke up.\u201cAh, lying down for a while has made me sleepy\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cKim Woo-jin?\u201dKim Woo-jin averted his gaze from Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s puzzled eyes and gently pulled out the hand he was holding.\u201cGo, ahem. Go back to sleep.\u201dHis voice came out harshly.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to sleep. How about the data?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to send it quickly. It will take about an hour or two.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dNodding his head, he got up and headed for the bathroom, saying that he should wash his face to wake him up. Kim Woo-jin covered his red nape with his hands.* * *Upon hearing that it had arrived, Kim Woo-jin went down to the first floor and received the data. I pulled out the data from the kraft paper envelope and read it slowly.\u201cIs this reliable information?\u201d\u201cUng.\u201dEach guild was neatly divided into cleared gates, ongoing gates, and waiting gates.It\u2019s just the work of a professional.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect to get this kind of help from Kim Woo-jin.\u2019In the original story, Kim Woo-jin appeared as little as Han Yi-gyeol, so it felt strange.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me where you got it from, aren\u2019t you?\u201dTo that question, Kim Woo-jin hesitated and answered.\u201cIt\u2019s better not to know.\u201d\u201cYeah, okay.\u201dI put the cluttered papers together and put it back together.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to believe because I don\u2019t even know who the informant is.\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll just trust you.\u201d\u201c\u2026me?\u201d\u201cYeah. I mean I believe in your choice.\u201d\u201cBelieve in my choice\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s face, who had been muttering along with my words with a blank expression on his face, began to turn red gradually. Kim Woo-jin, whose face turned red from the nape of his neck, covered his mouth and said.\u201c\u2026for the first time. Words like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t believe you in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t have asked for this. Anyway, thank you.\u201dKim Woo-jin bowed his head and mumbled back.\u201cTell me more. Anything. I\u2019ll do it all for you\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have one right now.\u201d\u201cThen later\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLooking at Kim Woo-jin, who was very shy, I clicked my tongue. Maybe it\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t had any friends for a while. He seemed particularly weak at these words.\u2018Well, it\u2019s amazing to have friends with that temperament.\u2019I shook my head, remembering the past Kim Woo-jin, who used to spit out swear words when he opened his mouth. He had lowered his tail a bit to me now, but basically, he\u2019s a tough and sensitive person.\u2018There is also a gate at the Area D17 I\u2019ve been to.\u2019I asked Kim Woo-jin, taking out the gate data for Area D17.\u201cThis information, can you continue to receive it?\u201d\u201cUng.\u201d\u201cThen take it again next week or so.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI smiled contentedly and slowly read through the gate description of Area D17.\u2018The warped space and the corridor in the dark. The S+ grade monster I met down there, the goddess statue. It\u2019s written in detail.\u2019This was information that Ha Tae-heon did not reveal in the media interview. He probably said it at the guild management headquarter meeting. Masters needed to exchange information so they could prepare for danger.It was exactly the information I was looking for. I sat down on the sofa and took the time to scan through the data from start to finish. Fortunately, no warped space was found outside of Area D17.\u2018The probability of a gate having an anomaly is about 50%. The difficulty increase is from a minimum of 1 level to a maximum of 2 levels.\u2019An S+ grade monster was additionally discovered at the gate belonging to the Jayna Guild. Fortunately, it was dealt with without major damage.As I was looking at the data for a while, I heard a buzzing sound from the corner of the sofa. I noticed that it was my cell phone that I had thrown away earlier.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dWhen I looked at the screen, I saw an unknown number. Who is it?\u201cYes.\u201dAfter much consideration, when I answered the phone, the other person said in an urgent voice.[Han Yi-gyeol. Where are you now?]\u201c\u2026Team Leader Park Geon-ho?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was organizing the data he had finished reading, turned his head towards me.\u201cWhat? I told you not to make unnecessary calls.\u201d[Because it\u2019s not useless. Do you have time now?]\u201cI am busy.\u201d[I know you\u2019re not busy. You came back from the gate yesterday.]\u201cAre you thinking about it knowingly? My desire to meet you is disappearing.\u201d[Don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s really urgent.]No matter how much I think about it, I think I got it for nothing. I sighed.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d[I wish you would come up to the representative office now.]Representative office? Is there Cheon Sa-yeon? I answered yes and hung up the phone. What the hell are these two together?Ah, really, I don\u2019t want to go, but I can\u2019t even refuse because I think it\u2019s a gate problem. When I got up from my seat with a tired face, Kim Woo-jin followed me.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cWait a minute upstairs\u2026\u201d\u201cGo together. I will go too.\u201d\u2026can I take you with me? Well, he didn\u2019t say to come alone.\u201cWhatever.\u201dSo I went up to the top floor with Kim Woo-jin on my back. As if he had already been informed, the attendant opened the door to the representative office without saying anything.\u201cMaster. No matter how you think about it, this is not the case.\u201dAs soon as I entered, I heard Park Geon-ho\u2019s serious voice. In the representative office, not only Park Geon-ho and Cheon Sa-yeon, but Woo Seo-hyuk were also present.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was in confrontation with Cheon Sa-yeon, found me and walked with bright eyes. I built a wall with the wind to show that he should not come any closer. Of course, Park Geon-ho didn\u2019t care and approached through the wind.You\u2019re a fucking S-rank bastard.\u201cWhat? If you get closer, I\u2019ll just go.\u201d\u201cHow heartless.\u201dIgnoring Park Geon-ho, who was crying, I turned my gaze to Cheon Sa-yeon. Cheon Sa-yeon, who looked at Park Geon-ho with pitiful eyes, said to me.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that you came so quickly when he called you.\u201d\u201cYou should be disappointed with the person who called me, so why are you disappointed with me?\u201d\u201cPark Geon-ho is a guy who has nothing to be disappointed about.\u201dUnlike usual, Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t have a smile.\u201cWhether it is Han Yi-gyeol or not, my thought doesn\u2019t change. Stop doing useless things, Team Leader Park Geon-ho.\u201d\u201cHow about sending another S-rank other than me? There must be many guild members who are compatible with Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201d\u201cThe other S-ranks have already been scheduled.\u201d\u201cBe honest with me. The team was created like this on purpose.\u201d\u201cDoes Team Leader Park Geon-ho look that much to me?\u201dOnly then I understood the situation. It seemed that Woo Seo-hyuk joined the clear team played by Park Geon-ho. He didn\u2019t like it, so he was protesting like this.I frowned and intervened.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, Team Leader, the reason why you asked me to come\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease put Han Yi-gyeol in that place, except for Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk, Master.\u201dThat\u2019s funny. I shook my head firmly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\u201cWhy? It will be a good memory if we go together.\u201d\u201cIt would be only you.\u201dI asked Woo Seo-hyuk, pushing Park Geon-ho away.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who answered honestly, unlike his blunt expression, continued.\u201cBut it\u2019s a matter that has already been decided and I\u2019m just following the Master\u2019s order.\u201d\u201cI understand\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a bit rude to ask for a change because you feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s Park Geon-ho\u2019s cursing right now, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to take them as trustworthy ones in many ways?\u201d\u201cEven though Team Leader Park Geon-ho is not very trustworthy. On the contrary, his personality of being easily excited is a source of anxiety for me.\u201d\u201cBeing easily excited\u2026 You\u2019re talking too rudely. If I had really done that, Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk would not have been able to stand still like this now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give it back literally. Thank you for my deep patience.\u201dI glanced at Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk, who never backed down, and took a step back. Kim Woo-jin also came close to me and gave me a tired expression.I thought it was just a bit of an uncomfortable relationship, but it was really hard to get along like that. It\u2019s worse than I thought.\u201cStop.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was watching Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk with sullen faces, said.\u201cThere is no change in the team. You should know why, without having to explain why I put you two into the gate, which would normally have been enough for one S-rank.\u201d\u201cSheesh\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPark Geon-ho clicked his tongue as if dissatisfied, and Woo Seo-hyuk quietly nodded. I thought it was over, but Cheon Sa-yeon turned his attention to me.\u201cAnd Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat. Why me.\u201cGet ready to enter the gate. It\u2019s the Area N23 gate.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dWhat the hell is going on? I was startled and said to Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cWhy am I suddenly in there? I am not going!\u201dPark Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk already fought when they made eye contact!Whether it was funny that I was embarrassed or not, Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been making an undesirable expression the whole time, bent the corners of his eyes and smiled brightly.\u201cWho told you to come and call you like that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cTeam Leader Park Geon-ho knows the number too.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, there was an article saying that you\u2019re close to Roheon\u2019s Deputy Master.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster. Are you jealous?\u201dPark Geon-ho intervened with an interesting expression. Shut up! I pushed Park Geon-ho\u2019s strong forearm and opened my mouth.\u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with the gate?\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re not going?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not\u2026!\u201dI was about to reply that \u2018I\u2019m not going\u2019, but suddenly an ominous feeling ran through my heart. I slowly looked at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s smiling face.The corners of his lips rose softly. Black eyes stared straight at me. He was testing what answer I would give.If I seriously refused, I thought our partnership would go away.\u201c\u2026going. I\u2019m going. Is that enough?\u201dWhen I forcefully answered by biting my molars, Cheon Sa-yeon gave me a satisfied smile. That son of a bitch.\u201cI will go too, Master.\u201dWhile swearing at Cheon Sa-yeon inwardly, Kim Woo-jin opened his mouth behind my back. I looked back at him in surprise.\u201cHmm. At the S-grade gate? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, take care of it.\u201d\u201cWait a minute!\u201dKim Woo-jin, has this bastard finally turned crazy? I hurriedly intervened.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of taking care of it? Kim Woo-jin, cancel it immediately.\u201d\u201cNo. I will go too.\u201d\u201cHe wants to go.\u201dI rubbed my trembling forehead.Am I the only one here who is normal? Kim Woo-jin, who said that he would follow to the S-grade gate with a C-rank body, was also a problem, but Cheon Sa-yeon, who allowed him, was by no means sane.\u201cWhat if you allow doing that? It\u2019s because the gate is unstable and it\u2019s a mess.\u201d (\uadf8\uac78 \ud5c8\ub77d\ud574 \uc8fc\uc2dc\uba74 \uc5b4\ub5a1\ud569\ub2c8\uae4c?, not sure)\u201cTwo S-rank people and Han Yi-gyeol go too, but there\u2019s only one C-rank.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. I want to go.\u201dI looked at Kim Woo-jin, who was pulling my arm. Kim Woo-jin trembled at my cold gaze, but he insisted on going to the end.\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was watching me calmly, clapped his hands to evoke the atmosphere.\u201cLet\u2019s start with tidying up. First of all, Kim Woo-jin. I don\u2019t mind if you go to the gate, but you have to get the consent of the team members first.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 yes.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. For a detailed explanation of the gate, listen to Team Leader Park Geon-ho and get ready. Because this gate may also be abnormal.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d\u201cIt would be better for Team Leader Park Geon-ho and Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk to keep their attitudes clear as they involved others.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNice. Get out now.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon kicked us out with a smile.I came out of the hallway and with a sigh, I called the causative agent.\u201cTeam Leader Park Geon-ho\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha. This is how it goes.\u201dPark Geon-ho laughed awkwardly, whether he felt sorry or not.\u201cI will go to the gate. Instead, you will get paid. You have to listen to my request later.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll give you anything.\u201dPark Geon-ho raised his hands as if surrendering. Woo Seo-hyuk pushed Park Geon-ho away and held out the documents.\u201cThis is the Area N23 gate material. I already know this, so it would be better for Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0to take it.\u201d\u201cAh. Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll see you when we leave. Then.\u201dWhether he didn\u2019t want to be here anymore, Woo Seo-hyuk quickly turned his back and walked away.\u201c\u2026are you going there too, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cSince we met, maybe dinner together?\u201d\u201cWhat dinner is at 3 o\u2019clock?\u201d\u201cSo lunch?\u201d\u201cI refuse.\u201dLeaving behind Park Geon-ho, who was sad, I returned to the room on the 23rd floor. As soon as I closed the door and only the two of us were left with Kim Woo-jin, I brought out the words I had endured with.\u201cYou already know what I\u2019m going to say, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin opened his mouth with a dejected face at my resolute eyes.\u201cI want to go. Of course, I know it doesn\u2019t help\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is saying because it doesn\u2019t help? I\u2019m against it because it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just stay by your side. As the Master said, it\u2019s a safe team, so it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d\u201cEven if the gate is normal, you shouldn\u2019t. I know it\u2019s dangerous, but why the hell are you going to follow me?\u201dIt was frustrating to see Kim Woo-jin, who was difficult to understand. If an S+ grade monster appeared, there was a limit to protecting him.\u201cDoes the S-grade look ridiculous just because you\u2019ve been to an SS-grade gate? Will you stick by my side? Even if you go in, I can\u2019t always protect you. You can\u2019t predict what will happen if the monsters come.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI never agree, so if you want to go, do whatever you want. Instead, I won\u2019t care if you\u2019re in danger or not. Okay?\u201dKim Woo-jin bit his lip. It seemed that my words were extremely upsetting. I thought it was a bit too much, but I turned around without apologizing.The most sullen guy I\u2019ve ever seen kept looking at me. I deliberately kept a stiff expression and waited for an answer that he would not go, but Kim Woo-jin did not give up in the end.\u2018Are you going to enter the gate fighting me?\u2019It was difficult to understand Kim Woo-jin, who was trying to find a dangerous place on his own feet. I forcefully swallowed a sigh that filled my throat.\u2018\u2026still, he can\u2019t.\u2019If you gave permission with a clumsy heart and got really seriously hurt. If the situation was unfavourable and the treatment was delayed, his life would be in danger or if there was a disability would remain.I can\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019ve made up my weakened mind.* * *\u201cThe atmosphere is a bit bad.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who came to play after work, saw Kim Woo-jin feeling depressed and said to me.\u201cNot only Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0but also Yi-gyeol-ssi. Did something happen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dI laughed awkwardly and explained what had happened during the day. Min Ah-rin, who had been listening with interest, tilted her head at the part where Kim Woo-jin with his stubbornness.\u201cWhy? I think it\u2019ll be fine if you go together.\u201d\u201cWhy are you even saying that, Min Ah-rin-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh. There was no problem with the SS-grade gate. Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0is good at judging situations and moves quickly. Besides, it was convenient because he helped heal the injured team members.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still dangerous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same for the healers and measurers who don\u2019t have combat ability.\u201d\u201cUmm.\u201dI frowned and retraced at her words calmly. Definitely\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI heard that Team Leader Park Geon-ho and Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk are also going. Then you will clear it more easily than any other B-grades.\u201dIs that so? After looking at Kim Woo-jin, who was persistent and stubborn, and listening to Min Ah-rin\u2019s explanation, my tightly bound heart began to shake.When I thought about it, Min Ah-rin lowered her voice slightly and opened her mouth.\u201cAnd\u2026 Please understand Woo-jin-ssi\u2019s feelings as well. Every time Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0chooses only dangerous gates and comes out even injured, how lonely he must have been waiting alone.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHearing those words, I suddenly felt so bad for Kim Woo-jin, who had only me as his friend. Was it like that\u2026 I guess I was too insensitive.\u201cIf you are so worried, shall I go with you? Even so, I have to schedule the gate by tomorrow, but I\u2019m still thinking because there\u2019s no specific place I want to go.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s S-grade, are you okay with that?\u201d\u201cAs I said before, there are two S-rank people and Yi-gyeol-ssi, so what should I worry about?\u201d\u201cIt would be great if Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0would come.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good. So Woo-jin-ssi\u2019s problem has been solved, right?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWoo-jin-ssi!\u201d\u201cMi, Min Ah-rin-ssi?\u201dMin Ah-rin, who ran to Kim Woo-jin before I even stopped her, said with a broad smile.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0allowed us to go to the gate! Good for you.\u201d\u201cRe, really? Are you giving me permission?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin looked at me with twinkling eyes.I was going to think about it a little more. I can\u2019t help it\u2026 I sighed and asked Kim Woo-jin to do something.\u201cNever leave my side.\u201d\u201cUung!\u201d\u201cWhen I go out to battle, no matter what happens, you move with the healer team.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan I go?\u201dNow I can\u2019t say no.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t need to give you permission. But it\u2019s true that it\u2019s dangerous, so just keep your word to be careful.\u201d\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had been withering until just now, came to life at once. Min Ah-rin, who was looking at Kim Woo-jin, who looked happy, opened her mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s resolved well, so let\u2019s order something delicious to eat! Chicken or pizza!\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter because it was still before dinner. I nodded and answered.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to order, let\u2019s eat both, huh.\u201d\u201cI will order.\u201dKim Woo-jin picked up his cell phone.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to order both chicken and pizza, I like this place.\u201d\u201cSet B?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Set B plus extra coke\u2026\u201dI sighed as I saw Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin murmured to each other. As Min Ah-rin said, I hope there is no problemPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A car stopped in front of the guild through the humid air.\u201cGood morning.\u201dUnlike usual, Park Geon-ho, dressed in a combat uniform, rolled down the driver\u2019s window and winked at me. I asked with disgust.\u201cI heard the driver was coming\u2026 Was it you, Team Leader?\u201d\u201cThe best driver ever. Get in.\u201dIt was quite far from here to Area N23, so I couldn\u2019t help but get a ride. I got into the car, dragging Kim Woo-jin, who was staring at Park Geon-ho.\u201cOh. The car is different from last time, Team Leader.\u201d\u201cThis time I got a new one. How is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know much about cars, but\u2026 this looks great!\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dPark Geon-ho and Min Ah-rin, who sat in the passenger seat, chatted in a friendly atmosphere. As I watched it, I passed the lollipop into Kim Woo-jin\u2019s mouth, who seemed unhappy all the time. It was a snack I received from Min Ah-rin earlier.* * *Guild members and Woo Seo-hyuk were waiting at the Area N23, which had been running for over an hour, to enter the gate together.\u201cTeam Leader!\u201d\u201cTeam Leader is here!\u201d\u201cTeam Leadeeer!\u201dWhen the guild members who had gathered together found Park Geon-ho getting out of the car, they flashed their eyes and rushed over. I flinched at the force without realizing it, but Park Geon-ho opened his mouth with a tired expression.\u201cWhat else? Did you have an accident without even entering the gate?\u201d\u201cLee Dong-joo (\uc774\ub3d9\uc8fc) used his powers on me! Look at this, it hurts!\u201d\u201cPark Min-jae (\ubc15\ubbfc\uc7ac), this bastard left the snack bag he prepared yesterday!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful, Dong-joo. If the bastard gets the first hit, he has to accept defeat.\u201d\u201cDong-joo is like that. But it\u2019s kind of weird to leave a snack bag behind. I put my chocolate in there, too.\u201d\u201cAh, Team Leader. Hurry up. It\u2019s annoying watching them arguing.\u201d\u201cDid you see the expressions on the healer teams\u2019 faces when Lee Dong-joo and Park Min-jae fought? They are really very pitiful. They have to stay with them at the gate for the next three days. If it were me, I would be embarrassed and run away.\u201dTen members of the guild with huge bodies began to pour out a huge amount of words around us. It felt like my ears were being attacked.\u201cBut, Team Leader, who are the people who came in the car with you?\u201d\u201cOh, I know him!\u201dA man named Lee Dong-joo looked at me and shouted.\u201cSS-ranks in both hands!\u201d\u201cPuhaha.\u201dAt the same time as my expression cooled, Park Geon-ho, who was standing next to me, burst into laughter.\u201cAh~ That A-rank mercenary? Is it real?\u201d\u201cHey. You\u2019re Han Yi-gyeol, right? Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cShake hands with me, too.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dI received handshakes from all over the place one by one. The corners of Kim Woo-jin\u2019s eyebrows, who watched it, became sharper.\u201cAre you close with our Team Leader?\u201d\u201cOh my gosh. What is it, Team Leader? Do you know Han Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cTeam Leader is close with the Master. I guess he introduced him?\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was asked the question, grinned and put his arm on my shoulder. As soon as I got it, Kim Woo-jin threw it out instead of me.\u201cWe met at the SS-grade gate.\u201d\u201cAh, right. Team Leader had been there, right?\u201d\u201cI forgot.\u201d\u201cWho are the two behind Han Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cThese two are members who have been to SS-grade gate. Healer Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0and Master\u2019s Attendant Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cAh~ Healer Min Ah-rin. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet such a famous person like this.\u201d\u201cDoes it seem like Attendant Kim Woo-jin attendant really hates Team Leader?\u201d\u201cI hate our Team Leader, too. He seems like a good fit for me.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who shook his head as if he couldn\u2019t stop the noisy team members, introduced them.\u201cThese guys belong to the Special Operations Division. Everyone is a little noisy, but their abilities are worth using, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe explanation reminded me of the words I heard at the SS-grade gate.\u2018They said it\u2019s a den of crazy people. Several people said they were laughing happily, covered in blood in the hallways\u2026\u2019Min Ah-rin must have listened as well, but she shook hands with her team members with a bright smile on her face that she knew nothing.\u201cNice to meet you. Please take good care of me in this gate.\u201dThe male team member, who was lucky enough to shake hands with Min Ah-rin while standing in the front, grinned. What a man.\u201cAfter the greetings are over, I hope you will be ready to depart soon.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who was watching us from behind, interrupted with a hard voice. It was an appropriate point as there were 15 minutes left until departure.\u201cIs there anyone who hasn\u2019t prepared for departure yet?\u201d\u201cWhat about you, Team Leader? You just came, when are you ready?\u201d\u201cAll the Team Leader need is an iron ball, what does he need to prepare? So where is your sword? Did you exchange it for candy?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have eyes? It\u2019s on my back.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Is that a sword or a guitar on your back? He\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201cPahahak! Look at this! I brought you this broken dagger!\u201d\u201cOh, damn it. Hey, does anyone have any daggers left?\u201d\u201cWho else carries such a thing other than you? Now go to the guild and get it.\u201d\u201cWe have 12 minutes left, is that possible? If you don\u2019t come on time, just throw it away.\u201dThe louder the guild members were, the colder Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s expression became. In the meantime, Park Geon-ho, rather than stopping it, was busy babbling between them.Seeing this, I think I can understand why Woo Seo-hyuk hates Park Geon-ho.Be strong, Woo Seo-hyuk. I sent support to Woo Seo-hyuk, who touched his forehead with a tired expression as if he had a headache.* * *In the end, we entered the gate 10 minutes later than the originally scheduled time.\u201cBecause Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk is too stiff.\u201d\u201cWhat do you do on the weekend, Secretary?\u201d\u201cWould you like to bet? I vote for work.\u201d\u201cYou work on the weekends? Does such a person exist?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk who lives a boring life, I think it would be.\u201d\u201cBut. It\u2019s hard to imagine him watching movies, drinking beer, and playing games like everyone else.\u201d\u201cYou idiots. Basically, someone like Secretary goes to a club and has a lot of fun. Look at his face. Will the girls leave him alone?\u201d\u201cHis is better than your face.\u201d\u201cAre you done, Shim Soo-yeon (\uc2ec\uc218\uc5f0)?\u201dUpon hearing this, Woo Seo-hyuk sighed with a tired face. The suffering Woo Seo-hyuk could not be seen and Park Geon-ho, who was in charge, looked around with a refreshing face.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Be careful as there may be some problem with the gate.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a desert again.\u201d\u201cYes. But it is different from SS-grade. We\u2019re going inside that historical site.\u201dAt Min Ah-rin\u2019s words, Park Geon-ho pointed to the historical site in front of him.The triangular-shaped ruins similar to pyramids were huge. The historical site that standing alone under the bright sunlight was pretty cool.Park Geon-ho pushed the door of the huge historical site.\u00a0Geugeugeugeuk, the door slowly opened as sand dripped from above.Torches were burning at regular intervals in the sandstone wide corridor. Park Geon-ho, who was moving forward with careful steps, stopped his steps while looking to the right.Kirk. Kirrk.Within five minutes after entering the historical site, the sounds of beasts roared all over the place. I remembered the gate material I had looked at beforehand.There were three types of monsters that appeared in the beginning. Goblins, Kobolds, Dwarf zombies (\uace0\ube14\ub9b0, \ucf54\ubcfc\ud2b8, \ub09c\uc7c1\uc774\uc880\ube44). Among them, the monster that appeared this time was,Kieeek!Kieek! Kururuk. Kuruk.It was a bunch of Kobolds. A Kobold with a wrinkled face, skinny limbs, a bulging belly and a blood-stained saw, drooling green saliva, looked quite disgusting. The healer team, including Min Ah-rin, frowned and retreated.\u201cClose team.\u201dAs Park Geon-ho rolled his iron ball into his hand and spoke, the five men came forward with their weapons.\u201cOh, Team Leader. Are you going to throw the balls when we fight again?\u201d\u201cIt was at which gate two months ago. Who was the one who got his back burn because of the Team Leader\u2019s ability?\u201d\u201cIs that Jae-hyuk?\u201d\u201cStop talking and get to work. OK?\u201dPark Geon-ho flew the iron ball he had placed on his finger as if it were bouncing.\u00a0Kieeek!\u00a0The explosion spurted fire and the Kobolds screamed. At the same time, the close team attacked, wielding their weapons.Kobolds were B-grade monsters, but they were not easy to deal with due to their large number and vicious habits. I watched the close team fight by killing the Kobolds running in front of the healer team.\u2018That\u2019s amazing.\u2019Whatever the rumours were, they\u2019re famous for a reason. As the Special Operations Division was going on a business trip to the Middle East Gate, which was famous with an atrocious environment, they were not pushed by the Kobold viciousness.\u201cAh, Kobold\u2019s blood splashed in your face!\u201dAmong them, the one who drew the most attention was a guild member with a long spear. As a result of this, she, with her ponytail hair, who was similar height, showed golden electricity and her strong muscles every time she swung her spear.I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the sight of him clad in the green blood of a kobold and swinging her spear with excitement. I thought his name came out when he was talking with the team members. Was it Shim Soo-yeon?More than 20 Kobolds were slaughtered in 10 minutes. The close team returned as they stepped on the floor covered in green blood.\u201cAh, that\u2019s why Goblins or Dwarf zombies are better. I threw away one of my clothes.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you developing something like a potion that wipes away dirt when you spray it?\u201d\u201cWhy would the research team make such a thing?\u201dWhile the close team grumbled while shaking off their clothes soaked in Kobold blood, the person with the ability to measure the grade has finished.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was waiting for the measurement result next to the person with the ability to measure, questioned the ambiguous reaction.\u201cThis is a bit odd.\u201d\u201cDid its grade go up?\u201d\u201cNo, rather\u2026\u201dThe measuring ability, who hesitated for a moment, continued.\u201cIts rating has gone down.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dDid the numbers drop? I approached Park Geon-ho for a detailed explanation.\u201cHow far did it fall?\u201d\u201cThe previous record was 56.8% B grade, now it is 12.99% B grade. Of course, the numbers are slightly different each time, but\u2026 It\u2019s the first time it\u2019s fallen this far.\u201d\u201cThe number has not risen, but rather has fallen\u2026 Should this be considered as an anomaly?\u201dSo far, there had been several occasions where the number soared and the rating went up but never before had the number fallen as much as this time.\u201cI get it for now. If there are any other problems, please report them immediately.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen the measuring ability returned, Park Geon-ho sighed with a dissatisfied expression on his face.\u201cI expected an S+ grade monster to appear, but the numbers are rather falling\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you relieved? The risk is lowered.\u201d\u201cDisappointed\u2026\u201d\u201cBe an adult, Team Leader Park Geon-ho.\u201dI was clicking my tongue as I saw Park Geon-ho, who was truly sad, and Woo Seo-hyuk approached me.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cBecause the ratings are weird.\u201d\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cNo, it fell the other way around. The anomaly is correct, but\u2026 it\u2019s an unusual case.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk also looked surprised at my explanation.\u201cThat\u2019s a rather surprising result.\u201d\u201cThat said, but I feel a bit uncomfortable.\u201dPerhaps it was because I worked hard every time I entered the gate, so even if the difficulty level was lowered, I was not easily relieved.At the words, Woo Seo-hyuk nodded his head with a calm expression.\u201cIt is true that the gate has changed due to an anomaly, so it is right to be alert like Han Yi-gyeol-ssi. I will pass this on to everyone.\u201dI turned my body and looked at Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s back as he walked towards the guild members. The sticky blood from Kobold\u2019s corpse was clinging to the soles of his shoes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before I knew it, dwarf zombie corpses were all around.\u201cWow, that\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cPlease raise your hand if anyone is hurt!\u201d\u201cDoes anyone have a thousand left?\u201d (\ucc9c \ub0a8\ub294 \uac70 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c?, not sure)The guild members who had a break sat down with tired expressions on their faces. Meanwhile, the measuring ability and Park Geon-ho checked the number of dwarf zombies.\u201cIt dropped from 67.2% of B grade to 11.32%.\u201d\u201cAt this point, it is clear that there\u2019s an abnormality.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was worried by tapping the corner of his mouth, said.\u201cLet\u2019s keep measuring\u2026 If you find a monster with a lowered rating, let me know.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHearing the conversation between the two nearby, I thought as I tapped my toe at the dwarf zombie corpse that almost fell to the C-grade.\u2018There\u2019s a high probability that there will be other problems besides the downgrade.\u2019In this gate, the level of monsters that appear on each floor was different, and once you went upstairs, you couldn\u2019t go down.\u2018I want to take a look by myself before going up to the second floor.\u2019I glanced at Kim Woo-jin, who was sitting next to me. He\u2019ll definitely be against it. But I couldn\u2019t even take him with me.\u201cWh, what?\u201dWhile looking at him intently and contemplating what to do, Kim Woo-jin, who felt my gaze, withdrew his body and frowned.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d\u201cWho said what? I just saw you.\u201d\u201cYou two, aren\u2019t you hungry? Would you like some peanut butter bread?\u201dMin Ah-rin handed me and Kim Woo-jin a bag of bread.\u201cThank you.\u201dI was really hungry, so I put the bread in my mouth right away. Min Ah-rin, who was standing next to me eating bread, smiled and said.\u201cThis reminds me of the time when we went to an SS-grade gate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dOnce again, I realized that it had been quite some time since I entered Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body. It\u2019s been about two months.\u201cCome to think about it, the three of us don\u2019t really have much contact points, but it\u2019s amazing that we\u2019ve become so close.\u201dAt that, I smiled bitterly. Both Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin reminded me that Cheon Sa-yeon deliberately bound me to catch my weakness.Pushing away the bitter thoughts, I deliberately answered lightly.\u201cWell, what does that have to do with getting close? Even if you have a lot of contacts, it\u2019s hard to get along if your personality doesn\u2019t match.\u201dMin Ah-rin looked behind me and added a word.\u201cLike those two?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dWhen I turned around, there were Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk, standing glaring at each other. No, what happened in that brief time?\u201cI can\u2019t understand that.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason I need to convince Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk?\u201d\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s a plan that won\u2019t convince even a single member of your team?\u201d\u201cIn such a situation, I think it is right to check thoroughly. Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk didn\u2019t look like that, but he must be very scared.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to act hastily at a time when the team has to move together.\u201d\u201cDo we need to be more careful than this? It\u2019s safer to turn everything inside out.\u201d\u201cOnce you enter the gate, you should always be prepared for the unexpected. If something goes wrong by touching the inside of the gate, who is responsible?\u201d\u201cOf course, I am responsible for it. Are you afraid I\u2019m such trash that doesn\u2019t even do that?\u201dI rubbed my forehead and sighed. They are fighting in earnest\u2026\u201cOh, they\u2019re fighting. They\u2019re fighting.\u201d\u201cSecretary Woo Seo-hyuk was very patient.\u201d\u201cBut, isn\u2019t the Team Leader right? If it\u2019s an anomaly, you have to find out.\u201d\u201cIn a proper way, the Secretary is right. You don\u2019t need to be fussy. It\u2019s better to just break it roughly and leave.\u201d\u201cIs he going to grab him by the collar? Should we make a bet?\u201d\u201c10,000 won for the Team Leader to win. Who can beat that person\u2019s stubbornness?\u201d\u201cIt was no joke that the Secretary was stubborn, too. I have 20,000 won for the Secretary.\u201d\u201cOnce you go into close combat, it\u2019s hard to beat the Secretary. Secretary, 30,000 won!\u201d\u201cIf the Team Leader throws an iron ball with the intention of self-destructing, the Secretary can\u2019t easily win.\u201dThe guild members only watched the fight between the two with interest, and there was no sign of stopping any of them.I\u2019d really want to grab the collar and punch them.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stop them\u2026\u201d\u201cI think they\u2019ll fight properly if we leave it alone.\u201dMin Ah-rin agreed with me, but she didn\u2019t seem to bother to come forward. Kim Woo-jin\u2026 was indifferent as always.\u2018Am I the only one here\u2026\u2019I really didn\u2019t want to join, but if I left it alone, I thought I would have big trouble.\u201cStop it, both of you.\u201dThe onlookers were even more enthusiastic when I stepped in between Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk, who were staring at each other.\u201cOh, the mercenary interrupted!\u201d\u201cMercenary, 10,000 won!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bet, too. 20,000 won for mercenary!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get 20,000 won and go for 30,000 won!\u201d\u201cLook at that dignified figure. I bet, too. 40,000 won.\u201d\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t he an A-rank mercenary? Why is the stake the highest?\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to win. I feel it.\u201dOh, my.I ignored the guild members\u2019 conversation and opened my mouth.\u201cDo you want to end up having such a harsh conversation?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cThat one started first.\u201dAt my words, Woo Seo-hyuk immediately apologized, and Park Geon-ho shamelessly blamed the other party. I asked Park Geon-ho, looking pathetic.\u201cWhat are you doing this for?\u201d\u201cHm. It\u2019s not something great. I was thinking of going to a place I had been bothered about for a while now.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cThere is a hidden path at the side of the stairs going up to the second floor. It\u2019s the only place I haven\u2019t been able to check since there is a clear time limit.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you think it has something to do with the gate anomaly?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily like that. The situation must have been like this, so it\u2019s not bad to go.\u201d\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi, are you against it?\u201d\u201cIt would be fine if the gate had no anomalies, but it is dangerous for now.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk is right. It was a lot of pressure to go to places we weren\u2019t sure about.However, that was only when the whole team moved.\u201cThen how about this?\u201dAfter thinking about it for a while, I said to the two stiff people who didn\u2019t give up their opinions.\u201cI will go to the place the Team Leader said by myself.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe atmosphere around me became cold in an instant. What is this reaction? I quickly added an explanation.\u201cIt\u2019s a burden if we all move together, as Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0said, so if I go and check it out, isn\u2019t it good in many ways? I can fly, so it\u2019s easy to run away.\u201d\u201cYou cannot.\u201dBefore Park Geon-ho, who had a surprised expression on his face, could say anything, Woo Seo-hyuk shook his head with a clear firm face.\u201cIt is very dangerous to walk around unconfirmed sections by yourself. I absolutely cannot agree.\u201d\u201cUm, I\u2019ll let you know if it\u2019s possible\u2026 That\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dAmong the onlookers with subtle expressions, Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin rushed towards us. In particular, Kim Woo-jin opened his mouth with a ferocious look that I had never seen before.\u201cWhat are you talking about, now? Where are you going alone?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 No, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi. But this is not right.\u201dEven Min Ah-rin helped Kim Woo-jin. When I saw it, I was sweating in a cold sweat.\u201cDon\u2019t do it and listen to me. I didn\u2019t come here just to clear the gate. However, moving as a group is risky. So I\u2026\u201d\u201cBut there is no reason for Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0to handle it alone.\u201dI laughed awkwardly.\u2018I can\u2019t handle it\u2026\u2019Even if it wasn\u2019t, I wanted to take a look inside the gate by myself, so it was a good opportunity for me.I didn\u2019t know there would be so many people against it.\u201c\u2026Team Leader.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy matter to think about wandering around the gates alone. If you\u2019re unlucky, you won\u2019t even be able to find the body.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cStill, you cannot. I\u2019ll give you permission then I ask Master what he will say.\u201dWhy are you suddenly acting like Cheon Sa-yeon? I went crazy.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I understand.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk nodded his head with an expression of realizing something at Park Geon-ho\u2019s words. What\u2019s up, what the hell?\u201cDon\u2019t make weird excuses.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse. I mean it more sincere than ever.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit scary to think that the Master will nag like a mother-in-law.\u201dIs he nagging because of me? Cheon Sa-yeon? I don\u2019t know what kind of conversation this is.Min Ah-rin opened her mouth to me with her worried face.\u201cI am against going alone. Even this is an S-grade gate. Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0already comes in injured when he enters the gate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone is against Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0because they are worried about you, so please understand this time, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u2026I don\u2019t think you\u2019re worried about me, but you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll be nagged by Cheon Sa-yeon.Still, I couldn\u2019t keep insisting on talking like that. In the end, I had no choice but to give up my opinion and follow it.\u201cI understand. Then let\u2019s think about another way.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s keep an eye on the situation for now.\u201d\u201cThat would be nice. There is a possibility that the rating numbers will return to normal.\u201dIn response to my answer, we gathered opinions as if when Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk fought.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll have to look for another opportunity\u2026 Ask Cheon Sa-yeon to come in alone and see it later.\u2019Since I found out that there was a hidden path, I wanted to check it out if possible.\u201cThen\u2026 shall we finish clearing the first floor and talk again?\u201dStill, coming twice was a waste of time, so I\u2019d like to fix it this time. When I asked with a smile while hiding his true intentions, Woo Seo-hyuk looked at me and answered with a hard voice.\u201cNo matter what the circumstances, I will not make the decision to send Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt meant not even to dream about it. You\u2019re too quick. I clicked my tongue inside and nodded.\u201cWhat\u2026 Why such a happy ending?\u201d\u201cWhat happens with the bet?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see? The Healer is the ultimate winner.\u201d\u201cUm. You can\u2019t beat the Healer.\u201dThe onlookers were extremely disappointed by the situation that ended without any problems. I think they really wanted Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk to fight.It was amazing how only people similar to Park Gun-ho gathered. At this point, it was enough to change the name to a fun-loving group rather than special operations.\u201cAfter some rest, let\u2019s go again.\u201dPark Geon-ho ordered a piece of bread that he couldn\u2019t eat because he was fighting with Woo Seo-hyuk. Having become a reckless person for no reason, I was dragged by Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin with both arms grabbed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI quietly called Min Ah-rin who was close to me.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you walk a little further away from me?\u201d\u201cOh my, you are too much.\u201dIt\u2019s not too much.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi, who treats me like a troublemaker, is even worse\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you treated me like a child? Disappointing. I\u2019m just afraid that you\u2019ll go somewhere without saying a word.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m not going. You too, let me go.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was clinging to my right arm, opened his axe eyes and looked at me. What, man?\u201cPeople around us think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\u201cI know you don\u2019t care.\u201dIt\u2019s not like that.In the end, I gave up my freedom of both arms and looked forward. The close team was killing the monster blocking the stairs going up to the second floor.This monster was a C-grade, which was barely maintaining the B-grade, dropped by sharply. The guild members, who had to face the C-grade at a time that would not be fun even if they were B-grade, dealt with the monsters in an instant with a bored expression.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201dWhen the battle was over, Min Ah-rin left with healers to take care of the close team. Taking advantage of the disappearance of one watcher, I diligently rolled my eyes (T/N: more like looked around) and tried to find out where the hidden path that Park Geon-ho was talking about was.Even if I can\u2019t go this time, I might be able to come alone with Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s permission later. It would be beneficial to know.\u201c\u2026Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had fixed his gaze on me, called me in a suspicious voice. Maybe it\u2019s because there were only quick-witted people around, Kim Woo-jin was getting better with each passing day.\u201cDon\u2019t do useless things.\u201d\u201cNo, what did I do?\u201dI pretended to be innocent and avoided his gaze. Then, I thought I had to change my method, Kim Woo-jin gently lowered his sharply raised eyebrows and said in a sad voice.\u201cYou told me to never fall behind when you enter the gate. And then you\u2019re thinking of going somewhere alone\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s.\u201dI didn\u2019t know the difficulty would be this easy. If the rate of rating reduction was this fast, there was a high probability that A-grade monsters would not appear on the second floor.\u201cEven if the monster\u2019s grade has dropped, it\u2019s still dangerous because I\u2019m a C-rank.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even others so, you should always be careful.\u201d\u201cYeah. So don\u2019t go anywhere without me. I\u2019m scared. Do you get it?\u201dKim Woo-jin grabbed my arm tightly. There was an uneasy feeling on his face. I guess he\u2019s scared is real.\u2018Did I think too much about myself?\u2019Kim Woo-jin would have believed in me and came in. At first, I was against it, but in the end, it was me who gave him permission and said that I would protect him.\u201c\u2026okay, let go of my arm. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that you\u2019re going to go around the gate alone again.\u201dThat\u2019s a bit\u2026I sighed and said quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s dangerous at other times, but in this case, my plan is not bad either. Due to the nature of my ability, I can run away even if I run into a monster. To be honest, I don\u2019t understand why everyone is against it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin twisted his face and made a painful expression.\u201cWhy are you talking like that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou only think about efficiency. I know that the gate risk has dropped a lot due to the rating changes. That doesn\u2019t guarantee that where you\u2019re going is safe.\u201d\u201cI know that. So if it\u2019s dangerous, I\u2019ll run away\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dKim Woo-jin said in a bitter voice.\u201cWhy do you care so much about the gate?\u201dI frowned at the unexpected question.\u201cIf it had nothing to do with you, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved this far. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t open my mouth right away. Looking at me who didn\u2019t answer anything like this, Kim Woo-jin made a face that he knew it would happen.\u201cGathering data from gates with confirmed anomalies and trying to go directly to the point of taking risks\u2026 Of course, I have no choice but to notice it. I\u2019m just sticking with you.\u201dKim Woo-jin bluntly criticized me for not caring about him at all. There was no excuse for misunderstanding. Because what Kim Woo-jin said was true.\u201cI can do anything you want.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to help you throw yourself out like this. I will stop it somehow.\u201dI sighed and lowered my gaze. I knew what Kim Woo-jin was talking about. But it wasn\u2019t the time to relax.Even at this moment, the gate was broken, and as a result, victims continued to arise. Fortunately, no deaths had been reported so far, but that was only a matter of quick response and luck.As it became difficult to predict the difficulty due to changes in the gate, more and more talented people felt the burden of the clearing.When I looked at each of these facts one by one, my heart became frustrated. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean I was going to jump into a dangerous situation.Even if it was a little cumbersome and even close, wouldn\u2019t it be good for the future to just dig out as much as possible? Even if you got hurt in the process, you would get better soon if you got treatment anyway.\u2026unless I explained that I could be the cause of the gate anomaly, Kim Woo-jin wouldn\u2019t understand.\u300cIt\u2019s fun for me, so I don\u2019t care what the cause is. But I don\u2019t know if others will take it that way.\u300dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words ran through my mind. I bit my lips several times, but in the end, I turned away from Kim Woo-jin without saying anything.At the gesture of refusal, Kim Woo-jin shut his mouth.* * *After processing the monsters, Park Geon-ho decided to sleep and move tomorrow. Min Ah-rin approached me as I sat looking at the bonfire.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, did you fight with Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0again?\u201d\u201c\u2026um, rather than fighting.\u201d\u201cThe atmosphere was not a joke.\u201dI glanced at the back of Kim Woo-jin\u2019s back, who was helping the guild members organize their surroundings.After that uncomfortable conversation, Kim Woo-jin was still by my side, but he didn\u2019t say this or that or grab my arm as usual.It was a difficult situation for me as well. Kim Woo-jin wanted an explanation, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201cI think I said something that made him offended.\u201d\u201cI can understand what\u2019s upsetting him about even if I don\u2019t listen to the explanation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI asked cautiously at the words I could feel the bones.\u201cWell, maybe Min Ah-rin-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat am I? I don\u2019t know if Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0was stubborn, but you said you wouldn\u2019t go.\u201dI was thinking of coming separately later, but I felt guilty for no reason and only smiled awkwardly. Just imagining Min Ah-rin\u2019s anger was quite frightening.\u201cThe situation seems much more serious than last time, so I can\u2019t intervene.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will be resolved in time.\u201d\u201cThen that would be a relief\u2026 I don\u2019t think Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0has a personality that can be easily passed on.\u201d\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201dBecause of Kim Woo-jin, I couldn\u2019t stop doing what I had to do. If you\u2019re disappointed with me and get farther away from me because of this, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel a little upset.\u201cIf Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0hears what you just said, he will be very sad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m going to give up easily. But emotions don\u2019t change when other people make an effort, don\u2019t they?\u201dMin Ah-rin smiled at me with a complicated expression. The sound of a burning bonfire resounded between me and Min Ah-rin as silence came. I looked at the blazing yellow light and added, meaning not to worry.\u201cAnyway, I have no intention of acting separately even though I\u2019m worried about the people around me. Kim Woo-jin\u2026 I\u2019ll try to solve it well.\u201d\u201cHmm. I like it. I will believe you.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who answered playfully, raised her body up.\u201cHave a nice dream, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi, too.\u201dWhen Min Ah-rin left me, Kim Woo-jin, who had been wandering for nothing even after finishing organizing, returned.\u201cKim Woo-jin.\u201dThe expression on Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face, sitting next to me hesitantly, didn\u2019t even look right.\u201cYou look tired. Get some sleep.\u201d\u201cA little later\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was quietly looking at the bonfire, opened his mouth with a hesitant voice.\u201cWhat we talked about earlier.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not like I\u2019m just trying to force myself to listen to things you don\u2019t want to say. To be honest, even if you don\u2019t like me very much, I understand\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t flip it over. I can\u2019t explain it because there are other circumstances.\u201dIt was a sincere statement, but Kim Woo-jin didn\u2019t really believe it.\u201cI know that my life is important. More than you think. So, don\u2019t worry about useless things and just go to sleep.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had moved his lips to say something more, apparently changed his mind, nodded his head without saying anything, and went to the place where the bed was prepared.We woke up early in the morning and walked around the gate all day, so it must have been quite a daunting schedule for Kim Woo-jin, who was a C-rank. As expected, Kim Woo-jin fell asleep shortly after lying down, exhaling his even breath.When there were only a few awake, including me, a quiet silence came. Looking at the glimmering bonfire, I remembered the gates I had experienced one after another.\u2018It seems that every gate I enter has a problem.\u2019There was a 50% chance that an anomaly would occur in the gate. It was not that only problematic gates were not likely to be caught, but it was true that it was unnatural.\u2018To find a solution, we have to investigate the gate\u2026\u2019Since I couldn\u2019t figure out how much influence I had on the gate, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could directly go inside the gate and investigate it myself like I did until now.A bitter laugh came out. The original plan was to raise Ha Tae-heon as quickly as possible and then try to run away while Cheon Sa-yeon lost his gaze.Instead of hiding from running away, I had a cooperative relationship with Cheon Sa-yeon and was walking through the gates\u2026 Even Ha Tae-heon looked hate me.I felt absurd that I was proud of myself for being able to wield the future at will by using the novel.\u2018What should I do in the future?\u2019There was a high probability that things would go wrong if I made a plan because I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but it was still better to think about it roughly than to move recklessly.I remembered the contents of the data that Kim Woo-jin brought. Most of it was memorized, so it was easy to remember only the information I wanted.\u2018Jayna Guild.\u2019Compared to the Requiem Guild and the Roheon Guild, it was the guild with the fewest anomaly gates. After solving this gate, it didn\u2019t look too bad to go to the Jayna Guild Gate.If I asked Cheon Sa-yeon, he would arrange a seat for me. I was thinking about which grade gate to enter, but someone approached me.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you tired?\u201dWhen I lightly shrugged to signify that it was okay, Woo Seo-hyuk pulled something out of his inventory and held it to me with a blunt expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you are not going to sleep, eating it will help you move tomorrow.\u201dThe light sky-blue item really resembled candy. I greeted my eyes as a token of appreciation and put the candy in my mouth.\u201c\u2026you eat it without any doubt.\u201dIt was sweeter than expected for an item that relieved fatigue. Rolling candy in my mouth, I answered the words that didn\u2019t make sense to Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cShould I be suspicious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but\u2026 do you like sweets?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s more effective than that.\u201dI walked around the gate all day and had a slight headache from thinking about it, but after eating the candy, my mouth felt cooler and my head felt lighter.\u201cThen that\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s an easy-to-find item, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work for some people.\u201dIt was quite an interesting item. If you eat this candy, your fatigue will go away. My body must be A-rank, if it did well, I might be able to walk around without sleeping for a week.\u201cWhere do you get it?\u201dI asked Woo Seo-hyuk for the source, thinking that I should buy several and take them with me.\u201cEven if it is made as safe as possible, it is not an item that is completely free from side effects.\u201dHowever, Woo Seo-hyuk, who had a strange expression on my question, said something else instead of answering it.\u201cYeah, well\u2026 I guess so.\u201dCoffee and beverages containing caffeine had side effects. So of course, this item would have, too. I looked at him with doubt.\u201cI can give you more candy, but somehow Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0seems to be overusing it.\u201dHow did you know? I asked, brushing the back of my head in embarrassment.\u201cThen even it\u2019s a place that sells it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that too. I think there are about 20 of them.\u201d\u201cHaha, no way. Please don\u2019t do that and let me know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still A-rank, so eating a few of these won\u2019t cause any major problems, right?\u201dI asked for it one more time, but Woo Seo-hyuk was adamant.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo, if you\u2019re going to do this, then you shouldn\u2019t give it to me at all. You make people excited for nothing and you really do it so well.I grumbled inwardly, thinking.\u2018I\u2019ll have to ask Cheon Sa-yeon to help me.\u2019For some reason, I felt like I\u2019m getting more and more things to ask Cheon Sa-yeon to do.* * *While the guild members were making up their beds, I, Park Geon-ho, and Woo Seo-hyuk got together once again. It was to decide what to do with the hidden path next to the entrance to the second floor.\u201cTo be honest, I think it\u2019s still worth a visit, but I\u2019m not going to insist.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I go too, but as the person in charge, I can\u2019t send you alone\u2026 This time, it would be better to just clear up to the third floor as usual.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on the same page. You don\u2019t have to go looking for a problem.\u201dAt the end of the discussion, it was decided not to go. Unfortunately, but I thought it would be better to come back later.\u201cEi, that\u2019s not fun.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s boring because the monster level has already been lowered.\u201d\u201cI want to meet new monsters in new places!\u201d\u201cHow about going all the way to the third floor?\u201d\u201cRight. Except for those who are having a hard time~\u201dRather, it was the guild members who resisted the decision. The non-combat team watched with a tired expression as the combat team, who had been regained vitality after a good rest, chatted with excitement.\u201cReject. It\u2019s a reprimand to change the plan and extend the schedule in the first place.\u201d\u201cWhat? That\u2019s a different story. Until yesterday, Team Leader told me to go first.\u201d\u201cAre you betraying me?\u201dPark Geon-ho said pitifully to the protesting guild members.\u201cStupid bastards. Do you know that he changed his opinion because he was afraid of reprimands?\u201d\u201cSo no?\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cAnyway, after reading the reprimand, I\u2019ll write some details. I\u2019m sure because I\u2019ve used it once or twice. What I\u2019m really afraid of is\u2026\u201dPark Geon-ho lowered his voice and said with a serious face.\u201cThe time that is called by the Master. Not this time. I got a feeling. If you act your way, you\u2019ll get a call from the representative office\u2026\u201dI sighed. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s bullshit from start to finish.It was funny he looked pathetic at the guild members. Looking to the side, Woo Seo-hyuk was also looking at Park Geon-ho with contempt.The guild members who were persuaded by Park Geon-ho followed the orders silently. As we went up the stairs to the second floor, a huge door made of sandstone appeared.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who roughly pushed the sand piled up in front of the door with his foot, firmly stepped on the stone engraved with a triangle. To open the door, we had to touch a hidden device.Kugugugung!The sand fell softly and the door went up as if it had opened its mouth. At the same time, a sharp arrow flew towards Park Geon-ho\u2019s head.\u201cHm?\u201dPark Geon-ho, who lightly bowed his neck to avoid the attack, threw the iron ball he was holding inside.Kieeeek!The screams of the monster were heard along with the sound of an explosion. For a while, dozens of arrows flew towards us this time.\u201cStand back!\u201dA guild member, who ran out in front of Park Geon-ho, opened a white curtain.\u00a0Tiing!\u00a0Fortunately, the arrow did not penetrate the shield and fell to the floor.\u201cThis is the first time this has happened. The monster didn\u2019t stay and came out to the front door?\u201dPark Geon-ho tilted his head, frowning. The monsters were knocked down like dominoes by the attack from the long-distance team.After removing the shield and going through the door, I saw a monster corpse that filled the floor. Black skull bones and old bows. As an A-grade monster archer, it was not an easy opponent to die like this.A person with a measuring ability, who checked archer\u2019s level with a serious expression, said to Park Geon-ho.\u201cTeam Leader. It\u2019s bigger than the first floor.\u201d\u201cDid it become B-grade?\u201d\u201cYes. 78.4% of B-grade. Previously, it was 21.54% of A-grade.\u201d\u201cIts grade went down, but it has changed so aggressively that it even came to the door\u2026\u201dPark Geon-ho looked uncomfortable. The grade had been lowered. This was a problem I expected from the first floor. Second, attacking as if it was waiting as soon as we appeared was a very heterogeneous behaviour.\u2018Yeah. Like\u2026 as if it was intelligent enough to know when we\u2019re coming.\u2019However, I don\u2019t know if it was an S+ grade monster, or did a monster that had fallen to B grade had that much intelligence?Whether he had similar thoughts to me, Park Geon-ho gathered the guild members.\u201cDid you notice anything strange?\u201d\u201cI found nothing.\u201d\u201cThings are a bit ambiguous.\u201d\u201cIf it was alive, we would have been able to see if it was under some kind of spell, but we killed it\u2026\u201dA number of cases had been investigated, but no specific conclusion had been reached. There was no other way, so in the end, we moved on with the discomfort covered.\u201cThe atmosphere is strange.\u201d\u201cBe careful. Kim Woo-jin, you too.\u201dI looked around, paying attention to Min Ah-rin, who was making a worried expression, and Kim Woo-jin, who was next to her.I felt an unfamiliar, unpleasant sensation sticking to me.The second monster that appeared was a large caterpillar monster, a B-grade Great Larva (\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ud2b8 \ub77c\ubc14). Compared to its slow body, it was one of the most difficult monsters to deal with close abilities, spraying poison everywhere with poison holes on its back.\u201cWhat?\u201dHowever, the Great Lava didn\u2019t budge in a still state, rather than spewing poison. O wondered if it was dead, but its torso shook slightly to see if it was breathing.Great Larva, who was bigger and chubbier than most adult males, shrank with its back rolled up as a guild member approached.\u201cJust in case, the close team step down. It could be poison.\u201dThe long-distance team stepped forward and said. I also got stuck in the middle and used my ability to attack a Great Larva.The Great Larva, whose centre of the body was cut off, died without even screaming. So did the other Great Larva. The measuring ability confirmed the grade level on the corpse.\u201cGrade C 69.2%.\u201d\u201cThis is so\u2026\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was thinking about something with his arms crossed and his brows frowned, ordered the guild members to burn all the bodies of Great Lava. Since it didn\u2019t react normally, he was worried that the body would come back to life or be manipulated by some power.The corpse of the Great Lava, which had been lowered to a C-grade, burned even with a normal fire. After clearing up, the team continued to move forward.* * *The team, which cleared up the monsters faster than originally planned, unpacked their luggage to rest before the stairs to the third floor.Even after the Great Larva, monsters with lower grade continued to appear. It was a trivial situation for those who were worried that an S+ grade monster would appear as an anomaly.Park Geon-ho and the team members of Special Operations Division, who came in expecting a hot clash with a strong monster, responded that they were leaking, but other than that, the non-combat team and Woo Seo-hyuk were in a more fortunate atmosphere.As for me, it was good to see the grade dropped. I was able to relieve some of my worries about Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin.\u2018More than that, the problem isn\u2019t the grade\u2026\u2019It must be an abnormal movement of the monster. Not only me, but also Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk felt the seriousness, and unlike the first floor, I continued to look around sensitively.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dMin Ah-rin handed over what she was holding in her hand. What was in the paper cup was steaming hot barley tea.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you tired?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dWhen the situation went like this, the desire to sleep disappeared. With an A-rank body, it was really useful at times like this. Even if I didn\u2019t sleep for two days, I could endure it somehow.On the other hand, Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, who were non-combat talented people, had rough skin. We had been moving all day, and the bed wasn\u2019t comfortable, so the fatigue wasn\u2019t going away.\u201cYou look very tired, Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that, but\u2026 the second floor is finished. You just have to work hard until tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s cheer up a little bit more. Kim Woo-jin, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKim Woo-jin quietly nodded at my question. After yesterday\u2019s conversation, Kim Woo-jin behaved as usual, but the subtle sense of distance was still there.I felt bitter and pretended not to know it. If I couldn\u2019t take responsibility and explain it properly, I had to accept this.Min Ah-rin seemed to have noticed this situation to some extent, but she decided that it was not a matter for others to interfere, so she said nothing and said goodnight with a smile.\u201cSee you tomorrow, Yi-gyeol-ssi. Woo-jin-ssi.\u201d\u201cGood night.\u201dAs time passed, everyone fell asleep with the exception of a few who stood by the watchman. Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk constantly walked around the team to prepare for the invasion of monsters.I stayed by the side of Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin without falling asleep.T/N :Seo-hyuk, you\u2026 (\ub208\u2038\ub208)It\u2019s like you gave him a false hope wwwwwShould I say that this date actually more focused on bonding of Yi-gyeol and Woo-jin instead of the threesome?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although anomalies were discovered, the team, who arrived safely on the third floor without any major disruptions on the set schedule, made a thrilling expression in front of A-grade monster.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been so happy to see an A-grade monster.\u201d\u201cIs this an S-grade gate, really\u2026\u201dThe A-grade monster ghost floated in the air wearing black cloth. More than 20 monsters rushed in with their bright blue eyes flashing, but the team members just smiled and swung their weapons happily.Guooo, guoook!Kuooo!Watching the monsters falling to the floor while screaming, each one made me feel pitiful. The ghosts of the historical site, which had maintained their original grades for a short time with an A-grade of 11.3%, were annihilated without being able to hold out for even 10 minutes.Park Geon-ho, who was watching the battle slowly, opened his mouth.\u201cAt this rate, we will leave the gate before lunchtime today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if we left sooner.\u201d\u201cHaa. When I go out, I have to do an interview and I have to go to the management headquarters. Gates are not as fun as usual, and there are only a lot of things to do. What a loss.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t complain and work hard, Team Leader.\u201dIt bothered him about everything. While criticizing Park Geon-ho, I found Woo Seo-hyuk staring at something in the corner.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi. What are you doing?\u201dAs I approached him, Woo Seo-hyuk turned to me and pointed to what he was looking at.\u201cThis is\u2026 a skull?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pattern I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dIt looked like a skull with its mouth open, enveloped in black smoke. The pattern was not seen on the first and second floors, so it was necessary to look carefully.\u201cTeam Leader.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, I called Park Geon-ho. While having a conversation with the guild members, he approached with a puzzled expression.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThis pattern. Have you seen it before?\u201dSeeing the skull pattern, Park Geon-ho frowned and tilted his head.\u201cHmm. No. This is my first time seeing it.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even on the first and second floor, right? I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, it wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\u201cThere is no other place on this gate where the pattern is engraved except for the device that opens the door.\u201d\u201cThen this is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt sure is strange.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was patting his lips, then shrugged his shoulders lightly.\u201cThere is no major damage right now, so let\u2019s leave it alone for now. There is no way to find out at this moment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dWhether Woo Seo-hyuk agreed or not, there was nothing else to say.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201dIn the end, I turned my back on the pattern without any result, and Park Geon-ho spoke to me skillfully, putting his arms around my shoulder.\u201cClear will be over early, so I would like to have a meal we have been putting off for a long time today.\u201d\u201cI am tired. And you said you had to do an interview, and you had to go to the management office?\u201d\u201cIf you go out for an interview, reporters will be waiting for you, so you can do it right away, and the management headquarters\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019m late, so it\u2019ll wait.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Do it properly.\u201dWhile replying to Park Geon-ho\u2019s nonsense roughly, I felt a subtle feeling. What.As I tilted my head, later I realized what was different from usual. Kim Woo-jin, who was chasing Park Geon-ho\u2019s accusation, was nowhere to be seen.Looking around, Kim Woo-jin was standing among the healer team. Kim Woo-jin, who was glaring at Park Geon-ho with his cold eyes, turned his head in a hurry when our eyes met.\u2018That guy\u2026\u2019What are you doing? Are you going to keep your distance from me?I thought there was nothing I could do, but when I saw it with my own two eyes, I got a little annoyed.\u201cThen even tomorrow\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026no. Why are you so obsessed with eating? I thought you weren\u2019t even going to scout me.\u201dAt my words, Park Geon-ho slightly raised the corner of his lips and answered.\u201cI still have the desire. Isn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d\u201cI thought you gave up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I refused to show it because I was so resolute. Do you feel sorry? Then I can tempt you hard.\u201d\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Why don\u2019t we have a conversation while having a meal?\u201d\u201cLater, later.\u201dWell, it\u2019s not the time to worry about the past, so I\u2019m not interested to it at all. I grew tired, and shook off Park Geon-ho\u2019s heavy arm that was wrapped around my shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t rush. You have to pay me anyway.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it.\u201dPark Geon-ho\u2019s attitude that he had completely forgotten was ridiculous. If it wasn\u2019t for what happened at the representative office, why would I be here\u2026Kugugugung!\u201cTeam Leader!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dThat was then. The ground rumbled loudly, and the screams of the guild members resounded. I barely managed to balance my staggering body and looked straight ahead.\u201cBe careful!\u201d\u201cDodge! Damn it!\u201dThe floor was collapsing at high speed. This crazy! As I watched the guild members falling, I quickly raised my ability.\u201cAh, Han Yi-gyeol! Catch!\u201dThe floor on which I and Park Geon-ho were standing collapsed in an instant. I found Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin while sticking to Park Geon-ho, who was pulling my body.\u201cKim Woo-jin! Min Ah-rin-ssi!\u201dFortunately, Woo Seo-hyuk held the two of them so they didn\u2019t collide with the debris. I took the opportunity to take advantage of it and raised my ability to the max.Huung, the bodies of the team members who had fallen down rose into the air. Fortunately, unlike the D17 Area gate, the ability was activated normally. The team members, who were bewildered by the sudden situation, barely regained their rationality.\u201cIs there no one left behind?\u201d\u201cFinished checking the number of people! Everyone is fine.\u201d\u201cDamn, I dropped my weapon.\u201dThere was only darkness under my feet without a place to step. I said with anguish, feeling the energy escaping at great speed.\u201cI can\u2019t, stand it for a long time.\u201dJiiing, the bracelet trembled and filled with energy, but it was clear that it would not last more than five minutes. Park Geon-ho, who found me in a cold sweat, said aloud to the team members around him.\u201cHold each other so we don\u2019t separate. Go down. Han Yi-gyeol, drop the kids just enough they don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201dI slowly lowered the bodies of the team members while controlling the wind. As we entered the darkness, one of the guild members took out a flashlight and lit it below.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dTap.\u00a0When my feet touched the ground, a sigh of relief came out.\u201cYou worked hard.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who supported me when I was falling down, asked Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cIs that okay over there?\u201d\u201cFor now, yes, but from now on, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dMin Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin ran to me. Min Ah-rin looked at my complexion with careful eyes.\u201cAre you okay? Your energy\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little better now.\u201dI looked down at the bracelet. The red jewel was shining brightly. It was definitely an A-grade item, so the effect wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cI\u2019ll fill it for you in just in case.\u201d\u201cThat would be great. I don\u2019t know what will happen from now on.\u201dI received energy from Min Ah-rin and calmly looked at the situation. We fell down, so at least the second floor. Or it could be further down.Woo Seo-hyuk, who was handed a flashlight from the guild member, lit alternately on both sides.\u201cThe terrain itself is like a historic site.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 it could be a hidden place on the first floor we were going to go to.\u201d\u201cWe fell from the third floor, so it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\u201cTeam Leader.\u201dOne of the guild members hastily approached. It was Shim Soo-yeon, a guild member with ponytail hair, who handled the spear, grabbed the hand of the person with the ability to measure.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cLook at this guy. He suddenly said he was not feeling well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201dAt that moment, Min Ah-rin, who filled me with energy, took action. The person with the ability to measure, who frowned as if in pain, opened his mouth with difficulty.\u201cWeird. I don\u2019t even use my ability, but I feel as sick as when she lacks energy.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who grabbed his hand, tilted her head with a firm expression.\u201cThe condition is not bad. It seems to be something other than energy.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dShim Soo-yeon grabbed the shoulder of the staggering measuring ability.\u201cI think I\u2019m getting motion sickness\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is bad.\u201dShim Soo-yeon put the person with a measuring ability, who was unconscious, on her back.\u201cWhat should we do, Team Leader?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not a matter of energy, this space itself would be a problem. We need to get out of this place before there are more victims.\u201dAs I watched the situation quietly, I heard a faint sound behind my back.\u2018What?\u2019I looked back, but nothing happened.The moment I thought I heard it wrong, I could see something wriggling through the darkness.Sasak. Sasasak.The sound of moving sounded secretly. A chill and goosebumps ran down my spine.\u201cKim Woo-jin!\u201dI quickly grabbed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s arm in front of him.Kiaaaak! Kyaaaah!The moment Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body came into my arms, the spider monster that flew in aiming at the back of his head made an unpleasant cry. Then, the other spider monsters that were coming from behind also cried out all at once.Kiaaak! Kiaak!\u201cPlease stand back!\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk tore his shirt and deformed his arms. As he said, while holding Kim Woo-jin, I quickly pulled my body back using my ability. Measuring ability and Shim Soo-yeon also quickly retreated.\u201cProtect the long-distance team and the healer team. Close teams are in line.\u201dAt the same time as Park Geon-ho gave an order, he threw an iron ball.\u00a0Kuuung, the ground shook and sparks flew.Kkiaaak!Pleasant smoke spread through the purple blood. The close team covered their noses and mouths and shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s poison!\u201d\u201cTsk. Change the ranks! Long-distance team!\u201d\u201cStay here.\u201dI left Kim Woo-jin, who had an anxious expression, between the healer team, and stepped forward. I swung my hand away, driving the poisonous smoke that was flowing towards us in the opposite direction.Thud! Thud! Thud!\u201c\u2026what is this sound?\u201dA heavy drum sound could be heard from behind the crowd of spiders.\u00a0Thud. Thud.\u00a0The guild members retreated with anxious expressions at the sound of getting closer.Kiiik, kii!Syaaaak!When the drums sounded, the spiders stopped all at once and did not approach. As if waiting for something, an ominous feeling came over.\u201cThe situation is not good.\u201dThe drums sounded getting closer and closer. The monsters were waiting for something. I swallowed dry saliva and looked back at Park Geon-ho.\u201cTeam Leader, this is probably\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t deal with it now.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d better leave as soon as possible.\u201dAll the guild members who were watching the situation with tense expressions agreed.\u201cJust in case, I\u2019ll open the shield. In the meantime, run away!\u201dThe shield ability man came forward and shouted. That was the moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dBlack tentacles popped out of the darkness and wrapped around my arms. Thick and squishy like an octopus leg, sticking to my arms like a straw and began to pull strongly.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dChijijijik!When I gave strength to my legs and held out, my feet were dragged in the direction of the monster.T/N :\u2026okay,\u00a0the kidnapped scene\u00a0*noAnd the tentacles\u2026 Go away, you my pervert mind! *slappedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, five or six tentacles appeared anew in the darkness this time.\u201cDamn!\u201dThe tentacles, which failed to drag me, snatched the body of the shield ability person. Woo Seo-hyuk hurriedly leaned forward and called me.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dI knew what he wanted without saying anything. When the wind wrapped around Woo Seo-hyuk and increased the movement speed, Woo Seo-hyuk grabbed the shield ability man who was being dragged and tore off the tentacles.\u201cCome to the back, all three of you!\u201dAt Park Geon-ho\u2019s cry, Woo Seo-hyuk, who rescued the shield ability man, was pulled with his ability. At the same time, Park Geon-ho threw three iron balls at the monster.Kuuung!The explosion flashed, revealing the monster that was hiding in the darkness. Several monsters with tentacles that were fluttering like sea anemones were engulfed in flames. After that, a group of drum-beating kobolds opened their mouth wide and let out an incomprehensible cry.Kagak, Kagakak! Kyaak!The spider monsters, which had stopped and did not move, flocked again at the sound. Park Geon-ho and the long-distance team continued to check the monsters, and we backed off.\u201cCrazy, where did that monster suddenly come from?\u201d\u201cDoes it look like it has a high grade?\u201dThe guild members ran away and grumbled. As we continued to move forward to avoid the monsters that were chasing us, we noticed a large room at the end of the hallway.Kiaaak! Kyaak!Monsters were coming from behind at high speed. Still, for some reason, I felt reluctant to enter the room.\u2018Is it just me?\u2019Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk looked back and seemed to feel nothing. There was no time to worry about the situation we were being chased, so I finally followed the team members into the room.\u201cIs there anything to stop it?\u201d\u201cGet the exit first!\u201d\u201cTeam Leader!\u201dOne of the close team members, who first entered the room and looked inside, pointed to the innermost part of the room and said.\u201cThere is a door that looks like an exit, but it doesn\u2019t open. I think we will be able to get out of this place only if we find a hidden device.\u201d\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll block the monsters, so let the non-combat personnel get out as far back as possible to find the device.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dI looked around, feeling nervous among the guild members moving in perfect order.Something felt strange. The empty room we were alone in felt more dangerous than the hallway full of monsters. Kim Woo-jin approached me, who was standing still.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dI hesitated and shook my head. Even if you are anxious in this situation, there is nothing you can do. Opening the exit door and escaping as quickly as possible\u2026Looking at the ceiling involuntarily, I felt my heart froze for a moment then quickly beating.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201dTwo huge eyes looking down at us.\u00a0Suuup, I heard the sound of breathing in. I shouted like a scream.\u201cEveryone, run away\u2014\u201dKkiiiiik!Before I could even finish my words, a terrifying and bizarre sound pierced my ears and filled the room.\u201cAaargh!\u201d\u201cKeuaaargh!\u201dThe guild members, who were preparing for the upcoming monster. grabbed their heads and screamed. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body, which was standing next to me, collapsed to the floor.\u201cNo!\u201dRed blood flowed from both ears of Kim Woo-jin, who was quickly caught.\u201cWake up, Kim Woo-jin!\u201dA chilling fear ran down my spine. As I instinctively looked up, something flew open beneath the gigantic eyes that looked at me, creating a black light like a crescent moon. It was the mouth of a monster that smiled while watching us in pain.I took the fainted Kim Woo-jin into my arms and my face distorted. What should I do? What should I\u2026\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dWith a soft voice, someone firmly grabbed my shoulder. It was Min Ah-rin.\u201cCalm down.\u201dWith her rarely stiff face, she quickly glanced at Kim Woo-jin.\u201cHe hurts, but this is enough to heal. He just passed out because he was overpowered by the monster energy.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cBut things are not going well. You know that, right?\u201d\u201cMonsters have arrived!\u201dThud! Thud!The guild member who was waiting in the hallway shouted. The sound of drums rang through the room.\u201cThe healer team will take care of the injured. So, don\u2019t worry, just deal with the monsters.\u201d\u201c\u2026all right.\u201dMy heart was beating fast because of anxiety, but Min Ah-rin\u2019s words helped me come to my senses. I handed over Kim Woo-jin to Min Ah-rin and told Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cTeam Leader. Can you give me just one close team?\u201d\u201cThe reason is?\u201dPark Geon-ho, who was staring at the giant monster with a serious expression, gave a puzzled look.\u201cMonster hanging on the ceiling and monsters coming into the hallway. We can handle both. If my ability supports.\u201d\u201cYou need someone to protect you.\u201d\u201cYes. Team Leader please takes charge of the hallway and Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0will take charge here. I will assist you in your ability.\u201dI had to watch two people at the same time, and in the case of Park Geon-ho, I needed more delicate control because he handled iron balls. I needed someone to watch over me constantly and protect me who used my ability.Park Geon-ho, who understood my explanation, beckoned to the person who was guarding the non-combat team. It was Shim Soo-yeon, a person with the ability to handle lightning-flowing spears.\u201cWe\u2019d better do as you say. Shim Soo-yeon is taking good care of you. Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk nodded his head and raised his ability. Not only his arms, but his whole body began to swell and turn black. His clothes were torn, unable to withstand the changes in his body, and his fine hair rose in the meantime.Kuung!After finishing his transformation, Woo Seo-hyuk slammed his huge front paws on the floor and waved his tail. Golden eyes flashed.\u201cPlease take care of me, Shim Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201dAs the wind wrapped Woo Seo-hyuk and Park Geon-ho\u2019s bodies around and talked, Shim Soo-yeon smiled and swung the spear once.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will protect you.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start when you\u2019re ready.\u201dEveryone stood by Park Geon-ho, except for a few who were guarding the non-combat team. Park Geon-ho threw several iron balls into the air. I floated all the iron balls in the air and waited for the monsters to enter the room.In the meantime, Woo Seo-hyuk, who had no restrictions on his movements, flew his body towards the monster attached to the ceiling. Woo Seo-hyuk, who grabbed the nape of its neck at once, dragged the monster to the floor.Hihik, hihihik!The monster was a humanoid with melted skin. Abnormally large eyes, a torn mouth, and only the upper body floating in the air as if the lower body had been cut off. With a giggled laughter, the monster swung its bizarrely long arms. Woo Seo-hyuk lightly avoided the attack.Obviously, when my ability was added, it seemed much more comfortable against monsters in the air. I was relieved and turned my gaze to Park Geon-ho. From spider monsters chasing us to tentacles and kobolds with drums. Park Geon-ho beckoned to the rushing monsters.I knew his fighting style from experience. It was advantageous to leave the monsters at the forefront to the close team and killed the tentacles with the long attack distance. Fifteen iron balls that were floating in the air were thrown at the tentacle monster all at once.Park Geon-ho, who was concentrating on the iron ball just like me, activated his ability at the right time.\u00a0Kwaaang!\u00a0The ground shook and black tentacles exploded into bombs. At the same time, the close team started fighting against the spider monsters.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dThe energy flew out like water to where Woo Seo-hyuk, who was engaged in a fierce battle with monster in the air, and Park Geon-ho, who controlled all the iron balls.\u00a0Uung, the bracelet trembled and the jewel shone.A huge monster that was injured here and there by Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s attack opened its mouth. The jaws descended endlessly and the elongated mouth was filled with thorn-like black teeth.Haaaak!\u201cAargh, what!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dAs the giant monster made an inexplicable cry, my eyes distorted and my body staggered. S-ranks Woo Seo-hyuk and Park Geon-ho also shook their heads and stumbled while rubbing their foreheads.Each of the guild members screamed and hurriedly backed away. Shim Soo-yeon, who was killing the spider monster that rushed at me, also stumbled.\u201cGasp!\u201dThe person with the ability to measure, who was drooping and exhaling hard, opened his eyes and raised his upper body.\u201cTe, Team Leader! Grade energy\u2026!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cThe state of the monster!\u201dKiiiiik! Kiiik!The monsters, which were fighting the close team, suddenly overturned their stomachs and struggled painfully. Park Geon-ho, who frowned, asked the person with the ability to measure.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\u201cUgh, the monster in the centre is absorbing the energy of other monsters\u2026!\u201dThe person with the ability to measure answered with difficulty, nauseating as if he was dizzy. The spider monster, which had not been attacked by B-rank guild members until recently, died helplessly. It was proof that the grade that used to be grade A had fallen below grade B.Only then did we realize the cause of the anomaly from the first floor. The giant monster that absorbed the energy of other monsters grew bigger and the wounds disappeared.\u201cA monster that absorbs the energy of other monsters\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was a crime from the first floor to the third floor. Is there no limit to the scope?\u201d\u201cMy stomach hurts\u2026\u201dSince the monster absorbed the energy, all the talented people in the room felt dizzy. Among them, the most sensitive person was the measuring ability that could not hold it any longer and passed out.\u201cHaa, Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi. Can you stand it?\u201dWhen I asked with difficulty grabbing my chest as I felt headache and nausea, Woo Seo-hyuk also opened his mouth and let out a rough breath and nodded his head.Even if the level of the monster was lowered, it took a long time to process it because the number was so large. Until then, Woo Seo-hyuk had to deal with the bigger monster alone.\u2018We need to handle the situation on Park Geon-ho\u2019s side as soon as possible.\u2019Woo Seo-hyuk, who caught his breath while waving his tail wildly, jumped up and rushed at the monster again.\u00a0Hihihihik!\u00a0As the ability was absorbed, its grade level went up, and the energy felt from the monster became stronger.I endured the nausea inside and let the wind flow to Park Geon-ho again. Park Geon-ho, who lifted his iron balls back into the air to match, also increased his speed to deal with the monsters.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dWhen the number of monsters gathered fell below half, Park Geon-ho, who had entrusted the finishing touches to the guild members, rushed over. Shim Soo-yeon, who had been protecting me like a baton, moved to the battlefield at the command of Park Geon-ho.\u201cPlease support me.\u201dPark Geon-ho, who came closer to my place, grabbed my waist and arms and lifted us up. I looked at the giant monster facing Woo Seo-hyuk while floating my body and Park Geon-ho in the air at the same time.There was not much energy left. I had to come to a conclusion slowly.T/N :Full beast!Seo-hyuk finally appeared!!(\u3064\u2727\u03c9\u2727)\u3064Also that scene when Yi-gyeol looked up to the ceiling\u2026 so eerie\u2026 (;\u014f\ufe4f\u014f)Fighting you all! Hold on, Woo-jin!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cCan you stand it?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201dDrops of cold sweat ran down my temple.\u00a0Huuung, the five iron balls placed on Park Geon-ho\u2019s palms flew all at once. I and Park Geon-ho\u2019s body floated, Woo Seo-hyuk avoided monster attacks and even the movement of iron balls. I started to get a headache from the sudden decrease in energy every moment.Haaak!Kuuung!He threw an iron ball at the monster that was about to open its mouth again. The monster, which was briefly shaken by the shock of the explosion, came out with a bizarrely distorted face and looked at Park Geon-ho. No, he was staring at me. Apparently, he noticed that I was assisting Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe monster swung its arms with great speed. Park Geon-ho, noticing the movement, quickly pushed his body back.\u00a0Kwagagak!\u00a0The monster\u2019s sharp claws barely passed us and scratched the wall.Woo Seo-hyuk did not miss the gap and dug in. With his mouth wide open, the wolf mercilessly bit the monster\u2019s neck.\u00a0Kururung, the cry of the beast and the scream of the monster exploded at the same time. The monster wielded its body and arms at random to tear off Woo Seo-hyuk, but Woo Seo-hyuk nailed his claws into the monster\u2019s body and held out.Meanwhile, Park Geon-ho and I flew an iron ball, being careful not to get Woo Seo-hyuk caught up in the explosion.Kiiiik!Argh!\u00a0At the scream of the monster, some B-rank guild members and the healer team covered their heads and screamed.Park Geon-ho didn\u2019t care and continued to use his ability.\u00a0Kuuung, kung!\u00a0As the explosions occurred several times, the interior shook randomly, as if an earthquake had occurred.\u201cGasp, gasp\u2026\u201dI was breathing heavily. Park Geon-ho fixed my droopy body and hugged me.\u201cHold on a little longer.\u201dAs if I had hit the limit, my energy pierced the heart sharply. I gave strength to my eyes that were constantly blurring and endured it.The monster, who barely removed Woo Seo-hyuk, had its upper body wet with the black blood that flowed from its neck. The fatally wounded monster opened its mouth and tried to absorb the energy, but there was nothing left to absorb as the guild members succeeded in clearing all the monsters.The monster that was hit several times by injured its neck and the iron ball was significantly reduced in size. Realizing that its life was in danger, the monster began to target me more tenaciously than ever.Hihihik! Hihik!The monster, which ripped its mouth open and laughed strangely, opened its mouth wide and began to spit out thick bodily fluids. As soon as the black body fluid hit the wall, it emitted smoke and melted the wall.It would be possible to kill with one proper attack, but it was not easy to narrow the distance to the monster that constantly spew body fluids. In the end, I suggested another way.\u201cTeam Leader. I will be the bait.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere is no end to this. Everyone is exhausted and if we continue to be dragged like this, the damage will increase.\u201dPark Geon-ho frowned at my words but did not respond. I called Woo Seo-hyuk, who was unable to approach due to body fluids and was hovering around the monster.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi. Can you carry Team Leader on your back?\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk blinked his eyes and wept. Rejection was felt all over his body. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help it even if you don\u2019t like it.\u201cTeam Leader and Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0please move as a team. I will stand apart and draw the attention of the monster.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who was waving his tail, bowed his back slightly with a dissatisfied face. Park Geon-ho, who got on top of Woo Seo-hyuk, grabbed his iron ball and gave me a wink to start.Away from them, I flew high. As expected, the monster turned towards me and swung its arms. If you let your guard down even a little, you will be caught by the monster\u2019s huge hands.Kiiiik! Kiiik!I increased the speed to confuse the monster as much as possible. I calmly avoided the monster\u2019s arms that cut through the air in both directions and the pouring body fluids. However, it was impossible to completely avoid all the attacks and the wounds gradually increased.While the monster looked at me, Woo Seo-hyuk, who had Park Geon-ho on his back, moved behind its back, out of sight of the monster. Woo Seo-hyuk, who jumped high and used the wall as a foothold, gave strength to his legs and rushed towards the monster as if being shot.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dThe monster\u2019s claws cut my shoulder. At the same time, Woo Seo-hyuk, who had landed on the monster\u2019s head, nailed his claw to the monster\u2019s forehead.Kkiiiiik\u2014!Its mouth widened with a painful scream. As if Park Geon-ho was waiting, he poured his iron balls into its long, open mouth.\u201cGasp, gasp.\u201dI turned off my ability with uneasy shaky energy and sat down on the floor as if I was collapsing. Hot blood gushed out of my shoulder. Finally.Kwaaang!A bright white light burst, causing an explosion stronger than ever.\u00a0Kkiiii!\u00a0Explosions that exploded in succession without a break burned the monster\u2019s mouth and the body itself. The disgusting smell of burning flesh spread.Woo Seo-hyuk and Park Geon-ho, who stood back just before the explosion, also fell to the floor. When the explosion that did not stop for about a minute ended, a monster with a charred entire body fell down.Kuung!Black blood spread under the monster\u2019s corpse. I then breathed a sigh of relief.It\u2019s finally over.\u201cWaaa!\u201d\u201cWe won!\u201dThe guild members, who became beggars from each fierce battle, cheered with excited voices and celebrated their victory. I leaned my back against the wall and watched it. The energy that was fluctuating slowly regained stability with the power of the bracelet.\u201cWow, I thought I was in real, big trouble.\u201d\u201cTeam Leader and Secretary are great, but Mercenary Han Yi-gyeol is no joke. Surely there is a reason why people are calling him here and there.\u201d\u201cGreat job, everyone!\u201dPark Geon-ho, who came down from Woo Seo-hyuk, gave a high-five with the guild members. Woo Seo-hyuk, who had transformed himself, took out new clothes from his inventory and put them on.\u201cDon\u2019t relax, take a good look around you. How is the status of the measuring ability?\u201d\u201cFortunately, he has come to his senses.\u201d\u201cTell him to start measuring as soon as he feels better.\u201d\u201cTeam Leader, we have finished checking the exit. It opened normally, and there\u2019s no sign of monsters or traps.\u201d\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll take a breather and start moving right away. Until then, check your weapons and treat the injured.\u201dAt those words, I looked down at my right shoulder, still bleeding. I had to be treated, but my energy did not recover, so it was difficult to move my body.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dAfter resting for a while, I was going to visit the healer team, but Min Ah-rin found me and ran to me. Behind her was Kim Woo-jin.\u201cOh my God, look at the blood!\u201d\u201cAre, are you hurt?\u201dI looked closely at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face as he approached me. Fortunately, his complexion was fine and there was no blood that had flowed down the ear.\u201cKim Woo-jin. Are you okay?\u201dStill, I asked in case. Even if you look fine, you may have a hearing problem.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Woo-jin blushed at my question and put on an upset expression.\u201cI am, of course, fine. It\u2019s you who got hurt. Your shoulder\u2026\u201d\u201cWoo-jin-ssi\u00a0is right. Who is Yi-gyeol in a position to worry about others now? Take off your clothes. I will treat you.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dSmiling awkwardly, I unbuttoned my shirt. The pale beige shirt I was wearing was half wet with blood from my shoulder.The wound was worse than I thought. Min Ah-rin, who saw the shoulder with rough skin was torn, said with a frown.\u201cYou\u2019ve become a complete rag.\u201dWhat do you mean by a rag\u2026 That\u2019s mean.Kim Woo-jin sat down on one knee in front of me. The expression of the guy with his head slightly bowed was not very good.\u201cIf I were strong\u2026 If I had the strength to fight like everyone else, instead of using this useless ability, would I have been able to protect you from getting hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t answer hastily to those words that were being heard contemptuously and kept my mouth shut.Kim Woo-jin\u2019s words were not unfamiliar. At one time, I also thought like that every moment. When the dawn left alone was insanely lonely, I longed for it, swallowing the resentment that soared to my throat.So I couldn\u2019t tell Kim Woo-jin not to think foolishly. After a brief silence, I opened my mouth.\u201cKim Woojin. You are enough for now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLike Min Ah-rin-ssi, who heals me when I get hurt, you are helping me a lot. That\u2019s it.\u201dAbove all, thanks to Kim Woo-jin, the information he got, which was trouble, easily get it. These were not empty words to console him.\u201cI agree. Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0gets hurt when he turns his eyes, but he says he can\u2019t take care of it by himself. He needs Woo-jin-ssi.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was watching me and Kim Woo-jin, helped me out. Feeling embarrassed, I looked at my shoulder and wiped my sweaty bangs. Before I knew it, the wound had stopped bleeding with Min Ah-rin\u2019s ability and was slowly healing.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dPark Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk, who came after looking around the guild members, walked up to me. For some reason, both of them seemed to have finished a tough battle, but their expressions were bright and they looked refreshed.\u201cIt was hard. Thanks to you, I was able to kill it quickly without taking too much damage.\u201dAt Park Geon-ho\u2019s words, Woo Seo-hyuk nodded his head from behind.\u201cIt\u2019s also unfortunate. Do you have any thoughts to join our team?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going, I\u2019m not going. Do you think I\u2019d want to go through all this trouble?\u201d\u201cIt was hard work, but it\u2019s that much fun.\u201dI looked up at Park Geon-ho with a cold expression on his face. Fun, my ass. Really, you have a weird personality.\u201cAren\u2019t all the team members okay? It will definitely be nice if we work together.\u201d\u201cI will decline.\u201dDespite the firm answer or whether the\u00a0scout disease\u00a0had risen again, Park Geon-ho did not give up and began to recite the benefits that I would receive if I joined the team. Kim Woo-jin, who was sitting in front of me with his gloomy face, gradually grew colder, and Min Ah-rin covered her mouth and laughed as if it was funny.\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019It\u2019s my life. While sighing, I looked over Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder at the gaze I felt somewhere.The monster\u2019s red pupils, which I thought were dead, were facing me. My heartbeat was hard as my head cooled down.The monster, which made eye contact with me, ripped its mouth wet with black blood and laughed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe sound that filled the surroundings became faint, and the sensations of my whole body became more sensitive. An unpleasant intuition ran up my cold fingertips.The monster slowly opened its mouth as if teasing me. Something stretched out through the gaps full of teeth.\u201cN\u2026\u201dNo. My body moved before I thought. I grabbed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder, who was sitting in front of me, and pushed him roughly to the side.Puuk!I felt the burning pain with the sound of flesh being pierced. The black tentacle protruding from the monster\u2019s mouth pierced my side. My body, which had been leaning forward to catch Kim Woo-jin, fell to the floor and spat out something desperately.\u201cCough!\u201dThe blood was so black that I couldn\u2019t believe it came out of my mouth. Black smoke leaked from the side that was reflexively wrapped around with red blood. It was poison.\u201cYi, Yi-gyeol-ssi!\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dHihik\u2026 Hihihi\u2026Through the screams that filled my ears, the laughter of the monster was heard. Shim Soo-yeon grabbed the spear and cut off the monster\u2019s head at once. The last time I saw the monster\u2019s head rolling down the floor, my eyes went off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I let out a rough breath and crawled forward with difficulty.Kkiiiik\u2014Kkyaaak!Save\u2026 run away\u2026 (\uc0b4\ub824\u2026 \ub3c4\ub9dd\u2026\u2026)A scream could be heard in the midst of the monstrous cries. Where the gas exploded, a hot flame rose with a headache smell. The address board \u20183-17\u2019, which was barely hanging from the wall, creaked.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dSoggy blood was dripping from the side that I had stuttered. My whole body trembled with the never-ending fear.\u201cYeo, Yeon-ah\u2026 ugh, Yeon-ah\u2026\u201d (\uc5f0\uc544, probably Yi-gyeol\u2019s sister name or Sa-yeon\u2019s nickname?)The wound was painful, but my sister was more urgent than that. I was so afraid that my sister, who had fallen with blood on her head, would die any moment.\u201cSave, save us please\u2026 Save us please\u2026\u201dI cried and prayed to the man in front of me. The man who had stood firm in the blazing red fire looked down at me. His white face was stained with blood as bright as fire.\u201cSis, sister. Even my sister\u2026 please\u2026\u201dThe man raised one of his eyebrows at the words I spat out in a hurry.Tap. Taking a step closer to me, the man raised the sword he was holding in his hand. The blood-stained blade flashed.\u201cUu\u2026\u201dMy heart was beating so fast that I couldn\u2019t control it. The man looked at me with cold eyes and swung his sword. I closed my eyes reflexively.* * *\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201dI took a deep breath and lifted my upper body.The sun-drenched ceiling came into view with a faint smell of disinfectant.\u2018\u2026is it a dream?\u2019I stroked my side. Unlike in my dream, I felt my skin healed after receiving treatment.Slowly, I recalled the scene I had seen in my dream. A shanty town on fire. Narrow alleys and steeply sloping floors.In the middle of it, Han Yi-gyeol was injured, and his younger sister had collapsed. Even Cheon Sa-yeon with the sword standing in front of them.It was the past of Han Yi-gyeol that I had not seen in a long time, but it was so fragmentary that I had no idea what the situation was. There\u2019s nothing I can do. I sighed and looked around.It wasn\u2019t the first place I visited. A hospital room inside the Requiem Guild. I relaxed the familiar inside.I was immediately fainted by the monster\u2019s unexpected attack, so I couldn\u2019t figure out what happened after that. I thought I should ask if Min Ah-rin or Kim Woo-jin came later, but the door to the hospital room swung open.\u201cAnswers have arrived from masters in each region. Most responded that they would attend\u2026\u201d\u201cUm?\u201dThose who entered the hospital room were Cheon Sa-yeon and Woo Seo-hyuk. Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been listening to Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s briefing with a bored expression on his face, found me awake and raised the corners of his lips.\u201cThe Sleeping Beauty has woken up.\u201d\u201c\u2026why did you pick a fight as soon as I see your face?\u201dAs I distorted my forehead at the disgusting sound, Woo Seo-hyuk, who was standing behind him, asked.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThe side, which had been severely wounded, was in a state of being healed cleanly without a single scar. Anyway, it was nice to have a talented person. Without Healer, the injury was so severe that I had to lie down for a month.\u201cOrganize the documents and put them in the representative office. I\u2019ll see you later and we\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who had sent Woo Seo-hyuk out of the hospital room, sat down on a chair near the bed. I paused for a moment at the natural behaviour.Looking at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face up close, I had no choice but to remember a dream. What did the hell happen? As I was thinking about Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s plea to the sword-wielding Cheon Sa-yeon to spare his sister, I woke up to the sound of a voice.\u201cEveryone on the clear team, including Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk, was very worried. Not to mention Healer Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dShould I go back later and show my normal face to them? Just before I passed out, I remembered the people running to me in shock.I\u2019m a little sorry. I asked just in case.\u201cHow long has it been since I passed out?\u201d\u201cToday is the second day.\u201dFortunately, that\u2019s a relief. With a sigh of relief, Cheon Sa-yeon looked at me with a strange smile. What else are you going to say?\u201cSo what is it? The reason you came.\u201d\u201cThis. It\u2019s an ordinary hospital visit. A valuable collaborator was lying on the bed, so of course, I should come.\u201dIt\u2019s funny. As I stared at him suspiciously, Cheon Sa-yeon narrowed his brow slightly without wiping out his smile.\u201cIt\u2019s true that there\u2019s a business, but I also really have a purpose for visiting. Above all else, it was dangerous this time.\u201d\u201cIt was dangerous. Me?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think healing ability is universal, do you? You must know that even a healer can use their ability only if the patient has a serious internal injury after undergoing surgery.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was nothing to say back. It was correct from one to ten.In the case of the healing ability used by healers, they could attach and heal torn flesh, but they could not restore a twisted or broken state. That was the realm of the \u2018restoration\u2019 (\ubcf5\uc6d0) ability.So, in case of an internal injury, the power of medicine was absolutely necessary. The condition could become more serious if it was allowed to heal prematurely with healing ability.\u201cThe distance from N23 Area to the hospital is about two hours. Park Geon-ho, who was injured, put you in his car and drove himself to take you. It was a signal violation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was natural for reporters to take pictures in the process. Healer Min Ah-rin followed you into the operating room. She said you bled so much that she had to heal you as soon as your surgery was over.\u201d\u201c\u2026that.\u201dThe more I listened, the more my mouth dried up. I think the situation was more serious than I expected.After hesitating for a while, I came up with my own excuse.\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. As you can see and hear, if I hadn\u2019t acted, Kim Woo-jin would have been hurt. If one person is going to get hurt anyway, an A-rank is better than a C-rank.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, huh.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon opened his mouth, leaning against the back of his chair in a relaxed gesture.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. I must have told you last time. If you move without taking care of yourself, you won\u2019t last long.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in other circumstances, but this time it was the best. As you said, I have to bleed for about two hours, but how does Kim Woo-jin, who is no different from ordinary people, endure it?\u201d\u201cIn my eyes, you look much weaker than Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI\u2019m speaking seriously, but this guy\u2026When I looked annoyed without an answer, Cheon Sa-yeon smiled as he curled his eyebrows. Happy?\u201cAnyway, I want you to be more careful in the future. In the end, it is up to me to take care of it.\u201d\u201cYour valuable collaborator is sick, so why don\u2019t you do that?\u201d\u201cEven thinking for other people. As much as you worry about Kim Woo-jin, Kim Woo-jin will also worry about you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would have been better if I could see in person what everyone looked like when you passed out. Then, even if a similar situation occurs next time, I will think about it.\u201d\u201cI knew\u2026\u201dYou\u2019re nagging a lot.I\u2019m tired of mental attacks that were worse than hearing Kim Woo-jin or Min Ah-rin nagging, but the door to the hospital room opened and someone entered.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dMin Ah-rin, with her slightly tired face, saw me and hurriedly approached me with a surprised expression.\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhen you wake up, ring the call bell! How\u2019s your body? Are there any uncomfortable places?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine.\u201dAs I spoke with a slight smile, Min Ah-rin greeted Cheon Sa-yeon who was sitting next to her, feeling relieved.\u201cI was very worried, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did anything happen after I passed out?\u201d\u201cYes. As expected, the final battle location was inside a hidden path on the first floor. When we went up to the third floor, the floor that had collapsed was also restored to its original state, so we immediately came out through the gate exit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u201d\u201cNo one was seriously injured except for Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI averted my gaze.Cheon Sa-yeon, who was watching Min Ah-rin\u2019s conversation with a smile, opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you come forward every time even when people around you worried so much.\u201d\u201cI understand. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very relevant.\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not true.\u201dAt the words of Min Ah-rin, who raised her eyebrows and gave a sad expression, she hurriedly shook her head in denial. I always felt grateful to those who cared about me. I\u2019m surprised that she cared so much even though she didn\u2019t do anything in particular.As I was stunned, Min Ah-rin smiled as she wiped away her tears.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. However, I hope you will be more careful in the future.\u201d\u201cYes. I will.\u201dNodding my head, I brought up a question that I had been curious about for a long time.\u201cBut where is Kim Woo-jin?\u201dMin Ah-rin\u2019s face darkened at those words. Cheon Sa-yeon also just looked at me, but there was no answer.\u2026did something happen? You said I was the only one with serious injuries. I quickly got off the bed in a tense atmosphere.\u201cWhere is he? Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dA corner of my head became cold at the sight of Min Ah-rin, who hesitated but did not easily tell me.\u201cExplain it to me please. Maybe another monster appeared after I passed out? Therefore\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon rose from his seat and gently grabbed my stiff shoulder.\u201cI think you should calm down for now.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIt was then that I realized that I was pushing Min Ah-rin. I bit my lip and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s because you\u2019re surprised.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who, unlike me, had kept her composure, carefully continued to talk.\u201cWoo-jin-ssi\u2026 He wasn\u2019t hurt, but he wasn\u2019t in good condition.\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201dWatching the reaction of Cheon Sa-yeon standing behind me, Min Ah-rin nodded her head and beckoned to me.\u201cIt would be quicker to see it in person. Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0is in the hospital room right next door. Let\u2019s go together.\u201dIs he in the hospital room? I swallowed dry saliva and followed Min Ah-rin without hesitation.* * *When I entered the next room, I saw Kim Woo-jin lying on the bed. Seeing him panting with a reddened face, I hurriedly approached and looked at his forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a fever.\u201dThe skin that touched the palm of my hand was very hot. Seeing Kim Woo-jin in pain as if he was about to run out of breath, Min Ah-rin explained with a gloomy expression.\u201cThe energy is so strong that his body can\u2019t stand it. The energy that has risen beyond the limit is attacking his heart.\u201d\u201cWhat is the cause?\u201d\u201cSeveral experts have been here, but\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin couldn\u2019t finish her words and bit her mouth. It meant that she couldn\u2019t find the cause of his abnormal energy and how to fix it.\u201cIt was fine when Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0entered the operating room. He collapsed suddenly after surgery.\u201d\u201cThen he\u2019s been in this state for over a day.\u201d\u201cYes. The fever does not go down even with antipyretics. Fortunately, Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0is holding up, but if he didn\u2019t get his energy back even for a moment\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026are you saying it\u2019s dangerous?\u201dMin Ah-rin put on a depressed expression. The inside of my throat tingled.\u2018I need to save him.\u2019Such a case had not been seen in the novel. What should I do? Numerous thoughts rushed through my mind.I heard there is a producer who sold illegal potions in the Red Market, should I look for him? Or how about contacting an S-rank recovery person in Japan? There may be a problem with the energy, so we had to restore it\u2026\u2018No. The possibility is too low.\u2019The given time was too short to try various things. I clenched my fists in nervousness.What should I do? What should I\u2026\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon called me in a soft voice as my head bowed without finding a clear solution.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let Healer Min Ah-rin leave.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was rolling her eyes here and there, looking at me and Cheon Sa-yeon, gently stepped back.\u201cYes. Um, I\u2019ll be back a little later.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was looking at me with her worried face, left the hospital room.\u201cWhat? If it\u2019s not urgent, later\u2026\u201d\u201cI know someone who can save Kim Woo-jin.\u201dI opened my eyes wide at the unexpected words and looked at Cheon Sa-yeon. Due to his personality, there was no way he could speak nonsense. I swallowed dry saliva and approached Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cThis is the first time this has happened to me, so I\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s more likely than anything else.\u201d\u201cWho is it? Where can I go to meet them?\u201dIt was worth looking for just because of the high possibility. Cheon Sa-yeon smiled softly as he looked down at me as I was rushing to ask questions.\u201cI can contact them instead for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want me to do that, Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dTense entered my forehead. You\u2019re going to contact them instead?There was no way he could do it for nothing. Come to think of it, he said that there was a business that he came to my hospital room from the beginning.I looked at Kim Woo-jin, who was in pain from being pressed by the energy. There was only one choice.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dFor this time, whatever you ask for in return, let\u2019s do our best to accommodate it. When I was ready to look at Cheon Sa-yeon, he raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth.\u201cHmm. Well.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who pretended to think, shrugged his shoulders and said lightly.\u201cAre you going to beg for help while trembling in\u00a0aegyo?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say bullshit.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit. I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201cSay it right. Whatever it may be, I\u2019ll try it.\u201dI said this in consideration of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s feelings, but on the contrary, he had a sad expression on his face. Why the hell? Anyway, he\u2019s unpredictable.\u201cIn two weeks, a party will be held for guild masters across the country.\u201d\u201cParty?\u201dWhat party all of a sudden?\u201cAs the gate anomaly continued, the management headquarters also seemed to feel a sense of crisis. The purpose is to share and unite the information of each guild\u2019s gate\u2026 Well, we\u2019ll see if it goes well.\u201dIt certainly made sense to gather for that purpose. Especially for guild masters located in rural areas, it won\u2019t be easy to get gate information.\u201c\u2026so what does that have to do with me?\u201d\u201cThe attendee is allowed to bring one partner.\u201dIt was creepy, I had goosebumps on my back.\u201cAre you now\u2026\u201d\u201cI was just looking for a partner to go with.\u201d\u201cYou crazy.\u201dYou\u2019re not asking me to enter the gate or kidnap anyone.Party? Do you want to go to a party with me?\u201cHow can the price be like this?\u201dI barely swallowed the words \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d, which came up to my chin, and asked as if I was arguing.\u201cI think it\u2019s a losing trade for me.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon\u2019s white, slender fingers gently stroked my cheeks.\u201cDo you think so? Save Kim Woo-jin as well, take you to a place where you can get gate information, I think you\u2019re on your knees to say thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was an irrefutable statement. I bit my lip in embarrassment.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve never been to a place like that. I\u2019d rather you take someone else.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to overdo it on my partner who has been forced to follow me. You better put an end to unnecessary worries.\u201d\u201c\u2026so you mean, if I just follow you to the party, you\u2019re going to call them?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dReally that\u2019s enough? It was suspicious, but I had no choice but to believe for now. I accepted the offer without thinking for a long time.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go to a party or something, so call them asap.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a wise choice.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon took out his cell phone and smiled brightly.* * *While waiting the person called by Cheon Sa-yeon came, Min Ah-rin and I worked hard so that Kim Woo-jin could endure as much as possible. I didn\u2019t see any particular effect.After two hours, which felt like a long time in an anxious mind, Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been away, returned to the hospital room. Behind him, there was a man I saw for the first time.\u201cThis is item maker, Edward Asner (\uc5d0\ub4dc\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc560\uc2a4\ub108). He said he wanted to meet the person with the abnormal energy in person.\u201dAt the introduction of Cheon Sa-yeon, a small man walked forward with hesitation. Min Ah-rin and I greeted with a warm heart.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Healer Min Ah-rin.\u201d\u201cYeah, hello. Please call me Eddy.\u201dWhether he was wearing an interpreter item, he answered fluently in Korean. Edward, small enough to be half my height, fidgeted with his curly blonde hair and smiled slightly. He looked very young.\u201cEddy specializes in producing energy-related items. It will help resolve Kim Woo-jin\u2019s condition.\u201d\u201cI just happened to be in Korea. I thought it would be pretty important if Cheon Sa-yeon-ssi\u00a0contacted me first.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon and Edward seemed to know each other quite well. Edward gently leaned his body to the side and looked at Kim Woo-jin, who was covered by me.\u201cIs that him? Someone who has a problem with energy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dEdward looked down at Kim Woo-jin with a serious face. Edward looked at him for a while and then nodded his head. I waited nervously for his words.\u201cFortunately, it is exactly what I expected. As long as he holds on to his energy, he will recover quickly.\u201d\u201cIs that really true?\u201d\u201cYes. This is not the first time this has happened, so I can be sure.\u201dThis is not the first time? Min Ah-rin asked in surprise.\u201cAre you saying there was another person like Woo-jin-ssi?\u201d\u201cUm, it was about last year. A child living in the province of China was at risk of his life as his energy was amplified. He was able to be helped because it was a village where I stopped by for volunteer service.\u201d\u201cThen do you know the cause?\u201dEdward nodded his head calmly at my words.\u201cThe child lost his family right before his eyes. After he recovered, he talked to me and said that he had a hard time because he felt guilty for not protecting his family.\u201dMy mind was blanked out by the answer. Guilty for not protecting?\u201cPerhaps something similar happened to this person. What is certain is that energy is greatly influenced by emotions. When you have an experience that is so intense that you can\u2019t control your emotions, your energy also loses balance and starts to shake.\u201dI barely swallowed the sigh that was about to burst. My chest tingled like thorns moving around.\u2018Then the reason Kim Woo-jin became like this\u2026\u2019Is it because of me? The act of trying to protect Kim Woo-jin eventually led to his death. An indescribable feeling arose.Edward tapped the large jewel-encrusted ring and pulled out his item. A round item with the size of a thumb was similar in appearance to a pill.He put the item into Kim Woo-jin\u2019s mouth.\u201cIt will melt slowly and be absorbed into the body without swallowing it. The anxious energy will gradually return to stability.\u201d\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201dEdward smiled softly at the thanks.\u201cIt is only a matter of time until recovery, but the future is important.\u201d\u201cThe future\u2026\u201d\u201cThis person will have a different energy level just like that child. It means he\u2019s going to get his grades up.\u201dEven Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s eyes, who was silently watching from behind, lit up as if intrigued. Min Ah-rin murmured with an incredible look.\u201cIs it possible to upgrade a rank, really?\u201d\u201cIf he has this kind of energy, he will probably become an A-rank. Korea has a well-developed ability measurement system, so I suggest he checks it out after he recovers.\u201dPerhaps the item effect appeared while we were in a brief conversation, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s breathing sound became a little more comfortable. It was such a relief.After looking at Kim Woo-jin for a while, I turned my gaze to Edward and nodded my head.\u201cI understand.\u201dAs long as it wasn\u2019t painful, it didn\u2019t matter how much the grade was different. Rather, Kim Woo-jin might like it. Because he was a guy who was dissatisfied with his ability.Edward looked at me quietly and smiled at ease.\u201cThank you for coming today.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s a request from Cheon Sa-yeon-ssi, who is not anyone else. Of course, I should come. Thanks to you, I was able to meet good people.\u201dEdward, who responded with a bright voice to Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words, looked at Kim Woo-jin and made a sad face.\u201cI would like to stay longer, but I have a schedule behind me, so I think I will have to go.\u201d\u201cI will guide you to the front of the building.\u201d\u201cThank you. It was nice to meet you two.\u201dI and Min Ah-rin shook hands with Edward to say goodbye.\u201cThank you so much for your help today.\u201d\u201cBe careful when you go.\u201d\u201cYes. I hope to see you both again.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon left the hospital room with Edward waving his hand softly. Min Ah-rin, with her slightly recalled face, opened her mouth while picking a drink.\u201cI\u2019m glad that Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0is getting better, but I was really surprised. I can\u2019t believe the grade that has already been set can go up.\u201dI agreed with those words and recalled the novel. This was not the case in the original. Even Kim Woo-jin wasn\u2019t the first.Min Ah-rin, who had been thinking about this and that, tilted her head slightly.\u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s similar to when you awaken as a talented person. People with useful ability often wake up in the face of intense events.\u201dIt certainly is. A person who was in danger of being stabbed by a sword after meeting a murderer was awakened as a talented person with the ability to strengthen the body or a person who was about to be in a traffic accident awakened as a talented person with an evasion ability.\u201cIt\u2019s an unexpected result, so I\u2019m a bit flustered\u2026 But Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0is Woo-jin-ssi. As long as his recovery goes well, I can congratulate him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI smiled at Min Ah-rin, who was smiling at me, but Cheon Sa-yeon came back after seeing Edward off.\u201cI\u2019ll have to make an appointment with the measurement centre first.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon was sure that Kim Woo-jin would get better. That meant he trusted Edward.\u201cCan you detect a change in ability if you take a measurement?\u201d\u201cFor now. But you have to make an accurate judgement.\u201dIf Kim Woo-jin became an A-rank, it was clear that his ability to blur his presence, which used to be a C-rank, would also change. I don\u2019t know what kind of ability he would have, but even if it was a non-combat ability, he had become an A-rank from a C-rank, so he would grow taller and have more stamina.\u201cBecause he belongs to a guild, we cannot hide the results or make them private. It will be noisy for a while when it turns out that he has been upgraded from C-rank to A-rank.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201dWhether the fever was dropping or not, Kim Woo-jin was sleeping comfortably without wrinkling his forehead. His face was still a little red, but by this, he seemed to be recovering well.The guy had a lot of things to do when he woke up. Feeling tired already, I exhaled a weary breath.Table of ContentsT/N :Yeay~ Finally we caught up until Woo-jin evolved(?) his rank! :3Also, don\u2019t judge or mad at Sa-yeon, let him be happy for now (since it\u2019s his birthday today, in my place the time\u2019s already on September 21st) wwwwwHappy birthday, Sa-yeon!! I\u2019ll always support you no matter what!! (\u2565\ufe4f\u2565) Just be happy and have enough rest if you got tired uwuwuwuwuHere, I added the bonus or side story that had nothing to do with the official story (but made by Author-nim). The set in this bonus is before chapter 100.Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s BirthdayHe thought it would be a little difficult to have a happy birthday. Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t like his birthday very much. Expensive gifts came from many places, but he didn\u2019t particularly welcome or like them. He was sitting alone in the representative office in a more depressed and sensitive state than usual, and Yi-gyeol would open the door and take a peek.It was rare for Yi-gyeol to come first even though he wasn\u2019t called, so Cheon Sa-yeon wondered inwardly as to how he was going. Whether Cheon Sa-yeon said it or not, Yi-gyeol, who came close to him half-heartedly, said that he heard that it was his birthday and had nothing to give, but just took it. He pulled a strawberry candy out of his pocket.When Cheon Sa-yeon inadvertently accepted the candy, Yi-gyeol left the representative office without any regrets. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was left alone holding the candy again, looked at the candy for a moment, peeled it, and put it in his mouth. It was unpleasant to feel the sweetness spreading in his mouth, but he didn\u2019t spit it out to the end. Still, he didn\u2019t think this birthday was pretty bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My name is Park Ji-won (\ubc15\uc9c0\uc6d0), the Head of the Research Team at the centre.\u201dPark Ji-won, who smiled brightly, shook my hand and asked.\u201cI heard the story from Master Cheon Sa-yeon. Who is the person who will be measured today?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s this person.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk pushed Kim Woo-jin, who was standing behind me, and said. Kim Woo-jin, who had a sad expression on his face, wrinkled his brow.\u201cKim Woo-jin-nim, right? Follow me. I will guide you to the measurement room.\u201dWhether Kim Woo-jin was dissatisfied or not, Park Ji-won took the lead and led us without losing her smile.\u201cWhen I heard the news that the grade had been raised from C-rank to A-rank, I put all the talented people on standby. I will do my best as the Master Cheon Sa-yeon directly commissioned me.\u201dThe measurement centre was larger than expected. It was full of vitality with those who came to receive measurements after awakening, or those who wanted to check the grade and performance of the item.\u201cIf you have read the brochure we sent you, you will know that we are proud of the largest scale in Korea. By having an experienced measurement research team and state-of-the-art devices, you can receive more accurate and safe performance of the measurement.\u201dPark Ji-won\u2019s voice, introducing the facility as she walked through the hallway, overflowed with confidence. Park Ji-won, who took the elevator and came to the basic measurement room on the third floor, looked at us and said.\u201cOnly those who will be measured will come in, and others will be asked to wait. It takes about 2 hours to complete from basic measurement to in-depth measurement and ability analysis. If you go to the centre, there is a cafe, so you can wait there.\u201dAt those words, Kim Woo-jin became sullen. He didn\u2019t want to go into the examination alone. However, we couldn\u2019t follow along, so we coolly handed Kim Woo-jin over to Park Ji-won and the researchers.\u201cGet it well.\u201dWhen I briefly greeted Kim Woo-jin, who was looking at me with sparkling eyes as if hoping for something, turned his back with a disappointed expression.We saw off Kim Woo-jin, who entered the measurement room, and there was nothing to do, so we went to the cafe that Park Ji-won told us. Seeing the cheesecake at the showcase, Min Ah-rin pulled my arm with her excited voice.\u201cCake! Let\u2019s order the cake, too!\u201d\u201cThe cake is good. Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi, what would you like to drink?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just have an Americano.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m going to buy it, shall I also buy chocolate cake?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dI nodded my head as I pulled out my card with the intention of buying something for Min Ah-rin, who had suffered so far. Min Ah-rin, who loved sweets as much as I did, ordered desserts and drinks as if she was running out of breath, and Woo Seo-hyuk took a step back and watched. I could feel his will to never join us.\u201cCan I eat them all?\u201dAfter placing the order, Min Ah-rin made a slightly regretful look, whether the reason had returned. After finishing the payment, I put my card into my wallet and comforted her.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can eat it all and leave it when you are full.\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u2026 It\u2019s so touching.\u201dAs if she liked my answer, Min Ah-rin smiled satisfied and handed the tray full of desserts and drinks to Woo Seo-hyuk. Woo Seo-hyuk, who received it in the blink of an eye, followed us with an awkward expression.* * *\u201cExcept for me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201dThe measurement ended earlier than planned, Kim Woo-jin returned less than two hours later. Kim Woo-jin, who found us chatting with desserts and drinks piled up on the table, pouted out.\u201cYou worked hard.\u201dI thought he would get sulky, so I sat Kim Woo-jin in his seat and pushed the dessert to him. Kim Woo-jin, who glanced at me like that, relaxed his expression and started eating the cake quietly.\u201cDid the measurement result come out?\u201d\u201cApproximately. The details will be sent in documents by tomorrow.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who quickly ate a cake because he was hungry, told the result.\u201cI was confirmed as an A-rank clone magician (\ubd84\uc2e0\uc220\uc0ac\ub85c, \u201cbunsinsulsaro\u201d so yup, like kage bunshin no jutsu). If I practice consistently, I can create up to two clones, and if I use my abilities, my body will be strengthened.\u201d\u201cWhen you say strengthened, is it an additional ability?\u201dAt Min Ah-rin\u2019s question, Kim Woo-jin shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not to that extent.\u201dIt was said that from a B-rank attack, wounds were inflicted. If so, it meant that Kim Woo-jin and his clone could not be injured with an attack below C-rank.\u201cEven though your body is strengthened, you need to have combat skills because you share the senses with your clone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who was quietly listening to the conversation, took out his cell phone and got up from his seat.\u201cNow that the schedule is over, we will prepare to return to the guild. I will report to Master, so please go down first.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAfter clearing the table and leaving Woo Seo-hyuk behind, I came down to the first floor and stopped walking. Dozens of reporters, who had not been seen until morning, were encamped at the centre entrance.\u201cWait. Wait a moment.\u201dI quickly grabbed Kim Woo-jin, who was about to leave without thinking, and looked around the situation. It must have come from a broadcasting station camera.Min Ah-rin, who understood the situation just like me, made a worried face.\u201cHey, I think the news has already spread.\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who followed us down to the first floor, hurriedly approached us.\u201cIt seems that information about Attendant Kim Woo-jin\u2019s rank has been posted on the Internet. Master said he\u2019s sending the security personnel right now, so we\u2019ll have to leave a little later.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk opened his portal site on his cell phone and showed it to me. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s name was on the search term.\u300cRising search ranking1 A-rank2 Requiem Kim Woo-jin3 Rank up4 C-rank Kim Woo-jin5 Kim Woo-jin\u300dEven though his name was on the search list, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s expression did not change much. Kim Woo-jin just seemed annoyed and bothered by all of this.\u201cI expected it to get a lot of attention, but I didn\u2019t know it was going to be this fast.\u201d\u201cIn the meantime, more reporters came. The centre is blocking them to some extent, but\u2026\u201dAt Min Ah-rin\u2019s words, Woo Seo-hyuk looked outside and made a troubled expression. No matter how fast the security personnel sent by the guild arrive, it would take 30 minutes.I sighed and said.\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi, please cancel the security personnel. Let\u2019s just fly.\u201d\u201cWill it be okay?\u201d\u201cFour people are enough. If you stay here, it will be a nuisance to the centre as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dAfter thinking about it for a while, Woo Seo-hyuk finally nodded his head when he said that it was a nuisance.\u201cWe\u2019d better leave in front of reporters. Then those people will no longer gather here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201cKim Woo-jin, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dAfter the discussion, we walked out of the building without delay. When we appeared, the waiting reporters quickly started filming.\u201cTalented Kim Woo-jin!\u201d\u201cPlease give me a short interview!\u201d\u201cPlease say something about your rank up!\u201dKim Woo-jin frowned at the white flash that was pouring towards him. The number of reporters I met in person was much higher than when I saw them inside the building. I made sure that all three grabbed my arm, and I quickly used my ability to prevent the damage from increasing.\u201cOh, oh?\u201d\u201cPlease wait! Talented Kim Woo-jin!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the ability to fly!\u201dAs our bodies rose high, the reporters shouted Kim Woo-jin\u2019s name in bewildered voices. I started moving in the direction of the guild, rising to the point where my feet could barely be seen.\u201cEveryone, be careful not to miss me.\u201d\u201cWow, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m finally getting Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s ability.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it better than you think? It\u2019s very high, isn\u2019t it scary?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun. I\u2019m not afraid of heights. Are you two okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk calmly answered Min Ah-rin\u2019s question, and Kim Woo-jin nodded his head but grabbed my arm with strength. Come to think of it, Kim Woo-jin was nervous the last time he went to see Cha Soo-yeon. Pretend not to, but aren\u2019t you afraid of high places? I lowered the altitude slightly.We arrived safely at the Requiem Guild and came down to the ground. Fortunately, in front of the guild, there were no reporters in sight as to whether Cheon Sa-yeon had taken action.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the representative office. Master is waiting for you.\u201dAfter talking a few words with the attendant who was guarding the front of the guild, Woo Seo-hyuk spoke to me and Kim Woo-jin.\u201cI will return to the Healer Team now. See you later.\u201dLeaving behind Min Ah-rin, who originally had a schedule, I went up to the representative office located on the top floor.As if waiting for us, Cheon Sa-yeon closed the document he was looking at and opened his mouth.\u201cYou came sooner than I expected.\u201d\u201cI just used my skills. Information about Kim Woo-jin, where did it come from?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a measurement centre employee, but it doesn\u2019t mean much to me now. Anyway, as soon as the A-rank was confirmed through measurement, I was prepared to leak it out.\u201d\u201cI thought it was a rumour under the water. It hasn\u2019t been officially announced yet, but this is a bit of a headache.\u201d\u201cAfter the official announcement, it will be even more chaotic. At that time, foreign media will also flock in.\u201dKim Woo-jin was not particularly interested in this part and was bothered by it, so I was very worried. Perhaps he noticed my heart, Cheon Sa-yeon said slowly.\u201cUnlike Han Yi-gyeol, Kim Woo-jin is a member of a guild. You don\u2019t have to worry too much because he can be managed and protected by the guild.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 that\u2019s a relief.\u201dI looked at Kim Woo-jin with a dismal answer.\u201cMaster is right. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dKim Woo-jin nodded his head proudly at my gaze. I don\u2019t know if I can trust you.\u201cKim Woojin. I\u2019ll give you training room no.17 for a while. I\u2019ve also pre-selected S-rank guild members to teach you, so starting tomorrow, start practising your skills and training for six hours each.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dEven though six hours would be burdensome, Kim Woo-jin nodded his head without any complaints. Yes, I think he needed some practice too, but six hours was too long.\u201cThe official announcement is set for four days later. Until then, let\u2019s have some control over the clones.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dWhat. There was tension in the gaze of Cheon Sa-yeon looking at me came over. What else are you calling me to say?\u201cI\u2019ll send you a present to your room next week or so. It\u2019s an important item, so make sure you get it.\u201d\u201cA\u2026 present?\u201dWhat present suddenly? I tilted my head as I had no idea what it was, but instead of giving a proper answer, Cheon Sa-yeon raised the corner of his mouth slightly and laughed playfully.\u201cIf there is something you don\u2019t know well after receiving it, please come to me anytime.\u201d\u201c\u2026what, yes.\u201dI felt uncomfortable, but I nodded my head. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s no need to refuse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rank upKim Woo-jin, even after his energy, which had been running wild, calmed down, he could hardly come to his senses and slept. It was only after a full day had passed that he opened his eyes.\u201cUu\u2026\u201dAround 5 a.m., Kim Woo-jin searched for water with a groaning sound. As I waited for him to wake up without leaving my seat, I brought a cup of lukewarm water to his mouth.Kim Woo-jin, who took the water and drank like a baby bird eating food without knowing who gave it, opened his closed eyes and looked at me.\u201c\u2026Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dKim Woo-jin made a surprised face and jumped his upper body. I set the empty glass of water on the side table and sat down on the chair next to the bed.\u201cHere is\u2026\u201d\u201cGuild hospital room. You are waking up in two days now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been two days? How come\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard you collapsed when the surgery was over. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d\u201cFainting\u2026\u201dPerhaps because Kim Woo-jin had just woken up, his mind was still hazy. After thinking for a while, the guy stuttered in a confused voice.\u201cMy body, was a little hot. I thought it was a cold\u2026\u201dAfter staring blankly at me for a moment, he wrinkled his eyebrows and grabbed my shoulder.\u201cWhere are you hurt? Are you okay? The bleeding didn\u2019t stop, I\u2019m afraid something will happen before you get to the hospital\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, so calm down.\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes were red as if they were about to shed tears at any moment. His hand, which was holding my shoulder tightly, trembled.The fact that he had worried about me enough to lose the balance of his energy could be felt on my skin again. I thought he would be even more anxious if I reacted emotionally, so I unbuttoned my shirt while speaking as calmly as possible.\u201cNow, see for yourself. No scars left, right?\u201dI unbuttoned the button all the way to reveal my wounded side. Kim Woo-jin, who blinked his eyes several times and stared at my body tenaciously, gently swept my waist with a careful touch.\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d\u201c\u2026ung.\u201dOnly then did Kim Woo-jin breathe a sigh of relief. I buttoned my shirt again and opened my mouth.\u201cYou are more trouble than me. How is your body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Rather, it seems to be lighter than before.\u201dPerhaps not noticing that his energy had changed, Kim Woo-jin tilted his head with a puzzled expression. There was no need to hold onto the kid who just woke up and give complicated explanations.As I got up from his seat, I pressed Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder firmly. Kim Woo-jin, who was lying down again, opened his eyes and looked up at me.\u201cSleep more. I\u2019ll come back with Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0in the morning. You have something to listen to\u2026 You will probably be very busy soon.\u201d\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain to you when you wake up.\u201dThe unstable energy had improved, but he would need a rest as there had been a lot of strain on the body. As I expected, he was tired, but Kim Woo-jin relaxed his body without resisting. He slowly closed his eyes a couple of times and then opened them, hesitatingly, he opened his mouth.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cWhy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my fault\u2026\u201dWhat an apology all of a sudden? I couldn\u2019t even respond properly to the random words and looked at him, but Kim Woo-jin continued with a calm expression.\u201cThe question from the gate. Sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not something you have to apologize for.\u201dApologizing was not what he should be doing. Even if you\u2019re disappointed, it\u2019s me who hasn\u2019t changed my choice.\u201cBefore, I wanted to know what you were hiding\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine now. Whatever you do\u2026 I will always be by your side.\u201dThe quivering words were a bit childish. I was choked with emotions that I couldn\u2019t even define.\u201cLet me do that, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dI gave a bitter smile to Kim Woo-jin, who looked at me with a pleading gaze, and covered the dishevelled quilt up to his chest.The deep blue dawn light gently shone on Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face. Without giving any answer, I turned around and left the room.* * *\u201cWell. The energy is completely back to normal. We can relax now.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was holding Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand and examining his energy, said with a bright smile.\u201cI am A-rank\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the explanation from me and Min Ah-rin, Kim Woo-jin still couldn\u2019t believe his situation.\u201cYou have an appointment for the measurement centre. You will know the detailed abilities when you measure them.\u201d\u201cThis is the first case in Korea where the grade has changed\u2026 Maybe the media will flock in.\u201dIn fact, it was more likely to be a mess than a little crowded. He had moved up two levels from C-rank to A-rank, but there was no way it would be over after a few articles.\u201cOne way or another, it\u2019s true that it\u2019s something to celebrate. Congratulations, Woo-jin-ssi.\u201d\u201cYeah. Now that you\u2019re an A, your ability will change, so you can stop worrying about being stuck with useless people.\u201dMin Ah-rin and I said a word, Kim Woojin bit his lip and bowed his head slightly. It was the expression that Kim Woo-jin made whenever he was embarrassed.\u201cAh! We still have time, so why don\u2019t you try this and that to see what kind of ability you might have?\u201dMin Ah-rin clapped her hands and said excitedly.\u201cIf you use your energy, your ability will be activated. I\u2019m curious. No?\u201dI nodded my head. Perhaps Kim Woo-jin was of the same mind, with an awkward expression, he raised his energy.\u201cUm?\u201dThen there was something blurry next to Kim Woo-jin. As if looking at a screen with poor transmission condition, the crackling shape looked quite similar to Kim Woo-jin at a glance.\u201cKim Woo-jin, use your energy more.\u201d\u201c\u2026like this?\u201dAs I said, he used more energy and the shape became much clearer. Min Ah-rin shouted in surprise.\u201cThere are two Woo-jin-ssi!\u201dAnother Kim Woo-jin, made with Kim Woo-jin\u2019s ability, looked at me blankly. Kim Woo-jin was bewildered when he saw his own replica.\u201cWh, what?\u201d\u201cIs it like an alter ego? Or you can duplicate everything.\u201dEither way, Kim Woo-jin, who was made in front of me, was quite interesting. I got closer and took a closer look, but I couldn\u2019t see anything different from the real thing. Even the mole under the right eyebrow was the same.\u201cYou have to take measurements to find out. But it doesn\u2019t look bad either way.\u201dListening to Min Ah-rin and looked at the fake Kim Woo-jin, and the guy blushed a little and secretly wrapped his arms around my waist and hugged me. Kim Woo-jin jumped up and down when I left it that way because it was fresh for an action he would never actually do.\u201cWhat is that bastard doing!\u201dHey.A pure admiration arose at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s ferocity, who relentlessly swears at the person who looked just like him, saying that he was that bastard. Whether or not the real was startled, the fake did not stop hugging me but rubbed his face against my shoulder. He looked like a puppy.\u201cI guess they look the same, but their personalities are different.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cYou crazy. Don\u2019t you let go right now?\u201dUnlike me and Min Ah-rin, who were just having fun, Kim Woo-jin growled towards the fake with a hideous face. Then, the terrifying fake withdrew his body slightly and dug deeper into me.Tsk, tsk. I felt sorry for how he looked, so I patted his back and said something.\u201cDon\u2019t do that. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEven though Woo-jin-ssi\u2019s face is like that, he looks very pitiful\u2026\u201dSo that\u2019s how it works. I asked Kim Woo-jin while hugging the fake.\u201cCalm down and figure out your ability. Can you connect your sense?\u201d\u201cSense?\u201dKim Woo-jin hesitated for a moment then carefully nodded his head.\u2018Um, that\u2019s not good.\u2019As if thinking the same as me, Min Ah-rin said worriedly.\u201cIf the fake gets hurt, Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0will feel the same pain.\u201d\u201cIt would be convenient if you could control it. If not, we have no choice but to be careful with fakes ones.\u201dAll of the abilities have their pros and cons. Right now, even with Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s wind ability, its utility had been high since then, but its attack power was weaker than other A-rank abilities.\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure yet, but if you\u2019re sharing your senses, you shouldn\u2019t use it carelessly.\u201d\u201cUung.\u201dKim Woo-jin looked at the fake with complicated eyes. It would still be unfamiliar and awkward. I beckoned to him, contemplating what to do.\u201cKim Woo-jin. Come here. It\u2019s your ability from now on, so you should get to know each other a little bit.\u201dIt meant hugging the fake like I did. However, Kim Woo-jin was rather frightened and stepped back.\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201dAt the same time as Kim Woo-jin said no, the fake also raised his eyebrows and shook his head. They got along well in weird places.\u201cIt\u2019s cute, but Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0here doesn\u2019t speak. Can\u2019t he do it?\u201d\u201cUm, I think\u2026\u201dI looked down at the fake with blank eyes and said what I had been thinking about for a while.\u201cWhat should I say? I don\u2019t think his intelligence is that high. It\u2019s similar to a dog? The expression of emotions is even more explicit.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, I feel bad.\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s expression turned pale. Even if you don\u2019t like fakes, you don\u2019t like hearing people who look just like you have low intelligence.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s said that controlling an alter ego is the most difficult ability in this field. It\u2019s because Woo-jin-ssi\u2019s first time, too. Wouldn\u2019t it be possible to master it with practice?\u201d\u201cIt makes sense.\u201dAfter all, the alter ego now didn\u2019t listen to the owner and did what he wanted.\u201cBy the way, it sticks to Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0and doesn\u2019t come off. I think it\u2019s because it resembles the owner.\u201dAt Min Ah-rin\u2019s words, the fake glanced at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes and came closer to me. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes grew fiercer. This is true.\u201cYes. Probably\u2026\u201dChu.As I answered, I stopped speaking at the strange feeling I felt on my cheeks. A cute voice resounded in the room filled with serious talk about abilities.Surprised, I looked to the side and the fake smiled brightly at me. This guy gave me a kiss on the cheek that only babies could do.\u201cThat crazy bastard!\u201dAt the same time as Kim Woo-jin\u2019s angry cry, the fake in my arms disappeared in an instant. Kim Woo-jin cut off his energy relentlessly. The inside of my arms was empty, so regrets came pouring in.\u201cWhy are you so angry? That\u2019s possible for a kid.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It just he was cute.\u201d\u201cBoth\u2026 both of you are insane.\u201dKim Woo-jin covered his bright red face with both hands. He seemed to feel shame for what the fake had done. I don\u2019t know at how long he would be able to control the alter ego after that.\u201cDon\u2019t do that, think positively about it. It\u2019s a pretty good skill.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take this opportunity to negotiate your salary with Master this time? You went from C-rank to A-rank.\u201d\u201cOh. That\u2019s good.\u201dWhile putting my head together with Min Ah-rin to extort a little more money from Cheon Sa-yeon, someone knocked on the door of the hospital room.\u201cGood morning.\u201dIt was Woo Seo-hyuk who came to visit. After greeting with a blunt voice, he handed the brochure he brought to Kim Woo-jin.\u201cI will accompany you to the measurement centre. Read the brochure on the way.\u201d\u201cDid Master send you?\u201d\u201cYes. You have to leave within 10 minutes to be on time.\u201dIf that\u2019s the case.There wasn\u2019t much to do, so we decided to leave right away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right now\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s noisy.\u201dThe opponent flicked his finger lightly. At the same time as the sound, the man\u2019s mouth was firmly shut.

Dirty, smelly, stupid\u2026 A man who fits perfectly with a pigsty.\u201dA man wearing a mask came over, roughly kicking the glasses and wine bottles that were rolling on the floor with his feet.

An instinct not wanting to touch the marble that fluttered in a dark blue glow surged just by looking at it.\u201cI heard that the management headquarters will host a party soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you participate too? Blun Guild Master.\u201dKang Seung-geon looked up at the other person with trembling eyes at that secret whisper. As he looked at the crescent-shaped smiling mouth carved on the mask, his eyes were distorted as if his brain was crushed.\u201cNow, you have to listen carefully and do what I say\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the marble was placed in Kang Seung-geon\u2019s grasp. Kang Seung-geon\u2019s eyes, holding the marble with both hands, lost focus and became blurry.* * *[The official announcement of the person who has been the most talked about in the past few days, Kim Woo-jin of the Requiem Guild, is in progress. On the 21st, Kim Woo-jin was officially confirmed as A-rank at the measurement centre, proving that the grade can be raised\u2026]When I turned on the TV while lying on the sofa, Cheon Sa-yeon and Kim Woo-jin in black suits appeared on the screen.[Many people have asked this question, but there is no information to tell you about the rank upgrade. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to get this result\u2026]Kim Woo-jin calmly answered the questions from reporters who were aggressively pouring in.\u2018He\u2019s going to get a little more popular, Kim Woo-jin.\u2019It wasn\u2019t bad before that, but his physique definitely improved as he reached A-rank. Even when he put it on, I felt that his appearance shone brighter.Looking at Kim Woo-jin happily, I picked up the papers I had put down again. It was the gate data that Kim Woo-jin received before going to the official presentation.\u201cUm?\u201dI was in the middle of reading that Jayna Guild\u2019s C-grade gate had raised to B-grade, and I heard a knock on the door. There was no way Kim Woo-jin had already returned. Min Ah-rin also said that she was busy today.\u2018Who is it?\u2019After removing the data, I went out to the door and saw one of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s attendants standing and holding a large box.\u201cThe Master told me to give it to you.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dIt was then that I remembered Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words that he would send a present. The box handed from the attendant was heavier than expected.When I returned to my room, there was no table for me to put on, so I put it down on the bed. The box was too luxurious to just throw it on the floor.\u201c\u2026what is this?\u201dWhat was inside was a suit set. From white shirts to shoes, cufflinks, and watches. It was the first time I\u2019d seen a suit put in a box like this, so I was a bit embarrassed.He said it was a present, but he seemed to have sent me a costume to wear to the party. I pulled out a black jacket with a slight blue tint and looked at it.It was a design that emphasized formality in a double-breasted style but was not too heavy. It must have been a suit that was quite expensive as it didn\u2019t feel rough in the hand.I shook my head as I looked at the clothes according to my previous habit.Very clever. Checking even the cufflinks splendidly decorated with red jewels, I pointed at my forehead.I haven\u2019t tried it on yet, but it was clear that it would fit perfectly on my body without any discomfort. Cheon Sa-yeon would already know the size of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, so it must have been customized.\u2018It would have taken at least a month to make it properly\u2026 Since when did you start preparing it?\u2019The thought of what happened again did not leave my mind. I had already made a deal, but I couldn\u2019t cancel it.Anyway, it was true that I needed clothes to wear, so I decided to keep the suit.The date of the party, as informed by Cheon Sa-yeon, is next Saturday. As all guild masters from all over the country gathered, even if Cheon Sa-yeon was by my side, I would have to be alert to avoid getting caught.\u2018The Jayna Guild will of course come, and Roheon\u2026 Ha Tae-heon will be there.\u2019Now that he had become a deputy master, he would not be able not to come. Jayna also had a second deputy master, so she would bring her as a partner.If I think about it, among the guilds in Seoul, only Requiem\u2019s deputy master was still vacant. Cheon Sa-yeon is so good at his job, he didn\u2019t really need it. Still, if there was a deputy master, I wouldn\u2019t have to step in.It was nice to be able to go to such an important place and got the information, but the thought of hanging out with Cheon Sa-yeon all day was already a pain in my head.\u2018Please, only accidents I can handle\u2026\u2019I let out a deep sigh of concern.* * *\u201cAre you coming right after it\u2019s over?\u201dOn the day of attending the party, Kim Woo-jin, who had been by my side the whole time wearing a suit, asked with a sullen voice.\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true too.\u201dI didn\u2019t tell Kim Woo-jin about the transaction I had with Cheon Sa-yeon. This decision was made in the hope that Kim Woo-jin would no longer feel guilty or indebted to me.Above all, if he found out that he had lived through the deal, he would overdo it more than he is now. He was still exhausted and wore out every time he went to the training room, which I couldn\u2019t let him be whipped any further.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dRealizing that there was nothing he could do about my resolute answer, Kim Woo-jin nodded while regretting it.I fastened a tie the same colour as my jacket and put cufflinks on the sleeves of my shirt. As expected, the suit wrapped around Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body.I moved the A-rank bracelet I was wearing on my left hand to my right hand and put the watch on my empty wrist. After wearing all the accessories, I checked the condition with a full-body mirror. It wasn\u2019t bad.\u201c\u2026What, why are you so good at this?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who was watching the series of processes from behind, blushed and grumbled. I was a little irritable, but pretended not to know and responded calmly.\u201cIt\u2019s the same when you get dressed.\u201dAs I walked to the door, Kim Woo-jin followed me. The dog that came out to meet the owner passed by my mind.\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201cUung.\u201dLeaving Kim Woo-jin behind, I left the room and went straight down to the underground parking lot. As I was informed in advance, when I got off the fourth basement floor, I saw Cheon Sa-yeon standing with the attendants.\u201cHmm.\u201dAs I got closer, Cheon Sa-yeon looked at me carefully from head to toe with a deep smile. I asked with a look that could not be ignored.\u201c\u2026what is it?\u201d\u201cIt suits you better than I thought.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFrowning, I looked at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s suit. A dark beige jacket with a black shirt and grey colour caught my eye. With the same double-breasted suit and black coat draped over his shoulders, it gave off a moderately heavy yet neat atmosphere.Cheon Sa-yeon, who showed his forehead by turning half of his bangs to fit the party, beckoned me to come closer to him, who was standing in the distance.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dAfter a few steps, he grabbed my tie and pulled me lightly. The waist slightly bent backwards, and the sense of distance from Cheon Sa-yeon became closer and closer.\u201cYou know how to wear a necktie.\u201d\u201cYeah, of course\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you would come with a necktie. You know how to wear a suit. Had I known this would happen, I would have sent you a garter belt as well.\u201dCome to think of it, he said that if there was anything I didn\u2019t know, I would come to him anytime after receiving it. I frowned and raised the corners of my mouth to smile.\u201cYou have a big dream, too. Even if I don\u2019t know how to wear a necktie, I won\u2019t have to go to the Master.\u201d\u201cWhy? I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll teach you well.\u201dI shook off the hand of Cheon Sa-yeon, who was constantly pulling the tie, and tightened the messy tie.\u201cIt would be inconvenient. Let\u2019s go.\u201d (\uc5b4\ub828\ud558\uc2dc\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c, not sure how to translate it)\u201cRight.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon opened his car door with a smile on his face. Why do you look so happy? The better Cheon Sa-yeon felt, the more anxious I felt, having experienced side effects.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As I turned my head and looked out the window, I felt a strange touch on my wrist.When I turned around to see, Cheon Sa-yeon was looking into my wrist and fiddling with it. Why are you so annoying like this today?\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou did a good job with the cufflinks.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you send it to me to do it?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if you don\u2019t.\u201dAfter that, I looked at the cufflinks that were fastened to the sleeves of my shirt. Elaborate and lavishly crafted cufflinks studded with red gemstones gleamed even in the dark.\u201cI did it because it was given to me, so if you are dissatisfied, please tell me. I\u2019ll take it out now.\u201d\u201cNo way. It\u2019s good that you use it well.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon answered in a soft voice and ran his fingers down the inside of my wrist that was hidden by the sleeve of my shirt. For some reason, the simple action made the back of my neck shiver and my shoulders shudder.\u2018What?\u2019An unknown sensation touched the nape of my neck, but Cheon Sa-yeon did not stop his hand and opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ve been to the Roheon Guild, so now you want to go to the Jayna Guild. Am I right?\u201d\u201cYeah, what\u2026 Jayna Guild Gate is also constantly being found anomalies, so it wouldn\u2019t be bad if you could go.\u201d\u201cMaster Hong Si-ah will also be attending this party, so if you talk well, she will leave a seat for you.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to help me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough just to take you there? I\u2019d rather gain some weight than that.\u201dTurning the talk. I clicked my tongue and tightened the grip to my caught wrist.\u201cStop it. How long will you touch me? All of this is sexual harassment.\u201d\u201cOh, no. Are you upset?\u201d\u201cStop talking nonsense.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who smiled bitterly, gently released my wrist and continued the conversation.\u201cI know what you want, but it\u2019s hard for me to put you, an independent, into the Jayna Guild Gate team. I don\u2019t know if Jayna wants it in the first place.\u201dAs expected, independents are uncomfortable at time like this. I sighed and nodded my head. It reminded me of Hong Si-ah I saw in the novel. I think she had an easygoing personality.\u201cIf you feel sad, you can join the guild now.\u201d\u201cNo, thanks.\u201dI have no intention of joining the guild just because of this. I hate it even more if it\u2019s under Cheon Sa-yeon.\u2018When I was hired as a mercenary last time, I should have chosen Jayna instead of Roheon.\u2019I thought about it for a moment, but I made up my mind. To regret it, the gate anomaly found in Roheon was quite significant. I even found a twisted space and an unidentified pattern.There is nothing left to regret about the past. Rather, it was much more beneficial to try to talk it out with Hong Si-ah at this party.\u201cJust don\u2019t disturb me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201dPerhaps my answer was unexpected, Cheon Sa-yeon raised the corner of his mouth slightly with an interesting look.\u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dJust in time, the car arrived at the hotel. The waiting hotel staff opened the car door.\u201cStand close and hold my arm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon handed over the coat to the attendant, who followed, bowed his head slightly and whispered to me.\u2018Even though we are partners, do men enter with their arms crossed?\u2019I had doubts, but I didn\u2019t know anything, so I followed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words with the thought of not getting into an accident. As I entered the entrance of the hotel with a slight grip on his arm, a large hall was revealed under a huge chandelier.\u201cWelcome. I will guide you to the entrance to the party.\u201dOne of the staff greeted us politely and guided us to the entrance to the party hall located inside the hall. The door to the party hall splendidly carved in gold opened on both sides, and a party hall with a huge statue in the centre appeared.\u201cIf possible, stay by my side. There are a lot of crazy people.\u201d\u201cWait, then, when are you going to meet Master Hong Si-ah?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon handed me a glass of champagne that was given to him by the staff.\u201cYou have to be careful with the timing. We have a lot of time, so there is no need to rush.\u201d\u201c\u2026don\u2019t disturb me, keep your word.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI didn\u2019t like the reaction that I was suspicious of everything, but I had no choice but to believe it. I took a sip of champagne and looked around.\u2018It seems Ha Tae-heon hasn\u2019t come yet.\u2019Ha Tae-heon\u2019s face was not seen among the dressed-up people. If I faced Ha Tae-heon, I wondered if it would be okay to pretend to know him.Even in the situation where Ha Tae-heon said that we knew each other first, there is Cheon Sa-yeon by my side, so if possible\u2026\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dWhile I was thinking about one thing or another, someone approached us. She was a woman with short black hair who made the impression of being sensitive. A woman in a suit with a strong sense of coming to work rather than party attire shook hands with Cheon Sa-yeon briefly.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it, but I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s disappointing. As a master, I am grateful to the management headquarters for hosting the party.\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t feel the slightest sincerity, but well. Who is this?\u201dThe woman who answered in an indifferent tone turned her gaze to me. There was a strange sense of wit in her demeanour. Cheon Sa-yeon raised one eyebrow slightly and answered in a sluggish tone.\u201cThis is my partner, Talented Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cAa. Nice to meet you. My name is Choi Mi-jin, the head of the gate management centre in the management headquarters.\u201dHead of the gate management centre? Choi Mi-jin held her outstretched hand and bowed her head lightly to greet me.\u201cI\u2019m Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cI wondered why Master Cheon Sa-yeon, who doesn\u2019t like this kind of place, came\u2026 Interesting.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNothing. It\u2019s a fate that we met like this, and I hope we can maintain a good relationship in the future.\u201dChoi Mi-jin, who smiled brightly at me and Cheon Sa-yeon, said that I would see her soon, and she left. Looking at the back of Choi Mi-jin, who was moving away with her back upright, I gently asked Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cSomehow she looks like a big shot\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true if it\u2019s Choi Mi-jin, the head of the centre. Among the executives of the management headquarters, she\u2019s even worthwhile.\u201dContrary to the evaluation, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look cool. He didn\u2019t seem to like Choi Mi-jin, although she\u2019s a good character.\u2018It\u2019s just that they don\u2019t like each other.\u2019Choi Mi-jin also had a pretty strong personality, so I don\u2019t think she would get along with Cheon Sa-yeon. As I sipped the champagne, kicking my tongue inwardly, the new person approached with a bright smile.\u201cIya, Master Cheon Sa-yeon! How long has it been?\u201d\u201cMaster Kwon Ji-hoon (\uad8c\uc9c0\ud6c8).\u201dHe was a handsome man with brown hair and drooping eyes. His grin and the dot on his right cheek caught the eye in particular.\u201cIt\u2019s been almost two years since I\u2019ve seen you. How have you been?\u201d\u201cSure, it is.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled slightly in response to his greeting. His facial expressions and gestures were like a model of social life.\u201cMy partner Han Yi-gyeol is a talented person. Master Kwon Ji-hoon, who is usually interested in talented people, may already know this.\u201dAs soon as the recent conversation was over, Cheon Sa-yeon lightly wrapped his arms around my shoulder, who was standing next to him. Kwon Ji-hoon\u2019s warm brown eyes, reminiscent of chocolate, turned to me.\u201cOf course. Nice to meet you, Talented Han Yi-gyeol. My name is Kwon Ji-hoon, who manages the Four Seasons (\uc0ac\uacc4) Guild in Busan.\u201d\u201cYes. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cThe video with Master Cheon Sa-yeon was really interesting. If there is a chance later, I would like to see you in person.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dI laughed awkwardly at the next sentence. That video\u2026\u201cIt is more surprising than that. Master Cheon Sa-yeon comes to this place.\u201d\u201cThe intent is too good to ignore.\u201d\u201cIndeed, everyone is suffering from the gate anomaly. The situation in Busan is not very good either.\u201dKwon Ji-hoon, who put down his finished glass, asked while holding a new glass of champagne.\u201cAre there no guilds in Seoul other than Requiem? I haven\u2019t seen Roheon or Jayna Guild Master yet. Blun, well, even if he doesn\u2019t come, it\u2019s understandable.\u201d\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t really communicate with each other.\u201d\u201cThe meeting will begin soon\u2026 uh.\u201dThat was then. The door to the party hall, which had never been opened since me and Cheon Sa-yeon came in, opened, and a pair of man and woman dressed in black suits walked in. Roheon Guild Master Lee Joo-ha and Deputy Master Ha Tae-heon.Ha Tae-heon, who was dressed neatly with his bangs turned over and no accessories, and Lee Joo-ha, a well-groomed beauty with black straight hair that fell down to her waist, looked great on anyone.Lee Joo-ha, who was escorted by Ha Tae-heon, immediately walked over to Choi Mi-jin and shook hands. It was far away so I couldn\u2019t hear the conversation, but the bright smiles on each other\u2019s faces didn\u2019t look bad.\u201cThe person who came in with Lee Joo-ha is Ha Tae-heon. Oh, should I call him Deputy Master now?\u201dI, who had been looking at Ha Tae-heon and Lee Joo-ha in disbelief, came to my senses and quickly turned my attention to Kwon Ji-hoon\u2019s words. Even though I expected to meet, I started to get a little nervous when I actually saw Ha Tae-heon.\u2018Somehow, is it because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met at a place where there\u2019s Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026\u2019I drank the remaining champagne to calm myself down.\u201cHm, hm. We will provide you with instructions.\u201dChoi Mi-jin, standing on the podium in front of the party, looked around the inside and spoke into the microphone.\u201cWe\u2019ll start the gate progress briefing in ten minutes. Participants are requested to be seated at tables marked by region.\u201dAfter that, I swallowed dry saliva. So do I have to sit at the same table with Roheon?\u201cOh, no. I should get going now. Enjoy the rest of your time, you two.\u201dKwon Ji-hoon, who heard the guide, left to gather with the local masters. I asked Cheon Sa-yeon, watching the people murmuring to their seats.\u201c\u2026do I have to sit with you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking the obvious thing.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked at me with a smile.\u201cWhy? Is there any problem?\u201dIs there a problem? I muttered my mouth and finally turned my head without saying anything. Well, on the surface, there\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s just me who\u2019s the one being uncomfortable.\u201cThen shall we go? Our table is over there.\u201d\u201cOh, no. Jayna guild hadn\u2019t come yet. Even if we go a little slower\u2026\u201dLet go of me, you bastard! Cheon Sa-yeon strode towards the table while pulling my shoulder and hugging me. I tried to give strength to my legs, but it was just dragging me along in a funny way.\u201c\u2026ah.\u201dHa Tae-heon and Lee Joo-ha, who were coming to the table just like us, made eye contact. Cheon Sa-yeon, who noticed that Lee Joo-ha\u2019s expression hardened slightly, greeted her with a soft voice.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Master Lee Joo-ha.\u201d\u201c\u2026that\u2019s right, Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dLee Joo-ha struggled to answer in a shaky voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Watch out for the partyCheon Sa-yeon turned his gaze to Ha Tae-heon, who was standing behind Lee Joo-ha.\u201cI\u2019m late to congratulate you. Did you become a deputy master?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHa Tae-heon looked at me while answering with a dry tone. When I met those cold black eyes, somehow my body stiffened.\u2018I feel\u2026 he doesn\u2019t look so happy.\u2019Is it because of meeting Cheon Sa-yeon? After leaving only the inconvenience of greeting, we were seated at the table.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSince the Jayna Guild and Blun Guild did not come, in the Seoul area, where only four were seated, there was no conversation compared to other tables, and only a suffocating silence continued.\u2018Uncomfortable\u2026\u2019For no reason, I broke out in a cold sweat, staring only at the vase in the centre of the table. Please someone say something. I slowly glanced at Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cUm?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was sitting leisurely spinning a glass of champagne, noticed my gaze and tilted his head slightly.What are you pretending not to know? Are you not uncomfortable? Do something about this atmosphere. At the hot gaze filled with will, Cheon Sa-yeon opened his mouth with a slight smile as if he knew it.\u201cNow that I think about it.\u201dHa Tae-heon and Lee Joo-ha, who were sitting with dreary faces, looked at Cheon Sa-yeon. Okay. Let\u2019s talk about the weather. There\u2019s something called a small talk. I breathed a sigh of relief and picked up the glass of champagne on the table.\u201cI didn\u2019t introduce you my partner. This is Talented Han Yi-gyeol. Say hello.\u201d\u201cCough\u2026!\u201dAt an unexpected topic of conversation, I choked on the champagne I was drinking and I coughed harshly. Ha Tae-heon and Lee Joo-ha, who were looking at Cheon Sa-yeon, turned to me at the same time.\u2018This bastard Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026\u2019With a sharp pain in the throat, I kept coughing. Cheon Sa-yeon lightly patted my croaking back and asked with a smiley voice.\u201cOh, no. Are you okay?\u201d\u201cCough, it\u2019s okay\u2026\u201dI barely answered and glared at Cheon Sa-yeon with all my might. It was obvious that he was having fun with this situation as he was covering his mouth with his clenched fist.\u201cYeah, I know. Han Yi-gyeol-ssi. Because you came as a mercenary.\u201dLee Joo-ha answered in a shaky voice.\u201cBesides that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard, you and\u00a0our\u00a0Yi-gyeol are acquaintances.\u201dAt Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words towards him, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyebrows twitched. I hurriedly intervened.\u201cTh, that. We met by chance before.\u201d\u201cBy chance?\u201d\u201cYes. By chance.\u201dI forced a smile and nodded my head.That\u2019s why Ha Tae-heon shouldn\u2019t have said that he knew me. Cheon Sa-yeon might know that I and Ha Tae-heon had only seen each other in the face of Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s kidnapping case, so it was difficult because there was no excuse to bring them other than this poor excuse.\u201cIs that right? Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDespite my desperate request for help, Ha Tae-heon just kept his mouth shut. Is it like this? For whom am I suffering this? The ship was heavier and cooler than before.\u201cAre we the last ones to come?\u201dAt that moment, a lively voice broke the silence. A gorgeous blonde woman wearing a white blouse was walking towards us with the sound of her heels.\u201cIf I had been a little late, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to come in. Hi, everyone!\u201dA woman with a bright smile waved her hand to Cheon Sa-yeon and Lee Joo-ha to greet them.\u201cMaster Hong Si-ah.\u201d\u201cLong time no see. Master Lee Joo-ha~\u201dHong Si-ah shook hands with Lee Joo-ha, pushing her blonde hair shining in the light behind her shoulder. I swallowed my dry saliva and looked at her carefully.\u2018This is the Jayna Guild Master Hong Si-ah.\u2019She was one of the S-class talented people who were well-received for her outstanding ability and sense.\u201cHello!\u201dThe person following Hong Si-ah gave a strong greeting. It was a cute-looking woman with her wavy short brown hair, slightly oversized glasses, and a beige shirt.If my prediction is correct, it would be Kim Na-yul, the deputy master of the Jayna Guild since she came in with Hong Si-ah. Kim Na-yul was a character who appeared several times in the original story.\u201cHa, Ha Tae-heon, the Deputy Master is also here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDespite Ha Tae-heon\u2019s short answer, Kim Na-yul was blushing her cheeks and bowing her head.Kim Na-yul has been in love with Ha Tae-heon since she happened to meet him by chance shortly after he woke up. She appeared more frequently than Min Ah-rin or Lee Joo-ha, at least as a character that stood out in the original work by showing a steady liking.\u201cDeputy Master Kim Na-yul, how have you been?\u201d\u201cHehe, yes. Master Lee Joo-ha, how have you been?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always the same, huh.\u201dPerhaps they knew each other, Kim Na-yul and Lee Joo-ha started chattering. I sighed in relief as I watched the peaceful atmosphere continue just like the other tables.\u201cBy the way, why did Master Cheon Sa-yeon come here? Besides, are you bringing your partner with you?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon responded with a sad expression to Hong Si-ah\u2019s words that she was surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s not a situation worth passing over, is it?\u201d\u201cIt must be, but the domestic gates weren\u2019t the only thing you were interested in because you were looking abroad?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m not irresponsible enough to care about leaving the gate alone.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Come to think of it, Requiem also took the new SS-grade gate that appeared a few months ago.\u201dThat\u2019s mean, so mean. Hong Si-ah, who said playfully, looked at me sitting next to Cheon Sa-yeon. There was interest in her amber eyes.\u201cOho. Are you Mercenary Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dAs expected, you know, too. I smiled as harmless as possible and bowed my head slightly.\u201cI thought you look familiar. Nice to meet you. My name is Hong Si-ah.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cI wanted to meet you once because rumours spread that you have SS-ranks in both hands. Come to think of it, there are all SS-ranks here, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI reflexively looked into Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes. Cheon Sa-yeon, I\u2019m sure you must already know those words\u2026\u201cMy partner is very popular.\u201dHowever, contrary to my expectations, unlike Ha Tae-heon, who did not raise an eyebrow, Cheon Sa-yeon opened his mouth.\u201cI asked you to come to the party with me for today so many times. I almost would have come alone.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon lowered the corners of his eyes and I was taken aback by what he said with a sad expression on his face.\u201cNo\u2026 wait a minute.\u201dWhat are you asking me to do? That\u2019s what we dealt with.\u201cWhat. Are you two really that close? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Master Cheon Sa-yeon doing this.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s such a special person.\u201d\u2026you really planned it today, didn\u2019t you?\u201cHa. Ha\u2026\u201dI laughed in vain and drank champagne for nothing. Let\u2019s just ignore it. I think that would be good for my mental health.\u201cHello, attendees. I am Choi Mi-jin, the Head of the Gate Management Centre at the Management Headquarters.\u201dChoi Mi-jin, who came up on the podium, held a microphone.\u201cAs the gate anomaly continues, the management headquarters has prepared this event to disclose some of the previously private information as a solution and come up with a new countermeasure for it.\u201dA huge beam screen descended behind Choi Mi-jin and a map appeared. It was an image showing the location of the gate by region.\u201cDue to the original regulations, there was a limit to the gate information that each region could share. But now we are trying to push that limit a little more.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me to reveal gate characteristics or clear tips that haven\u2019t been revealed between regions?\u201dA guild master in the Gyeonggi-do region asked with a frown. The reaction of others was not very good either.\u201cI understand the discomfort. However, in cases such as the United States, China, and Russia, they have already started managing all regional gates in this way.\u201d\u201cI know that, but those guys didn\u2019t get such good results too, right?\u201dThis time, a participant from Daegu intervened. As if Choi Mi-jin expected this situation, she calmly answered without any change in expression.\u201cAs long as the situation has changed, the future will be different if you try anything. Just because you don\u2019t like the change, you can\u2019t go back to sticking with the past method.\u201d\u201cNo, I know that. Shouldn\u2019t it be applied differently for each region? No matter how you look, our island, Jeju-do, is at a disadvantage. Where is it, places like Busan or Seoul are more relaxed.\u201d\u201cNo. Seoul is the same, but why is Busan stuck there? Even Daejeon or Incheon.\u201d\u201cWhat? Busan bastards have no conscience. I know for sure that there are dozens of newly discovered marine monsters at the gate in Gwangalli.\u201d\u201cIf you want, come to Busan. Who are these gangsters who collect items from other gates?\u201dAt the poignant remarks of the Busan participants, the Incheon participants jumped up from their seats with a reddened face. At that scene, Kwon Ji-hoon, who was at the same table, put on a puzzled expression.\u201cShit. Gangsters? Are you done talking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done, you bastard. Fuck you, jump on me.\u201dInstead of being embarrassed by the sudden fight, they all cheered with excitement.\u201cRight. Fight, fight!\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s kind of fun.\u201d\u201cAs those teenagers in Incheon and Busan say, they are sitting on a fictitious day. Can you show me your skills?\u201dAs if Choi Mi-jin knew this was going to happen, she sighed while touching her forehead. Participants in Busan and Incheon, who had a dispute, took out their weapons together. The heat that rose before the battle drifted inside the splendidly decorated party hall.\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d\u201cWell, there are people who are looking forward to it.\u201dHong Si-ah started watching with her chin pinched.\u00a0Kwarurung!\u00a0When the sword wrapped in grey smoke and the long rifle collided, the ground and the inside shook. From that point on, several participants used their abilities and swung their weapons, and broken tables and vases bounced here and there.\u201cAre you all going to sit still?\u201dI asked, wrapping the wind around us like a shield.\u00a0Crash! Thud!\u00a0Pieces of wood and glass flew away with all kinds of noise, but the wind blocked them all.\u201cI don\u2019t know why I have to leave my seat.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2026 Do you say those words when you see this mess?\u201dEveryone sitting at the table, including Cheon Sa-yeon, looked at me blankly with expressions they did not understand. These people really.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in such a dangerous place anymore.\u201d\u201cOh, no. So fussy.\u201d (\uc800\ub7f0. \uae4c\ud0c8\uc2a4\ub7fd\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc9c0, someone tell me how to make a pun please)Is it time for a pun?\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201dA chair filled with the energy of the talented flew through the wind. I hurriedly bowed my head to avoid it. The chair was shattered in the hands of Ha Tae-heon, who was sitting opposite.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to stay here, I will go out alone.\u201dI\u2019m going to see real blood at this rate. As I spoke while looking at the broken piece of chair, Cheon Sa-yeon raised an eyebrow and smiled.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cThen anything\u2026 Wait, why are you taking out the sword?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who tapped the watch, pulled out a sword from his inventory. It was an S-class sword, not Lilith\u2019s sword, but what are you going to do with it?\u201cWhy did you take it out?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon naturally placed his palm on the blade.\u201cCan\u2019t we just sort this out?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, wait! Don\u2019t do that!\u201dI was terrified and hung on Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arm, who was about to cut off his palm at any moment.T/N :Hung on Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arm\u2026 Aw~ So cute~ XD *slappedHow dense you are, Yi-gyeol\u2026 Tae-heon was jealous of Sa-yeon because you came as his partner\u2026 XD on other side, one of Tae-heon\u2019s harems appeared wwwwwPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t do it!\u201d\u201cWell, at least a hotel will be burned.\u201dIn the midst of arguing with Cheon Sa-yeon, a large table flew over this time.Crack!\u201cHuhung.\u201dHong Si-ah broke the table in half and stood up. When she took something out, she held a bright red snakeskin whip in her hand.\u201cDaegu guys keep throwing things at us, and if we ignore this again, we won\u2019t alive.\u201d\u201cMaster, come on and win!\u201dKim Na-yul clenched her fists and cheered for Hong Si-ah.\u00a0Crack!\u00a0The floor where Hong Si-ah\u2019s whip passed through froze and cracked deeply. A chill leaked out of the cracks.\u201cMaster Lee Joo-ha, what are you doing? Hurry up, take out your weapon!\u201d\u201cUh, me?\u201d\u201cYeah. Follow me quickly. Master must set an example!\u201dHong Si-ah forced Lee Joo-ha, who was sitting quietly, to drag her away. Lee Joo-ha, who got up suddenly, said hesitatingly.\u201cWa, wait. I\u2019m like this\u2026\u201dKwagwang!\u201cGasp.\u201dAt the same time, Cheon Sa-yeon grabbed my waist from behind and pulled me, our table split in half with a loud noise. A man with a huge sword exclaimed triumphantly.\u201cHaha, bring it on! You unlucky Seoulites!\u201d (Seoul Elites probably?)It seemed that that person was the main culprit for throwing chairs and tables from earlier. As I looked at him in shock, I heard a gloomy voice next to me.\u201cThat punk\u2026\u201dLee Joo-ha, who spit out abusive language with a cold face, pulled out two guns that were hidden in a suit jacket.Lee Joo-ha\u2019s ability was debuff infinite bullets. Lee Joo-ha, holding guns that were specially made for her own ability, ran towards the man and opened fire with her guns.Taang! Tang!Even though she was wearing formal pants, it was surprising that she could run around like that in heels that looked 10 centimetres tall.\u201cEveryone, stop fighting. We have called security personnel. Right now\u2026 Haa, there\u2019s no way you hear it.\u201dChoi Mi-jin, who was reciting the warning with her cold eyes, sighed and threw her microphone away. It was really such a mess. Now that there were a lot of crazy people, I understand Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words to stick around.\u201cHmm.\u201dWith the sword that Cheon Sa-yeon drew, he cut down various things that were flying. Participants from other regions continued to send provocative acts towards us as if they were not satisfied with Hong Si-ah and Lee Joo-ha.\u201cRequiem Master, did you hide because you were afraid?\u201d\u201cRoheon Deputy Master! Let\u2019s compete fairly!\u201dThey were all men with huge weapons. Cheon Sa-yeon pretended to not listen to their challenge, and Ha Tae-heon only drank champagne without replying. It was a complete disregard.\u201cReally, why are you doing that?\u201dKim Na-yul said, looking pitifully at the people who were arguing with Ha Tae-heon. Even so, I wanted to applaud her because she took advantage of the chaotic situation to sneakily approach Ha Tae-heon.\u201cIn this situation, will it be cleared up when the security personnel arrive?\u201d\u201cTo some extent, however. Gate issues are important, and we can\u2019t fight all day.\u201dIn short, it meant ending up with an excuse for security personnel. These people are really here to fight and have fun.\u201c\u2026do you have meetings like this often?\u201d\u201cAbout two or three times a year. It\u2019s been a while for people this much to gather.\u201dFinally, a huge statue built in the centre was cut in two by someone\u2019s ability. Rumbling, the sound of the statue collapsing shook the floor.Now, the inside of the party hall was crumbling and collapsed everywhere except around our table.As I looked around, I met Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes. Ha Tae-heon was staring at me without pretending to listen to Kim Na-yul, who was chattering next to him. It was like his eyes were looking at a bad student with bad behaviour. Why are you doing that?\u201c\u2026ah.\u201dI was awkward that I only rolled my eyes for no reason, but then I noticed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arm wrapped around my waist. It was the waist that had been caught earlier to dodge the attack. Is it because of this?\u201cHow long are you going to hold on to? Let go now.\u201d\u201cAha. I forgot.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon answered skillfully but did not let go of my waist. This punk.\u201cLet it go.\u201dThen his arm released me. I tapped the slightly crumpled jacket and gave Ha Tae-heon an explanation-filled look. I\u2019m not a person who\u2019s close to Cheon Sa-yeon. You see? Don\u2019t misunderstand.Ha Tae-heon stopped staring and looked away to see if my heart worked. Thank God.\u201cDeputy Master!\u201dHong Si-ah, who was running around with a whip among the attendees, called out to Kim Na-yul.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPlease give me the item I entrusted to you earlier!\u201dKim Na-yul took out the necklace that was hidden behind her shirt. Leopard-skin gloves protrude from a baroque necklace with an amber gem in the centre.\u201cI\u2019ll be back after handing this over.\u201dKim Na-yul, holding the leather gloves with both hands, walked and ran into the battlefield. I wondered if she could go to Hong Si-ah in that mess, but seeing her dodging the flying attack seemed to be a useless worry.As expected, S-rank is S-rank. While watching Kim Na-yul, who lightly evaded the attacks of those who rushed, with a curious mind, I saw a man I had once seen among the tangled crowd.\u2018Who was that?\u2019The man, who was half-hiding his body at the entrance to the terrace and watching the party hall, looked bad from a distance. Where did I see him? After thinking for a while, I realized later.\u201cMaster Kang Seung-geon?\u201d\u201cUm?\u201dI was wondering who he was. Did you still attend the party because you are a master? But why didn\u2019t you come to the table and was just hiding there?As I tilted my head at the incomprehensible behaviour, Kang Seung-geon pulled something out of his arms with a pale face.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOver there, Master Kang Seung-geon\u2026\u201dWhile I turned my gaze to Cheon Sa-yeon for a moment, Kang Seung-geon disappeared in an instant.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t see him.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who had lost his smile, looked at the place where Kang Seung-geon had just been, with a sharp gaze.\u201cObviously I saw\u2026\u201dKugugugung!That was then. Before the answer was even finished, the surroundings began to shake violently with a roar. I barely managed to balance my body and looked around.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cSomeone has this kind of ability\u2026!\u201d\u201cGet away from me!\u201dThe chandelier, which was hanging from the ceiling, fell and a sharp rupture sound echoed in my ears. The floor shook as if a strong earthquake had occurred, and a strange sensation soared.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201dFeeling upset, I covered my mouth and vomited in vain, Cheon Sa-yeon grabbed my shoulder and checked my condition. A mere shaking wouldn\u2019t have made me feel this nauseous.In the midst of this, the earthquake was getting worse and worse, and now the walls of the hotel were clasped unsteadily as if the hotel itself was about to collapse.\u201cDamn it. Who is this? A bastard with an item!\u201d\u201cFirst, stop the building from collapsing!\u201d\u201cWait, the floor\u2026!\u201dA strange light flickered through the cracks in the floor, which were tossed out by the participants. Like the Milky Way, black and dark blue were mixed randomly. It was like a gate with an open mouth.\u201cMaybe this.\u201dKugugung!\u00a0The floor quickly collapsed, and the light gradually increased. The participants, who could not step on the floor, fell into the light, grabbing their weapons.\u201cNow this, maybe the gate\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, use your ability first.\u201dHuung, as soon as I quickly rose at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words, the floor collapsed. After that, a shimmering dark blue light appeared to be large.\u2018Crazy\u2026!\u2019An unknown force pulled the body that was about to rise. Going to fall. When I thought it was dangerous, I hurriedly reached out to Ha Tae-heon.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi!\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s black eyes, whose hair was slightly disturbed by the wind, turned towards me. At the same time, I grabbed his hand, my body was drawn into the light and my vision was eaten by darkness.* * *\u201c\u2026Yi-gyeol. Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI felt a hand tapping the cheek. Through the hazy consciousness, I remembered what had happened at the party.\u201c\u2026what the.\u201d\u201cYou woke up.\u201dWhen I opened my eyes, I saw Cheon Sa-yeon with slightly dishevelled hair. I quickly rose my upper body.\u201cHere\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems we have entered the gate.\u201dInside the gate?\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cIf it is done by a high-ranking spatial ability, it is possible.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 everyone at the party came through this gate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI looked around. Dense trees covering the soil floor and sky, faint chirping of insects and birds. Is it in the middle of the forest? Just in case, I asked Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cWhat about Ha Tae-heon?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to take a look around.\u201d\u201cAre there any others?\u201d\u201cNot around here.\u201dAre you saying that only the three of us fell here?\u2018Wait. Three of us?\u2019Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon. And then me? Goosebumps, I was horrified.I opened my mouth, just in case.\u201c\u2026when I passed out, the two of you didn\u2019t fight or something like that, right?\u201dPerhaps it wasn\u2019t a very interesting question, Cheon Sa-yeon smiled grinningly.\u201cIf I had known you had such expectations, I would have woken you up after a fight.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I was just asking.\u201dI\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t fight. I got up and brushed off the dirt on my pants, but Ha Tae-heon, who had gone out to reconnaissance, came back.\u201cYou woke up.\u201d\u201cYes. Ha Tae-heon-ssi, are you hurt?\u201dHe silently nodded at my question.Ha Tae-heon seemed frustrated, so he took off his tie and unbuttoned a couple of shirt buttons. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was standing with his arms crossed looking at me and Ha Tae-heon, intervened with a smiley voice.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask me if I was hurt.\u201d\u201cYou look fine just by looking at you.\u201d\u201cI doubted that we had a fight, let alone worried. The treatment is so different.\u201d\u201c\u2026all right, I got it.\u201dI couldn\u2019t really say anything. Cheon Sa-yeon was going to die of fun at my reaction that I was annoyed.Ha Tae-heon, who was looking at me and Cheon Sa-yeon pitifully, opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s move. We\u2019ll have to check the status of the attendees somewhere in the gate.\u201d\u201cUm, but\u2026\u201dI said, touching the nape of my neck.\u201cI have no idea where to go.\u201dThere were only trees and bushes all around. It was not easy to move in haste as we did not know what kind of gate it was or where the road was.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled brightly at me, pointing upwards.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cGo up and check it out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was speechless for a moment at that natural attitude. It\u2019s not like telling the dog to \u2018Ask me!\u2019.

(Again, not sure)\u201cI\u2019ll be back after watching.\u201dPasasak, through the lush leaves, I floated upward. A wide forest spread beneath my feet, and I saw something at the end.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dI squinted my eyes at the unfamiliar building. What is that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As I rolled my eyes, the eyes of Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon flocked to me.\u201cTherefore?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit unusual to have a building like that. It looks like a castle from a fairy tale.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fairy tale castle.\u201dAs if he understood my words at once, Cheon Sa-yeon nodded his head.\u201cYou must be referring to a building like the\u00a0Alcazar Castle\u00a0in Segovia, Spain.\u201d\u201cSegovia Spain\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cThe Alcazar Castle in Segovia. One of the famous buildings that inspired many fairy tales.\u201dListening again, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Ha Tae-heon answered on behalf of me, who was disappointing.\u201cAs far as I know, there is no gate where such a structure has been found in Korea.\u201d\u201cNot even in my memory. In the worst case, we should also consider overseas gates. We\u2019d better go to the north first.\u201dI was mesmerized for a moment looking at Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon talking.\u2018What. Are you talking to each other normally?\u2019I thought you\u2019d be more ignorant or sarcastic. Well, that wasn\u2019t the case. Park Geon-ho and Woo Seo-hyuk, who had a bad relationship, also cooperate with each other to some extent inside the gate. These two would have a similar mind.I relieved myself and said to the two of them.\u201cEveryone flies with my ability. Because it\u2019s faster.\u201dAt that moment, Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s black eyes looked at me at the same time. I reflexively stumbled backwards in those intense eyes, but Ha Tae-heon wrapped his arms around my waist first.\u201cCertainly, that would be nice.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI looked at Ha Tae-heon, who was approaching, in surprise. This was the first time Ha Tae-heon had hugged my waist in a situation that was not in battle. I covered my mouth with my hand and suppressed my joy. However, it was not easy to block the corners of the lips that kept rising.\u2018Is it safe\u2026 to say that we\u2019re a little closer, now?\u2019My heart was beating a little faster as if I had received a surprise gift. I was coughing and trying to use my ability, but this time my shoulders and neck were wrapped around by one arm from behind.\u201c\u2026what is it?\u201d\u201cYou must be more familiar with this one arm than that one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, standing behind me, looked down at me and smiled gently. Ha Tae-heon narrowed his brow as if dissatisfied.\u201cUm.\u201dIt was unwantedly surrounded back and forth. With such a strange posture, I think I\u2019m going to drop one person while flying.\u201cThis posture\u2026\u201d\u201cI caught it first.\u201dBefore I could even finish my words, Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth in a low voice.\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019ve given a lot. Because Yi-gyeol likes to be held in the arms.\u201dEven Cheon Sa-yeon responded with a smile. What are these guys doing now?\u201cBoth of you, stop.\u201dWhy is the conversation like this? I pushed Ha Tae-heon, who had a cold expression, and Cheon Sa-yeon, who was smiling but had a hard voice.\u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t use my abilities in this position, so we will fall later. Just holding hands is enough.\u201d\u201cHmm. How about going separately without physical contact?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little\u2026 I have to share my strength, but if I lose concentration, it\u2019s dangerous to keep moving. Two is fine, but three is difficult.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to split in two, it\u2019s not bad. You just need to float Ha Tae-heon in the state of being held by me.\u201dI was about to nod my head involuntarily at the very natural suggestion, but I managed to come to my senses. This punk really.\u201cNo, can the three of us just hold hands and go?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to hug you comfortably?\u201d\u201cNot good.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who looked at me quietly for a while, spoke up.\u201cI\u2019ll carry you on my back if you want.\u201d\u201c\u2026what\u2019s different from the suggestion of the Master Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201dHa Tae-heon, are you like this too? I sighed and said firmly.\u201cIf you keep doing this, I\u2019ll go alone. Either hold hands or run together. Do one of the two.\u201d\u201cSo cold-hearted.\u201d (\ub9e4\uc815\ud558\uae34)\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I pulled out the attached body and held out my hand, both of them were dissatisfied, but they gently held my hand. Cheon Sa-yeon took the left, and Ha Tae-heon took the right. Still, it seemed like both of them didn\u2019t want to run.Thinking that time was wasted on useless things, I used my ability without delay and jumped up.* * *As we headed north across the forest, the castle we found earlier appeared. Coming down in front of the huge gate, I looked up.\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than I thought.\u201dAn interior building with high walls and a long pointed roof to prevent enemy invasion. It was literally the royal castle itself that we saw only in fairy tales.As I looked around with a bit of a strange feeling, I realized that the castle gate was open. Ha Tae-heon frowned at the gate, which was slightly open enough for one person to pass by.\u201cSomeone has entered.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go in, too.\u201dAs I got closer to the gate, I pushed the gate just in case. It was easily pushed aside for its size. If I pushed it away, it meant that any party attendee could open this door and enter.\u201cThere may be other attendees who came here besides us.\u201d\u201cThe inside of the gate didn\u2019t look very spacious, so definitely it is.\u201dI nodded at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words. Looking at it from above, there was nothing special about it except here. Others, like us, who had fallen into the forest, were likely to gather in the castle.Passing through the gates and going inside, a large garden was revealed. The bushes were not managed, so they came up to the knees, and the fountain built in the centre was broken and dirty, giving off an old-fashioned atmosphere.Crunch. Crunch.As we moved forward, clearing the overgrown bushes and leaves, we found the entrance to the castle carved with a pattern. It was a unique pattern with a circle engraved in the centre of the triangle.I frowned and lamented.\u201cEvery time I found a pattern like this, I never liked it\u2026\u201d\u201cThe more gates the abnormal phenomenon occurred, the more often the patterns were found.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is the gate.\u201d\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of monsters will come out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re looking forward to everything.\u201dCome to think of it, I also found this pattern at the gate of the N23 Area, where I found the phenomenon of dropping grade monsters.A skull with an open mouth and black smoke wrapped around it. To my question of whether there had been before, Park Geon-ho replied that it was the first time he had seen it.\u2018After discovering the pattern, a monster that absorbed energy that I had never seen before appeared.\u2019Could the pattern found at each gate where the abnormal phenomenon appeared to be any hint?As I stared at the pattern with a serious expression, Cheon Sa-yeon lightly tapped the pattern a couple of times as if I would come to my senses.\u201cI understand your heart, but for now, there is only one way to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026as expected, that\u2019s true.\u201dI sighed and pushed the door engraved on it with all my might.\u00a0Kugugung, the tree vines that were half covering the door fell, revealing the inside of the castle.\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly clean.\u201dI thought the inside would be messy because the garden was so unmaintained, but the spacious hall that appeared was clean as if someone had cleaned it. We walked to the innermost part of the hall and found a staircase going up and a staircase going down to the underground.Cheon Sa-yeon, who tapped the pile of stones on the stairs with his sword, turned to me.\u201cThe way up is blocked.\u201d\u201cWe should go downstairs first.\u201dIn answer to that, I looked down at the stairs going down. It wasn\u2019t dangerously dark, but it seemed necessary to light up the surroundings just in case.\u201cI wish I had something like a torch\u2026\u201d\u201cI have my ability.\u201d\u201cDo you want to burn yourself?\u201dIt was too sticky and hot to use for lighting purposes. I carefully looked at the centre of the hole again, pushing out Cheon Sa-yeon, who was talking nonsense while blocking the back. Fortunately, there was an old table in the corner.Crack!I broke the table without hesitation with my ability, so I grabbed a table leg that could be held with one hand. Raising the table legs and staring at Ha Tae-heon, he sighed and pulled out a lighter from his pocket. As expected, it was easy to pretend.Just like we did at the D8 Area gate, we lighted the table legs and whipped it around in the wind to create a usable torch.\u201cShall we go?\u201dWhile holding a torch, I took the lead to the way down. I could feel the humid air and the smell of dusty stones like the underground. The sound of dripping water resounded from somewhere.After going down for a while, I was able to arrive at a large underground space. Between the wall that was redder than the first floor and the black moss growing in the crevice, traces that were presumed to be footprints were visible.\u201cIf you see the footprints, it means someone has come or a monster appears\u2026 It\u2019s strange that we didn\u2019t meet anything, considering we\u2019ve come down deeply.\u201dIf it was a normal gate, even if a monster appeared, it would have to appear earlier. Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth as if he had the same thoughts as me.\u201cA gate that has just been cleared or a gate that has not been built properly. It seems to be one of the two.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about an out-of-grade gate (\ub4f1\uae09 \uc678 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8, out-of-grade or off-grade gate)?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked around the basement with an interesting expression on his face.Out-of-grade gate. It was the gate that appeared in the novel. It was an empty gate where no monsters appeared and had not yet been discovered in Korea.\u201cIn the United States, research is in full swing to remodelling out-of-grade gates for the training of talented people.\u201d\u201cFor training of talented people?\u201d\u201cEven if the inside of the gate is broken or collapsed, it will be restored to its original shape after a certain period of time. There are no monsters in gates other than grades, so there will be more possibilities to use them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not bad.\u201dIn Korea, where there were no gates other than the grade ones, the lowest grade gates, such as C or D grades, were used for training of attackers who had just awakened. It would be nice if there was an out-of-grade gate in Korea as well.If you think about it simply, you might think that training was rather necessary, so you didn\u2019t need monsters, but there would be many kinds of training. It would be of great help to many talented people if there were more places to train due to the out-of-grade gate rose.\u201cThen is this an out-of-grade gate?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon answered my question with a light shrug.\u201cYou will find out if you watch more.\u201dWe walked for quite a long time, about the same time we came down the stairs. The underground space, which I thought was a room, turned out to be a wide hallway, and there was no other way but the front.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dFiery. (\ud654\ub974\ub975)When I found something, I stretched out my arm and lit a torch in front of me. I didn\u2019t see it wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s a crossroads.\u201dAs we reached the end of the hallway, a two-way path appeared. Left and right. A door that looked perfectly identical from the outside stood in the way.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dOur choices were also divided into two. Would the three of us move like now, or would we be apart in two?Cheon Sa-yeon, who had moved his fingers with his arms crossed, turned to Ha Tae-heon and opened his mouth.\u201cI think it would be better to split up here.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dHa Tae-heon replied calmly.\u201cGreat. Then, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cChoose.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When I looked at Cheon Sa-yeon at the sudden words, he smiled while pointing his fingers at himself and Ha Tae-heon alternately.\u201cYou have to choose someone to go with.\u201d\u201c\u2026why do I choose it?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let you, who is an A-rank, go alone. Of course, even if the grades were excluded, Ha Tae-heon wouldn\u2019t want to go with me, would he?\u201dLooking back on Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words, I put on an expression that asked why he was saying something so natural.\u201cNo, I understand that, but I don\u2019t even have to choose. I don\u2019t care who I go with.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who lowered his eyebrows slightly as if disappointing, then pointed his sword at Ha Tae-heon.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol doesn\u2019t choose, so we\u2019ll have to make a decision between us, Ha Tae-heon.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dI was confused by the absurd conclusion, Ha Tae-heon grabbed the sword he had made with his ability as he wished, rather than refused.What are these crazy people trying to do?\u201cReally, why are you two like this? Why are you fighting in this situation, damn it!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the two of us fighting, then pick one.\u201d\u201cCan we just not fight\u2026\u201dI was tired and rubbed my forehead. Cheon Sa-yeon, Ha Tae-heon, and strangely similar people stuck together, so I was the only one having a hard time.I was stupid to think that the two of them could talk normally. Now that I saw it, these children were full of will to fight whenever the opportunity arose.Ha Tae-heon, who would normally consider the situation rationally, strangely changed emotionally when Cheon Sa-yeon was involved.There was a tingling energy between Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon, who were staring at each other. Guess these guys were serious. After observing the situation and keeping an eye on it, I finally gave up.\u201cAll right. I will choose.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon smiled as if he had drawn my decision. I don\u2019t know why the hell you like it.\u2018How did I end up in this situation?\u2019Rather than choosing between Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon, I pondered looking at the left and right doors at the end of the hallway.\u201cI\u2026\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, I spoke.\u201cI will go to the right with Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dAs if my choice was unexpected, Ha Tae-heon looked at me. On the other hand, Cheon Sa-yeon responded that he knew it would like that way.\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Cheon Sa-yeon opened his mouth.\u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me. I guess I\u2019m the only one who has good memories of our past together.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say nonsense.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon would have known my choice from the beginning. My relationship with Cheon Sa-yeon was a cooperative relationship anyway, so it was better to separate than to go to the same place. This way would increase the amount of information you could obtain.The smiling Cheon Sa-yeon pointed to the door on the left, curling the corners of his eyes.\u201cThen let me go down this way alone.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very lonely and lonesome, but I can\u2019t help it\u2026\u201d (\uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \uc678\ub86d\uace0 \uc4f8\uc4f8\ud558\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc)\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t chosen\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it.\u201dI sighed covering my eyes. This was the reason I was worried until the end. If it was Cheon Sa-yeon, it was obvious that he would make fun of me from the moment he wasn\u2019t chosen.Cheon Sa-yeon brought up the main point, whether he made fun of me enough to be satisfied.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen beyond the door, so we\u2019d better set some rules and go.\u201dSince electronic devices couldn\u2019t be used inside the gate, there was no way to contact if we were scattered. Realizing the meaning, I nodded.\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s better like that.\u201d\u201cWhen we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll meet again at this crossroads. In case of danger, you have to step back.\u201d\u201cAll right. Don\u2019t overdo it either.\u201dEven if it was Cheon Sa-yeon, it was a bit worrying to walk around the inside of the gate for the first time. At my words, Cheon Sa-yeon slowly blinked his eyes.\u201cIf you\u2019re that worried, come with me.\u201dI\u2019m being serious, but this guy\u2026\u201cYou go first.\u201dI politely pointed to the door on the left with the meaning of asking him to leave. Cheon Sa-yeon, who laughed out loud as if my reaction was funny, entered the door on the left.\u201cUm, shall we go too?\u201dAs soon as Cheon Sa-yeon, who spoke nonsense when he opened his mouth, disappeared, silence fell like a ghost. I beckoned Ha Tae-heon to the door on the right with a bit of awkwardness.As we entered, the surroundings became a little darker. Ha Tae-heon and I walked down the hallway without talking.Earlier, when Ha Tae-heon first hugged my waist, I thought that he might have become a little closer, but when the two of us were left, an indescribable awkwardness came. I guess it must have been an illusion.\u201cThat\u2026 Ha Tae-heon-ssi. I\u2026\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s party.\u201dI couldn\u2019t stand the silence and hesitantly opened my mouth, but Ha Tae-heon interrupted me and asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you would come. Also, as a partner of the Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dMaybe it was because his tone was harder than usual, somehow I felt like I was being scolded. Indeed. It was a situation where the guy who was going to be helped by himself showed up at the party arm in arm with his rival. It seemed like it would make me feel bad, too.\u201cI have some circumstances.\u201dSince I couldn\u2019t tell Ha Tae-heon about Kim Woo-jin, who is a member of Requiem, I stuttered a bit. Most of all, I didn\u2019t want to disclose the details of the transaction with Cheon Sa-yeon to anyone.Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes became sharp at once, probably because of my insincere reply.\u201cIs there any other reason you attended the party?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect what happened this time, did you?\u201dWhat\u2026 I frowned.\u201cIf I had expected it, would it have happened like this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Because you don\u2019t even blink an eye to deceive others.\u201dAll of a sudden, Ha Tae-heon was approaching my nose. I faced him without avoiding the cold stare.\u201cI know that Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0doesn\u2019t trust me, but I don\u2019t do such useless things.\u201d\u201cIs it useless things?\u201d\u201cWhat am I going to gain from this job? Don\u2019t make weird assumptions.\u201dWhen I spoke with irritation, Ha Tae-heon twisted the tip of his lips.\u201cIf you are upset, please explain it properly. What was the reason for you, who wanted to escape, attending the party with Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201dHa Tae-heon didn\u2019t know that I was on the move to uncover the gate anomaly. Even being independent would look weird. After hesitating for a while, I barely opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026what does Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0have to do with it?\u201dHa Tae-heon looked at me with a smirk as if to see it. I actually wanted to ask about it.\u201cI understand that I\u2019m suspicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I tell you the truth, are you willing to believe it?\u201dSomehow it sounded like a hurtful word to me, not to Ha Tae-heon.\u201cNo. Why should I explain it to someone who won\u2019t believe me even if I explain it anyway?\u201d\u201cThen.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was quietly listening to me, opened his mouth in a low voice.\u201cIf I believe it, will you tell me?\u201dContrary to the question of unknown intent, his eyes looking at me were extremely plain.\u201cAnswer me, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you going to tell me?\u201d\u201c\u2026I hate to say it without the assurance that you will believe it.\u201dIn the end, it was a step back. Looking at it like this, I and Ha Tae-heon had a lot of similarities. The past life made it difficult to trust others.Ha Tae-heon stared at me without answering. I was nervous about how he would react, but he slowly raised his gaze and looked behind me.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi?\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u201dHa Tae-heon looked carefully at the front of the hallway filled with darkness. I immediately noticed what he was doing.\u201cDo you hear anything?\u201dAs an A-rank, I couldn\u2019t hear anything, but as an SS-rank, he seemed to have sensed something. Ha Tae-heon nodded his head at my question.\u201cMonster?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. They\u2019re probably fighting.\u201dIf they were in battle, are you saying that there are people as well as monsters? It could be a dangerous situation. I threw away the torch and spoke closely to Ha Tae-heon.\u201cLet\u2019s go right away.\u201dEven without explanation, Ha Tae-heon, who understood the meaning of my words, hugged me. Surrounding Ha Tae-heon in the wind, I sped up and flew across the hallway.Kuuung!As we got closer to the end of the hallway, the ground shook slightly with the sound of something breaking.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, here\u2026\u201dI widened my eyes at the scenery that spread out across the hallway. I could see a forest full of coniferous trees on the soil floor, which I couldn\u2019t even think of as being underground. Unlike the hallway, this place was bright white, but the purple powder was flying in the air and there was a thick fog.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dAt that moment, I felt a sharp pain as if my skin had been pierced by a needle. It seemed that the flying powder was one of the monster\u2019s abilities.As I bit my lip and held back my groans, Ha Tae-heon took an SS-class coat from his inventory and put it over my shoulder.\u2018I asked Ha Tae-heon to wear it, but why am I wearing more?\u2019I thanked him for the coat and put it on then looked straight ahead. A huge humanoid monster was looking down at us.A round black head like a burnt match and long arms with only a skeleton left. Its lower body had opaque tentacles stuck to the ground like jellyfish and in its hand was a multi-pointed sword.Among them, the one that caught my eyes the most was the circular mirror behind the monster. The mirror was floating in the air, shining as white as the sun.\u201cWhat. Deputy Master Ha Tae-heon?\u201d (In the raw, it wrote only \u201cMaster\u201d, not Deputy Master, so I edited it)Through the fog and poison powder that obscured the view, Hong Si-ah appeared. Maybe she had a fight with the monster in front of her, her breathing was a bit rough.When she found Ha Tae-heon and me, she opened her eyes and smiled.\u201cAre you even Talented Han Yi-gyeol? Looks like you both just arrived?\u201d\u201cYes. Is there anyone else?\u201dWhen I came out of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arms and asked, Hong Si-ah said with a frown.\u201cNo, I was with Master Lee Joo-ha\u2026 Actually, the situation is not good right now.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dHa Tae-heon came forward after hearing that Lee Joo-ha was there.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the monster\u2019s abilities. Black holes appear randomly on the floor, and when you step on them, they disappear in an instant. It seems to be a simple ability to move through space, given that there is no dangerous energy.\u201d\u201cDo you not know where it has been moved?\u201dHong Si-ah brushed away her messy bangs and answered.\u201cI ran around the room as much as I could and looked around and saw a staircase going down behind the monster. That seems to be the most likely place.\u201d\u201cMaster Lee Joo-ha as well as other party attendees must be there.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dI looked at the dimly visible monster through the fog. A familiar feeling of fear that numbed your fingertips. It was definitely an S+ grade.\u201cBut it\u2019s just the two of you? Did you not see anyone else when you came?\u201d\u201cThere was also Master Cheon Sa-yeon. We split the team at crossroads.\u201d\u201cAh, there. I saw it as well. So now the three of us have to deal with that monster, right?\u201dHong Si-ah grabbed her leather whip with strength and grinned. It was a beautiful smile that was captivating, but the bloody whip in her hand was quite vicious.I nodded calmly. That monster was an S+ grade. The combination of S-rank Hong Si-ah and SS-rank Ha Tae-heon was enough to catch it.T/N :OMG Sa-yeon! Let me accompany you instead! XDI reread almost 5th times and always grin like an idiot every time Sa-yeon act \u201cso cutely\u201d like that wwwwwBut hmm, yeah, the problem between Yi-gyeol and Tae-heon is trust issue. Yi-gyeol believe him more than Tae-heon to him because Tae-heon is \u201cthe protagonist\u201d he knows, however, who is Yi-gyeol to him? Someone who accepted the order to kidnap the innocent people? Someone who wants to be rescued by him? Someone who acts as innocent guy but becomes loyal dog to Sa-yeon behind his back? Hm hm hm\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the biggest monster I\u2019ve ever met. Looking at it this way, it looked like it was about 10 stories taller than an apartment building.Huuuu\u2026 huu\u2026 hiiik\u2026The sound of breathing hard as if his throat was being squeezed resounded. The bizarre breathing sounded and S+-grade energy aroused fear.\u201cFirst of all, I need one person to attract the attention of a monster\u2026 Who will do it?\u201d\u201cI will do it.\u201dAt Hong Si-ah\u2019s words, Ha Tae-heon stepped forward. She nodded her head and moved her gaze to me.\u201cGreat. Then, Talented Han Yi-gyeol. After watching the video, you were able to use the wind ability a little bit here and there. Can you do it now?\u201d\u201cYes. But you have to be careful. From two people, I can\u2019t control it specifically.\u201d\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not going to be that easy.\u201dHong Si-ah, who was about to battle, smiled brightly as if she was in a very good mood.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m playing against an S+ grade opponent. Deputy Master Ha Tae-heon, will you deal with it in moderation and hand it over to me? Let\u2019s see what level it is.\u201dHa Tae-heon just nodded his head without answering with his sullen face.I hid behind a tree in moderation and used my ability on both of them.\u00a0Huung, pure white smoke was scattered by the wind. Ha Tae-heon, who floated into the air, flew first while holding his sword.When Ha Tae-heon came into view, the monster only showed movement.\u00a0Suuu, it moved its neck with the sound of rough breathing.Something appeared behind the mirror that was emitting a pure white light. Long and sharp like thorns, it quickly grew into dozens.\u201cBe careful!\u201dAt the same time as I hastily twisted the wind flow, Ha Tae-heon used his ability to create a huge shield blocking the way.Kiiing!Dozens of spears of light flew toward Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah with a sharp noise that pierced the ears.\u00a0Kuuung, the ground shook with an explosion sound as the monster\u2019s attack, which was slowed by shaking in the wind, hit the shield.After confirming that all the spears had disappeared, Ha Tae-heon removed the shield and flew towards the monster and swung his sword. A sword swung at high speed accurately cut through the monster\u2019s neck, which was still floating.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dHa Tae-heon frowned and quickly stepped back. Even though it was clearly cut, its blood did not splatter or scream was heard.Kuruk, kururuk\u2026With the sound of boiling sputum, the cut flesh was boiling and being restored to its original state.\u201cMaybe the ability to regenerate?\u201dHong Si-ah\u2019s words hardened my expression. There were monsters with the ability to regenerate, but there was no case where they regenerated so quickly.\u2018\u2026wait. A similar situation seems to have occurred in the novel.\u2019Suddenly, the contents of the original flashed through my mind.I calmly organized my memories. When Ha Tae-heon entered the American gate, it was similar to the monster he met. A shamanistic (\uc8fc\uc220\uacc4) S-grade monster that looked similar to a banshee.\u2018How did you solve that problem?\u2019While I was in agony, Hong Si-ah joined in and swung her weapon at the monster. However, Hong Si-ah\u2019s whip penetrated its heart and blew off one of its arms, the monster did not budge. We couldn\u2019t kill it like this.I have to remember. While desperately digging through everything in my head, I finally came up with an important clue.\u201cMirror.\u201dYes. It was a mirror. I looked at the mirror floating above the monster\u2019s head.\u201cIt\u2019s not regenerative.\u201dThat was a hallucination. Convinced, I exclaimed in haste.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi! The mirror!\u201dIt was quite a distance, but my voice would reach him who was an SS-rank. As expected, Ha Tae-heon turned his head and looked at me.The monster in the novel had a mirror embedded in its chest. Ha Tae-heon inserted his sword in the mirror, ending the hallucinations that had confused everyone.\u201cAttack the mirror!\u201dJust like that monster, it was just a hallucination, not a regenerative ability. When you broke the mirror, something would definitely change.I lifted Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body higher to make it easier to attack the mirror. When Ha Tae-heon, who immediately understood what I was saying, was about to swing his sword towards the mirror, the monster that had been standing still made a ripping sound.Kkiiiii\u2014!\u201cArgh!\u201dI twisted in pain as if I was stabbed in the ear with an awl. Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah, who were close, were also greatly shaken as they were hit.\u201cAh, crazy. What the\u2026 ugh!\u201dThe monster swung its sword at tremendous speed toward Hong Si-ah, who was holding her forehead. Hong Si-ah managed to avoid it and raised the corners of her lips.\u201cNow it\u2019s fun to fight! Did you say something that shouldn\u2019t be touched is the mirror as Han Yi-gyeol said?\u201dA sword the size of a house flew in once again aiming at Hong Si-ah. Unlike just now, Hong Si-ah, who escaped with ease, used a bright red whip to wrap around the monster\u2019s sword. As if a snake wound up its prey to death, the sword which was wrapped with the whip gradually froze and then cracked.While Hong Si-ah was facing the monster, Ha Tae-heon once again moved toward the mirror.When the tip of the sword was lowered and inserted into the mirror, a sharp rupture resounded loudly. And at the same time.Kwaaang!The mirror exploded with a strong shock wave.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dI was about to run reflexively as I watched Ha Tae-heon, who had crossed his arms and covered his face, swung backwards, but I was also caught up in an explosion and my body flew backwards. I quickly raised my ability.\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201dKuung, at the same time as the heavy sound, I felt a dull pain in my back. Fortunately, I was protected by the wind so I wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. As I staggered and raised my upper body, I gazed at the sight in front of me that had changed dramatically.The sky, which had been filled with white light, disappeared out of nowhere, and dark purple clouds spread out. All the coniferous trees near the monster where the explosion occurred fell down then a black haze fluttered on the soil floor.Kiiiik\u2014!The monster screamed and twisted its body. Soon after, the face part split into four parts and opened like petals, and a terrible stench spread through the air. I covered my mouth with the sleeve of the coat and looked around quickly.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cTsk\u2026\u201dFortunately, Ha Tae-heon got up from not far away. He clicked his tongue angrily and wiped the dirt off his suit.\u201cAu. It\u2019s a mess like this.\u201dSimilar to Ha Tae-heon, Hong Si-ah, who was covered in ash, walked out from behind. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t appear to have been hurt either.\u201cMaybe the mirror was the core. I didn\u2019t even think of that because the first attack came from the mirror.\u201dHong Si-ah, who was grumbling, grabbed her whip and looked at the monster.\u201cI broke the mirror, so the hallucinations are gone now?\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to check it out.\u201dHa Tae-heon made a sword with his ability and blinked at me. Noticing the gaze, I lifted Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah again and stepped back.\u201cBe careful of poison.\u201dHuung, Hong Si-ah, who flew up, looked at me and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ve felt it for a while, this ability is really good.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s useful, please call my mercenary service whenever you want.\u201dI thought this was the time, so I tried to do business. Fortunately, Hong Si-ah giggled and flew to the monster after Ha Tae-heon, who was fortunate enough to have passed through cute\u00a0aegyo. (\ub2e4\ud589\ud788 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4 \uc560\uad50 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud588\ub294\uc9c0\ud64d\uc2dc\uc544\uac00 \ud0a5\ud0a5\uac70\ub9ac\uba70 \ud558\ud0dc\ud5cc\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ubaac\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0\uac8c \ub0a0\uc544\uac14\ub2e4, I thought Yi-gyeol did cute\u00a0aegyo\u00a0act to Tae-heon but failed to get his attention?)As Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah approached, the monster trembled and spit out a stench with black smoke through its split head, unlike before when there was no particular movement.\u2018What the hell is that?\u2019I thought without removing the sleeve that was covering my mouth just in case. I thought it was poison, but unlike the purple powder before, I didn\u2019t feel any pain.\u2026maybe it was a debuff ability, not poison. The debuff ability was a tricky ability that could reduce the power of the ability or cause body paralysis when exposed to defencelessness.Kkiiiik!Kururung, kwang!As the monster howled with a creepy sound, white thunderbolts began to fall several times from the sky full of dark clouds. Ha Tae-heon lightly dodged the monster\u2019s attack and narrowed the distance.Haaaak!When the lightning-shaped monster\u2019s sword and Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sword were about to collide, a bright red whip wrapped around the monster\u2019s sword. The monster\u2019s sword, which had a crack in the centre, could not withstand this attack and was broken.Ha Tae-heon quickly entered the gap created by Hong Si-ah.\u00a0Huuk, as the sword swung long, the monster\u2019s right wrist was cut off.Kuung!While holding a sword that had been cut in half, its severed wrist fell to the floor. Black blood poured from the cutting surface, and the monster staggered.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dHong Si-ah covered her mouth and her nose with her hand and hurriedly backed away from it. The stench emanating from its chapped face spread far more intensely from the black blood. With the ability of an S+ grade monster, Ha Tae-heon was okay, but it was fatal to Hong Si-ah.\u201c\u2026my body feels weird. It\u2019s a debuff ability.\u201d\u201cPlease stand back.\u201dHong Si-ah calmly nodded her head. I used my ability a little more and changed the flow of the wind so that the stench didn\u2019t reach the two of them as much as possible.Haaaak! Haak!In the meantime, the monster\u2019s tentacles that were moving painfully began to wriggle all at once. I was nervous about the behaviour I had never seen before, but something reflected in a broken and cracked mirror.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dA man with his eyes closed was seen in a round egg soaked in a slimy liquid. There were people in every dozen of eggs that looked like frog eggs.Like me, Hong Si-ah, who looked in the mirror, shouted with a startled voice.\u201cThey\u2019re the party attendees!\u201dThe tentacles stuck in the eggs were gleaming white as they sucked in something. Then, the face of the one who was in the egg was distorted in pain. Among them were Lee Joo-ha and Kim Na-yul.Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah\u2019s faces hardened terribly and the energy of anger overflowed. It seemed that everyone, including those who disappeared somewhere through the black hole, which Hong Si-ah spoke of, was in such a state of being held captive.The flesh of the monster\u2019s cut wrist that absorbed the white energy through its tentacles began to bulge, and in an instant, the hand was restored to its original state.This time, not hallucinations, but the regenerative ability was clear.\u201cAnnoying!\u201dHong Si-ah swung her whip again, but she failed to push the monster back. My body movements were noticeably slow enough to be seen by my eyes. The effect of the debuff ability appeared.\u201cLet\u2019s change the strategy.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who looked at the situation calmly, said to Hong Si-ah.\u201cI will draw attention.\u201dBehind the monster, there was the entrance to the underground that Hong Si-ah discovered. Ha Tae-heon pointed to it with his hand.\u201cMaster Hong Si-ah. Go cut off the tentacles and rescue the attendees.\u201d\u201c\u2026will it be okay?\u201d\u201cContinuously dealing with monsters is meaningless if you can\u2019t get rid of the tentacles.\u201dHong Si-ah, who had been contemplating for a while, nodded her head with a calm expression at her explanation. As he said, this situation could only be resolved if someone removed the tentacles.\u201cOkay. Hang in there. I will try to solve it as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the agreement was over, Ha Tae-heon began to attract the attention of the monster so that Hong Si-ah could safely reach the underground entrance.\u2018Complicated.\u2019 (\uae4c\ub2e4\ub86d\ub2e4)I bit my lip looking at Ha Tae-heon, who could not easily attack properly even while approaching the monster\u2019s nose and wielding a sword. I was worried. Like before, I\u2019m afraid that it would cause injuries to those caught after inflicting fatal damage to the monster like before.There was no way Hong Si-ah could not be ignorant of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s movement that I had noticed. Hong Si-ah, who was dealing with the monster with a serious face without a smile, moved slowly to prevent the monster from noticing it.Kuuaaak!When Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah alternately touched it, the monster roared with anger and slammed the floor with both arms. Hong Si-ah quickly escaped the monster\u2019s gaze and moved downwards at the rougher movement.Hong Si-ah, who flew to the front of the stairs without hesitation, looked back at Ha Tae-heon and sent a warning to be careful. I nodded my head and recovered my ability that had been wrapped around her. Hong Si-ah, who landed on the ground with agile movements, went down the stairs before the monster noticed.Half of the operation was successful just because Hong Si-ah went down safely underground.\u2018Now the question is how to endure\u2026\u2019Unless Hong Si-ah handled the tentacles, she still couldn\u2019t attack the monster. Until then, she had to keep fighting with the monster.I called Ha Tae-heon, who barely avoided the monster\u2019s attack.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi, move with me!\u201dSince there was no Hong Si-ah, it was much better to move in the arms of Ha Tae-heon as I did. Ha Tae-heon seemed to ponder for a moment at my call then came towards me.Since I was floating in the air, I looked up and stretched out my arms to hug Ha Tae-heon, who was in a higher place than usual. Ha Tae-heon, who was trying to naturally grab my waist, stopped with a strange expression for a moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi?\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with you? When I looked at Ha Tae-heon, who didn\u2019t pull me, he kept his mouth shut and met my gaze.\u201cWhat? If any problem\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dTo the extent that it was strange that he hesitated, Ha Tae-heon firmly embraced my body. I wrapped my arms around Ha Tae-heon\u2019s neck and took a comfortable position.\u201cI can\u2019t attack anyway, so I\u2019ll make it easier to dodge.\u201dThe strength of the wind had been increased so that it could move at a higher speed.\u00a0Haaaak!\u00a0As the monster roared, like before, lightning struck everywhere.Black smoke rose from the tree-studded with lightning. Below, it was filled with trees blazing with lightning strikes.Kiiiik!The monster made a bizarre cry and spread its split face like petals. Then it put its hand in the centre.Clack, clack.A strange liquid dripped from the monster\u2019s face, which swallowed its hand deeply. Frowning at the disgusting sight, the monster slowly pulled out its hand. It was a new sword that was soaked in the black liquid.A monster with a sword of a size similar to that which had been shattered swung its arms wide.\u00a0Huung, I said to Ha Tae-heon as he flew away from the giant sword passing over his head.\u201cI think it would be better to smash the black like before.\u201dRaising the sword greatly expanded the attack radius of the monster. More than simply swinging its arms, the patterns also varied, making it difficult to avoid.Ha Tae-heon, who nodded his head at my words, blocked the sword coming to the side. There was a disgusting smell with a creepy sound as the blades clashed with each other.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe liquid on the monster sword was the cause. It was the monster\u2019s blood that had a bad effect on Hong Si-ah as well as a debuff ability.My eyes clouded, I felt dizzy, and my energy shook greatly.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dWhen the wind stopped for a moment, Ha Tae-heon and I fell. I hastily used my ability again, but didn\u2019t create a strong wind like before.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it would be like this.\u201d\u201cKeep covering with my coat.\u201dMy tongue hardened and my pronunciation was muffled. I apologized and did not take his coat sleeves off my face as Ha Tae-heon said.In the meantime, the monster continued to swing the sword. Each time the black liquid splashed nearby, the stinging pain continued, like a needle being pierced into the skin.\u201cHa, Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dI moved my slightly loose tongue and pointed at the mirror. Someone moved in the mirror reflecting the attendees. It was Hong Si-ah.\u201cI think the underground was right.\u201d\u201cFortunately. Just hold on a little longer\u2026\u201dI breathed a sigh of relief. If Hong Si-ah just cut off the tentacles that were stuck in the participants, she would immediately kill the monster\u2026Kkiiiiik\u2014!That was then. As Hong Si-ah reflected in the mirror, the monster roared longer and wildly than ever before, puffing up its chest. Alas, its four-pronged torn face opened wide and its whole body turned black.\u201cWhat is this\u2026!\u201dThe black light that spread rapidly through the monster\u2019s skin changed even the tentacles. Inside the opaque tentacles, a black liquid filled up and bulged as if it was about to burst.I looked in the mirror reflexively in fear of chills. Hong Si-ah, not aware of this situation, was approaching its tentacles. I then screamed at the whip that swung without hesitation.\u201cNo!\u201dAs the bright red whip crossed the tentacles, black liquid gushed out of the severed tentacles. Hong Si-ah, facing the liquid in front of her nose, twisted her body and fell to her floor. Ha Tae-heon, who was looking in the mirror while avoiding the lightning, frowned.An opaque liquid dripped from the severed tentacles, from which all black blood had escaped, onto the fainting Hong Si-ah. It wrapped around Hong Si-ah like a drop of water and turned into a round egg, and like the others, it completely engulfed Hong Si-ah.\u201cThat\u2019s worst.\u201dHa Tae-heon slashed the monster\u2019s sword and muttered in an annoying voice. I closed my eyes and coughed. I felt that my condition was getting worse.No matter how much I covered my mouth and nose with his coat, I could not block all the debuff ability. To make matters worse, as I used my ability for a long time, my energy gradually began to bottom out. I thought as I felt the vibration of the bracelet on my wrist.\u2018What should I do now?\u2019Now that even Hong Si-ah was caught, the two of me and Ha Tae-heon had to solve the situation.There was a way to go back the way I came and bring Cheon Sa-yeon, but in the meantime, I did not know what would happen to those trapped in the egg.\u2018Then what\u2019s left\u2026\u2019I calmly gathered my thoughts and bowed my head slightly. Cold sweat ran down my cheeks.\u201c\u2026Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dI loosened my arms around his neck and put them on his shoulder.\u201cIt can\u2019t be like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI will be the bait. This time, Ha Tae-heon-ssi, please go to the underground.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say nonsense.\u201dHa Tae-heon\u2019s reply was quick, not knowing what I was going to say.\u201cThere is no other way. You know.\u201d\u201cIt is S+ grade. You can\u2019t stand it alone.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll hold out as much as I can.\u201dI touched my heart. Due to the debuff ability of the monster, the energy surrounding the heart was stiff and did not move properly. Feeling extremely tired, I continued.\u201cIf you keep going like this, things will only get worse. No one can save them, and in the end, it could endanger even us. You know you have to make decisions coolly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe sword slid slowly over my head. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s eyes filled up with anxiety.It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t know Ha Tae-heon\u2019s feelings. He now put the attendees and me on the scale and had to choose who was more important.I deliberately and resolutely got out of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arms. When I lifted my body, my energy was doubled and I started to get headaches.\u201cGo. If Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0really cares about me, all you have to do now is save the people as soon as possible and get back.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was staring at me with his terrifyingly stiff face, turned his gaze and looked in the mirror. Hong Si-ah, Kim Na-yul, and Lee Joo-ha, who were trapped in an egg while losing their minds, finally he nodded his head.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll come right away after saving them.\u201dYeah. This is how you become the protagonist.I was genuinely relieved and smiled at him.\u201cI\u2019m amazing at running away. I will endure it no matter what, so trust me and go.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who had hesitated for an answer, quickly turned his back. From now on, I had to perfectly capture the attention of the monster so that he could safely go to the underground behind it.I climbed high and stood in front of the monster. As we split into two, the monster that attacked me at random, as if confused, saw me and cried sharply as if alerting me.Haaaak!With a deep smile, I lifted my energy up once more. The fallen trees that filled the ground rose to where I was.Ha Tae-heon couldn\u2019t attack because he could directly damage the monster, but my situation was different. Even if I attacked for a hundred days with my A-rank ability, I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave a single wound on an S+-grade monster. So it was better. It was the best condition to attract attention without any injuries.\u201cCome on~ look here.\u201dThe trees that were raised were thrown at the monster. The monster, who was suddenly hit by a tree, roared in annoyance. Dodging the hand of the monster approaching at high speed to snatch me, I attacked by making the wind as sharp as a blade this time. Even if it was orthodox, no traces were left.If I were to compare my appearance now, would I be like a mosquito? Using the widest space as much as possible, I calmly avoided the attack.\u00a0Huung, the monster\u2019s sword that passed right next to my ear cut my hair slightly.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe stench emanating from the sword made me dizzy. I clenched my teeth, cleared my mind, and bent down to avoid the next attack. Meanwhile, Ha Tae-heon, who safely moved behind the monster, went to the underground.As soon as I confirmed that Ha Tae-heon had gone down safely, I immediately cut off the wind that surrounded him. That alone made me a little out of breath.Kieeeek!Perhaps it noticed that Ha Tae-heon had gone down to the underground, the monster inflated its chest like before.\u00a0Huu, I let out a rough breath and raised the corners of my lips to laugh. It won\u2019t work this time. Because the debuff ability of S+ grade did not work on SS-rank Ha Tae-heon.I think it was a good thing to let him go, but this time the monster bent its back and opened up the cleaved flesh of its face as much as possible. An ominous feeling ran up the back of my back. Just as I was about to hurriedly pull back, the monster blew out thick smoke from its face.\u201c\u2026cough, cough!\u201dThe black smoke emitted at a tremendous speed spread all around. I was trapped in the smoke and couldn\u2019t get out, I spit out a cough that rose through my throat. My body felt like I was drunk. The debuff smoke that I inhaled made my energy harder than ever before, so I couldn\u2019t use my ability at will.I turned my stiff head forcibly and looked at the hand of the monster approaching quickly.\u201cAh, this\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s been fucked up.Coughing, my eyes turned round and round at the same time as a strong shock of shaking the goal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In my blurry vision, I saw a sword that was stabbed down at high speed.Kwaang!I forcibly moved my body to dodge the attack. In the process, Ha Tae-heon\u2019s coat fell to the ground, which I couldn\u2019t hold back.\u201cGasp, gasp\u2026\u201dI tried to stand up, but my legs kept losing strength and my body collapsed. Perhaps the debuff had reduced my eyesight, my eyes looked hazy.Kugung! Thud!In the aftermath of the attack that I avoided by a short margin, my body floated up and rolled to the ground. Lightning struck nearby. I struggled to open my eyes and looked at the huge monster standing in the black smoke and the flames burning the trees.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dWiping off the cold sweat, I barely stood upright and forced my squeaky energy like rust.\u00a0Hwiing, the wind that started in my hand didn\u2019t just wrap around my body, but gradually spread around me. The fire created by the lightning swelled up in the wind.I don\u2019t have to be easily beaten. Against an opponent where the attack didn\u2019t work no matter what you do, even this might be just useless.\u2018It\u2019s always been like that, so there\u2019s nothing to be surprised about.\u2019No matter how useless it was, I didn\u2019t want to let go and sit still. I lifted my head and looked at Ha Tae-heon reflected in the mirror. He walked over to the tentacle and raised his sword. At that moment, I jumped into the air.The energy that had begun to move was unstable and twisted. Enduring the pain, as before, the tree was lifted by the wind and blown at the monster.\u00a0Kwajik, the tree that hit the monster\u2019s body was shattered.Kieeeek!The monster cried angrily. I flew here and there to keep the monster from paying attention to the underground, throwing trees over and over again.\u201cArgh!\u201dKwarurung!\u00a0Right behind me, a lightning bolt struck me and I felt pain in my back. It was a hot sensation as if on fire. The moment I shuddered in pain, I was caught by the monster\u2019s grasp.\u201cKeuk, ugh\u2026!\u201dThe long, hard monster\u2019s hand wrapped around my body. As I was dragged closer to the monster in that state, I smelled a strong stench that made me nauseous.The monster that lifted me widened its face. The four-pronged flesh of its face, soaked in black liquid, was bubbling with bubbles and hundreds of fine needles sprouted. I was horrified by the terrible sight unfolding beneath my feet.I struggled desperately to get out. I also used my ability but to no avail. It was impossible to escape from the monster\u2019s tight grip.\u201cUgh,\u00a0huk.\u201dA sense of fear engulfed reason on the face of the monster that was getting closer.\u00a0Thump! Thump!\u00a0The sound of my heart beating at a tremendous speed echoed in my ears and cold sweat ran down my chin.The moment I was about to be swallowed from the leg.Kiaaaak\u2014!Suddenly the monster twisted and screamed. I reflexively checked the mirror and found Ha Tae-heon, who mercilessly cut off the tentacles. The monster lost its balance and staggered greatly. My body trembled wildly along with it.I felt a strong pressure all over my body to let go of my mind, but I clenched my teeth and endured it. Ha Tae-heon once again swung his sword. As many of the tentacles stuck in the egg were cut off at once, the size of the monster began to decrease little by little.\u2018The grade\u2026!\u2019Falling. Thanks to being close to the monster, I could be sure. The power of the monster\u2019s grip and the sense of fear I felt were different from just now. When Ha Tae-heon cleaned up the last remaining tentacles, the monster flew into the air, pouring black blood from its face. The tentacles on the lower body were cut off by Ha Tae-heon\u2019s attack and wriggled, showing a cross-section.During that time, I pulled out half of my body from the monster\u2019s hand and used my ability. Now, I can kill it. Of course, even if the grade fell, the opponent was an S-grade. Then there is only one way.By moving the creaking energy, I drew the huge fire I had gathered in one place into the wind. A hot fire swept through the wind and moved as I wished. I pulled out all the fire that I could see under my feet and poured it on the monster.It was a fire created by S+-grade lightning. It would work well against monsters whose rank had been lowered to S-grade.Crack, creak, crack\u2026!As I expected, the monster on fire poured out the black liquid and made a boiling sound of phlegm. I barely managed to get out of the crack in its grip strength and I collapsed on the dirt floor.\u201cGasp\u2026 gasp\u2026\u201dIn front of me, I saw a monster that had been engulfed in fire and was burning. Black smoke spread all over the air. The energy that had barely moved had hardened again, and his body had stiffened. In the distant view, I barely lifted the corners of my lips and smiled.\u201cLook, good\u2026 you bastard,\u00a0ya.\u201dI closed my eyes while laughing at the painfully dying monster. The upper body fell sideways.* * *Uhum, hmm.\u00a0A soft hum echoed in the dark hallway. A firmly closed door appeared in front of Cheon Sa-yeon, who was walking slowly as if he had come out for a walk with his hands in his pants pockets.When he grabbed the handle of the wooden door engraved with a luxurious pattern and turned it, the door opened with a clicking sound.\u00a0Squeak. Cheon Sa-yeon entered the room past the rusty metal sound and tapped the floor with his long sword.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe identity of the spacious room was the study room. However, it was not books, but dolls that filled each bookshelf. Hundreds of ball-jointed dolls adorned with colourful dresses and accessories glistened in the candlelight.\u201cAh, no wonder I feel so bad\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon calmly counted the passing time. Yes. This annoying and boring moment had come again.Laugh.Laughter was heard from somewhere.Laugh. Laugh.The laughter that started once spread throughout the library.\u00a0Kkigigik!\u00a0The doll\u2019s face, who was looking straight ahead, twisted towards Cheon Sa-yeon at the same time. A voice came from the yellow blonde doll in the middle of the second row of the first bookshelf in the study room.\u201cYou are not surprised to see us.\u201dAnother doll continued.\u201cA normal human would scream.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fun.\u201d\u201cI am having fun.\u201d\u201cInteresting.\u201d\u201cNo luck! Let\u2019s kill him!\u201d\u201cBe careful. He is not an ordinary human being.\u201d\u201cKill! Chewing!\u201dThe inside of the study room was filled with the noise of dolls chattering. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was rubbing his temples with his fingers with a tired expression, smiled.\u201cAbel (\uc544\ubca8).\u201dWhen the dolls heard the name coming out of his mouth, they moved their heads.\u201cYou know my name.\u201d\u201cHow? How?\u201d\u201cYou called me with that dirty mouth!\u201d\u201cCalm down. God said it he would know us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ominous. I want to kill you.\u201d\u201cAre you going to kill him? Can I kill him?\u201dAs he listened to the doll\u2019s conversation, Cheon Sa-yeon drew his palm with his sword. A familiar pain followed and his blood dripped. Flames rose in the muddy, bright red blood.\u201cFrom the party hall to this gate, you made something interesting. Thanks to you, I didn\u2019t notice it.\u201dThe fire soared with momentum to melt everything around it. One of the closest dolls made a sharp metal sound like a cat with its fur upright.\u201cIt\u2019s hot! It\u2019s hot!\u201d\u201cYou fool, you never plan to do it alone\u2026 yeah. Samael (\uc0ac\ub9c8\uc5d8) has moved.\u201dCrackle. Crackle.Eventually, one of the dolls melted. Its eyeballs rolled through the bizarrely flowing face.Thud. Thud.The dolls that fell all at once from the bookshelf crawled and hung on the legs of the Cheon Sa-yeon, irrespective of their melting bodies.\u201cLet\u2019s kill him! Let\u2019s kill him!\u201d\u201cPut a knife in his neck!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked at the dolls that were clinging to him indifferently. The energy felt from the doll was undeniably weak. It was a reconnaissance doll often used by Abel.Cheon Sa-yeon, who remembered Samael\u2019s disgusting mask, which seemed to make him sick just thinking about it, drew an unpleasant breath and swung his sword.\u201cAaargh! Argh!\u201d\u201cHurt! Hurt! Hurt!\u201d\u201cKill! Kill him!\u201d\u201cMurderer! Murderer! Die!\u201dEven though it was a doll, the sound of ripping flesh or the bright red blood that spattered was no different from cutting a person. The voice of a child screamed simultaneously and cursed him.A doll\u2019s hand with red nail polish pulled his pants leg. A sharp blade of a sword passes over it without hesitation. Red blood poured from the cut section.The inside of the study room turned into hell in an instant. The screams of a child filled it, blood gushed, and fire engulfed it all. Continuing to swing the sword with a bored expression on his face, Cheon Sa-yeon came to the conclusion of all this.\u201cI am not the target.\u201dSomehow at the crossroad, the left side was particularly annoying, so he went and looked. He was caught in a subtle trap laid by Samael.He went in the opposite direction to himself and he thought of Han Yi-gyeol and Ha Tae-heon. He didn\u2019t think Ha Tae-heon would be easy because Han Yi-gyeol was with him\u2026\u201cAh. Ah\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 gig\u2026\u201dCrackle. Crackle.The pieces of the doll\u2019s body scattered on the floor were eaten by the fire. Leaving behind the study room full of the smell of blood, Cheon Sa-yeon went back the way he had come. The suit he was wearing was stained with the doll\u2019s blood.The way back was empty. Before he parted, he made it clear to come back in case of danger.\u2018There is nothing dangerous enough to come back, or the situation is so urgent that there is no time to escape. One of the two.\u2019It was most likely the latter. Cheon Sa-yeon hummed a light hum as before and walked over to the door on the right where Han Yi-gyeol and Ha Tae-heon had entered. He made his way through a long, boring hallway than the one on the left and came to the end.\u201cOh, my.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon raised the corners of his lips gracefully at the sight in front of his wide-open eyes. He saw the corpse of a huge monster that had been burned to death. It was not Ha Tae-heon\u2019s work.\u2018Han Yi-gyeol brought the fire with his ability to kill it.\u2019Just looking around, it was clear what kind of battle was going on.As if a storm had been swept away, Cheon Sa-yeon looked around while walking around the ruined and crumbling surroundings then found a small body lying in the corner.As he got closer, he saw a familiar face with both eyes closed and fainted. He must have fought a hard battle and it was somehow funny to see him lying in a mess. It was like watching an abandoned animal.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dHe called his name, but there was no response. He knelt down on one of his knees and scanned him slowly from face to toe. There was a fishy smell of blood, but unlike in the study room, it was not unpleasantness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt stiff energy. Had he been hit by a debuff ability?\u201cYou\u2019re a really demanding collaborator.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who put down the sword he was holding, gently pushed Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s shoulder. Cheon Sa-yeon, who climbed on top of Han Yi-gyeol, who was lying in an upright position, touched his cheek.A gentle face could be seen under the dishevelled brown hair. Cheon Sa-yeon smiled as he wiped his face, which was stained with blood from his torn forehead, with his thumb.He was bruised and broken here and there, but as long as Han Yi-gyeol slept in the clothes he bought him, it felt pretty good to look down.He never imagined that a moment would come when he would feel this kind of emotion while looking at Han Yi-gyeol, not anyone else.\u201cWhen are you going to reveal your real name?\u00a0Ung? Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dHe tapped his white cheek as if he was playing around. Then the brow frowned slightly. Every time he reacted to what he touched, Cheon Sa-yeon bent his eyebrows with a satisfied expression.Holding his face, he lowered his left hand and grabbed Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s hand. As before, he began to slowly push his energy into his hands by interlocking his fingers.\u201c\u2026ugh.\u201dAs slimy energy began to enter his palm, Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body trembled. His straight forehead was wrinkled and the corners of his eyes glew brightly. Cheon Sa-yeon watched all of it closely.\u201cUh, ah\u2026 ugh.\u201dThe closed eyelids trembled and opened slightly. The soft caramel-coloured eyes he finally met turned towards Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cHa, Tae-heon-ssi\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs if his tongue was hardened due to the debuff effect, the name that came out with a slightly slurred pronunciation was not his. With his smiling face, Cheon Sa-yeon held Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s hand more tightly and pushed his energy into him at once.\u201cAh?\u00a0Gasp, uh, ugh\u2026! Ah\u2026!\u201dHan Yi-gyeol\u2019s back suddenly bent as he looked up at Cheon Sa-yeon with a blurred gaze. Although it was obvious that he was in pain, Cheon Sa-yeon did not stop as if he was grumpy and continued to inject his energy.St, op\u2026 stop\u2026! I, I\u2019m tired\u2026\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201dHan Yi-gyeol struggled as hard as he could to escape from under him. Pressing down on the body, Cheon Sa-yeon said in a voice of scolding.\u201cI\u2019m helping you. You should take it quietly.\u00a0Ung? It\u2019s precious that others can\u2019t get it even if they want to.\u201d\u201cUgh, ah, no\u2026 No more\u2026! Huu!\u201d\u201cHaha, look at this.\u201dThe warm energy of Cheon Sa-yeon that entered through the palm of his hand completely enveloped Han Yi-gyeol. The energy that had been hardened by the debuff slowly loosened and began to move. Contrary to the owner who was overwhelming, the flowing energy expressed satisfaction. Cheon Sa-yeon smirked on the corner of his lips.\u201cYou\u2019re going to eat it like this, but you say you can\u2019t do it with your mouth\u2026 It seems that lying has become a habit.\u201d\u201cUuugh\u2026! Ah, ugh\u2026\u201dDespite the absurd accusations, Han Yi-gyeol could not refute as usual and was only slurred in pain. As he stared at Han Yi-gyeol, who could not come to his senses, Cheon Sa-yeon confirmed that his energy had returned perfectly to normal.\u201cGasp, gasp\u2026\u201dWhen he stopped energizing, Han Yi-gyeol grabbed his face, trembling and exhaling harshly. The fact that the corners of his eyes were slightly wet, if he had pushed him harder, he would have cried and couldn\u2019t stand it. He felt a little sad.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon\u2026\u201dNow he was called by his proper name. Cheon Sa-yeon answered, feeling that his twisted feeling somehow loosened.\u201cUng.\u201d\u201cYou, fucking\u2026 bastard\u2026\u201dThanks to this, Han Yi-gyeol, who escaped from the debuff effect, spit out abusive language with clearer eyes and accurate pronunciation.\u201cHaa, I\u2026 I told you not to do it again\u2026\u201dHis energy returned to normal, but his physical condition was still bad. Cheon Sa-yeon glanced at his trembling bracelet to fill the exhaustion and opened his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever said yes.\u201d\u201cShut up, you wretched bastard\u2026\u201dHan Yi-gyeol, who was staring at Cheon Sa-yeon with irritation, closed his eyes with a tired expression. His face was warm as he touched his hand. It was a fever that started from the wounds on his body. It was said that the energy was somehow managed by the bracelet, but the wound seemed to need treatment.Cheon Sa-yeon lifted his body, holding the droopy Han Yi-gyeol in his arms. Supporting his hips and let his upper body lean on his shoulder. Han Yi-gyeol grumbled like a dog while holding his head as if he had a headache from the soaring heat.Cheon Sa-yeon looked around to find a way out while holding him and found a man standing on the other side. It was Ha Tae-heon, looking at them with the SS-class coat in hand.Since when had he been watching? He wondered, but it didn\u2019t matter. Cheon Sa-yeon deliberately patted Han Yi-gyeol on the back and laughed as if to show off. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s brow furrowed with strength and his dark eyes gleamed coldly.Cheon Sa-yeon recognized the texture of his emotions. Regret.Ha Tae-heon turned his back, holding the coat so tightly that tendons sprouted. Cheon Sa-yeon, who discovered that there was a staircase leading down to the underground in front of him on the way, walked behind him without smiling.* * *The sound of several people talking could be heard through the hazy mind. I felt a throbbing headache and slowly opened my eyes.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cSleep more.\u201dA soft voice came from right next to me. I barely could turn my head to confirm the owner of the voice.\u201cWhy am I\u2026\u201dHugged by you. The back words came out almost like a whisper. Cheon Sa-yeon, who heard about it, answered with a face that looked somewhat happy.\u201cI did my best to remove the debuff effect, but you fainted. I have no choice but to hug you.\u201d\u201cWhere am I\u2026\u201d\u201cUnderground. We also found the gate exit. Now we are taking out the attendees from the egg. There are only a few left now.\u201dIs that so? That\u2019s a relief. I breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cCough, cough!\u00a0What is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026is this inside the gate?\u201d\u201cYou can pull it out without having to dig it deep enough to tear it apart. Yes, that much.\u201d\u201cI found two more eggs here!\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t know who did it?\u201dInside the underground, there was a lot of noise from the conversations of the attendees. Everyone looked busy, but it was uncomfortable because it seemed like I was the only one being held comfortably.\u201cLet me down\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI\u2019m going down, but what are you saying you can\u2019t? I struggled to go down and gave strength to my body, but Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arms around my hips and thighs didn\u2019t even budge. Cheon Sa-yeon said in a single voice as if I was e a child who didn\u2019t listen.\u201cStay still.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, so let go.\u201d\u201cYou have a big wound on your back. Your forehead was also torn. If you don\u2019t want to faint again, listen.\u201dSomehow, I thought that my back was too hot. In the midst of dealing with a monster, I remembered the lightning bolt that had hit was right behind my back. Was I hurt then?Unable to overcome Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s stubbornness, I had to be held by him by semi-forced until all the participants were finally rescued and escaped through the gate exit.Thanks to Ha Tae-heon and Lee Joo-ha, who went out of the gate in advance and contacted the emergency centre and management headquarters, several support teams arrived quickly by helicopter.The location of the gate was Gulupdo Island, one of the islands belonging to Incheon City. Although tourists came and went, it was said that no one had found the gate that was created a month ago because it was an island with very few people.I looked at the gate floating at the bottom of the cliff, in a corner.\u2018If it\u2019s in that location, you won\u2019t notice it.\u2019I, who was seriously injured among the attendees, met the healer as soon as I left the gate. The healer, who checked my condition, told me to go to the hospital first because there was a high risk of internal injuries and gave first aid with an A-grade hemostatic bandage. With my bare body wrapped in bandages and a white shirt draped over my shoulders, I stared blankly at the attendees who were busy cleaning up.Among them, Ha Tae-heon and Hong Si-ah seemed to be the busiest ones. The two, who remained until the end and dealt with the monster, were called to various people to explain the situation, from officials at the management headquarters to the media who ran to hear the news.I almost would have been dragged away, but everyone who. came, couldn\u2019t stand the chilling smile of Cheon Sa-yeon standing next to me and ran away. I said to Cheon Sa-yeon, looking at the media officials who were moving away in a hurry.\u201cI don\u2019t care about the interview.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing that?\u201dI was embarrassed by the firm answer to not even dreaming. While I was fiddling with the ringer on my wrist for no reason, an official from the management headquarters approached me in a hurry.\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon, I\u2019m sorry, but could you please come over for a moment?\u201dAt those words, Cheon Sa-yeon put on an openly annoyed expression on his face. Feeling sorry for the person in charge who was neatly ignored, I pushed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s arm.\u201cGo. Let me rest by myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to come back. Following the guidance of the official, who was sweating profusely, the next guest came as if they had been waiting.\u201cAhem. That\u2026 Talented Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dThose who approached with coughing moved away.After that, Kim Na-yul was also seen. What\u2019s going on with these two?\u201cHow is your body?\u201dIt was quite awkward in this situation of Lee Joo-ha speaking to me first, so I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes on one place. I tilted my head slightly and answered.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Is everything okay with you two?\u201d\u201cYes. We\u2019re just\u2026\u201dLee Joo-ha, who answered with hesitation, took a deep breath and opened her mouth with a determined expression.\u201cI heard from Tae-heon. He said that when he was in danger, you came out and dealt with the monster.\u201dAh, I was wondering what you were trying to say. I smiled and shook my head.\u201cNo\u2026 Rather, thanks to Ha Tae-heon-ssi, I was able to live.\u201dKim Na-yul, who was standing next to me at my words, took a step closer, curled the corners of her eyes and smiled.\u201cNevertheless. You blocked the S+-grade monster by yourself. And you got hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, this is\u2026\u201dI reflexively covered the large gauze that was attached to my forehead. It wasn\u2019t hurt at all to put them together like this. Cheon Sa-yeon kept nagging at the healer who treated me.\u201cThank you for saving me. Master also asked me to greet you. She wanted to come in person, but things are a little\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI hope we have a chance to clear the gate together later.\u201dKim Na-yul, who gave thanks one last time, shook hands with me and went to Hong Si-ah\u2019s side. During the conversation, Lee Joo-ha, who was standing without interrupting, looked with straight eyes.\u201cI feel the same way as Deputy Master Kim Na-yul. It must have taken a lot of courage to deal with an S+-grade monster alone, thank you so much.\u201dI smiled shyly, rubbing the nape of my neck for nothing with serious eyes. It seemed that my image had changed a bit for Lee Joo-ha this time. Did I go from being a shameless kidnapper to a person with good cooperation skills?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Extreme opposites\u201cAnd, this is a different story\u2026\u201dLee Joo-ha, who did not leave after saying goodbye, looked around, lowered her voice, and opened her mouth again.\u201cThat\u2019s what Tae-heon said. You wouldn\u2019t be the kind of person who sells information to the Requiem Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201dWhat does this mean?I frowned at the sudden remark. Selling information? From me to Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201cActually, I used to doubt you before. I thought you were going to give Tae-heon an SS-class coat and wield it as a weakness. So when I heard that the Master Cheon Sa-yeon threatened Tae-heon with an SS-class coat, I was very angry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was difficult to properly understand what Lee Joo-ha was saying. A cold aura fell into the corner of my heart.\u201cHowever\u2026 Tae-heon said to me in the underground of the gate earlier. He doesn\u2019t think you are like the kind of person who would do such a cowardly thing. I\u2019ll trust you once. If the owner of the coat says so, and I doubt it, what will I do? It is true that I owe you my life.\u201dAs if she spit out her tight feelings, Lee Joo-ha smiled satisfactorily and held out her hand.\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s bury the unpleasant incidents for now. I\u2019ll also put aside my stupid thoughts and get to know you properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026thank you for saying that.\u201dHiding my confused mind, I forcibly pulled up the corners of my mouth and shook her hand with mine.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt your rest. I\u2019ll get going now. Get treatment for your injuries.\u201dLee Joo-ha turned her back with her relieved face. Looking at her back as Lee Joo-ha was leaving, I closed my eyes tightly.\u2018Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026 threatened? To Ha Tae-heon?\u2019With the SS-class coat that I got for him?Furious anger engulfed my chest and all sorts of negative emotions running through my head. I lowered my head and covered my eyes with my cold hand. Something hot was gurgling and rising out of my throat.\u2018Therefore\u2026\u2019Therefore Ha Tae-heon looked at me like that. From the day I visited Roheon Guild for mercenary work, I remembered the attitude of Ha Tae-heon, who was particularly cold and confused me.\u201cHa, shit\u2026\u201dI spit out a swear word with a disappointing smile, biting my lip painfully.I knew. Cheon Sa-yeon is such a bastard. It was very annoying that the emotions that never calmed down.I certainly knew that if it was for his own benefit, he was a piece of garbage that would leave without guilt for using everything around him.It was like that\u2026\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201dI slowly lowered my hand and raised my head to look ahead. I saw Cheon Sa-yeon standing looking at me with his suit jacket on his arm. When I saw that face, all of a sudden, all of this felt so ridiculous.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Where does it hurt more\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come.\u201dI stopped him as he came closer. Cheon Sa-yeon narrowed his eyes at my cold gaze. A sharper atmosphere than ever before fell between me and Cheon Sa-yeon.Cheon Sa-yeon, who looked around slowly, opened his mouth in an unfavourable voice.\u201cIn between those moments\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLooks like someone has been there.\u201dI opened my mouth, but couldn\u2019t spit out anything. What\u2019s the use of having a conversation? After all, the relationship between me and Cheon Sa-yeon was just using each other.\u2018I\u2019m stupid to feel betrayed by that bastard.\u2019However, contrary to what I thought, my complicated feelings kept dragging me to the bottom without end. I felt pathetic for myself for feeling this way.\u201cTell me, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dInstead of answering, I shook my head. I didn\u2019t want to share any words with Cheon Sa-yeon. When I closed my mouth and avoided his gaze, Cheon Sa-yeon removed the smile that was hanging like a mask.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dHe strode over and grabbed my wrist. The skin that touched it was quite cold.\u201cThe fever is rising again.\u201d\u201cLet go.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to you all of sudden?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 it, it hurts!\u201dA strong pain came over my wrist. As I clenched my teeth and twisted my body, Cheon Sa-yeon slightly loosened his strength. He spoke with regret.\u201cIf you are honest, there will be no pain.\u201dI smiled with my face distorted by pain. Who\u2019s the one who\u2019s being hurt now? Annoying.\u201cIt has nothing to do with you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dYeah. This is just between me and Ha Tae-heon. There\u2019s no room for a guy like you to step in.Cheon Sa-yeon wiggled his eyebrows with a displeased expression. Just as he was about to say something more, an unfamiliar voice intervened between us.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201dIt was the healer who gave me first aid earlier. She bowed her head slightly and said hello to Cheon Sa-yeon, pointing to the back.\u201cIt says that the space transfer installation is complete. We\u2019ll start with the injured people first. As soon as we arrived in Incheon, we had an ambulance on standby so we could go to the hospital.\u201d\u201c\u2026let\u2019s go right away.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who answered on my behalf, released my wrist and supported my shoulders so that I could raise my body instead. It was a very different attitude than when he grabbed my wrist.I felt like I wanted to get rid of it, but I gave up and accepted it because I didn\u2019t know how to be stubborn.I was supported by Cheon Sa-yeon and moved to the place where space transfer was installed. A white, round light was shining brightly on the floor, and Choi Mi-jin was standing in front of it.\u201cTalented Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dChoi Mi-jin, with a face covered in dark circles, approached me. Even though she looked tired, she had a smile on her lips.\u201cI heard what happened at the gate. On behalf of everyone, I would like to say thank you.\u201d\u201cNo. I just did what I had to do.\u201dWhen I smiled awkwardly and gave a normal answer, Choi Mi-jin\u2018s eyes twinkled. What is it?\u201cDo you think so?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat to do\u2026\u201d (Choi Mi-jin probably wanted to recruit Yi-gyeol into Centre Management)\u201cLet\u2019s stop there.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon interrupted in a rare, annoying voice. Choi Mi-jin, who quickly noticed that Cheon Sa-yeon was in a ferocious state, nodded her head and stepped back.\u201cOkay. Things aren\u2019t good right now\u2026 Let\u2019s move right away. Will Master Cheon Sa-yeon come with you?\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cAll right. Then, Talented Han Yi-gyeol. See you later.\u201dLeaving Choi Mi-jin behind, I stood on the space transfer with Cheon Sa-yeon. Space transfer was difficult to install and there was a limit to the number of people that could be moved, so it was only used when there were injured people like me.The pure white light that had lit the floor grew bigger and bigger, engulfed me and Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body. As my eyes filled with light, I felt dizzy and my body staggered. Even in the midst of the frenzy, I could feel the body temperature holding me tightly from behind.* * *Many people were shocked by the unprecedented event in which a large number of talented people entered the gate at the same time with the ability to move through space that was activated throughout the hotel floor. Even the news that most of those talented people were guild masters, domestic as well as overseas media flocked to Korea and started to rush here and there.\u2026that said, it has nothing to do with me, who is only an independent talented person.At that time, I came to Incheon and took an ambulance that was waiting and headed straight to the hospital. After seeing a doctor and being examined, I was treated by a healer and was able to recover without a single wound.Cheon Sa-yeon, who accompanied me to the hospital, took me to the guild as soon as healer\u2019s treatment was finished, and a week has passed and I haven\u2019t seen his nose.\u2018Of course, he must have been busy because of what happened.\u2019Not only Cheon Sa-yeon, but also other guild masters would be in a similar situation. We hadn\u2019t found the culprit, let alone how we got it inside the gate, so the commotion would continue for a while.As I was spending leisurely time lying on the sofa, I felt a heavyweight. When I opened my eyes, Kim Woo-jin, who was on top of my body, smiled brightly. No, seeing this kind of thing, it was not Kim Woo-jin, but his clone.In order to use his ability more skillfully, Kim Woo-jin always took out one clone. He didn\u2019t seem to like it very much, but well, he needed practice anyway.\u201cHeavy\u2026\u201dDespite the bruise, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s clone just smiled and bowed his upper body. While I sighed and patted his back, the owner ran and grabbed the clone\u2019s neck.\u201cGet up.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dAt Kim Woo-jin\u2019s cold words, his clone shouted. At first, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s clone, who seemed a bit stern at first, became quite clear after Kim Woo-jin\u2019s efforts. Even though it was still clinging to me.\u201cIf you\u2019re bothering me, I have to hit you, too. Why are you playing along?\u201dKim Woo-jin, who scrambled to remove the clone that had been pressed onto my body, was now nagging at me. This is a bit unfair.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? After all, it\u2019s your clone.\u201d\u201cA clone is a clone, not me.\u201dWhat do you mean?\u201cAre you telling me to cut off the clone and leave him alone?\u201dI asked because I was genuinely curious, but Kim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes became even sharper.\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201dIt was strangely awkward logic, but I couldn\u2019t figure out exactly where it was. As I rolled my eyes with a puzzled expression, I heard a knock on the door.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi~.\u201dIt was Min Ah-rin who came to play every day for the past week and stamped her attendance. Min Ah-rin patted the head of the clone, who opened the door with admiration, and then approached me.\u201cYou are still lying down today.\u201d\u201cI should rest when I can.\u201dI greeted Min Ah-rin while lying down, she smiled and handed me a box of cookies.\u201cThe cookies were bought by a colleague after vacation. Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0likes sweet things, so I brought it because I thought you would enjoy it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dOh, cookies. As a token of my gratitude, I politely received the cookie box with both hands. Snacks are the best.Meanwhile, the clone approached me as I opened the cookie box and sat down.\u201cEat it with milk.\u201dKim Woo-jin placed a cup of milk on the table. I patted the clone\u2019s body that came to me and put a cookie in my mouth. The sweet chocolate flavour spread throughout my mouth.\u201cStill, I\u2019m glad you look better today.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dMin Ah-rin, who was sitting on the sofa opposite me, put a cookie in Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand, who had brought her milk, and said.\u201cYes. You\u2019ve been depressed since the hotel incident. You also look sluggish.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI tried to hide it as much as possible, but it was still visible. There was a reason Min Ah-rin came every day for a week.Kim Woo-jin also didn\u2019t say anything, but he probably noticed it earlier. Even though he looked like that, he was faster than I thought.\u201cJust, a little\u2026 It\u2019s not a big deal to be concerned about.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m relieved.\u201dI swallowed a sigh as I looked at Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, who looked at my expressions. I couldn\u2019t make up my mind, so I was holding on to the problem sluggishly, and it made people around me worry for nothing.As I drank milk, I thought of Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026 I don\u2019t want to meet him yet. Ha Tae-heon, I would try to contact him soon. There were a lot of things that need to be solved here and there, so even if I dragged on more, it only made me feel uncomfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLate at night when darkness fell, I, alone in the room, lifted the mattress of the bed after a long time.I took out my hidden cell phone and dialled the only saved number without hesitation. The call was barely connected when the long ringing tone was almost cut off.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d[\u2026right.]Ha Tae-heon answered calmly, wondered if he expected me to contact him. I was thinking about how to have a conversation, but surprisingly, Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth first.[That day.]\u201cYes?\u201d[Did you go back and get treatment well?]\u201cUm\u2026 yes.\u201dI answered with an awkward smile. I guess my condition wasn\u2019t good. Ha Tae-heon asked me all these things. I brought out the main point with a smile on my lips.\u201cAre you very busy these days?\u201d[To some extent.]\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to meet you once.\u201dHa Tae-heon wasn\u2019t even in front of me, but somehow I felt uncomfortable. As I gently stroked the nape of my neck and spoke carefully, Ha Tae-heon spoke in a somewhat teasing tone.[Date?]\u201cPardon?\u201dSuddenly, I wondered what he was talking about, but I remembered that I had called him out while talking about a date before. You\u2019re making fun of me. Damn it.\u201cYeah, well\u2026 date. Yes.\u201dWhen I answered with a dismal way, Ha Tae-heon returned to his usual voice, as if he didn\u2019t tease me.[Then I\u2019ll see you now.]\u201cNow?\u201d[Come out.]\u201cIt\u2019s late\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d[As far as I remember, we met later last time.]That\u2019s right. I checked the time on the clock hanging on the wall. 12:23 am. It was just past midnight.\u201cThat\u2019s better for me. Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d[You are worried about unnecessary things.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYeah, you are good. You were saying that because you\u2019re SS-rank, right? I sighed and nodded my head.\u201cI understand. Where should I go?\u201d[Let\u2019s meet where we met last time.]\u201cLast time\u2026 Is it near the hotel?\u201d[Right. It would be better to go to a place where we can meet and talk first.]\u201cAll right.\u201dAfter finishing the call, I hid my cell phone again under the bed mattress and prepared to leave right away.I opened the window of the room, draped in a white T-shirt and a slightly thick cardigan. My breath was shattered white in the cool morning air. Just like last time, I stepped on the window sill and jumped out with my ability.\u2018If you are going to a place where you can have a conversation\u2026 Maybe we\u2019ll go to the Roheon Guild?\u2019I tilted my head, pulling the cardigan fluttering in the wind. If that\u2019s the case, you could just ask me to come to the guild from the beginning.The alley next to the hotel appeared after 20 minutes to the east. Finding Ha Tae-heon\u2019s car parked in the same location as before, I went down to the ground and opened the passenger door.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dI smiled as I looked at Ha Tae-heon, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with his back bent. He was not in a suit for some reason but was wearing a black turtleneck and cotton pants.\u201cAre you going to rest?\u201dAs I sat in the passenger seat and got closer, his slightly wet hair caught my eye. Ha Tae-heon nodded his head and started the car.\u201cWhere are you going? Guild?\u201dWhen I asked while wearing a seat belt, Ha Tae-heon turned his steering wheel and answered indifferently.\u201cHouse.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHouse? Whose house?\u201c\u2026is it Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dSurprised, Ha Tae-heon threw a bombshell and drove in a polite manner.\u201cAre you going to take me to your house? Now?\u201d\u201cWhat can\u2019t be done?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat can\u2019t be\u2026 there\u2019s nothing impossible. I smiled and looked out the window.\u2018However. Our relationship isn\u2019t normal. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good place to talk.\u2019In the novel, Ha Tae-heon did not let anyone in the house, including Lee Joo-ha, who he trusted the most, or Min Ah-rin.Is it okay for me to go to such a great place to talk about uncomfortable things? Is it because I\u2019m not a girl like Lee Joo-han and Min Ah-rin?No matter how much the landlord invited me, it\u2019s too much for a guy like me to go\u2026\u2018\u2026let\u2019s stop.\u2019I thought deeply about the subject that I didn\u2019t even have the courage to tell Ha Tae-heon that it was a burden. I glanced at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s profile reflected in the window and covered my mouth with my hand.\u2018Still.\u2019I felt pretty good. Covering the corners of my lips that kept rising, I coughed in vain. I could feel Ha Tae-heon looking at me for a moment while driving, but I tried to ignore it.* * *Beep, beep. Beep.Ha Tae-heon pressed the door lock password and opened the front door. I followed him in and looked around.\u201cAre you living alone?\u201dI asked while looking around the spacious living room with the grey sofa and black table, Ha Tae-heon nodded his head and held out his hand. I took off my cardigan and handed it to him, smiling broadly.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI put down my butt on the couch and looked around intently. A book that appeared to have been left behind by Ha Tae-heon, a wall-mounted TV seen above the cabinet, and two small cactus flower pots. Overall, the atmosphere was simple and clean.The fact that only the necessary furniture and things were placed firmly seemed to show Ha Tae-heon\u2019s personality. After looking around the living room for a while, Ha Tae-heon, who had left the cardigan and went into the kitchen, returned.\u201cThat\u2026 is that wine?\u201dIn each of his large hands was a bottle of wine and two wine glasses. I was surprised to see the label as I took the bottle of wine that Ha Tae-heon gave me.\u201cCh\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild\u2026 This is a very expensive wine, is that okay to open it?\u201d\u201cI got it as a gift after all.\u201dHa Tae-heon used the opener to remove the cork bottle cap with a look of no interest in wine.I couldn\u2019t believe I was drinking expensive wine, which I prepared only when they came to play while running the bar for years, at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s house. Ha Tae-heon asked me as I smelled the scent in the wine glass.\u201cI don\u2019t have any food prepared to go with it.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine.\u201dWith this level of wine, adding something to it might harm the taste. It was a little disappointing that I didn\u2019t use the decanter, huh.Looking at the red wine in the wine glass with a satisfied smile, I came to my senses later.\u2018\u2026wait. Why did I naturally drink wine?\u2019I didn\u2019t come here for this, right? I put down his wine glass and opened my mouth at the reason I suddenly came.\u201cThat, Ha Tae-heon-ssi. I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cIs the wine bad?\u201d\u201cNo. Wine isn\u2019t the problem\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no other drink.\u201dSo\u2026 what is wine and why are we drinking now\u2026I struggled to open my mouth to Ha Tae-heon, who was sitting opposite me.\u201cActually, the reason I asked to see you today.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dHe cut me off and took a sip of wine with a blunt expression on his face.\u201cIt must be because of the SS-class coat.\u201dEven though I was prepared, my heart sank low with a thump at the word. I let out a sigh and rubbed the back of my neck.\u201c\u2026yes. I think I acted a bit hasty. I didn\u2019t expect that the SS-class coat would hold Ha Tae-heon-ssi. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look away, look at me.\u201dHearing those words, I slightly lifted my head, who was bowing in anxiety, and looked at Ha Tae-heon. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t look as unpleasant as I thought.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re apologizing.\u201d\u201cI heard from Master Lee Joo-ha. Cheon Sa-yeon threatened you with a coat.\u201d\u201cYeah. Just like you said, Master Cheon Sa-yeon threatened to disclose it to the media.\u201dSuddenly, the image of Cheon Sa-yeon, who forced me to tell him what had happened on the island, flashed through my mind. I unconsciously pressed my index finger on the middle of the forehead, which was about to be strengthened.\u201cBut is that something you should apologize for?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said it when we got the coat in the D8 Area. Whatever the reason you approached me, the result was an SS-class item.\u201dAn awkward feeling flooded into Ha Tae-heon\u2019s appearance as he recited what I said. Did I say that so rudely?\u201cThe thing that Cheon Sa-yeon threatened is a matter between me and Cheon Sa-yeon. There\u2019s no need for your apology. I\u2019m trying to find a way to disclose the coat without any problems.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cOr, are the two of you close enough for you to apologize for what Cheon Sa-yeon did?\u201dThere was something sharp in the question. I hastily denied it.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOkay then. Don\u2019t apologize.\u201dAt Ha Tae-heon\u2019s words, I bit my lip and gave strength to the hand that was on my lap. Many complex emotions flooded in.That wasn\u2019t all I had to explain to him. After hesitating a few times, I finally opened my mouth.\u201cIt may sound like an excuse, but Cheon Sa-yeon knew the coat\u2026 I really didn\u2019t know. I understand you doubted me. There are many things to hide\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s my fault that I doubted it just for the thought that it was uncomfortable without any evidence.\u201dBut this time, he didn\u2019t blame me. Ha Tae-heon, who spoke firmly, added a word.\u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll trust you completely. That\u2019s a different matter.\u201d\u201cYes. I know.\u201dI nodded my head at the added word. That\u2019s natural. I had never had such a strong wind.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about this.\u201dHa Tae-heon leaned his body on the back of the sofa and nodded his chin towards the wine glass in front of me.\u201cDrink.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dIs it really the end? Is this an important conversation?In the worst case, I was prepared to get several beatings, so I lifted the wine glass with a puzzle mind.\u2018Is\u2026 Ha Tae-heon doing this because he\u2019s sorry to me?\u2019Anyway, there was no reason to refuse. I sat in front of him and took a sip of wine while watching Ha Tae-heon looking at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dOh, it\u2019s good. As my expression brightened, only then Ha Tae-heon raised the glass of wine again.The silence that came whenever I was with Ha Tae-heon settled in the living room, but it wasn\u2019t as awkward as before. As the time spent with him gradually increased, I might have gotten used to this quiet atmosphere to some extent.\u201cAt that time.\u201dAbout the time the wine glasses were emptied, Ha Tae-heon spoke first, which was rare. After drinking the remaining wine, I put the empty wine glass down on the table and looked at him.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cInside the gate on the Gulupdo Island.\u201dI turned my head to the sudden topic of conversation. Looking at Ha Tae-heon blankly and waiting for the next word, he hesitated for a moment and then continued.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon, he was doing something.\u201d\u201cCheon Sa-yeon?\u201dHe did so many dog-like things that I had no idea what he was talking about. When I didn\u2019t understand and just rolled my eyes, Ha Tae-heon put down the wine glass he drank and added an explanation.\u201cAfter I rescued Master Lee Joo-ha and Master Hong Si-ah from the underground, I went to you right away.\u201d\u201cAh. Did you? Then\u2026\u201dAs I recalled the situation at that time, I felt something strange.\u2018Thanks to Ha Tae-heon cutting off its tentacles, I didn\u2019t die and dealt with the monster. After that, Cheon Sa-yeon, who arrived late, gave me energy\u2026\u2019Thinking that far, an ominous sensation passed through the nape of my neck. Wait a minute. No way.\u201cWith you, who passed out, Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201d\u201cWa, wait a minute!\u201dI couldn\u2019t hear any more, so I hurriedly cut off Ha Tae-heon\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not what Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0thinks!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I got a debuff and was trying to release it. His posture is a bit strange, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could you release it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t want to answer that much, so I averted my gaze. However, Ha Tae-heon was persistent.\u201cI asked how you could release it.\u201dHis hot gaze seemed to pierce my side face. Don\u2019t look at me like that. How can I beat you? After holding on for a while, I finally spit out an answer with a sigh.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t really know either. According to Cheon Sa-yeon, SS-ranks can pass on their energy to the other person.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAs expected, Ha Tae-heon looked at me with a lot of interest. There was a certain ominous feeling in his eyes, so I shook my head resolutely.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhy do you suddenly get energy while drinking wine? And it hurts so much\u2026 It\u2019s not painful, but it\u2019s uncomfortable. I really don\u2019t want to take it under any circumstances. I told Cheon Sa-yeon not to do it, too, but he did it his own way.\u201dFortunately, Ha Tae-heon didn\u2019t force it when I refused with disgust. However, the strangely regrettable thing, it was clear to me that he would try to do it if he had a chance.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have told him\u2026\u2019Swallowing the tears, I regretted what I had done to answer honestly. I just hope that I am not the person who will receive Ha Tae-heon\u2019s energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hm.\u201dKim Young-seok, who stood in front of the screen coughing, started the briefing. Participants in the meeting listened to the information from the exact coordinates of the gate location to the internal size and the found plant-type item materials with a boring look.\u201cThis is the information we have been able to find so far. After that, additional aggregated data will be officially reported to the management headquarters\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Kim Young-seok.\u201d\u201cYe, yes?\u201dWhen the briefing was over, Kim Young-seok, who had said the last word with a somewhat relieved expression, looked up at the sudden call. The one who called him was Cheon Sa-yeon, who listened to the briefing, held his chin in a crooked posture.\u201cThere seems to be a bit of a lack of information on monsters. Is this the answer?\u201dKim Young-seok swallowed dry saliva at the pointed that was pointed out in a relaxed tone.\u2018Calm down. I expected this.\u2019For some reason, he had goosebumps on his back, but Kim Young-seok answered with an indifferent expression.\u201cYes. We don\u2019t have enough time, so it\u2019s hard to grasp more than this.\u201d\u201cYou said you don\u2019t have enough time.\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Cheon Sa-yeon raised one corner of his mouth and laughed. The atmosphere inside the conference room subsided as if cold water was sprayed.\u201cThree days ago\u2026 I heard rumours that the research team belonging to the IMS Guild took the monster corpses and used them for research on making items.\u201d\u201cPardon? Oh, no\u2026\u201dKim Young-seok was greatly embarrassed and broke into a cold sweat. He couldn\u2019t even guess how Cheon Sa-yeon knew information that only the guild leaders, including himself, knew.\u2018Damn, what! Who was betraying me? Maybe from the research team?\u2019Kim Young-seok clenched his teeth after recalling the face of the research team leader who smiled meanly, saying that he would make sure this never leaked out when providing monster corpses. Calm down. There is still a hole to get out of.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Master Cheon Sa-yeon. Isn\u2019t that kind of rumour going around all the time? It\u2019s difficult if you\u2019re just saying this through a rumour.\u201dWhen Kim Young-seok got angry and asked, Cheon Sa-yeon muttered in a dull voice.\u201cBecause it really doesn\u2019t go against my expectations even one inch\u2026\u201dHe tapped the centre of the watch he was wearing. Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the documents that fell from the air.Cheon Sa-yeon, who held his chin with a look of boredom, turned the first page of the document.\u201cMaster Kim Young-seok. You said it well. It\u2019s not okay to beat someone just through rumours.\u201dFlap.\u201cSo I looked it up. I was wondering if it was true that there were ingredients that were stolen and used before they were officially registered.\u201d\u201cWh, what does\u2026!\u201d\u201cTentacle cells. Tentacle fluid. Monster skin. Monster blood. A part of the sword found in the internal organs of the monster\u2026 You also ate a variety of things. Would you like me to continue reading it for you?\u201dKim Young-seok\u2019s face turned pale and cold sweat poured down like rain. Choi Mi-jin, who was listening to Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words, frowned, and Hong Si-ah and Lee Joo-ha sighed.\u201cWait! This is, I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThe gate, which is not too big, was dragged for over a week with all kinds of excuses, so I thought he also prepared something really great. It was rather disappointing to know that it was just this kind of stealing.\u201dAt the harsh criticism, Kim Young-seok shouted with his neck and face dyed red.\u201cWhat do you mean stealing! You there, Master Cheon Sa-yeon!\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t analyze the difference between the participants who were trapped in the egg and the participants who were not, as well as the debuff ability and regeneration ability that monster showed. I understand. You must have been busy stealing the monster corpses.\u201dWhen he pointed out each disturbing part with a soft voice, Kim Young-seok could not even make a proper excuse and took a step back.Cheon Sa-yeon smiled at Kim Young-seok, who was shivering like a cornered rat. However, only the mouth drew the line, contempt and ridicule were deeply revealed in the gaze looking straight ahead.\u201cIt is amazing that there were so many victims of the gate incident and that they did such a thing, Master Kim Young-seok. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you did it right so that we didn\u2019t get caught up in it? Then there wouldn\u2019t have been a situation like this.\u201d\u201cStop it, Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201dChoi Mi-jin, who interrupted in a tired voice with a frown on her forehead, hurriedly organized the meeting.\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon. First, give me the data, and Master Kim Young-seok, please talk to me separately. Today\u2019s meeting ends here.\u201d\u201cYeah~ hard work, hard work.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201dAs soon as the words were finished, Hong Si-ah and Lee Joo-ha got up from their seats without hesitation. Kim Young-seok, who was suspected of committing an illegal act, was called by Choi Mi-jin and caught by an employee.\u201cOhyu, I\u2019m so exhausted.\u201dHong Si-ah, who came out into the hallway with Lee Joo-ha, pressed the elevator button and sighed.\u201cMaster Kim Young-seok did something stupid, but Master Cheon Sa-yeon is no joke either. I know he wasn\u2019t usually interested in things like that.\u201dAt that, Lee Joo-ha nodded her head with a tired face.\u201cYeah. He looks very sensitive today.\u201d\u201cHis personality is filthy, it\u2019s not a day or two, but he does show it obvious today.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Lee Joo-ha rolled her eyes and said.\u201cCome to think of it, even when we ran into each other a few days ago, he seemed in a bad mood. He doesn\u2019t even laugh\u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of the Gulupdo Island Gate? From what he said earlier, it seems that he was aware of what Master Kim Young-seok had done. Why, that A-rank mercenary. Was it Talented Han Yi-gyeol? He worked really hard to catch the monster that came out of the gate, but Kim Young-seok was just trying to skip it without saying thank you.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201dTalented Han Yi-gyeol. Lee Joo-ha heard the name and thought of his soft brown hair. A man with a slender body wrapped in bandages and a sly personality, with an atmosphere that exuded a breath-taking atmosphere.\u201cI guess he cares about the Talented Han Yi-gyeol quite a lot if he gets angry like that instead. So is that why there\u2019s such a rumour going around?\u201d\u201cRumour?\u201dHong Si-ah confirmed that there was no one around and explained noisily.\u201cThe Requiem Guild has a vacant position as a deputy master.\u201d\u201cUung.\u201d\u201cReporters were talking around that Talented Han Yi-gyeol would be seated there. Rumours have already spread.\u201d\u201cTalented Han Yi-gyeol in the position of Deputy Master?\u201dIf true, that would be great news. Hong Si-ah shook her head and opened her mouth to Lee Joo-ha, who was surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s still just a rumour, so I\u2019m not sure\u2026 Looking at the current situation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible. There has never been a person whom Master Cheon Sa-yeon liked so much.\u201dAt that, Lee Joo-ha nodded her head. Surely\u2026 he seemed pretty close to the Master Cheon Sa-yeon. While Han Yi-gyeol was receiving first aid from the healer, Cheon Sa-yeon, who was close to him and did not think of falling, was quite impressive.\u201cBut why does he let him wander around as mercenary instead of joining the guild? If he\u2019s really planning to put him in the deputy master\u2019s seat, it would be more convenient to bring him in as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve felt this for a long time, but it\u2019s really hard to understand Master Cheon Sa-yeon. What is he thinking about when he lives?\u201dLee Joo-ha, who rolled her eyes with a puzzle expression, hinted.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Talented Han Yi-gyeol do not want to join?\u201d\u201cEi. Any reason to hate it? I don\u2019t know about other guilds, but it\u2019s Requiem. Anyway, it\u2019s fun.\u201dLee Joo-ha kept her mouth shut at the feeling of being somewhat complicated. For her, the existence of Han Yi-gyeol, was filled with incomprehensible things from beginning to end.He came up with a brazen smile and poured out all the help he could give to Ha Tae-heon, who was wary. It was a little understandable that Ha Tae-heon, who always maintained the balance of his emotions, kept losing his balance and shaking when he looked at Han Yi-gyeol.\u201cMaster Hong Si-ah.\u201dTriing, at the same time as the sound of the elevator arriving, a voice came from behind. Turning back to her puzzled face, Cheon Sa-yeon was standing there.\u201cUng?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk for a second.\u201d\u201cWith me? Talk?\u201dShe had known Cheon Sa-yeon for several years, but this was the first time this had happened, so Hong Si-ah and Lee Joo-ha look surprised. Looking at the two of them, she smiled as if she was drawn by Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cUm, then\u2026 I\u2019m going first. Master Cheon Sa-yeon, see you next time.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dLee Joo-ha, who was hesitantly watching, got on the elevator and left. Only the two of them left, Hong Si-ah blinked her eyes with interest and asked Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cWhat is it? What are you trying to say so seriously?\u201d\u201cI have a favour to ask.\u201dA favour to ask? Cheon Sa-yeon smiled at Hong Si-ah, who showed her interest, bending his eyebrows.* * *After meeting Ha Tae-heon, the uncomfortable feelings that tormented me for a week had been sorted out to some extent.To be honest, I felt proud. It was not enough to be invited to Ha Tae-heon\u2019s house, which no one had ever been to, but also to have a glass of wine. It wasn\u2019t a bad experience.I should have cleared up the misunderstanding and became closer with Ha Tae-heon. Lying on the sofa with a more relaxed mind, I read the new data that Kim Woo-jin brought.The plan to clear half of the gates belonging to Seoul, which started two months ago, seemed to come to an end. Now, when the remaining half of the gates were also cleared, a gate that was not a gate in which an abnormal phenomenon had occurred could be classified.\u2018Even if that happens, it will be much more stable than it is now.\u2019In other words, you only have to work harder than you have done so far.Is it worth doing? If the gate problem was solved, there would be room to learn about Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s past, which had been delayed.\u201cNot bad.\u201dI closed my eyes and closed the data I was reading. The still silence fell.From noon to evening, Kim Woo-jin also went to the training room, so it was the only me-time. While enjoying the peace that had come after a long time, someone knocked on the door.T/N :Somehow I could imagine Yi-gyeol as Deputy Master of Requiem Guild\u2026 (\u0e51\u2661\u2313\u2661\u0e51)Bad mood!Sa-yeon is a positive sign for his love feeling towards Yi-gyeol\u2026 (\u00b4-\ufe4f-`\uff1b)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAh, oh\u2026\u201dFor some reason, whenever I tried to rest alone, it felt like someone was always visiting me. As I opened the door grumblingly, the attendant dressed in a black suit greeted me politely and opened his mouth.\u201cMaster called you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe good feeling fell into shatter in an instant.Ten days had already passed since the Gulupdo Island Gate incident. In the meantime, I had deliberately turned off my attention from Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s news, so I couldn\u2019t even guess why he was calling me.The words \u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u201d came up to the end of my throat, but I swallowed it and nodded. Anyway, as long as it was a cooperative relationship with Cheon Sa-yeon, there was no way to avoid it.\u2018\u2026let\u2019s just endure it for two months.\u2019If all the gates in Seoul were resolved, this partnership would come to an end. Only then might I be able to get away from Cheon Sa-yeon and left this place.As I headed straight to the top floor following the attendant, I met Woo Seo-hyuk, who just came out of the representative office.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who approached me right away, opened his mouth as he looked at my body from top to bottom.\u201cI heard about the Gulupdo Island incident. It said you were seriously injured.\u201d\u201cI was treated well. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Are you here to see the Master?\u201d\u201cYes. He called me.\u201dAt those words, Woo Seo-hyuk put on a somewhat hesitant expression.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi?\u201d\u201c\u2026just in case, Master is not feeling well today.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI tilted my head at the sudden sound. Not feeling well? Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201cActually, it\u2019s been a few days, not just today.\u201d\u201cUm. Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Even if you come to nitpick for useless things, it is better to understand and move on for today. It can be dangerous if you accidentally touch it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat on earth did you think you were worried about if he felt bad? I replied with an awkward smile.\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll deal with it in moderation. You can\u2019t stop seeing each other just because you don\u2019t want to see them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dAt my words, Woo Seo-hyuk immediately nodded his head and agreed. I had been thinking for a long time, but Woo Seo-hyuk was pretty shameless because it didn\u2019t fit his image.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going now. See you next time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter a brief conversation, Woo Seo-hyuk left, and I, who was left alone, carefully grabbed the doorknob of the representative office.I thought I would only hold out for two months, but when I went in, I only sighed. I opened the door to the representative office, forcing my eyebrows to bloom, which was constantly tense.\u201cYou come.\u201dAs soon as I entered, I saw Cheon Sa-yeon sitting on the sofa and looking at the documents. Cheon Sa-yeon, who found me, put down the documents and smiled softly.What. You said he wasn\u2019t in a good mood. Nothing different from usual, though?\u201cOh, what\u2026\u201dI replied sullenly and sat down on the sofa opposite him. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was looking at me with a smile on his lips, opened his mouth.\u201cDid you have a good rest?\u201d\u201cOh. Why did you call me?\u201dI didn\u2019t want to talk about my recent situation in a leisurely manner. As soon as I jumped to the main topic, Cheon Sa-yeon handed me the document he had just been looking at.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cThis time, it\u2019s a gate to clear at Jayna Guild.\u201dUpon receiving the document and unfolding it, the detailed gate information caught my eye. S-grade gate located in the G5 Area. As I was slowly examining the contents, I frowned at the uncomfortable feeling.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cWhy are you giving this to me?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon slowly tilted his head, perhaps because he noticed the uncomfortable feeling in my words.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you wanted? Jayna Guild Gate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking if you\u2019re giving it to me or if it\u2019s Master Hong Si-ah. Is this a mercenary proposal that was officially sent to me by the Jayna Guild?\u201d\u201cIs that important?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201dIf it was Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s gift, I didn\u2019t intend to receive it. I didn\u2019t know what else he was going to do with this, but I didn\u2019t want to get caught up in troublesome things after being rushed.\u2018Since the Gulupdo Island gate incident, I have also informed Hong Si-ah of my presence, there is no need to forcefully receive the gate that Cheon Sa-yeon gives.\u2019Let\u2019s refuse. When I made that decision, Cheon Sa-yeon answered in a sullen voice.\u201cThis is the document I got from Master Hong Si-ah. If you don\u2019t need it, throw it away.\u201d\u201cA document was given by Master Hong Si-ah? Directly?\u201d\u201c\u2026right.\u201dOh. If that\u2019s the case, then it was an official mercenary proposal.That\u2019s good. I was thinking of going into the gate slowly. Even looking at the list of participants, there was Master Hong Si-ah, right? A satisfied smile came out of nowhere.\u201cIf you\u2019re done, I\u2019m going.\u201dAs I quickly got up from my seat after collecting the documents, Cheon Sa-yeon raised one eyebrow and raised the corner of his mouth. I could see that he was upset.\u201cYou must be in a hurry. It\u2019s been less than five minutes since you came in, but I can see you saying you\u2019re going.\u201d\u201cWhat, please?\u201dI deliberately smiled brightly and affirmed the words that I felt somewhere. I\u2019m busy, so stop talking and let me go, you bastard.\u201cIt\u2019s too much. However, it was only after ten days that we met this time.\u201d\u201cAm I happy to see you for the first time in a while?\u201dWhen I responded in a sarcastic way, Cheon Sa-yeon twisted the corners of his eyes and smiled as if it was fun.\u201cIf you say it like that, I\u2019m really upset, Yi-gyeol-ah.\u201d\u201cHo\u2026\u201dAs if to appease his lover, his face frowned at a quenched tone.It seemed that Woo Seo-hyuk was worried for no reason. In my opinion, Cheon Sa-yeon was very similar to usual. There was still the unlucky thing.\u2018Of course, I\u2019m not the type of person who would make things up without Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u2026\u2019For some reason, I glanced at Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face because I felt uncomfortable. Looking at it this way, unlike the smiling eyes, the forehead seemed to be a bit stiff.\u2018\u2026no, let\u2019s not worry about it.\u2019I seized all of my shaky hearts and firmly cut off my curiosity. Whether Cheon Sa-yeon genuinely smiled or not had nothing to do with me. I didn\u2019t want to get involved in anything else related to him.\u201cGate of G5 Area.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Cheon Sa-yeon spoke another word.\u201cI let Woo Seo-hyeok go. You go together.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cIt has already been agreed upon with Master Hong Si-ah. Take him.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon pushed firmly. I laughed out loud at that. Now, you\u2019re going to attach Woo Seo-hyuk, not Kim Woo-jin, for surveillance.\u2018Right. Do whatever you want.\u2019There was no feeling of disappointment and no desire to protest. Anyway, this time, it was just for checking the gate, so it didn\u2019t matter if surveillance was added.\u201cIt\u2019s been ten minutes. I\u2019m going.\u201dNow I really didn\u2019t want to sit face to face with him. Fortunately, Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t hold me this time either.* * *On the date stated in the document, I headed to G5 Area. I left first, leaving behind Woo Seo-hyuk, who said he had work to do in the morning.After driving for about two hours by taxi, I arrived at the G5 Area, and saw Master Hong Si-ah in the middle of an interview.\u201cWhat is it, Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dI didn\u2019t know anyone except for Hong Si-ah, so I was standing there alone, and I heard an unexpected voice. Looking back, I saw Cha Soo-yeon with her eyes wide open.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhy are you\u2026 Are you the mercenary who said to participate in the gate?\u201dI laughed involuntarily at the pleasant voice.\u201cYes. Is Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u00a0also participating in this gate?\u201d\u201cI followed because Master said she was going. I was surprised. I never thought it would be you.\u201d\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t, I felt awkward because I didn\u2019t know anyone, but it\u2019s nice to meet you like this.\u201dAt those words, Cha Soo-yeon pursed her lips with a sullen expression.\u201cHuhung, you\u2019re good at talking. I haven\u2019t been in touch with you for a while.\u201dOops. Then I remembered the last time I met Cha Soo-yeon. She asked for a number, but the situation went wrong and I turned it down.\u201cUm\u2026 because I\u2019ve been a little busy. If I beg you now, will you give it to me?\u201dCha Soo-yeon snorted when I took out my cell phone, just in case, and said.\u201cWould you mind? I left a long time ago even after I left the bus.\u201d (\ubc84\uc2a4 \ub5a0\ub098\ub3c4 \ud55c\ucc38 \uc804\uc5d0 \ub5a0\ub0ac\ub294\ub370, not sure how to translate it)With the intention of wanting to look at her just once, I stared at Cha Soo-yeon and lowered the end of my eyebrows slightly.\u201cAh, don\u2019t do that. At that time, I was really sorry.\u201dWith a smile as harmless as possible, Iapproached Cha Soo-yeon and held out my cell phone.\u201cIf you give me this time, really! I will keep it for a long time.\u201dAs if the effort paid off, Cha Soo-yeon slightly blushed into her earlobe and pretended to be troubled.\u201cWell, what should I do?\u201d\u201cPlease let it slide once. Give me your number and I\u2019ll\u2026!\u201d\u201cThis guy!\u201dI was trying to get a number by gently flirting with Cha Soo-yeon, but someone roughed me on the shoulder from behind. The culprit was Hong Si-ah, who pressed her upper body so strongly that my waist was bent forward.\u201cOh my, Talented Han Yi-gyeol? Sorry!\u201dHong Si-ah, who checked my face, quickly released my shoulders and said.\u201cI wanted to get rid of someone because I thought some guy was going to get in trouble with our Soo-yeon. I didn\u2019t know you were capable of doing things.\u201dIf that\u2019s the reason. Touching my tingling shoulder, I answered.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. More than that, I\u2019m not joking\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I understand. Isn\u2019t our Soo-yeon pretty? However, we have to enter the gate from now on, so please refrain from it.\u201d\u201cYes? Wait a minute. So this is\u2014\u201dAs I tried to quickly explain the absurd misunderstanding, I stiffened my body. Behind Hong Si-ah, a familiar face appeared. It was Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi? When did you come?\u201d\u201cI arrived about 3 minutes ago.\u201d\u201cOh, then\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi. I have the same opinion as Master Hong Si-ah. It\u2019s good to have a crush on a man and a woman, but please do it after clearing the gate if possible.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMy mouth was wide open in embarrassment. As if they couldn\u2019t even see me, Hong Si-ah and Woo Seo-hyuk shook hands in a friendly atmosphere.\u201cSecretary Woo Seo-hyuk of the Requiem Guild? I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. Please take care while we clear it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201dIn an instant, the misunderstanding was not enough, and the opportunity to explain it flew away. Cha Soo-yeon approached me, standing there stupidly, and whispered with an apologetic expression.\u201cThat\u2019s because our master only sees what she wants to see\u2026 So, do you want me to her for you? You have a lover.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, there was also that problem. I said, covering my eyes with my hand.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0and I are not like that.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to hide it from me. Because I really understand everything. Of course, I used to like Ha Tae-heon-ssi\u00a0a little bit, but that\u2019s really a thing of the past\u2026 I never touch anyone that had been owned by others.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s really not.\u201d\u201cOkay. I got it, so give me your cell phone. I\u2019ll give you my number.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPerhaps because she felt sorry for me, Cha Soo-yeon stopped pretending to be pouty and poked me in the side.\u201cHere you go\u2026\u201dI swallowed my tears and handed the phone to Cha Soo-yeon so that others could not see it. Cha Soo-yeon quickly saved the number at a speed similar to Min Ah-rin. How can you move your fingers so fast? Both were very amazing.\u201cNow, are you all ready? Let\u2019s go now!\u201dMeanwhile, Hong Si-ah, who took the lead, shouted with a bright and lively voice. I stood side by side with Woo Seo-hyuk and Cha Soo-yeon and entered the gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She grinned at my question and showed her ring to her hand.\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty? This little one is quite expensive. It is an A-class buff item.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a buff item\u2026 Does your ability get stronger?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The fire gets stronger. The gates here are all cement and buildings, so there\u2019s nothing wrong for me to be wary.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who could not control the burning fire, seemed to like this place quite a bit.\u201cWould you like to borrow something? Wait. The wind ability is useful\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, thanks. More than that.\u201dShaking my head, I lightly grabbed Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s shoulder, who was rummaging through the leather bag. At that action, Cha Soo-yeon opened her eyes and looked up at me.\u201cAs you may already know, the two of us met for the first time today. Because we\u2019ve been meeting secretly until now.\u201d\u201cUung. Right.\u201dMaybe Cha Soo-yeon, like Ha Tae-heon, was nailed to it because she was afraid that she would go and say something else later. I glanced at Woo Seo-hyuk, who was at the forefront and was having a conversation with Hong Si-ah, and continued.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do such a nuisance, but\u2026 I can\u2019t help it because Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0is here. It\u2019s because he was given to me by Master Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201d\u201cThen, did you say that the person who ordered you to kidnap me is Master Cheon Sa-yeon? To get an SS-grade gate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dCha Soo-yeon knew that it was Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s work because she overheard the conversation between Ha Tae-heon and me at the time she was kidnapped.\u2018It\u2019s fascinating again. That you don\u2019t hate me. Even if I gave you the item in return, it is true that I kidnapped you.\u2019\u2026am I pitiful? When I remembered Cha Soo-yeon, who often looked sad for me, I had reasonable doubts.\u201cIf there\u2019s a person named Woo Seo-hyuk, are you saying that we pretend not to be close?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but somehow it feels a bit\u2026\u201dCha Soo-yeon smiled proudly and nodded her head, I wondered if she could even see my uneasy expression.\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019m good at acting.\u201d\u201cIt does look like that. When I see the interview video appearing, you look so sweet even if your personality is different from the real one\u2026 ouch!\u201dI was immediately hit in the back when I remembered a video of her interviewing with a kind smile in the world and answering honestly. It hurt a lot more than I thought. What hand is so hot?\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cI hit you because it hurts.\u201dWhile rubbing my tingly back, Woo Seo-hyuk returned after talking with Hong Si-ah.\u201cAre you feeling uncomfortable?\u201dWhen Woo Seo-hyuk found me rubbing my back, he tilted his head slightly and asked. Rather than worrying, it was a voice closer to confirm.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cHm, hm.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who was watching Woo Seo-hyuk, secretly went to another place. Woo Seo-hyuk said to me as I looked at Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s back.\u201cI have been ordered to keep Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0safe, so please tell me if there is any discomfort or injury.\u201d\u201cThe order to keep me safe\u2026 Did Master Cheon Sa-yeon make you do that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt\u2019s not about guarding, it\u2019s about monitoring. As I sighed, Woo Seo-hyuk opened his mouth with a calm face.\u201cEven if it\u2019s not an order, I will try my best not to let Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0get hurt.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0is overworked every time you enter the gate.\u201dI smiled awkwardly at the unexpected words and stroked the nape of my neck.\u201cThat much\u2026\u201d\u201cThat much is right. I remember you coming back with serious injuries at every gate you entered recently.\u201dUmm. Come to think of it, both the gates of the N42 Area and the N23 Area that Woo Seo-hyuk and I went into, I came out with fainting. That\u2019s right. It was understandable that he reacted like this.\u201cI will be careful this time.\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t overdo it. I also told Master Hong Si-ah in advance.\u201dI was a little embarrassed by the serious reaction. What kind of conversation did you have with Hong Si-ah for such a long time?\u201cAs long as no abnormalities are found anyway, I don\u2019t see any need to step up. There are two S-rank people.\u201d\u201cI think so too, but there is a high probability that an anomaly was found in the gate where Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0participated.\u201d\u201cYes? How can you\u2026\u201d\u201cI checked the list of gates in which Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0participated. I apologize if I offended you.\u201dWhy were you looking at that? I took a step back and opened up distance with Woo Seo-hyuk due to more interest than expected.\u201cUh, um\u2026 I understand.\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t fall away from me. In case of an emergency, I or Master Hong Si-ah will handle it.\u201dIf my answer was not trustworthy, Woo Seo-hyuk asked me not to come forward again and again. Is it because he is doing this after receiving orders from Cheon Sa-yeon, or is it his personality who has a lot of worries?\u2018I don\u2019t know what it is\u2026\u2019In the meantime, the team that finished the personnel check and weapon check started moving in earnest. At the middle of the line, I followed the team and looked up. The cloudy sky, obscured by grey smoke, fluttered depressed.* * *Krrk, Kirk!Kiaaak!Zombies covered in dust rushed at random, jumping like monkeys between the collapsed buildings. It was an A-grade grey zombie. It was a monster with a clear appearance for a zombie, fast running speed, and incredibly strong power.A-grade close ability monsters had excellent physical abilities, so all of the long-distance team had to step forward to support. The person who showed the most outstanding performance among them was the talented Cha Soo-yeon.A swarm of zombies rushing in was all fired up by Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s ability.Guaaak, kuak! Zombies on fire screamed in pain and went back and forth. Meanwhile, the close team quickly beat the zombies.Zombies were weak against fire, I knew it before but\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was that bad.\u201dIn this gate, several zombie-type monsters exist throughout the city destroyed by disaster, and the level of the monster increased towards the centre. Zombie monsters would unconditionally attack from all directions when their opponents come within a certain radius, so they had to look around without taking time to relax.\u201cOkay~ it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over!\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who succeeded in dealing with even the last zombie, smiled and waved her arm. With my ability, I gathered the roaring zombie corpses in one place.\u201cAs expected of our Soo-yeon. Is it a good thing I brought her?\u201d\u201cAww~ it hurts!\u201dAs Hong Si-ah smiled slyly and pulled Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s soft cheeks, Cha Soo-yeon frowned and grumbled with her aegyo. They looked like real sisters. Maybe it was because Hong Si-ah was older than Cha Soo-yeon and taller than her.A person with a measuring ability who checked the monster rating near the burning zombie corpse reported to Hong Si-ah with a bright face.\u201cThere is no big problem. The numbers are also stable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dPerhaps because Jayna Guild also experienced the anomaly several times, Hong Si-ah, who was listening to the report with her slightly nervous face, nodded her head in relief. Cha Soo-yeon, who was standing next to her, pouted her mouth.\u201cAnyway, there are only zombies in the gate, so what are you so worried about?\u201d\u201cUh-huh. If it\u2019s S-grade, the more careful you are, the better it will, don\u2019t you know?\u201dHong Si-ah poked Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s cheek, which was slightly red in the aftermath of the pull, and looked back at me.\u201cEven the Talented Han Yi-gyeol suffered. As I said back then, the ability is very useful in many ways. Please take care of me until the gate is cleared.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dHong Si-ah, who had controlled Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s fire from going to a harsh place, smiled contentedly at me, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s worthy of a request from Master Cheon Sa-yeon. Thanks to you, I will be able to clear this gate with ease.\u201d\u2026who\u2019s doing what? I asked, reflexively frowned.\u201cWhat did Master Cheon Sa-yeon do for you?\u201d\u201cUng? Did you not hear it?\u201d\u201cYes. Just about go to the gate\u2026\u201dHong Si-ah tilted her head.\u201cReally? Looks like you didn\u2019t. Indeed. He\u2019s not the kind of person who can do something like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026could you please tell me more about it?\u201dAnxious feelings flooded like a tsunami. I felt Woo Seo-hyuk, who was standing next to me, looking at me.\u201cUmm. I don\u2019t have much to tell you in detail. Last week, after the management headquarters meeting, Master Cheon Sa-yeon talked to me. He asked me a favour. I was a little surprised because this was the first time Master Cheon Sa-yeon asked me to do something.\u201d\u201cThat request\u2026 is participating in the gate?\u201d\u201cWhat, you knew? If there is an empty seat at the gate, he asked about hiring Talented Han Yi-gyeol as a mercenary.\u201dSomething hot caught my throat. I remembered Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s shameless face, who said that he would only deliver the documents given by Hong Si-ah.\u2018\u2026what the hell do you want me to do?\u2019Resentful feeling now poked my head out at the actions I couldn\u2019t understand. As a storm raged in my chest, my heart flipped over at random, and strength entered my clenched fists.To me, who could not properly answer my shaking emotions without knowing what to do, Hong Si-ah lightly shrugged her shoulders and added an explanation.\u201cI\u2019m just saying, just because Master Cheon Sa-yeon asked me to do so doesn\u2019t mean I just hired Talented Han Yi-gyeol as a mercenary. Hearing what he said, I thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad, so I accepted it. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026of course. I don\u2019t misunderstand that.\u201dAfter barely coming to my senses and smiling softly, Hong Si-ah gave me a refreshing wink at me and turned her back to the close team. Cha Soo-yeon, who was restless while watching the conversation from behind, could not come closer because of Woo Seo-hyuk and followed Hong Si-ah.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI\u2019m tired. I was standing blankly by the fatigue that came over me in an instant, and Woo Seo-hyuk, who was standing next to me, called me with a low voice.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 what is it?\u201dWhen I answered awkwardly while stroking the nape of my neck, Woo Seo-hyuk, who was worried about something, continued.\u201cDid something happen\u2026 with Master?\u201d\u201cHaha, no.\u201dNo way. I waved my hand and quickly turned away from him. I didn\u2019t want to show my face to the quick-witted Woo Seo-hyuk.An excruciating pain ran up the palm of my hand. As I opened my fist, which I had unconsciously clenched as hard as I could, I saw a mark on my fingernail that was deeply pierced.T/N :As a positive thinking person like me, I think Sa-yeon requested such a favour because he indeed would have a benefit (information) but he also cared about well-being Yi-gyeol. Sa-yeon, as a regressor, didn\u2019t want to see someone just died so easily like ori!Yi-gyeol. Maybe he also was fond of ori!Yigyeol without he realized it and wanted to try again to save this Yi-gyeol?It\u2019s understandable tho if you\u2019re in Yi-gyeol position. They have partner relationship with benefits to each other. But somehow I dislike this part\u2026I know it\u2019s the cause of Sa-yeon giving him bad impression in the beginning but damn it, could you not think so negatively at least once? \u0ca0\ufe35\u0ca0I\u2019m in bad mood after reading around chapter 130\u2026 Excuse me. *Sat at the cornerThank you for following us tho!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt had been two days after entering the gate. I thought I was lucky to have entered the gate.The incomprehensible behaviour of Cheon Sa-yeon was so frustrating that the desire to grab him by the collar and ask questions immediately arose. Obviously, if it was outside where the electronic devices were working, I would have made a phone call first.How did you know Ha Tae-heon\u2019s SS-class coat, for what purpose you threatened him, and why did you get the Jayna Guild Gate\u2026 There were so many things I wanted to ask.This situation didn\u2019t fit his personality (\uc774\ub7f0 \uc0c1\ud669\uc740 \uc601 \uc131\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4, not sure how to translate it). Even if it hurt and made me sick, it was much better to bump into each other and talk.\u2018Of course, that kid wouldn\u2019t be able to tell me about it in gentle way.\u2019Every time I looked at him, I thought of Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s face, who smiled half-heartedly. If I grabbed his collar and asked what the hell were you doing, how would the kid react?\u2018I think I have grabbed him by the neck once last time. What did Cheon Sa-yeon say at that time?\u2019I looked back at my memories while rubbing my forehead. At that time\u2026\u201cHmm. What is this posture? You want me to kiss you?\u201d\u00a0(Chap 26)Oh, this fucking bastard\u2026The flow of serious thoughts that had barely continued was cut off. I let out a shaky breath and shook his head. Nothing really worked out.I thought it would be better to use this gate as an excuse to predict what Cheon Sa-yeon would ask me. Sending me to a very dangerous gate or asking for something that we could do together like the last guild leader meeting.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dWhile struggling for a while, thinking about Cheon Sa-yeon, Woo Seo-hyuk, who had been away for a while, returned. In his hand, there was a drink I had never seen before.\u201cEat it.\u201dEven though it had only been two days since he entered the gate, Woo Seo-hyuk was popular among Jayna guild members. I thought there were a lot of women around Woo Seo-hyuk until just now.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi\u00a0who got it, is it okay if you give it to me?\u201d\u201cThey gave it to me even if I refused, so I don\u2019t care.\u201dAs expected, he had also a shameless side. It was difficult to refuse, so I smiled slightly and took the bottle of drink. The drink with the orange picture on it tasted sour.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to eat something sweet and sour when you are tired.\u201d\u201cSurely it is.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who was sitting on a broken pillar opposite me, pulled something out of his arms and held it out.\u201cI\u2019ll give you this, too.\u201dAs I casually received it, it was a light blue candy item that I had eaten before, which relieved fatigue. It worked so well that I wanted it.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0seemed to never sleep inside the gate. It\u2019s better to eat it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs I put the candy in my mouth and muttered, my mind quickly cooled like the last time.\u201cLike Han Yi-gyeol-ssi, I find it difficult to sleep comfortably inside the gate, so I always carry it with me.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me where you get it this time?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cGive me a few more\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAlright, whatever. While grumbling inwardly, Woo Seo-hyuk added a word different from the last time.\u201cInstead, come to me whenever you need it and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dI didn\u2019t really need it unless I was in the gate.\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d\u201cAs I said back then, there\u2019s a high risk of abuse. If you ask me, I will give you one.\u201dI thought about it while rolling the candy in my mouth. It\u2019s definitely more effective than regular coffee or drinks\u2026\u201cThen how about you give me at least two?\u201dI tried to negotiate, but again, Woo Seo-hyuk was adamant.\u201cNo more than one. There are side effects.\u201d\u201cWhat are the side effects?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better not to know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI looked at Woo Seo-hyuk with salty cold eyes, but he did not open his mouth. That\u2019s why my heart soars to want to know. Next time, I would hold on to people around me and ask. I thought Min Arin, who was a healer and knew a lot, would answer.I smiled broadly thinking about something else. When I didn\u2019t insist on him to tell me anymore, Woo Seo-hyuk showed a relieved look. You\u2019re surprisingly naive.\u201cHm, hm. Han Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201dThen, a familiar voice came from behind. It was Cha Soo-yeon, who had a gloomy expression on her face as if it was awkward to speak formally to me.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAre you okay for a second?\u201dSeeing Cha Soo-yeon, standing crookedly with both hands in the pockets of the leather jacket she was wearing, somehow made me laugh. It was like watching a bad high school student.\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d\u201cI have to pick five people from my team and go to Area B to inspect, but there\u2019s one guild member who is not in good shape.\u201d\u201cAa. I understand.\u201dI realized what she meant and was about to get up, but Woo Seo-hyuk grabbed my arm and interrupted me.\u201cI will go.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol-ssi, please rest. I will go instead.\u201dPerhaps it was an unexpected development, Cha Soo-yeon glanced at me in a visibly bewildered way. Her appearance somehow reminded me of a cat.\u201cNo. I will go.\u201dIf I continued to watch, I thought that even if Cha Soo-yeon was upset later, she would be stubborn, so I smiled and intervened.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi, you have been dealing with monsters since yesterday. I rested without doing anything.\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201d\u201cI have to do this much so I can see it.\u201dAt my words, Woo Seo-hyuk slightly lowered his head. In the meantime, I didn\u2019t know because there was no change in expression, but it seemed that Woo Seo-hyuk had a habit of lowering his head whenever he was worried. His expression was as blunt as it was.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. There will be no danger.\u201dAs I approached Woo Seo-hyuk and whispered, he answered with his upper body slightly tilted forward to match my height.\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d\u201cI will back. Let\u2019s go, Cha Soo-yeon-ssi.\u201dI followed Cha Soo-yeon, leaving behind Woo Seo-hyuk, who was standing idly with a large body. As I headed to the place where the inspection team members were gathered, Cha Soo-yeon said to me in disdain voice.\u201cI heard that the Requiem Master put him in, so he definitely cares a lot about you. He said he would go instead of you.\u201d\u201cUm, he has been ordered\u2026\u201dI thought it was more because I got hurt and passed out on that day. I couldn\u2019t even say this, so I brushed the end of my words and brushed my cheek awkwardly.\u201cWell, anyway. We don\u2019t have to go far, we just check nearby, so it will be over quickly.\u201dAfter showing her a light shrug to indicate not to worry, I greeted the team members lightly. The place we had to go was Area B, which was about a 15-minute walk northeast.\u201cThere is a big mart at Area B. We have to look around inside the mart\u2026 It\u2019s mostly empty, but you still have to be careful. If monsters come, you might be surrounded.\u201dI moved to my destination while listening to the calm explanation given by Cha Soo-yeon by my side.* * *As she said, a large one-story mart appeared. The dark interior of the mart, which could be seen through dozens of broken-down cars and broken windows, gave off an eerie atmosphere.\u201cTwo B-rank people come to the centre, and three A-rank people keep the front, back and sides. It may not be a big deal, but always look around.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dAt Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s words, the team members responded with a strong discipline tone.Oh~ I stood at the back and pretended to be surprised by the appearance, then Cha Soo-yeon opened her sharp eyes and glared at me.In my eyes, Cha Soo-yeon was as cute as a little sister, but Cha Soo-yeon was a famous and popular A-rank talented person. By the way, didn\u2019t she have a nickname? What was it? Was she the Empress of Red Flames?At first, the nickname seemed childish, but now I thought it suited her well.\u201cI will take the lead, so be careful and follow me.\u201dAs a bright red flame burned from Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s hand, the dark inside of the mart brightened up a little.Jjijik.\u00a0As I took a step, a piece of glass lying on the floor was trampled on. The guild members who looked around while holding their weapons with tense expressions sighed.\u201cFortunately, there seems to be nothing.\u201d\u201cBe careful. One or two might be hiding. We\u2019ll go in some more.\u201dI followed the team members. There was a lot of blood on the floor of the mart, and the shelves were empty. As the other team members said, there were no signs of monsters appearing.While continuing to look inside the mart like that, I found something in a dark corner.\u2018\u2026wait, what is that?\u2019I immediately called Cha Soo-yeon, who was in the lead.\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi. Wait a minute.\u201d\u201cUng?\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who approached me, used the fire to reveal where I was pointing. There was a dead zombie with its mouth open and withered.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cThe body is strange.\u201dThere were traces of rough biting on its neck and limbs. Cha Soo-yeon frowned.\u201cThere\u2019s no one on the team who can kill like this. Why did this body come out?\u201dWhen a monster corpse that we didn\u2019t kill came out, it meant that someone other than the team members existed inside the gate. Perhaps she had the same thoughts as me, Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s face became serious.\u201cIs it possible?\u201d\u201cNo one enters the gate managed by the guild unless they are in the right mind. Because it\u2019s illegal. There are always separate people guarding the gate entrance.\u201d\u201cYou mean it\u2019s possible to get in if you can avoid the guard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I have to report it to Master first.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who was bending her knees to examine the body in detail, stretched her body and told the waiting team members.\u201cIt looks like there is nothing more to see, so let\u2019s go back. I\u2019ll report only this monster\u2019s corpse\u2026\u201dSomething gleamed was caught my eyes as I was quietly listening. From the other side, it aimed precisely at Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s forehead, I hurriedly grabbed her wrist and pulled her from the flying object.\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dChaeaeng!As Cha Soo-yeon was held in my arms, a sharp bursting sound was heard from the floor. When I quickly checked, I found that the flying object was a long, pointed needle.\u201cStand back!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dStarting with that, several needles flew at high speed from beyond the darkness. One of the team members standing in the front screamed as a needle was stuck in his forearm.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dCha Soo-yeon came out of my arms and lit a big fire. Knowing the meaning, I raised my ability and engulfed Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s fire with the wind. My ability and Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s ability were combined to create a huge fire in front of us.\u201cIt obscured the enemy\u2019s sight. Take care of the injured during this time and use the firecrackers to help rescue!\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon\u00a0seonbaenim! The monster from behind\u2026!\u201dGuuu, guook!Zombie cries came from the mart entrance. Looking back, I saw dozens of zombie monsters running towards us, where they had been hiding until now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please take care of the zombies behind you.\u201dCha Soo-yeon was more effective than me against zombie monsters. At my words, Cha Soo-yeon nodded her head with a nervous expression.\u201cIf you make a way with the team members, I will follow you. We have to go out of the mart and use the rescue firecrackers.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Cha Soo-yeon stopped her ability and stepped back, the strong flames faded and the needle flew again. I used my energy stronger to build a veil with the wind, but the needle flew through my ability.\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201dI felt a burning pain in the back of my hand. A large needle slipped past, cutting the back of my hand and bleeding.\u2018The attack flies through the ability. Is it S-grade?\u2019I couldn\u2019t even figure out what kind of opponent it was. No one in the novel had this ability. It wasn\u2019t even a gate where such a monster would come out.\u2018Why did such a being suddenly appear? Is it related to Jayna Guild? If not\u2026\u2019A needle aimed at my eye, I bent my neck quickly. The sound of a needle that ripped the skin long and fell to the floor was heard. Blood flowed down my chin with a bitter sensation.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who succeeded in pushing the zombies out of the mart entrance, called me. At the same time, three needles flew at the neck and shoulder.I raised my arms and flew back while covering his face. As I stepped out of the mart, the disgusting smell of burning corpses stung my nose.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe needle stuck in the centre of my palm was pulled out by force. Blood gushed out with throbbing pain.\u201cWhat about rescue assistant?\u201d\u201cI did it. If I hold it for a little while\u2026!\u201d\u201cSeonbaenim!\u201dOne of the team members, who was cutting off the head of the attacking zombie, pointed to the entrance of the mart I had just escaped from.Through the black smoke, something long and tall appeared. A woman dressed in a pink dress, with her yellow blonde hair tied in pigtails and a white apron, looked at us with her hands full of needles.No expression and strangely shiny skin. Cha Soo-yeon stepped back with a pale, tired face.\u201cWhat, is that\u2026 It is a doll?\u201d\u201cAhahaha!\u201dA strange laugh escaped the doll\u2019s mouth.\u00a0Giggle. The doll, which had its neck cut to the side, raised its hand that was covered in red manicure.\u201cArgh!\u201dOne of the team members, who was nervous because of the flying needle, fell forward and was dragged towards the doll. Seeing the thin string wrapped around the screaming team member\u2019s arm, I quickly made the wind like a blade.Piing!The team hurriedly stepped back as the string, which had been pulled tightly, broke. It was then that I discovered a silvery thin string all around us. It was like a spider web.Like me, Cha Soo-yeon, who grasped the situation in an instant, lit a strong fire and burned the string, but the speed was too slow.\u201cIt\u2019s probably an S-grade. A flying needle pierced my ability.\u201d\u201cS-grade? But it\u2019s a doll. Could it be a monster?\u201dI shook my head at Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s words, who looked confused. I couldn\u2019t feel the energy of an S-grade monster. The opponent was just a doll with no vitality.\u201cAhahaha!\u201dThe sound of laughter spread widely and the doll lifted its hands and swung them. The chilling goosebumps soared up the spine and instinctively pushed Cha Soo-yeon, who was next to me.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe string that I had narrowed down aiming for Cha Soo-yeon wrapped around my body strongly instead. I was dragged to the doll while rolling wildly on the floor with my waist and arms caught.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dThe right shoulder was swept to the floor, causing a thick layer of dust to rose. The five needles that the doll put between each of its fingers were raised high towards me. The moment the needle caught the light and flashed.\u201cKkyaaaak!\u201dThe doll was pushed back with a loud sound along with the cry of the beast. Biting my lip in the coming pain, I opened my eyes wide and looked at the person approaching.\u201cWoo Seo-hyuk-ssi.\u201dGrrr.At my call, the giant wolf, Woo Seo-hyuk, cried low and bowed down. I brushed off the broken string and climbed onto Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s back.\u201cTalented Han Yi-gyeol!\u201dHong Si-ah and the guild members who came to see the rescue assistant arrived one after another. Seeing the doll that staggered and raised its body, Hong Si-ah frowned and asked Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It appeared suddenly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a monster.\u201dAfter a certain distance from the doll, I came down from Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s back and said to Hong Si-ah.\u201cI think it\u2019s a puppet controlled by someone.\u201d\u201cA puppeteer\u2026 If it\u2019s playing an S-grade doll, it must be quite talented.\u201dRoar!When Hong Si-ah struck the ground with her whip, the floor cracked with the sound of lightning strikes and cold air rose from the crack.\u201cKyagak! Kyahaaaak!\u201dThe doll lowered its jaw joint long and cried out in a bizarre sound. The open mouth was full of sharp teeth that looked like needles. A dead zombie monster corpse was found inside the mart. Was it the work of that doll?\u201cExcept for Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk, the rest of you move back.\u201d\u201cMaster Hong Si-ah. I will help you from behind like last time.\u201dGrr.Woo Seo-hyuk let out a breath that was displeased with me for not stepping back and shook his tail wildly.\u201cYou got hurt, will you be okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as I answered, Woo Seo-hyuk showed his teeth and growled. It was nice to be transformed into a whole, but it was because he couldn\u2019t speak, it looked frustrating.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will only use my ability.\u201d\u201cOkay. Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk. I understand your feelings, but the first to do is get rid of the doll in front of you. With the help of Talented Han Yi-gyeol, we can handle it faster.\u201dAt Hong Si-ah\u2019s words, Woo Seo-hyuk frowned. It was scary because it was already a huge wolf, but it was even worse when he frowned.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dI\u2019m sure I will listen to his nagging later. Smiling awkwardly, I raised my ability. Woo Seo-hyuk and Hong Si-ah\u2019s bodies were wrapped in the wind while Hong Si-ah swung her whip loudly.Chaeaeng!Several flying needles were blocked by a leather whip and fell down. The doll, which had blown all the needles, opened its mouth wide and pulled out its teeth. When ten were pulled out at once, bright red blood gushed out from the gums.\u201cWhat doll bleeds?\u201dAs if tired of the disgusting sight, Hong Si-ah shook her head and flew forward. After that, Woo Seo-hyuk followed.\u201cAhahahaha!\u201dWhen the doll saw Hong Si-ah and Woo Seo-hyuk running toward it, it burst into a mad smile and crossed its hands.\u00a0Piing, the silver string that had been hanging in the air was pulled tight and blocked the way.\u201cAnnoying!\u201dThe silver string that had been wrapped around was cut in a single stroke by Hong Si-ah. In the meantime, Woo Seo-hyuk, who turned his path slightly and ran to the side, ran towards the doll with his big mouth open.Crack!Red blood gushed out as the doll\u2019s right arm was bitten by Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s teeth. Grasping its crushed arms, the doll opened its chin.\u201cAaaaah! Aaaah!\u201dIt sounded like a child\u2019s cry. Everyone looked displeased at the scream of Ivy that came out of the doll\u2019s mouth (\uc778\ud615\uc758 \uc785\uc5d0\uc11c \ud130\uc838 \ub098\uc624\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ube44\uba85\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \ubd88\ucf8c\ud55c \ud45c\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5c8\ub2e4). Cha Soo-yeon muttered while frowned.\u201cI feel bad\u2026\u201d\u201cHurt! Hurt! It hurts!\u201dDalgak! Dalgak!The doll moved its jaws violently and complained of pain in a child\u2019s voice. Cha Soo-yeon and some guild members covered their mouths with their hands in a cold sweat. My stomach churned as if I was motion sick.\u201cI don\u2019t know who the puppeteer is.\u201dHong Si-ah swung her whip and wrapped around the doll\u2019s ankles and pulled it.\u00a0Kuung!\u00a0A doll with red blood dripping from its arm fell to the floor.\u201cThe taste is awful.\u201dThe doll with a whip that flew straight to its neck quickly avoided it.\u201cTsk!\u201dWith a quick movement, the doll that opened the distance with Hong Si-ah blew the needle it was holding. A needle brushed past Hong Si-ah\u2019s shoulder.Although the needle kept flying, Hong Si-ah did not back down. I concentrated on Hong Si-ah\u2019s movements and raised the strength of the wind a little more.The moment the doll flinched at the sight of Hong Si-ah approaching its nose in an instant, she swung her whip. Just in time, I wound up the whip with the wind to speed it up. Like a snake running for its prey, the whip devoured the doll\u2019s left arm precisely.Crack!Its arms, frozen in the cold, shattered white like a plaster statue. The doll, which had lost both its arms, made a gurgling sound.\u201cHurt! Hurt! I will kill you! I will kill you!\u201dBlood was pouring out of its left arm, which had been released from the cold. The doll poured tears of blood from its eyes and poured the curse on Hong Si-ah with a gloomy voice.While Hong Si-ah was fighting, Woo Seo-hyuk, who was looking for his chance, ran from behind the doll.\u00a0Crack!\u00a0The doll, whose upper body was mercilessly chewed by Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s teeth, drooped.Grr.Woo Seo-hyuk groaned and spat out the doll on the floor. The doll rolling on the dirt floor did not move any more. A continuous stream of blood soaked the ground.\u201cWhew, is it over?\u201dSeeing that the connection between the doll and its magician had been cut, Hong Si-ah let out a sigh of relief. Woo Seo-hyuk hit the doll\u2019s head with his big front paw and walked over to me.\u201cYou have worked hard, Master!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201dThe guild members, who stood back and watched the fight with a worried expression, approached.\u201cFirst, the injured should be treated by the healer and the rest should be prepared for battle. I guess I need to speed up the clearing.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHearing Hong Si-ah\u2019s orders, I looked at the doll lying on the floor. The face of the doll, which was pure white and beautiful, was covered in blood and both eyes were wide open. Anxiety stirred at the strange appearance.At that moment, I felt soft fur on the back of my hand. When I turned around to see, Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s golden eyes were still staring at me in a wolf state.\u201cWhy?\u201dWhen I tilted my head to the gaze that felt something forgiving, Woo Seo-hyuk licked my palm with his big tongue. Only then I remembered the palm that had been pierced by the needle. It was still bleeding.Kkuuung.He whimpered, wagging his tail quickly. I smiled awkwardly as I felt the will to receive treatment from the healer right away.\u201cI\u2019ll come later. Right now, Master Hong Si-ah is being treated and the other guild members are also injured\u2026\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dWhile explaining to Woo Seo-hyuk, who gave me a cold gaze, Cha Soo-yeon approached and grabbed my arm.\u201cWhat are you doing here when you\u2019re injured? Let\u2019s go get treatment.\u201d\u201cUh, no. Wait\u2026\u201dEven though Woo Seo-hyuk was listening next to me, I was dragged to the healer before even pointing out Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s tone, which didn\u2019t feel a sense of distance at all.\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll receive it later\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean when you\u2019re the most wretched?\u201dI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in a mess\u2026So I sat next to Hong Si-ah and was treated by the healer. Behind Cha Soo-yeon, who made a satisfied expression with her arms crossed, Woo Seo-hyuk, who was still in the form of a wolf, sent a pathetic look.T/N :\u2026big wolf!Seo-hyuk\u2026 so cute\u2026 my heart can\u2019t take it\u2026Some sentences didn\u2019t make sense but I hope you still understand the general situation\u2026And this situation\u2019s kinda death flag for Yi-gyeol because the enemy already noticed his presence\u2026The doll probably is in the cover above?Thank you for following us tho!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man, who was watching the video with his chin clenched, tapped the mask on his face with his finger.\u201cThe more I look at it, the more useful it seems\u2026\u201dThe first plan was to use a space movement marble item to move party participants into the Gulupdo Gate at once. And there, he found an A-rank talented person.He sent the doll to Jayna Guild Gate to find out more and the results were very satisfying.It was the ability to use the wind to perfectly assist the same team. Perhaps it had a connection with the man, the doll sitting on the desk said, moving its jaw joint.\u201cI want it. I want.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cBring it. I think it will be fun.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll help you! I want my children to fly freely in the sky too. I think it will look so pretty.\u201dA pretty doll the size of a child with a frilled bonnet chattered. The man, who had listened to it, slowly crossed his legs and turned the chair around and looked behind him.\u201cWhat do you think, Master Kang Seung-geon? Do you know this talented person?\u201d\u201cUh, oh\u2026?\u201dKang Seung-geon, who was crouching down on his knees, looked up at the man\u2019s question. Kang Seung-geon stuttered in reply with a blurry expression on his face.\u201cI, don\u2019t know\u2026 such a talented person\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, my. Master Kang Seung-geon, you really don\u2019t know anything.\u201dIn a disappointing tone, Kang Seung-geon broke out in a cold sweat with a pale face in an instant. Kang Seung-geon, who quickly lowered his face again, began to hit his forehead strongly on the floor.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u201dThud! Thud! Thud!The man didn\u2019t stop Kang Seung-geon from acting like that. As if listening to sweet music, the man watching Kang Seung-geon\u2019s head pounding with humming sound only opened his mouth after Kang Seung-geon\u2019s face was stained with blood.\u201cIndeed. Are you incompetent because you want to be incompetent? You were born that way I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cTh, thank you.\u201d\u201cDid you say Master Cheon Sa-yeon of Requiem? From the looks of it, he seems to be friendly with that wind ability. Master Kang Seung-geon doesn\u2019t have the ability to see talent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKang Seung-geon\u2019s face, which had been dazed the whole time, was distorted for the first time at the man\u2019s words. His deeply ingrained sense of inferiority didn\u2019t go away no matter how much he rubbed his brain. Seeing this, the man let out a light smile through the mask.\u201cDon\u2019t be so heartbroken, Master Kang Seung-geon. Can\u2019t we just take it from the Master Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 take, take it away\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. What would be difficult? It seems possible enough to me.\u201dStealing the wind ability from Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026?\u2026yeah, what\u2019s wrong with that? The man is right.\u00a0Kang Seung-gun raised the corner of his lips.\u201cYes, yes! Let, let me meet him. Meet\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s meet. Don\u2019t do any other nonsense, just hold on well until I come. While having some conversations\u2026 Do you know what I mean?\u201dKang Seung-geon nodded his head hastily. His body shook as if he was about to run out and catch the talented man at any moment.\u201cAbel.\u201d\u201cUung?\u201dThe doll\u2019s head, which was watching the man and Kang Seung-geon while waving its legs sticking out under the desk, tilted. Facing its deep purple eyes looking at him, the man made a suggestion.\u201cHow about using Karen (\uce74\ub80c\uc744)?\u201d\u201cKaren? It\u2019s such a waste.\u201dThe man continued to soothe the undesirable voice.\u201cYou said you want to have it. You have to invest that much.\u201d\u201cHuung.\u201d\u201cIt would have been easier if I had moved on my own, but\u2026 I have to go report. We will have to use Karen or something to keep them properly while I come.\u201dDalgak. Dalgak.The doll, which had moved its chin as if contemplating, nodded its head.\u201cOkay. Because you said you\u2019d help me.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dThe man nodded with satisfaction and said to Kang Seung-geon.\u201cGo. I look forward to it, Master Kang Seung-geon.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dKang Seung-geon hurriedly left the room. The man averted his gaze and pressed the button on the remote control. A different video from before was played on the screen that filled one side of the wall.[Look, good\u2026 this bastard,\u00a0ya.]Uhum, hum.\u00a0With a soft hum, the man leaned his back long on the chair. He was very much looking forward to the new toy that he would meet soon.* * *After the appearance of the mysterious doll, Hong Si-ah greatly reduced the break time and spurred on clearing the gate. Thus, at dawn on the third day, we were able to get to the gate exit after clearing out all the zombie monsters.\u201cEveryone worked hard.\u201dHong Si-ah, who came out of the gate, was the first to say a word to the team members who were tired of fighting without a break. Hong Si-ah, who moved and fought the most in the lead, was the same as usual, except that her skin became slightly rough.\u201cMaster.\u201dJayna Guild Deputy Master, Kim Na-yul ran straight from the other side. The area around the gate had already been controlled and there was no one except for a few security guards.\u201cDo you have a good trip?\u201dKim Na-yul gave me a slight eye greeting and approached Hong Si-ah and asked. Hong Si-ah, who nodded her head lightly, accepted the red snakeskin clutch bag handed to her by Kim Na-yul.\u201cI think I should go straight to the guild headquarters.\u201dHong Si-ah said while putting the whip she was holding into the clutch bag. I was wondering what it was and it looked like the inventory.\u201cGuild headquarters?\u201d\u201cSomething happened inside the gate.\u201dHong Si-ah, who returned the clutch bag to Kim Na-yul, who was wondering with her eyes wide open, looked at Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cSecretary Woo Seo-hyuk. Should I report this incident to Master Cheon Sa-yeon?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUmm.\u201dIn response to the resolute answer, Hong Si-ah scratched the back of her head with a complicated expression. Hong Si-ah thought about it for a while and then she sighed as if she had given up, she said.\u201cWell, I have to inform the management office anyway, but that\u2019s it. Can I talk to you before I report? Our Deputy Master, Kim Na-yul, too.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dIt happened at the gate belonging to the Jayna Guild, so the position with Woo Seo-hyuk, another guild, was ambiguous. Obviously, Woo Seo-hyuk would try to report in detail from one to ten. Cheon Sa-yeon would want it, too.Hong Si-ah, Kim Na-yul, and Woo Seo-hyuk moved to a distant place so that no one was listening together and started a conversation. Hopefully, we should be able to agree without any problems.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dAfter Woo Seo-hyuk was away, Cha Soo-yeon came straight to me. Cha Soo-yeon, who glanced around, asked quietly.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhat do you mean? I tilted my head to the absurd question.\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m going to rest? I have nothing more to do here.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. why?\u201dCha Soo-yeon licked her lips and hesitated. When I asked the reason for the look on her face with a simple look, she said, avoiding my gaze.\u201cNo, if you\u2019re not that tired, I thought we\u2019d go eat something together. You haven\u2019t eaten properly for over three days because you were running around the gate.\u201d\u201cDo you want to eat?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201dI was a little tired, but not enough to refuse a meal. What are you talking about with your eyes like this?\u201cGreat. What do you want to eat?\u201dAs I obediently agreed, Cha Soo-yeon smiled broadly and her cat-like eyes lit up.\u201cPizza! With spaghetti! The one with a lot of cheese in it!\u201d\u201cDo you like Western food?\u201d\u201cI usually don\u2019t eat well because I\u2019m on a diet\u2026 Whenever I go to the gate, I crave for it.\u201dUm. There were foods that you wanted to eat when your body suffered.\u201cThere\u2019s a store I know well. Although the inside is a bit small, it is run by a well-known chef, so the taste is good.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then right away\u2026 ah, wait.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who was talking, took out her cell phone from her pocket. Seeing it vibrating, it was as if there was a phone call.\u201cHello?\u00a0Ung.\u201dCha Soo-yeon brought her cell phone to her ear and sent her eyes to me to wait for a moment. I waved my hand to take the call and come without worry, and she turned her back and walked over.Naturally, I was left alone, so I looked around and waited for Cha Soo-yeon. I had an unexpected schedule, but it wasn\u2019t bad as I had nothing to do except return to the Requiem Guild anyway.\u2018But in that case, how should I tell Woo Seo-hyuk-ssi?\u2019If I went out to dinner with Cha Soo-yeon, I was sure there would be a strange misunderstanding. But I couldn\u2019t go without saying anything\u2026While I was thinking about how to say that I was going to eat with Cha Soo-yeon without misunderstanding, I heard an unfamiliar voice from behind.\u201cHe, hey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dTurning my head, I saw a man who looked like I had seen before, looking pale and tired. Are you calling me?\u201cTalented Han Yi-gyeol, right?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dNo one could come in here. When asking the question out of curiosity, the man contorted his face badly.\u201cYou don\u2019t know me?\u201d\u201c\u2026ah.\u201dI remembered when I saw that offended expression on his face.\u201cMaster Kang Seung-geon?\u201dAs I pretended to know, Kang Seung-geon twisted his mouth and smiled, saying that it was right. Pale face with dark circles. It looked very bad.\u201cAre you here to meet Master Hong Si-ah?\u201d\u201cHong Si-ah\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. Master Hong Si-ah is over there.\u201dWhen asked, instead of answering, Kang Seung-geon bowed his head and giggled. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201cAre you okay?\u201dI didn\u2019t think he was in his right mind. For some reason, I was reluctant to approach Kang Seung-geon more than necessary. Kang Seung-geon, who didn\u2019t even pretend to listen to me and murmured with his head bowed, said in a cold sweat.\u201cCough, yes. It\u2019s true that I came to meet Master Hong Si-ah. I have an urgent matter related to the guild\u2026 As you can see, I\u2019m not feeling well, so I\u2019d like some support.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDo you want me to support you? I frowned, unable to answer. I didn\u2019t want to think like this for a sick person, but honestly, I felt uncomfortable.I looked at Kang Seung-geon\u2019s appearance calmly. A lot of messy attire, a dull face, a continuous sweat, and an anxious gaze. Either way, it was suspicious.\u2018Come to think of it, I saw Kang Seung-geon at the hotel party back then.\u2019Now that I think about it, even that was suspicious.\u201c\u2026I apologize, but I can\u2019t leave my seat right now. I\u2019ll call the bodyguard instead.\u201d\u201cNo. I wish you could help. You can do the support right away.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201dKang Seung-geon ran towards me with great speed and grabbed my arm. His strong grip brought pain.\u201cLet go.\u201dAs expected, it didn\u2019t feel good. I clenched my teeth and gave strength to escape, but Kang Seung-geon didn\u2019t let go of my hand but held it more and more strongly. A strong pain ran up his arm.\u201cDamn it, you quick-witted bastard. What? Call the bodyguard? Fucking bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Kang Seung-geon, kugh! Let go of this\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! This bastard, that bastard, look at someone funny\u2026\u201dIt didn\u2019t make sense. Kang Seung-geon, who was quickly exasperated and exhaling harshly, ran through his pocket with the other hand. What he took out was a syringe with an unknown liquid.\u201cKang Seung\u2026 ugh!\u201dAs I was about to scream, Kang Seung-geon, who immediately noticed the movement, inserted a syringe into my neck without hesitation. Goosebumps erupted all over my body and then a tingling sensation spread from my neck in an instant.\u201cGasp\u2026\u201dKang Seung-geon took my body, which was shaking as the strength in my legs were weak.

Karen in red shoes\u201cYou\u2019ve waited a long\u2026\u00a0ung?\u201dWhen Cha Soo-yeon returned from the call, the place she thought Han Yi-gyeol would be in was empty and she looked around in bewilderment.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201dShe called his name just in case, but the person she was looking for didn\u2019t appear.\u201cWhat, where did he go?\u201dShe wondered if he was called by the master, so she turned her gaze to Hong Si-ah, but she saw only Kim Na-yul and Woo Seo-hyuk by her side. What, really?\u201cNo way\u2026 he didn\u2019t run away, did he?\u201dShe felt a strange sense of anxiety. She muttered jokingly, but she knew that Han Yi-gyeol wasn\u2019t the kind of person to run away without a word. So, what is the essence of this unknown anxiety?Cha Soo-yeon immediately picked up her cell phone and dialled Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s number that she had saved before entering the gate.Trr\u2014trrr\u2014tuk.The beep that had been well connected suddenly cut off. Cha Soo-yeon, with a frown on her brow, immediately tried to connect the call again, but she heard a voice telling her that the phone was turned off.\u2018Is your cell phone turned off?\u2019When the third connection also failed, Cha Soo-yeon folded her arms and sighed.\u201cWhat, really.\u201dShe didn\u2019t feel very good. She was thinking about what to do with this situation, and Woo Seo-hyuk, who had finished talking with Hong Si-ah, approached her. When only Cha Soo-yeon was standing in the place where Han Yi-gyeol was, he looked around and asked Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cWhere did Han Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0go?\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dAs Cha Soo-yeon hesitated with a troubled face, Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s black eyes subsided coldly. When the atmosphere between Woo Seo-hyuk and Cha Soo-yeon became strange, Hong Si-ah, who was passing by, intervened.\u201cWhat. What is it? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who had been hesitating, opened her mouth carefully.\u201cThat\u2019s because I can\u2019t see Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cTalented Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cYes. He was just here waiting while I was talking on the phone\u2026 he promised to go out to dinner with me.\u201d\u201cUum?\u201dHong Si-ah tilted her head. It was quite surprising that Cha Soo-yeon called the talented Han Yi-gyeol by name and even made an appointment for a meal together, but let\u2019s put that aside.\u201cI don\u2019t think Talented Han Yi-gyeol would have made a promise and left without a word.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cMaster Hong Si-ah.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who was quietly listening to the conversation, spoke in a lower voice.\u201cJust in case, can you check who was here?\u201d\u201cHm. Wait a minute.\u201dAfter thinking for a while at Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s request, Hong Si-ah called someone. He was an employee managing the entrance to the G5 Area.Hong Si-ah asked the employee who ran to her with a very nervous expression.\u201cYou\u2019re recording a visitor list, right?\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cIs there anyone other than the clear team?\u201d\u201cAh, Master Kang Seung-geon of the Blun Guild came a while ago.\u201dCha Soo-yeon and Woo Seo-hyuk, as well as Hong Si-ah, were hardened at the name that no one could have thought of.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s Master Kang Seung-geon?\u201d\u201cYes. He also signed the visitor list.\u201d\u201cIs he already leaving?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDid you make sure he left?\u201dThe employee, who was very nervous at the noticeably changed voice of Hong Si-ah, looked carefully at her eyes and answered carefully.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see him leaving.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay. You can go.\u201dThe employee ran away with a relieved expression. Hong Si-ah, who had usually had a playful expression on her face, called out to Kim Na-yul.\u201cDeputy Master! Have you got the combat gloves I gave you as a gift before? Can you lend me a minute?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dKim Na-yul, who was talking with the healer team, hurriedly approached at Hong Si-ah\u2019s request and took out combat gloves from her inventory necklace and held it out.\u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to use it. Soo-yeon-ah, where was the spot that Talented Han Yi-gyeol was standing?\u201d\u201cUum, roughly\u2026 around here.\u201dWhen Cha Soo-yeon touched the ground, Hong Si-ah rolled up her sleeves and wore the black leather gloves.\u00a0Huu, taking a deep breath, Hong Si-ah slammed her fist on the floor with her tightly clenched fist.Kuung!The hard ground collapsed helplessly, revealing a space wide enough for three adults to fit under it. The eyes of four people looked down.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected.\u201dHong Si-ah frowned. If it was a normal land, she could easily destroy it without using amplification items, but if it was a land blocked by the same S-rank Kang Seung-geon, basic physical strength was not enough. She tried wearing amplification items just in case and it wasn\u2019t a bad choice.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the methods that Master Kang Seung-geon uses. Making a passage in the ground and moving around. Only when we came in, we had to go through the entrance to find Han Yi-gyeol, but when he ran away, there was no need for that.\u201dCha Soo-yeon asked with a confused voice at Hong Si-ah\u2019s explanation.\u201cAre you saying that Master Kang Seung-geon kidnapped Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cLooking at the current situation, it seems to be the case.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 for what reason is Master Kang Seung-gun kidnapping Han Yi-gyeol?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious too, but let\u2019s fix it first. Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201dHong Si-ah took off the gloves and handed them to Kim Na-yul and said.\u201cAre you going to contact Master Cheon Sa-yeon right away?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSince something like this has happened at the place I manage, I\u2019ll do my best to help as much as I can. Let me know if you find out anything. We will do the same.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dWoo Seo-hyuk, who had never shown any expression before, nodded his head with a cold look and then quickly turned his back. Cha Soo-yeon, who was listening to their conversation, looked around and took out her cell phone and called someone.Fortunately, the call connection sound didn\u2019t last long. As soon as she confirmed that the other person received it, Cha Soo-yeon opened her mouth.\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble, Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d* * *Kim Woo-jin looked at the document in front of him for a moment, then raised his head and asked the other person.\u201cRenewal\u2026 contract?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon answered with a light smile.It had been a long time since Kim Woo-jin visited the representative office alone.He used to be afraid that Cheon Sa-yeon would throw himself out of use whenever he came to the office.However, it was different now. Kim Woo-jin was most afraid of being abandoned by Han Yi-gyeol, not Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cYou\u2019ve also built up some skills and proficiency, so I can\u2019t just leave the pattern alone as an attendant forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s read it first and talk slowly about what we need to discuss.\u201dAt those words, Kim Woo-jin took the document and read it slowly. Physics Support Team (\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc6d0\ud300). It was one of the departments made up of physical talents and was mainly a place where dispatch missions were given to other guilds.\u201cIf you think about the usefulness of your ability, you can go to a better place rather than the support team, but then you will be that much busier. If that\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019ll consider another team.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAs Cheon Sa-yeon said, the support team had a few tasks relatively. It could be considered as caring. Kim Woo-jin replied while looking into Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s eyes.\u201cThis place is good.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dKim Woo-jin remembered Han Yi-gyeol with a bitter heart. From the moment he found out that his rank had gone up anyway, he expected that it would be difficult to stay by his side like before.If he told Han Yi-gyeol what happened today, he was sure he would congratulate him\u2026 He honestly wasn\u2019t very happy with himself. If he entered the gate, he wouldn\u2019t meet Han Yi-gyeol for at least three days. If the timing wasn\u2019t right, they might not see each other for more than a week.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019Because Han Yi-gyeol liked money. If he worked hard and found a house that the two of them could live in, wouldn\u2019t he praise him for doing a good job? As he said, he couldn\u2019t stay in the Requiem Guild forever.Kim Woo-jin, who made up his heart, had just finished signing the document. Cheon Sa-yeon took out his vibrating cell phone and answered the call.[Master.]\u201cSay it.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who had improved in physical ability compared to the general public as he reached A-rank, was able to listen to the phone call without difficulty. He was contemplating whether he should leave his seat, but Woo Seo-hyuk, who called the Cheon Sa-yeon, hurriedly brought up the subject.[Something went wrong.]\u201cWhat is it?\u201d[\u2026Han Yi-gyeol-ssi.]Kim Woo-jin, who was looking at the document, suddenly lifted his head. Cheon Sa-yeon also narrowed his eyes and waited for the next word.[Disappeared.]\u201cDisappeared?\u201d[Yes. Master Hong Si-ah said that Master Kang Seung-geon seems to have kidnapped him. Evidence has been found that Master Kang Seung-geon used his ability to escape the area.]Kidnapped? Did Han Yi-gyeol get kidnapped?Kim Woo-jin stood up with his face hardened at the shocking content. Cheon Sa-yeon, whose smile disappeared from his lips, opened his mouth with a calm voice.\u201cIf Master Hong Si-ah said that, he must have had a certain degree of certainty. Where\u2019s the location?\u201d[\u2026I\u2019m sorry.]Cheon Sa-yeon closed his eyes for a moment and organized his thoughts. Soon after, he ordered Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cI\u2019ll send you a coordinate in five minutes. Go straight there.\u201d[Yes.]After finishing the call, Cheon Sa-yeon immediately called someone else.\u00a0Click. The call was connected and an unfamiliar voice was heard.[Long time no see, N89.]The woman\u2019s cold voice was extremely businesslike. Cheon Sa-yeon said, tapping his finger on the sofa armrest.\u201cPlease do a search for the item location.\u201d[Please tell the code.]\u201cC-29835. It is A-class and in the form of a bracelet.\u201d[An item was searched with the corresponding code.]Then the woman called the coordinates. Cheon Sa-yeon, who hung up the phone without answering, got up. Kim Woo-jin, who noticed that he was going to Han Yi-gyeol, said hurriedly.\u201cI will go too, Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon looked at Kim Woo-jin as if judging something. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s dry saliva went over at the gaze that showed no emotion.Cheon Sa-yeon, who he knew, was basically well-mannered and affectionate at first glance, but that was only his outward appearance. Ever since he first received an offer from Cheon Sa-yeon and joined the guild, Kim Woojin had never felt comfortable with him for a single moment.\u201cWell, that wouldn\u2019t be bad. It might be a good opportunity to test your ability.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven now. Even after hearing that Han Yi-gyeol had been kidnapped, he was always cool and rational. He was different from his restless self.\u201cYes.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who barely responded as if squeezing it, walked after Cheon Sa-yeon.\u2018Han Yi-gyeol.\u2019Feeling his heart beating nervously with worry and anxiety, Kim Woo-jin bit his lip. Please.Please, everything should be fine.T/N :I just read all the comments, I\u2019m sorry for the late reply, guys. But your usual likes and comments really give me a strength to keep translating this series and publish it on time. :\u2019)If you kinda dislike Woo-jin for being useless for Yi-gyeol (I think about this sometime too lol), please come back to read this arc because he will rescue Yi-gyeol. The MLs always have their shining(?) time and Author-nim already set them proportionally with their own capabilities to help Yi-gyeol in many ways. ^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A rough concrete floor was seen with a blurred view.It was only then that I remembered that I passed out after being hit with the syringe Master Kang Seung-geon took out.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dAs soon as I regained consciousness, aching pain poured all over my body as if it had been waiting. My arms were tied behind my back, so I was severely numb and uncomfortable. There was no sign of it coming loose, even if I put strength on it.I immediately tried to raise my energy to use the ability, but it didn\u2019t fill up as if something was blocking it. The straps that bind both arms were like a shutter item that blocked the wearer\u2019s energy.He was doing all sorts of things. Well, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d kidnap me and let me use my ability\u2026\u2018I\u2019m sure it\u2019s planned.\u2019I couldn\u2019t believe he prepared a shutter item. Fortunately, my legs were not tied, but it was difficult to escape in this state.I remembered the last time I saw him before I lost consciousness, the hysterical figure of Kang Seung-geon. This was the second time I had met him properly since the C13 Area. I saw him at the party, but it was a momentary moment, so I didn\u2019t think we met face-to-face.He was a crazy bastard wherever I looked at him, but he was so careless. I never imagined that a guild master would kidnap a person so openly.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dI forced my upper body to stand up. As I moved my body to see if there was still any medicine left, my eyes trembled with a stiff sensation in my neck.As I bowed my head and picked my breath, with the sound of the iron door opening, someone stepped down the stairs and came down.\u201cYou woke up.\u201dIt was Master Kang Seung-geon with dry lips and dark circles under his eyes. He was dressed in a white suit that was too burdensome to look at. I inadvertently frowned.\u2018He\u2019s like that\u2026 isn\u2019t he skinny?\u2019When I first saw him in the C13 Area, I thought he had a more rounded body.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me with those eyes. Since then, I think I have brought you in very gentlemanly. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dKang Seung-geon said, touching his body like a zombie. I closed my eyes slowly and opened them, then asked calmly.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? This is my second time seeing Master Kang Seung-geon.\u201d\u201cWe meet for the second time?\u201dKang Seung-geon looked at me with laughter. However, the eyes were out of focus somewhere.\u201cDon\u2019t lie. You saw me, right? At that fucking party.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck\u2026 come to think of it, if it wasn\u2019t for these bastards\u2026\u201dKang Seung-geon, who was shooting with a poisonous voice, suddenly bowed his head and started muttering something. I swallowed my dry saliva, feeling an ominous sensation coming up. Cold sweat ran down my chin as I felt the pain rising from my arm.The cool atmosphere surrounding the area was not very good. Kang Seung-geon was much crazier than I thought.I don\u2019t know why, but I thought that it was very dangerous to be alone with him while being tied up.\u201cHey there, Kang Seung-geon, ugh\u2026!\u201dKuung!Kang Seung-geon, who was standing still like a crazy person, rushed at me with great speed. Falling to the side helplessly in a tied state, I immediately clenched my teeth at the intense pain I felt on the back of my head.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m funny too? Cheeky bastards\u2026 This bastard or that bastard, one of them\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, Uugh!\u201dAs Kang Seung-geon applied strength to his hand, the sharp pain intensified as if my scalp was going to fall off. It was difficult to calmly deal with the unpredictable and violent behaviour.I twisted to get out, but Kang Seung-geun, who was holding me back, never made me dream and suppressed me. As he exhaled his rough breath, Kang Seung-geon opened his mouth with a shrill voice.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious to bastards like you. Since Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s doing a good job to you, so you\u2019ve been installed without knowing anything, fuck.\u201d (\ucc9c\uc0ac\uc5f0\uc774 \uc880 \uc798\ud574 \uc8fc\ub2c8\uae4c \ubb63\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub974\uace0 \uc124\uce58\ub294 \uaf34\uc740, not sure what\u2019s he talking about)\u201cGasp,\u00a0keuk\u2026 .\u201d\u201cCheon Sa-yeon, you fools blinded by that dirty orphan.\u201dDirty Orphan.At those words, I opened my eyes, which kept closing in pain. Kang Seung-geon, whose face was flushed with excitement, was seen in my blurred vision with tears welling up.\u201cWhat a dirty orphan!\u201dWhen we first met, he said that to Cheon Sa-yeon. What did he mean by a dirty orphan. I laughed openly at Kang Seung-geon and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 my personality is basically this shit.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, an orphan like Cheon Sa-yeon is far better than a madman with a sense of inferiority like you\u2014\u201dBefore I could finish speaking, my eyes flickered and a strong shock shook my head.\u00a0Bang!\u00a0Before the pain could go away, Kang Seung-geon banged my head against the wall once more.\u00a0Piiii\u2014 Tinnitus filled my ears, and hot, sticky stuff poured down my face.\u201cFuck you bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cGasp\u2026\u201dThe droopy body trembled and blood from my head ran down my cheeks.Every time Kang Seung-geon shouted and grabbed my collar and shook it, the sensation of being hit in the head with a hammer followed. A strange voice was heard in the midst of the consciousness that kept cutting off like a film.\u201cI knew this was going to happen.\u201dA woman with her wavy brown hair hanging down was standing there looking at me in her bright red shoes. With her arms crossed in a stiff motion, she said in a youthful voice that did not suit her tall height.\u201cHave you already noticed the emotional domination side effects? I should have guessed from the time I put the piglets in, but in the meantime, this accident happened.\u201dKang Seung-geon\u2019s movements suddenly stopped. His face, which had been severely distorted by anger, began to unravel when a woman appeared.\u201cUh\u2026 uh, oh. We, well, no\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dKang Seung-geon stuttered to the end and hurriedly fell from me. It was very strange to see him as if I was looking at another person.To such Kang Seung-geon, the woman gave an order in a pathetic tone.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Won\u2019t go out? Guard the underground entrance. Don\u2019t annoy me.\u201dKang Seung-geon, who was standing still, ran out without looking back.\u00a0Kkiiik, clock!\u00a0I looked at the woman as I heard the iron door closing.\u2018That woman, something\u2026\u2019Even just looking at it, a foreign feeling of rejection came over me. It was a feeling I had never felt before.Clack. Clack.The woman stepped forward with the sound of her heels. The woman bent over and pushed her face closer to me, lying on the floor. I stopped breathing for a moment and instinctively pulled my body back.Non-blinking eyes. An inorganic appearance that didn\u2019t feel excessively smooth skin and no vitality.\u201cDoll\u2026\u201d\u201cHi? See you again.\u201dHearing my whisper, the doll opened its mouth with a voice full of interest. When I looked closely at it, the corners of its mouth were connected to its chin. It opened its mouth like a human, but couldn\u2019t hide the subtle creak.\u201cI should have come to see you sooner. I was late thinking about what to wear for Karen, and that stinky piglet thing happened. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, you weren\u2019t seriously injured, were you? You won\u2019t die at this rate\u2026 Don\u2019t get too mad. If you continue bleeding, I\u2019ll sew it up for you later.\u201dThe doll\u2019s eyes gleamed grotesquely in the light of pure white light. A creepy feeling of terror ran through the nape of my neck. I had goosebumps as my back, wet with a cold sweat, became cold.\u201cAre you scared? So cute! The more I see it, the more I like it. Samael would love it too. It\u2019s a pity that I ended up using the saved Karen\u2026 Well, there is nothing I can do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSamael? Karen? I couldn\u2019t understand what the doll was saying. Seeing me confused, the doll snorted and straightened its bent waist.\u201cThen see you later~\u201dIt left the room without any regrets, just like when a doll with a cheerful greeting came in. Being left alone, I let out a hot breath and let my tensed body hang down.\u2018Tired\u2026\u2019It had been a long time since I thought it was hard to handle. Feeling the pain and fatigue in my head at the same time, I closed my eyes.* * *\u201cMaster.\u201dWhen Cheon Sa-yeon and Kim Woo-jin got out of the car, Woo Seo-hyuk, who had come first and was waiting, hurriedly approached. Hong Si-ah and Cha Soo-yeon were also there.Cheon Sa-yeon, who looked around them once, omitted the greeting and immediately brought up the main topic.\u201cWhat\u2019s suspicious?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t find it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe place they arrived was in front of an empty building, not far from the Blun Guild. Cheon Sa-yeon knew who the owner of this building was.\u201cIs it true that there is Talented Han Yi-gyeol here?\u201dHong Si-ah looked up at the building with a complicated expression. It was hard to believe that a person was kidnapped in a building in the middle of Seoul.\u201cNo. If you kidnapped someone, shouldn\u2019t you go to a mountainous area in Gangwon-do in common sense?\u201d\u201cWhen was Kang Seung-geon a common-sense guy?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon indifferently responded to Hong Si-ah\u2019s absurd remarks and took out a red jacket and SS-class Lilith sword from his inventory. Seeing this, Hong Si-ah asked him with her eyes wide open.\u201cDo you need to bring out an SS-class weapon? Even so\u2026\u201d\u201cThere must be a reason he chose this place.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon slowly began to feel annoyed with Hong Si-ah. Before Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s dirty temperament raised to his head, Woo Seo-hyuk quickly intervened between the two of them.\u201cYou also have to think about Master Kang Seung-geon\u2019s ability. If he uses his ability recklessly and the surrounding buildings or the ground collapses, the damage will be severe.\u201d\u201cUum. You\u2019re right.\u201dHong Si-ah, who was patting her lips as if worried about those words, said to Cha Soo-yeon.\u201cSoo-yeon-ah, just in case, you wait here. If the ground shakes or the building is about to collapse, contact the management headquarters and help to evacuate the civilians.\u201d\u201c\u2026I got it.\u201dCha Soo-yeon thought about it for a moment and then nodded her head. Since there were Cheon Sa-yeon and Hong Si-ah, it seemed that there was no need to intervene.Woo Seo-hyuk, who was watching the scene, opened his mouth.\u201cMaster. I will remain here.\u201d\u201cYeah. It would be better to have a healer on standby just in case. Contact Healer Min Ah-rin.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAt the end of that command, Cheon Sa-yeon moved to the entrance without hesitation. After that, Kim Woo-jin quickly followed.\u201cThen I will go too. Just in case, be careful.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter looking at Woo Seo-hyuk, who called Min Ah-rin, and Cha Soo-yeon, who had a very worried expression, looked at Hong Si-ah, who also followed Cheon Sa-yeon into the building.The inside of the empty building was much larger than expected. Hong Si-ah, who was walking looking inside a little dark because there were not many windows, squeezed the whip at the sound of heels coming from the other side.Clack. Clack.Squeak.A tall woman in a miniskirt and red shoes appeared who opened the door, which was painted white like the wall. In line with the appearance, Cheon Sa-yeon cut his palm deeper than usual.Patter.Drops of blood splattered on the concrete floor and bright red flames fluttered.

What?\u201dA woman with a youthful voice, different from her mature appearance, tilted her head slightly to the side.\u201cI didn\u2019t know there would be so many guests.\u201dEven standing alone without any weapon, there was a strange atmosphere around the woman that couldn\u2019t be easily approached. Hong Si-ah, who was looking at the woman with her eyes narrowed, said in her sharp voice.\u201cThat\u2026 are you a doll? No way.\u201dWas it the new doll of the puppeteer she encountered at the gate of the G5 Area? When Hong Si-ah frowned in an incomprehensible situation, the doll, which turned to Hong Si-ah just in time, said as if it was funny.\u201cYou\u2019re the woman who broke my doll, right? If not, I wanted to kill her. Good.\u201d\u201cHoo.\u201dHong Si-ah laughed at the confident attitude. Cheon Sa-yeon, who was watching the two with a sad face, called Kim Woo-jin.\u201cKim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll hold its attention properly, so take a look and go through the door. Han Yi-gyeol will be somewhere not far away.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThe dolls are S+, so they take care of themselves.\u201d\u201cOh, my.\u201dHearing this, the woman covered its mouth with a voice of shock.\u201cThe same as back then\u2026 You really know everything.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d\u201cThen do you know the name of this child?\u201dIn response to that question, Cheon Sa-yeon opened his eyes to look back on the distant past for a brief moment. Slowly raising the corners of his lips, he smiled softly and answered immediately.\u201cKaren.\u201dAs if the doll, Karen, answered the call, its shiny eyes sparkled.\u201cYou really know! Amazing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also incredibly cool. Still, the plan to sneak in like a rat must be kept secret. Then it\u2019s hard for me to deal with it properly, isn\u2019t it?\u201dKaren, who had moved its chin and spoke like a human, raised its hand and tapped its green eyes, and white smoke began to leak out. The smoke, drawn from its eyeballs along its fingertips, turned into a hard object in an instant.\u201cWhat\u2026!?\u201dHong Si-ah hated the shocking scene and Kim Woo-jin took a step backwards without realizing it. Only Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t avert his gaze with a bored expression.The smoke from Karen\u2019s eyes became a huge sickle shining all-over silver. It swung its scythe, which looked heavy just by looking at it, lightly in the air with one of its hands.Huung!Then a red powder was formed and scattered in the air. Cheon Sa-yeon burned the dust flying nearby.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the doll\u2019s ability. Is it that weapon ability?\u201dHong Si-ah covered her mouth and slammed the floor with her whip.\u00a0Rumbling!\u00a0The scattered cold air froze the powder that had spread around.\u201cAre you going to send him away? I\u2019ll assist you. Let\u2019s finish it quickly.\u201dAt what Hong Si-ah said, pointing at Kim Woo-jin with a wink, Cheon Sa-yeon nodded his head, sprinted on the ground and shot forward. Hot blood flowed like lava along with bright red flames on his swaying sword.Chaeaeng!Karen\u2019s scythe and Lilith\u2019s sword collided, making a sharp sound. Karen\u2019s high heels, which were pushed back, scratched the floor. At the same time, Hong Si-ah aimed at its leg and swung her whip.Slashing Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword, Karen leapt over him and evaded her whip, wielding its scythe wide.Kugung!With a chilling sensation, Hong Si-ah hurriedly pulled back her body, a shock wave from its scythe ripped through her clothes and smashed the floor.\u201cBy the way, it\u2019s possible to attack from a distance, so you better be careful.\u201d\u201cOu, you should have told me that sooner!\u201dEven at a glance, the power was quite strong. Karen, who landed with a light movement, gently stepped as if it was dancing.\u00a0Clack, clack. Its red shoes on the concrete floor caught her attention.\u201cJust keep aiming at its legs like you just did. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201dAt the end of those words, Cheon Sa-yeon came running again. After confirming that the attack that had threatened Hong Si-ah flew straight, Cheon Sa-yeon gave strength to his legs and jumped high.\u00a0Kwagwang!\u00a0The powerful shock wave that flew in three branches had dug deep into the floor where he had just been as if it had been scratched by a beast\u2019s claws.Huuk, Cheon Sa-yeon swung his sword without hesitation in time for the fall.\u00a0Chaeaeng, chaeng!\u00a0The scythe and the sword collided several times with strong force. The flames roared like a beast as if it was about to devour the opponent at any moment.Karen\u2019s huge scythe was a pretty good item to block SS-class Lilith\u2019s sword, but it was difficult to do a sharp attack because of its large size. Hong Si-ah, noticing that carefully looked into its eyes.Cheon Sa-yeon, who was in charge of the main attack, was constantly attacking Karen, so Hong Si-ah, who was in charge of the secondary attack, had to move so as not to damage Cheon Sa-yeon as much as possible. If she had rushed recklessly, it could only make the situation more complicated.The moment Cheon Sa-yeon avoided the scythe that was aiming at his stomach, Hong Si-ah\u2019s whip struck sharply. Hong Si-ah gave strength to her shoulder and pulled the whip wrapped around Karen\u2019s ankle in one breath.\u00a0Beetle, for a brief moment Karen lost the centre of its body.\u201cUgh!\u201dKaren, who was about to be cut off by Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword that was drawn across it, hurriedly pulled back.\u201cAh, that\u2019s really annoying.\u201dGroaning in an annoying voice, it cut off half of its hair with its scythe without regrets, clinging to the barren flames of Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to deal with incompetent people.\u201dAs expected, it should have brought out a doll other than Karen. It was a hairstyle that it took care of. Sweeping through its shortened hair, Karen slammed its scythe on the floor once.Kuung!\u00a0At the same time as the sound of the ground rumble, the silver scythe began to be coloured with black light at high speed. Its elongated handle twisted around, and in the bladed section, a black skull with its mouth open popped put with a sharp scream.Kkiiiiik\u2014!Bizarre faces in the shape of howling from the floor came up like a haze with black smoke. At the chaotic attribute that flew so thick that her skin was horrifying, Hong Si-ah shouted with a contorted face.\u201cIs that the S-class Shinigami Scythe? Why is that\u2026\u201dDeath\u2019s Scythe. Also called The Grim Reaper, the item was a weapon found at an S-grade boss gate in the United States. Unlike most items with mixed attributes, the Death\u2019s Scythe, which had only a strong chaotic attribute, was one of the weapons directly managed by the US government, which had decided that it couldn\u2019t be easily touched.\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who firmly answered the confused Hong Si-ah, grabbed it by the ankle, trampled on the creeping evil spirit, and fixed his sword.If Karen was a non-puppet person, it would have passed out or went crazy sooner. The power of the chaotic attribute felt that much was amazing. Karen exclaimed in a joyful voice to Hong Si-ah, who was inevitably nervous.\u201cLet\u2019s play properly!\u201dAs Karen swung its scythe in the air, the evil spirits screamed and rushed towards Cheon Sa-yeon and Hong Si-ah, riding on the spreading poison. Cutting it down, Cheon Sa-yeon placed Lilith\u2019s blade once more on his bloody palm. At the same time as the excruciating pain, blood gushed out.Watching the blood dripping down the palm of his hand, Cheon Sa-yeon suddenly remembered Han Yi-gyeol.\u2018\u2026that\u2019s strange.\u2019It would have been overwhelmingly longer than the time he had fought without his support, but for some reason, he kept feeling regretful. Cheon Sa-yeon smirked at the unexpected emotion. He didn\u2019t know he would be sorry for someone\u2019s absence.As if to drive away his thoughts, Cheon Sa-yeon, holding his palm with strength, poured dripping blood onto the blade. As the scorching heat grew stronger, a bright red fire burned with blood and completely covered the blade.In that state, Cheon Sa-yeon kicked the ground and rushed to Karen. As he leaned slightly on his back and swung his sword, black smoke cracked and Karen could be seen through them.\u00a0Kkiaaaak! Kkuaaak!\u00a0The attacked evil spirits burned with an unpleasant sound.Kkigigigik!Karen was able to block the sharp sword of Cheon Sa-yeon that came in with ease.\u00a0Chijik, the red high heels glistened in the flames and were pushed back slightly.\u201cYou idiot! With an attack like this\u2026\u201dKaren, who laughed at Cheon Sa-yeon, stopped talking. Cheon Sa-yeon, who encountered in front of it, smiled as he curled the corners of his eyes amid the flames. The heat was too close and hot.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt was then that Karen realized that Cheon Sa-yeon had been deliberately suppressing his ability until now. The scythe, which could not withstand the heat, cracked and broke, and a fire spread to one side of its face.Kim Woo-jin, who noticed that Cheon Sa-yeon was pushing Karen with a different momentum than before, moved quickly. Karen noticed that Kim Woo-jin passed by it and entered the underground door, but it couldn\u2019t stop him. If it lost even a little of its strength, Cheon Sa-yeon would break its scythe and cut itself in one blow.A whip wrapped around Karen\u2019s legs, as if waiting for it to pull itself out of the body late. Karen\u2019s face distorted strangely for the first time, realizing that its movements were restricted.\u201cDamn, where the fuck is the bitch!\u201dKaren, who had spit out swear words wildly, turned its head toward Hong Si-ah, ignoring Cheon Sa-yeon. Then it opened its chin wide. Cheon Sa-yeon, who noticed something about it, gave up the chance to kill Karen and rushed to Hong Si-ah.Kyaaaaa!With half of its face on fire, Karen spat out huge amounts of poisonous smoke in a straight line from its open mouth. Cheon Sa-yeon pulled Hong Si-ah, who was bewildered by its unexpected attack, but her right arm was buried in poison smoke.\u201cAargh!\u201dIn excruciating pain, Hong Si-ah screamed and missed her whip. Her arms were contorted as if they had been severely burned and her skin was swollen purple.\u201cUh, huu\u2026!\u201dHong Si-ah\u2019s condition deteriorated in an instant. The venom spread through her body, making her face pale and cold sweat began to flow. It was not a fatal wound that would endanger her life, but it was too much to continue the battle.\u201cGet out of the way.\u201dSince they succeeded in letting Kim Woo-jin in, there was no need for Hong Si-ah\u2019s help. After that, Hong Si-ah bit her lip strongly and nodded her head. She wasn\u2019t in a position to be stubborn.Meanwhile, Karen, who had torn half of its face by fire without hesitation, poured out blood and smiled. Hong Si-ah frowned at that strange figure. It was a look she didn\u2019t want to see even in her dreams.\u201cAh, poor Karen.\u201dWhispering in a voice telling it to die, Karen cracked its body.\u00a0Kuung, when it hit on the floor with its scythe handle, an evil spirit that had been devoured by the fire of Cheon Sa-yeon arose anew.\u201cI\u2019ll make you pay for ruining Karen!\u201dThe bottom cracked and debris splashed due to its scythe that swung greatly in a semicircle. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s eyes shone brightly through his softly fluttering black hair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kugung!Sitting with a throbbing headache, I looked up at the top of the stairs with difficulty at the sound of the non-stop explosions.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on. When I wiped my dry lips with my tongue, I could feel the taste of fishy blood.\u2018I thought they would come to save me.\u2019Cha Soo-yeon or Woo Seo-hyuk would have noticed that I was kidnapped openly in the Jayna Guild area. But I didn\u2019t know they would find it this quickly though.Who came? Woo Seo-hyuk? Did Cha Soo-yeon or Hong Si-ah come too? The dolls I saw before looked pretty strong, but I guess they\u2019re all dangerous.Even though I found out that there were people who came to rescue me, somehow I became more anxious than relieved.\u2018Kang Seung-geon is S-rank\u2026 That doll is the problem. At least it will be an S-rank.\u2019Two S-rank people. It wouldn\u2019t be easy. I wish I could fight with them.I sighed as the reality of being captured helplessly was suffocating, and the building itself shook with a roar and concrete powder fell from the ceiling.Squeak!In the midst of the frantic crashing and breaking sound, Kang Seung-geon opened the iron door and came down the stairs. Breathing in his rough breath, he came straight up to me sitting in the corner.\u201cFuck, fuck! Crazy punks, how they can be here\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh, what\u2026!\u201dKang Seung-geon grabbed the back of my head forcefully. Even so, the injured head was pulled and a terrible pain swept over me. The pain was so unbearable that my view turned white, I chewed on the inside of my mouth and forcibly suppressed the scream.\u201cWhy, why did he come all the way here? Oh? What the hell is this guy\u2026\u201d\u201cHuu, ugh!\u201dKang Seung-geon mumbled something unknown and started dragging me along. His tethered arms and shoulders reflexively tightened. I twisted my body as much as I could to avoid being dragged, but it didn\u2019t work at all.\u201cI have to run away. Right now!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIf he moved now, the situation became the worst. Whatever he did, I had to stop Kang Seung-geon. However, I didn\u2019t know how to deal with the continuing pain and unusual behaviour of Kang Seung-geon.\u2018What should I do? I need to release my arm\u2026!\u2019My arms, which had been tied tightly for more than several hours, were very stiff and painful, but I endured the pain and moved my body recklessly to release the tied arm. As I rebelled and moved violently, Kang Seung-geon, who was dragging me forcibly, looked down at me with an annoyed frown.\u201cYou punk.\u201d\u201cHaa, introduce myself?\u201d (\uc790\uae30\uc18c\uac1c \ud574?)As I twisted my mouth and smiled at the gaze I finally met, Kang Seung-geon, wriggling his eyebrows, kicked my stomach without a fuss.\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201dFor a moment, my breath was choked and my upper body was dried up like a shrimp. Kang Seung-geon spat while putting me under his feet as I spit dry cough.\u201cA bastard without a dick lives only with his mouth. I\u2019m so busy right now.\u201d (\uc886\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c8\ub07c\uac00 \uc785\ub9cc \uc0b4\uc544\uc11c, shit what it is again?)\u201cUh\u2026\u201dRattle, rattle.The floor where Kang Seung-geon was standing cracked and began to shake. No way, the ability now\u2026\u201cGet away.\u201dIn a desperate situation, I collapsed and panted, exhausted, and an unimaginable voice came over his back. Like me, he didn\u2019t think anyone would intervene, so Kang Seung-geon was surprised and looked back.\u201cRight now.\u201dThere were straight outstretched hands holding a long-barrelled pistol, and auburn eyes staring at Kang Seung-geon accurately.\u201cGet away from Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dIn the calm voice that flowed out, I could feel a cold chill unlike usual. It didn\u2019t feel real, so I called out his name blankly.\u201cKim Woo-jin?\u201dHow are you here? As if he couldn\u2019t hear my whispers, Kim Woo-jin didn\u2019t take his eyes off Kang Seung-geon.\u201cHa, shit\u2026\u201dKang Seung-geon rubbed the nape of his neck with an absurd expression.\u00a0Kugung, gung!\u00a0The floor shook more violently and cracked deeply.\u201cThe little bastards keep disturbing me.\u201dEven though there was a gun in front of him, Kang Seung-geon wasn\u2019t afraid. Unless he was an expert in handling guns, it wasn\u2019t easy to reach the S-rank, where his physical ability was extremely high. Even the fact that Kim Woo-jin was an A-rank clone magician had already spread all over the world, so there was no way that Kang Seung-geon didn\u2019t know him.Despite Kang Seung-geon\u2019s provocation, Kim Woo-jin didn\u2019t lower his gun. Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face, seen under the pale light of the basement, didn\u2019t show any agitation. It was Kang Seung-geon who was pushed back by that appearance.Kang Seung-geon, who retreated from the cold eyes under the red hair that covered his forehead, waved his hand. Then, cracked and rattling of concrete debris floated into the air. The debris showing a sharp cross-section toward Kim Woo-jin was very threatening.\u201cKim, Woo-jin\u2026!\u201dKim Woo-jin, who didn\u2019t back down, made me nervous. Run away quickly before you get hurt. He hadn\u2019t been long since he re-awakened. I\u2019ll try enduring it.\u201cHey, A-rank.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you run away right now, I will let you go. I\u2019m very generous to these little bastards even I\u2019m like this.\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201dKang Seung-geon frowned at the calm answer.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said, try it.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201dAt that moment, at the same time as a gunshot, Kang Seung-geon quickly turned his upper body to the side. A bullet narrowly passed by Kang Seung-geon\u2019s arm and pierced the wall. Kang Seung-geon\u2019s face instantly burned red with anger at Kim Woo-jin\u2019s action, who shot first.\u201cThis bastard!\u201d\u201cKim Woo-jin!\u201dThree huge concrete debris floating behind Kang Seung-geon flew to Kim Woo-jin in an instant. My heart was beating loudly and the image of Kim Woo-jin seriously injured passed by like an afterimage. No, you have to stop\u2014\u201cOh?\u201dKang Seung-geon, who watched in anticipation of the debris penetrating Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body, opened his mouth with a stupid expression. Two identical-looking Kim Woo-jin flew to both sides with flying debris in between. Is it possible to create clones at such a speed? For a moment, I was as surprised as Kang Seung-geon was.Crack!\u00a0Instead of Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body, grey smoke was scattered from the concrete debris stuck to the wall, and Kim Woo-jin, holding a gun, pulled the trigger once more.\u00a0Taang!\u00a0At the same time as his gunfire, a bullet went into the right shoulder of Kang Seung-geon, who had been careless, and his blood splattered.\u201cKuaaak!\u201dI looked up blankly at Kang Seung-geon, who was screaming in pain, and someone grabbed my shoulder from the side. Surprised and looking back, it was another Kim Woo-jin. As Kang Seung-geon grabbed his bloody shoulder and staggered, Kim Woo-jin, who pulled me in and hugged me, quickly widened the distance from Kang Seung-gun.\u201cKim, Woo-jin. This, my arms\u2026\u201dHearing what I said, Kim Woo-jin pulled out a small self-defence knife from his waist and cut off the string at once. Then, an energy that hadn\u2019t been moved before wrapped around my heart and began to flutter. I felt excruciating pain on my shoulders, which had been tied up for a long time, but I clenched my teeth and swung my arms around.Hwiing!As I wrapped Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body with my ability, he jumped in the direction of the stairs while holding me.\u00a0Taang!\u00a0I heard another shot.\u201cDamn, do you think I\u2019m going to miss it!?\u201dThe second bullet fired several long and sharp concrete debris at me as Kang Seung-geon, who had escaped, was running away. It was an S-rank attack, so it was impossible to block it with A-rank ability. I was trying to twist the path of the debris as much as possible using the wind, but someone interrupted me.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt was Kim Woo-jin, who was holding Kang Seung-geon in check with a gun on the left. Kim Woo-jin, who stopped me without avoiding even the debris flying quickly, pulled the trigger for the third time.Tang!Crack!At the same time as the gunfire, I heard a terrible sound of flesh and bones being pierced and broken, and instead of me, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body, which had been shattered, fell down with blood splattered. My heart raced too fast at the shocking sight that unfolded before my eyes.\u201cCough\u2026\u00a0gasp\u2026!\u201d\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. Yi-gyeol-ah.\u201dKim Woo-jin whispered in a soft voice to me as I was gasping for breath while holding his chest.\u201cCalm down. It\u2019s a clone.\u201dLiterally, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s clone, who was shattered instead of me, became smoke and dispersed. Still, the shock didn\u2019t go away. Emotions pushed to the limit took everything sensitively.\u201cKuaaak, fuck it!\u201dKang Seung-geon, whose left thigh was pierced by the last gunshot by his clone, screamed and cursed.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIn the meantime, Kim Woo-jin hugged me and hurriedly climbed the stairs and opened the iron door. Then came a hallway painted in pure white paint. Instead of moving on, Kim Woo-jin entered one of the many rooms in the hallway. It certainly wasn\u2019t a bad choice as there was a high chance of being caught by Kang Seung-geon if he crossed the hallway like this.After sitting close to the wall and waiting for a while, Kang Seung-geon muttered a curse and passed in front of the room where we were hiding with urgent and rough footsteps.Haa. Only then did I breathe a sigh of relief and turn my gaze to Kim Woo-jin, who was sitting in front of me. He still had an unfamiliarly calm face, but his complexion was too pale and he was sweating coldly, perhaps because of the pain his clone had suffered.\u201cKim Woo-jin, are you okay? How did you get here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou share your senses with your clone. If you block it so recklessly\u2026 Kim Woo-jin?\u201dI called again, but no answer came back. Come on.\u201c\u2026hey, are you angry?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo words this time, he must be really mad. I hurriedly poured out my excuses.\u201cNo, I got caught while I was careless, so I don\u2019t have anything to say. Still, I thought that I would be rescued, so I tried to be as calm as possible\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dWhat? I shut my mouth as I poured out gibberish at the sudden apology. At that moment, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s eyes, which were getting redder, came into view.Kim Woo-jin stroked my arm with a trembling hand. My arms were swollen and bruised here and there because I was tied so tightly, my left face was scarred from hitting a rough wall, my forehead and hair still dripping with blood. Kim Woo-jin, who was carefully touching the injured area one after another, dropped a big tear.\u201cSorry, sorry\u2026 because I couldn\u2019t come sooner\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe cold and sober face that felt awkward collapsed, and Kim Woo-jin\u2019s face, which I was familiar with, took its place. Kim Woo-jin just breathed out his hot breath and shed tears, wondering if it would hurt if he touched the wound properly.As I looked at it, somehow I felt a throbbing sensation as if several butterflies were flapping their wings in my stomach. I had no idea how to comfort Kim Woo-jin, who was crying sadly. I was worried about what to say, with my lips moistened over and over again, but I finally pulled him into my arms and hugged him.Kim Woo-jin, who was stiff as if surprised, immediately wrapped his arms around my waist and brought my body closer together. Kim Woo-jin, whose body temperature rose from crying, was quite warm. I closed my eyes, resting my tired face on the boy\u2019s shoulder, which was noticeably stronger than before. A comfortable smile appeared on my lips.T/N :Finally! Woo-jin came to rescue~ I love his kinda psycho act but let me cry at the corner for a moment\u2026Yi-gyeol couldn\u2019t see his people dying in front of him but he let them see himself almost died\u2026 It\u2019s unfair Yi-gyeol\u2026 QAQPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though a high-grade evil spirit that melted the flesh and led to panic was attached to him, Cheon Sa-yeon wielded his sword, tearing it apart with his bare hands with an indifferent expression.Kiing! Gigik!The sword slipped all the way along the round curves of the scythe. Through the sparkling sparks, the doll\u2019s smooth eyes and Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s black eyes met. As Karen vigorously pushed out the digging Cheon Sa-yeon, Cheon Sa-yeon, who retreated back, leapt to the ground with a light movement and jumped into the air.Tak, kwagak!Cheon Sa-yeon, who came down right in front of Karen, lowered his body and quickly drew his sword horizontally.\u00a0Sizzling, Karen\u2019s clothes were torn and blood was splattered near the collarbone.\u201cIik\u2026!\u201dThen, strength entered his strong thighs and his wrists holding the sword that was facing Karen turned round and round. It was just about the moment that Karen was trying to block the second attack that came in precisely at the neck with its scythe handle.Kugugugung!The inside of the building shook violently and concrete powder fell from the ceiling. In the meantime, Kang Seung-geon opened the door, panting for breath and appeared behind Karen, who opened the distance from Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cTh, that.\u201dAs Karen shot with an annoying voice at Kang Seung-geon\u2019s actions that had come up to this point without monitoring the kidnapped person, Kang Seung-geon\u2019s lips trembled in fear. Seeing this, Cheon Sa-yeon frowned.\u201cTha, that bastard\u2026 dis, disappeared. Th, this weird guy got a gun\u2026\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dKang Seung-geon\u2019s white suit was stained with blood around his shoulders and thighs. Cheon Sa-yeon noticed that Kim Woo-jin had succeeded in saving Han Yi-gyeol, as expected. Karen sighed as it watched Kang Seung-geon gibberish in a pale tired state, wielding its scythe and hit the floor roughly.\u201cYa, destroy the building.\u201d\u201cUh, oh, yes?\u201d\u201cUse your ability to destroy the building. You stupid bastard.\u201dAt that, Kang Seung-geon hurriedly nodded his head and raised his energy.\u00a0Kugung, gung!\u00a0The building began to shake in earnest and cracked here and there. Cheon Sa-yeon forced Hong Si-ah to stand up while flying backwards to avoid the falling concrete debris.\u201cDestroy it quickly! Destroy it!\u201d\u201cUh,\u00a0gasp\u2026!\u201dAt Karen\u2019s urging tone to destroy, it now began to vibrate violently to the floor. Tsk. Cheon Sa-yeon, who clicked his tongue to the thought of being bothered, raised his energy one more time. The concrete that had fallen over Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s head couldn\u2019t withstand the heat and melted as it was.Kugugugung!When all the ceilings collapsed, the building couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and quickly lost its shape. The foggy smoke covered Cheon Sa-yeon and Hong Si-ah.* * *Kugugung!Cha Soo-yeon, who felt the ground shake with a roar, frowned. What was happening inside took longer than expected. She thought they would be back soon.\u2018\u2026it will be okay, right?\u2019She was standing in front of the building with an anxious mind and heard a clear voice from behind.\u201cSecretary Woo Seo-hyuk!\u201dA light brown-haired woman got out of the taxi and ran hurriedly.When the management headquarters staff, which controlled civilians from coming close, didn\u2019t stop the brown-haired woman, without explanation, Cha Soo-yeon recognized that she was a healer belonging to Requiem called by Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201cWhat about Yi-gyeol-ssi?\u201d\u201cEveryone who entered haven\u2019t come out.\u201d\u201cStill? No way\u2026\u201dAt Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s answer, Min Ah-rin hardened her face and moved her gaze to the building.\u201c\u2026there\u2019s a high possibility that there\u2019s someone else besides Master Kang Seung-geon. If it wasn\u2019t for that, there\u2019s no way we couldn\u2019t have saved Yi-gyeol until now.\u201d\u201cI think so, too.\u201dAt the sight of Min Ah-rin, who quickly grasped the situation, Woo Seo-hyuk was surprised inside and nodded his head.\u00a0Kururung, the sound of something collapsing and breaking could be heard constantly from inside the building.\u201cCan\u2019t we go in now?\u201d\u201cIt can be a hindrance. Above all, Master didn\u2019t give such an order.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who had a worried expression with her eyebrows down, let out a sigh of relief.\u201cI hope everything is fine\u2026\u201dShe heard that Han Yi-gyeol was kidnapped from Woo Seo-hyuk\u2019s call and Master and Kim Woo-jin were at the scene, she ran frantically. She knew that a healer herself had no choice but to wait, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous.Cha Soo-yeon, who was secretly spying on Min Ah-rin\u2019s side face, looked at the gloomy atmosphere. Somehow, that healer kept coming into her eyes.\u2018She seems to be very close with Han Yi-gyeol.\u2019At the same time, Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s eyes, who were looking to the side, met Min Ah-rin\u2019s eyes. Seeing Min Ah-rin\u2019s round eyes, Cha Soo-yeon was shy and avoided her gaze without realizing it.That was then. A black car stopped over the control line and a man in a black suit got out of the driver\u2019s seat. It was Ha Tae-heon, who came after Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s call. Cha Soo-yeon, who saw him, approached him with a smile.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi!\u201d\u201cWhere is Han Yi-gyeol?\u201dAs soon as Ha Tae-heon, who walked in stride, saw Cha Soo-yeon, he brought up the main topic. Cha Soo-yeon swallowed dry saliva and barely responded to his appearance that more relaxed than expected.\u201cNot yet. Still no news.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who cut off Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s words, turned towards the entrance of the building. In his right hand, there was a black sword he had made with his ability. Just as he was about to enter the building, Woo Seo-hyuk blocked the door.\u201cNo, Deputy Master Ha Tae-heon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon stared coldly at Woo Seo-hyuk, who blocked the entrance. Nevertheless, Woo Seo-hyuk didn\u2019t back down with a firm expression.\u201cGet out of the way, Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of battle is going on inside. It\u2019s dangerous to intervene hastily in this situation.\u201dIn the past, they met a few times whenever there was work in the guild, so they already knew each other. Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth with an openly threatening energy.\u201cI know it has been some time since I received the call, but do I have to wait here longer?\u201d\u201cEven so, entering without a plan will only make things worse.\u201d\u201cIn this case, safety cannot be the only concern. You must know Kang Seung-geon\u2019s ability. While you\u2019re doing this, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll move from place to place.\u201d\u201cThere is a separate guild member who went to rescue Han Yi-gyeol-ssi. Master Cheon Sa-yeon and Master Hong Si-ah\u2019s roles are to draw attention to the last. If things are going according to plan\u2014\u201dCrack!Before Woo Seo-hyuk could finish speaking, the ground shook violently and the sound of crackling and cracking could be heard from all over the place.\u201cSecretary Woo Seo-hyuk! The building\u2026!\u201dThe building, which had been shaking unsteadily, began to collapse quickly at the same time as Min Ah-rin\u2019s astonishing cry. At that moment, Ha Tae-heon sensed something and pulled Woo Seo-hyeok, who was standing in front of him, by the collar and pulled back.Kuung!A huge scythe pierced the collapsing concrete wall and crashed into the ground.\u00a0Kuaaak! Aaak!\u00a0Evil spirits crawling out of the scythe howled.\u201cOh, my.\u201dNext to it, Cheon Sa-yeon, who melted the concrete, came out of the building with Hong Si-ah. Cha Soo-yeon discovered Hong Si-ah\u2019s injury and distorted her face.\u201cMaster! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cHealer Min Ah-rin.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon handed over Hong Si-ah, who was being supported by him, to Cha Soo-yeon and called Min Ah-rin.\u201cHeal in moderation. Don\u2019t run out of your energy. Han Yi-gyeol will be out soon.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who understood the meaning of his words, asked in a shaky voice.\u201cDid he get hurt?\u201d\u201cI guess so. He couldn\u2019t have stayed calm with his personality.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who couldn\u2019t refute him, bit her lips tightly, nodded her head and walked up to Hong Si-ah. Cheon Sa-yeon turned away from that figure and found Ha Tae-heon standing with Woo Seo-hyuk and tilted his head slightly.\u201cHa Tae-heon. Why are you here?\u201d\u201c\u2026I have something to talk about.\u201dHa Tae-heon answered with sincerity. He didn\u2019t think that Cheon Sa-yeon wouldn\u2019t know that Han Yi-gyeol had been kidnapped, but he never thought that he would come and fight in person.\u201cAhaha, what is it?\u201dA young girl\u2019s voice intervened between Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon. Standing on top of the pile of concrete rubble with a giant scythe, Karen looked down at everyone and shouted brightly.\u201cDid two SS-rankers come to avoid losing only one A-rank? Isn\u2019t it fun?\u201d\u201c\u2026doll?\u201dA doll with an odd shape was standing with a scythe with half of its face blown off. With an unusual presence, Ha Tae-heon recognized that it was the opponent who blocked Cheon Sa-yeon and Hong Si-ah.\u2018Then what about Han Yi-gyeol? The building collapsed, but where the hell\u2026\u2019Ha Tae-heon frowned and looked around him, but Kang Seung-geon came out of the wreckage.\u201cUuh, ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cHaa. You\u2019re a really useless pig.\u201dKaren mercilessly kicked Kang Seung-geon\u2019s head, who had crawled to its feet. Cha Soo-yeon was surprised by the humiliating sight and swallowed her breath.\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Master Kang Seung-geon!\u201dDespite Hong Si-ah\u2019s cry, Kang Seung-geon only shook his head at Karen, but didn\u2019t look back. Ha Tae-heon, who was quietly observing the situation, opened his mouth with an unpleasant feeling.\u201cDid he under mental control?\u201dKang Seung-geon, whose forehead was torn in red heels, lowered his body even more while bleeding.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dPutting one foot on Kang Seung-geon\u2019s head, Karen tapped its chin.\u201cWhat should I do? The plan is already over. Even Karen is broken.\u201dKaren pondered for a moment and as it had pulled out its scythe, it pulled out a red, round marble from its eyeball and held it to Kang Seung-geon.\u201cHere, eat.\u201d\u201cUh, oh\u2026?\u201d\u201cUng. Swallow it.\u201dWith a blank face, Kang Seung-geon stretched out his hand toward the marble in front of him. He decided that he could no longer watch, so Ha Tae-heon sprinted to the ground and ran towards Karen.\u00a0Kugung!\u00a0Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sword separated Karen and Kang Seung-geon, but he couldn\u2019t stop Kang Seung-geon from swallowing the marble.\u201cOh my, so hot! But I like that pretty\u00a0oppa\u00a0more!\u201dIgnoring Kang Seung-geon, who was rolling down the concrete rubble, Karen jumped up and gently landed on the other rubble. Ha Tae-heon, who frowned at Karen\u2019s playful behaviour all the time, said to Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cMaster Cheon Sa-yeon. I will deal with this one, so find Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who was watching Karen and Kang Seung-geon with his arms crossed, blinked his eyes at those words and pointed forward.\u201cIf it\u2019s Han Yi-gyeol, then he\u2019s coming over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAs he looked up at the relaxed words, he saw Han Yi-gyeol flying on the back of a red-haired man.\u00a0Haa, Ha Tae-heon exhaled a sigh of relief. Han Yi-gyeol, who flew at high speed, opened his eyes with a blood-stained face.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi? How are you\u2026\u201dHe came down to the ground and tried to approach Ha Tae-heon, but a red-haired man grabbed his arm and stopped him.\u201cGet treatment first, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cOh? But\u2026\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi?\u201dAt the same time, Min Ah-rin, who had treated Hong Si-ah\u2019s arm to some extent, rushed to him. Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s expression changed even more bewildered at her appearance.Seeing this, Ha Tae-heon sighed once more.T/N :Anyone join Soo-yeon/Ah-rin ship? Or someone already made the boat!? I\u2019ll join then! Somehow they would be a cute couple\u2026Pfft, Karen, we have the same taste, I prefer that\u00a0pretty oppa\u00a0too~Ah, Yi-gyeol\u2026 how could you so happy because of Tae-heon there? Even you kinda ignore your injuries\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It will collapse.\u201dIt looked like we had to get out of the building. At my words, Kim Woo-jin nodded his head with the corners of his eyes burning bright red.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dKugung! Kugugung!The ceiling of the building began to collapse with a roar. Kim Woo-jin, who carried me on his back, wrapped himself in the wind. Huge debris of concrete poured down over his head, but before it could reach his body, it was pushed to the side by the wind.\u201cNow!\u201dMeasuring the timing by sifting through the debris, I found a small gap and tapped Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder. Kim Woo-jin, who was waiting for my signal, jumped up vigorously.Hwiiing!Using the wind to push the debris away, I and Kim Woo-jin, who escaped safely, looked down at the completely collapsing building with grey smoke in the air. As I rested my forehead on Kim Woo-jin\u2019s shoulder and exhaled a breath of relief, I heard a soft voice.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dLet\u2019s go where? Before I even asked, Kim Woo-jin started moving. Passing through the building where the remains met and going straight forward, it was near the entrance of the building. After turning off my ability and coming down from Kim Woo-jin\u2019s back, I found a person I didn\u2019t expect and opened my eyes wide.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi? How are you\u2026\u201dThe familiar figure who looked at me and sighed openly was definitely Ha Tae-heon. Even in the midst of doubts, I was happy to approach him right away, but Kim Woo-jin grabbed my arm.\u201cGet treatment first, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201d\u201cOh? But\u2026\u201dHow could I be treated\u2026\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi?\u201dMin Ah-rin was also here? Behind Min Ah-rin, who rushed out, Hong Si-ah, Cha Soo-yeon, and Woo Seo-hyuk were seen.\u201cNo, what are you all doing here?\u201d\u201cWhat stupid thing are you talking about?\u201dWhen I asked with a bewildered feeling, Min Ah-rin put on a terrifying expression and got angry at me for the first time. You said \u2018stupid thing\u2019\u2026\u201cHe seriously had a bad head injury. Please check it properly.\u201dI didn\u2019t feel real about the fact that I was scolded by Min Ah-rin, so I stood blankly, and Kim Woo-jin said strange things next to me. No, it was true that I hurt my head, but it was kind of weird to explain it like that.\u201cI mean, what\u2019s going on here\u2026\u201dCrack!At that moment, a terrifying feeling ran through my body. Cheon Sa-yeon appeared in front of me in an instant and blocked the huge scythe with his sword. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s voice could be heard through the hot energy felt on the skin.\u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201dHe trampled with his feet the evil spirit that rose like a haze from the ground and swung his sword to slash the scythe.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later and clean up the situation first.\u201dKagang!Kuaaak! Kiaaak!\u00a0Evil spirits soaring from the scythe spread all over the place, the screaming that I didn\u2019t want to hear. I mumbled as I stared at the figure.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon, why are you here\u2026\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, how long are you going to say that?\u201d\u201cBecause he hurt his head.\u201dKim Woo-jin\u2019s pitiful voice woke me up. Cheon Sa-yeon was correct. I had to ask why they were here later and had to deal with the enemy first.As the smoke from the collapse of the building was blown away by the wind, a bizarre-shaped doll with half of its face torn off and Kang Seung-geon crawling on the floor were seen. The doll looked at me and shook its head and grumbled in a tone of regret.\u201cAh, I lost it in the end. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to leave it to a pig like that.\u201dA broken doll swung a huge scythe with one hand. Just looking at the black scythe with evil spirits protruding and skulls crawling made my back cold.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. Use your ability.\u201d\u201cBut, Master! Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0isn\u2019t in a right state right now.\u201d\u201cGet treatment later.\u201dAt the resolute command, I smiled and lifted up my energy, telling Min Ah-rin not to worry. As long as there was that doll anyway, it would be difficult to receive treatment comfortably. It was the moment when the wind wrapped around Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s body.\u201cGuook! Kuaaaak!\u201dKang Seung-geon, who was shaking while lying on the floor, suddenly shouted. He gasped while clutching his chest as if in pain, gurgling, phlegm-boiling sounded, and began pouring out a huge amount of blood from his mouth.\u201cWhat the\u2026!\u201d\u201cGuok, goook!\u201dKugugugung!When Kang Seung-geon twisted his body and vomited blood for the second time, the whole ground began to vibrate violently like an earthquake.\u201cAhahaha! Well done! Destroy it! Destroy them all!\u201dAs the doll burst into mad laughter, Kang Seung-geon grabbed his forehead and let out a rough breath.\u00a0Crack, from under his feet, the floor began to distort and crumble at random.\u201cKkyaaaak!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s an earthquake!\u201dStreet lamps fell, electric lines burst, and at the same time, people screamed everywhere. Cheon Sa-yeon frowned upon realizing that Kang Seung-geon\u2019s ability had an effect beyond the control line.\u201cThe explosion risk stage.\u201d (\ud3ed\uc8fc \uc704\ud5d8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uad70, is there the better way to name it?)\u201cThe explosion risk stage?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t control his energy. If you leave it alone, it will start running rampant. Woo Seo-hyuk, Kim Woo-jin. Together with the management headquarters staff, you help evacuate civilians.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAt that command, Woo Seo-hyuk ripped his clothes and turned into a wolf, and Kim Woo-jin created two new clones. Hong Si-ah, who was watching the situation, approached Cha Soo-yeon and said.\u201cSoo-yeon and I will help. If I stayed here any longer, I think it would be just a nuisance. Healer Min Ah-rin, can you come with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026I get it.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who looked at me for a while at Hong Si-ah\u2019s request, nodded her head with a look of helplessness.\u201cAnd Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who quickly grasped the situation and gave the order, turned to me.\u201cFighting Kang Seung-geon with Ha Tae-heon. If he faints, the explosion will stop. Don\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u201cWhat, wai\u2026\u201dBefore I could catch it, Cheon Sa-yeon flew towards the doll.\u00a0Chaeaeng!\u00a0The huge scythe and the sword collided, and the fire flared up like an explosion.\u201cGuhu, uuugh\u2026!\u201dDozens of sharp stone debris floated around Kang Seung-geon, who woke up with a groan of pain.\u00a0Crack, crack!\u00a0The ground twisted violently and sharp debris broke through the soil and bounced out. Ha Tae-heon grabbed my body, which was staggered by the strong shaking as it closed to me.\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi.\u201d\u201cFor now, it would be better to do as Master Cheon Sa-yeon said.\u201dI nodded and wrapped my arms around Ha Tae-heon\u2019s neck, and he hugged me as if he had been waiting. Without cutting off the energy I used for Cheon Sa-yeon, I came out and wrapped Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body in a new wind.As I floated high, I could see the mess around me at a glance. The road was turned over, causing traffic accidents everywhere, and street lights and several buildings had already collapsed.Kugung! Kugugung!The management headquarters staff and guild members who were guarding the control line were helping the evacuation, but it was not enough to prevent the damage. I had to stop Kang Seung-geon\u2019s explosion as soon as possible.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ha Tae-heon-ssi.\u201dAs we descended in front of Kang Seung-geon, who was staggering with his hand on his head, the ground rattled threateningly towards us.\u00a0Huung, black dust mixed with my wind and wrapped around our bodies like a shield.\u201cKuu, ugh!\u201dKang Seung-geon, who had been crushing the ground nearby, looked at me with red eyes with all his veins bursting. Then he tore the corners of his lip long.\u2018What?\u2019When I felt disgusted and frowned at the sight, Kang Seung-geon pointed at me with a trembling hand and said.\u201cI, I remember. Fuck. I just remembered.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou? It was you, right? Shit, that time. That stinky shantytown!\u201dShantytown? It was incomprehensible from start to finish. Even though I didn\u2019t understand, Kang Seung-geon leaned his back with a cool expression on his face and started to laugh.\u201cNow I know! You and that dog orphan, you were the same one who ruined my life! I didn\u2019t even know that, damn it!\u201d\u201c\u2026what does he mean by that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThe orphan bastard seemed to mean Cheon Sa-yeon, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what he and I did to Kang Seung-geon. Kang Seung-geon, who had been smiling happily for a long time, looked at me with half-crazed eyes and muttered.\u201cIf I kill all of you, will my life go back to its place? Oh?\u201dHuge stone debris broke through the soil and jumped out of the ground shaking unsteadily.\u00a0Kugugung!\u00a0Ha Tae-heon, who flew off the collapsing floor, held my body tightly and swung his sword towards the flying stone debris.\u201cGasp!\u201dOne of the broken stone debris brushed past my ear.Most of the attacks were blocked with Ha Tae-heon\u2019s sword and shield, but it was difficult to block them all as debris flew nonstop from all directions. I asked Ha Tae-heon, avoiding the debris that kept flying to my face.\u201cWhat exactly is Kang Seung-geon\u2019s ability?\u201dI roughly assumed it was the ability to control the land, but now that I saw it, the range was much wider than I expected. Ha Tae-heon answered while cutting away the flying concrete debris.\u201cHe can control things made of soil and rocks. It\u2019s useful, but that\u2019s all.\u201dObviously, the attack that flew towards us ended up with stones and concrete debris filled with S-rank energy. Except for causing an earthquake by shaking the whole ground, it wasn\u2019t combat-type ability as Ha Tae-heon explained.I said cautiously to Ha Tae-heon, who couldn\u2019t close the distance because he was constantly smashing out huge pieces of stone and debris.\u201cI think he\u2019s aiming at me, but I can get his attention somewhere else\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dIt didn\u2019t work either. As I laughed awkwardly, Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth in a lower voice.\u201cI definitely felt the same way as at the Gulupdo Island Gate. That you should never be left alone.\u201d\u201cEi, to that extent\u2026\u201dI was about to reply playfully, but I trembled at Ha Tae-heon\u2019s terrifying gaze and stopped talking. I guess it was sincere. Now I heard nagging even from Ha Tae-heon.\u201cBut we can\u2019t stop the explosion like this.\u201d\u201cNo. There\u2019s a way.\u201d\u201cReally? What is it?\u201dYeah. If you think about it, isn\u2019t Ha Tae-heon the main character of the Abyss? He was a much smarter and more sensible man than me. I waited for Ha Tae-heon\u2019s explanation with inflated expectations.\u201cThe way is.\u201dThe way is?\u201cShut up and rush.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHa Tae-heon took an SS-class coat from his inventory and held it to me. When I suddenly accepted it, Ha Tae-heon swung his sword towards Kang Seung-geon with great speed as if he had been waiting.\u201cWa, wait a minute! Ha Tae-heon-ssi!\u201dThis crazy!Only then did I realize the meaning of the word \u2018shut up and rush\u2019, I quickly covered myself with my coat and hugged Ha Tae-heon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I lowered the coat a little just to the point of my eyes and looked straight ahead.Ha Tae-heon was cutting down concrete debris and narrowing the distance with Kang Seung-geon without hesitation. Kang Seung-geon, surprised by Ha Tae-heon\u2019s actions, hurriedly raised his energy.\u201cCough!\u201dWhether there were side effects from excessive energy use, Kang Seung-geon spat dry cough and grabbed his head.\u00a0Kugugugung!\u00a0The ground shook violently once more, dented here and there as if a bomb had exploded.\u201cDie!

Then it slammed into us like a snake preying on its prey.\u201cUgh!\u201dKuung!\u00a0The soil splattered along with the dust.

It\u2019s just\u2026 ugh.\u201dHa Tae-heon cut down the soil he ran into the front several times, but it was meaningless. Ha Tae-heon, who knew what I was going to say, tightened his hand holding my waist. A tingling sensation arose.\u201cBe quiet.\u201dA cold and cool energy emanated from Ha Tae-heon\u2019s body. My shoulders shuddered at the chilling feeling that ran through my waist. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s black eyes, was seen under the fluttering dark brown hair, turned towards the pillar of soil created by Kang Seung-geon.It was then that I noticed an amount of black dust I had never seen before, gathering around me. Numerous black spheres appeared in the air to cover Kang Seung-geon\u2019s pillar of soil.Kuuung!The black spheres attached to the pillar of soil began to explode one after another with a roar. Another sphere exploded before the soil scattered by the explosion could be gathered again, and the soil fell down without taking shape.Ha Tae-heon moved again through the constantly exploding spheres and scattered soil. This time, Ha Tae-heon, who had properly arrived in front of Kang Seung-geon, swung his sword without hesitation before I could stop him.\u201cGasp.\u201d\u201cHa Tae-heon-ssi!\u201dFortunately, Kang Seung-geon pushed his body back in time to avoid the attack. Surprised, I grabbed Ha Tae-heon\u2019s collar and shouted.\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him, Ha Tae-heon-ssi!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dWhat do you mean \u2018know\u2019! If Kang Seung-geon hadn\u2019t escaped, both legs would have been cut off!\u201cYou can\u2019t even attack too hard!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHa Tae-heon answered my words but didn\u2019t stop attacking. Fortunately, Kang Seung-geon barely avoided all of his physical ability. Ha Tae-heon opened his mouth with a grim expression as he struck down the sharp stone spear that Kang Seung-geon flew.\u201cI agree not to kill him. But I don\u2019t want to see it that way. If you deal with him enough that he doesn\u2019t die, he\u2019ll pass out on his own.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Do you mean that you\u2019re going to cut it off regardless of whether it\u2019s an arm or a leg?\u201dWhen asked by me, Ha Tae-heon looked at me asking what the problem was.\u201cHe\u2019s the one who committed the crime after all, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRight. Ha Tae-heon was such a guy. There was no blood or tears for the villain. The memory of being beaten by Ha Tae-heon for the first time came to mind. It really hurt\u2026 Thinking about it now, Ha Tae-heon might have cut some slack at that time.\u201cAh, no.\u201dNow was not the time to recall the memories of the past. I looked up at him and hurriedly shook my head.\u201cIt seems that Master Kang Seung-geon was also under mental control, but it\u2019s not such a big mistake that his limbs were cut off. So\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that what a kidnapped victim would say? I really don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cOf course, I also want to beat Kang Seung-geon because he\u2019s annoying, but that\u2019s a different matter! To break mental control and get a better idea of what\u2019s going on properly, you need to make him pass out as intact as possible. Cheon Sa-yeon said so too.\u201dAfter trying hard to persuade him, I saw Ha Tae-heon making dissatisfied expressions and stopped talking.What? It couldn\u2019t be, but for some reason, he looked like he was pouting. Because I mentioned \u201cCheon Sa-yeon\u201d?\u201cCough, these\u2026 fucking bastards!\u201dAs I was contemplating how to deal with this situation, Kang Seung-geon, who was exhaling harshly, spat out abusive language. Kang Seung-geon, who was using his ability recklessly, was sweating on his forehead. Ha Tae-heon sighed and changed the shape of the sword he was holding at the sight of the end.As soon as I realized what the sword had changed into, I flinched for a moment, but I didn\u2019t bother to stop him. I just expressed my condolences to Kang Seung-geon in my heart. Poor guy.Ha Tae-heon grabbed a new weapon and flew through the air. Kang Seung-geon hurriedly threw concrete debris next to him towards Ha Tae-heon, but it didn\u2019t do much damage and was destroyed.\u201cGasp!\u201dHa Tae-heon, who succeeded in getting closer, caught his breath and grabbed Kang Seung-geon\u2019s collar, who was about to run away. Then, relentlessly, he threw him to the ground.\u201cKuak!\u201dKang Seung-geon, who rolled over the floor, distorted his face. This wasn\u2019t the end. Ha Tae-heon raised his weapon toward the fallen Kang Seung-geon.Punch!\u201cKuaaak!\u201dPunch! Crack, crack!While holding a new weapon, a black and strong club, Ha Tae-heon began to beating Kang Seung-geon at great speed. The hawk flew over without hesitation to the shoulder and thigh that had been shot by Kim Woo-jin. (I\u2019m not sure about the black and strong club and the hawk too, it\u2019s probably the boxing gloves item and the hawk is the fist, I\u2019ll check it later)\u201cKua, ah! Argh! St, stop! Fuck!\u201dAnd I watched Kang Seung-geon be beaten up close while holding Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arms. Meanwhile, Ha Tae-heon was also really good at beating. I was purely admiring as I watched him beat him again and hit him where he hadn\u2019t hit him.Punch! Punch! Smack!Ha Tae-heon really hit Kang Seung-geon without taking a breather, and Kang Seung-geon never resisted and was beaten over and over again. I wasn\u2019t really worried about it as it was an S-rank body that didn\u2019t die from any injuries. He almost got his limbs cut off. At this rate, Ha Tae-heon also gave him a lot of slack.\u201cKuuugh\u2026\u201dHow bad would it have been? In the end, Kang Seung-geon made a groaning sound and lost his mind. The earthquake that shook the ground stopped. I then breathed a sigh of relief.No matter how much he entered the explosion risk stage, Kang Seung-geon was only an S-rank, so there was no way he could compete with SS-rank Ha Tae-heon. If he had been an opponent who could be killed in the first place, it wouldn\u2019t have taken this much time.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s over.\u201dI got out of Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arms and returned his coat. It was then that the fatigue that I had forgotten came flooding in. I wanted to collapse and rest right away, but there was still an opponent left.\u201cWhat. I wonder why the earthquake stopped.\u201dI looked up at the relaxed tone of voice over my head. A doll was seen standing high above the rubble of the building. Perhaps the battle with Cheon Sa-yeon wasn\u2019t easy, the doll had no left arm under the elbow and the blade of its scythe was terribly broken. Still, the doll always seemed relaxed.\u201cYou really are a useless pig that doesn\u2019t live up to the expectations from start to finish. I can understand why Samael wanted to throw it away.\u201dSamael. That was the name I heard in the basement.\u2018Is the puppeteer who controls that doll and a guy named Samael a team?\u2019What if Samael was the person with the ability to control the mind that made Kang Seung-geon like that? The reason he kidnapped me was to control and use my mind like Kang Seung-geon?When I imagined myself assisting the doll or Kang Seung-geon with my wind ability while losing my mind, I got goosebumps all over my body.\u201cHuu, it\u2019s no fun if it ends like this, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe doll, who threw the broken scythe on the floor without hesitation, was cut in half and grabbed the burning left arm and ripped it off.\u00a0Crack, crack!\u00a0With a terrifying sound, its arm slid off its shoulder, red blood pouring down.\u201cCome on, good guy.\u201dThe doll made a sound by bumping the middle and thumb of its right hand with a voice full of laughter.\u00a0Tak, tak, tak. Kang Seung-geon, who had been knocked down by three-finger snaps, shook his body violently.\u201cKkuruk\u2026\u201dAn eerie sound echoed from Kang Seung-geon\u2019s neck, and at the same time, his upper body moved slowly. With his head and limbs drooping and his body lifted up, Kang Seung-geon began to bleed from his mouth, nose and eyes.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon called me, bewildered by the bizarre sight. As he threw himself at the doll, the doll raised the corners of its mouth and clapped its fingers again.Tak.It was then that the situation was grasped. I hurriedly raised my energy once more and put a strong wind on Cheon Sa-yeon. In that brief moment when Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword was swung towards the doll\u2019s neck, the doll\u2019s fingers collided for the last time.Tak!At the same time as the doll\u2019s neck was cut, Kang Seung-geon opened his eyes. Tears of blood flowed from his white with no black eyes and a painful scream erupted from his mouth.\u201cGu, uugh, guaaak!\u201dSharp energy emanated from Kang Seung-geon, who was writhing while grabbing his head with both hands. I flew into the air with Ha Tae-heon and checked the situation.Kugugugung!The ground beneath Kang Seung-geon\u2019s feet cracked and shook violently. As the stopped earthquake grew stronger, screams and the sound of collapsing buildings resounded from afar.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon!\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who burned the doll that had been disconnected from the puppeteer, turned to Kang Seung-geon at my cry. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s hair and clothes fluttered in the explosive energy of Kang Seung-geon.\u201cYou have to hold on until you run out of energy. Ha Tae-heon.\u201dThe heat diminished from the lava-like sticky blood that flowed through Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword. Ha Tae-heon, who immediately understood the meaning, released me and changed his weapon to a sword.\u201cPush to the limit. We have to make him use his ability to the limit.\u201dHa Tae-heon, who was far away from me, stood side by side with Cheon Sa-yeon and looked at Kang Seung-geon.\u00a0Crack, crack!\u00a0The ground cracked and dozens of stone debris were scattered here and there. As an A-rank, I couldn\u2019t get close to the explosive energy that came out.From now on, I thought it would be better to leave it to Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon and focus on supporting behind the scenes. I distanced myself from Kang Seung-geon and looked behind me.\u201cHere, someone help!\u201d\u201cBe careful! The fire has spread all the way here!\u201d\u201cPlease find my child!\u201dKang Seung-geon\u2019s ability to crumble and destroy the street was the worst. Woo Seo-hyuk, Kim Woo-jin, and Hong Si-ah helped the rescue operation, and Min Ah-rin and Cha Soo-yeon were looking out for the injured, but the situation was so sudden that it wasn\u2019t possible to fix it properly.Cries for help and ambulance sirens were heard everywhere at the same time. I used my ability to Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon, who wielded swords at Kang Seung-geon, swallowing dry saliva in the rush of nervousness. There was no more time to delay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, that was the case when Kang Seung-geon was regarded as an \u2018enemy\u2019.Even if the crime he committed was great, Kang Seung-geon wasn\u2019t a monster. He was even a master in charge of a guild, so Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon couldn\u2019t inflict fatal wounds on him.They must extract energy from Kang Seung-geon as quickly as possible through a menacing attack, but they must protect his life. Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon had to work together to achieve this difficult situation.Even the slightest mistake could kill Kang Seung-geon. What I had to do was to control the flow so that such an unfortunate incident didn\u2019t occur. That was the best.\u201cGrowl, growl!\u201dKang Seung-geon, who was shedding bloody tears with his eyes turned around, noticed the presence of Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon, who were closing the distance, and cried like a beast.\u00a0Crack, crack. Dozens of concrete debris that had been scattered around floated into the air.Cheon Sa-yeon, who had significantly reduced his energy compared to dealing with the doll, took the lead first. Cheon Sa-yeon, who flew through the air without difficulty with my ability, swung his sword at Kang Seung-geon without hesitation.Kuung!The black Kang Seung-geon, which was deliberately missed, passed by and smashed the ground. In line with that moment, I changed the flow of the wind so that the burning fire of Cheon Sa-yeon didn\u2019t come close to Kang Seung-geon.\u201cKuu, gu!\u201dThe clothes were torn and blood was oozing where Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s sword passed, but that much wound was okay. Rather, Kang Seung-geon, perhaps feeling a sense of crisis from the wound, exuded energy once more.When Kang Seung-geon stepped back to avoid Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s attack, Ha Tae-heon, who had been there beforehand, attacked. Ha Tae-heon, like Cheon Sa-yeon, swung his sword, aiming for the innocent ground, with little use of his ability. Despite the fact that the two looked after him openly, Kang Seung-geon was in a hurry to avoid the attack as his body wounded never ceased.\u2018The flow isn\u2019t bad. It could end a lot sooner than I expected.\u2019The amount of energy that Kang Seung-geon, who had lost his mind, radiated was enormous. Taking out that much energy at once would cause serious health problems, but frankly, that wasn\u2019t a problem we had to worry about. What we need to do now was just to get this situation sorted out quickly and prevent further damage\u2026\u201cKu, uaaargh!\u201dAt that moment, Kang Seung-geon let out a painful scream and spread his energy around him like a tsunami. My body was pushed back and I felt a tingling sensation on my skin. Like me, Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon, who were constantly pushing Kang Seung-geon, were also pushed back a little.Cough!At the same time as Kang Seung-geon spat out a handful of blood, the bewildering voices of people nearby were heard one after another. Something was strange. With an unusual sign, I hurriedly looked around.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHuge concrete fragments and debris were all floating in the air. The moment I discovered that the number sequence was going over, I had an ominous feeling.No way, this.\u201cCheon Sa-yeon!\u201dI shouted to Cheon Sa-yeon, who didn\u2019t know the situation yet because he was dealing with Kang Seung-geon.\u201cWait! If he runs out of energy right now\u2026!\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dBefore I could even finish my words, Kang Seung-geon bled again, and at the same time, a roar echoed from the east.Kuung\u2014!A huge shard of concrete flew high in the air and fell to the ground, a startled cry to run away and the cries of a child deafening my ears.I found the remaining debris floating in the air, shaking unsteadily, and the injured, unable to escape below it. The talented and rescue workers to help the evacuation moved quickly, but it was impossible to block them all because the distance between the debris was too far.Even as my brain was tangled in confusion, I quickly raised my energy. Contrary to Kang Seung-geon\u2019s gradually decreasing energy, now my energy had started to swell at a tremendous speed.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dI heard Ha Tae-heon\u2019s cry, but I ignored it and continued to gather energy. A huge tornado began to revolve around my body and the headache gradually worsened. I cut off all the energy I had sent to Cheon Sa-yeon and Ha Tae-heon, and concentrated on gathering my strength.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, stop it!\u201dAt the moment when Kang Seung-geon\u2019s body, who had lost consciousness, fell to the floor, debris floating in the air fell at the same time at high speed. I felt the vibration of the bracelet and the energy that reached the limit twisting at random, and violently exploded the wind I had been collecting.Huung!\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dWith a squeezing pain in my heart, the far-spread wind managed to block the fall of the debris. A terrifying feeling of pressure engulfed my whole body, more than I expected. I felt as if the debris that was supported were weighing down on my body, not the wind.Veins appeared on my forehead and my whole body trembled beyond control. The frightened injured could be seen beneath the concrete debris that had been blocked just before they hit the floor. I had to somehow hold on until they all escaped. I curled my upper body like a shrimp and bit my lips.\u2018I have to hold out for at least one minute\u2026\u2019Will I be able to endure it?The energy consumed to the ground began to stab my heart sharply.\u00a0Gasp, gasp\u2026 A rough breath rang in my ears as if I was suffocated.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dHearing Ha Tae-heon\u2019s call, I slowly closed my eyes and opened them. Little bit more. A little bit\u2026Just as I was trying to hold on, something hot hit my throat and came up. It was dark red blood filled with the fishy smell of iron that came out of my mouth without even being able to stop it.\u201cAh\u2026?\u201dThud. The hand that reflexively covered my mouth was quickly stained with blood. My vision was distorted and the energy that was blocking the debris was forcibly cut off.Kuung! Thud!As the wind blew away, I could hear the sound of the ground rumbled from here and there. At the same time, I also fell down.* * *\u201cHey there, Healer.\u201dAfter treatment of the injured, Min Ah-rin turned her attention to the call from behind her. A woman with her reddish, fine-grained hair tied into one came to her holding the little child in her arms.\u201cThe child hurt her leg, that\u2019s it. I think it\u2019s a little too much.\u201d\u201cI will see.\u201dDid she say her name is Cha Soo-yeon? Contrary to her picky appearance, she seemed quite familiar to soothe a child who was scared and cried.\u201cHuooong!\u201dAs Cha Soo-yeon said, the child was seriously injured in her knee. As she healed her wounds with her ability and wiped the blood, the child bowed her head toward Min Ah-rin and Cha Soo-yeon as if her pain had subsided.\u201cThank you.\u201dIt was cute to see her greet politely with a watery voice, which made her laugh. Min Ah-rin, who led the child to the paramedics, asked Cha Soo-yeon, who was standing next to her.\u201cDo you have a younger sibling?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, me?\u201d\u201cYes. You seem good at comforting children.\u201dCha Soo-yeon, who had never expected that Min Ah-rin would ask such a question first, shrugged her shoulders and opened her mouth with an awkward expression.\u201cAh, my relatives and brothers are young\u2026\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dCha Soo-yeon bowed her head, unable to make eye contact with Min Ah-rin, who smiled softly. Seeing that figure, Min Ah-rin thought to herself.\u2018Somewhere, Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0comes to mind. She\u2019s a funny guy.\u2019Unlike Min Ah-rin, who was relaxed, Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s mouth was dry at the sight of the other person who was staring at her.\u2018Why are you looking at me like that?\u2019Cha Soo-yeon, who had a shy personality, had no idea what to do because she had never been close to a rabbit-like person like Min Ah-rin.What did she do wrong? No? She wanted to run away right away, but even that was not easy because Min Ah-rin was openly watching her. Cha Soo-yeon kept her lips closed and endured Min Ah-rin\u2019s gaze.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201dIt was when Min Ah-rin, who had been staring at Cha Soo-yeon for a long time, just opened her mouth.Kugugung!The ground that had stopped shook again and the floor began to crack deeply. Cha Soo-yeon, who reflexively grabbed Min Ah-rin\u2019s body, looked to the west, where the battle was in full swing.\u201cThis, Blun Guild Master had another ability\u2026\u201d\u201cCha Soo-yeon-ssi, up there!\u201dMin Ah-rin pointed to the sky and shouted. Huge concrete debris continued to rise high. Even at a glance, that number was well over ten.Min Ah-rin frowned and looked around her quickly. It was full of injured people who hadn\u2019t yet been rescued. Even if they fell in this state.\u201cI can\u2019t. I have to go.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dMin Ah-rin grabbed Cha Soo-yeon\u2019s arm as she was about to run to Kang Seung-geon\u2019s place. She looked up at the sky and opened her mouth.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u2026\u201dAt those words, Cha Soo-yeon also found Han Yi-gyeol flying in the distance.\u00a0Huung, the wind created around him reached even to Cha Soo-yeon and Min Ah-rin, who were far away. Cha Soo-yeon, who felt her hair fluttering, exclaimed in a startled voice.\u201cWhat the hell is that idiot doing!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were on Han Yi-gyeol, who was making a strong gust of wind under the overcast sky with dark clouds. Not only the injured, but also Woo Seo-hyuk, who ran around the collapsed building to help rescuers, Kim Woo-jin, who rescued an injured person from a distorted car, and Hong Si-ah, who carried the fallen injured person on her back.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol!\u201dHa Tae-heon hurriedly shouted at the unusual energy, but Han Yi-gyeol cut off the wind that had been sent to Ha Tae-heon and Cheon Sa-yeon and gathered the energy.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol, stop it!\u201dHa Tae-heon cried out once again in the rush of anxiety. Even though he wasn\u2019t in good physical condition, using his energy to such an extent was like a suicade. He had to stop right away.As soon as it was confirmed that Kang Seung-geon had passed out, Ha Tae-heon ran towards Han Yi-gyeol. However, before he even arrived, concrete debris began to fall, and Han Yi-gyeol strongly exploded his ability that he had raised to the limit.\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201dThe gusts of wind that spread in all directions completely blocked the falling concrete debris.Ha Tae-heon resisted the wind strong enough to push his body and shortly after that, he found Han Yi-gyeol in pain in the air.\u201cNow! Rescue!\u201d\u201cGet away!\u201dHearing the voices of rescue from all directions, Ha Tae-heon moved his body again.Han Yi-gyeol, who was crouching down in his trembling body, carrying the pain all alone, was clearly etched into his mind. Would it have been the same then and now? As he recalled the memory of him leaving Han Yi-gyeol alone, a piercing pain spread in the corner of his chest as if stabbed by something sharp.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol\u2026!\u201dHe ran as hard as he could and when he was almost there, Han Yi-gyeol, who vomited blood from his mouth, fell down.\u00a0Kuung, kung!\u00a0Ha Tae-heon spread his arms as he stepped on the ground shaken by the collision of debris. And he safely received Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s body, which fell slowly due to the black dust.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHa Tae-heon breathed a sigh of relief as he hugged the man who had come into his arms. Luckily he wasn\u2019t late.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi!\u201dMin Ah-rin, who approached while being hugged by Cha Soo-yeon, quickly grabbed Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s hand. The wound on his head, which had barely stopped bleeding, burst again, and Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s white face, which had been vomited blood, was all covered in blood.\u201cI will fill you with energy first.\u201dMin Ah-rin stuttered and said with a pale face. Kim Woo-jin, who arrived later, also bit his lip with a painful expression when he saw Han Yi-gyeol, who had lost consciousness while being held in Ha Tae-heon\u2019s arms.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s over.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon said in a low voice, kicking Kang Seung-geon, who had fainted. Black smoke from the burnt doll spread over the cloudy sky.T/N :Yup, Yi-gyeol officially joined the holy trinity wwwww *he\u2019s already joined a long ago thoThe next one would be more dangerous than the first one here. Because he would lose his first \u2014- to Sa-yeon wwwww *slappedBut I admit it that he was awesome here and also when he was mad at Sa-yeon while fighting in the dungeon break(?) before.

The door to the hospital room where full of silence was opened and Min Ah-rin entered.\u201cWoo-jin-ssi. I thought you might be hungry, so I bought some sandwiches.\u201dMin Ah-rin smiled and placed a sandwich on Kim Woo-jin\u2019s hand. Kim Woo-jin, who happened to receive the sandwich, hesitated and said thank you.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u2026 hasn\u2019t woken up yet.\u201dMin Ah-rin turned her gaze away and looked at Han Yi-gyeol who was sleeping on the bed. She healed all his wounds and recovered his energy, but the shock he received on his body was so great that Han Yi-gyeol was unable to come to his senses for the second day.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s already been two days, are you sure he\u2019s really okay?\u201dKim Woo-jin asked with a depressed expression.

It wouldn\u2019t be that easy.\u2018\u2026Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u2019Min Ah-rin thought as she looked at his well-groomed face that didn\u2019t wake up with his eyes tightly closed.\u2018While you were sleeping, many people came and went.\u2019As well as the Master and Deputy Masters of the Roheon Guild, but also the Master and Deputy Masters of the Jayna Guild, they walked directly into the Requiem ward. Min Ah-rin thought of a man who looked particularly good in a black suit.Deputy Master of Roheon, Ha Tae-heon. Min Ah-rin couldn\u2019t hide her complicated mind as she stumbled upon him gently stroked the corners of Han Yi-gyeol\u2019s eyes and his cheeks while sleeping with determination.She saw an article that he had known Han Yi-gyeol from the beginning, but she never thought that it would be close enough to feel such strange feelings. Min Ah-rin, who was quite quick to catch on, noticed that there was something between Ha Tae-heon and Han Yi-gyeol that others didn\u2019t know.Cheon Sa-yeon was also a problem, but Roheon\u2019s Deputy Master. On top of that.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin put on a worried expression as she looked at Kim Woo-jin, who looked like a puppy who was whining at his sick owner.\u2018Yi-gyeol-ssi, what are you going to do?\u2019As she anticipated the surroundings of Han Yi-gyeol to become more intense and chaotic in the future, Min Ah-rin sighed inside.* * *A pleasant wind blew. I stared blankly at the flickering white curtains, someone grabbed my shoulder.\u201cHyung-nim, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dMy mind, which had been hazy as if in a dream, was cleared in an instant. Turning to my side, I saw blonde hair shining brightly in the sunlight.\u201cDid you sleep with your eyes open? I called several times, but there was no answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026did you?\u201dI had no idea. When I answered, stroking the nape of my neck in embarrassment, the guy put on a puzzled expression.\u201cWhat. Are you really sleepy? If you are very tired, sleep in my room.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not that bad.\u201dI looked around slowly. High ceilings and luxurious interiors. This house, which he called \u2018home\u2019, was quite large.\u201cWhat is urgent? You can take it easy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already 4 o\u2019clock, so what time will I wake up? It\u2019s going to get dark soon.\u201d\u201cJust sleepover tonight. After all, my father and mother went on a trip, so no one was there.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re annoying me.\u201dThe guy who shrugged playfully at my answer took the lead and walked down the hallway. Following him, I asked the question I had been curious about for a long time.\u201cHey, what about your sister?\u201d (\ub204\ub098, Noona = big sister)\u201cMy sister?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s doing well.\u201dAfter the awkward addition, the guy stopped his feet and looked back at me. Doubt lingered in his black eyes.\u201cI thought about it before.\u00a0Hyung-nim, are you interested in my sister?\u201d\u201c\u2026what do you mean by interested in. I just asked because I was curious about your family.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Hm, it doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201dThe man who had tilted his head took a step back. The place we stopped shortly after was in front of a light beige door.\u201cIt\u2019s the room I used to play with my sister when I was little, but it became a storage room because I didn\u2019t use it after I was a little bigger.\u201dThere was a sticker with his name on the doorknob he was pulling on. Yeon Seo-yoon. Yeon Seon-woo. (\uc5f0\uc11c\uc724. \uc5f0\uc120\uc6b0.)In the slightly dusty room, there was a large bookshelf full of old books and boxes stacked on the table with all sorts of junk. Yeon Seon-woo, who blew dust while waving his palms in the air, said to me.\u201cThere must be an album somewhere here, but the photos you are looking for are stuck there. Because we don\u2019t have photo frames in our house.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI nodded and opened the door of the nearest box. It was filled with sketchbooks and painting tools. Even if I didn\u2019t ask, I could guess who the owner was.\u201cProbably most of the boxes belong to my sister. Sketchbook, art supplies\u2026\u201dAt that explanation, I glanced at him and took out a sketchbook and unfolded it. Looking at the faded paper, it must have been a sketchbook that was used a long time ago, but the picture of the colourful fish swimming in the deep blue water was very atmospheric.I was only going to see one page, but before I knew it, my hand was turning to the next one. About four pages were passed, and the guy, who was looking at the book on the bookshelf, took the sketchbook from me.\u201cHyung-nim. Are you here to have fun?\u201d\u201c\u2026I haven\u2019t seen it in ten minutes.\u201d\u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t like people looking at her drawings without permission. If you are bored, look at this rather than a sketchbook.\u201dDoesn\u2019t like it? Then there was nothing I can do\u2026 Yeon Seon-woo held something out of my empty hand. When I received it unintentionally, it was a book with the title written in pure white letters on the all-black cover.\u201cAbyss?\u201dWhat\u2019s this? A book?\u201cIt\u2019s a novel. Read it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 I don\u2019t read things like this.\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s pretty fun. It\u2019s been stuck in this bookshelf for more than 10 years ago. It\u2019s not my father\u2019s taste, but who brought it.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even see my frown on my forehead, and he picked two or three more books with the same title from the bookshelf and put them next to me. What kind of novels were black and had only names written on them? No way, this\u2026\u201c\u2026why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a strange book.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s really just a novel. Well, it\u2019s a bit masculine kind.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with masculine? It\u2019s a strange book, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt means a book with a lot of women. The main character is a man\u2026\u00a0Hyung-nim, you really haven\u2019t read things like this, have you?\u201d\u201cWhy do you read such things?\u201dI flipped the book over carelessly and put it down as if tossing it. There was no interest. How could a letter arrangement like this be more interesting than her drawings?I wanted to see the sketchbook, but the owner of the drawing said she didn\u2019t want to be seen secretly\u2026 I gave up and searched other boxes for the original purpose photo.\u201cI\u2019ll bring the book when I get back later. Take it and read.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I\u2019m not going to read it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun tho?\u201dI smiled and lightly flicked my finger on Yeon Seon-woo\u2019s white forehead.Tak!\u201cAh, it hurts!\u201d\u201cI hit you because it hurts. Use your respectful words, dude.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really so old-fashioned\u2026\u201dOh, my.\u201cA child with a difference of more than ten years speaks informally, but it\u2019s only once or twice that he looks cute.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to hit my sister even if she speaks informally!\u201d\u201cThat kid doesn\u2019t use informal words like you. And even if she uses it, how can I hit a girl?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s discrimination!\u201dIt sounded like discrimination. I clicked my tongue and pushed a box to him.\u201cStop talking nonsense and go through the box. I will go as soon as I find the picture.\u201d\u201cRight away? Why? Eat dinner and go. I told Auntie to make something delicious.\u201d\u201cI am busy.\u201d\u201cAh, even you\u2019re busy, you have to eat rice! Eat before you go. Yes? Eat before you go,\u00a0Hyung!\u201dYeon Seon-woo began to beg in earnest while hanging on my arm with his large body. My heart fluttered slightly when I saw him calling me \u2018Hyung\u2019, who used to be sweet like a joke.What\u2019s wrong with dinner? Eat before I go then.\u201cUm, then\u2026\u201dJiiiiing.As I was about to answer yes, I stopped talking at the sound of vibrations from the inside of my suit jacket.\u201cHyung?\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dI pulled out the arm caught by Yeon Seon-woo and turned my back.\u00a0Jiiiing. In the meantime, the vibrations continued to be heard.The expected name was displayed on the screen of the cell phone I took out.\u00a0Jiing. Looking down at the trembling cell phone, I noticed that the surroundings were filled with pitch-black darkness.The smell of old books, the box full of craters, and Yeon Seon-woo, who told me to go to dinner, were all swallowed up by the darkness. All that was left in my hand was an obsessive phone call that was choking my breath.\u201cHaa.\u201dTaking a deep breath, I answered the phone. As soon as I brought the phone to my ear, a pure white light broke through the darkness that filled my eyes.* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dAs soon as I opened my eyes, I heard a voice I didn\u2019t want to hear. I raised my stiff upper body and twisted my face.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cYou woke up after 3 days and 8 hours and 12 minutes.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who looked at his watch and spoke naturally, looked at me and smiled. Even though I had just woken up, I was exhausted. Ah, I want to sleep again.\u201c\u2026why are you here?\u201d\u201cDo you hate me being here?\u201dWould that be nice? I looked around the hospital room just in case. Unfortunately, there was no one but Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are talking about.\u201d\u201cI mean Kim Woo-jin or Min Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cWell?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon gave a simple answer with a look of ignorance, but I had a strong feeling that he knew for some reason but deliberately pretended not to know. Yeah. What did you expect, me.T/N :FINALLY!! THE BLONDE GUY HAS A NAME!!I still haven\u2019t figured it out how they met. You know, Seon-woo was basically a rich kid, a chaebol. How could he meet a gangster like our MC?I don\u2019t read spoiler anymore so I just guess that the one who stabbed our MC probably another brother? Since his inveronment was like that\u2026Here, I add their picture that maybe taken in that room. Or from the previous chapter.

    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI had already had an annoying dream, so my mood went down endlessly. I asked Cheon Sa-yeon, trying to push away the memories of the past that remained in the corner of my head.\u201cWhat is the situation?\u201dThe voice that came out of my parched throat was harsh as sandpaper. He said that I woke up in 3 days, so I wondered if things had been sorted out to some extent after I passed out.Cheon Sa-yeon handed a cup of lukewarm water and answered with a relaxed attitude.\u201cThere are quite a few injured, but no deaths. Someone who lives somewhere was able to evacuate thanks to unreasonable force.\u201dI felt a thorn in the words, but I pretended not to know and drank the water.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. What about broken roads or buildings?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still being resolved. However, each guild has selected and sent guild members to help with the restoration work, so I think it will be resolved to some extent in a month.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who took the empty cup naturally, raised the corner of his mouth slightly.\u201cWash up and come out. We\u2019ll talk about the rest after that.\u201d\u201c\u2026are you going to wait? Aren\u2019t you busy?\u201d\u201cCan I give you a hand?\u201dCheon Sa-yeon held out his hand, saying something else. Get out, you bastard. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s white hands clapped and I walked to the bathroom.\u201cI put clothes to change in the cabinet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEither way, his sense was good for nothing. I took a deep breath and opened the bathroom door.* * *After showering, I put on only my underwear and pants, and just held my shirt in my hand. Water kept dripping from my wet hair, so I thought it would be better to wear it after it dried a little. After roughly brushing my hair a few times, I opened the bathroom door.Cheon Sa-yeon, who was sitting on the bed with his arms folded, raised one eyebrow when I came out of the bathroom.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cIs it a gift?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCrazy guy. You\u2019re talking nonsense like a gift. Seeing my miserably distorted face, Cheon Sa-yeon smiled brightly.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say something like that, get out.\u201d\u201cHow cold-hearted.\u201dI swept my bangs away, which was wet and covered my eyes. Drops of water dripped from the ends of my hair and ran down my collarbone and onto my chest. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s gaze turned to the water droplet for a moment.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon rose from his seat and opened his mouth.\u201cYou must have something to tell me.\u201dAs I met his black eyes, I frowned. Yeah, there was. For some reason, it was embarrassing to speak plainly.\u2018I feel bad.\u2019In this case, it would have been better to pull out. Naturally, I averted my gaze and answered.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon came closer to me, perhaps noticing that I was trying to run away. A cold wall touched my back as I reflexively retreated into the narrowed distance.\u201cLying isn\u2019t that fun.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 ugh.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon grabbed my neck in an instant. His unconcerned touch made my breath suffocate and a piercing pain rose.\u2018Fuck, this bastard again!\u2019I cursed Cheon Sa-yeon inside and grabbed Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s wrist with an empty hand to escape. However, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t get it off.\u201cLet me go, you motherfucker.\u201d\u201cAt that time. In front of the island gate.\u201dThe eyes looking at me were very cold. Perhaps he loosened it on purpose, or cold energy flowed from the close Cheon Sa-yeon, and my body hardened. Like prey in front of a predator, I felt my hand shaking and swallowed dry saliva.\u201cWho came when I was away?\u201d\u201cHa, you crazy bastard. That still\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say, Yi-gyeol-ah.\u201d\u201cKeuk!\u201dIt hurt\u2026! An excruciating pain swept from the captured neck. Cheon Sa-yeon pushed me against the wall as I instinctively struggled to escape, twisting the corners of his mouth and smiling.\u00a0Tuk, the white shirt I was holding fell to the floor.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to pretend you don\u2019t, do it properly. You didn\u2019t want me to know after putting out the t-shirt?\u201d\u201cGasp, uh\u2026!\u201d\u201cWho is it? Ha Tae-heon? Hm. I wouldn\u2019t have time for that. If not Ha Tae-heon\u2026\u201dThe feel of the collar touching my bare skin was creepy. Cheon Sa-yeon, who had been contemplating for a while looking at me exhaling colourfully, slightly tilted his head.\u201cIs it Lee Joo-ha?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s what Lee Joo-ha has to say\u2026 ah. Ha Tae-heon\u2019s SS-class coat?\u201dThe force on my neck grew stronger. I closed my eyes tightly and opened them as I felt my face flush with blood.\u201cIs it just that? Really?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnswer me, Han Yi-gyeol.\u201dHe didn\u2019t release the hand that strangled my neck to answer. I struggled to open my mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s, right.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s more boring than I thought.\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who muttered with an indifferent expression, released my neck. A dry cough burst out of my throat as I quickly caught my breath. The tears that were barely hanging from the corners of my eyes fell.\u201cHaa, haa\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon said as he looked at me panting while touching the neck that must have left a mark.\u201cWhen I asked what you were dissatisfied with, was it just that? What encouraged Ha Tae-heon did to make you suspicious?\u201d\u201cCough, ha\u2026 then what?\u201dSuppressing something hot coming up from the depths, I answered. Cheon Sa-yeon made a face that he couldn\u2019t really understand.\u201cHan Yi-gyeol. How did you know where the SS-class coat was and how you got it\u2026 You must know why I didn\u2019t ask. Aren\u2019t you and I in the same boat?\u201dContrary to the cold gaze, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s voice was so sweet.\u201cWe respect what we hide from each other, and we don\u2019t wonder. Have you already forgotten?\u201d\u201c\u2026someone who knows that, pushes you like this?\u201d\u201cNow this is different. How can I pretend to be ignorant when you say that you are offended by me?\u201dHe was very selfish, just doing whatever he wanted to do. To me, who was laughing in vain because it was ridiculous, I frowned slightly as if I was sorry for Cheon Sa-yeon.\u201cI was hoping, Han Yi-gyeol, that you had a more useful thought. That\u2019s too bad. Just like that\u2026\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dI was so annoyed that I didn\u2019t want to listen anymore. After cutting off Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words, I grabbed my sore throat and opened my mouth.\u201cThe fact that you did that kind of shit in a place I didn\u2019t know was just that annoying.\u201dDid you think that there was nothing you wanted to ask about me? Even after entering the gate of the G5 Area, I struggled to get my head around trying to figure out what Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s intention was.However, in the end, what was left in my mind.\u201cYou look stupid. Still, this is me.\u201dIt was just the feeling of betrayal from Cheon Sa-yeon that I felt for a moment.Pathetic and absurd, I believed in Cheon Sa-yeon. In the actions he showed me, I misunderstood that there must have been some sincerity.\u201cStill, there\u2019s no second time.\u201dFeeling the pain rising from my neck, I lifted my head and looked at Cheon Sa-yeon. The smile on his face, which was shadowed by the light of the light, had disappeared.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not stupid enough to believe it even after being like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCheon Sa-yeon, who opened his mouth to say something, closed it again without spitting out anything. Blinking slowly, he sighed.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s really, disappointing.\u201dIt was a dry evaluation, without feeling any emotions. Cheon Sa-yeon touched his watch, which had turned slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen twice, so I should say I\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust take a break today. Visits are prohibited, so we postpone meeting people until tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was an unexpected word. I couldn\u2019t follow the flow of the conversation and only blinked, but Cheon Sa-yeon poured out his words without paying any attention.\u201cWe have security personnel in place, so don\u2019t think about escaping and stay calm. Healer Min Ah-rin will be sent tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dBefore I could even ask, Cheon Sa-yeon left the hospital room without looking back. Left alone in an instant, I stared blankly at the tightly closed door of the hospital room.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dHad you banned visits? So, was that why Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin weren\u2019t here?It was ridiculous when he brazenly replied that he didn\u2019t know me who was looking for Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin.As I turned my gaze, the face of Han Yi-gyeol, who was frowned upon in the mirror hanging on the wall, was reflected. A faint red mark remained on his neck, as expected.\u201cIt\u2019s really, disappointing.\u201dAs I blankly looked in the mirror and touched my neck, Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s words I just heard echoed in my ears.Disappointing? Who said that. That being said, I was disappointed in the first place.\u201c\u2026anyway, you annoying bastard.\u201dI turned around and picked up the shirt I had dropped earlier. My hair was still damp, but not to the point of dripping water, I just brushed off my shirt before putting it on.Even when I just woke up, my body felt heavy. After the unpleasant dream, I received Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s temper and there was no stamina left.After I roughly buttoned my shirt, I flew over the bed as if I was falling down. I closed my eyes as I felt the soft blanket on my face.* * *There was something faintly visible through the pitch-black darkness. A steak with red blood was placed on a smooth plate.\u00a0Dalgak. Dalgak.\u00a0A voice filled with laughter could be heard through the sound of dishes hitting each other.\u201cAre you doing a ritual? Why don\u2019t you eat it?\u201dClick.\u00a0He put down the knife he was holding in his blood-soaked white hand.\u201cOops. Is it too much to eat meat because your mouth is swollen? Sorry, sorry. I forgot.\u201dShortly after those words were said, a bowl of pure white porridge was placed on a table full of food.\u201cEat it,\u00a0ung? Don\u2019t look at me with those eyes. Yesterday I was so bad. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHo\u2026\u00a0gasp,\u00a0keuk\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, but I\u2019m under a bit of stress these days. You understand, right? I don\u2019t usually\u2026\u201d\u201cCough, cough.\u201d\u201cAh, shit.\u201dAs the moans filled with pain were heard continuously, the lips that had been spitting out excuses twisted unpleasantly.\u201cYa, Seokjae-ya\u00a0(\uc11d\uc7ac). Please clean that up. I\u2019m having important conversations, but\u00a0it\u00a0keeps cutting off.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow far have you been? \u2026ah, why are you making that face again?\u201dA man who had been lying on the floor with his whole body crippled was dragged away with his back caught at the order. Thick blood ran along the man\u2019s body as he got away from it for a long time.\u201cShould I not kill him? At your request, I can spare you at least one of those things.\u201dDalgak. Dalgak.\u00a0The sound of tableware hitting rang out again.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if he has the money for treatment. He didn\u2019t even have a single thousand won bills, so it\u2019s like that. In that case, wouldn\u2019t it be more convenient for me to just kill him quickly?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really cute. The fact that you could still put on that expression even though I rolled\u00a0it\u00a0like that\u2026 Are you born with it?\u201dThe dishes that were full in front of him were scattered like smoke.\u201cYou give affection easily, trust easily, and then pretend you don\u2019t and get hurt. Like a dog chasing after people even if it\u2019s abandoned\u2026\u201d* * *When I opened my eyes, the muffled voice disappeared. I smiled bitterly at the bitterness.I guess so. I thought I had fixed it to some extent, but it must have been an illusion.In the end, the past I couldn\u2019t shake off weighed heavily on my back.T/N :Are you confused? Same wwwwwNo no no. I reread almost fifth times so I could grasp what happened here. Skip if you get annoying from my comment ( \u2579\u25bd\u2579 )First; the relationship between Sa-yeon and Yi-gyeol is the same as \u201cfriends with benefit\u201d. Like some cliche stories, Sa-yeon here is in denial, he cares but he always (tries to) focus on his purpose (because it\u2019s not the time he thinks about his \u2018human\u2019 feeling). On other hand, Yi-gyeol unsciously \u201chas\u201d a feeling for Sa-yeon, I mean he feels Sa-yeon\u2019s sincerity (even though in the end Sa-yeon said no). That\u2019s why he feels a betrayal from him.Second; at first, I thought it was the scene with the antagonist (Samael) but nope. It\u2019s MC and his \u201cboss\u201d. In the previous chap, his boss called him and got mad so he beat MC and the other one (dunno who).Third; MC knew it was a dream but he admitted that he \u201cgave affection easily, trusted easily, and then pretended he didn\u2019t and got hurt\u201d. Damn it, I can\u2019t breath properly after reading this again.If you\u2019re curious about the boss. Here\u2019s the picture. Official from Author-nim. Handsome\u2026 Hot daddy shit. Somehow I can\u2019t disapprove him to be with our MC\u2026 \u0ca0_\u0ca0Thank you for following us!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Don\u2019t Want This ReincarnationCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next morning, as soon as the visit ban was lifted, Kim Woo-jin and Min Ah-rin came to the hospital room. While I was having breakfast with the high-quality lunch box brought to me by Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s attendant, I greeted them with a sausage in my mouth.\u201cWelcome.\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi\u2026 haa.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dMin Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin, who faced me when I leisurely waved my hand to them, sighed one after another. Why were you like this in the morning? Min Ah-rin said with a sad expression when I looked at her blankly. (\ud55c\uac00\ub86d\uac8c \uc190\uc744 \uc124\ub801\uc124\ub801 \ud754\ub4dc\ub294 \ub0a0 \ub9c8\uc8fc\ud55c \ubbfc\uc544\ub9b0\uacfc \uae40\uc6b0\uc9c4\uc774 \uc5f0\ub2ec\uc544 \ud55c\uc228\uc744\ud479 \ub0b4\uc26c\uc5c8\ub2e4, not sure how to translate it)\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi. Are you eating now?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I will clean it up.\u201dIndeed. It was a little rude to invite guests while eating. As I was about to put it away, Min Ah-rin, startled, grabbed my arm.\u201cNo, it\u2019s a joke. Please eat.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d\u201cI and Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0ate together. So eat.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dDid you mean you two were that close? Looking back at Kim Woo-jin with a bewildered feeling, the guy averted his gaze and nodded his head.If so then\u2026 I put down my lunch box again and picked up a spoon.\u201cEat slowly. I have something to talk about anyway.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who approached me, took chopsticks and placed a side dish of herbs on a spoon with only bare rice. What, you didn\u2019t need to because my arm wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Sit down, Kim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cYou eat it all.\u201dEven though I pushed it a little because it was burdensome, he was firm. In the meantime, Kim Woo-jin\u2019s body felt in my hand was much harder than expected.I looked at Kim Woo-jin again with pride. Not only did he practice his skills, but he also trained his body. Come to think of it, he was able to show his proficiency in many ways when he was dealing with Kang Seung-geon.\u201cWh, what? Why do you look at me like that?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who noticed my gaze, frowned and dyed his ears red. It was all good, but he was still covering his face like that.Min Ah-rin took a bottle of water from the refrigerator and poured water into the cup, opening her mouth first.\u201cWhat should I tell you first\u2026 in line with the duty of a healer, can I talk about Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s physical condition first?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dFor some reason, I felt a chill in her voice and my body trembled. Min Ah-rin smiled as she looked at me with her shoulders shrugged and sat down on the empty chair and continued her words.\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi. You already know that using energy carelessly is not good for your body, right?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI hesitated and avoided answering.The explanation from Do Ha-seok, an S-rank healer I met in the Roheon Guild hospital room, flashed through my mind. He said it was similar with drawing blood until your life was in danger.\u201cEven if doctor and healer treat you for internal injuries or trauma after making concessions a hundred times, it\u2019s very dangerous because the shocks from using your energy recklessly accumulate. You have to be really careful from now on.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who spoke up there, bowed her head with her gloomy expression.\u201cOf course, many people have saved their lives thanks to Yi-gyeol-ssi. Everyone is thankful to Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cMin Ah-rin-ssi.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m Yi-gyeol-ssi\u2019s friend. As much as me and Woo-jin-ssi, I think we should be worried about Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dAlong with Min Ah-rin\u2019s sincerity, there was also the concern that she might be perceived as excessive interference. I couldn\u2019t hold back the soft laughter that flowed out and answered.\u201cThank you, Min Ah-rin-ssi. Really.\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dMin Ah-rin, who raised her face at my thanks, smiled with relief. I was sincerely grateful to Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin for being by my side whenever I had a hard time. If I had a chance someday, I wanted to respond to the kindness they showed me.\u201cGood. So, let\u2019s stop talking about energy here\u2026 do you want me to tell you a little bit about Master Kang Seung-geon?\u201d\u201cYes. Even if I didn\u2019t want to, I was curious. I watched the news yesterday, but there\u2019s a limit to the information.\u201dThere was food left in the lunch box, but my appetite was gone. When I closed the lid of the lunch box and asked, Min Ah-rin nodded her head and answered.\u201cThere is a Psychiatric Research Centre in the basement of the management headquarters. I heard that Master Kang Seung-geon is currently receiving treatment there.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 it\u2019s sure that he had been possessed by mind controller.\u201d\u201cYes. The treatment is said to be in progress while wearing a shutter item\u2026 Even if he doesn\u2019t have a shutter item, he probably won\u2019t be able to use his ability properly. His body must have been damaged a lot by using too much energy. In the future, he won\u2019t be able to use his ability like he used to.\u201dI remembered Kang Seung-geon, who vomited blood and forcibly used his ability.\u201cIt is said that the whereabouts of the puppeteer who manipulated the doll or the person with the ability to control the mind of Master Kang Seung-geon haven\u2019t been identified yet. Yi-gyeol-ssi, please be careful for the time being. I\u2019m anxious.\u201d\u201cI will. Please be careful as Min Ah-rin-ssi\u00a0doesn\u2019t know either. Kim Woo-jin you too.\u201dI agreed with Min Ah-rin\u2019s words. The puppeteer was also dangerous, but the more fearful opponent was a person with the ability to control Kang Seung-geon\u2019s mind. It was impossible to even predict under what conditions the ability would be activated, so it was right to save myself.Kim Woo-jin, who was quietly standing at my request and listening to Min Ah-rin\u2019s conversation, pouted his mouth and grumbled dissatisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, so be careful. Make sure to keep in touch\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I a kid?\u201dThe word \u2018keep in touch\u2019 reminded me of my cell phone. Where is it, my phone?\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\u201cMy cell phone\u2026\u201dNo matter how much I looked around, I couldn\u2019t find my phone. I asked Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin who were puzzled.\u201cHave you not seen my cell phone?\u201d\u201cHere. I got it.\u201dKim Woo-jin pulled out the cell phone from the hooded zip-up pocket he was wearing and held it out. Oh, thank you.\u201cI thought I lost it.\u201d\u201cTake your cell phone with you. I also check that you have been contacted from time to time. Please.\u201dThe word \u2018please\u2019 at the end was pretty serious. I understood the frustration, but it was because there were so many crazy things. It wasn\u2019t going well.\u201cBy the way, Yi-gyeol-ssi.\u201dAs I touched my cell phone that was turned off, Min Ah-rin said in a bright voice.\u201cA lot of people came and went while you passed out. Shouldn\u2019t you say hello to them?\u201d\u201cDid a lot of people come?\u201dWas there anyone who would come to see me? Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026 I met him yesterday.\u201cWho?\u201dNo matter how much I thought about it, no one came to mind. When I tilted my head to ask, Min Ah-rin with her subtle eyes gave me the answer.\u201cFirst of all, the Master and Deputy Master of Roheon Guild came and went first, and Cha Soo-yeon-ssi\u00a0also stopped by with the Master of Jayna Guild. Secretary Woo Seo-hyuk also took time to come while he was busy\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, wait a minute.\u201dRoheon Guild Master and Deputy Master\u2026 Lee Joo-ha and Ha Tae-heon were here? Besides, what about Hong Si-ah and Cha Soo-yeon? Why was Woo Seo-hyuk too?\u201cDid they really come and go? Here, to the Requiem hospital room?\u201d\u201cYes. I was surprised too.\u201d\u201cUum.\u201dCome to think of it, Ha Tae-heon was also at the scene. I didn\u2019t know how he got there, but she said he stopped by while I passed out, so maybe he had something important to say.\u201cBesides them, media reporters and officials from the management headquarters constantly came to see Yi-gyeol-ssi. Officials from the management headquarters had been kicked out, but the reporters really tried to push in.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Because the video showed Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0saving people. It\u2019s a mess online, too. At worst, Master must have increased the number of security guards and placed a ban on visits. At least, that\u2019s how it calmed me down.\u201dMin Ah-rin sighed with a tired look on her face. I blinked at the unexpected words. Cheon Sa-yeon\u2026\u2018I thought it was banned to keep Min Ah-rin and Kim Woo-jin from seeing me, but was that the reason?\u2019To be honest, I thought that the purpose of confinement was to have security personnel deployed.Cheon Sa-yeon\u2019s incomprehensible attitude became complicated in his attitude who was cold-hearted while helping the important part. Frowning, I remembered Cheon Sa-yeon, who looked down at me with cold eyes yesterday.\u201cIt\u2019s really, disappointing.\u201dPerhaps\u2026 this might be the last time to help out in this way. If you said you were disappointed with me, your interest or interest must have gone away. What would happen with the partner relationship? (\ud611\ub825 \uad00\uacc4, actually I\u2019m not sure how to name this)\u201cHan Yi-gyeol?\u201dAs I kept my mouth shut without saying anything, Kim Woo-jin, who thought it was strange, grabbed my shoulder lightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you sick?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing.\u201dI grinned bitterly, pushing the thoughts of Cheon Sa-yeon into the corner of my head.\u201cI think it would be better for you to rest here today and go back to your room tomorrow.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go out for a while. Wherever you go, you go with me.\u201dKim Woo-jin also added a word to Min Ah-rin\u2019s worried words. I awkwardly wiped the back of my neck and avoided the gaze.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need to do it.\u201d\u201cI need it!\u201dSurprised. My body trembled at the sight of the two of them answering firmly as if they matched each other. Min Ah-rin said with a rare hard expression.\u201cI\u2019ve felt this for a long time, but Yi-gyeol-ssi\u00a0doesn\u2019t have a sense of crisis. That\u2019s why you keep getting hurt and kidnapped!\u201d\u201cYes? No, that.\u201d\u201cSo from now on, wherever you go, take Woo-jin-ssi\u00a0with you. Understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYi-gyeol-ssi.\u201d\u201cUm, yes. I understand.\u201dWhen I rolled my eyes and answered slowly, Min Ah-rin, who was looking at me suspiciously for a moment, sighed.\u201cI see. I don\u2019t really believe it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait and see!\u201dMin Ah-rin was serious, but in my eyes, she just looked cute. Min Ah-rin, who looked at the watch, got up and said.\u201cI have a schedule, I will go. Yi-gyeol-ssi, Woo-jin-ssi. See you later.\u201d\u201cBye.\u201dAfter seeing Min Ah-rin leaving the hospital room, I turned my attention to Kim Woo-jin, who was putting away the lunch box.\u201cKim Woojin. What about your body?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes. At that time, your body\u2026 you were seriously injured.\u201dEven if it was a clone, I didn\u2019t want to say that he was dead. Kim Woo-jin, who blinked at my question, slightly blushed.\u201cUung, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNext time, don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dKim Woo-jin frowned slightly and opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying so hard to be of some help to you. It would have been cleaner if I had more time to practice, but I have no regrets.\u201d\u201cKim Woo-jin.\u201d\u201cI told you. I\u2019ll be by your side no matter what you do. Without you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to become an A-rank.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who looked at me with a hesitant expression, cautiously grabbed my hand. His stiff hands trembled slightly as if he was nervous.\u201cI want to stay by your side and help you. Can\u2019t I?\u201dCan\u2019t you? I breathed out of frustration and hold Kim Woo-jin\u2019s stiff hand.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do. I\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201dKim Woo-jin, who wasn\u2019t immune to these words, quickly turned red. Kim Woo-jin, who was restless, pulled out his grasped hand and bowed his head.\u201cOf, of course, I will do that. I\u2019m going to.\u201d\u201cI mean, don\u2019t overdo it. I will be more careful, too.\u201d\u201cUung.\u201dGreat. Let\u2019s stop talking about this. Even if I didn\u2019t, I had something to ask from Kim Woo-jin.T/N :Even Sa-yeon did bad things but he knew when he should stop. He\u2019s that rational. Kinda.I try to think objectively but uuuunggghhh no. I can\u2019t. In the end, I will be bias to Sa-yeon wwwwwAnd Woo-jin\u2026 When will you get used to it!? Wwwww he hasn\u2019t immuned to Yi-gyeol\u2019s affection words yet. Poor Woo-jin\u2019s heart lol (\u3064\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\u3064Thank you for following us!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
