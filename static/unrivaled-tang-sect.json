Tang San\u2019s FamilyThe gentle halos of light were akin to a mother\u2019s pair of hands when they gently touched the delicate skin of the clouds, creating an exceptionally beautiful feeling that seemed tangible within the illusory space. There also seemed to be an indistinct yet majestic palace not far away, but nearly seemed like an illusion as the gentle halo of light touched it.A figure quietly stood within the clouds for a long time, gazing into the endless distance at something.He had long blue hair that draped to the floor like a waterfall. If not for his imposing stature and his wide shoulders, he might\u2019ve been confused with a girl\u2014if you only looked at him from behind.His luxurious blue robes seemed to contain rippling water. If one were to carefully look at it, their gaze would instantly be drawn to his deep-azure coloured robes; their entire soul might even be absorbed into the deep and boundless blue colour that seemed to resemble an ocean.However, from the pair of equally deep eyes on his handsome face, it didn\u2019t look like he was over twenty. His eyes were like black holes, yet at the same time, they seemed all-embracing. Occasionally, a purple flash would flicker through his eyes, which would astonish one\u2019s soul. This would instantly create a beautiful feeling, one that could determine one\u2019s life or death.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d The man lightly sighed, a faintly distressed look appearing upon his face. He slightly furrowed his brow, as if he was currently comprehending the secrets of heaven and earth.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d A soft voice echoed out. A figure stepped out from the illusory space, arriving beside the blue-clothed young man. She habitually held the man\u2019s arm in a gentle manner. The smoothness of her action made it seem as though she\u2019d done it countless times in the past.She was wearing a pink-coloured long dress and she had long hair that had been braided, which was gently draped behind her back. You could see her exquisitely slender and beautiful white neck from behind, while her long dress tightly wrapped around her waist, further accenting her perfect figure.A faint smile appeared on her beautiful face as she pulled the on the blue-shirted man\u2019s arm. She gently laid her head on his shoulder, causing her braids to fall next the the man\u2019s long blue hair. They quietly curled around his hair, twisting the man\u2019s long hair.A loving smile that contained a trace of helplessness appeared on the blue-shirted man\u2019s handsome face, \u201cEven though you\u2019re a mother already, you\u2019re still so naughty.\u201dThe woman wearing the pink dress was somewhat discontent as she pouted, \u201cSo what if I\u2019m a mother now? Does that mean that I can\u2019t throw a tantrum? Aren\u2019t you still called Tang San, even though you\u2019re now the Enforcer of the God Realm, and the God of the Sea? You\u2019re still my Third Brother.\u201dOnce Xiao Wu heard Tang San bring up their daughter, a gentle look instantly filled her eyes, \u201cXiao Qi is simply too clingy. We only have time together when she\u2019s sleeping. Third Brother, I saw that you were displeased earlier\u2026 is it because of issues within the Douluo Continent?\u201dTang San nodded his head as he lightly sighed and said, \u201cA single day in the God Realm is equivalent to a year in the mortal world. This is true for every single plane. I had originally wanted to stay in the Douluo Continent for a period of time, but I was forced to return to the God Realm in order to take care of the general situation here, due to a bet between the Godkings, Kindness, and Evil. However, I didn\u2019t think that the Tang Sect would\u2019ve decayed after only twenty or so years within the God Realm, which is equivalent to ten thousand years in the Douluo Continent.\u201dXiao Wu unhappily said, \u201cKindness and Evil are simply too crafty. They\u2019re too irresponsible, using their bet as an excuse to descend to the mortal world. They previously found a married couple to replace their Godly Position. However, the couple\u2019s previous experience was simply too pitiful. If not for that, you could\u2019ve let them take care of the general situation here, and could\u2019ve relaxed a bit more.\u201dTang San said, \u201cFrom the outside, the Enforcer and Godking positions appear to be quite lofty positions, but they aren\u2019t responsibilities that everyone is willing to undertake! The Douluo Continent has clearly become somewhat chaotic due to the changes that have occurred within the past ten thousand years\u2014especially the continental collision that happened due to the shifting of the earth\u2019s crust, four thousand years ago. Not only did it cause the Douluo Continent to more than double in size, it also caused many changes to happen to the Douluo Continent.\u201dXiao Wu said, \u201cThe Tang Sect also began declining at that time! Third Brother, you shouldn\u2019t think too much about it. In a way, the Tang Sect\u2019s decline can also be attributed to the progress of both time, and the plane itself.\u201dTang San nodded his head, \u201cYou\u2019re right, but after all, the Tang Sect was created by me. I really would hate for it to be destroyed because of this, but sadly I can\u2019t interfere in the changes of a plane, since I\u2019m the Enforcer of the God Realm. However, it seems that a new star will soon rise within the Douluo Continent, and he will be extremely closely linked to my Tang Sect. I\u2019ll try to get a clearer look at his destiny, but so far it\u2019s heavily clouded. I hope that everything will develop in a good direction.\u201dXiao Wu\u2019s eyes brightened as she replied, \u201cHe\u2019ll definitely be a good candidate, since even you say that he\u2019s a new star. If he could even take over your Godly Position in the future, wouldn\u2019t we then have time to go play around?\u201dTang San raised his hand and lovingly pinched her nose, \u201cYou! You only know how to play.\u201dWhile they were talking, a small head popped out from some nearby clouds. She looked about eleven or twelve, and her beautiful round eyes blinked. Her appearance was extremely similar to Tang San\u2019s, but her body was much softer, and her eyes were closer to Xiao Wu\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019ve always heard dad and mom talking about the Douluo Continent! It seems really fun! Hee hee.\u201d Her petite body quietly disappeared into the clouds as she spoke.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The ancient workmanship that had been used to create the palace\u2019s golden roof and red doors caused people to involuntarily feel a sense of seriousness when they saw it.When gazed at from afar, a fog seemed to linger around the palace. The buildings that surrounded the palace were lined up neatly, just like the pattern a brick wall had. The area that they occupied seemed limitless to the naked eye. The two words \u2018Duke\u2019s Mansion\u2019 were carved into the fifty-foot tall archway that stood in front of the entrance.This enormous mansion that occupied an area of over 2 kilometres didn\u2019t belong to a city. Instead, it was a singular building located fifty meters northwest of the capital of the Star Luo Empire, Star Luo City. From this you could see that the owner of this mansion held an honored position within the Star Luo Empire.During the current time of day, the bright and beautiful sunlight would shine on the sparkling glazed roof tiles, causing a layer of dazzling gold to cover the entirety of the Duke\u2019s Mansion. You could even vaguely see this scene atop Star Luo City\u2019s city walls.The back door of the Duke\u2019s Mansion\u2019s northern area noiselessly opened, and a skinny figure quietly snuck out.The figure was a youth that appeared to be around eleven or twelve. His stature was reasonably proportioned, and he was wearing a grey cloth shirt that was simple but clean. He also had a small bundle of cloth on his back. His short black hair appeared neat and tidy. A determined look, which was filled with an intensity that surpassed all of his peers at the same age, was present on his handsome face.After softly closing the back door of the Duke\u2019s Mansion behind him, the youth rapidly ran a few steps forward. However, he suddenly stopped to look back at the Duke\u2019s mansion, his deep blue eyes brimming with hatred.\u201cMother, watch me from the land of the deceased. No matter how hard I have to work, there will be a day when I return, and trample everything here underneath my foot. Therefore, I\u2019ll honour you by changing my surname to yours\u2014Huo. From now on, my name will be Huo Yuhao.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, he turned to face the Duke\u2019s Mansion, and gazed at it deeply. Then, he turned around and walked away without any second thoughts.He didn\u2019t head towards Star Luo City, which was located to the southwest of the Duke\u2019s Mansion. Instead, he went north. His tiny figure gradually disappeared into the distance as the strong midday sunlight shone on him. Although his body was skinny, the way in which he\u2019d left didn\u2019t give off a helpless feeling at all.There were wide roads on all sides of the Duke\u2019s Mansion. Huo Yuhao continued to run forward, his eyes gradually turning redder and redder.\u201cMother\u2026\u201d The unwilling and unresigned look that his mother had had as she passed away unconsciously appeared in Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind, causing him to tightly clench his teeth.I have to become stronger! Mother taught me that a person can only rely on themselves. One can only live a better life if they are strong.Scenes from Huo Yuhao\u2019s memory unceasingly flashed through his mind.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother had been one of the Duke\u2019s personal maids, and had grown up together with the Duke. A personal maid only existed for the simple sake of serving her master, but Huo Yuhao had quietly appeared within his mother\u2019s belly one night, twelve years ago.She was pregnant for ten months, before she finally gave birth one day.Despite what identity Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother previously had, he was still the son of the Duke. Therefore, although his treatment within the palace couldn\u2019t be described as good, it still wasn\u2019t too bad. His mother no longer remained a maid, and relied on her child\u2019s nobility to obtain a courtyard for herself.As such, everything should\u2019ve continued without any trouble, but who could\u2019ve known that disaster would arrive so soon?The Duke went to war as a representative of the Star Luo Empire, leaving all of the Mansion\u2019s internal affairs to the Duke\u2019s wife. The Duke\u2019s wife already had two sons and a daughter, and she treated anything that could affect her children as things that needed to be suppressed. Things were quite good for Huo Yuhao and his mother while the Duke was in the Mansion, but when he left, the Mansion became the world of the Duke\u2019s wife. Furthermore, she was the favourite daughter of the Star Luo Empire\u2019s current emperor.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother had grown up beside the Duke, resulting in her being heavily doted upon by him. Thus, she was always envied by the Duke\u2019s wife. Once the Duke left, she immediately became the main target for the Duke\u2019s wife. Using the excuse that Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother had contracted an infectious disease, she chased them to the servant\u2019s wooden sheds, which were located at the back of the mansion. Furthermore, she cut away all their current sources of income. Huo Yuhao was only two when this happened.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother didn\u2019t have a healthy body from the start, thus the arduous lifestyle that they had to live in caused her body to gradually collapse. What\u2019s more, the servants under the control of the Duke\u2019s wife would frequently suppress her, causing her to suddenly die from her illness when Huo Yuhao was ten.Four thousand years ago, the Douluo Continent collided with the Sun Moon Continent, which had drifted over due to the Western Ocean. This resulted in the Douluo Continent\u2019s landmass being greatly expanded, but also caused the frequency of wars on the Douluo Continent to increase.The Douluo Continent had originally been divided into two countries ten thousand years ago\u2014the Heaven Dou Country, and the Star Luo Country. However, the Douluo Continent had now been split into three countries. Of the two, the Star Luo Empire still existed, but the royal family had changed. They had fortunately pacified all of their kingdoms at that time, allowing the entire Star Luo Empire to remain united, and thus resulting in them becoming the strongest force of the three.However, the Heaven Dou Empire was split due to the discord amongst its strong kingdoms. In the end, it was split up into the Heavenly Soul Empire and the Spirit Dou Empire.The Sun Moon Continent that had drifted over from the west had both a vast surface area and plentiful resources. It was slightly smaller than the Douluo Continent, but it only had a single country, which was the Sun Moon Empire.War broke out between the two continents almost as soon as they collided. The three countries of the Douluo Continent all dispatched allied armies to fight against their common enemy. After nearly twenty years of war, they finally managed to defeat the Sun Moon Empire. From that point on, they unified the two continents under the Douluo name. The Sun Moon Continent no longer existed, only the Sun Moon Empire within the Douluo Continent was left.However, the Sun Moon Empire wasn\u2019t fully invaded even though it was defeated. They relied on their natural advantages, as well as the conflicting views of the three empires of the Douluo Continent, to gradually form a stable, deadlocked situation between the four parties. However, wars still occurred every year.Due to the frequent amount of wars that the Duke had to participate in, he spent very little time within the mansion. Due to the Duke\u2019s wife deliberately concealing the matter, Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother was gradually forgotten by the Duke. When the Duke asked about her, his wife merely said that Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother had fallen ill.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother had suffered many bitter hardships as she brought him up. When he was six, he carried out the awakening of his martial soul within the Mansion.Martial souls were an something that everybody on the Douluo Continent possessed. Although the Sun Moon Empire had developed in a different way compared to the other three empires, martial souls were still one of their fundamental concepts.Everyone would naturally have a martial soul that could be awakened at the age of six. A martial soul could be anything, from a tool to an animal. Beast-type martial souls were referred to as \u2018Beast Souls\u2019, while all other martial souls that weren\u2019t Beast Souls were collectively known as \u2018Tool Souls\u2019. However, there were naturally some martial souls that possessed mutations. Thus, they were exceptions to this rule.After the awakening of one\u2019s martial soul, a small amount of people would have a special power along with their martial soul. This power was called \u2018soul force\u2019. Only people who possessed soul force had the ability to cultivate, and to become the noblest profession on the Douluo Continent\u2014a soul master.Soul masters were separated into nine different ranks. From lowest to highest, they were: Soul Scholar, Soul Master, Soul Grandmaster, Soul Elder, Soul Ancestor, Soul King, Soul Emperor, Soul Sage, Soul Douluo, and Titled Douluo.Soul masters would increase in power as their soul rank increased. If one managed to reach the highest level of the Titled Douluo rank, one would have the terrifying ability to both move the mountains and seas, as well as even shift the stars.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 1.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 1.2: The Youth with the Spirit EyesPeople who were between the first and tenth rank of soulforce fell underneath the category of Soul Scholar. When someone\u2019s martial soul was awakened, their innate soulforce would signify their talent towards becoming a soul master. As such, a person with greater talent would have a greater cultivation speed. If one had tenth-ranked soulforce after their martial soul had awakened, they would be a gifted person with \u2018innate full soulforce\u2019. That person would thus be referred to as a genius soul master. A genius soul master would have great accomplishments in his life as long as his martial soul wasn\u2019t too bad.Although Huo Yuhao was the son of the Duke, he hadn\u2019t inherited a powerful martial soul from the Duke. If he had, the Duke\u2019s wife would\u2019ve had to report his martial soul to the Duke, regardless of whether or not she liked him. From then on, Huo Yuhao and his mother\u2019s destiny would\u2019ve also changed.Unfortunately, an extremely rare mutation appeared in Huo Yuhao\u2019s martial soul.He possessed the \u2018Spirit Eyes\u2019.Outside of the two main categories of martial souls, there was an extremely tiny subcategory that were known as \u2018Body Souls\u2019. The martial soul that they awakened would be a part of their body, such as an arm, or a leg.Almost all Body Souls were extremely strong, but the probability of them appearing was extremely small. It could be said that they were existences above both Beast Souls and Tool Souls, and because of this, they were greatly valued whenever they appeared.Unfortunately, Huo Yuhao\u2019s martial soul was an exception to this.His Spirit Eyes martial soul had naturally appeared in his eyes. Furthermore, it was also an extremely rare spiritual-type martial soul. Under normal circumstances, Huo Yuhao should\u2019ve become greatly valued. Unfortunately, there were two points that had restricted his development. When he\u2019d awakened his martial soul, his innate soulforce had only been at the first rank. Thus, it could be said that his talent was quite poor, which meant that his cultivation speed would definitely be extremely slow. The second point that had restricted his development was even more fatal; not only were spiritual-type martial souls rarely seen, spiritual-type soul beasts were also extremely rare.Whenever a soul master\u2019s cultivation reached the tenth soul rank\u2019s bottleneck, they would need to kill a soul beast that was compatible with their martial soul, and then would need to use its soul ring to break through it.Not only were soul rings required to breakthrough a bottleneck, but they would also give soul masters a skill. This was also one of the origins of a soul masters strength.Combined, these two factors practically doomed Huo Yuhao to have no achievements during his lifetime.However, he was still the Duke\u2019s son in the end. Thus, he still managed to obtain a simple soulforce cultivation method.Even the children of some servants within the Duke\u2019s Mansion were capable of reaching the tenth soul rank, and could become soul masters within three years of awakening their martial soul.However, Huo Yuhao had reached the age of eleven this year. He\u2019d already cultivated for five years, yet his soulforce had only barely reached the tenth soul rank. Furthermore, he\u2019d worked three times harder than his peers!After his mother passed away, Huo Yuhao stayed in the Duke\u2019s Mansion for another year. He was still young, so he didn\u2019t have any source of income whatsoever after rashly leaving the Duke\u2019s Mansion. Thus, he could only suppress all of his grievances and hate with his heart. And, due to the oppression that he\u2019d had to suffer through, his mind had matured much more than his peers.His mother had told him that the only way for him to be outstanding was to become a soul master. Even if he only became an ordinary soul master, his status would still be much higher than that of other ordinary people on the Douluo continent.Yesterday, Huo Yuhao had finally managed to raise his soulforce to the tenth rank; this was with his extremely poor talent, and after five years of bitterly hard work. This was also the day that he\u2019d planned to leave the Duke\u2019s Mansion.He needed a soul ring. Even a low-tier ten year soul ring would be fine! That way, he\u2019d have the chance to become a true soul master that possessed his own personal skill.On the Douluo Continent, soul beasts were ranked according to the number of years that they\u2019d lived for. The strength of their soul rings was closely related to this, as well as their overall power.Generally speaking, soul beasts were separated into ten year soul beasts, hundred year soul beasts, thousand year soul beasts, ten thousand year soul beasts, and hundred thousand year soul beasts.Soul masters would have to personally kill a soul beast in order to obtain a soul ring from it when it died.Huo Yuhao knew that, if he continued to stay in the Duke\u2019s Mansion, he simply wouldn\u2019t have a chance to obtain a soul ring. Practically no one there was willing to help him. Due to this, he rashly decided to leave the Duke\u2019s Mansion, even though he knew that it was an extremely dangerous thing for him to look for a spiritual-type soul beast by himself. After all, a newborn calf wouldn\u2019t be afraid of a tiger.Huo Yuhao quickly arrived at the main road as he walked towards the north. Although he was young, he\u2019d already made preparations for the sake of obtaining a soul ring. Besides a set of clean clothes, he\u2019d also brought some dry rations in his bag, as well as some money that his mother had obtained via hard work. He also had a dagger in his bag. But most importantly, he had a simple map of the continent.Both the Duke\u2019s Mansion and Star Luo City were located in the north-central region of the Star Luo Empire, and the area that Huo Yuhao chose to hunt for a soul beast in was the Great Star Dou Forest that bordered the northern area of the Star Luo Empire and the Tian Hun Empire. Various types of soul beasts lived within the forest, which was almost as big as a province. Furthermore, there were no lack of supreme existences inside of the forest.If anyone else knew that the eleven year old Huo Yuhao had dared to enter the Star Dou Forest by himself, without a teacher accompanying him, they would definitely be stunned speechless. He was overestimating his own capabilities! Since he didn\u2019t have any skills at all, he might not even be able to win a fight against a ten year soul beast!The main road was perfectly straight, thus Huo Yuhao quickly walked along it, following the roadside. Although he was young, he was still a tenth ranked Soul Scholar. His physical strength was much greater than a normal adult\u2019s.Huo Yuhao gazed far into the distance as he walked forward. If one were to carefully look at him, they would see that his deep blue eyes had instantly become much clearer, and that there faintly seemed to be light flashing inside of them.Ever since he\u2019d awakened his Spirit Eyes, Huo Yuhao had discovered that his vision exceeded that of an ordinary person\u2019s. At a relatively close distance, he could see many minute details that ordinary people were unable to clearly see; at a longer distance, the range of his vision was over twice the distance of an ordinary person\u2019s.The strength of his vision had also unceasingly increased in combination with his soulforce level. The changes that had appeared as his cultivation increased made his trust in his mother\u2019s words increase. A soul master, I must become a soul master.\u201cMother once said that I would become a control system battle soul master if I was able to obtain a soul ring. It\u2019s not that my martial soul is bad, but that my talent is poor. Thus, I\u2019ll just work harder and cultivate longer than other people do.\u201dHuo Yuhao cultivated as he advanced forward, supported by this resolute conviction. When he was thirsty, he\u2019d look for some spring water; when he was hungry, he\u2019d eat some of the rough biscuits that he\u2019d brought along with him. Other than hurrying forward on his journey, he would sit down and meditate. The fact that he could actually advance three hundred miles in a single day\u2014at his age\u2014was nothing short of a miracle.However, he only had seven silver soul coins and five copper soul coins him, which caused him to be extremely frugal with his money.Ever since the war between the Douluo Continent and the Sun Moon Continent had ended, the continent had undergone thousands of years of changes. The currency used was now completely unified: one gold soul coin was equal to ten silver soul coins, which was equal to one hundred copper soul coins.When he was young, his mother had sometimes quietly taken him outside of the Duke\u2019s Mansion to look for some fruits and wild herbs in the forest to eat, simply for the sake of giving him a better meal than normal. Thus, the amount of plants that Little Yuhao recognised was fairly high. Many times, he couldn\u2019t even bear to buy some cheap biscuits, so he had to resort to looking for some food in the woods beside the road as he travelled along.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Due to this, he couldn\u2019t avoid losing his way a few times, and he had to continuously ask for the help of other people to find the correct route to his destination.This was the so-called \u2018reading ten thousand books is not as good as travelling ten thousand miles\u2019. He felt like he\u2019d learned a lot of things after only a few days. His mood had also improved a lot without the oppression and restrictions that were usually imposed within the Duke\u2019s Mansion. The interesting things that he\u2019d seen so far during his journey caused him to be endlessly excited. He was still young after all. After his body had recovered, he didn\u2019t feel tired while travelling. On the contrary, it could be said that he was a bird who\u2019d left its cage. This was the first time that he\u2019d had fun after his mother\u2019s passing.\u201cI\u2019ve been walking for six days, I should get there soon.\u201d Huo Yuhao carefully inspected the paper map in his hands, and then looked in the direction where the trees by the roadside pointed to. He determined that he was already very close to the Great Star Dou Forest.Huo Yuhao wiped the sweat off of his forehead as he walked into the woods by the roadside. As soon as he sat down in the shade of a tree, intending to meditate and recover his spirit power, the sound of flowing water suddenly began to reverberate through the air. This sound immediately caused Huo Yuhao to jump up in excitement.The presence of water signified that he could improve his lifestyle!Huo Yuhao quickly shut his eyes, and quietly listened for the source of the water. As someone who possessed a spiritual-type martial spirit, his six senses were much stronger than an ordinary person\u2019s. This was especially true when he shut his eyes. When he shut his eyes, his other five senses would increase in strength by a margin.He quickly identified where the sound of water was coming from, and carefully advanced through the forest. The reason why he was being so careful wasn\u2019t because the forest\u2019s ground was uneven, but because he was scared that his clothes would be torn by the brambles in the forest. These were clothes that his mother had personally made for him.He found his target without walking more than two hundred metres, which turned out to be a small brook approximately three metres wide. The cold water within was so clear that you could see straight to the bottom, and it created both a relaxing and a refreshing feeling.Huo Yuhao let out a happy cheer, rapidly took his clothes off, and then instantly jumped into the stream, which wasn\u2019t even two feet deep. The last time he\u2019d had a bath was two days ago. The past two days of travelling had covered his body in sweat, and taking a bath in this cold and clear water was simply a pleasure that couldn\u2019t be any more relaxing.After thoroughly bathing, a brilliant feeling was suffused throughout his whole body when he walked out of the stream. He inwardly thought, Since I\u2019ve already arrived at the Great Star Dou Forest, I\u2019ll simply have a good rest here.He changed into a clean set of clothes, proceeded to washed his dirty clothes in the stream as well, and then hung them on a nearby tree branch. He then snapped off a tree branch that was approximately three feet long.He used his right hand to pull a dagger from its sheath at his waist. The dagger was roughly forty centimetres long, and its scabbard was dark green in colour. The scabbard was made of tough leather, though he didn\u2019t know whether it was leather from an animal, or from a spirit beast. He only knew that it was a present that his father had given to his mother. It had always been treasured by his mother, so much so that his mother had only given it to him the moment before she passed away.The handle of the dagger was about seventeen centimetres long, and didn\u2019t have any gorgeous decorations on it at all\u2014it gave people a simple and unadorned feeling. Not only did it feel natural to hold, it also felt exceptionally comfortable.It also didn\u2019t make any noise when it was unsheathed. The twenty-three centimetre long blade was just like limpid autumn water, and seemed to be transparent. Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but shiver because of the dense, cold air around the knife, even though he seemed to be somewhat used to it.The \u2018White Tiger Dagger\u2019. This was the dagger\u2019s name, which his mother had told him.As Huo Yuhao looked at the White Tiger Dagger, the excitement in his eyes instantly turned into a deep look of sadness. He seemed to see his mother\u2019s figure in the blade\u2019s reflection.Holding the branch that he\u2019d just snapped off in one hand, Huo Yuhao used the White Tiger Dagger to shave the front of it. When the blade, which was releasing a faint blue light, cut into the tree branch, it felt like cutting through tofu. After two or three cuts, the front of the tree branch had been sharpened.He sheathed the White Tiger Dagger at his waist, and walked back towards the stream with the sharpened branch in hand.After taking a deep breath, his eyes immediately lit up. All of the minute details in the clear water were magnified within his eyes. He was now able to see the minute changes in the water\u2019s ripples\u2014even the small shrimps that lay in-between the cracks in the ground at the bottom of the river couldn\u2019t escape the notice of his Spirit Eyes. Furthermore, everything seemed to slow down as he looked at it.Suddenly, Huo Yuhao made a lightning fast move, and stabbed the sharpened branch he was holding into the stream.\u201cPu\u2014\u201d When he raised his hand back up, and turned the tree branch upwards, a half-feet long mackerel had appeared on the tip of it.To ordinary people, stabbing a fish was definitely something that required technique. However, this was something extremely easy for Huo Yuhao, who had the aid of the Spirit Eyes to help him accurately determine the position of the fish.A single small fish was naturally not enough for him. After a few moments of casual labour, he\u2019d stabbed ten mackerels that varied from seventeen centimetres in length, to thirty-three centimetres in length.\u201cThis is good, it can last me for two days at the least. It won\u2019t rot very easily if I roast it too.\u201dHuo Yuhao happily squatted down next to the stream, and used the White Tiger Dagger to gut the mackerels. The sharp White Tiger Dagger easily managed to cut through the fish, no matter if it was its scales, chest, or belly. This was no problem at all to Huo Yuhao, who\u2019d been doing manual labor with his mother since he was young. The ten fish were all gutted after fifteen minutes.He looked for some big leaves in the forest, and rinsed them off in the river. Then, he placed the gutted fishes on the wet leaves. After that, he found some dry twigs to use as firewood, and started a fire next to the stream after a moment of work.Huo Yuhao only had salt available as a seasoning, but that was enough for something like roasted fish. He stuck the clean mackerels onto a thin branch, and rubbed some salt into their bellies. Then he took some leaves known as Purple Basil out of his bag, which he\u2019d gotten in the forest a few days ago. He washed and separated the Purple Basil before pushing it into the bellies of the fish. Only after this did he start to roast the fish on the grill that he\u2019d created using some thick branches.It didn\u2019t take long for an unusual smell to spread from the fire that he\u2019d created. The smell was very heavy, and it contained a certain attraction that belonged solely to it. As Huo Yuhao slowly rotated the mackerels, they gradually turned golden. This, accompanied with that heavy aroma, was exceptionally enticing.At first, he only roasted two of the fish, and set aside the others. If he had roasted too many of the fish in one go, it would\u2019ve been quite easy for problems to occur while he was controlling the fire.\u201cHow fragrant!\u201dA happy and delicate cry echoed out at that moment. The cry sounded both clear and pure, but it still startled Huo Yuhao.He looked towards the source of the sound, and saw two people walking along the side of the stream. The person walking in front was a girl who looked to be around fifteen or sixteen, and had long black hair that was tied into a ponytail behind her. She wore a set of light blue, form-fitting warrior\u2019s robes, which seemed to outline her budding and delicate body that was filled with youth.She had phoenix-like eyes, which were both big and bright. She also had a raised nose, an almost perfect oval face, and a pretty and delicate face that was slightly happy as she fixed her gaze on Huo Yuhao\u2019s roasted fish.The person following behind her was a youth that seemed to be of the same age as her. His slender body was tall and straight, whilst his short, deep blue hair shone with a jade-like luster under the sunlight. Although he wasn\u2019t old, he gave people a sort of scholarly feeling. His handsome face had a lazy yet warm smile on it, and his hands were rested on the back of his head. He also gazed in Huo Yuhao\u2019s direction with an interested look. However, he wasn\u2019t looking at the roasted fish, but at Huo Yuhao himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A greedy, hungry look appeared on her face as she said, \u201cLittle brother, are you selling this roasted fish? It smells so good! How did you make it?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Huo Yuhao hadn\u2019t ever seen beautiful girls before. While he was in the Duke\u2019s Mansion, many of the servant girls had been very pretty, however none of them had ever come as close as the girl in front of him before. Furthermore, none of the girls in the Duke\u2019s Mansion were comparable to the girl in front of him either. She wasn\u2019t an absolute beauty that was perfectly flawless, but she had a sort of outstanding temperament.Huo Yuhao\u2019s face turned somewhat red as he replied, \u201cI-I\u2019ll treat you both to a meal.\u201dThe girl giggled in response. \u201cLittle brother, you\u2019ve even become embarrassed. Then, I won\u2019t be polite.\u201d As she talked, she stretched her hand out to take the roasted fish that Huo Yuhao had passed over. She didn\u2019t seem to care about what she looked like as she carefully ate the roasted fish, then let out a loud cry of \u201cHot!\u201d.At that moment, the youth that had been following the girl walked over. He had a helpless look on his face as he raised his hand and greeted Huo Yuhao. Then he said to the girl, \u201cXiao Ya, this little brother hasn\u2019t even eaten yet, yet you\u2019ve already started eating.\u201dXiao Ya\u2019s beautiful eyes widened as she angrily retorted, \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201dThe youth immediately raised his hands in surrender, \u201cFine, Teacher Xiao Ya, that should be fine, right?\u201dXiao Ya stared at him coldly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the way that it should be. You should pay attention to your status.\u201d Although she wasn\u2019t that old, her gaze was filled with a charming look. The onlooking youth couldn\u2019t help but have his expression turned blank. Huo Yuhao, who was to the side, didn\u2019t dare to continue looking. He passed the other fish that he\u2019d roasted to the youth and said, \u201cBig brother, this is for you.\u201dThe youth smiled and said, \u201cGentlemen shouldn\u2019t take good things that belong to others. Little brother, you still haven\u2019t eaten. Did you catch these fish in the river?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, I can still roast more.\u201d While he spoke, he handed the roasted fish to the youth. Then, he skillfully took two of the fish that he\u2019d set aside, so that he could roast them on the wooden rack.The youth gently smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Bei Bei and she\u2019s Tang Ya. Little brother, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Huo Yuhao.\u201d He replied whilst carefully roasting the fish. During his journey, he\u2019d met many travellers while sleeping outdoors, and had also received a lot of help from them. Thus, he hadn\u2019t hesitated to give Tang Ya one of the fish he\u2019d roasted when she asked. The past few days had taught him the fact that people had to mutually help each other while they were outdoors.Bei Bei sat next to Tang Ya. The way he ate the roasted fish was much more graceful than Tang Ya\u2019s. At the very least, his hands weren\u2019t fully stained with oil.By the time Huo Yuhao had finished roasting the second batch of fish, Tang Ya was already impatiently waiting. Under Bei Bei\u2019s helpless gaze, she snatched another roasted fish.However, Bei Bei was unwilling to eat another fish, thus he motioned for Huo Yuhao to eat first. Huo Yuhao was already hungry, so he ate the other fish while continuing to roast more.Although the seasonings used on the roasted fish were only salt and purple basil, the roasted fish\u2019s taste was extremely delicious. And although the ten fish weren\u2019t that big, their size together was still quite large. All of the fish were eaten by the three.\u201cThis is simply too tasty. I\u2019ve never eaten such a delicious roasted fish before. Little brother Huo Yuhao, how about I hire you as a chef, okay?\u201d Tang Ya laid down on the grass, and stretched in satisfaction. Her curves were completely exposed, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. Bei Bei scratched his head whilst looking at her, but didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201cDo you have any money? Teacher Xiao Ya?\u201d Bei Bei asked, splashing cold water on her idea.\u201cEh\u2026 I\u2019ll have money in the future.\u201d Tang Ya was slightly embarrassed as she sat up. She glared at Bei Bei, seemingly unhappy at him for ruining her plans.Huo Yuhao stood up and said, \u201cBrother Bei, Sister Tang, I\u2019ll have to leave first.\u201dBei Bei said, \u201cLittle brother Huo, this is the desolate countryside, and isn\u2019t that far away from the Great Star Dou Forest where soul beasts wander. Just where do you intend to go?\u201dHuo Yuhao shook his head, then grabbed his clothes that had already dried from the tree branch. He smiled and waved goodbye to the two after he\u2019d packed his clothes into his bag. Afterwards, he turned around and left under Tang Ya\u2019s slightly astonished gaze.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t really want to go into the Great Star Dou Forest, could he?\u201d Tang Ya gazed at Huo Yuhao\u2019s shrinking back as she pondered.Bei Bei shook his head and said, \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. I can vaguely sense that he possesses soulforce, but it\u2019s very weak. It also seems that he\u2019s alone. This is truly somewhat strange.\u201dTang Ya stuck her tongue out and said, \u201cSince he has soulforce, why don\u2019t we recruit him into our Tang Sect?\u201dBei Bei unhappily replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t be wanting to recruit someone into the sect, simply because they cooked you some delicious fish?\u201dTang Ya\u2019s face reddened when her intentions were found out, and she stuck her tongue out at Bei Bei.Bei Bei said, \u201cThis Little brother Huo has definitely experienced something in his life. I can see that his maturity exceeds his peers from his gaze alone. However, I don\u2019t know what his talent is like.\u201dA happy expression suffused on Tang Ya\u2019s face as she replied, \u201cSince you\u2019re putting it like this, does that mean that you\u2019ve agreed?\u201dBei Bei bitterly smiled, \u201cSect leader of the great Tang Sect, Miss Tang. Before you took me in as a disciple, the Tang Sect only had you, and you alone, as its leader. Therefore, since your ambition is to strengthen the Tang Sect, it\u2019s only natural that we recruit suitable people. This Little brother Huo looks like a rather steady and calm person. If his talent is passable, he\u2019s a suitable choice. And from the clothes that he\u2019s wearing, his family circumstances shouldn\u2019t be too good. Thus, our Tang Sect can recruit this kind of disciple now.\u201dTang Ya looked at Bei Bei with a slightly curious gaze as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re actually quite crafty. I couldn\u2019t tell that at all.\u201dBei Bei stood up and brushed the dust off of his clothes as he replied, \u201cThis is simply called being astute, but calling me wise is fine too. Let\u2019s go. Since we\u2019ve eaten so many of his roasted fish, we should at least protect him for a segment of his journey, just in case he gets in danger when he encounters some soul beasts, no matter whether we recruit him into the Tang Sect or not.Tang Ya also stood up and giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re indeed quite smart this time, because your thoughts are actually identical to mine. Let\u2019s go after I clean up a bit.\u201dHuo Yuhao was naturally unaware of the conversion between Bei Bei and Tang Ya. He\u2019d originally planned to bring some roasted fish with him, but that plan couldn\u2019t be realised, as he hadn\u2019t wanted to expose his identity as a Soul Scholar, which was why he hadn\u2019t caught any more fish. His mother had taught him to talk with reservation when dealing with strangers. Although he had a good impression of Bei Bei and Tang Ya, he still decided to separate from them after he finished eating.Even though Huo Yuhao was young, he still thought a lot about things. He could tell that Tang Ya and Bei Bei weren\u2019t ordinary people. Bei Bei had said that this was the desolate countryside, yet they both didn\u2019t even have any bags on them. Thus, he believed that it would be better for him to separate from the two.After eating the meal, he\u2019d already recovered from his prior exhaustion. He marked the position of the small stream on his map. Who knew, he might have a use for it when he returned.After walking forward for a short time, a wooden signboard on the roadside caught his attention.\u201cYou will enter the territory of the Great Star Dou Forest in 50 metres. There are soul beasts roaming around, so please be careful.\u201dSure enough, he hadn\u2019t gotten lost. He was finally about to reach his destination. In addition to his current feeling of excitement, Huo Yuhao also felt a trace of nervousness. He touched the White Tiger Dagger on his lower back and suppressed the uneasiness in his heart. Then, he took determined strides as he advanced forward.Becoming a soul master was the only way out for him. This was the conviction that he held in his heart, and he\u2019d never regretted his decision.The air gradually turned cool and refreshing, and an extraordinarily serious feeling seemed to exist within it. The Great Star Dou Forest was like a soul beast that had its mouth wide open for young creatures. He would either have an opportunity\u2026or be swallowed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After only a brief moment of astonishment and nervousness, his mood changed into that of excitement. He\u2019d finally arrived at his destination after so many days of travel. When he thought about obtaining a soul ring for himself, so that he could truly become a soul master, he felt his blood boil. Although he was only eleven, he\u2019d already bitterly cultivated for over five years, just for the sake of today.In his excited state, he unconsciously increased the speed of his steps. The speed of his advance towards the Great Star Dou Forest was also slightly fastened.A slightly strange feeling suddenly appeared in his mind as he advanced forward. Huo Yuhao then felt a slight stabbing pain in his eyes, causing him to unconsciously move soulforce to his Spirit Eyes.A weak stream of air spiralled around Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes, and he seemed to see a shadow flash across the left side of the road in front of him.As an extremely rare spiritual-type mutated martial soul, his Spirit Eyes had a very strong ability to sense danger. The feeling of immediate crisis Huo Yuhao felt caused his senses to immediately sharpen. He rapidly lowered his body to the left, and used his right hand to quickly unsheathe the White Tiger Dagger from his waist.A black figure flashed past the area he\u2019d previously been at. The area where it had pounced was almost within Huo Yuhao\u2019s reach, which immediately allowed him to clearly see what it was.It was a baboon that was roughly one metre tall. Its body was covered in light brown fur, and its eyes were brown in colour. It had two arms that were oddly long, and sharp fingernails on its claws. Its canine teeth were exposed from its lips, and a savage light was present in its eyes. It immediately let out a low roar towards Huo Yuhao since it had failed to hit him. It then powerfully stamped its hind legs, once again pouncing towards Huo Yuhao.Although his Spirit Eyes didn\u2019t have an accommodating soul ring, its fundamental ability was still fairly good. After he\u2019d poured his soulforce into his eyes, the pouncing baboon\u2019s movements became much slower in his eyes. Huo Yuhao, who had previously dropped to the ground, rapidly rolled to the right. He then sprung up and tumbled a few steps backwards, whilst simultaneously raising the White Tiger Dagger before him.The clear sounds of his nervous heartbeat echoed out, and his breathing had clearly become rushed. This was the first time in his life that he\u2019d encountered a soul beast\u2019s attacks. The palm he was using to hold the White Tiger Dagger had already been covered in sweat, and his expression had also turned somewhat blank, because he didn\u2019t know how to react.After the baboon missed two attacks in a row, it seemed to become enraged. Its upper body rose up, and it used its fists to vigorously beat on its chest, letting out a roar. At the same time, it suddenly opened its mouth towards Huo Yuhao. It immediately spat out a ball of white light, which went directly towards Huo Yuhao.Even though Huo Yuhao had no experience, he was still able to see that his opponent was a soul beast now. There was still a certain distance between where he was and the Great Star Dou Forest, which was the reason why he hadn\u2019t been prepared at all. With his current level of cultivation, it was very possible that he would suffer a calamitous fate if he were to be struck by that white ball of light.At that moment, Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind had already become blank. The ball of white light didn\u2019t seem very fast when he looked at it through his Spirit Eyes, but in reality, it would arrive in the blink of an eye.Whilst spitting out the white light, the baboon had also pounced towards Huo Yuhao at an extremely quick speed, a savage light in its eyes.Huo Yuhao had already lost the ability to think due to his nervousness. When the white light reached him, he subconsciously followed his instincts and brought the White Tiger Dagger in his right hand up, striking the white light head-on.A strange scene appeared at this moment. By the time the white light had collided with the White Tiger Dagger, the baboon had already arrived, and had extended its long arms in front of it, slashing towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulders with its sharp claws.Since the battle had reached this point, Huo Yuhao\u2019s fate seemed to already be sealed. Was he really going to perish under this soul beast\u2019s claws?The baboon clawed Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulders, and made use of its sturdy body and the momentum from its charge to flip around midair, in an attempt to fiercely throw Huo Yuhao downwards.In the same moment that it reached Huo Yuhao and attempted to throw him down, a white light flashed past its body. Its body seemed to stiffen for a moment, and Huo Yuhao was flung outwards instead of being smashed into the ground. On the other hand, the baboon rolled on the ground for a little while, before ceasing any further movements.\u201cPeng\u2014\u201d Huo Yuhao\u2019s body collided with a nearby tree trunk, then slid down. Everything in front of his eyes turned dark, and the violent spike of pain instantly caused him to lose his ability to breathe.At this moment, Huo Yuhao\u2019s appearance truly looked quite miserable. There were long wounds on his shoulders, and his jacket had nearly been torn apart.However, he still managed to awaken from his empty-minded state amidst the violent pain. His gaze subconsciously shifted towards the baboon that lay unmoving on the ground.A faint white light had appeared over the baboon. It slowly and gradually began to condense into a white halo above its body. The halo wasn\u2019t clear, and the light was also only faintly discernible. However, this still made Huo Yuhao gape at it.Soul ring? This is a soul ring? Huo Yuhao was so excited that his body trembled slightly, and the wounds on his body didn\u2019t seem to hurt that much anymore.He\u2019d only learnt the most basic meditation technique within the Duke\u2019s Mansion, yet he\u2019d heard far, far too much about soul beasts and soul rings. Almost every single guard within the Duke\u2019s Mansion would bring up the topic frequently, but this was the first time that he\u2019d personally seen one.Could it be that it\u2019s already dead? Huo Yuhao thought blankly to himself. A soul ring would only appear when a soul beast had died! But, how had it died?His Spirit Eyes\u2019 ability appeared at this moment, causing his memories to surge through his mind like a tide.The white light that the baboon had released had struck the White Tiger Dagger, however as soon as that happened, the White Tiger Dagger had suddenly emitted a light, unexpectedly absorbing all of the white light. This was also the factor that altered the most crucial moment of the battle.According to the baboon\u2019s instincts, a weak human like Huo Yuhao would definitely lose all of his combat power after being struck by its soul skill. Then, he would lose at least half his life from being fiercely smashed to the ground. However, it never thought that its soul skill would be subconsciously neutralised by Huo Yuhao\u2019s White Tiger Dagger. When it flipped its body in order to throw Huo Yuhao, Huo Yuhao had instinctively swung his hands upwards, causing the White Tiger Dagger in his right hand to naturally slash upwards as well.Originally, the White Tiger Dagger\u2019s length hadn\u2019t been long enough to reach the baboon that had already soared into the sky. However, the White Tiger Dagger suddenly released a foot-long blade of light in that instant, which swept across the baboon\u2019s body. It seemed to have turned the white light it had previously absorbed into a sharp blade. Although Huo Yuhao was unable to clearly remember where the dagger had struck due to his blank mind, something had definitely happened. That blade of light must have definitely slashed the body of the baboon.I actually won? Huo Yuhao gazed at the white soul ring, but the excitement in his heart gradually faded. Soul rings were necessary items for soul masters to advance in rank. However, not all soul rings were suitable for soul masters to absorb. Only a soul ring that had a high compatibility with the soul master\u2019s martial soul could be absorbed, for the best results.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 2.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2.2: Skydream IcewormThe strength of a soul ring was based off of how many years the soul beast had cultivated for; the better a soul ring was, the stronger the skill it would grant to a soul master.White soul rings were those formed by a ten year soul beast. All soul beasts that had cultivated between ten and a hundred years would produce a white coloured soul ring when they were killed. The baboon that Huo Yuhao had luckily managed to kill was undoubtedly a ten year soul beast, and a ten year soul ring had also clearly appeared in front of Huo Yuhao. Unfortunately, the soul ring wasn\u2019t one he could absorb.Although Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t have any experience at killing soul beasts, and couldn\u2019t see what type of existence the baboon was, he was certain that the baboon wasn\u2019t a spiritual-type soul beast. Therefore, its soul ring was thus even more unsuited for him.He wanted to check the baboon\u2019s condition, but a wave of both pain and soreness flooded his body when he was about to stand up. His excessive nervousness from earlier caused him to be unable to use any strength at all now. Combined with the pain from his shoulders, the exertion of force caused him to let out a muffled groan, and almost caused him to faint.He was only eleven after all! The determination in his heart had even wavered slightly, after the battle that he\u2019d just experienced. The amount of spiritual-type soul beasts that existed was extremely little, yet he\u2019d almost been killed by the first soul beast he\u2019d encountered. Furthermore, this had only been a ten year soul beast. What if he\u2019d encountered a hundred year soul beast? He would\u2019ve had absolutely no chance of even narrowly escaping, simply because it was impossible for luck to be with him at all times. The miraculous power that had momentarily been released from the White Tiger Dagger obviously couldn\u2019t make up for his weak strength.What should I do? Huo Yuhao struggled to barely sit up. He leaned against the tree that he\u2019d previously flown into, and gasped for breath.I can\u2019t die, I\u2019ll definitely succeed. I still have to seek justice for my mother, I can\u2019t give up like this! Huo Yuhao tightly clenched his teeth, and unceasingly hardened his conviction. However, the scenes from his previous battle with the baboon continuously let him know that he had been overestimating his capabilities.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind was filled with an empty feeling, and he didn\u2019t know what to do. Suddenly, a voice echoed out inside of his mind, without any prior warning.\u201cFinally, I\u2019ve met a spiritual-type human! What a pity that this brother can\u2019t cry! If I could, my face would definitely be covered with tears!\u201dHuo Yuhao was startled. He didn\u2019t understand why a voice had suddenly appeared inside of his mind. However, at this moment, the ground beneath him suddenly trembled without any prior warning. Cracks began to appear on the ground two metres in front of him, and then gradually expanded until they turned into a crevice; a dim golden-white light faintly shone from within the crevice.This, what is this? Another soul beast?Huo Yuhao subconsciously gripped the White Tiger Dagger tightly, and nervously gazed at the crevice that was gradually expanding. If it wasn\u2019t for his aching body, he might\u2019ve already run away.An icy chill was released from the crevice, which caused the surrounding temperature to drop. The area of the crevice gradually increased, and after a moment, its diameter had reached five metres wide, causing the true appearance of the golden-white light to finally be revealed.It was a plump and fat-looking head with a diameter of over one metre. After it slowly wiggled its body and managed to climb up, its entire body was revealed. Its body was over seven metres long.Following its appearance, the surrounding temperature became so cold that Huo Yuhao was able to see his own breath, and it caused him to be unable to help but shiver a few times.This was definitely a soul beast, yet it unexpectedly resembled a silkworm. However, it was god-knows how many times larger than a normal silkworm.Its body was the same colour as white jade, sparkled, and was translucent. Although it had dug itself out from the earth, there wasn\u2019t any dirt on its brilliant skin at all. Halos of light moved about underneath its epidermis, and it unexpectedly had a small pair of eyes on its head that flickered with a golden light. Strangest of all, golden patterns were engraved on its body at certain intervals, starting half a metre from its head. From head to tail, it had a total of ten golden patterns.A look of despair appeared on Huo Yuhao\u2019s already nervous face as he gazed at its enormous body. It has such an enormous body, and it has the power to change the temperature\u2026 it\u2019s at least a hundred year soul beast. It\u2019s over, everything\u2019s over.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, don\u2019t be scared. This brother won\u2019t harm you!\u201d The voice from before echoed out in Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind once again, and the enormous silkworm nodded its head. Its huge head then drooped downwards, before stopping a metre away from Huo Yuhao. It even emitted a faintly fragrant odor from its body.Huo Yuhao said in a startled tone, \u201cAre you the one that\u2019s talking to me?\u201dThe enormous silkworm nodded its head in response, and its voice continued to echo out inside of his mind, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously this brother that\u2019s speaking. Did you get captivated by my beautiful body?\u201dAfter realizing that the enormous silkworm didn\u2019t have any evil intentions, Huo Yuhao\u2019s taut heartstrings relaxed a bit.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dThe silkworm replied, \u201cFirst off, let me introduce myself. I am the embodiment of heroism and chivalry! A king of kings amongst soul beasts, who is both equally smart and good-looking! I\u2019m an absolute expert, one who has cultivated for a million years! I\u2019m the Skydream Iceworm who\u2019s set the record for the longest lifespan in the Douluo Continent! Yup, you can call me Brother Skydream!\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s eyes instantly turned lifeless, \u201cMil-Million year soul beast?\u201d The Skydream Iceworm\u2019s age differed from his prediction by a factor of ten thousand times. Furthermore, were there really such existences as million year soul beasts in the world? The strongest soul beast on the Douluo Continent should only be a hundred thousand years old!The Skydream Iceworm, who was clearly pleased with himself, said, \u201cAren\u2019t you in awe? Aren\u2019t you really excited? You\u2019re the first human who\u2019s seen my almighty figure.\u201dHuo Yuhao blankly said, \u201cThen what do you want to do?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm\u2019s voice suddenly became serious, \u201cThis brother wants to become your soul ring\u2014the Douluo Continent\u2019s first ever intelligent soul ring.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Huo Yuhao looked at the Skydream Iceworm in front of him with a dumbstruck expression. He\u2019d momentarily lost his ability to think.Everything that had occurred so far had simply been too sudden. Admittedly, he did thirst for a soul ring. However, in the past, the soul ring that he\u2019d wanted to obtain was simply a ten year soul ring. He\u2019d never had any extravagant hopes. Yet, at this moment, a massive silkworm that could talk had suddenly dug itself out from beneath the ground, had told him that it was an almighty million year soul beast, and that it wanted to become his soul ring. This made Huo Yuhao completely unable to understand what was going on at all. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t know whether the Skydream Iceworm was telling the truth or not.However, the enormous silkworm in front of him wasn\u2019t something that he could hope to fight, regardless of whether it was telling the truth or not.The Skydream Iceworm\u2019s enormous head turned in the direction of the Great Star Dou Forest, and carefully scanned it. Then, it turned back towards Huo Yuhao and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to start, okay? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be gentle. I won\u2019t cause too much pain.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Before Huo Yuhao could even voice any sort of opposition, an extremely cold aura caused him to immediately lose consciousness. He could only faintly see a white object charging towards him. In the next moment, all of his thoughts faded away.The ten golden patterns on the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s body moved rhythmically, almost as if they were alive. The white object that Huo Yuhao had seen was actually the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s head, which had reached forward to press against his head.The ten golden patterns rapidly enveloped Huo Yuhao\u2019s skinny body, and the Skydream Iceworm slowly turned itself halos of white light that unceasingly surged into his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is simply too tragic. I\u2019m so pitiful, ah! Just how many more seals will I have to put on my body before his weak body can support me? It\u2019s so hard to become an intelligent soul ring.\u201dWhen the Skydream Iceworm had surged towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, a layer of incorporeal spiritual undulations had spread out from its body. These terrifying spiritual energy undulations almost instantly covered everything within a hundred miles.When the spiritual energy undulations covered Bei Bei and Tang Ya, who had sped up to chase after Huo Yuhao, they immediately fell into a momentarily sluggish state. Although the spiritual attack hadn\u2019t been too damaging, it still caused all living beings to lose their ability to think for a short period of time.At this moment, a large portion of the southern area of the Great Star Dou Forest had become frighteningly quiet.Previously, the sky had been extremely clear and sunny. However, it had suddenly darkened, and a thunder-like boom resounded out in the air. In that instant, the sun\u2019s brilliant rays of light were unexpectedly covered up by the darkness. Then, an enormous pressure that caused one to be unable to even breathe descended from the sky.When the thunder-like boom resounded in the air, the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s enormous body, who was currently trying to merge with Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, violently shook for a moment. Its small, golden eyes looked upwards into the sky, and a terrified look immediately appeared inside of them. Inside of that terrified expression was also a hint of shock. The pressure in the sky clearly hadn\u2019t affected it, but it exceeded its knowledge.A grey stream of air descended from the sky, as if an enormous attractive force had sucked it downwards. After only an instant, it landed on the back of Huo Yuhao\u2019s head, and quietly entered it.\u201cWho dares to fight with this brother over a person?\u201d The Skydream Iceworm flew into a rage. Its huge spiritual undulations instantly surged forth in an attempt to expel the grey stream of air from Huo Yuhao\u2019s body.An extremely blurry figure appeared behind Huo Yuhao, and an aged voice with a hard-to-describe imposingness echoed out, \u201cThe hand grasps the sun and moon, and also plucks the stars; This world has no one like me. I didn\u2019t think that this old man would have a trace of a remnant spirit left that still existed here.\u201dThe vague and illusory figure didn\u2019t seem to be affected by the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s powerful spiritual attack at all. With a whoosh, it disappeared into the back of Huo Yuhao\u2019s head.The Skydream Iceworm didn\u2019t dare to strengthen his spiritual attack again, as traces of blood had already begun to seep out of Huo Yuhao\u2019s seven apertures. He discovered that, after the grey stream of air had entered Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind, it had immediately turned into a soybean-sized grey pearl. Then, it had turned silent. It didn\u2019t conflict with his spiritual energy, nor could he affect it with his power.\u201cI can\u2019t be this unlucky. It was so hard to find a spiritual-type human, but a bastard wants to snatch him from me. Are the heavens jealous of a genius like myself? This brother is so pitiful!\u201d Although he was currently voicing his complaints, his movements didn\u2019t slow down at all. Dense white light gradually condensed and poured into Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, while the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s body both gradually turned more transparent during the process, and rapidly decreased in volume. There had already been no turning back for him, from the instant he\u2019d started to pour his energy into Huo Yuhao\u2019s body.Huo Yuhao\u2019s body had turned completely jade-white, and resembled the previous appearance of the Skydream Iceworm. His shoulders\u2019 wounds were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.\u201cWahaha, no matter what way you put it, this brother is finally free! You bastards who took me as food no longer have any chance, wahaha!\u201d The Skydream Iceworm\u2019s voice, who was clearly pleased with himself, gradually turned softer and softer. The huge spiritual energy that had previously covered a hundred miles proceeded to shrink at a frightening speed, then gradually disappeared.Several terrifying auras from within the depths of the Great Star Dou Forest simultaneously let out violent undulations, as if they\u2019d sensed something. However, they were fated to to not have any success in their endeavors.When the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s voice had completely disappeared, a jade-white halo soundlessly appeared beneath Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. After circling around his body three times, its light dimmed, and the entire halo merged into his body, disappearing without a trace.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t know that, while he was unconscious, he\u2019d managed to obtain his first soul ring. Furthermore, this was a soul ring that was truly unrivalled and unique on the Douluo Continent.The jade-white colour gradually faded from Huo Yuhao, and an ice-blue layer started to appear below his skin. This lasted roughly ten seconds, before it gradually dimmed and restored the original colour of his skin. Then, his body tilted, causing him to fall against the tree he\u2019d previously leaned against.A thin white membrane that had a faint golden sheen to it soundlessly rose into the air, before it rapidly shrunk and formed a ball that disappeared inside of Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart. There were no more traces of the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s aura after that.The big hole in the road had already closed at an earlier time, and except for the collapsed Huo Yuhao, the baboon that\u2019d been killed by him had had its corpse left on the ground. Everything else also seemed to have recovered to its normal state.Not long afterwards, two figures ran over extremely quickly.\u201cAh!\u201d A figure let out a cry, and instantly sped up. She sped over to Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, and stopped beside him.\u201cWe\u2019re late. It seems little brother Yuhao was attacked. These soul beasts have really become more and more rampant! They\u2019ve actually come out of the Great Star Dou Forest!\u201d Tang Ya carefully helped Huo Yuhao up off the ground, a gloomy and worried expression on her face.Bei Bei walked over to the baboon and turned it over. He saw that a slanted, foot-long wound had been inflicted on the baboon\u2019s chest, and that even its heart had been cut part. This was clearly a fatal wound.\u201cThat was a Wind Baboon. From its size, and the strength of its muscles, it should be a ten year soul beast. It\u2019s already dead.\u201d Bei Bei walked over to Tang Ya and squatted down to check on Huo Yuhao\u2019s condition.The thing that amazed them was that, although Huo Yuhao\u2019s clothing had been seriously damaged, they couldn\u2019t find any sign of injury on his body.Bei Bei tapped Huo Yuhao\u2019s wrist with his right forefinger, which caused the White Tiger Dagger to drop into his palm. A faint blue light flashed in Bei Bei\u2019s hand for an instant, and then a hazy blue luster immediately appeared on the White Tiger Dagger.\u201cThis is a soul tool. Yuhao must\u2019ve used it to kill that Wind Baboon. Although the Wind Baboon was only a ten year soul beast, both its speed and power are relatively decent, and it can also use an innate soul skill to attack its opponents. Since he can kill a Wind Baboon at his age, Little Yuhao is already quite good. It seems that our earlier judgement of Yuhao wasn\u2019t accurate enough\u2014he should already be a first ring soul master.\u201dTang Ya anxiously examined Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, then said, \u201cTalking about this is useless right now. We wasted time all because you insisted that I wash my hands and my face. If something happens to Little Yuhao because of that, I\u2019ll never forgive myself. No matter what level of talent he has, I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019ll definitely convince him to join our Tang Sect.\u201dBei Bei\u2019s gaze softened as he looked at Tang Ya\u2019s anxious expression. The kindness that came from Tang Ya\u2019s heart was something he loved very much. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s fine. Can\u2019t you see that his breathing is normal? There aren\u2019t any wounds on his body either. Judging from his the way he fainted, he must\u2019ve lost consciousness after being slammed into that tree by the Wind Baboon during their battle.\u201dTang Ya stared blankly for a moment, then raised her head up and glared at Bei Bei. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? You made me worried.\u201dBei Bei helplessly replied, \u201cWho could\u2019ve known that you\u2019d be unable to see something so simple?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Tang Ya helped Huo Yuhao up, and allowed him to lean on her body. After confirming that he truly had no problems, she relaxed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He dreamt that he\u2019d entered a pure white space. There were many motes of light within the space, and he couldn\u2019t see the end of it. However, his gaze still seemed to somehow be able to reach every single corner of the space.Whilst in the midst of understanding the mysteries of the space, it had suddenly turned turbulent. After that, golden lights had interweaved and entered the space.The golden lights converged into enormous golden rings of light which floated in midair, and the many motes of light within the room started to increase in size due to their appearance.The ten golden rings of light slowly started to rotate, and a milky white halo appeared within every single one of them. As the halo\u2019s strength increased, they gradually gathered together and formed ten enormous balls of light that floated within the space. The height and the volume of the space increased many folds in size in turn.At that moment, an unremarkable grey ball of light appeared near one of the golden balls of light. The grey ball\u2019s size was much smaller than the other ten balls of light. Furthermore, the golden balls of light began releasing a strong golden light, as if they wanted to chase it away. However, the grey ball remained tranquil, and continued to float in midair. No matter how much the golden lights attacked the grey ball, it didn\u2019t seem to be affected at all.In the end, the ten golden lights could only give up on the meaningless task. They turned stable, and flickered with a dim luster.As Huo Yuhao\u2019s consciousness gradually cleared, the smaller motes of light that were floating in the space gradually sank downwards, forming a faint golden ocean that supported the ten enormous balls of light. Only the extremely tiny grey light remained midair, unwilling to join the large balls of light.\u201cSo you\u2019re called Huo Yuhao.\u201d A voice suddenly echoed out. Following that, Huo Yuhao\u2019s vision instantly retracted, and he unconsciously lowered his gaze. He could only see his naked self-standing above the golden ocean, right in the middle of the ten now-golden-white balls of light.\u201cWhere is this? Why am I here?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked in amazement.\u201cThis is your mind\u2019s sea of consciousness, or spiritual sea. In the future, this will be Brother\u2019s home. This place was too small, so Brother simply helped you expand it. However, your body is just too weak, so I\u2019ll have to make do for now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the Skydream Iceworm? I\u2019m not dreaming?\u201d Huo Yuhao became even more stunned when he heard the voice and tone of the person who\u2019d spoken. Everything that he saw in front of him had already surpassed his knowledge. Not to speak of Huo Yuhao, who was only eleven; even adults would be shocked to the point of them trembling in fear if they were presented with such a miraculous scene.\u201cDreaming? If you were able to have such a nice dream, wouldn\u2019t you have died from happiness? This is obviously not a dream. As I said, this is the world within your mind.\u201d The Skydream Iceworm unhappily replied.Huo Yuhao blankly said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm replied, \u201cYou really are foolish. How do I explain this to you? Well\u2026 let\u2019s put it this way. You know about your eyes\u2014they\u2019re the martial soul that your consciousness calls the \u2018Spirit Eyes\u2019. I\u2019ve just gone through your memories, so I know about your previous experiences. The Spirit Eyes are your martial soul, but at the same time also your eyes. Thus, the spiritual sea is where your spiritual energy is stored. If you want to display the might of your Spirit Eyes, you\u2019ll need to convert your soulforce into spiritual energy, then release it using your Spirit Eyes. The specific location of your spiritual sea is your brain, behind your Spirit Eyes. As of right now, your consciousness is immersed within your spiritual sea. The body that you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t actually your real body, but a body that I\u2019ve created using spiritual energy for the sake of communicating with you.\u201dHuo Yuhao finally understood a few things after hearing this detailed explanation. The fear in his heart also weakened by a lot. Young kids were much more sensitive than adults at certain times, and he felt that the Skydream Iceworm truly didn\u2019t have any malicious intentions towards him.\u201cThen, how come you appeared in my spiritual sea?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked again.The Skydream Iceworm replied, \u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you? I want to become your soul ring, an intelligent soul ring! As of now, I\u2019ve already become one. However, for the sake of becoming your soul ring, I\u2019ve suppressed and sealed a large amount of my power. From now on, you\u2019ll have a soul ring, and can become one of the human\u2019s so-called soul masters. However, your innate talent is much worse than what I thought. You can practically use the term \u2018extremely poor\u2019 to describe it. I really don\u2019t know whether my choice was correct or not.Huo Yuhao was slightly ashamed as he said, \u201cI admit that my talent isn\u2019t that good. But, I\u2019ll work hard. My innate spirit power was only rank one.\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm gloomily said, \u201cI\u2019ll think of a method to help you improve yourself later on.\u201dAs the length of the conversation increased, Huo Yuhao\u2019s guts did too. \u201cSkydream Iceworm.\u201d\u201cCall me Brother Skydream.\u201d\u201cFine, Brother Skydream. You said that you were a million year soul beast, is that true? Also, why did you pick me? I\u2019ve heard that Soul Scholars can only withstand soul rings that are below four hundred years old. However, since you\u2019re a million year soul beast, how were you able to become my soul ring?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm suddenly let out a long sigh, \u201cDo you think that I wanted to pick you? I had no other choice! If I\u2019d continued to refrain from making a choice, my life would\u2019ve come to an end. And once I died, my body would\u2019ve most likely become food for those guys in the Great Star Dou Forest! Under my state of helplessness, I could only use this plan to attach myself to you humans. This is also my only way out. Would you like to listen to my story? In the future, we\u2019ll be with each other for a very, very long time. I don\u2019t want to hide anything from you either, so I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head and said, \u201cBrother Skydream, please speak.\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm replied, \u201cAt first, I was just an ordinary Iceworm soul beast. I wasn\u2019t born in the Great Star Dou Forest, but in an extremely cold place located in the northern areas of the continent. We Iceworms are soul beasts that have two innate attributes, spiritual and ice attributes. However, our combat strength is seriously limited by our speed. Thus, we can only be considered very ordinary soul beasts. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re also affected by the presence of natural predators. Very few of us can cultivate longer than ten thousand years. I\u2019m the sole exception to that.\u201d\u201cWhen I was thirteen years old, I carelessly fell into a crack in the ice whilst running away from a predator. At that time, I thought I was done for. However, who could\u2019ve known that I\u2019d drop into a ball of ten thousand year Ice Pith? I sank into a deep sleep after that. I was still very weak and small back then, and my body wasn\u2019t even three inches long. That sleep lasted for an entire ten thousand years. When I woke up, I found myself in an icy cave. That ten thousand year Ice Pith had disappeared\u2014it had all been absorbed by me. However, as a result of my slumber, I had thus turned into a ten thousand year soul beast. I was indescribably pleased and surprised back then! However, I discovered that I couldn\u2019t find any way to exit the icy cave at all.\u201d\u201cI was surrounded by extremely hard ice in that icy cave. Although I had already become a ten thousand year soul beast, our Iceworm clan has always been weak in combat, resulting in me being unable to forcefully break through the ice. Fortunately, there were many holes in the icy cave that I was able to climb through. Thus, I crawled around in search of an exit. In the end, I still couldn\u2019t find an exit, but I found an even larger ball of Ice Pith. The appearance of this new ball of Ice Pith signified that I had food to eat. Hence, I entered another deep sleep. However, this sleep lasted several tens of thousands of years\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 3.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3.1: The Million Year Soul RingAs Huo Yuhao listened to the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s explanation, he suddenly felt a strange feeling. Could it be that the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s name was because it had dreamt everyday?\u201cAlthough I wasn\u2019t able to leave the icy cave, eating the ten thousand year Ice Pith simply felt too good. Thus, I was lucky to not be able to find a way out, because I found another large lump of ten thousand year Ice Pith whilst crawling around to look for one. I slept again, but I didn\u2019t even know how long I\u2019d slept for this time\u2014yet the first set of golden patterns had appeared on my body by the time I woke up.\u201d\u201cA golden pattern has an extremely important meaning to us Iceworms. It signifies that our cultivation has reached a hundred thousand years. From what I remember, our Iceworm clan has never had an existence possess a cultivation of a hundred thousand years. I was the first to do this! This was unprecedented in history! At that time, I evolved into a Gold-patterned Iceworm. I also had sufficient power to break through the ice and leave. However, at that time, I didn\u2019t know that hundred thousand year soul beasts would suffer enormous restrictions, which would make it harder for them to increase their cultivation. Perhaps it was because I was lucky, or perhaps it was because our Iceworm clan has a deficiency of combat strength, but I miraculously didn\u2019t attract any Heavenly Tribulation.\u201d The Skydream Iceworm sighed. \u201cI decided to continue sleeping, since I was too lazy to leave anyway. Thus, I continued to sleep in the icy caves. Because my cultivation had reached a certain level, I was able to break the ice and enter areas which I previously couldn\u2019t. This allowed me to find even more top quality Ice Piths, all of which became my food.\u201cJust like that, I repeated the cycle of sleeping after eating, and eating after waking up. I didn\u2019t even know how much time had passed. Only the golden patterns on my body were able to tell me how long I\u2019d lived for.\u201d\u201cIn the end, I finished eating all of the Ice Pith within the icy caves one day. I then dug myself out from the bottom of the icy caves, arriving at the ocean. I floated in the ocean, and moved with the tide; I floated along the edge of the continent, eventually moving towards the south. I also encountered my first enemy during this journey.\u201d\u201cAt that time, I already had nine golden patterns, which meant that I was a powerful nine hundred thousand year soul beast. I originally thought that I was an unequalled existence within this world. However\u2026\u201dAs he continued to speak, the Skydream Iceworm clearly became somewhat embarrassed, \u201cHowever, I\u2019d never done anything nor fought with anyone when I was awake. In the end, I had to rely on my enormous spiritual energy to scare that enemy away. This finally roused my caution, which made me attempt to cultivate the ability to attack. However, I discovered that my cultivation lifespan didn\u2019t mean that I was strong. I was indeed a million year soul beast, but my combat power was in fact inferior to some ten thousand year soul beasts. Those ten thousand year soul beasts that were good at fighting were simply opponents I couldn\u2019t hope to achieve victory over. The outside world was truly too dangerous. However, I didn\u2019t know the way back.\u201d\u201cI thought that since the ocean was dangerous, perhaps the continent would be safer. Thus, I went ashore. However, I discovered that the continent wasn\u2019t very peaceful either. Maybe it was an effect of absorbing too much Ice Pith, but my body had a special smell that could attract the attention of any and all soul beasts. It caused them to see me as food.\u201d\u201cIn the end, I was captured by a strong hundred thousand year soul beast from the Great Star Dou Forest. However, it didn\u2019t immediately kill me; Instead, it brought me to the Great Star Dou Forest. Only after listening to him did I understand what was going on. As it turned out, I possessed too much Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi. As long as they were able to absorb and transform my energy, any soul beast could become a hundred thousand year soul beast, and any hundred thousand year soul beasts could break free from the limit of their cultivation lifespan. But, it took a long time to absorb my energy, since the energy I\u2019d cultivated for a million years was too enormous. Thus, it brought me back to its nest.\u201d\u201cHowever, that fellow underestimated how awesome this Brother is. Although I wasn\u2019t too good at fighting, I was able to increase the strength of my aura. Thus, I was able to attract all of the hundred thousand year soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest. Hehe.\u201d\u201cThe huge battle royale that ensued included nearly every single soul beast in the Great Star Dou Forest whose age exceeded ten thousand. They fought so desperately! I originally thought that I now had a chance to escape. However, who could\u2019ve known that they\u2019d be so crafty? Once the battle had almost ended, they actually stopped and negotiated with each other. In the end, a tragedy occurred to this Brother. They finally came to an agreement, deciding to absorb my power together, since the soulforce in my body was large enough. After that, they trapped me in the centre of the Great Star Dou Forest and forced me to release the Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi from my body for them to absorb. The stronger soul beasts would be closer to me, and the benefits they obtained would thus be greater. These bastards practically took this Brother as food.\u201d\u201cAi, since I had no way to resist them, I could only let them order me around. I tried to think of a plan to break free from their control whilst having my energy drained by them. My Yuan Qi was very pure, thus there was enough for them to absorb it for over ten thousand years. After a few thousand years of pondering and observing, I discovered that I\u2019d not only need to escape from them, but would also need to conceal my aura to successfully break free from their control. You humans then appeared in my line of sight. There were a few times when some especially strong humans entered the depths of the Great Star Dou Forest to hunt those hundred thousand year soul beasts. Unfortunately, they were struck by a tragedy. Under the nourishment of this Brother, the high ranking soul beasts within the Great Star Dou Forest had definitely become the strongest soul beasts on the Douluo Continent. Although those humans had extremely strong weapons, they could only suffer a big defeat. However, this allowed me to understand the advantages you humans had.\u201d\u201cBrother is a spiritual and ice dual-attribute soul beast. After thinking about it for a long time, I decided to think of a way to become a human\u2019s soul ring. If this happened, that human would definitely become extraordinarily strong, and I could rely on my spiritual-type attribute to preserve my own consciousness. Thus, I would become an unprecedented intelligent soul ring. Humph, once that happened, Brother would definitely get revenge, and would help that human kill all of the bastards who persecuted this Brother. Hence, I started carrying out my plan. However, who could\u2019ve known that I\u2019d fail on my first attempt? The guy that I chose was what you humans call a Titled Douluo, and he was rather strong. However, he was truly rubbish. He actually exploded immediately, before even seeing my real body. He couldn\u2019t even withstand the shock of my spiritual energy. Only then did I discover that becoming my host wasn\u2019t something so simple. They would first need to have a spiritual-type attribute as well, and be able to sustain the energy of my soul power. This was something that was even harder. Hence, I had no results, even after searching for a few thousand years. At that point, my soulforce had almost been fully drained by those hundred thousand year soul beasts. This Brother would\u2019ve soon become akin to a candle that had no wax left.\u201d\u201cHowever, the Heavens still took care of Brother. When Brother had already despaired, the tenth golden pattern appeared on my body. I\u2019d finally become an unprecedented million year soul beast. After the tenth golden pattern appeared, I finally possessed the power to resist those combat-oriented hundred thousand year soul beasts, and I could also conceal my own aura. Thus, I renamed myself as the Skydream Iceworm; I was no longer a Gold-patterned Iceworm. However, I was definitely unable to beat so many hundred thousand year soul beasts. Furthermore, my Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi had almost been fully absorbed by them. The only energy that I still had was my origin soulforce, which was what would provide the greatest aid to them. These were my two great attributes, which had yet to be absorbed. Revenge was something currently unattainable for me. Hence, I found an opportunity, and used the energy that I had obtained after breaking through to conceal my aura. Then, I escaped by burrowing through the earth.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Breaking through to a million year soul beast was actually a double edged sword. Although I managed to barely break free from their control, my lifespan suddenly reached its end due to the Heavenly Tribulation that abruptly arrived. If I wasn\u2019t able to preserve my life with other methods, I would\u2019ve died soon from exhaustion; it was also at this moment when Brother met you, a young fellow. Although you were pitifully weak, Brother had no other choice! Yet, you also had a spiritual-type attribute. Hence, Brother could only work hard to merge with your body. No matter which way you look at it, those bastards can\u2019t obtain this Brother\u2019s most precious thing.\u201dHuo Yuhao had already forgotten his fear from earlier as he listened to the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s story. He felt righteously indignant as he said, \u201cThey\u2019re too despicable. How could they be like this? They actually trapped you for almost ten thousand years!\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm felt that his anger gave them common ground as he said, \u201cExactly! Although Brother is quite cute, quite handsome, and quite strong, they simply can\u2019t treat Brother as food! Things are good now though. On the whole, I\u2019ve managed to escape and not allow them to obtain Brother\u2019s body. Huo Yuhao, although you\u2019re young and your abilities are still lacking, it\u2019s fortunate that you\u2019re still pure. Brother will treat this as a plan to raise you up. When you\u2019re strong in the future, you must help Brother get revenge! Didn\u2019t they rely on my soulforce to evolve? In the future, turn them into your soul rings and soul bones! Humph!\u201dHuo Yuhao had no hesitation at all as he answered, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely help you get revenge after I grow up.\u201d This relationship between man and beast had rapidly deepened due to this slightly odd yet miraculous story.In reality, although the Skydream Iceworm had lived for a million years, it had only met with a few soul beasts after all. Even though its intelligence wasn\u2019t inferior to that of a human\u2019s, how could it know that humans had sinister hearts? If a human had encountered fortunate events like the Skydream Iceworm had, he would absolutely not reveal his story so easily. Choosing a kid like Huo Yuhao, who was practically as white as a sheet of paper, was actually quite lucky for it.\u201cBrother Skydream, I still don\u2019t understand a few things. Since you\u2019re so strong, you had to seal your own power to become my soul ring. Just what\u2019s the matter with this? Can you still bestow a soul skill to me?\u201d After losing his fear, an even greater sense of curiosity filled Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart.The Skydream Iceworm laughed cunningly as he said, \u201cBrother naturally has a way. Since I\u2019ve been planning this for so long, I\u2019ve already prepared the proper arrangements. After obtaining some experience from blowing those humans up, I realised that all of my help will have to focus on your safety. I already have no way of retreat now; if you die, I die too. My original soulforce was almost fully drained by those soul beasts from the Great Star Dou Forest. Otherwise, your body wouldn\u2019t have been able to withstand my power, even if I\u2019d sealed it. When I merged with your body, most of the energy that entered you was my origin energy and my spiritual energy. Can you see those ten balls of light? They\u2019re the ten seals that I\u2019ve set up. If you look at it from another angle, it can be said that I\u2019ve already bestowed you the power of your first soul ring. However, you\u2019re temporarily unable to use it.\u201d\u201cThis also means that, although your first soul ring is a million year soul ring, it currently doesn\u2019t have the might of a million year soul ring. However, the energy that I\u2019ve sealed within your body will gradually disperse as your cultivation improves, which in turn will increase the might of your soul ring. It might even increase the might of your future soul rings. After all, the energy that I\u2019ve accumulated over a million years is simply too enormous for you.\u201dHuo Yuhao blinked his eyes and said, \u201cI still don\u2019t fully understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm unhappily said, \u201cIdiot. I\u2019ll repeat the simple points again. Your body, which has currently obtained its first soul ring, can only withstand the soul ring of a four hundred year old soul beast at most. Thus, the realistic might of your first soul ring is a four hundred year soul ring. After you make a breakthrough you\u2019ll be able to withstand the might of a thousand year soul ring, so your first soul ring will become a thousand year soul ring. Your first soul ring will follow the amount of energy that your body can withstand, and will increase accordingly. In other words, your first soul ring can evolve at any time, and your future soul rings will also have this benefit. Of course, this evolutionary energy that I can bestow upon you is limited. The stronger the soul ring you obtain in the future, the more energy you save for me. Using the energy that I sealed within your body, it can at most help increase ten of your soul rings reach the hundred thousand year soul ring rank.\u201cAh? So many? We soul masters can only possess nine soul rings at most, no?\u201d Huo Yuhao spoke with a startled tone.The Skydream Iceworm snorted coldly and loftily said, \u201cThat\u2019s only true for ordinary people. You\u2019re already no longer an ordinary person\u2014ever since Brother merged with you. A single martial soul can naturally only absorb only nine soul rings. However, you currently don\u2019t just have a single martial soul. After killing a hundred thousand year soul beast, you will both obtain a soul bone and a hundred thousand year soul ring that contains two soul skills within it. You should know this.\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head.The Skydream Iceworm said. \u201cAs a million year soul ring, and an unprecedented intelligent soul ring, I\u2019m obviously stronger than them. Not only can my incarnation, which is your first soul ring, undergo unlimited evolution according to the condition of your body, it can also bestow four soul skills to you. However, I have no soul bones that I can give to you\u2014instead, I can give you another martial soul.\u201dHuo Yuhao had already predicted that a million year soul ring would benefit him greatly, but he\u2019d never thought that it would be to this extent. A soul ring that could undergo unlimited evolution had already caused him to be ineffably happy. Yet, the greater surprise was actually in its other benefits. Four soul skills and an extra martial soul, just what kind of concept was this?Since the four soul skills belonged to the first soul ring, their might would inevitably evolve as his first soul ring evolved. They were abilities that could be used forever! And, an extra martial soul could simply be described as a miracle. It was equivalent to turning him, who only had the Spirit Eyes martial soul, into a genius who had twin martial souls. Adding another martial soul would mean that he would have at least nine additional soul rings, which would give him nine more soul skills. How could a hundred thousand year soul ring even compare to the strength amplification of this million year soul ring? Although his own strength was still weak even after obtaining these amplifications, and required him to slowly increase it, this million year soul ring undoubtedly opened a great door to the heavens for Huo Yuhao, allowing him, who\u2019d originally had mediocre talent, to have a future of unlimited possibilities.\u201cThe martial soul that I\u2019ve bestowed you with is Ice, but it\u2019s Ice that currently doesn\u2019t have a soul.\u201d The words that the Skydream Iceworm said next pulled Huo Yuhao back from his happiness.\u201cIce that doesn\u2019t have a soul? What\u2019s that?\u201d Huo Yuhao had a look of doubt on his face.The Skydream Iceworm said, \u201cThis means that the martial soul I\u2019ve bestowed you currently only has an attribute, but not a form. When you absorb your first ice-type soul ring, the form of your second martial soul will be finalized. The soul beast of the soul ring you absorb then will thus become your second martial soul. This also means that your second martial soul will definitely be a beast soul. You don\u2019t have to worry about this, I\u2019ve already thought about it for you. However, your current cultivation isn\u2019t sufficient. Once your strength is higher, I\u2019ll take you to complete your first ice-type soul ring. Now you should understand why I said that I wouldn\u2019t have enough energy to amplify your soul rings. Because of this, you must be extremely careful when choosing your soul rings, and you should listen to my suggestions.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Something that you comprehend on your own will always be clearer than something I tell you directly. However, don\u2019t be happy so early. You\u2019re right, I\u2019ve given you four soul skills, and they\u2019re all spiritual-type soul skills; however the energy that I\u2019ve sealed within your body is also very enormous. Thus, you must remember a few things. Firstly, the energy that I\u2019ve sealed inside of your body can only help you increase the age of your soul rings\u2014which is also their might\u2014when your cultivation has reached a sufficient stage. However, it can\u2019t increase the strength of the soulforce that you cultivate. Secondly, the four soul skills that I\u2019ve bestowed you with are, due to the fact that they\u2019re from me, auxiliary soul skills that don\u2019t have much attack power. Because of this, you\u2019re still quite weak right now. You still have a long way to go if you want to become strong, do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand. My mother taught me that nobody could reach the heavens in a single step, that one step could only leave a single footprint. The only way for one to become a man above all other men is to rely on one\u2019s own hard work and diligence. Brother Skydream, you can rest assured; I\u2019ll definitely work hard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. However, your natural aptitude is truly poor. Ai\u2026 if there\u2019s a chance in the future, I\u2019ll find some heavenly treasures for you to eat. Your Spirit Eyes martial soul was caused by a mutation, but your potential isn\u2019t bad. However, the mutation process has greatly affected your bodily functions since you were young. Your passageways are now narrow and rough, causing your cultivation to be slightly challenging. Let\u2019s take it slowly, we can\u2019t rush this. Oh right, there\u2019s something I have tell you.\u201cCan you see that grey ball up there?\u201dHuo Yuhao said, \u201cI can see it. Is that also your power?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know either. It happened when I fused with your body. I think your soulforce may have caused this. That grey ball of light seems to be a spirit, and also seems to not belong to our world. I don\u2019t even know where it came from. However, although this spirit was weak, it\u2019s a very high ranked spirit, so I don\u2019t have any methods of dealing with it. However, I can sense that it doesn\u2019t have any evil intentions. Right now, it\u2019s currently in a deep sleep. It might not wake up during your entire lifetime, but if it does, it could be slightly troublesome. Don\u2019t worry, if it doesn\u2019t move, then that\u2019s that; If it truly does do anything harmful to you, I\u2019ll protect you\u2014it won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\u201cAlright, you should go back to your body now. The two humans outside have been waiting for you this whole time, and they don\u2019t have any evil intentions towards you.\u201d\u201cTwo humans?\u201d While Huo Yuhao was astonished, the scenery in front of him suddenly turned blurry. He felt like he\u2019d instantly been sucked into an enormous whirlpool, and everything turned dark.\u2026\u2026\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you woken up yet!\u201d Tang Ya patted Huo Yuhao\u2019s face and shot an inquisitive glance towards Bei Bei, who was next to her.Bei Bei gently smiled and said, \u201cBoth his qi and blood are completely smooth, and his body\u2019s soulforce is very normal. Furthermore, it\u2019s very vigorous. If I\u2019m not wrong, he must\u2019ve just broken through the soul Scholar realm, and this is the sign of him entering the Soul Master realm. His body needs to harmonize with this power right now, thus he naturally needs a certain amount of time to get used to the soulforce that he\u2019s obtained after breaking through. Unfortunately, it was only a ten year Wind Baboon.\u201dTang Ya humphed and said, \u201cHow is that very unfortunate? It\u2019s normal for someone\u2019s first soul ring to be a bit weaker than the rest. The fact that he was able to kill a Wind Baboon by himself is already quite good.\u201dBei Bei chuckled and said, \u201cThe way to capture a woman\u2019s heart is through her stomach, much less for a person like you, whose heart and stomach are conjoined.\u201dTang Ya\u2019s charming face turned slightly red, \u201cPah, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s heart and stomach are conjoined. You\u2019re impudent; don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m your teacher!\u201dBei Bei didn\u2019t retort. He only looked at her and warmly smile.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Huo Yuhao let out a light groan, and slowly opened his eyes.\u201cLittle Yuhao, you\u2019ve finally woken up! You worried me to death.\u201d Tang Ya was immediately exhilarated when she saw Huo Yuhao open his eyes.Huo Yuhao felt some confusion in his mind, and only became clear-headed after composing himself. He clearly recalled the conversation that he\u2019d previously had with the Skydream Iceworm, causing him to be unable to help but subconsciously mutter to himself, \u201cWas I really not dreaming?\u201dTang Ya giggled and pinched Huo Yuhao\u2019s arm for a moment, causing him to immediately cry out in pain. \u201cSister Xiao Ya, what\u2019re you doing?\u201dTang Ya smiled. \u201cI\u2019m helping you check whether or not you were dreaming! How are you? Are you more awake now? You really have some guts, actually daring to travel into the Great Star Dou Forest by yourself.\u201dHuo Yuhao was slightly embarrassed as he scratched his head. Held only just learned how weak he was, and how much he\u2019d overestimated his capabilities, after meeting the Wind Baboon. However, an eager feeling quickly rose up from his embarrassment. He jumped up from the ground, and roused the soulforce in his body.A scene that made Huo Yuhao indescribably happy immediately appeared.His soulforce, which had originally reached a bottleneck, had undergone a qualitative change\u2014even the strength of his body seemed to have slightly increased. Gentle soul power surged out, and everything that he saw with his Spirit Eyes became clearer. Furthermore, many instinctive marks had appeared in his mind, and each and every one of them were skills. Four, there are actually four soul skills! Brother Skydream truly exists! I wasn\u2019t dreaming! Everything\u2019s real, I actually possess a million year soul ring!Only now did Huo Yuhao believe that everything he\u2019d experienced earlier was real. The ecstasy in his heart surged out unceasingly, and he couldn\u2019t help but let out a loud shout, \u201cI\u2019ve succeeded!\u201dBei Bei and Tang Ya saw a jade-white soul ring rise from Huo Yuhao\u2019s feet. It slowly moved upwards, all the way until it reached his head. Then, it slowly moved downwards with a rhythmic pace. It was his first soul ring.Bei Bei subconsciously thought to himself, \u201cSure enough, it\u2019s a ten year soul ring.\u201d Only, he had a slight feeling of doubt in his heart. Why did the colour of Huo Yuhao\u2019s ten year soul ring seem to have a sort of sparkling, translucent feeling\u2014as if it were slightly different from an ordinary ten year soul ring? Could it be that the Wind Baboon had had a higher cultivation? However, how could he have known that a million year soul ring was also jade-white?The change that had occurred to Huo Yuhao wasn\u2019t limited to just his soul ring; a faint gold sheen had also appeared inside of his deep blue eyes. Bei Bei and Tang Ya could both sense undulations of soulforce from his eyes, as well as a spiritual undulation, which caused them to be distracted for an instant.Previously, the powerful spiritual energy that had been released by the Skydream Iceworm had caused them to temporarily lose the ability to think. However, they had been unable to sense it due to the enormous difference between it and them. However, Huo Yuhao was currently very close to them. He\u2019d changed, and the spiritual undulations that were being released from his eyes caused them to be shocked.\u201cA spiritual-type martial soul? A spiritual-type martial soul that\u2019s merged with a Wind Baboon as its first soul ring?\u201d Bei Bei, who\u2019d been calm until now, couldn\u2019t help but have his expression slightly change. According to the theory of soul masters that he understood, this seemed to be something impossible! However, the facts were right in front of him.The faint golden sheen quickly vanished from Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d also recovered from his surprise. He excitedly jumped up, \u201cSucceeded, I\u2019ve truly succeeded! I\u2019m a Soul Master now!\u201dBei Bei and Tang Ya both looked at each other and saw the shock in the other\u2019s eyes. Tang Ya couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cLittle Yuhao, is your martial soul a spiritual-type? I sensed a strong spiritual undulation earlier.\u201dHuo Yuhao finally recovered from his excitement, and he was slightly embarrassed as he said, \u201cYeah! My martial soul is the Spirit Eyes. It\u2019s a mutated martial soul that has the spiritual attribute.\u201dTang Ya\u2019s eyes brightened, \u201cSpirit Eyes? A body soul? Good.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What a pity that we arrived late. If we hadn\u2019t, we would\u2019ve found little brother Huo a better soul beast to merge with.\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s mind had already cleared up from his earlier surprise. Although he was young, the experiences that he\u2019d had in his youth had caused him to be somewhat vigilant. He immediately guessed that Bei Bei and Tang Ya must\u2019ve thought that the soul ring he\u2019d just absorbed had been from the baboon. Even though he didn\u2019t understand why a million year soul ring was white, this was undoubtedly his current best way of concealing it. Naturally, he wouldn\u2019t go and explain anything.\u201cBig brother Bei, sister Xiao Ya, did you guys chase after me? Are there any problems?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked probingly.Tang Ya replied, \u201cWe only guessed that you were here to enter the Great Star Dou Forest, but I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d really do it. Your guts are too big. Don\u2019t you know that the Great Star Dou Forest is called a forbidden area for mankind? Even some Soul Masters with extremely high cultivations don\u2019t dare to enter the inner parts of the forest. And if it\u2019s a little guy like you, a teacher must accompany you for you to even be able to move around the surrounding areas of the Great Star Dou Forest. The reason why we chased after you was to protect you, since Bei Bei and I are Soul Masters. However, your luck is quite good. Although the first soul ring you\u2019ve obtained isn\u2019t too strong, you\u2019ve suffered no injuries on the whole.\u201dAfter hearing her words, a thick warm feeling immediately surged through Huo Yuhao\u2019s young heart. He was young, but he\u2019d experienced far, far too much of the hypocrisy of the world. When Tang Ya was talking, he could tell that there were no traces of falsehood within the sincere look her eyes held.\u201cSister Xiao Ya, I\u2026\u201d Huo Yuhao almost brought up the issue of the Skydream Iceworm, due to impulse. However, at this moment, a cough echoed out in his mind. Under the attack of a certain refreshing aura, he immediately swallowed his words.Tang Ya giggled and said, \u201cLook at your dim-witted appearance. Fine, I won\u2019t talk about that anymore. Little Yuhao, since you\u2019ve already obtained a soul ring, what do you plan to do next?\u201dHuo Yuhao was stunned by her question. Yeah! What plans did he have for himself? Before coming to the Great Star Dou Forest, his aim all along had been to become a Soul Master, and obtain a soul ring that belonged to him. The difference between Soul Masters and Soul Scholars was indeed as vast as the heavens and the earth! Becoming a Soul Master also signified that he\u2019d stepped through a door, one which would allow to him travel through the wide seas and skies from now on. However, he\u2019d truly never thought of what to do in the future. After all, he was only eleven, and this was the first time that he\u2019d left home.Tang Ya was secretly happy when she saw the blank look in his eyes. She sent a glance towards Bei Bei.Bei Bei nodded towards her and said, \u201cLittle brother Huo, what kind of people does your house have?\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s gaze instantly froze for a moment. Following that, he shook his head decisively. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else, I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s left.\u201dTang Ya was exulted. She blurted out, \u201cThen that\u2019s really too good.\u201dHuo Yuhao was immediately stunned, while Bei Bei had a speechless expression on his face. He knocked her head, \u201cWhat\u2019re you saying?\u201dTang Ya had also realised her slip of the tongue. She glared at Bei Bei and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose! Little Yuhao, since you don\u2019t have any ideas right now, why not join our sect?\u201d\u201cA sect?\u201d Huo Yuhao had heard of sects when he was in the Duke\u2019s Mansion. On the Douluo Continent, the strengths of sects were extremely high, especially some Soul Master sects that had long histories. From the meaning of the word \u2018sect\u2019, the Duke\u2019s Mansion in itself could be considered a large sect.Tang Ya nodded her head and said seriously, \u201cIt\u2019s a sect, and was previously the number one sect in the continent. If you join, you definitely won\u2019t be at a disadvantage. Furthermore, our sect\u2019s secret techniques are very suitable for you to cultivate. Since you\u2019re all alone and you\u2019re so young, it\u2019d be better for you to join our sect, since everyone will take care of each other, rather than you being so bold by yourself. After all, luck can\u2019t always be with you. What if something happens when you\u2019re moving by yourself?\u201dHuo Yuhao subconsciously asked, \u201cSister Xiao Ya then, what is your sect called?\u201dTang Ya resolutely said, \u201cThe Tang Sect. It was previously the number one sect in the continent.\u201dAfter hearing the two words \u2018Tang Sect\u2019, Huo Yuhao\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but tremble. Even though the Tang Sect had started to decline, the Tang Sect still had an important place within the Douluo Continent\u2019s history. It could even be said that there had never been a sect that could compare with it.When he was very young, his mother had told him the many legends of the Tang Sect. The Tang Sect had been founded ten thousand years ago, and it could be said to be one of the oldest sects in history. Supposedly, the first sect master of the Tang Sect, Tang San, had changed the entire structure of the continent, establishing the future development of the continent\u2019s Soul Masters. The Tang Sect, at that time, had truly been the number one sect under the heavens, and not just in name. Furthermore, the legends said that Tang San had broken through the highest realm of Soul Masters, Titled Douluo, to become an existence that was on another level, one that wouldn\u2019t die from then on. However, in the end, no one knew how he\u2019d done it.After ten thousand years, the legends of the Tang Sect still remained, but the sect itself had already left the stage of history. Very few people knew that the Tang Sect still had later generations of disciples; even the details of some of the Tang Sect\u2019s legends had already become vague. However, there was someone who had once said that, if it weren\u2019t for Tang San establishing the future development of the Soul Masters within the Douluo Continent ten thousand years ago, the Douluo Continent might not have been able to achieve victory over the experts of the Sun Moon Continent, and thus unify the two continents when the Sun Moon Continent had collided with the Douluo Continent four thousand years ago.\u201cLittle brother Huo, you\u2019ve heard of the Tang Sect?\u201d Bei Bei asked.Huo Yuhao nodded his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some of the legends about the Tang Sect. Only, I don\u2019t know where the Tang Sect is.\u201dThe rims of Tang Ya\u2019s eyes suddenly turned red. \u201cThe Tang Sect doesn\u2019t have its mansion anymore, and our foundations were snatched away. Currently, the only people of the Tang Sect remaining are Bei Bei and I. I\u2019m the current sect master of the Tang Sect, and Bei Bei is my founding disciple.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Huo Yuhao looked at them with an astonished expression. If you just looked at their ages, Tang Ya wasn\u2019t that much older that Bei Bei, and from their conversations, you couldn\u2019t tell that they were master and disciple at all.Bei Bei coughed twice and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve also seen our situation now, little brother Huo. The Tang Sect only has the two of us right now, but we\u2019ll definitely work hard to let the Tang Sect rise again. If you\u2019re willing, you\u2019re welcome to join. There\u2019s one point that Xiao Ya was right about: The Tang Sect has a secret technique that should be completely suitable for you to cultivate, and will have many benefits towards your future development.\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, Huo Yuhao asked, \u201cThen, what do I have to do after I join the Tang Sect?\u201dTang Ya replied, \u201cYou need to unceasingly raise your cultivation, and become even stronger. When the sect needs you, you need to exert yourself for the sect. I won\u2019t boast or lie to you, our Tang Sect has truly declined as of now. However, we still have our secret techniques. Also, another thing. Our Tang Sect was once the number one sect in the continent, so we still have a few privileges. You should\u2019ve heard of the number one academy on the continent, Shrek Academy. Shrek Academy is extremely strict when it recruits students, but they\u2019re willing to give our Tang Sect an exempted spot every year. Bei Bei and I have already joined Shrek Academy, and it just so happens that there\u2019s a space available this year. If you\u2019re willing to join our Tang Sect, this space will belong to you. As for whether or not you can stay in Shrek Academy, that will rely on your hard work. I can give you this much. However, little Yuhao, I have a request. Once you\u2019ve joined the Tang Sect, you\u2019re a man of our Tang Sect for your entire life. If you decide to leave one day, you\u2019ll have to return all of the Tang Sect\u2019s secret techniques.\u201dTang Sect\u2026Tang Sect. Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes gradually brightened, and he looked seriously at Tang Ya. \u201cSister Xiao Ya, I agree; I\u2019m willing to join the Tang Sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joining a sect is not a small matter. Even though our Tang Sect is already on the decline, when all is said and done, we were still once the number one sect under the heavens. If you regret your decision in the future, and wish to betray the sect, no matter whether it is Tang Ya or myself, neither of us will forgive you. \u201dHuo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cBig brother Bei, I\u2019ve already thought this matter through carefully. I no longer have any relatives, and am of a young age as well. I only learned how dangerous the outside world was after coming to the Great Star Dou Forest this time around. I want to become an outstanding individual and a powerful Soul Master. Joining the Tang Sect is no doubt a shortcut for me to achieve that. Not only does joining the Tang Sect let me enter Shrek Academy, I can furthermore receive guidance from the both of you. Moreover, I believe in the both of you. The two of you were willing to tell me of the predicaments the Tang Sect is currently facing. I can thus feel the sincerity that the both of you hold towards me. I\u2019m willing to help the Tang Sect regain its glory together with the both of you.\u201d\u201cGood, you couldn\u2019t have said it any better.\u201d Tang Ya took hold of Huo Yuhao, and embraced him in excitement.Bei Bei also nodded slightly as he looked at Huo Yuhao, as if he felt the same way too. Huo Yuhao was much more mature than his peers of the same age. Although he\u2019d only obtained his first soul ring after he was over ten years old, and even though talent was important, hard work was absolutely necessary, let alone the fact that he was a rarely-seen owner of a spiritual-type body soul. It could be said that the Tang Sect had gotten him for a cheap price.The faint fragrance on Tang Ya\u2019s body caused Huo Yuhao\u2019s face to immediately turn red. He didn\u2019t dare to move at all, he just stood there innocently.It was Bei Bei who again helped him out of this embarrassing situation, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya.\u201dOnly now did Tang Ya loosen her embrace on Huo Yuhao\u2019s arm. She smiled at him, and looking at her appearance, she was extremely pleased. Obviously, though she absolutely wouldn\u2019t admit it, the very first reason that she\u2019d wanted Huo Yuhao to join the Tang Sect was because of the excessively delicious roasted fish that he made\u2026\u201cLittle Yuhao, you should formally become my apprentice now. Our Tang Sect only has three people as of now, and we don\u2019t have that many rules. Once you become my apprentice and call me your teacher, you\u2019ll be a member of our Tang Sect in the future.\u201d Tang Ya said firmly.Huo Yuhao nodded and kneeled down in front of Tang Ya with a \u2018putong\u2019 sound. He then paid his respects to her, \u201cDisciple Huo Yuhao greets teacher.\u201dTang Ya stood there, unmoving. After letting him pay his respects three times, she helped him up.Note: Paying his respects, for those that don\u2019t know, means knocking his head to the ground.\u201cVery good, Yuhao. In the future, you\u2019re teacher\u2019s second disciple. Acknowledge your eldest senior brother.\u201d As she spoke, she pointed towards Bei Bei.\u201cI acknowledge eldest senior brother.\u201d Huo Yuhao bowed again, this time towards Bei Bei.Bei Bei smiled slightly and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite, junior brother. We\u2019ll be family in the future.\u201dTang Ya seemed to relax as she said, \u201cYuhao, you should be like Bei Bei, and refer to me as Teacher Xiao Ya in the future. However, don\u2019t learn to be as cheeky as him, understand?\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d After paying his respects, Huo Yuhao had clearly become slightly reserved. However, the blankness in his heart had stabilised a lot. Joining the Tang Sect had caused a sense of security to imperceptibly appear in his heart. This feeling hadn\u2019t appeared in his heart in a very long time.Xiao Ya flipped her wrist over, and pulled out a book from somewhere. She then passed it to Huo Yuhao, \u201cLittle Yuhao, this is a copy of our Tang Sect\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record; our Tang Sect\u2019s secret techniques are recorded inside. Out of them, the Mysterious Heaven Technique is the foundation to all of the other techniques contained within. If you use it to meditate, it will definitely increase your cultivation speed. Your cultivation is still shallow, so changing your cultivation technique to the Mysterious Heaven Technique won\u2019t have any side effects. Later on, Bei Bei and I will guide you in cultivation. Besides the Mysterious Heaven Technique, the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record also has five more secret techniques. They are, respectively: Mysterious Jade Hands, which is for training one\u2019s hands; Purple Demon Eyes, which is for train one\u2019s eyes; Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, which is a capturing technique; Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks, which is a speed-type technique, and Hidden Weapon Hundred Separation, which is a method to use hidden weapons. The most famous techniques of our Tang Sect involve our hidden weapons, but you need to establish a good foundation before you can cultivate in them. What you need to do now is begin cultivating in the first five secret techniques. In the future, I\u2019ll teach you how to use hidden weapons.\u201d\u201cEarlier, when I said that our Tang Sect had a secret technique that\u2019d be especially suitable for you, I was referring to the Purple Demon Eyes. The Purple Demon Eyes is a technique to train one\u2019s eyes, and you\u2019ll be able to release an extremely strong spiritual attack after cultivating it to a certain degree. Since your martial soul is the Spirit Eyes, there shouldn\u2019t be a more suitable technique for you than this. You should train in this technique as much as possible.\u201dAfter receiving the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record that Tang Ya had handed him, Huo Yuhao carefully placed it into the folds of his shirt, \u201cThanks, teacher. I\u2019ll definitely put in a lot of effort to cultivate these techniques.\u201dBei Bei tapped his belt, causing a belt that was black, and embedded with round white jades, to appear in his hands.\u201cJunior brother, I\u2019ll give you this imitation of the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges that our Ancestor Tang San once had. Just take it as a meeting present from your eldest senior brother. With it, carrying a few items on you will be much more convenient.\u201dWhilst speaking, Bei Bei fastened the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges belt onto Huo Yuhao\u2019s waist, and told him how to use it. As it turned out, the twenty four embedded jades on the belt each had a half-metre wide space that could be used to store various objects. Huo Yuhao only needed to guide his soulforce into the belt to be able to use it. It was a relatively precious soul tool.Huo Yuhao\u2019s poor talent was reflected by the state of his body, but he was extremely smart. After a few tries, he managed to easily control the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. However, a lot of his soulforce had been drained while he was learning to control it.Tang Ya said, \u201cLittle Yuhao, the reason why I followed your eldest senior brother out here was the same as yours; it was to kill a soul beast for its soul ring. Follow us, I\u2019ll take you back to Shrek Academy once I\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cYes, Teacher.\u201d Huo Yuhao hurriedly gave a respectful reply.Tang Ya giggled and said, \u201cAlthough you\u2019ve already taken me as your master, you don\u2019t have to be so reserved. Since the Tang Sect only has us three, what\u2019s the point of us being so old-fashioned?\u201dBei Bei unhappily said, \u201cWith a teacher like you, it\u2019d be a wonder if your disciples were able to be reserved. It\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s hurry up. Hopefully our luck will be better, and we\u2019ll be able to find and kill a suitable soul beast on the outskirts of the Great Star Dou Forest.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Tang Ya nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dTang Ya walked in front, while Bei Bei remained behind, pulling Huo Yuhao along by the hand. The three of them sped up simultaneously, and rushed towards the Great Star Dou Forest.After obtaining his first soul ring, Huo Yuhao clearly felt that his own cultivation had risen greatly. This was especially so for his body, allowing him to be much more relaxed during the journey. However, his speed was still greatly different compared to Tang Ya and Bei Bei\u2019s. A gentle flow of soulforce flowed out from Bei Bei\u2019s hand into his, practically carrying him along on their journey. On the other hand, Huo Yuhao himself didn\u2019t need to expend much strength.While they ran, Bei Bei spoke to Huo Yuhao, \u201cJunior brother, our Tang Sect\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Technique is presently one of the continent\u2019s best cultivation techniques. As long as you cultivate it diligently, you\u2019ll definitely reap some benefits. I\u2019ll tell you the tricks needed to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique. You must remember them.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Huo Yuhao nodded his head, and listened to Bei Bei\u2019s explanation seriously.Not only was Bei Bei\u2019s outward appearance scholarly, he also had an extremely gentle and meticulous temperament. When he explained the Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s cultivation technique to Huo Yuhao, he patiently explained all of the particulars of the technique in detail. When they came across an area that Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t understand, he would give an explanation that was both easy and simple to understand, which caused Huo Yuhao to quickly become immersed in the fantastic technique.Tang Ya, who was walking in front, couldn\u2019t help but stick her tongue out, because she was completely certain that she\u2019d be unable to explain things as orderly as Bei Bei was, if she were the one to teach Huo Yuhao. As the sect master of the Tang Sect, she herself was truly unqualified as a teacher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Almost two hours unknowingly passed.The large road had already disappeared, and their surroundings were now filled with dense forest. The air had turned fresher and cleaner, but there seemed to be a faint serious aura emitted from the depths of the forest.\u201cThis is the general method used to cultivate this technique. As for the specifics, you\u2019ll have to slowly get a feel for them after trying it out for yourself. If you have anything that you don\u2019t understand, you can ask me.\u201d Bei Bei said to Huo Yuhao.\u201cThanks, eldest senior brother.\u201d Huo Yuhao\u2019s admiration towards Bei Bei had continuously risen while Bei Bei had been explaining everything to him; naturally, his respect for Bei Bei had grown as well.At this moment, Tang Ya, who\u2019d been walking in front, suddenly let out a cold snort. Her footsteps suddenly turned illusory, and her body instantly turned into consecutive afterimages as she pounced towards a large tree on the group\u2019s right. The only thing that Huo Yuhao could faintly see was a few cold lights that flickered outwards. A Wind Baboon, similar to the one that had almost killed him previously, fell from a treetop.Xiao Ya unhappily said, \u201cThese Wind Baboons are simply the most detestable creatures. Not only do they take the initiative to attack, they even launch sneak attacks.\u201dHuo Yuhao hadn\u2019t used his Spirit Eyes earlier, so he was entirely unable to see how Xiao Ya had moved, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, did you use a soul skill just now?\u201dXiao Ya was slightly proud of herself as she replied, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a soul skill, but the synergy of our Tang Sect\u2019s Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks and hidden weapons. Wasn\u2019t it awesome? If you cultivate properly, you\u2019ll also be able to use them together in the future.\u201d\u201cXiao Ya, careful.\u201d Bei Bei\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He suddenly raised his right hand and made an illusory grabbing movement towards Tang Ya. Clearly, they\u2019d worked together frequently, as Tang Ya\u2019s toes tapped the ground lightly, and her body flew up. She seemed to be weightless as she was pulled over by the absorption force exerted on her by Bei Bei\u2019s hand.A pitch black shadow instantly fell to the ground and let out a light noise. Following that, a strong sweet smell assaulted the senses of everyone present.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind felt dizzy, but a wave of icy air instantly surged through his body, sealing his mouth and nose. An icy mist flew slightly outwards from Huo Yuhao\u2019s mouth and nose, causing the sweet-smelling poison gas that he\u2019d previously inhaled to be dispersed into the air.An ice attribute? My second martial soul? Huo Yuhao immediately questioned the stream of icy air\u2019s origins. However, he clearly hadn\u2019t controlled it.Just as he was beginning to feel pleased because of his second martial soul\u2019s effects, Tang Ya had been pulled closer by the absorption force of Bei Bei\u2019s hand. She used her right hand to press against Bei Bei\u2019s shoulder, causing her delicate body to curl up and then flip around in midair to land behind Bei Bei.Two light rings simultaneously rose up from Tang Ya\u2019s legs, the bright yellow colours moving up and down in a rhythmical manner. Her two soul rings were unexpectedly of the hundred-year rank.In that instant, long blue vines were rapidly released from Tang Ya\u2019s body. One of them just so happened to wrap around Huo Yuhao\u2019s waist, while even more dispersed into the distance.However, compared to Tang Ya, Bei Bei, who was standing in front, shocked Huo Yuhao even more.Up to this point, in his mind, this eldest senior brother of his was a gentle, scholarly person. He always wore a gentle smile when he was beside Tang Ya, and had an extremely approachable feel. However, at this moment, he\u2019d changed into a completely different person.When Xiao Ya had jumped over his head, a dazzling blue light had shone from in-between Bei Bei\u2019s eyebrows. Following that, the blue light instantly expanded outwards from his eyebrows, and spread to his entire body. The fierce blue light resembled several small snakes as they exploded out, surrounding and moving all over his body. Except for the blue lightning symbol that had appeared on his forehead, only a single change had appeared on his body due to his martial spirit.However, just this one, simple change caused Huo Yuhao to have a completely new understanding towards Soul Masters.The part of his body that had changed was his right arm. His right sleeve had turned completely into ash due to the expansion of his right arm, which had suddenly increased in length by more than half a foot. His entire arm had become extremely thick, and was now covered in violet-blue scales. His hand had turned into a claw that was also covered with the same scales, while every joint in his hand had become extremely thick. The violet-blue lightning that circled his body gathered and separated unceasingly. However, his soul rings, two of which were yellow and one of which was purple, weren\u2019t like those of an Soul Masters; they didn\u2019t circled around his his right arm instead of his entire body, the place where the unusual changes had appeared.These three rings signified that he was a Soul Elder. His eldest senior brother, who was only four to five years older than him, was unexpectedly already a Soul Elder-level expert, who was already above the rank of thirty! Furthermore, his soul rings were two hundred-year ones and a thousand-year one, which was the best possible combination.For soul rings, white represented a ten-year soul ring, yellow represented a hundred years soul ring, purple represented a thousand year soul ring, and black represented something even higher, a ten thousand year soul ring. Besides these, if the mighty hundred thousand year soul beasts, such as the ones who\u2019d persecuted the Skydream Iceworm, were turned into soul rings, they\u2019d be red in colour.Huo Yuhao had already asked them their ages. Bei Bei and Tang Ya were both the same age\u2014fifteen. However, Bei Bei was slightly older, if you looked at the month that they were born in. Considering the fact that he\u2019d reached the Soul Elder realm at such an age, and that he had three soul rings of this level, using the words \u2018heaven\u2019s chosen\u2019 to describe Bei Bei couldn\u2019t be any more suitable. If you looked at their cultivations, he\u2019d clearly surpassed Tang Ya, who was only a Soul Grandmaster that was above rank twenty, despite being his master.\u201cGua, gua\u2026\u201d After letting out this strange cry, the shadow that had landed on the ground instantly shot out, pouncing towards Bei Bei.Bei Bei snorted coldly, and a layer of purple light appeared in his eyes. He placed his thick right arm in front of him horizontally, causing a web of lightning to immediately cover the space in front of him, which prevented the shadow from passing.\u201cKa la\u2014\u201d Under the rumbling sound of lightning, the shadow rebounded backwards, while Bei Bei staggered three or four steps back at the same time. The expression on his face changed slightly; Clearly, his opponent\u2019s strength had surpassed his prediction.\u201cIt\u2019s a Mandala Snake! Wah, it\u2019s a thousand-year one too, this is too good! Bei Bei, I want this one.\u201d Tang Ya wasn\u2019t astonished, but instead happy as her lovable voice let out a loud cry.At this moment, Huo Yuhao had also clearly seen the shadow that had ambushed them. It was a three-metre-long snake, whose entire body was pink. There was also a small protrusion on its forehead that faintly resembled a flower.Bei Bei clearly didn\u2019t share Tang Ya\u2019s excitement, and instead had a serious expression on his face. Although he was already a Soul Elder-level expert, it was still hard for him to easily achieve victory over a thousand-year soul beast. However, the reason that it was possible for him to do so in the first place was because of his sufficiently strong martial spirit. If an ordinary Soul Elder were to see a thousand-year soul beast, the only thing that they could do was turn around and run.\u201cXiao Ya, take care of Yuhao.\u201d Bei Bei let out a low roar, causing the first soul rings on his right arm to flicker. Under the strong undulations of his soulforce, a foot-long violet-blue dragon claw condensed and shot out towards the Mandala Snake.This was Thunderous Dragon Claw, Bei Bei\u2019s first soul skill.However, the Mandala Snake was extremely crafty. It had previously been entrenched in the ground, but it suddenly shot into midair the moment that Bei Bei\u2019s attack activated. Its long tail suddenly whipped about in midair, immediately resembling a pink-coloured shadow as it pounced towards Bei Bei.Bei Bei didn\u2019t retreat, but instead advanced. He instantly leaned his body downwards, while using the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks to flash forward. The lightning dragon claw that had already flown out unexpectedly turned around in midair to pursue the Mandala Snake from behind. At the same time, his second soul ring lit up. Countless snakes of lightning suddenly expanded simultaneously, turning into lightning arrows that flashed through the air, forming a dense, thunderous web that tried to envelop the Mandala Snake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 4.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4.3: \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019 Bei BeiThe previous Thunderous Dragon Claw had only been used to make the Mandala Snake move, while the net formed from Bei Bei\u2019s second soul skill, Vigorous Thunderbolt, was the true trap. As long as the Mandala Snake was trapped by the net of lightning, the Thunderous Dragon Claw could catch up to it from behind. Even if the Mandala Snake wasn\u2019t severely wounded, it would at least give Bei Bei a decisive opportunity.However, a thousand-year soul beast\u2019s strength was absolutely not that simple. As the lightning web closed in on the Mandala Snake, it spat out a pink mist from its mouth, which caused a smell ten times sweeter than earlier to spread out.Tang Ya took Huo Yuhao with her as she rapidly retreated, for fear that they would both would be affected by the mist. This was also the first time that worry had appeared on her charming face.When the lightning arrows formed from the Vigorous Thunderbolt skill were sprayed by that pink mist, it was as if they\u2019d been submerged; their might was still present, but it had instantly become fragmented.The Mandala Snake displayed its valiant side at this moment. Its body suddenly straightened out in midair, and it proceeded to powerfully smash through the lightning web. It had unexpectedly managed to open a gap in the web made by Vigorous Thunderbolt. When it flew out from the web, it swung its tail, causing the pink light at the tip of its tail to brighten. It then whipped the Thunderous Dragon Claw behind it, loudly shattering Bei Bei\u2019s first soul skill.However, Bei Bei\u2019s attacks weren\u2019t completely useless. As someone who had one of the strongest beast souls, his attack power was at the peak of soul masters at the same rank as him. Although the Mandala Snake was valiant, a fine layer of lightning had appeared on its body after it had consecutively broken through two of Bei Bei\u2019s soul skills. When it landed on the ground, it was unable to continue releasing attacks.At the same time, Bei Bei didn\u2019t proceed to launch anymore attacks. He didn\u2019t dare to inhale the toxic pink mist that had spread out into the air either. As he rapidly retreated, a porcelain bottle appeared in his hand. After dumping a pill out for himself, he threw the bottle towards Tang Ya.Tang Ya grabbed the porcelain bottle and immediately dumped out two pills. She ate one pill, and shoved the other into Huo Yuhao\u2019s mouth.\u201cBei Bei, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d While chewing the pill, Tang Ya said.Bei Bei shook his head and replied, \u201cThis fellow is very troublesome, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll have to plan on a battle of attrition. There\u2019s a very high possibility of soul beasts appearing in the surroundings, so you should be careful. I\u2019ll take him on alone. Also, take care of Yuhao.\u201dThis was the second time that Bei Bei had reminded Tang Ya to take care of Huo Yuhao, which caused a warm feeling to surge through his heart. Throughout his entire life, Bei Bei was the first person other than his mother to treat him this well. Due to this, he couldn\u2019t help but be moved.I want to help eldest senior brother; I\u2019m not trash.Huo Yuhao rapidly poured his soulforce into his Spirit Eyes, and the soul skills that he\u2019d just obtained immediately flashed through his mind.A faint golden light appeared in his deep blue eyes once again, and his jade-white soul ring started to rise up from his feet.If you looked at them just from the surface, you couldn\u2019t see any signs of anything happening. However, the next moment, both Bei Bei and Tang Ya\u2019s bodies simultaneously shook, an astonished look appearing in their eyes.From their point of view, time seemed to have slowed down. Everything around them had become exceptionally clear, and a large amount of information instantly appeared inside of their minds wherever they looked. When Bei Bei looked attentively at the Mandala Snake, the distance between him and the snake appeared in his mind; even the minute changes in strength from every one of its muscle appeared in his mind. All of the subtleties and minute details had appeared clearly in the depths of his mind.Not only that, but they didn\u2019t even need to use their eyes to see anything in a thirty metre radius around them. All of their surroundings had appeared inside of their minds as three-dimensional shapes. Furthermore, any subtle changes that occurred would immediately be reflected in their minds.This was\u2026No matter whether it was Bei Bei or Tang Ya, they both immediately thought of Huo Yuhao. Was this Huo Yuhao\u2019s first soul skill? Why could it be so mystical? With the assistance of a detection ability like this, facing any opponent would be far, far, too effortless\u2014especially with an opponent like the Mandala Snake, which was a soul beast specialised in speed. For a person like Bei Bei who had sufficient attack power, there wasn\u2019t anything else that could be as helpful as an ability to predict his opponent\u2019s movements and seize a key opportunity.This ten-year soul ring\u2019s skill was actually so strong? Its auxiliary ability was this outstanding? Sure enough, it deserved its name as a rarely seen mutated spiritual-attribute martial soul!Huo Yuhao naturally didn\u2019t know that both Bei Bei and Tang Ya had credited the mysticality of the skill that he was currently using on his mutated martial soul. However, in reality, he wasn\u2019t using one soul skill, but two.The two skills that he was using were the first skill that the million-year soul ring had given him, Spiritual Detection, combined with the second skill, Spiritual Sharing.These two skills were auxiliary-type skills, and this was the first time that Huo Yuhao had used them. Although he hadn\u2019t been able to completely comprehend the subtleties behind the two skills, he was still able to exhibit most of their enormous effects.With the current strength of his body, the might of the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s soul rings were roughly equivalent to that of a four hundred year soul beast\u2019s. Because of this, the range of his Spiritual Detection and Spiritual Sharing was roughly thirty metres. However, with his current power, the maximum number of people that he could simultaneously share his Spiritual Detection ability with was three. His strength wouldn\u2019t be enough if there were more people.His soulforce consumption while using these two skills wasn\u2019t great, but Huo Yuhao had to use a certain amount of spiritual power too. It could be said that he was using both spiritual power and soulforce to jointly support these two skills. With his current level of cultivation, lasting at least an hour wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. The exact amount of time that he could last could only be discovered later on, through testing.A low rumble suddenly reverberated from Bei Bei\u2019s body. His whole body emitted strong, violet-blue lightning, and the scales on his right arm rapidly spread outwards towards his body, encasing the right part of his chest within them. This caused the aura released from his body to instantly rise abruptly. His third soul ring, the purple one, also released a dazzling radiance at this moment.This was the skill from his thousand-year soul ring, \u2018Thunderous Fury\u2019.As a person who possessed a beast soul with the strongest attack power, his third soul skill, \u2018Thunderous Fury\u2019, was capable of instantly raising the effects of Bei Bei\u2019s soulforce attacks by more than fifty percent. Furthermore, the strength of his lightning attribute had also doubled. Although this wasn\u2019t a direct attack skill, it still managed to increase Bei Bei\u2019s condition to an extraordinarily strong realm. Even some four-ringed Soul Ancestor experts wouldn\u2019t be his match if they had weaker martial spirits.Although Bei Bei wasn\u2019t that old, his amount of combat experience was extremely plentiful. After obtaining the support of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection and Spiritual Sharing, he knew that his chance had come. Since he couldn\u2019t be sure of how long Huo Yuhao could maintain this state, he immediately decided to use all of his strength at once by releasing his strongest ability.A violet-blue lightning bolt curled around the dragon claw that his right hand had turned into, and a Thunderous Dragon Claw about twice the size of the previous one appeared around his hand. However, Bei Bei didn\u2019t directly release it this time. Instead, his body flashed as he pounced towards the thousand-year Mandala Snake.The Mandala Snake was also crafty. Its thousand years of cultivation had caused it to possess a certain amount of intelligence. The aura released from Bei Bei\u2019s body had already caused it to feel a considerably high level of danger. Since itself unable to harm its opponent anymore, it suddenly spat out a mouthful of toxic mist towards Bei Bei, before turning around to run away.\u201cHumph!\u201d Bei Bei snorted coldly, and the light in his eyes suddenly turned slightly profound. A layer of fragmented lightning suddenly burst outwards from his body, forcibly dispersing the toxic mist. At the same time, the Thunderous Dragon Claw in his right hand shot out towards the space diagonally to the left of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reason that Bei Bei could predict his opponent\u2019s movements and strike first was because of the Spiritual Detection that Huo Yuhao had shared with him. When the Mandala Snake sprung forwards, it fled diagonally to the left in front of Bei Bei. However, at this moment, an enormous absorption force appeared in the path that it had taken in order to escape, and it was almost as if it had simply delivered itself right into Bei Bei\u2019s hands. Once the enormous absorption force caught the Mandala Snake, its forward momentum was immediately dissolved, and it was sucked towards Bei Bei.With the threat of life and death looming over its head, the Mandala Snake immediately exploded out with power. A fierce pink light immediately shone from the top of its head, and it let out several sharp hisses. The flower-like protrusion on the top of its head suddenly exploded, and an arrow made of pink blood flew straight at Bei Bei.However, Bei Bei had already responded to this in advance. The instant before the flower-like protrusion exploded, the Thunderous Dragon Claw on his right arm had already launched a fierce attack. It landed on the body of the Mandala Snake in the same instant that the protrusion exploded.The arrow made of pink blood had only flown several inches before it was swept away by the explosion. However, Bei Bei felt cold sweat form. The Thunderous Dragon Claw that he\u2019d released had actually turned pink when it touched the pink blood. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was able to predict his opponent\u2019s movements, and seize a decisive opportunity, it might\u2019ve been very troublesome for him if he\u2019d been infected by that blood arrow.Bei Bei\u2019s figure flashed as he instantly charged forward. This time, the thousand-year Mandala Snake had no countermeasures left. It was accurately grabbed by Bei Bei\u2019s right claw when it was only seven inches away from him. It still attempted to use its body to wrap around Bei Bei\u2019s, but directly lost consciousness after being struck by the terrifying lightning from Bei Bei\u2019s Vigorous Thunderbolt.The thousand-year Mandala Snake was widely known for its tyrannical body and its lightning-like speed. However, once it fell into the hands of Bei Bei, who possessed an extraordinarily powerful martial spirit, its defensive power wasn\u2019t worth mentioning at all. Under the state of Thunderous Fury, Bei Bei\u2019s dragon claw let out a fierce blow, partially crushing its head. Its bones seemed as if they could be crushed at any time.\u201cXiao Ya.\u201d Bei Bei let out a low roar.Tang Ya naturally wouldn\u2019t let go of such a good opportunity. Carrying Huo Yuhao, she rapidly approached the Mandala Snake. A half-foot long throwing knife appeared in her hand, which she then flung directly into the Mandala Snake\u2019s mouth that Bei Bei had pinched open, ending the life of the thousand-year Mandala Snake.The violet-blue light from his lightning vanished as Bei Bei finally relaxed, while a purple soul ring slowly condensed and formed above the Mandala Snake\u2019s head.Tang Ya looked towards Bei Bei with an excited expression, and Bei Bei nodded back at her, \u201cQuickly start. I didn\u2019t think that we\u2019d meet a thousand-year soul beast at the edge of the Great Star Dou Forest. The quality of soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest has really increased.\u201dTang Ya giggled and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that it\u2019d go this smoothly. Protect me.\u201d Whilst speaking, she rapidly sat down in a cross-legged position beside the Mandala Snake. A blue, gem-like luster shone in her right hand, and she slowly raised her empty hands. After gently tapping the purple soul ring above the Mandala Snake, it was immediately sucked into the blue light in her hand. Then, it merged with her body.The smile on Tang Ya\u2019s face suddenly vanished as she began to concentrate on absorbing the soul ring. Only now did Huo Yuhao realize that Tang Ya had already reached the bottleneck of the thirtieth rank. The reason why she and Bei Bei had come to the Great Star Dou Forest must\u2019ve been to look for a suitable third soul ring for her. Only, what was Teacher Xiao Ya\u2019s martial soul? A blue vine?\u201cXiao Ya\u2019s martial soul is Bluesilver Grass.\u201d Bei Bei said gently, as if he\u2019d seen through the doubt in Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart.Huo Yuhao was astonished as he replied, \u201cThe Bluesilver Grass? The same martial soul as the person in the Tang Sect\u2019s legends?\u201dBei Bei nodded his head and said, \u201cTen thousand years ago, the first generation sect master of the Tang Sect relied on his Bluesilver Grass martial soul to forge the Tang Sect\u2019s glory. Afterwards, he became a God and left. However, he didn\u2019t leave any descendants in the Tang Sect. For the sake of remembering him, the later generations of the Tang Sect stubbornly glorified Bluesilver Grass when choosing the next sect master. In addition to that, the Tang Sect would put much more effort into nurturing Soul Masters who possessed Bluesilver Grass. Unfortunately, the facts have proven themselves. Bluesilver Grass isn\u2019t something that just anyone can unleash great power with. Ever since the almighty legend of the Tang Sect left, the Tang Sect hasn\u2019t had any more experts with Bluesilver Grass that were able to stand at the pinnacle of the continent. However, this tradition has continued to be passed down, and nobody can change it. Xiao Ya\u2019s innate talent to use her Bluesilver Grass is already rather good, so I hope that she can make some sort of a breakthrough.Huo Yuhao was slightly curious as he asked, \u201cEldest senior brother, if that year\u2019s Tang Sect was truly as strong as the legends say, why did it head down the road of decline?\u201dBei Bei smiled slightly and replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll gradually understand the answer to this question once you arrive at Shrek Academy. There were many internal and external problems. Currently, the only people left in the Tang Sect are the few of us, but in fact, this isn\u2019t a bad thing at all. At the very least, it\u2019ll be very hard to use certain restrictions on us. On the contrary, junior brother, you\u2019ve truly given me a great surprise!\u201dHuo Yuhao naturally understood that Bei Bei was referring to the soul skills that he\u2019d just used. He couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head in embarrassment. \u201cI was just trying to use it, it\u2019s good that it was a bit helpful.\u201dBei Bei firmly said, \u201cHow could that only be considered \u2018a bit\u2019 helpful? I don\u2019t normally have the assurance to face a thousand-year soul beast. If it weren\u2019t for that fantastic assistance from your spiritual power, it would\u2019ve been very hard for me to escape in one piece.\u201dPreviously, when his confrontation with the Mandala Snake had reached its last crucial point, he\u2019d relied on Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection skill to help him accurately predict the Mandala Snake\u2019s every movement. Not only that, but the most important moment was when the Mandala Snake had detonated its crown.The moment before it happened, Bei Bei had clearly felt a kind of bright feeling surround the Mandala Snake\u2019s crown within the Spiritual Detection world. He hadn\u2019t been able to see it with his eyes at all. This all came from the feeling that he\u2019d felt from the three-dimensional world of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection. Because of this, he\u2019d been able to near-instantly react subconsciously. If not, he might not have been able to retreat in one piece if the toxic blood had polluted him.This also made Bei Bei aware of how enormous of a role Huo Yuhao\u2019s skill had had during the battle. He made a conservative estimation; if he had the assistance of Huo Yuhao\u2019s skill during a fight with an opponent, his overall strength would be increased by twenty to thirty percent minimum. This was a phenomenal increase! Furthermore, this was only Huo Yuhao\u2019s first soul skill.Huo Yuhao still had some lingering fear in his heart as he said, \u201cThat snake was truly too fierce. Eldest senior brother, what soul beast was it\u201dBei Bei replied, \u201cIt\u2019s called a Mandala Snake, and its toxicity is extremely strong. Not only does it have a numbing effect, it also has a strong destructive effect towards one\u2019s mental state. It was one of the most terrifying existences amongst poison-type soul beasts. Its body was extremely tough, and ordinary blades will have difficulty wounding it. Its only weaknesses are its mouth and eyes. However, the Mandala Snake will always protect these two exrtemely well. Furthermore, its speed is incomparably quick. However, the most terrifying part of this snake is its attack. Once it clearly identifies its opponent, it rarely gives up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before they reach a thousand years of age, their bodies will have a dark green colour, and they\u2019ll grow a metre longer for every hundred years they live. By the time they\u2019re approaching the thousand-year level, their bodies can be as long as ten metres in length. Once they break through, the energy inside of their bodies will condense, and they\u2019ll continuously molt. Not only will the colour of their bodies change from dark green to pink, their bodies will also simultaneously shrink back down to one metre. Afterwards, they\u2019ll grow another metre every hundred years. After reaching two thousand years of age, they\u2019ll once again shrink back down to one metre. However, the pink colour of their skin will become deeper. If we look at the colour and length of this Mandala Snake, we can see that it should\u2019ve been over one thousand three hundred years old. If it weren\u2019t for your help, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019d\u2019ve had to suffer a bit to kill it.\u201dNaturally, Bei Bei didn\u2019t say that it actually wouldn\u2019t have been too hard for him and Tang Ya to team up and kill the Mandala Snake\u2014if Huo Yuhao hadn\u2019t been there.After listening to Bei Bei\u2019s explanation, Huo Yuhao\u2019s knowledge grew. \u201cThis Mandala Snake is actually that mysterious. Then, would it perhaps shed again, once it\u2019s reached ten thousand years in age?\u201dBei Bei nodded and replied, \u201cA ten thousand year Mandala Snake will turn yellow. That would be a truly terrifying existence. Even Soul King experts won\u2019t dare to rashly provoke a ten thousand year Mandala Snake if they encounter one. You\u2019d need a Soul Emperor, at the very least, to be able to beat it easily.\u201cJunior brother, since Xiao Ya is currently absorbing her soul ring, tell me about your soul skill. What\u2019s the name of the soul skill that you just used, and how long can you maintain it for? This is very important information.\u201dHuo Yuhao had previously heard the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s reminder, and knew that he couldn\u2019t let him be revealed. After pondering about it for a little while, he said, \u201cEldest senior brother, the skill that I just used is called \u2018Spiritual Detection Sharing\u2019. You should have been able to sense its range: it can only currently be of help within a roughly thirty metre radius. When my soulforce increases, its radius should also increase. I don\u2019t know how long I can maintain it, but I feel that its soulforce consumption doesn\u2019t seem to be too large.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Bei Bei looked at him, flabbergasted. \u201cThe soulforce consumption of a skill that has such an enormous effect like yours \u2018doesn\u2019t seem to be too large\u2019? Your Spirit Eyes seem to be too strong. Furthermore, your soul ring was only obtained from a ten year Wind Baboon! This is almost too impossible to believe. The soul masters of the Douluo Continent have researched martial souls for over ten thousand years, but there\u2019s never been a situation like yours recorded within any of the books I\u2019ve read. This is truly hard to imagine.\u201dHuo Yuhao lowered his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on either.\u201dAfter Bei Bei pondered the matter himself for a while, he revealed a smile and said, \u201cJunior brother, you don\u2019t need to think too deeply about it; a strong soul skill is always a good thing. With the support of this soul skill, I\u2019m afraid that any soul master will be willing to work with you in the future. However, junior brother, you\u2019re a spiritual-type soul master. In the future, do you plan to walk the path of an auxiliary system soul master, or a control system soul master?\u201dHuo Yuhao was stunned for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201dBei Bei said, \u201cChoosing the path your cultivation will take is very important. This directly relates to the the soul skills that you\u2019ll choose for your future soul rings, as well as the direction of your cultivation. Although you, a spiritual-type soul master, have only just obtained your first soul ring, you\u2019ve already revealed your martial soul\u2019s strong potential. If you become a simple auxiliary system soul master, I feel that it would be a bit of a waste. Although I don\u2019t know what kind of spiritual soul skills you\u2019ll manage obtain in the future, I\u2019m inclined towards making you become a control system soul master. You\u2019ll have to put in a lot of time and energy into your spiritual control, but if everything goes smoothly, you might become the core of your team in the future.\u201d\u201cA team? Do soul masters have to join a team?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked curiously. Since his youth, he\u2019d always relied on himself for cultivation, and had had to experience everything for himself. No one but his mother had ever taught him anything. Now that he\u2019d joined the Tang Sect, in his opinion, his eldest senior brother had become more important than a teacher. It had only been a short period of time, but Bei Bei had taught him many things.Bei Bei patiently explained, \u201cOur profession as soul masters has developed quite a bit after so many years, but the idea of forming a team was entirely created by the almighty founder of our Tang Sect, ten thousand years ago. At that time, he and his companions were called \u2018Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters\u2019. The seven of them all had formidable abilities, and could release an even stronger fighting strength when they worked together. From then on, cooperation between soul masters became the only path for their development. After all, the strength of an individual is miniscule. For example, your cooperation with me just now. It allowed me to be much more relaxed during the battle. Xiao Ya and I also have some combination tactics. Conversely, the number of soul masters within a team normally shouldn\u2019t surpass ten. Out of that team, there would be a battle-type soul master who\u2019s responsible for defense, an assault system soul master who\u2019s responsible for attacks, and a control system soul master who both commands and controls the battlefield. There are also auxiliary system tool-type soul masters, auxiliary system food-type soul masters, agility system soul masters, along with many other types of soul masters. They all have different uses in a team.\u201dHuo Yuhao seemed to have suddenly understood something as he said, \u201cThen, is eldest senior brother an assault system soul master?\u201dBei Bei smiled as he nodded and said, \u201cMy martial soul is the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon; It\u2019s considered a rather strong martial soul amongst beast souls. It specialises in attacks. On the other hand, Xiao Ya\u2019s martial soul is Bluesilver Grass, which will allow her to become a control system soul master like the almighty ancestor of the Tang Sect from the legends. However, her controlling abilities mostly appear within the Bluesilver Grass. If you can also become a control system soul master, we can rely on the combination of your spiritual controlling abilities and Xiao Ya\u2019s Bluesilver Grass. With two control system soul masters, we won\u2019t even need an auxiliary system tool-type soul master to be able to form a strong team.\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded seriously, \u201cEldest senior brother, I\u2019ll listen to your advice. Then, I\u2019ll work hard to become a control system soul master. Only, my natural talent isn\u2019t too good\u2026 My cultivation speed is very slow\u2026\u201d After speaking to this point, he couldn\u2019t help but lower his head. When he compared himself, who was already eleven but only had one ring, to Bei Bei or Tang Ya, his talent was quite disappointing.Bei Bei rubbed Huo Yuhao\u2019s head and smiled. \u201cTalent is only one part of success. In the past, there weren\u2019t always people who could guide you on your cultivation path. Add on to that the fact that you didn\u2019t have a suitable cultivation technique, and it\u2019s already very commendable that you have been able to reach your current situation with hard work alone. Furthermore, your martial soul in and of itself is pretty good, which means that your potential in the future will be very great. Thus, you don\u2019t have to be so remorseful. Since you have the time right now, it\u2019d be better for you to cultivate more. As long as you\u2019re able to break through to the thirtieth rank before the age of twenty, you\u2019ll have hopes of becoming a strong soul master. No matter whether it\u2019s me or Xiao Ya, we\u2019ll both do our best to help you.\u201d\u201cThank you, eldest senior brother.\u201d Only a touched expression remained on Huo Yuhao\u2019s face.Bei Bei gently pat his shoulder. \u201cMeeting you might also be Xiao Ya and I\u2019s good fortune, since we were able to resolve the issue of her advancement in rank so quickly. After she finishes absorbing her soul ring, we can return to the academy. This place isn\u2019t particularly suitable for cultivation. You can recall the Mysterious Heaven Technique that I told you about earlier right now, and can start cultivating it once we\u2019ve reached a safe area.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Huo Yuhao replied respectfully. In his heart, Bei Bei had already become slightly more of a teacher to him than Tang Ya.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 5.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5.2: First Glimpse Through The Gate\u201cOh, right, junior brother. Didn\u2019t you say that you were unclear about how long you could maintain your Spiritual Detection Sharing for? Why don\u2019t we experiment to see? This will relate to our future cooperation during battles, as well as let you understand your own ability, and familiarize you with your new skill.\u201dUnder Bei Bei\u2019s suggestion, Huo Yuhao released his Spiritual Detection Sharing once again. A faint golden light flickered out from his eyes, and a three-dimensional image that was thirty-metres in radius appeared inside of his and Bei Bei\u2019s minds.Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing was flawless, and was able to clearly differentiate any subtle changes within that thirty-metre radius.The more Bei Bei experienced it, the more astonished he became. This Spiritual Detection Sharing wasn\u2019t just an auxiliary detection skill, but was like another brain for him to make decisions with. Every minute detail within a radius of thirty metres had essentially been revealed, and there were absolutely no dead angles. While he was under this skill\u2019s effect, it was as if he had countless eyes that were observing the situation from various angles with the highest level of carefulness!The thing that made him even more astonished was that Huo Yuhao seemed to be extremely relaxed while he had this soul skill activated; he hadn\u2019t even shown any traces of exhaustion. While they shared the effects of his Spiritual Detection Sharing, they could even feel some of the changes occurring inside of Tang Ya\u2019s body as she merged with her soul ring.Tang Ya\u2019s figure seemed to have become even more slender, yet her aura was becoming richer and more powerful at an astonishing speed. There was also a luster that had appeared on her skin, while her qi and blood had become more exuberant.In the blink of an eye, fifteen minutes had passed, yet Huo Yuhao\u2019s face had only turned slightly pale.Bei Bei inwardly gasped with praise. A spiritual skill that lasted so long\u2014it was already enough to be used in battle. Furthermore, not only could Little Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing be used on the battlefield, it also had many other uses. For example, while they were on a dangerous adventure or hunting soul beasts, this was a rarely seen and extremely practical ability!Finally, after Huo Yuhao had maintained his skill for almost an hour, he was unable to persevere any longer. His body flashed as he ended his Spiritual Detection Sharing. He felt stabs of pain in his mind, and the strong sense of dizziness nearly caused him to fall down. He hurriedly sat down in a cross-legged position, and immediately started meditating to recover his lost soulforce and spiritual power.This wasn\u2019t the first time that Huo Yuhao had experienced bitter pain due to an overdraft of his spiritual power. The feeling of his mind becoming blank was definitely not a comfortable feeling.Bei Bei had been quietly observing him the entire time. When he saw that Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t collapse after his exhaustion of power, but rather tiredly sat down in a cross-legged position to meditate instead, a smile couldn\u2019t help but appear on his face. He silently nodded his head. Compared to seeing someone\u2019s talent, Bei Bei preferred to look at someone\u2019s temperament. In his mind, this junior brother of his had undoubtedly passed this test.The time needed for someone to absorb a thousand year soul ring was considerably long, so Bei Bei walked around their surroundings in order to spread out some medicine that could chase away soul beasts. Their luck was actually quite good; only a few ten-year and hundred-year soul beasts appeared as Tang Ya cultivated, but they were all chased away by Bei Bei. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t encounter any other existences at the level of a thousand year soul beast, so the process was more frightening than truly dangerous.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d After exhaling deeply, Tang Ya slowly opened her eyes, causing a radiant light to appear inside of her bright pupils. The energies in her body had all risen by an extremely large amount.Along the path of a soul master\u2019s cultivation, the thirtieth rank was an important threshold. Being able to cross this threshold allowed one to step into the Soul Elder realm. Reaching the Soul Elder realm signified that one was a true expert that had an immeasurable future. Many Soul Masters who had rather poor talent were unable to break through the bottleneck of the thirtieth rank, even after using up all of their life\u2019s energy.\u201cI succeeded.\u201d Tang Ya jumped up excitedly. Following the stimulation of her soulforce, two yellow soul rings and one purple soul ring rapidly rose up from her feet. The most eye-catching sight was naturally the thousand-year soul ring. The bright purple colour released an aura filled with grandeur; Tang Ya\u2019s strength had already entered a completely different level from this moment on.Bei Bei smiled as he said, \u201cXiao Ya, congratulations.\u201dTang Ya let out a cheerful cry as she suddenly pounced on Bei Bei, giving him a big hug. \u201cBei Bei, thank you.\u201dBei Bei hugged her delicate body, and a slightly doting look appeared within the smile on his face. \u201cSince I\u2019ve promised to help you achieve your dreams, I\u2019ll naturally do just that.\u201dAs Tang Ya rested in Bei Bei\u2019s embrace, she inadvertently saw a pair of large, astonished eyes looking at her, causing her to suddenly remember that there was another person present. She instantly broke free from Bei Bei\u2019s embrace, and looked at Huo Yuhao, whose Spirit Eyes were flickering, with a slightly embarrassed look as she said, \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at? Haven\u2019t you seen love between a teacher and a student before?\u201dHuo Yuhao answered with an extremely honest tone, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it before!\u201d When he saw Bei Bei and Tang Ya hugging each other, a indescribable sense of envy suddenly appeared in his heart. However, he wasn\u2019t jealous of them at all. His eldest senior brother and his teacher Xiao Ya were truly well matched with each other.Bei Bei coughed and said, \u201cAlright, since you\u2019ve already finished absorbing your soul ring, we should quickly leave this place. During the past few years, the number of accidents that have occurred to soul masters entering the Great Star Dou Forest have increased. Even the areas around the forest have existences such as thousand-year soul beasts, so it would be better for us to leave sooner rather than later.Tang Ya nodded her head and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAt this moment, the sky had already dimmed. However, spending the night in the Great Star Dou Forest clearly wasn\u2019t a good plan, so the three of them ignored their exhaustion as they rapidly ran towards the outside of the forest.Huo Yuhao, who\u2019d recovered his spiritual power, even activated his Spiritual Detection Sharing again, creating another level of safety for their journey towards the exit of the Great Star Dou Forest, so much so that they even managed to evade a thousand-year soul beast that wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to attack.After rapidly hurrying along for two hours, they managed to finally return to the brook where they\u2019d eaten the roasted fish. This was already several tens of miles from the Great Star Dou Forest, which meant that they were, fundamentally, far away from any danger.Huo Yuhao was naturally dragged over and made a chef one again, under Tang Ya\u2019s fierce request for him to roast more fish. However, he didn\u2019t need to catch the fish this time around.Bei Bei simply stretched his right hand into the water, then violet-blue lightning flashed in the water, causing ten unconscious mackerels to rise to the surface belly-up. After that, he used the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon technique to quickly get them to the brookside, allowing them to nearly instantly be able to eat.Tang Ya also took out some food that was stored within her storage soul tool. The three people sat together and ate a sumptuous dinner.Tang Ya was in extremely high spirits, which made her eat even more. After finishing her meal, she directly slept on the large tree beside the bonfire. On the other hand, the person who\u2019d actually obtained the most benefits, Huo Yuhao, hadn\u2019t gone to sleep yet. He resisted the doubled exhaustion caused by his tired body and mind, and asked for Bei Bei to give him some pointers so that he could begin to cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique for the first time.Bei Bei very much admired Huo Yuhao\u2019s diligence. After taking off his outerwear to cover Tang Ya with, he explained some of the main aspects of the Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s cultivation to Huo Yuhao. In addition to that, he helped Huo Yuhao start meditating.The paths that the Mysterious Heaven Technique passed through during cultivation were much more complicated than Huo Yuhao\u2019s original meditation technique. The number of passageways used by the technique were at least ten times greater than that of his original technique, so much so that Huo Yuhao\u2019s soulforce had never even passed through many of the channels.For the sake of ensuring Huo Yuhao\u2019s safety while cultivating, Bei Bei sat behind him in a cross-legged position. Bei Bei\u2019s hands were pressed against the centre of Huo Yuhao\u2019s back, allowing his soulforce to seep into Huo Yuhao\u2019s body as he guided Huo Yuhao\u2019s soulforce along the first circulation of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 5.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5.3: First Glimpse Through The GateBy the time that Huo Yuhao had just started to guide his soulforce around his body, Bei Bei\u2019s expression had turned serious. Huo Yuhao\u2019s comprehension skills were very high, and he was also very smart. However, his body\u2019s talents were indeed somewhat lacking. After Bei Bei\u2019s soulforce had entered Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, he discovered that his meridians were extremely narrow, and that there were some very delicate meridians in his body that wouldn\u2019t be able to handle any strong force flowing through.At this moment, Bei Bei realised that the fact that Huo Yuhao had been able to cultivate to his current rank, and that he had been able possess his first soul ring, had been somewhat difficult for him. After obtaining his first soul ring, his body would\u2019ve improved to a certain extent, but his passageways were still this frail. It could be seen just how poor his talent was, so much so that he truly wasn\u2019t much better off than some ordinary folks who hadn\u2019t even awakened their soulforce. Just how much willpower did he have to have to have cultivated his soulforce to the tenth rank and have become a Soul Master!Bei Bei had a calm temperament; discovering this didn\u2019t make him feel despair towards Huo Yuhao. Instead, his respect for him slightly increased. Being able to have such unwavering determination at Huo Yuhao\u2019s age meant that, even if Huo Yuhao\u2019s talent was somewhat poor, he\u2019d still be able to achieve something in life.After investigating the condition of Huo Yuhao body, Bei Bei guessed that the reason that Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eyes were so strong was definitely linked to the mutation of his martial soul. Furthermore, although his mutated martial soul was very strong, the harm it had caused to Huo Yuhao when he was young was also very great. Because he hadn\u2019t been properly cared for, it caused his talent to become like this. If he\u2019d been immediately treated with medicine after he was born, perhaps his junior brother would\u2019ve been a genius.In reality, Bei Bei\u2019s guess was only half-accurate. The reason why Huo Yuhao\u2019s body was so frail was indeed because of the deficiency caused by the mutation of his martial soul, and because of the lack of care towards him after awakening his martial spirit. However, the main reason why his Spirit Eyes\u2019 skills were so strong, was because of the million-year intelligent soul ring, the Skydream Iceworm.As the dark sky gradually turned dark blue, a patch of white slowly began to appear from the east. Bei Bei slowly withdrew his palms, and let out a long breath. It was hard to conceal the exhaustion on his slightly pale face.He\u2019d used an entire night to help unblock Huo Yuhao\u2019s passageways, helping him complete the first circulation of the Mysterious Heaven Technique. This process had been quite arduous, but it had had enormous benefits for Huo Yuhao.\u201cPeh\u2014\u201d Huo Yuhao spat out a mouthful of clotted blood before he opened his eyes.At this moment, Huo Yuhao felt that all 36,000 pores on his body had been opened up, causing an unprecedented feeling of relaxation to spread throughout his body. The mouthful of clotted blood he\u2019d spat out were impurities within his blood that had caused the stagnation of his passageways. After Bei Bei had helped him unblock his passageways, it finally unclogged his passageways. Even if his passageways were still thin and weak, he could at least let soulforce flow through them. This would allow Huo Yuhao\u2019s soulforce to flow smoothly when he cultivated in the future. To a certain extent, this had changed his physique.Even though Bei Bei was an excellent cultivator amongst his peers, and was a Soul Elder level expert, he was exhausted after unblocking Huo Yuhao\u2019s passageways.\u201cJunior brother, stand up and look towards the east. Follow my movements, and focus your eyes.\u201d Bei Bei resisted his exhaustion, and let out a low shout towards Huo Yuhao while grasping his shoulders with his hands.At this moment, Tang Ya, who had originally been sleeping soundly, actually woke up. She jumped up and arrived beside Bei Bei.The three of them opened their eyes and looked towards the eastern sky. A faint purple cloud seemed to flash through the marble-white sky that was gradually turning bright. If you didn\u2019t have astonishing visual acuity, as well as sufficient concentration, it would be impossible for one to discover its existence.The appearance of the purple cloud caused the three people\u2019s attention to be focused on it. They even stopped exhaling. Instead, they lightly and slowly inhaled, simultaneously fixing their gazes on the hint of purple that had suddenly, faintly appeared.The purple cloud wasn\u2019t present for very long. By the time the morning sun had slowly risen from the east, it had already disappeared.Only then did the three people slowly close their eyes, and simultaneously exhale the impurities from their bodies.Bei Bei and Tang Ya each spat out a misty white stream of air. After inhaling and exhaling several times, it finally dispersed.Although Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t even close to that of his Teacher Xiao Ya, or his eldest senior brother, he felt an intense shock.When he had looked at the purple cloud in the distant east, a strong warm feeling had seemed to flow into his brain via his Spirit Eyes, causing his eyes to obtain an unprecedented nourishment; so much so that he was able to look at anything with an extremely clear level of vision without using any soulforce. Even his peripheral vision instantly expanded.And when he had shut his eyes to contain that purple cloud, it had slowly immersed itself into his eyes. His Spirit Eyes had even started to naturally activate the soulforce within his body, causing it to merge with the purple cloud. The originally warm feeling gradually became a faint refreshing feeling that gave him an unspeakable sense of relaxation.The Purple Demon Eyes, this was the skill that Teacher Xiao Ya had spoken about. This was the skill that was said to be the most suitable for him to cultivate! This was only the first time that he\u2019d cultivated it, yet it unexpectedly had had such an effect. Huo Yuhao felt that even the soulforce that he\u2019d previously cultivated and upgraded for the past several months hadn\u2019t had as good an effect as this eastern purple cloud.After a full 15 minutes, that feeling of relaxation gradually disappeared. When Huo Yuhao finally opened his eyes, a faintly discernible purple light had already appeared in the depths of his clear, deep blue eyes.\u201cIt seems that you truly had good results!\u201d Tang Ya looked at Huo Yuhao with a pleased expression on her face.Huo Yuhao hurriedly stood up and respectfully said, \u201cThank you, teacher. Thank you, eldest senior brother.\u201dThe purple glint in Bei Bei\u2019s eyes gradually dimmed, but a look of extreme exhaustion still remained on his face. He patted Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulder as he said, \u201cWe\u2019re a family. In the future, you don\u2019t need to thank us. However, I\u2019m going to rest for a while, so I\u2019m afraid that we can only leave later. Teacher Xiao Ya, please prepare some food. Junior brother, go cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique again to consolidate your memories from last night.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The respect that Huo Yuhao had towards this eldest senior brother of his had deepened even more. After hearing his words, he immediately sat down and began to follow the Mysterious Heaven Technique to circulate his soulforce.With the profound memories of last night, along with Bei Bei unclogging his meridians, activating his soulforce was now much easier. The soulforce that he\u2019d originally obtained via meditation gradually turned a faint white colour after being refined by the Mysterious Heaven Technique.After two hours, Bei Bei took the initiative to awaken from his cultivation. His cultivation level was already extremely strong, so he could easily sweep away his exhaustion.Tang Ya gave Bei Bei some rations and quietly asked, \u201cHow is he?\u201dBei Bei smiled slightly and said, \u201cYou were actually right this time. My junior brother is a promising talent. His body\u2019s condition isn\u2019t great, but he has strong comprehensive abilities. Furthermore, he can bear hardship, and his heart is steady. He\u2019s a good sprout. In addition to that, the Mysterious Heaven Technique in and of itself has benefits towards his growth. If he cultivates it for a long time, it\u2019ll help repair the passageways in his body. This is a technique that\u2019s also quite suitable for him. As for his future growth, it\u2019ll depend on his own hard work, as well as what opportunities he obtains. All we can do is open a door for him, but how far he can travel will be up to him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Normally, you\u2019d never say thanks to me. Could it be because of my junior brother? I won\u2019t stand for a rival in love.\u201dTang Ya punched him unhappily and said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m thanking you for, stop acting stupid.\u201dBei Bei gently moved his arm, leisurely pulling Tang Ya into his embrace. \u201cXiao Ya, I\u2019ll admit it. The reason that I agreed to join the Tang Sect in the first place was because I\u2019d fallen for you, because I fell in love at first sight. But as I cultivated the Tang Sect\u2019s techniques, I realised more and more just how deep our Tang Sect is. Although the Tang Sect has declined, wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if we were able to redevelop it, and bring it to great heights? Therefore, I\u2019m already not just doing things for the Tang Sect solely because of you, but also because of the Tang Sect in and of itself.\u201dTang Ya blinked her large eyes and said, \u201cDoes that mean that you\u2019ll still work hard for the future of the Tang Sect, even if I don\u2019t like you?\u201dBei Bei\u2019s expression immediately changed as he spoke with a slightly exasperated tone, \u201cBe a bit more normal please.\u201d\u201cHeehee.\u201d Tang Ya smiled. \u201cI just love seeing you reveal your true colours. You normally have such a dignified look, aren\u2019t you tired of it?\u201dBei Bei flicked her forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s called being civilised. Don\u2019t think that everyone\u2019s like you! You\u2019re always revealing your thoughts on your face.\u201dTang Ya grabbed his wrist and spoke with a wronged expression, \u201cI\u2019m not allowing you to flick my forehead anymore, this is offending your teacher. Right, do you think that little Yuhao will be able to last at the academy?\u201dBei Bei shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say; it\u2019ll depend on his will. All I can say is that, if he can really manage to last there, and stay for the full twelve years, then his future accomplishments might be even higher than mine.\u201dTang Ya was startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d have such a high evaluation of him.\u201dBei Bei smiled slightly and replied, \u201cMy junior brother\u2019s mutated martial soul is extraordinary. You\u2019ll understand when I give you an example. There\u2019s already been a slight difference between the first and second time that he used his Spiritual Detection Sharing. This means that his mastery of the skill isn\u2019t that high, yet it\u2019s already amplified our powers by an enormous amount. Furthermore, if what he\u2019s said is true, it seems that this skill can still evolve. If his future soul skills are all like this, he\u2019ll definitely reach the pinnacle of spiritual control system soul masters.\u201dTang Ya said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, his self-defense skills are lacking. It\u2019ll remain like until he reaches a certain level of cultivation, too.\u201dBei Bei replied, \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. He won\u2019t need to protect himself, because, even if he merely has the skill that he just used, he\u2019s destined to have no lack of companions beside him.\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation period lasted even longer than Tang Ya and Bei Bei expected. His cultivation unexpectedly lasted all the way until noon. During this period of time, Bei Bei went over to him a few times to check on the circulation paths of the Mysterious Heaven Technique, which he found to have no deviations at all. It could be said that Huo Yuhao had truly entered the Tang Sect after his cultivation this time.After Huo Yuhao awakened from his cultivation, he ate some food. Then, the three of them headed towards the east.The majority of the Great Star Dou Forest lay within the territory of the Star Luo Empire, only a small portion of it lay within the Tian Hun Empire. On the other hand, Shrek Academy was located to the northeast of the Great Star Dou Forest, so the distance between the two wasn\u2019t considered too far.The reason that Tang Ya and Bei Bei had entered the Great Star Dou Forest from the south was because the surrounding area had a relatively low number of strong soul beasts.Because Shrek Academy frequently had students who\u2019d enter the Great Star Dou Forest to kill soul beasts, they were utterly hated by the expert soul beasts within. So much so, that a large number of soul beasts had charged out of the forest, creating a major event known as a \u2018beast wave\u2019, which had gone towards Shrek Academy.Because of this, every single person within the academy below the Soul King rank was prohibited from entering the Great Star Dou Forest from the entrance closest to the academy. Even if one were a Soul King expert, he\u2019d still need a teacher guiding him to be able to enter.The three of them hurried towards Shrek Academy, but the speed of their advance wasn\u2019t considered quick, since they had to circle around the Great Star Dou Forest. Thus, they had to travel nearly a thousand miles.During their journey, Tang Ya and Bei Bei imparted the absolute techniques of the Tang Sect to him. Of them, the techniques that Huo Yuhao comprehended the most where the Mysterious Heaven Technique and the Purple Demon Eyes. As for the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks, and Mysterious Jade Hands techniques, he\u2019d only just taken his first glimpse through the gate.Huo Yuhao\u2019s diligence had deeply stunned Tang Ya and Bei Bei. He, who was only eleven, didn\u2019t forget to cultivate even as they travelled. When Bei Bei told him that he could slightly increase his soulforce by continuously using his soul skills, Huo Yuhao unceasingly used his Spiritual Detection Sharing as long as he could. And the second that he started to rest, he\u2019d immediately start cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique. As they continued on with their journey, he even split his attention, releasing his soul skills while simultaneously pondering the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks, Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, and Mysterious Jade Hands.Because Huo Yuhao took a long time to cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique, their speed towards Shrek Academy was slowed down. However, Bei Bei and Tang Ya didn\u2019t rush him; they even increased their cultivation time under his impetus.\u201cXiao Ya, with your talent, if you had even half of my junior brother\u2019s diligence, I predict that you would\u2019ve long surpassed me.\u201d Bei Bei said as he looked towards Huo Yuhao, who was currently sitting cross-legged under a large tree, his attention focused on cultivating.Tang Ya curled her lips and said, \u201cAre even you that diligent? It\u2019s not like even you can compare with little Yuhao. However, he seems to be hiding something within his heart. It\u2019s this secret that pushes him to be so hard working. However, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good or thing, a bad thing.\u201dBei Bei smiled slightly as he stated, \u201cHaving a target is never a bad thing. Furthermore, he\u2019s still young, so his heart will eventually open up as we secretly influence him. Currently, the most important thing for him is breaking through to rank thirty before the age of twenty.\u201dAt this moment, Huo Yuhao had awakened from his meditation. A faint white stream of air swirled around his mouth and nose, and a golden light flickered through his clear eyes the instant he opened them. His Spirit Eyes seemed to have become even more penetrating.Admittedly, the reason that Huo Yuhao diligently cultivated was to become an outstanding person. However, the most important thing for him right now was to comprehend the new experiences he\u2019d acquired from switching to the Mysterious Heaven Technique.With Bei Bei and Tang Ya\u2019s help, his physique had improved by a certain amount. The Mysterious Heaven Technique was truly a considerably outstanding technique; they\u2019d already been travelling for four days straight, thus the total amount of time that he\u2019d cultivated the Mysterious Heaven Technique was also four days long. During the past four days, the soulforce in his body had already transformed into the soulforce cultivated by the Mysterious Heaven Technique. The impure and chaotic soulforce in his body was gradually purified during the transformation process. Every time he finished cultivating, his entire body would experience a warm feeling that led to an unspeakable amount of comfort; its recovery effects were even better than that of sleeping.Although his total amount of soulforce hadn\u2019t increased by much, Huo Yuhao could clearly feel the changes that had occurred in his body, as well as the qualitative change his soulforce had gone through after transforming into the pure soulforce of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.This was the first time in his life of cultivation that such a clear improvement had occurred, so how could he not be assiduous and diligent?\u201cLittle Yuhao, you can\u2019t always be working so hard. You should take a rest when you need to. If not, won\u2019t you become a blockhead after a while?\u201d Tang Ya said seriously.Huo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cYes, Teacher Xiao Ya.\u201dTang Ya giggled as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so honest and obedient, okay? It\u2019s really boring. Alright, let\u2019s go, we\u2019ve almost reached the academy. You\u2019ve been immersed in cultivation the past few days, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to tell you about some things that you need to pay attention to inside of the academy. You\u2019ve taken a break at just the right time, so relax your mind for a bit and listen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 6.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6.1: The Number One Academy on the Douluo Continent\u201cOh.\u201d Huo Yuhao had originally planned to ponder the few capturing techniques that Bei Bei had taught him yesterday, but he immediately turned blank after hearing what Tang Ya had said.The three continued their journey. While they were walking, Tang Ya explained the situation within Shrek Academy to Huo Yuhao.Shrek Academy had been established ten thousand years ago, and the word \u2018Shrek\u2019 meant \u2018monster\u2019 in the ancient language. This also meant that, the people who\u2019d founded Shrek Academy at the start had wanted to establish an academy of monsters.Shrek Academy\u2019s oldest motto was \u201cTo breed only monsters, not ordinary people.\u201d, but the word \u2018monster\u2019 actually referred to geniuses.Even the person who\u2019d founded the Douluo Continent\u2019s number one Tang Sect had graduated from Shrek Academy, and it was also that student who brought about the first glorious moment for Shrek Academy. At that time, Shrek Academy had only had their founding students, who were referred to as the Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters within the Shrek Academy\u2019s history.The story of Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters had already spread for a long time, and the most famous of them was still the husband and wife couple that included the sect master of the Tang Sect. Afterwards, although the Tang Sect declined, Shrek Academy still stood high. Furthermore, following the developments that came with the passage of time, it gradually became the number one academy on the Douluo Continent.Nowadays, Shrek Academy held a position of power within the continent, the root of the cause of being the continental war that had occurred during the collision of the Douluo Continent and the Sun Moon Continent four thousand years ago.When the war had only just started, the three empires of the Douluo Continent had been divided in their opinions, causing the Douluo Continent to be at a disadvantageous position during the start of the war, so much so that the army of the Sun Moon Continent had been able to make their way to the inner parts of the Douluo Continent.At this crucial moment, Shrek Academy\u2019s dean from that year had made a rallying cry. This had an unexpectedly large response, causing nearly sixty Titled Douluo super-experts to temporarily become the commanders of the three armies. After taking command of their armies, they swiftly destroyed the Sun Moon Empire\u2019s army, obtaining the final victory in the war, and unifying the continents into one called the Douluo Continent. The Sun Moon Empire only managed to continue existing afterwards by giving up its lands, and by paying war reparations. However, their military strength had been weakened by an extremely large amount, which led to them being unable to contend with the three combined armies of the Douluo Continent anymore. Its military strength was equivalent to that of a single empire, at most.The war also caused the reputation of Shrek\u2019s Academy to soar. It wasn\u2019t just because Shrek Academy had gathered sixty Titled Douluos, but was also because that year\u2019s dean had become the commander of the three empires\u2019 unified army. Under his rallying cry, the royal families from the three great empires discovered, to their great surprise, that practically all of the generals of the unified army had come from Shrek Academy. Under the unified allocation of resources by Shrek Academy\u2019s dean, the combined army of the three great empires no longer had any discord between them. It was also because of this unification that they were able to achieve victory.From then on, Shrek Academy no longer belonged to any single country; it had become a standalone existence.Shrek Academy had successively raised extremely wise deans. Although the academy held a majestic position on the continent, they weren\u2019t arrogant in the least. The academy\u2019s attitude towards all countries was the same. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t possess any private armies, and the number of teachers that they kept was even kept at a certain limit. Because of this, Shrek Academy didn\u2019t cause any of the countries to feel a sense of danger. After all, Shrek Academy was an academy. Thus, not only did it continue to exist, but its lofty position within the continent was also one that couldn\u2019t be easily shaken by any country.Shrek Academy was located within the southeastern portion of the Tian Hun Empire, with the Great Star Dou Forest located directly southwest from it. The Dou Ling Empire was east of it, and the Star Luo Empire was located northwards. It could be said that Shrek Academy was located at the intersection point of the three empires.Tang Ya told Huo Yuhao that Shrek Academy was currently divided into two parts: the inner courtyard and the outer courtyard. Every year, the number of new students they\u2019d recruit was around a thousand or so, yet the total number of students within the academy had never surpassed five thousand. It would take twelve years for one to complete their studies and graduate after entering Shrek Academy. This also meant that Shrek Academy\u2019s elimination rate was extremely high every year. If one wasn\u2019t able to pass the academy\u2019s assessments, he\u2019d be mercilessly kicked out of the academy.However, every single person that managed to successfully graduate from Shrek Academy was a once-in-a-generation genius.It could be said that Shrek Academy was truly a cradle filled with experts, so much so that even political issues would occur between the Tian Hun Empire, Dou Ling Empire, and Star Luo Empire due to the number of students that Shrek Academy would admit each year. The fame of the number one academy in the world could clearly be seen from this.The Sun Moon Empire, on the other hand\u2014possibly due to their enmity with Shrek Academy\u2014had never asked to send people to study at Shrek Academy. There were also a few high-level academies within the Sun Moon Empire that had already reached a fairly high standard after experiencing a few thousand years of development. Only, the Sun Moon Empire\u2019s military strength had always been limited due to the pact they\u2019d made after the war, which prevented them from expanding too much. Thus, the Sun Moon Empire was still keeping a low profile, at least on the surface.\u201cYuhao, once you enter the academy, you\u2019ll cultivate in the outer courtyard. The outer courtyard is split into many faculties, so you should temporarily cultivate inside the control faculty. At the same time, you should simultaneously study inside of the Soul Engineering Institution. How about it?\u201d Tang Ya asked Huo Yuhao after giving him a simple introduction to the Shrek Academy\u2019s internal situation.\u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, what\u2019s this \u2018Soul Engineering Institution\u2019?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked.Tang Ya replied, \u201cThe so-called Soul Engineering Institution is a place created for the sake of studying soul weapons.\u201d She unexpectedly clenched her teeth in anger as she said the words \u2018soul weapons\u2019.\u201cSoul weapons?\u201d Huo Yuhao was still slightly puzzled. However, you couldn\u2019t blame him. Shrek Academy was currently the number one academy on the continent, yet he\u2019d grown up in a closed environment since he was young. Thus, he naturally had little knowledge and experience of such matters.Seeing Tang Ya\u2019s slightly unhappy expression, Bei Bei took her place explaining things to Huo Yuhao. \u201cSoul tools actually have a very large relationship with our Tang Sect. In a sense, soul tools are weapons that we use soulforce to activate. Higher quality soul tools will possess greater might. This also means that, even if you\u2019re only a tool soul master, you\u2019d still be able to possess considerably high attack power if you had a strong soul tool. However, the development of soul tools was one of the main reasons for our Tang Sect\u2019s decline.\u201d\u201cOur Tang Sect was still flourishing four thousand years ago. However, the collision with the Sun Moon Continent was the root cause for our Tang Sect\u2019s decline.\u201d Tang Ya spoke with a hateful tone, \u201cOur Tang Sect was famous for hidden weapons, and our main source of income was obtained by selling hidden weapons. In the past, almost every single country would purchase a certain amount of hidden weapons from us\u2014even some sects would do the same.\u201d\u201cOver four thousand years ago, war quickly broke out when the Sun Moon Continent collided with our Douluo Continent. The three empires\u2019 armies, supported by the hidden weapons of our Tang Sect, collided with the army of the Sun Moon Empire. In the end, although the Sun Moon Empire wasn\u2019t strong in the aspect of soul masters, they possessed unique insights in the aspects of soul tools. These soul tools were activated with soulforce, and surpassed our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons in strength as a whole, as well as in attack range. In the end, it caused the three empires of our Douluo Continent to suffer disastrous losses during the initial phase of the war.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From then on, various countries started a large-scale reduction in purchasing our hidden weapons. Even though our income was still high, a large portion of it was donated out, as per the will of the first sect master. The donated money was used to improve the lifestyle of the ordinary folk who lived in impoverished areas, as well as to build schools and other public facilities. Thus, we didn\u2019t have a lot of extra cash.\u201d\u201cAt that time, the Tang Sect had several thousand people in it. However, the speed of our decline was simply too quick. After only a mere two hundred years, our Tang Sect had rapidly declined. The former number one sect in the continent never saw its former glory again. When the Tang Sect reached my generation, the only three people left were my father, my mother, and me. And when we were hunting some soul beasts, my mother and father died. Thus, the Tang Sect only had a lone child like me left.\u201dWhen she got to this point, tears flowed down Tang Ya\u2019s smooth and exquisite face, and she couldn\u2019t help but clench her fists tightly.Huo Yuhao murmured, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, are our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons truly incomparable to these soul tools?\u201dTang Ya sighed and said, \u201cIn certain aspects, what you say is indeed true. What the Sun Moon Continent brought to us wasn\u2019t just soul tools, but also a plentiful amount of minerals. These rare minerals are all extremely good conductors for soulforce, which makes them especially suitable for manufacturing soul tools. This caused the high-speed development of soul tools to happen during the few thousand years after the war had ended, which resulted in an even smaller market for our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons. However, in the field of degree of meticulousness, as well as design ingenuity, our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons absolutely surpass soul tools; this is especially true of a few sharp hidden weapons, which are even superior to soul weapons. However, the manufacturing requirements for those hidden weapons are also extremely complicated.\u201dBei Bei rubbed Tang Ya\u2019s head and said, \u201c The development of soul tools has truly dealt a harsh blow to our Tang Sect and its hidden weapons. When I\u2019d just met Tang Ya, she stubbornly believed that hidden weapons were stronger than soul tools. However, the facts have proven that soul tools are capable of replacing our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons in becoming weapons that are accepted by all parties, which indeed makes sense. Firstly, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve simply been easily accepted by the masses, especially those tool soul masters who don\u2019t actually have any attacking capabilities. After possessing a soul tool, they turned into battle soul masters in practically an instant, with the only cost they had to pay being soulforce. Thus, after Xiao Ya and I discussed it, we decided that out Tang Sect absolutely could not continue following our old ways, locking ourselves in our own world, if we wanted the sect to flourish once again. If we want to make the glory of the Tang Sect reappear, then not only do we have to understand soul tools, but we also need to merge them with the manufacturing techniques of our current hidden weapons to create even stronger soul tools. This is the only way our Tang Sect will have the opportunity to grow. Because of this, each and every one of our Tang Sect\u2019s disciples must simultaneously study soul tools while cultivating their martial souls.\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, eldest senior brother, since soul weapons are so strong, why did the Sun Moon Empire lose to the allied army of our three empires during the war?\u201dBei Bei smiled calmly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because, although the soul weapons they possessed back then were strong, even the strongest soul tool wasn\u2019t able to compare to the fighting power of a Titled Douluo. However, after a few thousand years of development, a few especially strong soul tools have begun to appear, whose strength can even threaten Titled Douluos. However, soul tools have a major issue, which is the fact that stronger soul tools require stronger soul masters to use them to their fullest extent. If you don\u2019t have enough soulforce to support their usage, their power will be extremely limited. Thus, an interesting phenomena has occurred after our two continents merged together. The people over here are doing their utmost to study the methods needed to manufacture soul tools, while the people over at the Sun Moon Empire are doing their best to cultivate strong soul masters. After these past few thousand years, our two continents seem to actually be somewhat balanced.\u201dHuo Yuhao finally had an initial understanding of Shrek Academy with Bei Bei and Tang Ya\u2019s introductions.After Tang Ya rubbed the tears off of her face, she grabbed Huo Yuhao\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cLittle Yuhao, the most important thing for you to do right now is to stay within Shrek Academy. Bei Bei and I are already third year students, and it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for us to rise to the rank of fourth year students since I\u2019ve obtained my thousand-year soul ring. After becoming fourth year students, the elimination rate isn\u2019t that high. After a few more years, we\u2019ll have the chance to enter the inner courtyard and study there. However, you\u2019re different. After entering the academy as a first year student, the competition you\u2019ll face will be the most intense. The academy will have an assessment for new students every three months, and only students who are able to pass the assessment can stay. Although our Tang Sect has the privilege of admitting a single student into Shrek Academy, whether you can continue to stay will all depend on you. This is something that no one can help you with, do you understand?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head seriously as he said, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, I will definitely do my best. However, with your and eldest senior brother\u2019s power, have you actually not become students of the inner courtyard?\u201dTang Ya replied, \u201cWanting to enter the inner courtyard of Shrek Academy is easier said than done. The rules for Shrek Academy have never been changed. The outer courtyard was only created later on, due to the three empires requests so that they could cultivate even more talented people. However, only students who have entered the inner courtyard are considered true students of Shrek Academy. Every single student in the inner courtyard is a genius or a monstrous genius, and some of them can only be described as monsters. Students in the outer courtyard will have a test after staying there for six years, and can graduate after passing that test. Only the most outstanding people that take the test, which number extremely few, will have the chance to take the entrance exam for the inner courtyard. Only after passing that test will they have permission to enter the inner courtyard. The time taken to complete their studies within the inner courtyard is also six years. Supposedly, every single person that has graduated from the inner courtyard is at least an expert of the Soul Emperor rank! Furthermore, they\u2019ll receive the best treatment from all countries, including the Sun Moon Empire.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that amazing!\u201d When Huo Yuhao heard this, he couldn\u2019t help a feeling of infatuation rising in his heart. He secretly thought to himself that, if he could one day become a graduating student from Shrek Academy\u2019s inner courtyard, he could return to the Duke\u2019s Mansion to ask for his mother\u2019s remains. Then, his mother could be at peace. After he thought of this, he couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists tightly.Bei Bei was serious as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s far more amazing. I once saw an upperclassman from the inner courtyard. He entered the Great Star Dou Forest by himself, and defeated three ten-thousand-year soul beasts with his bare hands, without killing them! He then took them back to the academy. Supposedly, that was the mission he\u2019d received for his tenth year assessment.\u201dTang Ya said, \u201cI\u2019ve even heard that there was once a twelfth-year upperclassmen who\u2019d already reached the Soul Sage level by the time he graduated. Furthermore, he even possessed a hundred thousand year soul ring! That upperclassman later stayed in the academy to be raised as the next dean of the academy.\u201dAfter hearing their explanations, Huo Yuhao had begun to have an impatient feeling. His interactions with Bei Bei and Tang Ya these past few days had made him deeply understand the enormous benefits he received towards his cultivation when he had a good teacher. Shrek Academy was undoubtedly the best choice! He secretly made a vow to himself that, no matter how hard he had to work, he\u2019d ensure that he remained in the outer courtyard, and that he would strive to enter the inner courtyard in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bei Bei and Tang Ya\u2019s introduction to Shrek Academy had already ignited a flame in his heart.Tang Ya and Bei Bei couldn\u2019t help but smile at each other when they saw Huo Yuhao\u2019s appearance. When they\u2019d entered Shrek Academy in the beginning, weren\u2019t they just like Huo Yuhao?After a few hours, Huo Yuhao finally saw Shrek Academy.Rather than calling it an academy, it\u2019d be more suitable to call it a city. As they walked out of the forest near the main road, they were able to see the tall walls of the city beginning to extend upwards from the distant fields.Shrek Academy had been established on a wide field, thus the area that it covered was extremely vast. It was a city in and of itself, and the city\u2019s name was \u2018Shrek City\u2019. Shrek City was one of the biggest cities on the Douluo Continent, and the number of people who lived in it surpassed two million. Furthermore, Shrek Academy was the sole governor of the city, and didn\u2019t need to pay any taxes to any country. This single point just by itself was something that every single other academy, including those in the Sun Moon Continent, were unable to say.Shrek Academy wasn\u2019t located in the middle of Shrek City, but the eastern part. This was because the distant Great Star Dou Forest was located towards the east.Shrek Academy was surrounded by land in all directions, and could also be said to be accessible from all directions. It wasn\u2019t only the location of Shrek Academy, but was also the most important trade city for the Douluo Continent\u2019s original three empires. Because of Shrek Academy, the peacekeeping within Shrek City was extremely good. Transactions made within the city weren\u2019t just fair, but also made people feel at ease. Because of this, most of the merchants from the three empires would choose to do their business within Shrek City when conducting transnational trade.The southern, western, and northern city gates of Shrek City could be entered and exited through at will. Only the eastern gate was exclusive to Shrek Academy.Under Bei Bei and Tang Ya\u2019s lead, Huo Yuhao arrived outside the eastern city gate.This city gate was only usable by Shrek Academy, but it was currently extremely busy. There were at least five thousand people gathered outside the eastern gate, and it was unusually lively. A large number of traders had already moved here due to the rumours, as this gate was even livelier than the other gates by a large margin.\u201cJunior brother, you\u2019re just in time for the academy\u2019s recruitment of new students. You should be able join this year\u2019s batch of new students without any problems, which\u2019ll make you our junior by three years. These ordinary new students don\u2019t just have to pass the assessment, but also have to have a recommendation letter from one of the three empires\u2019 capital cities at the very minimum. This time of year is always the busiest period of time for Shrek City.\u201dHuo Yuhao quietly asked, \u201cEldest senior brother, is the assessment very difficult?\u201dBei Bei hesitated, and subconsciously looked towards Huo Yuhao.Tang Ya, on the other hand, was straightforward as she said, \u201cHe\u2019ll find out sooner or later. This will also become the driving force behind his future hard work, so it\u2019s better to tell him now. Little Yuhao, the entrance exam for Shrek Academy\u2019s outer courtyard has two requirements: One, you cannot be older than twenty, and two, your soulforce cannot be lower than the fifteenth rank. If you look at it purely from the standpoint of the examination\u2019s standards, you don\u2019t meet the qualifications to enter.\u201dShe didn\u2019t say anything that would make Huo Yuhao work harder, because she knew that he already worked hard enough.Huo Yuhao asked seriously, \u201cThen, will the first assessment after three months also test my soulforce?\u201d With his physique, wanting to increase his soulforce from the eleventh rank to the fifteenth rank within three months was an entirely impossible task.Bei Bei shook his head and replied, \u201cNo. The assessments of our Shrek Academy always consist of live combat. As a teacher once said, \u2018any amount of numerical data pales in the face of live combat\u2019.\u201dHuo Yuhao forcefully nodded his head. \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, eldest senior brother, perhaps I currently can\u2019t compare to the overwhelming majority of the new students, but I will definitely exceed them in the future.\u201d His words had a calmness that surpassed his peers, and an a firmness that did the same was also present within his Spirit Eyes.Bei Bei, who was a head taller than Huo Yuhao, extended his arms out to grab his shoulders as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. If you can get through the following three months, eldest senior brother will be optimistic about your chances to get to the end.\u201dBei Bei and Tang Ya took Huo Yuhao with them as they skirted the crowd, and arrived at the eastern city gate.There were ten male and female youths standing outside the eastern city gate, protecting it. They were roughly the same age as Tang Ya and Bei Bei, and all of them were wearing yellow warrior robes with a green pattern inscribed on the chests. This was the uniform for second and third year students of Shrek Academy\u2019s outer courtyard.When they saw Bei Bei, they immediately became respectful. \u201cEldest senior brother Bei, you\u2019ve returned.\u201dBei Bei smiled and greeted every one of his junior and senior brothers. Afterwards, he spoke a few words to the leader of the group. That student glanced at Huo Yuhao, then immediately nodded his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to doubt about our senior brother\u2019s words. Go take this junior brother inside to register.\u201dBei Bei smiled as he gave him a thumbs up. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll treat you junior brothers to a meal next time.\u201dThe other person wasn\u2019t polite either as he laughed. \u201cThen that\u2019s that. We won\u2019t give up the chance to have a feast.\u201dBei Bei raised his hand and gave him a high five. \u201cI won\u2019t disappoint everyone.\u201d When he\u2019d finished speaking, he and Tang Ya took Huo Yuhao into the eastern city gate, which was also the symbol for Shrek Academy\u2019s door.Not far away, a new student, who\u2019d just finished enrolling for his assessment, asked the older student who was in charge of his assessment, \u201cSenior classmate, who was that senior classmate?\u201d\u201cThat was senior brother Bei. His name is Bei Bei, but everyone calls him Thunderbolt Bei Bei. He possesses the number one beast soul, the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon. Furthermore, he\u2019s exceptionally talented. At the age of thirteen, he broke through to the thirtieth rank, and his cultivation has supposedly approached the fortieth rank, which means that he could breakthrough and become a Soul Ancestor in one or two years. He\u2019s one of the outstanding experts of our outer courtyard. With senior brother Bei\u2019s strength, and if it weren\u2019t for that junior classmate called Tang Ya who\u2019s accompanying him, he could\u2019ve already started the fifth-year assessment for the outer courtyard. If he breaks through to the fortieth rank, I predict that even the sixth-year assessments won\u2019t stop him. Eldest senior brother Bei isn\u2019t just strong, he\u2019s always been kind to people. If you were to ask who the most popular person in the outer courtyard was, it would definitely be him. Senior brother Bei is the Prince Charming of many female students in the outer courtyard, but he\u2019s single-mindedly focused on who he loves. For the sake of junior classmate Tang Ya, he\u2019s rejected the confessions of an uncountable number of junior and senior female classmates. Reportedly, even some of the female senior classmates from the inner courtyard have fallen for him. Everyone says that senior brother Bei will definitely enter the inner courtyard in two years at most.\u201dWhen Bei Bei and Tang Ya took Huo Yuhao into Shrek Academy, it was different from the vast and solemn scene that he\u2019d imagined. Shrek Academy had an elegant environment, and there were various types of abundant and lush flora within. As he walked along the wide main path, he was able to see at least ten plants in every direction he looked. These plants had clearly been meticulously pruned.After he\u2019d walked for two hundred or so metres, several enormous sculptures appeared in front of him, covering his line of sight. There were a total of ten sculptures, and they were all ten metres tall. They had all been carved from extremely tough granite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 6.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6.4: Number One Academy in the Douluo ContinentThere were three sculptures in the front, with the middle sculpture resembling an old man. He had a set of spectacles and a beaming look on his face. His figure was average, but he was slightly plump, and he looked like a yes-man.Bei Bei said to Huo Yuhao, \u201cThe person in the middle is the founder of Shrek Academy, and also the first dean of the academy, Flender. The person to his left is an ancestor of my clan. He created the teaching foundations that are currently used by various martial soul systems within Shrek Academy. He\u2019s also one of the martial soul world\u2019s ten core role models, and has the title of Grandmaster. His name is Yu Xiaogang. My mother was a direct descendant of his bloodline. The woman to the right is also another ancestor of mine, Liu Erlong. She\u2019s Grandmaster\u2019s wife. The three of them were able to merge together and form the Golden Iron Triangle. If Dean Flender could be said to have founded Shrek Academy, then Grandmaster would be the true spirit behind it. He was also the person who single-handedly raised Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters, whose sculptures are behind them.The sculpture of Grandmaster looked like a middle-aged man who\u2019d wasted away a bit, while Liu Erlong was a charming middle-aged woman.There were seven sculptures lined up horizontally behind them. When Huo Yuhao\u2019s gaze fell upon the sculpture in the middle, who stood at the forefront of the others, his body couldn\u2019t help but tremble.It was a statue of a tall man who had a handsome appearance, but the most peculiar thing about him, were his eyes. There was a pattern on his forehead with the word \u201cKing\u201d, and although it was only a sculpture, it had a sort of imposing and strong pressure.\u201cThe seven sculptures that stand behind the Golden Iron Triangle are Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters, who previously created their own glory. The person who\u2019s standing in front is the White Tiger Douluo, Dai Mubai, while the second person is the Sausage Douluo, Oscar. The third person is our Tang Sect\u2019s ancestor, the Asura Douluo, Tang San.Tang San was the most handsome amongst the seven. His blue hair was draped across his shoulders, and he wore a simple set of warriors robes. Blue vines that were clearly his Bluesilver Grass martial soul had coiled around the sculpture. There was also a faint smile at the corner of his mouth, but his lifelike gaze was fixed on a woman who was fifth in the row, who had braided hair.\u201cThe fourth person is the Evil Phoenix Douluo, Ma Hongjun, while the fifth person is Tang San\u2019s wife, the Soft Bone Douluo, Xiao Wu. According to the stories, she was a hundred thousand year soul beast who chose to cultivate as a human. The person even further back is the Nine Treasure Douluo, Ning Rongrong, who holds the title of the world\u2019s strongest auxiliary soul master; she was also the Sausage Douluo\u2019s wife. The last person is the Netherworld Douluo, Zhu Zhuqing. She was the wife of the White Tiger Douluo.\u201dThe first generation of Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters sculptures all had different shapes, but the fact that they were all Titled Douluos attested to how strong they\u2019d been in the past.Tang Ya\u2019s gaze was fixed on the sculpture of the Asura Douluo, Tang San. The Golden Iron Triangle and the first generation of Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters had laid the foundation for Shrek Academy. Even though ten thousand years had gone by, and even though Shrek Academy had raised an uncountable number of outstanding geniuses and experts, the number of sculptures had never increased, and had remained at ten.Bei Bei explained to Huo Yuhao, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to separate here. If you walk to the left, you\u2019ll arrive at the Martial Soul Institution. If you walk to the right, you\u2019ll arrive at the Soul Engineering Institution. These are the two largest branches of Shrek Academy, and they both belong to the outer courtyard. If you were to compare them, the Martial Soul Institution is larger, while the Soul Engineering Institution is smaller. Furthermore, the Martial Soul Institution is also divided into many departments. We\u2019ll go to the Martial Soul Institution to get you registered first. The basic requirement for you to enroll in the Soul Engineering Institution is for you to pass the first assessment for new students.\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s gaze was still stuck on the ten sculptures. When he thought about the legends that his mother had told him about, he occasionally felt a shocked feeling rise in his heart.The road to the left of the sculptures was still very wide, and could fit four or five carriages side-by-side. There was a signboard next to the road with the words \u2018Lakeside Path\u2019 written on it.You could faintly see a large body of water hidden within the shady green trees to the right. This also meant that there was an enormous lake behind the ten sculptures of the Golden Iron Triangle and Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters.Tang Ya noticed Huo Yuhao\u2019s gaze, and couldn\u2019t help but speak with a slightly proud voice, \u201cThat\u2019s an artificial lake made for the sake of commemorating our Tang Sect\u2019s ancestor, Tang San. It\u2019s called Sea God\u2019s Lake, because according to the legends, our ancestor Tang San inherited the Sea God\u2019s legacy. The Sea God\u2019s Lake has an extremely large surface area, and is filled entirely with groundwater. Our Shrek Academy\u2019s inner courtyard is located on an island in the middle of the Sea God\u2019s Lake. Every single disciple from the outer courtyard feels honored if they\u2019re able to reach the centre island of Sea God\u2019s Lake.Bei Bei looked toward the Sea God\u2019s Lake with a deep gaze, and a determined and stubborn light flashed through his eyes.The Sea God\u2019s Lake was indeed very large. As they followed the lakeside path to head southward, they only needed to turn westwards after a full fifteen minutes had passed. Only after they\u2019d walked another fifteen minutes or so did the path finally begin to recede, causing a vast, rectangular plaza to appear in their line of sight. A signboard with the words \u2018Shrek Plaza\u2019 also stood beside the plaza.There were many tall teaching areas behind Shrek Plaza. The colours of these teaching areas were all different, and were separated into four main colours\u2014white, yellow, purple, and black. If one gazed into the far south of Shrek Plaza, they\u2019d even be able to see a grey teaching area.Bei Bei pointed towards the teaching areas next to the plaza as he said, \u201cThe different coloured teaching areas represent the different years of students, which are differentiated according to the colours of soul rings. The white teaching areas are for new students, just like the lowest level ten year soul rings. Accordingly, the yellow teaching areas are for the outer courtyard\u2019s second and third year students, and the purple teaching areas are for the fourth and fifth year students. The black teaching areas are for the sixth year students. If you\u2019re able to leave the black teaching areas, you\u2019ll be able to obtain a graduation certificate from the academy\u2019s outer courtyard.\u201cThose grey teaching areas in the distance belong to the Soul Engineering Institution. If you compare were to compare their size here, the Soul Engineering Institution takes up roughly a third of the teaching area, while the Martial Soul Department takes up a full two-thirds. Besides these teaching areas at the front, there are also many special teaching grounds located in the back, such as the Soul Dueling Arena, the assessment areas, the dormitories, the teacher\u2019s offices, and so on.\u201dThe new students\u2019 white teaching areas were located to the far south, and were also the closest to the lakeside path. The three of them walked southwards from Shrek Plaza, arriving at the teaching area.Because it was currently the period that new students were admitted in, the new student\u2019s teaching area was especially lively. A few new students who\u2019d already passed their assessments were currently there to enroll.With Bei Bei and Tang Ya\u2019s guidance, Huo Yuhao was able to report for his registration extremely smoothly. The school\u2019s fees were paid by Bei Bei, with the fee for a new student unexpectedly being ten gold soul coins. Furthermore, this didn\u2019t include his food expenses. If one had to quit school due to failing an assessment, their school fees wouldn\u2019t be refunded.After collecting his dorm key and two sets of school uniforms, as well as a white freshman badge, Huo Yuhao followed Tang Ya and Bei Bei towards the new student\u2019s teaching area.Tang Ya said, \u201cLittle Yuhao, the dormitory\u2019s behind the teaching areas; it\u2019s the largest building in the entire academy. You can go there by yourself later. New students will formally start their classes in three days, so you can familiarize yourself with the environment during the next few days. We\u2019ve paid for your first year\u2019s school fees, but you\u2019ll have to rely on yourself for next year. The academy has various types of competitions, all of which have prize money for winning them. Also, you\u2019re already a soul master, so once you finish registering, you can collect a salary that the three empires give out once a month. You should save some of it, but it should be enough for food.\u201dHuo Yuhao made sure he remembered everything that Tang Ya said. When he was about to bid his farewells to Teacher Xiao Ya and Bei Bei, Bei Bei looked at the nearby bulletin board and furrowed his brows slightly when he saw the announcement pasted on it.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t need to walk up to it; He merely circulated his soulforce a bit, and the strong visual abilities of his Spirit Eyes exhibited their use, allowing him to see the words on the announcement clearly.Huo Yuhao\u2019s mother had taught him how to read since he was young, so although he\u2019d never formally attended school, his education level wasn\u2019t bad at all.He saw the words that were written on the announcement: \u201cTeacher in charge of the class one: Zhou Yi. Teacher in charge of class two\u2026\u201dZhou Yi? I think that I\u2019m in class one! Because he\u2019d registered early, Huo Yuhao had been directly assigned to the first class of new students, class one.Tang Ya had also noticed. She let out a low cry of surprise. \u201cAh? Why is it that perverted old grandma, Zhou Yi? Doesn\u2019t she teach year three? Why would she be assigned to teach new students?\u201dBei Bei smiled bitterly, \u201cI heard that Teacher Zhou was overly strict when she taught the third year students, which resulted in only ten percent of her students being promoted to fourth year students. Furthermore, she was reported by the students to the academy many times, which led to her being demoted to teaching new students. Junior brother, you must be careful. There aren\u2019t many monstrous students within the outer courtyard of our Shrek Academy, but there are many monstrous teachers. Of them, the worst is this Teacher Zhou.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of all the students promoted from her class, none of them have actually said that she was a bad teacher. Teacher Zhou\u2019s strictness is mainly reflected in the high requirements that she sets for her students, as well as in her harsh teaching methods. However, almost a fourth of the students who\u2019ve been taught by Teacher Zhou, and passed, have entered the inner courtyard. This statistic is one of the best within the entire academy. Teacher Zhou was only demoted to teaching freshmen because the commotion was too big this time. However, as long as you work hard enough, and are outstanding enough, Teacher Zhou\u2019s teaching will only have benefits for you.\u201dHuo Yuhao relaxed and replied, \u201cSo it\u2019s like that. Teacher Xiao Ya, eldest senior brother, you guys must have plenty of other things to do. I\u2019ll return to my room first.\u201dBei Bei smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Teacher Xiao Ya and I want to go and take our promotion test. If we can pass this test, we\u2019ll be promoted to fourth-years. I live in Room 316, so you can go there if you need anything.\u201dBei Bei and Tang Ya were truly busy. The reason why Tang Ya had been in such a rush to obtain her third soul ring was so that she could smoothly pass the fourth-year promotion test. Furthermore, there would be even more issues waiting for them after they were promoted. Huo Yuhao had gone to the Great Star Dou Forest alone, and had obtained his soul ring there, so his self-protection abilities were quite strong. Thus, they didn\u2019t worry much about him.After passing through the white school building for first-years, and the yellow school building for second and third-year students, Huo Yuhao saw the dormitory. The dormitory occupied an extremely large area, and although it was only a single building, the same four colours\u2014white, yellow, purple, and black\u2014were still present on it. The building\u2019s colours clearly represented the different living areas of the students from their respective years, and had a total of six floors.Huo Yuhao arrived at the entrance to the white building, and was met with the sight of a man who looked quite old. The old man had a set of grey clothes on, and the the number of flies that his wrinkles could crush to death had reached the double digits. His eyes were yellow and muddle-headed, while his eyelids were droopy. His appearance was as if he had one foot in the grave. The sunlight between the buildings spilled perfectly over his body. His body, which was half-lying in a chair, actually gave off a very comfortable feeling.Huo Yuhao walked forward and spoke respectfully, \u201cHello, Grandpa. I\u2019m a new student who\u2019s come to live in the dormitory. Would you like to check my freshman badge?\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t even raise his head as he stretched his trembling right hand out. Then, a slightly deep yet hoarse voice echoed out, \u201cTake your badge and dormitory key out for me to see.\u201dHuo Yuhao hurriedly passed the two items over.The old man waved them in front of his eyes before returning them to Huo Yuhao. \u201cGo on. Room 108 is the third room from my left on the first floor. The women\u2019s dorms start from the fourth floor, so you can\u2019t go upstairs at all. If we discover you up there, you\u2019ll be expelled.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d After bowing and greeting the old man again, Huo Yuhao walked into the dormitory building.The old man didn\u2019t move from his original position as he muttered nostalgically to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s rare to see a kid with manners.\u201dAs he muttered to himself, a few new students walked past the area. However, they clearly hadn\u2019t taken note of the old man beside the building, and directly went inside. The old man didn\u2019t stop them either. He simply sat there drowsily.After following the old man\u2019s instructions, Huo Yuhao quickly found his dorm room. The dormitory had a standard hallway layout, with both sides of the long hallway having dorm rooms with numbers etched into their doors. The passage of time was clearly visible in the dorm rooms, and it could be seen that they had been in use for an extremely long amount time. The two ends of the corridor had shared bathrooms.After using his key to open the door, a gust of slightly musty air surged out of the room. Huo Yuhao hurriedly turned to the side, waited a while, then held his breath as he charging into the room and opened the window. The room had been uninhabited for over a month, at the very minimum. A layer of dust covered the entire room.By relying on the window\u2019s ventilation, Huo Yuhao was able to clearly see the dorm room\u2019s layout. The dorm room was very small, its area only about ten square metres or so. The two beds took up a large portion of the room\u2019s floor space, but there was also a table, two metal wardrobes, as well as a lamp on the ceiling. There were also a few metal protrusions on one of the walls. Bei Bei had told him that lamps were basic soul tools that needed soulforce in order to light up. The metal protrusions were places that one could pour soulforce into.After some ventilation, the musty air within the dorm room had finally cleared up. As Huo Yuhao looked around the small room, a hard-to-describe excitement appeared in his heart. From today onwards, this would be the dorm room that he\u2019d live in for a year. From the looks of it, he\u2019d even have a dorm-mate. I\u2019ll clean up a bit first.The saying \u2018poor children can manage a house earlier on in life\u2019 was true. Although he\u2019d been born in the Duke\u2019s Mansion, Huo Yuhao\u2019s life hadn\u2019t even been as good as a commoner\u2019s. He used a little bit of his saved money to buy a basin from the student convenience store located outside the dorms, and after requesting a used cleaning rag from the shop, he immediately started to clean the dorm room.After only an hour had passed, not even a speck of dust was left under the meticulous scrutiny of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eyes. Although everything in the dorm room was still in-place, there was now a sort of fresh smell to it. Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t plan on buying any sort of bedding for himself, since the wooden bed was already enough for someone like him, who devoted all of his hard work to cultivating.He felt a bit hungry, so he enquired about the dining hall\u2019s location. After buying the cheapest lunchbox from the student convenience store, he went to the dining hall.Each year-group had a dining hall that belonged to them, which were located behind the dormitory. When Huo Yuhao walked into the freshman dining hall, he was astonished. At that moment, there weren\u2019t many people in the dining hall, making it appear extremely spacious. There wasn\u2019t even a single table; it was an entirely empty place. There was only a washbasin used to wash one\u2019s hands and tableware. The inner parts of the dining hall had windows that one could buy food from, with price tags outside them. There were a total of eight windows that increased in price from right to left, and all served different dishes.There were actually no seating areas in the dining hall? The dining hall\u2019s entrance even had the words \u2018No food is allowed to be taken from the dining hall. No exceptions.\u2019 written on it.After a brief moment of astonishment, Huo Yuhao walked towards the right-most window to buy the cheapest available food, which was stir-fried vegetables and white rice. However, he still devoured the food despite its quality. For him, having something to eat was already extremely good. Furthermore, the food\u2019s price was extremely cheap; it was only two copper coins. With his monthly income of one gold coin, he could eat for the entire month as long as he was frugal with his money.Whilst eating, Huo Yuhao observed the dining hall. He discovered that the most expensive window\u2019s food was actually priced in gold spirit coins. That was something that he didn\u2019t even dare to imagine.After quickly finishing his mealy, Huo Yuhao returned directly to his dorm. Like the saying goes, the clumsy bird needs to fly into the forest earlier. He understood the difference between himself and the other students, so he naturally couldn\u2019t waste any time.After sitting in a cross-legged position on the sturdy wooden bed, Huo Yuhao quickly entered a meditative state, and started cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique.Although his cultivation speed was far slower than Bei Bei\u2019s or Tang Ya\u2019s, he\u2019d already improved quite a bit compared to the past. After changing his cultivation technique to the Mysterious Heaven Technique, he could now at least feel a slight improvement in his cultivation as he cultivated, which was much better than his previous state. Furthermore, after the few days of cultivation that he\u2019d done during their journey back, his originally chaotic and impure soulforce had already completely turned into that of the Mysterious Heaven Technique. There was one effect of the Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s soulforce that was extremely useful for him\u2014the Mysterious Heaven Technique would nourish his passageways when he circulated it. Although he couldn\u2019t see much improvement currently, Bei Bei had told him that it would definitely improve his physique in the long run.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Every day, he\u2019d cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes in the morning, then spend two hours practicing the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks, and the Mysterious Jade Hands, as well as some grappling techniques. As for the rest of his time, other than the time he spent eating, he\u2019d use all of it to cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique.Soulforce was the foundation of a soul master. Currently, he had to use as much of his as he could to cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique.\u201cOh, this technique isn\u2019t bad at all. It\u2019s indeed quite suitable for your current state. You humans are really skilled!\u201d When Huo Yuhao had just entered his cultivation state, everything he saw suddenly turned white. The voice of the Skydream Iceworm also echoed out; he\u2019d been brought back to his spiritual sea.Huo Yuhao was slightly surprised as he called out, \u201cBrother Skydream?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm\u2019s lazy voice echoed out, \u201cYour body\u2019s condition has changed a lot during the past few days. You\u2019ve finally gotten a good start. Your body\u2019s endurance has also been gradually increasing. Not bad, not bad. The abilities that you\u2019re cultivating are suitable for you, especially this meditation technique, and that eye training technique. The four soul skills I\u2019ve given you have indeed received benefits from them. You must practice using these soul skills constantly, especially the last one. It should be very effective when combined with your eye training technique. You\u2019ve obtained a basic soul-attack skill. All in all, your condition, as of now, is slightly better than I had predicted.\u201d\u201cBrother Skydream, I\u2019ll definitely put a lot of effort into cultivating.\u201d After hearing the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s voice, Huo Yuhao reaffirmed that he\u2019d truly merged with a million-year soul beast, and that he hadn\u2019t been dreaming.The Skydream Iceworm then said, \u201cI\u2019m tired, thus I need to rest for a period of time. You should just follow your current cultivation method. When you break through, and you need a second soul ring, I\u2019ll naturally wake up. At that time, the ice-type martial soul that I bestowed you with should be able to become a full-fledged martial soul. It\u2019ll cause your strength to have a qualitative leap.\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cHow can I find you if I need to?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm said, \u201cIf you encounter any danger that you\u2019re unable to escape, I\u2019ll naturally help you out. Don\u2019t worry, I can only live while you\u2019re still alive! Alright, I\u2019m going to sleep\u2026\u201dThe white light vanished, and Huo Yuhao woke up from his meditation. To his astonishment, he found that the sky outside had already turned completely dark. He\u2019d actually cultivated for six hours\u2026 at the very least. The Mysterious Heaven Technique in his body also seemed to have had a slight improvement.It\u2019s already become night time, but I\u2019m a bit hungry. However, looking at the time, the dining halls should\u2019ve already closed. Fortunately, there were still a few more dry rations within his cloth sack. Thus, after drinking some water and allaying his hunger, Huo Yuhao continued to cultivate.After absorbing some of the mystical energy from the eastern purple qi at dawn, Huo Yuhao returned to his room to start cultivating a few of the Tang Sect\u2019s techniques. His attainments in these techniques could be said to only be superficial. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t dedicate most of his energy to this; he was just doing some light cultivation.By the time he\u2019d finished his training session, the sky outside had already turned bright. After cleaning himself up, Huo Yuhao walked over to the dining hall for some food. Once he reached the dining hall, he was somewhat concerned. Ever since he\u2019d started cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, his appetite had been rising constantly. Strengthening one\u2019s physique required sufficient nutrients, yet he had no money. His school fees had already been paid for by his eldest senior brother, how could he ask Bei Bei for more?Fortunately, there weren\u2019t many varieties of food available for breakfast. Furthermore, breakfast was also cheap. Huo Yuhao bought a few eggs and a bowl of porridge, causing him to reluctantly spend three copper coins. He\u2019d finally replenished his body\u2019s nutrients. Yesterday, he\u2019d even had the thought that the food here was cheap. However, he suddenly discovered that the price of food within Shrek Academy was actually more expensive than the food outside.\u201cJunior brother, you can\u2019t be stingy while eating; you can\u2019t lack nutrients. The school has some jobs that are within your abilities to do. You can do these jobs for your livelihood income.\u201d Unbeknownst to him, Bei Bei had arrived at Huo Yuhao\u2019s side.\u201cEldest senior brother!\u201d Huo Yuhao let out a cry of surprise. Up till now, the only people that he was able to recognise within Shrek Academy were Tang Ya and Bei Bei.Bei Bei was slightly apologetic as he said, \u201cThe reason why I haven\u2019t given you any money directly is because I hope that you can learn to rely on yourself. Combat strength is only a part of one\u2019s strength; a person\u2019s composite strength is determined by many different abilities. Of them, the most important ability is their ability to live under any circumstances. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cEldest senior brother, you\u2019ve already given me a lot of help. I understand. I still have a few silver coins as of right now, so I\u2019ll go take up some jobs after school opens.\u201dBei Bei rubbed his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go first. You must remember this: money can be earned, but you can\u2019t be stingy with your food. You must have your nutrition.\u201dHuo Yuhao followed Bei Bei as they walked out of the dining hall together. He decided to listen to his eldest senior brother\u2019s advice; he\u2019d treat himself to a meal today.When he returned to his dorm room, Huo Yuhao was surprised to discover that the door to his room was open. He felt astonished at first, before realizing the fact that his roommate might have arrived.At that moment, a youth walked out of the room. After seeing Huo Yuhao, he was also stunned.The youth had a delicate appearance, as well as fair skin. His large eyes were very unusual; they were actually a faint pinkish-blue. His settled short hair was also the same colour. His appearance seemed to be even more handsome than Bei Bei\u2019s. This was truly the most handsome person that Huo Yuhao had ever seen. His height and age didn\u2019t seem to be that different from Huo Yuhao\u2019s either.\u201cYou are?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked subconsciously.The youth was somewhat haughty as he stared at him. \u201cStep aside.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Huo Yuhao hurriedly stepped to the side. The youth walked past him, then stopped after taking a few steps out of the room. He turned around to look at Huo Yuhao as he said, \u201cYou also live in this dorm room, I assume. Since you\u2019ve cleaned this room up so well, I\u2019ll allow you to live with me for now. I have a few rules that you must remember: One, you\u2019re not allowed to randomly bring other people back to this room. Two, you\u2019re not allowed to bare your disgusting naked body in this room. Three, you\u2019re not allowed to snore at night. Four, you\u2019re not allowed to bother me. Five, you\u2019re in charge of the cleanliness of this room in the future, but you can\u2019t touch my bed. Do you understand clearly?\u201dWhen he saw the youth\u2019s arrogant appearance, Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but let his anger hit the roof. \u201cWhy must I listen to you?\u201dThe youth snorted coldly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019ll simply throw you out. If you don\u2019t believe me, you\u2019re welcome to try.\u201dHuo Yuhao had been bullied by people from the Duke\u2019s Mansion since he was young, so the people that he hated the most were these types of arrogant people. He coldly said, \u201cIf you want fight, then let\u2019s fight. Let\u2019s go outside.\u201dAs he looked at Huo Yuhao\u2019s unsubmissive appearance, the youth actually laughed. His smile was very good-looking, but the disdain and contempt in it ignited the anger in Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart even more.\u201cI still don\u2019t know your name.\u201d The youth said with disdain.Huo Yuhao spoke in a low tone, \u201cBefore asking someone elses name, shouldn\u2019t you tell me your name first?\u201dThe youth indifferently said, \u201cI\u2019m Wang Dong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Huo Yuhao.\u201dWang Dong smiled as he suddenly approached Huo Yuhao. \u201cVery good. I think that your name shall quickly disappear from Shrek Academy. Let\u2019s go, idiot.\u201d As he said this, he took the initiative to turn around and walk out of the room.Huo Yuhao\u2019s fists were tightly clenched as he followed Wang Dong with large strides. Even though he knew that his combat strength wasn\u2019t that high, he would never allow anyone to bully him again. Furthermore, this person would even be his roommate for at least a year.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Large areas of vacant land separated the buildings from one another. After Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had exited the dormitory, Wang Dong continued until he stood firmly within one of the empty spaces outside the dormitory, then turned around and beckoned Huo Yuhao towards him by curling his finger.Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart was still burning with fury, but he didn\u2019t immediately rush towards Wang Dong in anger. After undergoing a life-and-death experience in the Great Star Dou Forest, he\u2019d learned one thing at the very least, which was to stay calm no matter what.That old man who\u2019d been leaning on the chair at the dormitory\u2019s entrance raised his head slightly. A gleam of curiosity flashed through his faint yellow eyes as he gazed at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong with interest.A faint golden light flashed through Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes, and a white soul ring subsequently rose from his feet, activating his Spirit Eyes.Seeing his \u201cten year soul ring\u201d Wang Dong let out a soft laugh. \u201cI\u2019m very curious as to how you managed to enter this school. You dare to challenge me with just this bit of skill? I won\u2019t even have to use my martial soul to deal with you.\u201dAs he spoke, the tip of Wang Dong\u2019s left foot tapped the ground. His body was like an arrow as he charged towards Huo Yuhao. Not only was he fast, but appeared as if there was also an abnormal agility hidden inside his movement. He arrived before Huo Yuhao in the blink of an eye, and raised his right leg to kick him in the chest.With this raise of Wang Dong\u2019s leg, only Huo Yuhao was able to make out that Wang Dong had a pair of legs that exceeded the proportion of a normal person\u2019s. Before he realized it, the leg had already arrived in front of him.In that instant, Huo Yuhao moved. He rapidly took one step to the right whilst simultaneously using his left hand to push Wang Dong\u2019s foot away.\u201cHmm?\u201d Wang Dong clearly hadn\u2019t expected Huo Yuhao to be able to dodge his swift kick. He drew back the right leg he\u2019d used to step out with in a flash, and dodged Huo Yuhao\u2019s left hand. At the same time, he shot out another kick lightning-like speed, this time aimed towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s neck.It was as if Huo Yuhao could foresee Wang Dong\u2019s actions. When Wang Dong shot his leg out, Huo Yuhao simultaneously lowered his body and crouched down. In the next instant, his body bounced back up, and his right shoulder just happened to collide with the lower portion of Wang Dong\u2019s thigh.Both of their movements were very quick. From an outsider\u2019s point of view, it looked like Wang Dong had purposely sent his leg upwards such that Huo Yuhao could use his shoulder to push it up further.It had to be said that Wang Dong\u2019s body was extremely strong. A normal person would\u2019ve had their center of balance destabilized after having their thigh pushed up like that. However, Wang Dong\u2019s right leg was instead actually raised up over him, as he did a split. His left leg was still firmly planted on the ground.Huo Yuhao felt a burst of both softness and elasticity from the shoulder he\u2019d used to bump into Wang Dong\u2019s thigh with. He didn\u2019t let Wang Dong regain the upper hand as he rapidly charged forwards, immediately ramming into Wang Dong in an attempt to take advantage of him while he was still standing on one leg.Facing Huo Yuhao, who\u2019d been dogging his heels till this point, Wang Dong made an astonishing movement. His right leg was still raised up in the air as he shockingly continued to move it upwards behind him, along with the upper half of his body. At the same time, his left leg shot out towards Huo Yuhao. In that moment, the width at which his legs were spread out had already completely exceeded the limits that normal people were capable of imagining.Although Huo Yuhao had relied on his Spirit Eyes\u2019 spiritual detection skill to accurately ascertain Wang Dong\u2019s previous attacks, he\u2019d already moved. Thus, he wasn\u2019t able to withdraw even though he\u2019d sensed Wang Dong\u2019s movements.One was bound to have a certain amount of advantage over their opponent when they could anticipate their opponent\u2019s movements. When Huo Yuhao saw that Wang Dong\u2019s left leg had sprung up towards his chin, both of Huo Yuhao\u2019s hands simultaneously made a downwards pressing motion, colliding with his left leg.\u201cBang\u2014\u2014\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s strength was exceptional. His leg carried a powerful vibration that was difficult to describe. Huo Yuhao felt a burst of numbness from both of his palms, causing him to subconsciously activate the Mysterious Jade Hands technique. Despite him doing so, he still ended up staggering back in retreat.Wang Dong\u2019s right leg that had fallen backwards only touched the ground lightly before his left leg that had been lifted up landed on the ground again, causing his whole body to flip over once again. Wang Dong\u2019s right leg resembled a whip as it went straight down towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulder with a whooshing sound. He was evidently infuriated that Huo Yuhao had previously pushed his thigh up.Huo Yuhao, who was in the process of retreating, reacted the instant Wang Dong\u2019s right leg touched the ground, bouncing backwards. Huo Yuhao\u2019s footsteps suddenly became quick, and with a sway of his figure, he rapidly headed towards Wang Dong\u2019s left side, getting out of the way of her strike.\u201cBang\u2014\u2014\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s right leg that had whipped downwards hit the ground ferociously. He actually left a shallow footprint on the hard stone ground. Following closely after that, his whole body became like a windmill as he charged towards Huo Yuhao. Both of his legs were like two maces as he unleashed an attack akin to like howling winds and torrential rains in Huo Yuhao\u2019s direction.Despite the surprise he\u2019d received after going through their previous confrontation, Huo Yuhao had calmed down at this moment. He activated his Spiritual Detection ability in an area around him, and calmly determined every single one of Wang Dong\u2019s attacks in advance. Under Wang Dong\u2019s fierce attacks, the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks that he knew very little about was like a small boat that was battered on the left and right, yet refused to capsize.Wang Dong was also becoming more and more apprehensive as he fought with Huo Yuhao. He could clearly sense that Huo Yuhao\u2019s strength was far worse than his own. Regardless of whether it was his speed or strength, all of them were completely inferior to his own. However, his attacks still weren\u2019t able to land on Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao wasn\u2019t quick, yet he was always able to clearly discern his movements beforehand, and was thereby able to effectively evade his attacks. Wang Dong had already attempted to make a feint, but had still been unable to deceive his opponent.Not only was Wang Dong arrogant, he was extremely stubborn too. Since they\u2019d agreed to not use their martial soul, he definitely wouldn\u2019t use his. He could only continue to intensify his attacks, not believing that Huo Yuhao could continue to persevere.Indeed, Huo Yuhao had already reached the point of being unable to persevere for much longer. Not only were the attacks from Wang Dong\u2019s legs powerful to the point that he almost couldn\u2019t withstand them, but the speed at which he attacked was also unusually fast. He could only barely contend against Wang Dong while relying on his Spiritual Detection, under the condition that he was fully concentrated on the fight. However, as time passed, the disparity between the basic structures of their bodies gradually appeared.Huo Yuhao had lived an arduous life since his childhood, and was malnourished. As such, the nourishment that the Mysterious Heaven Technique had provided to his body with had also just begun. Compared to Wang Dong, who had deep-rooted fundamentals, he was far worse in terms of his body\u2019s development. Even though he\u2019d utilised his martial soul, and even though Wang Dong still hadn\u2019t, the nourishment that his soulforce provided was solely in regards to his internals. After they\u2019d fought for a long time, it was inevitable that minute mistakes would emerge on Huo Yuhao\u2019s end. Both of Wang Dong\u2019s legs had only accurately swept at his side a few times, but his body was already experiencing a scorching pain. The Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks that he knew very little about had also started to become messy, and he became more and more passive.This won\u2019t do. If things continue on in this manner, I\u2019ll definitely lose. Huo Yuhao retreated as fast as he could, as soon, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep avoiding Wang Dong\u2019s attacks.Suddenly, he raised his head without notice. Since this movement was quite large, Wang Dong also subconsciously looked at his face. He clearly saw a hint of purple flashed through both of Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes. Immediately following this, Wang Dong felt like his brain had been pricked by a needle and, with a sharp pain, his mind momentarily became blank.How could Huo Yuhao let this kind of opportunity slip by? He suddenly pounced forwards with a large stride forwards. He leapt up, and both of his arms wrapped tightly around both of Wang Dong\u2019s arms. Both of his legs then wound themselves around Wang Dong\u2019s waist, forcibly knocking him to the ground.Wang Dong had always used his legs when commencing his attacks. At this moment, Huo Yuhao was quite anxious. With his legs wrapped around Wang Dong\u2019s waist, how could he exert any force? As long as he continued to subdue Wang Dong, everything would be fine. Huo Yuhao could only subdue him and hope that everything would be fine.The stabbing pain in his brain caused Wang Dong to tightly furrow his eyebrows. However, that only lasted for a couple seconds before he became clear-headed once again. Nevertheless, Huo Yuhao had already knocked his body to the ground. His waist was tightly locked between Huo Yuhao\u2019s legs, and his arms were also bound by Huo Yuhao. The distance that separated their faces was no more than an inch, and they could hear each other\u2019s breathing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let me go!\u201d Wang Dong flew into a rage and forcefully struggled against Huo Yuhao\u2019s grip. However, Huo Yuhao was using all of his strength to restrain him, and had even incorporated his soulforce. Under the circumstances, and considering that he couldn\u2019t use his martial soul, escaping wasn\u2019t easy for him at all.\u201cAre you still not admitting your loss? If I\u2019d used a blade earlier, you\u2019d already be dead.\u201d Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t show any weaknesses at all as he let out a low roar. At that moment, while his body was in close contact to Wang Dong\u2019s, he found out that Wang Dong\u2019s body wasn\u2019t only extremely soft, but was also quite elastic. Furthermore, it even had a sort of gentle feeling to it. His body was also unexpectedly releasing a faintly fresh aroma that smelled extremely nice.After hearing his words, Wang Dong was stunned. His resistance against Huo Yuhao\u2019s grip instantly decreased. He was right! the stabbing pain in his head and his previous dizziness hadn\u2019t lasted long earlier, but since the two of them had been so close, Huo Yuhao would have definitely had enough time to hurt him if he\u2019d wanted to.\u201cI\u2019ve lost. Quickly get off me.\u201d Wang Dong said angrily. His eyes were filled with a look of hate and denial.However, Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t release him. Instead, he coldly replied, \u201cThe five conditions that you previously set aren\u2019t something that I\u2019m unwilling to do, however, I\u2019m not doing it because of your threats, but because of the respect I have for a roommate. I know that you\u2019re stronger than me, and that I definitely wouldn\u2019t be your match if we were both to use our martial souls. However, remember this: If you dare to humiliate me again, then even if I\u2019m beaten to death by you, I\u2019ll definitely make sure you pay the price.\u201dWhen he saw Huo Yuhao\u2019s increasing viciousness, which got to the point that felt like he was looking into the eyes of a blood-thirsty soul beast, the hate in Wang Dong\u2019s eyes dissipated. What replaced it was a slightly dismayed look. In the field of strength, Huo Yuhao was clearly a lot weaker than him, but in the field of imposingness, he\u2019d completely lost.Huo Yuhao slowly released Wang Dong and stood up. While facing Wang Dong, he retreated a few steps. Then, he turned around, and headed back towards their dorm room.Wang Dong sat dazedly on the ground for a while, before finally standing up again. Then, he slowly walked towards their dorm room as well. When he arrived at the dorm\u2019s main entrance, the voice of an old man echoed out, \u201cYou have indeed lost. Not just in battle, but even your heart has lost.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Wang Dong suddenly turned around to gaze at the old man. With an unresigned look on his face, he replied, \u201cI\u2019m clearly stronger than him. If I were to really fight against him, he wouldn\u2019t have even been able to touch me. In which way did he achieve victory over me?\u201dThe old man pointed towards his own heart, \u201cOn the basis of this. He has a fearless heart, while you lack one. Not being afraid of death isn\u2019t something that just anyone can do.\u201dWang Dong was stunned. After a while, he bowed deeply towards the old man. \u201cGrandpa, thank you for your advice.\u201d After speaking, he walked towards the dorm room with large strides.Upon his return to the dorm room, Wang Dong saw Huo Yuhao, who\u2019d already begun to meditate on his wooden bed. He wanted to say something, but in the end, he held it in. After letting out a snort, he made his bed.Compared to Huo Yuhao\u2019s poverty-stricken conditions, Wang Dong\u2019s bed was set up with a thick fur mattress that had been made from the fur of some unknown soul beast. It looked thick and soft. Furthermore, he even had a soft quilt. His luggage had already filled the wardrobe beside him, but there were still many things left out on his table. Wang Dong seemed to be too lazy to finish unpacking, instead pulling the quilt over his head to sleep with feeling of injustice.Over the following two days, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong minded their own business, and did their own things without bothering one another. The thing that astonished Wang Dong the most was that Huo Yuhao seemed to be in a cultivation state at all times, except for when he was eating. He could faintly sense the strength of Huo Yuhao\u2019s soulforce, but the more he sensed it, the more incredulous he felt. Just by relying on his strength, how was able to beat me?The admission period for new students finally ended, and the freshmen dormitory also became lively. Although the rooms weren\u2019t big, they could still fit two people in them. It was very noisy outside, but the sound-proofing abilities of the dorm rooms were very good.Huo Yuhao had been cultivating incessantly during these past few days. His previous fight with Wang Dong had inspired him quite a bit. The reason that he\u2019d previously been able to overcome his opponent, and was able to achieve victory, was because he\u2019d relied on the skill that the Skydream Iceworm had given him after awakening.Iceworms truly weren\u2019t very strong soul beasts; the four soul skills that the million-year Skydream Iceworm had bestowed on Huo Yuhao weren\u2019t very strong either. They were, respectively: Spiritual Detection, Spiritual Sharing, Spiritual Interference, and Spirit Shock.Huo Yuhao was relatively more skilled with the first two skills, and had already verified their impressiveness with Bei Bei. On the other hand, Spiritual Interference was a domain-type skill that could interfere with all living creatures inside a fifteen metre radius of Huo Yuhao, who would produce spiritual undulations. However, the strength of its interference wasn\u2019t high. With his current level of cultivation, the most he could do was make people turn absent-minded for a moment. Furthermore, he wasn\u2019t even able to maintain the skill for a full three seconds; the soulforce consumption was much higher than his previous two skills.Spirit Shock was the only skill among the four that had even a tiny bit of attack power. Since it was a single-target skill, the strength of its attack was slightly stronger than the domain-type Spiritual Interference. However, it wasn\u2019t much stronger than it either. The reason that Huo Yuhao had been able to overcome Wang Dong and achieve victory in that fight was because he\u2019d combined Spirit Shock with his Purple Demon Eyes. The combined effect of the two was even better than he\u2019d imagined. Naturally, this was also because Wang Dong hadn\u2019t been able to put up any defenses due to the sudden nature of the attack. If he\u2019d made any preparations, the strength of his Spirit Shock would\u2019ve been heavily reduced.However, no matter what way you put it, Huo Yuhao finally had the basic requirements to become a control-type soul master by relying with these four spiritual-type skills. However, his eldest senior brother had previously told him that new students wouldn\u2019t be separated into departments during their first year. Everything could be done after he\u2019d survived their first year.\u201cOi, class starts today. Are you still going to sit there like a fool?\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s voice roused Huo Yuhao from his pondering state. He\u2019d just returned from his breakfast, and was planning to cultivate for a while.\u201cClass is starting?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked subconsciously. This was their first conversation after their fight.Wang Dong didn\u2019t even look at him as he indifferently replied, \u201cThere\u2019s still an hour left.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d After Huo Yuhao responded, he shut his eyes and began to meditate. After his hard work during these few days, his familiarity with the Mysterious Heaven Technique had increased a bit. An hour was enough for him to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique through an entire cycle, which would allow his soulforce to improve by a small step.Wang Dong didn\u2019t even listen to his reply. When he turned back to look at Huo Yuhao, he discovered that he\u2019d actually started to meditate again, causing him to involuntarily murmur to himself, \u201cTruly a lunatic.\u201d When he finished speaking, he left the dorm room without even looking back. During these past two days, he\u2019d never seen Huo Yuhao lie down to sleep.The large gates of the white teaching area were opened wide, and the new students who were now wearing white-coloured school uniforms walked inside in single file. Everyone\u2019s clothing had the symbol of a small green monster on their left breast pocket, which was the symbol of Shrek Academy.Students from different year groups had uniforms of different colours; they had uniforms that were the same colour as their teaching areas.As Huo Yuhao rushed towards the new student\u2019s teaching area, he was just in time to hear the ringing of the bell. He rapidly rushed inside and saw the sign for Class 1 on the first room to the left on the first floor, causing him to immediately dash inside without any hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because Huo Yuhao arrived at the last moment, the number of seats left for him to choose from were very little. He barely managed to find a seat with great difficulty. His deskmate was a relatively pretty young lady. However, this young lady\u2019s appearance was somewhat similar to Wang Dong\u2019s when he\u2019d first met him. She had a haughty look on her face when she raised her head, and didn\u2019t even spare him a glance.Huo Yuhao only managed to observe the surrounding situation after he\u2019d sat down. The classroom was very large\u2014there were a full hundred people who were in the same class as him. Following the idea that there were roughly a thousand freshman students, there should be roughly ten freshman classes or so.He quickly found Wang Dong, simply because Wang Dong\u2019s looks were too outstanding. The people sitting around him were actually all girls, and none of them were weaker than the female student that sat beside Huo Yuhao in terms of appearance.At that moment, a person walked in the classroom\u2019s door. It was an old lady with wrinkled skin and shriveled hair. Her grizzled hair had been rolled into a bun, and she wore set of white robes. Furthermore, her body\u2019s figure was average in size. The most unusual thing about her were her extremely bright eyes, which seemed to radiate light from her black pupils.Huo Yuhao\u2019s martial soul was his Spirit Eyes. As a result of this, he was especially sensitive to the eyes of others. He could sense a strong level of spiritual suppression from this old woman\u2019s eyes.Even though the old woman was very old, her back was ramrod straight as she walked towards the speaking platform. There was no doubt about it; she was definitely the teacher of this freshman class.When they saw the teacher enter, the previously disorderly class immediately quieted down, and their gazes all gathered on the speaking platform.The old woman\u2019s gaze calmly swept across the crowd from left to right, immediately causing everyone to feel her gaze raking over them, which in turn caused a formless pressure to appear in their hearts.\u201cI am Zhou Yi, and am the teacher in charge of your class. I\u2019m not sure how many of you will be able to keep up with me for the following year, but I have to tell you something: in my class, trash can\u2019t pass my assessments. I want to cultivate monsters, not idiots.\u201dTeacher Zhou\u2019s voice had a kind of extremely unpleasant rasp to it; it resembled a broken gong.When they heard her words, an extremely angry look appeared on the faces of many students. They had passed the entrance assessment that enabled them to become students of Shrek Academy, and had been carefully selected from various countries on the continent. Amongst their peers, the word \u2018elite\u2019 could absolutely be used to describe them. However, they had turned into \u2018trash\u2019 and \u2018idiots\u2019 under the words of this Teacher Zhou.However, Huo Yuhao was extremely calm. When he saw this Teacher Zhou, he recalled the words of his eldest senior brother and Teacher Xiao Ya. This Teacher Zhou was very strict, and had a bad temper, but she truly had ability.\u201cThose who\u2019ve gotten into a fight during these past few days of enrollment, stand up.\u201d Zhou Yi\u2019s following sentence stunned the entire class once again.They\u2019d just been enrolled, who would have the free time to start a fight in the academy? Even if they had fought, who\u2019d admit to it?As the entire class remained silent, only a single person stood up. It was Huo Yuhao. He didn\u2019t stand up because he was honest, but because he faintly sensed that this Teacher Zhou wasn\u2019t a person who\u2019d play her cards according to common sense.Seeing Huo Yuhao stand up, Wang Dong let out a \u2018humph\u2019. Not willing to be outdone, he also stood up.Of the entire class of a hundred students, only two had stood up. They immediately became \u2018cranes in a flock of chickens\u2019 as they became the focus of the entire class\u2019s attention.\u201cOnly two?\u201d Zhou Yi raised her eyebrows. \u201cTruly a group of trash. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know that not daring to provoke others is a sign of mediocrity? Other than these two, everyone else go outside and run a hundred laps around Shrek Plaza. Anyone who can\u2019t finish these one hundred laps will be directly expelled.\u201dOnce she spoke, the whole class flew into an uproar. This was only their first day of school, and class hadn\u2019t even begun yet. Who could accept the fact that they were actually being punished for not fighting?One of the students immediately stood up. \u201cTeacher, I refuse to accept this. Why do we have to be punished for not fighting?\u201dZhou Yi indifferently replied, \u201cBecause I said so. If you\u2019re not willing to accept this, you can screw off. As a teacher, I have the authority to expel any student I want. I\u2019ll give you one minute. If I don\u2019t see all of you running around Shrek Plaza within that minute, all of you will be expelled.\u201dAs she spoke, a terrifying aura was suddenly released from her body. The powerful soulforce undulations caused every single student to be choked by the pressure. Following that, soul rings started to rise from Zhou Yi\u2019s feet.Two yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings burst forth with a strong aura that was hard to describe. This Teacher Zhou was actually a Soul Emperor-level expert, and furthermore, she had two ten thousand year soul rings. If she wanted to take care of the hundred students in front of her, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that it would be as easy as turning her palm over.These students were only freshmen, after all. Under the strong pressure, just who would dare to resist? All of them dejectedly walked out the door. Zhou Yi withdrew her soul rings after releasing them, and her eyes followed the students out of the classroom as she gazed at them expressionlessly.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a reminder: you only have two hours. After two hours, the people who haven\u2019t finished the hundred laps will be considered to be unqualified. This is your first test after entering the academy, and those unqualified will be expelled.\u201dWhen they heard her words, the students\u2019 movements immediately sped up. They quickly ran to the field after leaving the classroom.Wang Dong was slightly astonished as he glanced at Huo Yuhao. At that moment, only the two of them were left in the class. Zhou Yi\u2019s expression seemed to have become much warmer as she beckoned towards them.Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao walked towards her together.Looking at the two of them, Zhou Yi nodded her head in a satisfied manner. Then, she said, \u201cNot bad, at least two of you have some guts. Tell me, who did you fight with, and why did you fight with them?\u201dWang Dong was just about to speak, but Huo Yuhao interjected, \u201cReporting to the teacher, we are roommates. We had a small conflict due to our opposing views.\u201dZhou Yi seemed to be very interested as she said, \u201cOh? You\u2019re even roommates. Fighting is good, but fighting between roommates is the best kind of fighting. You\u2019ll have competition this way, and you\u2019ll also be able to improve together.\u201dAs they stood in front of Zhou Yi, both Huo Yuhao or Wang Dong felt their backs become cool as their backs become covered in cold sweat. Just now, this Teacher Zhou had simply been too domineering. Furthermore, she really didn\u2019t play her cards according to common sense! Her way of thinking was entirely different from an ordinary person\u2019s. She was truly deserving of the title that Bei Bei had called her by, the \u2018Monstrous Teacher\u2019.A trace of a smile that was even uglier than one\u2019s crying face appeared on Zhou Yi\u2019s face. Her aged face even seemed to twitch. \u201cFighting is a good thing, but I don\u2019t really like fighting amongst my own students. Remember, you should fight with students from other classes if you want to start a fight. Our Shrek Academy\u2019s rules have always been relaxed, and this is for the sake of developing individuality within our students. Thus, we\u2019ve always turned a blind eye towards the issue of fighting. However, there are certain limits to this, which I\u2019ll tell you about. Students from higher year groups aren\u2019t allowed to provoke or attack students from lower year groups. If we find out that someone has done this, the punishment is immediate expulsion. However, students from lower year groups can challenge older students, but this requires the presence of a teacher, to ensure the fact that older students aren\u2019t simply bullying the younger students. As for students of the same year group, you can fight as you wish. As long as you don\u2019t cause any fatal wounds, the school won\u2019t interfere at all. Honestly, fighting is an exceptionally good way of increasing your strength.\u201d\u201cIf you can reach your second year, you can go to the Soul Duelling Arena to fight. If you win a lot, the school will even reward you. However for now, you two can go run outside with the others.\u201dWang Dong was stunned. \u201cTeacher, didn\u2019t you say that we had guts?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

School has only just started, yet you\u2019ve already fought with your roommate. You two really have future prospects. Thus, since you two have so many future prospects, the difficulty of your test should be harder than that of the other\u2019s. Moreover, you two of you should share both delight and hardship with your fellow students. The amount of time you two have to finish those one hundred laps will be the same as the others. Look, a moment has already passed while you two weren\u2019t being careful!\u201dWang Dong still wanted to say something, but he was pulled away by Huo Yuhao, who didn\u2019t hesitate to turn around and run outside.Although Wang Dong felt somewhat depressed, he still followed Huo Yuhao out to run. \u201cWhat\u2019d you pull me away for? This \u2018Teacher Zhou\u2019 is truly a lunatic.\u201dHuo Yuhao unhappily replied, \u201cCan you beat her in a verbal battle? Can you beat her in a fight? If you can\u2019t do either of these things, and you still want to stay in Shrek Academy, then you\u2019ll have to follow her orders. Quickly run, I believe that her earlier words about expelling anyone who\u2019s unable to finish a hundred laps aren\u2019t false at all.\u201dShrek Plaza was right outside the freshman school building. It wasn\u2019t considered too big; a single lap was roughly three hundred metres or so. To normal people, running a hundred laps around the plaza was definitely not a simple task. However, to these young students who had the foundation of a soul master, it wasn\u2019t actually that hard. As long as they ran seriously, they\u2019d manage to finish running their hundred laps within two hours.After Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had joined the \u2018great army\u2019 of running, many sounds of schadenfreude immediately echoed out. However, the two people didn\u2019t even bother to care about them. They were already behind by fifteen minutes, so they had to make the most of every minute that they had.Whilst running, Wang Dong suddenly asked Huo Yuhao, \u201cWhat skill did you use to beat me that day? I still haven\u2019t been able to figure it out. Could it be that your martial soul is a spiritual-type martial soul?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded.Wang Dong was stunned, \u201cIt\u2019s really a spiritual-type martial soul! No wonder I couldn\u2019t see what your martial soul was after you\u2019d used your soul ring. At least my loss can\u2019t be considered too much of an injustice.\u201dHuo Yuhao felt slightly helpless as he replied, \u201cYou\u2019re too arrogant. If you\u2019d also used your martial soul, I would\u2019ve definitely had no chance at all. I can sense that your soulforce is much stronger than mine.\u201dWang Dong was slightly pleased as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s obvious. Amongst this year\u2019s freshmen, the number of students who can compare with me in terms of strength are as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. You merely have a single ten year soul ring, thus you\u2019re naturally not my opponent.\u201dHuo Yuhao disliked Wang Dong\u2019s arrogant appearance. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you just lost to that \u2018ten year soul ring\u2019.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Wang Dong unhappily replied, \u201cI get it, let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. Seeing that you protected me in front of that perverted teacher, I\u2019ll consider the previous matter settled. In the future, I\u2019ll take care of you. If anyone wants to bully you, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201dHuo Yuhao was left speechless. \u201cI don\u2019t need your protection.\u201d After saying this, he sped up his pace and ran forward.Wang Dong followed Huo Yuhao as he sped up. The physical fitness of his body was much better than Huo Yuhao\u2019s, so keeping up with his increase in speed was effortless to him.Wang Dong was slightly dissatisfied as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re too unreasonable!\u201dHuo Yuhao glared at him and replied, \u201cIf you\u2019d treat me as a student on equal terms, you wouldn\u2019t have to have this kind of feeling.\u201dWang Dong curled his lip. \u201cSince I was young, there\u2019s never been someone the same age as me who was able to make me treat them as an equal.\u201dHuo Yuhao humphed, and stopped looking at him. \u201cWhen words get sour, adding extra words is meaningless.\u201dWang Dong also stopped talking. He suddenly sped up, overtaking Huo Yuhao as he used an astonishing speed to run around Shrek Plaza.It had to be said that even though Wang Dong was arrogant, his cultivation truly stood out from the masses. Furthermore, his physical fitness was extremely strong. Once he\u2019d sped up, there was no one from Class 1 who could actually catch up to him.At that moment, Zhou Yi had already arrived beside Shrek Plaza. She simply stood there as she calmly watched the students run. Her gaze was quickly attracted to Wang Dong, and her gaze changed slightly before returning to normal.Time quickly passed. As the number of completed laps increased, the breathing of the running students gradually became rougher. The physical fitness and cultivation level of the students was revealed at this moment. Zhou Yi had never said that they were prohibited from using the assistance of soulforce, so everyone had started using soulforce to recover their physical strength in order to continue their long-distance running.There were more than ten people running at the very front of the group; their speed wasn\u2019t slow at all. Of the group, the leader was Wang Dong. Although he\u2019d come out late, he\u2019d managed to catch up to the people who had the most laps completed within an hour. He\u2019d even overtaken them. Just looking at his appearance, he didn\u2019t seem to have used up much energy; his speed hadn\u2019t decreased at all the entire time.After the people at the front of the class, there was a large group of students. There were at least seventy students within this group, and they all ran at a relatively even speed. Running didn\u2019t seem to be too exhausting for them. Looking at their speed, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for them to complete a hundred laps within their two allotted hours.Behind them were still more than ten students who\u2019d been left behind in the back. Huo Yuhao was amongst this group. For the sake of catching up to the students in front, Huo Yuhao had used a very quick speed to start running as soon as he\u2019d started. However, the drain on his physical strength had started increasing as soon as he finished running twenty or so laps. Not only was he the last person in the class, the number of laps that he\u2019d run was even fewer than the others, due to him having started fifteen minutes later.More than half of the total time had already passed when Zhou Yi\u2019s voice suddenly echoed out in everyone\u2019s ears, \u201cSpeed up and use my location as the finishing point.\u201dIn the middle of her speaking, Wang Dong had swept past her with a \u201cswoosh\u201d, becoming the first person to complete the hundred laps.After using an extremely fast speed to finish the hundred laps, Wang Dong\u2019s handsome face had also turned rosy. He panted slightly as he slowed his pace, and he finally stopped after he\u2019d walked another lap around the plaza.Gradually, more and more students began to complete their hundred laps after Wang Dong. At this moment, there were still fifteen minutes left until the two hours were up.After Wang Dong stopped, his gaze quickly landed on Huo Yuhao, who was running at the back. He couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brow as he muttered to himself, \u201cHow did I lose to him\u2026?\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s speed had already become much slower than his starting speed. His school uniform was soaked with sweat, and since his martial soul was a spiritual-type martial soul, the help that his soulforce provided to his body was smaller than normal. If it weren\u2019t for him cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, he would\u2019ve been in an even worse state.If Huo Yuhao had had the full two hours to complete the hundred laps, he could\u2019ve still persevered and completed them, albeit with much difficulty. However, after Zhou Yi delaying him earlier, it was just too difficult for him. Deliberately increasing his speed had substantially drained his physical strength. At this moment, he was three laps behind the students next to him, and was still twenty laps away from the hundred laps. Running twenty laps within fifteen minutes was something that was nearly impossible for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t get disqualified.\u201d Huo Yuhao clenched his teeth tightly and sped up his footsteps again. For the sake of clearing up his tired mind, he even activated his soulforce and released a Spirit Shock that was aimed towards himself. The intense pain in his mind also stimulated his bodily functions, and sure enough, his speed increased by a bit once again, allowing him to overtake the few people at the very back of the group.Zhou Yi quietly stood there. She didn\u2019t pay attention to the students who\u2019d already finished their laps. Instead, her gaze fell upon the students who hadn\u2019t completed their laps.Out of these students, the one who had the most tired expression was Huo Yuhao. His uniform, which had already been soaked with sweat, wasn\u2019t something that could be faked! However, he clenched his teeth tightly as he strenuously persevered.Time rapidly passed, and Huo Yuhao persevered for another eight laps. At this moment, there was only five minutes left until the end of the two hours. Along with Huo Yuhao, there were seven other people who hadn\u2019t finished running. However, they seemed to only have three to five laps left. Furthermore, they\u2019d already started to use all of their strength to increase their speed. There was still a chance that they\u2019d finish on time. However, Huo Yuhao still needed to twelve more laps!At that moment, a figure suddenly rushed out from the middle of Shrek Plaza. It landed behind Huo Yuhao, and caught up to him in just a few steps. Following that, a scene which stunned everyone present appeared.A pair of blue butterfly wings suddenly spread out from the back of the person that was chasing after Huo Yuhao. The tips of each wing unceasingly changed between deep blue, azure, and light blue, while the surface of each wing was similar to a bright, V-shaped halo that had been embedded within the blue sky that in turn brought light to the human realm. Its shape and colour were incomparably and flawlessly beautiful.\u201cAh\u2014\u201d When such a gorgeous pair of wings suddenly appeared, the shock that it brought to everyone was simply too great. Practically all of the students, regardless of whether they were boys or girls, let out a cry.That pair of wings was simply too beautiful. Its surface resembled white spouts surging from the azure ocean. The patterns on it, as well as its colour, were extremely magnificent. When it was azure, the entire surface of the wing resembled a bright halo embedded within the blue sky. It occasionally turned deep blue, azure, and then light blue. The white patterns of light on both wings were like pearls that had been embedded within them; they had a bright luster that was extremely enchanting.Although the wings were only an illusory shadow, it caused everyone present to have a stunned and dazzled feeling under their illumination. Even Zhou Yi, who was a teacher, felt the same.After the figure had released its butterfly wings, it stuck to Huo Yuhao from behind. It hugged Huo Yuhao underneath his armpits, and the wings on its back suddenly began to flap. Just like that, it actually brought them both into the sky.Huo Yuhao was also shocked. He unconsciously turned around to see who it was, allowing him to see Wang Dong\u2019s handsome face.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cYou what? Why haven\u2019t you circulated your soulforce to make your body lighter?\u201d Wang Dong flapped his pair of beautiful wings as he spoke, causing them to suddenly speed up. He then took Huo Yuhao with him as he flew around Shrek Plaza at high speed.Huo Yuhao was also stunned by the pair of wings on Wang Dong\u2019s back. Too beautiful, they were really too beautiful! Was this his martial soul? Huo Yuhao could even sense the V-shaped patterns on Wang Dong\u2019s wings absorbing the warmth of the sunlight. Without mentioning this, just a martial soul that had the ability to fly was already a considerably strong existence. Furthermore, there was a saying in the natural world: beautiful martial souls were always stronger!A trace of satisfaction was apparent inside of Zhou Yi\u2019s astonishment as she spoke to herself, \u201cRadiant Butterfly Goddess? The continent\u2019s most beautiful butterfly martial soul? Good, very good. At least not all of them have disappointed me.\u201dWang Dong\u2019s flying speed was very fast. With his speed, completing twelve laps within five minutes wasn\u2019t an impossible task anymore. When the two simultaneously landed after finishing Huo Yuhao\u2019s last lap, they couldn\u2019t help but stumble. Huo Yuhao hurriedly turned around and supported Wang Dong. However, he also fell backwards, causing Wang Dong to fall on top of him.Although Wang Dong\u2019s cultivation couldn\u2019t be considered weak amongst his peers, he was still a child! After over three thousand metres whilst carrying Huo Yuhao, his soulforce had been slightly overdrafted. Once he landed, the pair of dazzling wings on his back were withdrawn into his body. His expression had also become pale.Huo Yuhao was crushed under Wang Dong\u2019s body, but the trace of a smile still appeared on his face. \u201cThanks. I crushed you last time, and you crushed me back this time.\u201dWang Dong crawled back up with a look of revulsion on his face. \u201cYou stinking brat, do you think I want to be on top of you?\u201dHuo Yuhao wasn\u2019t angered by what Wang Dong said as he crawled up along with him. Whilst panting heavily, he gave Wang Dong a thumbs-up.Wang Dong was stunned for a moment. Then, he nodded his head and gave him a thumbs-up in reply. Following that, the two people couldn\u2019t help but smile. Their previous grudges had also completely disappeared at this moment.All of the students had completed a hundred laps within the stipulated time. They were now standing in the middle of Shrek Plaza, resting.Zhou Yi expressionlessly turned towards the students as she indifferently said, \u201cThe people whose names I call, step forward. Cheng Cheng, Qiu Jianrao, Tang Dao, Shangguan Chentian, Lin Zeyu, Zhuge Yun, Tai Long, Tang Ling, and Yun Xiaopiao.\u201dA total of nine students were called out by her. The students had clearly never expected Zhou Yi to be able to actually call out the names of nine students, even though they hadn\u2019t given any self-introductions.The students who were called out slowly stepped forward.Zhou Yi indifferently said, \u201cYou nine can go pack your luggage and leave the academy. From this moment forth, you\u2019re no longer students of Shrek Academy.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d The nine students who were still tired from running were immediately astonished, while the other students erupted into an uproar.\u201cTeacher, why?\u201d The tall youth named Tai Long stepped forward with an angry look on his face. Out of the students who\u2019d completed their hundred laps, he\u2019d been in the first group of people; he was one of the first people that had finished.Zhou Yi coldly replied, \u201cShrek Academy doesn\u2019t need students who\u2019re full of tricks. If we cultivate a person like you, who has strength but not a good and upright attitude, the only thing you\u2019ll bring to any country is catastrophe, not help. Tai Long, say it yourself, did you run the full hundred laps just now?\u201d\u201cI naturally ran enough.\u201d Tai Long protested.Zhou Yi laughed. \u201cYou ran enough? If my memory serves me right, when everyone started running, you unhurriedly walked two laps due to the fact that I hadn\u2019t arrived at Shrek Plaza yet. You only started to catch up when the leading group were on their fifth laps. Because of this, you didn\u2019t run a full one hundred laps, but ninety-seven. I believe that I\u2019m not the only person who saw your laziness in the beginning.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Tai Long\u2019s face immediately turned bright red. He never thought that Zhou Yi, who hadn\u2019t come out to the field at the beginning, would be able to reveal his crafty tricks as if she\u2019d seen them personally. \u201cBut, just because I ran a few laps less\u2026 you can\u2019t expel me because of this!\u201dZhou Yi snorted disdainfully. \u201cI\u2019ve already explained the reason why I\u2019m expelling you. You\u2019re not suitable to be called a student of Shrek Academy. Pack your bags and screw off.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In reality, running a hundred laps or so wasn\u2019t a problem at all for him, with his strength. His cultivation was even ranked amongst the best of all the students in Class 1. However, he\u2019d never expected that he\u2019d be eliminated like this.Zhou Yi looked towards the other students and spoke indifferently, \u201cAlthough I have a bad temper, I definitely keep my promises. The nine people who I called out all cheated whilst running, and did not complete their hundred laps. If you\u2019re unhappy with it, you can go and report me to the education administration. But for now, you can leave.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhou, I refuse to accept this. He didn\u2019t run a hundred laps just now; he only managed to finish with someone else\u2019s help. Why isn\u2019t he being eliminated?\u201d Another eliminated student named Lin Zeyu spoke furiously whilst pointing towards Huo Yuhao.Zhou Yi laughed, \u201cYou refuse to accept it? \u2018He\u2019 is named Huo Yuhao. And if \u2018he\u2019 hadn\u2019t finished running a hundred laps, he\u2019d be amongst you right now. I will not change what I\u2019ve said. He finished a hundred laps. I never said that helping others was forbidden. Wang Dong helped him, something that he did voluntarily. If someone willingly helped you whilst you were running, that would\u2019ve been fine too. But did anyone help you? I don\u2019t look at the process, only at the results. And the results were: Huo Yuhao completed a hundred laps, while you did not. Quickly screw off. If you make me any angrier, I\u2019ll waste your martial souls.\u201dUnder Zhou Yi\u2019s powerful might, the nine students who\u2019d been called out could do nothing but dejectedly walk away. They obviously weren\u2019t going to pack their luggage, but were instead going straight towards the educational administration to lodge a complaint. This was only the first day of school! How could they accept this?The sweat on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body increased as he personally watched Zhou Yi impartially expel the nine students. It would\u2019ve been weird if he didn\u2019t feel nervous. If it weren\u2019t for Wang Dong\u2019s help, he would\u2019ve been with those people! When he thought about this, he couldn\u2019t help but shoot a grateful glance towards Wang Dong.The remaining students\u2019 expressions had completely changed; they didn\u2019t even dare to breathe heavily whilst looking at Zhou Yi. It had only been two hours, yet Zhou Yi had already established her absolute authority over Class 1.\u201cGo back to the dorms and change your clothes. After that, come back to the classroom for class. I\u2019ll give you fifteen minutes.\u201d As soon as she\u2019d finished speaking, Zhou Yi turned around and headed back towards the classroom.No one dared to waste any time this time around. They loudly dispersed, as practically all of them sprinted back to their dorm rooms.\u201cThat old woman is too fierce.\u201d Wang Dong spoke as as hurriedly ran back towards the dorms with Huo Yuhao.Huo Yuhao turned and said, \u201cThanks. If it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019m afraid that\u2026\u201dWang Dong snorted and said, \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. If it weren\u2019t for our fight, you could\u2019ve done it on your own. You can go in and change first, I\u2019m not really that sweaty.\u201dHuo Yuhao was stunned. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to change together to save time?\u201dWang Dong replied, \u201cDid you forget about the five rules I told you the other day? I don\u2019t like seeing the bodies of other people, it gives me goosebumps. Hurry up.\u201dHuo Yuhao didn\u2019t bother responding. He hurriedly returned to their room and took off his sweat-soaked shirt. He then used a clean cloth to wipe his body down, before changing into another set of the school uniform. He\u2019d have to wait until after class before he could clean his dirty body.When he left the room, it was Wang Dong\u2019s turn to change his clothes. At that moment, Huo Yuhao was still somewhat out of breath. The pair of wings that had appeared on Wang Dong\u2019s back subconsciously appeared in his mind again.Too beautiful, they had truly been too beautiful! Just what was that martial soul? Perhaps the others might not have noticed anything, but Huo Yuhao had. When Wang Dong had released his martial soul, his soul rings had also appeared. He\u2019d unexpectedly had two of them. The thing that astonished him even more than that however, was that Wang Dong actually had both a yellow and a purple soul ring. In other words, his second soul ring was a thousand year one. This had already surpassed the common sense of normal soul masters.No wonder he was so arrogant, he truly had the means to do so! When he compared his strength to Wang Dong\u2019s, he truly was far too weak.As he pondered about this, Wang Dong came out of their room after changing into a new set of clothes. The two of them didn\u2019t dare to waste any time; they returned to the classroom as fast as they could.Zhou Yi had given them fifteen minutes to change, but in reality, even the slowest person didn\u2019t take ten minutes. All of the students had already seated themselves in an orderly fashion inside of the classroom. Their eyes were still filled with fear when they looked at the nine empty seats.Everyone present had heard the phrase \u2018Shrek Academy is hard to enter, but easy to leave.\u2019 However, they only felt a strong sense of danger after it happened right in front of them. No one dared to even think of cheating anymore.When the fifteenth minute arrived, Zhou Yi walked into the classroom just on time. When she saw that the ninety-one students were all present, she nodded her head. She then said, \u201cWe\u2019ll start class now. On the whole, your test earlier has made me satisfied. A majority of you were able to complete the simple running test. Huo Yuhao, stand up.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhou.\u201d Huo Yuhao rapidly stood up; his back was ramrod straight.Zhou Yi coldly said, \u201cAnnounce your soul rank.\u201d\u201cYes. My soulforce is at the eleventh rank.\u201d Huo Yuhao spoke respectfully. Ever since Zhou Yi had called out their names earlier, he knew that in reality, this Teacher Zhou completely understood them, even though she seemed unreasonable. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t even be able to conceal his cultivation from her.After hearing the words \u2018eleventh rank\u2019, a suspicious expression appeared on all of the students in the class. Wang Dong even directly covered his eyes with his hands.Embarrassing, this was too embarrassing to him. With his level of cultivation, he\u2019d actually lost to a person at the eleventh rank. Wait, how could he only be at the eleventh rank of soulforce? Didn\u2019t enrolling at Shrek Academy have a basic requirement that students had to be at the fifteenth rank? When he thought about this, Wang Dong couldn\u2019t help but raise his head to look at Huo Yuhao with a flabbergasted expression.\u201cCorrect, his soul power is only at the eleventh rank. I know, you all are very curious as to why he could pass the school\u2019s assessment and was able to become a freshman. I\u2019ll only answer this question once, no one can ask him about it in the future unless he\u2019s eliminated. He\u2019s a student who was specially invited by the academy. When he entered the academy, he didn\u2019t need to pass any tests. However, this is the only exception we make for specially invited students. If he\u2019s unable to complete the studying assignments that the academy sets, he\u2019ll also be eliminated. Okay Huo Yuhao, sit down.\u201d\u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d As Huo Yuhao sat back down, he couldn\u2019t help but feel astonished. Teacher Zhou\u2019s words were clearly meant to protect him! By clearly explaining the situation of his enrollment, even with his insufficient soul rank, no one would ask about it in the future.Zhou Yi didn\u2019t seem to care about the students\u2019 reactions to this. She turned around and wrote two big words on the blackboard: \u2018ATTACK\u2019 and \u2018DEFENSE\u2019.After writing the two words out on the blackboard, she turned back to face the students once again. \u201cI know that a majority of you are very unhappy because of the punishment I gave to you earlier, as well as the expulsion of those nine people. Only, you don\u2019t dare to show it because of my pressure. I have no need to give you any explanations. People who are perceptive will naturally understand my reasoning in the future. As for the idiots who can\u2019t understand, it\u2019s fine for them to not understand. We will now start class.\u201d\u201cYou should all recognise the two words that I\u2019ve just written on the blackboard. \u2018Attack\u2019, and \u2018Defense\u2019. For our first class today, I\u2019ll talk to you about the attacking and defending techniques that soul masters use. Since ancient times, we soul masters have been split into many different systems based off of our innate martial souls, such as the Power Attack System, the Agility Attack System, the Auxiliary System, the Food System, the Control System, the Defense System, and so on. Some soul masters develop their abilities towards an extreme of one system, while others develop their abilities equally in multiple. The various number of methods to cultivate is by no means an isolated path. Wang Dong, answer this question: Of the various systems that soul masters fall into, which is the best at attacking, and which should lean towards defense and auxiliary, or support?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 9.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9.3: Radiant Butterfly GoddessThis question couldn\u2019t be any easier for him. Wang Dong stood up and unhesitantly replied, \u201cNaturally, assault, agility, and control system soul masters are inclined towards attacking, while auxiliary, food, and defense system soul masters are inclined towards defense.\u201dZhou Yi spoke with no trace of politeness, \u201cThat was a stupid answer.\u201dWang Dong was left blank. \u201cTeacher Zhou, my answer-\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201d Zhou Yi interrupted him, as she waved her hand in his direction, causing a strong burst of soulforce to hold back the words he was about to say. Then, it forced him to sit back down.\u201cIf this were four thousand years ago\u2014before the Sun Moon Continent had collided with our Douluo Continent\u2014Wang Dong\u2019s answer would\u2019ve been correct. However, as of now, his answer couldn\u2019t be any more incorrect. Huo Yuhao, tell me, why is this so?\u201dHuo Yuhao instantly thought to himself that Teacher Zhou really had a grudge against him and Wang Dong today. Fortunately, they hadn\u2019t been expelled despite this. After some lightning-quick thinking, he came to an answer. He stood up and said, \u201cBecause of soul tools.\u201dThe strictness present on Zhou Yi\u2019s face finally became a bit gentler. \u201cYou aren\u2019t considered that stupid; it\u2019s no wonder that you were able to become a specially invited student. Correct. It\u2019s exactly because of soul tools that the line between attack and defense has become blurred. This is also the topic that I want to talk about today. Sit down.\u201d\u201cI believe that everyone very clear knows that the development of soul tools has been quite rapid during these recent few thousand years. That year, the Sun Moon Continent brought many precious materials with them, as well as the basic manufacturing techniques for soul tools. After a few thousand years of development, the quality of our manufactured soul tools has steadily become better, while their strength has in turn become steadily stronger. This has created a situation where even food system soul masters can have an attack power that\u2019s equal to, or even surpasses, the attack of assault system soul masters\u2014if they possess a sufficiently strong soul tool. Contrastingly, if agility system soul masters have a soul tool with a strong defensive capability, they can temporarily play the role of a defense system soul masters.\u201d\u201cIt could be said that the appearance of soul tools has enormously changed both the direction and current situation of soul masters\u2019 cultivation. In reality, the usage of soul rings have been weakened. As long as you have sufficient soulforce, you can rely on soul tools to make up for the deficiency in your soul rings. This has caused many people to neglect the usage of soul rings, thereby creating the current situation in which the soul masters of the four great empires are cultivating with the sole aim of achieving a high amount of soulforce.\u201d\u201cThis sort of cultivation method is undoubtedly effective in the short-term; especially for soul masters below the fiftieth rank, where the effects of soul tools are extremely obvious. However, what I want to make clear to you is that our Shrek Academy doesn\u2019t cultivate this kind of soul master. And that\u2019s because, after surpassing the fiftieth rank, they\u2019re all trash.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, right? Let me give an example. You\u2019re a tool soul master that\u2019s cultivated to the fiftieth rank, while I\u2019m an agility system soul master who\u2019s also cultivated to the fiftieth rank. However, you have a soul tool that\u2019s strong enough to threaten my life, while I don\u2019t have one at all. Who wins the fight?\u201d\u201cThe answer is very simple. I\u2019ll definitely win. Why? Because with my speed, you basically won\u2019t have the slightest chance of hitting me with your soul tool. Even if you have a peak-level soul tool, I can still rely on my speed to grind down your soulforce. The stronger the soul tool, the higher the drain on your soulforce. Because of this, although soul masters of the defense, auxiliary, and food systems can rely on soul tools to possess the attack power of a assault system soul masters, they still won\u2019t have the combat strength of a real assault system soul master. You must remember this very clearly. Because of this, although soul tools can enormously strengthen defense, auxiliary, and food system soul masters, you\u2019ll always be killed first on the battlefield if your body isn\u2019t strong enough. Your opponents won\u2019t let you off just based on the fact that you\u2019re not an offensive soul master. On the contrary, people bully the weak. Your attack power might be very strong by relying on a soul tool, but your other aspects will be very weak in turn. What would your enemies choose to do in that case?\u201d\u201cLikewise, if I\u2019m extremely fit, my combat strength will be very strong in and of itself. Thus, having possession of a strong soul tool at the same time would be like adding wings to a tiger. This is a true expert.\u201d\u201cThe line separating attack and defense has been blurred; nowadays, anybody within a team of soul masters can fill the role of an attacker. However, only by raising your physical fitness can you increase your chance of surviving on the battlefield by a large degree. Unless soul tools develop to the point where they can completely replace your body, the level of both your physical fitness and your soul rings will still be the most important thing in your futures.\u201dZhou Yi didn\u2019t know this, but ten thousand years from now, soul tools would actually develop to the degree where they could actually replace one\u2019s entire body, like she\u2019d just said.\u201cDuring the next three months, most of my training for you will be focused on training your physical fitness. No matter who you are, what origins you have or how talented you are, if you can\u2019t pass my test three months from now, you\u2019ll end up just like those nine people. You can screw off.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s morning class will end here. I recommend that you eat a proper lunch. Your training will start this afternoon. Huo Yuhao, follow me to the office for a bit.\u201dAfter speaking, Zhou Yi turned around and walked away without pausing. The lunch bell hadn\u2019t even rung yet.The class remained silent until Zhou Yi had walked out of the classroom. A majority of the people there were immersed in what Zhou Yi had said. Although this Teacher Zhou didn\u2019t follow the rules of common sense, they had no choice but to agree that her words made a lot of sense.Huo Yuhao stood up and followed Zhou Yi out. Besides the office buildings that were located behind the purple and black teaching buildings, there was also a simplistic office located within every school building.Huo Yuhao followed Zhou Yi to the office, which was close to the classroom. Zhou Yi motioned for him to shut the door, while she proceeded to sit behind an office desk. Although she looked old, her movements didn\u2019t appear elderly at all.\u201cHuo Yuhao, I don\u2019t like to beat around the bush. Wang Dong\u2019s martial soul astonished me a lot, but your martial soul has caused me to become very curious. Even with my experience, I was unable to sense what your martial soul was. Now, I want to know what exactly it is.\u201d Zhou Yi\u2019s power was undoubtedly manifested in her words.There was naturally no need for him to conceal his martial soul from his teacher. Huo Yuhao replied, \u201cMy martial soul is the Spirit Eyes, a spiritual-type martial soul.\u201dWhen she heard Huo Yuhao\u2019s words, Zhou Yi was visibly astonished. A trace of delight flashed through her bright eyes, which were inconsistent with her extremely aged face. \u201cA body soul that has a spiritual attribute? Eyes?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head.Zhou Yi\u2019s eyes furrowed slightly, as if she were deep in thought. After a short period of time, she asked Huo Yuhao, \u201cCan you tell me what your first soul skill is?\u201dTeachers inquiring about their student\u2019s martial souls was very common, but a soul skill was the most important ability of a soul master, as well as their most important secret. Even with Zhou Yi\u2019s might, she\u2019d still used an inquiring tone.Someone else might\u2019ve hesitated for a moment, but Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t have this problem. His first soul ring had four skills, so only exposing two of them was still quite easy for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Following that, his pupils were covered in a faintly golden layer. Immediately afterwards, Zhou Yi felt a spiritual undulation emerge before her eyes.Zhou Yi was naturally different from Bei Bei and Tang Ya; she was a Soul Emperor expert. Although she wasn\u2019t a spiritual-type soul master, she still naturally had a strong level of spiritual power due to her cultivation. If she wanted to reject Huo Yuhao\u2019s spiritual skill, from someone who was only at the eleventh rank, it couldn\u2019t be any easier for her. However, she clearly wouldn\u2019t reject it right now; she immediately chose to accept it.Once she accepted it, Zhou Yi\u2019s pupils instantly expanded.Spiritual Detection Sharing immediately appeared within Zhou Yi\u2019s sense of vision, causing everything around her to become much clearer. This clear sense of reality made it seem as if one was walking out from a dense fog. Everything became clear and orderly, so much so that she was able to completely describe everything using numbers. The precise predictions, almost as if they were coming from a second, separate brain, unceasingly changed along with her line of sight.After roughly a minute, Huo Yuhao deactivated his skill, and stood conscientiously in front of Zhou Yi.Zhou Yi stood still in a daze for a while, before murmuring to herself, \u201cWhat a miraculous skill. No wonder the Tang Sect chose you as their specially invited student. With this skill alone, that girl Tang Ya has definitely chosen the right person. I was wondering why that girl, who was extremely smart even though she had ordinary talent, would choose a person who only had a cultivation level of the eleventh rank, and an ordinary level physical fitness. To think that he actually had this secret\u2026\u201d\u201cHuo Yuhao, follow me.\u201d Whilst speaking, Zhou Yi quickly stood up and took Huo Yuhao with her. She then led him out of the office with quick steps.At this moment, Huo Yuhao was confused. He could sense that Zhou Yi\u2019s frame of mind had had a huge change after learning about his martial soul and soul skill, but he wasn\u2019t clear about whether this was a good thing or a bad thing. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t know where Zhou Yi was taking him, nor what she wanted him to do there.After leaving the freshman school building, Zhou Yi led Huo Yuhao straight towards the back of the academy, which was to the west. After walking a short distance, Zhou Yi furrowed her brows slightly and said, \u201cThis is too slow. I\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d Mid-sentence, she flashed towards Huo Yuhao and grabbed his shoulder with her right hand. The next moment, Huo Yuhao felt like he was soaring through the clouds.The scenery around him rapidly changed, while a formless barrier seemed to have appeared around him\u2014seemingly to protect him. Only, his surroundings had become blurry.Zhou Yi was undoubtedly the strongest soul master that Huo Yuhao had ever seen. Just what sort of speed was this!? He hurriedly released his Spiritual Detection. Only after he\u2019d done this was he able to faintly distinguish the direction they were headed in.After heading westward for quite a while, Zhou Yi changed directions and headed to the north. Huo Yuhao began to feel that they\u2019d left the outer courtyard\u2019s Martial Soul Institute, and that they\u2019d entered the outer courtyard\u2019s Soul Engineering Institute.Even with her level of speed, Zhou Yi only halted after a few minutes had passed. They\u2019d arrived before an enormous building.The school buildings that Huo Yuhao had previously seen had already been quite big, but they were still outshone by the grey, rectangular building in front of them. The total surface area of this building might even be able to compare with the Martial Soul Institution\u2019s dorms.The grey building looked extremely massive. It wasn\u2019t just made of bricks either; its surface had many metallic glints on it. A low, rumbling sound echoed unceasingly from the building, and the ground beneath Huo Yuhao\u2019s feet was even vibrating slightly.A signboard to the side of the building told him what this place was: \u201cSoul Tool Testing Area\u201d.Huo Yuhao was filled with doubt. Why would Teacher Zhou bring him to the Soul Tool Testing Area? What did she want to do?Zhou Yi naturally didn\u2019t explain anything to him. After loosening her grip on Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulder, she walked towards the entrance of the Soul Tool Testing Area.Once they\u2019d entered, Huo Yuhao discovered that everything inside the Soul Tool Testing Area was made of metal. Furthermore, he\u2019d never seen the type of metal that had apparently been used to construct everything; it was a somewhat dark brown colour.After entering, they were greeted by a long horizontal corridor. It looked similar to the corridors from the Martial Soul Institute\u2019s dorms, but there were only doors located on one side of the corridor, and they were all thirty metres apart from one another. The signs on the doors had words like \u2018Testing Area One, Testing Area Two\u2026\u2019 along with other words to the same effect.Zhou Yi seemed to have come here often, as she was already familiar with everything. She took Huo Yuhao with her as she headed northward through a corridor, before stopping at the end of it, in front of a door that had the sign \u2018Testing Area 20\u2019 on it.Zhou Yi turned her wrist over, and a hexagonal silver command medallion appeared in her hand. She then pressed it to the door that said \u2018Testing Area 20\u2019.A magical scene appeared before Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes; The door split open, revealing a gap that was perfectly fitted to her command medallion. Huo Yuhao thought he sensed a temporary fluctuation of soulforce before the command medallion was released from the gap. Following that, the door to Testing Area 20 opened horizontally, a grating sound echoing out.When the door had opened a bit, Huo Yuhao discovered, to his astonishment, that the door was made entirely of metal, and was actually two feet thick. There were smooth rails at the bottom and top of the door, which allowed it to slowly open.After the door opened had fully, Zhou Yi waved her hand towards Huo Yuhao, and walked in before him.\u201cBoom\u2014\u201d Once Huo Yuhao entered, he was startled by a loud sound. A strong vibration, mixed together with a stream of air, smashed directly into his face, causing his school uniform to flutter.Zhou Yi seemed to see this as a common occurrence, and continued to walk inside.After entering Testing Area 20, Huo Yuhao discovered that this place was a completely different world. There were massive metal plates that divided the world into separate areas that were akin to metal boxes. Under Zhou Yi\u2019s guidance, they quickly arrived at the largest area within the world. It was an empty field that was roughly two thousand square metres in size, while its height was around ten metres tall. There were currently a few people that stood along the edges of the field, who seemed to be fiddling with strange things in their hands.\u201cFan Yu.\u201d Zhou Yi shouted loudly, causing the group of people beside the field to immediately look towards her, in which there was a tall, middle-aged man, who furrowed his brows slightly, then walked towards Zhou Yi and Huo Yuhao with large strides.The middle-aged man was roughly 1.8 metres tall, and his shoulders were extremely wide. He wore a simple cloth shirt that exposed his thick and sturdy shoulders, in turn revealing his granite-like muscles. There were distinct lines on his face, and he had a deep gaze. As he stood there, he gave off the feeling of a mountain that had stood there for time immemorial.\u201cZhou Yi, why have you come?\u201d Clearly, this middle-aged man was the Fan Yu that Zhou Yi had called out to.\u201cDo you still remember the words that you said to me last time?\u201d Zhou Yi seemed to be slightly excited as she spoke.A helpless smile appeared on Fan Yu\u2019s face as he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve talked to you about a lot of things. How am I to know what thing you\u2019re referring to? If it\u2019s not important, head back first. I still have to conduct a few tests here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She amiably said, \u201cI\u2019m referring to what you brought up last time; the matter regarding spiritual-type soul masters using soul tools.\u201dWhen he heard what she said, Fan Yu\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but light up. His gaze subconsciously fell on Huo Yuhao, who was standing to the side. \u201cHe has a spiritual-type martial soul?\u201dZhou Yi nodded her head and said, \u201cCorrect. His name is Huo Yuhao, and he\u2019s a new student. He has a spiritual-type body soul.\u201dAfter seriously looking over Huo Yuhao, Fan Yu shook his head and said, \u201cThis won\u2019t do. His body and soul force are both too weak. I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t even be able to control one of the weakest soul tools. Furthermore, his talent is similar to the current state of his body; it\u2019s too far away from what I need.\u201dZhou Yi humphed and replied, \u201cAre you looking down on my foresight? True, Huo Yuhao is still weak right now, but his soul skill is extraordinary. It\u2019s the most practical spiritual-type skill that I\u2019ve ever seen. Huo Yuhao, let him experience it for a moment.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d As a student, Huo Yuhao could only participate as a spectator right now. He immediately activated his Spiritual Detection Sharing and used it on the middle-aged man.Following that, Huo Yuhao was so startled that he almost lost focus. When his Spiritual Detection Sharing came into contact with the middle-aged man, the latter slightly furrowed his brow. In that instant, Huo Yuhao felt as if there was a terrifying beast in front of him that had suddenly opened its maw\u2014as if it wanted to swallow him in one gulp.This feeling even caused the sleeping Skydream Iceworm to wake up. A refreshing feeling appeared in his spiritual sea, causing Huo Yuhao\u2019s astonishment and horror to disappear.The terrifying aura that was emanating from Fan Yu\u2019s body disappeared after only appearing for an instant. As soon as it did, he allowed Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing to link with him.\u201cEeeh!\u201d After a short moment, Fan Yu discovered the subtleties contained within Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing. Great waves immediately rose inside of his originally peaceful eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s actually a spiritual-type skill like this? How could a skill like this come from a ten year soul beast?\u201d Fan Yu looked at the white soul ring floating below Huo Yuhao\u2019s body with a puzzled look. In addition to the puzzled look on his face, he also had a surprised look.Huo Yuhao naturally wouldn\u2019t mention the Skydream Iceworm, so the Wind Baboon became his excuse once again.\u201cA ten year Wind Baboon?\u201d Fan Yu and Zhou Yi were both speechless.Zhou Yi gazed at Fan Yu and said, \u201cCould this be a mutated soul skill?\u201dFan Yu nodded his head and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a chance. This little guy\u2019s martial soul is a body soul, and a spiritual-type one at that. His existence in and of itself is a mutation. Furthermore, the soul beast that he chose for a soul ring is an existence that\u2019s completely incompatible with him. This must\u2019ve triggered an extremely rare soul skill mutation. The fact that a spiritual-type martial soul didn\u2019t suffer a backlash from absorbing a wind-type soul ring is already a miracle, but I didn\u2019t think that a mutation like this would appear. I\u2019m afraid that this is a miracle that would be completely impossible to reproduce.\u201d\u201cCaitou, come here.\u201d Fan Yu beckoned towards the group of people standing next to the wall. A youth immediately rushed over.When he saw the youth, Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but be startled. From his face, he didn\u2019t look to be much look older than Bei Bei. However, he was extremely tall\u2014over two metres tall. His shoulders were even wider than Fan Yu\u2019s, while his naked upper body exposed his tanned muscles. There wasn\u2019t any hair on his head, and he was much more tanned than an ordinary person. He had a simple and honest appearance.\u201cTeacher.\u201d The youth bowed respectfully towards Fan Yu.Fan Yu pointed at Huo Yuhao and said, \u201cGo and fire a round of the stationary soul cannon. Let this kid support you, and try to hit a moving target.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The tanned youth didn\u2019t ask any questions. He smiled simple-mindedly at Huo Yuhao and said, \u201cLittle brother, follow me.\u201dZhou Yi said, \u201cHuo Yuhao, just use that skill of yours to support him.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Huo Yuhao now somewhat understood why Zhou Yi had brought him here. He hurriedly chased after the tanned youth.\u201cNice to meet you, little brother. My name\u2019s He Caitou, but everyone simply calls me Caitou. Thus, you can just call me Caitou.\u201d The tanned youth gave Huo Yuhao another simple-minded smile.Huo Yuhao replied, \u201cNice to meet you, big brother He. I\u2019m Huo Yuhao.\u201dWhen he said the three words \u2018Big brother He\u2019, He Caitou became stunned for a moment. After he\u2019d recovered, he gave Huo Yuhao a big thumbs up and said, \u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re not bad.\u201dEven future historians wouldn\u2019t know that the friendship between \u2018Eyes of the Asura\u2019 Huo Yuhao and \u2018Origin of Destruction\u2019 He Caitou had actually started from a simple sentence like this.When the two had arrived at the edge of the testing field. He Caitou tapped the black belt on his waist, causing a light to flash, and an item that was extremely strange-looking\u2014in Huo Yuhao\u2019s opinion\u2014appeared in his hand.It was a roughly 1.5 metre-long tube made of black metal. Its cross-sectional diameter was around 15 centimetres, while its \u2018tail\u2019 was slightly thicker. It had many mysterious patterns carved on it.He Caitou held it in an extremely proficient manner. After pressing the back of the metal tube with his right hand twice, a cover immediately came off, revealing a hole that was approximately twenty centimetres long and ten centimetres wide.He quickly tapped his waist with his left hand once again, causing a shuttle-shaped piece of metal to appear in his hand. He carefully placed it into the exposed hole in the metal tube, before carefully putting the cover back on. When he raised his right hand, the metal tube landed on his right shoulder.He Caitou, who\u2019d previously given off an extremely simple feeling, suddenly had a large change in temperament when he raised the metal tube to his shoulder. Huo Yuhao\u2019s martial soul was a spiritual-type one, thus his keen level of awareness caused him to feel a strong sense of danger from He Caitou all of a sudden.\u201cHuo Yuhao, let\u2019s start.\u201d He Caitou\u2019s voice echoed out.A golden light flickered through Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes, and his Spiritual Detection Sharing accurately landed on He Caitou\u2019s body. He Caitou\u2019s eyes exuded a trace of astonishment, and he excitedly shouted into the distance, \u201cMoving target, fire.\u201dThere seemed to be someone controlling the targets from the other side. With a \u2018swoosh\u2019, a disk-shaped object shot out from a corner in the distance, and was headed directly towards Huo Yuhao and He Caitou.At that moment, a strong undulation of soulforce instantly exploded from He Caitou\u2019s body. Three soul rings\u2014two yellow and one purple\u2014all simultaneously flashed, and the metal tube on his shoulder seemed to tremble slightly. A strong halo of black light began to revolve around the surface of the metal tube, and He Caitou\u2019s body gently moved. The metal tube was now aimed at the round disk flying towards them at high speed.\u201cBang\u2014\u201d A violent explosion echoed out, and the metal tube instantly released a dazzling black light. The huge amount of turbulence that suddenly appeared caused Huo Yuhao to stumble and almost fall down.However, the black light didn\u2019t hit the flying round disk. Instead, it brushed past it, and flew into the distance. After it had traversed a hundred or so metres, it collided fiercely with a metal plate in the distance, causing a violent explosion to erupt. An enormous stream of air rebounded straight towards them, causing He Caitou to quickly move to protect Huo Yuhao behind him.The air current lasted a few seconds before it gradually calmed down. On the other hand, the round disk didn\u2019t fly out of the testing area, but rather landed near them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhou Yi\u2019s expression was slightly ugly, while Fan Yu looked as if he\u2019d thought of something. He quickly asked Huo Yuhao, \u201cHuo Yuhao, how large is the range of your Spiritual Detection?\u201dHuo Yuhao answered, \u201cIt has a diameter of thirty metres or so.\u201dFan Yu suddenly understood what had happened as he said, \u201cSo that\u2019s the case\u2026. No wonder this happened. After all, this is still only a soul skill from a ten year soul ring. For it to have such profound detection capabilities within a fixed range is already relatively amazing. We can\u2019t ask for too much either. Only, this is rather unfortunate.\u201dHuo Yuhao suddenly said, \u201cTeacher Fan Yu, the range of my Spiritual Detection will increase as my soul rank increases.\u201dFan Yu was stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. How could a soul skill evolve?\u201dHuo Yuhao said with a serious countenance, \u201cIt\u2019s really true. This skill\u2019s range has already increased by one metre since I obtained it. Furthermore, I don\u2019t have complete control over it right now. Perhaps in the future I\u2019ll be able to reduce its omnipresent range and instead increase its range in only a single direction.\u201dHuo Yuhao was already acutely aware as to why Zhou Yi had brought him here, as well as what she\u2019d said during the following conversation. This could be an opportunity for him, although he wasn\u2019t clear on what this opportunity was. However, assuming that it was an opportunity he couldn\u2019t give up on, he decided to tell the truth.Fan Yu glanced at Zhou Yi, who nodded slightly back at him.Fan Yu replied, \u201cFine. If the range of your Spiritual Detection Sharing is able to reach a hundred metres in one direction, come find me. When that happens, I\u2019ll teach you how to make soul tools.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you, teacher.\u201d Huo Yuhao hurriedly bowed in respect.Fan Yu waved his hand and said, \u201cCaitou, go over and explain to him what a stationary soul tool is.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d He Caitou had an extremely good impression of Huo Yuhao. He beckoned to him as he walked over to the side.As he watched their figures gradually fade into the distance, Fan Yu quietly asked Zhou Yi, \u201cWhat do you think of this kid? His mutated soul skill is honestly incredibly strong; there\u2019s no doubt about his abilities in a team. Am I asking too much from him? If we want him to be able to support a stationary soul tool, we\u2019ll need it to be able to reach at least distance of a hundred metres\u2014and that\u2019s at the very least. However\u2026 I dare to say that, if the range of his Spiritual Detection Sharing is able to reach a thousand metres in a single direction, he\u2019ll become the most terrifying support-type soul master on the continent.\u201dZhou Yi said, \u201cI\u2019ve just met this kid, so I can\u2019t say much about him. However, you should\u2019ve seen it. Although his cultivation isn\u2019t strong, and even though his physique is rather weak, his temperament is much more mature than that of his peers. If it were anyone else, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have said what he just said. I\u2019ll help you watch over him. However, if he can\u2019t pass the tests I give him, I\u2019ll still expel him. Rules can\u2019t be broken.\u201dFan Yu thought to himself for a second, then said, \u201cHelp me observe him a bit more. Even if he can\u2019t pass the Martial Soul Institute\u2019s tests, I can still specially invite him to the Soul Engineering Institution as long as his Spiritual Detection Sharing is able to continue improving. I\u2019ve already devoted ten years of my life to researching stationary soul tools. After combining that with the experiences of my predecessors, I finally managed to develop the most terrifying kind of soul tool. Currently, all I lack are users for it.\u201dZhou Yi sighed lightly and said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be too stubborn either. In addition to the lack of users for it, there\u2019s also another fatal flaw; its manufacturing cost is extremely high. You of all people should know that. It\u2019s destined not to be used in a large-scale manner.\u201dFan Yu unyieldingly replied, \u201cSoul tools are powerful weapons meant for a small number of especially outstanding soul masters in the first place. When I conducted my research on stationary soul tools, I never even thought of spreading them out into the community of common soul masters. As long as an extremely small number of soul masters are able to use them, stationary soul tools will become our academy\u2019s true ace in the hole!\u201d\u2014-\u201cBig brother He, what exactly are stationary soul tools?\u201d Huo Yuhao had a curious look on his face as he asked He Caitou.He Caitou chuckled and replied, \u201cThere are many different types of soul tools. However, I can\u2019t tell you about all of them in the short period of time we have. For starters, there are two main types of soul tools: short range soul tools and long range soul tools.Of these, short range soul tools are similar to the weapons that we normally use; they\u2019re weapons that will explode with even more power when you pour soulforce into them. When you compare them to long range soul tools, they\u2019re slightly stronger. On the other hand, long range soul tools are a type of soul tool that unleash long range attacks by pouring soulforce into them. The stronger the soul tool, the more soulforce required. This means that soul masters with stronger levels of cultivation can use higher quality soul tools.\u201cOn the other hand, a stationary soul tool is a special type of soul tool that my teacher created based off of the accumulated wisdom of our predecessors. It can fire long range attacks, but doesn\u2019t require too much soulforce to use. You saw how I used it earlier. Simply put, it splits the soul tool into two parts, where the soul tool component is only used to fire and detonate a projectile. Earlier, I used the stationary soul cannon to fire a cannon shell. The biggest advantage of a stationary soul tool lies in the fact that it uses very little soulforce, and that it doesn\u2019t require an excessively high level of cultivation to use. Its flaw lies in the fact that it\u2019s very hard to aim it\u2014especially when you\u2019re aiming at a moving targetm which is even harder to hit. But when it\u2019s used against a fixed target, it\u2019s very powerful. However, the manufacturing process of the cannon shells is very troublesome, and requires many precious materials. Normally, teacher never lets me fire it without reason. Teacher said that a stationary soul tool can strengthen a soul master\u2019s attack power by tenfold\u2026 in theory. However, the strength of a stationary soul tool also has its limits. After all, it\u2019s affected by the materials used to make it. The number of users for these stationary soul tools is fated to be an extremely small number of soul masters who are suited to use them.\u201dHe Caitou\u2019s explanation couldn\u2019t be said to be wonderful; it was even a bit unclear at some points. However, this was the first time that Huo Yuhao had opened the great door of soul tools. This finally allowed him to have a preliminary amount of knowledge regarding soul tools. He faintly understood that Teacher Fan Yu definitely had a great deal of accomplishments within the field of soul tools. Teacher Xiao Ya had told him that he\u2019d have to study soul tools in the future. If he could become Teacher Fan Yu\u2019s disciple, that would clearly be the best option available to him.\u201cHuo Yuhao, let\u2019s go.\u201d At that moment, Zhou Yi\u2019s voice echoed out.Huo Yuhao said to He Caitou. \u201cBig brother He, I\u2019ll be going first. It was a pleasure to meet you.\u201dHe Caitou chuckled and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re a new student, work hard. It\u2019ll be good if you\u2019re able to become my junior brother in the future. Teacher doesn\u2019t normally let me leave this place. It\u2019s too boring.\u201dAfter leaving the Soul Tool Testing Area, Zhou Yi took Huo Yuhao straight back to the dorms. \u201cHuo Yuhao, you heard what Teacher Fan Yu said earlier. I can only tell you that he\u2019s the number one master at creating soul tools in the academy. If you\u2019re able to become his disciple, you\u2019ll have an endless future. However, you\u2019ll first need to be able to stay within the academy. Go on, go eat lunch.\u201dAfter watching Zhou Yi leave, Huo Yuhao went straight to the canteen. The students from the other classes had already finished their classes, so the entrance to the canteen was filled with several people both entering and leaving the canteen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he raised his head to see who the figure was, he realised that it was actually Tang Ya.\u201cTeacher Xiao Ya?\u201dTang Ya had a somewhat mysterious smile on her face as she pulled Huo Yuhao over to the side and whispered to him, \u201cLittle Yuhao, you don\u2019t have any money, right?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Eldest senior brother told me that there were some jobs that I could take for the academy if I needed some though. I was planning to see what was available after class.\u201dHis yearly tuition was ten gold coins. At the same time, there were daily expenses that he\u2019d need to spend money on. Although he was willing to spend all of his energy cultivating, he still needed to stay alive.Tang Ya giggled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a disciple of my Tang Sect, so as your teacher, it\u2019s only right that I take care of you. I\u2019ve thought of a way for you to make money. I know the auntie who\u2019s responsible for buying food for the canteen; I\u2019ll help you ask her to buy twenty fish everyday. Afterwards, I\u2019ll help you set up a grill outside, along with help you obtain some charcoal. I\u2019ve also prepared some other ingredients. It should be fine if you just sell roasted fish by the academy\u2019s entrance after school. With your cooking skill, you\u2019ll definitely be able to sell them off. These fishes normally cost around one copper coin, but after you\u2019ve finished roasting them, selling them for five copper coins won\u2019t be a problem at all! If we do it this way, won\u2019t you be able to make some money?\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, that\u2019s a pretty good plan. I have my Spirit Eyes, thus I\u2019m able to very accurately control the fire. Why don\u2019t we try this out tonight?\u201dTang Ya nodded her head repeatedly. Afterwards, she revealed her true intentions. \u201cAbout that\u2026 since I\u2019ll have helped you buy all of these things, you\u2019ll have to give me priority when you\u2019re selling the roasted fish. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll still buy them from you. As for your future ingredients, you\u2019ll have to buy them yourself.\u201dEver since she\u2019d eaten Huo Yuhao\u2019s roasted fish that day, she\u2019d constantly thought about it. After finishing her exams yesterday, she\u2019d finally thought of this method that would benefit them both. Naturally, she\u2019d hid this from Bei Bei.When he saw Tang Ya\u2019s greedy expression, Huo Yuhao finally understood her motive behind doing this. He gave her a knowing smile and said, \u201cFine. Teacher Xiao Ya, why don\u2019t we meet here tonight?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019ll go back first. Right, I have to tell you a piece of good news! Bei Bei and I have both been promoted to Year 4!\u201d Tang Ya waved to him goodbye, and excitedly ran away.After grabbing a simple lunch, Huo Yuhao returned to the dorms. Wang Dong wasn\u2019t there, and no one seemed to know where he\u2019d gone. Zhou Yi still wanted to drill them in the afternoon, so Huo Yuhao took advantage of their afternoon break to enter a meditative state. As he cultivated, he simultaneously recovered his physical strength.Huo Yuhao\u2019s was surprised when he cultivated. After the extremely taxing run that morning, he discovered that the growth was slightly greater than normal. Although it was only a strand more, he was still quite satisfied. He inwardly thought to himself, it seems like tempering my body to the limit boosts the growth of my soulforce. On the other hand, the physical fitness level of his body was originally very normal, so he should\u2019ve tempered his body anyway. This was killing two birds with one stone!When Huo Yuhao woke up from his meditation, he was stunned in that the instant that he opened his eyes, he discovered Wang Dong\u2014who was sitting on the opposite bed\u2014looking at him with a brilliant gaze.\u201cYou\u2019ve returned? We should go to class now.\u201d Whilst speaking, Huo Yuhao jumped off the bed and began to put his shoes on. After what had happened that morning, their relationship had already warmed up.Wang Dong spoke in a low voice, \u201cHuo Yuhao, I\u2019ve always found your martial soul strange. You\u2019ve seen my martial soul now, so can you tell me what your martial soul is?\u201dHuo Yuhao finished putting on his shoes, then stood up and said, \u201cMy eyes are my martial soul. I call them Spirit Eyes. They\u2019re a spiritual-type martial soul. I know why you\u2019re baffled. My first soul skill is called Spiritual Detection. The reason why you were unable to hit me that day was because I used Spiritual Detection to predict your every move.\u201dWang Dong suddenly understood what had happened. \u201cSo that\u2019s the case\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that you actually had a body spirit. Let\u2019s go, we can\u2019t be late. Earlier, I went and asked around. I discovered that Teacher Zhou has the nickname \u2018Perverted Grandma\u2019. The number of students expelled by her every year is supposedly equivalent to that of ten other teachers. We really have bad luck, having a teacher like her in charge of our class.\u201dHuo Yuhao shook his head and smiled. \u201cYou can\u2019t think about it that way. Teacher Zhou is indeed strict, but as long as we demand the same level of strictness from ourselves, meeting her demands won\u2019t be that hard. Right, I\u2019ve seen your martial soul, but I don\u2019t know its name. I also saw that you had a yellow and a purple soul rings; how did you manage to get a thousand year soul ring for your second soul ring?\u201dWang Dong laughed mischievously and said, \u201cBeing able to use a thousand year soul ring as my second soul ring is a secret; I can\u2019t tell you how. On the other hand, my martial soul is the Radiant Butterfly Goddess. It\u2019s the most beautiful butterfly on the continent, but it\u2019s already on the verge of being extinct. Having it as my martial soul is even rarer than your body soul. You\u2019ll see its power in the future. Right, what did Teacher Zhou take you to do earlier?\u201dThe two had already left their dorm and were headed towards the teaching buildings as they spoke to each other. It wasn\u2019t just them; none of the students in Class 1 dared to be late.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t conceal the fact that Teacher Zhou had brought him to see Teacher Fan Yu; there was no need to hide something like this from him. Thus, he told Wang Dong everything that had happened.\u201cWhat? You can even share your Spiritual Detection? Quickly, let me see.\u201d After all, everyone here was only eleven or twelve years old. Due to his curiosity, Wang Dong excitedly asked for Huo Yuhao to share his Spiritual Detection with him.Huo Yuhao felt helpless, and had no choice but to activate his Spiritual Detection Sharing and let Wang Dong experience it for a moment.Due to everything within the surrounding thirty metres suddenly becoming clear, as well as the data-like feedback, Wang Dong immediately turned slightly blank. It was akin to the feeling a blind man would get when he was suddenly able to see the world clearly. This feeling of shock would appear in every soul master who shared Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection for the first time.Furthermore, as Huo Yuhao continuously used his Spiritual Detection Sharing, his proficiency in it would gradually increased. As he allowed Wang Dong to experience it, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Fan Yu\u2019s words. He subconsciously attempted to extend his Spiritual Detection in one direction, then did his best to cover a slightly larger area with his Spiritual Detection.Under the current situation where he was focusing his energy in one direction, Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t know that the faint golden colour in his eyes had clearly become stronger, and that the spiritual undulations he was releasing had gotten much stronger as well. The originally omni-directional Spiritual Detection slowly contracted, and began to extend towards the front.Wang Dong also felt the changes in Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection. He discovered that the three-dimensional scenes to his left and right had disappeared, and that only the three-dimensional image in front of him remained. Furthermore, the range of this image was slowly increasing.To Huo Yuhao, just a few seconds of doing this felt like it took longer than when he\u2019d released his Spiritual Detection for a quarter of an hour in the past. He felt his soulforce being converted into spiritual energy at an astonishing pace as it flowed out of his body. It was only a moment, but waves of exhaustion had already invaded him.His body swayed, and he only managed to stand upright by grabbing onto Wang Dong\u2019s arm. His Spiritual Detection Sharing had also accordingly ended.\u201cHuo Yuhao, what happened?\u201d Wang Dong hurriedly supported him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed to have an extremely weak expression.Huo Yuhao waved towards Wang Dong to indicate that he was fine. \u201cIt was just that it became quite a large drain on my spiritual energy. Wang Dong, when you were looking straight ahead earlier, how far did my Spiritual Detection reach?\u201dAfter Wang Dong took a moment to recall what had happened, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying too much attention, but it seemed to be about fifty to sixty metres. However, I noticed that I wasn\u2019t able to see anything with Spiritual Detection in the other directions. The distance nearly doubled in the front, but that was it.\u201dWhen he heard what Wang Dong had said, Huo Yuhao\u2019s spirits immediately rose, so much so that even his exhaustion decreased by a large amount. \u201cThat\u2019s great! It actually works if I do it like this. However, the drain on my spiritual energy is a bit too much.\u201dWhen he tried to focus the range of his Spiritual Detection in one direction and extend it, the drain on his spiritual energy was almost ten times the normal cost. This was why his spiritual energy had become overdrawn in such a short period of time. However, Huo Yuhao believed that the reason behind the large drain of spiritual energy was because this was the first time that he\u2019d tried doing this. He believed that he\u2019d get better at it if he practiced more in the future.Teacher Fan Yu had said that he could become his disciple once the range of his Spiritual Detection was able to reach a hundred metres in any single direction.After seeing the terrifying might of soul tools, as well as hearing Caitou\u2019s introduction to them, he was filled with interest towards these mysterious existences.First-year Class 1. All ninety-one students were already seated in-class ten minutes before the afternoon bell had rung. Furthermore, there was an unusual silence amongst the classroom. None of the students dared to cause any noise. This is probably why it was said: \u2018It\u2019s not a bad thing for a teacher to be strict sometimes, since making students study seriously has many advantages.\u2019Since they didn\u2019t have assigned seats, Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao sat together. The two who were only eleven years old were unexpectedly deep in thought. Huo Yuhao was naturally pondering both his successes and failures when he\u2019d changed the direction of his Spiritual Detection. No one knew what Wang Dong was thinking about.As Zhou Yi slowly walked into the classroom, the atmosphere within Class 1 turned solemn. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong also awakened from their pondering. Although not much time had passed, Huo Yuhao had already recovered a great deal of his spiritual energy and soulforce, mostly because he didn\u2019t have that much soulforce to begin with. At the very least, he didn\u2019t feel weak anymore.\u201cEveryone, stand up and gather in the plaza.\u201d Unexpectedly, Zhou Yi said this immediately after entering the classroom, before instantly turning around to leave.No one dared to waste any time. A crowd of students rapidly left the classroom and followed Zhou Yi in an orderly, quiet manner to Shrek Plaza.They didn\u2019t notice that Zhou Yi unexpectedly had a smile hidden within her eyes. This teacher, who was strict to the point of being somewhat perverted, was currently thinking that there were definitely some advantages to teaching new students. At least these new students were less unruly, which made them easier to control. They weren\u2019t like those students from the third year or higher, who were more arrogant and rebellious since they already had certain accomplishments.A pile of iron chains had been piled up on Shrek Plaza at some unknown time. Under Zhou Yi\u2019s command, the students arranged them neatly.\u201cWang Dong.\u201d Zhou Yi called out.\u201cPresent.\u201d Wang Dong took a step forward.Zhou Yi spoke to the students, \u201cI\u2019ve flipped through your entrance test results, and I\u2019ve added them to the test that we performed this morning. Currently, out of all of you, Wang Dong has the highest level of cultivation. Because of this, I hereby declare that he\u2019ll be the class monitor of Class 1 from now on. The class monitor position is a volatile one, and whoever has the strength to beat him may do so and replace him as the new class monitor. Do you all understand?\u201d\u201cWe understand.\u201d The gazes from a few male students who had a high amount of self-confidence in their strength immediately turned sharp, while the gazes from the female students seemed to become much warmer as they looked at Wang Dong.Zhou Yi pointed towards the iron chains in front of her. \u201cThese are suits of chainmail specialised in strengthening your physical fitness. Every single one of you will take one. After you\u2019ve put them on, start running around around the plaza. You\u2019ll keep running from now until the bell signalling the end of class rings. You can use your soulforce, but you can\u2019t use any soul skills. Your rank will be based on the number of laps that you\u2019ve completed at the end of class, and the person in last place will be expelled from Class 1.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to emphasise. In my class, eliminations won\u2019t just happen during exam periods; they can happen at any time. Today, ninety-one people will become ninety people. Start running.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she flicked her toe, and a full set of chainmail made out of thick iron chains flew towards Wang Dong. Wang Dong hurriedly caught it and put it on.As soon as he got the chainmail on, he couldn\u2019t help but slightly change his expression. This chainmail weighed at least 15 kilograms!When the students heard that the person in last place would be eliminated, how could they dare to waste any time? They all ran up and grabbed a set of chainmail. The male students were slightly better off, while a majority of the female students turned pale after putting the heavy chainmail on.Zhou Yi coldly said, \u201cI know that a lot of you want to say that this is unfair because there\u2019s an innate gap between the bodies of men and women. That the physical fitness levels of tool, beast, and battle soul masters are different. However, I want to tell you that I treat everyone equally in my class. Think about it! If you were on the battlefield, would your enemy spare you simply because you\u2019re a girl or a tool master? Start now. Run.\u201dNo matter how much they wanted to curse at Zhou Yi, none of the students dared to speak a word of protest. With Wang Dong leading, they collectively ran towards the edge of the field, and started running with heavy chainmail on their bodies.Nobody wanted to be eliminated. Once they started running, the vigor with which they ran was completely different compared to that morning.Wang Dong took the lead and ran in front. No matter whether it was his martial soul or his soulforce, he was figure that excelled within the group of students. Although he was wearing a suit of chainmail, his speed didn\u2019t decrease in the slightest.The few male students who wanted to compete with him also charged forward, closely following him.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t speed up. He was very clear about his body\u2019s situation. Zhou Yi had said that they had to run until the bell rung, yet the afternoon class was nearly four hours long. It had just started! The most reasonable target that he\u2019d formulated for himself was to persevere and to simply run until the the bell rang; not to compete with the others.Thus, his speed was clearly much slower than the others when he started. Huo Yuhao looked on as everyone overtook him one by one, but he didn\u2019t become impatient. His steps were slightly slower, but they were stable and uniform as he ran forward.After only two laps, Huo Yuhao was dead last. Even the female students had overtaken him. However, he didn\u2019t take it to heart.When he reached his fourth lap, the person in first place\u2014Wang Dong\u2014had already lapped him once. When Wang Dong passed him, he even gave him a flabbergasted look.However, Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t take it to heart, and smiled at him in reply.Zhou Yi expressionlessly stood in the middle of the plaza as she watched the students run. No one knew what she was thinking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The other students had already lapped him at least one time. Many people had even cast disdainful gazes at him. After all, they all knew that Huo Yuhao definitely had the weakest cultivation amongst them.However, the running speed of the students in front had already started to slow down. As time passed, the effects of the chainmail started to become more obvious. Even Wang Dong had a face full of sweat.The few male students who\u2019d followed Wang Dong from the start had started to fall behind. Some had even been overtaken by the students behind them.Drops of sweat seeped into the running track. After around an hour had passed, a female student who had a weaker body collapsed to the ground. She struggled to get up, but she couldn\u2019t do anything.Wang Dong happened to be running next to her when this happened. He helped her up and sent her an inquiring gaze. However, that female student shook her head and sat down on the plaza, unwilling to get back up. She didn\u2019t even have the energy to speak.With the first, the second was bound to happen. Perhaps it was because they had the cushion of Huo Yuhao, who was dead last. Although the students persevered, in the end, their willpower didn\u2019t seem to be too strong.The burden of carrying the heavy chainmail whilst running was truly enormous. This was especially true since everyone had started running at full speed, which had quickly depleted their soulforce. On the other hand, withstanding the weight of the chainmail with their bodies alone was truly something strenuous at their age.When two hours had passed, half of the students had collapsed to the ground. From the beginning to the end, Zhou Yi had stood there with an expressionless face. She hadn\u2019t urged them to continue either.Huo Yuhao was also reaching his limit. Although he\u2019d decided to run with a constant speed, which meant that the drain on his physical strength was the lowest, his soulforce was still the weakest amongst the people present, and his physical strength wasn\u2019t that much different either. Being able to persevere until now was already quite difficult for him. If you looked at it from the viewpoint of the number of laps that he\u2019d completed, he was no longer the last, due to the fact that he\u2019d managed to persevere for a longer time than some.When everything in front of him started to turn black, he suddenly felt that there seemed to be a lump of fire within his stomach that was burning. He was extremely parched, and the stickiness he felt from the sweat all over his body was hard to bear. As the heavy chainmail ground against his skin through his school uniform, bursts of scorching pain passed unceasingly through his body.Not good, I can\u2019t hold on any longer. A voice continuously echoed out in Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind. He activated his soulforce and poured it into his Spirit Eyes with much difficulty.A refreshing feeling spread out from his Spirit Eyes, causing him to sober up a little.This won\u2019t do, I can\u2019t collapse like this. I will definitely persevere. As he looked at the many students running in front of him, he thought about the increase in cultivation speed that he\u2019d experienced that afternoon after the extremely large drain to his soulforce. Huo Yuhao suddenly bit his tongue, rousing himself to continue running.At this moment, he suddenly felt a comfortable, warm feeling spread out from his lower abdomen. Although his soulforce had already almost been exhausted, the warm feeling flowed slowly through his limbs and bones, causing his aching muscles to feel slightly alleviated.This is\u2026The power of the Mysterious Heaven Technique?Huo Yuhao quickly recognised the source of the warm current. After cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, it would gather in his lower abdomen at the very end. Although the time he\u2019d spent cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique so far was still short, he still had a foundation of soulforce, after all. After converting his previous soulforce into the Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s, he could be considered to have completed the first layer of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.Both his eldest senior brother and the Skydream Iceworm had said that the Mysterious Heaven Technique was very suitable for him, since it could nourish his passageways. Was it finally displaying its effects?As he pondered the matter, Huo Yuhao\u2019s consciousness very naturally followed the passageways of the Mysterious Heaven Technique, and felt it out for a moment. He didn\u2019t sense any obstructions, and the warm feeling within his lower abdomen wandered around his passageways, following his consciousness.Huo Yuhao saw that it was a weak trace of the Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s soulforce. Only, it would slowly spread into his passageways as it travelled, which was also the reason behind the warm feeling.The thing that astonished him even more was that his passageways were actually absorbing these strands of soulforce at an extremely rapid pace. This was also the source of the comfortable feeling he\u2019d felt earlier, which had in turn relieved his weariness.Huo Yuhao\u2019s natural physique wasn\u2019t that good, but he was still quite smart. The fact that the Mysterious Heaven Technique could be absorbed by him when his body reached its limit signified that he could also circulate it while moving, not just when he was meditating. The circulation of the Mysterious Heaven Technique under these circumstances was slightly different than when he was normally cultivating. The speed at which his soulforce increased in strength wasn\u2019t high, but its integration with his body was much more intimate.With this discovery, Huo Yuhao hurriedly concentrated whilst simultaneously slowing his steps. He quietly started to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique.The Tang Sect\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Technique had been brought over from another world by the first generation Tang sect master, Tang San. From a certain standpoint, it wasn\u2019t a technique that belonged to the Douluo Continent, but was definitely a top notch technique. It had extremely large benefits towards the nourishment of one\u2019s body.Due to an accident, Huo Yuhao had actually created a method of circulating the Mysterious Heaven Technique without entering a state of meditation. When it was circulated like this, the main effect of the Mysterious Heaven Technique would be to nourish one\u2019s body by using soulforce to nourish the passageways.Due to the progressive recovery that resulted from the circulation process of the Mysterious Heaven Technique, a miraculous cyclical state had formed within his body. This could be considered cultivation while moving.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t know it, but even the first generation sect master of the Tang Sect, Tang San, hadn\u2019t managed to achieve this. The reason behind this was simply because he\u2019d had richly endowed advantages. Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation, on the other hand, was still weak, which was the reason why his body was able to reach such a state, where it was at its limit. Furthermore, both his spiritual energy being very strong, combined with his possession of a spiritual-type martial soul, made it so that he could sense and manipulate the miraculous energy.The Tang Sect had birthed many experts, but none of them had possessed the conditions that the current Huo Yuhao had. After they became strong, they wouldn\u2019t easily reach their limits, and they wouldn\u2019t carefully sense the warm feeling that appeared in their dantians. It could be said that an evolution of the Mysterious Heaven Technique had appeared in Huo Yuhao\u2019s body.With the harmonization of this warm feeling, Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, which had originally reached its limit, was relieved of its exhaustion by a certain amount. Not only did this strengthen his willpower, it also made him pour more of his spiritual energy into guiding this warm feeling.The warm feeling circulated around his body, following the circulation path of the Mysterious Heaven Technique. When it completed an entire cycle, the strand would be almost fully drained. However, it was also at the moment that the cycle was completed that the warm feeling would be slightly strengthened once again, and would continue to move forward.Huo Yuhao\u2019s body was getting more and more exhausted, but he was getting more and more excited. The Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s nourishment of his passageways under his current state was exactly what he needed the most right now! His thin passageways, which he\u2019d previously needed extreme care to handle, became more elastic under the nourishment of the warm feeling, and even widened slightly. The unprecedented lack of obstruction within the areas that the warm feeling passed through told Huo Yuhao that he was doing the right thing.The number of students who\u2019d collapsed within Shrek Plaza was gradually increasing. Even the students who\u2019d been running at the very front were starting to gradually be unable to persevere. The sounds of chainmail smashing into the ground occasionally echoed out from time to time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, to his astonishment, he saw that Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes were lightly shut; they were only open enough to expose a small crack that faintly exuded a golden light. His steps were taken very slowly compared to Wang Dong\u2019s, but he was still advancing steadily. Many of the students who had higher cultivation levels than him had already collapsed, but he was still bitterly persevering. He even left a trail of sweat with every step he took.\u201cIf you can\u2019t do it, don\u2019t force yourself.\u201d Wang Dong spoke in a low voice before continuing onwards. The number of laps that he\u2019d run so far exceeded everyone else by a large margin. However, the his body was reaching its limit.Another hour passed, with the time left until the bell rang getting closer and closer. There were only nine students left that were still running around Shrek Plaza. However, the person who\u2019d been considered the \u2018bottom cushion\u2019 from the start, Huo Yuhao, was one of them.Zhou Yi had been paying attention to Huo Yuhao the entire time. She\u2019d already been astonished when only two hours had passed. Based on Huo Yuhao\u2019s physical strength and soulforce, he should\u2019ve reached his limit at two hours, no matter what the circumstances. However, he\u2019d still managed to persevere. Although running at a constant speed did give some small benefits, his cultivation and physical condition were both right there!Could a person\u2019s willpower really be strong to this extent? Furthermore, he was still so young.\u201cPutong, putong\u2026\u201d Two more students collapsed, and when they did, they created a domino effect. A few students collapsed in succession following the duo, one of them just happening to bump into Wang Dong, who was next to him.Wang Dong stumbled, his already aching legs unable to persist any longer. As he fell down, his thoughts about persevering also collapsed. However, he\u2019d run the greatest number of laps within the class; there was no one left who could exceed the number of laps that he\u2019d run.There were still three people that were still running, one of which was Huo Yuhao.After five minutes, the other two students also collapsed. The last person still running was actually Huo Yuhao, the weakest person of Class 1. Although his steps were weak, and his running speed wasn\u2019t that quick, he\u2019d still managed to persevere, even when everyone else had collapsed. This caused astonishment to appear on many students faces when they looked at him.It was true that Huo Yuhao had already reached his limit, and it was also true that the warm feeling caused by the Mysterious Heaven Technique could nourish his body and relieve his weariness to a certain extent. However, in the end, it didn\u2019t make him stronger!He\u2019d reached his limit again and again, but had clenched his teeth and endured it every single time. Huo Yuhao understood that he was the weakest amongst the students of 1, so he had to commit 200%, or even 300% of their hard work if he wanted to remain at Shrek Academy. And at this moment, tempering his body by reaching his limits could both help widen his passageways, and increase his soulforce. No matter what, he did his best to persist for every single moment.Persevere\u2026persevere! Huo Yuhao inwardly shouted to himself nonstop. At that moment, he didn\u2019t even any soulforce left that he could pour into his Spirit Eyes to stimulate himself and sober up his mind.Gradually, he himself began to sound out the \u2018chant\u2019 that he was using to support himself.\u201cMother, mother\u2026.\u201d This was all for the sake of his mother\u2019s last wishes; for the sake of being able to retrieve his mother\u2019s remains from that place one day\u2026 for the sake of washing away his mother\u2019s humiliation and avenging her\u2026 no matter what, he had to persevere.\u201cThud, thud\u2026\u201d Huo Yuhao\u2019s footsteps were extremely heavy. His legs and body were trembling uncontrollably. However, he didn\u2019t fall down. Under such difficult conditions, he still repeated the machine-like motions of raising his leg, putting it down, raising it back up, and putting it back down once again.The disdainful look that the students, who\u2019d now fallen, had been looking at him with gradually disappeared. The power that a role model provided was mighty. They started to pull themselves back up, one by one, before blankly staring at Huo Yuhao\u2019s figure as he persevered.After being stunned for a brief moment, Wang Dong was the first to continue running after Huo Yuhao. However, he didn\u2019t overtake him this time around.With Wang Dong leading, a second, and then a third person gradually began to start following him. Gradually, all of the students from Class 1 clenched their teeth and raised their legs\u2014which were already stiff to the point that they felt dead\u2014to continue running.Zhou Yi was moved. Of all the time she\u2019d been teaching, it was extremely rare that she\u2019d be moved by the performances of her students. However this time, she\u2019d truly been moved. This was because of Huo Yuhao, and in turn was also because of the ninety students who\u2019d climbed back up to follow him. This was no longer a simple exercise that could temper their bodies\u2014this was a tempering of their minds! Zhou Yi could visibly see their determination within their exhausted facial expressions.The results of this class were far, far greater than what she\u2019d imagined.\u201cDing ring ring\u2014\u201dThe bell that signalled the end of the class finally rang.Hua la, hua la. It was truly the collapse of a row of dominoes this time. The ear-piercing bell instantly caused a large number of people to collapse.The sounds of collision caused by their chainmail and the ground caused a series of sounds to echo out, and knocked a cloud of dust into the air.Huo Yuhao, who\u2019d been at the very front, finally collapsed. The bell caused him to finally let go of all of the stubborness and perseverance within his heart. However, he didn\u2019t fall directly to the ground. As he fell, Wang Dong, who was right behind him, caught him by his chainmail. As soon as he did, the two of them rolled to the ground together. The two simultaneously gasped for air together.As he looked towards the sky, Huo Yuhao\u2019s vision turned dark for a period of time. However, the passageways within his body had become comfortably warm, and felt indescribably comfortable. The soulforce within his body had been exhausted, and his physical strength had already been overdrawn way before that. And yet, his passageways still made him feel very comfortable. He had the premonition that, in all aspects, his cultivation would have a large improvement after this.Wang Dong lay beside Huo Yuhao. Both his cultivation and the condition of his body were much stronger than Huo Yuhao\u2019s, so even though he was extremely exhausted, he wasn\u2019t like Huo Yuhao, who couldn\u2019t budge at all.\u201cI really don\u2019t know what power made it so that you could endure all the way until now. You\u2019re a Soul Master with only a ten year soul ring, but you were able to persevere longer than a Soul Grandmaster like me. You\u2019re truly a freak.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled twice. He didn\u2019t even have the energy to speak anymore.Zhou Yi slowly took a deep breath, then beckoned towards the distance. A white-clothed male arrived as if he was floating on air. He arrived by Zhou Yi\u2019s side with what seemed to be a few light steps. After nodding towards her, he turned towards the students.His dazzling soul rings rose up from his feet one by one. There were two yellow ones, two purple ones, and three black ones. He actually had seven soul rings.Soul Sage! This was actually a Soul Sage-ranked expert, who was above the seventieth rank! He was already approaching the peak of soul masters! Furthermore, he only looked to be around thirty years old. Only, the vicissitudes visible within his eyes didn\u2019t match his youthful outer appearance.He raised his hands, and a gentle shade of green\u2014a leaf\u2014suddenly began to grow from his palms. His seventh soul ring flashed brightly as it revolved around him, but the students were only able to see his body flash once before it unexpectedly disappeared. The green leaf grew wildly, and in the blink of an eye, the leaf unexpectedly turned into an enormous tree that was extremely tall.A cool breeze seemed to blow past them. Then, dark green leaves began to fly out from the enormous canopy of the enormous tree. Exactly ninety-one leaves landed lightly on the bodies of the students from Class 1; not one more, and not one less.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The refreshing feeling instantly spread throughout their bodies, and no matter whether it was their aching muscles or the wounds that had been incurred by the chainmail grating against their skin, they were all recovering at an astonishing speed. Furthermore, their physical strength was gradually recovering a drop at a time. Only their soulforce was completely empty; it wasn\u2019t left completely unaffected by the dark green leaf.Wang Dong had the highest cultivation amongst everyone present, and was also the first person to recover. He flipped over and sat up before looking at the extremely tall tree with a burning gaze. He took a deep breath of the cool air. \u201cThis\u2026 this is one of the pinnacle existences amongst plant-type martial souls: The Tree of Life! It\u2019s a seventieth ranked martial soul with a Soul Avatar! Teacher Zhou actually found a plant-type soul master above the seventieth rank to heal us and help us recover.\u201dThe dark green light shrouded the area. After releasing ninety-one tree leaves, the enormous tree rapidly shrunk and transformed back into the white-clothed male in the blink of an eye. Afterwards, he nodded at Zhou Yi, who bowed respectfully towards him. That male left in the same way he\u2019d arrived\u2014like a gust of wind. From the start to end, he hadn\u2019t said a word to Zhou Yi at all.The students crawled up one after another. Although they were still exhausted, they felt an indescribable pleasure from their bodies breaking through their limits.Huo Yuhao had also recovered from his half-dazed state. After receiving nourishment from that godly soul skill, a refreshing feeling washed over his muscles and caused their exhaustion to disappear without a trace. Furthermore, the passageways within his body were still immersed in the comfortably warm feeling that the Mysterious Heaven Technique had created. It was almost as if he was feeling the comfortableness provided by both cold and hot at the same time. He\u2019d never felt such a comfortable feeling in his life before.He supported himself as he crawled back up. His entire body was covered in sweat, but his Spirit Eyes became increasingly bright. He subconsciously activated his soulforce and circulated it according to the Mysterious Heaven Technique. He found that he could actually still do it, and that the intangible changes within his body had nourished his passageways. Furthermore, since it wasn\u2019t being consumed anymore, there was still that little bit of the Mysterious Heaven Technique\u2019s internal energy left over that was able to return back to his dantian and complete a full cycle before it circulated again.Zhou Yi gazed at all the students who were slowly crawling up and indifferently said, \u201cI have to say, you all have given me an answer that astonished me quite a bit. Today, nobody will be eliminated.\u201dOnce she said this, the students couldn\u2019t help but immediately let out a cheer, especially the few who\u2019d run the least number of laps, who felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted from their minds.Zhou Yi then proceeded to say \u201cYou all need to thank Huo Yuhao. Originally, I was prepared to give you all a punishment. The task that I gave you all was for you to run until the bell rang, and then we\u2019d count the number of laps each of you ran. However, other than Huo Yuhao, none of you managed to run from the start to the end. However, since you were able to actually develop a sense of competition because of him, you don\u2019t have to have a punishment. Wang Dong, step forward.\u201d\u201cTeacher.\u201d Wang Dong took a step forward.Zhou Yi indifferently said, \u201cAs the class monitor of Class 1, you only cared about yourself\u2014you didn\u2019t set a good example for the others. From now on, you\u2019re stripped of your position of class monitor, which will be taken over by Huo Yuhao. Until the next physical class, Huo Yuhao will be the class monitor of Class 1. If anyone wants to challenge him, you\u2019re in charge of accepting them.\u201dWhen he heard what she said, Wang Dong was slightly stunned.Zhou Yi continued in a cold voice, \u201cWhat? Do you have any problems with this?\u201dOnly then did Wang Dong sober up. He shook his head and said, \u201cI have none. Teacher Zhou, I\u2019m willing to concede.\u201dZhou Yi nodded and said, \u201cDisperse. Take your set of chainmail with you. Tomorrow, another teacher will be having a class on theory with you all. I suggest that you meditate well as you digest the improvements and the significance of today\u2019s physical class. My next class will be in the afternoon, the day after next. At that time, I hope that I won\u2019t see any trash.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The students all simultaneously agreed. However, they didn\u2019t randomly disperse afterwards. Instead, they collectively charged towards Huo Yuhao and suddenly threw him into the sky.To these youths, excitement and happiness was something extremely straightforward. Because of Huo Yuhao, nobody was eliminated, and they had even been able to avoid their punishment. Thus, at least during this moment, Huo Yuhao was their hero.Furthermore, after the difficult and painful class, Teacher Zhou had found that miraculous plant-type Soul Sage to heal all of them and help them recover, which made them understand the strength of a high-ranked soul master. After the pain in their bodies had disappeared, their ill will towards Teacher Zhou had, imperceptibly, decreased by a large amount.The students continued to be rowdy for another ten minutes or so, all the way until the students from other classes had finished their classes too. Only then did they stop and start heading back to their individual dorms to clean themselves up. Their current appearances were truly too haggard.The ninety-one students didn\u2019t know this, but it was precisely because of this lesson that a collective pride had begun to gradually appear within the ninety-one of them. It had only been a single day since the class had been established, and most of them still didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s names, but a collective sense of pride had already appeared. This was undoubtedly because of Teacher Zhou\u2019s teaching methods. Combined with a certain amount of luck that Huo Yuhao\u2019s performance at the end had brought, First-year Class 1 had managed to get a step ahead of the other classes.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong directly returned to their dorm whilst wearing their chainmail. They had to use the bathrooms at the two ends of the corridors, so Wang Dong let Huo Yuhao clean up first, while he instead took a basin of water and cleaned himself up in the dorm room.At this moment, Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind was still immersed in a special state of understanding towards the Mysterious Heaven Technique. He didn\u2019t think much of it, and went to shower instead. However, the circulation of the Mysterious Heaven Technique within his body hadn\u2019t stopped since he\u2019d started circulating it in the new manner that he discovered. He discovered that the warm stream that had been unceasingly generated had already started to become weaker and weaker.Why? Is it because my physical strength has recovered? Huo Yuhao was greatly puzzled. After he finished cleaning himself up, he faintly guessed the reason as to why it had happened. That warm feeling seemed to only appear when both his soulforce and his body were nearly exhausted. And right now, since his body had already recovered by a large amount, and his soulforce was also slowly recovering, that warm flow wouldn\u2019t be produced anymore.If I\u2019d known earlier, it would\u2019ve been better for me to not recover. Huo Yuhao was somewhat helpless as he thought to himself. If that was the case, perhaps his passageways might\u2019ve been able to obtain even more benefits.However, Teacher left the chainmail for us. I can try it out by myself later. Once he thought of this, he couldn\u2019t help but feel excited.\u201cHuo Yuhao.\u201d At this moment, a shout that woke him up from his excitement echoed out.Huo Yuhao inwardly chastised himself. How could he have forgotten about her? He hurriedly shouted from the corridor, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d Then, he rapidly ran back to his dorm room, planning to put on his other school uniform before going out.Because he was in a rush, he didn\u2019t bother knocking on the door when he got there. He pushed the door open and entered, but when he entered, he was flabbergasted\u2026What he saw was a white\u2026 rear view.As Huo Yuhao\u2019s gaze traced his round, narrow shoulders, the contours of a soft arc appeared by his waist. He had a pair of straight and thin legs which were more delicate than an ordinary person\u2019s. Due to his age, none of his features were exaggerated. However, his fair skin, which still had droplets of water dripping from it, appeared crystal clear. The assault to Huo Yuhao\u2019s vision was simply too strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Following that, the patch of white in front of Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes became a patch of dazzling blue.A pair of enormous wings suddenly spread out, and what immediately followed that was a V-shape made of golden haloes that suddenly brightened. The sapphire blue wings subsequently turned a blueish-violet. A strong undulation of soulforce immediately rushed out, as if it wanted to devour him.Fortunately, the wave-like soulforce still stopped in the end.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why didn\u2019t you knock?\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s anger-filled voice echoed out. The blue light vanished, and when Huo Yuhao looked again, he\u2019d already put on a set of school clothes. He\u2019d suddenly charged over, but hadn\u2019t made a move against Huo Yuhao in the end. This was because Huo Yuhao, who had just cleaned himself up, was only wearing his boxers now; his entire body was clean. However, when one compared the colour of his skin to Wang Dong\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t just a difference of colour. Huo Yuhao\u2019s skin flickered with a healthy copper colour, but it was far inferior to Wang Dong\u2019s enchanting white skin\u2026\u201cI\u2026 someone outside called for me. I was in a hurry, sorry!\u201d Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t know why, but his heartbeat had turned especially quick. He hurriedly ran to his bed and grabbed his clean school uniform before turning around and quickly running outside.Wang Dong stood there blankly, not stopping Huo Yuhao. Only when Huo Yuhao had shut the door and run off did he come back to his senses. Flashes of both red and white appeared on his face, but he didn\u2019t know what to do about it.After hurriedly running out of the dorm room, Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind calmed down a bit. However, that white patch still lingered in his mind. Especially those buttocks, which already stuck out a bit\u2026What am I thinking about! Huo Yuhao felt some self-disdain towards himself. He hurriedly shifted his thoughts towards the Mysterious Heaven Technique,His ear suddenly hurt, and he let out a pained cry.Tang Ya\u2019s playful voice sounded out, \u201cYou still know how to cry out? I\u2019ve been waiting here for a long time.\u201dHuo Yuhao miserably said, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, please let go. We just had a physical class that made me sweat a lot, so wouldn\u2019t I first return to my dorm to clean up before I came?\u201dOnly then did Tang Ya let go of him. As she looked at Huo Yuhao\u2019s slightly pale face, her eyebrows furrowed. She said, \u201cIs that perverted grandma Zhou Yi making things hard for you guys? You have to be a bit more careful, as she\u2019s always been widely known as an iron mask. You\u2019ll lose a layer of skin, if not die, if you offend her. How is it? Is your body still fine? If you\u2019re not fine, then so be it. We can talk tomorrow.\u201dHuo Yuhao hurriedly shook his head and said, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Today\u2019s physical training had brought him take one step closer to realising that he needed nutrients, and a large amount of nutrients at that. That warm feeling created by the Mysterious Heaven Technique had disappeared, but it caused an intense surge of hunger to rise up from his body. If he had no money, what could he buy to eat?Tang Ya giggled and said, \u201cThen you can roast twenty fish. I\u2019ve prepared them for you. It won\u2019t take too much of your time, but it\u2019ll definitely take less than you working for the academy.\u201d\u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, then where are we going to sell them?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked.Clearly. Tang Ya had already thought about it thoroughly. \u201cAt the academy\u2019s entrance! Our Shrek Academy\u2019s entrance is the eastern gate of Shrek City, and there has always been many peddlers outside. Furthermore, there\u2019s no lack of academy students who do business there. With your skill in roasting fish, we won\u2019t need to be afraid of not selling any if we go there. Even if we\u2019re unable to sell them, we can just eat them for ourselves.\u201dHuo Yuhao followed Tang Ya all the way until they reached the gate. When they stepped outside, Huo Yuhao was astonished. As of now, there were no longer any students here to enroll. Instead, both sides of the eastern gate\u2019s main road were swarming with peddlers. The peddlers were selling everything that could possibly be imagined, and their goods looked like glittering jewels. Out of the goods that were on display, the large variety of food was the greatest. Moreover, the sounds of hawkers doing their job never stopped. Clearly, the reason that they\u2019d gathered here was for the sake of doing business with the students of Shrek Academy.Tang Ya was clearly slightly impatient. In an area that wasn\u2019t too far from the city gates, she took out the stuff that she\u2019d prepared. She even took up a bit of the main road.She was clearly completely prepared. She had a metal grill that had been specially made by a smith, metal stands, various seasonings, as well as mackerels that had already been cleaned. She\u2019d even brought a small table for the sake of setting all of her stuff down.As Huo Yuhao helped her set up the grill, he couldn\u2019t help but find it funny. Teacher Xiao Ya\u2019s resistance towards delicious food was really low!Tang Ya also took out the charcoal and put it on the floor before saying, \u201cOkay, my job is done. Everything else is up to you. I\u2019m gonna go buy some other stuff to eat, just remember that two of these fish are mine. Just sell them for five copper coins. In the future, if you want to buy ingredients, just find your canteen\u2019s Aunty Lin.\u201dAfter saying this, she excitedly ran off.Huo Yuhao checked the amount ingredients that he had before he prepared the mackerels. The number of ingredients that he had was truly large, and Tang Ya was quite considerate. She\u2019d even brought him some purple basil. Huo Yuhao tore up the purple basil, then stirred it together with some of the other ingredients. After the ingredients were ready, he stuffed them into the belly of the mackerels, then used a bamboo stick to skewer them one-by-one.Today\u2019s physical class had made him understand many things, so he was anxious to go back and cultivate. Naturally, he didn\u2019t want to waste too much time here.Simply lighting a fire was as easy as a walk in the park for him, so after a moment\u2019s work, the oven already had a few bright red pieces of burning coal inside of it. The oven was quite big, and was able to hold four fish at once. Thus, he roasted the fish directly.It had to be said that Huo Yuhao\u2019s level of skill with roasting fish was truly unrivalled. Not long after he\u2019d started, a strong fragrance had already diffused outwards from his makeshift stall. This was better than any other form of advertisement. Not even mentioning the students from the academy, even the surrounding peddlers couldn\u2019t help but cast a few curious gazes at him.A male student who was wearing a yellow school uniform walked over and asked, \u201cLittle brother, how much are you selling these roasted fish for?\u201dHuo Yuhao answered with a very polite tone, \u201cSenior, the roasted fishes are five copper coins each.\u201dThat student was very straightforward. \u201cIt smells quite good. Let me try one.\u201d While he spoke, he handed five copper soul coins to Huo Yuhao.This was Huo Yuhao\u2019s first successful transaction, so he couldn\u2019t help but feel excited. After receiving the copper coins, he became even more serious while roasting the fish, so much so that he even roused some of the soulforce he\u2019d just recovered in order to use his Spiritual Detection to better control the heat.With the first customer, there would naturally be more people who\u2019d come over. Only, this was the first time that Huo Yuhao had appeared here. His fish smelled quite good, and nobody knew how they tasted. Practically all of the people who came over were students from Shrek Academy who\u2019d just been dismissed for the day.When Huo Yuhao passed the roasted mackerel over to the yellow-shirted student, everyone else couldn\u2019t help but look at him in expectation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 12.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12.1: Xu Sanshi and Jiang NannanThe mackerel, which had turned a golden brown, still had oil dripping off it, and a strong aroma gushed unceasingly from its belly. When the man\u2019s bit into the roasted fish, a light crackling sound came from it. The roasted fish\u2019s skin had actually been roasted until it was crispy, but it wasn\u2019t burnt at all. However, what lay underneath the crispy layer of the skin was the fresh, tender, succulent meat of the fish, which was packed with flavour.It was only a single bite, but that yellow-shirted student\u2019s eyes widened in shock. He didn\u2019t even stop to praise it. Instead, he ate the entire fish almost as fast as he could.The other nearby students, who\u2019d been observing Huo Yuhao from the sidelines, immediately understood what had happened. The other three mackerels that Huo Yuhao had roasted so far were instantly bought, and his total sales revenue directly increased to twenty copper soul coins, which was equivalent to two silver soul coins.These four roasted fish caused Huo Yuhao to gain an \u2018exceptional\u2019 reputation in a very short period of time. This was the academy\u2019s entrance, so the number of people that passed him was extremely great. His small booth quickly became surrounded by a nearly-impenetrable crowd.\u201cToo tasty, that was really too tasty.\u201d The yellow-shirted student who\u2019d bought the first roasted fish managed to squeeze back in, albeit with much difficulty. \u201cJunior brother, give me three more roasted fish. I\u2019ll have my dinner here tonight.\u201dA purple-clothed student who was one year older than him coldly responded, \u201cGo to the back of the line.\u201dHuo Yuhao didn\u2019t think that his roasted fish would sell so well. He spoke apologetically to the students surrounding the oven, \u201cFellow classmates and seniors, it\u2019s my first day doing business, thus I can only sell eighteen roasted fish. I sold four fish earlier, but I still have fourteen left. Following the principle of \u2018first come, first serve\u2019, those who aren\u2019t lined up should come back tomorrow.\u201dAs he spoke, he put away the money that he\u2019d so far into the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. After selling eighteen fish, he\u2019d made nine silver soul coins. If he deducted the costs of production, what was left was enough for him to both eat his fill and save some. Huo Yuhao wasn\u2019t greedy; he understand that the most important for him right now was to cultivate. Having enough money to survive was good enough.Skewers of roasted fish came out of the grill one after another as Huo Yuhao continued to roast the fish with extreme seriousness. He didn\u2019t decrease their quality due to the number of people. Every single person who chose to buy one of his roasted fish was incomparably satisfied, with some people even choosing to order fish for tomorrow in advance. After some consideration, Huo Yuhao still decided to stick with a queue model. After all, the taste of hot food was the greatest when it had just finished cooking. If someone were to eat it any later, its flavour would\u2019ve diminished.At this moment, a few female students wearing purple school uniforms walked out of the gate to Shrek Academy. Her appearance immediately attracted countless gazes.She only looked to be about fourteen or fifteen, and her figure was slender and well proportioned. Her golden hair was draped behind her shoulders like a waterfall, and her skin was snow-white. Her eyes were akin to clear water, and when she looked around, she had an elegant temperament. Her face resembled jade, a crescent halo, as well as snow around a flowering tree. She had a gentle beauty, a charming voice, a lovable appearance, and an extraordinary beauty that couldn\u2019t be found anywhere else. Her beauty, that seemed as if it could cause the downfall of a country, seemed to dull the colours of everything else around her.\u201cSister Nan, something smells good. What\u2019s that smell?\u201d A student beside the exceedingly beautiful young lady asked curiously. Her looks were also extraordinary, but unfortunately, how could fireflies next to the moon emit any radiance?The exceedingly beautiful young lady had clearly also smelled the aroma. All of the girls couldn\u2019t help but cast their gazes towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s booth.Perhaps the beauty of that young lady was too imposing, but the students who\u2019d originally been in line in front of Huo Yuhao\u2019s booth actually opened up a path for her. She, and the other female students she was with, walked towards the oven. Only, when the exceedingly beautiful young lady saw everyone taking the initiative to open a path for her, she wasn\u2019t arrogant at all. Instead, she carried an extremely warm smile and nodded her head towards them in thanks. All of the students who saw her smile had flushed faces filled with excitement.When Huo Yuhao saw the exceedingly beautiful young lady, he blanked out. Previously, the most beautiful girl he\u2019d ever seen had been was Tang Ya, but not only was the purple-clothed female student in front of him not inferior to Tang Ya, she even had both a gentle and warm temperament. When you added that to her somewhat melancholic expression, she had a beautiful and moving appearance. Compared to her, Tang Ya was a lively and cheerful, easy-go-lucky girl. As for their appearances, it simply depended on one\u2019s preference.\u201cJunior brother, how much are you selling these roasted fish for?\u201d The exceedingly beautiful young lady asked quietly.At this moment, Huo Yuhao had just sold the last of the eighteen roasted fish he\u2019d had. The last two remaining fish on the grill were for Tang Ya.\u201cSenior sister, they\u2019re five copper soul coins each.\u201dThe exceedingly beautiful young lady furrowed her brow, then said, \u201cThis is a bit expensive. If we consider how much it costs for the ingredients, plus the work you\u2019ve put in, three copper soul coins\u2014at most\u2014should be fine. You\u2019ll still make a profit.\u201dHuo Yuhao was stunned. He hadn\u2019t thought that a young lady as beautiful as her would actually haggle with him. None of his previous customers had done this.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my roasted fish are sold at a fixed priced. Furthermore, I\u2019ve already sold all of my fish for the day.\u201d Huo Yuhao spoke with a flat tone. Tang Ya was the one who\u2019d set the price, so he wouldn\u2019t change it easily. Moreover, this income was very important to him, and was just enough for him as-is.The exceedingly beautiful young lady was stunned for a moment, then apologetically said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was just making a casual calculation. If there\u2019s a chance in the future, I\u2019ll try your roasted fish.\u201d As she said this, she turned around and walked away from Huo Yuhao\u2019s temporary booth.Huo Yuhao clearly sensed that the surrounding atmosphere had become somewhat abnormal. Many of the students that had previously been looking fervently at him were now glaring at him.\u201cBrat, you dare not to sell it?\u201d A deep voice full of anger suddenly rang out, immediately followed by a golden light that shot towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s booth.\u201cDing\u2014\u201d The golden light accurately struck his grill. In fact, it actually embedded itself in it. Impressively, it was a golden soul coin. Following that, a figure walked towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s booth with large strides, until he quickly arrived in front of it. As soon as he arrived, he stretched his hand out to grab the two roasted fish.Because roasting fish required precise control over the heat, Huo Yuhao had kept his Spirit Eyes activated this whole time. When that deep voice rang out, he\u2019d sensed an enormous pressure arrive. Thus, he\u2019d subconsciously released his Spiritual Detection.Although the hand that reached towards the roasted fish was very quick, Huo Yuhao managed to predict the movements of the other party via his Spiritual Detection, allowing him to grab the two skewers of roasted fish before retreating backwards a few steps. He\u2019d set these fish aside especially for Tang Ya. How could he let other people take them?The person who\u2019d tried to grab the roasted fish actually grabbed a few pieces of charcoal from the oven instead of the fish in his hurry.At that moment, Huo Yuhao was able to clearly see the appearance of the newcomer.He was wearing a black school uniform; he was actually a sixth-year student. He looked to be around Bei Bei\u2019s age, and had a tall figure that was comparable to He Caitou\u2019s. He had bushy eyebrows, as well as eyes that resembled that of a tiger\u2019s. He also had a straight nose, a square-shaped mouth, along with a grand appearance. His fair skin had already been suffused with a few shades of red due to his anger, while his face, which still seemed to contain some baby fat, was quite imposing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 12.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12.2: Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan\u201cBrat, are you courting death?\u201d The black-shirted youth roared angrily. He actually crushed the coals he\u2019d grabbed within his hands, causing sparks to fly everywhere. However, he didn\u2019t seem to have been burnt by them at all. He swept his right leg out, kicking Huo Yuhao\u2019s grill to one side. At the same time, he stepped forward and used his large hands to grab Huo Yuhao by the shirt.Using his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao realised that this black-shirted youth wasn\u2019t just being overbearing. His \u2018simple\u2019 grab actually contained countless variations in it, and although Huo Yuhao was able to make out some weaknesses in it, his cultivation was too weak to make use of them. Thus, he wasn\u2019t able to dodge, and was thus grabbed by the shirt by the black-shirted youth.\u201cHey.\u201d The black-shirted youth raised his right hand, lifting Huo Yuhao into the air. At the same time, he forcefully snatched the two skewers of roasted fish from Huo Yuhao.The entire process, from the time that the black-shirted youth had appeared to him making his move, happened incomparably quickly\u2014to the extent that the surrounding people were only just realising what had just happened.Two voices echoed out at practically the same time.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cStay your hand.\u201dThe former was the exceedingly beautiful young lady, who currently had a startled and angry expression. The latter had already charged over with as fast as lightning and had used his palm in an attempt to directly knock the black-shirted youth away.Clearly, the black-shirted youth hadn\u2019t thought that someone would make a move against him. Thus, he wasn\u2019t able to protect himself in time. He was using one hand to hold Huo Yuhao, while using another to hold onto the roasted fish. If he wanted to defend himself from his opponent\u2019s attack, he would had to forfeit one of the two.He chose to let go of Huo Yuhao. With a flick of his wrist, Huo Yuhao was sent flying horizontally. He then lowered his right hand to collide with the incoming hand.\u201cPa\u2014\u201d The two people simultaneously trembled, then both took a step back. In this clash, neither of them had managed to take the upper hand.The newcomer wasn\u2019t some random person; it was Huo Yuhao\u2019s eldest senior brother, Bei Bei.Huo Yuhao, who\u2019d been flung into the air, spun around in the air twice. However, an attractive figure appeared below him and used her hands to catch and lower him steadily to the ground.The person who helped Huo Yuhao was naturally Tang Ya. At this moment, her originally small and charming face was filled with rage.\u201cXu Sanshi, you dare to bully one of my men? I\u2019m gonna beat the shit out of you.\u201d As she said that, Tang Ya raised her hand, causing a golden light to fly directly towards Xu Sanshi.The black-shirted youth waved his right hand, causing a sharp black light to flash as he attempted to sweep away the golden light. However, an astonishing scene occurred: The golden light suddenly brightened, unexpectedly burrowing its way through that strong black soulforce, before burying itself and disappearing inside of the black-shirted youth.The black-shirted youth\u2019s body trembled violently, and his gaze suddenly froze. Afterwards, his tiger-like eyes flared with anger, and his three soul rings instantly rose up from his legs\u2014there were two yellow rings and one purple ring. His originally pale skin immediately darkened as his muscles expanded, and his entire body seemed to swell up. The most peculiar thing was that a tortoiseshell shield\u2014which had a diameter of around one metre\u2014had appeared in his right hand.Huo Yuhao activated his Spiritual Detection, allowing him to sense that the martial soul released by the black-shirted youth had a level of grandeur that wasn\u2019t any weaker than the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon that Bei Bei possessed.\u201cTang Ya, don\u2019t think that I can\u2019t do anything to you just because you have Bei Bei protecting you.\u201d As the black-shirted youth let out a low roar, his eyes lit up with anger.Tang Ya laughed coldly. \u201cCome! Did you think that I\u2019d be afraid of trash like you?\u201dBei Bei indifferently said, \u201cXu Sanshi, you\u2019ve bullied my junior brother. You\u2019ll have to give me an explanation for today\u2019s matter. If not, we\u2019ll go to the Soul Dueling Arena and settle it with an official fight.\u201dXu Sanshi trembled slightly as he pointed at Huo Yuhao and asked, \u201cHe\u2019s your junior brother?\u201dBei Bei expressionlessly nodded his head.Xu Sanshi coldly said, \u201cSo what? He didn\u2019t give Jiang Nannan any face, nor did he didn\u2019t give me any face either. It was just two skewers of roasted fish, and I already paid for them.\u201dTang Ya angrily said, \u201cThose were the fish that Huo Yuhao had saved for me. Bei Bei, why are you still listening to his bullshit? Beat him up! Beat him up until he can\u2019t move anymore. I\u2019ll give you a kiss later.\u201dBei Bei\u2019s face, which he\u2019d originally been carefully controlling, finally twitched when he heard Tang Ya\u2019s impish words, who seemed to want to see the world burn right now.Xu Sanshi curled his lip and said to Bei Bei, \u201cYour Tang Ya\u2019s still so berserk, I see. I haven\u2019t compared notes with you in a long time; why don\u2019t we immediately go to the Soul Dueling Arena? Let\u2019s go!\u201dAs he was speaking, he turned around and walked away without pausing at all. With a few steps he arrived in front of the exceedingly beautiful lady named Jiang Nannang. His previously angry expression actually turned tender the instant he arrived, and he passed the two skewers of roasted fish to her. He then spoke in a gentle voice. \u201cNannan, you can eat first. I\u2019ll be back later.\u201dHowever, Jiang Nannan wasn\u2019t grateful at all. She was always very kind towards everyone else, but she was as cold as ice towards Xu Sanshi. She proceeded to speak in a cold voice, \u201cXu Sanshi, I\u2019ve told you before. There\u2019s no possibility of anything happening between us. Please stop bothering me in the future.\u201d Once she\u2019d finished saying this, she turned around and walked away.A burst of embarrassment appeared on Xu Sanshi\u2019s face. He suddenly straightened his body and stared angrily at the crowd, who\u2019d in-turn been watching the show. \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at? Go away. Bei Bei, let\u2019s go.\u201d After saying this, he walked towards the academy. The roasted fish in his hand were thrown towards Huo Yuhao.Tang Ya stood in front of Huo Yuhao and raised her hand to catch the fish. Her movements were very smooth and gentle, yet she seemed to have caught the fish in a very natural manner. She bluntly took a bite out of one, while she used her hand to pull Huo Yuhao with her as she ate. \u201cLet\u2019s go watch something fun.\u201dThe Soul Dueling Arena was an extremely important location within Shrek Academy. It was located on the northwestern corner of the Martial Soul Institution, and was close to Shrek Academy. In fact, it wasn\u2019t that far from the Soul Tool Testing Area that Huo Yuhao had visited before. This was a place that many students from all years would frequent. You could carry out various types of competitions within this building, with specialised teachers to act as referees. The referees were responsible for determining the victor of each competition, and were also responsible for protecting the students, providing assistance students who needed it, healing injured students, and such. Naturally, all of this needed to be paid for.When carrying out a duel in the Soul Dueling Arena, each party would need to pay a minimum of ten gold soul coins for arena expenses. However, many students never grew bored of these competitions, due to the fact that there were no restrictions whilst competing here. Furthermore, you didn\u2019t need to be afraid of any dangerous situations if you were too heavy-handed, since the teachers who were acting as referees would keep everything under control. At the same time, students who won a match within the Soul Dueling Arena would obtain a certain amount of credits, which would, in turn, increase one\u2019s marks by a certain amount during their annual advancement test.Past their fourth year, students who wanted to continue on to become fifth-years and sixth-years would need Soul Duelling Credits. A fourth-year student who wanted to become a fifth-year student would need at least ten victories within the Soul Dueling Arena over students from his same year group, while advancing from a fifth-year to a sixth-year required even more credits. Soul Duelling Credits were supposedly even more important when one wanted to enter the inner courtyard after becoming a sixth-year.All competitions within the Soul Dueling Arena were open to all students, but the entrance fee was one silver soul coin.What astonished Huo Yuhao the most was the fact that Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi\u2019s duel actually attracted the attention of so many students. An overwhelming majority of the students who\u2018d been watching the liveliness outside actually chose to go watch the duel, with no care for what year they were.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the academy is as large as it is, its expenses are naturally just as large. If they hadn\u2019t thought of a way to make money, how would they be able to maintain the academy? However, the taxes the academy levels in Shrek City aren\u2019t little either. In any case, our academy is the continent\u2019s number one academy in terms of prosperity. Right, little Yuhao, the standard of your roasted fish has improved even more. It\u2019s either that, or the ingredients that I got you are better, since it tastes so good.\u201dTang Ya finished her two skewers of roasted fish long before they reached the Soul Dueling Arena. Huo Yuhao was already hungry, so he went ahead and bought some dinner when they walked by the canteen. When he and Tang Ya arrived at the Soul Dueling Arena, there were many people flooding into it. As the news of Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei\u2019s duel began to spread like wildfire, more and more students streamed towards the Soul Dueling Arena.Tang Ya paid two silver soul coins and brought Huo Yuhao into the Soul Dueling Arena. The Soul Dueling Arena was hexagonal, and was roughly as big as Shrek Plaza. The centre of the Soul Dueling Arena was a large open area, which was clearly the place where students would duel against one another. Furthermore, it was surrounded by around three thousand chairs that rose progressively upwards.When they entered, there were already two to three hundred students sitting around the battlefield. Tang Ya and Huo Yuhao had arrived relatively early on, so they managed to obtain seats in the row that was closest to the battlefield. On the other hand, the battlefield in front of them was empty; it was unknown where Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi were.Tang Ya knew that Huo Yuhao was unfamiliar with the rules for the Soul Dueling Arena. Thus, she decided to explain them to him. \u201cThe Soul Dueling Arena is open everyday, from dismissal to midnight. Students who wish to carry out a duel have to first pay the fee and register. If both parties are fairly famous students in the academy, the academy will use a soul tool called a \u2018megaphone\u2019 to broadcast the event in order to attract more viewers. The academy will then keep half of the ticketing fees, while the winner will keep the other half. Your eldest senior brother\u2019s already made quite a bit of money from dueling. Furthermore, that Xu Sanshi is a fifth-year student, whereas he\u2019s just become a fourth-year. Since they\u2019re separated by an entire year, it\u2019s considered a challenge that bypasses what year they\u2019re in. Thus, that Xu Sanshi will have to give Bei Bei an additional ten gold soul coins if he loses. Your eldest senior brother and that Xu Sanshi are both extremely famous students in the outer courtyard\u2014they\u2019re both acclaimed as geniuses. I\u2019m guessing that the number of people who\u2019ll show up to watch will exceed five hundred.\u201dHuo Yuhao asked, \u201cThen who was that Jiang Nannan?\u201dTang Ya raised her hand and hit Huo Yuhao on the head. \u201cYou\u2019ve already learnt bad things at such a young age? You\u2019re already looking at pretty girls? Hmph!\u201dHuo Yuhao felt his head throb, and didn\u2019t dare to ask again. Instead, he chose to take out his lunchbox and start eating dinner.When she saw his naive appearance, Tang Ya couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you. Jiang Nannan is known as the outer courtyard\u2019s number one beauty. She comes from an ordinary family, and treats everybody kindly. She has countless fans within the academy. Do you think that she\u2019s prettier than me?\u201dHuo Yuhao hurriedly shook his head a few times.Tang Ya was somewhat pleased as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s stronger than me in any other area either, hmph! That guy, Xu Sanshi, has a very strong mutated martial soul known as the Mysterious Underworld Turtle. It\u2019s a dual-attribute martial soul that possesses both the water and the earth element, and has an extremely strong defense. It\u2019s been called an impenetrable fortress by some. His cultivation is around the same level as Bei Bei\u2019s, and they both have first-rate martial souls. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already vented some anger for you. I threw a Dragon Beard Needle at him, which should be unbearable for him. If he wants to pursue Jiang Nannan, so be it, but it won\u2019t do if he hurts any of my people in the process. Speaking of strange, I\u2019m beginning to think that Jiang Nannan has a problem with her gender orientation. There are an endless number of outstanding male students pursuing her, but she\u2019s never taken a liking to any of them. When she rejects other people, she does it with a gentle tone. However, when she rejects Xu Sanshi, it\u2019s with a rarely-seen coldness. I don\u2019t know if this is because Xu Sanshi took advantage of her in some way. On the other hand, these people who are coming to watch Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi are really innocent! They only know that Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi are respectively known to possess the outer courtyard\u2019s strongest attack-type martial soul and the outer courtyard\u2019s strongest defense-type martial soul. However, they don\u2019t know that these two know each other. I\u2019m guessing that they\u2019ve colluded to both earn some money\u2014that\u2019s why so many of them ran over to the Soul Dueling Arena.\u201dHuo Yuhao spoke with astonishment, \u201cEldest senior brother and that Xu Sanshi know each other?\u201dTang Ya nodded. \u201cLittle Yuhao, don\u2019t worry. Even though they know each other, your eldest senior brother will still compete against him fiercely. He won\u2019t let Xu Sanshi bully you for no reason.\u201dSoul Dueling Arena, lobby.\u201cBei Bei, your Tang Ya is too vicious. Look at this, just look at this\u2026\u201d Xu Sanshi had a dissatisfied expression as he lifted his jacket to show Bei Bei something. A bulge the size of an infant\u2019s fist had already swelled up on the right side of his waist. Only, he continued to release his martial soul, causing the skin surrounding that bulge to seemingly become as hard as metal.Bei Bei snorted and replied, \u201cServes you right. Who asked you to bully our junior brother? Less bullshit, give me a Mysterious Water Pill and I\u2019ll remove the Dragon Beard Needle for you. If not, then you can wait till it digs out a piece of your flesh. This Dragon Beard Needle was left behind by the first-generation ancestor of the Tang Sect, and was only passed down to the successive sect masters. Xiao Ya was really angry this time.\u201dXu Sanshi said, \u201cThat brat was actually someone who belonged to your Tang Sect? He doesn\u2019t look like he has any ability at all! Forget about the Mysterious Water Pill, quickly help me! This Dragon Beard Needle is too toxic, it hurts like hell. It\u2019s also specialised in breaking through soulforce. I can\u2019t believe I actually fell into Tang Ya\u2019s trap because of my carelessness. This is really depressing.\u201dBei Bei looked towards the sky and replied, \u201cWhatever. If you don\u2019t want to give it to me, don\u2019t give it to me. You hit my junior brother, plus you even wrecked his booth. You can slowly endure this Dragon Beard Needle then. The duel\u2019s going to start soon anyway. I don\u2019t believe that you\u2019ll be able to compete against me with that Dragon Beard Needle in you.\u201dXu Sanshi snorted angrily. \u201cFine, Bei Bei, just wait. You just watch how I take care of you in the Soul Duelling Arena later. I won\u2019t be lenient towards you at all.\u201dBei Bei smiled and said, \u201cDo I need you to be lenient towards me?\u201d As he spoke, he extended his right hand towards Xu Sanshi and made a gesture.Xu Sanshi unwillingly took out a delicate bottle made out of white jade and threw it towards Bei Bei. Bei Bei caught it and said, \u201cMany thanks. Now, withdraw your martial soul, I\u2019ll help you remove the Dragon Beard Needle.\u201dOnly then did Xu Sanshi slowly withdraw his martial soul. Without the restrictive effect of his martial soul, waves of unbearable pain immediately spread from the Dragon Beard Needle into his body. Even with his cultivation level and willpower, Xu Sanshi actually couldn\u2019t stop his body from trembling.Bei Bei used his right hand to rapidly tap a few points surrounding Xu Sanshi\u2019s wound. Afterwards, he simultaneously moved both of his hands, causing waves of gentle soulforce to unceasingly pour into Xu Sanshi\u2019s cramped muscles. After a moment\u2019s work, a hair-like golden strand slowly came out from Xu Sanshi\u2019s waist muscles.Bei Bei pulled it out softly, causing the golden strand to pop out of Xu Sanshi\u2019s body, before quickly shrinking into a golden grain-sized pea. With a flip of his wrist, Bei Bei quickly put it away.Xu Sanshi let out a long sigh, as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders. However, he still had an angry expression. \u201cBei Bei, you\u2019re taking advantage of me. You know how valuable this Mysterious Water Pill is. How about this? Let\u2019s make a bet. If I win our match later on, you\u2019ll return that Mysterious Water Pill to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I know that the Mysterious Water Pill isn\u2019t worth only a thousand gold soul coins. I won\u2019t make an unfair bet with you.\u201dXu Sanshi angrily retorted, \u201cI only have that much money. If you don\u2019t agree, I\u2019m going to get very angry.\u201dBei Bei sighed softly and said, \u201cDo I look like I lack money? Fine, I\u2019ll give you a chance. I know you still have more Mysterious Water Pills. Take another one out and use it as the wager.\u201dA trace of suspicion appeared in Xu Sanshi\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019ve fallen into your trap? It seems like you\u2019re sure that you can beat me.\u201dBei Bei still kept a warm smile on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re the person who wanted to make a bet, not me. You can still choose not to bet. Also, don\u2019t moan and groan when you lose to me later on.\u201dXu Sanshi snorted and said, \u201cMe, lose? Although I can\u2019t guarantee that I can beat you, it won\u2019t be easy for you to beat me either. If we were to tie, how would our bet work?\u201dHowever, Bei Bei wasn\u2019t fooled by him. \u201cThen we\u2019ll each keep what we already have. Hurry up, stop acting like a sissy.\u201dXu Sanshi clenched his teeth and said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll bet with you. You bastard. You might not be stronger than me, but you\u2019re extremely crafty. I reckon that I\u2019ve been tricked by you again. If worst comes to worst, I\u2019ll just go suck up to my dad when I get back.\u201dBei Bei\u2019s still had a smile on his face. Although Xu Sanshi was trying his best to look for a change in his expression, he wasn\u2019t able to notice anything.\u201cYou! You\u2019re not really stupid, but you\u2019ll immediately turn foolish towards any matter that Jiang Nannan\u2019s involved in. I really don\u2019t know whether you two were some sort of enemies in your previous life. Even though Jiang Nannan is pretty, there are many excellent female students in Shrek Academy. Why do you insist on giving your unrequited love to a flower?\u201dXu Sanshi unhappily said, \u201cDon\u2019t be an armchair expert. If you\u2019re so against with it, why don\u2019t you give Tang Ya to me?\u201dBei Bei stood up and retorted, \u201cYou\u2019d better quickly adjust your body\u2019s condition so that you won\u2019t be unconvinced when you lose later. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d He\u2019d already started to walk out as he spoke.Tang Ya\u2019s predictions were spot on. The number of students that had gathered in the Soul Dueling Area had gradually increased, and currently it exceeded four hundred. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all to gather five hundred students by the time the duel started.\u201cHuo Yuhao.\u201d A voice that was fuming with anger caused Huo Yuhao to be startled. When he turned around to see who it was, he saw the tidily dressed Wang Dong aggressively walking towards him.\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked with a somewhat guilty tone. When he saw Wang Dong, he immediately recalled that white scene\u2026Wang Dong\u2019s face had both shades of red and white on it. He sat down next to Huo Yuhao and spoke with a low voice, \u201cTell me, what did you see?\u201dHuo Yuhao was stunned for a moment. Then he replied, \u201cAh? I didn\u2019t see anything!\u201dWang Dong snorted angrily. \u201cIf you don\u2019t knock next time, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dHuo Yuhao knew that he was in the wrong, but he still muttered to himself, \u201cWe\u2019re all men\u2026it\u2019s not like you\u2019d suffer a loss if I saw anything.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Wang Dong flew into a rage and raised his hand to grab Huo Yuhao.A slender palm stretched over and slapped Wang Dong\u2019s hand away. Afterwards, Tang Ya\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cLittle Yuhao, you haven\u2019t introduced him to me.\u201dOnly then did Wang Dong notice Tang Ya\u2019s existence. When he saw Tang Ya\u2019s exceedingly beautiful face, he was slightly stunned. However, he quickly regained his composure and snorted, before choosing to ignore Huo Yuhao. At first, after Huo Yuhao had run off, Wang Dong had quickly put his clothes on. However, he hadn\u2019t been able to find any traces of Huo Yuhao\u2019s existence. He\u2019d wanted to meditate, but wasn\u2019t able to calm himself down at all. At that exact moment, he heard the announcement that was broadcast to the dorms. Thus, he decided to go out and relieve some of his boredom. However, he didn\u2019t think that he\u2019d bump into Huo Yuhao and Tang Ya here.Huo Yuhao quickly said, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, this is my roommate Wang Dong. Wang Dong, this is Tang Ya, one of our senior classmates.\u201d He was only able to give a simple introduction such as this.Wang Dong nodded towards Tang Ya, who smiled and said, \u201cWhat a pretty young boy! I like him! Little Yuhao, how about you persuade him to join our Tang Sect?\u201dWhen Wang Dong heard the two words \u2018Tang Sect\u2019, his body trembled slightly. Astonished, he said, \u201cBoth of you are from the Tang Sect?\u201dTang Ya nodded her head a few times and said, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s only three of us left in the Tang Sect. I\u2019m the current sect master of the Tang Sect. How about it, are you astonished? Come, come, the Tang Sect welcomes you.\u201dEven though Tang Ya was usually a very carefree person, and although she was just casually saying this without thinking the matter through, anyone who thought she was dim-witted would eventually suffer a huge loss under her hand. She\u2019d already seen how unordinary Wang Dong was. His essence was hidden, and his soul force had been condensed. With just a glance you could tell that his cultivation far surpassed Huo Yuhao\u2019s.However, Tang Ya was surprised when Wang Dong actually nodded at her proposal after a short period of blankness. He quickly said, \u201cSure! I\u2019ve already heard about the miraculousness of the Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons. Sect master Tang, I wish to join the Tang Sect. Please accept me.\u201d\u201cAh? You really want to join the Tang Sect? But our Tang Sect only has three people left.\u201d Tang Ya was extremely shocked. She looked at Wang Dong with a puzzled look.Wang Dong nodded seriously and said, \u201cI wish to join the Tang Sect and learn how to use hidden weapons.\u201dTang Ya\u2019s expression also turned solemn as she said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to think this matter over. I\u2019ll let Huo Yuhao give you my answer later.\u201dDuring the short moment of time that they\u2019d been talking, Bei Bei had walked into the arena from the lounge. Some of the students sitting near the arena had already started to shout out his name as he appeared.\u201cThunderbolt Bei Bei, Thunderbolt Bei Bei\u2026\u201dBei Bei smiled towards the spectating students and waved at them, but his gaze was searching through the viewing platform.Only when Tang Ya stood up and waved at him did Bei Bei see where they were. Because they were separated by a great distance, the trio probably wouldn\u2019t hear anything if he spoke. Thus, he just gestured a few times at Tang Ya.The two had been together for quite a while already, so Tang Ya immediately returned a few gestures to show that she understood what he meant, before sitting back down.\u201cLittle Yuhao, what\u2019s the maximum range of your Spiritual Detection Sharing?\u201d Tang Ya whispered into Huo Yuhao\u2019s ear.Huo Yuhao answered, \u201cIf it\u2019s only in one direction, about fifty metres or so.\u201dEarlier, he\u2019d tested the limit of his Spiritual Detection when it was used in a single direction with Wang Dong. If he released it normally, it had a diameter of thirty metres. This meant that it only a fifteen metre radius. On the other hand, fifty metres was already more than twice his limit. However, it consumed a large amount of Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul force when he directed it like that.Tang Ya immediately raised her right hand and made a few hand gestures towards Bei Bei, who nodded back at her.At this moment, Xu Sanshi also walked into the Soul Dueling Arena. There was a forty-or-so year-old teacher who followed him out.When they reached the Soul Dueling Arena, Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei both had a cold look of concentration on their faces. This wasn\u2019t their first time competing against each other in the Soul Dueling Arena. In the past, they\u2019d both achieved victories over one another, but most of their duels had ended in ties. They\u2019d truly managed to earn a lot of money from this Soul Dueling Competition, thus they naturally couldn\u2019t reveal the fact that they were close friends.The teacher that was acting as the referee walked to the centre of the arena, then said in a low voice, \u201cFourth year student \u2018Bei Bei\u2019 is challenging fifth year student \u2018Xu Sanshi\u2019. If Xu Sanshi loses this match, he will have to pay an additional ten gold soul coins to Bei Bei. You\u2019ve already made your bets in private. Are you two ready?\u201dBei Bei and Xu Sanshi both simultaneously nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi then released their martial souls almost simultaneously.The Soul Dueling Arena that had previously been clamouring instantly became silent, everyone\u2019s attention now focused on the two people in the arena. As influential figures within Shrek Academy\u2019s outer courtyard, every single duel between Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi would shake one to the core. The other students loved it when they fought against each other. Furthermore, there were even many students who privately made bets against one another.Blue lightning gathered around Bei Bei\u2019s body, and his right arm expanded rapidly. As the blue lightning wreathed his body, his martial soul, the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon, was released.On the other side, Xu Sanshi didn\u2019t show any weaknesses at all. His body expanded once again, causing his uniform to stretch outwards. Following that, the massive tortoiseshell shield appeared in his right hand again as well.The two began to slowly walk around the outside of the arena as they stared at one another with piercing gazes. The strong soulforce that was being emitted from the two of them\u2014one blue and one black\u2014increased in strength unceasingly. The differences between the two different types of soulforce could clearly be seen.On the surface, they looked like they looked like they were evenly matched. Both of them were Soul Elder experts that possessed three soul rings, and both of them were battle-type Soul Elders. From their martial souls, Bei Bei was clearly an assault system Soul Elder, while Xu Sanshi\u2014who possessed a shield\u2014was highly likely to be a defense system Soul Elder.One of them had the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon that was known as the martial soul with the highest amount of attack power, while the other had a mutated martial soul that had an enormous level of defense, the Mysterious Underworld Turtle. It was hard to say who would win.Wang Dong seemed to have forgotten about his issue with Huo Yuhao as he silently began to concentrate on the two people in the arena. Huo Yuhao was the same. Their moods had involuntarily fluctuated towards following the two competing Soul Elders.After releasing his martial soul, Bei Bei\u2019s gentle temperament instantly turned sharp. On the other hand, Xu Sanshi\u2019s hot temper seemed to have cooled down, and a mountain-like stability had appeared.When Xu Sanshi reached the area that was closest to Huo Yuhao and the others, Bei Bei suddenly roared, and charged towards Xu Sanshi like a bolt of lightning.Xu Sanshi was slightly startled. He hadn\u2019t exposed any weaknesses, and this wasn\u2019t a great opportunity for Bei Bei either! When did Bei Bei become so impulsive?Although Xu Sanshi thought this in his heart, he didn\u2019t dare to be slow at all. He was extremely clear on the explosive power that Bei Bei could release when he attacked.When Bei Bei was only five or so metres away from Xu Sanshi, he suddenly leapt upwards and sent his right arm, which was covered with thick scales, towards Xu Sanshi\u2019s head. Blue lightning wrapped itself around Bei Bei\u2019s draconic claw, signifying that he could release his soul skill at any time.However, Xu Sanshi remained calm and unhurried. He slightly shifted his right foot back half a step, and slightly crouched down. He placed his shield in front of his body, allowing it to completely protect his body. Meanwhile, pitch-black soulforce surged out from his tortoiseshell shield, faintly forming a black halo of light that both shrouded and protected him.\u201cBoom\u2014\u201d Bei Bei\u2019s draconic claw collided ferociously against the thick black tortoiseshell shield, causing the two of their bodies to simultaneously shake. Bei Bei rapidly halted his attack and fell back, while Xu Sanshi slid backwards.Of Xu Sanshi\u2019s three soul rings, his hundred year soul ring suddenly lit up, causing the black light emitted by his tortoiseshell shield to immediately be doubled. A strong black halo spread out from his shield, covering a full ten or so square metres. It was like an enormous hood that pushed outwards. It even emitted rumbling sounds as it was released.This was Mysterious Underworld Quake, Xu Sanshi\u2019s first soul skill.This was a wide range knockback skill that also had a dizzying effect. If his opponent\u2019s cultivation was inferior to his, they would feel dizzy and be knocked backwards. At the very least, this skill could allow Xu Sanshi to pull some distance from his enemies.However, Xu Sanshi never expected Bei Bei to be so determined.When Xu Sanshi released his first soul skill, both Bei Bei\u2019s second and third soul rings unexpectedly lit up at the same time.The first to activate was his third ring, which was his thousand year one. As its light expanded outwards, a low rumbling sound suddenly exploded from Bei Bei\u2019s body, causing his entire body to emit strong bluish purple lightning. The scales on his right hand spread rapidly towards his body, encapsulating the right side of his chest within them. Following that, the aura surrounding his body instantly rose.This was Thunderous Fury.Following that, his second soul ring flashed, causing many thick electric snakes to instantly burst outwards from Bei Bei\u2019s body.When Bei Bei combined his second and third soul skills, they managed to negate Xu Sanshi\u2019s Mysterious Underworld Quake. Even if Xu Sanshi was widely recognised for his defense, his Mysterious Underworld Quake wasn\u2019t able to knock Bei Bei away.A hole was forcibly torn into the black hood formed by Xu Sanshi\u2019s skill. Bei Bei ignored the assaults of the black streams of air and stubbornly forced his way in.Xu Sanshi was startled, but his movements didn\u2019t slow down in the least. His second and third soul rings also lit up in succession. He was all too familiar with Bei Bei\u2019s power, and was extremely confident in his own defense. Although he didn\u2019t feel 100% certain that he could defeat Bei Bei, Bei Bei absolutely wouldn\u2019t be able to beat him if he concentrated firmly on his defense.However, in the instant that he released his second and third soul skills, he suddenly felt as if his brain had been pierced by a needle. A trace of fuzziness instantly appeared in his consciousness, causing his two soul skills to suddenly turn sluggish for a moment. He\u2019d actually been unable to immediately release them.Bei Bei\u2019s pouncing body suddenly turned illusory. This was the Tang Sect\u2019s Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks. His body crouched slightly downwards, and his entire body seemed to slide along the ground. He used his right claw to hook onto the bottom of the tortoiseshell shield, whilst simultaneously sliding behind it.Even if Xu Sanshi wanted to release his soul skills, it was too late. Letting Bei Bei get around his shield like this had already doomed him to tragedy.Bei Bei used his right foot to stamp directly on Xu Sanshi\u2019s calf, and underneath the strengthening effects of Thunderous Fury, the lightning of Vigorous Thunderbolt instantly surged forth. In the next moment, Xu Sanshi\u2019s body was only able to tremble in its original location. On the other hand, Bei Bei\u2019s enormous draconic arm dug directly into his shoulder. The outcome of the battle had been settled, just like that.The match had ended even faster than most people had expected, so much so that there were many people who simply hadn\u2019t seen what happened. Bei Bei had gone around Xu Sanshi\u2019s tortoiseshell armor\u2019s defense and then subdued his opponent in order to obtain victory.\u201cBei Bei wins.\u201d The referee\u2019s voice rang out, announcing the victor. He didn\u2019t stop Bei Bei from throwing Xu Sanshi to the ground either.Xu Sanshi\u2019s bodily resistance was indeed extremely strong, which was shown by how his trembling immediately stopped when Bei Bei withdrew his lightning. However, his words were still somewhat scattered. \u201cYou, you were cheating.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t know how Bei Bei had cheated, he knew that he definitely wasn\u2019t the reason for his soul skills being slowed down by half a beat earlier. Furthermore, he\u2019d been fully concentrated on his defense. The fact that Bei Bei had actually been able find the weakest spot in his defense in only a single moment was completely outrageous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you want to bet with me, you have to accept your loss. Give me the Mysterious Water Pill you owe me.\u201d Bei Bei smiled as he used his draconic claw to pour a bit of his lighting-type soulforce back into Xu Sanshi\u2019s body, causing Xu Sanshi\u2019s tall body to tremble all over once again.How could Xu Sanshi know that a person in the stands had already fainted solely for the sake of helping Bei Bei beat him?That\u2019s right; the piercing pain that Xu Sanshi had felt in his brain when he\u2019d wanted to activate his second and third soul skills had come from Huo Yuhao\u2019s Purple Demon Eyes and Spirit Shock. Even though Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t that high, the instantaneous attack power generated by the combination of the two skills still made Xu Sanshi, whose body had been completely protected by soulforce, suffer a loss.Huo Yuhao had been roughly thirty metres away from Xu Sanshi, which was perfectly within the range of his Spirit Shock.Not only that, before releasing these two skills, Huo Yuhao had even used his Spiritual Detection and Spiritual Sharing in order to help Bei Bei find a weak point in Xu Sanshi\u2019s defense.It could be said that this short instant was Huo Yuhao\u2019s best performance since becoming a soul master. He\u2019d consecutively used three soul skills, as well as the Purple Demon Eyes, to forcefully direct the outcome of a match between two evenly matched adversaries.The scenes before the match\u2014The few gestures that Bei Bei had made towards Tang Ya had been meant to tell her to ask Huo Yuhao to help out, and the reason that Bei Bei had unleashed his attacks on Xu Sanshi when he hadn\u2019t received any opportunities was because Tang Ya had told him the range of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing.This victory actually belonged to to the combined efforts of both Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao.Other than Tang Ya and Bei Bei, who was in the arena, Wang Dong was the only who\u2019d sensed it. When Huo Yuhao had used his soul skill, although he\u2019d deliberately controlled the soul ring that had appeared below his feet so that it didn\u2019t rise upwards, how could he hide the undulations of soulforce released by it from Wang Dong, who was sitting right next to him?Wang Dong clearly saw a faint-gold colour appear in Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes, which had almost instantaneously turned much more vibrant in the next moment. Finally, a purple light had flashed through them. Right after that, he\u2019d directly tilted towards him, unconscious.As Wang Dong subconsciously held onto Huo Yuhao, the match in the arena had already finished.\u201cHe, what happened to him?\u201d Wang Dong asked with an astonished tone.Tang Ya was also startled when she saw Huo Yuhao collapse. She hurriedly examined Huo Yuhao\u2019s condition, before letting out a sigh of relief. \u201cHe\u2019s simply overdrawn his soulforce, there\u2019s nothing wrong with him. Let\u2019s go.\u201d It was better to leave the crime scene after doing something bad. Furthermore, Tang Ya was inwardly puzzled. How had the effectiveness of Little Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing been so great? Bei Bei\u2019s original intention had just been to use it to let him take the initiative in the fight!Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi\u2019s cultivation level were about the same, so the person who was able to seize a decisive opportunity would have the best chance at victory. However, she never thought that he\u2019d actually win the match in one blow.Huo Yuhao was truly too exhausted. After a full day of physical training, combined with the many times that he\u2019d used his soul skills, the over-exhaustion caused him to fall into a very thorough unconscious state, where he wouldn\u2019t be able to wake up for quite a while. This was also one of his body\u2019s self-defense mechanisms.Tang Ya and Wang Dong carried Huo Yuhao back to his dorm room together. By the time they reached the dorm, Bei Bei had caught up. After using his soulforce to help Huo Yuhao\u2019s body recover, he took out a porcelain bottle and tumped out a medical pill, which he shoved into Huo Yuhao\u2019s mouth.\u201cLittle brother, please take care of him.\u201d Upperclassmen weren\u2019t allowed to enter the dormitories of lowerclassmen; this was a rule set by Shrek Academy. Thus, Bei Bei could only ask Wang Dong to help him out.Wang Dong\u2019s gaze was slightly blank. He came from a prestigious family, so he was knowledgeable about many things. Earlier, he had clearly seen the pill that Bei Bei had taken out.It had been a dark blue pill about the size of a cherry, with many veins of various shades of white on its surface. When he\u2019d taken it out of the porcelain bottle, the pill had even been surrounded by a faint layer of mist. Furthermore, its fresh smell that had lingered in the air was something deeply refreshing to the mind.Was that a Mysterious Water Pill? No way. Wang Dong was gobsmacked.It wasn\u2019t only him. Even the old man who was lazily reclining next to the entrance widened his eyes slightly for a moment before he returned to his original state.Tang Ya asked Wang Dong, \u201cLittle cutie, when little Yuhao wakes up, please remind him to go buy some fish tomorrow. When I get back, I\u2019ll prepare another set of what I gave him earlier today.\u201dBei Bei unhappily retorted, \u201cYou only know how to eat. You almost harmed my little junior brother today.\u201dTang Ya humphed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t give me that. I know that you already had bad intentions towards Xu Sanshi behind his back. That guy\u2019s as dumb as a rock, so sure enough, he was duped by you. You just happened to grab the opportunity.\u201dBei Bei innocently said, \u201cIf someone wants to give me a present, what else can I do but receive it? All I can say is that our little junior brother\u2019s luck is quite good. Let\u2019s go back and cultivate. I remember a certain someone who said that she\u2019d give me a kiss if I were to beat Xu Sanshi. You should keep your promises.\u201dTang Ya stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cI asked you to beat him until he wasn\u2019t even able to take care of himself. Did you do that? If not, go cultivate!\u201dWang Dong suddenly said, \u201cSenior Tang Ya, please consider my question for a while. I really want to join the Tang Sect.\u201dTang Ya nodded her head and waved at him, while Bei Bei revealed a pondering look on his face. Afterwards, he smiled at Wang Dong before pulling Tang Ya away.Wang Dong carried Huo Yuhao back to their dorm room and placed him onto his bed. The image of the pill that Bei Bei had fed to Huo Yuhao was still present in his mind. After softly shaking his head and glaring fiercely at Huo Yuhao, he muttered to himself, \u201cI\u2019m not scared of getting an eye infection after seeing what I wasn\u2019t supposed to see. Sleeping on a hard bed serves you right.\u201d Whilst speaking, he jumped back onto his own bed and started meditating in a cross-legged position. The physical training that he\u2019d undergone today had also been extremely effective.Huo Yuhao\u2019s sleep this time around was especially sound. Ever since he\u2019d entered the Tang Sect, he\u2019d been bitterly cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique. This was the first time since then that he\u2019d been able to sleep peacefully.In his dream, he felt as if he was immersed within a relaxing pool. The ensuing feeling of relaxation caused him to let out a moan.Not long after starting his meditation, Wang Dong opened his eyes once again and looked\u2014astonished\u2014towards Huo Yuhao, who was still lying on his bed. He\u2019d been roused after sensing the strong fluctuations of soulforce in the air.Sure enough, the strong fluctuations of soulforce he\u2019d felt were being emitted from Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. It was already nighttime, so the faint blue light that was coming from Huo Yuhao\u2019s body was especially noticeable in the dark.Wang Dong jumped down from his bed and squatted quietly beside Huo Yuhao\u2019s bed to carefully observe him. He discovered that Huo Yuhao\u2019s skin seemed to be rising and falling slightly. Furthermore, as it rose and fell, a few tiny streams of air were being continuously emitted from his pores. These were the fluctuations of soulforce that he\u2019d sensed. Furthermore, the faint blue mist surged unceasingly into his pores before surging back out and, following the passing of time, the colour of the mist gradually turned slightly darker. At the same time, the refreshing smell in the air gradually weakened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why would senior Bei Bei casually give him such a precious pill?! Don\u2019t tell me that he gave Huo Yuhao the wrong pill?\u201d Wang Dong spoke to himself with a shocked tone.After a brief moment of shock, Wang Dong planned to return to his bed and sleep. However, he suddenly thought of something, and somewhat helplessly walked towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s bed. He then waved his fist around and humphed. \u201cThanks to you, I can\u2019t sleep even when I have a bed. Hmph, just wait.\u201d As he spoke, he rolled up his bedding and put it away in his storage-type soul tool. Afterwards, he quietly left the dorm room. No one knew where he went.Not long after Wang Dong left, the smell emitted by the mist surrounding Huo Yuhao\u2019s body gradually turned from a sweet smell to a fishy smell, and its colour also darkened even more. Following that, Huo Yuhao\u2019s breathing became increasingly calm.This time around, Huo Yuhao\u2019s sleep was truly relaxing and peaceful. The thing that finally woke him up was because of how sticky he felt. Once his consciousness had returned, he couldn\u2019t help but sneeze loudly.\u201cHoly shit, this smell! What\u2019s this smell coming from!?\u201d Huo Yuhao rolled over and sat up. He subconsciously thought that this was Wang Dong doing something crazy to him.However, when he opened his eyes to look at the bed opposite him, he discovered that it was barren. Wang Dong wasn\u2019t in the room.It was still dark outside when he woke up, but Huo Yuhao quickly discovered that something seemed to be off. He could see every single bit of detail within the room\u2014almost as if his eyes weren\u2019t affected by the darkness at all.In the past, although he could\u2019ve achieved this level of vision, it would\u2019ve required the him to both circulate his soulforce and release his Spirit Eyes. But now, he didn\u2019t even need to use his martial soul to reach the same level of vision!When he looked downwards, he discovered that his uniform had actually turned pitch-black; the stinky smell that he\u2019d complained about was coming from his uniform. Moreover, a layer of pitch-black filth had also appeared on his skin where the uniform didn\u2019t cover it. He felt as if he\u2019d been dropped into a pile of sludge before being thrown back onto his bed.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that Wang Dong doesn\u2019t hate me this much\u2026\u201d Huo Yuhao was left somewhat speechless as he looked himself over. When he stood up, he noticed that his wooden bed was covered with a dense layer of black filth.Just what was this?The smell that was present on both his body and the bed were truly too unpleasant, so he didn\u2019t bother to carefully ponder what exactly had happened. He jumped off his bed and rushed to open the dorm room\u2019s windows. Immediately afterwards he ran out of his dorm room, and went directly towards the bathroom located at the end of the corridor.The filth that was covering his body felt greasy. The time that it took for him to clean his bed and wash his clothes, combined with cleaning himself, all-in-all, took about an hour of his time.When he finally sat back down on his bed, Huo Yuhao had a perplexed expression. Whatever, I won\u2019t overthink it. I\u2019ll find out what happened when I ask Wang Dong tomorrow. I\u2019ve slept for most of the night already, which wasted a lot of time I could\u2019ve spent doing other things. I need to hurry up and cultivate.After thinking this to himself, Huo Yuhao sat down in a cross-legged position and began circulating his soulforce throughout his body, following the circulation paths of the Mysterious Heaven Technique as he cultivated.Huo Yuhao had only spent three seconds meditating when he suddenly opened his eyes wide in shock. His Spirit Eyes were wide open, but were filled with an inconceivable look.\u201cAm\u2026 am I dreaming?\u201d Huo Yuhao was somewhat in a daze. After he recovered, he hurriedly shut his eyes once again.When another three seconds had passed, he opened his eyes again, only this time his face was full of excitement.Yes, something that Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t dare to believe had happened. When he\u2019d entered into a meditative state to circulate his soulforce, he felt as if his body was in an unprecedented state. If he was to compare his previous circulation of soulforce to the crawling speed of a snail, then his current speed of circulation was at least as fast as the climbing speed of a spider. His soulforce circulation speed was three to five times faster and, in addition to that, his soulforce had been strengthened by a large amount. When he circulated it now, it felt much less obstructed.As he continued to circulate his soulforce, he felt an unprecedented sense of power spread throughout his body\u2014as if all his meridians had been opened. This sort of feeling was simply too wondrous. He also felt the itchy feeling that normally signified growth in all of his limbs and bones.Huo Yuhao somewhat impatiently shut his eyes and roused his soulforce so that he could circulate it around his passageways. The facts had proven that he wasn\u2019t dreaming; everything was real. Originally, when he was following the circulation paths of the Mysterious Heaven Technique to cultivate, he\u2019d need at least an hour to complete a full revolution. Now however, he didn\u2019t even need to use a quarter of that time to finish a full circulation. Furthermore, the rate at which his soulforce grew was several times greater than before. It was no longer the sort of increase that could be counted with traces; it had evolved into something that could be counted in wisps.At the same time, as he was cultivating, Huo Yuhao discovered that all of his passageways had become unprecedentedly unobstructed. The areas that had been previously been obstructed, along with the areas which had been extremely thin and fragile, had all been widened and thickened by a large amount. Furthermore, his passageways had a faint kind of elasticity to them; even if they were hit with several soulforce attacks, they still wouldn\u2019t be in any danger.Could it be that I\u2019ve shed my mortal body and bones in a single night?He wasn\u2019t even willing to think about what had caused it. He\u2019d never felt such an increase in power in his entire life. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to grasp this sort of feeling, so he wasn\u2019t willing to give it up no matter what. He unceasingly circulated his soulforce throughout his body. As he did so, the circulation speed of the Mysterious Heaven Technique seemed to faintly increase. Furthermore, as the Mysterious Heaven Technique nourished the passageways in his body, that warm and comfortable feeling started to appear again.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t even know how many times he ended up circulating his soulforce, but it was at least until the sky outside gradually brightened. Only when the distant horizon exposed daylight did he wake up from his meditative state.Even after sitting in a cross-legged position for half the night, his legs didn\u2019t feel numb or stiff at all. He moved slightly until he was by the window. As he gazed towards the purple qi that gradually appeared in the east, his soulforce easily went towards his Spirit Eyes in a very natural manner as he started cultivating the Purple Demon Eyes.The change that had occurred in his body, as well as the strengthening of his soulforce, made everything seem different for Huo Yuhao. When Huo Yuhao used his Spirit Eyes to look attentively towards the layer of purple qi that had risen from the east to start cultivating the Purple Demon Eyes, he clearly felt as if something in his brain had been cut apart. His Spirit Eyes faintly generated an invisible attractive force that absorbed the purple qi in the same manner a whale would drink water.The outside of his eyes became warm, while their interior remained cool. Huo Yuhao only felt his spiritual energy spread out in all four directions, quickly exceeding his original limit, reaching a total diameter of forty metres before stopping. The layer of purple within his eyes had also deepened, and even his skin had a bright and smooth luster to it. His three energies\u2014essence, qi, and spiritual energy\u2014were completely different from yesterday.As he let out a long sigh to exhale a mouthful of impurities from his body, Huo Yuhao completed his cultivation of the Purple Demon Eyes. Everything around him became increasingly clear. With a thought, Huo Yuhao withdrew his soulforce, and his Spirit Eyes also returned back to their normal state. Only, his pair of deep blue eyes had become even brighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If not, he might not have had such a huge increase in his cultivation from a full half a year of cultivation.Just as Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart was filling with doubt, the room to the dormitory opened.Wang Dong stuck his head through the door and sniffed the room a few times. After confirming that the room didn\u2019t smell, he slowly walked in whilst hugging his bedding to his body. He threw the bedding onto his bed and spoke unhappily to Huo Yuhao, who was standing there. \u201cYou\u2019re really a good one. You\u2019ve \u2018shed your mortal body and bones\u2019, but you made me unable to return home. Hmph. You\u2019re treating me to breakfast today.\u201dHuo Yuhao looked at Wang Dong with a puzzled expression. \u201cWang Dong, just what happened to me? Why was I covered with filth when I woke up? My cultivation has even risen by a large amount. It even feels like I\u2019ve done what you just said; I have a sort of \u2018shedding my mortal body and bones\u2019 feeling.\u201dA simple-looking golden bracelet on Wang Dong\u2019s wrist flashed, causing a round metallic ball to appear in his hand, which he then threw towards Huo Yuhao.\u201cLet\u2019s see how much your soulforce has increased by. This soul tool of mine can test the soulforce of people from the tenth to the thirtieth rank. Just pour your soulforce into it.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Huo Yuhao replied. Gripping the metal ball, he slowly poured his soulforceinto it.The golden ball started to emit a faint layer of yellow light that gradually began to extend outwards. Next, a number appeared on the surface of the metal ball. At first, it was fixed at eleven, but it rapidly jumped up to twelve. As the yellow light continued to extend outwards, the \u2018twelve\u2019 also started to gradually tremble. However, Huo Yuhao was already using all of his strength at the moment; he wasn\u2019t able to stimulate the number anymore.Wang Dong\u2019s expression had changed into one of astonishment. \u201cIt really is worthy of being called the Mysterious Water Pill! It\u2019s actually increased your soulforce by almost two ranks in a single night. You\u2019re at the peak of the twelfth rank now, only a step away from the thirteenth rank.\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cAre you telling the truth? What is this \u2018Mysterious Water Pill\u2019?\u201dWang Dong snatched the testing soul tool back from Huo Yuhao and humphed. Then, he said, \u201cMy soul tool is extremely accurate when testing people\u2019s soul ranks. Besides, I don\u2019t benefit from lying to you. Speaking of which, you should thank senior Bei Bei. What sort of relationship do you have with him? He actually just casually slipped you a Mysterious Water Pill that\u2019s worth ten thousand gold when you were unconscious. I\u2019m very skeptical as whether or not he gave you the right pill.\u201dWhen he saw Huo Yuhao\u2019s puzzled face, Wang Dong went ahead and explained, \u201cThe Mysterious Water Pill is an extremely mystical pill. Supposedly, it\u2019s a pill that\u2019s specific to a certain water-type sect. However, I don\u2019t know which exact sect that is. When the Mysterious Water Pill is being refined, you need to use the blood essence of ten or so water-type soul beasts, as well as several tens of water-type plants. Afterwards, you\u2019ll also need to mix them in a specific manner before being able to successfully refine it. Water has a cleansing property, so not only can the Mysterious Water Pill greatly heal you, it can also increase your soulforce by a margin. Furthermore, its medicinal properties are extremely gentle, so a soul master of any rank is capable of absorbing its medicinal efficacy extremely well. As for soul masters below the twentieth rank, it can increase their soulforce by a rank at least. However, its most valuable aspect isn\u2019t this; it\u2019s the fact that it can cleanse your muscles as well as your bone marrow.\u201d\u201cWhen we shower normally, we cleanse the filth off the surface of our bodies. On the other hand, the Mysterious Water Pill cleanses the impurities hidden within our bodies. This Mysterious Water Pill is effective for anyone who takes it. To an extremely talented soul master, it might only be akin to adding flowers to a brocade. However, to a soul master with ordinary talent, it\u2019s basically sending them coal during a blizzard. It can expel the impurities within their bodies, as well as nourish their meridians. The increase in potential for an ordinary soul master caused by the Mysterious Water Pill is equivalent to an increase in his innate soulforce by an entire rank. In other words, if your innate soulforce when your martial soul was awakened was only at the first rank, it\u2019ll turn into the second rank after you\u2019ve taken a single Mysterious Water Pill. This is nothing short of a qualitative growth in one\u2019s talent and physique.\u201dWhat Wang Dong didn\u2019t know was that his analogy had actually struck the truth. Huo Yuhao\u2019s innate soulforce was actually the first rank!However, Huo Yuhao clearly sensed that the feeling of \u2018shedding one\u2019s bones\u2019 he\u2019d felt after taking the Mysterious Water Pill definitely wasn\u2019t just as simple as a mere one rank increase in his innate soulforce. In fact, his cultivation speed had almost quadrupled! Although he wasn\u2019t comparable to the likes of Wang Dong and Bei Bei, who were genius soul masters, he\u2019d become equivalent to an ordinary soul master at least. Cultivation wouldn\u2019t be as difficult as it had been in the past for him anymore.\u201cEldest senior brother\u2026.\u201dHuo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but want to shed a few tears. It was his eldest senior brother who\u2019d given him the Mysterious Water Pill, something that was worth ten thousand gold! This friendship given to him by Bei Bei was deeply engraved into his heart.Huo Yuhao\u2019s luck was truly good. Wang Dong\u2019s explanation of the Mysterious Water Pill wasn\u2019t incorrect at all. Under normal circumstances, the increase provided by the Mysterious Water Pill would be just as he\u2019d described.However, Huo Yuhao had taken the Mysterious Water Pill at the perfect moment. After yesterday\u2019s bitter training, his body had received enough tempering that it broke through its limits. He\u2019d essentially completed a thorough \u2018warm up\u2019 before he consumed the Mysterious Water Pill. Furthermore, his comprehension towards the Mysterious Heaven Technique had caused the technique to permeate throughout his passageways, allowing it to reside in a sort of warm, nourishing state.The overuse of Huo Yuhao\u2019s consciousness had caused him to sink into a comatose state. Due to this, when he absorbed the Mysterious Water Pill, he hadn\u2019t been able to deliberately control the efficacy of the Mysterious Water Pill, allowing it to evenly spread throughout his body. The nourishing effect brought about by the Mysterious Water Pill was completely received by his body.There was another important point. The Mysterious Water Pill was a water-type medicinal pill, while his second martial soul that had been bestowed to him by the Skydream Iceworm was an ice-type one. Ice was, in and of itself, another state of water, which caused his absorption of the Mysterious Water Pill to be even more fruitful.In addition, following the Mysterious Water Pill\u2019s reconstruction of his body, one of the ten balls of Origin Energy that the Skydream Iceworm had sealed within his body had finally been cracked open by a small amount. A portion of the energy that had spilled out from it had thus fused with his body. Because of this, the increase in his spiritual energy was actually even larger than the increase in his soulforce. This was also the reason why his spiritual awareness had expanded from thirty metres to forty metres.The Mysterious Water Pill could be said to have caused an all-around upgrade to Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, which was the reason why he\u2019d experienced such a huge change. This would have enormous benefits towards his future cultivation, and even his Purple Demon Eyes had evolved.The Purple Demon Eyes had four major realms\u2014Surveyance, Totality, Mustard Seed, and Boundlessness. When Huo Yuhao used his Spirit Eyes to cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes, he basically achieved twice the effects while putting in half the work. As the Mysterious Water Pill had increased his soulforce, it had also simultaneously spurred on the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s Origin Energy. Thus, when he\u2019d previously cultivated the Purple Demon Eyes, the Origin Energy had created a siphoning effect towards the purple qi on the horizon, thereby allowing Huo Yuhao\u2019s Purple Demon Eyes to directly leap into the Totality realm from the Perlustration realm. In terms of cultivation speed for the Purple Demon Eyes, he could even be said to be the fastest person in all of history. He\u2019d even exceeded the founder of the Tang Sect, Tang San.Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t know this yet, but the advancement of his Purple Demon Eyes had caused a large increase in his ability to control spiritual-type skills. When he activated soul skills in the future, his soulforce consumption would be substantially lessened.As he looked at Huo Yuhao\u2019s red eyes and slightly blank appearance, Wang Dong patted him on the shoulder and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and get some breakfast. I want to eat double today!\u201dHuo Yuhao laughed. \u201cSure. You can even eat quadruple if you want today.\u201dWang Dong eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re the pig here.\u201d Once he spoke, the two couldn\u2019t help but break into laughter. Their embarrassment from last night had disappeared. At such a simple age, the two still had pure hearts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong arrived at the dining hall, they secretly felt a little rich and imposing.The breakfast that they had was especially sumptuous, and greatly replenished their bodies\u2019 needs. They were the earliest to arrive at the dining hall, and even by the time they\u2019d finished eating, not many students had arrived.\u201cThere\u2019s still a while till we have to be in class. Let\u2019s return to the dorm room.\u201d Huo Yuhao patted his satisfied belly and stretched his body for a while with a content look on his face.Ever since he arrived at Shrek Academy, he\u2019d gradually become cheerful. He finally had friends here, but even more so, he had Teacher Xiao Ya and his Eldest Senior Brother Bei Bei who both cared about him. This was worlds better compared to the previous kind of atmosphere he\u2019d experienced when he was in the Duke\u2019s mansion, where everything was ice-cold.Wang Dong replied, \u201cSave it. You\u2019re just gonna go back and cultivate again anyway. Bowstrings that have been stretched too tightly will break, you know. If you need to relax, then you should just relax. Let\u2019s take a walk by Sea God Lake and relax for a while. The Mysterious Water Pill just helped you increase your cultivation by quite a bit; you shouldn\u2019t care about this short moment of relaxation.\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201d Huo Yuhao happily agreed. Every since entering the academy a few days ago, he still had yet to visit Sea God Lake. Moreover, it really was almost time for them to head to class. It would be a good idea if he took the chance to take a walk too.The two left the dining hall and cut through the school building for new students as they headed to the east along the south side of Shrek Plaza. Soon afterwards, they arrived at the alley to the lakeside.As they passed through the forest next to the alley, Sea God Lake, with its gleaming waves that were reflected in the sunlight, and its water that was both clear and crystalline, was presented before their eyes.A gust of wind that contained a gentle mist mixed with fresh air buffeted them. Even though Sea God Lake was a man-made lake, the water that it held was extremely clear. The azure lake was blue to the point that its surface was both pure and deep, yet so blue that it was also tender, calm, and graceful. A slight ripple that looked like the luminous eyes of a young lady was also full of life that undulated on the surface of the lake and looked like a blue brocade.The lake reflected an inverted image of the blue sky and white clouds, as well as the trees that lined the lakeside.\u201cSo beautiful!\u201d Wang Dong couldn\u2019t help but inhale deeply, physically exerting himself as he stretched his body.When he stretched his body, his shirt was inevitably pulled up, revealing his perfectly rounded and perky butt. Huo Yuhao absolutely didn\u2019t deliberately focus his attention on it, but an unintentional look was enough to remind him of the shining patch of white that he\u2019d seen yesterday\u2026He turned his head away, feeling somewhat embarrassed, and looked far out into the distance across Sea God Lake. Sea God Lake occupied an extremely wide area; perhaps it was even larger than the main Shrek Academy campus that was to the west of Shrek Plaza. There was even a layer of fog atop the water\u2019s surface in the distance.After Huo Yuhao\u2019s Purple Demon Eyes had evolved, the sight of his Spirit Eyes had substantially increased once again. Even though he hadn\u2019t poured soul power into his Spirit Eyes to activate them, Huo Yuhao could still see far into the distance. He faintly saw what seemed to be houses amidst the mist that rested upon the surface of the lake in the distance. He couldn\u2019t help but think that the inner courtyard was probably at that end of the lake, as he\u2019d associated those houses with Xiao Ya and Bei Bei\u2019s description.If such an outstanding Soul Master like his eldest senior brother was only able to study in the outer courtyard, then how strong would the upperclassmen from the inner courtyard be!?\u201cEh?\u201d At the exact moment that Huo Yuhao was preoccupied with his thoughts, he suddenly saw what appeared to be a red dot appear in the mist above the lake.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wang Dong asked curiously.Huo Yuhao pointed in the direction that he was looking. \u201cLook, there seems to be some sort of red dot over there.\u201dWang Dong followed where Huo Yuhao\u2019s finger was pointing, and looked in the direction that he was pointing. However, all he saw was a sea of mist. \u201cWhere?\u201d He was questioning Huo Yuhao\u2019s words one moment, when in the next moment, he opened his eyes wide and stared. He\u2019d also seen the so-called red dot that Huo Yuhao had mentioned. However, it wasn\u2019t some red dot. It was clearly a red-coloured figure that was currently running on the surface of the water at an astonishing speed. In addition to that, looking closely at the figure, it actually seemed to be rushing in their direction!Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong both exchanged a glance before simultaneously crying out in surprise, \u201cAn upperclassman from the inner courtyard?!\u201dThe red figure\u2019s speed was extremely shocking. In just a short period of time, it had already reached the center of the lake. Every time the tips of his toes briefly touched the surface of the lake, he\u2019d create a ripple that spread out across the lake. However, he was also continuously speeding up with the help of that slight buoyancy from the lake, rapidly flying forwards like a red cloud.As the figure got closer, Huo Yuhao was also able to see it even better. The red colour wasn\u2019t only due to the fact that the clothes on its body were red in colour, but even its hair was a blood-red colour. The figure was slender, yet was emitting a sort of biting fierceness from its whole body, just like a frightening soul beast. The figure was wearing a mask that was also similarly red in colour; even its eyes were blood-red.The air surrounding its body seemed to be distorting slightly. The mist would even somewhat dissipate beneath his feet wherever he passed.\u201cThis senior seems to be very strong! Look, he can even run on the surface of the water without releasing his Martial Soul.\u201d Wang Dong said to Huo Yuhao with an excited look on his face, as per his analysis of the situation.Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t as good as his, but his perception was far more acute. \u201cWang Dong, why do I feel that something isn\u2019t right!?\u201dThe red figure was truly too fast. In the period that they\u2019d been conversing with each other, the figure had already approached the hundred-metre radius of the shore. A frightening surge of heat engulfed them in that instant. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had astonished looks enter their eyes at the same time, because they simultaneously felt that an indescribably wild aura had exploded from that senior\u2019s body. It definitely wasn\u2019t an aura that should appear from a normal person.With a swish, azure wings had spread out from Wang Dong\u2019s back. He grabbed ahold of Huo Yuhao in an attempt to take flight. However, that red figure had already gotten close to them in the short span of Wang Dong\u2019s movements.The terrifying heat burst forth in an instant, causing both Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao to feel as though they\u2019d been enveloped by a sea of fire. The wings on Wang Dong\u2019s back crumpled in an instant, making it so that he could no longer fly. The duo fell to the ground at the same time. All of the vegetation in an area ten metres around the figure had turned burnt-yellow in an instant.The difference in their cultivations was really too great. Wang Dong still wanted to try to release his soul skill, but just as he activated his soulforce, he immediately sustained an attack from that terrifying heat. With a dull groan, he immediately lost consciousness.Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation was inferior to Wang Dong\u2019s, but one mustn\u2019t forget that he still had an ice-type martial soul that had yet to take form.Once Huo Yuhao was subjected to the intense stimulation from the external heat, his ice-attribute martial soul was immediately awakened. However, his soulforce that was only at the peak of the twelfth rank was thoroughly consumed by the external heat in just a single second. Moreover, that red figure had already swatted a large hand in his direction.The temperature of his surroundings was already so frightening. If he really was hit, wouldn\u2019t he die very tragically?The last thing that Huo Yuhao could do was launch a Spirit Shock. However, the disparity between him and his opponent was too great. His Spirit Shock dissipated in the heat before it could even charge through that layer of strong fire-attribute aura. At this rate, he was going to vanish in a puff of smoke and ashes under that huge, scorching-hot palm.It was at this exact moment that the sight before Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes became a field of white, and everything in his surroundings became a blur.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Am I going to die like this? In this moment, when death was approaching, the feeling that he had in his heart wasn\u2019t unwillingness. Everything that had happened had really been too sudden. Hence, he was only at a loss at the moment.The scene before his eyes suddenly became clear. Huo Yuhao saw a strange scene: He saw himself\u2026If Wang Dong were still awake now right, he\u2019d have seen an incomparably shocking scene.In the moment that Huo Yuhao was about to be engulfed by that flaming hand, the colour of his eyes suddenly changed. His dark blue eyes\u2014which had been twinkling with a faint golden light\u2014suddenly became as white as twinkling frost in an instant.A gust of extraordinarily cold air suddenly spread outwards from Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. He actually managed to forcibly disperse all of the heat coming from the figure in front of him. The fiery figure only let out a dull groan before curling up as they collapsed to the ground.When Huo Yuhao was utilising his Spirit Eyes, the soul ring that rose up from beneath his feet was white. However, at this moment, his normally white soul ring had actually turned an incomparably brilliant golden colour. A glaring golden light sparkled off of it, just like the morning sun was rising up from beneath his feet.With Huo Yuhao\u2019s body as the core, the area around him\u2014and a hundred metre diameter of him\u2014instantly turned into a world of ice and snow. Even his opponent\u2019s spiritual sea was frozen.The red figure seemed to be shivering violently, as the terrifying intimidating aura it let off was continuously condensed by the cold. Huo Yuhao slowly raised his right arm. It wasn\u2019t known when his right hand\u2019s index finger had turned ice-blue, nor when his eyes had begun to shine with a white light. A gloomy voice immediately rang out.\u201cYou dare to touch the person that this Brother has chosen, and dare to disturb this Brother\u2019s sleep! Go and die!\u201dHuo Yuhao pointed forwards with his index finger, causing an icy-blue ray of light to suddenly flash in the sky, headed straight for the red figure.The temperature surrounding the red figure plummeted as a result of the extremely chilling feeling Huo Yuhao was emitting. Perhaps because it felt danger approaching it, the red figure struggled violently. Closely following that, the loud and clear cry of a phoenix abruptly rang out.An enormous phoenix floated up from beneath the figure, along with six soul rings\u2014two yellow, two purple and two black. Soul Emperor rank!Among the six soul rings, the second, third, and sixth soul rings all shone at the same time. The flame behind the figure turned dark red almost instantly. A thread of fire that was as thin as a finger was spouted from the phoenix\u2019s mouth, colliding with the ice-blue light that had been shot out of Huo Yuhao\u2019s index finger.\u201cChi chi\u2014\u2014\u201d A series of strange sounds rang out. The thread of fire collapsed almost instantly. The enormous phoenix abruptly pounced forwards, using its huge body to shield the red figure from the front.The fiery red figure rolled back along with the violent cry of the fire phoenix and, with an icy-blue layer covering them from head to toe, they immediately dropped straight into Sea God Lake in the distance.Huo Yuhao was just about to pursue and attack them, but halted his steps for a moment. The sound that had previously rung out rang once more. \u201cHow annoying, someone else came. Huh, this small guy\u2019s physical fitness has improved very quickly! It seems that I can give him a bit more power already. Alright, I\u2019m fleeing.\u201dThe golden soul ring rapidly dulled back to a white soul ring and disappeared. All of the coldness in Huo Yuhao\u2019s surroundings also disappeared seemingly instantly. The water in the lake rapidly reverted back to its original state. Huo Yuhao\u2019s white eyes that had been emitting a strong chill reverted back to normal. Finally, his body went limp, causing him to fall to the ground in exhaustion.Sea God Lake had just had frightening soulforce fluctuations a moment ago, but tranquility had already been completely restored. Only Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were left, collapsed and unconscious by the shore.In the distance, more than ten silhouettes were headed straight for them from the depths of Sea God Lake at an astonishing speed. It only took a couple seconds for them to arrive at the shore.\u201cThis is bad. Students from the outer courtyard were injured.\u201d A white-clothed old man was the one leading the group. He suddenly strode over in mid-air and, as if he\u2019d just teleported through space, arrived at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong\u2019s side. He extended both his hands, and both of their bodies immediately floated upwards.\u201cFortunately, it seems that they\u2019ve only fainted. They haven\u2019t sustained any injuries. Teacher Li, please provide them with some medical treatment.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Another white-clothed middle-aged person hastily stepped forwards, taking charge of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. If Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were still conscious, they would\u2019ve immediately recognised this Teacher Li aas the Soul Sage-ranked master who\u2019d utilised his martial soul\u2014The Tree of Life\u2014on them yesterday, and had conducted a full-scale recovery on the entire class.His soul rings quickly rose up, and hoops of green light revolved around Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong\u2019s bodies, quietly infiltrating their bodies. A miraculous scene appeared: The wilted plants in their surroundings had actually started to rapidly recover at an astonishing speed. One could also faintly see that the large-scale vegetation that surrounded the Sea God Lake was emitting faint green rays of light. These faint green rays of light were surging towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong\u2019s bodies, slowly soaking into them.\u201cXiao Tao is over here.\u201dThe crashing sound of water rang out, and a white-clothed person fished out the figure clad in red who\u2019d previously fallen into Sea God Lake.The person clad in red was already drenched from head to toe, revealing a lithe and graceful figure. Looking at the figure\u2019s appearance, the person actually seemed to be a woman.The white-clothed old man went around to her side. He pressed her right hand to his shoulder and could see that rich white soulforce was surging into the woman\u2019s body at an astonishing speed.\u201cStrange!\u201d The white-clothed old man furrowed his brow, as if there was something that he couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cTeacher Li, what\u2019s the situation with these two students from the outer courtyard?\u201d He turned his head and asked the teacher who was currently treating Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.The person known as Teacher Li said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious. They\u2019ll be waking up very soon.\u201dThe white-clothed old man heaved a sigh of relief and said, \u201cThank goodness we didn\u2019t make a serious mistake. It seems that Xiao Tao still managed to retain some of her consciousness. Teacher Li, send these two students back and repeatedly warn them to forget what they saw. If they divulge this matter to others, they\u2019ll be expelled. Give them a high grade as compensation. We\u2019re heading back.\u201dThe last three words were directed towards the others. He carried the woman clad in red, and as his silhouette flickered, he turned into a ray of white light as he headed towards the depths of Sea God Lake.In the moment that Huo Yuhao fainted and fell to the ground, he was no longer able to see anything on the outside with his consciousness. Naturally, he also didn\u2019t know what happened after he fainted either.\u201cYou managed to disturb Elder Brother\u2019s sleep so quickly! How annoying!\u201d The Skydream Iceworm\u2019s voice resounded in Huo Yuhao\u2019s spiritual sea.Huo Yuhao dazedly asked, \u201cBrother Skydream, you were the one who made that move just now?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm replied, \u201cOf course it was this brother who did it! If not, you would\u2019ve already become a dried up, baked person! That person\u2019s fire attribute is truly very strong; she actually possesses the blood of a Phoenix Godbeast! If not, this Brother\u2019s finger would\u2019ve annihilated her. But, no matter. She should\u2019ve lost consciousness already. That flame of hers seems to be slightly demonic. However, this Brother didn\u2019t eat all that ten thousand year Ice Pith for nothing. Her powers are still far from comparable to mine. Little Yuhao, your cultivation has been very successful. Your physical fitness has increased significantly. The first seal of the ten seals that I left in your body has already been cracked open.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ever since he\u2019d come to Shrek Academy, he\u2019d started to understand how insignificant he was. After meeting so many experts, his thirst for strength had grown even greater. However, due to his poor talent, he could only secretly work even harder. Now, even the Skydream Iceworm had praised him, so how could he not be happy?The Skydream Iceworm spoke with a very depressed tone. \u201cHowever, this Brother has used some of his Origin Energy. This is my Origin Consciousness, which can also be considered the intelligence that\u2019s been added onto your soul ring. It\u2019s because of this that I was able to protect your body before using my power. Furthermore, after that attack, your body won\u2019t be able to be possessed by me for at least a year. You\u2019ll have to be extremely careful. If you meet another undefeatable enemy like this one, we\u2019re both finished. Okay, I won\u2019t tarry on any longer. I\u2019m going to keep sleeping. You have to quickly work harder. Once you\u2019ve gotten a second soul ring, you won\u2019t have to constantly bother this Brother anymore.\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm was always rushed whenever he appeared. Huo Yuhao had originally planned to ask him a few questions regarding the control of his soul skills, but the Skydream Iceworm already fallen back into a deep sleep, and everything surrounding him had turned dark.\u2026\u2026Wang Dong was the first one to wake up. When he opened his eyes, he saw a white-clothed middle-aged man in front of him. However, before he could speak, Huo Yuhao, who was to his side, let out a muffled groan and slowly opened his eyes.Because he wasn\u2019t as clear as Huo Yuhao regarding the general situation, Wang Dong\u2019s mind was blank. He angrily said, \u201cJust what\u2019s going on? What was that monster earlier?\u201dThe white-clothed middle-aged man indifferently replied, \u201cYou\u2019re both fine now. About the thing that you guys just saw, please forget about it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be expelled from the academy. I\u2019ll give you two these as compensation. I believe that you\u2019re both smart people.\u201d As he spoke, he threw two green objects towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.The two subconsciously raised their hands to catch them. At the same time, the white-clothed middle-aged man had already risen up into the sky, and was flying towards Sea God Lake. \u201cGo to class. Remember, it\u2019s best that you forget everything you just saw.\u201dHuo Yuhao and Wang Dong looked at each other. They were left in a daze for quite a while.\u201cHuo Yuhao, what do you think\u2019s going on?\u201d Wang Dong asked him in a low voice.Huo Yuhao shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It seems like we\u2019ve come across a madman.\u201dWang Dong lowered his head to see what the green object in his hand was, and immediately became stunned. Following that, his face became filled with a happy expression. \u201cWah, we\u2019ve struck gold! It\u2019s a Soul Advancement Pill! It\u2019s actually a Soul Advancement Pill.\u201dHuo Yuhao looked towards the green lump in his hand with puzzlement. It was a green pill that was about the size of a walnut, and it was releasing a faint fragrant odor. Its surface was dark-green in colour, and there seemed to be a faint halo of light circulating within it. It was sparkling and translucent, and was also filled with an aura of life.\u201cWhat\u2019s a Soul Advancement Pill? Is it a type of pill, like the Mysterious Water Pill?\u201dWang Dong replied, \u201cYeah! Furthermore, it\u2019s a pill that\u2019s of the same rank as the Mysterious Water Pill! However, the Mysterious Water Pill is a bit more precious than the Soul Advancement Pill because it has a cleansing effect on one\u2019s muscles and marrow. But, to soul masters above the thirtieth rank, whose muscles and marrow have already been thoroughly cleansed, the Soul Advancement Pill is better than the Mysterious Water Pill. Due to this, the price of the two pills are about the same. You have to take care of it. It\u2019s supposedly extremely hard to refine this sort of pill. I didn\u2019t expect that teacher to give us something so extraordinary as hush money. I\u2019ve decided to forget everything that I saw earlier.\u201dHuo Yuhao asked impatiently, \u201cCan you speak more clearly? Just what use does this Soul Advancement Pill have?\u201dWang Dong let out a cunning laugh and replied, \u201cI\u2019m not telling! Beg me!\u201d After he finished his sentence, he turned around and ran towards the freshmen\u2019s school building.Huo Yuhao was left speechless. After carefully putting the Soul Advancement Pill into his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, he chased after Wang Dong. While running, he shouted, \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll just ask my eldest senior brother. He definitely knows what it does. If you tell me now, I\u2019ll treat you to lunch.\u201dWang Dong slowed down and waited for him to catch up. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll be eating something tasty.\u201dHuo Yuhao took out all of his savings and said, \u201cI\u2019m a homeless orphan anyway. These are all of my savings, do whatever you want with them.\u201dWang Dong was stunned for a moment. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re an orphan?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head.Wang Dong spoke again, \u201cThe reason that you don\u2019t even have any bedding on your bed, isn\u2019t it because you just want to assiduously cultivate? Isn\u2019t it because you\u2019re simply not willing to spend money on some bedding?\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cIt\u2019s because I feel that having some money left to eat with is more important than buying bedding. The food in the canteen is rather expensive after all.\u201dWang Dong unwittingly stopped, causing Huo Yuhao to naturally stop along with him. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing? It\u2019s almost time for class. We need to hurry up.\u201dWang Dong pursed his lips tightly and stared at Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao, who was currently being stared at, felt goosebumps rise on his back. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you? Was your brain fried by that guy earlier?\u201dWang Dong inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly. \u201cHuo Yuhao, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know that you were an orphan. I shouldn\u2019t have bullied you.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled and replied, \u201cYour bullying didn\u2019t work, did it?\u201dWang Dong somewhat resentfully slapped his shoulder. \u201cCan you not interrupt me when I\u2019m in the middle of feeling moved? Let\u2019s hurry to class. I\u2019ll pay for your meals from now on.\u201dHuo Yuhao shook his head and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to. Teacher Xiao Ya found a way for me to make some money. From now on, I\u2019ll be selling roasted fish everyday after school. That\u2019ll be enough for me to get my living expenses. I\u2019ll treat you to some roasted fish later tonight.\u201dAs he spoke, the two walked towards the freshmen\u2019s school building. As they walked, Wang Dong explained the use of the Soul Advancement Pill to him.The main use of the Soul Advancement Pill was to increase one\u2019s soulforce; it was refined from a few heavenly treasures. Soul master could only use a single Soul Advancement Pill during their entire lifetime, and the increase in soulforce one would receive from the pill was roughly equivalent to the soulforce that a soul master at the thirtieth rank needed to advance to the thirty-first rank. This was a pill that could raise one\u2019s soulforce by an entire rank! This was truly something that was hard to come by. However, one\u2019s future cultivation potential would be affected if more than one were taken.Furthermore, the Soul Advancement Pill and the Mysterious Water Pill were somewhat similar, as their main function was to stimulate a person\u2019s potential to provide more nourishment to the body. Because of this, their medicinal properties were relatively gentle; soul masters that were only above the tenth rank could consume them.\u201cThen, how large would the increase in my soulforce be if I were to eat it now?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked probingly.Wang Dong shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone willing to eat it at the twelfth rank. No matter how highly ranked an auction is, this pill is always considered a good thing. Moreover, very few people will choose to sell it. Supposedly, only an extremely small number of plant-type soul masters can refine it, and a year\u2019s supply won\u2019t exceed twenty. This time, we really had some crappy luck. It seems that the school is fair, as even though that fellow threatened our lives, we still got something this good.\u201dUnlike Wang Dong, who was praising the school for giving them the pill, Huo Yuhao\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t too happy. This was because he clearly knew how he and Wang Dong would\u2019ve been charcoal right now, were it not for the existence of the Skydream Iceworm. Even if they were to receive a pill then, it wouldn\u2019t be of any use to them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can\u2019t just put a good thing like this away. Furthermore, it\u2019s best to increase your cultivation earlier, so that you can reach rank thirty earlier. If I\u2019d had a third soul ring today, I wouldn\u2019t have been so passive, at the very least. There wouldn\u2019t have been any problems with me flying into the air with you either.\u201dHuo Yuhao thought about it for a while, before deciding to eat the Soul Advancement Pill once he got back home tonight. The stronger the soulforce he supplied his Mysterious Heaven Skill with, the stronger its nourishing effect would be on his passageways. Hence, increasing his soulforce was naturally a good thing for him. However, he didn\u2019t know how great an increase in soulforce the Soul Advancement Pill would provide. The soulforce needed for one to advance to the thirty-first rank from the thirtieth rank could increase his soulforce by two, or even three ranks at the very minimum. If that was the case, his cultivation would end up around the the fifteenth rank, which meant that it\u2019d be in accordance with the minimum cultivation level normally needed to enter Shrek Academy.When his train of thought reached this point, Huo Yuhao immediately felt a wave of passion surge through his heart. Even though he didn\u2019t feel inferior his classmates, he was still filled with a sense of danger. With his original level of talent, the first round of assessments for freshmen would\u2019ve been extremely hard for him to pass. However, his large increase in cultivation during the past two days had given him some hope. No matter what, he had to stay in Shrek Academy.Compared to Zhou Yi\u2019s class yesterday, today\u2019s classes were\u2014at least to the students\u2014simply too relaxed. Both their morning and afternoon classes were on theory. The morning class was about the classification of martial souls, while the afternoon class was about distinguishing a soul beast\u2019s age.Since most of the students were familiar with what was being covered in the two classes already, they didn\u2019t pay them much attention. However, Huo Yuhao was different; he listened to the teacher with rapt attention. What he lacked wasn\u2019t just talent and cultivation, but knowledge too.Sure enough, Wang Dong treated him to a good meal for lunch. Once he\u2019d finished his afternoon class, Tang Ya came over to him.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Little Yuhao. I\u2019ve prepared everything for you once again. Don\u2019t worry, Teacher Xiao Ya will stay by your side and protect you today. Let\u2019s see what idiot dares to bully you with me around. Right, your eldest senior brother asked me to give this to you when I saw you. Eat it when you get back to your dorm room tonight.\u201dWhilst speaking, Tang Ya handed a porcelain bottle to Huo Yuhao.The onlooking Wang Dong\u2019s eyes immediately widened when he saw this. He\u2019d seen this same porcelain bottle yesterday! It was the same one that Bei Bei had taken a Mysterious Water Pill out of to feed Huo Yuhao before. It was the exact same one!This\u2026 was this a second Mysterious Water Pill?! The Mysterious Water Pill was different from the Soul Advancement Pill; it didn\u2019t have any restrictions on how many times it could be used. However, the first pill\u2019s effects would be the best, while those of any pills taken afterwards would progressively decline. After all, there was still a limit to the impurities each person had within their bodies. The increase in soulforce wouldn\u2019t be as great as a Soul Advancement Pill either.\u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, have you thought about my issue?\u201d Wang Dong asked Tang Ya, a fervent expression on his face.Tang Ya giggled and replied, \u201cI talked to Bei Bei about it. Bei Bei said that, if you\u2019re able to obtain first place in the first freshmen assessment, you\u2019ll be qualified to join our Tang Sect.\u201d\u201cFine, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d Wang Dong replied without any hesitation at all. The benefits for joining the Tang Sect were simply too good! Huo Yuhao had just received two Mysterious Water Pills in front of him! Although he knew that his talent was exceptional, and that he didn\u2019t have any use for the Mysterious Water Pill, who knew whether or not the Tang Sect had better things? However, the reason that he wanted to join the Tang Sect wasn\u2019t due to its benefits.Huo Yuhao accepted the porcelain bottle and put it into his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges without asking any questions. Afterwards, he followed Tang Ya out of the academy.Wang Dong hurriedly caught up to them and said, \u201cI\u2019m going too! Huo Yuhao, no matter how you look at it, we\u2019re roommates. I\u2019ll buy two of your roasted fish to help your business out a bit.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll treat you.\u201dWang Dong shook his head and said, \u201cHow can I do that? Friends are friends, business is business. I don\u2019t need you to treat me, I can afford to buy them.\u201d As he spoke, he fished out a silver soul coin and forcefully shoved it into Huo Yuhao\u2019s hand.He originally thought that he was helping Huo Yuhao, but when the three of them walked through the academy\u2019s gates, Wang Dong realised that he\u2019d actually taken advantage of Huo Yuhao.There were more than thirty people waiting outside for Huo Yuhao to roast fish, of the most eye-catching person of them being Xu Sanshi, who\u2019d lost to Bei Bei yesterday in the Soul Duelling Competition.Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment when he saw Xu Sanshi. However, Tang Ya immediately stepped forward bravely. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re not able to accept your loss? How about I follow you to the Soul Duelling Area today?\u201dXu Sanshi unhappily replied, \u201cYou? Save it. I don\u2019t hit women. Stop trying to stir up trouble with me. I\u2019m here today to buy some roasted fish, not to cause trouble. Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m first in the queue?\u201dWhen she heard what he had to say, Tang Ya\u2019s expression finally relaxed. She asked, \u201cYou\u2019re buying it for Jiang Nannan?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d Xu Sanshi nodded his head.Tang Ya teasingly said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell that you were still so infatuated with her. What a pity that that she doesn\u2019t even like you.\u201dXu Sanshi angrily said, \u201cTang Ya, don\u2019t provoke me! Your Bei Bei swindled me yesterday, yet I haven\u2019t even tried to settle my debts with you guys.\u201dTang Ya stuck her tongue out, then turned around and said to Huo Yuhao, \u201cLittle Yuhao, you should start now. Since someone gave you something good yesterday, you should sell him two roasted fish today.\u201dAfter setting his grill up, Huo Yuhao began to sell his roasted fish at the entrance to Shrek Academy for the second time. However, he didn\u2019t sell the first two roasted fish to Xu Sanshi, as he didn\u2019t have a favourable opinion of this fellow who\u2019d made a move against him yesterday. Furthermore, Wang Dong had paid him first. Hence, the first two fish he roasted went to Wang Dong.The third and fourth went to Tang Ya.Only when Xu Sanshi\u2019s expression had turned increasingly dark, did he receive the fifth and sixth roasted fish. He threw his money towards Huo Yuhao and left.\u201cDelicious, this is really too delicious! Fish can actually be so fragrant?!\u201d As Wang Dong ate, his eyes glowed. Whilst eating the roasted fish, his appearance became completely identical to Tang Ya\u2019s. By the time he\u2019d finished his fish, both his face and hands were dripping with oil.As Huo Yuhao continued to sell roasted fish by the entrance to Shrek Academy, a certain person in a secret room located on the central island of the Sea God Lake gradually woke up from their comatose state.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d The red-shirted woman\u2019s body moved a bit. She subconsciously covered her chest with her right hand and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m too hot, it\u2019s too unbearable\u2026 I feel terrible\u2026 huh?\u201dShe gradually opened her eyes, however her pupils were now faintly pink in colour; the bloody colour within her eyes had receded. There was also a trace of doubt in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s strange, why isn\u2019t it hot anymore?\u201dShe suddenly sat up, subconsciously looking down at herself. Her originally sweat-drenched clothes had already dried. She jumped off the bed she\u2019d been laying on and took off the mask covering her face, revealing a somewhat pale, oval-shaped face. She looked to be about twenty or so, with her facial expression being slightly cold. However, it was still unable to conceal her beauty, which was peerless enough that it could move one\u2019s heart. As she stood there, she exposed her exciting figure which resembled a ripened peach.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d An aged voice rang out, before letting out a long sigh. \u201cXiaotao, you almost made a huge mistake this time! I don\u2019t know whether or not it was destiny, but an otherworldly ice-type energy surged into your body, jolting the evil fire within your body. Can you remember anything you saw after you charged out from Sea God Lake?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she really was as old as she looked, her talent had already reached a level that couldn\u2019t be described with the words \u2018extremely startling\u2019 anymore.Throughout the entire history of the Douluo Continent, even when the first soul masters had appeared, a twenty-year-old Soul Emperor could rank amongst the top in terms of talent; so much so that they could even be compared to Shrek Academy\u2019s first generation Shrek\u2019s Seven Monsters.The aged voice belonged to the white-clothed elder who\u2019d brought her back. When she heard his question, the red-shirted girl, who was named Xiaotao, blankly shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything except for a patch of red appearing in front of me. After that, I felt something life-threatening. I tried to resist, but after that, I woke up here\u2026.\u201dThe white-clothed elder furrowed his brow and walked up to her. He spoke in a low voice, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you couldn\u2019t suppress the evil fire within your body? Aren\u2019t you aware that you almost caused a calamity? Two students from the outer courtyard almost died to your evil fire.\u201dXiaotao was dazed. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that it would be this serious. I thought that I could control it. But\u2026.\u201dThe white-clothed elder let out a long sigh before saying, \u201cThe longer you suppress it, the stronger it\u2019ll be when it erupts. Xiaotao, from now on, postpone your cultivation. Even if you\u2019re the most outstanding genius Shrek Academy has had in the past several hundred years, you can\u2019t destroy yourself for the sake of the school. If the evil fire destroys your consciousness in the future, your teacher will regret it for the rest of his life.\u201dXiaotao stubbornly replied, \u201cNo, teacher. I want to cultivate. I guarantee that it won\u2019t happen again in the future. I can even feel that the evilness and heat from the evil fire have been suppressed. There definitely won\u2019t be any problems in the near future. It\u2019s just\u2026 what kind of power was actually able to suppress my Evil Phoenix Fire?\u201dThe white-clothed elder spoke with a thoughtful tone, \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme, peak-level ice-type energy. Its purity far exceeds that of your Evil Phoenix Fire, and somewhat resembles the Absolute Frost Breath of the Ancient Ice Dragons. It\u2019s completely suppressed the Evil Phoenix Fire\u2019s effects on your body\u2014far more than any of the methods we\u2019ve used.\u201dXiaotao asked with a doubtful tone, \u201cHowever, it\u2019s simply impossible for it to be an Ancient Ice Dragon! Much less in our academy! Could it be someone who\u2019s infiltrated the academy?\u201dThe white-clothed elder shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already sent some people to investigate. I originally thought that it might have been some people from their families who\u2019d been sent to protect them, but after I investigated them, I discovered that that was impossible. They\u2019re called Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao is a special student from the Tang Sect, so I asked Bei Bei about him. He and Tang Ya met him in the Great Star Dou Forest, then brought him back with them. His talent is ordinary; he\u2019s even an orphan. There\u2019s no way that an expert would follow him around and protect him. On the other hand, Wang Dong has quite a large background. However, his background isn\u2019t specialised in ice-type martial souls. As for the academy itself, I\u2019ve asked around several times. There are many students and teachers with ice-type martial souls, but a peak-level ice-type martial soul like this has never been spotted amongst any of them before. It\u2019s truly strange.\u201dXiao Tao replied, \u201cTeacher, forget about it. You don\u2019t need to continue investigating it.\u201dThe white-clothed elder spoke, \u201cThis matter concerns your future, how could I not be worried? If I can at least find the person who possesses this ice-type martial soul, and if he turns out to be male, I\u2019ll let you be a couple with him. That way, you\u2019ll be able to neutralise the negative effects brought about by the Evil Phoenix Fire within your body. That\u2019s the only way that you can truly soar into the heavens in the future. However right now, you\u2019re completely restricted. Not only has your cultivation speed decreased, even your life\u2019s at risk.\u201dXiaotao\u2019s charming face went red. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get married, much less to a person I don\u2019t like for the sake of his martial soul!\u201dThe white-clothed elder sighed. \u201cThe problem is, your evil fire can\u2019t be restrained!\u201dXiaotao humphed and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll restrain it. I don\u2019t want to marry anyone!\u201dThe white-clothed elder said angrily, \u201cMa Xiaotao, if you continue to be this unruly, I won\u2019t recognise you as a disciple anymore.\u201dWhen Ma Xiaotao saw that the white-clothed elder was angry, she immediately began to behave. She proceeded to speak in an aggrieved tone, \u201cBut, teacher I\u2026.\u201dThe white-clothed elder rubbed her head. \u201cFoolish girl. Your emotions can be cultivated, but you only have one life to live, let alone how much talent you have. No matter what, teacher will make sure that you find a good partner.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cNannan, I brought some roasted fish from that kid from yesterday. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t use any violent methods to obtain it. I queued up and bought it.\u201d Xu Sanshi spoke with a polite tone as he stood in front of Jiang Nannan, who\u2019d planned to walk to the canteen.Jiang Nannan shook her head, \u201cNo need, thank you.\u201dXu Sanshi probingly asked, \u201cDo you think I was too violent yesterday? Actually, I\u2019m not normally like that. It\u2019s just that, because of you, I\u2026 Nannan, I know that you still hold a grudge against me because of what happened that time. But, couldn\u2019t our reunion at Shrek Academy be considered a sort of destiny? I really like you! I promise to be faithful to you until I die.\u201dJiang Nannan coldly replied, \u201cI remember telling you that we\u2019d take what we needed, then walk our separate ways after meeting that time. There\u2019s no chance that anything will happen between the two of us. Xu Sanshi, you\u2019re a high and lofty noble, why do you have to bother a little woman like me? I can\u2019t even give you anything. Please don\u2019t interfere with my life in the future. If you continue, I\u2019ll report it to the school. Also, please don\u2019t bully other students because of me.\u201dWhen she finished speaking, she turned around to walk away. However, she was blocked by Xu Sanshi, who angrily said, \u201cMe, bully other students? Don\u2019t you know how badly that Bei Bei bullied me? The person roasting fish yesterday was his junior brother, which he then used as an excuse to swindle me out of two Mysterious Water Pills! Tang Ya even shot a Dragon Beard Needle into my waist, thus I have a huge bruise there now! Just what\u2019s wrong with me? You\u2019re not even willing to give me a chance.\u201dJiang Nannan coldly replied, \u201cYou went to a place like that at such a young age, so what\u2019s can be so \u2018good\u2019 about you?\u201d When she finished speaking, she turned around and left. This time, she directly jumped up, her three yellow soul rings immediately lighting up. Her ears seemed to faintly elongate and prick up, while her body appeared to become even more slender. She pushed off the ground with her legs, and appeared ten metres away, before rapidly running away without turning back.As he gazed at her shrinking back, Xu Sanshi fell into a daze for a while. Afterwards, he fiercely bit off some of the roasted fish that he was holding. \u201cXu Sanshi, you\u2019re such a loser. What\u2019s so amazing about this? I\u2019ll eat it myself. Eh? This roasted fish tastes quite delicious.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How about this. After I treat you to dinner, you can treat me to some roasted fish. How does that sound?\u201d Wang Dong spoke with an excited expression as he recalled the delicious fragrance of the roasted fish he\u2019d just eaten.Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly want to eat roasted fish every night, could you? Even if it\u2019s as tasty as you say it is, you\u2019ll still get tired of it if you eat it too much.\u201dWang Dong replied, \u201cNo worries, I don\u2019t care. Let\u2019s talk about that when I\u2019ve managed to satisfy my cravings. It\u2019s settled; I want to eat four roasted fish tomorrow night! Two fishes just weren\u2019t enough to satisfy me! Besides, did you see how many people were in line today? I think that you should sell a few more fish, it doesn\u2019t waste too much time anyway. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll finish eating them before you\u2019ve even started selling them!\u201dBy this time, the two had already packed up and returned to their dormitory. Before returning to their rooms, they decided to head to the canteen to get some dinner.\u201cWang Dong, since my eldest senior brother gave me another Mysterious Water Pill, do you think that I should eat it or the Soul Advancement Pill first?\u201d Huo Yuhao took out the two pills and asked Wang Dong. Wang Dong was clearly more knowledgeable than him in the field of medicinal pills. After receiving the two pills, Huo Yuhao was truly feeling somewhat impatient. If he added the medicinal properties of the two pills to his own cultivation, he wouldn\u2019t be behind the other students in their class anymore.Wang Dong thought for a while, before replying, \u201cI\u2019d recommend that you not be so eager to take these two pills; at least, for the time being.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked with a puzzled expression.Wang Dong replied, \u201cThink about it. You just used a Mysterious Water Pill yesterday. A lot of your body\u2019s impurities have already been flushed out. The medicinal efficacy of the Mysterious Water Pill will stay in your body for a period of time, but will be dissolved as you continue to meditate. If you take any other medicine right now, even though it\u2019ll still have some partial effects, you\u2019ll waste some of its medicinal power. The Mysterious Water Pill and the Soul Advancement Pill can both be described with the words \u2018Heavenly Treasure\u2019. Since you have such precious pills, you should naturally make full use of them. I suggest that you cultivate for around ten days or so; wait until your body has managed to fully absorb the effects of the first Mysterious Water Pill before you use the second one. You\u2019ll be able to improve your physique by a step, while increasing your soulforce at the same time. Once you\u2019ve finished absorbing the medicinal effects of the Mysterious Water Pills, both your physique and passageways will have had a rather large improvement. If you then use the Soul Advancement Pill\u2014since your body will be free of obstructions\u2014you\u2019ll naturally be able to obtain the greatest amount of benefits possible.\u201dHuo Yuhao felt that Wang Dong\u2019s analysis was extremely reasonable. \u201cThanks, I\u2019m lucky that you told me about all of this now. If you hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have known how to use them effectively. What about you? Are you going to eat your\u2019s today?\u201dWang Dong nodded his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m already at rank twenty one; my physique and passageways are in extremely good condition. It\u2019s naturally perfect for me to absorb the Soul Advancement Pill as soon as possible. When I eat it, I\u2019ll be able to dissolve its medicinal power in a single night. Hehe, I\u2019ll be at rank twenty two tomorrow, or possibly even rank twenty three! Didn\u2019t senior Xiao Ya say that she\u2019d let me enter the Tang Sect if I rank first in the freshmen\u2019s assessment? After eating this Soul Advancement Pill, I\u2019m even more certain that I\u2019ll be able to achieve first place. Alright, I\u2019m going to start now. You should go and cultivate by yourself.\u201dAfter he\u2019d finished speaking, he took out the walnut-sized Soul Advancement Pill and popped it into his mouth. He bit into it softly, causing an extremely strong fragrance to immediately gush out of the pill. Wang Dong inhaled softly, then immediately began to suck a green liquid out from the pill. He didn\u2019t even waste the pill\u2019s outer shell; he popped it into his mouth and chewed it a few times before swallowing it.At that moment, the dorm became suffused with a natural fragrance that resembled a cluster of ten thousand flowers. Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind felt refreshed, while all thirty-six thousand of his pores seemed to open up accordingly, causing a hard-to-describe stimulation to spread through his entire body. He didn\u2019t dare to waste any time, hurriedly sitting on the ground in a cross-legged position to take advantage of the fact that his soulforce had been adjusted to an optimum state for cultivation.After the baptism of the Mysterious Water Pill, cultivation was simply a form of pleasure for Huo Yuhao. He quickly entered a meditative state, then began to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique without any obstructions. It permeated throughout his body while simultaneously increasing his soulforce slowly, albeit at a very stable rate.A faint jade light gradually started to emerge from Wang Dong\u2019s body, followed by the strong refreshing aura that was circulating throughout the room. Some of it was absorbed by Huo Yuhao, but even more of it was inhaled by Wang Dong as he practiced his breathing exercises. Under the stimulation of the Soul Advancement Pill, his soulforce had begun to increase at a startling rate.\u2026\u2026After the twists and turns that had occurred to him two days ago, Huo Yuhao\u2019s school life started to calm down. Not only that, but he\u2019d gradually begun to gain some fame. Practically all of the students and teachers who\u2019d tried his roasted fish had unceasingly praised it.Huo Yuhao increased the number of fish he sold from twenty to thirty, but he was still far from satisfying the desires of the students and teachers. However, he wasn\u2019t willing to make any more, as he still needed most of his time for cultivation.For the sake of a single roasted fish, many students would rush out of the school once class ended. Moreover, because of the high demand for his roasted fish, he had no choice but to impose a limit of one fish per person. However, although the demand for his roasted fish was as high as it was, Huo Yuhao never increased his price, causing him to receive unanimous positive reviews from the students. Furthermore, he even made several new friends.The number one beauty of the outer courtyard, Jiang Nannan, still ended up eating one of his roasted fish in the end, though she queued up by herself in order to buy it. However, the more interesting thing was that, even though Xu Sanshi wasn\u2019t able to please Jiang Nannan with the roasted fish, he also liked its taste. Hence, he became one of Huo Yuhao\u2019s most faithful customers.In the blink of an eye, the first three months of school had passed. Under Zhou Yi\u2019s teaching, which was strict to the point of being perverted, Class 1 could be said to have completely transformed. However, the upper echelon of the academy was slightly astonished by the fact that there were actually between sixty and seventy students left from the three month baptism of Class 1, which Zhou Yi had been in charge of. This was leagues apart from the school\u2019s one-third estimate.If one were to ask who\u2019d changed the most in all of Class 1 during these three months, the answer would undoubtedly be Huo Yuhao.When he entered the academy, his soulforce had merely been rank eleven. In addition to that, he\u2019d just obtained his soul ring. His strength had been absolutely dead last when ranked in the academy, without any suspense at all.However, after these three months, Huo Yuhao had completely changed. Furthermore, not one person had challenged him for his position as class monitor since he\u2019d taken up the role.It wasn\u2019t because Huo Yuhao had used his strength to astonish everyone, or that no one could beat him. Instead, it was because his vigor had sparked the admiration of the students in Class 1. This was the main reason that two-thirds of the class was able to persevere in Class 1, even under Zhou Yi\u2019s strict teaching.Huo Yuhao was truly too hard working. Practically all of the teachers who taught Class 1 knew of his existence. No matter when the class was, nor what lesson was going on, there would always be a pair of eyes focused on the teacher for the duration of the entire lesson; the owner entirely focused on listening to the teacher\u2019s explanation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he was always the most attentive person in the class.Zhou Yi\u2019s level of strictness was second to none in the academy, but not even she was able to find any faults with Huo Yuhao. Her long and cruel physical training was considered torment to students of the same age as him, yet not only had he persisted till the very end of every single training session, he even trained more at night.This was something that Zhou Yi had discovered one night, purely by chance. It just so happened that she needed to go and do something that day. By the time she returned to the academy, it was already late at night. When she\u2019d walked past Shrek Plaza, she\u2019d discovered\u2014to her astonishment\u2014a figure slowly running around the running track. Moreover, the soft clanging of metal had even been ringing out.When she focused, she was able to see the figure of a shirtless, sweat-drenched person. The chainmail on his body had already been soaked with sweat, and every step he took was extremely heavy. Zhou Yi was even able to see the line of sweat that the figure had left behind on the ground.The figure, which wasn\u2019t very tall,yet had both steady and persistent footsteps, was precisely Huo Yuhao. Zhou Yi had been deeply stunned by his actions; he was actually giving himself extra training in the middle of the night!Zhou Yi had called out to Huo Yuhao in order to ask him what he was doing, to which Huo Yuhao had simply replied, \u201cTeacher, I have poor talent; I have to work slightly harder than the others. And, if I meditate after going through physical training, it seems to speed up a bit.\u201dZhou Yi somewhat suspected that Huo Yuhao had known that she was going out that day, which was why he\u2019d purposefully put on a show for her. However, she dismissed this thought not long after she\u2019d thought of it as, no matter if it was windy or rainy, a stealthy figure would always appear in Shrek Plaza. His running sessions would last over four hours and, in addition to that, his chainmail had gradually split in two.When everything was said and done, this was still a school. Even though Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t tell anyone, his actions were still found out by his classmates. There were even a few students who tried to train with Huo Yuhao, but none of them were able to last longer than three days. They already had high-intensity classes during the daytime; if they continued to train late at night, it would no longer be simple physical training. This was practically torturing one\u2019s own body!However, Huo Yuhao still managed to persevere with this torture to his own body. He made the impossible possible. His level of vigor received both the acknowledgement and admiration of every the students in their class. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao managed to forcefully persevere for an entire three months despite Zhou Yi\u2019s harsh requirements, allowing him to become one of the sixty-seven freshmen left in Class 1 .\u2018Hard work can make up for one\u2019s deficiencies.\u2019 These are very simple words, but how many people can truly make them a reality?And yet, Huo Yuhao had done it. Thus, he\u2019d reaped the benefits of his hard work. Make no mistake, the main reason for his cultivation increasing by such a large amount within such a short period was still because of the two Mysterious Water Pills and the Soul Advancement Pill. However, he hadn\u2019t just increased his soulforce. He\u2019d had a comprehensive improvement. It didn\u2019t matter if it was his knowledge, or his various skills; he\u2019d \u2018shed his mortal body and bones\u2019 during the past three months.He\u2019d originally been slightly shorter than Wang Dong, but his height was now roughly the same as Wang Dong\u2019s. His body had also become much more rugged. He didn\u2019t have any exaggerated muscles, but if he were to expose his upper body, you would clearly be able to see that it had become well-proportioned. Every single one of his muscles seemed to be filled with an abundant amount of power.Most importantly, Huo Yuhao\u2019s physique had undergone a heaven-defying change during the past three months. This sort of change was due to both internal and external factors; it absolutely wasn\u2019t just caused by the two Mysterious Water Pills.Since he\u2019d obtained a special understanding of the Mysterious Heaven Technique, Huo Yuhao made sure to report it to Tang Ya and Bei Bei. However, the two of them weren\u2019t able to replicate the passageway-nourishing energy that he\u2019d found.The reason that Huo Yuhao had trained his body late into the night was because the nourishing effect of the Mysterious Heaven Technique would appear whenever his stamina and soulforce were completely exhausted. The intangible changes that were caused by the nourishing effect he felt every time it occurred caused his passageways to expand slightly, but the feeling gradually grew weaker as time passed. However, his cultivation speed was increased by an enormous amount as a result.When Huo Yuhao took the second Mysterious Water Pill, his cultivation speed became seven times faster than it\u2019d been at the start. At the same time, the impurities within his body were one step closer to being entirely expelled. After the past three months of cultivation, his body\u2019s passageways been broadened unceasingly, and had become much more durable. As of now, his cultivation speed was ten times faster than at the start! This was an astonishing increase in cultivation speed!When Huo Yuhao has used the second Mysterious Water Pill, his soulforce had increased by a full rank, bringing him to straight to the peak of the thirteenth rank from the peak of the twelfth rank. After he\u2019d used a period of time to adjust his body\u2019s condition, he\u2019d taken the Soul Advancement Pill. Sure enough, the resulting increase in soulforce brought about by it was even more impressive: Huo Yuhao\u2019s soulforce rose three consecutive ranks, before finally smashing through the fourth\u2019s bottleneck, resulting in his soulforce reaching the seventeenth rank.Now, Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation had reached the average level of the other students in his class. The most praise-worthy thing about this, was that he\u2019d relied on his own cultivation to do so. During these past three months, his soulforce had continued to increase; he\u2019d reached the peak of the seventeenth rank, and was close to breaking through to the eighteenth tank. This was still due to the fact that he\u2019d had to stabilise his foundation after using medicine for his previous breakthroughs. It could definitely be said that his current degree of talent was no longer that of the trash-like degree he\u2019d had when he\u2019d just entered Shrek Academy.\u201cWe\u2019ll stop today\u2019s physical training here.\u201d As Zhou Yi stood behind the teaching platform, her aged face remained indifferent. However, as long as her class was still going on, practically every single student would sit perfectly straight; no one would dare to make any sort of strange movements.\u201cAs of today, three months have passed since you started school. You\u2019re all about to face your first assessment since entering Shrek Academy. If you pass this examination, you\u2019ll formally become first-year students, and will truly become students of Shrek Academy. If nothing unexpected happens, you\u2019ll be able to continue cultivating within the academy until your first year graduation exam at the very least. The assessment will begin tomorrow, so I\u2019d first like to discuss the main points of the assessment.\u201dIt was rare for Zhou Yi\u2019s voice to be as soft as it was. As she swept her gaze across the sixty-seven students beneath her, she was actually extremely pleased with them. Perhaps the quality of this batch of students might not be stronger than the previous batch of students, but after three months of teaching, their willpower absolutely surpassed any previous year\u2019s group that Zhou Yi had taught. To Zhou Yi, this was definitely an unexpected surprise. As the class monitor, Huo Yuhao had played the role of an extremely important role model.\u201cHuo Yuhao.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d Huo Yuhao instantly stood up and respectfully replied.After three months, Huo Yuhao\u2019s respect for Zhou Yi absolutely came from his heart, and it wasn\u2019t because of her strength. Although Zhou Yi frequently came up with some strange ways to teach, and had even tormented them to the point of them wanting to die, it had to be said that her teaching abilities were extraordinarily strong. Furthermore, these strange things that she\u2019d done had had a much greater effect on them than they could\u2019ve imagined. Because of this, not only had the students of Class 1 had a great change in their psychological state, but the ones who were left after the last three months had an aura as firm as a boulder around them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 15.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15.4: Three MonthsHuo Yuhao had observed the students from the other classes, but he hadn\u2019t been able to sense the same sort of temperament from them. It was just as Bei Bei had said: Even though Zhou Yi was a very strict teacher, one would definitely become an outstanding student, or even a true expert in the future, so long as that person could persevere through her classes.Zhou Yi beckoned towards Huo Yuhao, causing him to hurriedly walk towards the teaching platform and take a stack of papers from her. He didn\u2019t need Zhou Yi to tell him what to do, as he quickly handed them out to every single student in the class.Zhou Yi said, \u201cAfter the freshmen assessment ends, your classes will be in line with your abilities. Write down the direction you wish for your future cultivation to go, and give it back to me later.\u201dThe direction she was referring to was organized as such: Assault, Defense, Control, and Auxiliary. These were the four types of soul masters. During the first three months of teaching, everyone would be together in the same class. However, once the true freshman classes had started, everyone had to be separated. After all, the difference in cultivation paths between soul masters from different categories was extremely large.After Huo Yuhao had returned to his seat, he was the first one to write down which direction he was going to follow. He naturally wrote down the words \u2018Control System Soul Master\u2019, before signing the bottom of the page with his own name. However, he didn\u2019t notice that Wang Dong, who was sitting next to him, had glanced at the contents of his page before writing down his own.Zhou Yi said, \u201cYou\u2019re all students that I\u2019ve taught. Even though you\u2019ll be split into different classes after this assessment, I hope you brats won\u2019t forget the things that I\u2019ve taught you. Hand your papers back to me after class. Now then, I\u2019ll go over the main points of the freshman assessment.\u201dAs she was speaking, Zhou Yi turned around and walked back to the blackboard. She then drew a few lines, and proceeded to write the word \u2018Battle\u2019 in the middle of the blackboard.\u201cBattle. That\u2019s right, you\u2019ll have to fight in the freshmen assessment. Furthermore, it\u2019s a battle that everyone has to participate in. I know, the tool soul masters amongst you lot, and especially the auxiliary and food system ones, will find this very strange. \u2018Why do you have to participate in the fight as well?\u2019 Well, you didn\u2019t hear me wrongly. You all have to appear on the battlefield too, just like the battle soul masters. Even though Shrek Academy educates all types of talented soul masters, your ability on the battlefield is still the most important thing. I told you all this once before, on the day that school started. Ever since the appearance of soul tools, the line dividing the types of soul masters has begun to blur. Even if you\u2019re an auxiliary or food system tool soul master, you\u2019ll still be able to explode with an extremely strong combat power by relying on soul tools. However, where will your combat instincts come from? Don\u2019t tell me that a soul master can just be given a soul tool, and will then be magically able to survive by dim-wittedly standing around on the battlefield? Obviously not. Your combat instincts have honed from real battles. Because of this, all of you will have to undergo this combat assessment.\u201d\u201cOf course, the academy naturally won\u2019t allow auxiliary system tool soul masters to fight with assault system battle soul masters, that\u2019s just too unfair to you lot. As such, the freshmen assessment will be conducted using a form of team battles. However, there won\u2019t be too many people in a team. Ultimately, the academy has decided that this year, there will be three people per team. This is a rather high number for people at your age to attempt to synergize well with. When you\u2019re making your groups, you can only have one assault system soul master at most, while your other two team members can be chosen as you wish. We\u2019ll first put students who are in the same dorm room together into teams, and let you make the rest of your teams as you wish. As for people who aren\u2019t able to join a team, we\u2019ll draw lots to decide your teams. If you wait a moment, I\u2019ll give you a rather rational plan to create your own teams.\u201d\u201cThe freshmen assessment will be conducted with every single student from the entire year participating, as the number of students who\u2019ve joined Shrek Academy year is quite large. This time, there\u2019ll be a total of almost three hundred teams of students participating in the freshman assessment, but only half of them will be able to remain in the academy, which also means that only the top one hundred and fifty teams will pass. This ranking will be based off of how many points you accumulate in your battles.\u201d\u201cYour matches will be organized via lot drawing, with every team having to fight in at least ten matches. Finally, a ranking will be created based off of the number of matches you\u2019ve won. Of them, the top sixty-four will have a knockout round, with the top four teams in each getting a different prize. The prize for the champion will be extremely precious.\u201dEvery student in the room was listening with rapt attention. To them, the freshman assessment was the key that decided whether or not they could stay in the academy. If they were eliminated, they could only return and choose another sub-first ranked college. If they did, they might not be able to ever become a pinnacle expert on the Douluo Continent. They\u2019d already worked hard for three months; nobody wished to get eliminated at this point in their studies.Zhou Yi indifferently said, \u201cOur class currently has sixty-seven people, thus we can make twenty-two teams, with one person remaining. I\u2019ll divide all of you up according to your martial souls, and after doing some careful analysis, I\u2019ll help you make your teams. If anyone isn\u2019t satisfied, you can change your teammates after returning to your dorm. However, if no one disagrees when we register tomorrow morning, then you\u2019ll have to strictly follow my arrangements. If you do, I think you\u2019re all pretty clear on what\u2019ll happen.\u201d\u201cSong Qinghan.\u201d Zhou Yi said in a low voice.\u201cPresent.\u201d A somewhat small student quickly stood up. He\u2019d never been too conspicuous within the class, so he clearly hadn\u2019t thought that Zhou Yi would call him out first.Zhou Yi said, \u201cEvery teacher in charge of a freshman class can propose that a student directly pass the assessment. The person that I\u2019m choosing is you. After observing you for a while, I believe that you\u2019re the most suitable to join the Soul Engineering Institution and continue cultivating. Do you have any problems with that? Right now, you have two choices. You can either join to the Soul Engineering Institution, or you can pack your bags.\u201dOverbearing, she was truly too overbearing. Every single student within the class simultaneously looked over at Song Qinghan.\u201cI\u2019m willing to go to the Soul Engineering Institution. Thank you, Teacher Zhou.\u201d Song Qinghan didn\u2019t resist Zhou Yi\u2019s overbearingness at all, excitedly jumping up and down. The reason that he\u2019d came to Shrek Academy had been to enter the Soul Engineering Institution in the first place!Zhou Yi gestured for him to sit back down. \u201cNext, we\u2019ll be splitting you into teams. The first team is Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao.\u201dHuo Yuhao and Wang Dong practically stood up at the same time. They\u2019d originally been willing to form a team anyway, but when they heard Zhou Yi personally group them together, they looked at each other and were able to see the happiness reflected in each other\u2019s eyes.The other person who stood up with them was a female student who sat in the front row. She wasn\u2019t tall. In fact she was quite small, just like Song Qinghan. She didn\u2019t particularly stand out in the class, either. Her various abilities seemed to rank amongst the middle of the class.The little girl wasn\u2019t especially beautiful, but she had a delicate and pretty look, and could at least be appreciated. Her face had a hint of bashfulness when she turned around. However, her gaze directly went right past Huo Yuhao and landed on Wang Dong\u2019s increasingly handsome face. Her face reddened, before she turned back around and lowered her head.\u201cFor the second team, we\u2019ll have Zi Hao, Ma Qingshuang, and Leng Leng.\u201d\u201cFor the third team, \u2026.\u201dZhou Yi looked and sounded very overbearing, but after she\u2019d finished announcing the division of the teams, every student in the class seemed to have been relieved of a heavy burden.As Huo Yuhao coolly observed the class, he couldn\u2019t help but let out an inward sigh of admiration. Even if Teacher Zhou normally had a cold expression on her face, and was very strict, in reality, she thoroughly understood every single one of her students. These groups had clearly been thoroughly thought out by her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you have any suggestions, you\u2019d best bring them up quickly. I\u2019ll give you a day to think about it. The other classes are also splitting up into teams, but they definitely won\u2019t be as quick as you lot. Let them dawdle around and waste more of their time. When you return that piece of paper to me, you can be dismissed. When you get back, make sure to have a good rest. Nobody\u2019s allowed to go around and start a mess. The freshman assessment will start tomorrow, and my goal is for all twenty-two of your teams to pass. If anyone gets eliminated, they won\u2019t just have to pack their bags and leave. I\u2019ll make sure to give you some memories that you\u2019ll never forget.\u201dWhen the students of Class 1 saw Zhou Yi\u2019s gaze, which had suddenly become heavy, they couldn\u2019t help but fiercely shiver. There was no question about what sort of memories Zhou Yi would leave behind; they would probably be a nightmare for them.The entirety of Class 1 suddenly filled with a murderous look for a moment. Even if it was just for the sake of not being abused by Teacher Zhou, they wanted to do their best to pass the assessment!\u201cHuo Yuhao, Wang Dong, Xiao Xiao, you three stay behind for a bit.\u201dWhen the other students handed over the white pieces of paper that had their future direction of cultivation written on it, they left the classroom to walk back to their dorms. The only people left behind in the classroom was Huo Yuhao\u2019s group of three. At this time, the other classes were still enthusiastically explaining the division of teams for the freshman assessment.\u201cAlright, give it to me. What\u2019re you hiding Wang Dong?\u201d Zhou Yi took the three pieces of paper from Huo Yuhao\u2019s group. Wang Dong immediately lowered his head and quietly took a few steps back, hiding behind Huo Yuhao.As Zhou Yi looked at the three pieces of paper in front of her, the corners of her eyes twitched. Afterwards, she raised her head and looked towards Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao.When Zhou Yi looked at them with that sharp gaze of hers, the three of them felt as if their bodies had been impaled.\u201cAlright! You three, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d She picked up one of the sheets of paper, then slammed it down onto the table.\u201cAlright!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three simultaneously shivered.\u201cControl System.\u201d Zhou Yi said coldly.Afterwards, she took the second piece of paper and slapped it heavily onto the table.\u201cControl System!\u201d Her voice had clearly gotten louder by quite a bit. Huo Yuhao was somewhat astonished as he looked at Wang Dong beside him. There was no doubt about it, this second piece of paper belonged to him!\u201cBang\u2014!\u201d Zhou Yi\u2019s last slap nearly crushed the teaching platform. \u201cAnd Control System.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d This time, it was Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong\u2019s turn to be astonished. The two cast their gaze towards Xiao Xiao, who currently had her head lowered and was fiddling with the corner of her shirt. From their first impression of her, Xiao Xiao should\u2019ve been an auxiliary system tool soul master! How had she turned into a control system soul master?The corner of Zhou Yi\u2019s mouth twitched following the twitching of her eye. \u201cAre you three brats doing this on purpose? Although the freshman assessment limits each team to having a single assault system soul master, it also states that you can\u2019t all have the same cultivation direction. You three are really good, eh? You\u2019ve all decided to be control system soul masters. Are you doing this on purpose? If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the competition was starting tomorrow, I would\u2019ve made you run ten hours in a row to clear your minds. Huo Yuhao, you can be the first to tell me what\u2019s going on. What\u2019s gotten into you? That spiritual-type martial soul of yours is extremely suitable as an auxiliary-type! What\u2019s the meaning behind you becoming a control system soul master?\u201dHuo Yuhao hastily replied, \u201cTeacher Zhou, I\u2019ve always hoped that I could become a control system soul master. My Spiritual Detection can survey the entire state of the battlefield, and in addition to that, some of the future soul rings that my Spirit Eyes absorb will definitely have a few attack-type soul skills. Because of that, I don\u2019t want to become a simple auxiliary-type soul master. Being a control-type soul master should be more suitable for my future growth.\u201dZhou Yi slowly nodded her head and said, \u201cYou have a point; control system soul masters have better future prospects than auxiliary-type ones. The choice that you\u2019ve made isn\u2019t exactly wrong. I\u2019ll consider you to have passed. Wang Dong, why are you hiding? Come on out. Even though Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao wrote down the words \u2018control system\u2019, they\u2019re still a bit reasonable. But what about you? You, an assault system soul master, writing down the words \u2018control system\u2019\u2026 are you deliberately looking for trouble?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Wang Dong carefully took a step back from behind Huo Yuhao and spoke with a self-mocking smile on his face, \u201cTeacher Zhou, please don\u2019t be angry. Honestly, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s completely impossible for me to become a control system soul master with my strength. Right, I want to rely on my attack power to control the entire battlefield. Isn\u2019t that a type of \u2018control\u2019? Furthermore, I can fly and launch long-range attacks. It\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be impossible for me to control the battlefield this way, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhou Yi was almost angered to the point of laughing. Her eyes contained profundities as she stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know your real reasoning. You just don\u2019t want to be split up with Huo Yuhao. I\u2019ll just call you foolish for that. You clearly have the highest cultivation in the entire class, yet you\u2019re barely enough to be called a genius. You\u2019re smart, yet how you can be stupid to be point of being a drooling idiot? Just when have you ever seen an assault system and control system soul master split up? You\u2019re right, they\u2019ll be in different classes. However, assault system and control system soul masters are always together! You idiot! Change it for me right now!\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, she threw the piece of paper in her hand back towards Wang Dong.\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201d Although he\u2019d been scolded and called an idiot, Wang Dong still seemed excited. He quickly changed the words \u2018control system\u2019 to \u2018assault system\u2019, before respectfully handing the paper back to Zhou Yi.\u201cHumph!\u201d Zhou Yi snorted angrily. She directed her gaze towards Xiao Xiao last. \u201cWhat about you, Xiao Xiao? If I\u2019m not mistaken, your martial soul is the extremely rare Soulcrush Cauldron, which can be considered a top-ranked martial soul. The main effect of the Soulcrush Cauldron is to assist someone else; why did you put down the words \u2018control system\u2019?\u201dXiao Xiao glanced at Wang Dong and spoke in a soft voice, \u201cTeacher Zhou, my Soulcrush Cauldron is a bit different from an ordinary Soulcrush Cauldron. It can both attack and assist others. I\u2019m even barely able to use it for defense. It can be considered a mutated Soulcrush Cauldron. It\u2019s known as a Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.\u201dZhou Yi was stunned for a moment. \u201cXiao Xiao, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know that if your cultivation direction is too messy, it\u2019ll be disadvantageous towards your future development? I suggest that you lean towards one direction, and develop from there. Even if it\u2019s a mutated martial soul, you\u2019ll still have to have an direction when you\u2019re adding soul rings.\u201dXiao Xiao nodded her head and said, \u201cI know, that\u2019s why the main abilities I\u2019ve chosen for my Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron are attacking and defensive ones.\u201dZhou Yi furrowed her brow and said, \u201cThat\u2019s also unrelated to control!\u201d It could be seen that she was being extremely patient towards Xiao Xiao.Xiao Xiao said in a meek voice, \u201cBut, I have another martial soul. It can manage both support and control.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d At this moment, it wasn\u2019t just Zhou Yi who was astonished; even Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had widened their eyes. Wang Dong\u2019s shock was especially great. He\u2019d always thought that he was an absolutely unrivalled figure within Class 1. He never thought that there\u2019d actually be someone like her hidden within the class.\u201cTwin martial souls?\u201d Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong said at practically the same time.Xiao Xiao lowered her head shyly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the first time that a situation like this had occurred in Class 1, which exceeded her control. After thinking to herself for a moment, she said, \u201cFine, be a control system soul master if that\u2019s your wish. It\u2019ll also be easier for the three of you to work together in the future. Even though the freshman assessment is only your first examination within Shrek Academy, it\u2019s very important for your future cultivation path. The only way for you to have a chance to appear in the academy\u2019s cultivation honor roll is for you to obtain a good ranking in the freshman assessment. Being in this class, I\u2019m optimistic about the chances that you three have. I don\u2019t even need to mention Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao; you two alone have talents and strengths that far exceed those of the other students. As for you, Huo Yuhao, even though you have an ordinary amount of strength and talent, you have a level of willpower that ordinary people aren\u2019t able to even strive for, as well as an extraordinary spiritual-type martial soul. Without even taking Xiao Xiao\u2019s second martial soul into account, you three already complement each other to a certain extent. I\u2019ll give you a mission. In the freshman assessment, you only have one target: Become the champions! If you don\u2019t return as the champions, then so be it for Xiao Xiao. However you two, on the other hand, will have to continue following me as you cultivate.\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cTeacher Zhou, even if we become the champions, I\u2019ll still be willing to follow you.\u201dZhou Yi was stunned. \u201cYou foolish brat, don\u2019t you also think that I\u2019m extremely strict? I know what they call me in private. You don\u2019t have to lie to me to make me happy.\u201dHuo Yuhao shook his head before saying seriously, \u201cNo, Teacher Zhou. I truly am willing to follow you and continue learning from you. Even though you\u2019re a bit fierce, I can still learn many more useful things from you if I do. I\u2019ve occasionally observed the students from other classes; their growth hasn\u2019t been nearly as large as our class\u2019s\u2014at least during these past three months.\u201dZhou Yi\u2019s face finally revealed the trace of a smile. Although her aged face didn\u2019t look even remotely pretty when she smiled, this was the first time that Huo Yuhao had felt a sense of warmth from her body.\u201cAlright, you three can go back and rest. Remember, you three definitely have to become the champions of the freshman assessment. Also, I can at least tell you three this: Shrek Academy has an enormous amount of wealth. Out of all the assessments the academy holds, the champions of the freshman assessment and the champions of the outer courtyard\u2019s graduation assessment receive the most generous rewards. As for what those rewards actually are\u2026well, you\u2019ll naturally find out when you become the champions of the freshman assessment. Head back and make sure that you\u2019re in top condition. I believe in your strength.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d They all answered her simultaneously, before proceeding to leave the classroom together.Once they\u2019d left, Xiao Xiao looked as if she\u2019d finally drummed up enough courage to ask something. \u201cWang Dong, can I talk to you for a bit?\u201dHowever, Wang Dong waved his hand and replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. Right now, I have to go back and prepare for tomorrow\u2019s competition. You can show us how amazing your twin martial souls are when the assessment starts, Xiao Xiao.\u201d After he finished speaking, he grabbed Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulder and left.When he saw the disappointment in Xiao Xiao\u2019s eyes, Huo Yuhao smiled at her, causing Xiao Xiao to forcefully return the smile. They were still young, so the somewhat hazy feeling that they had towards the opposite sex often was solely based on the other party\u2019s appearance. Although Wang Dong\u2019s rejection had caused her to be slightly disappointed, she didn\u2019t think much more about it. She only thought inwardly to herself, \u201cWhat\u2019s so amazing about you? Just wait till the assessment starts. When it starts you\u2019ll see just how amazing my abilities are, humph!\u201d Her arrogance had always been hidden within the deep recesses of her heart.\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to be so obvious when you rejected her, did you?\u201d Huo Yuhao teased Wang Dong.During the past three months, the two had become very familiar with each other. To Huo Yuhao, their intense life of cultivating had only been another way to temper his body. However, his mind had experienced an unprecedented amount of relaxation. At least here, every single student within the academy was equal; he didn\u2019t feel anything that resembled the class division that he\u2019d previously felt when he was in the Duke\u2019s Mansion. As his mind had relaxed, his personality had begun to turn much more cheerful. He was no longer that reticent and shy youth that he\u2019d been when he\u2019d just arrived.Wang Dong curled his lip and boastfully stated, \u201cThere are several girls who\u2019ve liked me. Don\u2019t tell me that I should accept all of them?\u201d After he said this, he switched to a sagely tone of voice. \u201cWe\u2019re still young, thus we should be focusing everything on our studies. How can we have other thoughts like this? Huo Yuhao, your mentality truly is unhealthy.\u201d\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t beat him in an argument. \u201cYou win!\u201dWang Dong laughed cunningly and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Since we\u2019ve been let out early today, you roast some fish for me to eat. We\u2019ll be formally registering for the assessment tomorrow, so I\u2019m guessing that the assessment will only start the day after. It seems that our time to show off has finally come.\u201dHuo Yuhao snapped back, \u201cYou eat roasted fish everyday! Will you ever get tired of it? Not only that, but the exam is the day after tomorrow! Shouldn\u2019t you polish your skills before the battle?\u201dWang Dong humphed. \u201cYou brain-dead idiot. You only know how to cultivate. Aren\u2019t you scared of becoming an idiot that only knows how to cultivate?\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled and said, \u201cAs they say, the clumsy bird leaves early to reach the forest first. Since I\u2019m untalented, the only thing that I can do to compensate for my weaknesses is work hard. I\u2019m sure you know that the main reason my soulforce was able to reach the seventeenth rank was because of the pills we took. I honestly think that I wouldn\u2019t have a very high chance of passing the assessment with another group. Teacher Zhou\u2019s clearly taking care of me by putting me in the same group as you and Xiao Xiao. If I don\u2019t work even harder, wouldn\u2019t I simply be letting her kindness go to waste?\u201dWang Dong curled his lips and said, \u201cYour talent might be nothing much, but your martial soul is still quite good. Don\u2019t worry, with myself\u2014a genius\u2014here, don\u2019t talk about a few freshmen, even some second year students might not be able to beat me. When the time comes, you only need to activate your Spiritual Detection Sharing and watch me do my job from the back. With me leading our group, becoming champions will be as simple as just stretching our hands out and grabbing it.\u201dHuo Yuhao reminded him, \u201cOur Shrek Academy is till the number one academy in the world. It\u2019s always been filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers; you can\u2019t be too careless. However, I think that Xiao Xiao\u2019s quite strong as well. When the time comes, you two absolutely have to work together.\u201dHe had four amazing spiritual-type soul skills, but Wang Dong only knew of his combined Spiritual Detection Sharing. As for his hand-to-hand combat skills, although he had a slight foundation in the Tang Sect\u2019s secret techniques, simply relying on them and the strength of his martial soul wouldn\u2019t be enough for a fair fight. It just just as Wang Dong had said\u2014during the upcoming assessment, his greatest use would truly be his Spiritual Detection Sharing.Even though Wang Dong could beat Huo Yuhao in a war of words, he couldn\u2019t change how stubborn he was. When the two of them returned to their dorm room, they ended up meditating and cultivating. However, Huo Yuhao promised Wang Dong that he\u2019d roast a few extra fish for him after the assessment.Huo Yuhao\u2019s seventeenth ranked soulforce could already condense into a white stream inside Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. As it travelled throughout his body, following the circulation path of the Mysterious Heaven Technique, it seemed to pierce through his entire body, warming up his passageways. Not only was it comfortable, it also brought about an obvious improvement in Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation.After three months of bitter cultivation, Huo Yuhao was able to faintly sense that his passageways had expanded by a large amount. This was due, in part, to the subtle effects of the Mysterious Water Pill, as well as to the nourishing effect of the Mysterious Heaven Technique that he\u2019d discovered by chance. Furthermore, his passageways were extremely elastic and durable now. In terms of physiques, Huo Yuhao was no longer inferior to anyone of the same age as him. However, the fact that he\u2019d stepped onto the right path rather late was undeniable. It wasn\u2019t very likely that he\u2019d catch up to Wang Dong. Hence, he could only choose to improve alongsideh Wang Dong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to his brother Skydream, his strength would rapidly soar when he obtained his second soul ring, especially when his ice-type martial soul truly had its own abilities.Huo Yuhao looked forward to that moment very much. When that happened, he\u2019d definitely be able to help Wang Dong a lot more when they fought side-by-side.Time always passed extremely the fastest during meditation; evening soon arrived. Like yesterday, Huo Yuhao walked over to the canteen to clean his fish before he headed towards the academy\u2019s entrance.The flow of people at the academy\u2019s entrance had clearly been reduced. Perhaps it was due to the upcoming freshman assessment, but a majority of the freshmen felt a sense of urgency, causing them to bitterly cultivate inside of their dorm rooms.However, Huo Yuhao\u2019s business wasn\u2019t affected by this at all. When he arrived, a queue had already formed, with the person in front being, amazingly, Xu Sanshi.\u201cDing\u2014\u201d Xu Sanshi handed Huo Yuhao a silver soul coin and said, \u201cNo need to hand me any change; just make sure to give me a big fish.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled and replied, \u201cBig brother Xu, nothing can stop you, can it?\u201dThe previous rift between the two had already closed. After beginning to see each other every day, they\u2019d long become familiar with each other. After he became familiar with Xu Sanshi, Huo Yuhao discovered that, even though he wasn\u2019t as gentle as Bei Bei, and even though he had a bit of a violent temper and a fiery disposition, he was still extremely sincere with his friendships.Xu Sanshi laughed mischievously. \u201cWho was the one that made me like what you roast? If I don\u2019t at least get a bite of this every night, my dinner won\u2019t taste delicious at all. I\u2019ve eaten many roasted fish in the past, but not a single person was able to control the fire as well as you do. Even Jiang Nannan has praised your roasting technique. Right, I\u2019ve heard that the freshman assessment\u2019s about to start?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded his head a few times and replied, \u201cYeah!\u201dXu Sanshi said, \u201cThen you have to work hard. You can\u2019t get eliminated! If you do, I won\u2019t be able to eat anymore roasted fish.\u201d Even now, he still didn\u2019t know that Huo Yuhao had been behind Bei Bei\u2019s victory during their match. He only knew that Huo Yuhao\u2019s talent was ordinary, but that he could roast fish extremely well. Actually, Huo Yuhao\u2019s fame in Shrek Academy for his roasted fish was definitely greater than fame for his strength.\u201cLittle Xu.\u201d At this moment, a crisp voice suddenly rang out. When Xu Sanshi heard this voice, he immediately began to shiver. Huo Yuhao even saw a few hints of fear, but even more than that, helplessness, appear within his eyes.The other diners that had queued up behind Xu Sanshi instantly quieted down.A girl walked out from the academy\u2019s entrance with slow steps, causing the crowd to open up a path for her in a very natural manner, so much so that they didn\u2019t even dane to look at her; they all lowered their heads as she passed. Her appearance clearly exceeded that of Jiang Nannan\u2019s appearance last time.When Huo Yuhao raised his head to see who the girl was, he discovered that the newcomer was a red-clothed woman. Her body was slender and well-proportioned, with the first thing that most people would notice when looking at her being her slightly exaggerated peaks that were firm, towering, and lustful\u2026Her waist was extremely slim, with that slimness continuing all the way down to her thighs, where it suddenly arced out. Her legs were perfectly straight and round, while at the same time a strong aura of youthfulness that was emanated by her assaulted one\u2019s senses.However, her facial features couldn\u2019t clearly be seen; she wore a red veil over her face. However, one could tell that she was definitely a beauty from just her eyes alone. Her faintly-pink eyes could easily make one feel as if his soul had been swept away. Fortunately, her gaze was extremely cold, which slightly suppressed the glow of rapture in her eyes that was capable of penetrating into one\u2019s bones.Xu Sanshi clearly seemed to recognise her. After summoning up some courage, he turned around. However, he didn\u2019t look directly into her eyes; he lowered his head slightly instead, and replied, \u201cSister Xiaotao.\u201dAt this moment, Huo Yuhao was even more astonished. Xu Sanshi was an untameable person with quite a fiery disposition, who had an even higher status than Bei Bei in the outer courtyard due to him being a fifth year student. Because of his great talent, many sixth year students were somewhat reverent of him; even teachers wouldn\u2019t cause him to act like this! Just who was this red-clothed girl? After looking at the girl closely, both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong felt as if she looked slightly familiar for some reason.The red-clothed girl looked over at Huo Yuhao\u2019s oven, then slowly walked up to Xu Sanshi and said, \u201cLittle Xu, you\u2019ve come to eat roasted fish?\u201dXu Sanshi nodded his head and said, \u201cYeah! Huo Yuhao\u2019s roasted fish tastes extraordinary. It\u2019s really tasty.\u201dA slight trace of curiosity appeared on the red-clothed girl\u2019s eyes, and she said to Huo Yuhao, \u201cLet me try one.\u201d She wasn\u2019t the type of fairy that wouldn\u2019t eat the food of \u2018common mortals\u2019. Practically all of her days were spent cultivating, so she was naturally excited when she found something new.Huo Yuhao subconsciously replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I only sell thirty fish a day. Thirty people have already queued up today, so please come earlier on tomorrow.\u201dThese exact words had been uttered by him countless times before. However, when his voice rang out this time, practically everyone standing in the queue simultaneously raised their heads to look at him with terrified expressions; even Xu Sanshi wasn\u2019t an exception.Following that, the people who\u2019d been queued behind Xu Sanshi loudly dispersed and walked away as fast as they could, causing Huo Yuhao to become even more astonished.The red-clothed girl smiled and said, \u201cOkay, there\u2019s no one left in the queue now. I think that I should be able to eat one now, right?\u201dXu Sanshi continuously made a few gestures to Huo Yuhao with his eyes. Huo Yuhao wasn\u2019t someone who didn\u2019t understand how things worked. After nodding his head, he continued to roast his fish seriously.However, Wang Dong who was at his side was somewhat indignant. \u201cWho are you? Why did you disturb our business?\u201dThe red-clothed girl raised her right hand, exposing her tender hand. On it, there was a large blood-like crimson ruby that was absolutely beautiful. The ruby flashed, causing a single gold soul coin to appear in her hand. She then passed it to Wang Dong and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take all of today\u2019s roasted fish.\u201dWang Dong wasn\u2019t polite at all as he took the gold soul coin. Afterwards, he didn\u2019t utter another word. Although this red-clothed girl was threatening to the point of scaring so many people away, she didn\u2019t look unreasonable. Furthermore, he felt that something was wrong; a few traces of fear towards this red-clothed girl had actually appeared in his heart.However, Huo Yuhao honestly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need this much money. My roasted fish only cost five copper soul coins apiece.\u201dThe red-clothed girl seemed as if she wasn\u2019t willing to talk with him anymore. She indifferently said, \u201cJust take it as a deposit. Just don\u2019t ask me for money if I want to eat here in the future.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Huo Yuhao nodded and replied whilst simultaneously continuing to carefully roast fish.The red-clothed girl originally looked as if she\u2019d come to find Xu Sanshi, but she didn\u2019t even seem to care about Xu Sanshi now. Instead, she was now focusing on Huo Yuhao as he roasted fish.After a short period of time, she let out a soft cry of surprise. \u201cYour fire-controlling technique is this perfect?! Do you have a fire-type martial soul?\u201d She herself was an expert in the field of fire, so she was naturally able to see that Huo Yuhao\u2019s fire-control while he was roasting the fish had reached the apex of precision.Huo Yuhao simply shook his head.After a short period of time, he finished roasting the first four fish. Since nobody else was coming today, Huo Yuhao simply passed two to the red-clothed girl and two to Xu Sanshi. In reality, he didn\u2019t just buy thirty mackerels everyday; any extra fish were naturally left to Tang Ya and Wang Dong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 16.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16.4: Freshman ExaminationWhen Xu Sanshi had first seen the red-clothed girl, he had clearly been somewhat distressed. He wasn\u2019t even as passionate as he normally was whilst eating his roasted fish. On the other hand, the red-clothed girl slowly raised her veil, revealing her absolutely beautiful face, as she slowly began to eat the roasted fish.Her movements were extremely graceful as she carefully ate the fish. However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were stunned by the mysterious disappearance of the fish bones from her hand after she\u2019d finished eating the fish. She\u2019d clearly used her hands to eat the fish, yet there weren\u2019t any oil stains on her hand at all.Just what power was this? Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong glanced at each other, both seeing the shock reflected in each other\u2019s eyes.The two pieces of roasted fish were quickly finished by her. When she finished, the red-clothed girl nodded at Huo Yuhao and said, \u201cYour roasted fish are very tasty. They seem to have been seriously made. Now then, let me see your martial soul.\u201dHer words had an irrefusable tone to them. Ever since the evil fire in her body had been suppressed by that mysterious ice element, she hadn\u2019t disturbed by her martial soul\u2019s overbearing demonism for a full three months. However, that icy aura had gradually been refined by her martial soul\u2019s phoenix flames as time passed, causing a backlash to gradually appear. The reason that she was looking for Xu Sanshi was because of his Mysterious Underworld Turtle, which was currently the best water-type martial soul in the academy. If she borrowed a certain amount of his strength, she could suppress the evil fire in her body. To Xu Sanshi, this process was just like tempering iron into steel\u2014it only brought benefits. However, it was extremely painful. That was why Xu Sanshi had immediately had a bitter expression when he saw her. Furthermore, this wasn\u2019t the first time that she\u2019d tormented him like this.Huo Yuhao eyebrows furrowed slightly, while Wang Dong had an indignant look on his face. However, he was stopped by Huo Yuhao\u2019s raised hand. He slowly raised his head and looked towards the red-clothed girl. After that, a faint golden light emerged in his eyes. As that happened, a sheen of purple rippled through his deep blue eyes.Of all the secret techniques he\u2019d learned from the Tang Sect, Huo Yuhao\u2019s greatest improvement lay in the Purple Demon Eyes. Whenever he absorbed the purple qi that rose from the east every morning, his Spirit Eyes would naturally generate a siphoning effect. For him, a single day\u2019s worth of cultivating the Purple Demon Eyes was better than ten days worth of cultivation for Bei Bei and Tang Ya. Because of this, his Purple Demon Eyes had improved extremely quick.The red-clothed girl raised her long eyebrows slightly when she sensed Huo Yuhao\u2019s mysterious Spiritual Detection Sharing.Following the increase in his cultivation, the strength of Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul ring had gradually begun to increase, as per the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s words. The strength of his tolerance would determine how much strength his first soul ring could manifest.In the beginning, although his first soul ring contained four soul skills within it, their effects had only been equivalent to that of a four hundred year soul ring. However, his first soul ring now possessed the power of a soul ring that was around six hundred years, with the maximum range of his Spiritual Detection and his Spiritual Interference now reaching a diameter of fifty metres. Furthermore, the effects of these skills were even more detailed than they had previously been.Part of the first seal that the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s had made within Huo Yuhao\u2019s body had already been unlocked. As long as Huo Yuhao continued to make breakthroughs in his cultivation, the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s powerful origin energy would automatically increase the strength of his first soul ring. This was something that other soul masters couldn\u2019t even dare to dream about. His first soul ring would only continue to grow more terrifying as his cultivation level rose.The Skydream Iceworm couldn\u2019t give Huo Yuhao an instant power boost, but it had given him an astonishingly bright future.Huo Yuhao kept his Spiritual Detection Sharing active for about ten seconds, before withdrawing it. After a few moments of what seemed to be shock, the red-clothed girl nodded towards Huo Yuhao. She then gazed deeply at the single white soul ring that rose up from his feet and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the strongest ten year soul ring I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dHuo Yuhao replied in a very natural manner, \u201cIt\u2019s still only a ten year soul ring.\u201dThe red-clothed girl laughed softly and said, \u201cI\u2019m Ma Xiaotao, nice to meet you. If I have the chance, I\u2019ll come back again to eat your roasted fish. Little Xu, let\u2019s go.\u201dXu Sanshi had a pained expression as he said, \u201cSister Xiaotao, can you please be a bit more gentle today?\u201dMa Xiaotao gave him an indifferent glance, causing him to immediately correct himself, \u201cI don\u2019t have any problems, none at all.\u201d As he spoke, he hurriedly walked in front of Ma Xiaotao and gestured for her to continue.Only after the two had entered the academy did Wang Dong mutter, \u201cHer name\u2019s really tacky\u2026.\u201dHuo Yuhao said in response, \u201cCan a name prove anything? Don\u2019t you think that she seemed a bit familiar?\u201dWang Dong was suddenly startled. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t be that person we met at the lake last time, could she? She was also wearing red clothes\u2026 could she be a disciple of the inner courtyard?\u201dHuo Yuhao shrugged his shoulders in response, expressing his doubt.A group of people came rushing back and queued at his stall as soon as Ma Xiaotao and Xu Sanshi had left. The person in front, who happened to be a fourth year student, overheard the conversation between the two. He immediately whispered, \u201cJunior classmen, you need to quiet down a bit. You can\u2019t just talk about disciples from the inner courtyard like that, especially senior Xiaotao.\u201dHuo Yuhao asked in astonishment, \u201cShe\u2019s really from the inner courtyard?\u201dThe upperclassman replied, \u201cObviously. Within Shrek Academy, red-clothed students are all seniors from the inner courtyard. I don\u2019t know how many people there are in the inner courtyard, but seniors from the inner courtyard rarely come out. There\u2019s also a ranking system in the inner courtyard, causing the competition there to be extremely intense. Despite how intense it is, senior Xiaotao is one of the top ten ranked students inside of the inner courtyard. Her strength is definitely not something that we can compare to. Senior Xu Sanshi seems to have a very good relationship with senior Xiaotao, thus he might get a recommendation from senior Xiaotao to the inner courtyard in the future, if he\u2019s lucky.\u201dWang Dong asked with curiousity, \u201cYou need a recommendation to enter the inner courtyard?\u201dThe upperclassman replied, \u201cThat\u2019s obvious! Well, I\u2019m not entirely clear about the specific procedures one must follow to enter the inner courtyard. Supposedly, every single student from the outer courtyard that wants to enter the inner courtyard must obtain a recommendation from a student from the inner courtyard.\u201dHuo Yuhao was able to finish selling the rest of his fish without a hitch. By the time he was about to sell the last of them, Bei Bei and Tang Ya arrived side-by-side. Huo Yuhao took out the fish that he\u2019d saved for them beforehand to treat them to a few roasted fish.\u201cJunior brother, the freshman assessment is about to start. I\u2019ve just got obtained accurate info: You\u2019ll be registering in the morning, while the assessment will start in the afternoon. You have to prepare well.\u201d Bei Bei\u2019s demeanor was still as gentle as before.Huo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely work hard to pass the assessment.\u201dBei Bei laughed, while Tang Ya said, \u201cLittle Yuhao, even if I\u2019m your teacher, I can\u2019t just eat this many of your roasted fish for free. I\u2019ll give you something nice. You can use it when the time arises.\u201d As she spoke, she handed something that resembled a pouch to Huo Yuhao. \u201cWhen you get back back to your dorm room, store what\u2019s inside in your Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. Make sure to be careful when you\u2019re using it. Don\u2019t hit any vital points. Also, you\u2019ll need to start learning how to refine soul tools after the assessment. At that time, I\u2019ll teach you a few more secret techniques.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Xiao Ya.\u201d Huo Yuhao received the pouch, roughly able to guess what was inside.Wang Dong had a curious look on his face. He proceeded to ask, \u201cTeacher Xiao Ya, I don\u2019t think that you can use soul tools during the freshman assessment, right?\u201dTang Ya unhappily replied, \u201cWhat soul tools? Don\u2019t you know what the Tang Sect is famous for?\u201dWhen Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong returned to their dorm room and opened the pouch, they were shocked. It was filled with hidden weapons. There were throwing knives, throwing needles, Bone Piercing Needles, as well as a dozen plus other types of hidden weapons. Furthermore, there were over a hundred of each of them. It was basically a warehouse for hidden weapons.It was extremely obvious that Tang Ya had prepared these hidden weapons for Huo Yuhao since his martial soul had no way to attack. During these past three months, Huo Yuhao had slightly improved in his understanding of the secret techniques of the Tang Sect, and had even started to skim through the Hidden Weapon Hundred Separations. He was extremely bright and studious, which resulted in him mastering a few techniques. He didn\u2019t have any problems using hidden weapons in a basic fashion. To these new students with only one or two soul rings, these hidden weapons were still a large threat.As Wang Dong gazed at Huo Yuhao\u2019s hidden weapons, he couldn\u2019t help but curl his lips and say, \u201cYour Teacher Xiao Ya is clearly looking down on me. With me there, there won\u2019t even be a need for you to make a move.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Dong\u2019s Radiant Butterfly Goddess was an existence that would always stun everyone whenever it appeared. For him to have a low-profile wouldn\u2019t be easy.A wordless night passed as the two cultivated in silence. The next morning, the two walked over to their school building after eating breakfast. When they entered class, they felt a fervent atmosphere envelop them.Everyone had gathered in their respective groups of three, and were whispering to one another.Xiao Xiao had arrived before the two of them, and thus was already waiting for them. When she saw them enter the classroom, she hurriedly waved towards them.When Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had reacher her, Xiao Xiao said, \u201cThe assessment is going to formally begin this afternoon. Let\u2019s discuss some tactics.\u201dWang Dong unperturbedly said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for us to discuss. Let\u2019s just go and fight.\u201dXiao Xiao softly shook her head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. I\u2019ve heard that every single class has a few especially outstanding students who\u2019ve in turn formed elite teams that are gunning for the champion spot. They won\u2019t be easy to deal with. We have to be well-coordinated to have a chance against them.\u201dWang Dong still wanted to retort, but was cut off by Huo Yuhao. \u201cWang Dong, act properly. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll have to ask Teacher Zhou to change our teams.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear whether or not Xiao Xiao still held a grudge against Wang Dong rejecting her yesterday, but she immediately echoed Huo Yuhao, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Too much over-confidence is simply arrogance.\u201dWang Dong humphed, but no longer spoke.Huo Yuhao put his hand on Wang Dong\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t be angry. If we work together, won\u2019t it be even easier for us to defeat our enemies during the assessment? Let\u2019s discuss the abilities that we specialise in.\u201dEven though they\u2019d been classmates for three months, they\u2019d still only studied together. Cultivation was something that they\u2019d done individually, thus nobody really knew much about anyone else\u2019s martial souls.Huo Yuhao continued, \u201cI\u2019ll start first. I have a spiritual-type martial soul. I can use a skill known as Spiritual Detection Sharing, which can let you detect any movements within a fifty metre diameter in a fairly detailed manner. At the same time, it can also predict an opponent\u2019s movements to a certain extent.\u201dWang Dong said, \u201cI\u2019m an assault system soul master. Short-range and long-range attacks are both okay for me. I\u2019m also able to fly.\u201d Although he was somewhat arrogant, he truly had the qualifications to act as such. Regardless of whether it was his cultivation, his martial soul, or his soul skills, he was an outstanding existence among his peers. The simple fact that his second soul ring was a thousand year one was something that perhaps no one else in the academy could outshine.Xiao Xiao nodded and said, \u201cMy main martial soul is the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. It can both attack and defend, and can control the battlefield to a certain extent. It can also intimidate my enemies by ramming into them, which will cause them to feel dizzy, while getting hurt at the same time. My second martial soul is a flute\u2014the Nine Phoenix Flute. It focuses on auxiliary and control-type abilities. Currently, my second martial soul only has a hundred year soul ring. It can slow down the speed of our enemies during combat.\u201dWang Dong was slightly amazed as he asked, \u201cYour auxiliary-type martial soul doesn\u2019t boost yourself?\u201dXiao Xiao had a proud smile on her face as she replied, \u201cNope. Sometimes, weakening an enemy is better than boosting one\u2019s self. When the time comes, you\u2019ll see what I mean. However, it isn\u2019t that easy for me to use my second martial soul, so it\u2019s better if we hide a bit of our strength and take it slow.\u201dBoth Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong suddenly realized something\u2014Xiao Xiao might be even stronger than they thought.What they didn\u2019t know was that, when Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao worked together to control the battlefield, they would explode out with a frightening amount of control.\u201cThump, thump, thump.\u201d Three rapping sounds rang out. When the class heard that, it immediately became so quiet you could hear a pin drop.Zhou Yi stood at the entrance to the classroom, her right hand just coming back down to her side. The rapping sound had been from her rapping on the door to the classroom.Zhou Yi still maintained her ice-cold composure as she slowly walked up to the platform. \u201cI\u2019ve already reported the list of teams that are partaking in the competition later. The competition will formally start this afternoon. It will use a round-robin system, and you won\u2019t meet each other during the ten matches that you\u2019ll be competing in, only teams from other classes. I only have one line of advice for you: If anyone tries to stop you from passing the assessment, beat the shit out of them. That\u2019s it, you can all disperse. We\u2019ll gather at the assessment area this afternoon.\u201d When Zhou Yi had finished speaking, she hard-headedly turned around and walked away.Wang Dong spoke in a low voice to Huo Yuhao. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that old lady Zhou is becoming cooler and cooler?\u201dHuo Yuhao glanced at him and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t being cool; she\u2019s being completely domineering.\u201dXiao Xiao walked over and giggled. \u201cTeacher Zhou\u2019s just giving off a strong presence. Let\u2019s go and find a place to train together for a while. If we don\u2019t, how will we coordinate later?\u2019Without waiting for Wang Dong to speak, Huo Yuhao immediately nodded his head in agreement. \u201cStudent Wang Dong, if you ever want to eat roasted fish next time, I have to request that you to listen to every command of the current class monitor during the freshman assessment. Do you agree to these terms?\u201d\u201cUrgh\u2026\u201d Wang Dong looked at Huo Yuhao\u2019s resolute gaze, then said with an indignant expression on his face, \u201cHuo Yuhao, you\u2019re really taking advantage of my fear.\u201dHuo Yuhao calmly replied, \u201cYou can choose not to eat them.\u201dWang Dong hesitated for a moment, but still relented in the end. \u201cI surrender. I\u2019ll listen to you. However, you\u2019re in charge of the hygiene in the dorm room from now on.\u201dHuo Yuhao had a look of disdain on his face as he said, \u201cHave you cleaned the room at all during these past three months?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Dong felt speechless as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a fierce one, aren\u2019t you?\u201dXiao Xiao seemed to be standing completely on Huo Yuhao\u2019s side as she giggled. \u201cLaziness is a type of sin.\u201dWang Dong suddenly blurted out a few words, causing the young Xiao Xiao to immediately blush. \u201cXiao Xiao, the target of your affection really changes fast!\u201d\u201cYou\u2014!\u201d Xiao Xiao pointed her finger at Wang Dong with a look of anger on her face. She even looked as if she had been wronged.\u201cOkay, okay. Didn\u2019t we say that we were going to train? Let\u2019s hurry up and do so. I think that we should head outside the academy. There are tons of trees outside the academy, thus we won\u2019t be easily disturbed by the others.\u201dWang Dong stuck his tongue out at Xiao Xiao, then turned around to leave. Only after Huo Yuhao had given Xiao Xiao a few words of consolation, did she become happy. Afterwards, the two chased after Wang Dong, following the lakeside path as they left the academy.Looking for a quiet place outside Shrek Academy couldn\u2019t be any easier for them. Although there were several roads, there was a large amount of vegetation that covered both sides of the main road. Some of it was naturally grown, while some of it had been planted by hand.After the three had found a relatively flat area in the forest, Wang Dong asked, \u201cHow\u2019re we going to train? Are we just going to use our soul skills once?\u201dXiao Xiao immediately refuted him, \u201cHow would that be useful? You naturally need to have a fight for training to be the most effective. You\u2019re an assault system soul master, so you can be on one side, while the class monitor and I will be on the other side. Let\u2019s have a match.\u201d\u201cYou two against me?\u201d Wang Dong raised his right hand, wagging his forefinger as he said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. With just the two of you, you won\u2019t have a chance against me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, you\u2019re an assault system soul master, so you can\u2019t be right next to us when the battle starts. Let\u2019s spread out a bit. Let\u2019s say\u2026 thirty metres.\u201dAs Huo Yuhao listened to the two\u2019s argument, he gradually discovered how clever Xiao Xiao was. His Spiritual Detection Sharing had a fifty metre diameter, thus for Xiao Xiao to ask for Wang Dong to start off thirty metres away was equivalent to having him enter the range of his Spiritual Detection the instant he made a move.Wang Dong agreed without any hesitation at all.Xiao Xiao then said, \u201cYou can fly, but we can\u2019t. This is a training session, so you\u2019d better not fly away once you start losing.\u201dWang Dong replied in a very casual manner. \u201cI won\u2019t leave the ground by more than five metres. Then, I\u2019ll be heading over. You can shout \u2018start\u2019 when you guys are ready.\u201d When he\u2019d finished speaking, he began to walk away.Xiao Xiao immediately turned towards Huo Yuhao and said, \u201cClass monitor, let\u2019s kite this fool. It\u2019ll be fine if you just use your Spiritual Detection Sharing to support me. Let\u2019s make that arrogant guy eat a loss.\u201dIf this had been before Huo Yuhao had come to Shrek Academy, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have known what \u2018kiting\u2019 was. However, he was extremely clear about what it was now\u2014it was a tactic that relied on retreating as one fought.Huo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d He also wanted to see just how strong Xiao Xiao and Wang Dong were. During the past three months, he hadn\u2019t ever been able to see exactly how strong Wang Dong truly was when he used his martial soul to fight. However, he understood that even though Wang Dong was slightly more arrogant than others, he was just being self-confident, not arrogant. This was because self-confidence came from strength.The distance between the two sides quickly grew larger. Wang Dong lazily leaned against a large tree and gazed at the two that were thirty metres away from him\u2014he\u2019d even increased the distance between them a bit. He raised his arm and waved at Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao, indicating that he was ready.Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao stood next to each other. Xiao Xiao had a petite body, and was rather short compared to the rest of the class. She even had the title of \u2018pocket-sized beauty\u2019. She glanced at Huo Yuhao and nodded. \u201cClass monitor, please assist me.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOnly then did Xiao Xiao turn around and shout towards Wang Dong, \u201cStart!\u201d As soon as she spoke, she released her martial soul.Two yellow lights simultaneously lit up as soon as they rose from Xiao Xiao\u2019s feet; she was actually a Soul Grandmaster! When Huo Yuhao saw this, he inwardly blushed from shame.The two shining soul rings rose from Xiao Xiao\u2019s feet, but nothing seemed to happen to her body. However, a black shadow rapidly condensed above her head, clearly forming a three-legged cauldron that had two handles and a diameter of around one metre. This was Xiao Xiao\u2019s main martial soul, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.Huo Yuhao activated his Spiritual Detection Sharing at the same time, causing a white soul ring to rise up from his feet. The onlooking Xiao Xiao couldn\u2019t help but find it somewhat weak. She thought to herself, \u201cNo wonder the class monitor cultivates as hard as he does; his talent\u2019s really lacking!\u201dHowever, Xiao Xiao was quickly shocked by the mysterious scene that Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing showed her.Everything within a twenty-five metre diameter of them instantly became three-dimensional figures within her mind. She basically didn\u2019t even have to think about them either\u2014information about them rapidly appeared inside of her mind. She could even clearly sense the existence of every single strand of grass and bit of vegetation within the area that was surrounding them. Furthermore, besides the three-dimensional panoramic view that she\u2019d suddenly received, she felt as if she suddenly had an extra brain that could help her process the new information that she was receiving.As Xiao Xiao glanced at Huo Yuhao, astonished, Wang Dong had already begun to make his move.Although Wang Dong seemed to be looking down on Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao on the surface, he wasn\u2019t being careless at all. He\u2019d personally experienced Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing, so he was fully aware of the fact that it could predict an opponent\u2019s movements.A dazzling pair of blue wings instantly spread out from his back, causing Wang Dong\u2019s body to also be covered in an exotic colour that seemed to constantly change between blue and purple. Furthermore, a few golden balls of light appeared on his enormous pair of wings and lit up, forming a \u2018V\u2019. As his two soul rings rose up from his feet, one yellow and one purple, his Radiant Butterfly Goddess was fully released.With a flash, Wang Dong rushed out at high speed. The balls of light on his wings began to emit soulforce, which caused his speed to instantly reach an extreme level.This wasn\u2019t a soul skill, but an innate skill that belonged to his Radiant Butterfly Goddess. From this alone, it could be seen how strong his martial soul was.Wang Dong\u2019s sudden increase in speed caused him to instantly cross a distance of ten or so metres; he had already nearly arrived in front of Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao. The result of an assault system soul master approaching two control system soul masters who had no means of engaging him in close-combat could be imagined. Their defeat seemed to be inevitable.When Wang Dong was only twenty-five metres away from Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao, a digital representation of his movements instantly appeared in Xiao Xiao\u2019s brain. This included the trajectory of his movements, the minute changes in his body, the smallest changes in his martial soul\u2026 even the rotation of Wang Dong\u2019s soulforce within his meridians could be faintly examined by Xiao Xiao.Xiao Xiao didn\u2019t look flustered at all. Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul ring, which was only a ten year soul ring, had already surprised her immensely. As she watched Wang Dong approach them, she decided to make a move too.She pointed her right hand towards Wang Dong, causing the one-metre wide cauldron above her to charge forwards. It didn\u2019t head straight towards Wang Dong, but towards the only path that he could take. Furthermore, she similarly used an innate skill that belonged to her martial soul: she delayed the use of her soul skill.Wang Dong was put into an extremely difficult position due to the position of the enormous black cauldron, as it was currently flying directly towards the only path that he could take. This was definitely a clever application of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing, no doubt. If not for Huo Yuhao\u2019s help, Xiao Xiao would have had to rely on her eyesight and the fluctuations in Wang Dong\u2019s soulforce to make a judgement, which definitely wouldn\u2019t have been as accurate as right now.In this moment of helplessness, Wang Dong suddenly contracted his left wing. This allowed his body to twist slightly in midair, slightly changing his trajectory. However, he became even more depressed when the black cauldron instantly shifted, allowing it to continue blocking him.Foresight.Xiao Xiao subconsciously turned to glance at the golden-eyed Huo Yuhao. With his Spiritual Detection Sharing, she didn\u2019t even need to look at Wang Dong. She only needed to follow the instructions of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing to continue her attacks. This couldn\u2019t be any easier for her.However, Wang Dong wouldn\u2019t simply admit defeat; he continued to flap his wings as he soared through the air, increasing his speed by several times. Despite this, Huo Yuhao was still able to sense the rotation of his soulforce via his Spiritual Detection, thus he was able to consistently predict his movements. For him to attempt to avoid Xiao Xiao\u2019s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron while it was under her control clearly wasn\u2019t realistic.Wang Dong felt depressed. He couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cHuo Yuhao, you\u2019re inhumane! Fine, I won\u2019t dodge\u2014I\u2019ll force my way in!\u201dHis first soul ring suddenly lit up as he spoke, while the golden light in Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up as well. With his Spiritual Detection, he could clearly sense that the soulforce within Wang Dong\u2019s body was rotating in an explosive manner, surging madly into his front pair of wings. On the other hand, his rear wings had been spread out for the sole sake of maintaining his balance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 17.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17.3: First Time Cooperating; Two People Control the BattlefieldHis front pair of wings turned completely azure, the golden patterns on them releasing a golden light that spread outward, instantly forming a three-inch wide sharp golden edge on his front wings.The look on Xiao Xiao\u2019s face changed slightly. Via Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing, she could clearly sense the astonishing destructive power that was currently contained within Wang Dong\u2019s wings after he used this soul skill.Wang Dong simultaneously raised his hands, grabbing the inner part of his front wings. With a sudden pull, his front pair of wings immediately unfurled, resembling two guillotines with golden edges. He then twisted his body, causing his right wing to slash towards the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. It was just as he\u2019d said: If a soft method wouldn\u2019t work, he\u2019d have to use a hard one!However, he\u2019d still underestimated the level of coordination that Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao shared, who were both working together to control the battlefield. Xiao Xiao didn\u2019t have her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron forcefully take the hit that Wang Dong has sent at it, instead choosing to have it two metres. This allowed it to perfectly dodge the slash made by Wang Dong\u2019s right wing, before suddenly ramming into his wing.A loud \u2018bang\u2019 rang out from their collision, and Wang Dong\u2019s body was sent flying several tens of metres away. On the other hand, Xiao Xiao\u2019s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron remained hovering in midair.Wang Dong truly felt depressed by this. His strength absolutely exceeded Xiao Xiao\u2019s, but he hadn\u2019t been able to display any of it whilst facing the combined forces of Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. This time, he decided to retreat instead of advancing. With a flash, he moved more than twenty-five metres away from Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao, naturally meaning that he\u2019d escaped the range of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing.\u201cHehe, Huo Yuhao, I want see how you\u2019ll detect the my body\u2019s condition now. This brother has long-range attacks too.\u201d As he spoke, his second soul ring lit up.Huo Yuhao smiled slightly and said, \u201cHave you forgotten? I can also manipulate the direction of my Spiritual Detection. As of right now, I can send it out around a hundred metres. If your attack can lock onto us from over a hundred metres away, you can try using it. And even if it can, there\u2019ll still be enough time for me to help Xiao Xiao take it on when your attack enters the range of my Spiritual Detection, unless the strength of your attack can shatter Xiao Xiao\u2019s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. And besides that, you shouldn\u2019t forget that Xiao Xiao still has her second martial soul.\u201dWang Dong was stunned. Right! Even though his second soul skill was a thousand year one, and was relatively strong compared, its might would still be greatly reduced after it had crossed a hundred metres. Besides, Huo Yuhao truly would have enough time to help Xiao Xiao take it on. However, he still wasn\u2019t willing to concede to them. \u201cMy long-range attack is an AoE attack. Even if you can detect it, it won\u2019t be of any use.\u201dXiao Xiao smiled. \u201cWang Dong, don\u2019t be so proud of yourself. Don\u2019t forget, I still have multiple soul skills that I haven\u2019t used. Would you like to know what soul skills my Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron has? To be honest, you might not be my match, even if this were a one-on-one fight. As for your long-range attack, it might have an extraordinary amount of strength, but all the class monitor and I need is enough time to dodge it. Just wait and see.\u201dWhilst speaking, she pointed at the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron with her right hand, causing it to suddenly tremble slightly. Immediately after that, it unexpectedly split into three smaller cauldrons that surrounded her and Huo Yuhao, forming a tripartite formation. At the same time, Xiao Xiao\u2019s first soul ring lit up.A loud rumbling echoed out as the ten square metres of air above the two of them twisted due to a violent vibration.The three cauldrons then merged back into one and quietly landed in front of Xiao Xiao.Huo Yuhao\u2019s and Wang Dong\u2019s expressions changed. What a strong martial soul! When the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron had split into three parts, that was an innate skill that belonged to it. However, that tremor was definitely its attack. Huo Yuhao had clearly been able to sense the terrifying might of that tremor via his Spiritual Sense.Wang Dong quickly regained his composure. \u201cI get it, I won\u2019t fight anymore. If the two of you team up, it\u2019s true that I can\u2019t beat you. But Xiao Xiao, in the future, you\u2019ll definitely learn that you\u2019re not my match in a one-on-one fight. On the other hand, if two people around the same level of cultivation fight against one another, the side that has Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection will definitely win. That skill of his doesn\u2019t give anyone a way out at all. You\u2019ll be left in a passive state throughout the entire battle, unless someone with an exceedingly high cultivation uses absolute power to crush him.\u201dAlthough Xiao Xiao wasn\u2019t willing to accept Wang Dong saying that he could beat her in a one-on-one fight, she had to acknowledge what else he\u2019d said. She nodded and said, \u201cYeah! With the class monitor\u2019s Spiritual Detection, fighting is as simple as just using my soul skills. Class monitor, your soul skill is super strong. It feels great teaming up with you! I even underestimated your ten year soul ring, sorry!\u201d Xiao Xiao was a girl who had a very straightforward attitude; she said whatever she was thinking about without beating around the bush. Due to this, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong immediately had a favourable opinion of her.Huo Yuhao extended his right hand horizontally towards Xiao Xiao, who responded with a sweet smile, before placing her right hand on top of his. Finally, Wang Dong walked over and placed his right hand on the very top.Huo Yuhao then said, \u201cFrom now on, we\u2019re comrades on the same team. As for the freshmen examination, we want to be champions.\u201d\u201cWe want to be champions!\u201d The three simultaneously shouted. At this moment, the relationship between them had deepened further. The happiest person of the three was naturally Xiao Xiao; she finally felt as if Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had sincerely accepted her as one of their friends. Because of this, it was always said that, between soul masters, speaking with one\u2019s fists was always the simplest, most direct, and most effective way to do things.Shrek Academy\u2019s assessment area was located at the north-central part of the Martial Soul Department, and was adjacent to the Soul Duelling Area. However, the Examination Area was much larger than the Soul Duelling Area. To the outer courtyard students, this was a paradise for outstanding students, where they could display their abilities, but was a nightmare for weaker students. There would always be a large number of students expelled after failing their assessment every year. A large majority of the assessments would be held in this Examination Area.The Examination Area was oval-shaped. Unlike the Soul Duelling Area, which was enclosed, the Examination Area was basically an open field. It was only encircled by short walls, while inside it was separated into many small areas by partitions. These partitions could be moved at any time to alter the size of the Examination Area.The Examination Area would always be divided the most whenever the freshman assessment happened. It wasn\u2019t just because of the large number of new students, but also because there was still a limit to the destructive power and attack range that new students had. Because of this, they didn\u2019t need too large of an area to allow them to fully display their abilities.The Examination Area was roughly twenty-thousand square metres large, but was currently separated into fifty areas. Every single partitioned area was around four hundred square metres in size, and was a twenty by twenty metre square. This was already sufficient for new students, who generally only had one or two soul rings.After the intense division of groups in the morning, the assessment formally started in the afternoon. Because this was the first day of the assessment, all of the teams could leave after finishing only one match. This was done for the sake of letting the new students adapt, at least somewhat, to the schedule. The academy had stationed a teacher in each of the fifty areas in order to complete the registration process for the assessment. The lot drawing for today\u2019s matches had already been done that afternoon, and the academy did all they could to ensure that no teams from the same class would meet each other during the ten-match round robin tournament.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 17.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17.4: First Time Cooperating; Two People Control the BattlefieldOther than Class 1, which only had twenty-two teams, the other classes generally had at least thirty teams. Unless there were students that had performed extremely poorly during their first three months at Shrek Academy, teachers in charge of the freshmen classes would generally always give them a chance to take the freshman assessment.There were a total of three hundred and ten teams participating in the freshmen assessment, which meant a total of nine hundred and thirty people. Out of these three hundred and ten teams of students, only a hundred and fifty of them would be able to remain and formally become first-year students to continue studying. The rest of the teams would be eliminated.Whilst studying in Shrek Academy, the competition was undoubtedly fierce and cruel. However, this also resulted in students working even harder under this intense atmosphere, allowing them to stimulate even more of their potential. This had, in turn, allowed Shrek Academy to survive ten thousand years without becoming weak at all.There were a total of fifty arenas for the freshmen assessment, which meant that every single arena would have six or seven teams within it. It wasn\u2019t just today; they would also compete with other teams from the same arena tomorrow, up until they\u2019d finished competing with all the teams in the same arena as them. Afterwards, the winners would be redistributed into new groups, allowing them to finish their ten-round competition.Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three was assigned to the 33rd arena. After the three ate lunch, they returned to their respective dorm rooms in order to meditate for a while, then met back up when it was time to. The arenas with the Examination Area were extremely easy to look for, since each arena was quite obviously labeled. They managed to find which arena they were supposed to be in quite quickly.The students from the other classes who were also meant to be in the area had already arrived. Some of them looked nervous, while some of them seemed eager to begin. All of them were only kids, around eleven or twelve years old, so they couldn\u2019t really conceal their thoughts. When they looked at each other, their eyes clearly exposed the hostility they had for one another. After all, only half of them would continue to remain within Shrek Academy. Even though the freshmen assessment only had a total of ten rounds, every single round would affect their future.\u201cNew students, please pay attention. New students, please pay attention. Please immediately enter the Examination Area to participate in the freshmen assessment. There are still ten minutes left for you to enter. Any students that are late will automatically forfeit their assessment.\u201dThe booming voice from the loudspeaker rang throughout the entire academy; it was loud enough to travel through every nook and corner of the academy. At this moment, most students\u2019 expressions became quite serious. Everyone\u2019s first match was about to begin; they\u2019d be lying if they said that they weren\u2019t nervous.Huo Yuhao unconsciously clenched his fists, then felt the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges on his waist for reassurance. The freshman assessment prohibited the usage of soul tools, but hidden weapons were still classified as ordinary weapons, which weren\u2019t prohibited. Soul masters would rarely use any weapons, unless they were soul tools. However, as a disciple of the Tang Sect, Huo Yuhao was clearly an exception to this rule.Wang Dong placed his left hand on Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulder and leaned towards him. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, this will be trivial to us.\u201dXiao Xiao didn\u2019t call Wang Dong out for being arrogant this time. Instead, she nodded towards Huo Yuhao. Although Wang Dong hadn\u2019t been able to show off his full power when the three of them had fought earlier, she had still been able to see that his cultivation wasn\u2019t any lower than that hers, based on the resolute words he spoke at the very end. Combined with the class monitor\u2019s mystical Spiritual Detection Sharing, there were an extremely small number of students within their age group who could be their opponents.Huo Yuhao whispered, \u201cWe\u2019ll be the champions.\u201dXiao Xiao and Wang Dong simultaneously nodded. The three then placed their palms above each other\u2019s once again. Although they were young, they knew one thing: Although simply passing the assessment might not be that hard for them, if they wanted to become champions of the assessment, teamwork would be key. Because of that, even Wang Dong restrained his pride.The freshmen assessment was extremely important, so the academy\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t really that useful. All of the freshmen had already arrived at their designated arenas in order to make preparations for the upcoming assessment.A teacher that looked to be around forty walked into the 33rd Area. He looked like an extremely average person; he didn\u2019t give off any sort of threatening aura. He had a smile on his face, as well as an extremely friendly appearance. As such, he was as different as heaven and earth when compared to Zhou Yi. After counting the number of people present, he smiled slightly. \u201cVery good. We have a total of six teams participating in the freshmen assessment today, and it seems that you\u2019re all present. Allow me to introduce myself first. I\u2019m Wang Yan, and I\u2019ll be your proctor for the next two days.\u201cGreetings, Teacher Wang.\u201d The students hurriedly bowed in respect.Wang Yan chuckled. \u201cNo need to be so polite. I\u2019ve always treated everyone as a friend while I\u2019m teaching, and from now until the end of our time together, you\u2019ll all be my little friends. As such, I don\u2019t wish to see anyone get hurt. Although this assessment determines whether or not you can continue to study in Shrek Academy, I have to remind you that this is still only an assessment. You absolutely mustn\u2019t hurt your opponents too badly. If that happens, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to ask him to leave and report the incident to the Academy.\u201dHe spoke with a very gentle tone and downplayed the entire matter. Although he didn\u2019t mention the consequences for crippling one\u2019s opponent, every single student that was able to enter Shrek Academy was a child prodigy. They naturally understood the implications behind his words, and nodded to express their understanding.Wang Yan smiled. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, we can start now. If we end earlier, you can go back early to train for tomorrow. A slight sense of urgency is definitely a good thing for you youngsters.\u201dAs he spoke, he took out a sheet of paper and glanced over it. Afterwards, he raised his head and said, \u201cFor the first match of the first round of the freshmen assessment\u2014Class 1: Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, Xiao Xiao. Class 3: Ouyang Junyi, Chen Junfeng, Zhao Haochen. The six of you can enter the battlefield and take your sides. When I announce the start of the battle, you can release your martial souls. Enter.\u201dThere were six teams of students, thus three matches would be held within the 33rd arena today. However, Huo Yuhao never thought that they would be the first team to go out. The three of them glanced at each other, then quickly walked towards the northwestern corner of the arena.The three of them positioned themselves quite carefully. Wang Dong stood in front, while Xiao Xiao stood behind him. Huo Yuhao, on the other hand, stood behind both of them, in the the corner of the arena. As for the the other team of three, they naturally chose to stand at the southeastern corner of the arena.The three students from Class 3 were all boys\u2014they even looked quite handsome. The tallest person of the three was Ouyang Junyi, who was also the most handsome of the three. Although there was still a gap between him and Wang Dong, his body looked much sturdier than Wang Dong\u2019s. The person next to him, Chen Junfeng, was extremely slender, even though he wasn\u2019t that tall. Finally, Zhao Haochen was a little fatty who had a plump stomach, as well as a straightforward smile on his face.Seeing that both parties were in position, Wang Yan nodded. \u201cStart the assessment.\u201dThe two parties instantly released their martial souls. Although Huo Yuhao was standing in the corner, with his meticulous control, he was able to prevent his Spiritual Detection Sharing from covering what was behind him. Instead, he merely covered the arena in front of him with his Spiritual Detection Sharing. Xiao Xiao also released her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, causing an enormous black cauldron to rapidly form in midair.Wang Dong\u2019s movements were even more direct. With a flash, he charged straight into the air, his pair of dazzling blue and purple wings already unfurled. A brilliant golden pattern traced them. No matter whether it was his opponents, or their proctor Wang Yan, they were all astonished by his beautiful pair of wings. His wings were simply too beautiful! It was even to the extent that Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao\u2019s limelight was completely overshadowed.Their three opponents had already made their preparations; they had released their martial souls the instant the battle had started.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 18.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18.1: The 33rd Arena\u20143v3Zhao Haochen, who was standing at the very back of his team, shouted, \u201cCome quickly, my drumsticks!\u201d The ripples of a yellow soul ring appeared from beneath his feet and rose up, causing two sparkling yellow lights to appear in his hands. Two braised chicken drumsticks suddenly appeared in his hands, which he quickly passed to the two people in front of him.While releasing their martial souls, Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng rapidly grabbed the drumsticks from Zhao Haochen and forcefully took large bites from them.A food system martial soul? This was Huo Yuhao\u2019s first time seeing a food system martial soul; he didn\u2019t have any idea what the drumsticks that Zhao Haochen had summoned could do. Even though Zhao Haochen only had a single soul ring, it was still a hundred year one, so it\u2019s strengthening effects were presumably good. However, Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng\u2019s respective appearances whilst eating the drumsticks that had been summoned were somewhat odd, to the extent that Xiao Xiao couldn\u2019t help but laugh. The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron still remained hovering above her head without any intention of making a move at all.Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng made their moves at the same time. Of the two, one of them had a beast martial soul, while the other had a tool martial soul. However they were both agility system soul masters.Ouyang Junyi\u2019s martial soul was the Sword-beak Hummingbird. When he released his martial soul, a sharp stinger rapidly appeared on his right forearm. His martial soul was a bird-type one, but he didn\u2019t have wings due to his current cultivation level. This alone demonstrated the gap between his and Wang Dong\u2019s martial souls. Wang Dong\u2019s Radiant Butterfly Goddess innately had wings, which was the sign of a peak-level beast martial soul.Chen Junfeng\u2019s martial soul was a flexible sword, making all three of them one-ringed soul masters. However, they all possessed hundred year soul rings. Ouyang Junyi was the strongest of the three\u2014his cultivation had already reached the nineteenth rank. Chen Junfeng, on the other hand, had reached the eighteenth rank. As for Zhao Haochen, considering the fact that he was a food system soul master, his cultivation speed was relatively slower. Hence, his cultivation had only reached the seventeenth rank.As soon as the two agility system soul masters of the opposing team finished their drumsticks, they proceeded to pounce towards Wang Dong like arrows released from a bowstring; their speed was so quick that even Wang Dong was astonished. However, he instantly understood that the drumsticks they\u2019d just finished were the cause for their increase their speed!Zhou Yi wasn\u2019t the only teacher who\u2019d divided her students into teams; other teachers had also done it. With Zhao Haochen supporting Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng, their advantage in terms of speed was undoubtedly unleashed to its fullest potential, allowing them to use speed alone to achieve victory.Unfortunately for them, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three feared speed-type opponents the least, as Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing could subdue them completely.A faint golden light appeared within Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes, causing a three-dimensional image of the entire battlefield to appear in Wang Dong\u2019s mind. Although Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng were extremely quick, the trajectory of their movements, the rotation of their soulforce, the direction of their attacks, and even their flaws appeared simultaneously in Wang Dong\u2019s mind.Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng were very well-versed towards focusing on a single target, so when Wang Dong charged towards them by himself, it was exactly what they wanted. With a sudden explosion in speed, they were extremely confident that neither Huo Yuhao nor Xiao Xiao would be able to rescue him in time. Taking care of Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao after defeating Wang Dong could also be considered a form of dividing and conquering.Besides the sharp stinger on his forearm, Ouyang Junyi\u2019s entire right arm had also been covered in a layer of feathers. His body became extremely lithe, and even though he and Chen Junfeng were both agility system soul masters, he was quicker than Chen Junfeng. The yellow soul ring below his body flashed, causing the stinger on his forearm to instantly turn into several tens of shadows that immediately rushed towards Wang Dong.Although Chen Junfeng was a bit slower than Ouyang Junyi, this clearly wasn\u2019t the first time that they\u2019d teamed up. Before he even arrived, he swung the short-sword he was holding, causing his first soul ring to light up. A sword-beam shot out from his sword towards Wang Dong.However, before the two even made their moves, the golden pattern imprinted on Wang Dong\u2019s wings had already started to spread as he activated his first soul ring as well. His arms merged with his frontal wings, causing his Wing Guillotine skill that Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao had seen before to appear again.Since he was in midair, Wang Dong was in a much better position than Ouyang Junyi and Chen Junfeng. A hint of arrogance appeared on his face\u2014as if he were loftily looking down on the two of them. As he faced their attacks, Wang Dong swept his left wing out, directly meeting Ouyang Junyi\u2019s Sword-beak Hummingbird. Whilst he was did this, his right wing directly slashed outwards, hitting Chen Junfeng\u2019s sword light first, even though it was released second. Wang Dong\u2019s positioning as he unleashed his attacks wasn\u2019t lacking in the least.\u201cChi chi chi chi chi\u2026\u201d A series of sounds rang out. To his astonishment, Ouyang Junyi discovered that his Sword-beak Hummingbird\u2019s first soul skill\u2014Hummingbird Flash-sting\u2014had only been able to cause a few halos of light to appear on Wang Dong\u2019s Radiant Butterfly Goddess\u2019 front wings. Even with the level of sharpness that his Sword-beak Hummingbird possessed, it had actually been unable to break through the strength of Wang Dong\u2019s wings. Following that, Wang Dong\u2019s enormous wings swept straight towards his face.Ouyang Junyi could be considered to have at least a little bit of combat experience. He instantly crouched downwards in an attempt to dodge Wang Dong\u2019s hit from below. However, who could\u2019ve guessed that Wang Dong would suddenly swing his wings directly downwards and make it seem as if Ouyang Junyi had specifically kneeled down in order to be slapped by Wang Dong. With a thump, Ouyang Junyi was slapped face-first into the ground. Furthermore, the enormous force that slammed into his back nearly caused him to vomit up some blood.Chen Junfeng was inferior to Ouyang Junyi in strength as well. When the sword light he\u2019d released collided with the sharp edge of Wang Dong\u2019s Wing Guillotine, Chen Junfeng only saw a flash of gold before his sword light was crushed. Following that, a violent buzz echoed out from his short-sword as it shattered. He only saw a golden blue light flash in front of his eyes before he was sent flying with a speed even greater than the speed he\u2019d had whilst running towards Wang Dong. Afterwards, he collided with Zhao Haochen, who was still nibbling on a drumstick, causing the two of them to instantly roll head-over-heels over the ground.Wang Dong spread his wings out in midair, causing blue and violet lights to glitter back and forth across his wings. The golden pattern on his wings slowly vanished as he casually landed, and he maintained the arrogant look on his face that hadn\u2019t disappeared since the battle started.The onlooking teacher, Wang Yan, had a brilliant look in his eyes, while the faces of the other terms sank after watching the match. The entire 33rd Area was dead silent.He was too strong; he was a terrifying assault system soul master!Assault system soul masters could naturally suppress agility system soul masters to a certain extent, but everyone present was a new student! How large could the difference between them be? Wang Dong had actually been able to defeat two agility system soul masters by himself\u2014and this was a food system soul master supporting them!Although a two-ringed soul master had an enormous advantage over a one-ringed soul master, he had still been able to beat three opponents within mere seconds. From this alone, one could imagine how tyrannical this soul master\u2014who possessed the Radiant Butterfly Goddess\u2014was.Furthermore, there was still another person who also possessed two soul rings just like Wang Dong in their team. This team had two soul masters that were above the twentieth rank! As for Huo Yuhao, he was completely overlooked by everyone present; only Teacher Wang Yan had faintly noticed the golden light that had flickered in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, don\u2019t forget that he had the assistance of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing, which was equivalent to a six hundred year soul ring!Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing wasn\u2019t a single skill after all; it provided assistance equivalent to two six hundred year soul rings. The help that Wang Dong had received from Huo Yuhao vastly exceeded the support that his opponents had received from their food system soul master.Furthermore, Wang Dong also had a hundred year soul ring as his first soul ring, while his soulforce had already reached the twenty-fourth rank; his cultivation tremendously outstripped that of his opponent\u2019s.After withdrawing his wings, Wang Dong walked back to Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao and high-fived them in celebration. Xiao Xiao smiled. \u201cOur class monitor is awesome. Wang Dong, how about you let me enjoy myself next time?\u201d She was confident that, if she was the one who\u2019d gone out, she would\u2019ve also been able to defeat her opponents. The more she felt that Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection was magical, the more she found herself entranced by it. Thus, the person she praised wasn\u2019t Wang Dong, but Huo Yuhao.Wang Dong chortled. \u201cDon\u2019t! Keep your strength hidden. These ten matches are merely appetisers to the three of us. It\u2019s enough for just me to show off. We can\u2019t let the other teams get a feel for our strength.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled. \u201cWang Dong makes a good point. Xiao Xiao, you\u2019ll be our trump card.\u201dXiao Xiao also laughed when she heard their words and nodded in agreement.\u201cClass 1\u2019s \u2018Team Huo Yuhao\u2019 wins their first match.\u201d After Wang Yan had announced the results of the match, he noted it down on the previous sheet of paper he\u2019d pulled out.On the other side, Ouyang Junyi\u2019s team of three had already managed to crawl back to their feet. Wang Dong had been lenient on them, so they hadn\u2019t suffered any real injuries. However, they had a look of embarrassment on their faces. They didn\u2019t want to remain for even one more second after letting everyone see how easily they\u2019d been defeated. Hence, they quickly ran away.After Wang Yan had recorded the results of the match, he glanced back towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three. He inwardly thought, I reckon that this is Class 1\u2019s trump card. The students that Teacher Zhou Yi has taught are extraordinary, as expected!However, he still couldn\u2019t figure out Huo Yuhao. Unlike the students, he was clearly able to understand the subtleties behind each team when they registered.The name of this team from Class 1 was \u2018Team Huo Yuhao\u2019. In other words, Huo Yuhao was the leader of this team. However, if you looked at it from the perspective of their cultivation levels, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao both outstripped him. To put it bluntly, with Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul ring that was only of the ten year rank, as well as his cultivation that hadn\u2019t yet broken through to the twentieth rank, he shouldn\u2019t even have the qualifications to enter Shrek Academy.Despite all of this, he was the leader of their team. That is to say, this student\u2014who had a ten year soul ring\u2014was the core of this team. Just why was this the case?Wang Yan was a representative from the moderate faction of Shrek Academy\u2019s theoretical school of thought. He had a large amount of knowledge on theory, while his ability to teach was extremely strong. Even though he was only forty or so years old, he was a highly ranked teacher that was second to none in the outer courtyard.Obtaining a promotion as a teacher within Shrek Academy was even more difficult than obtaining one as a student. This was extremely obvious, as shown by Zhou Yi only being a middle-ranked teacher. This was naturally related to her terrifying teaching methods. On the other hand, Wang Yan was someone who could become a high-ranked teacher, and was someone who had the qualifications to teach inner courtyard students. From this, it could clearly be seen how strong he was in the field of theoretical knowledge. However, even he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on with Huo Yuhao\u2019s team, so much so that he couldn\u2019t even tell what kind of soul master Huo Yuhao was.Although they\u2019d finished their assessment for the day, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three didn\u2019t leave. Instead, they stayed behind to observe the other two matches. They waited until the other matches had finished before bidding farewell to Wang Yan.Wang Yan didn\u2019t ask Huo Yuhao anything in the end. He believed that he\u2019d definitely see Huo Yuhao\u2019s abilities in the following matches.The first round of the freshmen assessment quickly finished. The purpose of today\u2019s assessment was more or less to allow the participating students to adapt to the assessment. However, tomorrow\u2019s assessment would be much more challenging. The students would have to undergo two rounds of assessments in both the morning and the afternoon, totalling four rounds for the day. The third day, on the other hand, would be even more terrifying: All of the teams that were left would have to undergo five rounds that day, as the duration of the freshmen assessment was only three days long.This assessment didn\u2019t just train students in combat, but also in their ability to fight a prolonged battle.When the second day of the assessment started, the students from Class 1 began to feel grateful for Teacher Zhou Yi. Fighting four matches in a single day wasn\u2019t just a problem of soulforce consumption; the drain on their physical strength was extremely serious as well. After undergoing Zhou Yi\u2019s hell-like training, the students from Class 1 clearly had a better ability to endure the physical drain from the constant battling than the students from the other classes.After the match they\u2019d fought on the first day, as well as the observations they\u2019d made afterwards, Huo Yuhao was one-hundred percent certain that there were no opponents in their group capable of threatening them. Other than them, there was only a single student above the twentieth rank of soulforce.The students from the other teams weren\u2019t idiots either. Being under such intense conditions, they directly forfeited when they faced Huo Yuhao\u2019s team in order to achieve better results later on.Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was in much better condition compared to the exhausted students of the other teams. Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three easily managed to achieve victory in all four of their matches, thereby obtaining a perfect result of five victories in five matches. With these results as a \u2018safety net\u2019, they\u2019d basically passed the freshmen assessment already. Furthermore, these five victories caused them to be filled with confidence.On the other hand, Wang Yan felt somewhat depressed as the proctor of the 33rd arena. Five matches had passed, yet Huo Yuhao\u2019s team had fought in the exact same way in every match\u2014Wang Dong would make move on his own, while Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao would simply sit back and watch. The match would end in a short period of time, causing him to remain mystified as to what abilities Huo Yuhao possessed. As a theory-based teacher, how could he not feel depressed?\u201cHuo Yuhao, you three come over here for a moment.\u201d When the second day\u2019s matches had concluded, Wang Yan called Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three over.\u201cTeacher Wang.\u201d Huo Yuhao walked in front, with Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao flanking him.As I thought. Wang Yan inwardly thought to himself. This Huo Yuhao truly is the core of their team!\u201cYou three have obtained an excellent result of five victories in five matches. You must continue to work hard in your future matches, so that you can participate in the ranking tournament for the top sixty-four teams. However, tomorrow\u2019s five matches won\u2019t be nearly as easy as today\u2019s were. After today\u2019s matches have concluded, we\u2019ll be drawing lots again, while teams who\u2019ve lost all of their matches will be eliminated. When we draw lots, we\u2019ll make sure that students from the same class won\u2019t meet each other, but your previous results will also be brought into consideration. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll definitely remain in the 33rd arena, but there\u2019s a very high chance that you\u2019ll meet a strong team, or even two, that are capable of challenging you.\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded and replied, \u201cThank you, Teacher Wang. We\u2019ll definitely work hard.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go back and get some rest.\u201d He still held himself back from asking Huo Yuhao about his martial soul, as he still had some pride in himself. He believed that Huo Yuhao wouldn\u2019t be able to hide his martial soul from him once they met a strong opponent.\u201cHow relaxing! Winning against them was as easy as chopping vegetables.\u201d Wang Dong said with excited look on their way back. He was extremely satisfied with how they\u2019d done today.Xiao Xiao said, \u201cIt should be my turn to go out tomorrow. Wang Dong, you\u2019ve only used your first soul skill so far. If the opponents we meet tomorrow are even stronger than today\u2019s, I\u2019m afraid that you might have to use your second soul skill. However, your second soul skill was created from a thousand year soul ring, so it\u2019s the strongest attack technique we have on our team. We shouldn\u2019t let other people see it easily; we should only use it during the ranking tournament. If we meet any strong opponents tomorrow, I\u2019ll help you out. We should try our best to only use our first soul skills. Even if we do meet an extremely strong opponent, I\u2019ll be the one to use their second soul skill, so that we can keep yours hidden. This way, we\u2019ll have two trump cards. How about it?\u201dWang Dong laughed. \u201cXiao Xiao, you\u2019ve said all this, but it\u2019s really just because your hands are itchy, isn\u2019t it? Fine, we\u2019ll do it your way. I\u2019ve already been satisfied, so I\u2019ll let you pleasure yourself for a bit.\u201dFortunately, there weren\u2019t any adults walking near them while they were speaking. If there had been, Wang Dong\u2019s words could have been interpreted very differently.Huo Yuhao chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll treat you two to some roasted fish. I ordered some extra yesterday.\u201dAs the three of them left the Examination Area, they bumped into two people. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong couldn\u2019t help but be stunned when they saw who the people they\u2019d bumped into were.The people they\u2019d bumped into weren\u2019t random people; it was the red-clothed disciple from the inner courtyard, Ma Xiaotao, and the person she\u2019d dragged away a few days ago, Xu Sanshi.Compared to his usual high-spirited self, the current Xu Sanshi had an ashen look on his face, as if all the energy had been drained from his body. He looked listless, and his clothes were crumpled. His current appearance was extremely dispirited.Ma Xiaotao was still as beautiful as ever, although there was an abnormal flush on her charming face, and the pinkness of her eyes had darkened a bit.\u201cWe\u2019ve found them, right? Sister Xiaotao, can I go now?\u201d Xu Sanshi had a bitter smile on his face as he spoke. After being tormented by an intense amount of pain for a few days, he\u2019d finally managed to endure the last of it. However, the drain on his energy, physical strength, and soulforce was too severe. Right now, all he wanted to do was return to his room and sleep.Ma Xiaotao nodded. \u201cOkay, you can go.\u201dXu Sanshi glanced at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong with a look that said \u2018you can fend for yourselves\u2019 before he left. His disloyal appearance caused the two to feel nervous. Just why had Ma Xiaotao been looking for them?Ma Xiaotao indifferently said, \u201cYou two, follow me. Junior classmate, you can return by yourself.\u201dXiao Xiao was just about to say something, but Huo Yuhao immediately shook his head, indicating that she should leave, and that nothing would happen to them.Seeing that Ma Xiaotao probably hadn\u2019t come with good intentions, he didn\u2019t want to drag Xiao Xiao into this. Furthermore, this was still the academy; Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong both believed that she wouldn\u2019t do anything to bad to them.Xiao Xiao felt somewhat unresigned, but she left unwillingly in the end. Following Ma Xiaotao\u2019s lead, the two walked towards the lakeside path. After walking for a little while, they arrived at the lakeside where they\u2019d first been attacked by her.Ma Xiaotao only stopped when she was right in front of the Sea God\u2019s Lake. However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong both kept their distance from her. Wang Dong had a vigilant look on his face, while Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart was thumping.\u201cSenior sister Ma, why did you call us over?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked probingly.With her back to them, Ma Xiaotao said, \u201cYou should\u2019ve guessed it by now. You\u2019re right; I was the student who burst out from the inner courtyard\u2014the student who almost harmed you two that time. At the time, I truly had no choice. Now then, I\u2019d first like to apologize to you two.\u201dWang Dong curled his lips, inwardly thinking, This is apologizing? There\u2019s no sincerity in your actions at all!The two glanced at each other, then Huo Yuhao said, \u201cSenior sister Ma, let\u2019s let bygones be bygones. The school\u2019s already compensated us anyway.\u201dMa Xiaotao suddenly turned around, the shades of pink in her eyes suddenly darkening further. An ineffable pressure suddenly appeared on Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong\u2019s bodies.\u201cIn my opinion, this matter isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d Ma Xiaotao growled.\u201cThat day, there should\u2019ve been an ice-type soul master that stopped me. That was what stopped me from harming you two. That person is extremely important to me. Tell me everything you know. Perhaps it was one of your protectors. Either way, I must find them.\u201dWang Dong had a blank look on his face. \u201cSenior sister Ma, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. When you attacked us that day, we both fainted from the high temperatures your body was emitting! We don\u2019t know anything about what happened after that! As for this ice-type soul master you\u2019re talking about, we don\u2019t have any way of knowing who he is.\u201dHuo Yuhao followed Wang Dong\u2019s lead and nodded his head. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t divulge his secrets regarding the Skydream Iceworm.Seeing that they didn\u2019t seem to be lying, a trace of hesitation appeared in Ma Xiaotao\u2019s eyes.The reason that she\u2019d gone looking for the two of them was because, after returning that day, she\u2019d suddenly thought about why they\u2019d felt familiar to her: It was because she\u2019d seen some information regarding Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong in the inner courtyard.Three months ago, she\u2019d relied on the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s cold energy to suppress the demonic fire within her body, which had let her cultivation speed greatly increase while it was suppressed. When the cold energy vanished, she was only able to rely on Xu Sanshi. However, she discovered that although his Mysterious Underworld Turtle was a peak-ranked martial soul, it was still just a water-type martial soul, not an ice-type martial soul. Hence, the help that it brought her had gradually decreased.If she wasn\u2019t able to suppress the demonic fire in her body, she\u2019d have to stop cultivating. Moreover, that demonic fire in her body could explode at any time, causing her to lose her consciousness.After thinking it over for a while, she\u2019d decided to look for Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. If she was able to find the person that had previously used that ice-type martial soul to stop her, her problems could easily be solved.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d Ma Xiaotao asked in a low voice.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously shook their heads.Ma Xiaotao\u2019s expression suddenly changed as she spoke in a chilly voice, \u201cThen don\u2019t blame me for being impolite. If you really don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll have to force him out.\u201d As she spoke, a strong wave of heat was erupted outwards as a volcano-like scarlet flame shot out from Ma Xiaotao\u2019s body.When the two had been called over by Ma Xiaotao, they\u2019d already felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Hence, they\u2019d maintained their vigilance at all times. After the loss that they\u2019d suffered last time, the two immediately reacted the instant that Ma Xiaotao made her move! They couldn\u2019t just sit and wait for their deaths!The wings of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess instantly shot out from Wang Dong\u2019s back. As they unfurled, they were already filled with golden patterns; Wang Dong\u2019s Wing Guillotine had instantly been activated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In addition to that, they had a tacit understanding of each other. Hence, when they suddenly released their skills, Wang Dong grabbed Huo Yuhao from behind and quickly flew backwards.Ma Xiaotao was clearly careless. There was no way that she\u2019d even pay attention to a one and two-ringed soul master! As she released her martial soul, dazzling fire-red feathers covered her entire body. However, Wang Dong had already begun to rapidly fly away with Huo Yuhao in tow.Following that, Ma Xiaotao saw a purple light flicker in Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes. In that instant, she felt as if Huo Yuhao\u2019s gaze had become akin to two sharp needles piercing towards her, which made her subconsciously shut her eyes. Furthermore, her brain felt dizzy for a moment.The strength of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Shock had increased in power when his Purple Demon Eyes had broken through. Even with her six-ringed level of cultivation, Ma Xiaotao hadn\u2019t been able to take it on directly.Although it only stopped Ma Xiaotao for a moment, Wang Dong had already managed to charge out of the forest with Huo Yuhao in tow, returning to the lakeside path.\u201cHead back towards the school buildings!\u201d Huo Yuhao shouted. At the same time, he swung his hand in Ma Xiaotao\u2019s direction, causing a few icy lights to fly directly towards her. They were the hidden weapons that Tang Ya had given him. He\u2019d used the most basic, albeit fastest, throwing technique when he threw them.An intense stream of air simultaneously erupted from the golden patterns on Wang Dong\u2019s wings, rapidly pushing him into the distance.But how could Ma Xiaotao be willing to let the two of them escape? She simply ignored Huo Yuhao\u2019s hidden weapons and rushed towards them with a flash. An enormous pair of fiery wings unfurled, causing all of the metallic hidden weapons in front of her to instantly melt into a liquid that fell to the ground. The terrifying heat that was emanated from her was akin to a huge hand trying to smother Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong from behind.Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection was an extremely strong skill that could reverse the outcome of a battle, but that was only when both parties were at around the same rank. When they were facing an opponent like Ma Xiaotao, it was simply too flimsy a skill. Even if they could accurately predict her movements, what could they do? Even if they knew everything about her, they still couldn\u2019t stop her!Wang Dong was already doing his utmost to fly as best as he could, but the heatwave swallowed the two of them in what was practically an instant. If one was to look at it with a bird\u2019s-eye view, they would\u2019ve discovered that Ma Xiaotao\u2019s figure had caught up to the two in basically an instant. Afterwards, her enormous pair of fiery wings had expanded, before suddenly folding inward, trapping Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong within them.Ma Xiaotao grabbed the two of them by their collars. Her terrifying soulforce undulations caused the two of them to immediately lose their ability to resist. Fire surrounded them, causing them to be entirely unable to see the outside world at all. Even speaking was an impossible task.Ma Xiaotao silently waited there with a serious look on her face. After half an hour passed, she her brow furrowed. \u201cWas it really a coincidence last time?\u201dShe only had one objective from making a move against the two\u2014to force out the ice-type soul master that had previously suppressed her. However, things weren\u2019t going as she wished. If you looked at the situation from the outside, she\u2019d already swallowed Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong within her flames. However, that soul master still hadn\u2019t appeared.The fiery light withdrew, causing the surrounding flames to fade away. Ma Xiaotao had also regained her composure. She relaxed her grip on Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, causing them to stumble and fall to the ground.Ma Xiaotao indifferently said, \u201cSince this is unrelated to you two, so be it. I know that you two won\u2019t accept this, so work hard and cultivate. If you can enter the inner courtyard one day, I\u2019ll give you the chance to challenge me.\u201d When she finished speaking, she turned around and left. She completely ignored the two of them, who were filled with indignation.\u201cThis madwoman!\u201d Wang Dong shouted angrily.Huo Yuhao climbed to his feet, then pulled Wang Dong up. \u201cLet it go. If you still have the strength to curse at her, use it to cultivate when you get back. She\u2019s not wrong; whose fault is it that we\u2019re not stronger than her? Let\u2019s head back.\u201d Previously, when Ma Xiaotao had been forced back by the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s finger, Huo Yuhao had seen everything. Because of this, he\u2019d faintly guessed what Ma Xiaotao was talking about.There was practically no chance of a clear-headed Ma Xiaotao killing them; she just wanted to force the Skydream Iceworm out. However, Huo Yuhao had already deduced her objective, but even if he hadn\u2019t, the Skydream Iceworm still couldn\u2019t even come out! The old man was sleeping soundly; he\u2019d already said that he wouldn\u2019t be able to help Huo Yuhao for another year.When Xiao Xiao saw the two the day after, she couldn\u2019t help a hint of astonishment from appearing on her charming face. \u201cWhat happened to you two? Why do the two of you have such ugly looks on your faces? Did that senior sister from the inner courtyard do something to you?\u201dWang Dong answered first, \u201cObviously not. She just wanted to ask us a few question. Don\u2019t worry about it, let\u2019s hurry up and head to the assessment.\u201d He was obviously unwilling to speak about such an embarrassing matter.Since they were the team that had achieved the best results during the previous five-round tournament, they were able to remain in the 33rd arena. After lots were redrawn, they were paired with another five teams in order to continue their assessment.These students definitely weren\u2019t first-rankers from the other arenas, as such they certainly wouldn\u2019t meet any amazingly strong opponents during their next five rounds. However, it still wouldn\u2019t be as easy for them as their previous matches.Teacher Wang Yan glanced at Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three with a deep look in his eyes, then proceeded to make an announcement, \u201cAlright, everyone\u2019s present. Since Class 1\u2019s \u2018Team Huo Yuhao\u2019 was able to obtain the best results in this arena during their previous five matches, they\u2019re the seeded team of this arena. As for the order of the matches, the first match of the 33rd arena\u2019s sixth round will be: Class 1\u2019s Team Huo Yuhao versus Class 7\u2019s Team Huang Chutian. Begin the assessment.\u201dWhen the two sides entered the arena, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three was immediately astonished by the fact that there was an identical pair of female students on the opposing team.The two female students had blue hair, and their small, delicate faces were rosy. They looked extremely cute, and even seemed to be slightly younger than them.A pair of twins?A tall and sturdy male student stood in front of the two girls; he was clearly Huang Chutian, their team leader.\u201cI\u2019m Huang Chutian. The girl on my left is Lan Susu, while the girl on my right is Lan Luoluo. Please advise us.\u201d\u201cHuo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao. Please advise us.\u201d Huo Yuhao replied.Both parties took their positions. Huo Yuhao\u2019s side followed their original formation, with Wang Dong in front, Xiao Xiao in the middle, and Huo Yuhao in the corner of the arena.On the other side, Huang Chutian stood in front, while Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo stood behind him. Teams could only have one assault system soul master, and it was extremely obvious that one of the twins couldn\u2019t possibly be their team\u2019s assault system soul master. Hence, it was extremely possible that they were both auxiliary system soul masters, or even both control system soul masters like Huo Yuhao\u2019s team.Teacher Wang Yan let out a low shout, \u201cLet the assessment begin!\u201dBoth sides quickly released their martial souls. Huang Chutian let out a roar and used both hands to forcefully beat on his chest. He hadn\u2019t even reached the age of twelve, yet he was already 1.5 metres tall. After releasing his martial soul, his stature instantly shot up to 1.8 metres or so, whilst his bulging muscles directly ripped the school uniform that he was wearing apart, exposing his muscles, which had turned metallic black.His originally black eyes had turned yellow, and two canine teeth were now protruding from his thickened lips. His four limbs were become thick and solid, while his muscles looked as tough as steel.Two yellow soul rings simultaneously rose up from his feet. Impressively, he was an assault system Soul Grandmaster.The pair of twins behind Huang Chutian also released their martial souls, which, unexpectedly, turned out to be their hair\u2026Two soul rings unexpectedly also appeared below Lan Luoluo and Lan Susu\u2019s feet, all four yellow. With a swing of their heads, their long, blue hair immediately rose into the air, rapidly spreading out in midair. It quickly reached ten or so metres in length as it floated in midair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just how had they not obtained first in their original area? This was also the first team formed by three Soul Grandmasters that Huo Yuhao\u2019s team had met.Huang Chutian\u2019s team of three were indeed strong, but they\u2019d just so happened to meet an enemy in their original area that had perfectly restrained them. Hence, they\u2019d ended up with four wins and one loss, relegating them to the 33rd Area.Wang Dong flew out at as soon as the match started. As his beautiful Radiant Butterfly Goddess\u2019 wings unfurled, the twin girls in front of him were starstruck; the way they looked at Wang Dong immediately changed.Huang Chutian let out a low roar and he suddenly took large strides to meet Wang Dong head-on. As his feet landed on the ground, they unexpectedly caused deep \u2018boom\u2019s to ring out. When he was only three metres away from Wang Dong, he suddenly leapt towards Wang Dong and smashed his fists straight towards him.Wang Dong folded his wings together, forcefully receiving the blow.\u201cBang\u2014\u201d Huang Chutian was unexpectedly the one forced back towards the ground. When he landed, he took a few steps back to steady his body.After steadying himself, he immediately leapt back into the air and headed straight towards Wang Dong again.At that moment, a large, pitch-black cauldron soundlessly appeared at the summit of Huang Chutian\u2019s leap. He basically looked like he was purposefully trying to smash himself into it.Huang Chutian was somewhat stunned. He couldn\u2019t borrow any force to change direction midair, thus he couldn\u2019t change the direction of his jump once he was in the air. In a moment of helplessness, he had no choice but to smash the large cauldron away instead.Strangely, the large cauldron moved 30cm backwards just as his movements changed, allowing it to \u2018sidestep\u2019 his fist, before it instantly charged forwards.However, Huang Chutian was still relatively strong. By angling his body forwards, he unexpectedly managed to shake the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.\u201cBang\u2014\u201d Huang Chutian was sent flying backwards, while the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron descended from the sky and landed beside Wang Dong. This was the first time that Xiao Xiao had made a move during the freshman assessment.As the proctor of the match, Wang Yan\u2019s eyes lit up. He\u2019d naturally been able to see just how extraordinary Xiao Xiao\u2019s martial soul was, which made him seriously evaluate Xiao Xiao\u2019s ability to grasp key moments in a battle.Wang Dong turned to Xiao Xiao and smiled. \u201cI was just testing his strength. This guy\u2019s martial soul should be the extremely tough Herculean Ape, no wonder he\u2019s so strong.\u201d After saying this, he leapt back into the air. He toes tapped the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron with his toes on his way back up, and his first soul ring lit up.\u201cHuang Chutian, let\u2019s see whether or not your toughness can withstand my Wing Guillotine.\u201d Extending his wings, he charged towards his opponent.As Wang Dong flew towards his opponent, Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo stopped looking towards him. Instead, the pair looked at each other, and clasped their hands. An even stronger soulforce undulation immediately erupted from them. Their ten or so metres of blue hair instantly flew into the air, forming a large net in midair that flew towards Wang Dong.Using a net to confront a butterfly was clearly the best method available to them.Hairnet\u2014this was a soul skill that both of the twins possessed as their first soul skill. When the two identical soul skills were used together via the connection between their spirits to form a large blue net that enshrouded Wang Dong, Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection unexpectedly couldn\u2019t sense any gaps in it.Huang Chutian\u2019s figure rapidly retreated into the net of hair, which seemed to possess a pair of eyes, as it let him pass through without even touching him,The situation that Huo Yuhao had been most worried about had occurred\u2014their opponents consisted of a team of one assault system soul master and two control system soul masters. Furthermore, the two control system soul masters had even turned out to be twins, which naturally meant that the connection between the two of them was deeper.At this moment, the overbearing might of Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing showed itself. The Hairnet was originally meant to suppress his butterfly-type martial soul, but when he waved his Guillotine Wing, its sharp edge emitted a terrifyingly destructive power. Two enormous bluish-golden blades danced about, unexpectedly tearing a hole in the large net. He used the opportunity he\u2019d made to instantly dive down towards Huang Chutian with the aid of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing.Huang Chutian and the two sisters were astonished; they hadn\u2019t expected the destructive strength of Wang Dong\u2019s Radiant Butterfly Goddess to be this great. Moreover, they didn\u2019t understand how Wang Dong could\u2019ve known exactly where Huang Chutian was, despite his vision being blocked by the Hairnet.Huang Chutian let out a loud roar, his first soul ring instantly lighting up. The size of his fists suddenly doubled, and they shone with a strong metallic luster. After he did this, he met Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing head-on. While this was happening, the Lan sisters released their Hairnets in an attempt to trap him from behind.\u201cDong\u2014\u201d When Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing slammed into his metallic fists, a hard sound unexpectedly rang out. Huang Chutian was forced back once again; he stumbled backwards five or six steps before he steadied himself. Fresh blood dripped off his fists, which had been cut open.Huang Chutian\u2019s expression changed. His Herculean Ape was a relatively tyrannical martial soul; it was widely known as one that possessed both extremely tough skin as well as extraordinary strength. However, it had actually been unable to block Wang Dong\u2019s wings. It wasn\u2019t because he was weaker than Wang Dong, but because of how terrifyingly sharp Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing was. If he hadn\u2019t retreated, his fists might\u2019ve been seriously injured.After using a single slash to force Huang Chutian back, Wang Dong\u2019s might had flourished even more. He flapped his rear wings, allowing him to adjust his posture, then proceeded to rapidly whirl his wings, causing his Guillotine Wing to resemble a spinning top as it tore apart the Hairnet that was approaching him from behind.Xiao Xiao could naturally sense Wang Dong\u2019s current condition via Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing. Because of this, she didn\u2019t make any other moves with her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.\u201cRoar\u2014\u201d Huang Chutian let out another angry roar. He clasped his hands and raised them above his head, causing his second soul ring o finally light up. A dense layer of yellow light filled his body. This time his arms expanded, causing his strong muscles to be filled with a terrifying strength. The yellow light continued to circulate until it reached his fists, where it finally stopped.\u201cPower Cannon!\u201d Huang Chutian shouted, suddenly sending his fists smashing towards Wang Dong. A condensed yellow ball of light instantly shot out from his fists towards Wang Dong. This ball of light unexpectedly had a lock-on ability, as Wang Dong was unable to shake it off after dodging it three times.As he prepared to use the Guillotine Wing to block the ball of light, the hint of a smile suddenly appeared on Wang Dong\u2019s face. He surprisingly chose to give up on blocking it, instead choosing to ignore the Power Cannon entirely. He turned over and flew downwards, straight towards the Lan sisters, as he continued to tear their Hairnet apart.The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron soundlessly appeared behind Wang Dong when he did this, fiercely smashing into the Power Cannon. The instant that the two collided, a black halo was diffused from the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, causing a deafening rumble to echo out in midair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although its explosive force was enough to send the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron flying when it smashed into the cauldron, Huang Chutian\u2019s attack was finally neutralised. Furthermore, the Lan sisters were currently facing Wang Dong\u2019s all-out attack.The Lan sisters had clearly underestimated their opponents. Although Huang Chutian was at a disadvantage when fighting Wang Dong, he hadn\u2019t been defeated. However, they\u2019d forgotten that Wang Dong wasn\u2019t by himself! As Wang Dong flew straight towards them whilst tearing apart their Hairnets, they realised that they didn\u2019t have enough time to use their second soul skills anymore, as there needed to be a certain amount of distance between the two parties for its greatest might to be unleashed.The sisters glanced at each other, a determined look appearing in their eyes. The soul rings on the two girl\u2019s bodies simultaneously disappeared, and they suddenly unclasped their hands. Next, they unexpectedly opened their arms and hugged each other.Wang Dong was stunned for a moment\u2014what were they trying to do?The Lan sisters answered his question a moment later. They instantly released an undulation of soulforce that greatly exceeded that of the previous one. The instant that they embraced each other, a blue halo of light was released from their bodies, which encapsulated them and made it impossible to see them clearly. At the same time, their long hair flew into the air and turned a shade of sparkling blue. Their Hairnets were still as thin as before, but the feeling that they gave Wang Dong as they tried to cover him this time was entirely different.His Guillotine Wing cut into it again, but it wasn\u2019t cut through instantly like it had been before. Wang Dong felt as if he\u2019d smashed into an extremely flexible and durable net; no matter how much he struggled, the net got smaller and smaller around him. The instant that the large net completely covered him, Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection Sharing unexpectedly disappeared.Could Huo Yuhao have stopped the skill? The answer to that was obviously \u2018no\u2019. The reason behind Wang Dong\u2019s current predicament was due to the fact that this soul skill was simply too strong; so much so that its enormous soulforce undulations had allowed it to forcefully block out Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection. No matter how you looked at it, Huo Yuhao was still only a one-ringed soul master after all.In what seemed to be an instant, Wang Dong had become a dumpling trapped within the net of hair; the sparkling strands of blue hair had surrounded him completely. However, the \u2018omnipresent\u2019 strands of hair didn\u2019t simply stop here. Instead, they rapidly flew towards Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao to entrap them as well.\u201cA soul fusion skill?\u201d Xiao Xiao let out a surprised cry. She quickly unleashed an all-out attack with the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. The large cauldron split into three smaller cauldrons in midair, before smashing into the large web.This so-called \u2018soul fusion skill\u2019 was a combined skill that could be unleashed by two soul masters who had extremely congenial martial souls. Hence, the power of a soul fusion skill far exceeded that of any soul skill of the same rank. It was an existence that was no longer on the same level as other soul skills. On the other hand, a soul fusion skill could only be unleashed by an extremely small number of soul masters; finding two compatible soul masters was as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.Huang Chutian was naturally the strongest individual on his team, but their team\u2019s true trump card was the soul fusion skill that the Lan sisters could use!During their previous matches, they\u2019d made sure to patiently restrain themselves. They went so far as to not use their soul fusion skill, even if it meant losing a match. However, this was the first match of the fifth round; they couldn\u2019t afford to lose anymore. Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was Class 1\u2019s seeded team. Likewise, Huang Chutian and the Lan sisters were Class 7\u2019s seeded team; their duty was to gun for the top three spots.Because of this, the Lan sisters had decided to embrace each other and activate the Empyreal Net only after considering it for a brief moment.Don\u2019t even mention a two-ringed Soul Grandmaster; even a three-ringed Soul Elder wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from the Empyreal Net if he was all by himself.When the Empyreal Net swallowed up the three black cauldrons, Xiao Xiao let out a frail cry, causing three simultaneous rumbling sounds to ring out from within the Empyreal Net.The Empyreal Net unexpectedly shook a little bit. This was the skill that had previously blocked Huang Chutian\u2019s soul skill\u2014the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron\u2019s first soul skill: Cauldron Quake.Its activation this time around differed from its previous usage. This time, Cauldron Quake was simultaneously used by all three cauldrons, causing its strength to be fully released.The secret behind Xiao Xiao\u2019s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron lay here: when the three cauldrons were fused together, their defensive capabilities were at their greatest. When the three cauldrons were separated, their attacking capabilities and soul skills power were at their greatest.However, the Empyreal Net was still a soul fusion skill! Although Xiao Xiao\u2019s all-out Cauldron Quake was extremely strong, it paled in significance to the Empyreal Net. After a slight tremble, the Empyreal Net continued to fly towards Xiao Xiao, appearing before her in an instant.At this moment, Huo Yuhao suddenly shouted, \u201cWang Dong!\u201dThe Empyreal Net which had already neared Xiao Xiao suddenly stopped, as if it had been intimidated by Huo Yuhao\u2019s voice. A strong bluish-golden light suddenly lit up from within the depths of the Empyreal Net.Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mental Detection Sharing had been activated the whole time. Although it was currently being blocked by the Empyreal Net, Xiao Xiao still felt the strengthening effect of his Mental Detection Sharing. Suddenly, to her astonishment, the originally wide-range Mental Detection Sharing suddenly narrowed down and pierced straight into the heart of the Emypreal Net in the instant that Huo Yuhao shouted.Not only that, but Huo Yuhao\u2019s soulforce undulations seemed to be rapidly rising, along with an incomprehensible force that seemed to be mixed in with it. Afterwards, Xiao Xiao felt as if something had swept over her mind, causing a wave of dizziness to overcome her.Following that, the omnipresent Empyreal Net collapsed, like it had been washed away by the tide.\u201cPutong\u2014\u2014\u201dAs Wang Dong landed, he took a few deep breaths. Evidently he\u2019d been severely drained. On the other hand, the Lan sisters had been left in an even worse condition; they\u2019d already fainted and were lying on the ground.Huo Yuhao\u2019s face was now extremely pale; he was so tired that he couldn\u2019t even maintain his Mental Detection Sharing. Although he wasn\u2019t as out of breath as Wang Dong, his chest was unceasingly moving up and down.Wang Yan, who was still overlooking the arena, looked on with an inconceivable look in his eyes.When the Lan sisters had activated their Empyreal Net, his eyes had already been filled with astonishment. He\u2019d originally thought that Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was destined to lose, but he never expected the dramatic change that had just occurred. Just as the Empyreal Net was about to defeat its opponents and obtain victory for Huang Chutian\u2019s team, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team had unexpectedly managed to flip heaven and earth around in an instant.Wang Yan was depressed by the fact that he\u2019d been unable to see how Huo Yuhao\u2019s team had made their move. This was especially true for Huo Yuhao himself; from his pale expression and his previous yell, it was evident that he\u2019d made a move. Furthermore, it was highly likely that breaking the Empyreal Net was something that he\u2019d achieved by going all-out. However, in what way had he made a move? And, how had he broken a soul fusion skill? Wang Yan just couldn\u2019t see how he\u2019d managed to do it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Huang Chutian had been greatly astonished by the fact that they weren\u2019t able to defeat their opponents, he quickly returned to his senses. He pounced towards Wang Dong, who was the closest to him, and let out a low roar. From his point of view, it must\u2019ve been Wang Dong who\u2019d broken their soul fusion skill. Huo Yuhao merely had a ten year soul ring, so he wouldn\u2019t attract any attention under normal circumstances.At this moment, Wang Dong was nearly exhausted. As he looked at the approaching Huang Chutian, he forcefully flapped his wings backwards in retreat. He shouted, \u201cXiao Xiao, I\u2019m counting on you!\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d Xiao Xiao humphed, causing the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron that he\u2019d separated to attack the Empyreal Net to re-merge. Although she didn\u2019t have the assistance of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mental Detection, Huang Chutian\u2019s objective was obvious. The large cauldron shifted horizontally, placing itself in front of Wang Dong\u2019s body in order to block Huang Chutian\u2019s way.On the other hand, Huo Yuhao immediately sat down in a cross-legged position behind Xiao Xiao, attempting to recover his mental energy via meditation. His earlier move had drained him by a considerable amount. Fortunately, he was no longer the rookie that he\u2019d previously been at the eleventh or twelfth rank; his Purple Demon Eyes had also experienced a qualitative leap, which was why his energy hadn\u2019t been completely depleted. However, that move of his had caused waves of dizziness to fill his mind. Thus, he was no longer able to simultaneously maintain both his Mental Detection and his Mental Sharing; he needed to rest for a while.For someone to break a soul fusion skill with Huo Yuhao\u2019s strength? That was obviously impossible. He was still only a one-ringed soul master. Although his million year soul ring was strong, he was still far away from being able to use the true might of the Skydream Iceworm.The reason that he\u2019d been able to destroy the Empyreal Net was a culmination of many factors. Of them, Huo Yuhao had played the most crucial role.When he\u2019d shouted Wang Dong\u2019s name, the latter had immediately understood him, and had released his second soul skill while the Empyreal Net was unceasingly contracting. Wang Dong\u2019s second soul skill was naturally unable to destroy a soul fusion skill by itself, but don\u2019t forget that Wang Dong\u2019s second soul skill was from a thousand year soul ring, which meant that its strength was considerably higher than normal. Although it couldn\u2019t destroy the Empyreal Net, it was still able to rapidly increase the Lan sisters\u2019 soulforce consumption.Following that, it was time for Huo Yuhao\u2019s attack. Since the Empyreal Net blocked his Mental Detection, he\u2019d focused it in one direction. This allowed his strong mental undulations to overcome the Empyreal Net and for it to penetrate through it. However, this was in one direction only.When he found the Lan sisters, he immediately released his Spirit Shock skill that was also amplified by his Purple Demon Eyes at full power; the dizziness that Xiao Xiao had felt had been caused by Huo Yuhao\u2019s all-out attack.The facts showed that Huo Yuhao\u2019s all-out effort had succeeded. The Lan sisters\u2019 soul fusion skill was sufficiently strong, but it wasn\u2019t flawless. Its greatest flaw lay in the fact that their cultivation levels were just barely sufficient to utilize it. Hence, they weren\u2019t able to maintain it for a long time. After Wang Dong had drained them with his soul skill, Huo Yuhao\u2019s sudden Spirit Shock had struck their minds. The strong mental undulations had instantly collapsed their skill, while the large backlash from their soul fusion skill had immediately knocked them out.Despite this, the Lan sisters had been able to almost completely rid Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong of their combat capabilities. From this, it could be seen just how strong a soul fusion skill was. Huo Yuhao seemed very weak, but he had a million year soul ring!Huang Chutian\u2019s hands viciously slammed into the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron; this was his first soul skill, the Vigorous King Kong fist.\u201cBoom\u2014\u201d His metallic fists slammed into a black halo, instantly sending the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron three metres away. However, Huang Chutian stood unmoving in his original spot, his body violently shaking for a moment.Xiao Xiao\u2019s Cauldron Quake had a strong stunning effect. It wasn\u2019t only capable of hurting her opponents; all enemies within a one metre radius of the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron would be stunned on impact.Once Huang Chutian was stunned, Xiao Xiao coldly snorted and clasped her hands together, causing the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron to instantly split into three, trapping Huang Chutian in the middle.The stun effect only lasted a short while. As such, Huang Chutian quickly regained his senses after a short while. This time, he didn\u2019t immediately make a move; he decided to pause for a moment in order to observe the situation in front of him.The Lan sisters had already fainted, resulting in them losing all of their combat capabilities. On the other hand, Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao seemed to have lost their fighting capabilities as well, but they were still conscious. As a result of this, it wasn\u2019t certain when they\u2019d be able to rejoin the battle. Only a blitzkrieg strategy would give Huang Chutian\u2019s team a chance of obtaining victory in this assessment.Once he\u2019d finished thinking about this, Huang Chutian let out a loud roar. He suddenly stamped his feet, causing his body to quickly ascend. Meanwhile, he clasped his hands above his head, his second soul ring lighting up. Power Cannon was activated once again.Xiao Xiao gestured inwards with her hands, immediately causing the three cauldrons to simultaneously rise upwards and strike inwards. The strength of Huang Chutian\u2019s Power Cannon was extraordinary; as a result, she absolutely couldn\u2019t let him release it.However, Huang Chutian let out a cunning smile. His body suddenly flipped around in midair, turning his body upside-down before the three cauldrons could converge. He swung his clasped fists with all his strength, causing a ball of yellow light to immediately shoot towards Xiao Xiao.When fighting an enemy, one has to consider their own safety. Huang Chutian didn\u2019t believe that Xiao Xiao was willing to go through mutual destruction. As long as she returned her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron to protect herself, he\u2019d have a chance to approach her. Then, the opportunity to win would present itself to him.Indeed, Huang Chutian\u2019s plan was extremely clever. If Xiao Xiao wanted to defend herself against his Power Cannon, she\u2019d have to merge her three cauldrons. And if that happened, Huang Chutian would have enough time to approach the trio. No matter who he decided to attack, they\u2019d definitely have a hard time resisting him.However, he suddenly felt as if his eyesight had gone bad the instant before he made his move. His Power Cannon had been released, but it had actually been sent out in the wrong direction\u2026The yellow ball of light was accompanied by an explosive sound as it flew outwards at a tilted angle and blasting the Examination Area\u2019s partitioning walls to smithereens. The students from the neighbouring area, who were currently undergoing their assessment, couldn\u2019t help but look towards their direction with an astonished expression.And at this moment, the victor of the match between Huo Yuhao\u2019s team and Huang Chutian\u2019s team was decided.Xiao Xiao\u2019s three cauldrons merged back into one in preparation to protect her. However, after the large, re-merged cauldron had flown back several metres, it swept back and viciously struck Huang Chutian\u2019s body. After Xiao Xiao\u2019s second soul ring lit up, Huang Chutian was enshrouded by a black halo, and was sent flying out of the arena. Wang Yan stretched his arm out to catch him, thus he wasn\u2019t sent flying even further.That black light unceasingly lingered on his body; it took a full three seconds for Huang Chutian to regain the ability to move.This was the second soul skill of Xiao Xiao\u2019s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron: Cauldron Sweep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 19.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19.4: Soul Fusion Skill\u2014Empyreal NetWhen Cauldron Sweep was used against a single opponent, it wouldn\u2019t only hurt them via the collision, it would also sweep them away while simultaneously stunning him. Hence, it could be considered a control-type skill. Relying on these two skills, Xiao Xiao was definitely worthy of calling herself a control system soul master.Xiao Xiao naturally hadn\u2019t been able to predict that her opponent\u2019s attack would deviate from its original target. The reason why she changed from a defensive state to an offensive one was because she once more received Huo Yuhao\u2019s assistance.Only, she didn\u2019t know that Huo Yuhao had simultaneously released three soul skills in that instant, and that these three soul skills had finally consumed the last of his soulforce.Of these three skills, the one he\u2019d never before used in a battle was Spiritual Interference, which was an area of effect skill.Compared to Spirit Shock, Spiritual Interference seemed much weaker. However, don\u2019t forget that it was an area of effect skill. Furthermore, its effects were very subtle when it was activated. As a result of this, enemies would often be unaware that it had affected them. Otherwise, how could Huang Chutian\u2019s locked-on Power Cannon deviate from its target?Wang Yan said, \u201cHuo Yuhao\u2019s team wins.\u201d While he spoke, he placed Huang Chutian\u2014who was at a loss\u2014back on the ground. Afterwards, he followed him to the Lan sisters and used his soulforce to awaken them.After the Lan sisters had awakened, they felt a splitting headache; it was as if ten thousand needles were pricking their brains.Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Shock had become much stronger than before; even the six-ringed Ma Xiaotao had been slightly affected, let alone the two of them. Combined with the backlash from their soul fusion skill, Huang Chutian\u2019s team could be said to have suffered a great loss from this match. Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to recover their combat strength today. However, they still had four more matches today!On the other hand, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was in a much better situation compared to their opponents. Fortunately, they\u2019d obtained a victory. Furthermore, Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao had only been drained of their soulforce; they hadn\u2019t been injured. They could recuperate for two matches\u2019 worth of time, at the very least. However, Xiao Xiao would have to become the main strength of the team during the following matches.While Wang Dong supported the weak Huo Yuhao as he walked to the side of the arena, Xiao Xiao followed them and suspiciously asked, \u201cClass monitor, why did his attack miss?\u201dHuo Yuhao smiled bitterly. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this right now. We should hurry and meditate to restore our soulforce. Our first match has drained us by this much, yet we still have four more matches today. We can only pray that everyone else was drained this much as well.\u201dAfter speaking, he immediately sat in a cross-legged position to begin meditating.It wasn\u2019t just Xiao Xiao who was puzzled; Wang Dong was slightly puzzled as well, but unlike Xiao Xiao, he found it strange that the Lan sisters\u2019 fusion skill had been broken so easily. If they were only able to maintain their fusion skill for such a short time, was there any point in them using it? The answer was definitely no. However, they\u2019d still used it, and it had in-turn quickly been shattered by his thousand-year soul skill. Furthermore, they\u2019d even been knocked unconscious. Just what was going on? When he thought about Huo Yuhao\u2019s shout, he felt something wrong in his heart. However, he couldn\u2019t place what was wrong.There were a total of six teams participating in the assessment, so the second match began immediately after Huo Yuhao\u2019s match had ended.The later stages of the Freshman Examination had started from the point that the student redistribution happened; this was also the most important period of time for teams to fight for points. Every extra victory represented an extra possibility of staying. As a result, every team present had already begun to give each match their all.The previous match between Huo Yuhao\u2019s team and Huang Chutian\u2019s team had greatly astonished the other four teams. After asking themselves whether they had that kind of strength, they came to the conclusion that naturally had to do their utmost while competing with the other teams. The first match had basically ended up with both sides receiving damage, so this group\u2019s examination became increasingly complicated.All three matches in the examination\u2019s first round quickly ended, with the results being just as Huo Yuhao had wished for it to be; the other four teams had wasted a considerable amount of energy. After all, they weren\u2019t just drained from today\u2019s matches; they\u2019d used a large amount of energy during the previous day\u2019s four matches as well! They hadn\u2019t recovered enough energy to be in their optimum state to begin with.As this arena\u2019s seeded team, Huo Yuhao\u2019s trio was the first to enter the stage when the second round began. This time, their opponents were three students from Class 4.After their opponents introduced themselves, they took their places. On Huo Yuhao\u2019s side, their positioning had clearly changed. Xiao Xiao was standing in the front, while Huo Yuhao stood behind her. On the other hand, the assault system Wang Dong stood at the very back. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had already sat down on the ground before Wang Yan had even announced the start of the battle; they were actually meditating in the arena.This was the task that Huo Yuhao had entrusted to them; they had to do their best to recover all of their depleted soulforce. The possibility of them winning every match in the round-robin tournament only existed if Wang Dong\u2019s cultivation was restored to its optimum state.\u201cGood luck Xiao Xiao.\u201d Huo Yuhao whispered.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, class monitor. We can definitely do this.\u201dFollowing Wang Yan\u2019s announcement, the assessment began with both parties simultaneously releasing their martial souls. After observing their previous matches, Huo Yuhao\u2019s trio knew that their opponents consisted of three agility system soul masters; they all walked down the path of speed.When Wang Yan announced the start of the match, the three opposing soul masters simultaneously charged out while releasing their martial souls. They three of them went different directions, all of them charging towards Xiao Xiao at the same time.They\u2019d already noticed that Wang Dong was meditating on the ground. When their enemies strongest assault system soul master seemed to have no combat strength at all, how could they give up the opportunity presented to them? Although they\u2019d expended a large amount of energy earlier, they still decided to go all-out.Wang Yan stood to the side of the arena, not relaxing even a little bit as he kept his eyes carefully trained on Huo Yuhao. He believed that Xiao Xiao alone wouldn\u2019t be able to beat three opponents without Wang Dong\u2019s help. After all, their opponents were three agility-type soul masters! He definitely had to see how Huo Yuhao would make a move, as well as how he would release his soul skill.Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes lit up. Although the faintly golden light in his eyes wasn\u2019t especially clear, Wang Yan managed to see it clearly. However, a change in one\u2019s eye color when they released their martial soul was extremely common for soul masters. Wang Yan also noticed the presence of the seemingly-weak white soul ring below his feet, yet he still wasn\u2019t able to tell what Huo Yuhao\u2019s martial soul was.At that moment, the three agility system soul masters had already made their move. The three moved in three different directions, and their speeds were varied. Two of them pounced towards Xiao Xiao, while the third circled around her in an attempt to launch a sneak attack on Huo Yuhao. They were relatively well-coordinated.Xiao Xiao\u2019s gaze was fixed on the area in front of her from the beginning\u2014as if she was completely ignoring them. She then raised her hands above her head, making it look as if she were supporting the heavens. The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron instantly rose up and separated into three, which simultaneously flew out to meet her three opponents.A mind-blowing scene occurred. Without even using her eyes to see what was going on, Xiao Xiao blocked the paths of the three agility system soul masters, using her cauldron that had separated into three. The three agility system soul masters were all at the pinnacle of one-ringed soul masters; they were all around Rank 19. They\u2019d gone all-out, so their movement speed was extremely quick. As a result of this, they simply weren\u2019t able to change their movements fast enough. Thus, all three collided with the three cauldrons.They naturally weren\u2019t as strong as Huang Chutian, who possessed the Herculean Ape beast soul. After colliding with the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldrons, they were immediately sent into a confused state. Furthermore, an even more shocking scene occurred in the back of the arena.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 20.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20.1: The Body Soul\u2019s SecretNot only was the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron quick, but its arrival was also relatively sudden. Thus, the three Agility System Soul Masters weren\u2019t able to unleash their soul skills in time. It was apparent to everyone watching that Xiao Xiao was already extraordinary solely for being able to multitask to this degree. It was impossible for her to still have energy leftover to use a soul skill at the appropriate time while also controlling her martial soul, which had already been divided in three. After all, her opponents would arrive at different times since they were approaching her at different speeds.As a result, Xiao Xiao showed the audience a shocking scene. Three bangs rang out from the cauldrons, unleashing three tremors in their respective places.It all happened the moment they collided with the Agility System Soul Masters; the three Agility System Soul Masters were knocked back from the impact, and directly fainted from the shock. They didn\u2019t have the physique of assault system battle soul masters, thus this period of dizziness was naturally even longer for them than what Huang Chutian had previously experienced. The cauldrons overtook her opponents and struck them once more.\u201cBang, bang, bang.\u201d The three cauldrons approached their respective opponents and struck them once again with precision, causing the three figures to fly out of the arena at the same time.The three black cauldrons rose up and merged back into a single entity above Xiao Xiao\u2019s head, then quietly disappeared into thin air following the retraction of her martial soul.Everyone present fell absolutely silent. This match was even more shocking than the previous match, with Xiao Xiao emerging victorious as the lead figure. The entire fight had taken less than half a minute. By relying on her own strength alone, she\u2019d forcefully stunned her opponents; she hadn\u2019t even let them dash across half the battlefield. She\u2019d faced a three-directional battle and obtained total victory in all three directions.Wang Yan had seen all of the previous assessments that Huo Yuhao\u2019s team had passed with his own eyes. In his heart, the strongest person in this three-man team was naturally Wang Dong, whereas the most mysterious one\u2014who was also the steadiest one\u2014was Huo Yuhao. Xiao Xiao\u2019s tool soul seemed to be pretty good, but relatively speaking, its function leaned more towards that of a part-auxiliary, part-control system tool soul. From his point of view, her tool soul fell behind the other two\u2019s.However, Xiao Xiao had used her own strength to prove to Wang Yan that she also played a decisively important role in this three-man team. A young lady that was merely around eleven years old had actually been able to discern all of her opponents\u2019 attacking routes with such calmness and precision, and then from there had been able to unleash a barrage of attacks. Even a four-ringed control system Soul Ancestor might not necessarily have been able to achieve such a natural and smooth manner of defense, control, and retreat against their opponents. How was it that such a small young lady such as her was able to accomplish such a feat?The other groups had originally thought that they could take take advantage of the fact that Huo Yuhao and his team had exhausted their energy in their first match, but now, that thought completely vanished from their hearts. Their team had two people with the strength to fight a whole team on their own! They were really too valiant.However, Huang Chutian\u2019s team\u2014whose strength had been lacking compared to Huo Yuhao\u2019s team\u2014wasn\u2019t nearly as fortunate. Even though the Lan sisters had awoken from their unconscious state, they had a headache that was so bad it felt as though their heads were going to split apart. They\u2019d also consumed an excessive amount of soul power; to the point that they couldn\u2019t partake in the following matches and had to rely on Huang Chutian alone to continue participating in the competition.Huang Chutian had previously consumed a large amount of his soul power, and had also been injured by Wang Dong\u2019s Wing Guillotine. Moreover, all three of his opponents would be completely focused on him if he were to face them alone. Even though Xiao Xiao had also faced three opponents alone just now, the other party had been distracted, cowering in fear when Huo Yuhao stood behind her.As a result of this, Huang Chutian suffered a tragedy. Although he persevered for a while during the second match of the competition, he was defeated by his opponents in the end. Thus, his team was utterly defeated during the second round.From Huo Yuhao\u2019s three-man team\u2019s point of view, the rest of the competition had entered a virtuous cycle. No one was willing to to forcibly confront them head-to-head in battle, and were all doing their utmost to preserve their strength when contending against them so that they could deal with the others. One could say that Huo Yuhao\u2019s team won the next three rounds with an abnormal level ease. This was especially the case during the fourth match, when Wang Dong had managed to completely recover his soul power. With both him and Xiao Xiao standing in front of Huo Yuhao, their opponents had only symbolically confronted them for awhile before conceding.In the end, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team\u2014representing Freshman Class 1\u2014emerged victorious from all ten matches of the round-robin tournament, obtaining the best score in their group.Huang Chutian\u2019s team had a strong foundation as well. After losing two matches consecutively, the Lan sisters had recovered a little. They managed to reappear on the scene once more, while Huang Chutian displayed his valiant strength again. They were able to win their last three matches consecutively by directly confronting their opponents, who\u2019d already exhausted a lot of their energy from their previous matches. As a result of that, they won seven out of their ten matches in the end. As such, entering the top sixty-four teams shouldn\u2019t be that great of a problem for them.When the round-robin tournament ended, Wang Yan finally couldn\u2019t suppress his curiosity anymore.\u201cHuo Yuhao, you three stay behind for a bit.\u201d The other teams headed back to rest, but Wang Yan held Huo Yuhao\u2019s three-man team back.\u201cTeacher Wang.\u201d Huo Yuhao arrived in front of Wang Yan.Wang Yan nodded in his direction, smiled, then said, \u201cCongratulations to all of you for winning all of your matches in the freshman assessment\u2019s round-robin tournament. I\u2019m afraid that less than ten teams were able to obtain such results during this freshman assessment. You guys are truly very strong. However, I\u2019ve always been very curious about you, Huo Yuhao. Being your team\u2019s leader, what exactly is your martial soul? Even though I wasn\u2019t able to see you do much during your battles, I believe that you\u2019re the core of this team. I\u2019m right about this, aren\u2019t I?\u201dHuo Yuhao went blank for a moment, and then, feeling slightly bashful, said, \u201c Teacher Wang, you flatter me. We were able to obtain such good results all thanks to Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao\u2019s powerfulness. I\u2019m only a supporting character compared to them because, as you can see, I only have a single ten year soul ring.\u201dWang Yan laughed faintly and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be modest. If you weren\u2019t that powerful, I don\u2019t believe that such talented individuals as Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao would be willing to let you be the team leader. Moreover, I also investigated your performance at the Academy during these past three months. Do you know what students call you?\u201dHuo Yuhao went blank for a moment, then shook his head.Wang Yan continued, \u201cAll of them call you \u2018Iron-willed Yuhao\u2019 because you have a willpower akin to that of steel. Your innate talent is the weakest, but you are the most hardworking. That\u2019s what makes you the role model of Freshman Class 1. However, I didn\u2019t ask around about your martial soul because I wanted to personally see what your martial soul and soul skill was for myself, to prove my own abilities. However, I\u2019ve no choice but to admit that I\u2019ve lost; I couldn\u2019t tell what your martial soul was from the beginning of the competition to the end, and I also wasn\u2019t able to find out what soul skill you were using. I saw that white ten year soul ring of yours light up every single match, but I just couldn\u2019t seem to make out what the effect of your soul skill were. Can you clear up my confusion for me?\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cTeacher Wang, my martial soul is the Spirit Eyes, and it\u2019s classified as a mental-type martial soul. As for my soul skill, please let me keep it a secret. After all, we still need to continue participating in the assessment.\u201d His martial soul wasn\u2019t that big of a secret within the Academy, as there were many people who knew about it. If this Teacher Wang sincerely wanted to find out, then he could definitely do so, yet why should he be so petty? As for his soul skill, he wasn\u2019t willing to reveal it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your martial soul is your eyes?\u201d Wang Yan\u2019s response was even greater than Huo Yuhao could\u2019ve imagined. After hearing Huo Yuhao\u2019s explanation, he was so excited that he almost jumped up. He looked at Huo Yuhao with a face full of excitement.Huo Yuhao stared blankly and asked, \u201cTeacher Wang, what\u2019s come over you?\u201dWang Yan grabbed ahold of Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulders with both of his hands and said, \u201cAnswer me first. Is your martial soul your eyes?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dWang Yan inhaled deeply, then interrogated him further with a nervous expression on his face. \u201cThen, do you belong to the Body Sect?\u201dHuo Yuhao shook his head, feeling lost, \u201cThe Body Sect? Teacher Wang, I haven\u2019t heard of them before.\u201dA hint of ecstasy blossomed in Wang Yan\u2019s eyes. He released his grip on Huo Yuhao and said, \u201cWonderful! This is truly wonderful! Haha, I never would\u2019ve thought that our Shrek Academy would obtain such a great bargain. No wonder\u2026 No wonder your role is enormous, even though you only have a ten year soul ring. As it turns out, you actually have a body soul. It really is a pity. If you\u2019d entered the Academy earlier, I would\u2019ve helped you obtain a soul ring at the limit of what you could absorb for your first soul ring, no matter what!\u201dLooking at the slightly mysterious Wang Yan who was chattering away, Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but turn around and look at Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had already encountered the unreasonable Evil Fire Phoenix named Ma Xiaotao before. Teacher Wang had been pretty normal when they met him two days ago! How come he\u2019d suddenly changed? Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but recall the words that Teacher Xiao Ya and his eldest senior brother had said after witnessing the present scene. There weren\u2019t many monster students in Shrek Academy, but there were definitely many monster teachers.Wang Yan inhaled deeply, calming the astonishment and joy in his heart. He then said, \u201cAlright. Huo Yuhao, you guys head back and rest first. I\u2019ll come and look for you again later on.\u201d After he finished speaking, he turned around and hastily left.Looking at his leaving figure, Xiao Xiao couldn\u2019t help but ask in a low voice, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that Teacher Wang is mental, right?\u201dHuo Yuhao frowned and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Teacher Wang like that.\u201dWang Dong went up to Huo Yuhao\u2019s side and said, \u201cHe must\u2019ve lost his composure due to your body soul. I think I\u2019ve also heard that people who possess body souls are extremely rare, but I\u2019ve never heard of something called the \u2018Body Sect\u2019 before.\u201dHuo Yuhao shook his head and smiled. \u201cForget it. I reckon that Teacher Wang will still come and find me again in the future. Shouldn\u2019t we celebrate our total victory? I\u2019ll treat you guys to something good at the dining hall.\u201dXiao Xiao was eager to eat, as she immediately revealed her desire to eat something. \u201cForget about the dining hall. Class monitor, I still haven\u2019t tried your roasted fish. No matter what you say, you have to satisfy this small wish of mine today.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled and said, \u201cNo problem. It\u2019s still early. Let\u2019s return to our dormitories and rest for awhile first; we\u2019ll meet at the dormitory\u2019s gate later tonight. There shouldn\u2019t be anything important tomorrow. In any case, let\u2019s rest and reorganise ourselves before before the start of the elimination matches.\u201dThe three of them returned to the dormitory together. Xiao Xiao went upstairs to the girls\u2019 dormitory\u2014the area that was absolutely restricted to the male students.Huo Yuhao followed Wang Dong back to the dormitory. However, he didn\u2019t expect Wang Dong to look as though he had a lot on his mind.\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Wang Dong, what\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked Wang Dong, who was currently sitting on his bed.Wang Dong muttered irresolutely to himself, saying, \u201cYuhao, I\u2019m thinking about what happened during our first match today. No matter what way I think about it, I still feel that something isn\u2019t right. Even though the power of my thousand year soul ring skill is extremely strong, the other party was using a martial soul fusion skill! I could feel that you focused your Spiritual Detection Sharing and detected the inner part of their soul skill, but it wasn\u2019t to share it with me. Immediately after you did that, their soul skill was defeated. What exactly did you do?\u201dHe raised his head as he spoke and looked at Huo Yuhao with a burning gaze.Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart leapt. He knew that it would be slightly difficult if he wanted to keep things from Wang Dong. Wang Dong was different from Teacher Wang Yan; they both shared a dormitory, and had also cultivated together for such a long time. Wang Dong understood him very well. If he fabricated a lie, perhaps he might be able to bluff his way out of it, but Wang Dong would definitely hold a grudge against him for doing so.As a result of this, Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t reply at first, instead sinking into hesitation and deep thought.It was definitely impossible for him to tell the truth. The existence of the million year soul beast, the Skydream Iceworm, was too mind-blowing. It would affect one in unimaginable ways regardless of who that person was. If he told Wang Dong the truth, he might only be harming him. However, what was he to do if he couldn\u2019t tell him the truth?Suddenly, the words \u2018body soul\u2019 flashed through Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind. His eyes shone, revealing that the fact that he\u2019d come up with an idea.\u201cWang Dong.\u201d Huo Yuhao raised his head once more. There was a somewhat serious gaze in his eyes compared to normal.Wang Dong had never seen Huo Yuhao look this way before, and immediately stared at him while saying, \u201cCould it be that you really have some kind of trump card?\u201dHaving Wang Dong look him straight in the eye, Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but have his mind go blank for a moment, as Wang Dong\u2019s eyes were really just too beautiful. His long eyelashes curled upwards, and the whites of his eyes peeked out from the edges of his jet-black eyes. That curious look in his eyes made those large pair of eyes seem as though they could speak.Huo Yuhao secretly let out a sigh in his heart. No wonder those girls were captivated by him. He really was extremely good-looking!Huo Yuhao lowered his voice and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a trump card. You could say that this is a secret of body souls. I discovered it not too long ago.\u201dWang Dong was astonished. He immediately asked, \u201cThe body soul\u2019s secret?\u201dHuo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cYou mentioned yourself that body souls are extremely rare when we returned just now. The reality of the matter is exactly that. Moreover, our body souls really do have a few unique areas. Since cultivating the Tang Sect\u2019s Purple Demon Eyes, I realised that my Spirit Eyes had definitely started to mutate again. When I focus my first soul skill\u2014Spiritual Detection Sharing\u2014in a particular direction, I can generate a spiritual attack if I focus my spiritual force into a single point and strike out with it. I tried it out against a few small animals in the Academy, and it was really effective. I decided to test it out in battle today because I\u2019d been backed into a really tight corner, but I didn\u2019t know that it would actually be so effective. Maybe\u2026 Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo were actually finding it extremely difficult to use their martial soul fusion skill, and at the same time, they were also being restricted by your thousand year soul skill. Perhaps they only collapsed after the sudden spiritual force attack from my Purple Demon Eyes combined with the accumulation of all of these factors. However, I shouldn\u2019t have had anything to do with them losing consciousness. Have you forgotten what the teacher said before in class? Not only does a martial soul fusion skill consume a lot of energy, but its users will normally be subjected to a rebound. The more powerful the fusion skill is, the greater the rebound. I\u2019m afraid that even the lightest rebound would cause its users to become extremely weak. Since they used their fusion skill today, I reckon that they can\u2019t use it again for a period of time, too.Wang Dong widened his eyes. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that your martial soul was influenced by the Purple Demon Eyes, and that you were actually able to unleash a spiritual attack similar to that from a soul skill?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve just told you my biggest secret.\u201dFrom a certain standpoint, Huo Yuhao wasn\u2019t lying. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the entire truth, because in all honesty, a matter like the Skydream Iceworm would be too shocking. Now that he\u2019d found a suitable explanation for his Spirit Shock, Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that he\u2019d still have to face many different examinations along with his studies in Shrek Academy, and in order to face these examinations, he absolutely couldn\u2019t afford to conceal his Spirit Shock. Even so, he\u2019d have to find an explanation for it sooner or later, and the theory that he\u2019d just given to Wang Dong seemed to be rather suitable.Wang Dong had a look of shock on his face as he looked at Huo Yuhao. \u201cA body soul is actually so awesome? It can even spontaneously evolve and create a skill.\u201dHuo Yuhao scratched his head and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t anything special. Your Radiant Butterfly Goddess naturally possesses the ability to fly, right? The altitude of your flight will also increase as your cultivation increases. This kind of innate ability ought to be considered as your martial soul\u2019s natural characteristic.\u201dAfter pondering what Huo Yuhao had said for a moment, Wang Dong replied, \u201cNope, it\u2019s not the same. You\u2019re right, the innate ability of my Radiant Butterfly Goddess is flying. But that spiritual attack of yours isn\u2019t an innate ability, since it appeared through the evolution of the Purple Demon Eyes. Meaning, your Spirit Eyes has the natural ability to evolve as a mutating body soul. This is something that my Radiant Butterfly Goddess can never compare to. Maybe some other kind of skill will emerge in the future when the Purple Demon Eyes evolve again.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled sheepishly and said, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not any kind of skill either. A more accurate interpretation should be that the Spirit Eyes is continuously increasing my spiritual force. On the other hand, I found a use for it after releasing my spiritual force through my Spirit Eyes with the assistance of the Purple Demon Eyes.\u201dWang Dong nodded and said, \u201cI understand what you mean when you put it this way. It\u2019s just like how I purify or compress my soul power to attack and defend. The only difference between mine and yours is that your spiritual force is formless, so it\u2019s even more difficult to detect it when you use it. I never thought that there would be such a clever way to use soul power.\u201dWhen the doubts in his heart had been answered, there was a somewhat relieved expression in Wang Dong\u2019s beautifully big eyes. However, he quickly became extremely excited again. \u201cYuhao, the martial soul fusion skill that those twins used was really powerful. I\u2019m afraid that we would\u2019ve lost today even if we\u2019d had three soul rings! Even though a fusion skill can\u2019t last long, it\u2019s still immensely powerful, and has an extremely powerful explosive force. It can be said to be the top-ranked skill for us Soul Masters. Their soul power is going to get even stronger in the future, right? If they can sustain their fusion skill for an even longer period of time, then it will definitely be extremely difficult for anyone of the same rank to contend against them. It\u2019d be good if we could also have this kind of skill.\u201dHuo Yuhao burst into laughter and said, \u201cStop dreaming, how could such a good thing happen to us? I still recall that teacher said that the compatibility of one\u2019s martial souls needs to be extremely high before it will be possible for a martial soul fusion skill to appear. The possibility of it happening is so slim that not even a single one will appear among thousands. If and when two people\u2019s martial souls are highly compatible, there will be a reaction between both parties. We\u2019ve lived together for three months already, yet have you had any feelings of compatibility with me before? In any case, I haven\u2019t felt anything.\u201dHuo Yuhao didn\u2019t expect Wang Dong to lower his head as he spoke, as though he was mulling over something. Moreover, his face had become slightly flushed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked, puzzled.Wang Dong seemed to have made up his mind when he raised his head. There was a somewhat strange look in his eyes as he looked attentively at Huo Yuhao, and began to speak in a serious tone. \u201cSince you\u2019ve told me the secret of your body soul, then it\u2019s not right if I conceal the truth any longer. The truth is, I\u2019ve always been concealing my ability, as well as my aura, to some extent.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d It was Huo Yuhao\u2019s turn to be surprised. Wang Dong\u2019s strength spoke for itself. He\u2019d already amply displayed the strength of his martial soul\u2014the Radiant Butterfly Goddess\u2014during the freshman examination. Wang Dong had only used his second soul skill once during the ten matches, but even then, no one had been able to see what exactly it had looked like. Yet, he was now saying that he actually still had a concealed ability. How could Huo Yuhao not be shocked at this?Wang Dong continued, \u201cAlthough you cannot sense the aura on me, when I received that Spiritual Detection Sharing of yours for the first time, I could already feel that your aura was extremely close to mine. The reason that my aura doesn\u2019t extend outwards beyond the scope of my body is because it\u2019s restricted by another power of mine. You\u2019ll only be able to sense the existence of my aura with close bodily contact. Do you want to try it out?\u201d\u201cClose bodily contact? How do you want to get close?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked in a dim-witted manner.Wang Dong suddenly became exasperated. \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it fine to just hug each other for awhile?\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled and said, \u201cIs that so! You should\u2019ve just said so. Do I need to undress?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Wang Dong gave Huo Yuhao a shock.Huo Yuhao laughed and said, \u201cThen come on.\u201d He willingly spread his arms out wide as he spoke, walking towards Wang Dong for a hug.Wang Dong, on the other hand, was slightly dazed when he saw Huo Yuhao getting closer and closer to him. He didn\u2019t have Huo Yuhao\u2019s willingness, which in turn caused his body to unconsciously tense up. His whole being seemed to have entered an especially rigid state.Huo Yuhao hugged Wang Dong in a very natural manner. From his point of view, it was a hug between friends. Wasn\u2019t this very normal? But, when he really hugged Wang Dong, the feeling changed slightly.He suddenly remembered that this was the first time that they\u2019d been so intimately in contact with one another, making him suddenly recall the time when he\u2019d seen Wang Dong\u2019s figure from behind once more.He\u2019d originally thought that Wang Dong\u2019s body would be as muscular and sturdy as his. After all, they were both Soul Masters who painstakingly trained their bodies and cultivated their soul power everyday.However, when he hugged Wang Dong, it was completely different from what he\u2019d imagined. Even though Wang Dong\u2019s body was elastic to the touch, it was also extremely soft; the kind of softness that made him feel as though he had no bones. Moreover, he also had a faint fragrant smell on him. They were about the same height, so when Huo Yuhao hugged Wang Dong, his face was to the side of Wang Dong\u2019s neck. When his chin rubbed against Wang Dong\u2019s slender neck, the smooth and sleek feeling made his mind tremble slightly.Huo Yuhao really wanted to let out a sigh, but he felt that something was wrong. However, at his age, his knowledge in certain areas was still insubstantial, and thus he didn\u2019t think too much of it. He only felt that hugging Wang Dong was much more comfortable than he\u2019d imagined it would be.\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d Wang Dong practically mumbled. He didn\u2019t put his hand on Huo Yuhao\u2019s back and hug him the same way; rather, he only let Huo Yuhao hug him. The feeling that he had was also different from what Huo Yuhao felt. Huo Yuhao\u2019s body was very sturdy, and he also had a heavily masculine scent that was accompanied by the faint scent of sweat that youngsters had. Such an experience made Wang Dong blush deeply.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. Very comfortable.\u201d Huo Yuhao subconsciously answered, based on what he felt.Wang Dong went blank for a moment, but his expression immediately became one of anger after a moment. \u201cStupid, did I let you hug me so that you could feel comfortable? I was letting you feel the aura of my martial soul!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 20.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20.4: The Body Soul\u2019s Secret\u201cUh\u2026 I forgot. I\u2019ll try hugging you again.\u201d Huo Yuhao suddenly felt somewhat embarrassed, but he immediately hugged Wang Dong even tighter.When Wang Dong was hugged with even more strength, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a light groan. He wanted to push him away, but he still decided to endure it. With his hands reluctantly grabbing Huo Yuhao\u2019s clothes and his lips tightly shut, he really looked as if he\u2019d suffered a large grievance.Huo Yuhao slowly gathered his soul power while conscientiously perceiving Wang Dong\u2019s aura, but the first thing he smelled after hugging Wang Dong was the strong fragrance that came off his body. Wang Dong\u2019s body felt somewhat firm, but it was still extremely soft.Gradually, Huo Yuhao felt the undulations of Wang Dong\u2019s aura; it was a strong, radiant aura that felt comfortably warm. As it stimulated his soul power to slowly circulate around Wang Dong\u2019s body, it caused an indescribably comfortable feeling. What made him even more astonished was the fact that an even stronger aura of life had gradually appeared in the midst of the radiant aura.Wang Dong\u2019s aura unexpectedly transformed three times in a row, but every change made him feel even more intimate with Wang Dong. When he felt the final transformation in Wang Dong\u2019s aura, his soul power surprisingly started to circulate along the circulation paths of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.This, this was\u2026Huo Yuhao gradually widened his eyes; Wang Dong was similarly astonished. After Huo Yuhao hugged him, a golden stream slowly appeared on the surface of his skin. Then, it slowly turned a bluish-gold colour before turning dark-gold.The colour of the light changed three times; this was also a strange undulation that Huo Yuhao felt after his aura transformed.In the end, Wang Dong was still more experienced than Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao silently sensed the aura on Wang Dong\u2019s body, while Wang Dong observed everything on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. He discovered that a light had started to appear on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. First, it was a dim, white stream that was soft and profound, and even had a diverse feeling to it. When his aura came into contact with this white aura, an indescribable sense of coziness unexpectedly appeared. Huo Yuhao\u2019s aura seemed to be virtuous, and harmonized perfectly with his own aura.Following that, the aura on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body began to transform. His soft and profound aura gradually turned chilly, and a faint chilliness appeared on his body. However, that chilliness also felt as if it were filled with an endless amount of life; it merged perfectly with the aura of life on Wang Dong\u2019s body. Although one was an aura of life was one that belonged to the natural world, while the other was an inexhaustible amount of life that came from the desolate cold of ancient times, the endless undulations of life that they shared allowed the two auras to combine with each other, further harmonizing them.When the stream surrounding Wang Dong\u2019s body finally turned dark-gold, the aura on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body changed from an icy-blue colour to an insipid grey one.This grey was very, very dull. However, to Wang Dong\u2019s astonishment, the profundity and stability that came from the stream of grey surpassed even the dark-gold on his body.Yes, the aura on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body had expectedly transformed three times in a row as well. Furthermore, it fused perfectly with Wang Dong\u2019s aura each time it transformed.Gradually, Wang Dong\u2019s hands, which were holding onto Huo Yuhao\u2019s clothes, started to rise upwards, hugging him as well. At this moment, there were no distracting thoughts in their minds; they were completely immersed in the wonderful feeling caused by the changes in their respective auras.The three different auras varied unceasingly, while the soul power in their bodies started to circulate. Furthermore, the circulation speed of their soul power became increasingly faster as time passed, while the speed at which the three auras alternated continuously increased.The differently-coloured streams that unceasingly surrounded the two were faintly discernible; in reality, they were very light in colour, so only the two of them could clearly sense their auras.At this moment, the two didn\u2019t understand what this state truly meant to them, but they took advantage of the opportunity that had presented itself and calmly hugged each other, silently perceiving this wonderful and increasingly relaxing feeling.Regardless of whether it was Huo Yuhao or Wang Dong, the two of them felt as if the other party had merged into their body; this feeling was simply too wonderful. Subsequently, their souls felt as if they had ascended to a higher plane.At this moment, a refreshing feeling appeared in Huo Yuhao\u2019s spiritual sea. An extremely familiar voice then echoed out.\u201cHow can your luck be this good? This can\u2019t be true.\u201dThis sudden voice startled Huo Yuhao, slightly awakening him from that strange feeling. He subconsciously wanted to release his hands.That voice hurriedly said, \u201cQuickly hug him, you idiot.\u201dHuo Yuhao immediately tightened his arms. He had an absolute trust towards this voice, because he had already recognised that this voice belonged to no one else but the Skydream Iceworm.Yes, the Skydream Iceworm, who had been in a deep slumber for several months, had actually awakened due to Huo Yuhao\u2019s and Wang Dong\u2019s hug.However, it quickly turned taciturn. After a brief moment, its voice rang out in Huo Yuhao\u2019s mind again, \u201cFrom now on, follow my instructions. I\u2019d never have thought that you\u2019d actually be able to find someone who\u2019s completely compatible with your aura. This Brother really can\u2019t understand it. No, this is practically impossible! However, you\u2019ve done it. This, to you, is something extremely fortunate. You have to grab this chance; it\u2019ll give you two endless prospects in the future.\u201dHuo Yuhao subconsciously thought in his mind; \u201cBrother Skydream, just what do you mean? Wang Dong\u2019s aura is perfectly compatible with mine?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm responded; \u201cSimply put, the current relationship between you two is just like that of a married couple between mortals. On the one hand, we have Yin; On the other hand, we have Yang. We have two completely identical auras, but they respectively represent Yin and Yang. After they fuse completely, a completely harmonized body of Yin and Yang will form. As a result of this, you\u2019ll inevitably release an extremely large amount of power. It seems like you humans call this situation a \u2018Martial Soul Fusion\u2019. In other words, your martial soul and the martial soul of this fellow you\u2019re hugging are perfectly compatible. Furthermore, there are different levels of martial soul fusions. Generally, the possibility of a fusion only exists if your compatibility exceeds fifty percent. However, the compatibility between you two is a hundred percent. Not only that, but this Brother was even astonished by the fact that you two actually have three martial souls that are fusing with each other. This practically isn\u2019t a miracle, it\u2019s perverted!\u201d\u201cThree martial soul fusions?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked blankly. \u201cHow can that be possible? Wang Dong only has one martial soul, and that\u2019s the Radiant Butterfly Goddess! I only have two martial souls, and my second martial soul isn\u2019t even decided yet.\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm unhappily said; \u201cDo you think he\u2019s just going to tell you that he has a few martial souls? If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t even talk about it! As for you, not bad. You originally had one martial soul, but I gave you an Ice martial soul. That\u2019s two. But do you still remember that small grey ball? That unfathomable fellow. Even if he looks very weak, don\u2019t look down on him. I\u2019ve thought about him for a long time, but I still can\u2019t swallow him up. He\u2019s unexpectedly become a strange sort of martial soul. Even with this Brother\u2019s million years of experience, I still can\u2019t fathom what he\u2019s doing. It doesn\u2019t seem to be able to obtain any soul rings, but the innate strength of its soul terrifies even me. Even I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019ll become. But, this martial soul that can\u2019t even be called a martial soul actually managed to fuse with this fellow you\u2019re hugging. Otherwise, why would this Brother be so stunned?\u201dHuo Yuhao astonishedly said, \u201cIf you put it this way, then doesn\u2019t it mean that Wang Dong has triple martial souls as well?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s obvious. Haven\u2019t you ever thought to yourself about this? Even someone possessing twin martial souls wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the suppressive strength of a thousand-year soul ring when he is at the level you humans call \u2018Rank 20\u2019. The reason why he can do it is exactly because he has three martial souls. Each and every one of his martial souls has improved his physique, so that\u2019s how he\u2019s able to possess a thousand-year soul ring when he\u2019s only at Rank 20. Using the descriptions you humans use, this fellow you\u2019re hugging is a super-genius that\u2019s hard to see even in ten thousand years.\u201dHuo Yuhao would absolutely never have thought that Wang Dong would actually possess three martial souls. No wonder, no wonder he told Xiao Xiao that she\u2019d absolutely never be his match in a 1v1 situation. No wonder he possessed such strong self-confidence. He was only a two-ringed Soul Grandmaster, but he had never displayed any feelings of admiration towards anyone. Huo Yuhao had never thought that Wang Dong\u2019s talent was THIS high.\u201cFoolish kid, what do you have to be stunned about? In a sense, you\u2019re someone who has triple martial souls as well! Furthermore, don\u2019t forget this: your first soul ring is an unprecedented million-year soul ring. I can guarantee that you absolutely won\u2019t find a second million-year soul beast on the Douluo Continent. Therefore, even though he\u2019s an exceptional genius, you\u2019re unique and unmatched. Have some confidence in yourself. For example, now. With your Brother as an unprecedented intelligent soul ring, I\u2019ll let you take the initiative when you two undergo martial soul fusion. Relax your body and allow me to do everything.\u201dAs he spoke, a refreshing feeling instantly spread from Huo Yuhao\u2019s brain to his entire body, causing his awareness towards his surroundings to dramatically increase.It was as if he\u2019d used his Mental Detection; everything in the room appeared as a three-dimensional figure. Not only that, but there seemed to be various colors interchanging in the room. Huo Yuhao finally saw the colour changes on Wang Dong\u2019s body. Gold, bluish-gold, dark gold\u2014the three colors flickered alternately. On the other hand, the three colors on his body were white, ice-blue, and grey; the three colors transformed unceasingly.It was just as the Skydream Iceworm had said, the compatibility between their martial souls was simply too high. Whenever the color on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body became white, the color on Wang Dong\u2019s body would turn gold. Then, the ice-blue on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body would be matched with Wang Dong\u2019s bluish-gold; grey was matched with dark-gold.The three pairs of colours were extremely harmonized.However, after the Skydream Iceworm started to move, the colour of Huo Yuhao\u2019s pupil quietly turned a faintly ice-blue color, which was different from the time when it had helped Huo Yuhao fight against Ma Xiaotao\u2019s terrifying Phoenix Flame. This time, the Skydream Iceworm only poured a trace of its strength into Huo Yuhao\u2019s spiritual sea; it didn\u2019t control his body. He only guided Huo Yuhao\u2019s aura, causing it to start producing various transformations.Gradually, it could be seen that the aura on Huo Yuhao\u2019s body had quietly strengthened by quite a bit. During this kind of process whereby martial soul fusion was occurring involuntarily, a transformation in the aura of one party would inevitably cause a subsequent transformation in the aura of the other party.Consequently, Wang Dong\u2019s aura immediately strengthened by quite a bit as well, and at this moment, a strong spiritual undulation was released from Huo Yuhao\u2019s body, simultaneously jolting the two. The two then fainted in what was practically the same instant, causing their bodies to fall onto Wang Dong\u2019s fur-covered bed.The Skydream Iceworm\u2019s cunning voice then rang out, \u201cNext, just watch this Brother. There\u2019s also a distinction between the main user and the secondary user during a martial soul fusion, so let\u2019s take the dominant position and take a few advantages. Eeh, this fella called Wang Dong is actually\u2026 since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll take a few less advantages from him.\u201dStrands of icy-blue thread started to slowly appear on Huo Yuhao\u2019s fingertips, rapidly enveloping his and Wang Dong\u2019s bodies. If you examined them closely, you would realise that these threads were actually completely made from soul power; this was absolutely not Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul power. With his current cultivation, he was simply too far from wanting to materialise his soul power.Gradually, the two who were embracing each other had already turned into an enormous cocoon.After all, the Skydream Iceworm was a silkworm, and forming cocoons was a natural abilities that belonged to silkworms. Currently, their respective auras were completely concentrated within that blue cocoon, unceasingly wandering about their bodies while transforming.The Skydream Iceworm\u2019s pleased voice rang out, \u201cDone. I\u2019ll just let them continue for now. It was a perfect fusion, their compatibility rate was 100%. With the fusion between three martial souls, I don\u2019t believe that grey tortoise won\u2019t be forced out. If you have the ability, come out from your shell and fight three hundred rounds with this Bro. Hmph.\u201dThe dormitory quieted back down after that. Only the large icy-blue cocoon remained, flickering with a mysterious light. There were no soul power undulations outside the cocoon, and the two people within the cocoon were in a deep, deep sleep.Time slowly passed. Today was the only day Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t sell his roasted fish.Xiao Xiao waited for the two for a long while, but she didn\u2019t see them exit the dorms. Just like how male students couldn\u2019t casually enter the girls dorms, female students couldn\u2019t enter the male dorms as they wished! After a moment of helplessness, she could only return to her room to rest.On the other hand, Tang Ya had dragged Bei Bei to the entrance of Shrek Academy in order to wait for Huo Yuhao\u2019s roasted fish. However, they didn\u2019t find Huo Yuhao\u2019s absence strange. After all, they had heard of the freshmen assessment\u2019s system. The assessment system changed every year, and this year\u2019s system was especially fierce! The two even asked around about the trio\u2019s situation within the assessment. Since Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t set up his stall, they naturally assumed that he was too tired from the assessment. Thus, they didn\u2019t think much of it, and decided to go back to their rooms after waiting for a while.They weren\u2019t the only ones who were disappointed by Huo Yuhao\u2019s absence. Today, Jiang Nannan had also queued up early. Unfortunately, she could only return disappointed today.However, nobody knew how important this was for Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. After being schoolmates for three months, the relationship between the two started to have a qualitative change from today onwards.\u2026\u2026Sea God\u2019s Lake, centre island, lakeside.Teacher Wang Yan, who had just carried out the freshmen assessment not long ago, was standing here. Only, he had an exceptionally respectful expression on his face.An old man with disheveled hair was sitting not far away from him, his figure somewhat messy. His originally-white changpao had already been changed into a greyish-brown one which had many holes on it. His naked feet were currently immersed in the cool water of the Sea God\u2019s Lake while his right hand held a massive bottle gourd.The bottle gourd was red-purple in color, and nobody knew what it was made out of. He occasionally took a gulp from it, immediately causing a strong smell of alcohol to spread. His other hand held a fried chicken, ignoring the grease on it. The way he was eating and drinking made one feel that it was extremely joyful.\u201cXuan Lao, this is what happened. These students are still young; they\u2019re freshmen. Even though that\u2019s the case, they\u2019re truly deserving of our attention.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In all other aspects, he looked like a very old man. However, his unexpectedly scarlet eyes were extraordinarily bright; they seemed as if they could steal one\u2019s soul away. But his gaze was slightly disorderly, so much so that he even appeared vacant; it was as if he wasn\u2019t seriously paying attention to Wang Yan\u2019s words.\u201cA Body Soul, interesting.\u201d Xuan Lao mumbled to himself, his voice somewhat rough and aged.Wang Yan asked, \u201cXuan Lao, can a hair martial soul be considered a Body Soul?\u201dXuan Lao spoke as he ate, \u201cIt could be connected to it.\u201dWang Yan replied, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo should deserve your attention; they can even release a fusion skill. If they can even be connected to a Body Soul, their future potential should be quite large.\u201dXuan Lao shook his head and said, \u201cHair? Impossible. You\u2019re known as a person whose research and theoretical skills are very strong, so how could your knowledge of Body Souls be so weak?\u201dWang Yan smiled bitterly. \u201cThere\u2019s simply no one I can perform research on! Also, the information related to Body Souls is simply too limited. The Body Sect hasn\u2019t entered the world for a long time.\u201dXuan Lao chuckled and stood up, his wet feet stepping on the grassy floor. He appeared very casual and relaxed as he said, \u201cThen let me teach you something. To tell how strong a Body Soul is, you have to see how important it is to the body. If the body part used in a Body Soul is more important to the human body, the better it\u2019ll be. Because of that, I\u2019m quite interested in that youth who has the Spirit Eyes. If your hair falls off, it can still be grown back. But what if you lose your eyes? Furthermore, he even possesses a spiritual-type martial soul. In other words, his martial soul actually consists of his eyes and his brain. To be able to see a Body Soul that stands at the peak of all Body Souls within your lifetime, you\u2019re quite lucky. However, I believe that his Body Soul hasn\u2019t been completely stimulated yet. Otherwise, why would he be reduced to using a ten-year soul ring? Go tell Little Ning I\u2019ll be watching the freshmen assessment\u2019s ranking tournament. Ask him to leave a space for me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2026\u2026Night gradually descended. However, the ice-blue halo in Wang Dong\u2019s and Huo Yuhao\u2019s room continued to quietly flicker.Time gradually passed as evening became night. The aura surrounding Huo Yuhao\u2019s and Wang Dong\u2019s body had secretly undergone mysterious changes; the colors of their respective auras had further coiled around each other, fusing. Furthermore, their respective soul power had even travelled in a strange cycle after entering each other\u2019s bodies. In addition to that, each differently colored aura was followed by a different circulation path.If it were anyone else who had entered a martial fusion, they would need at least three days to complete their fusion. However, the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s help managed to help them directly complete the soul power circulation paths during their fusion by utilising the interactions between their auras, allowing them to save an extremely large amount of time.After a wordless night, day gradually arrived.The ice-blue cocoon gradually melted, revealing the situation within. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were still tightly hugging each other, but the differently colored auras surrounding them had already disappeared. Their faces were right next to each other, and they could even smell each other\u2019s breath. They were sleeping very, very soundly.After coming to Shrek Academy, this was the first time that Huo Yuhao hadn\u2019t woken up early to cultivate, as well as the first time he hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast.The outside of the dormitory quickly became lively. The other students living in the dorms had already woken up, and they were rushing about to clean themselves.The noisy sounds gradually affected the two who were sleeping soundly, causing Wang Dong to wake first.\u201cUgh.\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s soft groan sounded somewhat lethargic, yet also seemed slightly delicate. As he slowly opened his eyes, he saw Huo Yuhao right next to him.He was left stunned for a moment. After moving his body for a moment, he realised that he\u2019d been tightly hugged by Huo Yuhao; their chests were stuck to one another\u2019s tightly. Huo Yuhao\u2019s body even seemed to be giving off a warm feeling.Wang Dong only knew that he had slept for a very, very long time. He had never felt something like this before, so at this moment, besides a slight sense of peculiarity in his heart, he actually felt panicked.\u201cHuo Yuhao, wake up.\u201d He struggled lightly against Huo Yuhao\u2019s embrace, wanting to free himself from Huo Yuhao\u2019s hands. However, staying in that position for too long a time had caused the two\u2019s bodies to slightly stiffen up. Without even talking about Huo Yuhao\u2019s hand, even his own hand felt slightly numb as he tried to pull them back to himself.\u201cAh?\u201d Huo Yuhao finally woke up from his sleep, discovering Wang Dong, who was in front of him, with a glance. The two were simply too close to each other; the only reason why their noses weren\u2019t stuck together was because Wang Dong had deliberately raised his head. But, Huo Yuhao felt the sensation of a long pair of eyelashes as Wang Dong blinked.\u201cWhy\u2019re you so close to me?\u201d Huo Yuhao spoke subconsciously. As he spoke, his warm breath covered Wang Dong\u2019s face.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Dong flew into a rage. He suddenly started struggling, finally withdrawing his arms. Then, he used his hands to grab Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulders, pulling himself backwards while raising his soft legs and shoving them between him and Huo Yuhao, creating a gap between the two of them.When Huo Yuhao woke up, he subconsciously loosened his grip on Wang Dong\u2019s hands. But after being separated from Wang Dong by his legs, he finally woke up from his sleep. However, Wang Dong woke him up even more in the next moment\u2026Within the dorm room, the two each had a single bed to themselves. The sudden strength released by Wang Dong\u2019s long legs immediately kicked Huo Yuhao away, causing him to land on the ground with a \u201cputong\u201d.\u201cAiya, Wang Dong, what\u2019re you doing?\u201d Huo Yuhao was in agony due to being fiercely kicked to the ground by Wang Dong while he\u2019d been completely defenceless. This immediately caused an indignant expression to appear on his face.Wang Dong was slightly breathless as he sat up. After straightening his messy clothes, he angrily said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking me what I was doing? Why were you sleeping on my bed last night?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Only then did Huo Yuhao discover that he\u2019d been kicked off Wang Dong\u2019s bed. He remained silent for a brief moment, thinking to himself, \u201cBro, oh Bro, you\u2019ve doomed me. Don\u2019t you know how mysophobic that guy is? Why would you make me sleep together with him?\u201dAlthough he thought this in his heart, he still argued, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for this. Look, didn\u2019t you sleep with me as well?\u201dWang Dong snorted angrily. Just as he was about to reply to Huo Yuhao, a piercing ring suddenly rang out, jolting both of them.\u201cI forgot, it\u2019s time for class. Crap, we\u2019re late. Quick.\u201d Huo Yuhao instantly jumped up, directly running outside with Wang Dong in tow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus, he ran alongside Huo Yuhao.The two didn\u2019t have time to eat breakfast, nor did they have the time to shower. Instead, they quickly ran towards the teaching blocks. They were extremely clear about Zhou Yi\u2019s temper; was there any difference between being late for class and committing suicide?Their appearances were truly somewhat wretched. Wang Dong was still fine. At the very least, he had still managed to straighten his clothes when he\u2019d kicked Huo Yuhao earlier. Huo Yuhao, on the other hand, was in an even more sorry situation. His school shirt was half tucked into his pants. Not only that, his hair was also messy, and two of his shirt buttons were unbuttoned, exposing his bronze chest. As he ran, the wind blew his clothes around.However, they didn\u2019t have the time to worry about that. Right now, all they wanted to do was to rush to the classroom with the utmost haste and extinguish the flames of Zhou Yi\u2019s anger; they were already late!After a minute, they arrived at Class One\u2019s entrance.\u201cReporting in.\u201d Huo Yuhao shouted out, full of energy.\u201cReporting in.\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s voice was softer than his, so much so that it seemed like he didn\u2019t have any energy at all. He stole a glance at Huo Yuhao, a somewhat complicated expression in his eyes. Then, he ruthlessly raised his hand and pinched Huo Yuhao\u2019s back.Huo Yuhao\u2019s expression immediately changed, but seeing that Zhou Yi had already walked over to them, he forcefully held in the scream that almost left his mouth.The other students were already present. Seeing Huo Yuhao\u2019s sloppy appearance, a smile unexpectedly flashed through Zhou Yi\u2019s eyes. However, the always meticulous Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t manage to notice it as a result of the severe pain from his back.\u201cYou two, what happened? Come in first.\u201d Zhou Yi waved over to the two.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong hurriedly walked into the class, and Wang Dong even shut the door considerately.Xiao Xiao, who had already arrived earlier, couldn\u2019t help but widen her eyes as she saw their wretched appearances. Her mouth moved, but she didn\u2019t say anything. It looked as if she was asking, \u201cHeavens! What were the two of you doing last night?\u201dThe gazes of the entire class were focused on the two, especially on the monitor whose clothes were untidy.Zhou Yi used her ever-cold voice to ask, \u201cMy dear class monitor, tell me. What were you two doing?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 sorry, Teacher Zhou. We overslept.\u201d Huo Yuhao replied with an embarrassed look on his face. Now, all they could do was to take the initiative to apologize for their mistakes. Furthermore, they could only receive whatever punishment Zhou Yi gave them without complaining.\u201cWho slept with who? You actually managed to oversleep?\u201d Zhou Yi made a rare joke.Huo Yuhao was stunned, while Wang Dong\u2019s face instantly reddened. This was because she\u2019d hit upon the truth.The whole class continued to remain silent, but this silence only lasted for three seconds. Right after that, the class burst into laughter.Wang Dong lowered his head, wishing he could find a whole to jump into. This was embarrassing, simply too embarrassing! Having just noticed Huo Yuhao\u2019s untidy clothes, he just wanted to slap him to death! This bastard, he made me lose all my face.Unexpectedly, Zhou Yi smiled as well. Although the smile on her face looked even uglier than someone crying, Huo Yuhao was certain, certain that she was smiling.Zhou Yi raised her hand, and her authority as a super-teacher undoubtedly manifested itself, causing the entire class to quieten immediately. However, Zhou Yi ignored the smiling expressions in their eyes.\u201cEnough. Return to your seats.\u201d Zhou Yi waved her hands, forgiving the two in a completely unprecedented manner.\u201cAh?\u201d Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong subconsciously raised their heads, thinking they had heard wrongly.Zhou Yi glared at them, \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve overslept to the point where you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying?\u201dOnly then did Huo Yuhao understand what she had said. Pulling Wang Dong\u2019s sleeve, the two gloomily walked over to their usual seats. However, they didn\u2019t feel like raising their heads after feeling the surrounding looks of ridicule.However, it was fortunate that they were still freshmen, where everyone was only eleven or twelve-year-old students. They only treated the issue of two people sleeping together as a joke; they didn\u2019t think too much of it. But if this reached the ears of the outer courtyard\u2019s upperclassmen, and was distorted by the words of a few fujoshis, it could become an even bigger scandal.After walking back to the teaching podium, Zhou Yi indifferently said, \u201cAfter three days, the freshmen assessment has finally ended. The final results were already tallied last night.\u201dAfter hearing her words, the students of Class 1 were filled with energy; not every group was as absolutely confident they had passed the assessment like Huo Yuhao\u2019s group.A smile that nobody dared to compliment unexpectedly appeared on Zhou Yi\u2019s face for the second time today. \u201cI have no choice but to admit that you\u2019ve worked very hard. You\u2019ve given me face. Out of our twenty-two teams from Class 1, all of you have passed the freshmen assessment. I\u2019m very happy about this.\u201d\u201cBang\u2014\u2014\u201d The entire class was filled with boiling excitement; cheering sounds filled every corner of the classroom. This time, Zhou Yi didn\u2019t stop them. She smiled as she watched the excited cheering of the kids in front of her.They truly had the qualifications to start cheering! Last night, all of the proctors as well as the teachers in charge of the ten classes had worked together to tally the results of the assessment.Practically all the proctors stated that the students from Class 1 were much more resilient than the students from the other classes. During the intensive assessment competition, they had all displayed a frightening amount of willpower and combat strength; out of all the classes, they were the class that had turned the tides the most times during the assessment. Most outstandingly, the students from Class 1 practically won all the matches that involved opponents who were evenly matched with them.Ever since she had become a teacher at Shrek Academy, this was the first time Zhou Yi had received public praise. Originally, the students in Class 1 had been the fewest in number among the ten classes. But after the round-robin tournament, over half of the students who had participated in the assessment had been eliminated. As a result of this, Class 1 was now the class who had the greatest number of students in Year 1.No matter how strict Zhou Yi was, everyone was feeling very happy today. This was also the main reason why Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had been forgiven even though they had turned up late to class.\u201cOkay, quiet down.\u201d After letting the class cheer for a long time, Zhou Yi motioned for them to quiet down.\u201cThe only way for you to guarantee that you\u2019ll stay in the academy is to pass the assessment. At the very least, you won\u2019t be easily eliminated for another year. However, it\u2019s only one more year. If you become lazy in the future, I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to continue seeing you after your second year here. Furthermore, it\u2019s not such a big deal to be able to pass the freshmen assessment. Out of the twenty-two teams here, fourteen teams haven\u2019t finished their freshman assessment yet, because you\u2019ve entered the top 64. You\u2019ll still have to go through the knock-out competition, which is where you can truly prove how outstanding you are.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no need to mention the fact that all twenty-two teams from their class had passed the assessment, but there were actually fourteen teams that had entered the top 64. In other words, their class alone occupied over 20% of the top 64 spots; the percentage of students from Class 1 who managed to enter the knockout round was double that of the other classes. With a result like this, they truly deserved to be arrogant!Zhou Yi continued speaking. \u201cDuring the round-robin tournament, a total of six teams managed to win every single match they participated in. Our class only has one such team. Originally, I was planning to give them a reward, but unfortunately, they turned up late to class. Hence, their merits are equal to their demerits, so I won\u2019t reward them or punish them.\u201dOnce again, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong became the center of attention of the entire class. The two of them truly felt depressed! They then looked each other in the eye. Their gazes looked normal, but both of them were stunned.When they looked at each other, they clearly sensed the soul power in their bodies undulate for a moment. This caused a sense of intimacy that was hard to describe to involuntarily arise, so much so that they felt like hugging each other again.At this moment, the two simultaneously thought of the reason why they had ended up on Wang Dong\u2019s bed after hugging each other.Wang Dong muttered, \u201cCould we have succeeded?\u201dHuo Yuhao was more certain of the answer than Wang Dong. After all, he had talked to the Skydream Iceworm! He naturally couldn\u2019t appear too certain, but he couldn\u2019t help but expose a fervent look in his eyes.\u201cIt could be. Shall we try it out after class?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dThe two nodded at each other at what seemed to be the same instant. A hard-to-describe sense of understanding involuntarily arose between the two, and although Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mental Detection hadn\u2019t been activated, the two of them seemed to be able to predict their counterpart\u2019s next move. This feeling made them feel as if they were twins; it felt wonderful, yet extraordinarily peculiar.\u201cThump\u2014\u2014\u201d A loud sound jolted the two from that peculiar feeling. The two simultaneously raised their heads, just in time for them to see Zhou Yi\u2019s angry face.Oops\u2026 their absent-mindedness during class had been caught.\u201cYou two, go outside and start running with chainmail on you. You\u2019re not allowed to stop until the bell rings. You two just achieved something, but you\u2019re already so satisfied with yourselves!\u201dThis isn\u2019t fair! The two simultaneously cried out in their hearts. However, they knew that as long as Teacher Zhou decided on something, there was no way she would change her mind. Helplessly, they could only leave the classroom with a bitter look on their faces and return to their dorms to get their chainmail.As she saw the two leave dejectedly, Zhou Yi snorted, \u201cAll of you, remember this. No matter how successful you are, you must always have a humble and cautious heart. Not only can arrogance cause you to deteriorate, it can also take your life. The knockout round will start tomorrow, so I\u2019ll give you a simple explanation regarding its main parts.\u201dThe two of them were doomed to not listen to Zhou Yi\u2019s explanation, but it was fortunate that Xiao Xiao was still there. Although she didn\u2019t explicitly state it, Zhou Yi intended Xiao Xiao to pass the information on to them.\u201cI\u2019m blaming you for this.\u201d Once they left the teaching block, Wang Dong exploded, speaking angrily to Huo Yuhao.Huo Yuhao had a wronged expression on his face as he said, \u201cHow can you blame me for this? You were the one who insisted on me hugging you yesterday.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d A cold light appeared in Wang Dong\u2019s eyes as he looked at Huo Yuhao with clenched teeth.\u201cUh\u2026 we\u2019re a team, we should be united.\u201d Huo Yuhao solemnly looked towards Wang Dong, who already had his fists clenched.\u201cUnity my ass. You\u2019re the reason why I got punished, so you tell me what you\u2019re going to do about it.\u201d Wang Dong said angrily, \u201cAlso, you slept on my bed last night. What\u2019re you going to do about that?\u201dHuo Yuhao patted Wang Dong\u2019s shoulder while putting his hand around his neck, \u201cOkay, okay. We\u2019re all brothers, so we shouldn\u2019t bicker over a small matter like this. Okay? We should just quickly finish Teacher Zhou\u2019s task, just in case she flips out on us.\u201dIn the instant Huo Yuhao placed his hand around Wang Dong\u2019s neck, Wang Dong was immediately stunned. Huo Yuhao\u2019s voice had also become softer. After speaking, the two completely stopped moving. Huo Yuhao subconsciously looked towards his hands; Wang Dong did as well.\u201cWhy would this happen?\u201d The two spoke in unison.Correct, a strange thing had happened to the two. When Huo Yuhao\u2019s hand touched Wang Dong\u2019s neck, it seemed like the two had been connected. Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul power had flowed into Wang Dong\u2019s body in a very natural manner, while Wang Dong\u2019s soul power had slowly flowed back. It was as if the two had formed a complete whole. Although the connection was only formed from Wang Dong\u2019s neck and Huo Yuhao\u2019s hand, that feeling was very clear.\u201cThat\u2019s not right, let\u2019s try it again.\u201dHuo Yuhao first pulled back the hand he was holding Wang Dong with, before gripping Wang Dong\u2019s two hands with his own hands.Wang Dong\u2019s hands were unusually soft, and they were extremely smooth; it was very comfortable to hold them. However, the present Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t have the time to fully experience this feeling.In the instant the two held hands, the soul power from Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Technique started moving. It flowed rapidly from his right hand into Wang Dong\u2019s left hand. Then, his left hand generated what seemed to be an absorption force that absorbed Wang Dong\u2019s soul power into his body. The soul power of the two rapidly circulated, and the speed of this circulation was at least double the speed of Huo Yuhao\u2019s previous circulation speed.Wang Dong was a genius among geniuses in the first place, so he immediately realised what had happened. \u201cTry controlling it for a bit. Try and pour it into your body.\u201d As he spoke, he pulled back his left hand. This way, only his soul power was being transferred to Huo Yuhao\u2019s body.Immediately, Huo Yuhao felt that his soul power was explosively increasing at a astonishing rate; an unprecedented feeling of power filled his entire body.As a result of being remoulded by the Mysterious Water Pill and nourished by the Mysterious Heaven Technique, the endurance of his passageways had already reached the apex of what could be achieved by his peers. Although a large amount of soul power had entered his body, he didn\u2019t feel bloated at all.An imperceptible sense of understanding had already appeared between the two of them. Huo Yuhao immediately activated his Mental Detection, enveloping Wang Dong within it.For the sake of immersing himself in this bizarre feeling, Wang Dong shut his eyes. Immediately, he discovered that the range of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mental Detection was increasing at an astonishing rate.Originally, Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mental Detection could exceed a range of sixty metres when it was activated in a spherical manner; it could reach a hundred metres or so when it was focused in one direction. However, his Mental Detection quickly reached a radius of a hundred metres as a result of Wang Dong\u2019s additional soul power.As the two stared stupefied at each other, Huo Yuhao\u2019s voice trembled slightly, \u201cWang Dong, have you heard of soul masters who can share their soul power with another person who they fused their martial soul with?\u201dWang Dong blankly shook his head and muttered, \u201cWhy would this happen? Don\u2019t tell me that our attempt yesterday actually succeeded?\u201dHuo Yuhao had an excited expression as he said, \u201cShall we find a place to try it out?\u201dRight at this moment, an angry voice rang out from the window of the nearby teaching block: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you two wearing your chainmail and running? Why\u2019re you holding hands and courting each other?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 22.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22.1: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial Souls\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you two wearing your chainmail and running? Why\u2019re you two holding hands and romancing one another?\u201dStartled, the two hurriedly let go of each other, then ran back towards their dorm rooms. Their hearts were currently beating extremely quickly, and it naturally wasn\u2019t because of Zhou Yi\u2019s shout, but because of the strange change that had occurred to their martial souls!The two rushed back to their dorms. As they looked at each other, they could see the trace of astonishment that was present in their eyes. Right, the matter that had just occurred was simply too unusual. Regardless of whether it was Huo Yuhao, who had studied a large amount of info with regards to soul masters after entering Shrek Academy, or Wang Dong, whose knowledge was expansive, this was the first time they had learnt of anything like this; this clearly exceeded the territory of ordinary soul masters.Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cIt seems like our nap last night wasn\u2019t for nothing!\u201d\u201cPah.\u201d Wang Dong glared at him. But then, he quickly raised his soft, slender hands and said, \u201cLet\u2019s try again.\u201dHuo Yuhao was also anxious to verify the matter that had just occurred to them. Hence, he hurriedly held hands with Wang Dong.As the four hands joined together, the flow of soul power immediately restarted. Their soul power were completely different; The soul power that came from Huo Yuhao\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Technique was honest, moderate, gentle, and unconstrained, while Wang Dong\u2019s soul power was much more overbearing; it had a threatening and noble aura to it.If Huo Yuhao\u2019s soul power could be compared to a gentle and honest youth, Wang Dong\u2019s soul power was a noble, aloof, and overbearing young mistress.However, these two soul power with completely different temperaments had currently formed a cycle, flowing perfectly through their bodies. Furthermore, these two soul power were actually fusing quietly throughout this process, intimately sharing everything with each other. During this process, there were no conflicts during this process; it was just as if they had originally belonged to a single body.Huo Yuhao was left in a slightly better state; after all, the soul power that came from his Mysterious Heaven Technique was extremely gentle in the first place. On the other hand, Wang Dong was filled with astonishment. He was fully aware of how domineering and fierce his soul power was, as well as how strongly it excluded other things from itself. But, his current situation had vastly exceeded his scope of knowledge.During the brief moment where the circulation occurred, the two felt extremely relaxed and refreshed. Clearly, it would be much faster for them to cultivate in this state rather than cultivating individually. Furthermore, they clearly knew that this was just the beginning. Their soul power had fused so perfectly, so how could the benefits that arose from this be as simple as allowing them to cultivate together?\u201cLet\u2019s go, we should go run first. We can study this further after we get back tonight.\u201d Huo Yuhao took the initiative to let go of Wang Dong\u2019s hands. Then, he put his chainmail on and ran outside.After listening to his words, Wang Dong was slightly startled, and his mouth slightly twitched for a moment. Huo Yuhao\u2019s words, in addition to how he had mysteriously hugged him for an entire night, caused a few traces of ambiguity to reluctantly appear in his heart. After making a fist behind his back, he put his chainmail on and caught up to himThey had already been running with chainmail for three months, so doing it now was a walk in the park for them. The two diligently ran till the bell rang, and only when Xiao Xiao came to the field to find them did they stop. When she arrived, Xiao Xiao informed them that Teacher Zhou had already left.Huo Yuhao\u2019s entire body was covered with sweat, while Wang Dong, who had a higher cultivation, deliberately made it so that he wasn\u2019t sweating at all.\u201cHow was it? Did Teacher Zhou say anything?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked as he panted.Xiao Xiao shrugged her shoulders. \u201cNothing much, really. She just cheered everyone up and gave us some encouragement. After that, she analysed the situation of our opponents. It\u2019s going to be extremely difficult for us to become champions. It seems like the round-robin tournament was only a rehearsal. On the other hand, our Shrek Academy\u2019s never lacked geniuses!\u201dAs he looked at her somewhat worried expression, Wang Dong said, \u201cWhat? Even our twin martial soul genius doesn\u2019t have any confidence in herself?\u201dXiao Xiao curled her lips and said, \u201cConfidence is something I naturally have, but I have to say that there are some people who\u2019re more talented than us. Teacher Zhou told us that out of the five teams which achieved complete victories, three had three-ringed Soul Elders. How confident are you againsts three-ringed soul masters?\u201d\u201cSoul Elders?\u201d The two simultaneously cried out with a look of inconceivability on their faces.Xiao Xiao smiled bitterly. \u201cExactly. Why else would I be so unconfident?\u201d\u201cWhat did Teacher Zhou say?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked.\u201cWhen she was talking about those three teams, Teacher Zhou didn\u2019t seem to be too happy about them. It looked like she had just obtained that piece of information. Previously, those three classes had never told anyone that they had students who were Soul Elders. Also, those three students are just like you; they\u2019re specially invited students.\u201d Xiao Xiao replied.Hearing this, Wang Dong laughed and looked towards Huo Yuhao. \u201cSee, you\u2019re all specially invited students, so why is there such a large gap between you and them?\u201dHuo Yuhao was speechless for a moment before saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no use talking about this now, the key thing we need to do now is to think of how we can beat them.\u201d\u201cRight now, all we can do is to do our best and let destiny settle everything for us. Those three are the respective team leaders of their own teams, so it\u2019s obvious that they won\u2019t be easy to deal with. Think about it: they were able to break into the three-ringed realm before the age of twelve. Just how strong are their martial souls? Also, there\u2019s definitely a clan that\u2019s fully supporting them from behind, so their soul rings are definitely at their limit. Even if they aren\u2019t as perverted as Wang Dong, who got a thousand-year soul ring as his second soul ring, they shouldn\u2019t be too far off. In my opinion, even Teacher Zhou doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s looking too good for us. I think that we can only aim for fourth place,\u201d Xiao Xiao said.Wang Dong snorted. \u201cWhat if they have three rings? Are Soul Elders unbeatable? We have our advantages as well; You have your twin martial souls, and I haven\u2019t used all of my strength yet. In addition to Huo Yuhao\u2019s spiritual martial soul, the three of us might not lose to anyone else if we team up together.\u201dXiao Xiao said, \u201cDo you think that I don\u2019t want us to become champions! Only the top three get a substantial reward; fourth place doesn\u2019t get any good rewards. However, our combined strength truly isn\u2019t as good as theirs. Think about it, the teammates of a Soul Elder-level student will at least be at the Soul Grandmaster level, just like us. We do have our own strong points, but the only way for us to have a chance is for the class monitor to break into Rank 20 and get another strong spiritual-type soul skill.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True, we might be weaker than our opponents, but if we lose all confidence now, we won\u2019t have any chance at all. Xiao Xiao, think about it. When we were facing the Lan sisters\u2019 fusion skill, weren\u2019t we put in a very difficult situation? But we still managed to achieve victory in the end. The fusion skill they used might not be weaker than a Soul Elder\u2019s soul skill; it could even exceed it in power. However, we still managed to overcome it. Different people have their own specialties, and likewise, we have our own. Our advantage lies in the fact that we haven\u2019t used all our strength, and we only have one objective. That is, to become champions.\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s words seemed to have rekindled Xiao Xiao\u2019s confidence. She nodded her head lightly. \u201cFight! No matter where we get to, that\u2019ll be whatever we get. Let\u2019s do this!\u201dHuo Yuhao extended his right hand, and Wang Dong quickly placed it above his before Xiao Xiao could. Lastly, Xiao Xiao placed her hand on Wang Dong\u2019s hand.\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be champions.\u201dHuo Yuhao said, \u201cXiao Xiao, it seems like I\u2019ll have to owe you roasted fish for a few more days. The coming knock-out round is simply too important to us, so no matter what, we have to do our best and use these few days to increase our cultivations. Even if we can only increase it by a strand, it\u2019ll increase our chances of victory by a large amount. Once the knock-out tournament is over, I\u2019ll take care of the roasted fish. I won\u2019t be setting up my store for these few days, so let\u2019s first concentrate on cultivating before talking about it.\u201dXiao Xiao giggled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay interest for an owed debt. Class monitor, I\u2019m blaming this on you anyway, so I won\u2019t pay you when I eat your roasted fish in the future.\u201dHuo Yuhao chuckled. \u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll treat you to some fish.\u201dXiao Xiao said, \u201cTeacher Zhou said that we\u2019ll have to gather at the Assessment Area before the bell rings tomorrow. Also, she told me to tell you that you\u2019re not allowed to be late. The first thing we need to do is to pray for luck. However, Teacher Zhou said that teams who achieved a clean sweep during the round-robin tournament will have some preferential treatment during the first two rounds of the knock-out tournament; we won\u2019t meet each other. This is the only good thing we got from the round-robin tournament. As long as we do what we usually do, there should be no problem for us to enter the top sixteen. After that, it\u2019ll just depend on us.\u201dHuo Yuhao said, \u201cThis is actually some good news. Right, before we do anything else, I\u2019m sweaty, so I\u2019m going back to shower before grabbing a meal.\u201dXiao Xiao said, \u201cThen, I won\u2019t wait for you two. I\u2019ll go to the canteen first, see you tomorrow.\u201d After speaking, she waved towards the two of them and left.Huo Yuhao turned towards Wang Dong, slightly furrowing his brows. \u201cSeems like it won\u2019t be easy to get a good result in the knock-out tournament. Let\u2019s go back to the dorms, and after I shower and change, we can go eat. Then, we can go think about this issue regarding our martial soul fusion.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d Wang Dong nodded. However, he clearly seemed somewhat taciturn, to the point where he looked blank and lifeless; nobody knew what he was thinking. After returning to their dorm room, Huo Yuhao took a clean set of clothes as well as a towel and went to shower, while Wang Dong sat by himself on his bed.\u201cThump.\u201d The door shut. Wang Dong subconsciously looked towards the door, gradually exposing a slightly complicated look in his blank eyes.Earlier, he hadn\u2019t had any time to settle his debts with Huo Yuhao regarding the issue of sleeping together with him due to them turning up late for class. Now, Huo Yuhao had already seemed to have disregarded it as an unimportant issue, but Wang Dong was feeling completely differently.I, I actually slept with him for an entire night. Moreover, it even seems like we\u2019ve completed a martial soul fusion, and not a normal one at that.Wang Dong himself didn\u2019t know how he was currently feeling; he felt that he was slightly confused, confused to the point where he didn\u2019t know what to do.Time always flies by when one is distracted. Not long after he left, Huo Yuhao returned after a refreshing shower. As he entered, he brought a faintly fragrant smell with him that came after his shower. As he raised his head, Wang Dong saw his unusually bright pupils.Huo Yuhao still hadn\u2019t noticed the change in Wang Dong\u2019s psyche. He beckoned, \u201cLet\u2019s quickly go for a meal and study our martial soul fusion after coming back. Perhaps we\u2019ll have to rely on it if we want to get a good result in the end.\u201d The current him was completely focused on the freshmen assessment\u2019s knock-out tournament.Wang Dong\u2019s somewhat perplexed emotions seemed to have found an objective. Nodding his head, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Since the matter had already occurred, there was no use in thinking too deeply about it. He would first work hard during this assessment and get a good ranking before talking about it. When Xiao Xiao spoke about the appearances of the few Soul Elders, Wang Dong\u2019s fighting spirit had also been aroused.He firmly believed that his talent wasn\u2019t lacking compared to those Soul Elder-levelled students. Only, he had been extremely lazy during his youth, and had been completely unwilling to cultivate, which was the reason why he was only at his current level. In his opinion, ranks didn\u2019t mean everything; by beating them, he could prove that he was the most outstanding student in Shrek Academy.After thinking about this, his heart untangled itself. Following Huo Yuhao to the canteen, he immediately ate a gargantuan meal. Because they went to the canteen relatively late, there was practically no one left when they finished eating.After returning to their room, Huo Yuhao locked the door, preventing anyone from disturbing them while they were cultivating. At the same time, he placed a \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 sign on the outside of the door. Every dorm room had this sign; and as long as a student hung it up, even teachers wouldn\u2019t easily disturb them, as this sign signified that the students inside were cultivating.However, Huo Yuhao\u2019s formerly normal behaviour seemed to make the current Wang Dong somewhat embarrassed. But he quickly adjusted himself, and by the time Huo Yuhao turned around, he had already regained his composure.\u201cHow\u2019re we going to start?\u201d Wang Dong asked him.Huo Yuhao replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll try to cultivate while holding our hands for a while first. This way, we can increase the effects and be more familiar with the fusion between our soul power. Then, we\u2019ll try to use the fused soul power to strengthen each and every one of our soul skills. Later at night, we\u2019ll leave the academy and test out our fusion skill there.\u201dWang Dong curled his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re actually quite orderly with your plans.\u201dHuo Yuhao laughed. \u201cNaturally. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m the class monitor. Isn\u2019t being orderly something that should be extremely normal for me? Come.\u201d As he spoke, he walked over to Wang Dong\u2019s bed, intending to sit on it.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Wang Dong pushed his body away.Huo Yuhao suspiciously asked, \u201cI\u2019m trying to cultivate! How are we going to cultivate if we don\u2019t sit cross-legged?\u201dHowever, Wang Dong stood up and pointed at Huo Yuhao\u2019s bed. \u201cWe\u2019ll cultivate on your bed.\u201dHuo Yuhao was speechless. \u201cIf you\u2019re not afraid of a sore butt, I have nothing to say.\u201dWang Dong clearly saw that Huo Yuhao\u2019s expression had turned somewhat unsightly. At this moment, Huo Yuhao was truly somewhat unhappy. In his opinion, the two of them had already been friends for a long time, but Wang Dong still continued to bicker and bicker on; this was very petty-minded to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 22.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22.3: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial SoulsHowever, Wang Dong insisted on doing it his way, so the two sat on Huo Yuhao\u2019s bed. The instant he sat down, Wang Dong felt somewhat gloomy; when compared to his fur mattress, this completely hard wooden board couldn\u2019t be considered comfortable in the least! However, he could only endure it. They had accidentally slept on his bed last night, and Wang Dong didn\u2019t want to let Huo Yuhao on his bed again.Huo Yuhao was still a very magnanimous person. After feeling dissatisfied for ashort period of time, he had already regained his composure. In his heart, he thought, \u201cWhatever. Different people have their own habits, but I should nevertheless respect everyone.\u201d Thinking this, the small trace of resentment in his heart disappeared.As Wang Dong looked at Huo Yuhao, he noticed that Huo Yuhao was also looking at him, and his heart unknowingly felt somewhat hurried and apologetic. He hurriedly raised his palms. \u201cLet\u2019s start. We\u2019ll follow your plan. We\u2019ll cultivate until dinnertime and see what happens.\u201dHuo Yuhao had raised his palms as well, placing them opposite Wang Dong\u2019s. Once the two touched each other, their soul power were immediately attracted, causing them to fuse together. After a mere single circulation in their bodies, the two soul power completed the fusion process. Following that, a fused dual-attribute soul power was now flowing through their bodies.Since discovering this odd matter in the morning, they hadn\u2019t had enough time to study it carefully. As they cultivated calmly now, a different feeling gradually appeared.Just as they had previously felt, the increase in their soul power when the two cultivated with their hands held together was extremely quick. Simply put, their individual soul power were increasing at a rate that was equivalent to that of two people put together.In other words, if the amount of soul power Huo Yuhao gained after cultivating for two hours was represented by one unit, and the amount of soul power Wang Dong gained after cultivating for the same time was represented by 1.2 units, when the two cultivated together, the mixture of their two soul power would be strengthened together, and not only would it increase the circulation speed of their soul power, but the amount of soul power they would each gain within two hours would be represented by 2.2 units.This way, Huo Yuhao\u2019s cultivation speed would more than double, while Wang Dong\u2019s cultivation speed would nearly double. The person who benefitted more from this was undoubtedly Huo Yuhao, as Wang Dong\u2019s cultivation was higher than his. However, as their cultivation levels started getting closer to each other, the individual benefits they gained would be much more similar as well.A doubling in cultivating speed to soul masters was completely astonishing! Huo Yuhao\u2019s original plan had been to try and get to Rank 20 before graduating his first year, but following his current rate of cultivation, there was a possibility of him getting to Rank 20 within three or four months. On the other hand, if Wang Dong cultivated with this speed all the way until the end of the year, getting to Rank 30 wasn\u2019t an impossibility.After nearly six hours of cultivating, when the sky outside had gradually begun to darken, the two woke up from their meditative state. Their soul power returned to their own bodies, and the originally entwined soul power immediately separated. The two could clearly feel that their cultivations had increased at a much faster pace than they usually did.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously opened their eyes, immediately noticing the surprise in the other\u2019s eyes. Regardless of where this martial soul fusion had come from, it was an extremely good thing for them! This was especially so for Huo Yuhao, as the increase in his cultivation speed was much greater than the increase to Wang Dong\u2019s; it could be said that he\u2019d taken a small advantage from Wang Dong.The two couldn\u2019t wait to start trying out their strengthened soul skills, and this time, they discovered a mystery within their martial soul fusion.Every single one of their soul skills would be strengthened by an extremely large amount following the fusion, and it wasn\u2019t just as simple as \u20181+1=2\u2019. Whenever they worked together to unleash a soul skill, not only would its might double, but the consumption of soul power it required would decrease by a half. In other words, the drain in soul power after the two types of soul power fused was extremely small. This was equivalent to an all-new type of high-level soul power after they fused.Because of this, their current state couldn\u2019t be considered a martial soul fusion. It would be more accurate to call it a soul power fusion. However, Wang Dong made was speechless by the fact that it wasn\u2019t him, who had a stronger cultivation, who took the initiative after they fused.When their bodies touched and their soul power fused, Huo Yuhao was unexpectedly left in the dominant position. As long as he willed it, the fusion would go ahead once he touched Wang Dong\u2019s body, regardless of whether Wang Dong cooperated or not. Also, the person who could use the fused soul power to activate the strengthened soul skills was Huo Yuhao. But if Wang Dong wanted to use this fused soul power, he would need Huo Yuhao\u2019s approval before doing so. The difference in who was dominant in this fusion was clear.\u201cWhy would this happen? It\u2019s too unfair.\u201d Wang Dong said indignantly.Huo Yuhao, speechless, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know either! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely try my best to help you out when you need to use it.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t say anything, Huo Yuhao was faintly aware that this had something to do with the Skydream Iceworm. Otherwise, why would he, who had a weaker cultivation, take the dominant position after the fusion occurred?\u201cWang Dong, don\u2019t feel so upset. This new soul power of ours should also have a name, so let\u2019s just use your name to name it.\u201dWang Dong giggled. \u201cWhatever. You wanna call it the Winterking Power? That sounds really bad. Why don\u2019t we use a word from each of our names? Let\u2019s call it the Haodong Power.\u201dHuo Yuhao scratched his head. \u201cIt does kinda sound better.\u201dWang Dong stood up, rubbing his buttocks as he unhappily said, \u201cThis broken mattress of yours is too hard, let\u2019s cultivate on my bed later tonight. Since you\u2019ve taken such a large advantage from me, you\u2019re treating me to dinner tonight.\u201d He raised his head slightly as he spoke. Then, he rested his head against his hands and walked out.Huo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but smile as he looked at Wang Dong\u2019s seemingly indifferent expression. This fella never admits his mistakes and always acts arrogant, but in reality, he has a good heart.\u201cSo be it. In any case, I earned all my money from selling roasted fishes, so I\u2019ll eat your food if I run out of money.\u201d He started to chase after Wang Dong while talking.Regardless of whether it was Huo Yuhao or Wang Dong, they both clearly felt a change in their relationship after the creation of the Haodong Power. Wang Dong was no longer a simple friend or classmate to him, he was a brother. He believed that Wang Dong thought so as well. As for whether that was true or not, only Wang Dong knew the answer to that\u2026While eating dinner, a trace of suspicion arose in Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart. This suspicion came from his understanding of the Skydream Iceworm; it previously said that it would give more of its Origin Energy to him once his body was able to endure it, which would allow his soul skills to reach their maximum levels as his soul rings increased in rank.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 22.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22.4: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial SoulsHowever, the strength of all his soul skills had increased after working together with Wang Dong to generate the Haodong Power, and although he could sense that he was near his body\u2019s limit, he was still able to endure. Since this was the case, why didn\u2019t the Skydream Iceworm strengthen his soul skills to this point?\u201cYou idiot.\u201d Just as suspicion arose in Huo Yuhao\u2019s heart, the Skydream Iceworm\u2019s voice rang out in his mind.\u201cBro, you weren\u2019t sleeping?\u201d Surprised, Huo Yuhao immediately asked in his mind.The Skydream Iceworm snorted. \u201cI\u2019m obviously awake. Do you think I like to sleep that much?\u201dHuo Yuhao secretly cursed to himself. If you don\u2019t like sleeping, how did you sleep for a million years?The Skydream Iceworm said, \u201cThe answer to your worries is extremely simple. It\u2019s true that I didn\u2019t raise the rank of your soul ring to its limit, but that\u2019s because I can\u2019t allow you to become an inflated balloon. Let me give you an example. There\u2019s a type of fish called the Tiger Blowfish. Its body is filled with spines, and whenever it\u2019s in danger, it\u2019ll instantly inflate itself, expanding its body and releasing all of its spines. This makes it so that its predators are unable to eat it. It could be said that it allows its body to expand to its limit in a situation like that.\u201d\u201cIndeed, the attack power of the blowfish\u2019s spines is raised to its limits in a situation like this, but what if a needle stabs it? What would happen then? Likewise, you\u2019re the same. If I raised the strength of your soul rings to the maximum amount that you can endure, you\u2019d be just like that balloon once you encounter a mishap during a battle or cultivation; you\u2019d explode with a bang. Because of that, the \u2018maximum limit you can endure\u2019 I\u2019m referring to is the limit at which you can completely endure it without any side effects. When your soul power fused with Wang Dong\u2019s earlier, the fused energy instantly improved your physiques. This is another great benefit that I helped you obtain when you two achieved a 100% fusion and thoroughly fused your two types of soul powers last night.\u201d\u201cIn other words, whenever you soul powers fuse, the endurance of your bodies will also increase as a result of this fused soul power. And when you can sustain a stronger soul power, the strength of your soul skills will increase accordingly. This in itself is the secret behind a martial soul fusion. However, your martial soul fusion differs from that of ordinary cultivators, and you\u2019ll receive different benefits. During your fusion, your bodies will be constantly improving as a result of your fused soul power, so as long as you continue to cultivate together, there\u2019ll be a day when your physiques and cultivation speeds are the best in the human world.\u201d\u201cNaturally, this process in improvement is rather agonizingly slow. If you two can achieve a True Fusion in the future, then it\u2019s effects will be even better.?Puzzled, Huo Yuhao asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2018True Fusion\u2019?\u201dThe Skydream Iceworm seemed to turn blank for a moment before uttering, \u201cAih, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never tried it either. Okay, just continue trying things out with him. You\u2019ll receive enormous benefits from both your soul power fusion and your martial soul fusion. In the future, you\u2019ll slowly understand what I mean.\u201dAs he finished his sentence, the Skydream Iceworm stopped bothering to talk and disappeared.\u201cOi, has your food gotten into your nose?\u201d After looking at Huo Yuhao\u2019s daydreaming face for a long time, Wang Dong waved his hand in front of his face.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Huo Yuhao hurriedly rubbed his nose, but he then noticed that Wang Dong was smiling naughtily.\u201cWhat\u2019re thinking about? You looked like you were in a trance.\u201d Wang Dong said laughingly. He noticed that Huo Yuhao\u2019s blank expression was very funny to look at.Huo Yuhao said, \u201cI\u2019m obviously thinking about our Haodong Power. I\u2019m thinking about why our soul powers would fuse, and after some thought, there\u2019s only one possibility. That is, when our martial souls fused last night, our compatibility rate was extremely high; that\u2019s why something like this happened.Wang Dong\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cRight! You make some sense. If that wasn\u2019t the case, why would something unique like this happen? Quickly eat, and we can go see whether we can release a fusion skill once we\u2019re done. But do you know how a fusion skill is activated?\u201dSpeechless, Huo Yuhao said, \u201cHow would I know? Doesn\u2019t it just naturally come to you?\u201dTheir two small eyes couldn\u2019t help but expose a trace of speechlessness and a bitter smile. Right, although the teachers did talk about fusion skills in their lectures, it was an ability that belonged to only an extremely small number of the population, so their teachers had just glanced over it, and never explained how it could be activated. After all, the number of people who could truly release a fusion skill was truly too small.Wang Dong said, \u201cWhatever, we\u2019ll go try it out tonight. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll go find Teacher Zhou and see whether she knows of any ways we can go about this.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d While answering, Huo Yuhao kept crying out to the Skydream Iceworm in his mind. He believed that the Skydream Iceworm, with his million years of experience, would definitely know the answer to this question.\u201cIdiot, why are you disturbing me over a small matter like this? Just do whatever you did last night! You idiot.\u201d The Skydream Iceworm seemed to be just on the verge of sleeping, so it was very unhappy when Huo Yuhao woke it up. After mumbling for a bit, it disappeared again.Just do whatever we did last night? After thinking blankly for a moment, he quickly understood what the Skydream Iceworm meant. Hugging?After speeding through dinner, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong quickly left the college with an excited and curious feeling in their hearts. Huo Yuhao hadn\u2019t sold any roasted fishes today, so as the two left through the academy\u2019s entrance, they bumped into many regulars who started to complain. Apologizing profusely was the only thing he could do, and he used the excuse of preparing for the ranking tournament to make his way through the crowd.\u201cWe should speed up.\u201d Wang Dong softly shouted out, and once his feet touched the ground, he suddenly sped up, causing his body to fly out like an arrow that had left a bow.If this had been three months ago, Huo Yuhao might not even have been able to see his shadow, but his three months of bitter training wasn\u2019t wasted on Huo Yuhao. After exerting strength in his legs, Huo Yuhao\u2019s speed similarly soared, and although he didn\u2019t look as graceful as Wang Dong, he absolutely wasn\u2019t slow. He rushed towards Wang Dong, and whenever he landed, he would leave a footprint in the groundThe explosiveness from his muscles flowed endlessly to his legs, and the flow of his internal soul power unceasingly replenished his lost physical strength.The evening air was very relaxing and refreshing, and the two of them currently felt like they were travelling in the wind. Without the constraints of the chainmail, the refreshing feeling all over their bodies allowed their speeds to reach their maximum levels.In the end, Wang Dong\u2019s foundation was still much better than Huo Yuhao\u2019s, and thus he quickly widened the distance between them. When this distance exceeded 300 meters, he slowed down and waited for Huo Yuhao to catch up.\u201cOkay. As a control system soul master who doesn\u2019t specialise in front line combat, your speed is still passable.\u201d Wang Dong spoke with a haughty air as he looked at Huo Yuhao.Huo Yuhao chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Let\u2019s go into the forest.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Dong nodded. After the two made sure there was no one around them, they simultaneously ran into the forest by the roadside. They only stopped after they were several hundred metres into the forest.\u201cLet\u2019s do it here. How are we gonna try it out?\u201d Wang Dong asked.Huo Yuhao replied, \u201cLet\u2019s first test the recovery speed of our Haodong Power.\u201d He raised his hands as he spoke.Wang Dong then joined his hands with Huo Yuhao\u2019s. After their practice in the afternoon, they were extremely familiar with the circulation of the Haodong Power. Just as they predicted, the Haodong Power they generated after fusing their soul powers increased the recovery speed of their physical strength, as well as their soul power, by a certain amount. However, this increase wasn\u2019t as significant when compared to the increase in their cultivation speeds.\u201cIt\u2019s ordinary! However, it has its uses.\u201d After a brief moment, Wang Dong fully replenished his lost physical strength.Huo Yuhao nodded before spreading his arms wide. \u201cCome.\u201dWang Dong was stunned. His gaze towards Huo Yuhao immediately turned vigilant. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201dHuo Yuhao replied in a very natural manner, \u201cLet\u2019s hug!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s expression immediately changed. His face turned green before paling. \u201cHuo Yuhao, I never thought you\u2019d be someone like this. Do you actually think that I won\u2019t beat you to the point where you can\u2019t even take care of yourself?\u201dHuo Yuhao didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry. \u201cWhat\u2019re you even thinking about? You idiot, have you forgotten how we caused the martial soul fusion in the first place? Since we can already fuse our soul powers now, the simplest way for us to activate our fusion is to repeat what happened yesterday!\u201dOnly then did Wang Dong understand what he had meant. He was immediately embarrassed to the point where his face turned bright red. Although it was already quite dark, Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eyes were able to clearly see things even if it was midnight; naturally, he saw Wang Dong\u2019s reaction clearly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even explain anything before you asked me to hug you. Are you purposely trying to embarrass me?\u201d Wang Dong used his anger to disguise his embarrassment and awkwardness.Speechless, Huo Yuhao replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that your thoughts were this unhealthy. We\u2019re both guys, so what can we even do? Hurry up. Let\u2019s get this done early so we can continue cultivating later.\u201dWang Dong hesitated for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re outside the city now, are you sure that we won\u2019t just fall asleep like yesterday?\u201dHuo Yuhao speechlessly replied, \u201cIt won\u2019t. Today\u2019s situation is different from yesterday\u2019s. Why are you acting so overly careful like a woman? I\u2019m going to start now.\u201d As he spoke, he quickly took a step forward and hugged Wang Dong in a single movement.Wang Dong\u2019s body stiffened. In the instant he was hugged by Huo Yuhao, he felt his mind go somewhat blank. Huo Yuhao\u2019s body was slightly sweaty due to his previous sprint, causing the faint smell of sweat to assault Wang Dong\u2019s nose.Wang Dong\u2019s body was very soft, so hugging him was still as comfortable as last night. However, the current Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t have any thoughts of enjoying this feeling. In the instant he hugged Wang Dong, he immediately circulated his own soul power, activating his Spirit Eyes; in that same instant, Wang Dong came to his senses as well.The large area of contact between the two of them caused the soul powers within their bodies to be quickly converted into Haodong Power. Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes were especially bright due to the dim evening, and a faint golden light flickered within them.After a brief moment of sluggishness, Wang Dong hurriedly activated his martial soul.In that instant, a strange feeling came over the two of them. As they hugged each other, their released martial souls felt completely different to the soul skills they\u2019d activated with the previous assistance of the Haodong Power.Right as Wang Dong\u2019s ice-blue wings unfurled, both of their minds blanked out briefly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An extraordinary light suddenly blossomed outwards from their bodies.That light was very peculiar; it was a bizarre light that alternated between the colors blue, purple, and gold. Its core consisted of a dense aura of light, and it was even fused together with a few different mysterious soul power undulations.An enormous shadow appeared behind Wang Dong\u2019s back. It was a complete and magnificent Radiant Butterfly Goddess.On the other hand, an enormous eye with a vertical pupil appeared behind Huo Yuhao. This eye was light-gold in color, but its pupil was faintly purple.After blanking out for a brief moment, the two of them came back to their senses. However, they immediately noticed that everything around them was filled with an intense light.The two enormous shadows slowly approached each other in midair; as they approached each other, they began to transform. The color of the eye that represented Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eye gradually turned deeper, and its entire body turned bluish-purple. However, its golden component had vanished completely.The shadow that represented Wang Dong\u2019s Radiant Butterfly Goddess started to violently combust as it neared Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eye; it burned with a bluish-golden flame.In the end, after crossing what seemed to be an entire world, the two martial soul shadows finally touched each other above Huo Yuhao\u2019s and Wang Dong\u2019s heads.In that instant, their bodies simultaneously shook violently. The Haodong Power that had formed as a result of their fusion erupted like a geyser, draining all of their energy in what seemed to be an instant.The flaming Radiant Butterfly Goddess spread its dazzling wings, slowly hugging the shadow of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eye. In that instant, the shadow of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess disappeared, but the bluish-purple Spirit Eye continued to release a stream of light.The dazzling bluish-golden flame erupted from the shadow of the Spirit Eye, which slowly descended to protect the two of them.The enormous Spirit Eye seemed extremely arcane. If one were to look carefully, it would seem as though there was a boundless world contained within it. In an instant, a tri-colored beam of blue, purple, and gold shot out.This illusion-like ray of light shot forth in a straight line, and everything in its path turned into nothingness. The resplendence contained within that single instant seemed to last forever. The halos of light created wherever the tri-colored beam of light passed didn\u2019t disperse; instead, it left a blurry and distorted brilliance in its wake.However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weren\u2019t able to witness this scene. In the instant that ray of light was released, the Haodong Power within their bodies was instantly drained. The intense feeling of weakness that resulted from this instantly caused them to collapse and faint\u2026Martial soul fusion skills were always skills that released an extremely large amount of power. This was also their first time trying it out, so they had to undergo the process of two martial souls fusing. Thus, the drain on their soul power and mental energies was extremely large. Furthermore, they had never adapted to a situation like this in the past, so it was no wonder they fainted.They directly collapsed onto the ground, even though they were still hugging each other\u2026A speechless night passed\u2026Daytime gradually arrived\u2026He didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d fainted or fallen asleep, but when Wang Dong woke up, he truly felt like dying.It was fortunate that they had been on Wang Dong\u2019s bed last night. But today, the two of them were still tightly hugging each other, but they were covered in dust, dirt, and dew. They had directly fallen asleep in the forest. Was this the fabled one night stand?\u201cHuo Yuhao, get up right now!\u201d As Wang Dong struggled to climb out of Huo Yuhao\u2019s embrace, his expression turned somewhat hysterical.Huo Yuhao drowsily opened his eyes. After discovering that the sun was already up, he was startled and quickly got up. However, the next thing he saw was Wang Dong, who was standing over him and looked as if he were about to beat him up violently.Clenching his teeth, Wang Dong glared at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that we wouldn\u2019t fall asleep while hugging each other?\u201d\u201cDid, did I say that?\u201d Huo Yuhao replied blankly.\u201cYou\u2026 I\u2019m gonna beat you up.\u201d Wang Dong suddenly pounced, straddling Huo Yuhao. He then started to rain blows down on him.Huo Yuhao hurriedly caught his hands and looked to the side with a blank look in his eyes, \u201cL-look\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to look at\u2026\u201d Once he spoke, Wang Dong subconsciously glanced toward the direction where Huo Yuhao was looking; he couldn\u2019t remain calm after seeing what Huo Yuhao saw.To their astonishment, a mysterious trench had appeared in a direction forty-five degrees away from them.This trench was roughly 1.5 metres wide, 30 centimetres deep, and stretched 50 or so meters in a straight line into the distance before quietly disappearing.If it were just an ordinary trench, the two of them absolutely wouldn\u2019t be this surprised. After all, the fusion skill they had unleashed had completely drained them of their soul power and knocked them out for an entire night. Thus, it was normal for it to be this strong.However, the most terrifying thing about it was the fact that a layer of light-gold had covered the soil in the trench; this light-gold was actually identical to the light-gold that appeared whenever Huo Yuhao activated his Spirit Eyes.It wasn\u2019t just the soil. Because there were a few trees in the path of the trench, a semicircular hole had appeared on a tree which was at the edge of the trench. Furthermore, the inside of that hole was covered in a layer of light-gold as well. In addition to that, every plant near both sides of the trench was covered in a layer of light-gold as well.At this very moment under the sun\u2019s radiance, that dazzling layer of light-gold looked like a golden road that had appeared in front of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. How could they not be astonished?\u201cThis, was this created by your Radiant Butterfly Goddess?\u201d Huo Yuhao asked blankly.Wang Dong was currently still atop Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. He subconsciously shook his head. \u201cNo, absolutely not. Although my martial soul\u2019s gold, it\u2019s either bright gold or bluish-golden. It\u2019d never be a light-gold color like this. This, this looks identical to the color of your Spirit Eyes!\u201dHuo Yuhao slapped his thigh and said, \u201cQuickly, get up. Let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d At this moment, Wang Dong was fascinated by the golden road; he didn\u2019t notice that the area Huo Yuhao had slapped was near his buttocks. After getting up, Huo Yuhao hurriedly got up as well, and the two of them quickly walked over to the golden road before squatting down to take a look.Wang Dong was just about to touch the golden road, but Huo Yuhao grabbed his hand. \u201cYou said that this is just like the color of my Spirit Eyes, so I should do this.\u201d As he spoke, he stretched his hand into the trench and touched its golden surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, an astonished expression appeared on his face. In the instant he touched the golden soil, he felt as if his mind had been thrown into disarray. His Spiritual Sea shook violently; it felt as if he\u2019d been struck by his Spirit Shock.\u201cThis, this is only the aftereffects of our fusion skill? Try it out.\u201d Huo Yuhao hurriedly looked towards Wang Dong.Wang Dong was extremely curious. As a result of this, he quickly stretched his hand out to touch the golden trench.His reaction to it was much greater than Huo Yuhao\u2019s. His entire body turned sluggish, and it took a long time for him to come back to his senses.The two looked at each other and saw the astonishment in one another\u2019s eyes.\u201cThis, isn\u2019t this too awesome? This is just the aftereffects of our fusion skill, but it felt like I had been struck by your all-out Spirit Shock. Can you imagine what\u2019d happen if we were hit its full power?\u201d Wang Dong\u2019s voice was trembling slightly due to his excitement. There were no soul masters who didn\u2019t wish to possess a strong soul skill.Huo Yuhao said, \u201cLook, the range of this soul skill should be around fifty meters or so in a straight line, but I\u2019m not sure about whether or not it can single someone out or not. It\u2019s extremely strong\u2014I believe that it might even have both mental and destruction attributes, making it a double-attribute attack. Only, I\u2019m not sure how many times it increases our attack power by. If someone were to be struck by it at full power, its power would\u2026\u201dWang Dong nodded excitedly. \u201cMoreover, the strength of this fusion skill will increase as our cultivation increases! This fusion skill of ours is truly tyrannical. If we were to meet the Lan Sister\u2019s Empyreal Net again, we\u2019d definitely be able to destroy it in an instant!\u201dHuo Yuhao was similarly excited, but he was slightly calmer than Wang Dong, \u201cWang Dong, do you think we can use this fusion skill in the assessment? I doubt that a Soul Elder can withstand the amount of power it contains!\u201dWang Dong\u2019s face stiffened. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. An extremely strong skill like this is actually quite problematic. Furthermore, we can only use it once, so we can\u2019t even use it to intimidate the others. We\u2019d faint after using it once.\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cThis is the first time we used it, so we were too inexperienced. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be this draining when we try using it next time, but we should only be able to use it once. However, having a strong skill is always a good thing. Once we practice it a few more times and get used to it, it\u2019ll be much better.\u201dWang Dong said, \u201cIf that Ma Xiaotao wants to bully us again, we\u2019ll let her taste this. It shouldn\u2019t kill her with her cultivation, so we can use it to show how awesome we are.\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cA strong fusion skill like this should always have a name. Since I was wrong earlier, I\u2019ll let you name it.\u201dWang Dong didn\u2019t decline this responsibility. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll consider you tactful. What would sound nice? Gaze of Death, how about that?\u201dWithout even waiting for Huo Yuhao\u2019s opinion, he immediately rejected that name himself. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t do. It\u2019s a fusion skill that\u2019s activated by the both of us, so how can it not contain anything that\u2019s related to my martial soul? Let\u2019s call it the \u2018Gaze of the Radiant Goddess\u2019. That sounds cool.\u201dHuo Yuhao had a speechless look on his face as he stared at him, \u201cHow the heck is your Radiant Butterfly Goddess a Radiant Goddess? The \u2018Radiant Goddess\u2019 in your martial soul\u2019s name clearly refers to how it illuminates light, as well as the fact that it\u2019s a butterfly that\u2019s as beautiful as a goddess. Let\u2019s not even bother discussing the existence of a Radiant Goddess; even if it did exist, it wouldn\u2019t be related to us at all.\u201dWang Dong frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t you admit that it sounds quite nice? Don\u2019t tell me you want to call it \u2018Gaze of the Butterfly\u2019? Wouldn\u2019t that sound even worse?\u201dSuddenly, his eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019ve got it. Why do we even need to add the names of our martial souls to it? That doesn\u2019t sound special at all. Considering the fact that it\u2019s such a magnificent golden color, and that it releases such a resplendent light for an instant, why don\u2019t we call it: A Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence. How about that?\u201dHuo Yuhao\u2019s eyes widened slightly, \u201cThis name sounds cool, but isn\u2019t it too long?\u201dPleased with himself, Wang Dong said, \u201cA long name shows off how awesome we are, right? Let\u2019s just abbreviate it to \u2018A Golden Road\u2019. In any case, nobody else will even know what it is. Once we get back, let\u2019s ask Teacher Zhou to evaluate the effects and strength of our \u2018A Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence\u2019. Then, we can find out what\u2019s going on.\u201dOnce he heard the words \u2018Teacher Zhou\u2019, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt a chill up his back. He then turned around and noticed the sun, which was already rising gradually.Wang Dong was instantly reminded by his actions, and started to think of something. The two then looked each other in the eye and simultaneously let out a cry, immediately running.We\u2019re gonna be late again\u2026 and it\u2019s even when the knock-out tournament\u2019s about to start. We\u2019re gonna be late again\u2026For the sake of getting back to Shrek Academy in the shortest time possible, the two had no choice but to hold hands and run at full speed, activating the Vastwinter Power. Under this situation, not only was the consumption of energy even smaller, it even allowed them to reach their maximum speed.Fortunately, they weren\u2019t too far away from the Academy. Thus, they didn\u2019t need too much time to return, but they were still late.Roughly thirty or so academy teachers, including the old lady Zhou Yi, were standing in a line outside the Assessment Area.Zhou Yi currently had an unhappy look in her eyes. She scanned through the nearly two hundred students beneath her, but she still couldn\u2019t find the people she was looking for.Xiao Xiao was already there, and she was currently waiting with a panicked expression on her face. This was because registration had already started, and in addition to that, it had started with their Class 1. However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weren\u2019t there yet. If they didn\u2019t manage to make it there before registration ended, they\u2019d be disqualified from the tournament. Without even mentioning what a pity it\u2019d be for them to miss this opportunity, Old Lady Zhou\u2019s rage was something they wouldn\u2019t be able to endure! And she, who was part of the same team as Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, would have to suffer this stroke of bad luck with them.Just what\u2019re those two guys doing? They were late yesterday, don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re going to be late today as well?The number of participating students from Class 1 was greatest among the ten classes, and as such, the time needed to register them was also the longest among the ten classes. When it was time for Xiao Xiao\u2019s team to be registered, Xiao Xiao was the only person who responded. Unexpectedly, nobody responded to the names \u2018Huo Yuhao\u2019 and \u2018Wang Dong\u2019. Once this occurred, not only was the entire student body stunned, even the teachers were astonished.Although this wasn\u2019t the first time that a situation like this had occurred in the history of Shrek Academy, it was an extremely rare occurrence. Even if they had already passed the freshmen assessment, it would seem as if they were looking down on the academy if they didn\u2019t turn up for the knock-out tournament. As such, they would give an unfavourable impression to all the teachers.The teacher in charge of the registration paused slightly for a moment before continuing to register the students from the other classes. This went on all the way until Class 6, when Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong finally arrived.The two of them had rushed all the way to the academy, and they\u2019d even slept in the forest overnight. In addition to that, they hadn\u2019t even had time to clean themselves up. As a result of this, their figures looked extremely sorry. Without even talking about how dirty their clothes were, there were even traces of mud and dew on their clothes.However, the deed was already done. Thus, they could only thicken their faces and come up. After all, they couldn\u2019t actually forfeit their places!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This teacher looked fifty-or-so-years old, and had a tall frame. He was dark-skinned and beardless, and had a stern expression on his face.\u201cWhat class are you two from? What happened?\u201dHuo Yuhao and Wang Dong both recognised him. This teacher was called Du Weilun, and he was the director of the outer courtyard\u2019s Martial Soul Department. He possessed the greatest authority in the outer courtyard.Huo Yuhao shouted, \u201cReporting in, Teacher Du. We\u2019re Class 1\u2019s Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. We were late due to excessive cultivation.\u201dDu Weilun\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYou\u2019re even late to the assessment? Have you no concept of time? As a punishment, you\u2019ll be sweeping all the corridors of the freshmen teaching blocks two days after the tournament ends. Return to your team.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong hurriedly replied. They inwardly let out a sigh of relief. As long as they didn\u2019t lose their qualification to participate in the tournament, everything else was fine. The two hurriedly walked to the area where Class 1\u2019s teams were and stood together with Xiao Xiao.Du Weilun glanced at the nearby Zhou Yi before continuing to register the other students. With his temper, if any other students were late, it\u2019d be very likely for him to directly strip them of their qualifications to participate in the ranking tournament. In any case, they\u2019d have passed the freshmen assessment anyway. However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were unique in the sense that they had performed exceptionally well during the round-robin tournament; they\u2019d obtained a perfect score. This was the reason why the iron-faced director let them off leniently.Although results weren\u2019t everything in Shrek Academy, students who were strong and obtained good results would have preferential treatment. This was the case in any academy.\u201cWhere\u2019d you two go to? Just wait till Old Lady Zhou takes care of you guys once today\u2019s matches are over. Look at her eyes; they look like blades. If looks could kill, you two would\u2019ve died by a thousand cuts.\u201d Xiao Xiao spoke unhappily.Wang Dong spoke with a depressed look on his face. \u201cStop grumbling. This is all Huo Yuhao\u2019s fault. If he didn\u2019t drag me out to compare notes with him, making me lose track of time, how could we be late?\u201dDuring the journey back, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had agreed to keep their martial soul fusion skill a secret for the time being. After all, they weren\u2019t planning on using it during the freshmen assessment. They agreed to only tell this piece of good news to Teacher Zhou, in order to appease her thunderous fury while letting her give them some advice regarding their cultivations. They\u2019d then show it off in future assessments once they were adept at using it.The director of the outer courtyard\u2019s Martial Soul Department, Du Weilun, quickly finished taking attendance, and what followed that was the drawing of lots. This was only a freshmen assessment, so there weren\u2019t too many complicated procedures involved. Huo Yuhao represented his team to draw lots. The sixty-four teams involved in the knock-out tournament were divided into thirty-two areas where they would fight each other.Yesterday, the students had had an entire day\u2019s worth of rest, and the layout of the Assessment Area had been changed during that day as well. They merely changed the positioning of the partitioning walls, re-dividing the Assessment Area into sixteen areas. This time, the area of every single sub-area was increased several-fold, allowing the participating students to have even more space to utilise.The rules of the knock-out tournament were very simple; there would be one match in the morning and one match in the afternoon every day, and eliminated teams would have to return to class, while victorious teams would continue to compete. After three days, the top three teams would be decided.After the lots were drawn, the round of sixty-four immediately started, and thirty-two matches were simultaneously held. This way, they could shorten the time used for the tournament and give victorious students ample time to rest for their afternoon match.This time, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was sent to the 15th area; their proctor had been changed as well. This time, the proctor in charge of them was a thirty-or-so-year-old female teacher who looked extremely good-natured.When they drew lots earlier, they only obtained a number. Hence, they didn\u2019t even know who they\u2019d be facing. Once they arrived, they were somewhat speechless. Their opponents in the first match was actually a few of their classmates, resulting in this knock-out tournament becoming a civil war.Their three opponents were people who Huo Yuhao\u2019s team recognised. One of them had even attempted to challenge Wang Dong. According to Wang Dong, that fellow had been immediately humbled after Wang Dong privately beat him up.Zhou Yi\u2019s judgement was extremely precise. Since she had chosen Huo Yuhao\u2019s team as Class 1\u2019s seeded team, their strength was naturally something that the other teams couldn\u2019t compete against. The match didn\u2019t last for long. Although their opponents were extremely resilient, the match was finished within ten minutes due to Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao working together, along with the assistance of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection. Thus, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team successfully entered the top 32.However, just as they walked out of the Assessment Area, their originally joyful expressions instantly vanished. This was because the gloomy-faced Old Lady Zhou was waiting for them by the exit to the Assessment Area.\u201cXiao Xiao, you can go back and rest first. You two, follow me.\u201d With that, she coldly humphed and turned away.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously felt a chill up their spines. Fortunately, they had already made their preparations. After glancing at each other, they followed Zhou Yi. Xiao Xiao could only gaze at them with an expression that said \u2018you can fend go for yourselves\u2019.This time, Zhou Yi unexpectedly brought them straight to her office. As the teacher in charge of Class 1, her office was located in the Administration Area that was located behind the black and purple buildings of the outer courtyard\u2019s teaching blocks, as well as the northern area of the Dormitory Area. Her office was situated on the first floor, and she was the only person who was currently working there.After following Zhou Yi into the Office, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong couldn\u2019t help but feel astonished.Unexpectedly, the cold and extremely strict Teacher Zhou had decorated her office in an extremely elegant manner. The walls of her office were painted a light pink color, and her table was made with a special type of wood that was light red. Furthermore, there was a large red sofa that was meant for guests along with a few other decorations. There was also a small door that seemed to lead to a lounge. One had to admit that Shrek Academy treated its teachers relatively well; even teachers in charge of freshmen classes had their own private offices.Huo Yuhao was the last person to walk into the room, and he carefully shut the door upon entering. Zhou Yi was already seated on the large red sofa, and she crossed her arms in front of her chest. She spoke coldly. \u201cTell me, just what in the world were you two doing? You\u2019re really good! You two were late for two consecutive days. Since you\u2019ve passed the freshmen assessment, your wings have hardened, and I can\u2019t control you anymore. Is that what you think? Let me tell you this. As long as I will it, I can expel you two from the academy with a single word. This world doesn\u2019t lack any geniuses, and I\u2019ve expelled many of them myself. There\u2019s only one reason why I would expel a genius\u2014and that\u2019s because they weren\u2019t suited to become an expert with their personality. Give me a good reason why I shouldn\u2019t expel the two of you.\u201dHuo Yuhao and Wang Dong glanced at each other, and Wang Dong bumped him, indicating that he should explain.Huo Yuhao could only brace himself and say, \u201cTeacher Zhou, sorry. We were in the wrong.\u201d During these three months, he could be considered to have become familiar with Zhou Yi\u2019s temper. Arguing with her had no benefits; it\u2019d just enrage this Old Lady Zhou further. If you had a good attitude, you could receive a smaller punishment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you think that being late is just a small matter? Let me tell you this. Being late represents laziness, and laziness at your age is something extremely serious. If you only have this reason to defend yourself, you can screw off. Tell me, I need a logical explanation.\u201dOnly then did Huo Yuhao respectfully reply, \u201cTeacher Zhou, please don\u2019t be angry. This is what happened. Do you still remember what happened? When we met Huang Chutian\u2019s team, they had a pair of twins who were called Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Yi replied.Huo Yuhao continued, \u201cDuring that match, we almost lost because the Lan sisters were able to activate a fusion skill. We were only able to forcefully block that powerful skill of theirs after working hard together. After that, we finally won that match and ended the round-robin tournament with a perfect score.\u201d\u201cAfter we got back, we both envied the strength of their fusion skill. Thus, we decided to try it out and see whether our martial souls could fuse. The school doesn\u2019t have a class that specialises in fusion skills, so we could only try it out by ourselves. However, who knew that our martial souls would fuse together on our first try? During the fusion process, we fell asleep on Wang Dong\u2019s bed, and class had already started by the time we woke up. That\u2019s why we were late yesterday.\u201dAs Huo Yuhao continued his explanation, he clearly felt Wang Dong softly pinch the skin on his waist and twist it a hundred and eighty degrees.He felt an intense sensation of pain, but he didn\u2019t dare to show it. However, his expression immediately stiffened by a bit.\u201cA martial soul fusion?\u201d Zhou Yi was stunned. She didn\u2019t think that Huo Yuhao would actually give a reason like this. She subconsciously asked,: \u201cDid you succeed?\u201dHuo Yuhao scratched his head and said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure about it yesterday. Thus, we tried it out for a moment when you asked us to run around yesterday, and it seemed to work. Later that night, we went outside the academy to try out our fusion skill. We never thought that it\u2019d actually succeed in one try. Furthermore, its strength seemed quite strong. However, this was the first time we\u2019d activated a fusion skill, so our soul power was overdrafted. After releasing it, we directly collapsed in the forest, and we were already late when we woke up. Teacher Zhou, we were truly late because we were diligently cultivating. This was just an accident; I promise you that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dWith that, Huo Yuhao quietly raised his head and stole a glance at Zhou Yi. However, he only saw Zhou Yi\u2019s dumbstruck expression.\u201cYou, you\u2019re telling me that you actually succeeded when you tried to use a fusion skill?\u201d Zhou Yi\u2019s voice clearly rose in pitch. At the same time, she stood up with an astonished and excited look on her face.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong nodded simultaneously.Zhou Yi excitedly said, \u201cQuick, let me see. What\u2019s your fusion skill?\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cTeacher Zhou, we still have a match in the afternoon, and we\u2019ll completely drain our soul power after using this skill.\u201dZhou Yi unhappily said, \u201cYour energy will be drained the most when you use it for the first time. It won\u2019t be that draining when you use it in the future. If soul masters were to faint whenever they released a fusion skill, wouldn\u2019t it become a suicidal move? Hurry up. I\u2019ll be responsible for helping you recover your soul power, so it won\u2019t interfere with your afternoon match. Come, just use it on me.\u201dSince Zhou Yi had already said so, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse. The two faced each other, and Huo Yuhao spread his arms and hugged Wang Dong in a very natural manner. Although Wang Dong\u2019s movements were still somewhat stiff, he didn\u2019t push Huo Yuhao away. He shut his eyes and spread his arms as well, hugging Huo Yuhao.In the instant their bodies touched, they each released their martial souls.Their soul powers instantly fused, causing the Haodong Power to flow through their bodies. The two of them felt as if their bodies were fused together.One second, two seconds, three seconds passed\u2026Teacher Zhou\u2019s office was so quiet that even the sound of a needle dropping could be heard, but there were no other movements in the room besides the soul power undulations caused by Huo Yuhao\u2019s and Wang Dong\u2019s martial souls.Zhou Yi widened her eyes as she stared at them. She was already prepared to defend against their attack, but the two of them were just standing there hugging each other without doing anything else. The corner of her eyelid was beginning to twitch.The two of them could feel that something was wrong. In accordance with what had happened yesterday, their soul power should\u2019ve quickly been drained! Then, a Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence should\u2019ve been released in a single direction. However, nothing was happening at all.\u201cJust what the hell do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Zhou Yi\u2019s cold voice sounded as if it was spoken through clenched teeth. The two couldn\u2019t help but feel a chill up their spines, and they subconsciously stopped hugging each other. An expression of shock instantly filled their faces.Zhou Yi\u2019s body was currently releasing killing intent; it was the second time Zhou Yi had given off this feeling towards the two of them. Old Lady Zhou was clearly about to blow up.Huo Yuhao hurriedly spoke, \u201cTeacher Zhou, this was how we released our fusion skill yesterday! We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201dZhou Yi spoke with a chilly voice, \u201cAre you trying to show off your gay love by hugging each other in my office? If I don\u2019t TAKE CARE of you two today, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dWithout even waiting for Zhou Yi to finish her sentence, Huo Yuhao immediately sprung into action. He grabbed Wang Dong\u2019s hand and instantly used his Spiritual Detection Sharing on Zhou Yi.\u201cHmm?\u201d Zhou Yi was just about to blow up from her anger, but everything around her suddenly became clear to her. Her perception rapidly expanded, and within the blink of an eye, everything within a hundred meters of her became a clear three-dimensional image in her mind.Why did his range increase by this much? Zhou Yi clearly remembered that the range of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection was only thirty meters or so the last time he had used it. However, it had turned into a hundred meters this time around. The magnitude of this increase was simply too large.As he looked at Zhou Yi\u2019s slight confusion, Huo Yuhao hurriedly explained, \u201cTeacher Zhou, do you remember what I said last time? I told you that my Spiritual Detection would evolve as my cultivation increases, and after your caring guidance during these three months, its range increased to around fifty meters or so. In addition to that, I\u2019ve found a way of concentrating its effects in one direction only, allowing its range to increase even more. On the other hand, the hundred meters that you\u2019re currently sensing wasn\u2019t done by me alone. After Wang Dong and I fused our martial souls, our soul powers fused as well. The reason why my Spiritual Detection\u2019s range increased by so much, to the point where it\u2019s even doubled in range, was due to Wang Dong\u2019s help. Doesn\u2019t this prove that we can fuse our martial souls? We really managed to use a fusion skill last night. If you don\u2019t believe us, we can bring you to the area we tested it out on. There are a still a few traces left there.\u201dAfter hearing Huo Yuhao\u2019s words, Zhou Yi gradually calmed down; she knew that she had been slightly impetuous.During these three months, she had seen Huo Yuhao\u2019s performance in the academy. Even as she looked through her memories, there had never been a student who\u2019d been more diligent than him. Furthermore, he was calmer than his peers, and had a few hints of maturity. Even if he wanted to lie to her, he\u2019d never tell a lie that could be exposed as easily as this one.This was a perfect example of the saying \u2018everyone specialised in their own fields\u2019. Although Zhou Yi was a teacher from Shrek Academy, she wasn\u2019t too familiar with martial soul fusion skills. After all, these skills were truly too niche. After listening to Huo Yuhao\u2019s explanation, she had already believed them. As such, the anger in her heart quickly dissipated.Waving her hand, Zhou Yi said, \u201cFine. You can stop using your skill, I believe you two. Only, there\u2019s definitely something that went wrong when you were trying to use your fusion skill. Wait in my office for a while, I\u2019ll go bring a teacher who\u2019s familiar with fusion skills. I\u2019ll get him to dispel your doubts.\u201dOld Lady Zhou was always a person who made swift and decisive decisions. By the time she had finished speaking, she was already outside, and was walking with quick stepsOnce she left, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously let out a sigh of relief. The two of them collapsed onto the sofa, and Huo Yuhao used his left hand to wipe away the sweat on his forehead. Wang Dong wanted to use his left hand as well, but he noticed that Huo Yuhao was still holding it.\u201cRelease your hand.\u201d Wang Dong unhappily freed his hand from Huo Yuhao\u2019s grip. He then glared at him, \u201cI\u2019m blaming you for this. If it weren\u2019t for you insisting on trying our fusion skill out, why else would we be caught by that Old Lady Zhou? We don\u2019t really have any secrets now, do we?\u201dAs Huo Yuhao leaned into the sofa, he chuckled, \u201cBlame me if you want to, but this isn\u2019t really a bad thing. We\u2019ll be able to avoid doing things incorrectly if we have a teacher guiding our cultivation. Just when can you change this grumbling attitude of yours? I\u2019m the only one who can tolerate you.\u201dWang Dong humphed. \u201cI only do it when I\u2019m with you. If it were anyone else, I\u2019d be too lazy to even complain. However, it\u2019s worth it, since we saw Old Lady Zhou\u2019s stunned expression. Hey, do you think Old Lady Zhou will continue to teach us after we finish the knock-out tournament?\u201dHuo Yuhao replied, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell. Teacher Zhou\u2019s teaching seems to be quite comprehensive, but she seems to place emphasis on a few different things. Only, we\u2019re too young, and our cultivation levels are quite low, so we haven\u2019t seen her specialties yet. In any case, we\u2019ll find out after we get reassigned classes once the knock-out tournament ends. I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll follow Teacher Zhou. Although she\u2019s somewhat strict, it isn\u2019t really a bad thing for us. At the very least, she\u2019ll continue to encourage us to diligently cultivate and learn.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right, let\u2019s cultivate for a while here. Once Old Lady Zhou comes back and sees that we were cultivating while she was gone, she\u2019ll definitely think that we\u2019re very hardworking. I\u2019m sure that her mood will improve as well.\u201dHuo Yuhao knocked him on the head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re an expert at doing these crafty things.\u201d\u201cRubbish, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s doing crafty things. We\u2019ve got a match in the afternoon, and we were somewhat drained from the match earlier, so what\u2019s wrong with recovering as soon as possible? Are you gonna do it or not? Hurry up.\u201d As he spoke, he took off his shoes and sat on the sofa in a cross-legged position. After that, he extended his hands out towards Huo Yuhao.Huo Yuhao had always cultivated whenever he had free time, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t refuse. He mirrored Wang Dong\u2019s position and placed his palms against Wang Dong\u2019s palms. Then, they simultaneously circulated their soul powers.As their soul powers circulated and fused with one another, it felt somewhat different from yesterday\u2019s cultivation. Their soul powers seemed to have become more intimate, and their cultivation speeds during the initial stages of the fusion were clearly much faster than they were yesterday; the Haodong Power had already appeared in the instant they touched. As they willed it, the Haodong Power circulated along their cultivation paths at a speed that was at least 10% faster than yesterday.When they started cultivating, they shut their eyes. As such, they didn\u2019t notice that three blue, purple, and gold lights had slowly emerged from their palms. These three lights revolved around their arms and started to hover around their bodies, and gradually, a layer of color appeared on their bodies.Originally, they were merely planning on recovering some of their soul power. However, they quickly entered a meditative state once their cultivation started, resulting in them losing all awareness of the world.Not long after they began cultivating, Zhou Yi returned with another person in tow. If the two of them had been awake, they would\u2019ve definitely been astonished. This was because the person that Zhou Yi had brought back was their proctor during the round-robin tournament, Teacher Wang Yan.Zhou Yi was startled by the appearances of the two as they cultivated, while Wang Yan was completely astonished. Afterwards, the two of them unexpectedly gave each other a signal to remain silent.An inquiring look appeared in Zhou Yi\u2019s eyes, but Wang Yan merely shook his head. After that, he quietly walked towards their bodies and squatted down, observing their conditions. In addition to that, he started to carefully pay attention to the soul power undulations they were generating as they cultivated.As he continued to pay attention to them, the astonishment on Wang Yan\u2019s face increased. He subconsciously started to rub his hands.Zhou Yi and Wang Yan had known each other for a while; she knew that this action of his signified his nervousness and excitement. Moreover, she was a teacher herself. As such, she could also sense how unusual Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong\u2019s current state was. At the very least, she had never seen something like this before. Two soul masters were unexpectedly cultivating together, and not only did their soul powers not interfere with each other, they even fused together. They could see how quickly they were cultivating from the circulation of the three lights, and knew that even a three-ringed Soul Elder wouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate as fast as them!After completing thirty-six cycles of cultivation, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong stopped. The two managed to completely recover the soul power they had lost during their earlier match, and they even managed to increase their cultivation levels by a step.The two of them simultaneously let out a sigh, slowly retracting their respective soul powers. This then caused the three lights revolving around their bodies to slowly dissipate.As they opened their eyes, the two felt somewhat refreshed. Their current cultivation speed was simply too satisfying. However, they were quickly startled by the scene in front of them.\u201cTeacher Zhou, Teacher Wang?\u201d To his astonishment, Huo Yuhao saw Zhou Yi and Wang Yan seated on chairs not far away from the sofa, fully concentrated on them.Wang Dong was also astonished. Only then did the two remember that they were still in Zhou Yi\u2019s office.Huo Yuhao spoke with a slightly embarrassed voice. \u201cTeacher Zhou, we wanted to recover some of our soul power and prepare for the afternoon match. That\u2019s why we\u2026\u201dZhou Yi waved her hand and said, \u201cNo need for any explanations. Being hardworking is always a good thing. This person is Teacher Wang Yan, an excellent teacher from the Academy\u2019s theoretical faction. He\u2019s even one rank higher than me as a teacher. He\u2019s very well-learned with regards to martial soul fusion skills.\u201dWang Yan smiled slightly and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that I need to introduce myself. We\u2019ve met before. I was their proctor during the round-robin tournament.\u201d The current him had already regained his usual calm look, but as for whether he was truly calm on the inside, only he himself knew the answer to that.\u201cTeacher Wang.\u201d Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously bowed to him respectfully.Wang Yan nodded his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve carefully observed your cultivations. In the beginning, I didn\u2019t believe what Zhou Yi told me, but now, I\u2019ve realised that I was inexperienced. Now, I can testify to Zhou Yi with a 100% certainty that you two have completed a martial soul fusion, and that you possess a fusion skill.\u201dZhou Yi looked at him with a somewhat astonished expression on her face, but she didn\u2019t interrupt him.Wang Yan continued. \u201cYour soul powers are actually so compatible that they didn\u2019t even conflict with each other at all when they fused together. Moreover, the fusion even assisted your cultivation. This has never been seen in the ten-thousand-year records of Shrek Academy. There\u2019s only one explanation for this\u2014that is, your martial souls are perfectly compatible, achieving a perfect 100% compatibility rate. Only this legendary occurrence could allow your soul powers to perfectly fuse without any distinctions whatsoever, and allow you to share your cultivation speeds. Congratulations. I can even foresee that you two will definitely become Chosen of our Shrek Academy in the future.\u201dHuo Yuhao couldn\u2019t help but secretly admire Wang Yan as he listened to his words. He\u2019d heard of the words \u2018Perfect Compatibility\u2019 from the Skydream Iceworm, but Wang Yan was able to deduce this by merely observing their cultivations, even though he didn\u2019t fully understand them. It was no wonder he was a representative of the Academy\u2019s theoretical faction.Puzzled, Wang Dong asked, \u201cTeacher Wang, since that\u2019s the case, why did our fusion skill fail today? Huo Yuhao and I tried it out earlier, but nothing happened!\u201dWang Yan chuckled. \u201cDo you think that fusion skills are ordinary soul skills? How could the activation of a fusion skill be so simple? Your martial souls and energies have to be at their peak conditions for a fusion skill to be activated. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen two people with perfect compatibility rates, but according to my experience, there\u2019s a fixed resting period for the activation of a martial soul fusion skill. Moreover, you won\u2019t be able to activate it during this time period. This period normally lasts seven days, but that will gradually lessen as your cultivations increase. This will happen all the way until you can completely master your fusion skill.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unrivaled Tang SectCH 24.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24.2: The BetHuo Yuhao asked, \u201cTeacher Wang, when will we be able to freely use our fusion skill?\u201dWang Yan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell. You\u2019d have to reach Rank 70 at the very least to be able to use it freely, as you\u2019d have obtained a Martial Soul True Body by then. This is normally the case for any soul master. However, it\u2019s very likely that you two have a perfect compatibility rate. Thus, I suggest that you try using your fusion skill every day from now, all the way until it works again. We can then confirm the resting period of your fusion skill. Once you\u2019ve confirmed the length of this resting period, come find me and let me see what your fusion skill is. I\u2019m very curious as to what it is!\u201dWith Wang Yan\u2019s explanation, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were now much more knowledgeable about fusion skills.Zhou Yi asked, \u201cTeacher Wang, since they\u2019ve achieved a perfect compatibility rate for their martial soul fusion, what other benefits does it give besides aiding them in their cultivation?\u201dWang Yan chuckled. \u201cTeacher Zhou, a man who\u2019s never content is like a snake that\u2019s trying to swallow an elephant! You\u2019ve already picked up two treasures. Simply allowing them to assist each other during cultivating can double their cultivation speed. You might not be able to see anything now, but give it a few years. I can guarantee that within three years, absolutely none of their peers will be able to compete with their cultivation levels. However, you\u2019re right to ask this question. There\u2019s another difference between perfectly compatible fusion skills and ordinary fusion skills, and that is their strengths. I\u2019m pretty sure you know what I mean. According to the normal rules of a martial soul fusion, the higher the compatibility rate, the stronger the fusion skill will be. However, we\u2019ve never seen a perfect fusion before. Hence, I wish to personally see how strong their fusion skill is, and what effects it has.\u201dZhou Yi nodded and said, \u201cThanks for your help. Teacher Wang, shall we report this matter together?\u201dWang Yan shook his head and smiled. \u201cNo need. You can report it by yourself. You should\u2019ve been promoted to a high-ranked teacher already. Furthermore, you were the one who discovered these two fellows. I can\u2019t steal your glory.\u201dZhou Yi smiled and nodded at him.Wang Yan stood up and said, \u201cYou little fellas have to work hard. Go enter the top 32 in the knock-out tournament. You\u2019ll have to work even harder once you\u2019ve entered the top 8. The academy will have a few higher-ups watching you fight. Furthermore, even we teachers think that the champion prize is quite good, so you can\u2019t miss out on it. If you have any problems, you can come find me. My office is on the fourth floor. Teacher Zhou, I\u2019ll be taking my leave then.\u201dZhou Yi walked Wang Yan all the way to the door to the office. Before leaving, Wang Yan looked deeply at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.Zhou Yi didn\u2019t enter the room again. Instead, she beckoned towards the two who were still in the office. \u201cLet\u2019s go, you should eat lunch. I\u2019ll treat you to lunch today.\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t explicitly state it, taking the initiative to treat them to lunch signified that she was apologizing to Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong for blaming them.The two felt that it was somewhat inconceivable, but they quickly came to their senses and excitedly charged to the canteen with Zhou Yi in tow.Zhou Yi was actually quite a generous person; she unexpectedly treated them to all of the canteen\u2019s top-ranked dishes.The canteen\u2019s top-ranked dishes were extraordinarily pricey, and there were new dishes that were priced differently every day. However, their prices were always in gold soul coins. There were two top-ranked dishes today, and Zhou Yi ordered two of each, causing the total bill to exceed sixty gold soul coins.\u201cTeacher Zhou, you\u2019re spending too much on us.\u201d Huo Yuhao felt a bit bad. Even after all the time he\u2019d spent selling roasted fish, he hadn\u2019t even earned a total of sixty gold soul coins yet\u2026Zhou Yi said, \u201cQuickly, eat it while it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t think that the Academy\u2019s selling these top-ranked dishes for the sake of making a profit. In reality, the top-ranked dishes are the only dishes in the canteen that cause the Academy to suffer a loss.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong asked at practically the same time.Zhou Yi smiled indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019s naturally for the sake of the bodies of the students. Do you two recognise these dishes?\u201d She pointed at the plates in front of her.These two dishes had strong fragrances. One looked like a stew, while the other was some soup.That stew was made out of lean meat and tendons. The stew itself was strong and thick, while the meat was fresh and soft to the touch. Even the tendons had been cooked in such a way that they had a soft and gelatinous texture. Merely looking at the dish would make one\u2019s appetite increase.On the other hand, the soup had a light-gold color, and there was nothing inside it; there was only soup. However, its fragrance assaulted one\u2019s nose, so much so that it even smelled richer than the stew. There was even the faint smell of medicinal herbs hidden within the soup.Undoubtedly, Huo Yuhao was unable to tell the names of these dishes. However, Wang Dong hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cTeacher Zhou, this stew seems to be made out of the meat of the Devilscale Alligator? I can\u2019t tell what the soup is made out of, though.\u201dZhou Yi nodded and said, \u201cYou deserve to be called a child from an aristocratic family. You\u2019re right. This meat of this stew comes from the Devilscale Alligator, which is an extraordinarily strong amphibian soul beast. Eating its meat is a large help to us soul masters, as it can improve our physique and increase the toughness of our meridians. It\u2019s a good thing that\u2019s quite rare. Only, the meat of the Devilscale Alligator is as hard as steel. Thus, it takes an extremely great chef to be able to refine it into something this soft. So let me tell you this: our Shrek Academy doesn\u2019t just have the best teachers on the continent, we have the best chefs as well. An adult Devilscale Alligator is at the thousand-year soul beast rank at the very least, so do you still think that this dish is expensive?\u201d\u201cAs for this soup, it was made by boiling an avian soul beast for a long time, and it has the effect of nourishing one\u2019s internal organs. This can make our internal organs more stable, which can benefit our cultivation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said this in the past, but we have three students this year who\u2019ve reached the Soul Elder rank. It\u2019s true that they\u2019re talented and hardworking, but they\u2019re also children who come from the large clans. Since their youth, they\u2019ve received the assistance of the best food, drink, and medicine, which is why they are able to attain a cultivation like theirs at such a young age. Wang Dong could\u2019ve also received treatment like this before coming to the Academy, but as for why you haven\u2019t obtained your third ring, in my opinion, it\u2019s very likely due to your laziness or a special condition in your body. Furthermore, if I haven\u2019t remembered it incorrectly, you just turned eleven.\u201dWang Dong nodded, \u201cTeacher Zhou, I\u2019ll definitely obtain my third ring before I turn twelve.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once you\u2019re done, go back and take a small rest. The afternoon match is going to start soon. I\u2019ll be reporting this matter to the higher-ups. If you\u2019re selected as a core disciple of the outer courtyard, the Academy will provide you these top-ranked dishes free of charge. I\u2019m pretty sure you can imagine how much this\u2019ll benefit your cultivation. However, possessing a martial soul fusion skill doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll definitely be selected as a core disciple. Remember, our Shrek Academy has no lack of geniuses. Your final ranking in the knock-out tournament will greatly affect your chances at entering the circle of core disciples. Truth is, I managed to graduate from the outer courtyard during my time, but I wasn\u2019t able to become a core disciple, much less obtain the qualifications to enter the inner courtyard. But for you two, becoming a core disciple is an important step that\u2019ll help you to enter the inner courtyard. Out of all the core disciples that\u2019ve been in Shrek Academy, over half of them managed to pass the inner courtyard\u2019s assessment. Also, becoming a core disciple signifies that you\u2019ll receive even more help from Academy teachers. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The two replied together. Then, they immediately gorged themselves silly.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong immediately acknowledged Zhou Yi\u2019s praise of the Academy\u2019s chefs. Huo Yuhao was still somewhat better; he\u2019d never tried these types of high-ranked foodstuffs before. However, Wang Dong differed from him. He\u2019d eaten these delicacies in the past, but the flavours created by his family\u2019s chefs couldn\u2019t compare to the dishes cooked by the Academy\u2019s canteen.Once they finished eating, the two instantly felt their bodies heat up. This was especially true for their stomachs; waves of warmth spread through their entire bodies, causing an indescribable relaxing feeling to arise. Sure enough, you really got what you paid for!Zhou Yi followed them all the way to the dorm entrance. Before leaving, she placed her hand on Huo Yuhao\u2019s shoulder and whispered, \u201cSince you weren\u2019t born as a noble, use your own strength to become one.\u201dWith that, she turned and left. Ever since the meal had started, her icy expression seemed to have disappeared.The old man who seemed to be the dormitory manager, yet never cared about anything, continued to lean on his recliner. He seemed to have heard Zhou Yi\u2019s words, and mumbled something in response, but nobody heard him.After Huo Yuhao greeted the old man as he usually did, he returned to his dorm room along with Wang Dong. They\u2019d just finished eating, but they had to cultivate for a while. After all, wasting time was disgraceful! Furthermore, the afternoon match clearly wouldn\u2019t be as effortless as the morning match.When the afternoon bell rang, the freshmen assessment\u2019s knock-out tournament\u2019s round of sixteen officially began.When compared to the morning, the number of competing students had decreased by a half. Once they drew their lots again, the students immediately headed toward their designated areas to start their respective matches.The layout of the area hadn\u2019t changed, as this match was being held on the same day as the previous match. However, only the first 16 battlefields were used for the matches.There was a tall stage erected by the northern part of the Assessment Area. This stage was 20 meters above the ground, and was supported by six metallic pillars. From the ground, it was impossible to see the number of people the stage contained. However, there were vague figures up there, as if there were people who were watching their matches. On the other hand, a distance of 20 meters from the ground was enough to overlook the entire Assessment Area, allowing the people up there to clearly see the state of every match.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weren\u2019t late this time around. Instead, they came to the Assessment Area very early to draw their lots, causing Xiao Xiao to sigh in relief.This time, they were assigned to the eighth arena. By the time they arrived at the arena, the other team who\u2019d been assigned to the eighth arena as well had already arrived.To Huo Yuhao\u2019s astonishment, their opponents were all girls. Furthermore, they were young ladies who were very pretty.The Spectator\u2019s Stage.Zhou Yi quietly stood on the stage, surveying the matches that were about to start. Class 1 had been the biggest winner among the ten classes during the round-robin tournament, but a few strong students had begun to reveal their true potential and strength when the knock-out tournament started. After the round of 32, only five teams from Class 1 remained. Although their numbers were greater than those from the other classes, their dominance was no longer that obvious.The round of 32 was extremely crucial.\u201cTeacher Zhou, are you looking for your seeded team? I\u2019ve just looked at the lots, and coincidentally, the seeded team you\u2019ve chosen just so happened to meet up with the seeded team from my class. They\u2019re over there at the eighth arena. Say, who do you think will win?\u201dA thirty-or-so-year-old female teacher had walked up to Zhou Yi, and spoken with an amused tone.Zhou Yi immediately squinted, \u201cMu Jin, do you think that your students will win for sure?\u201dAlthough Mu Jin wasn\u2019t young, her appearance could definitely be described using the words \u2018young and pretty\u2019. She smiled, shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. There are no absolutes in this world. However, I\u2019ve heard that there aren\u2019t any particularly outstanding talents from your class this time around. At the very least, I\u2019ve heard that you don\u2019t have any students who\u2019re above Rank 30. What a pity.\u201dZhou Yi\u2019s gaze turned chilly. \u201cAre you trying to provoke me?\u201dMu Jin\u2019s smiling expression instantly vanished, \u201cSo what if I am? Doesn\u2019t your Class 1 have good results? I want to see how many of the students who you\u2019ve taught can get into the top 8. When I saw that my seeded team was paired up against your seeded team, I felt very happy. Ever since you expelled my disciples even when I bitterly begged you not to, this is the first time that I\u2019ve felt this happy. I\u2019ve heard that you want to be promoted to a senior teacher, but aih, you might be out of luck again.\u201dHowever, Zhou Yi didn\u2019t pay attention to Mu Jin\u2019s provoking look. She cast her gaze down to the arenas below her, and fixed her eyes onto the eighth arena that Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was on. Then, she indifferently said, \u201cWould you like to make a bet with me?\u201dMu Jin\u2019s objective had been to enrage and humiliate Zhou Yi. Thus, she didn\u2019t hesitate to reply after hearing Zhou Yi\u2019s words. \u201cA bet? What\u2019re you betting with me?\u201dZhou Yi finally stopped ignoring her. Turning around, she spoke with a serious tone. \u201cOne soul bone. Do you dare to bet with me?\u201dAfter hearing the words \u2018soul bone\u2019, Mu Jin\u2019s eyes suddenly shrank.A soul ring was already an extremely precious item to a soul masters, as a soul master needed a soul ring to be able to breakthrough the existence known as a bottleneck.However, soul bones were a hundred times more precious than soul rings. Every soul master could fuse with six soul bones, which were the skull bone, the torso bone, and the four limb bones.Every soul ring could give a soul master one skill, while a hundred thousand year ring could give two skills. In other words, an ordinary soul master who managed to cultivate his way to the nine-ringed Titled Douluo stage should possess nine skills. On the other hand, soul bones were a completely different story altogether. Every soul bone would give a soul master another skill, and would drastically increase the strength of the body part it was added to.Soul rings were items that soul beasts would definitely produce, but that wasn\u2019t the case for soul bones; only hundred thousand year soul beasts would definitely produce soul bones. On the other hand, soul beasts below the hundred thousand year rank would only have a one percent chance of producing a soul bone! The appearance of any soul bone would definitely cause a scramble among soul masters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, a person would become even stronger if he possessed even more soul bones. From another standpoint, a soul bone could even have the same effect as a medicinal pill, as fusing with a soul bone would increase the soul power of a soul master to some extent.At this moment, Zhou Yi\u2019s suggestion of a soul bone was practically her bringing out a fortune to fight with Mu Jin. Hence, how could Mu Jin not be astonished? She didn\u2019t understand where Zhou Yi\u2019s confidence was coming from.A trace of disdain appeared at the corner of Zhou Yi\u2019s mouth, \u201cGet away from me if you\u2019re scared. I don\u2019t want to smell that nauseating perfume of yours.\u201dA fierce light flickered through Mu Jin\u2019s eyes. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll bet with you. Were you trying to scare me away using empty words? If I lose, I\u2019ll give you a soul bone. But if you lose, I want Fan Yu to make me a close-combat soul tool.\u201dZhou Yi coldly replied, \u201cI\u2019m the person who\u2019s betting with you, not him. If I lose, I\u2019ll give you a soul bone.\u201dMu Jin humphed, \u201cI don\u2019t want your soul bone. I want Fan Yu to make me a close-combat soul tool.\u201d\u201cFine, I\u2019ll reply on her behalf.\u201d A deep voice rang out. A tall figure had already arrived at Zhou Yi\u2019s side; this was the Soul Tool Department\u2019s Fan Yu, who Zhou Yi had taken Huo Yuhao to meet in the past.Once she saw Fan Yu appear, Mu Jin\u2019s expression immediately changed. Her previously arrogant and provocative temper had completely disappeared, and her face was somewhat pale. She took a slight step backward, and looked at Fan Yu with slightly red eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re teaming up with her to bully me.\u201dFan Yu\u2019s expression remained calm, but he furrowed his brows slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s pointlessly causing trouble for other people. If you want to make a bet, come; if you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t bother Zhou Yi. As for our relationship, we\u2019re merely co-workers, nothing else.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bet. Why wouldn\u2019t I bet with her? Even though I lost to her, it doesn\u2019t mean that my students will lose to hers.\u201d Mu Jin suddenly turned around, tightly holding onto the railings with her hands. Meanwhile, her already-tearing eyes turned towards the arenas within the Assessment Area.Huo Yuhao\u2019s team weren\u2019t aware that a scene like this had occurred on the Spectator\u2019s Stage; they were currently completely focused on their opponents.The three young ladies in front of them were very pretty. They wore freshmen uniforms, just like Huo Yuhao\u2019s team. The girl standing foremost was rather tall; she was even slightly taller than Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. She had short golden hair, and seemed extremely nimble. Her large blue eyes had long eyelashes above them, and there were a few cute freckles on her cheeks.The girl behind and to her left had short fiery-red hair, while her eyes were a rarely-seen shade of red. At a glance, she seemed somewhat scary, but if you observed her carefully, you\u2019d notice that her facial features were extremely exquisite. Her skin was jade-white, but the gaze in her eyes was extremely cold; she was even comparable to Old Lady Zhou.On the other hand, the girl on the right contrasted sharply with the girl on the left. A long head of light-green hair was draped over her shoulders, while her dark-green eyes were filled with warmth. The delicate feeling she emanated caused one to unconsciously feel the need to be tender towards her.The proctor announced: \u201cBoth parties, enter the arena and introduce yourselves.\u201dThe six people from both teams simultaneously entered the wide arena, and stood by their respective sides. Huo Yuhao\u2019s team of three maintained their original formation, with Wang Dong standing in front, Xiao Xiao in the middle, and Huo Yuhao right at the back.However, the three girls changed their formation a bit. The golden-haired girl who had originally been standing at the front now moved to the back, while the other two girls simultaneously advanced to protect her.The red-haired girl arrogantly announced: \u201cClass 9, Wu Feng. I\u2019m a Rank 25 Assault System Soul Grandmaster.\u201dThe green-haired girl glanced at her with a rebuking look in her eyes, as if she were blaming her for being too arrogant. She had even announced her own Soul Rank. However, she didn\u2019t change the format of her introduction. The contrast between her soft voice and Wu Feng\u2019s arrogant voice was as great as the contrast between their outer appearances. \u201cClass 9, Nanmen Yun\u2019er. I\u2019m a Rank 24 Agility System Soul Grandmaster.\u201dA monotone voice then rang out from the back, \u201cClass 9, Ning Tian. I\u2019m a Rank 31 Auxiliary System Tool Soul Elder.\u201dOnce her words left her mouth, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team was instantly stunned. A Rank 31 Soul Elder? They had truly never expected to meet one of the three Soul Elder-ranked freshmen just when they had gotten into the round of 16. Furthermore, she was even an auxiliary-type tool soul master.It had to be known that the cultivation speed of a tool soul master was generally slower than that of a battle soul master. However, their opponent had been able to reach Rank 31 and obtain three soul rings at the mere age of twelve. This was no longer just a matter of talent.Although they were astonished, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team didn\u2019t forget to introduce themselves. Since their opponents had started their introductions with their assault-type soul masters, they did so as well.\u201cClass 1, Wang Dong. I\u2019m a Rank 24 Assault System Battle Soul Grandmaster.\u201d\u201cClass 1, Xiao Xiao. I\u2019m a Rank 22 Control System Battle Soul Grandmaster.\u201dHuo Yuhao was the last to introduce himself, \u201cClass 1, Huo Yuhao. I\u2019m a Rank 17 Control System Battle Soul Master.\u201dAfter hearing the number \u201817\u2019, Wu Feng curled her lips in a very obvious manner, exposing a look of contempt on her face.Wang Dong slightly squinted his eyes, and fixed his gaze on Wu Feng\u2019s body. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt as if a fire had been ignited in his heart when he looked at Wu Feng\u2019s disdainful gaze.Wu Feng also sensed his gaze. Their gazes met, and Wu Feng snorted coldly. The smell of gunpowder had already appeared between both parties, even though the match hadn\u2019t even started yet.Huo Yuhao patted Wang Dong\u2019s shoulder, causing him to look back. Their gazes met, and although nothing was said, they both knew what the other person was thinking.Right at this moment, the proctor loudly shouted, \u201cMatch, start!\u201dWang Dong\u2019s feet tapped the ground, causing him to shoot off. His dazzling pair of golden wings suddenly unfurled as he charged forward.Regardless of how confident they were, they couldn\u2019t help but blink and secretly admire the beauty of his Radiant Butterfly Goddess\u2019 brilliant pair of wings the moment they set their eyes onto them.Likewise, Wu Feng let out a soft cry, causing her delicate body to suddenly spring up, A strong wave of heat then surged out from her body, even causing the soft cry of a dragon to ring out. Wu Feng\u2019s delicate body then suddenly became slender. As she jumped into the air, her appearance unexpectedly turned into that of a matured sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl. Her slender body directly tore her uniform, exposing the skintight clothes underneath.Clearly, she had already made her preparations. She wore an extremely elastic leather suit inside, exposing her large and delicate thighs. Furthermore, her leather suit was like a jumpsuit that got smaller as it went higher, enveloping her soft chest that had become plump after she released her martial soul.A light-red luster rippled through her skin. An exquisite set of dragon scales started appearing on her face and spreading downwards, following her arms until they reached her left arm.When Wu Feng\u2019s martial soul, which was also draconic in nature, was compared to Bei Bei\u2019s Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon\u2019s martial soul possession, it was much softer. However, that was only relative. The powerful aura of a top-ranked martial soul surged outward, causing two yellow soul rings to instantly rise from her feet.Wu Feng\u2019s figure seemed slender and pretty, but she gave off a feeling that made it seem as if she was filled with explosiveness. Her body flickered, and she instantly appeared before Wang Dong. Then, her left arm swept sideways in an attempt to whip at Wang Dong\u2019s body.Facing her tyrannical attack, Wang Dong didn\u2019t counterattack with a soul skill. Instead, his body half-turned in midair while his right leg shot out like lightning, colliding with Wu Feng\u2019s left arm.A muffled \u201cBang\u201d rang out, and Wang Dong\u2019s body was sent flying five meters backwards. On the other hand, Wu Feng was forced to the ground. Evidently, Wang Dong was the one who\u2019d suffered a loss during their initial confrontation. Although they were both assault-type soul masters, they had different strong points. In terms of physical strength, the Radiant Butterfly Goddess clearly wouldn\u2019t be able to take any advantages from the Red Dragon.At this exact moment, Nanmen Yun\u2019er made a move. In the instant she moved, her body was as light as a feather, as if she wasn\u2019t affected by gravity. However, her speed vastly exceeded Wang Dong and Wu Feng, who were fighting. With a flash, she crossed several tens of meters and arrived in front of Xiao Xiao.A pair of dark-green wings had appeared on Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s back, but were only visible after she\u2019d approached them. Her wings weren\u2019t large, and they definitely weren\u2019t as dazzling as Wang Dong\u2019s Radiant Butterfly Goddess. However, they caused Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s speed to become incomparably quick. At the same time, her hands turned dark-green in color, making them resemble those of a jade statue as she swatted at Xiao Xiao.Meanwhile, the distant Ning Tian extended her right hand, shouting with a clear voice, \u201cThe Seven Treasures revolve to produce a Glazed Pagoda\u201d. Then, she quickly spun around, causing a dazzling seven-colored light to immediately emanate from her body. This then caused a seven-colored pagoda that was a foot tall to appear in the middle of her right palm, where the seven-colored light had gathered.This pagoda flickered with an overflowing amount of color, making it seem as though there were an innumerable number of gems that had been embedded in it. Once it appeared, it drew the attention of everyone standing on the tall stage.Ning Tian\u2019s three soul rings, which consisted of two yellow rings and one purple ring, rose from her palm, circling the seven layered pagoda in a rhythmical manner.Up on the Spectator\u2019s Stage, Mu Jin turned towards Zhou Yi and Fan Yu, right in time for her to see the astonishment in their eyes. Zhou Yi couldn\u2019t help but cry out, \u201cThe Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda of the Nine Treasures Glazed Pagoda clan!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Immediately afterwards, two dazzling rays of light shot out from the pagoda and landed on the bodies of Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er.Huo Yuhao had activated his Spiritual Detection at the start of the match, but he discovered\u2014to his astonishment\u2014that he was unexpectedly unable to perceive the circulation of Ning Tian\u2019s soul power, nor the soul skill that she was releasing. Ning Tian\u2019s dazzling pagoda seemed to be emitting a mysterious soul power undulation, which was protecting her aura from leaking out. Furthermore, it was actually able to block Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection.Just what was this Tool Soul? It was actually this strong?The scene that followed caused Huo Yuhao\u2019s team to become even more startled. Wang Dong\u2019s and Xiao Xiao\u2019s situation suddenly changed when the two rays of light landed on Wu Feng\u2019s and Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s bodies.The speed of Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s palms suddenly increased as they swung towards Xiao Xiao, so much so that even a string of consecutive afterimages were formed in midair.If Huo Yuhao hadn\u2019t had his Spiritual Detection active, Xiao Xiao might\u2019ve suffered a great loss from this exchange. The instant that the ray of light had landed on Nanmen Yun\u2019er, Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection had warned her. At the same time, Huo Yuhao\u2014who was currently standing behind her\u2014had suddenly grabbed the back of her shirt and pulled her out of harm\u2019s way. However, she\u2019d only managed to dodge Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s palms despite this.Meanwhile, Xiao Xiao had activated her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, causing it to descend from the sky with a flash of black light. Once it landed, it caused a violent bang to ring out; Xiao Xiao\u2019s first soul ring lit up as her Cauldron Quake activated.From the start of the round-robin tournament till now, Nanmen Yun\u2019er could be considered the fastest opponent they\u2019d met. This was even more true since she\u2019d received the boost from Ning Tian\u2019s pagoda. Currently, her speed had completely exceeded the level of Soul Grandmasters; even agility system soul elders might not be able to best her in speed.On the other hand, Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection was even more important during direct combat situations such as this.After missing her attack, Nanmen Yun\u2019er immediately charged forward. From her viewpoint, she was confident that she could end the battle within the shortest possible amount of time by utilising her complete dominance in speed.However, a sense of crisis appeared in her heart the instant she charged forward. She suddenly forced her body to a screeching stop, and her first soul ring lit up, causing her hands to shine with a green light. One could faintly see that it had also spread to her arms, causing a thin layer of green light to appear around them. It felt somewhat similar to Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing, but was clearly much weaker.The instant that she, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron suddenly landed, separating her from Xiao Xiao.Nanmen Yun\u2019er had originally planned to dodge it and continue attacking, but the effect of Xiao Xiao\u2019s Cauldron Quake activated, stunning her.As a violent boom rang out, violent seismic waves covered Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s body, immediately sending her into a daze for a brief moment.The combination of Xiao Xiao\u2019s Cauldron Quake and Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection could definitely be considered a n extremely powerful weapon. Even with her swift speed, Nanmen Yun\u2019er had suffered a loss.The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron then charged forward, slamming her body away.When the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron landed on the ground with a bang and stunned Nanmen Yun\u2019er, the distant Ning Tian opened her mouth again. \u201cI call upon the second of the Seven Treasures: Dispel.\u201dAnother ray of light landed on Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s body after she finished speaking; even though her dazed state should\u2019ve continued for a few more moments, it was forcefully dispelled. She immediately moved backwards as fast as she could, while dodging the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.As Huo Yuhao looked at the distant Ning Tian, he was inwardly astonished. What a strong auxiliary system martial soul, and what formidable judgement! She didn\u2019t have his Spiritual Detection, yet she\u2019d instantly been able to judge the changes in the condition of the battle, and had supported her teammates without any hesitation.From the soul skills she\u2019d released so far, Huo Yuhao could tell that her first soul skill greatly increased the speed of her companions, while her second skill could dispel any negative effects or sealing abilities her teammates were afflicted with, thereby returning her teammates to their peak battle states. Regardless of whether it was battle experience or the strength of her martial soul, she completely deserved to be known as a Soul Elder-ranked expert!Huo Yuhao was astonished, but Nanmen Yun\u2019er and Ning Tian were even more astonished than he was. Their astonishment naturally had nothing to do with Huo Yuhao. From their viewpoint, the powerful person was Xiao Xiao, who\u2019d rapidly retreated and released her soul skill. Furthermore, the positioning and timing of the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron had simply been perfect. Furthermore, she\u2019d perfectly controlled Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s soul skill while simultaneously blocking her sure-kill attack, and had even narrowly counterattacked, forcing Ning Tian to use her second soul skill. The two girls couldn\u2019t help but view Xiao Xiao in a new light.On the other side of the battlefield, Wang Dong and Wu Feng were still stuck in a fierce battle.Both parties had top-ranked Beast Souls, but Wu Feng had Ning Tian\u2019s buff, causing her agility and attack speed to increase. At the same time, she\u2019d released her first soul skill\u2014Dragonfire.A dense layer of flames had shot out from her body, covering everything within 30cm of her. This made it so that all of her attacks possessed the high temperatures of Dragonfire, and made things extremely inconvenient for Wang Dong.However, Wang Dong\u2019s combat strength wasn\u2019t at all inferior to his opponent\u2019s. His second soul ring was at the thousand year rank, so the increase in power provided by both his soul rings was greater than Wu Feng\u2019s. The rarity of his Radiant Butterfly Goddess also surpassed that of her Red Dragon. Although his opponent\u2019s speed was raised, don\u2019t forget that he had the assistance of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection! Whenever he spread his Guillotine Wings wide, he wasn\u2019t put at a disadvantage. Contrarily, he was even able to place himself in an advantageous position by relying on the predictive ability of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection.Ever since he\u2019d fused his martial souls with Huo Yuhao\u2019s, a sense of mutual understanding had faintly appeared between the two of them. The effectiveness of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection had become greater when used used on Wang Dong, compared to Xiao Xiao. Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing would often slash straight at Wu Feng when even miniscule opening appeared in his head. Wu Feng\u2014who was currently being attacked\u2014felt as if her hands were tied. In her current state, she definitely felt that she was stronger than her opponent. However, she was unable to put herself in an advantageous position. She didn\u2019t dare to let herself be hit by Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing. On the other hand, Wang Dong\u2019s Guillotine Wing seemed like a parasite; before she could even make a move, her opponent\u2019s attacks would already be waiting for her. This insufferable feeling\u2014one that made her want to vomit blood\u2014caused her to let out a few screeches.Fortunately, her current speed exceeded Wang Dong\u2019s, and she was able to change her movements much quicker. Although Wang Dong could predict her movements, he still had to focus on defense. Even if he could predict where and when his opponent would attack, he\u2019d suffer a loss if he couldn\u2019t keep up with his opponent\u2019s speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even Zhou Yi was no longer confident. However, nobody expected that Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao would actually be able stand their ground while facing two strong opponents.Mu Jin muttered to herself with an inconceivable tone in her voice, \u201cThis\u2026 how is this possible? What\u2019re they doing? With a three-ringed Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda increasing their speed, their speeds should\u2019ve increased by 40%! At the very least, they should be as strong as Soul Elders; why can\u2019t they beat their opponents?\u201dZhou Yi turned around and glanced towards Fan Yu, who had an inquisitive look in his eyes. Zhou Yi nodded her head, causing Fan Yu to immediately understand what was going on. His eyes lit up, and he unconsciously glanced towards Huo Yuhao, who only had a ten year soul ring flickering behind him. He was currently the most inconspicuous person amongst the six people in the arena.\u201cIs it him?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dYes, it was Huo Yuhao.Ning Tian\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Pagoda was absolutely at the pinnacle amongst auxiliary system Soul Elders, but wasn\u2019t Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eyes the pinnacle amongst control system martial souls? Although he was currently only relying on a single martial soul, don\u2019t forget that he was fighting against two Soul Grandmasters and a Soul Elder! Despite this, he was able to rely on his Spiritual Detection to counteract the advantages of the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda.This was the strength of a million year soul ring. With the assistance brought about by his Spiritual Detection Sharing, he\u2019d managed to take control of the entire battlefield. However, Ning Tian\u2019s strengthening abilities only helped two people.Both parties were currently stuck in a deadlock. Although Xiao Xiao was able to block Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s attacks, she didn\u2019t dare to rashly make a move. This was because her opponent was simply too quick. At this moment, she\u2019d already released all three of her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldrons; only after doing so had she been able to protect the two of them under the guidance of Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection. In reality, she was still stuck in a passive state.Wang Dong was in a similar situation on the other side of the arena. If he didn\u2019t explode out with his power, he\u2019d only be able to maintain his current situation. However, for him to counterattack would be extremely difficult. After all, his opponent was too quick; one bad move would give his opponent a chance.A trace of doubt flashed through Ning Tian\u2019s eyes, thus she subconsciously looked towards Huo Yuhao. Xiao Xiao had a petite body, so she wasn\u2019t able to completely block Huo Yuhao\u2019s figure from view. On the other hand, Huo Yuhao was also looking right at her.Their gazes met, and Ning Tian narrowed her eyes in a somewhat chilly manner. However, Huo Yuhao nodded towards her with a smile on his face.Is it him? Ning Tian\u2019s heart shook. She looked at his soul ring, and saw that it was was flickering with a gem-white light.When the battle had started, their team of three had completely overlooked Huo Yuhao\u2019s existence; one couldn\u2019t blame them for doing so either. After all, how could a Rank 17 Soul Master, someone who only had a ten year soul ring, attract the attention of these Chosen?However, seeing that the battle had reached its current stage, Ning Tian realised that something wasn\u2019t right. She was also the first person in the entire freshmen assessment to suspect Huo Yuhao.How could a fellow who only possessed a single ten year soul ring manage to join Shrek Academy? Furthermore, his soul ring had been lit since the start of the match. This signified that he\u2019d been using a soul skill the entire time. After realising this, Ning Tian couldn\u2019t help but recall what had happened at the start of the match. At that time, Huo Yuhao had claimed to be a control system soul master when he\u2019d introduced himself.What was his martial soul? What sort of soul skill was he releasing?The instant she realized this, Ning Tian shouted, \u201cYun\u2019er, attack that one-ringed fella in the back.\u201dNing Tian played the same role in her team as Huo Yuhao did; she was the brain of her team.After hearing Ning Tian\u2019s command, Nanmen Yun\u2019er suddenly sped up. However, she didn\u2019t attack Huo Yuhao straightaway, nor did she attack Xiao Xiao. Instead, she turned around and instantly charged towards Wang Dong, who wasn\u2019t far from her.Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s current speed was simply too quick. Although Wang Dong was aware of her sneak attack due to Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection, his reaction to it was extremely rushed. Furthermore, Xiao Xiao couldn\u2019t make it in time to help him out.At this moment, their opponents fully utilised their advantage in speed in order to unleash a pincer attack on Wang Dong.Nanmen Yun\u2019er and Wu Feng were extremely coordinated with each other. In the instant that she made her move, a red light suddenly spilled out from her body. Her second soul ring lit up, and the Dragonfire around her body suddenly turned dark red. The dragon scales that were currently covering half of her body suddenly became thicker, and a her eyes shone with a red light. At the same time, her left hand completely transformed into the shape of a dragon claw.This was Wu Feng\u2019s second soul skill, Dragonfury.Both Wu Feng\u2019s attack and defense increased due to Dragonfury. At the same time, it also amplified the strength of her other soul skills, causing the intensity of Dragonfire\u2019s heat to practically double in an instant. This caused the air around her to violently distort.Nanmen Yun\u2019er also activated her own second soul skill; as she pounced towards Wang Dong, her yellow hundred year soul ring flashed. She clasped her hands above her head, causing a jade light to condense above them in the form of a crescent moon, which then shot directly towards Wang Dong.Her martial soul was the Jade Bluebird, while the soul skill she\u2019d used earlier was called \u2018Jade Blade\u2019, which turned her arms into blades. On the other hand, when her second soul skill merged with her first soul skill, it was known as \u2018Jade Slash\u2019.Agility system soul masters were always known for their speed and attack power, so the strength of this attack could be imagined. The jade-colored blade of light cut through the air in a beautiful arc as it swung towards Wang Dong. More importantly, this attack of hers had a lock-on effect, which made it impossible to dodge.Two Soul Grandmasters had simultaneously activated their second soul skills, and in addition to that, were launching a pincer attack on Wang Dong under the speed boost of the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda. They clearly wanted to end everything in one move, and take care of Wang Dong then and there, as he was the only assault system soul master on their team. After that, Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao naturally wouldn\u2019t be a match for them. This was a method of utilising speed; even if their opponent knew what they were planning, they\u2019d still be suppressed.However, how could Huo Yuhao\u2019s team simply sit and wait for death? If it were anyone else, they would\u2019ve been caught unprepared. However, their advantage lay in the fact that they\u2019d already predicted Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s attack the instant she launched it via her movement, as well as the circulation of Wu Feng\u2019s soulforce.They weren\u2019t able to do anything due to their inferior speeds. However, the three of them still reacted in three different ways.Xiao Xiao\u2019s gaze became focused. She raised her hands into the air, and her temperament suddenly changed. A gentle and beautiful look appeared on her face, and following that, the two yellow soul rings surrounding her were suddenly replaced by a single yellow soul ring. The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron simply floated above her head, while a jade-colored flute had appeared in her hands.This jade flute was extremely long, and there were lifelike carving of phoenixes on it. When compared to the steady feeling given off by the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, Xiao Xiao now seemed as beautiful as a fairy as she held the flute in her hands.Her soul ring quietly lit up, causing a peaceful melody to ring out. The melody didn\u2019t seem very moving, but it made everyone who heard it feel a tangible viscosity. Following that, a jade-colored halo spread outwards from Xiao Xiao\u2019s body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their movements suddenly became sluggish just as they were releasing their soul skills in preparation to launch a pincer attack on Wang Dong.\u201cTwin martial souls!\u201d Almost everyone in the audience gasped in surprise.That\u2019s right, Xiao Xiao was currently using her second martial soul\u2014the Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute. Although it only had a single soul ring, Xiao Xiao was still displaying the might of a control system Tool Soul Master.In terms of quality, there was still a large gap between her Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute and Ning Tian\u2019s Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda. Her first soul skill could only decrease the speed of her opponents by 20%. However, even though that was the case, it was still enough to considerably affect Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er, who\u2019d already adapted to their buffed movement speed. This, in turn, inhibited their pincer attack on Wang Dong.Of course, Wang Dong wouldn\u2019t just sit still and his opponents attack him. The instant that Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Detection warned him that something was off, his second, thousand year soul ring lit up.His dazzling purple soul ring instantly overshadowed the light of Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s soul rings. Following that, the brightness of Wang Dong\u2019s wings increased even more.The golden patterns atop his azure wings seemed to have been lit by countless tiny suns, causing it to burst forth with a strong radiance.These golden patterns gathered on the front side of his wings. He suddenly turned his left wing towards Nanmen Yun\u2019er, who was behind him. At the same time, he turned his right wing towards Wu Feng. Afterwards, the golden patterns atop his wings simultaneously erupted with a brilliant flash of color.Wang Dong\u2019s entire body was instantly dyed gold, causing him to become the most dazzling person amongst the sixteen arenas.Even the teachers within the Spectator\u2019s Stand who hadn\u2019t initially been paying attention to Huo Yuhao\u2019s match turned to look. When they did, they saw Wang Dong\u2019s dazzling pair of wings release a powerful attack in two directions at once.This was Wang Dong\u2019s second soul skill\u2014Light of the Butterfly Goddess.This was the first time that even Huo Yuhao had seen the true might of this soul skill.Wu Feng\u2014who\u2019d released her Dragonfury\u2014was swallowed by the golden light in an instant. On the other hand, Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s Jade Slash was only able to cut through half of the golden light before it was worn away. After that, the golden light similarly struck her body.Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er only felt something warm, before they were violently flung away. On the other hand, Wang Dong spun around in midair, before nimbly landing in an incomparably dashing manner.This was the strength of a thousand year soul ring!However, nobody managed to witness the hidden exchange that occurred between Huo Yuhao and Ning Tian.In the instant that Wang Dong had released his soul skill, Ning Tian had begun to chant once again, \u201cI call upon the third of the Seven Treasures-\u201d However, she\u2019d paused in the middle of her chant. Not only that, but her previous buffs on Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er had simultaneously disappeared.Because of this, the speed-reducing effect of the Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute\u2014which had been mitigated by her second soul skill\u2014was activated. This was also the reason that Nanmen Yun\u2019er, whose forte was speed, had been unable to dodge the ray of light from Wang Dong\u2019s Light of the Butterfly Goddess. After being struck by that seemingly warm ray of golden light, she\u2019d directly fainted.Ning Tian clearly wouldn\u2019t have made a mistake such as this. The factor that lead to all of this came precisely from Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spirit Eyes, which were currently glowing with a purplish-golden light. It had been his Spiritual Shock!His Spiritual Shock was precisely what had interrupted Ning Tian\u2019s buffs. Furthermore, it had even interrupted the thousand year soul skill that she\u2019d been preparing to unleash.There was a large gap between Huo Yuhao and Ning Tian\u2019s cultivation levels, yet his Spiritual Shock, fused together with his Purple Demon Eyes, had still been able to briefly stun even Ma Xiaotao, despite the gap between them.After receiving his attack, Ning Tian felt as if her brain had been stabbed by a needle, causing her to blank out for an instant. By the time she was able to resist the acute pain in her brain and come back to her senses, Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er had already been blasted away by Wang Dong\u2019s Light of the Butterfly Goddess.Wu Feng was a slightly better situation than Nanmen Yun\u2019er, as she\u2019d simultaneously activated her Dragonfire and Dragonfury skills, which had raised her attack and defense by a good margin right before she was hit. After taking Wang Dong\u2019s attack, she hadn\u2019t been injured that much. She rolled across the ground a few times, but she was able to stand back up. However, Nanmen Yun\u2019er had directly fainted after landing on the ground, in turn losing all of her combat power.\u201cNing Tian, what\u2019re you doing?\u201d Wu Feng looked towards Ning Tian with an angry look on her face.Despite this, Ning Tian merely supported her forehead with her hand. After recovering from Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Shock, a blank look flashed through her eyes. However, in the end, she was the core of their team, which was why she managed to immediately react.\u201cWu Feng, go all-out.\u201dAs she spoke, Ning Tian began chanting as quickly as possible, \u201cI call upon the first of the Seven Treasures: Speed. I call upon the second of the Seven Treasures: Dispel. I call upon the third of the Seven Treasures: Power.\u201dThe three soul rings surrounding her pagoda simultaneously lit up. As she simultaneously activated her three soul skills, the pagoda in her hand became extraordinarily resplendent, so much so that it even seemed to increase in size. Three rays of light shot out from it and landed on Wu Feng\u2019s body. At the same time, three beams shot out, turned around, and landed on her own body.Her second soul skill could dispel all negative effects that were used by auxiliary system soul masters. She didn\u2019t believe that Huo Yuhao would have another way to interrupt her skills now that she\u2019d used it on herself.After Ning Tian\u2019s thousand year soul ring took effect, not only did Wu Feng\u2019s speed increase by 40%, her strength also increased by 40% as well. When all of this was combined with her resistance to negative effects, she\u2019d be able to contend with assault system Soul Elders. Although they\u2019d lost Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s combat strength, they still had a high chance of winning the match.\u201cWang Dong, come back.\u201d Huo Yuhao shouted.Unlike Ning Tian, he didn\u2019t put up a false show of strength. Flapping his wings, Wang Dong quickly retreated to Huo Yuhao\u2019s side. Xiao Xiao\u2019s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron floated in front of her, and her two soul rings intersected with her other singular soul ring, allowing her to simultaneously release her two martial souls.Huo Yuhao placed a hand on Wang Dong\u2019s shoulder. After that, Wang Dong folded his wings slightly, perfectly covering Huo Yuhao\u2019s body. Other than Wang Dong, nobody else was able to clearly see what he was doing, regardless of which angle they were looking at him from.After Huo Yuhao placed his hand on Wang Dong\u2019s shoulder, they fused their soul power to form Haodong Power. This match had already become too challenging for them, and they could meet other strong opponents tomorrow. As a result of that, Huo Yuhao didn\u2019t want to continue wasting more time; he wanted to thoroughly decide the outcome of the match.Wang Dong could clearly see a purplish-golden light appear in Huo Yuhao\u2019s eyes. That mysterious light in his eyes instantly shot out a three-inch long ray of light. Although it disappeared with a flash, Wang Dong was still able to sense a terrifying undulation of spiritual power suddenly explode outwards via his Spiritual Detection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it were anyone else but Wang Dong, even if they weren\u2019t struck by Huo Yuhao\u2019s attack, they\u2019d still have been dazed for a while due to being in such close proximity of his enhanced soul skill.If Ning Tian felt as if her brain had been stabbed by a needle earlier, then this attack from Huo Yuhao was akin to a large hammer hitting her brain. Everything in front of her became white, and her body turned weak. She collapsed onto the ground, blood flowing out of her nose and mouth like tiny snakes.Her second soul skill could only dispel auxiliary system skills, but Huo Yuhao\u2019s Spiritual Shock was a spiritual-type attack in the truest sense of the word. How could her second soul skill cancel it? Furthermore, this attack had been launched by Huo Yuhao with the assistance of Wang Dong. Even if the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda was stronger than it currently was, it wouldn\u2019t have the ability to block spiritual-type attacks. From another standpoint, Ning Tian\u2019s buffing abilities had actually been perfectly restrained by Huo Yuhao.Wu Feng, who\u2019d already charged towards Huo Yuhao\u2019s team, instantly slowed down; the speed and strength buffs she\u2019d just received completely disappeared. Astonished, she turned towards Ning Tian just in time to see her falling body. She completely gave up on attacking Huo Yuhao\u2019s team. Instead, she turned around and ran to Ning Tian\u2019s side, picking her up and holding her in her arms.\u201cNing Tian, Ning Tian what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d Wu Feng immediately panicked when she saw the injured Ning Tian.Xiao Xiao suddenly turned towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, then whispered in an astonished tone, \u201cDid you two do this?\u201dWang Dong had a pleased smile on his lips, while Huo Yuhao shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like your use of the word \u2018do\u2019.\u201dThe proctor was slightly astonished as well. Only after Huo Yuhao reminded him did he announce that they\u2019d won the match. Even though Wu Feng still had an indignant look on her face, she simply wasn\u2019t able to fight against the combined attacks of Wang Dong and the twin-souled Xiao Xiao without Ning Tian\u2019s assistance and Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s speed. Furthermore, she was anxious to treat Ning Tian; she didn\u2019t have the time to care about the competition.Mu Jin was completely astonished as she stood in the Spectator\u2019s Stand; so much so that she didn\u2019t even dare to trust her own eyes. Her team had had two Soul Grandmasters and a Soul Elder! The latter even had the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda, which was known as the \u2018Number One Tool Soul Under Heaven\u2019. Despite all of this, they\u2019d actually lost to two Soul Grandmasters and a Soul Master, who only had a ten year soul ring.Not to mention her, nobody would\u2019ve believed the results of the match after hearing the difference in power between both teams.However, the facts were right in front of her: Ning Tian\u2019s team had lost.The trace of a smile appeared in Fan Yu\u2019s eyes as he said to Zhou Yi, \u201cThis was truly a marvelous match. Your students have astonished me greatly; especially that Huo Yuhao. I didn\u2019t think that he\u2019d actually have an ability like this.\u201dThere was only a gratified look in Zhou Yi\u2019s eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d As she spoke, she took the initiative to walk towards the stairs. When she walked past Mu Jin, she glanced coldly at her. However, she didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, she jumped forwards and leapt off the twenty-meter-tall stage.Fan Yu didn\u2019t even seem to see Mu Jin as he followed Zhou Yi.\u201cWhat did you guys do just now? Why\u2019d that Ning Tian suddenly faint?\u201d After leaving the Assessment Area, Xiao Xiao didn\u2019t forget to ask about the doubts in her heart.Huo Yuhao chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s because I used an attack fuelled by my spiritual power. She couldn\u2019t defend in time, thus she was knocked unconscious by it.\u201d\u201cAh? You can even do that? No wonder her soul skills were interrupted earlier. Was that you as well?\u201d Xiao Xiao\u2019s face was filled with astonishment.Huo Yuhao nodded and said, \u201cPerhaps this is an advantage of having a Body Soul. Furthermore, this was also due to my Purple Demon Eyes, which is a secret technique cultivated by my Tang Sect. I used the Purple Demon Eyes to stimulate my spiritual power, which made my earlier attack as effective as it was. As for why my Spiritual Shock became even stronger after I asked Wang Dong to return, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve successfully created a fusion skill.\u201dThey were all friends, and Xiao Xiao had done her best during their previous matches. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong would definitely need to use their Haodong Power during their matches in the future, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to hide it either way. It was fortunate that they\u2019d decided to tell her the truth, so as to avoid making Xiao Xiao feel alienated.Xiao Xiao stared blankly at them. She pointed at Huo Yuhao, then pointed at Wang Dong. After that, she blurted out a few words that made the two not know whether to laugh or to cry. \u201cI was getting more and more suspicious that the two of you were gay\u2026.\u201dHuo Yuhao scratched his head and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018gay\u2019?\u201dXiao Xiao took Huo Yuhao\u2019s hand and placed it in Wang Dong\u2019s hand. Afterwards, she glanced disdainfully at Huo Yuhao. \u201cHow could you not know what such a mainstream thing is? Being gay refers to the love between two boys.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201dHuo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously let go of one another\u2019s hands. With a bell-like laugh, Xiao Xiao immediately turned around and ran; she even remembered to release her Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute and play it so as to reduce the speed of the two guys that were chasing after her.Contrary to their high-spirited excitement, Ning Tian slowly awakened after being treated by a high ranking healing system soul master in the infirmary.After awakening, she immediately clutched her head in a fetal position. The intense waves of pain stemming from her brain filled her forehead with a cold sweat.\u201cNing Tian, Ning Tian\u2026\u201dWu Feng hugged her concernedly, while Nanmen Yun\u2019er stood to the side with a perplexed look on her face.Teacher Mu Jin had an extremely grave expression on her face as she asked the teacher who\u2019d just healed Ning Tian, \u201cJust what happened to her? What knocked her out?\u201dThe teacher muttered in response. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure. It seems like her head was struck by a heavy object, thus causing her to have a cerebral concussion. As you know, the brain is the most complicated organ in our bodies\u2014nobody has managed to truly grasp everything about it. As such, I can only make a few minor deductions about what happened here. However, despite her injuries, her soul power seems to have a very strong ability to adjust itself, so the problem isn\u2019t that serious anymore. She\u2019ll be able to fully recover after a short time.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d After thanking the teacher, Mu Jin walked over to the bed.After a brief moment of uncomfortableness, Ning Tian\u2019s headache gradually subsided, and her breathing became much more stable.Nanmen Yun\u2019er asked Mu Jin in a quiet voice, \u201cTeacher Mu, what happened? How did we lose the match?\u201d Up till now, she still didn\u2019t understand how her team had lost.Mu Jin had a grave expression on her face as she remained silent. Wasn\u2019t Nanmen Yun\u2019er\u2019s question the exact question that she had in her heart? She didn\u2019t even know how they\u2019d lost the match. Although she\u2019d been able to clearly see the entire match from the tall stage, she hadn\u2019t been able to concentrate on the minute details. This was especially so when Wang Dong had used his wings to cover Huo Yuhao, and in turn when Huo Yuhao had used their Haodong Power to activate his Spirit Shock. She hadn\u2019t been able to see anything then. Only Ning Tian would be able to quell their doubts, but that would be after she woke up.After a full fifteen minutes, Ning Tian slowly came to from her coma. When she opened her eyes, she couldn\u2019t help but furrow her brows. Her headache had already subsided by a large amount, and her train of thought had gradually returned.After Wu Feng helped her up and gave her some water to drink, Ning Tian\u2019s pale expression improved slightly. After seeing Mu Jin\u2014who was standing next to the window\u2014an ashamed look appeared on her cute face. \u201cTeacher Mu, we lost.\u201dMu Jin nodded and warmly said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t be too upset over losing this match. It\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re safe.\u201dMu Jin\u2019s words caused a warm feeling to appear in Ning Tian\u2019s heart. \u201cTeacher Mu, were you able to see why we lost from the Spectator\u2019s Stand?\u201dMu Jin was stunned. \u201cYou don\u2019t know either?\u201dNing Tian placed her hand on her forehead and started to concentrate. \u201cOnce I finished buffing Wu Feng, I used all three of my buffs on myself in order to protect myself. However, I saw a purplish-golden light appear in front of me right after I finished. After that, it seemed as if an enormous hammer struck my head. I can\u2019t remember anything else after that.\u201dWu Feng angrily said, \u201cThose bastards dared to be so vicious. Teacher Mu, we can\u2019t just let it go like this.\u201dMu Jin coldly swept her eyes over her. \u201cThen what do you plan on doing? This was just an assessment. Do you think that this is a sect war?\u201dWu Feng lowered her head and stopped talking. However, she clenched her fists tightly. Her eyes were burning with both anger and rancor.Mu Jin asked Ning Tian, \u201cThink a bit more carefully. Just before you fainted, did anything strange happen?\u201dAfter thinking for awhile, Ning Tian replied, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how they did it, the problem most likely stemmed from that one-ringed Soul Master. His soul ring was lit up from the start of the match till the end, which meant that he was constantly activating a soul skill that we couldn\u2019t sense, yet was still affecting the situation of the battle. I faintly saw a golden light flickering in his eyes. Their team had a very strong assault system soul master, as well as a twin-souled control system soul master. What qualifications does that one-ringed freshman have to form a team with those two? He must have some sort of special ability. During the most critical moment of the battle, he interrupted my soul skills, preventing me from buffing Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun\u2019er. At that time, my head felt as if it had been stabbed by a needle. However, his attack was much stronger the second time around.Mu Jin\u2019s heart shook. Right! That one-ringed freshman didn\u2019t seem to make any moves the entire length of the match. That soul master who had the Radiant Butterfly Goddess and the twin-souled soul master were the only ones who fought. Then, what role did he play in their team? No wonder Zhou Yi was that confident; that freshmen with that ten year soul ring must have some sort of secret.After calming the indignation she had in her heart, Mu Jin said, \u201cIf you lost, you lost. However, you should summarize your experiences and use them as a lesson when you do. In any case, you\u2019ve already passed the freshmen assessment. There\u2019ll definitely be competitions between you and them in the future. So, for right now Ning Tian, have a good rest.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Mu.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only Wu Feng stayed behind to accompany Ning Tian. Although the three of them were a team, in truth, only Ning Tian and Wu Feng were closely related; Nanmen Yun\u2019er was only a classmate of theirs.\u201cYoung mistress, we can\u2019t just leave this as it is. That bastard dared to hurt you! Shall we use the strength of the clan?\u201d Wu Feng said hatefully.An unresigned look flashed through Ning Tian\u2019s eyes. \u201cSister Feng, don\u2019t let anger cloud your reasoning. This is Shrek Academy. How can we rashly use the strength of our clan? Furthermore, we lost in terms of personal strength; we can\u2019t randomly accuse others for our loss. If we want to wash this humiliation away, we\u2019ll have to work hard by ourselves. Also, haven\u2019t I said this before? Don\u2019t call me \u2018young mistress\u2019 in the Academy. We\u2019re sisters here.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Wu Feng obediently replied, softly nodding her head as she did so.After pondering for a moment, Ning Tian said, \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find a way to watch their match tomorrow. As long as we watch them carefully, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a clue as to why we lost. They didn\u2019t rely on luck to beat us, they relied on strength. That student with the ten year soul ring seems to be known as Huo Yuhao; he\u2019s the one we should pay the most attention to. He could end up being our greatest opponent during our time in the outer courtyard.\u201dFortunately, the tournament\u2019s matches were held individually, which meant that there wasn\u2019t a large audience for each match. As a result, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team wasn\u2019t followed too closely.Aside from proving themselves, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team had had their confidence levels increased after both successfully entering the top 16 and beating one of the three strongest teams. Soul Elders weren\u2019t that scary; after all, hadn\u2019t they just beat a team led by a Soul Elder-ranked expert? Even an extremely synergistic team like Ning Tian\u2019s had lost to theirs, so the excitement in Huo Yuhao\u2019s team could be imagined.Huo Yuhao finally fulfilled his promise with Xiao Xiao. He first sold his regular amount of twenty fish, then brought the remaining fish he\u2019d bought to the forest and had a picnic with Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao. This went on all the way until the sky had become dark, when the three quietly returned to their dorms.Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong first went to clean themselves up. Huo Yuhao knew that Wang Dong was somewhat of a mysophobic, so he changed into a set of clean clothes. \u201cAre we going to do it on your bed, or on mine?\u201dWang Dong\u2019s face stiffened and he replied with a slightly angry voice, \u201cWould it kill you to add the word \u2018cultivate\u2019? Can you not make it sound so ambiguous?\u201dHuo Yuhao was speechless. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to Xiao Xiao\u2019s nonsense, I don\u2019t like you. I definitely still prefer pretty girls.\u201dWang Dong humphed. \u201cLet\u2019s do it on our own beds, your\u2019s is too hard.\u201dHuo Yuhao furrowed his brows. \u201cStop arguing, let\u2019s do it quickly. If we cultivate together, our cultivation speed practically doubles. Don\u2019t you want to quickly catch up to that Ning Tian in terms of soul rank?\u201dWang Dong smiled craftily. \u201cWho would want to argue with you? Who said that we can\u2019t cultivate together while we\u2019re sitting on our own beds? Drag your bed over and make a 50cm gap between them. That way, we\u2019ll be able to hold hands if we stretch our hands out. Furthermore, we\u2019ll be able to use the remaining space as the dividing line between our sides of the room.\u201dHuo Yuhao rolled his eyes. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of all of this? Aren\u2019t you just lying to yourself?\u201dWang Dong glared at him with his large, beautiful eyes. \u201cAre you coming over or not? If you aren\u2019t, I\u2019m going to sleep. I wasn\u2019t even a hardworking person in the first place. If it weren\u2019t for you, why would I even think of cultivating at night?\u201d\u201cFine, I\u2019m scared of you then.\u201d Helpless, Huo Yuhao could only drag his bed over next to Wang Dong\u2019s and sit in a cross-legged position with his palms outstretched.Wang Dong raised his hands to meet Wang Dong\u2019s, causing their Haodong Power to rapidly circulate throughout their bodies.Defeating Ning Tian today had been the first time that they\u2019d tried using their Haodong Power to activate a soul skill together. When they\u2019d succeeded, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had faintly felt that there was a chance for them to covertly turn all of their soul skills into fusion skills via their Haodong Power. When the two of them had gathered their soul power to activate the soul skill, it hadn\u2019t been as strong as a true fusion skill, but it had still distantly exceeded the strength of their usual skills. They\u2019d been able to smoothly defeat their opponents because of this.On the other hand, their match today had given Huo Yuhao a feeling of power for the first time ever. However, their cultivation levels were simply too low. It had taken the two of them working together to activate the soul skill for it to barely reach the level of a Soul Elder. After all, Huo Yuhao\u2019s own soul power was still too weak. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that his Spiritual Shock was a unique spiritual-type attack, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to win their earlier match as efficiently as they had.Only a single day had passed, yet a large number of freshmen had already been eliminated from the freshmen assessment. After the second day finished, only the top 16 teams\u2014or a total of 48 students\u2014would remain from this year\u2019s freshmen assessment. Everyone that had reached this point could be considered an excellent figure from this year\u2019s freshmen; so much so that they could even be considered as one of the most outstanding figures amongst their peers in the entire continent.During the lot-drawing for the top 16, Huo Yuhao\u2019s team saw a few familiar faces. Huang Chutian\u2019s team\u2014who they\u2019d beaten during the round-robin tournament\u2014had entered the top 16 as well.Huo Yuhao whispered to Wang Dong, \u201cHow long do you think the Lan sisters will have to rest in order for them to use their fusion skill again?\u201dWang Dong replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that long. Even though they\u2019re twins, their fusion skill wasn\u2019t that strong. I reckon that it\u2019s because their compatibility rate isn\u2019t that high\u2014their fusion skill wasn\u2019t explosive enough. Its ability to restrict opponents isn\u2019t too bad though. However, they aren\u2019t able to maintain the drain on their soul power for a long time. If we meet them again, you won\u2019t even need to make a move. As long as you help me activate my Light of the Butterfly Goddess, I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll be able to break their fusion skill.\u201dWhile they talked, they continued to observe the rest of their opponents. At this point in the tournament, Huo Yuhao was probably the only one-ringed Soul Master left.There were even more people in the Spectator\u2019s Stand today. The stands had already been filled up, despite the matches not yet being started. Strangely, there was an empty space in the middle of the stands that was about three or so square meters wide. An old man with disheveled hair and holes all over his clothes was sitting there with his legs dangling off the edge of the stand. He was drinking alcohol from a reddish-purple gourd that he was holding in his hands. In addition to that, there were a few pieces of fried chicken that had been placed on oiled paper in front of him. He was also holding a fried chicken leg in his off hand. As he drank and ate, he appeared to be extremely joyful.Every single person who was watching the tournament from the Spectator\u2019s Stand was a teacher at Shrek Academy, yet nobody had even dared to approach this old man, much less question him.Wang Yan respectfully walked over to the sloppily dressed old man and whispered, \u201cXuan Lao, you\u2019ve come.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d The old man simply snorted before he continued eating and drinking.Wang Yan pointed towards the stage below and said, \u201cThe three youngsters that I talked about are over there. Yesterday\u2026.\u201dWhen he got to this point, Xuan Lao impatiently waved his fried chicken leg around and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a look for myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
