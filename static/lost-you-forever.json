Some readers with their panties in a wad are still ripping apart Da Mo Yao, which was just a totally farcical take on certain historical figures which hardly merits a yawn much less a detail critique of why it\u2019s so inaccurate. I\u2019m far from that opinion and quite enjoy her take on Han and Qing dynasty historical lore mixed with some fanciful twists and turns. If anyone takes it seriously then clearly a Chinese primary school education has failed for said person. Her last two novels have jumped to a mythological foundation and with it goes most of what her naysayers can complain about her storytelling since the very premise of the famed Chinese mythological text The Cla.s.sic of the Mountains and the Seas is a collection of supernatural and fantastical stories of G.o.ds and demons and beasts that all roamed from the earliest dawn of time through the ancient Chinese eras before the dynastic ascension of human rule.It\u2019s a dense and meaty book that has no known author but the historians believe to be a collection of oral legends that were written down over time by various writers and later collected in the Warring States through the early Han dynasty era into the anthology known as The Cla.s.sic of the Mountain and the Seas. In Tong Hua\u2019s first novel in her series based on this Cla.s.sic, Once Promised interspersed the storytelling with a lot more background information about the mythology behind the world of the three G.o.dly kingdoms and it\u2019s political conflicts. Once the story gets to the sequel Lost You Forever, Tong Hua doesn\u2019t bother repeating the same exposition and instead delves right into the story of Xiao Yao and occasionally provides some explanations as it arises. I\u2019ve seen people asking for more backstory and it\u2019s really hard to go into it since Tong Hua drops it through each chapter of Once Promised rather than in a section that is easy to translate. She did, however, write a prologue to Once Promised that provides a very top down summary of the formation of the world of the G.o.ds leading until the three G.o.dly kingdoms period. Hopefully this will provide a nice clarity to understanding how the conflicts have continued from Once Promised into Lost You Forever.Prologue to Once Promised:At the dawn of time, when the universe was just formless chaos, the world had only one ruler. That was the Great Emperor Pan Gu, who opened the Heavens and created the world itself.At that time, the distance between Heaven and Earth was much closer. Humans lived on Earth and the G.o.ds lived on the Heavenly Mountains. Humans could travel on a sky stair to reach the G.o.ds. The Humans, the G.o.ds, and the Demons all co-existed together in the world.The Great Emperor Pan Gu had three subordinates that he was as close as siblings with. The one with the greatest spiritual power was a woman, but the time was so long ago that her name no longer can be found. Only known is that she created the Hua Xu Kingdom, so the people called her Hua Xu. The other two subordinates were men, one was named Sheng Nong and was stationed in the Middle Plains to ensure peace from all four reaches, and the other was named Gao Xing and was stationed to the East to protect where the sun rose the Holy Yang Valley and the Eye of the East Gui Xu.After the Great Emperor Pan Gu pa.s.sed, the world descended into fiery conflict and endless warfare. Hua Xu tired of the endless battle and left for the far reaches to create the peaceful and harmonious Hua Xu Kingdom. But what made her live on through the legends was not her Hua Xu Kingdom, but her two children \u2013 her son Fu Yi and her daughter N\u00fc Wa.Fu Yi and N\u00fc Wa were brave and just, subduing all the heroes of the world willingly and ending the warfare. They were crowned Emperor Fu Yi and Empress N\u00fc Wa.They brought peace to the bruised and battered vast wilderness, and gradually life began anew again.After thousands of years, Emperor Fu Yi pa.s.sed and Empress N\u00fc Wa was devastated. She left for the Hua Xu Kingdom and was never seen again. What happened to her remained a mystery and the Fu Yi and N\u00fc Wa tribes slowly lost prominence.With the downturn of the Fu Yi tribe, the Sheng Nong tribe in the Middle Plains and the Gao Xing tribe in the Southeast rose to be the two great powers. On the surface both abided by the pacted signed before Emperor Fu Yi and Empress N\u00fc Wa to never attack each other, but deep down each was bursting with ambition to devour the other.In the Northwest area of the vast wilderness, there was a una.s.suming mountain called Xuan Yuan Mountain. Living at the base of the mountain was a small G.o.d tribe that the powerful G.o.ds never took notice of \u2013 the Xuan Yuan tribe. After a great ceremony, the tribal elders of the Xuan Yuan tribe chose the bravest, smartest strapping young man in the tribe to be their leader. But even the tribal elders could not have foreseen what great feats and accomplishments this young man would one day accomplish.In another few thousand short years time, the young man expanded the formerly small Xuan Yuan tribe until by the time Gao Xing and Sheng Nong became aware of its rival existence in might, the time had pa.s.sed to eliminate Xuan Yuan easily. They could only watch wearily as Xuan Yuan vaulted to join them and become one of the top three greatest G.o.d tribes in existence.The three great G.o.d tribes. The head was Sheng Nong, the tribe that received the direct order from the Great Emperor Pan Gu to watch over the Middle Plains, and each leader of the Sheng Nong Kingdom was called the Flame Emperor. The Flame Emperor ruled by beneficence. The second was Gao Xing, under orders to watch over the Southeast, and each successive ruler was called the Grand Emperor. The Grand Emperor ruled by protocol. The last was the upstart Xuan Yuan based in the Northwest, its ruler was called the Yellow Emperor, and he ruled by law.From then on, Sheng Nong in the Middle Plains, Xuan Yuan in the Northwest, and Gao Xing in the Southeast \u2013 the three powers co-existed warily for thousands of years in a seemingly stable balance and division of power.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhy stick with a lackl.u.s.ter drama when there is an amazing book to be read. When a good novel comes along it\u2019s hard to put down, when a great novel comes it\u2019s impossible to not want to share. Last year right around this time I read C-novelist Tong Hua\u2018s Da Mo Yao (Ballad of the Desert) and fell promptly in love. I had finished her Bu Bu Jing Xin (Startling with Each Step) and wanted to keep on going with her lyrical prose and DMY was just the right type of soaring fun romance novel with a dash of historical flavor. After translating DMY I dived into its sequel Yun Zhong Ge (Song of the Clouds) and found it a much harder read but ended up appreciating it so much more when I decided to translate it as well. After tackling the early Han dynasty and romanticizing certain well-known historical figures during that era, Tong Hua\u2019s next ambitious novel endeavor takes her back to pre-history in Chinese lore. While Greek mythology of the Olympian G.o.ds and G.o.ddesses are well known in Western literature, Chinese literature also has one of its earliest written texts the Cla.s.sics of the Mountains and the Seas (\u5c71\u6d77\u7d93 Shan Hai Jing) detailing Chinese mythology of G.o.ds, G.o.ddesses, demons, and mythical creatures. Tong Hua takes on the events and famous mythological figures in this text as the backdrop for her two novels Once Promised (\u66fe\u8a31\u8afe Cen Shu Nuo) and its sequel Lost You Forever (\u9577\u76f8\u601d Chang Xiang Si).While Once Promised is soaring and fiery, action-packed and intense, it\u2019s the sequel Lost You Forever that really s.h.i.+nes as a masterful work of romance in an epic world building setting. The leads of these two novels are all mythological beings, the G.o.ds and G.o.ddesses and demons that rule over a world that is filled with magic and sorcery and power. These beings live for hundreds and thousands of years, and so their loves and pain and lost also feels more immense than anything Tong Hua has written before. Once Promised kept me at the edge of my toes when I read it, but it\u2019s body count is so high that pretty much every major character dies at the end, making Yun Zhong Ge seems like a trip to Disneyland in comparison. Translating that would be leading readers into a mora.s.s of tears and it\u2019s not going to be pretty. I hesitated to read the sequel Lost You Forever and waited until all three volumes were released before tackling it in case it was also a rocks fall down ending. It turned out to be simultaneously a happy ending and the most tears I\u2019ve cried in a long time by the time I stumbled by way through the epilogue. How can a story be this good, be a happy ending, and still so painfully memorable? That is the magic of Tong Hua\u2019s writing, and once she finished Lost You Forever she\u2019s revealed that this is her personal favorite book and what she considers her best writing to date. Tong Hua publicly says Lost You Forever is her best book? How can I not want to translate it. Care to dive into the magic with me again?Koala\u2019s note:I will try to add details from Once Promised (including characters and events) as I\u2019m translating Lost You Forever when a knowledge of the first novel is helpful to better understand what is happening. The setting of this novel is a world where powerful beings such as G.o.ds, G.o.ddesses, demons, monsters, fantastical creatures, etc. live alongside humans. The mythical beings live for hundreds and thousands of years and can possess various powers and magic. There are three mythical kingdoms \u2013 Sheng Nong, Xuan Yuan, and Gao Xing \u2013 that each govern a region of the world. In Once Promised, the Yellow Emperor of Xuan Yuan kingdom plots and successfully destroys the Shen Nong kingdom in an epic war, thereby tipping the balance of power. By the time Lost You Forever rolls around, the Xuan Yuan kingdom now rules its own territory and the territory formerly governed by the now destroyed Sheng Nong kingdom (all its royal family have been killed), and the Gao Xing kingdom has tried to remain neutral though aware that eventually Xuan Yuan will try to destroy it as well and rule the entire world alone. The female lead of Lost You Forever is probably one of my favorite heroines ever and totally different than anything Tong Hua has written before. She spends the majority of the first volume as a man (really, a man, since she can shape s.h.i.+ft).In fact, many of the characters in this novel will have multiple ident.i.ties and it\u2019ll become clear why as the novel progresses. It\u2019s really amazing so be patient. I will also refrain from showing hand this early \u2013 there are three male leads in this novel but I won\u2019t reveal which one had my heart (and yes, he totally has my heart forever and ever with how amazing he is) so as to not influence s.h.i.+pping. I can reveal that the s.h.i.+pping war in the Chinese novel forums are CRAZY intense. Way way way more heated than any s.h.i.+pping wars in BBJX, DMY, and YZG. For those of you who may have read this novel, please don\u2019t reveal the ending in the comments section please. This is a journey, a love story, a story about dreams and hopes and reality. Knowing how it ends doesn\u2019t mean anything unless you take the journey with the characters. The three male leads will be introduced with one in each of the first three chapters so get ready to start feeling around for what captures your fancy. Tong Hua\u2019s writing style has changed significantly from when she did her earlier novels so be prepared to be surprised in a good way. This novel starts off oddly with a very low key rescue in a very nondescript medical clinic in a hardscrabble town.Chapter 1 \u2013 Life is Short Like a Temporary Stay:That day, was the same as the last thousand days before it.A few rooster crows and there gradually was the sound of human life in Qing Shui Town. Lao Mu (Old Mu) from the Hui Chun Clinic hurried to pick up fresh lamb from Butcher Gao. Two helpers were busying for the start of the day\u2019s business.The town doctor Wen Xiao Liu (Xiao Liu means Little Six) had a bowl of lamb stew in one hand and a biscuit in the other and was squatting on the backyard stoop noisily eating. Past the steps were two pastures planted with medicinal herbs, and in between was a little pathway that led to a small river. The sun was just rising and casting a golden glow on the river surface. The flowers were blooming on either side of the river banks and the birds were flying and landing, lending it a very poetic view. Xiao Liu admired the view while thinking the swans must be very plump and would be tasty to catch a few and roast them.After the stew was in his stomach, he put the dirty bowl in a pail next to the door where other dirty bowls already resided. He picked up the pail to take down to the river to wash. There was a black shadow next to some water logs by the edge of the river and it wasn\u2019t clear what kind of bird it was. Wen Xiao Liu put down the pail and picked up a rock to toss at it. The rock hit the black shadow but it didn\u2019t move.Wen Xiao Liu was stunned, when did he ever get so accurate? He walked over and saw that it wasn\u2019t a bird but was a person. Wen Xiao Liu immediately turned around and walked to the edge of the river to wash his dishes, as if he didn\u2019t just saw something that resembled a human corpse.Wen Xiao Liu complained as he washed the dishes \u201cThis dish will get dirty at the next meal despite getting cleaned now. Why wash after every meal? If one eats out of one\u2019s own bowl, it\u2019s not dirty, so one can wash every few days.\u201dWen Xiao Liu never made his bed in the morning. If he folded his blankets he would just have to mess it up that night so why would he make more work for himself. Who\u2019s that stupid? He could get away with never making his bed, but he had to wash the dirty dishes otherwise Lao Mu would have smacked him already.Xiao Liu complained under his breath and rinsed all the bowls one time before picking the pail up and heading back, his eyes never once glancing towards the logs.The people of Qing Shui Town saw more dead people than people outside the town had eaten meals, even the kids were desensitized to it.Hui Chun Clinic may not be a large clinic but Wen Xiao Liu was especially skilled at treating infertility, with ten ladies coming to seek help and he could cure perhaps six or seven of them so the business of the clinic was pretty decent. After being busy for half a day, it was noon when Wen Xiao Liu wandered into the backyard moving his body after sitting still for so long.Ma Zi (his name is a derogatory term for someone marked with leprosy) was sorting the herbs in the backyard and pointed to the door \u201cA beggar came by and I tossed him half a biscuit.\u201dXiao Liu nodded and said nothing. The kitchen only stoked the fires twice a day morning and evening so Xiao Liu took a biscuit and a scoop of water from the water pail before squatting by the door and looking outside as he ate.Outside the door was a man sprawled on the ground. His clothes were tattered, his hair was matted, his skin was scratched and shredded, and he was covered in dirt. Other than his shape resembling a human being, nothing else looked like a one.Xiao Liu squinted and could see a dirt trail that had already been dried by the sun. It ended by the beggar and extended all the way to the river banks by the water logs. Xiao Liu raised an eyebrow and then took a drink of the water to help swallow the hard biscuit.He glimpsed from the corner of his eyes the black shape moving ever so slightly. Xiao Liu turned towards the beggar and saw that Ma Zi\u2019s aim was pretty good. The biscuit landed by his body but he appeared to have no strength to even reach for it so it just laid there. Xiao Liu munched on his biscuit and looked at him. After a few minutes, he finished the biscuit and wiped the crumbs with his sleeve, clapping his hands and tossing the water ladle back into the pail. He hummed a tune and went back to the clinic. It was evening by the time Xiao Liu came back and everyone noisily started dinner.Xiao Liu finished dinner and used the back of his hand to wipe his mouth before wiping the hand on his s.h.i.+rt. He intended to head back to his room but his legs had other thoughts and took him out of the back door. Ma Zi asked \u201cBrother Liu, where are you going?\u201d\u201cTalking a walk after dinner for digestion.\u201dXiao Liu took a stroll around the river and hummed his tune. As he walked back along the little path, he stopped next to the beggar and stepped on that biscuit beside him. Xiao Liu knelt down \u201cI stepped on your biscuit, what can I do to make it up to you?\u201dThe beggar did not respond and Xiao Liu looked up at the sky, the crescent moon hung cold and low by the edge of the horizon as if the Heavens were smiling with a mocking grin at the mortals below.After a few moments, Xiao Liu reached out and picked up the beggar. He was a man, his frame wasn\u2019t small but he was as thin as a stick and light as a feather. Xiao Liu carried him and kicked open the door, stepping into the backyard. \u201cLao Mu, Ma Zi, Chuan Zi, come help me.\u201d [Chuan Zi means a derogatory term for a hooligan.]The three sitting in the backyard chatting didn\u2019t appear to find this strange and immediately all went to help.Xiao Liu put the beggar on the bed pallet and Ma Zi brought in a basin of warm water and lit the flame in the room. Xiao Liu ordered \u201cWash his body, feed some warm soup. If there are any injuries, you guys take care of it.\u201dJust as he stepped out of the room, he heard Ma Zi scream in horror and Xiao Liu immediately turned around. He saw Ma Zi with an ashen face like he had just seen a ghost, and even his voice was shaking \u201cBrother Liu, you\u2026.you need to see this. This person can\u2019t possibly survive.\u201dXiao Liu walked over and took a good look. The man\u2019s entire face was battered and bruised so badly it was swollen like a pig\u2019s head. His features were completely indistinguishable. On a reed thin body, paired with a giant head, it was freakishly scary.Xiao Liu pushed aside his clothes, or more like sc.r.a.ps of cloth, and the man\u2019s entire body was criss-crossed with scars and wounds of all types \u2013 whips, knives, burns, and there was a completely charred path right on his chest that came from a brand. Because he didn\u2019t have any excess muscle, his bones protruded clearly and the burned skin hung on his rib cage.Xiao Liu picked up his hand and all his fingernails had been plucked off and the hand had swollen after being in the water. Xiao Liu gingerly put his hand down and inspected his legs. His right leg femur was snapped in half and all ten of his toenails were also plucked out. There were some b.l.o.o.d.y holes on the soles of his feet, clearly having nails drilled there. Ma Zi and Chuan Zi were accustomed to seeing patients but this frightened even them. Each took a few steps back and averted their eyes, unable to look anymore. Wen Xiao Liu remained dispa.s.sionate and calm, ordering \u201cBring some medicine.\u201dMa Zi snapped out of it and ran to grab the cleaning herbs and wanted to offer to clean the injuries but couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it. Xiao Liu knew he couldn\u2019t count on any of them and silently started cleaning the man himself. He used a clean cloth soaked in medicinal herb wabter and carefully cleaned the man\u2019s body. Clearly the wounds were hurting because the man woke up. Because he had an injury on his eyelids he couldn\u2019t open his eyes so he just tensely pursed his lips.Xiao Liu gently said \u201cI am Wen Xiao Liu, you can call me Xiao Liu. I\u2019m a small town doctor and I am cleaning your wounds. If it hurts, you need to cry out.\u201dBut Xiao Liu cleaned his entire body and he never made any sound but his forehead was beaded in sweat. Perhaps his fort.i.tude and endurance led Xiao Liu to develop some respect for him and his heart finally softened. He used a towel to wipe the sweat from his forehead and then Xiao Liu started to take his pants off. The man\u2019s body shook lightly, conveying a bone deep hatred that he kept under control.Xiao Liu wanted him to relax and joked \u201cYou are a man, how can you be afraid of a guy taking your pants off?\u201d After the pants came off, Xiao Liu fell silent.From his knees until the top of his thighs, some one the wounds were fresher than others so the injuries ranged from dark to light. It resembled a tattered rag that has been mended too many times. The person who performed the torture was clearly well aware of a person\u2019s endurance levels and also knew what areas in the inner though was the most sensitive. Every time he stabbed an area there, a man would have prayed for death but he wouldn\u2019t die. Xiao Liu ordered \u201cAlcohol, candle wax, scissors, bone cutting knife, boards, gauze, ointment\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dChuan Zi ran to get the items while Ma Zi stayed to help, but his eyes always averted away from the man\u2019s body.Xiao Liu saw Chaun Zi come back with ointment and furrowed his brow \u201cGo to my room and take a jar hidden on the bottom of my dresser.\u201dChuan Zi couldn\u2019t avert his eyes fast enough and paused for a moment before running off to get it.Xiao Liu was gentle as can be and fully concentrated on tending the wounds. But no matter the care taken, there were a mult.i.tude of wounds, some with rotted flesh that needed to be cut away, others with dead skin that needed to be snipped, and his broken leg needed to be set.Because of the pain, Xiao Liu could feel the man shaking but his eyes remained closed and he tightly bit his lips quietly enduring. He battered body was naked and everywhere was the signs of torture meant to degrade and shame him. Yet his behavior remained lofty and composed.Xiao Liu realized he probably reacted this way to the torture as well, the person being shamed having more dignity than the person shaming. The person torturing him would have been filled with even more rage and therefore increased the torture. After three hours, Xiao Liu finally finished cleaning all the wounds and he was also covered in sweat. He wearily said \u201cExternal ointment.\u201dMa Zi opened a jar and a light delicate scent wafted out. Xiao Liu reached in and scooped out a golden ointment with his hands and started applying it on the man, starting with his face.The cold ointment alleviated some of the pain and the man\u2019s pursed lips softened slightly. Xiao Liu saw the blood staining his lips and applied some ointment there as well. The man quickly tried to shut his mouth and took Xiao Liu\u2019s finger into his lips. It was the only time tonight Xiao Liu felt anything soft from his body.Xiao Liu was momentarily stunned but the man already opened his lips and Xiao Liu pulled back his finger. He gently lifted his arm and started applying medicine.After another half hour, the man\u2019s entire body was covered in ointment and wrapped in gauze.Wen Xiao Liu covered him with a clean blanket and softly said \u201cI will need to check on your wounds often these next few days so I won\u2019t give you any clothes. Don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t have any females in this household. Even if you flash someone, no one will make you marry her.\u201dMa Zi and Chuan Zi both laughed. Wen Xiao Liu started to recite the list of ingredients for the herbal medicine and Ma Zi memorized it and went to grab the herbs.Xiao Liu looked outside and figured he could still sleep for another hour. But then he saw the man\u2019s matted hair and he furrowed his brow before calling for Chuan Zi \u201cCloth, hot water, basin, pail.\u201d Xiao Liu sat down on the edge of the pallet, put his legs inside a pail, lifted up the man\u2019s dirty head and placed it on his knees to wash his hair.Chuan Zi sheepishly offered \u201cBrother Liu, tomorrow you have to see patients, go get some sleep and I can do this.\u201dXiao Liu scoffed \u201cWith your clumsy hands, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll undo my hours of hard work tending his wounds. You can just change the water.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s hand movements were gentle even more than usual, getting some suds from the soap and little by little was.h.i.+ng the man\u2019s hair. After thoroughly shampooing it, he ladled warm water over the hair to rinse away the blood and dirt. He used a scissors to snip away the ruined patches.After was.h.i.+ng his hair, Xiao Liu\u2019s hands moved across his scalp and he lowered his hair to check. He could feel the man tense up and Xiao Liu explained \u201cI want to check if you have any head injuries.\u201dThe irony was that the torturers wanted him lucid to feel every bit of the pain so they didn\u2019t harm his head.Xiao Liu didn\u2019t want to use any pressure so he used up many clothes gently drying his hair. He worried the hair brush would hurt him so he used his fingers like a thick soft hair brush to detangle the strands. After arranging his hair, he had Chuan Zi get a clean pillow before laying his head on the pillow.The sun was already rising when Xiao Liu stepped outside that room. He washed his face with cold water and ate his breakfast while ordering Ma Zi \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the clinic for the next few days just take care of him. Don\u2019t give him biscuits, just boil meat and vegetables mashed up to feed him. Make sure to cool it down first.\u201d Xiao Liu finished his good and picked up his basket of medical supplies and went to the clinic.Ma Zi spoke to the person laying on the pallet through the window \u201cBeggar, Brother Liu spent an entire night saving you and used up all the medicine he was saving for himself. You have to survive.\u201d When Xiao Liu came back in the afternoon, he was so tired and sleepy his eyelids were battling each other.He tossed a wild duck on the ground and went to the kitchen to get a bowl of hot soup, crumbling some biscuits to toss inside. He sat behind the stove and noisily slurped his meal. Lao Mu was rolling dough and said \u201cI heard about that man\u2019s injuries from Ma Zi.\u201dXiao Liu drank his soup \u201cUhm hmmm.\u201d\u201cMa Zi, Chuan Zi \u2013 neither can see it, but you must be able to tell. He is from one of the G.o.d tribes , and he is definitely not one of the lowlier types of G.o.ds like us.Xiao Liu drank his soup and didn\u2019t respond.\u201cKilling someone is just cutting off a head. These kind of injuries has a big reason behind it. Saving someone who shouldn\u2019t be saved is like bringing death to the door.\u201dXiao Liu chewed and said \u201cClean up that duck and put a bit of salt on it and nothing else, then roast it over a small fire.\u201dLao Mu glanced over and saw that Xiao Liu didn\u2019t care so he sighed and said \u201cUnderstood.\u201dXiao Liu finished eating and went to ask Ma Zi \u201cDid he eat today?\u201dMa Zi said softly \u201cLikely his throat also has an injury so he can\u2019t swallow. He couldn\u2019t eat the mashed soup.\u201dXiao Liu walked into the room and saw a cold bowl of medicine on the table. He helped the beggar up \u201cI\u2019m back. Do you recognize my voice? I\u2019m Xiao Liu, let\u2019s take some medicine.\u201d The man opened his eyes to look at him and he was a bit stronger than yesterday because he cracked open his eye a little bit.Xiao Liu fed his medicine and he tried hard to swallow but it was like feeding a child and it all dribbled out. The man tightly shut his eyes. Xiao Liu softly asked \u201cDid they torture your throat area, too?\u201d The man imperceptibly nodded.Xiao Liu said \u201cTell you a secret, I drool when I sleep. One time I dreamt I was eating a roast chicken and woke up with my pillow half soaked. I can\u2019t cure my problem but yours is just temporary. Under the care of a legendary healer like myself, I guarantee you\u2019ll be healed in a few days.\u201dXiao Liu crawled into the bed and cradled the man in his arms and took a small spoonful of medicine and dribbled it into his mouth a drop at a time. The man tried to cooperate and valiantly swallowed. In the end he drank every drop of the remaining medicine after a good half an hour later.The man was covered with sweat like he just ran many laps and was exhausted. Xiao Liu wiped his forehead with a cloth \u201cYou rest first and after the duck soup is done let\u2019s have some duck soup.\u201dXiao Liu walked out with the empty bowl to find Ma Zi, Chuan Zi, and Lao Mu staring at him as if seeing a ghost. Xiao Liu glared \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Chuan Zi spoke \u201cYou\u2019re even more careful than even taking care of a newborn. If someone didn\u2019t know anything they would think you were his mother.\u201d\u201cScrew you! You\u2019re his mother!\u201d Xiao Liu raised a leg and kicked Chuan Zi in the b.u.t.t.Chuan Zi grabbed his hurting b.u.t.t and ran off. Ma Zi and Lao Mu regained their senses and Lao Mu said \u201cYup, this is definitely Xiao Liu, not an imposter.\u201d Ma Zi patted his chest, comforted by the confirmation.Xiao Liu yawned and said to Ma Zi \u201cClose the clinic for the day, no more patients. I\u2019m going to take a nap and wake me up when the duck soup is ready.\u201dMa Zi wanted to say he could do it, but then he thought about the medicine feeding scene and realized it was as delicate as embroidering and he definitely couldn\u2019t do it.When the duck soup was ready, Ma Zi knocked on Xiao Liu\u2019s door and he walked out and entered the man\u2019s room. Just like how he fed the medicine earlier, he fed the man the bowl of soup after a good half hour.After letting the man rest for a bit, Xiao Liu rubbed ointment on his hands and prepared to help apply accupressure on the man\u2019s acupuncture points.\u201cYou\u2026..after being\u2026\u2026even though its been some time and some of the muscle has atrophied and is very painful, if stimulated this way it can help some recovery.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes were closed and he nodded.Xiao Liu smiled, after enduring that much torture and pain this would be nothing in comparison, but as he was ma.s.saging he kept talking to distract him \u201cAs I was walking to the clinic I pa.s.sed a house with vines and purple flowers growing all over the wall, and when the wind blew all the flowers came falling down like rain. I was so distracted because I couldn\u2019t believe this family would waste such delicious flowers which can be made into yummy biscuits\u2026..\u201dFrom outside the room, Ma Zi said to Chaun Zi \u201cI don\u2019t think Brother Liu will ask me to take care of the beggar anymore.\u201d The beggar\u2019s body was broken and frail and his ugliness was frightening to behold. Even Ma Zi didn\u2019t really want to keep seeing it.True to Ma Zi\u2019s words, Xiao Liu never asked him to take care of the beggar anymore. From feeding him medicine to wiping his body to applying ointment, Xiao Liu did it all himself.After a month, the beggar\u2019s throat injury was mostly healed and he could swallow but the habit was already formed. Every day Ma Zi would stand outside the room with a bowl of medicine and holler towards the clinic \u201cBrother Liu \u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201d And Xiao Liu would quickly finish with the patient and rush into the backyard room.After half a year, the man\u2019s injuries on his body was gradually healing. The nails on his fingers and toes were not completely grown back yet but he could touch water now. So Xiao Liu stopped was.h.i.+ng his body and instead prepared a tub so he could take proper baths.After being taking care of by Xiao Liu for six months, the man was no longer stick and bones thin but he was still very light. When Xiao Liu picked him up, he nagged \u201cEat more!\u201dThe man closed his eyes and said nothing. During this entire time he was like that. Every time Xiao Liu touched his body, he shut his eyes and pursed his lips. Xiao Liu understood. After enduring so much torture, his body despised any type of touch and each time he had to endure it.Xiao Liu put the cloth next to him and said \u201cYou wash yourself. Your hair isn\u2019t fully grown back yet so don\u2019t scrub so hard.\u201dXiao Liu sat to the side and munched on a snack and kept him company.Perhaps because each scar on his body was a type of shame, the man always kept his head raised and eyes closed as to not look at his own body. He took the cloth and started was.h.i.+ng himself. From the neck down to the chest down to the stomach and finally lower towards his legs.Xiao Liu\u2019s eyes followed his hand when suddenly he turned to the side and munched loudly on the duck neck, making crunch crunch sounds.The man\u2019s eyes opened and he looked towards Xiao Liu. The sunlight shone through the window and bathed Xiao Liu in light. His cheeks were red and it was illuminated by the sunlight like a piece of beautiful jade with red spots on it.Xiao Liu waited until the man was done bathing and carried him out of the tub. Because his leg wasn\u2019t fully healed, usually Xiao Liu helped dress him but today he just put him on the pallet and let go.The man kept his eyes lowered, one hand on the pallet supporting his body and the other clasping his robe shut. His hands were thin but very long, the newly grown nails white and healthy.Xiao Liu kept his head lowered and put the robe next to him \u201cYou\u2026.you try dressing yourself. If you can\u2019t do it then call me.\u201dXiao Liu hurried out of the room but stood by the door listening to the sounds, and when it all sounded normal that\u2019s when he left.Chuan Zi was sorting the herbs and saw Xiao Liu and asked \u201cHaven\u2019t heart him speak in half a year. What if he\u2019s stupid?\u201dMa Zi smacked Chuan Zi \u201cShut your brainless trap! After enduring unspeakable torture, even surviving is a source of admiration. The willpower, he can\u2019t be a stupid person.\u201dMa Zi asked \u201cIs his vocal chords damaged and now he can\u2019t speak?\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cI checked his throat and while there is an injury and his voice will sound different than before but he should be able to talk.\u201dMa Zi was happy \u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cWith respect to his injuries, regardless of whether you\u2019ve seen it, from now on it\u2019s never to be brought up again.\u201dChuan Zi raised a hand \u201cI never had the guts to look in the first place so I saw nothing.\u201dMa Zi added \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lao Mu already reminded us. I have a bad memory, forgot other people\u2019s business, I forget my own stuff all the time.\u201dThe door opened and the man supported himself on the wall and wobbled outside.In the past it was usually dusk when Xiao Liu carried him outside to get some sun and fresh air. Today was the first time he came out during the day into the yard. He leaned against the wall and raised his head to silently look at the blue sky and white clouds.Ma Zi and Chuan Zi gaped at the man. Because his injuries left them such an unpleasant memory, they always avoided looking at him. Chuan Zi even refused to enter his room.This was the first time either of them clearly look at him. He had long black eyebrows, sparkling eyes, a high straight nose, his simple cheap wool clothes was worn with elegance and sophistication. In a second both Ma Zi and Chuan Zi felt so unworthy and also in awe. Xiao Liu rubbed some dry gra.s.s and said \u201cIf your legs don\u2019t hurt too much, try moving around more. You should be able to leave in 3 to 4 months.\u201dThe man lowered his head and looked directly at Xiao Liu \u201cI. Have. No. Place. To. Go.\u201d He likely hadn\u2019t spoken a word in a few years and his voice was scratchy but his enunciation was clear. Xiao Liu leaned back and propped his feet up while chewing the dry gra.s.s \u201cNo place to go? Is that true?\u201dThe man nodded.Xiao Liu asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dThe man shook his head.\u201cYou don\u2019t know? Don\u2019t remember? Don\u2019t want to tell me?\u201d\u201cYou. Saved me. I. Am. Your servant. Give name.\u201dXiao Liu spit out the dry gra.s.s wad \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like someone who serves and would listen to orders. I don\u2019t want you.\u201dThe man kept his eyes lowered \u201cI. Listen. To you.\u201dXiao Liu chewed more dry gra.s.s \u201cIn the future if you see people who know you, you will still listen to me?\u201dThe man pursed his lips and his hand lightly gripped the bannister, his face pale and he remained silent.Xiao Liu was about to scoff when he raised his eyes and looked directly at him \u201cI listen!\u201d In his clear eyes there appeared to be flas.h.i.+ng embers as if branding the word \u201clisten\u201d in his heart. Xiao Liu hesitated for a moment and then said \u201cThen you can stay.\u201dThe man\u2019s lips moved as if he wanted to smile but he didn\u2019t. Xiao Liu tossed him some dry gra.s.s \u201cGo sit somewhere and chew this.\u201dThe man obediently sat down on the stone steps to the side and slowly tore off some dry gra.s.s and put it in his mouth.Despite eating the same dry gra.s.s, his movements were refined and gave off the impression that he wasn\u2019t eating dry gra.s.s but the fruit of the G.o.ds from the mountains.\u201cYa, that beggar, this dry gra.s.s is good for your throat\u201dMa Zi scratched hus head and said to Xiao Liu \u201cBrother Liu, give him a name, we can\u2019t keep calling him beggar.\u201d Xiao Liu said \u201cThen call him Gan Cao (dry gra.s.s) then.\u201d\u201cNO!!!!\u201d Both Ma Zi and Chuan Zi objected \u201cGive him a better name, not like our names.\u201dXiao Liu smacked them both \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our names?\u201d\u201cOur names suit us, but it doesn\u2019t suit him.\u201d Chuan Zi said very sincerely and Ma Zi nodded his agreement.Xiao Liu stared at the beggar guy sitting on the stone steps and then stuck his head close to Ma Zi and Chuan Zi and pointed to himself asking incredulously \u201cI\u2019m not as good as him?\u201dChuan Zi carefully asked \u201cDoes Brother Liu want to hear the truth or not the truth?\u201dMa Zi consoled him \u201cBrother Liu, some people were born on top of the clouds, others are no better than dirt. There is nothing to compare. Let\u2019s be accepting and live our dirt life as best as can be.\u201dXiao Liu raged \u201cI want to call him Dirt then!\u201dMa Zi and Chuan Zi both yelled \u201cNooooooo!\u201dMa Zi wanted the beggar not to be angry at him in the future over a terrible name so begged \u201cBrother Liu, think of another name please.\u201dChuan Zi also said \u201cYes, yes, think of another name, another name as good as Brother Liu\u2019s name.\u201dXiao Liu got all excited and reached for a medicinal herb from the basket and tossed it to Ma Zi. \u201cCount the leaves and that will be his name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..1, 2\u2026\u2026\u2026.17 leaves.\u201dXiao Liu turned around and yelled \u201cBeggar, from now on your name is Ye s.h.i.+ Qi\u201d (Ye means leaves and s.h.i.+ Qi means 17 so his name means 17 leaves).Ye s.h.i.+ Qi nodded and Ma Zi and Chuan Zi thought about it and decided it wasn\u2019t bad. They both laughed and went to say hi to s.h.i.+ Qi.Lao Mu called from the front \u201cXiao Liu, a patient is here.\u201dXiao Liu kicked both Ma Zi and Chuan Zi in the b.u.t.t and hummed a ditty as he went out to see a patient.Time flew by and another half a year pa.s.sed. s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s injuries that could heal were all healed and the ones that couldn\u2019t heal that was it. The bone break in his femur was reattached but too much time had pa.s.sed so when he walked he limped. How the wounds in areas that couldn\u2019t be seen were healing, Xiao Liu didn\u2019t know since s.h.i.+ Qi never allowed him to help apply the medicine after he could do it himself.Ma Zi secretly gave s.h.i.+ Qi some of his secreted away savings \u201cOur little Hui Chun Clinic\u2026..heh heh\u2026..you can tell Brother Liu\u2019s medical skills isn\u2019t all that\u2026..heh heh\u2026\u2026.have you heard of the Flame Emperor\u2019s Sheng Nong Clan? If you go to the other end of town, there is the Bao Cao clinic run by a doctor who is a many generation descendant of the Sheng Nong clan. His skills are very impressive and perhaps can heal your leg.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi silently handed the money back to Ma Zi.Ma Zi got impatient \u201cDon\u2019t! You can repay me slowly but your leg is a big deal. You can pay me interest if you want then.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi kept his head lowered and said \u201cThis. Is good.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s good about it? Do you want to be a cripple for the rest of your life?\u201d\u201cHe. Doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who doesn\u2019t care?\u201d Ma Zi scratched his head \u201cOh! You say that as long as Brother Liu doesn\u2019t care about it? How does that help you if he doesn\u2019t care? Look at how lazy he is, he can eat a meal with a bowl and use the same dirty bowl for another meal. His clothes are used like dirty rags\u2026\u2026.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi glanced behind Ma Zi who wanted to keep talking sense into s.h.i.+ Qi when suddenly he was smacked upside the back of his head so he immediately shut up.Xiao Liu\u2019s head popped into view and he took the money from Ma Zi\u2019s \u201cOh, quite a lot of money! Tonight we can have a big feast!\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s eyes pop around money and he didn\u2019t even care what Ma Zi was doing sneaking around with the money. He grabbed the money and rushed outside, with Ma Zi crying and chasing behind him \u201cNoooooo, Brother Liu, that money is my savings so I can take a wife\u2026\u2026I need it to do proper stuff\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThat night everyone feasted on meat and fish, with Xiao Liu and Chuan Zi happily stuffing their faces, and Ma Zi eating as much as he could otherwise it would all be for naught though it pained him to the core, while Lao Mu sipped his wine and stared at s.h.i.+ Qi.After eating, Xiao Liu, Ma Zi, and Chuan Zi were all pa.s.sed out drink asleep. Today was supposed to be Xiao Liu\u2019s ch.o.r.e to do the dishes, but no one remembered when their ch.o.r.e list changed at Hui Chun Clinic that s.h.i.+ Qi did his own a.s.signed ch.o.r.es but also did all of Xiao Liu\u2019s a.s.signed ch.o.r.es. s.h.i.+ Qi collected all the dishes and grabbed a pail of water and sat down in the yard to wash the dishes.Lao Mu stood behind him and asked \u201cWho are you?\u201dIn the sound of the evening breeze, a scratchy voice replied \u201cI am. Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dKoala post-script:In case it\u2019s not clear, Xiao Liu is our female lead. Or he will become a 'she\u201d once he reverts back to his true self \u2013 her real ident.i.ty is the Crown Princess of the Gao Xing Kingdom and her real name is Jiu Yao. Her father is Shao Hao the Emperor of Gao Xing and her mother is Ah Heng the Crown Princess of the Xuan Yuan kingdom. For those who have read Once Promised, the truth is her real birth father was Qi Yo, the greatest general of the Sheng Nong Kingdom. The reason she is posing as a he and living not as royalty in her kingdom but hiding in some d.i.n.ky town will become clear as the story progresses. Of course it\u2019s clear just from this first chapter that the poor tortured s.h.i.+ Qi is definitely more than meets the eye. He is one of our male leads but leave some room for the other two. All three are pretty amazing in their own way. Once the leads are all out I\u2019ll do a legend to keep track of names since everyone has at least two names/ident.i.ties here. This chapter feels ordinary and slow but it\u2019s because the world all these people live in is so very extraordinary. So the simple stuff you\u2019ll all later come to remember fondly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s a little medical clinic run by a cra.s.s young man named Xiao Liu, and one day he rescues a tortured man on the verge of death. When Xiao Liu saves the life of s.h.i.+ Qi, it starts the strings of fate that will bind them together. For now at least, s.h.i.+ Qi is just s.h.i.+ Qi in the same way Xiao Liu is just Xiao Liu. Whatever they are both running from, whatever grand destiny they were each born into, right now they don\u2019t need to face it just yet. But Xiao Liu is really just a trouble magnet is how I see it, and he\u2019s about to run smack into another fated meeting that will also lead to some kind of forever. Is it destined to be love? Hate? Misunderstanding? Xiao Liu is a major softy inside even when he acts like he couldn\u2019t care less, so with every connection he starts making as the story takes off, he\u2019s walking towards a world he doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge. I\u2019ll keep using \u201che\u201d when I talk about Xiao Liu until the time comes when our leading lady finally takes off her male ident.i.ty and returns to being the princess with the most powerful lineage even within the powerful world of the G.o.ds and G.o.ddesses. Until Xiao Liu decides he wants to be Xiao Yao, let\u2019s enjoy his adventures and misadventures in little Qing Shui Town with his motley crew of odds and ends.Chapter 2 \u2013 The Road Ahead is Unknown:Qing Shui Town wasn\u2019t big but it was a very unique place in the vast wilderness. From North to South it was tightly bordered by mountain ranges that were treacherous, creating natural barriers. After the Sheng Nong Kingdom was destroyed, the Sheng Nong Kingdom\u2019s General Gong Gong refused to surrender. He controlled tens of thousands of soldiers stationed in the area to the East of Qing Shui Town and from there he continued to battle the Yellow Emperor.In addition to having the General Gong Gong army to the East,\u00a0Qing Shui Town was West of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom and North of the Gao Xing Kingdom. It wasn\u2019t under the control of the Grand Emperor of the Gao Xing Kingdom nor the Yellow Emperor of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom. Gradually Qing Shui Town became an area muddled with all three influences but neither of the three powers could control it.Inside Qing Shui Town, there was no royal power, no influential families, no rich or poor, and definitely no distinction between G.o.ds and demons.If a person had a skill, whether he be G.o.d or demon, previously an official or a bandit, the person could openly seek a living and no one cared about the past. Gradually all sorts of people gathered here.Due to the nonstop warfare for the past few hundred years, the blood, corpses, and reborn lives forged a lot of blacksmiths and healers. The weapons and medical skills of Qing Shui Town was relatively famous.If there were blacksmiths and healers, then people would come to buy weapons and seek medical help. When there were men, then there were brothels. When there were women, then there were milliners. If there were men and women, then came the restaurants and tea shops\u2026.Not sure if the chicken or the egg came first, but now Qing Shui Town was bustling with people and it didn\u2019t even seem like a location at the front line of an ongoing war.Hui Chun Clinic was situated in a small location in the Western part of town. Because the compet.i.tion was fierce and a clinic was especially hard to run, Ma Zi and Chuan Zi told Ye s.h.i.+ Qi that people once came to shut them down. But Lao Mu was a deserter from the Xuan Yuan army, and despite being just a lowly G.o.d he still had some spiritual power and could handle a few people. Xiao Liu\u2019s medical skills were just average so the other clinics didn\u2019t even bother trying to win any business back. So the business at the Hui Chun Clinic was just so-so, enough the feed and clothe their group of five.Two years had pa.s.sed and s.h.i.+ Qi still looked thin and weak. But his strength was stronger than anyone suspected. Carrying water pails, cutting wood, brewing medicine, grinding herbs, he could do it all. He had an especially keen memory.Ma Zi and Chuan Zi followed Xiao Liu for over ten years and still couldn\u2019t remember some of the herbs. s.h.i.+ Qi was different, whatever the herb if he heard it once from Xiao Liu he would remember it.Gradually Xiao Liu started taking him everywhere, he was strong, had a good memory, very reticent, did anything he was told, he was literally the perfect person to ask to do bad things like murder and mayhem.After dinner that night the five of them sat together. Under Ma Zi and Chuan Zi\u2019s begging, Xiao Liu counted all of their money and sighed \u201cThere are more men in Qing Shui Town than woman. Finding a woman to sleep with a few times mean spending money at the brothel. But marrying a wife to sleep with every night is going to be hard. In the short term, sleeping with a prost.i.tute is a better deal. But for the long term, marrying a wife to sleep with at home is a better bargain.\u201dMa Zi and Chuan Zi both stared dumbstruck at Xiao Liu. Lao Mu\u2019s old face was wrinkled like a chrysanthemum while s.h.i.+ Qi had his head lowered but his lips slightly tilted upward. Xiao Liu asked them \u201cDo you guys want to sleep around a few times now, or hold off and endure a few more years until you save up enough money to find one to sleep with every night?\u201dMa Zi said very sternly \u201cBrother Liu, marrying a wife is not to bring home to sleep with every night.\u201d\u201cYou spend big money to marry a woman and you don\u2019t want to sleep with her?\u201d Xiao Liu was about to flip the table.\u201cOf course not, I meant she\u2019s not ONLY for sleeping with. It\u2019s for eating with and talking to, a companion.\u201dXiao Liu huffed \u201cI eat with you and talk with you and keep you company. So why do you still want a wife then?\u201d\u201cBecause my wife can sleep with me and you can\u2019t\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re marrying a wife just to sleep with her.\u201dMa Zi sat down wearily \u201cFine, just call it marrying to sleep with.\u201d He grabbed Chuan Zi\u2019s hand \u201cDon\u2019t listen to Brother Liu, be patient and save money. Our own wives are better than prost.i.tutes. It really isn\u2019t just for sleeping with.\u201d Lao Mu laughed and patted Ma Zi \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brother Liu and I will help you guys save up enough money.\u201dMa Zi and Chuan Zi went to sleep and s.h.i.+ Qi was sent back to his room as well.Lao Mu said to Xiao Liu \u201cChuan Zi can wait but Ma Zi\u2019s marriage can\u2019t be delayed any longer. Ma Zi likes the daughter of Butcher Gao and if we don\u2019t put down a marital offer then Ma Zi\u2019s good bride will be taken. I thought about going into the mountains to dig up better herbs, and maybe if I\u2019m lucky to find some spiritual plants\u2026..Xiao Liu said \u201cThe mountains are the territory of the Sheng Nong resistance army. You\u2019re a Xuan Yuan army deserter, going there would be asking to die. Plus you don\u2019t know those herbs. I\u2019ll go.\u201dLao Mu replied \u201cThe Gong Gong controlled resistance army is fair and principled, they won\u2019t harm innocents and even ordinary humans aren\u2019t scared of running into Sheng Nong soldiers. But that Lieutenant General Xiang Liu is very difficult. Rumors say he is a Nine-headed Demon. He has nine lives and his nickname is Nine Lives. He is vicious and brutal.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cI\u2019m not going to scout intelligence, I\u2019m going to get spiritual plants. He may be vicious but he has to follow army rules. Plus I\u2019ll never run into someone as powerful and lofty as General\u00a0Xiang Liu.\u201dLao Mu was thinking the same thing. He was in multiple battles before and forget Nine Lives Xiang Liu, he\u2019s never even run into army officials ranked several ranks above him before.He felt rea.s.sured and reminded Xiao Liu to be careful and not go where not needed and if no spiritual plants are found then to come back and they can think of another way.Xiao Liu was worried about Ma Zi and Chuan Zi\u2019s stopping him so he prepared and left before sunrise. Humming a small tune and gnawing on a chicken feet, Xiao Liu walked and felt something was off. He turned around and s.h.i.+ Qi was silently behind him. Xiao Liu waved \u201cWhy did you follow me? I\u2019m off to the mountains to gather herbs. You hurry home.\u201dXiao Liu kept walking but so did s.h.i.+ Qi kept following. Xiao Liu put his hands on his hips and raised his voice \u201cHey! I told you to go home. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi quietly stood still with his eyes lowered and his silence conveying his determination. Maybe it was that their destiny started with pity so Xiao Liu was quick to soften towards him. He asked \u201cAre you a Shen Nong deserter?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi shook his head. \u201cAre you a Xuan Yuan soldier?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi shook his head. \u201cAre you a Gao Xing spy?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi shook his head. Xiao Liu smiled \u201cThen you can head into the mountains. Follow me.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi took the basket from Xiao Liu\u2019s back and his little bag of snacks. Xiao Liu finished gnawing on the chicken feet and s.h.i.+ Qi pa.s.sed him the bag and he grabbed a duck neck. He finished the duck neck and was about to wipe his hands on his robe when a clean cloth was handed to him. Xiao Liu giggled and wiped his hands clean. s.h.i.+ Qi handed him a jug and Xiao Liu took a swig of plum wine and burped. He felt these days life was sure sweet! The two of them walked the entire day and it was dusk when they entered the mountains.Xiao Liu found an area near a water supply and used herb powder to sprinkle a circle around them. \u201cThere are lots of beasts in the mountains. Don\u2019t step outside the circle at night. I\u2019ll go fetch water and you get some wood. Hurry back before dark.\u201dXiao Liu brought the water back along with some wild vegetables. s.h.i.+ Qi wasn\u2019t back yet and Xiao Liu was about to go find him when s.h.i.+ Qi returned with wood on his back and a wild chicken in his hand. Xiao Liu was so happy \u201cYou start the fire, I\u2019ll cook something delicious for you.\u201dXiao Liu cleaned the chicken cleanly then stuffed some mushrooms inside the cavity, salted the outside, splashed it with plum wine, wrapped it around some large leaves, and buried it under the yellow dirt next to the fire. He then made a simple stone top and used it to stew the vegetables with the chicken guts.s.h.i.+ Qi quietly watched Xiao Liu busy at work. Xiao Liu stirred the stew and said with a laugh \u201cI lived in the mountains for many years. What is edible and not edible, I\u2019ve eaten it all. Having me around in the mountains, you\u2019re sure to get something tasty.\u201dWhen the time was up, Xiao Liu dug out the hard dirt lump and cracked it open. A fragrant smell came wafting out. Xiao Liu split the chicken in thirds, one part went into the food bag, he gave s.h.i.+ Qi the bigger remaining portion \u201cYou must finish, you are too skinny.\u201d Xiao Liu ate his portion and watched s.h.i.+ Qi. He was still the same, every gesture was elegant and refined, as if he was seated at the most lofty banquet eating the most incredible food. Xiao Liu sighed 's.h.i.+ Qi, you\u2019ll leave sooner or late.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi glanced at him \u201cI. Won\u2019t.\u201dXiao Liu smiled and finished the mushroom stew and went to the creek to wash up.Xiao Liu woke up in the morning to find s.h.i.+ Qi had started a fire and boiled hot water. Xiao Liu took the remaining chicken and diced it up and tossed it in the water to make soup. He took a biscuit from the bag and split it with s.h.i.+ Qi. Once they were done with the soup and put out the fire, they continued up the mountain.Xiao Liu took s.h.i.+ Qi and collected only the more precious herbs along the way. After three days of walking, they entered the deepest parts of the mountain. Xiao Liu squatted down and stared at a pile of animal droppings. His brow was furrowed as if deciding something. s.h.i.+ Qi carried all their belongings and silently watched him.Xiao Liu stood up and said \u201cYou stay here, I need to go find something alone.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t nod, where Xiao Liu went, he also went. Xiao Liu glared \u201cYou said you would listen to me. If you don\u2019t listen, I don\u2019t want you anymore.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi silently looked at him and the sliver of sunlight through the trees shone on his scar along the hair line and the light sorrow in his eyes.Xiao Liu softened and stepped forward wanting to grab his arm but remembering that he didn\u2019t like to be touched so he grabbed his sleeve 's.h.i.+ Qi is the best and most obedient and most capable, I won\u2019t discard you. Not taking you is because its dangerous. That thing is too clever and if it smells something it\u2019ll be scared off and run thousands of miles in an instant. The only way to get close is to smear its p.o.o.p on the body but there isn\u2019t enough p.o.o.p here so only I can go. If I can\u2019t catch it I\u2019ll come right back so wait for me here.\u201dXiao Liu tilted his head and smiled and finally s.h.i.+ Qi nodded.Xiao Liu picked up the p.o.o.p and stepped away to smear it on his arm \u201cIsn\u2019t it gross? You probably never saw this where you grew up. It\u2019s not really that dirty. A lot of medicine is made with animal p.o.o.p you know.\u201d Xiao Liu turned and s.h.i.+ Qi was right next to him already and he paused. s.h.i.+ Qi fixed his sleeve and said \u201cBe careful.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cI lived alone in the mountain for years. When I was hungry, I even stole the egg from under a Thousand Year Snake Demon. Even the most vicious beasts aren\u2019t dangerous to me. To be honest, there are no beasts or animals scarier than people\u2026\u2026..\u201d Xiao Liu fixed his waistband and waved \u201cI\u2019m off.\u201d\u201cI. Wait for you.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi stood underneath the tree.There is no person who will wait for another for an entire lifetime. Xiao Liu smiled and with a hop and a skip disappeared into the trees.Xiao Liu wanted to catch a Jiu Jiu, a small animal resembling a civet cat. It had a long white tail and can take away people\u2019s sorrow. It was popular with the n.o.bles and could be sold for a pretty penny. It didn\u2019t have any attack power but it was very very clever yet easy to frighten so quick to run away. It was very hard to catch. But Xiao Liu had a way of dealing with it. Jiu Jiu loved listening to a young woman sing. Jiu Jiu would be attracted to the young woman\u2019s sorrowful song and its body would inch closer to help the girl forget her sorrows. Xiao Liu found a suitable spot to set the trap.He jumped into the water to wash off the p.o.o.p first, then crawled on a rock and sat down. The rock was warmed by the sun and Xiao Liu sat there fixing his hair and singing. The song was carried by the wind. Xiao Liu sang a song about missing someone forever and never being able to forget.The voice was melodic and the song sorrowful so the Jiu Jiu was lured out by the song. Initially it was scared so hid in the dark. When it sensed no danger, it could not overcome its natural instinct to help people forget sorrow so it stepped out and started chirping.Xiao Liu fixed his hair and stared at it. It had large round saucer eyes and was super adorable. It would chirp and shake its large white tail, doing little flips or kicking its legs or thumping its chest. It did all sorts of adorable things to make him laugh.Xiao Liu sighed loudly and undid the trap \u201cYou silly thing, you run off now, I won\u2019t catch you to sell for money.\u201dJiu Jiu stared at Xiao Liu quizzically when suddenly a loud whoosh thundered from above and a gold and white condor tried to grab the Jiu Jiu. It had nowhere to hide that it darted into Xiao Liu\u2019s arms.The gold and white condor stood before Xiao Liu and stared at him, as if saying \u201cImma going to eat that! If you don\u2019t want to die then scram!\u201d Xiao Liu felt this condor didn\u2019t yet have enough spiritual learning to take the form of a person, but it definitely understand spoken language.He sighed and bowed respectfully \u201cMaster Condor, it isn\u2019t that I want to be disrespectful, you know its hard to catch a Jiu Jiu and if I didn\u2019t lure it out then you wouldn\u2019t even be able to try and eat it.\u201dThe condor flapped its giant wing and a large rock was smashed to smithereens. His fury was palpable. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t want to retreat since that would incite a beast\u2019s natural attack instinct. This condor could think but it\u2019s natural instinct must still be intact.The Jiu Jiu\u2019s claws dug into Xiao Liu and it tried to make its body as tiny as possible. Xiao Liu held it with one arm and the other tossed out some powder. His eyes held the eyes of the condor and he said in a very sincere and non-threatening way \u201cMaster Condor is handsome and powerful. Your wing power is impressive. One look and its clear you are a king among condors, the ruler of the skies. I am very impressed\u2026\u2026..but I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t let you eat it today.\u201dThe condor wanted to destroy this b.a.s.t.a.r.d before him but it felt dizzy all of a sudden like that one time it stolen the wine but he didn\u2019t steal any wine today\u2026\u2026 After teetering left and right the condor collapsed.Xiao Liu was about to escape when a voice came from above \u201cFurball, I told you many times, people are devious. This time you\u2019ll remember it, yeah?\u201dA white haired man dressed all in white was elegantly sitting on a tree branch smirking in glee at the fallen condor. Xiao Liu silently sighed, the real danger has arrived. He threw the Jiu Jiu towards the tree knowing that with its quickness it could escape. Who know the Jiu Jiu tumbled and stood straight and frozen towards the man. It didn\u2019t even have the courage to run away! If it wasn\u2019t going to run, then Xiao Liu was off!Xiao Liu tossed powder at the man and then turned to run when the man in white blocked his path.Xiao Liu tossed another powder but the man furrowed his brow and said \u201cIf you keep tossing that useless junk and dirty my clothes, I\u2019ll cut your hands off.\u201dXiao Liu stopped immediately, the opponent was so powerful that poison and sleep powder was useless on him. He also couldn\u2019t fight him, so that left only one other choice \u2013 get on his knees and beg.Xiao Liu plopped down on his knees and with a copious amount of tears and snot he begged \u201cMy lord, I\u2019m just a little healer from Qing Shui Town come to the mountains to get some herbs to earn some money. My two brothers need it to marry wives\u2026..\u201d The man felt up the condor and said \u201cAntidote.\u201dXiao Liu crawled over and handed the antidote to him. The man fed it to the condor and finally looked at Xiao Liu \u201cMy condor ride has eaten tens of thousands of poisonous snakes, even the poison made by the court doctors of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom are ineffective to him. It\u2019s interesting to know that even a little healer in Qing Shui Town is this talented.\u201dXiao Liu felt a cold breeze fly up his spine and he cursed silently \u201cIt\u2019s just getting lucky. I\u2019m not lying, I\u2019m a little healer specializing in infertility. The Hui Chun Clinic in Qing Shui Town. If My lord has a wife who can\u2019t get pregnant\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA small soldier came running up and bowed respectfully \u201cMy lord!\u201dThe man kicked Xiao Liu over and barked \u201cTie him up!\u201d \u201cYes, sir!\u201d Xiao Liu was tied up and he breathed a sigh of relief. This was the Sheng Nong resistance army. Even though the Yellow Emperor called them a bunch of villainous traitors, in the last few hundred years they never bothered people and always kept a regimented force.Xiao Liu knew everything he said was true so once they confirmed it he would be let go. But he knew this man was very dangerous\u2026\u2026\u2026.he peeked at the white robed man who was intently checking on the condor.The antidote is real and the condor would be up soon. But that silly Jiu Jiu was still frozen on the ground. Xiao Liu laughed and said \u201cWill my lord please let that Jiu Jiu go.\u201d The man appeared not to hear and continued to stroke the condor\u2019s back. The condor stood up and shook its feathers before flying over and ripping the Jiu Jiu apart.The scream was gone before it landed. Xiao Liu lowered his eyes and saw a blood stained white fur land on his shoe. The man waited until the condor was done eating before everyone headed back to camp.Xiao Liu kept his eyes tightly shut refusing to see the route. Based on the sound of voices, this wasn\u2019t a large camp and was likely temporary. Xiao Liu was tossed on the ground and the man\u2019s cold voice entered his ears \u201cA very good set of ears is often more useful than a set of eyes.\u201dXiao Liu opened his eyes and from his vantage point could only see the man\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Qing Shui Town for over twenty years, a quick check will confirm it.\u201dThe man ignored him as he changed his robe and sat down at his desk to review doc.u.ments. It was then that Xiao Liu finally saw his face clearly. White hair like the clouds that wasn\u2019t tied into a bun but instead a jade-colored rope was used to tie it neatly back to let it fall behind his head. His face was so beautifully handsome it bordered on surreal. His entire body was so spotlessly clean it was eerie.At this time he was holding a doc.u.ment in one hand as his eyes were lifted in scorn. He sensed Xiao Liu looking at him and smiled towards Xiao Liu who s.h.i.+vered and immediately shut his eyes. That look he\u2019s only seen once when he was small, it was the way a world renowned giant demon looked at her, it was the look that only someone who had stepped on countless corpses could give off.Xiao Liu guessed who he was, that legendary handsome beyond compare murdering evil devil the Nine-headed Demon \u2013 the one with nine-lives Xiang Liu.Xiao Liu\u2019s arms and legs were tied and he couldn\u2019t move so after some time he was so sore. At night the soldiers brought food and Xiang Liu casually ate. Xiao Liu was thirsty and hungry and seeing that Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t going to feed him then he tried to think of something else.He thought that s.h.i.+ Qi must\u2019ve come to look for him but there was no way he could find this place. He probably went back to town. Xiang Liu finished the meal and lazily laid down on the pallet to leisurely read a book.A soldier came to deliver a doc.u.ment and quickly left. Xiang Liu read it and then stared at Xiao Liu while thinking. Xiao Liu guessed it was a report about him and tried to smile very sincerely \u201cMy lord, everything this servant said is true. I have family waiting for me to go home.\u201dXiang Liu coldly said \u201cI only trust my own instinct. Who are you?\u201d Xiao Liu rolled his eyes \u201cI am Wen Xiao Liu, a healer at the Hui Chun Clinic.\u201dXiang Liu stared at him and tapped his fingers. Xiao Liu started shaking, the primitive instinct of a living being to fear death. Xiao Liu knew that Xiang Liu had no patience to figure out why he seemed suspicious and would used the most efficient and effective way to solve the problem which was to the same fate as the Jiu Jiu.When the aura of death came hurtling over Xiao Liu tumbled and tried to avoid it while saying \u201cMy lord, I really am Wen Xiao Liu. Maybe I\u2019m not ONLY Wen Xiao Liu, but I have no intention to harm the resistance army under General Gong Gong. I don\u2019t belong to the Kingdom of Xuan Yuan, or the Kingdom of Gao Xing, and not to the Kingdom of Sheng Nong. I am just\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dXiao Liu paused and thought \u201cWho am I?\u201dHe raised his head and allowed his entire expression to be seen by Xiang Liu \u201cI am just someone who has been discarded. I have no ability to protect myself, I have no one to rely on, I have nowhere to go, so that is why I chose to be Wen Xiao Liu in Qing Shui Town. If my lord will allow, I wish that I could be Wen Xiao Liu for the rest of my life.\u201dXiang Liu stared at him and Xiao Liu didn\u2019t dare to move but the beads of cold sweat came down and there where unshed tears in his eyes because the hard protective sh.e.l.l placed in the last tens of years got forcibly peeled open.After some time, Xiang Liu calmly said \u201cIf you want to live, work for me!\u201dXiao Liu said nothing. Xiang Liu blew out the lamps \u201cYou have a night to think on it.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s eyes were open and he stared straight ahead.Dawn arrived and Xiang Liu dressed and asked \u201cHave you decided?\u201d Xiao Liu lazily said \u201cStill thinking. I\u2019m so thirsty, I want some water first.\u201d Xiang Liu laughed coldly and said \u201cTake him outside.\u201dTwo soldiers dragged Xiao Liu out and Xiang Liu calmly said \u201cWhip him, twenty lashes.\u201dThe army\u2019s whipping can make the most devious demon soldier capitulate that was how painful it was. And the man Nine-lives Xiang Liu sent to whip him had a shockingly strong arm. Once with just one hundred and twenty lashes he killed a demon soldier who was over a thousand years old. The whip was as thick as an oxtail and it came down in snaps as Xiao Liu yelled \u201cI\u2019m done thinking, done thinking\u2026..\u201dAfter the twenty lashes was done, Xiang Liu looked at Xiao Liu and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your decision?\u201d Xiao Liu gasped \u201cI just have three conditions.\u201d\u201cWhip him, twenty lashes.\u201dThe whip came down and Xiao Liu yelped \u201cTwo conditions, one condition\u2026\u2026\u201dAnother twenty lashes was delivered and Xiao Liu\u2019s entire back was covered in blood and he was in excruciating pain. Xiang Liu coldly looked at him and asked \u201cAnymore conditions?\u201dXiao Liu was covered in sweat and his mouth was bleeding so he couldn\u2019t say a full sentence \u201cYou\u2026\u2026.can kill me, but I\u2026\u2026..still\u2026\u2026.have one condition.\u201d Xiang Liu smiled with a corner of his mouth and said \u201cSay it!\u201d\u201cI\u2026.I won\u2019t leave Qing Shui Town.\u201d Xiao Liu understood that Xiang Liu was interested in his ability to make poison and as long as he didn\u2019t leave Qing Shui Town then Xiang Liu couldn\u2019t send him to kill the Xuan Yuan generals and officers. Nor could he send him to kill Gao Xing n.o.bles and royals. Xiang Liu seemed to understand Xiao Liu\u2019s thinking and just stared at him without any expression.Xiao Liu had been acting a coward this entire time but this time he didn\u2019t back down and looked at Xiang Liu straight back. The meaning was clear, if he didn\u2019t agree then kill him now. After a moment, Xiang Liu said \u201cFine!\u201dXiao Liu breathed a sigh of relief and then collapsed.Xiao Liu was dragged by the soldiers into the room and the army doctor removed his clothes and put medicine on his back. Xiang Liu stood at the door of the tent and coldly observed. Xiao Liu laid on a wooden board and docilely allowed the army doctor to minister to him. When the medicine was applied and everyone left, Xiang Liu said to Xiao Liu \u201cMake whatever concoction I ask of you. All other times you can continue being your healer in Qing Shui Town. But when I summon you then you must obey immediately.\u201d\u201cFine, but it\u2019s like not I will be able to make whatever my lord asks.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t, then you can exchange with your body.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xiao Liu never imagined Xiang Liu would like guys and carefully said \u201cMy lord is handsome beyond compare. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to service you but\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiang Liu smirked and lifted his foot and stepped on Xiao Liu\u2019s wound slowly until blood started to seep out \u201cOne time you can\u2019t make it, then use a part of your body in exchange. The first time, your ears. The second time, your nose. Without your nose, it is\u2026\u2026\u201dXiang Liu upped the pressure \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t cut off your hands, you need it to make the concoctions.\u201d Xiao Liu was in so much pain he writhed \u201cI\u2026.I understand.\u201dXiang Liu pulled his foot back and wiped the blood away on Xiao Liu\u2019s robe \u201cYou are as slippery as an eel, one moment of not paying attention and all that is left is mud. But my personality, you should go ask around.\u201dXiao Liu snarked \u201cI don\u2019t need to ask around to figure it out.\u201dA soldier\u2019s voice called out \u201cSir, someone has stormed the barracks.\u201dXiang Liu took off and the noise stopped. Xiao Liu heard a soldier ask \u201cWho are you and why have you stormed the Sheng Nong army base?\u201d A scratchy voice replied \u201cYe s.h.i.+ Qi. Xiao Liu.\u201dIt\u2019s s.h.i.+ Qi! He came? Xiao Liu crawled outside and yelled \u201cMy lord Xiang Liu, please don\u2019t harm him. He\u2019s my servant and came to find me.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi ran towards Xiao Liu and his spiritual energy was stronger than expected because he deflected all the soldiers trying to stop him. But these were trained soldiers and if he took down two then four more would step up so Xiao Liu yelled 's.h.i.+ Qi, stop! My orders.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stopped and the soldiers encircled him and glared but s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t even look at him and only stared at Xiang Liu \u201cI. Am taking Xiao Liu.\u201dXiao Liu tried to look alluring and yelled \u201cMy lord! I am already your person!\u201d Those words\u2026\u2026.caused all the soldiers at the base to grimace.Xiang Liu furrowed his brow but lowered his hand and the soldiers parted. s.h.i.+ Qi flew to Xiao Liu\u2019s side and half carried half propped him up. His hand gently pa.s.sed over his back. Perhaps it was mental comfort but Xiao Liu actually felt some pain lessen. s.h.i.+ Qi knelt down \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201dXiao Liu crawled on his back and smiled cheekily at Xiang Liu \u201cMy lord, I\u2019m going home now.\u201dXiang Liu kept staring at s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu got nervous and actually grabbed s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face like a child would and yelled \u201cDon\u2019t you get any ideas about him. He\u2019s mine.\u201dXiang Liu was startled and was about to smile but stopped himself. He coughed a few times \u201cAfter investigating and confirming you are a citizen of Qing Shui Town and not a threat to the Sheng Nong army, you are free to leave.\u201dXiao Liu continued the charade and said \u201cThank you my lord, after I return I will be sure to spread word of my lord\u2019s vast kindness.\u201dThe soldiers left and s.h.i.+ Qi carried Xiao Liu on his back and rushed off. It was only after there was no sound behind them that Xiao Liu wearily said 's.h.i.+ Qi, I\u2019m thirsty.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi gently put him down and took out a flask for him. Xiao Liu drank a few gulps and let out a long sigh \u201cLet\u2019s hurry before that Xiang Liu changes his mind.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi knelt down and Xiao Liu remembered that he didn\u2019t like to be touched but right now there was no other way so Xiao Liu carefully climbed on his back \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know you don\u2019t want to carry someone. You can imagine that I\u2019m a rock and rocks don\u2019t make any noise\u2026\u2026..Or you can imagined that I am a pig, a pig who speaks. Oh, but do you dislike pigs? Then you can imagine I\u2019m a\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s voice was low \u201cI will think that it\u2019s you. I am willing to carry\u2026\u2026you.\u201dXiao Liu paused and murmured \u201cFine, then you think that I\u2019m me.\u201d After saying that he realized what he said and laughed a few times and stopped. 's.h.i.+ Qi, my back hurts, can you talk with me?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d's.h.i.+ Qi, how did you find me?\u201d \u201cTrail. Can follow.\u201d \u201cOh, you are good at tracking then. Did you learn it a long time ago?\u201d Xiao Liu then realized he probably didn\u2019t like to think of the past \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d's.h.i.+ Qi, that Xiang Liu is very devious, if you see him in the future be careful. Don\u2019t let him discover that you have any use for him. Then he\u2019ll get ideas about you.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201dNnnnnggggg, this time is such a failure! Didn\u2019t earn the money and lost himself. How did I get spotted by that big demon Xiang Liu? How will the days ahead be like?s.h.i.+ Qi slowed down and turned to look at Xiao Liu and his lips touched Xiao Liu\u2019s forehead. His hot breath brushed over Xiao Liu\u2019s face and s.h.i.+ Qi stiffly turned \u201cDon\u2019t be\u2026\u2026scared.\u201dPerhaps it was because he was just tormented by Xiang Liu. Or because his hard sh.e.l.l that was forcibly opened wasn\u2019t fully shut yet. Xiao Liu really craved this feeling of reliance and he closed his eyes and rested his head on s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s shoulder and his head was pressed to s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s neck. He was like a cat curled up against him \u201cI\u2019m not scared of him. I don\u2019t believe there is a poison in this world that won\u2019t fell him. When I create that poison one day, I will\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Liu used his hand to make a fist crus.h.i.+ng something 's.h.i.+ Qi, when we get back, don\u2019t say anything. Don\u2019t let Lao Mu and them know. Lao Mu spent his life fighting against Sheng Nong and he\u2019s pretty scared of that big demon Xiang Liu. But I guess I don\u2019t even need to remind you. Ma Zi and Chuan Zi have been trying to pull information out of you but in the last two years they\u2019ve already told you how many warts they have and still know nothing about you\u2026\u2026..\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s footsteps slowed and Xiao Liu gave his chest a few comforting slaps \u201cI know, you\u2019re s.h.i.+ Qi. I wish you stayed s.h.i.+ Qi for the rest of your life. But I know that isn\u2019t possible. But for each day you don\u2019t leave, then you are s.h.i.+ Qi for an additional day, and you have to listen to me\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u201cMmmm hmmmm.\u201d\u201cYou have to listen to me!\u201d\u201cMmmm hmmmm.\u201dXiao Liu was as happy as a mouse stealing oil and he felt her back pain lessen. Sprawled on s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s back, he gradually fell asleep.s.h.i.+ Qi tried to make Xiao Liu the most comfortable gra.s.s bed and turned the cave into their temporary home. The two of them seemed to be living the hunter\u2019s life in the mountain. Everyday, s.h.i.+ Qi went out and hunted small game. When he came back, Xiao Liu directed and s.h.i.+ Qi did and together they cooked dinner. s.h.i.+ Qi clearly never did this before and he was clumsy and constantly made mistakes. Xiao Liu would guffaw happily, but s.h.i.+ Qi was too smart and in a few tries he mastered it and that lessened some of the mirth in Xiao Liu.The days and nights in the mountains were very desolate and those who couldn\u2019t move was even lonelier. Xiao Liu grabbed s.h.i.+ Qi to talk with him \u2013 everything under the sky they talked about. A delicious dish, a spectacular sunset\u2026\u2026.s.h.i.+ Qi quietly listened to it all.Xiao Liu sometimes felt a twinge of guilt \u201cAm I talking too much? I lived alone for twenty some years and during that time I developed a strange quirk. I was afraid to see people and wandered alone. In the beginning I never spoke, but as the days pa.s.sed one day in the mountains I forgot the name of a fruit. I suddenly became very afraid though I didn\u2019t know what I was afraid of. From then on, I talked to myself, and the most amazing thing I did was I captured a monkey and talked to it for an entire day. That monkey couldn\u2019t take it anymore and actually tried to commit suicide by ramming its head into the cave wall\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Liu laughed out loud but s.h.i.+ Qi just looked at him quietly.Every day Xiao Liu needed to change his bandages and he brazenly took off his clothes and showed his backside to s.h.i.+ Qi. Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t see s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s expression and teased \u201cI\u2019ve seen your entire body from top to bottom but all you can see if my back. That doesn\u2019t seem fair?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi said nothing and Xiao Liu giggled.Xiao Liu\u2019s injuries were very severe and s.h.i.+ Qi initially thought they needed to spend a month or two in the mountains but by the 10th day Xiao Liu was up on crutches. Two day later Xiao Liu decided to go home.When Xiao Liu was collecting the herbs, he found two very rare plants and asked if s.h.i.+ Qi collected it? s.h.i.+ Qi nodded \u201cSaw it while hunting. You mentioned before.\u201d During this time, s.h.i.+ Qi spent with Xiao Liu and his speech was getting better. Xiao Liu was ecstatic and wanting to hug and kiss s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cThat\u2019s great! Ma Zhi and Chuan Zi can get a wives now.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi knelt down to piggyback Xiao Liu but he stepped back \u201cNo need, I\u2019ll walk.\u201d Before he had no choice but now that he could walk how could he take advantage of s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s politeness. s.h.i.+ Qi silently stood up and followed behind Xiao Liu.The two returned to Qing Shui Town and Lao Mu wielded a sword and demanded \u201cWhy did you leave for so long? Didn\u2019t I tell you where not to go?\u201dXiao Liu happily showed him the rare plants \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t go! s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t know the mountain topography and we got lost for a few days but we got home safely now, right?\u201dLao Mu saw the rare plants and was so happy, taking it to put away carefully. Xiao Liu winked at s.h.i.+ Qi and then whistled a tune and walked back to his room.A month later, under Lao Mu\u2019s arrangement, Ma Zhi and the daughter of Butcher Gao got engaged. Everything returned to normal and every day was just like before \u2013 it was so calm it was boring, it was so boring it was peaceful, it was so peaceful it was happy.Other than, occasionally a mall white condor would come find Xiao Liu, bringing something and taking away something. Xiao Liu made the poison for Xiang Liu but always held something back. If the poison was beyond deadly that it fit his requirement, but then it would have an odd color or smell. Whatever the reason, it was impossible to use it to kill those powerful people under tight protection.Xiao Liu thought that as time pa.s.sed Xiang Liu would come raise a fuss but Xiang Liu appeared to not care about \u201ccolor, smell, and taste\u201d and as long as the poison met his specifications he accepted it all.Xiao Liu used his haphazard medical and poison skills to deduce that Xiang Liu was a very unique being and his power came from using poison to train. All the poison that Xiao Liu produced was likely consumed by him.After he figured it out, Xiao Liu breathed a sigh of relief, and then proceeded to make the most horrible tasting poison ever.After a year, Lao Mu held a simple wedding ceremony for Ma Zhi and Chun Tao, the daughter of Butcher Gao. Ma Zi was the product of the war, an orphan who was a beggar that believed his fate was one day being a corpse by the side of the road being gnawed on by wild dogs. As the dogs ate him they would howled with happiness, that was the fate of most of the orphans in this period of strife.But Xiao Liu and Lao Mu changed his fate. Neither Xiao Liu nor Lao Mu were humans. When Ma Zhi was seven years old he was rescued by Xiao Liu and after over ten years had pa.s.sed he grew to be an 6 ft tall and strong and now Xiao Liu looked younger than him. But Ma Zi always felt Xiao Liu and Lao Mu were his elders. In front of all the guests he took Chun Tao\u2019s hand and knelt down to solidly bow three times to them. Lao Mu was so touched he wiped away tears and even Xiao Liu was uncharacteristically serious and ordered Ma Zi \u201cSleep more with Chun Tao and have more kids.\u201dMa Zi wanted to say more words from the heart but when he heard Xiao Liu say that he didn\u2019t dare say anymore. If Chun Tao knew that he married her so that he could sleep with her every night and it was cheaper than going to a brothel then this wife would surely leave him. He grabbed Chun Tao\u2019s hand and quickly hurried off.Xiao Liu giggled slyly and s.h.i.+ Qi smiled at him. Lao Mu was busy sending guests off and Xiao Liu sat in the corner of the yard intently gnawing on a drumstick. Chuan Zi suddenly rushed inside and stammered \u201cA\u2026\u2026a guest.\u201d He dragged Xiao Liu outside and there was Xiang Liu, dressed all in white, standing at the front door of the clinic. His tall frame was as spotless as a white lily that has been washed by rain water for three days straight. So clean it made one wanted to run home and immediately take a bath.Lao Mu didn\u2019t feel right to receive his gift and kept wiping his hands on his robe, afraid that even his sweat would dirty his body. Xiao Liu smirked and walked forward, tossing the drumstick on the ground and used his two oily hands to take the gift from Xiang Liu and even dared to rub his palm on his hand a few times. Xiang Liu\u2019s smile never wavered and merely shot a glance at Chuan Zi standing behind Xiao Liu and immediately Xiao Liu wised up. He handed the gift to Chuan Zi and immediately bowed to Xiang Liu and said saucily \u201cPlease come inside for a rest.\u201dXiang Liu sat down and there wasn\u2019t a single person daring to get within three feet of him whether it was due to fear or respect. s.h.i.+ Qi silently came to sit next to Xiao Liu and Xiao Liu shot him a look before turning to Xiang Liu with all smiles \u201cI made all the medicine you asked for. There was no mistakes, right?\u201d Xiang Liu smiled \u201cYou did well which is why I came to bring a gift.\u201dXiao Liu was speechless \u2013 so you came to remind me that you didn\u2019t just have three hostages, you now have four.In the courtyard a bunch of young wedding guests were playing games to tease Ma Zi and Chun Tao and the sound of laughter would periodically ring out. Children munched on sweets and ran in and out while Lao Mu and the Butcher Gao were drinking and chatting.Xiang Liu looked at the boisterous common life and asked with scorn \u201cWhen they are all dead, you will still be the way you are now. Is this amusing for you?\u201dXiao Liu answered \u201cI am scared of loneliness. I can\u2019t find a constant forever then a temporary companion is fine.\u201d Xiang Liu looked at Xiao Liu who happily poured some wine for Xiang Liu \u201cSince you are here, have some wedding wine that I made myself.\u201dXiang Liu took a sip and casually remarked \u201cOther than the poison there is nothing worth mentioning in this wine.\u201d Xiao Liu asked with concern \u201cAre you poisoned?\u201d Xiang Liu stared at Xiao Liu and he shut up. Xiang Liu asked \u201cDo you really want to poison me to death?\u201dXiao Liu answered honestly \u201cI am not a soldier in the Xuan Yuan army, you and I don\u2019t have a blood feud, I just want to whip you 80 to 100 times.\u201d\u201cDream on in this lifetime.\u201d Xiang Liu took another drink of the wine and then left.Xiao Liu said in an angry huff to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cOne day I\u2019ll find his weakness. If I can\u2019t poison him then I\u2019ll walk backwards.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi had laughter in his eyes and Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t stand the way he always seemed to float above everything so poured him a gla.s.s of wine \u201cDrink it!\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi took it and gulped it down.Xiao Liu startled \u201cIt\u2019s poisoned.\u201dThe laughter in s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes never disappeared as his body collapsed softly. Xiao Liu anxiously gave him the antidote and yelled \u201cYou idiot!\u201d while his heart felt this indescribable feeling.After Ma Zi\u2019s wedding, Nine Lives Xiang Liu would occasionally come and sit in the clinic courtyard and drink a few cups of Xiao Liu\u2019s wine and nibble on a few of Xiao Liu\u2019s snacks. When he left his face never even changed expressions and his heartbeat never once skipped a beat. Xiang Liu\u2019s very att.i.tude of not taking Xiao Liu seriously is exactly what p.i.s.sed Xiao Liu off.When Xiao Liu entered the medical profession, it all began with the wrong intentions. He wanted to learn to kill someone and not to learn to save someone. Yet here was Xiang Liu eating his poison like candy! Xiao Liu thought and thought and decided to keep on learning, learning how to kill someone. He vowed to keep walking down the wrong path with the goal of poisoning this big demon sooner or later!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime to welcome our third male lead to Lost You Forever, and I don\u2019t mean he\u2019s third in line to win our leading lady\u2019s heart. While he\u2019s the final guy to show up in the story, narratively he\u2019s got a much much deeper tie to Xiao Liu than either of them knows right off the bat. As usual with stuff in Qing Shui Town when people show up and stuff happens, it\u2019s messy and complicated and nothing is ever what it seems. I really enjoy how this story plops us smack in the middle of daily activity, in many ways just turning on the TV right in the middle of a show. A brief snippet and you\u2019re hooked, but then you have to extrapolate and read between the lines of what is happening without the benefit of the earlier narrative. Thankfully the back story gets revealed little by little, and Xiao Liu gets pulled back into her old world little by little. He\u2019s a G.o.d, supposedly of little power compared to others, but he\u2019s sc.r.a.ped by with his quick thinking and a surprising tenacity. Little things don\u2019t phase him, and he appears to rarely let his guard down. So far we\u2019ve only seen Xiao Liu share a bit with s.h.i.+ Qi, and have a bit dragged out of him by Xiang Liu. I\u2019ve read all of Tong Hua\u2019s novels and I can safely say her three male leads here are extraordinarily rendered. On par with the complicated tortured Meng Jue, the candid and pa.s.sionate Huo Qu Bing, the reticent and devoted Liu Fu Ling, the selfless and reserved Meng Xi Muo, and the ambitious and determined 4th Prince. I love watching Xiao Liu be a man because it allows the characters to interact without the usual veneer of attraction. Tong Hua does well by never describing Xiao Liu, we don\u2019t know what he looks like, but it doesn\u2019t matter because he isn\u2019t who he really is anyways. That makes his interaction with s.h.i.+ Qi fascinating, because they are both honest with each other but living a lie. Conversely, Xiao Liu and Xiang Liu are like this really crazy combustible slow burn that has nothing to do with romance but everything to do with this weird sensation that they just \u201cget\u201d each other.Chapter 3 \u2013 A Guest From Far Away:Butcher Gao had only one child and Ma Zi had no parents, so after the marriage Ma Zi became like a son to Butcher Gao and often went to help out. Gradually he lived more at Butcher Gao\u2019s house and returned to the clinic less.Chuan Zi laughed at Butcher Gao\u2019s smart deal, got money for marrying a daughter and got himself an extra son.\u00a0Xiao Liu and Lao Mu didn\u2019t care \u2013 to Xiao Liu having one s.h.i.+ Qi equaled ten Ma Zi, and for Lao Mu he was just happy to see Ma Zi living a peaceful happy life.So when one day Ma Zi was carried into the clinic by Butcher Gao and Chun Tao, Lao Mu was in disbelief while Xiao Liu furrowed his brows. If it was Chuan Zi that got beaten up that wouldn\u2019t surprise Xiao Liu. Chuan Zi could be an a.s.s and sometimes deserved a beat down. But Ma Zi was not like that, he was tall and strong but very reasonable and was willing to give in to others.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lao Mu asked. Chun Tao wiped her tears and explained \u201cAfter butchering a sheep this morning, I was delivering sheep blood when I accidentally b.u.mped into a lady. I apologized to her and offered to pay for the damage but the lady\u2019s maid yelled that I couldn\u2019t afford it. My dad got nervous and a few words were exchanged and then fists went flying. Ma Zi tried to protect my dad and got beaten.\u201dQing Shui Town had no government or law enforcement and the only law was survival of the fittest.Chuan Zi heard enough and grabbed his medicine bag and took off. Chuan Zi was very scrawny as a kid and Ma Zi took good care of him. The two fought all day long but they were closer than even real blood brothers. Xiao Liu called out \u201cLao Mu\u201d and Lao Mu immediately ran out after him.Ma Zi\u2019s injuries were not that severe and after Xiao Liu patched him up and Chuan Zi and Lao Mu were still not back, he told Chun Tao \u201cYou take care of Ma Zi, I\u2019ll go check.\u201dButcher Gao grabbed his butcher\u2019s knife and wanted to follow but Xiao Liu laughed \u201cYour business can\u2019t be shuttered so go back to work. Lao Mu and I will see to it.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi followed behind Xiao Liu and when they arrived at the inn they saw Lao Mu fighting with a girl in yellow. Chuan Zi was laying on the ground and when he saw Xiao Liu he grumbled \u201cBrother Liu, I didn\u2019t start anything. Before I got close to them I was already beaten down.\u201dXiao Liu shot him a glance and then looked at Lao Mu who was clearly not a match for the girl in yellow. The girl was like toying with a monkey the way she danced around Lao Mu, with a veiled girl standing on the stone steps next to her. The girl was laughing as she watched and would call out an order \u201cHai Tang, I want to see him fall on his b.u.t.t.\u201d and the girl indeed caused Lao Mu to fall on his rear end. The young girl giggled and clapped \u201cHopping, I want to see him hopping like a toad!\u201dLao Mu could not control his body and he was forced to hop like a toad as if someone else was pressing on him. The little girl doubled over laughing and all the people gathered to watch the scene were also guffawing.Xiao Liu squeezed to the front and bowed to the young girl before turning to Hai Tang \u201cHe\u2019s already defeated, will the young lady please stop.\u201dHai Tang looked at the young girl but the young girl continued as if she heard nothing \u201cI want to see him tumbling.\u201d Lao Mu was then tumbling on the ground while the young girl laughed and the crowd also laughed.Xiao Liu solemnly spoke up \u201cThe rule of Qing Shui Town says to know when to stop when there is no blood feud at stake.\u201d The young girl looked at Xiao Liu \u201cMy rule is whomever offended me must die! Xuan gege won\u2019t let me hurt anyone so I won\u2019t hurt anyone, but I\u2019ll make him perform tricks.\u201dLao Mu was a hardscrabble battle worn old man and there were tears in his eyes as he begged Xiao Liu \u201cKill me!\u201d He was a runaway soldier from the Xuan Yuan Army but he was only escaping the nonstop war and not escaping a man\u2019s dignity. Xiao Liu\u2019s murderous intent was roused and he stepped forward.Suddenly Lao Mu stopped tumbling and Chuan Zi hurried over to help him up. The young girl was unhappy \u201cHai Tang, did I allow you to stop?\u201d Hai Tang shot a glance at s.h.i.+ Qi standing in the crowd \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your servant I\u201d She slowly backed up and stood in front of the young girl with her eyes locked on s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201cIf not you, then who? Which pathetic lowlife dared to?\u201d The young girl wanted to push Hai Tang aside and look for herself but Hai Tang held tight to the young girl and said in a low voice \u201cThe person has higher power than I do. Let\u2019s wait until Master Xuan returns.\u201d Hai Tang grabbed the girl and quickly left the inn. Xiao Liu looked at their retreating backs and smiled \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you at the clinic.\u201dLao Mu had some name recognition on the street but the indignity he suffered today caused his face to darken and he entered the house without a word. Xiao Liu knew he couldn\u2019t comfort him so told Chuan Zi to keep an eye on him lest he tried to kill himself in shame.Xiao Liu sat in the front salon while s.h.i.+ Qi stood off in the corner in the shadows. Xiao Liu toyed with a cup of wine and chattered in his usual way \u201cLao Mu, Ma Zi, Chuan Zi, they all think I\u2019m the nicest person. But in truth I\u2019ve killed people since I was very young\u2026\u2026.I haven\u2019t killed anyone in a long time but today I wanted to kill them.\u201d\u201cThey are G.o.ds.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi suddenly spoke out.\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Xiao Liu looked unafraid.s.h.i.+ Qi was silent. Xiao Liu glanced at him \u201cWill you help me?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi nodded. Xiao Liu smiled and suddenly didn\u2019t feel killing anyone anymore. Xiao Liu drank a tumbler of wine and finally the person he was waiting for arrived.The young girl took off her veil and her features were merely fine but with an expressive pair of eyes that raised her looks from a 5 to an 8 on that alone. The man standing next to her was very extraordinary \u2013 his eyes were warm and his demeanor refined like the rivers and mountains in fluidity and strength.The man bowed to Xiao Liu \u201cI am Xuan and this is my cousin Ah Nian. Our servant girl Hai Tang has been poisoned by young master you so I came personally to ask young master to give us the antidote.\u201dXiao Liu played with the tumbler of wine in his hand and said with a smile \u201cSure, if one kneeled and bowed in apology to my elder brother.\u201dAh Nian glared at Xiao Liu \u201cWant my servant girl to bow in apology to your elder brother, are you sick of living?\u201dXiao Liu coldly stared at Hai Tang who appeared in great pain as she clutched the wall and slowly sank to the floor. Ah Nian whined \u201cXuan gege, you see! They came looking for trouble. I didn\u2019t hurt them and was just toying a bit but they responded by trying to kill us. If I wasn\u2019t carrying my E\u2026.father\u2019s poison warding beads then I would have been poisoned.\u201dHai Tang yelped in pain and Xuan stared at Xiao Liu \u201cPlease give me the antidote!\u201dXiao Liu coldly laughed \u201cWhat? You want to take it with force? Be my guest!\u201dXuan reached out to grab the medicine and Xiao Liu backed up. Xiao Liu knew s.h.i.+ Qi was behind her and if he blocked for Xiao Liu then he could see what type of powers Xuan had and poison him accordingly. But s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t step forward and when Xiao Liu looked back the corner of the room was empty and s.h.i.+ Qi was gone.Xiao Liu was struck by Xuan and collapsed. Xuan was surprised that Xiao Liu was so weak since he appeared so brash and quickly held back his power \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you\u2026\u2026\u201d He picked up Xiao Liu to check his injuries and it was a relief that Xuan never intended to hurt him so Xiao Liu appeared just dazed. Xiao Liu rested on Xuan\u2019s shoulder and a small smile appeared on his lips and his eyes filled with derision. Sometimes one could only laugh at the entire world.Xuan paused.Ah Nian picked up the antidote bottle and fed a pill to Hai Tang who swallowed and expressed some aura \u201cThis is the antidote.\u201d Ah Nian mocked Xiao Liu \u201cYou\u2019re this useless and you dared to oppose us?\u201dXiao Liu pushed Xuan away and struggled to get up \u201cScram!\u201dAh Nian wanted to strike but Xuan stopped her \u201cSince the poison has been cured, let\u2019s just go home.\u201d He looked at Xiao Liu one more time before dragging Ah Nian behind him. Ah Nian looked back and silently mouthed the insult \u201cLowlife loser!\u201dXiao Liu walked into the courtyard and sat down on the stone step and s.h.i.+ Qi walked behind him. Xiao Liu smiled at the sunset and loudly sighed. He was wrong, he should never rely on another.s.h.i.+ Qi kneeled beside Xiao Liu and handed him the basket of snacks. Xiao Liu asked \u201cYou know them?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi nodded. \u201cThey are the young lady and lord of a n.o.ble family in the G.o.d tribe?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi paused for a moment before slowly nodding. \u201cYou were afraid they would recognize you so you hid? Or you thought I shouldn\u2019t have messed with them so you hid so they could get the antidote?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi lowered his head and Xiao Liu flipped the basket over and a plate of goose necks and claws fell on the ground. Xiao Liu walked out the door when when s.h.i.+ Qi tried to get up \u201cDon\u2019t follow me!\u201d and Xiao Liu\u2019s order caused him to stop.Xiao Liu walked to the edge of the river and watched it rumble past. He wasn\u2019t angry that s.h.i.+ Qi let Xuan take the antidote. He was angry because when he relied on someone it was to turn around and discover that person wasn\u2019t there. He was angry at himself for having this pathetic hope. Xiao Liu jumped into the river and swam upstream. The river got wider and wider and the current stronger and stronger.The icy cold river rushed past everything, night and day, it never stopped. Xiao Liu allowed the current to batter him and feel the sense of powerlessness. The sound of laughter came from above and Xiao Liu raised his head to see Xiang Liu casually riding on his golden white condor and looking down at Xiao Liu. \u201cNight fis.h.i.+ng?\u201dXiang Liu reached out his hand and Xiao Liu grabbed it and vaulted on the back of the condor. The condor rose into the air into the clouds and Xiao Liu was all wet so was cold and s.h.i.+vering. Xiang Liu handed a tumbler of wine to Xiao Liu and he quickly gulped down a few drinks.The strong alcohol in his belly immediately cut some of the chill.Xiang Liu leaned back and stared at Xiao Liu who felt a bit brave with some alcohol in his belly \u201cWhat are you looking at? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a woman!\u201d\u201cOnly very few G.o.ds can have their own winged ride. An even a G.o.d with not very low powers, when riding on the back of a winged ride will still feel uneasy. But you\u2026..you are comfortable and much too at ease.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cI just find myself more and more curious about your past.\u201dXiao Liu tipped his head back and gulped down the wine.\u201cWho are you upset at?\u201d \u201cNone of your business!\u201d\u201cAre you itching for a whipping?\u201dXiao Liu sullenly said nothing.The condor flew to a lake, and with the moon hanging in the dark sky it illuminated the dark blue waters so it sparkled silver and was so quiet it was like time was locked.Xiao Liu handed the tumbler to Xiang Liu and stood up. He opened his arms and howled to the wind before suddenly falling from the condor like a shooting star diving into the lake. Xiang Liu moved and the condor started to fall as well.Xiao Liu was like a beautiful b.u.t.terfly falling into the silver water and disappearing into the depths. The waters rippled out from where he disappeared and when the biggest ripple disappeared was when Xiao Liu shot out from the water like a swimming dragon. His arms grabbed the neck of the condor and he asked \u201cCan you swim? Want to race?\u201d Xiang Liu scoffed.Xiao Liu added \u201cIf you dare then don\u2019t use your powers.\u201d Xiang Liu raised his head to look at the moon. Xiao Liu continued \u201cScared? You can\u2019t be? Nine Lives Demons Xiang Liu can\u2019t be such a coward!\u201d Xiang Liu finally looked directly at Xiao Liu \u201cSeeing the way you are begging me, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cI begged you?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s head was resting on the condor\u2019s neck \u201cFine, consider it me begging you.\u201dXiang Liu slowly took off his robe and jumped into the water. Xiao Liu swam towards the sh.o.r.e with all his might with Xiang Liu right beside him. The water in the lake was icy cold and Xiao Liu warmed up with each valiant push forward. He could forget everything and return to childhood when it was all so free, so relaxing, so happy. His only goal was to return to sh.o.r.e, so very simple.After an hour Xiao Liu finally reached sh.o.r.e. Xiang Liu was sitting next to a roaring fire and his clothes were already dried. Xiao Liu climbed on land \u201cYou won, but\u2026.\u201d he pulled out a fish from his sleeve \u201cI caught a fish. Let\u2019s cook it, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dXiao Liu started cooking the fish while Xiang Liu said \u201cYou grew up somewhere with a lot of water.\u201d\u201cYou say that for anyone who can swim?\u201d\u201cNot just because you can swim, it\u2019s that swimming brings you unfettered happiness. People seek familiar things that allow them to relax and feel the freedom and joy from childhood.\u201dXiao Liu whistled \u201cThey say you are a Nine-headed demon, and with your nine-heads thinking together it\u2019s definitely working. Even what you say is so deep.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that\u2019s a taboo topic?\u201dXiao Liu wasn\u2019t scared and continued \u201cI\u2019m curious, how are your nine-heads arranged? In a row? One one top of the other? Or three on each side of three in the middle? Which one goes first when you eat?\u2026..\u201d Xiao Liu suddenly couldn\u2019t open his mouth anymore.\u201cNnnnngggg\u2026\u2026.nnnnngggg\u2026\u2026\u201dXiang Liu took the cooked fish and slowly started to eat it and Xiao Liu could only stare. After he finished the fish he stared at Xiao Liu \u201cI actually like eating people the best. Your size is perfect so that each of my heads can take a bite.\u201dHis hand stroked Xiao Liu\u2019s face and he leaned in and grabbed Xiao Liu\u2019s neck. Xiao Liu\u2019s body shook and he shut his eyes. Xiang Liu\u2019s tongue tasted blood and a realization thundered through his mind. He slowly sucked a few times before raising his head \u201cDo you dare say anymore nonsense?\u201dXiao Liu wildly shook his head. Xiang Liu released him and Xiao Liu scrambled as far away as he could. Xiang Liu climbed on the white condor and crooked his finger towards Xiao Liu. He didn\u2019t dare get close and instead backed up a few steps. Xiang Liu stared with a smile \u201cDo you want me to go over there?\u201d Xiao Liu quickly shook his head and docilely came over and climbed on the back of the condor.As they returned to Qing s.h.i.+u Town, Xiang Liu kicked Xiao Liu off the back of the condor without warning and Xiao Liu fell into the river. He was stunned and floated on the surface watching the condor fly off. It was so dark and quiet he didn\u2019t even the energy to curse. Xiao Liu closed his eyes and allowed the river to carry him downstream and once he gauged he was close to the clinic he flipped over and swam to sh.o.r.e. He climbed on land dripping wet and the first thing he saw was s.h.i.+ Qi standing there. Xiao Liu smiled at him \u201cStill awake? Take care of yourself and get some rest.\u201d He walked past s.h.i.+ Qi who followed but Xiao Liu acted like he didn\u2019t know. He walked to his room with s.h.i.+ Qi still following but the moment he entered the room he shut the door behind him without turning around.He quickly took off his wet clothes and dried his body before climbing under the covers naked. The normally cold covers were not cold and instead there was a warm incense ball inside that made it warm and fragrant. Chuan Zi and Lao Mu clearly were not the considerate thoughtful type. Xiao Liu smiled and flipped over before falling asleep, his body so weary he didn\u2019t even have a dream left.The next day, Xiao Liu acted like nothing happened and went back to the usual business. Because Ma Zi was recuperating at Butcher Gao\u2019s place and Lao Mu appeared fine but refused to go to the clinic to see anyone, that left Xiao Liu needing to do a lot more ch.o.r.es. Thank G.o.d s.h.i.+ Qi was of such help in seeing patients, making medicine\u2026\u2026after a long busy day and after dinner was done and Chuan Zi saw Lao Mu enter the kitchen, he turned to Xiao Liu \u201cAre we going to just let this go?\u201dXiao Liu munched on a duck neck \u201cIf we don\u2019t let it go, what do you want to do about it?\u201d Chuan Zi kicked the grinder \u201cI\u2019m p.i.s.sed!\u201dXiao Liu slapped Chuan ZI with the duck neck \u201cI think I\u2019ve spoiled you all these years so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s really like out there! In this life, as long as you are alive then there will be times you have to endure even if you can\u2019t endure anymore. To back down even when you don\u2019t want to. Even those princes and princesses live like this!\u201dChuan Zi remembered when he was small and how much he suffered and couldn\u2019t help but admit Xiao Liu was right. He was just a human and enduring was a must. But he still muttered \u201cYou talk like you know, but you\u2019re not a prince or princess!\u201d\u201cYou son of a turtle! If I don\u2019t beat you a few times a week you forget who\u2019s the boss!\u201d Xiao Liu jumped up and grabbed a broom and started whacking while Chuan Zi grabbed his b.u.t.t and lowered his head and ran into his room and locked the door. Xiao Liu thumped his door with the broom and yelled \u201cDid you understand what I said!\u201dLao Mu stood by the kitchen door and said \u201cXiao Liu, I heard what you said and I took it all in. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He closed the kitchen door and walked back to his room. Xiao Liu immediately calmed down and tossed the broom to the corner of the yard.Chuan Zi opened his window a sliver and cast a worried glance towards Lao Mu\u2019s residence. Xiao Liu rapped him on the head and said in a low voice \u201cThose people are just pa.s.sing through Qing Shui Town. Once they leave, time will erase everything and Lao Mu will return to his old self.\u201d Chuan Zi nodded and closed his window.s.h.i.+ Qi handed the snack basket to Xiao Liu and he grabbed a few duck feet. s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes lit up. Xiao Liu politely smiled \u201cThank you\u201d and s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes dimmed. Xiao Liu munched on a duck foot and walked into his room kicking the door shut. s.h.i.+ Qi held the basket and stood there with his lead lowered.It was six months later and Ah Nian and Xuan did not leave Qing Shui Town like Xiao Liu predicted. Chuan Zi angrily tended to the herbs and complained \u201cBrother Liu, that b.i.t.c.h and that pasty-faced dandy opened a wine shop on the street. I\u2019m going to call a few beggars to go ruin their business.\u201dXiao Liu kicked him \u201cIf you have the ability to ruin someone\u2019s business then you\u2019re not Chuan Zi.\u201d Chuan Zi smashed his hoe into the soil and Xiao Liu ordered \u201cBe careful, if you destroy my medicinal herbs I will smash that hoe on you!\u201dChuan Zi muttered \u201cLao Mu hasn\u2019t stepped foot outside once since then. If they remain in town, what\u2019s Lao Mu going to do?\u201dXiao Liu sprawled on a bucket and munched on a blade of gra.s.s and pondered. It wasn\u2019t just Lao Mu who didn\u2019t leave the house, s.h.i.+ Qi also rarely left the house and when he did he would wear a face covering woven hat.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t figure it out. s.h.i.+ Qi had no choice because he couldn\u2019t go back to his real home, but that pretty boy and that wench Ah Nian appeared to be living the swell life so why would they plop down in Qing Shui Town and not leave? Was it because of family opposition that they couldn\u2019t be together so they eloped? Was he a poor pretty boy who seduced a high born lady, so the lady brought her maid and took off and now they were a pair of star-crossed lovers running\u2026\u2026\u2026Chuan Zi knelt down in front of Xiao Liu \u201cBrother Liu, what are you thinking of?\u201dXiao Liu explained \u201cThink of it this way, it\u2019s hard to make money in Qing s.h.i.+u Town, they won\u2019t last long and their shop will be shuttered eventually.\u201d Chuan Zi thought about it and agreed. Those existing wine shops will try to squeeze out the new guy, and that pretty boy didn\u2019t seem like a businessman in the least. Chuan Zi got happy again. Too bad three months later both Chuan Zi and Xiao Liu were disappointed.That pretty boy\u2019s wine shop not only was running smoothly in Qing Shui Town, it\u2019s business was actually quite good. Chuan Zi was enraged \u201cThose prost.i.tutes love a handsome face and they keep that pretty boy\u2019s business running. I see them all dressed up sauntering there to buy wine. That pretty boy is also so shameless, flirting with those wh.o.r.es\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Liu glanced at Lao Mu who still refused to step foot outside and decided to go to the wine shop for a stroll. Xiao Liu stepped out and s.h.i.+ Qi followed so Xiao Liu said \u201cI\u2019m going to the pretty boy\u2019s wine shop. Just to see, not to fight.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi halted and Xiao Liu smiled and kept on walking. Moments later s.h.i.+ Qi was back following this time wearing a hat. Xiao Liu glanced back at him and said nothing.Xiao Liu walked into the restaurant across from the wine shop and ordered two dishes. He sat down and boldly observed while s.h.i.+ Qi sat behind him as quietly as if he didn\u2019t exist. There was no Ah Nian or Hai Tang in sight, with their personages it was likely they didn\u2019t show their face to the customers and remained in the back.The pretty boy was busy running the shop, dressed in common fiber thread robes as he took the money and handed out the wine and greeted the customers. He didn\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb and actually fit in with the street.The pretty prost.i.tutes came to buy wine and he smiled with warmth and clarity in his eyes, tending to their purchase like he would if she was any houswife. The prost.i.tutes were also very reserved with a small smile, very respectful of him as they were of themselves. Xiao Liu viciously chomped on a biscuit \u2013 the prost.i.tutes were happy to give him business not because he was very handsome, but because he paid no heed to his own looks or the prost.i.tutes.After his business slowed down, the pretty boy brought a jug of wine and walked over \u201cI\u2019m still relatively new here and using a family pa.s.sed down recipe of making wine to earn a living. In the future, will Brother Liu please look over the store fondly.\u201dXiao Liu lived in Qing Shui Town for over 20 years and was also a doctor so everyone doing business on this street called him Brother Liu. At least the pretty boy knew his manners.Xiao Liu laughed \u201cSure. And if you can\u2019t get her pregnant with a son also come see me and I\u2019ll make sure she gives you one.\u201d The pretty boy laughed back and opened the jug of wine and respectfully poured Xiao Liu a bowl. He drank first in toast \u201cWhat happened before that was in disrespect, will Brother Liu please be the bigger man and forgive.\u201dIf one was pa.s.sing through, then one could just be a bully and beat folks up and just leave. But to stay for a long period of time, even the strong needs to lower their pride and respect the rules of the place. Otherwise Xiao Liu could put poison in his wines every third day, and add stuff when he bought meat from the butcher, and spit in the snack cakes\u2026..Xiao Liu saw that the pretty boy understood so he quit beating around the bush \u201cIf I\u2019m the bigger man, your wife isn\u2019t going to do the same.\u201d The pretty boy answered \u201cAh Nian is my cousin, will Brother Liu please don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled and didn\u2019t drink the wine in front of him. The pretty boy took another bowl and gulped it down. Xiao Liu ignored him and kept on munching his food.The pretty boy drank 6 bowls in a row and watched Xiao Liu keep eating. He wanted to pour himself another bowl when the jug was empty. He went back and brought back another jug and that is when Xiao Liu looked directly at him \u201cHave your cousin apologize to Lao Mu.\u201d The pretty boy said \u201cMy cousin\u2019s temper is unbending. I\u2019ll bring wine and apologize to Lao Mu.\u201d\u201cYou sure are willing to bend over yourself to protect others. You\u2019d rather bow your head low than have your cousin swallow her pride.\u201d\u201cI am her elder. Whatever she does, I need to take responsibility for.\u201dXiao Liu lowered her head and thought for a moment before suddenly laughing. He stood up and picked up the bowl of wine and gulped it down. He sincerely complimented \u201cGreat wine!\u201d The pretty boy laughed \u201cPlease Brother Liu come more often in the future.\u201dXiao Liu added \u201cYou don\u2019t need to bring wine over to apologize. Just send two jugs of your best wine to Lao Mu.\u201d \u201cFine, whatever Brother Liu says.\u201d The pretty boy bowed and went back to running the shop.At dusk the pretty boy came with Hai Tang and he even hired two men to transport twenty four jugs of his wine from his shop slowly down the street to the clinic. He did it so all the neighbors could see and that was enough to give face to Lao Mu. Hai Tang bowed her head in apology to Lao Mu, it was clear she wasn\u2019t happy to do so but it was done all respectfully and properly as befits someone from a well-born household.Lao Mu sat there with his face dark and self-mocked \u201cI\u2019m not as able as the young miss so I can\u2019t accept your apology.\u201dThe pretty boy told Hai Tang to go home first and himself stayed. He cut to the chase and opened a jug of wine and poured two bowls for himself and Lao Mu. Lao Mu was down-to-earth and since it wasn\u2019t the pretty boy who offended him, he accepted the wine and started drinking with the pretty boy.The bowls of wine went down like water and Lao Mu started talking more and more. He even started army chants with the pretty boy! Lao Mu wasn\u2019t an educated gentleman nor did he know how to read. Army drink chants he learned in the army and it was beyond cra.s.s but surprisingly the pretty boy knew it as well.\u201cYou drink to a juicy white thigh, I drink to rosy red lips, you drink to a plump white breast\u2026\u2026\u201d the two of them went more and more bawdy and rollicking while Chuan Zi and Xiao Liu stood there gaping while s.h.i.+ Qi silently sat with his head down.Lao Mu guffawed at s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cSo shy and modest! A few words and your ears are red?\u201d Xiao Liu noticed that s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t hide from the pretty boy which meant the person he knew was Ah Nian. Chuan Zi nudged Xiao Liu \u201cLao Mu is laughing.\u201d Xiao Liu glanced at the pretty boy \u2013 the guy was definitely someone to reckon with. From women to men, elegant to cra.s.s, he could handle them all. No wonder he would seduce a high born lady to run away with him.After finis.h.i.+ng two jugs of wine, Lao Mu and the pretty boy were nearly BFFs and the only thing missing was becoming sworn brothers. After sending the pretty boy off, he reminded him to come back for his roasted lamb and more drinking. Lao Mu and Chaun Zi were both drunk so Xiao Liu hurried to clean up the dishes. s.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cI\u2019ll do it, you rest.\u201d Xiao Liu laughed \u201cCan\u2019t have you doing it all.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi washed dishes while Xiao Liu wiped down the stove, not a word spoken. s.h.i.+ Qi glanced at Xiao Liu a few times but Xiao Liu smiled as he did his ch.o.r.es and even when he met s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s glance he didn\u2019t look away and would instead make a goofy face with a smile. After s.h.i.+ Qi finished with the dishes and reached out for Xiao Liu\u2019s rag, Xiao Liu held on \u201cI\u2019m almost done, you go rest.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi quietly stood there. After some time he spoke \u201cXiao Liu, you are still angry.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xiao Liu pretended not to get it \u201cNo, Lao Mu is now all buddies with him and is willing to accept Ah Nian like a little sister and let her win this time, what reason would I have to still be angry?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi knew he was avoiding the topic and stared at him \u201cYou are not talking to me.\u201d\u201cHow so? I talk to you every day. Am I not talking to you right now?\u201d\u201cI\u2026.want\u2026..you to be like before. I want to hear you talk.\u201d\u201cBefore?\u201d Xiao Liu acted stupid \u201cHow was I different now than before? Don\u2019t I treat you the same as I do Ma Zi and the others?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi lowered his head and didn\u2019t have the glib tongue to counter. He could only use his silence to endure it all, his voice lingering of loneliness. Xiao Liu hung up the rag and wiped his hand on his s.h.i.+rt \u201cOkay, all done. Time to rest.\u201dXiao Liu hurried back to his room, the hard sh.e.l.l around his heart already sealed shut again. It was his moment of softened pity that caused him to be confused for a while but now he was back to thinking clear again. Every person arrived alone on this Earth and would depart alone. There was no one to rely on. How much hope and reliance one had today, was how much pain and suffering one would endure down the road. Rather than that happening, it was better to not have it to begin with.Since s.h.i.+ Qi temporarily couldn\u2019t go back, then he\u2019ll let him stay for now. A temporary companion, and this brief period in what was a long life would one day be forgotten.Things went back to normal and Lao Mu regained his worried old man\u2019s vigor. He shopped, he cooked, he went about matchmaking for Chuan Zi. Xiao Liu was the type who never worried while s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s words were as rare as gold, leaving Lao Mu with all sorts of things he wanted to discuss and no one to talk to. He ended up getting even chummier with that pretty boy Xuan.He often stopped by the wine shop after grocery shopping and would drink some wine and complain to the pretty boy. The daughter of the Dong family didn\u2019t like Chuan Zi, and Chuan Zi didn\u2019t like the daughter of the Xi family\u2026\u2026\u2026.. The few drunkards in the wine shop offered up ideas for Lao Mu.Chuan Zi\u2019s future spouse was nowhere to be found yet but Ma Zi\u2019s wife Chun Tao bore him a chubby baby girl which lead to Lao Mu crying tears of joy and vowed to continued working on Chuan Zi\u2019s marriage. The ordinary and bustling days pa.s.sed like flowing water and the pretty boy\u2019s wine shop finally became part of the Qing Shui Town family and the people on Xi He Road finally accepted Xuan in earnest.Xiao Liu initially pondered why Xuan stayed in Qing Shui Town but as the days pa.s.sed even he forgot to think about it and poured all his attention into researching medicine.Xiang Liu kept wanting weird deadly poisons so Xiao Liu had to get up his energy to deal with him. Xiao Liu stood by his window and made a wish to the moon \u2013 wis.h.i.+ng Xiang Liu would choke to death on his food, choke to death drinking water, fall while walking and die.After making the wish he closed the window and was about to carry his happy hopeful wish to bed when he turned around and saw Xiang Liu dressed all in white laying on his pallet with his cold eyes staring at him. Xiao Liu immediately blurted out \u201cI wasn\u2019t cursing you!\u201d\u201cYou were cursing me just now?\u201d Xiang Liu smiled and crooked his finger. Xiao Liu step by step walked up to him \u201cDon\u2019t hit the face.\u201d Xiang Liu didn\u2019t use his hands and instead used his mouth, he bit down hard on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck and sucked his blood. Xiao Liu closed his eyes and this wasn\u2019t like last time meant as a warning. Xiang Liu really was drinking his blood.After some time he released Xiao Liu but his lips remained on his bite mark \u201cScared?\u201d\u201cScared!\u201d\u201cLiar!\u201dXiao Liu candidly said \u201cThat night I knew you discovered the secret with my body. I thought you would think of ways to eat me, but tonight you came and all you want is my blood. I\u2019m not scared anymore.\u201dXiang Liu said with a half-smile \u201cMaybe I currently want your blood, but one Winter I may want to stew you to nourish myself fully.\u201dXiao Liu laughed and opened his hands \u201cI belonged to my lord you already. My lord can do whatever you want with me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying again!\u201dXiao Liu looked at Xiang Liu \u2013 tonight he seemed different. His white hair was still not a strand out of place, his white robe was still spotless but appeared not as perfect as before \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201dXiang Liu stroked Xiao Liu\u2019s neck as if picking a spot to bite next \u201cWhat exactly did you eat to grow up? If demons were to discover that your blood was more powerful in healing than even the most magical of medicinal pills, you\u2019ll get eaten until nothing is left.\u201dXiao Liu laughed but didn\u2019t respond to Xiang Liu\u2019s words and instead asked \u201cWhat brings my lord here so late tonight?\u201dXiang Liu took off his outer robe and laid down comfortably \u201cBorrowing your pallet to sleep.\u201d\u201cThen where will I sleep?\u201dXiang Liu glanced at him and Xiao Liu immediately squatted. He understood, he could sleep sprawled anywhere.Xiao Liu glared angrily \u2013 that\u2019s my blanket, s.h.i.+ Qi took it out and aired it under the warm sun all day and beat it until it was nice and fluffy. Xiao Liu wrapped himself up in a blanket and curled into a ball in the corner of the pallet and resentfully fell asleep.In the middle of the night, Xiao Liu climbed on top of Xiang Liu\u2019s body and he opened his eyes. Xiao Liu grabbed his neck and laughed wildly \u201cYou\u2019re using your power to heal yourself, right? Don\u2019t interrupt and stop now otherwise you\u2019ll exacerbate your injury and may even lose all your powers and lose all thought.\u201d Xiang Liu closed his eyes.Xiao Liu slapped his left cheek \u201cHow about I whip you 40 times?\u201d Xiao Liu slapped his right cheek \u201cYou stupid demon, you\u2019re not afraid of pain. If I cut off your left arm you\u2019ll probably roast it with your right arm and eat it.\u201d\u201cHee hee\u2026..\u201d Xiao Liu jumped off the pallet and ran to the kitchen to grab some coal from the stove. He slithered back to the room and jumped on the pallet and hooted \u201cEven you have a day like this! Don\u2019t be angry and focus on healing your injury, don\u2019t let me distract you!\u201d Xiao Liu grabbed the coal and started carefully drawing over Xiang Liu\u2019s face.After Xiao Liu was done and approved of the results, he grabbed his precious mirror and put it in front of Xiang Liu\u2019s face \u201cTake a look but don\u2019t get mad and ruin your healing energy flow.\u201d Xiang Liu opened his eyes which were sharper than knives but Xiao Liu was on a roll \u201cLook!\u201dInside the mirror, under Xiang Liu\u2019s left eye was three more eyes, under his right eye was three more eyes, and there was one more eye on his forehead. Xiao Liu counted \u201cOne, two three\u2026\u2026\u2026.a total of nine.\u201dXiao Liu used his blackened fingers to rub those eyes until it became heads and he turned nine eyes into nine heads. Xiang Liu stared at him and Xiao Liu furrowed his brows \u201cI really can\u2019t imagine what nine heads looks like. One of these days you have to show me your true form!\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s lips moved and he wordlessly mouthed \u201cI am going to devour you.\u201dXiao Liu used his dirty fingers to rub on his lips \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind it being so dirty then go ahead and eat!\u201dXiao Liu flipped off the pallet and c.o.c.ked his head to stare at Xiang Liu \u201cI\u2019m leaving, no need to come look for me. I\u2019m going to disappear for a few days until your temper dies down. When you remember my good side then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Xiao Liu grabbed some snacks from the kitchen and was about to leave when he saw s.h.i.+ Qi.Xiao Liu just finished tormenting Xiang Liu and was in a very good mood so waved a greeting to s.h.i.+ Qi with a bright smile. s.h.i.+ Qi hurried up his footsteps and there was a twinkle in his eye until he noticed the teeth mark on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck. For all intents and purposes it looked like a mark left by a kiss. s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes darted to Xiao Liu\u2019s room and the twinkle disappeared from his eyes. Xiao Liu told s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cXiang Liu is in my room. Don\u2019t bother him and let him rest. He\u2019ll leave when he wakes up. I have some things to do so I need to leave. Tell Lao Mu not to look for me.\u201dXiao Liu left without waiting for s.h.i.+ Qi to respond, thinking to himself where to hide so that the big demon couldn\u2019t find him. Where do I normally never go? As he thought and walked he ended up sneaking into the pretty boy\u2019s wine shop.The sun hadn\u2019t come up yet and Xiao Liu entered the store when it was still pitch black. He did it without being spotted and was feeling terribly pleased with himself. He was sleeping soundly against a tub of wine when he heard Xuan enter to grab some wine and the sound of talking.\u201cHow are they?\u201d\u201cThree died and one escaped back. Master, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re useless but this time it alerted that big demon Nine Lives. But three of our men risked their lives and managed to injure him.\u201d\u201cXiang Liu got injured?\u201d\u201cOur men in the mountains know its the perfect opportunity to get rid of him once and for all but he can\u2019t be found.\u201d\u201cHhhmmm.\u201d\u201cYour servant I shall leave now.\u201dThe door to the wine cellar closed and silence descended. Xiao Liu finally let out a pent up breath softly. He went back to sleep, feeling nothing in particular. General Gong Gong and Xuan Yuan had been fighting for a couple hundred years now. In the beginning, the Yellow Emperor sent army reinforcements, but the Middle Plains were still not conquered, Gao Xing was to the other side, Gong Gong was in an advantageous physical location so the Yellow Emperor lost all his battles. All he could do was keep Gong Gong cornered and wait for him to surrender one of these days.The war gradually went from open battles to secret scuffles and underhanded schemes of a.s.sa.s.sination\u2026\u2026..whatever Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t even think of, someone already tried it.Xuan Yuan even announced a reward, and Xiang Liu was the number one bounty on the list, even higher than Gong Gong. The reason was very odd \u2013 Gong Gong was n.o.bility from the Sheng Nong royal family so if anyone killed him for the bounty that would incur the wrath of the entire world. But Xiang Liu was fine \u2013 he was just a demon, and a hideous freakish nine-headed demon at that. So to kill him for the money reward wouldn\u2019t even cause anyone to have a sleepless thought.Whether Xuan wanted the money or something else, Xiao Liu would need to think about it. Everything in this world could be boiled down to money and power.Xiao Liu hid in the wine cellar for three days and on the fourth day sneaked into the kitchen for some snacks. With his mouth shoved full of goose meat he heard Xuan\u2019s voice behind him \u201cWant some wine to go with it?\u201dXiao Liu froze and turned his head to see Xuan leaning against the kitchen door gently looking at Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu giggled \u201cI\u2026..your food tastes better than Lao Mu makes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s even better warm.\u201d\u201cErm\u2026.then heat it up?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dXuan put some dishes on the stove and then fired it up. Xiao Liu sat beside him and Xuan poured him a bowl of wine and Xiao Liu slowly sipped it. \u201cIf you like, you can drink more.\u201d\u201cUhhm\u2026.thanks.\u201dXuan handed the warmed up food to him and then sat down to drink with Xiao Liu who thought that if it wasn\u2019t the middle of the night and also coming uninvited, this scene would be rather warm and inviting.Xiao Liu asked \u201cDid Ah Nian make the food? She\u2019s a good cook.\u201d\u201cAh Nian only knows how to eat.\u201d Xuan\u2019s voice contained a gentle coddling.\u201cCan\u2019t believe you know how to make wine and cook. Ah Nian is very lucky.\u201d\u201cShe calls me older brother, I ought to take care of her.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Ah Nian recently.\u201d It wasn\u2019t recently, it was almost never seen her.Xuan laughed \u201cBrother Liu misses Ah Nian?\u201d\u201cNo no, just asking.\u201d Best never to see her ever.\u201cI asked her to embroider a part.i.tion for me so she\u2019s been working in her room.\u201dXiao Liu was startled to realize the reason that demon wench was so quiet was because the pretty boy used a trick to keep her occupied.Xuan appeared to know what he was thinking \u201cIn the future if Ah Nian does anything that is rude, will Brother Liu please forgive her considering she\u2019s just a girl.\u201dIn the future? There is a future\u2026\u2026so he\u2019s not going to quietly get rid of him tonight? Xiao Liu smiled \u201cNo problem, no problem, I\u2019ll definitely let it slide.\u201d Xuan stood up and sincerely asked again so Xiao Liu said it again that he\u2019ll let Ah Nian\u2019s actions slide until it became a promise. Xiao Liu sighed and said wistfully \u201cIt\u2019s good to be your sister.\u201dThat was probably the most sincere thing Xiao Liu said all night and even Xuan felt it. His mask of a smile disappeared and he said \u201cNo, I am not a good brother.\u201d In his words there was the hint of sadness. Xiao Liu drank his wine \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201dXuan said \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d Xiao Liu stood up and Xuan walked him out \u201cCome by when you have time.\u201d \u201cOkay, you go back, no need to accompany me any further.\u201dXiao Liu ran back in a jiffy and flipped the wall into the courtyard then slipped into his room and closed the door. A person stood up from the edge of the pallet and Xiao Liu was so startled his back was to the door.It was death laying down or standing up so might as well get it over with. Xiao Liu closed his eyes and shook \u201cI\u2026..I\u2026.was wrong!\u201dLike a cat, using the gentlest voice to cajole an owner\u2019s forgiveness, hoping Xiang Liu would remember his ability to make poisons and also that his blood was healing, then perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be beaten half to death. Except\u2026.after a few moments, there was still no movement.Xiao Liu\u2019s heart was pounding furiously and finally he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and opened his eyes. It. Was. s.h.i.+. Qi!Xiao Liu was furious! He was so scared out of his wits! He pointed at s.h.i.+ Qi and wagged his finger \u201cYou\u2026.you\u2026..how come it\u2019s you?\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face was ashen and he voice despondent \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were disappointed.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing in my room?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi bit his lip and lowered his head and turned to leave. Xiao Liu quickly tried to apologize \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you were someone else. That\u2026.that\u2026.my tone of voice was harsh but don\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m not forbidding you from entering my room.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi moved past him and walked out, closing the door tightly behind him.Xiao Liu hadn\u2019t sleep comfortably in days so quickly took off his clothes and burrowed until the covers. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths \u2013 clean, warm, the faint scent of soap and suns.h.i.+ne.The comforter had been laundered and dried under the sun. Xiao Liu laughed and reminded himself not to get used to it. All people will leave and he can\u2019t get coddled, his life was to sleep in a cold blanket, in a dirty blanket. Xiao Liu finished reminding himself before turning around and falling fast asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAll of Tong Hua\u2018s leading men have been almost perfect in face and form so it\u2019s fascinating to see her create someone that is the opposite of that. Xiang Liu is also an incredibly difficult male lead and everything he says and does requires reading not just between the lines, but almost like searching int the mist for a hint of something more. I enjoy watching Xiao Liu live his ordinary life, the banter with the two war orphans Chuan Zi and Ma Zi, the quiet companions.h.i.+p of a old army deserter like Lao Mu, and now with the added quiet presence of s.h.i.+ Qi along with the extreme ups and downs anytime Xiang Liu shows up. I have to say all the blood sucking between them, coupled with they way they are thisclose to wanting to kill each other, it\u2019s so hot and dysfunctional but I can\u2019t imagine them interacting any other way. I love that Xiang Liu treats Xiao Liu not as a woman (and he totally knows she\u2019s a girl) or as someone to be stepped on. Xiao Liu clearly relishes making the poison for Xiang Liu and thrills in their interactions because it\u2019s an outlet for his loneliness. Xiao Liu is a leading lady that immediately owns my heart with the capacity to care wrapped in a sh.e.l.l of not caring at all.Chapter 4 \u2013 Gathering is the Hardest, Parting is the Easiest:The Autumn afternoon is the most beautiful time of the day. When no one was direly ill, Xiao Liu liked taking a big lily frond to cover his eyes and laying on the straw pallet used to dry herbs. He raised his two arms over his head against his ears and his two legs would naturally stick straight out as well with his toes pointed. His entire body was straight like a line and in his imagination his body could extend forever. That feeling of stretching, paired with the warm sun, the fragrant lily frond, it was like drinking wine into the bones and being slightly tipsy.He once encouraged Ma Zi and Lao Mu to bask in the sun in the same way but both felt it was super embarra.s.sing and refused to copy him. So this wonderful feeling, Xiao Liu can only experience it alone.Xiao Liu was done stretching and lowered his arms and pulled the frond off his eyes to look at s.h.i.+ Qi cutting the medicine. After Ma Zi had his baby, he was almost living full time at Butcher Gao\u2019s. Normally Chuan Zi would do some more ch.o.r.es but these past three months he was always out of the clinic doing G.o.d knows what. Only s.h.i.+ Qi remained in the clinic but Xiao Liu didn\u2019t feel like his work load increased and instead felt more at ease. Whatever he wanted to do he would discover s.h.i.+ Qi already did it.Xiao Liu sat up on the pallet and put the frond on his head and intently watched s.h.i.+ Qi working. s.h.i.+ Qi had his head lowered cutting the medicine and after he was done and put the medicine into satchels he went to work on another batch.Xiao Liu called 's.h.i.+ Qi.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi stopped and looked up at Xiao Liu silently. \u201cHhhmmm\u2026.\u201d Xiao Liu shook his head \u201cNothing.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi lowered his head and went back to work. 's.h.i.+ Qi.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi stopped again but this time didn\u2019t look up at Xiao Liu though he was listening. \u201cYou rest for a bit!\u201d\u201cNot tired.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi went back to work.Xiao Liu took off the frond and looked at s.h.i.+ Qi, tearing pieces off the front until it was in strips. Lao Mu and Chuan Zi never sensed that he was mad at s.h.i.+ Qi. But Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi both knew \u2013 in the beginning s.h.i.+ Qi wanted to apologize but Xiao Liu pretended to be clueless and was instead even more polite and courteous. Gradually s.h.i.+ Qi stopped trying and would only silently follow him like a shadow, finis.h.i.+ng the work that three people used to do.'s.h.i.+ Qi\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi raised his head to look at Xiao Liu but Xiao Liu didn\u2019t know what he wanted to say. He bit his lip and suddenly smiled and patted the s.p.a.ce next to him \u201cYou come here, I\u2019ll show you something fun.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi put down his ch.o.r.es and walked over. Xiao Liu laid down and explained to s.h.i.+ Qi what to do, showing him how to bask in the sun like he was doing. s.h.i.+ Qi was not like Ma Zi and Chuan Zi and immediately followed suit. Xiao Liu squinted as he counted the clouds above, feeling content and letting out a sigh. Even though it was the same sun warming him, the same pallet he was laying on, but two people basking under the sun felt particularly nice for some reason.Xiao Liu was almost falling asleep when s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s voice spoke \u201cThere won\u2019t be a second time.\u201d\u201cHhmmm?\u201d Xiao Liu drowsily opened his eyes.\u201cNo matter what reason, there won\u2019t be a second time when you need me but can\u2019t find me.\u201d Xiao Liu was totally awake now and suddenly realized his petty anger at s.h.i.+ Qi was totally pointless. Poor s.h.i.+ Qi spent all that time thinking about it. Xiao Liu sat up and was about to say something with a smile when Lao Mu came running in and grabbed Xiao Liu and bolted right out the door.\u201cShoes, I don\u2019t have shoes on!\u201d Xiao Liu put on his shoes and ran out the door but called back to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cLet\u2019s go together!\u201dXiao Liu ran pell mell behind Lao Mu until they arrived at the end of the street. Xiao Liu called out a greeting to Xuan and Lao Mu pulled him behind a few tubs of wine and made a gesture to Xuan who nodded clearly understanding what to do. Someone was crouched behind him and Xiao Liu knew it was s.h.i.+ Qi. He turned and make a goofy face to s.h.i.+ Qi before turning back to see what interesting thing was about to happen.Xuan coughed a few times and Lao Mu immediately tensed and Xiao Liu peered out over the tubs. Three prost.i.tutes walked over to buy some wine, two drank some and left but one remained behind. Xiao Liu was getting bored when Lao Mu nudged him and that\u2019s when Chuan Zi walked over and walked away with the remaining prost.i.tute. They walked until they were gone from sight.Lao Mu grabbed Xiao Liu and they raced through the alleys until they saw Chuan Zi and the prost.i.tute talking in the shadowy corner. Then they started kissing and Xiao Liu watched with a wide grin but Lao Mu was furious and upset. Xiao Liu peeked at s.h.i.+ Qi who was standing straight but kept his eyes lowered on his shoes and giving them privacy.The two of them against the wall got more heated and the girl was making moaning noises. Lao Mu wanted to rush out but didn\u2019t know how to handle this awkward situation. He told Xiao Liu \u201cYou deal with it!\u201d before huffing off.Xiao Liu didn\u2019t bother with Lao Mu and was instead laughing at s.h.i.+ Qi and inched over \u201cA scion of a well born family, even if unmarried there must be pretty serving maids in the house. How were the maids around you compared to this girl?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said nothing and was trying to inch away from Xiao Liu but he was already against the wall. Xiao Liu restrained his laugh and continued to be his evil self. He pressed his hands against the wall around s.h.i.+ Qi and trapped him, much like a playboy trying to seduce a gentle lady. \u201cWhat kind of girls do you like? An innocent fresh-faced type, or a girl like this who is pa.s.sionate?\u201dIn the sound of the woman\u2019s moans, s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face was starting to turn beet red and Xiao Liu was laughing inside so hard he was about to bust a gut. His evil naughty side was in control and he pressed close to s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face and asked \u201cYou want some, too?\u201dUnexpectedly, s.h.i.+ Qi raised his head and despite the faint blush, his clear eyes were filled with laughter. Xiao Liu was stunned and the only thought he had in his head was \u201cA wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing!\u201dXiao Liu was so embarra.s.sed and it was his turn to blush red so he vented his frustration out on Chuan Zi. He rushed forward yelling \u201cChuan Zi! Where did you get the nerve to learn to wh.o.r.e! Where did you get the money?\u201dChuan Zi was so scared he pulled his pants up and was about to run like his habit but after taking two steps he turned back to s.h.i.+eld the woman. The woman didn\u2019t look the least bit shamed as she fixed her clothing. She pushed Chuan Zi aside and bowed to Xiao Liu \u201cI am Xan Tian Er, Brother Chuan\u2019s sweetheart and I\u2019m not taking any of his money.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cYou\u2019re a prost.i.tute, if you\u2019re sleeping with him for free, isn\u2019t that bad for business?\u201d Xan Tian Er smiled \u201cI\u2019m happy to!\u201d Xiao Liu asked \u201cDo you want to sleep with him for the rest of your life?\u201dXan Tian Er paused and seemed to realize what Xiao Liu was asking but couldn\u2019t believe it. Chuan Zi quickly spoke Up \u201cI\u2019m willing! I\u2019m willing to sleep with her for the rest of my life!\u201d Xiao Liu kicked him hard \u201cScram to the side, I\u2019m talking to her!\u201dChuan Zi looked at Xan Tian Er with puppy dog eyes and kept nodding his head. Xan Tian Er finally believed what Xiao Liu was asking her and there were tears in her eyes. She knelt down \u201cI am willing.\u201d Xiao Liu added \u201cYou sure? Following Chuan Zi means working hard and it\u2019ll be a tough life.\u201d\u201cI am willing.\u201d\u201cDone. You go back and wait. Think about how you want to have the ceremony.\u201dXan Tian Er couldn\u2019t believe it and kept looking at Chuan Zi. It was this easy? Chuan Zi pulled her up \u201cBrother Liu may be really mean but he always does what he says.\u201dXiao Liu wrenched Chuan Zi\u2019s ear and dragged him off \u201cYou really have grown up!\u201d Chuan Zi was happy to have his dream come true so was alternatively yelping in pain and laughing happily towards s.h.i.+ Qi who followed behind with only smiling eyes for Xiao Liu.Pa.s.sing the wine shop, Xiao Liu called out to Xuan \u201cThanks!\u201d Xuan peeked at Xiao Liu pulling Chuan Zi\u2019s ear and opened his hands \u201cIf a wedding is coming, don\u2019t forget to buy from the shop.\u201d \u201cDone, you can discuss with Lao Mu when the time comes.\u201dXiao Liu dragged Chuan Zi all the way back to the clinic and right outside the door he whispered \u201cNow start yelping more pitifully.\u201d Chuan Zi reacted and started howling and crying as Xiao Liu kicked and beat him into the courtyard until he was in front of Lao Mu. Lao Mu\u2019s heart softened \u201cHe\u2019s all grown up, don\u2019t beat him in public at least wait until back home to save him some face.\u201dLao Mu was initially still furious but after seeing Xiao Liu deal with Chuan Zi he didn\u2019t know what to do next \u201cXiao Liu, what are we to do? How did Chuan Zi get mixed up with a prost.i.tute?\u201d Xiao Liu said \u201cThink of a way to buy her freedom. After we buy her free, we\u2019ll do what we did for Ma Zi.\u201dIf Lao Mu was from either Sheng Nong or Gao Xing Kingdoms, even if he loved Chuan Zi he would have a hard time accepting that Chuan Zi was going to marry a prost.i.tute. But he was from the Xuan Yuan G.o.d tribe, filled with wild abandon and ridicule towards social norms, so after he squatted on the doorstep for some time and thought about it, he decided there was nothing wrong with it. So that was how Chuan Zi\u2019s marriage was settled.Once Lao Mu decided on it, he went about making it happen. But the brothel decided to raise the price sky high and the cost to buy Xan Tian Er\u2019s freedom would allow Ma Zi to marry ten Chun Taos. Lao Mu tried to get people to be the middlemen but to no avail even with his and Xiao Liu\u2019s twenty-some years of relations.h.i.+ps in Qing Shui Town.Lao Mu was furious but there was nothing he could do. The brothels in Qing Shui Town were special, a place for information to be disseminated and gathered, filled with the most beautiful and talented girls, where powerful men would often go visit. There were various powers at play there, not just Sheng Nong, Gao Xing, and Xuan Yuan, but the various n.o.ble families from the Chi Sui family in the Middle Plains to the Fang Feng family from the North.Lao Mu furrowed his brow and sighed \u201cI see that Tian Er really wants to be with our Chuan Zi and now would rather get beaten then see another customer. That old madam is vile!\u201d Ma Zi felt bad and tried to talk Chuan Zi into giving up. No matter how pretty Xan Tian Er was, she wasn\u2019t someone for guys like them. Chuan Zi\u2019s face was ashen and he would sit on the courtyard stoop just cradling his head through sleepless nights.Inside his room, Xiao Liu laid on his pallet with his legs up looking at his precious little mirror and giggling. The image inside the mirror was all his glorious handiwork that night. He drew nine heads on Xiang Liu\u2019s face and his icy eyes were glaring at him like daggers.Xiao Liu stared at the mirror and flicked Xiang Liu\u2019s head \u201cGo ahead and rage! Go ahead and rage!\u201d After he was done flicking, he wiped the mirror and it returned to its original state. It appeared just a bit more ornate than an ordinary mirror but there was no sign that it contained anything from the past.This seemingly ordinary mirror was actually created from the spiritual essence of a mythical gorilla type beast in the inner wild desert region. It was vicious and had the power to see into the past. It was a power that worked against nature so it was hard to develop this ability and these beasts were even rarer to encounter. And a mirror created from the spiritual essence of such a beast, there was only one such mirror in existence. The reason was that to seal the spiritual essence of such a beast into an magical object and have it show the past required the beast to be completely willing without a shred of anger. But there was no such beast who endured the painful training to develop such a power to see the past who would be willing to die without any anger.Xiao Liu tucked the mirror away and put his hands behind his head. After that night, many months had pa.s.sed and Xiang Liu never showed up again. So many people were looking to take him down so it\u2019s normal for him not to appear. If he did appear Xiao Liu would feel like his life had reached the end. So Xiao Liu prayed every day for more people to be looking to take him down. Make his life so busy that he completely forgot about Qing Shui Town and one Wen Xiao Liu.But, now\u2026\u2026ais.h.!.+A little white condor that was the astral projection of the giant white flying condor Furball came flying in through the window and haughtily landed in front of Xiao Liu. Xiao Liu spoke to it \u201cSeeing you so puffed up, I just want to pluck all your feathers off, roast your right side, stew your left side, and after eating all of you throw your bones to the dogs.\u201dFurball charged Xiao Liu who grabbed his head and rolled under the pallet \u201cTell your master I need to see him. It\u2019s something important.\u201d Furball glared angrily at Xiao Liu before spreading his wings and flying into the night. Xiao Liu felt it a bad idea to meet Xiang Liu in the room. The same environment may cause him to remember the insult last time and he\u2019ll easily get enraged.Xiao Liu left the house and walked upstream with the river until he left Qing Shui Town and entered a deep dense forest. He saw a tree as thick as it would require 5-6 men to encircle it and climbed up that tree and found a comfortable spot and sat down.The tree was very high and could see far from the vantage point. The winding river glowed silver in the moonlight and if it wasn\u2019t the middle of the Winter with the bl.u.s.tery wind blowing then the view would be perfect.He\u2019s here!Xiao Liu raised his head and a white condor carrying Xiang Liu dove down from the center of the moon. White hair, white robe, flying down from the sky like falling snow, he softly landed beside Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu said \u201cThree choices. Whip me 40 times. Kick me off from here. Or listen to me say something important. Important!\u201dXiang Liu asked \u201cDid you bathe?\u201dXiao Liu was still cheeky \u201cBathed super clean, just waiting for my lord to arrive.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s hand grabbed Xiao Liu\u2019s shoulder and he lowered his head. Xiao Liu docilely tipped back his neck and when Xiang Liu\u2019s sharp fang pierced his skin and started drinking his blood, Xiao Liu didn\u2019t close his eyes and instead looked at the moon.Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t holding back and Xiao Liu gradually felt lightheaded. \u201cAre you planning to suck me dry all at once? Even if you have nine heads, I didn\u2019t hear that you had nine stomachs! Can\u2019t you save some for next time?\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s lips were still on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck and was right next to the artery that led straight to the heart \u201cWhen do you think I should bite down right here? Tonight?\u201dXiao Liu immediately countered \u201cNot tonight since it\u2019s too pretty out. Killing me is such a mood ruining thing to do, wait for the day when I really want to kill you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill me?\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cNo! You clearly know I don\u2019t want to kill you, and I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. All I know is that you ought to hate me.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know and you dared to come see me while still nursing your injury? You really see me as a harmless bunny rabbit? Or are your nine brains fighting with each other and now you\u2019re stupid because none of them work?\u201dXiang Liu leaned in to clearly continue his meal so Xiao Liu quickly added \u201cBecause I\u2019m lonely!\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s lips pressed against his neck and didn\u2019t move.\u201cNo matter if you believe me or not, but I really don\u2019t hate you at all and don\u2019t want to kill you. Because I\u2019m very lonely. I developed a strange tic when I was hiding in the deep mountains and went many years without encountering another person. I caught a monkey and started talking to it all day long. The monkey tried to escape and when it couldn\u2019t it actually hit its head against the cave wall and committed suicide. Later on, I encountered a snake that wanted to eat me and almost bit off my leg. But it could understand what I was saying and reacted to whatever I said. I knew it was dangerous but I couldn\u2019t help myself and could constantly go prance around in front of it. It was so furious it almost went insane. Having it around, it wasn\u2019t so lonely in the mountains anymore.\u201d Xiao Liu laughed \u201cAfter some time, he discovered I was super sneaky and wanted to leave but I wouldn\u2019t let it and kept bothering it so it kept trying to kill me.\u201dXiao Liu looked up at the moon and there was an indescribable sadness in his eyes \u201cThey say the Heavens favors the tribes of the G.o.ds, but I think it favors the humans. They are just like the G.o.ds in every way except their lives are so short in comparison. Look at the moon, it\u2019s been there like that for the last thousand years. No matter how beautiful a sight one will still get tired of it.\u201cThat snake, what happened afterwards?\u201d\u201cDied!\u201d\u201cYou killed it?\u201d\u201cNo, the King of the fox tribe.\u201d\u201cNine-tailed fox?\u201dXiao Liu shut his eyes \u201cThe Nine-tailed fox wanted to kill me but the snake believed only it could eat me so it blocked the path of that vicious fox\u2026so it ended up dead!\u201dXiang Liu softly chuckled \u201cInteresting. And the fox?\u201d\u201cI killed it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re that powerful?\u201d\u201cHe should have killed me the moment he caught me. But he was consumed by hatred and greed. He used various special creatures to feed to me, forcing me to eat eat many disgusting things, all so that he could make me nice and plump before eating me. He intended to use my mythical blood to help him recover his lost powers\u2026\u2026Oh, I forgot to tell you, he wasn\u2019t a Nine-tailed fox by then, just an eight tail since he got a tail cut off so his powers were severely depleted. He raised me for thirty years and right when he was about to partake of the victory, one day he accidentally got drunk in front of me.\u201d\u201cHe kept you locked up in a cage?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dXiang Liu was silent for a moment and his hand was ma.s.saging Xiao Liu\u2019s neck \u201cAm I the snake to help alleviate your loneliness?\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cWho knows? Perhaps I\u2019m the snake who is amusing you.\u201dXiang Liu released him \u201cThe important thing!\u201d\u201cDoes the brothel on Dong Gui street belong to you guys?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d\u201cChuan Zi wants a prost.i.tute from there.\u201d\u201cYou want to ask me to help you secure her freedom?\u201d\u201cDoes that brothel belong to you guys? I guess not. It doesn\u2019t seem like the way you operate anyways.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled and a light glinted in his eye \u201cNo need to help me, I\u2019ll go ask another person for help.\u201dThe white condor Furball flew back and was circling overhead. Xiang Liu lightly leaped up and landed on the condor\u2019s back \u201cThis was your important business?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026..Chuan Zi\u2019s marriage is important\u2026\u2026\u2026..Ah\u2014\u2014\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s branch suddenly snapped in half and he fell, slamming through various other branches and causing Xiao Liu to start spitting up blood. Wham, Xiao Liu finally landed on the ground as a swirl of dirt blew up around him.Furball was so happy and circling low overhead to mock Xiao Liu. Xiang Liu stood on his back with a smile \u201cYou are the snake egg that anyone can eat.\u201d Furball rose higher and Xiang Liu left.Xiao Liu waited a few moments before slowly sitting up. His head was spinning and he couldn\u2019t see straight and his legs hurt so much he couldn\u2019t walk. The startled chipmunk peered out at him and Xiao Liu smiled \u201cWhat\u2019cha looking at? Looking at me being made a fool? I didn\u2019t get to be a fool for nothing, I traded something small for something big, The next time I see that big demon he won\u2019t be looking to wring my neck\u2026..\u201dThe sun hadn\u2019t even rose when s.h.i.+ Qi tracked him down and found Xiao Liu curled up within a tangle of broken branches. He looked totally beaten up but was sleeping with a slight smile on his lips. s.h.i.+ Qi knelt down and slowly picked off the leaves on his head and saw that there were two fresh bite marks on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck. It was slightly hidden underneath his collar with the red teeth impression vaguely showing the imprint of a pair of lips.Xiao Liu\u2019s eyelid fluttered open 's.h.i.+ Qi?\u201d He opened his eyes and smiled \u201cI can\u2019t walk again.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi piggybacked the docile Xiao Liu on his back. Xiao Liu rested for three days and when he was able to move around on crutches had Lao Mu make a few dishes and invited Xuan over to drink.Xuan arrived and Xiao Liu warmly poured everyone a bowl of wine. Lao Mu and Chuan Zi drank their wine and promptly fell over fast asleep. Xuan smiled at Xiao Liu while s.h.i.+ Qi quietly sat to the side. Xiao Liu said to Xuan \u201cI asked you here to ask for something.\u201d\u201cPlease tell.\u201d\u201cChuan Zi wants Xan Tian Er, so can you help make it happen.\u201d Xuan said nothing. Xiao Liu earnestly added \u201cI know this seems rather abrupt but Chuan Zi\u2019s marriage is very important so I am shamelessly asking you.\u201d\u201cWhy does Brother Liu think I can help?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the true ident.i.ty of you or Ah Nian but I know you are from no ordinary background. I was curious and wanted to asked around but you sniffed it out. If Brother Xuan wanted to help then you can.\u201d Xiao Liu tried to be extra buddy buddy and called him Brother Xuan.Xuan glanced at s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cAh Nian and I just want to live a quiet life.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I know. I promise I won\u2019t bother you guys ever.\u201dXuan stared at Xiao Liu who smiled \u201cI have lived in Qing Shui Town for over twenty years. I am just me.\u201dXuan got up to leave \u201cRemember to invite me for the wedding banquet.\u201d Xiao Liu was all smiles \u201cI will, I will!\u201d Lao Mu drowsily got up \u201cHow did I get drunk so fast?\u201d Xiao Liu laughed \u201cWho told you to drink so fast. Next time eat something before drinking. Tomorrow go and try to buy her freedom again.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026..\u201d\u201cIf I tell you to go, then go.\u201dInside Hui Chun Clinic, it appeared Lao Mu was in charge but when Xiao Liu decided to have the last word then Lao Mu did as he was told. The next day Lao Mu got himself ready and went to buy Tian Er. The old biddy actually accepted the price offered in exchange for Xiao Liu giving them a concoction for avoiding pregnancy. Lao Mu was ecstatic and immediately agreed. The transaction was finalized and Lao Mu brought Xan Tian Er back to the clinic.When Chuan Zi saw Tian Er, he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Gradually his eyes misted and his nose got stuffy so he lowered his head and gruffly said \u201cI\u2019ll go to sister-in-law to borrow a few outfits for you.\u201dXiao Liu smiled and told Lao Mu \u201cPrepare some good dishes to celebrate tonight.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Lao Mu grabbed the shopping basket and happily head out the door.Xiao Liu\u2019s face cooled as he looked at Xan Tian Er \u201cDo you believe that I can leave you wis.h.i.+ng you were dead?\u201d Tian Er sat down \u201cI believe you.\u201d\u201cWho are you working for?\u201dXan Tian Er touched her face \u201cUsing my looks, Brother Liu is not giving my compet.i.tion enough credit and definitely not the men!\u201d\u201cWhy did you seduce Chuan Zi? I don\u2019t believe you would spare him a second glance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing customers since I was thirteen and in the twelve years since I\u2019ve seen enough guys. Chuan Zi may not have much but he\u2019s the only one willing the marry me.\u201d Tian Er smiled \u201cThree months ago, a man came to me and gave me money to seduce Chuan Zi. I don\u2019t have much position at the brothel so if I don\u2019t save up then I\u2019ll starve to death when I get old. I agreed and Chuan Zi never had a woman before so I just let him sample what a woman can give and he immediately vowed to marry me. Since I was thirteen such words leave me numb and I never believed it. But I can\u2019t believe you guys really did come and buy my freedom. The madam hated that I found a guy behind her back so she purposely raised the price high. But last night the man came again and gave me another sack of money and said the deal between us was done. If I wanted to marry Chuan Zi, then use that money to buy my own freedom.\u201d\u201cDo you recognize that man?\u201dTian Er shook her head \u201cBrother Liu knows, the G.o.ds and demons can all change their looks. I\u2019m just a human.\u201d Tian Er knelt down \u201cTwelves years as a prost.i.tute and my heart is cold and hard. Even now I don\u2019t believe Chuan Zi won\u2019t discard me one day and plans to live an entire lifetime with me. But I can try it, if Chuan Zi really wants to be with me\u2026.\u201d Tian Er raised her hand \u201cI solemnly swear to the Heavens that I will be true to him.\u201dXiao Liu looked at Tian Er and said nothing.Tian Er lowered her head and her voice was soft \u201cA cold and hard heart can keep out the pain, but also keeps out the joy. I really want a man to turn me back twelve years ago, let my heart soften so that I can cry and laugh. If Chuan Zi is that man, then I will treasure him more than my own life.\u201dChuan Zi was dragging Ma Zi and ran in \u201cSister-in-law said\u2026\u2026\u201d He stopped when she saw Tian Er kneeling before Xiao Liu who laughed \u201cWhat? Your wife is giving me a bow, you have a problem with that?\u201dChuan Zi looked at Tian Er with a smiling red face and Tian Er was like suddenly letting a heavy load off as she slumped forward and solemnly bowed her head to Xiao Liu. When she raised her head there were tears in her eyes.Xiao Liu waved her off \u201cCan you cook? If you can\u2019t, go to the kitchen and learn from Lao Mu!\u201dAfter dinner Chuan Zi and Tian Er went for a walk along the river. It was freezing cold but neither was scared and slowly walked and chatted. Xiao Liu leaned on his crutches and watched them from a distance with s.h.i.+ Qi beside him. Xiao Liu started nattering \u201cThis is actually an interesting gamble. Tian Er doesn\u2019t believe Chuan Zi will want to be with her forever so right now she\u2019s giving him all fake affection. But the more Tian Er is nice to him, the more Chuan Zi is nicer to her. The fake affection will gradually be mixed with real feeling, and as a lifetime pa.s.ses even the false becomes true. But during this process it\u2019s not without risk. Tian Er is gambling with her heart and if Chuan Zi dared to discard her then one of them is going to end up dead.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cMy life is very long, I can wait to see the outcome.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi looked at the two people \u201cXuan, why?\u201dXiao Liu answered \u201cLast time I snuck into his place to eat chicken and he started being wary of me. He used Tian Er to find out who was behind me. If I asked Xiang Liu to help then that\u2019ll create an even bigger problem down the road. Even though he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m completely trustworthy, but time will show him that I really am not involved in anything. Let\u2019s not catch a cold with them so head back.\u201dXiao Liu handed his crutches to s.h.i.+ Qi and playfully hopped back to the house. When he hopped on the stoop there was a thin layer of ice that Xiao Liu wasn\u2019t looking out for so he fell backwards into s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s arms. Xiao Liu tried to grab the crutches in s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s hands but came up empty and fell back into his arms again.The two of them stared at each other in silence. \u201cThat\u2026..thank you.\u201d Xiao Liu turned and hopped back into the house.In the Spring when hundreds of flowers blossomed was when Chuan Zi and Xan Tian Er got married. It was a simple wedding and only close friends of Ma Zi and Chuan Zi were invited along with Butcher Gao and Xuan. Chun Tao was pregnant again and she sat down with a smile but never spoke with Tian Er. When her daughter would run over Chun Tao would pull her away and tell her not to bother auntie.Chuan Zi was so happy he didn\u2019t notice a lot of things, but his laughter was resounding and brought joy to the entire house. Xiao Liu munched on a duck neck and watched them with a smile. This is the sweet, sour, bitter ordinary life. Whether it was sweet or bitter tea, half depended on the Heavens and half depended on the person.In the middle of the banquet, Ah Nian arrived. When Xiao Liu turned around, s.h.i.+ Qi was already gone. Lao Mu warmly welcomed her and she nodded to Lao Mu while telling Xuan \u201cXuan gege, Hai Tang said you were at a wedding banquet here.\u201dAh Nian glanced at Chuan Zi and Xan Tian Er and it was a look of unbridled disdain that even the happily he was loopy Chuan Zi could feel it. Chuan Zi\u2019s face hardened but Tian Er wasn\u2019t upset because she quickly realized that Ah Nian\u2019s disdain was for everyone at this banquet. Ah Nian\u2019s disdain coming from a place so lofty, so absolutely untouchable, it made everyone feel their own lowly position. Butcher Gao remembered he was often smelling like meat, Chun Tao worried her fingernails were dirty\u2026\u2026..Ma Zi and Chuan Zi were tightly clenching their fists but Ah Nian did nothing and said nothing. She just stood there looking at everyone. Xiao Liu was impressed \u2013 how the heck was this chit raised? How could she be so boldly arrogant and condescending, with disdain raining down on everyone, yet left everyone feeling like she was right to look down on them that way?Xuan stood up to leave but Ah Nian put down a handkerchief and sat down \u201cXuan gege, I\u2019ve never seen such a banquet before, let them continue.\u201d Xiao Liu was about to spit up blood and even Chuan Zi was about to flip tables but Xan Tian Er stopped him with a smile \u201cLet\u2019s toast the lady.\u201dAh Nian stuck her nose up \u201cI\u2019m not going to drink since your cups aren\u2019t clean.\u201d Xiao Liu kept repeating over and over \u201cI need to endure her, I need to endure her\u2026\u2026\u201dXuan took the cup from Chuan Zi and gulped it down. Ah Nian furrowed her brows but said nothing. She curiously looked at the dishes and said to Lao Mu \u201cI heard the dishes represent how important the bride is. Since the dishes look so c.r.a.ppy, you guys don\u2019t think very highly of the bride.\u201dEven Tian Er\u2019s face fell now and Xiao Liu decided to send the guests off NOW. He said to Xuan and Ah Nian \u201cYou guys are leaving? NOT STAYING? Then be safe and leave well!\u201d Xuan pulled Ah Nian up and headed for the door while apologizing to Xiao Liu. Ah Nian glared at Xiao Liu \u201cEvery time I see you I despise you. If it wasn\u2019t for big brother then I would order you whipped.\u201dXiao Liu thought \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your older brother then I would whip YOU.\u201d After Xuan and Ah Nian left, Xiao Liu let out a sigh of relief. He walked around the outside and through the medicine patch and to the river. He saw s.h.i.+ Qi sitting there looking out at the water. Xiao Liu stood beside him \u201cSix years ago during the Spring, you were laying in the pile of logs.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi turned to look at him with a smile \u201cSix years.\u201d Xiao Liu squatted next to s.h.i.+ Qi and said with a smile \u201cEven Chuan Zi and Ma Zi can tell you don\u2019t belong at Hui Chun Clinic. Xuan clearly can see it. Since he\u2019s already wary of me, he\u2019s likely already sent someone to investigate your background.\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes were clear with a hint of a smile, remaining calm and peaceful as if he was above the fray. Like he was one with the mountains and streams and wind and flowers.Xiao Liu sighed. Actually s.h.i.+ Qi was another type of lofty personage. Ah Nian\u2019s type made Xiao Liu want to jerk her down and whip her. s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s type made Xiao Liu want to rub his dirt all over s.h.i.+ Qi so that he got some dirt on himself, so that he wouldn\u2019t disappear into the wind and become like the cloud.Xuao Liu picked up a rock and tossed it into the water and it splashed droplets on s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face. That made Xiao Liu happy and when s.h.i.+ Qi took out a cloth to wipe Xiao Liu forbade him to. s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t understand but stopped wiping and instead used it to wipe the water from Xiao Liu\u2019s face.The condor Furball swooped towards them close to the river\u2019s surface and Xiang Liu stared at them with an amused expression. Xiao Liu immediately stood up and walked forward, not even turning his head around while telling s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cYou go back first!\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi was worried and didn\u2019t want to go at first, but then he remembered the imprint of a kiss on the inside of the collar and he lowered his head and silently left.Xiao Liu stood in the water and looked up at Xiang Liu \u201cComing to give a wedding present?\u201d To remind me that there is one more hostage?Furball flew lower and Xiang Liu reached out his hand. Xiao Liu grabbed his hand and vaulted on the back of the condor before they were suddenly in the clouds. Xiao Liu pressed against the condor\u2019s back and looked down. Furball was flying low so Xiao Liu could see the view on land until they flew over the ocean. Furball was so happy he was crowing and twirling in the air. Xiao Liu\u2019s mythical powers were quite low so he gripped the back tightly with his face ashen. He said to Xiang Liu \u201cI would rather you killed me by sucking all my blood dry than by falling to my death.\u201dXiang Liu asked \u201cWhy are your spiritual powers so low?\u201d\u201cThat evil fox wanted to not waste my powers so he used medicine to suck it out of me and then slowly drip it through my blood so its better when he eats me.\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cI heard the pain of getting the powers sucked out is like having one\u2019s bones stripped. Looks like those 40 lashes were too soft, I need to find a new torture method.\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s face was white \u201cDo you think it\u2019s like singing, one gets better with more practice? Because it was so painful back then, that is why I\u2019m more afraid of any pain than anyone!\u201dXiang Liu patted Furball who immediately stopped teasing and started flying properly. Xiao Liu let out a sigh of relief and went back to sitting properly. Furball was flying slow and evenly while Xiang Liu looked out at the horizon, his face like the still water, without any emotion. Xiao Liu asked \u201cYou\u2019re in a bad mood?\u201dXiang Liu quietly asked \u201cThose thirty years you were locked up in that cage. How did you endure it?\u201d\u201cIn the beginning I wanted to escape. I would yell, try to upset it. Later I stopped and just silently refused to cooperate. I tried to kill myself many time but never succeeded. Finally I gave up and tried to find joy in my situation. I would make bets with myself as to what nasty new thing the evil fox would bring. I loathed him and hated him with every fiber of my being. I started collecting materials to try and make a poison, thinking that when he ate me I would eat the poison first and poison him to death.\u201dXiao Liu scooted closer to Xiang Liu \u201cBut a person\u2019s heart is strange. Happiness or sorrow, it\u2019s all relative. If a person had only one biscuit a day but then saw beggars frozen on the street, he would feel happy because he wasn\u2019t as bad off. But if he saw all his friends get rich then he would feel sorry that his life was terrible. Do you really need me to get into more detail about my horrific past? I can consider embellis.h.i.+ng so that you\u2019ll think it\u2019s not just horrible, it\u2019s the worst ever!\u201dXiang Liu raised his hand to smack Xiao Liu who immediately closed his eyes and curled up like a beaten animal\u2019s automatic reaction to antic.i.p.ating more pain. Xiang Liu\u2019s hand lowered and he put it on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck. Xiao Liu saw that he didn\u2019t hit or bite and felt a bit bolder \u201cYou\u2019re really different tonight. Did you grow up in the ocean?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t answer and Furball descended until he was right up against the ocean surface. Xiang Liu got off the back of the condor and instead of falling in the water he was standing on the surface like it was land. He reached out his hand to Xiao Liu and he immediately grabbed it and slid off the condor. Furball was actually scared of water and immediately rose back into the air.Xiang Liu strolled along the waves with Xiao Liu. There wasn\u2019t a sliver of light, the ocean was pitch black, there was nothing ahead of them, there was nothing behind them. The world was so vast and Xiao Liu felt so miniscule as if a wave could swallow him at any time. He grabbed Xiang Liu\u2019s hand tightly.Xiang Liu suddenly stopped and Xiao Liu didn\u2019t know why but he didn\u2019t ask any questions. He inched closer to Xiang Liu and kept him company staring out towards the East. After some time, a moon rose from the edge of the ocean and the quiet beauty was so powerful that Xiao Liu felt the hard sh.e.l.l around his heart soften. In the sound of the ocean waves, Xiang Liu\u2019s voice spoke \u201cAs long as there are such sights in this world, then life is very precious.\u201dXiao Liu nattered \u201cThe most precious of sights will get old after seeing it too much. Only if someone views it with me. Views are dead, only if a person can appreciate it then the view has meaning.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear whether Xiang Liu heard what Xiao Liu said, but he didn\u2019t respond. The most beautiful view had pa.s.sed and Xiang Liu summoned Furball to take them back. Xiang Liu closed his eyes and there was exhaustion in his brows. Xiao Liu asked \u201cWhy are you in a bad mood?\u201dXiang Liu ignored him so Xiao Liu just spoke out loud \u201cSince Little Zhu Rong took over running the Middle Plains, I hear the Middle Plains are starting to be well managed. The Yellow Emperor will eventually deal with General Gong Gong. The power structure in this world can\u2019t be reversed, and definitely not by the will of one person. I suggest you take off sooner rather than later. Actually, you\u2019re just a demon, and a loathsome nine-headed one at that. With those sn.o.bbish G.o.ds of the Sheng Nong tribe, in their eyes you are\u2026\u2026you are less than nothing. Why do you have to worry about the Sheng Nong rebel army. What can you get by following General Gong Gong? Do you like power? Then why don\u2019t you betray Gong Gong and cast your lot with the Yellow Emperor\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dXiang Liu opened his eyes and it was blood red with a demon glare. Xiao Liu was shaken by his glance like his entire body was paralyzed and blood began to drop from his nostrils and his fingertips. \u201cI\u2026..wrong\u2026..wrong\u2026..\u201d Xiang Liu closed his eyes and Xiao Liu\u2019s body toppled forward onto the condor\u2019s back like a used rag. When they were almost back at Qing Shui Town, Xiao Liu sat up and wiped the blood away before wordlessly falling off the side into the river.Xiao Liu floated down the river and let the water rinse away all traces of blood. Xiao Liu looked at the full moon above as it shone on the entire land. Xiao Liu climbed on land and pushed open the front door dripping wet. s.h.i.+ Qi immediately stood up from inside the kitchen and Xiao Liu smiled at him \u201cAny hot soup? I want some.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Liu walked onto his room and took off his clothes, drying himself before putting on clean clothes and burrowing under the clean warm blanket. s.h.i.+ Qi entered with a hot bowl of soup and Xiao Liu sat up an slowing drank it and his body warmed up. s.h.i.+ Qi took a towel to dry his hair and Xiao Liu leaned his head back and closed his eyes.s.h.i.+ Qi looked and didn\u2019t see any lip marks on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck and his lips curved upward. s.h.i.+ Qi finished drying his hair but didn\u2019t want to stop so grabbed a brush from the table and combed through it.Xiao Liu said softly \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t spoil me. If I get used to it, what\u2019ll I do when you leave.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t leave.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled, millions made promises, it was hard to find one who kept them. If he was s.h.i.+ Qi, it might\u2019ve been easier, but he wasn\u2019t just s.h.i.+ Qi.There was an extra woman now in Hui Chun Clinic but not much had changed. Lao Mu tended the kitchen stoves and Tian Er tried to learn but appeared to lack that innate talent. Chuan Zi still washed his own clothes since Tian Er destroyed three outfits in a row was.h.i.+ng it. Chuan Zi and Tian Er\u2019s life together didn\u2019t start off smoothly but Tian Er was trying and Chuan Zi was very caring and understanding so the two of them were very happy.s.h.i.+ Qi was still a man of few words but a hard worker. Xiao Liu was still full of energy at times, completely lazy at others.It was a Summer midday and not many people were on the street since it was so hot. Without a patient, Xiao Liu sat down under the awning fanning himself and zoning out.A richly decked out carriage rumbled past and the wind blew the curtains up to show a gorgeous lady inside. Xiao Liu gasped at the beauty and his eyes followed the carriage. The carriage stopped outside the jewelry store run by owner Yu s.h.i.+n who got out and greeted the lady. Yu s.h.i.+n was a well known personage in Qing Shui Town not because his jewelry store was all that profitable, but because he owned all the shops on this street. Once a year Lao Mu needed to go to the jewelry shop to pay the rent on the clinic.Qing Shui Town may be like a pan of loose sand but it wasn\u2019t completely a mess thanks to Yu s.h.i.+n. He wasn\u2019t a government official but worked hard to maintain rules and order here. As one would see it, Yu s.h.i.+n was like half the authority in Qing Shui Town. So when he was bowing to someone else it caused the entire street to be stunned. Everyone wanted to discuss it but was too scared to discuss it. Wanted to look but didn\u2019t dare look. In a second the entire mood changed on the street.Xiao Liu wasn\u2019t just stunned, he was very interested because Hui Chun Clinic was where he spent the last twenty some years of his life. He planned to keep on spending his life here and he liked all the neighbors on this street and didn\u2019t want to see anything change.The next day, the news broke that Yu s.h.i.+n wanted to take back some of the shops. Lao Mu sighed and even Chuan Zi and Ma Zi were in a daze. Butcher Gao heard the scoop and came to share that Yu s.h.i.+n wanted to take back Hui Chun Clinic because it was close to the river and there was another patch of fertile land. Lao Mu cursed since when he rented the place it was just an empty lot that he worked hard to make fertile. But in front of the authority of Qing Shui Town there was nothing he could do other than endure a sleepless night.Xiao Liu liked water and didn\u2019t want to leave here so decided to go see the authority Yu s.h.i.+n. s.h.i.+ Qi could see Xiao Liu cleaning up to head out so he followed behind. Xiao Liu was welcomed back to the lavishly decorated courtyard to see Yu s.h.i.+n. Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi bowed respectfully and asked if it was true he was taking back some shops? Yu s.h.i.+n admitted it and Xiao Liu asked to keep renting if he was looking for a higher rent.Yu s.h.i.+n appeared to think it funny that Xiao Liu was talking money with him \u201cForget the rent for one shop, the rent for all the shops on this street isn\u2019t worth mentioning.\u201dXiao Liu didn\u2019t understand business so had no clue what he was saying. After some time he asked \u201cSo what does Mr. Yu want to do with all the shops?\u201dYu s.h.i.+n added \u201cYou\u2019ve lived here for twenty years so I\u2019ll be candid with you. I\u2019m just a servant and my master\u2019s family is beyond wealthy. Forget one shop, they can afford to let the entire Qing Shui Town sit useless and empty just because they feel like it.\u201d Yu s.h.i.+n finished and sent them away.Xiao Liu lowered his head to leave. If this was a plot then he couldn\u2019t find a way to solve it. An owner wanting to take back a shop was perfectly legal and there was nothing he could do about it.\u201cStop!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice came from above. Xiao Liu halted and raised his head to see the beautiful lady from the carriage. s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t stop and kept walking while the the girl was so anxious she jump down from the second floor and ran to embrace s.h.i.+ Qi with tears streaming down her face \u201cMy lord, my lord\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi was standing ramrod straight and didn\u2019t turn around. The woman collapsed at his feet in tears \u201cThey all said my lord was dead\u2026..but none of us believed it! Nine years! Nine years!\u2026\u2026The Heavens heard us, to let your servant I find you.\u201dHearing the woman crying, Yu s.h.i.+n rushed out and when he saw the woman kneeling by s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s feet, he immediately knelt down, too. The woman tearfully asked \u201cMy lord, why are you not talking. It\u2019s your servant Jing Ye. Did you forget? And Lan Xiang, too. You use to tease us about our names\u2026..Yu s.h.i.+n, hurry up and send message to the Grand Madam that we found our second lord. My lord, have you forgotten the Grand Madam as well?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi turned around and looked at Xiao Liu, the few short steps between them became an expanse so wide it couldn\u2019t be bridged. There was such sorrow in his eyes. Xiao Liu smiled at him and walked over to say something but his usually glib tongue actually failed him. He could only try harder to keep smiling and smiling. He gestured for him to handle his family affairs and he was off.Xiao Liu went back to Hui Chun Clinic. Chuan Zi and Tian Er was out looking for another shop while Lao Mu sat there in a daze sighing. Xiao Liu sat down next to him and looked out the courtyard. Lao Mu \u201cLived here for twenty years, I\u2019m going to miss it!\u201dXiao Liu mumbled \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine now, we can stay as long as we want, even if we don\u2019t pay rent no one will take it back.\u201dLao Mu startled for a moment \u201cDid you convince the owner?\u201d \u201cYou can say that.\u201d Lao Mu gave the Heavens a thanks. Xiao Liu added \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be with you until you are old and send you off. You\u2019re life span is shorter so I\u2019ll be with you until you die. I won\u2019t let you be all alone, with no one to rely on and no one to talk to. Who knows who will be with me until I die\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dLao Mu shook Xiao Liu \u201cYou\u2019re starting to pity yourself\u2026.\u201d Xiao Liu said \u201cLao Mu, at least you\u2019re reliable!\u201d Lao Mu rubbed Xiao Liu\u2019s head \u201cMy Xiao Liu is a good kid, the Heavens will watch over you.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled and patted Lao Mu on the shoulder \u201cGo work.\u201dAt dinnertime Tian Er asked where s.h.i.+ Qi was and everyone looked at Xiao Liu who smiled \u201cHe\u2019s gone, no need to make his portion anymore.\u201d Lao Mu sighed \u201cGood, I was always worried about him.\u201d Chuan Zi and Tian Er went right back to eating, s.h.i.+ Qi spoke so little Chuan Zi never felt like he was around and Tian Er was here so recently she didn\u2019t get used to him.That night, Xiao Liu walked along the stone path through the medicine patch to the river. He strolled along the river and someone followed behind him, speeding up and slowing down along with him. The Summer breeze brought the scent of hops and it calmed Xiao Liu down. He stopped and turned around. s.h.i.+ Qi stood behind him wearing the same old sack cloth robe which had been laundered and now smelled like fragrant incense.Xiao Liu said \u201cI don\u2019t like this scent on you.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi lowered his head and Xiao Liu smiled \u201cI liked the smell of medicinal herbs. Next time when you come see me, I\u2019ll give you a satchel of medicinal herbs.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi raised his head and it was like stars had fallen into his eyes as it sparkled with hope. Xiao Liu smiled and kept on walking so s.h.i.+ Qi hurried up to walk alongside.From then on, s.h.i.+ Qi would always wear the same sack cloth robe and come walk with Xiao Liu every night by the river. The two of them would walk until Xiao Liu got tired and went back to sleep, and then s.h.i.+ Qi would leave. The days seem to pa.s.s not very different then before, except the topic of their conversations had changed.Xiao Liu would ask \u201cHow many servants do you have?\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cHow much money do you have?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYears ago\u2026.was that because of an inheritance battle?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs Jing Ye prettier? Or Lan Xiang?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cDo you remember all the herbs I taught you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201cRemember them well because it looks ordinary but if you add little things to it, it can take down even a G.o.d or a demon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not that nine-headed monster Xiang Liu, with nine-lives and can eat whatever he wants.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs Jing Ye prettier? Or Lan Xiang?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThe serving people are usually the least trustworthy. You be careful.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026..don\u2019t resort to violence. Pretend to be stupid and endure. If it resorts to violence then you have to be thorough and end it right then and there.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said nothing.Xiao Liu sighed \u201cIf you really can\u2019t beat them, then come back. You can keep brewing medicine for me, at least you won\u2019t starve to death.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stared at Xiao Liu and there were rolling waves in his eyes seemingly pulling Xiao Liu in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI\u2019m so happy so many folks are as enchanted by this novel as I am and are following along. It feels like the book club days of Da Mo Yao and Yun Zhong Ge are back, but I understand Lost You Forever plops everyone right into the story so it\u2019s harder to discuss in the early chapters without much information to go by. Poor s.h.i.+ Qi is forcibly dragged back to his past life, and for him and Xiao Liu, it\u2019s a difficult choice but one both are likely used it since they have\u2019t lived easy carefree lives until now either. The romance parts of the story hasn\u2019t fully gotten underway yet but it\u2019s clear s.h.i.+ Qi is completely in love with Xiao Liu. It\u2019s love, it\u2019s devotion, it\u2019s grat.i.tude, it\u2019s appreciation, it\u2019s everything he expresses in action and nothing that words enough could convey. Xiao Liu is clearly sad that s.h.i.+ Qi is gone, but what does that sadness mean? Sadness because of loss or because of disappointment, or a bit of both wrapped in the confirmation that yet again nothing is forever. Xiao Liu\u2019s interactions with Xiang Liu are a lot more fascinating because of how much he talks, and how they say and do things to each other that seem totally bizarre to anyone watching but seemingly fine to them. Xiang Liu sucks Xiao Liu\u2019s blood to heal, but to s.h.i.+ Qi he only sees the imprint of what looks like a kiss rather than a bite. That\u2019s so telling, and the way Xiao Liu makes poisons and prays for Xiang Liu to die is at odds with how much Xiao Liu lights up in anxiety and fascination anytime Xiang Liu shows up. There is also Xuan, who I can\u2019t talk about yet until his ident.i.ty gets revealed in this novel, because the connection between Xiao Liu and Xuan is at a completely different plane than whatever Xiao Liu has with s.h.i.+ Qi.Chapter 5 \u2013 Wish to Entrust Myself to the Mountains and Streams:Lao Mu went to buy groceries, Chuan Zi went to deliver medicine, and Xan Tian Er was in the room learning to sew clothes for Chuan Zi. Without any patients, Xiao Liu sprawled on the pallet sleeping. When he woke up there still wasn\u2019t any patients so he rapped himself on the head. Can\u2019t just mold away like this, best find something to do.Xiao Liu decided to go to Xuan\u2019s wine shop to drink. He put his hands behind him and hummed a little ditty, hopping along until Xuan saw him and warmly called out \u201cBrother Liu, what do you want to drink?\u201dXiao Liu found a corner spot and sat down and replied warmly \u201cWhatever Brother Xuan decides.\u201dXuan brought him a jug of wine and a plate of cashews. Xiao Liu looked around, peeled the cashews, and drank his wine. He then saw sitting in the opposite corner a man wearing immaculate richly decorated clothes and a straw hat that s.h.i.+elded his face. Even though his face was hidden and he wasn\u2019t wearing any expensive jewelry, but his elegant demeanor immediately made one feel respectful towards him. Xiao Liu was racking his brain thinking of when such a lofty personage came to Qing Shui Town when a beautiful maid hurried in and bowed to the man before standing behind him. It was Jing Ye dressed like a man.Xiao Liu understood and immediately lowered his head to focus on peeling the cashews. On that table there was also a plate of cashews, initially it was untouched but now that man was also peeling it. But he didn\u2019t eat it and instead neatly placed it back on the plate.s.h.i.+ Qi said something in a low voice and Jing Ye bowed and retreated. He walked over and sat next to Xiao Liu and placed the plate of peeled cashews before him.Hai Tang came out to greet customers, sitting behind the counter and counting the money, occasionally glancing towards s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu. Because of Hai Tang, the business in the shop got busier as more men came to buy wine. Those with money sat inside, those without held their bowls and sat outside, all of them ogling Hai Tang.After some bowls of wine were in the gullet, tongues began to loosen. Whatever interesting happened in Qing Shui Town could be heard in the conversation here. Xiao Liu was impressed with Xuan, opening this shop was a great idea!\u201cThat\u2019s nothing interesting. There is something even more major that happened in town!\u201d\u201cWhat? Do tell!\u201d\u201cLet me test you guys first. Other than Xuan Yuan, Gao Xing, and Sheng Nong, within the great wilderness what are the other powerful and famous clans?\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that? Below the Three Imperial Families, on the top of the pecking order are the Four Great Clans \u2013 the Chi Shui family, the Xi Ling family, the Tu Shan family, and the Gui Fang family. Other than the Four Great Clans, in the Middles Plans are the Six Big Families. And below the Six Big Families are various moderately powerful smaller clans such as the Jin Tian family to the South, the Fang Feng family to the North\u2026.. But none of them can compare to the Four Great Clans.\u201d\u201cThe Tu Shan clan is based in the city of Qing Qiu. From the dawn of time until now, every generation is in trade. Their businesses blanket every part of the great wilderness. They have so much money it\u2019s not even considered money. I hear even the imperial family of the Xuan Yuan and Sheng Nong kingdoms have borrowed money from the clan. It\u2019s genuinely wealth that can rival a kingdom. What I\u2019m going to say involves the Tu Shan clan.\u201d\u201cSo what of it? Hurry up and tell us!\u201d\u201cI have reliable intel that says the Tu Shan clan\u2019s Second Young Master is in Qing Shui Town!\u201d\u201cWhat? That can\u2019t be true.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of the Tu Shan clan\u2019s Second Young Master, he\u2019s definitely an impressive figure. This generation has only two sons, a pair of fraternal male twins born from the same mother and father. But I heard the Second Lord is very capable and since he was small he\u2019s been lording over the Eldest Lord. He makes all the decisions in the family.\u201d\u201cIn the entire great wilderness, no matter if it\u2019s Xuan Yuan or Gao Xing territories, their businesses extend there. Can you imagine how wealthy they must be? I hear this Second Lord is very handsome, talented in all the arts from music to painting to chess, a witty conversationalist and all-around scholar. His nickname is the Young Master of Qing Qiu. So many well-born families want to marry their daughter to him. The Tu Shan family matriarch selected carefully and finally picked the daughter of the Fang Feng family. I hear that daughter followed her father and brothers all around growing up, she\u2019s capable and very well traveled, as beautiful as a flower and can shoot a d.a.m.n fine arrow.\u201d\u201cThat Tu Shan eldest son is comparatively pathetic, he married a serving girl and can\u2019t even be compet.i.tion for the inheritance.\u201d\u201cNine years ago when the two families were about to hold the wedding ceremony, even the invitations had gone out, right before the wedding the Tu Shan family second son suddenly got sick and called off the wedding. All these years, the Second Lord has been hidden away healing while the Eldest Lord has been the one handling all the clan affairs.\u201d\u201cThat Miss Fang Feng is one loyal girl for sure, when her family wanted to call off the engagement, she dressed up in her wedding robes and ran to Qing Qiu and told Grand Madam Tu Shan \u201cBorn into Tu Shan house, buried in Tu Shan tomb.\u201d The Madam was so touched she was in tears, and all these years since Miss Fang Feng has lived at the Tu Shan residence helping the Madam with household matters.\u201d\u201cNow that the Fang Feng family has heard the Second Lord has recovered, the two families have resumed wedding preparations and want it to happen as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cHearing the Tu Shan Second Lord is here in Qing Shui town, likely he\u2019s getting ready to take over running the family business affairs.\u201dThe crowd started discussing about the upcoming inheritance battle between the Eldest Lord and the Second Lord, trying to guess who would emerge the victor.Xiao Liu was arranging the cashews on the plate, first into a flower, and then into a crescent moon.The person next to him was ramrod stiff, his hand tightly clenching a cashew until it had been reduced to powder.Xiao Liu drank his wine and teased \u201cHey, what is your name? When I see you later, I can\u2019t act like I don\u2019t know you but I can\u2019t call you s.h.i.+ Qi anymore! Even if you don\u2019t mind, your wife will likely shoot an arrow into me.\u201dAfter a few moments, s.h.i.+ Qi painfully said \u201cTu Shan Jing.\u201d\u201cTu Shan\u2026.how to write it?\u201d Jing splashed some wine and wrote his name for Xiao Liu who laughed and asked \u201cAnd what\u2019s the name of your soon-to-be wife?\u201dJing\u2019s hand froze above the table. Xiao Liu smiled \u201cSix years, I let you stay for six years. Give me six years without rent and then we won\u2019t owe each other anything!\u201d Xiao Liu got up to leave but Jing grabbed his arm. Xiao Liu jerked a few times but Jing never let go. Xiao Liu realized for the first time that the normally gentle Jing was actually quite strong and it was enough to subdue him.Xuan walked over with a laugh \u201cBrother Liu is leaving?\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cYes, you have your big business, I have my little medical clinic. If I\u2019m not leaving, shall I stay forever then? I can\u2019t help you with what you\u2019re doing.\u201dJing released his grip and Xiao Liu shook off his hand, handed money to Xuan, and walked out of the shop humming a ditty.The appearance of the Tu Shan family Second Lord caused Qing Shui Town to get even more lively as people jostled for opportunities and advancement. Everyone was discussing him. Even Butcher Gao lamented to Lao Mu that all the shops on the street belonged to the Tu Shan family. Chuan Zi and Tian Er didn\u2019t think anything of it since those people were like stars, so far above their reach. Lao Mu had his questions but one look at Xiao Liu\u2019s calm face and it relieved him. It can\u2019t be, it can\u2019t be s.h.i.+ Qi!Xiao Liu refused to go to the river banks anymore. He locked the doors to the courtyard and laid on the pallet to count the stars. \u201cThree thousand three hundred twenty seven\u2026\u2026..\u201dA white snowflake descended from the sky and Xiao Liu was so surprised happy but he quietly tamped down his smile and closed his eyes.Xiang Liu looked down at him from up high \u201cStop pretending to be asleep.\u201d Xiao Liu pressed his hands on his ears \u201cI\u2019m asleep, I can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d Xiang Liu waved his hand and a wild wind blew everything off the pallet. He sat down and stared at Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu felt two knives were sc.r.a.ping back and forth on his face. He endured, and endured, more enduring, until finally he couldn\u2019t anymore\u2026..he opened his eyes \u201cMy lord isn\u2019t busy in the mountains, what are you doing here in my little courtyard?\u201d\u201cThe man beside you, he\u2019s from the Tu Shan clan?\u201d\u201cWho? Ma Zi? Chaun Zi?\u201d Xiao Liu opened his eyes and asked sincerely. \u201cI wanted to be nicer to you but you always have way of making me want to bite down and wring your neck.\u201d Xiang Liu put both his hands around Xiao Liu\u2019s head and slowly lowered his head. Under the moonlight, his two teeth extended into fangs as sharp as any beast.Xiao Liu spoke \u201cYou\u2019re really more and more careless with your image. Last time it was the demon eyes, this time it\u2019s the beast fangs. I know you\u2019re a demon monster but knowing is different than seeing with my own eyes. You should know us people, whether be G.o.ds or humans, we like the outer image and we don\u2019t care about what\u2019s on the inside. Even what we eat we care about how it looks and smells. The wives we take must be pretty. Not like you demons, picking the plumpest fattest\u2026.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s fangs retreated and he patted Xiao Liu\u2019s cheek \u201cLately you\u2019ve been lonely?\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u201cPeople who are too smart are bound to die young. But you\u2019re not a person, you\u2019re a demon\u2026.so you\u2019ll die even faster!\u201d Xiang Liu grabbed Xiao Liu\u2019s neck and pressed in \u201cThat man, the one who you always hide every time I show up, is that Tu Shan clan\u2019s second son?\u201dXiao Liu thought and knew he wouldn\u2019t believe him if he said no \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Xiang Liu released him. Xiao Liu saw him smile and all his gooseb.u.mps came out. \u201cI\u2019m not close with him, if you want something you go see him yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m even less familiar with him. I\u2019m familiar with you.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cA demon\u2019s jokes are so not funny!\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cIt\u2019s been very hot lately and there is an illness spreading in the mountains and medicine is desperately needed. Have Tu Shan Jing get some medicine for us.\u201dXiao Liu sat up \u201cWhy? Who do you think you are?\u201d Xiang Liu smiled at Xiao Liu \u201cI\u2019m someone who can eat you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather you eat me then go find him.\u201dXiang Liu conjectured out loud \u201cDo you want to know what the eldest son of the Tu Shan clan is like? Nine years ago, he disappeared right before his wedding. If I contact the eldest son and asked him for some medicine and he asked me to kill a person, what are the odds that the Young Master of Qing Qiu can stay alive?\u201dXiao Liu spit out through gritted teeth \u201cNo wonder your name is number 1 on the list of Most Wanted. I really want to use your head to exchange for the reward money.\u201dXiang Liu laughed out loud and suddenly moved right in front of Xiao Liu\u2019s face and said slowly \u201cI have nine heads, remember to sharpen the knife very well.\u201d Xiao Liu glared at him, the two of them so close their breaths were mingling.After a moment Xiao Liu said \u201cIf he helped you, what good will that bring him.\u201d Xiang Liu slowly moved away from Xiao Liu \u201cWhen matters in the mountain isn\u2019t too busy, sometimes I\u2019m an a.s.sa.s.sin for hire, and a pretty notorious one at that. If the Tu Shan eldest son asked me to kill him, I would turn him down. If he wanted me to kill the Tu Shan eldest, I will accept the job.\u201d\u201cHe just went home, he might not be able to utilize the family money and manpower.\u201d\u201cYou underestimate him! Just a pallet of medicine, to him it\u2019s nothing. Tu Shan clan does any type of business. Back then, he sold way more dangerous items to the Sheng Nong army.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cThis time, why don\u2019t you buy it directly from the Tu Shan clan?\u201d Xiang Liu coldly replied \u201cNo money!\u201dXiao Liu wanted to laugh but didn\u2019t dare in case he made him angry. He raised his head to look at the stars \u201cYou are a demon, to help out the completely unrelated Sheng Nong, is it worth it?\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cYou can waste your time taking care of a bunch of losers. Why can\u2019t I waste my time doing pointless things?\u201d Xiao Liu smiled \u201cYou\u2019re right. In this long life, one has to find something to do. Fine, let\u2019s go see him.\u201dXiao Liu got up and walked out the door but Xiang Liu grabbed him back \u201cHe\u2019s by the riverbank.\u201d Xiao Liu walked to the riverbank with Xiang Liu following behind.Jing heard a sound and turned around with a look of joy, but immediately he saw a white figure behind Xiao Liu, proud and wild, completely untouched by the world. Xiang Liu walked to the river edge and looked out towards the distance.Xiao Liu walked up to Jing and felt a bit awkward. He coughed and asked \u201cHave you been well lately?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs Jing Ye well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLan\u2026.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s cold gaze glanced over and Xiao Liu hurriedly asked \u201cI have something to ask of you.\u201dJing replied \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI need a batch of medicine.\u201d Xiang Liu tossed over a tube, Xiao Liu caught it and handed it to Jing \u201cInside is the details.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201cWhen the medicine arrives in Qing Shui Town, contact me and Xiang Liu will go and retrieve it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis business was done just like that? So easy? Xiao Liu added \u201cI have no money to pay you, you know that right?\u201d Jing lowered his eyees \u201cYou. Don\u2019t need to pay.\u201d Xiao Liu didn\u2019t know what else to say so he looked towards Xiang Liu. He nodded so Xiao Liu told Jing \u201cThen\u2026.thank you. I\u2019m, I\u2019m done.\u201dJing started to walk away and when he pa.s.sed Xiao Liu his low voice carried in the wind \u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t say thank you.\u201dXiao Liu silently stood there for awhile and said to Xiang Liu \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep. You leave by yourself!\u201d Xiang Liu grabbed his collar and pulled him back \u201cBefore I get the medicine, you\u2019re with me.\u201dFurball landed and Xiao Liu jumped on the back of the condor and laughed like he didn\u2019t care \u201cFine. Recently I concocted new poison and I can test it out.\u201dFurball took them into the deep deep mountain. Xiao Liu closed his eyes and reminded Xiang Liu \u201cYou think about this again. I\u2019m afraid of pain, not loyal, willing to fold easily. If the Xuan Yuan army capture me in the future, I will tell them anything on the hint of torture.\u201dXiang Liu said nothing.Xiao Liu grabbed Furball\u2019s neck and fell asleep. When he was deep in sleep, he could feel Furball descending. Xiang Liu grabbed him off the condor \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Xiang Liu grabbed Xiang Liu\u2019s hand with his eyes still tightly shut \u201cI won\u2019t give you a reason to kill me in the future!\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s hand froze and Xiao Liu laughed slyly. Xiang Liu moved so fast that Xiao Liu could only cling on to his hand as he was dragged behind stumbling into the army base. Xiang Liu said \u201cWe\u2019re at the base. It\u2019s all houses so if you don\u2019t poke around then you won\u2019t be able to find the location of this place.\u201d Xiang Liu walked into a wooden shack and Xiao Liu followed. It was threadbare with a narrow pallet, some animal skin rugs on the ground, and a wooden chest at the end of the pallet for putting clothes. A table was on top of the rug with a tea set on it as well as writing instruments.As one of the leaders of the rebel army yet his living situation was so paltry. Xiao Liu silently sighed having really no idea what that nine-headed demon was hoping to gain from all this. It was dark out and Xiang Liu naturally slept on the pallet while Xiao Liu wrapped himself in a blanket and curled up on the rug to sleep.Morning time, Xiang Liu left so Xiao Liu climbed on the pallet and kept on sleeping. There was the sound of organized chants and hollers from outside, initially it was interesting but after some time Xiao Liu wished he were deaf. Day after day, year after year, these repet.i.tive army exercises were boring but needed to keep the blade sharp and morale high. But was their determination worth it? The soldiers wanted to protect their homeland, to protect their people, but they were now hiding in the mountains without either a homeland or people to protect.Xiao Liu was suddenly rather impressed with Xiang Liu. Demons were by nature wild and untamed, refusing to follow rules and authority, and definitely no desire for status. But Xiang Liu reined in his rebellious streak to live a mundane daily life doing what might be something he utterly despised. When Xiang Liu finished training the soldiers, he returned to the hut.Xiao Liu sat in front of the table tending to himself. Inside the tea cannister was something strange but Xiao Liu just mumbled about life and tossed it into the tea pot to brew something that looked like tea. Xiang Liu sat on the rug and leaned against the pallet as if waiting to laugh at Xiao Liu. To his surprise, Xiao Liu took one sip, squinted his face briefly, before resuming and finis.h.i.+ng the entire cup of tea.Xiang Liu said \u201cI now believe that you were forced to eat lots of strange disgusting things.\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cI never lie. I just like saying a lot of c.r.a.p.\u201dXiang Liu added \u201cWhen I finished the tea, I tossed into the cannister the scent ball used to ward off bugs. I heard it\u2019s the p.o.o.p of some strange beast.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s face changed color but he forced himself to remain placid. Xiang Liu softly chuckled, a genuine sound of mirth. Xiao Liu looked at how his cold handsome eyes seemed to melt like the Spring water and Xiao Liu wanted to freeze this moment.The soldier reported from outside \u201cGeneral Xiang Liu, two more soldiers died.\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s laughter stopped and he immediately stood up and walked out. Xiao Liu hesitated and walked to the door. There were two bodies on top of a pyre. Xiang Liu walked over where there were hundreds of soldiers lined up. He poured three cups of wine and then lit the pyre. Within the flames of the fire, the faces of the men showed their familiarity with death, but in the mournful sounds of the song they sang it conveyed their deep sorrow. Their singing wasn\u2019t in unison, flitting in and out, as they wondered about their cause and what it all meant in the long run.It was true that the Yellow Emperor forcibly took over the lands of Sheng Nong. But the Sheng Nong Kingdom was now no more and the people living there only wanted a peaceful life to live. They don\u2019t care who is the Emperor, and had even begun to speak warmly of the Yellow Emperor\u2019s intelligence and generosity. The people don\u2019t care about the remaining Sheng Nong soldiers who refuse to surrender. Thousands of years later, their determination won\u2019t be remembered.Only by giving up, bowing low, could they get a sweet wife, a cute kid, perhaps even the wealth given by the Emperor. But they still persisted to cling on to their belief, to hold onto something most people no longer cared about, to risk their lives for it.The wheels of history were already turning but they remained stubbornly rooted in place, with their arms outstretched trying to turn the wheels back. But they were people that time has forgotten, they are going against the tide, and they were destined to be obliterated. Xiao Liu knew they were foolish, and felt pity for them, but he also couldn\u2019t help but feel respect towards them.In this moment, Xiao Liu suddenly realized why his last mocking question to Xiang Liu about why he worked for Gong Gong doing pointless things, to suggest that he betray Gong Gong and throw his lot with the Yellow Emperor, that question would cause Xiang Liu to fly into a dark rage. In this world, there was a determination that may be destroyed, may be annihilated, but can never be mocked!Xiang Liu slowly walked back with the sorrowful song lingering behind him. Xiao Liu leaned against the door and watched him walk in the blood red sunset, his white hair and white robe still pristine and untouched. Xiang Liu stopped in front of Xiao Liu, his cold gaze containing a measure of disdain, but it wasn\u2019t clear if it was meant for the world or for himself.Xiao Liu suddenly bowed \u201cI wanted to apologize for what I said last time.\u201d Xiang Liu was expressionless as he entered the house \u201cIf the medicine comes sooner, they can live a bit longer. They are warriors, if they are to die, it ought to be in front of the Yellow Emperor\u2019s army.\u201dXiao Liu silently sat in the corner and genuinely started to pray that Jing would hurry up with the medicine. Two days later, Xiang Liu took Xiao Liu back to Qing Shui Town. Jing stood by the river and stared as Xiang Liu and Xiao Liu arrived together on the back of the white condor. Xiao Liu jumped off the condor and anxiously asked \u201cThe medicine is here? Where?\u201dJing looked at Xiang Liu \u201cThe medicine the General wants is all ready. It\u2019s in the bas.e.m.e.nt of the fourth house on Dong Liu street. General can dispatch someone to retrieve it.\u201d Xiang Liu nodded and the condor rose into the sky. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t want to face Jing so raised his head to look at Xiang Liu. His eyes remained on him until he disappeared into the clouds.After Xiang Liu left, Xiao Liu still didn\u2019t know what to say to Jing so he continued staring into the sky with a look of longing. After his neck was sore, Xiao Liu finally looked down and turned with a smile to Jing. He was still wearing that old sack cloth robe from before. Xiao Liu coughed twice \u201cWas it difficult to get the medicine?\u201d Jing shook his head. Xiao Liu asked \u201cWhen do you leave Qing Shui Town?\u201d\u201cNot leaving.\u201d His gaze towards Xiao Liu was filled with tenderness. Xiao Liu laughed with his head c.o.c.ked \u201cSo your fiancee will be coming here then?\u201d Jing lowered his head and tightly clenched his lips. Xiao Liu said \u201cI\u2019m going back\u201d and walked past him quickly through the herb garden not caring how many plants were squashed underfoot. Xiao Liu took a deep breath and pushed open the door and hollered \u201cI, Wen Xiao Liu, is back!\u201dIn the middle of the night, when Xiao Liu was fast sleep, he suddenly startled awake. Xiang Liu was standing next to his pallet, still white hair white robe, but his hair was slightly mussed and his white robe slightly dirty.\u201cYou\u2019re injured again?\u201d Xiao Liu sighed, sitting up and pulling down his collar. Xiang Liu didn\u2019t bother with niceties, pulling Xiao Liu close and biting down to drink his blood. Xiao Liu laughed \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have a wonder medicine chest like me. But your\u2026.\u201d Xiao Liu suddenly realized \u201cDid you get the medicine? Did someone sneak attack you?\u201dXiang Liu raised his head \u201cNo, someone from the Tu Shan clan leaked the location where the medicine was hidden.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t be Tu Shan Jing.\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s not him.\u201d \u201cThen who is it?\u201d \u201cHow would I know? You should go ask him!\u201d \u201cDo you know who stole the medicine?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHow come you don\u2019t know anything?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same group that injured me last time. They arrive very fast, leave very fast, I worry there is a traitor in the mountains but still haven\u2019t discovered any proof.\u201dXiao Liu smacked his own head and wanted to sigh to the Heavens \u201cWhy such a crowd!\u201dXiang Liu was much too smart and immediately asked \u201cYou know who it is?\u201d Xiao Liu smiled wanly \u201cYou first let me think.\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s hands went around his throat \u201cThis concerns the lives of thousands of soldiers, it\u2019s not one of your loneliness dispelling games!\u201dXiao Liu thought and made up his mind \u201cIt\u2019s Xuan who runs the wine shop.\u201d Xiang Liu let him go and was about to leave when Xiao Liu grabbed him tightly \u201cYou can\u2019t s.n.a.t.c.h, he has a lot of subordinates. Plus he ought to have close ties with the Tu Shan clan. If this gets big, the Tu Shan clan will side with him.\u201d Xiang Liu tossed his hand aside and Xiao Liu added \u201cI have a way to avoid bloodshed and get the medicine back.\u201dXiang Liu stopped and turned around. Xiao Liu jumped off the pallet and pulled on a robe \u201cXuan has a little sister cousin called Ah Nian. Xuan\u2019s very smart and also very protective of this little sister. It\u2019s hard to one up Xuan, but it\u2019s easy to capture Ah Nian. Use Ah Nian to exchange for the medicine. When we get the medicine back, Xuan gets his sister back. No one will need to fight.\u201dXiang Liu thought about it \u201cFine.\u201d The two walked out and Xiao Liu said \u201cYou go distract Xuan and I\u2019ll go capture Ah Nian.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of men and can only give you four.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be giving me all the men you\u2019ve got? You\u2019re injured so keep two. Xuan isn\u2019t easy to deal with.\u201dXiang Liu ignored him and vaulted on Furball. Four masked men on winged rides appeared and Xiang Liu ordered them \u201cUntil I get back, listen to his orders.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d The four men lined up and one flew down to pick Xiao Liu up before they all flew up into the clouds. Xiang Liu left on Furball and Xiao Liu called out \u201cNine-headed demon, don\u2019t die!\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear whether Xiang Liu heard it but soon he was gone from sight.Xiao Liu looked at the four men with masks on but all showing determined eyes looking at him. \u201cAre you familiar with this area?\u201d \u201cVery familiar.\u201d Xiao Liu gestured and made plans \u201cUnderstood?\u201d \u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cGood, then see you guys in a bit.\u201dXiao Liu went to the back entrance to the wine shop and knocked loudly \u201cBrother Xuan, Brother Xuan\u2026.\u201d knowing full well he wasn\u2019t there but wanting to wake the people inside. Hai Tang walked out \u201cMiddle of the night, what do you want?\u201d Xiao Liu rudely scoffed \u201cScram to the side, I\u2019m looking for Brother Xuan, not you.\u201d Hai Tang was furious but as a maid she couldn\u2019t say anything, but Ah Nian could and she walked out \u201cLowlife! If you don\u2019t scram then I\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201d\u201cYou want to teach me a lesson? How about I teach you a lesson! If it wasn\u2019t on account of Brother Xuan, I would have slapped you a dozen times already. You stupid b.i.t.c.h, ugly wench, born with a pair of eyes like a dead fish.\u201dAh Nian had never been so insulted in her entire life and she was quaking with rage \u201cHai Tang, kill him. Kill him and if Xuan gege gets mad, I\u2019ll take all the blame.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Hai Tang immediately sprang into action so Xiao Liu turned and ran \u201cI\u2019m giving Brother Xuan face. If you dare then come outside. Ah Nian, if you have the b.a.l.l.s then don\u2019t ask your maid to do your dirty work.\u201d\u201cThis is preposterous!\u201d Ah Nian ran after Xiao Liu \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d Xiao Liu hurled insults and Ah Nian chased after him. Xiao Liu ran through the list of all the dirty insults he heard in the marketplace and Ah Nian was so angry she was about to go crazy. She didn\u2019t even realize that the Hai Tang behind her was already pa.s.sed out and a masked man had taken her away.Xiao Liu lured Ah Nian to a desolate place but by the time Ah Nian realized something was off and called for Hai Tang, no one responded. She at least had some guts and wasn\u2019t scared, only waving her hands and water blades sliced towards Xiao Liu. One masked man blocked it for Xiao Liu. Three against one, it was an easy victory! Ah Nian was trussed up nice and secure and placed on a winged ride. Ah Nian cursed them the entire way to meet up with Xiang Liu.Arriving in the mountains, Hai Tang was laying on the ground while the four masked men spread out to keep watch. Xiao Liu picked up Ah Nian who started cursing \u201cLet me go, let me go otherwise I\u2019ll cut off your hands!\u201d Xiao Liu dropped Ah Nian and with a splat she landed on the ground. Ah Nian yelled \u201cHow dare you drop me!\u201d Xiao Liu countered \u201cYou told me to let go.\u201d Ah Nian yelled \u201cWho told you to carry me?\u201d \u201cBecause you were tied up, if I don\u2019t carry you, should I toss you?\u201d Ah Nian was so furious she couldn\u2019t speak.Xiao Liu knelt down with a laugh \u201cA high born lady like you, probably ever been tied up before. How does it feel?\u201d Ah Nian really wasn\u2019t scared and looked at Xiao Liu liked he was a dead man walking \u201cYou are just digging your own grave.\u201d Xiao Liu was more and more impressed with Ah Nian\u2019s parents \u201cGirlie, look around, you\u2019re the one tied up.\u201d Ah Nian coldly laughed \u201cMy older brother cousin will soon find me. He will be very very angry. You will die a very very painful death!\u201dXiao Liu put his hands under his chin and looked at the rare species that is Ah Nian \u201cYou have that much faith in your cousin?\u201d\u201cOf course. Fa\u2026..father never compliments anyone but he complimented him.\u201d\u201cYour parents love you very much?\u201d \u201cOf course my parents love me!\u201d \u201cEveryone around you treat you well?\u201d \u201cOf course, how could anyone not treat me well?\u201dXiao Liu finally understood what made Ah Nian like a rare species. In her world, everything revolved around her. She asked and it will be given. In Ah Nian\u2019s world, there was no hards.h.i.+p, no darkness. Remembering the way Xuan treated Ah Nian, Xiao Liu suddenly felt jealous of Ah Nian. She might be very spoiled but if you ask any girl, every girl wanted to be pampered to the point she was cluelessly self-absorbed and brashly rude. How much love did that need, how many people to love her did that take, to create a world for Ah Nian that was filled with only rainbows and flowers and happiness so that she ended up with this personality.If a person could have everything go their way, who would choose to endure suffering? Who wanted to taste the pain of this world? Who would want to see the true darkness within people\u2019s soul? Xiao Liu sat down on the ground and softly asked \u201cAh Nian, what are your parents like?\u201dAh Nian glared at Xiao Liu and didn\u2019t want to answer but couldn\u2019t control her pride \u201cMy father is the world\u2019s most handsome, most powerful man.\u201d Xiao Liu teased her \u201cThen your cousin?\u201d \u201cMy cousin is as well.\u201d \u201cBoth of them are? Who\u2019s better?\u201d \u201cYou moron! My father is the past, my cousin is the future!\u201d\u201cWhat does your dad do with you normally?\u201d Xiao Liu had no dad so he was curious what dads did with daughters. Before Ah Nian could answer, Xiang Liu came back. Xiang Liu was wearing a white mask and dropped from the sky with his immaculate white hair and white robe like an ethereal snowflake from another world. The men went up to make a report and then left with Hai Tang after getting orders.Ah Nian curiously stared at Xiang Liu and was so fixated she forgot to be angry. Xiao Liu chuckled \u201cDo you want to know the face under that mask? It\u2019s comparable to your cousin!\u201d Ah Nian blushed \u201cHumph, who cares!\u201d She immediately closed her eyes to indicate that she wasn\u2019t going to look or speak to such pathetic lowly people.Xiang Liu sat down next to a tree with his eyes closed to regain strength. Xiao Liu walked over \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDo you want to heal?\u201d \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like when I\u2019m healing, it\u2019ll have to wait until this is finished.\u201d\u201cWhen Xuan gives the medicine to your men, I\u2019ll take Ah Nian back and you go find a place to heal.\u201dXiang Liu opened his eyes \u201cDo you know Xuan\u2019s real ident.i.ty?\u201d Xiao Liu shook his head \u201cHis earthly aura is too strong, not like one of the scions of the n.o.ble or powerful families. But he\u2019s very connected which means he has a lot of money which is hard to do if he\u2019s not from a powerful family.\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cI\u2019ve got a good guess.\u201d \u201cWho is he?\u201d \u201cI need a bit more proof first.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s the person I think he really is, then you\u2019re in deep trouble.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat person is very protective of what is close to him. He loathes anyone harming his family. You kidnapped his sister which is his biggest no-no. He will undoubtedly kill you. It\u2019s my fault this time, until I destroy him you can stay by my side.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cI do! Even the big demon thinks I\u2019m in danger so it\u2019s definitely dangerous. But do you think I\u2019m the type to hide behind another\u2019s back until the trouble pa.s.ses?\u201d Xiang Liu smiled broadly \u201cFine! But\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d he lightly choked Xiao Liu\u2019s neck \u201cReally don\u2019t die!\u201dFurball\u2019s projection came flying down and chirped to Xiang Liu who pat it a few times on the head \u201cThe medicine has been received and the men safely away.\u201d Xiao Liu stood up and stretched \u201cI\u2019ll take her back. With this parting, the rivers are long and the mountains are wide. If there is next time, and if there isn\u2019t next time, then don\u2019t miss me.\u201d Xiang Liu smiled \u201cWhat I miss is your blood, not your person.\u201dXiao Liu guffawed and went to pull Ah Nian up and drag her off amid her curses. As Xiao Liu walked, he thought about how to deal with Xuan. He went through each and every detail about Xuan and realized that he couldn\u2019t figure the man out.That man wore a complete and utter mask. People who wore masks, you can tell it\u2019s a mask. But his mask appeared to be a part of him, completely natural and effortless. Lao Mu, Chuan Zi, Ma Zi, Butcher Gao, they all like him since he\u2019s easy to talk to. Tian Er and Chun Tao like him because he\u2019s handsome and amusing. Xiao Liu thought about it and realized he also like Xuan for being smart and handled things well. But in truth, Xuan\u2019s real personality, what he liked, how he did things\u2026\u2026Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t suss it out. All he knows is that Xuan\u2019s weakness is protecting those close to him. No matter what his cousin did, he asked others to let it go and was even willing to apologize so his sister cousin didn\u2019t need to apologize.Xiao Liu suddenly wondered to herself \u2013 how could there be a guy like him in this world. What did he live through so that his personality was so odd. Xiao Liu said to Ah Nian \u201cI\u2019m beginning to be a little scared of your cousin.\u201d Ah Nian saucily replied \u201cIt\u2019s too late to figure it out now!\u201dXiao Liu looked at Ah Nian with a smile and she felt a s.h.i.+ver go through her \u201cWhat\u2026.what do you want?\u201dXiao Liu put Ah Nian on the ground and shoved three pills and a packet of powder in her mouth and forced her mouth closed until she swallowed. \u201cYou\u2026.you\u2026.what did you made me eat?\u201d \u201cPoison. You carry a poison-warding amulet but I don\u2019t believe you have such an amulet in your belly.\u201dXiao Liu took Ah Nian\u2019s hair pin off and spread some powder on it and p.r.i.c.ked her twice on the wrist. Ah Nuan\u2019s tears fell as she had never been so mistreated in her entire life as today. Xiao Liu added \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe your blood can ward off poison.\u201dXiao Liu thought some more and put another powder on the hair pin before touching Ah Nian\u2019s back with his hand \u201cFor insurance let\u2019s put another poison. Your spiritual power is of the water type ice skill, right? I\u2019ve got to find the right pressure point.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s hand touched from left to right all over Ah Nian\u2019s back until her waist. She was still a young girl and had never been touched by a man before. This was the first time she was scared in her entire life and she cried \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dXiao Liu was unmoved and found the spot on her back and p.r.i.c.ked her. It didn\u2019t hurt but Ah Nian felt like death. If she could, she would cut Xiao Liu\u2019s hand off and cut her own back skin off. Xiao Liu put the hair pin back in Ah Nian\u2019s hair and fixed her clothes \u201cCome on, your cousin wants me dead, I\u2019ll take you down with me.\u201d Ah Nian was sobbing and refused to move. Xiao Liu put his head in front of her \u201cDo you want me to look for a pressure point on your chest?\u201d Ah Nian started wailing loudly but started moving behind Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu listened to her loud cries and wondered if he really was too evil this time, making a young girl cry like that. Before he could reach a conclusion, a group of people arrived led by Xuan.\u201cGege\u2014\u2014\u201d Ah Nian rushed into Xuan\u2019s arms and started wailing. Xiao Liu was surrounded by masked men but Xuan paid him no heed and only gently patted Ah Nian on the back and comforted her. Ah Nian was crying so hard she couldn\u2019t speak and her face was all red. After some time, her sobs lessened and she was able to answer Xuan\u2019s questions. When she told him about being poisoned and where Xiao Liu p.r.i.c.ked her, Ah Nian started crying again and refused to answer his questions. Even if she didn\u2019t answer her tears said enough.Xuan\u2019s razor sharp eyes glanced over Xiao Liu who brushed the gooseb.u.mps off his arms and tried to maintain a placid smile. Xuan took Ah Nian away while Xiao Liu was knocked unconscious and also taken away.When Xiao Liu woke up, he was in a sealed room without any light other than two oil lamps on the wall. Two masked men came in explaining they were under orders to keep him alive, but the rest was fine. The decided on his hands so he couldn\u2019t poison others. They took out a torture device which was a rectangular stone box like a little coffin but with an opening on top.The men smeared oil on Xiao Liu\u2019s hand and put his hand in the box. Inside the box was dirt and once the oil smell hit little bugs burrowed towards his fingers. The men shoved a cloth in his mouth and tied it.\u201cInside the box are flesh eating bugs. The oil is smeared on dead corpses for burial. This will signal to them your hands are dead flesh to be eaten. They will slowly burrow into your fingers and you will feel your flesh being eaten. The fingers are tied to the heart and it\u2019s so painful that people will try to gnaw off their own hands to end the pain. So that is why we have to seal your mouth shut. Five days later when the box is opened, you will see two sets of finger bones as clean as white porcelain. We\u2019re turning off all the light so that in the dark you can feel the pain more. Last time we did this, the person went insane. We hope you won\u2019t go crazy.\u201dBefore the light disappeared completely, Xiao Liu opened his eyes wide. He knew the men were right, the only way not to go crazy was to stay awake. Xiao Liu felt the pain in the fingertips, like a bug burrowing into his body and gnawing on his heart.Xiao Liu started talking to himself, whatever he remembered he would say out loud. In the painful darkness, the images appeared strangely clear.The fire red phoenix flower was blooming overhead and the swing was hung on the phoenix tree. She liked to swing on the swing but her older brother cousin liked to practice his power training. She loved to tease him \u201cGege, gege, look how high I\u2019m swinging\u2026..\u201d He never acknowledged her but if she accidentally fell down then he would always catch her in time.In the verdant green forest she liked to play hide-and-seek. Seeing Gege coming to find her, she would jump on his back when he wasn\u2019t looking and laugh. She would refuse to get off so that he would piggyback her home. When Mom saw them she would sigh and shake her head. But Grandmother would point out that Mom was the same when she was a kid.She would play tug of war with Gege and the loser would have their nose sc.r.a.ped. When she won she would sc.r.a.pe really really hard, but when she lost, she would softly plead \u201cGege, Gege, not too hard!\u201d Gege would raise his hand and come down hard, but the moment his hand touched it was whisper soft.The red-robed Uncle gave her a cut off white fox tail to play with. She loved it and so did Gege, but she would only allow him to play with it for a short while. But each time there needed to be a trade, Gege needed to steal some snacks for her. One time she ate too many and had an upset stomach and Mom angrily scolded her. But she felt wronged and told Gege \u201cYou learn how to make that snack, so that I can eat as much as I want and Mom and Grandmother won\u2019t have a say!\u201d Gege agreed and actually learned to make the snack but refused to make any for her. All he said was \u201cwhen you grow up and won\u2019t have a stomachache when you eat it, then I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201dGrandmother\u2019s health deteriorated and Mom was always by her side and couldn\u2019t take care of her and Gege. People said that Uncle and Auntie died, and that Grandmother would die soon. She was so scared and at night she secretly climbed into bed with Gege and softly asked \u201cWhat is death?\u201d Gege answered \u201cDeath is never being able to see someone again\u201d\u201cAnd can\u2019t talk to that person again?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cLike you can\u2019t see your mom and dad again?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cIs Grandmother going to die?\u201d Gege embraced her tightly and his tears fell on her face. She hugged him back tightly \u201cI will never die, and I will always talk to you.\u201dEveryone said that Gege was very strong inside, even Grandfather thought Gege never cried. But she knew Gege cried, but she never told Mom. She often snuck into Gege\u2019s bed at night to keep him company. Even if the next day she got scolded that she was too old now and needed to learn to sleep alone. She can\u2019t go bother Gege and disturb his rest. She said nothing and accepted the scolding, but every night she would sneak out to go find Gege.During the day Gege would study hard but only she knew that at night Gege would wake up and curl into a ball and s.h.i.+ver. She knew that he was seeing the image of his own mother committing suicide. She would hold Gege like cradling a doll, lightly patting him and humming the same song that Mom and Auntie would sing. Tears would fall from Gege\u2019s eyes and one time she tasted it and learned it was salty and bitter.One time Gege had a nightmare and tried to hold back his tears. She grabbed him and yelled \u201cGege, cry! You need to cry!\u201d Gege asked her \u201cThey all want me to not cry, why do you want me to cry? Don\u2019t you know that I shouldn\u2019t cry?\u201d She tweaked her nose \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say. All I know is that your heart hurts and tears can help the pain flow out of your body. Once the pain flows out, the heart can slowly heal.\u201dThe night before she left for Jade Mountain, Gege asked to sleep with her. She was sleeping all drowsy when she felt Gege embrace her and tears fell on her face. She thought he had a nightmare and was about to pat him \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here with you.\u201d Gege instead kept repeating \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too useless. I will hurry up and grow up. I will protect you and Auntie. I will go bring you back\u2026.\u201dIn the darkness the time pa.s.sed but Xiao Liu only spoke to himself but sometimes there was so much pain he forgot what he was saying. But every time he used his incredible willpower to keep on talking to himself. Who knows how much time pa.s.sed but Xiao Liu was talking about how to grill fish various ways when the door opened and a light shone in. Being in the darkness for so long, the light hurt so Xiao Liu closed his eyes.\u201cHis expression\u2026.is different than any I\u2019ve seen before.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s very unique.\u201dThe two jailers opened the box and untied him. Once they started tending to his hand, Xiao Liu moaned in pain, and in his consciousness he appeared to hear s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s voice. That snapped the taut string in his mind and he fainted dead away.When Xiao Liu opened his eyes, it was still dark but he was wearing clean clothes and laying on a soft pallet. Someone sat next to him but he didn\u2019t believe his eyes 's.h.i.+ Qi? Jing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cWindow\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi immediately got up and opened the window. The mountain breeze came in and Xiao Liu took a deep breath. Jing lit a lamp and helped Xiao Liu up. Xiao Liu looked at his hands which were wrapped like two b.a.l.l.s, indicating the injuries were severe but with the medicine applied there wasn\u2019t much pain. Jing brought a bowl of soup over and Xiao Liu was starving but forced himself to drink slowly. After eating, Jing took out a pill and told Xiao Liu to suck on it. Xiao Liu sucked on the pill and looked around. It was a simple wooden hut with some rugs on the ground and seemed familiar.\u201cWe\u2019re at the Sheng Nong army base?\u201d\u201cI went to find General Xiang Liu to help save you. Xiang Liu took men to attack Xuan while I went to the cellar prison to rescue you.\u201d From contacting Xiang Liu to planning the rescue, Jing explained it in a few scant words.Xiao Liu said \u201cActually, you didn\u2019t need to come save me.\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019m going back to Qing Shui Town so give me the antidote for Ah Nian.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cShe wasn\u2019t even poisoned! Ah Nian, with her background, of course she found the best doctors and can cure any poison so I decided to just pull a fast one on her. Everyone around her is so protective of her. They will be looking for the poison and if they can\u2019t find it, they will keep me alive.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d Jing looked at his hands and in his eyes was unspoken pain. Xiao Liu \u201cThat\u2026. fooling them will only temporarily save my life. So even if I didn\u2019t poison Ah Nian\u2026.I poisoned Xuan.\u201dJing stared in shock at Xiao Liu.\u201cThe poison was placed on Ah Nian\u2019s body, I know Xuan would hug her, comfort her, and the poison would enter his body. Once it went into the blood stream, it\u2019s very hard to remove. With Ah Nian\u2019s personality, she must be crying these last few days and needing Xuan to comfort her often. He would never suspect it was aimed at him.\u201d\u201cWhat poison did you give him?\u201dXiao Liu cautiously explained \u201cActually, it\u2019s not really a poison, it\u2019s best described as voodoo. The voodoo magic is practiced by the Jiu Li tribe and is their secret learning. A few hundred years ago, the Jiu Li tribe had a voodoo king who was called the poison master of the great wilderness. The voodoo magic is considered evil stacked against mainstream medicine and poisons. People have heard of it but very few actually understand it.\u201dXiao Liu explained \u201cIn truth, I raised a voodoo bug inside of my body, and that bug is now in Xuan\u2019s body. From now on, when my body hurts, his body will also experience the same pain.\u201d\u201cThat voodoo bug, must not have been easy to raise.\u201d\u201cOf course! Very hard to raise!\u201d If it was easy to raise this magic would be all over the great wilderness. Even with Xiao Liu\u2019s special body, it still took him years to raise it.\u201cWhy raise a voodoo bug?\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u201cIt was all to control Xiang Liu that big demon! He is a nine-headed monster and not a single poison can take him down. So I thought of this great plan but before I had a chance to plant it in him, I ended up using it on Xuan.\u201d Beasts are very instinctive and Xiao Liu was worried Xiang Liu would cotton on to the voodoo bug, He was so compliant when he needed to drink his blood so that one day the voodoo bug would unwittingly be planted into Xiang Liu\u2019s body.Jing asked \u201cIs the voodoo bug harmful to the body?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cYou certain?\u201d\u201cYes, with my life I promise!\u201dJing wasn\u2019t so sure but he didn\u2019t know enough about voodoo bugs so he would need to consult a doctor later. Xiao Liu asked \u201cHow many days since I was captured?\u201d \u201cFour.\u201dXiao Liu looked down at his hands, thinking perhaps its time not to apply medicine. \u201cThe time is almost ready.\u201d\u201cXiao Liu, let me handle Xuan\u2026..\u201dXiao Liu looked up at Jing \u201cXiang Liu already knew Xuan would deal with me viciously. He offered to let me stay by his side by I turned him down. If I\u2019m the type to hide behind someone stronger, then I wouldn\u2019t have let you stay many years ago. I am used to being independent \u2013 I do what I want and handle my own problems.\u201dJing\u2019s eyes were filled with care \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be alone.\u201dXiao Liu coldly turned his head \u201cI saved you once, you saved me once. I fed you once, you fed me once. We don\u2019t owe each other anymore. My situation doesn\u2019t need your help!\u201d Jing silently sat there for some time and then quietly walked out.Xiao Liu wanted to sleep but couldn\u2019t so he struggled off the bed and walked out the door. This wasn\u2019t in the army base but a hunter\u2019s lodge in the mountains. It was the only residence in the entire cliff, which makes sense because if Xiang Liu was helping Jing save someone, he would use his own power and not tap into the Sheng Nong army.The winds were howling and the clouds were below his feet. Xiao Liu stared for some time and it felt like the clouds would rise up and consume him. He couldn\u2019t help but call out \u201cXiang Liu, are you there?\u201dA bird called from behind and Xiao Liu turned around to see Xiang Liu sitting on the tree next to the hut. Under the silver moonlight, with his white hair white robe, he was like a person made of snow, so pristine so perfect, it made one want to get close but afraid to.Xiao Liu stared and then suddenly asked \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201dXiang Liu lightly answered \u201cLong enough to hear that you wanted to plant a voodoo bug in me.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s face changed color \u2013 speaking with Jing, he never tried to play word games so he was just careless earlier and forgot that he was on Xiang Liu\u2019s territory. Xiao Liu laughed \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do it, I planted it in Xuan.\u201dXiang Liu came down and stared at Xiao Liu like a predator looking at prey. \u201cIf you hurt, he hurts? When will the voodoo bug start working?\u201d Xiao Liu immediately took a step back afraid that Xiang Liu would strike \u201cThe time isn\u2019t here yet, but with the voodoo bug planted he won\u2019t get off easy.\u201dXiang Liu stared out over the clouds \u201cFirst you insult his cousin, then plant a voodoo bug on him. He will not let you live. I hope your bug is impossible to remove so that he is wary of you.\u201d\u201cThat voodoo bug was prepared for you, I\u2019m the only one in this world who can remove it.\u201dXiang Liu closed his eyes \u201cGo back to sleep and hurry up and heal your hand.\u201dXiao Liu was too scared to talk back and went back to sleep even if he couldn\u2019t fall asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYou can sense that Xiao Liu\u2019s time being Xiao Liu is slowly coming to an end. Lost You Forever tells its story in years, tens of years, hundreds of years, since the leads are all mystical G.o.ds and demons and beings of magical spiritual powers. Because they seem to have it all, it makes it even more painful to see how they suffer more than a human would. The torture inflicted on s.h.i.+ Qi is beyond the pale, years of degradation at the hands of his own brother. Xiao Liu may get bitten and tossed around by Xiang Liu, and we can all argue that she kinda likes it and eggs him on at times, watching her get tortured by orders of Xuan in the last chapter was totally heartbreaking. Tong Hua delivers her giant hammers of pain and doom in ways that feel lyrical because so much is left unsaid. We know Xiao Liu is getting her hands gnawed on but we are with her as she relives the happiest times of her life in her memory. Her childhood happiness with her older brother cousin, a time that is probably so long ago for Xiao Liu, but that is the only true happiness she has ever known in a life that was born into greatness and then thrust into danger. When I read Tong Hua\u2019s novels, I really allow myself the freedom of mind not to pa.s.s judgment on characters right off the bat. She always has a way of fles.h.i.+ng everything out throughout her story so that the my final opinion ends up being so very different than my initial impression. Her writing teaches me patience and an appreciation for story flow beyond what is shown. I love the way she allows her characters to expression emotions by the tiniest of details, or nothing at all but a meaning hidden between the lines. s.h.i.+ Qi is as straightforward as it gets for a leading man, his goodness without reservation. Xiang Liu is the opposite, even if he is nice to Xiao Liu you can tell he won\u2019t ever let her think it. This chapter is equal parts action-packed battle scene and quiet contemplation between two people who are both so close yet still so far away from each other.Chapter 6 \u2013 Like a Familiar Person Has Come:Xiao Liu\u2019s body was very unique so wounds healed faster than most. Jing also left a lot of good medicine ranging from the bones and elixirs from Jade Mountain, harnessed crystal, whatever was in the vast wilderness that was precious it was here. Xiao Liu\u2019s injuries healed quickly.Xiao Liu never hesitated or was shy about using anything, dumping the entire jar of bone essence to soak his hand in. But the only thing he never used was painkillers. Everyday he loudly howled in pain and jumped up and down. Xiang Liu initially just coldly stared, but later he was so annoyed by the noise that he snarked \u201cI am pitying the person who tortured you. They gave you the flesh eating bug torture, you gave them the blood curdling noise torture.\u201dXiao Liu pouted towards him \u201cI really regret giving the voodoo bug to Xuan now.\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cEven if you raised a bug, you ought to raise a more vicious one. This bug you raised requires you to first harm yourself. Thank G.o.d you planted the other in Xuan where it might have some use. If you planted it in me, remember that I\u2019ve got nine-heads. Even if you died from the pain, it likely wouldn\u2019t hurt me much.\u201dXiao Liu felt talking to Xiang Liu was just making himself angrier so huffed off and went to hide in the clouds. The days pa.s.sed and the pain decreased and Xiao Liu\u2019s hand gradually recovered.At dawn when Xiao Liu was still fast asleep, he suddenly felt a stirring in his body. Initially he didn\u2019t understand but gradually he figured it out \u2013 the bug was sending him a message. Xiao Liu quickly got up and rushed out of the hut \u201cXiang Liu, Xuan\u2026..\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThere were more then ten masked men standing on the mountain top. Each man and their winged rides were all huffing with deadly intent and braced for battle. Clearly they knew Xuan was close, and seeing the way they fanned out, Xuan was bringing a lot of people.Xiang Liu said to Xiao Liu \u201cXuan\u2019s coming with murderous rage. I\u2019m ready to kill him so tonight it\u2019s a battle to the death. You find a place to hide safely.\u201d Because he was wearing a mask, Xiang Liu\u2019s face was covered and only his eyes was revealed, and it was so cold without a shred of warmth. Xiao Liu was too scared to bulls.h.i.+t, looked around a few times, then darted underneath a big rock crevice.A little while later, Xiao Liu saw Xuan leading a group of men swooping down. Over three dozen men on various winged rides, with their wings spread blanketing the entire sky. Xiao Liu looked up in shock \u2013 who was Xuan really, to have such a powerful force behind him?The battle commenced in the sky. Compared to Xiang Liu, Xuan was at an advantage with his number of men. But Xiang Liu\u2019s men lived under the spectre of death and acc.u.mulated mutual understanding through blood shed. They were fierce enough that the two sides were evenly matched up.A sudden boom and a golden fireball struck one man and he was obliterated along with his winged ride. Then another was sliced in half by a ma.s.sive ice sword. Two combatants swooped past and Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t see clearly who it was. Something fell from the sky and shattered on the rocks. Xiao Liu picked it up and it was a b.l.o.o.d.y mask.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t hide anymore and rushed out, climbing to the top of the highest tree.The sky was ablaze in battle, with fire and smoke, but Xiang Liu\u2019s presence was impossible to miss. His white hair, white robe, and white mask, on a white condor, he was like a snow patch swirling in the sky. Every move was beautiful but each was a deadly attack.Four people encircled him, one of whom was Xuan, and each was a powerful opponent. Xiang Liu battled by only attacking and never guarding, it was to win or die. His weapon was a curved sword like a crescent moon, crystal clear like it was made of ice, and he wielded it so that it appeared to be ice droplets dancing in the air.Xiang Liu didn\u2019t care about protecting his back, he rushed forward and sliced through the ice blade attacks. A head went flying but Xiang Liu\u2019s back was pierced and there was blood. Ice blades rained down on him but Xiang Liu didn\u2019t hide and deftly dodged it. His blade went down and another man and his winged ride was gone. But Xiang Liu was hurt again and there was blood on the corner of his lips.There was deadly leaves swirling towards him into a wood spirit maze but Xiang Liu didn\u2019t even bother to solve it and instead pierced through the center and took out the man. That left only him versus Xuan, one on one.Xiang Liu rushed Xuan but he was already injured and his spiritual power greatly decreased, whereas Xuan wasn\u2019t even hurt and was full of power. Xuan held a wooden spirit long whip in his left hand and a golden short sword in his right hand. He was actually able to deftly control two different powers at the same time and attacked, with the whip like a snake and the sword like a lion.Xiao Liu called out \u201cXiang Liu, left hand.\u201d Xiao Liu smashed his left hand on the tree and the pain was excruciating. Xuan\u2019s attack slipped.\u201cRight hand.\u201dXiao Liu smashed his right hand on the tree and Xuan almost dropped his weapon.Xiang Liu was able to laugh even in the middle of battle while Xuan glared in rage and send his whip flying towards Xiao Liu. Xiao Liu lowered his head and slid down the tree into the thick forest where the winged rides wouldn\u2019t enter so Xuan couldn\u2019t reach him.Xiang Liu ordered \u201cLeft leg, right hand.\u201dXiao Liu cursed but took a spiked branch and viciously smashed down on his left leg at the same time as he smashed his right hand on a rock. Xiang Liu summoned his powers and tossed his sword away as he flew towards Xuan, clearly intending to deliver the killing blow. Xuan was able to roll off his winged ride so Xiang Liu\u2019s attack struck the beast instead.Xuan fell from a great height and loudly smashed through a giant tree. He was greatly injured and covered in blood but he jumped right back up and started running while calling for his men.In the deep forest, the trees were so thick the winged rides couldn\u2019t enter so Xiang Liu jumped off his condor and started chasing after Xuan on foot.Xiao Liu was jumping from tree to tree like a monkey and following along. Suddenly his eyes spotted something long and white. It looked like the tail of an animal. Before Xiao Liu could process it, his body froze. He jumped over and picked up the white thing hanging on a tree \u2013 it was a fluffy white fox tail. Xiao Liu\u2019s entire person was immobilized. Then his lips curled into a smile, and within that smile there was tears in his eyes that were about to fall sorrowfully.Suddenly his face changed and he charged after Xiang Liu and Xuan like a crazed person.Xuan was flying but Xiang Liu suddenly darted out like a ghost from within the thicket, his hands already transformed into razor sharp claws like five daggers, and it was swiftly aimed at Xuan. Xuan blocked with his whip but the whip was destroyed but the claw hand was intact. Xiang Liu\u2019s eyes glowed demon red and Xuan\u2019s body was pressed down like a mountain was on top of him. He couldn\u2019t move or dodge but he refused to close his eyes. If he was going to die, then he wanted to see clearly how he died.A figure flew forward like a shooting star into Xuan\u2019s embrace and blocked Xiang Liu\u2019s thunderous blow.\u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d Xiao Liu painfully screamed.Xuan felt the exact same pain, it pierced him straight through the heart. But he only felt the pain and wasn\u2019t actually injured. Xuan stared in shock at Xiao Liu, not understanding why Xiao Liu saved his life at his own expense.Xiao Liu pushed him hard \u201cRun!\u201dXiang Liu wouldn\u2019t let Xuan escape and tried to attack again. Xiao Liu turned and risked his life again, tightly grabbing onto Xiang Liu\u2019s clawed hand to prevent him from attacking Xuan again.Xuan\u2019s men arrived and helped him escape, but Xuan turned and gave Xiao Liu a mystified look.Xiang Liu was so close to victory but Xiao Liu ruined it. He was enraged and kicked Xiao Liu hard. Xiao Liu crumpled to the ground but still used every ounce of his might to hold on to to Xiang Liu\u2019s leg so he couldn\u2019t chase after Xuan.Xuan was helped on a winged ride which rose into the clouds and disappeared. He leaned on his servant and tightly clenched his lips as he felt the same pain. The pain was in his stomach, his arms, every part of his body hurt. It was like his entire body was being ripped to shreds. But he knew he wasn\u2019t going to be ripped to shreds, because this pain didn\u2019t belong to him, it belonged to Xiao Liu.Xuan stared out into the cloud sea and couldn\u2019t figure it out. Why? Why did Xiao Liu first help Xiang Liu kill him, but at the very last moment, risked his own life to save him? He used a vicious torture on Xiao Liu, so Xiao Liu ought to hate him and want him dead. Why save him then?Xiang Liu\u2019s rage was like the churning ocean, threatening to swallow everything in its path. Xiao Liu knew Xiang Liu would kill him but felt no fear.The red blood around her made her see the fire red phoenix flowers. Under the phoenix tree, there was a Mom who made a swing for her. She stood on the swing and welcomed the falling phoenix leaves. She rose high and her laughter blanketed the earth. Gege stood under the phoenix tree, looking up at her with a smile. When she came down, he pushed her up again. Her swing rose up, came down, rose up, came down\u2026..Xiang Liu\u2019s razor sharp claw came down towards Xiao Liu\u2019s neck but Xiao Liu\u2019s eyes were wide open and he smiled sweetly towards him, his smile like a flower blooming in the Spring. Xiao Liu\u2019s thin neck was in Xiang Liu\u2019s hand, he only need squeeze and all trouble would be gone. Xiao Liu smiled and sighed softly, as if he was content. His head lowered and his eyes closed.Xiang Liu jerked back his hand, picking up Xiao Liu and taking him away.When Xiao Liu opened his eyes, he was in the middle of a cave, his entire body soaked in small pool. There was all sorts of precious medicines tossed into the pool For anyone else, mixing all these various herbs and medicines would do more harm than good. But for Xiao Liu\u2019s weird body, soaking in all sorts of random things actually helped.There was likely a painkiller medicine in there as well because Xiao Liu felt his body was soft and painless. Not far from the pool, Xiang Liu sat on a jade pallet, his brows furrowed as if all the energy was focused there, as if he was about to collapse at any moment. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t dare move or speak so quietly closed his eyes.\u201cWhy did you save him?\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s voice was icy cold, containing his tamped down rage.Xiao Liu\u2019s mind twirled for a minute but didn\u2019t even hesitate and said clearly \u201cBecause I know who he is.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s brow lifted slightly.Xiao Liu continued \u201cA few days ago I was mulling over why you were so free with your time lately and actually spending every day with me. Then I realized you weren\u2019t taking care of me, you were waiting for Xuan. Jing wanted me to hide in the mountains because he knew that you guys had been battling with the Xuan Yuan army for hundreds of years and they still couldn\u2019t track you down. If you wanted, there was no way Xuan could have found me. But you guessed his real ident.i.ty, and you knew he wouldn\u2019t let me live, so you used me to set a trap with the intention to kill him.\u201cSo I used you as a lure. You have a problem with that?\u201d\u201cNormally no, since he wants to kill me so best take him out. But I know now who he really is. He is Zhuan Xu, one of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom princes. Not just any prince, he is the eldest grandson prince of the Yellow Emperor! If I help you kill him, then the Yellow Emperor will surely wreak vengeance on the world and I won\u2019t have any peace. There won\u2019t be a place within the vast wilderness that I can hide!\u201dXiang Liu opened his eyes and stared \u201cI used to think you had some guts.\u201dXiao Liu responded \u201cSorry for disappointing you. You dare to make an enemy of the Yellow Emperor, I don\u2019t. The rage of an Emperor, the blood flows a thousand miles! I cannot endure it!\u201d\u201cHow did you learn Xuan\u2019s ident.i.ty?\u201d\u201cWhen you were chasing him, one of his servants was so frantic he slipped and said something about hurry up and save Prince Zhuan Xu. It was mumbled but you were willing to endure ma.s.sive injury to try and kill him and there isn\u2019t a lot of people in the vast wilderness that would get you that worked up. I thought about it and connected the dots.\u201dXiang Liu stood up and walked into the pool, his hand grabbed Xiao Liu\u2019s neck and slammed it against the stone side \u201cYou knew that I would risk severe injury to kill him!\u201d Xiao Liu had no strength to resist so backed down \u201cI ruined your big plan, so if you want to kill me then kill me!\u201d He docilely stuck out his neck and closed his eyes.Xiang Liu coldly laughed \u201cKill you? That\u2019s be too easy on you!\u201d He lowered his head and bit down hard on Xiao Liu\u2019s neck and drank his blood as if to release his rage. Xiao Liu leaned his neck back and rested on the side of the pool. Thank G.o.d he was of some use to Xiang Liu. Since Xiang Liu was a nine-headed demon with a very strange form, it was near impossible for him to find medicine to heal his injuries. Which is why the equally strange form Xiao Liu was his best medicine.Xuan was laying on the pallet and suddenly bolted upright and touched his neck. He was still alive!In the beginning there was a sharp pain like teeth biting through the flesh. But gradually, the pain transformed into something odd. In the pain there was a sensation of numbness, a s.h.i.+vering feeling of bliss, as if someone was sucking, and licking, and lightly kissing.Xuan felt his mouth turn dry and was suddenly very angry. With such severe injuries, was that guy crazy or what the heck was he doing?Xiang Liu raised his head and stared at Xiao Liu, blood staining his lips, his eyes darkened, his breath slightly labored. Xiao Liu was initially sitting sprawled like a man but suddenly he slid down and unconsciously wanted to cover his chest, but he immediately stopped himself and continued to sit sprawled open.Xiang Liu\u2019s hand moved down from his neck, tracing his jawline, down his clavicle. Xiao Liu grabbed his hand and smiled \u201cI\u2019m a man. Even if you like men, you should find someone better looking.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a man?\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s slightly blood stained lips curved upward \u201cIf you\u2019re a man, how did you lure the Jiu Jiu out?\u201dXiao Liu blinked quizzically \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can\u2019t change your shape as well as voice.\u201d\u201cI trust a beast\u2019s natural instinct.\u201d\u201cIf a beast\u2019s natural instinct was so accurate, your Furball wouldn\u2019t have been poisoned by me. There would be no such thing as traps, and hunters wouldn\u2019t need to hunt.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of transformation spell are you using? You have very weak powers but it\u2019s completely seamless just like it\u2019s your true form!\u201dXiao Liu angrily said \u201cThis is my true form!\u201dXiang Liu stared at him, his eyes as dark as ink, and Xiao Liu\u2019s heart started racing. He violently shook off Xiang Liu\u2019s hand and then spread himself open like a dead pig headed to boiling water \u201cTouch me then, touch me. After you\u2019re done then stop accusing me of being a woman!\u201dXiang Liu glared at him \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your false form.\u201d He released Xiao Liu, turned and walked out of the pool to go lay on the pallet and continued healing himself.Xiao Liu\u2019s wildly nervous heart finally relaxed. He was already severely injured, plus Xiang Liu drank his blood, so his head was woozy and he laid down in the pool to also start healing himself.A day later, Jing arrived nearby. Xiang Liu was still injured and a very wary person so he would never meet someone that could be a threat. When he felt Jing close to the cave, he quietly left and the injured Xiao Liu was alone in the cave when Jing came in. He saw Xiao Liu floating in the pool, face completely white, body covered in injuries, eyes closed and fast asleep.Jing felt for his pulse and immediately picked him up, carrying him out of the cave in quick steps while calling for his winged ride.Ten days later, Xiao Liu woke up in an elegantly decorated room. It was hot Summer out but cool inside, and through the window there was a courtyard filled with blooming flowers of every type. A wind chime hung on the window sill made from crystal from the North Pole and in various colors carved into different flower shapes. As the wind blew past, the cold from the crystal chimes released into the air and brought a breeze.Xiao Liu put on a robe and walked out to the corridor. Jing stood up in the courtyard and looked directly at him. The bright warm sun, the vibrant flowers, and a gentleman. Like a painting, it was so utterly beautiful. Xiao Liu walked up to Jing and he reached out to touch his face as if to confirm he was real. Xiao Liu slightly leaned his head to feel the warmth of his palm.Jing suddenly embraced Xiao Liu, gentle but tightly pulling him into his arms. Xiao Liu closed his eyes, allowing his head to lightly rest on Jing\u2019s shoulder. In this moment, they were just s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu.Cling clank, plates crashed on the ground. Xiao Liu raised his head and saw Jing Ye standing dumbstruck in the corridor, her eyes filled with shock and dismay. Xiao Liu\u2019s evil side rose up so he maintained his position and closed his eyes, pretending he saw and heard nothing, waiting to see how Jing would react.Jing disappointed Xiao Liu, he was calm and continued to quietly embrace Xiao Liu. There was the feeling that even if the world was ending, he was still going keep on hugging.Jing Ye finally moved and walked over \u201cIs Master Liu\u2019s injuries worsened? Let me help him stand.\u201dXiao Liu guffawed out loud, she\u2019s a funny one as well! He squirmed out of Jing\u2019s arms and smiled at Jing Ye. She bowed to him \u201cThank you Young Master for saving my Lord\u2019s life. Please accept my bow of grat.i.tude.\u201d Xiao Liu avoided it \u201cYour lord saved my life so it\u2019s even.\u201d Xiao Liu thanked Jing \u201cLao Mu is waiting for me so I\u2019ll be off.\u201dXiao Liu turned and left. Jing reached out his hand but slowly pulled it back, only watching Xiao Liu\u2019s form disappear down the corridor.It appeared Xiao Liu was recovered but he still couldn\u2019t use any energy and would get tired from just a little labor. But he hadn\u2019t made any money in too long and there was a family to feed. So he couldn\u2019t rest and rushed back to Hui Chun Clinic to see patients.Xan Tian Er followed next to Xiao Liu and the two were surprisingly in sync. He ordered, she did, and from grabbing medicine to wrapping wounds, she did a great job. She wasn\u2019t afraid of blood or disgusting wounds, and she was so thorough the patients all complimented her.Xiao Liu praised \u201cYou can\u2019t cook, you can\u2019t mend, you can\u2019t clean, but you are really good at seeing what people need.\u201d Tian Er smiled wanly \u201cBrother Liu, are you praising or insulting me?\u201d Xiao Liu added \u201cSeeing patients is a form of observation, I think you can learn medicine.\u201d Tian Er raised her head and stared at Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu added \u201cChuan Zi and Ma Zi followed me for 20 years but they don\u2019t belong in this profession. I think you can do it, so if you\u2019re willing then learn from me. I will teach you to treat infertility, and with that skill, no matter where you go you won\u2019t starve to death.\u201d\u201cBrother Liu is willing to teach me?\u201d\u201cWhy not? If you work, then I can retire.\u201dXan Tian Er knelt down and bowed three times and choked up \u201cThank you, Brother Liu.\u201dThe past always followed her and even if Chuan Zi treated her well with her life experiences she never could rely on a man completely. She was falling deeper into the life with Chuan Zi but she was at a disadvantage so she was always the one resolving any problem. Chun Tao could fight with Ma Zi and go home to her parents house. But she couldn\u2019t, and also realized she couldn\u2019t treat her husband like a customer for the rest of her life because that wasn\u2019t real. She had no skills and no one to talk to, but she hid her hopelessness under her smile. Who knew someone would understand her and give her a reason to be proud in this house, to allow her to protect this family.Xiao Liu gently said \u201cBe good to Lao Mu. When you guys die and he\u2019s still alive, make sure your children are good to him.\u201d Xan Tian Er looked quizzically at Xiao Liu but he just smiled. Xan Tian Er appeared to understand a bit and she nodded solemnly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. I will take good care of Lao Mu and Chuan Zi.\u201dXuan walked into the clinic and sat down across from Xiao Liu \u201cGiving final instructions?\u201dXiao Liu went to get water and used that to control the emotions in his eyes. He said to Tian Er \u201cGo to the field to help Chuan Zi.\u201d Tian Er looked at Xuan and walked out.Xiao Liu slowly drank some water before raising his head and looking at Xuan \u201cWhy are you gracing us with your presence?\u201d Xuan paused \u201cWhy did you save me?\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cIf you died, then the voodoo bug in you body dies. It took me a lot of work to raise that bug, I don\u2019t want it to die.\u201d Xuan looked at him and Xiao Liu poured him water \u201cI kidnapped Ah Nian but didn\u2019t hurt her and just teased her a bit. Your men tortured me and I also didn\u2019t let you off easy. Xiang Liu used me as a trap but I saved you. Let\u2019s consider it even, okay?\u201dXuan asked \u201cWhen are you removing the bug from me?\u201d Xiao Liu thought and said \u201cWhen you leave Qing Shui Town.\u201d Xuan\u2019s hands pressed down on the table \u201cWhy not now?\u201d\u201cYou have great ambitions and ought to be leaving town soon. When you leave, I\u2019ll remove the bug. This bug has no ill effects other than when one of us hurts the other hurts. So if you don\u2019t harm me, then you won\u2019t hurt. This is to keep me safe.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Xuan got up and left, and when he arrived at the door, he suddenly turned around \u201cWhen you have time, you can come drink with me at the shop.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled \u201cSure.\u201dXuan raised his eyebrow and smirked \u201cAnd when you\u2019re hurt, you might want to restrain your urges.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Xiao Liu was thoroughly confused. When did he ever have urges?Xuan touched his neck and left with a laugh. Xiao Liu stared confused and then after some time he started to smile. Can I really go drink with you? There was a voice that told him not to, but another said that he was leaving town soon, so if not now then he\u2019ll never get the chance again.Winter arrived and by then Xiao Liu\u2019s injuries were all healed. Because he was easily tired, these past few months Xiao Liu stayed inside and used the time to teach Xan Tian Er.Tian Er earnestly learned medicine and in her busy daily life, the relations.h.i.+p between her and Chuan Zi slowly changed. When she first married him, she was very sensitive to things related to her past and purposely avoided it. Now she would grind medicine and sometimes hum songs she used to sing. In the past Tian Er would not nag Chuan Zi, but now if he slacked off she would yell at him. In time, Tian Er became more and more like the lady of the house.Xiao Liu smiled to see Xan Tian Er working so hard to grab onto the littlest bit of happiness, like a bud trying to sprout in the barren earth. The desire to cling onto life is something even an observer could feel.At dusk, snow flurries came down. It was the first snow of the year and Lao Mu warmed wine and asked Xiao Liu and Chuan Zi to drink with him. Xiao Liu remembered another invitation to drink and stared at the snow in a daze. Tian Er brought a lantern over and Chaun Zi was about to blow it out when Xiao Liu took it and left the house.Lao Mu called out \u201cYou don\u2019t want to drink\u201d but Xiao Liu just waved his hand. Under the falling snow, Xiao Liu walked down the street until he was outside the wine shop. He suddenly wavered and stood outside holding the lantern. Xiao Liu turned to leave when he heard \u201cSince you came, when not come inside?\u201d Xuan stood in the doorway and stared at Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu slowly turned around and smiled \u201cI didn\u2019t see any light so thought no one was at home.\u201d Xuan smiled and didn\u2019t pierce through Xiao Liu\u2019s excuse. Xiao Liu followed behind Xuan and walked through the shop into the backyard. Who knows when Xuan planted a plum blossom tree but it blanketed the entire yard with its fragrance.Xuan saw Xiao Liu looking at the plum blossom and said \u201cAh Nian wanted it so I planted it for her.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cYou sure are very good to your sister.\u201d The same words that was once said in jest, today felt bittersweet. The two sat on a warm pallet and Xuan brought out a few dishes and warmed a brazier to heat up some wine. The door and window was open so the snow and plum blossoms fell outside creating a lovely view.The two didn\u2019t speak and just drank. One was still wary and didn\u2019t feel like bulls.h.i.+tting, the other was restraining heartache and had no words to say.This is a wine shop so the only thing it had in abundance was wine. The wine went down like water and Xiao Liu was starting to get drunk. He laughed \u201cHow can Ah Nian be fine with me drinking here?\u201dXuan laughed \u201cShe\u2019s a light weight. One cup and she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s likely dreaming a happy dream right now.\u201dXiao Liu added \u201cI can tell you are G.o.ds, and also from a powerful family. Why come to Qing Shui Town and live the hard life?\u201dXuan replied \u201cI thought you knew the reason.\u201d\u201cKill Xiang Liu?\u201d Xiao Liu shook his head \u201cNo, you guys don\u2019t need to do any killing yourself if you want someone killed.\u201dXuan smiled and said nothing. Xiao Liu toasted him \u201cTell me!\u201d\u201cThe real reason, even if I told anyone, no one would believe me.\u201d\u201cI would believe you.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026..fine! I\u2019ll tell you! I learned to make wine from my Master. One rare time Master got drunk, he told me a story about his youth. Back then he wasn\u2019t the head of the household yet. He traveled the vast wilderness as an ordinary person. In a small town, he became a blacksmith living the mundane life. One day a young man came to ask him to forge a weapon. They drank as he forged and the most delicious wine promised was also the strongest. So they got drunk together, and he made the one and only true friend in his life. I remembered this story and since I was small, I wanted to try living the life of an ordinary person. Perhaps\u2026.I could meet someone who could become a true friend.\u201dXuan finished and looked at Xiao Liu \u201cDo you believe me?\u201d\u201cI do!\u201d\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you think this reason is absurd?\u201d\u201cI can tell that you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201dXuan sighed \u201cBut I am not my Master. I am selling wine, but I am not really living as an ordinary person.\u201dXiao Liu laughed and consoled him \u201cEveryone has their own life experiences. You experienced a lot already.\u201dXuan derided \u201cYeah, at least my Master didn\u2019t get a voodoo bug planted in him.\u201dXiao Liu held his head and laughed \u201cThen you need to thank me.\u201dXuan asked \u201cWhy did you save me?\u201dXiao Liu held the wine \u201cI\u2019m not drunk yet, no need to try and get information out of me.\u201d Xuan laughed \u201cThen I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re drunk then ask.\u201d Xiao Liu countered \u201cImpossible.\u201d Xuan asked \u201cWhy?\u201dXiao Liu drank three cups in a row \u201cBecause I\u2019m going to sleep\u201d and then sprawled on the pallet and promptly fell asleep. Xuan shook him \u201cYou\u2019ve got a high tolerance!\u201d He closed the door and window, drank a few more cups, and laid down on the pallet and also fell asleep. In the middle of the night, he woke up and saw Xiao Liu had left already. Xuan smiled.A few days later, the plum blossom wine Xuan made last year was ready to drink. He sold wine during the day, and that night he was so excited he took two jugs to find Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu paused to see him but invited him in. There was no good cups in the house so Xiao Liu grabbed two bowls, some duck neck and chicken feet snacks he usually ate, and brought it over. The two drank in silence as usual. After they were done, both were slightly tipsy.Xuan asked \u201cWhy are you here in Qing Shui Town.\u201d\u201cWandering the world, I wandered my way here. I liked it so decided to stay.\u201d\u201cYou and Nine-lives Xiang Liu are\u2026..very close?\u201d Xiao Liu thought \u201cThis question isn\u2019t suitable to be answered when drinking.\u201d\u201cThen drink a few more bowls then answer.\u201dXuan poured Xiao Liu a big bowl and Xiao Liu drank it \u201cI\u2019m scared of him, but I don\u2019t dislike him. I am not enemies with him, but also not friends.\u201dXuan replied \u201cHe\u2019s too smart, otherwise I really want to sit down and calmly drink with him once.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cYou and Ah Nian\u2026..is it really just sibling feelings between you guys?\u201dXuan laughed \u201cNow this question is suited to answer when drinking.\u201dXiao Liu poured him a big bowl and Xuan gulped it down. He said nothing so Xiao Liu poured him another bowl. He gulped it down and took out a satchel from his robe. He opened it and pulled out a furry thing that looked like a s...o...b..ll. He shook it and it expanded into a white fox tail \u201cThis is my little sister cousin\u2019s precious treasure. When we were parting, she gave it to me but said it was just temporarily for me to play with. But that temporarily has become three hundred years.\u201dXuan lightly stroked the white fox tail \u201cMy little sister is the daughter of my Aunt and my Master. I promised my Aunt I would take care of my little sister, but I broke my promise. When my little sister was small, she went missing. They all say she\u2019s dead but I still have a shred of hope. I hope that she is alive and will come back to ask for this fox tail back. Ah Nian is also the daughter of my Master. I am good to her because it\u2019s like being good to my missing sister.\u201dXiao Liu appeared totally under the influence and needed to hold onto Xuan. He raised a bowl and used it to wipe away a tear. Xuan curled the fox tail back into a ball and put it into the satchel, and then tucked the satchel snugly next to his body. He poured more wine and drank with Xiao Liu.After two jugs were finished, the two fell asleep drunk. In the middle of the night, Xiao Liu woke up to find Xuan had left. Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t fall back asleep so laid awake until sunrise.For the rest of the Winter, Xuan and Xiao Liu would often drink together. In the beginning, the two would shoot the breeze but after some time, Xuan really saw Xiao Liu as a friend and would even ask him how to use poisons. Xiao Liu was very honest and open with Xuan, telling him all about poisons and how to cure it and mix it. He even shared simple ways to avoid poisons. Sometimes Xiao Liu would earnestly warn him \u201cXiang Liu wants to kill you. Even if he can\u2019t send soldiers to Qing Shui Town, the Sheng Nong resistance army is based near here for the past hundreds of years. You really should leave soon.\u201dXuan thought they were real friends but when he wanted to get closer, Xiao Liu would pretend to be clueless.The two appeared to be only superficial friends. When they were drunk, they could laugh. When they were sober, they were strangers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Liu is the alter ego of our leading lady and her real name is Gao Xing Jiu Yao (everyone calls her Xiao Yao) and she is the Eldest Princess of the Gao Xing Kingdom. Her devoted silent protector is Tu Shan Jing, scion of one of the Four Great Clans, but in front of her he\u2019s just Ye s.h.i.+ Qi, the dude she rescued from the brink of death. Wine shop owner Xuan is merely the cover for Prince Zhuan Xu, one of the princes of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom, and he\u2019s also Xiao Yao\u2019s cousin. She calls him Gege or older brother. And finally Nine-lives Xiang Liu, the only non-G.o.d ent.i.ty among the leads, appears to be just Xiang Liu all the time. But expect that to change coming up and he\u2019ll show up in Xiao Yao\u2019s life as someone else as well. It\u2019s not really a spoiler since she\u2019s hardly fooled, but it changes their dynamic completely and adds another layer of complexity for this girl. We have a leading lady who just wants to live the most ordinary of lives, being pulled back into her most complicated of worlds, surrounded by three extraordinary men.Chapter 7 \u2013 People Become Far Away and the Road Becomes Long:The cold Winter left and the warm Spring arrived. Ma Zi\u2019s second daughter was turning one and Xiao Liu went out to buy some snacks for the family banquet.He forgot to bring money and was about to borrow some from Xuan when Jing walked over and paid for him.Xiao Liu shoved the snacks in his arms \u201cYou paid for it, you eat it!\u201d He turned and left but Xuan saw them and called out \u201cXiao Liu, s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dXiao Liu had no choice but to walk into the wine shop. There was no one there and Xuan was drinking alone and playing with a chess board. Xiao Liu sat down and Jing followed and sat down as well.Xuan asked \u201cOne match?\u201d Xiao Liu recently learned chess from Xuan so he was itching to play.\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you, I\u2019m asking him.\u201d Xuan pointed at Jing.Xiao Liu was a lousy chess player, making moves slow and would even renege and take a move back. Xuan played a few times with him and vowed never to do it again.Xiao Liu was insulted \u201cYou\u2019re looking down on me!\u201d\u201cI am looking down on you!\u201d Xuan didn\u2019t try to hide his disgust towards Xiao Liu\u2019s chess playing but then very courteously asked s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cWhat of it? One match? I\u2019ve heard you excel at all the artistic disciplines from painting, chess, books, and music.\u201dJing lowered his head and asked Xiao Liu \u201cShall I play with him?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one playing, what does it have to do with me?\u201d \u201cI listen to you, if you say for me to play, I\u2019ll play. If you say no, then I won\u2019t.\u201d Xiao Liu wanted to get angry but his lips curled upward and he didn\u2019t say anything. Jing stared intently at Xiao Liu.Xuan rapped the table a few times \u201cHey, hey\u2026.I know you two are close, but\u2026..\u201dXiao Liu angrily huffed \u201cWho\u2019s close with him?\u201d while at the same time Jing said \u201cWe\u2019re close, and it doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d Both of them stared at Xuan, with Xiao Liu looking furious while Jing looked very calm.Xuan laughed at Xiao Liu \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you guys are close or not, he listens to you. Have him play with me. I\u2019ve heard of his famous reputation for so long but never had a chance.\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s eyes twirled \u201cI want to play, too.\u201d Xuan sighed \u201cFine, you place the pieces, he calls the moves.\u201dXiao Liu picked up a piece and Jing would softly give a move and Xiao Liu would place the piece. Xuan smiled and followed suit. After some time, Xuan understood that Jing\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t unwarranted.People came to buy wine but Xuan wasn\u2019t interested. He put a servant at the counter and told no one was to come bother him.Piece after piece, Xuan slowly stopped laughing and stared at the chess board. People say its hard to meet a kindred spirit and to meet a true chess playing equal is a very happy occurrence. Xuan\u2019s chess was taught by the Yellow Emperor and the people he practiced with were the great generals of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom. Nowadays when Xuan played chess he usually only put a third of an effort into it. Today he was putting 100% of his effort into this match. Xuan put a piece down and felt it was a good move.He was excitedly waiting for Jing to make the counter and heard him say something to Xiao Liu. But Xiao Liu shook his head and pointed elsewhere \u201cI think it should be placed here.\u201d Jing smiled and didn\u2019t object \u201cFine, then place it there.\u201dXiao Liu happily placed the piece but Xuan hollered \u201cI allow you to renege on a move. Make a different move!\u201d Xiao Liu replied \u201cI\u2019ve decided, it\u2019s going there.\u201d Xuan pleaded with Jing \u201cPlease reconsider.\u201dXiao Liu was impatient \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying! When I want to renege on a move you won\u2019t let me, and now I don\u2019t want to renege you want me to.\u201dXuan felt such pent up frustration, like his greatest excitement at putting on a new outfit only to find the mouse had eaten a hole in it. He placed his move and already knew in how many moves he would win. Jing said something and Xiao Liu placed a piece.Xuan exhaled as the frustration was lifted, like seeing the hole being in a place that can\u2019t be seen so the outfit was still good. Xuan thought and placed a piece. Jing said something to Xiao Liu but he shook his head \u201cYour idea is bad, I want it there.\u201d\u201cFine, that\u2019s a good place.\u201d Jing still smiled and complimented Xiao Liu as if Xiao Liu\u2019s chess skill was exemplary and every move was brilliant, as opposed to completely and utterly c.r.a.p.Xiao Liu happily placed the piece and Xuan felt like he found a second mouse eaten hole in his clothes. He said \u201cI highly suggest you change your move.\u201d Xiao Liu glared at him \u201cNo!\u201dXuan countered and then Jing gave a move and then back and forth, and suddenly Xuan felt like the hole was once again out of sight and he was excited again.Jing lowered his head but Xiao Liu shook his head and said \u201cThere.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Xiao Liu put the piece down and by now Xuan had given up and was only curious to see how Jing continued to transform the worst moves into a save. After an hour the chess match was over and Jing lost. Xuan won but didn\u2019t feel happy whereas Jing lost and was smiling.Xiao Liu asked Jing \u201cWas it because of my moves that you lost?\u201d \u201cNo, your moves were great, it was my moves that were bad.\u201d Xiao Liu happily giggled while Xuan wearily clasped his head.Xiao Liu saw that it was almost dark and laughed \u201cWinner treats! Heard there was a new roasted meat restaurant in town. Let\u2019s go try it.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Jing answered so quickly that Xuan wondered if perhaps Jing did not know the word \u201cno\u201d when he was talking to Xiao Liu. Xuan pointed to himself \u201cI didn\u2019t say yes yet.\u201d Jing looked at him \u201cLoser will treat.\u201d Xuan controlled his laugh and glanced at Xiao Liu \u201cSure!\u201dThe three of them left the shop and walked down the street. It was Xiao Liu and Xuan bickering with each other while Jing listened quietly. Xiao Liu was happy so Jing\u2019s eyes reflected that happiness.Suddenly there was a holler to move out of the way. A carriage rumbled past with a window decorated oddly \u2013 with a golden arrow embroidered on it. Eight tall men followed behind the carriage, all carrying bows and arrows, giving off an imposing presence. Even the most brazen hooligans stood silently staring, everyone on the street quieting down to observe.The second Jing saw the carriage the laughter disappeared from his eyes. He lowered his eyes and stood frozen in place. Xiao Liu asked \u201cWho was that? That was awesome!\u201d Xuan shot a glance at Jing and said nothing.Xiao Liu asked \u201cWhy was there a bow and arrow embroidered on the window curtain?\u201dXuan explained \u201cThat is the emblem of the Fang Feng family. The Fang Feng family are all archers, and legend has it their ancestor could shoot down the stars. Not every family member has the right to embroider the emblem, and the size also matters. Based on that, the person in that carriage must be an extraordinary archer.\u201dXiao Liu whistled \u201cNo wonder everyone stopped and stared in fear.\u201d Xiao Liu thought the Fang Feng name sounded familiar and looked at Jing. The way Jing looked suddenly made Xiao Liu remember the connection. He turned his head away and asked Xuan in a low voice \u201cWas that the Tu Shan family future second daughter-in-law?\u201dXuan replied \u201cProbably.\u201d There was the bow and arrow Fang Feng family emblem embroidered on the curtains, and on the corner of the carriage there was the nine-tailed fox emblem that represented the Tu Shan family. Other than the Tu Shan family second son\u2019s fiancee Miss Fang Feng, there was no other possibility.The carriage pa.s.sed and people started moving again but the three of them remained standing there. Xiao Liu laughed at Jing \u201cSince your fiancee is here, we won\u2019t bother your reunion. Bye!\u201d Xiao Liu dragged Xuan off, leaving Jing standing there watching them disappear around the corner.Jing Ye rushed over to Jing \u201cI finally found my lord, please come back. It\u2019s been ten years and Miss Fang Feng must have a lot she wants to say to you.\u201dJing eyes reflected his sadness but he wordlessly walked back.Jing Ye said \u201cAll these years, without news of my lord, everyone wanted Miss Fang Feng to call off the engagement. But she stubbornly refused and has remained at Qing Qiu waiting for my lord. She behaves towards the Grand Madam like a granddaughter-in-law and helps ease her worries. My lord insists on staying in Qing Shui Town and not going back, the Grand Madam is very angry. Miss Fang Feng has been trying to speak up on your behalf and rushed here to see you.\u201dJing still said nothing and Jing Ye felt very concerned. The second lord used to be a man of many words, but after being missing for 9 years, he returned a man who rarely says anything. Jing Ye asked around and heard that the second lord lived at Hui Chun Clinic for 6 years, but 3 years remains unaccounted for. The second lord never discussed it and when the Grand Madam wrote asking to find out, he claims he doesn\u2019t remember anymore. He claims to have woken up with no memory and remained a disciple at the clinic. But Jing Ye and everyone else all believe that it was the eldest lord who did it. But if the second lord refuses to speak of it, then no one dared to do anything.Jing Ye missed the old second lord. He was a great businessman, and in his personal time he was considerate and sweet. Not like now, where he barely seemed to care about anything. Thankfully he was alive and that was all that mattered. They arrived at the residence but Jing stopped outside. Jing Ye could understand since the second lord had never even seen his fiancee despite being engaged. They were like strangers.Jing Ye whispered \u201cMiss Fang Feng likes archery. My lord used to design weapons. She likes to travel and see the sights, my lord is an exquisite painter of sights, she likes to listen to songs from the North, my lord can play songs from the North on the flute for her. Oh right, she\u2019s also a great chess player and even her older brothers can\u2019t beat her. My lord can play\u2026.\u201dJing walked in and the servants all came out. A young woman in a red dress robe walked out, she was tall and graceful, with fine features and red lips. She elegantly bowed while Jing kept his head lowered and courteously returned the bow.Inside the restaurant, Xuan asked Xiao Liu \u201cHow did you come to take that one in?\u201d Xiao Liu scoffed \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t already investigate yourself.\u201d\u201cI did investigate but you trained Chuan Zi and Ma Zi well and they didn\u2019t reveal anything. After getting Chuan Zi drunk, all he said was that he was once gravely injured and you rescued him. What kind of injury he never explained.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cIt\u2019s not Chuan Zi not wanting to explain, I handled it all myself so Chuan Zi saw nothing.\u201d\u201cI can hear that his voice is scratchy, was it from that injury?\u201d\u201cWhy do we need to keep talking about him?\u201d\u201cBecause the Tu Shan family\u2019s businesses blanket the entire vast wilderness, and he represents the future of the clan and that will determine whether the Tu Shan clan is my friend or foe.\u201d\u201cThen you go get chummy with him, why ask me?\u201d\u201cHe listens to you.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cYou think playing chess and running his entire family business is the same? He listens to me, because I saved him, but he only listens to what he can listen to.\u201dXuan sighed and gave up on his idea. Like Xiao Liu said, 6 years of grat.i.tude can let Jing treat Xiao Liu well, but would never let Jing change the position of the Tu Shan clan for Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu pressed \u201cYou hurry up and leave town. Xiang Liu can show up anytime.\u201d Xuan raised a cup of wine with arrogance \u201cYou think Xiang Liu is powerful, but don\u2019t think too lowly of me.\u201d Xiao Liu said \u201cFine, Fine, you\u2019re super powerful!\u201dXuan smiled \u201cOne on one battle I can\u2019t beat him, I can\u2019t even come close.\u201d Xuan pointed to his head \u201cBut I rely on this.\u201dXiao Liu almost spit out his meat \u201cThat\u2019s just relying on your connections and background.\u201d \u201cBut at least I have that, and that takes time to develop connections.\u201dXiao Liu said nothing and after some time asked \u201cAll these years, it\u2019s been tough, huh?\u201d Xuan glanced at Xiao Liu with some shock and casually replied \u201cIt\u2019s been okay.\u201dThe two finished eating and walked home. Xuan went back to the wine shop but Xiao Liu didn\u2019t go back to the clinic. He walked to the river\u2019s edge and stood there for some time before slowly walking into the river.The Spring water still carried a Winter chill. Xiao Liu let the river carry him downstream until he was s.h.i.+vering deep into his bones. Right up until he almost smashed into a rock, he climbed on the rock and let the cold air further chill him. He said to himself \u201cDo you see? This is what happens when you do what you want. You almost freeze to death.\u201dXiao Liu jumped back into the river and swam upstream back to the clinic. He ran inside, took off his clothes, and burrowed under the blankets. He was still cold and tossed and turned but couldn\u2019t sleep. He yelled at himself \u201cWen Xiao Liu! Don\u2019t be so coddled! Life goes on no matter who leaves!\u201dThese days, everyone was talking about Miss Fang Feng and the Tu Shan second lord. Xiao Liu decided not to leave the house but couldn\u2019t even escape it at home. Tian Er said \u201cI saw Miss Fang Feng, she\u2019s so beautiful and delicate, needing a maid to escort her, but I hear she\u2019s a crack archer and can kill a person from ten miles out. That second lord sure is lucky!\u201dChuan Zi groused \u201cOur Qing Shui Town isn\u2019t a lofty place, why do those powerful families children decide to stay here?\u201d Tian Er laughed \u201cWho cares why? I heard Tu Shan clan wants to hurry up with the wedding. If anyone had such a wonderful fiancee he would want to marry her as soon as possible.\u201dXiao Liu put his bowl down \u201cI\u2019m full, you guys eat. I\u2019m going out for a walk.\u201dXiao Liu walked along the river and sat down on a rock with his mind in a daze. He plucked a flower and pulled off its petals, tossing it in the river. Suddenly a white condor called and before Xiao Liu could even gasp he was wrenched onto the back of the condor by Xiang Liu.Xiao Liu waved with a smile \u201cLong time no see. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d\u201cIf Xuan was dead, I\u2019d be a lot better.\u201dXiao Liu shut up and tightly grabbed Xiang Liu\u2019s arm, afraid that he would get p.i.s.sed and toss him off. The white condor flew to the same lake they once came to. Before the condor could descend, Xiang Liu suddenly grabbed Xiao Liu and vaulted off.Xiao Liu was stunned and could only grab onto Xiang Liu with a tentacled creature grasp. The wind whistled past and Xiang Liu stared coldly \u201cShall I use you as a cus.h.i.+on?\u201d Xiao Liu violently shook his head with his eyes full of pleading but Xiang Liu didn\u2019t appear moved. They were descending so fast as if they were going to be smashed to smithereens. Right at the moment before impacting the water, Xiang Liu suddenly turned and flipped Xiao Liu on top.With a giant plop, the two of them entered the water and a giant wave rose up. Even though Xiang Liu absorbed the brunt of the impact, Xiao Liu was still rocked by the waves and his head was spinning and his entire body ached. Because his limbs were in such pain, he couldn\u2019t grab onto Xiang Liu and his body sunk into the depths.Xiang Liu floated in the water staring as he sunk towards the bottom of the lake. Xiao Liu tried to reach out but could grab nothing and his eyes were gradually seeing black. Just as he was about to take his last breath, he felt Xiang Liu embrace him and a pair of cold lips pressed to his and pa.s.sed air to him.Xiang Liu held him and they rocketed towards the surface like an arrow. Xiao Liu sprawled on Xiang Liu\u2019s shoulder and violently coughed and took loud deep breathes. His nose and eyes were all filled with water. After some time, Xiao Liu finally asked \u201cIf you want to kill me, do it faster.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s body fell backward and he laid down on the water\u2019s surface. Xiao Liu\u2019s entire body was still aching so he couldn\u2019t move and could only lay on top of him. Xiang Liu pulled Xiao Liu\u2019s arm \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\u201cHe will hurt a lot.\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cThis voodoo bug is decent but not good enough.\u201d\u201cIf it was a life-linked voodoo bug, you wouldn\u2019t even hesitate and would kill me, right?\u201d\u201cYup, too bad it just shares pain.\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s voice shared his regret.Xiao Liu closed his eyes and felt them rocking on the waves. The water supported everything so there was no need to use any strength and it was quite relaxing.Xiang Liu asked \u201cSince he\u2019s so precious to you, why not remove the bug?\u201dXiao Liu didn\u2019t answer and thought for a long time. Since he was a demon, and demons and creatures and monsters were all in the same world, perhaps he might know something. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to remove the bug, it\u2019s that I can\u2019t. Last time I was injured, you used all sorts of weird medicines on me. The bug had some type of transformation. He asked me to remove the bug and I lied that I\u2019ll do it when he leaves. Recently I\u2019ve been trying all sorts of ways to coax the bug out of him but nothing works.\u201dXiang Liu thought about it \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then don\u2019t try calling it back. The only solution is to find a way to transfer the bug to another person.\u201dXiao Liu sincerely said \u201cThe only person I want to make miserable is you.\u201dXiang Liu softly laughed \u201cThen put the bug inside me.\u201d Xiao Liu scoffed \u201cLike you would be so nice.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill him before he leaves Qing Shui Town, then you won\u2019t have to worry about how to remove the bug.\u201dXiao Liu felt his legs weren\u2019t shaking anymore so slid down his body and started swimming. \u201cCan killing him bring back the Sheng Nong Kingdom?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDid he ever go on the battlefield and killed Sheng Nong soldiers?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDo you have a personal blood feud with him?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why do you still want to kill him?\u201d\u201cMy position. Knowing that he\u2019s right under my watch and not killing him, I feel like I\u2019m not doing my part.\u201d\u201cYou have some sort of principles?\u201d\u201cTo Sheng Nong I do.\u201d\u201cLaughable!\u201d\u201cIt is laughable, and even I think I\u2019m pretty pathetic. If I didn\u2019t have principles, then I would go talk to the Yellow Emperor and personally lead him to destroy Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Liu was silent and looked up at the crescent moon like a biscuit with a bite taken out of it. After a long time, he asked \u201cWhat is General Gong Gong like? To lead to a demon like you giving him your allegiance?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot!\u201d Xiang Liu quieted down for awhile and then said \u201cHe is a pathetic idiot. He leads a bunch of idiots, doing something pathetic.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cThe most pathetic one is you! They are all willing to do it, they don\u2019t think they are idiots. They think they are doing something they would be proud of to tell their family in the grave. To let their descendants be proud. They are happy to go down in a blaze of glory. But you \u2013 you mock it yet you do it.\u201d\u201cWho let me have nine-heads? Of course it gets complicated and contradictory.\u201dXiao Liu couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud and almost swallowed water and quickly grabbed Xiang Liu\u2019s arm \u201cYou\u2026..you\u2026.didn\u2019t you say you hate people mentioning you are a nine-headed demon? The nine-heads is your big sore spot. If anyone mentioned it, you would kill them.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still alive.\u201dXiao Liu mumbled \u201cFor now\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat I loathe is that when they discuss me, they look down on me as strange and weird. I let you discuss it because\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiang Liu turned to the side and propped his arm under his head and looked at Xiao Liu \u201cyou may laugh at me but deep down inside you don\u2019t think a nine-headed demon is strange.\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cThat\u2019s because I used to be even more weird than you.\u201d\u201cSo you hid in the mountains and refused to see anyone?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dXiang Liu lightly stroked Xiao Liu\u2019s head and he stared on shock back at Xiang Liu \u201cIs this considered having a heart-to-heart under the moonlight?\u201dXiang Liu replied \u201cUntil the next time you anger me, then yes.\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u201cPeaceful times are short, just like happiness is momentary. Flowers bloom and wilt, the moon waxes and wanes. But the beauty in life is merely this.\u201dXiang Liu snarked \u201cWho said once that even the most beautiful view would grow old with time?\u201d Xiao Liu smiled and said nothing. It was sunrise by the time Xiao Liu got home soaking wet.He dried his hair and thought about taking a nap since Tian Er was manning the clinic. In the middle of a nap, he heard knocking on the door but yelled for them to scram. Then came more knocking and then the door was kicked open.Xiao Liu angrily stuck his head out and wanted to throw something but looked up and saw Ah Nian standing there. Her face was tear streaked and she was angrily looking at Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu immediately woke up \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ah Nian started crying \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m here? I would rather never see your face again.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s mind twirled and he jumped down \u201cWhat happened to Xuan?\u201dAh Nian turned around \u201cGege is injured. The doctor can\u2019t stop the bleeding. Gege asked me to come find you.\u201d Xiao Liu grabbed clothes and put it on as he ran out. He know understood why Xiang Liu came to see him yesterday. It wasn\u2019t for a moonlight heart-to-heart. When he was in so much pain he lost all strength and couldn\u2019t move, the same thing happened to Xuan. But Xuan was well protected, and Xiang Liu was with Xiao Liu. Who could break through the Xuan Yuan guards and harm Xuan?Arriving at the wine shop, Xiao Liu didn\u2019t bother with the front door and vaulted over the walls into the back. Guards came up but Hai Tang yelled for them to halt. She led Xiao Liu to a room where Xuan laid inside, his eyes closed and his face ashen.Hai Tang shook him awake while Ah Nian cried \u201cGege, are you better?\u201dXuan smiled at her gently \u201cI\u2019m fine. You didn\u2019t sleep at all last night, go sleep now.\u201d He glanced at Hai Tang who walked over and literally carried and coaxed Ah Nian out the door.Xuan introduced the doctor Wu Cheng, a famous physician in town who specialized in external injuries. Xiao Liu looked at Xuan\u2019s injury, a chest wound that wasn\u2019t very big but the bleeding wouldn\u2019t stop. Wu Cheng explained \u201cLast night an a.s.sa.s.sin came. The guards protected the young master but suddenly an arrow came from the sky when the young master was also suddenly struck with extreme pain. Thank G.o.d a servant pushed him aside so the arrow didn\u2019t hit a critical organ. The problem is that it won\u2019t stop bleeding.\u201dXiao Liu looked at the wound while Wu Cheng added \u201cI tested hundreds of different poisons and it\u2019s not a poison.\u201dXiao Liu asked to see the arrow which was an ordinary wood arrow that was now snapped in half. Xiao Liu countered \u201cIt can\u2019t be an ordinary arrow, it was shot from far away using tremendous force. An ordinary arrow would have shattered already in flight.\u201dXiao Liu asked Xuan \u201cWhat did you feel when the arrow pierced you?\u201d Xuan closed his eyes \u201cIn that moment, my body hurt, my chest was in pain, and cold\u2026.I felt a cold enter my body.\u201dXiao Liu continued \u201cHave you been to the North Pole?\u201d Xuan smiled \u201cNo, have you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been. That place is always blanketed in snow, and then the layers of snow press down it becomes ice, and then the ice is pressed down it becomes glaciers. The glaciers are harder than the rocks in the vast wilderness. Even the sharpest blade striking it will only loosen some debris. After tens of thousands of years, there will be ice crystals in the glaciers as beautiful as precious gems but harder than any mineral. It will always release cold air.Xuan asked \u201cWill ice crystals melt?\u201d\u201cNormally no, but since its still ice-based then theoretically yes.\u201dXuan slowly understood \u201cYou\u2019re saying someone used a special method to wrap a layer of ice crystal around an ordinary arrow, and when the arrow pierced me the ice crystal melted leaving only the ordinary arrow.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how to manipulate ice crystal so it melts when it touches blood, but that\u2019s likely what happened.\u201d\u201cThe ice crystal from the North plus the extraordinary archery skills, it must be the Fang Feng family!\u201d Wu Cheng yelled anxiously \u201cI\u2019ll go find them, they made the arrow, they will know how to stop the bleeding.\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Xuan\u2019s voice was filled with scorn \u201cHow do you prove it was them? A lot of people in the vast wilderness can shoot an arrow, and this arrow can be bought anywhere.\u201dWu Cheng thought about it and dejectedly lowered his head. If it was the Fang Feng family, then it had to be the best archer Miss Fang Feng. She could be dealt with, but behind her stood the Tu Shan clan, one of the Four Great Clans of the vast wilderness. Even an Emperor had to be wary.Xuan asked Xiao Liu \u201cWhy can\u2019t my bleeding stop?\u201d Xiao Liu touched his blood and put it in his mouth to taste. Xuan saw it and his heart skipped a beat and he quietly composed himself. Xiao Liu said \u201cLikely this ice crystal has something mixed in and when it melted it is preventing your blood from coagulating.\u201dWu Chen stared \u201cWhat is it, I used all sorts of herbs but cannot stop the bleeding.\u201d Xiao Liu conceded \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Wu Cheng was about to start raging when Xiao Liu added \u201cBut I know how to get rid of it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Wu Cheng anxiously asked.\u201cAnything dark will disappear in the light, use sun powered water from the holy Yang Valley, it cleanses anything.\u201d \u201cThe water from the holy Yang Valley is hard to obtain and the batch we have is used up. The Valley is thousands of miles away, rus.h.i.+ng there the bleeding will get worse and Master won\u2019t even make it there alive.\u201dXiao Liu explained \u201cI have a way to slow down the bleeding so you can make it there. But it\u2019s going to be painful.\u201d Xuan smiled \u201cDo tell.\u201d\u201cPut an ice crystal in your wound and let it freeze your blood and slow it down. But that is a thousand year ice crystal and you will be freezing all over.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s a way to live then being cold is not hard. But where to get an ice crystal, it must be hard to obtain from the glaciers?\u201dWu Cheng knew someone in town would have it \u201cGo ask for it from the Fang Feng family?\u201d He was surprised Xiao Liu agreed \u201cYup, go get it from them. But it\u2019s not ask, it\u2019s steal.\u201d\u201cSteal?\u201dXiao Liu stood up and said to Xuan \u201cDon\u2019t move, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Xuan offered \u201cI\u2019ll send two men with you.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled \u201cI\u2019m going to steal, not grab by force.\u201dXuan said slowly \u201cYou are very close to Tu Shan Jing, but that is a personal connection. In front of family allegiances, the personal ties mean nothing. This is actually my own problem and nothing to do with you. You don\u2019t need to\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t the voodoo bug in your body, that arrow wouldn\u2019t have been able to strike you. This situation arose from me, how can it have nothing to do with me? Okay, enough with the bull s.h.i.+t, I\u2019m off!\u201dXiao Liu rushed out and vaulted over the walls and was off. He ran to Jing\u2019s current residence and the servant gave him a dirty look before going to announce him. Soon two maids came out \u201cMy lady heard it was you, please come in, my lady and my lord will be here shortly.\u201dAfter walking down the corridor, a young woman in a red robe quickly walked over and stopped in front of Xiao Liu and bowed respectfully. In front of the servants she couldn\u2019t express it openly so she just said \u201cThank you.\u201d Her voice was filled with sincere grat.i.tude that Xiao Liu could feel her emotions.Xiao Liu bowed \u201cMy lady please get up.\u201d When she got up, he looked at Miss Fang Feng, and even using the most critical eye, he had no choice but to admit she was one elegant, well-mannered, gentle lady. She made one feel like taking care of her.Xiao Liu wondered \u201cDid she really shoot that arrow into Xuan?\u201d If it was her, why kill Xuan? What was her relations.h.i.+p with Xuan? Xiao Liu thought but his expression betrayed nothing as he smiled \u201cWhere is Master Jing?\u201dMiss Fang Feng replied \u201cSomeone went to get him already, I was going to the front salon to handle a matter so walked ahead. I wanted to thank you personally as soon as I could.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cI am very close with Master Jing, no need to wait for him. I\u2019ll go inside to see him.\u201d The maids all gave him a disgusted look but Miss Fang Feng didn\u2019t look peeved in the least and smiled \u201cSure.\u201dMiss Fang Feng led Xiao Liu inside to the residence where Xiao Liu once rested to heal from his injuries. Jing had just stepped out and was heading towards them. He saw Xiao Liu with Fang Feng Yi Yang, the two of them smiling and chatting, and that image made his eyes tense up.Yi Yang saw him and stopped, gently explaining \u201cMaster Liu said he wanted to see you directly so I brought him here.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled at Jing \u201cI have something personal to ask of you, let\u2019s discuss inside.\u201dJing replied \u201cOf course.\u201dHe turned inside and Yi Yang followed. Xiao Liu chatted about everything in the courtyard, acting like a country b.u.mpkin who had never seen anything before, but really he was looking for the ice crystal wind chimes but couldn\u2019t see it anywhere. Then he remembered it was Spring and there was no reason to have it out no matter how filthy rich Jing was.Just as Xiao Liu was trying to find a way to ask Jing for it without alerting Miss Fang Feng, suddenly he heard Jing say \u201cYi Yang, why don\u2019t you go back. I have something to say to Xiao Liu.\u201d Xiao Liu thought that Yi Yang was a very pretty name. Miss Fang Feng\u2019s smile froze on her face but then she immediately composed herself and gently said \u201cThen I\u2019ll go check in the kitchens to prepare a meal for Master Liu.\u201dMiss Fang Feng curtsied to Xiao Liu and walked out the courtyard. Jing looked at Xiao Liu who had his head lowered. He knew he couldn\u2019t keep anything from Jing.Jing gently asked \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201dXiao Liu tested the waters \u201cI want something from you.\u201d Jing didn\u2019t hesitate \u201cSure.\u201d\u201cAnything I want?\u201d\u201cIf I have it, you can have it. If I don\u2019t have it, I\u2019ll find it for you.\u201dXiao Liu looked up \u201cI want two ice crystal wind chimes.\u201d Jing immediately called Jing Ye over and gave her an order and she rushed off. Jing didn\u2019t ask what Xiao Liu needed the wind chimes for, only silently staring at him. His eyes were like black warm jade, sparkling with happiness, happy that Xiao Liu came to ask him for something.Xuan warned Xiao Liu not to trust Jing, but Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t believe Jing would kill anyone so he got up his courage \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026.I want\u2026..\u201dJing leaned forward to hear what Xiao Liu was saying and the medicinal herb scent he was wearing enveloped Xiao Liu who wanted to back up but Jing grabbed his hand \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Xiao Liu lowered his head and stared at his feet before mumbling \u201cI want to ask you, under any circ.u.mstances, to never hurt Xuan.\u201dJing softly sighed as if he was disappointed yet also happy \u201cFine.\u201dXiao Liu raised his head in shock \u201cYou agree?\u201dJing nodded \u201cI promised to listen to whatever you want.\u201dXiao Liu thought now that a.s.sa.s.sinating Xuan must be the sole idea of Fang Feng Yi Yang. Jing appeared to know nothing about what Fang Feng Yi Yang was up to. She did something so big and never told him?Xiao Liu wanted to say something to warn Jing, but Fang Feng Yi Yang was Jing\u2019s fiancee. To speak about her behind her back in front of Jing was a very dastardly thing to do. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t care to do that so swallowed his words.Xiao Liu tried to pull his hand back but Jing wouldn\u2019t let go.Jing Ye walked over and saw Jing holding Xiao Liu\u2019s hand. Her knees almost buckled and she almost dropped the box she was carrying. She composed herself and handed the box to Xiao Liu \u201cThere are two sets of ice crystal wind chimes in here. The crystals have been processed so the cold has been greatly diminished. Not sure if the Master needs it for something so I also put inside two pieces of raw ice crystals. If one does not have enough spiritual power, don\u2019t handle it otherwise your fingers will freeze off.\u201dXiao Liu pulled free from Jing\u2019s hand and took the box \u201cThank you.\u201d Jing Ye looked annoyed and glared at Xiao Liu as if saying 'scram, stop bothering my lord!\u201dXiao Liu smiled and pinched her cheek \u201cMy beauty, don\u2019t be angry, I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d Jing Ye touched her cheek and stared in shock at Xiao Liu. Jing merely smiled at Xiao Liu. Jing Ye felt so insulted \u201cMy lord, he\u2026.he touched me!\u201dXiao Liu grabbed Jing Ye\u2019s hand \u201cTake me the short cut way out the back door.\u201d Jing Ye turned to ask Jing to save her but Jing said \u201cHis orders are my orders, do it.\u201d Jing Ye\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed but she didn\u2019t dare disobey. She took Xiao Liu through the short cut and out the residence.When Xiao Liu got back to the wine shop, Wu Cheng had everyone all packed up and was ready to leave. Xiao Liu handed over the box and had Wu Cheng put two ice crystals in Xuan\u2019s wound. The area around the wound started to turn white and then there appeared to be a layer of ice on it, freezing the arteries and veins to slow the blood flow down.Wu Cheng\u2019s face lit up \u201cIt worked!\u201dXiao Liu gave Wu Cheng the remaining ice crystals and Wu Cheng didn\u2019t have a minute to waste and immediately had Xuan carried onto the cloud carriage. Ah Nian and Hai Tang also got on another cloud carriage.Ah Nian ordered \u201cDepart!\u201dXuan called out \u201cWait! Xiao Liu, come here. I have something to say to you!\u201dXiao Liu walked over and Xuan said \u201cThis parting, I will likely not be returning.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cToo many people want to kill you here, you shouldn\u2019t come back.\u201dXuan continued \u201cYou promised me that when I was leaving Qing Shui Town you would remove the bug\u2026\u2026so come with me. With your smarts and talent, you will be of great success anywhere.\u201d Xuan might not have told Xiao Liu his real ident.i.ty, but when Xiao Liu suggested going to Yang Valley for the sun water and Wu Cheng did not indicate any hards.h.i.+p with making that happen, then Xiao Liu ought to know that Xuan\u2019s ident.i.ty was not someone ordinary. He wasn\u2019t even merely lofty like the son of a n.o.ble family either. His invitation wasn\u2019t just to remove the bug, he wanted to give Xiao Liu what a man ought to aim for to achieve with his life.\u201cI want to stay in Qing s.h.i.+u Town and be a little doctor.\u201d Xiao Liu stepped back and carefully said \u201cYou are injured so I can\u2019t do what I promised yet, but don\u2019t worry, when you are healed I will write down how to get rid of the voodoo bug and give it to you. You have lots of talent around you, someone will be able to help you remove it.\u201dXuan might be hard to sweet talk, but twice Xiao Liu saved his life so he decided to let this one go for now. He sighed \u201cEveryone has their own goals. I won\u2019t force you. You take care!\u201dXiao Liu bowed \u201cWe both take care!\u201dWu Cheng closed the cloud carriage door and the servants got on their winged rides pulling the cloud carriage and it rose into the air headed due South.Xiao Liu raised his head and watched as the cloud carriage rose higher and higher until it became a black dot and disappeared into the clouds. He silently made a wish in his heart \u201cGege, I wish that you will achieve everything you want!\u201dAfter the wine shop had been closed for many days did the people in town hear that Xuan had left. Both people in town were used to people coming and going so didn\u2019t feel much of it. Sometimes men would miss Xuan\u2019s wine or lament not being able to see the beautiful Hai Tang. But to Xiao Liu, Xuan\u2019s departure made his life a whole lot easier. At least Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t keeping an eye on him, and before long the bustling Qing Shui Town resumed its normal routine.A month later the wine shop reopened for business but it wasn\u2019t as busy as before. When Xiao Liu pa.s.sed by he would go buy some wine but he would never see Xuan with his fake warm smile behind the counter.One night, Xiang Liu vaulted off the condor to find Xiao Liu sitting cross-legged on the gra.s.s, his two arms resting on his thighs, his body hunched forward, staring dejectedly at the river.Xiang Liu asked \u201cWhat you are thinking?\u201d\u201cHow to remove that voodoo bug. Xuan\u2019s follower came by once to ask.\u201d With Xuan\u2019s real ident.i.ty, that bug might not hurt him, but it was more likely one day it\u2019ll kill Xiao Liu since so many people wanted to kill Xuan. Xiao Liu also didn\u2019t want people to use him anymore against Xuan so was genuinely racking his brains for how to remove it.Xiang Liu said \u201cI told you, find another person and plant the bug there.\u201d\u2018\u201dWho would be willing? Maybe one of Xuan\u2019s men?\u201dXiang Liu very casually said \u201cIt can\u2019t be just any person.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou raised the bug, you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..I don\u2019t know.\u201d Xiao Liu confessed.\u201cWhere did you get the bug?\u201d\u201cMany years ago, I met an old lady from the Jiu Li tribe. You know that the legendary most fearless, vicious, cruel demon of all time Qi Yo was from the Jiu Li tribe. After he was killed by the Yellow Emperor, the entire Jiu Li tribe was demoted to slave status. The men and women were born into slavery. That old woman was a slave that no one wanted anymore. She was smelly and dirty, laying close to death in a pile of dirt. I found her very pitiful so I asked her what her final wish was before she died. She asked for a bath so she could go see her lover clean and pretty. I took her to the river and helped her bath, then brushed her hair into the hairstyle of a Jiu Li woman. She gave me a blackened shriveled walnut, saying that she had nothing on her except this pair of voodoo bugs. She gave it to me as thanks. She told me to leave and then she died. Her body immediately attracted a lot of insects and was immediately devoured clean. Later on, when I didn\u2019t know how to deal with you, I suddenly remembered this walnut I carried with me for a long time. I used it to raise the two voodoo bugs according to the magic of Jiu Li. I fed it pieces of my own flesh and blood, then one bug chose me, and then other was meant for you but instead I planted it in Xuan.\u201d\u201cHow did you learn how to raise a voodoo bug?\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s eyes twirled \u201cThat old woman told me!\u201d Xiang Liu coldly laughed \u201cYou\u2019re full of s.h.i.+t. If she told you how to raise the bugs, how could she not have told you what the name of this particular voodoo bug was?\u201dXiao Liu knew what he said was contradictory so just went with it \u201cWhy do you care how I know how to raise voodoo bugs. I just do.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cThe pair of voodoo bugs you have is very rare. If you want to remove it, the only way is to find another person and lure the bug into that person.\u201d\u201cWhat are the requirements for that person?\u201dXiang Liu said nothing, and after a moment, he stiffly barked \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201dXiao Liu didn\u2019t believe him, yet he didn\u2019t know why Xiang Liu wouldn\u2019t come out and tell him. So he tried asking \u201cDo you fit the requirement?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t answer so Xiao Liu asked more \u201cYou are a nine-headed demon. Luring a voodoo bug into you, that can\u2019t be a problem, right?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t deny it so Xiao Liu took that as a tacit confirmation. Xiao Liu got all excited \u201cYou said with your nine-heads, even if my body hurt then it wouldn\u2019t hurt you much, right? So can I lure the bug over into your body?\u201dXiang Liu stood there with his hands behind his back, staring at the moon, saying nothing. After a few moments he said \u201cI can help you lure the bug into me, but you have to promise that in the future you will do one thing for me. If I ask, you will do it.\u201dXiao Liu thought about it \u201cOther than killing Xuan.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cI also can\u2019t kill Tu Shan Jing.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t ask me to kill the Yellow Emperor or the Grand Emperor.\u201dXiang Liu said incredulously \u201cMy nine-heads would need to flooded with water for me to think you can kill the Yellow Emperor or the Grand Emperor.\u201dXiao Liu wasn\u2019t mad but asked again \u201cThe answer is\u2026..\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201dXiao Liu yelled \u201cThen it\u2019s a deal!\u201dXiang Liu raised his palm and Xiao Liu clapped it to strike the deal \u201cI promise that if Xiang Liu helps me remove the voodoo bug from Xuan, I agree to do one thing he asks of me.\u201dXiang Liu coldly asked \u201cWhat happens if you break the promise?\u2019Xiao Liu thought \u201cThe Heavens strike me into pieces. With your personality that won\u2019t be enough. What do you think should happen to me?\u201d\u201cIf you break the promise, whatever you love will turn into pain, whatever you enjoy will turn into bitterness.\u201dXiao Liu felt gooseb.u.mps run down his spine \u201cYou\u2019re sure vicious!\u201d He raised his palm to swear the promise \u201cIf I break this promise, then whatever I love will bring me pain, whatever I enjoy will turn bitter.\u201d He put down his hand and thumped his chest \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dXiang Liu had a slight smile on his lips \u201cWhat do I have to worry about? If you can\u2019t do it, you\u2019re the one suffering.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cThen tell me now, how to remove the bug?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! Don\u2019t you know how to lure the bug into a person?\u201dXiao Liu closed his eyes and his lips started speaking wordlessly as if reciting a chant. After some time \u201cThere is a way, but you and Xuan must be within a certain vicinity of each other before I can start the spell. Right now it\u2019s too far.\u201dUsing this method, they had to make a visit to Gao Xing Kingdom\u2019s royal capital Five G.o.ds Mountain. But Xiang Liu\u2019s ident.i.ty, he\u2019s not someone who could ever just saunter into Five G.o.ds Mountain.Xiao Liu was fretting and begged \u201cYou promised me.\u201d Xiang Liu summoned Furball and vaulted on \u201cGet up here!\u201d Xiao Liu was ecstatic and climbed on the back of the condor. Furball took them South and after flying for a night and some hours they were close to Gao Xing\u2019s Five G.o.ds Mountain.Xiang Liu knew the security was tight at Five G.o.ds Mountain. Even with his power it was still impossible to remain undetected. He gave up riding Furball and dived into the ocean with Xiao Liu.The ocean was like Xiang Liu\u2019s home and he swam like a shark rocketing straight ahead through the waves. Xiao Liu tried to keep up but couldn\u2019t. Xiang Liu swam back \u201cAt your speed we can\u2019t get there even in three days and three nights.\u201d Xiao Liu grumbled \u201cEven if I\u2019m the best swimmer I\u2019m still a land lubber. You were a nine-headed demon born in the ocean, how can I compare to you.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cThis is where the Grand Emperor lives so we can only reach it via the ocean to remain undetected.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dXiang Liu said with resignation \u201cGet on my back, I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d Xiao Liu bit down on his lip to keep from laughing. That would mean he was treating Xiang Liu like his personal ride. Xiang Liu appeared to read his mind and glared \u201cBack to Qing Shui Town.\u201d He turned and swam North.Xiao Liu immediately grabbed him tightly around the waist \u201cI promise to stop thinking nonsense.\u201dBoth of their bodies were rigid, and then Xiang Liu slowly turned around and Xiao Liu quickly let go. Xiang Liu glanced at him \u201cWant to go or not?\u201d\u201cGo. Go!\u201d Xiao Liu climbed on Xiang Liu\u2019s back and grabbed him around the shoulder. Xiang Liu said \u201cThe speed will be fast. Hold on tight!\u201dXiao Liu clasped his two hands tightly together, but Xiang Liu appeared worried that Xiao Liu wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on so each of his hands grabbed Xiao Liu\u2019s wrist and then he was off like a shooting arrow.Xiang Liu was like the son of the sea, riding the waves more fluid than a dolphin, more powerful than a shark, more elegant than a mermaid. Xiao Liu never felt his body this light before, it was like riding through the clouds and just as thrilling. Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t open his eyes so could only use his ears to hear the thunderous booming. Many times he was almost swept away by the waves but thankfully Xiang Liu was tightly holding onto his wrist so he could always still hold on.In the end Xiao Liu didn\u2019t even bother to think and used his hands and feet to tightly cling onto Xiang Liu so he wasn\u2019t washed away by his speed. After some time, Xiang Liu slowed down and Xiao Liu opened his eyes. He saw that they were in a tight cl.u.s.ter of fish on brightly colored hues, swimming around like colored ribbons waving in the wind. Xiao Liu reached out and they weren\u2019t scared and swam through his fingers.Xiang Liu\u2019s voice was in Xiao Liu\u2019s ear \u201cWe\u2019re at Five G.o.ds Mountain. It ought to be close to where Zhuan Xu is. You can try calling the bug into my body.\u201dXiao Liu felt the fish pulling his lower body along so he could move with ease. He took out a blackened walnut and bit his own middle finger. He smeared the blood on the walnut and then handed it to Xiang Liu and indicated he do the same. Xiang Liu pierced his middle finger and smeared blood on the other half of the walnut and handed it back to Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu indicated for Xiang Liu to raise the hand that was b.l.o.o.d.y and point it towards Five G.o.ds Mountain. Xiao Liu said \u201cYou relax, and if possible, feel genuine happiness to welcome the bug to your body.\u201dXiao Liu tightly clasped the walnut to his chest and started chanting, summoning the bug in his own body. After some time, Xiao Liu felt his own heart start to beat wildly, and incredibly he felt another heart beating as well. The two hearts were like friends who had not seen each other in a long time, beating wildly in joy to be together. Xiao Liu reached out his hand and pressed it on Xiang Liu\u2019s chest, and it was indeed the sound of Xiang Liu\u2019s heart.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t believe it \u201cThe bug is planted into your body? That fast?\u201dXiang Liu rolled his eyes at Xiao Liu \u201cSomeone like you dared to control a bug? A truly powerful voodoo master could summon a bug tens of thousands of miles away to kill someone. Do you think all bugs are like you, slow poke like ambling across mountains and ridges?\u201d\u201cEh\u201d Xiao Liu felt something strange in his palm. He opened it to find the walnut glowing and then gradually melting into splashes of color. It was like little fireflies dancing around Xiao Liu and Xiang Liu. Half of each went into Xiao Liu and Xiang Liu\u2019s palms and disappeared.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t believe it and shook his hands a few times but it really just disappeared.Xiao Liu\u2019s expression grew dark and he said to Xiang Liu \u201cI have a bad feeling about this. This bug is sooooo strange. It\u2019s not as simple as I thought it was.\u201dBut then Xiao Liu didn\u2019t feel anything weird in his body so asked Xiang Liu \u201cHow do you feel?\u201dXiang Liu was very calm and looked upward \u201cI feel like we need to run away now.\u201d The bug summoning could not be done under concealment so it had alerted the guards in Five G.o.ds Mountain. Xiang Liu grabbed Xiao Liu and sank into the ocean and started swimming away from Five G.o.ds Mountain.All the fishes in the ocean came to help and created a maze to block and distract the Gao Xing soldiers and lead them astray. Xiang Liu held Xiao Liu\u2019s hand and swam in the silent eerie bottom of the ocean. Every time Xiao Liu ran out of oxygen, Xiang Liu would pa.s.s a breath of air to him.The bottom of the ocean was more colorful than on land, with fishes of any shape and color and lots of strange creatures. Xiao Liu stared at everything with wonder and Xiang Liu did not rush him along. The G.o.ds loved to use pearls and jellyfish to make lamps so Xiao Liu saw many of those in the palace but it was the first time she saw a living jellyfish. It\u2019s body was clear and it was fluid, like a natural lantern. It would be an insult to it not to make it into a lamp.A huge sea conch with brilliant hued sh.e.l.l, Xiao Liu tapped it wondering what its meat tasted like and Xiang Liu said \u201cIt\u2019s not tasty.\u201dThere was actually gra.s.s growing in the ocean, tall and so green it looked black, billowing in the waves without end. Xiang Liu took Xiao Liu walking through the ocean gra.s.s plains and he saw a pair of seahorses laying on the plains.There was all sorts of flowers growing in the ocean as well and it was like a rainbow so bright. He tried to touch one only to have it spring teeth and try to bite back. So the flowers were predators, too, and Xiao Liu glared at Xiang Liu for not warning him. Xiang Liu smirked and then picked up Xiao Liu\u2019s hand and then held it to touch the \u201cflowers\u201d again. This time the flowers were s.h.i.+vering with fear and Xiao Liu laughed before kicking those \u201cflowers\u201d a few times for good measure.Xiao Liu knew they were being chased by Gao Xing soldiers but never felt in danger. Because Xiang Liu was so calm that it didn\u2019t feel like they were on the run, it felt rather like Xiang Liu was taking him on a stroll through the ocean. They swam for so long underwater but Xiao Liu was really happy and the time didn\u2019t feel long. It wasn\u2019t until they were completely free of the chasing Gao Xing soldiers that Xiang Liu took Xiao Liu up to the surface.The gold crowned white condor Furball flew over and Xiang Liu carried Xiao Liu and vaulted on its back. They rode the condor back to Qing Shui Town and Xiao Liu felt hungry and tired. He tightly grabbed onto Furball\u2019s neck and said to Xiang Liu \u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap.\u201dXiao Liu promptly fell fast asleep.Xiang Liu sat on the back of the condor and looked out over the vast cloud sea, his face as calm as a placid water surface without any joy or sorrow. After a long time, he looked down at Xiao Liu in blissful slumber and his hand slowly pressed on his own heart. A smile appeared on the corner of his lips before it swiftly pa.s.sed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But knowing Xiao Liu, he\u2019s not going to go back that easily. To says he is literally dragged back kicking and screaming is pretty accurate given the lengths he goes to avoid becoming a Princess again. I think her relations.h.i.+p with s.h.i.+ Qi has always been unequal, with her saving him being such a pivotal moment in his life, whereas it doesn\u2019t have the same significance for Xiao Liu. s.h.i.+ Qi adorably does whatever she wants, and has even saved Xiao Liu once already when Xuan had her locked up. With his wealth and connections, he can do anything and everything for her to a certain extent, but how will he choose when push comes to shove and he\u2019s asked to choose between Xiao Liu and potentially p.i.s.sing off an Emperor and an entire Kingdom? Too many people in Xiao Liu\u2019s life have chosen sacrificing for many over sacrificing for her, and even if their choice is understandable and correct, Xiao Liu really needs and deserves someone who puts him first. This will be the first major test for s.h.i.+ Qi, and whether he pa.s.ses will flying colors will mark a huge transition point on his relations.h.i.+p with Xiao Liu.Chapter 8 \u2013 It\u2019s So Late, Why Have You Not Returned:After removing the voodoo bug from Xuan, Xiao Liu resolved a big worry and soundly slept for three days.After he had time to think about it, he realized that he forgot to ask Xiang Liu last time whether the person who tried to kill Xuan was Jing\u2019s fiancee. Why would she help Xiang Liu kill Xuan? Was there a connection between the Fang Feng family and the Sheng Nong resistance army? Or was it Xiang Liu helping Fang Feng Yi Yang this time? Didn\u2019t Xiang Liu say he was a killer for hire during his free time?Xiao Liu thought and thought and couldn\u2019t eat or slept. But after a few days, he figured it out. Xuan left already so it didn\u2019t matter if Fang Feng Yi Yang wanted to kill him. The vengeance and conflict of those big families is not something Xiao Liu wanted to understand. All he needed to know was that it wasn\u2019t Jing who wanted to kill Xuan.Xiao Liu put everything aside and went back to living his lazy life.It was the middle of Summer and Xiao Liu was laying on the pallet fanning himself and covered in sweat. Jing entered from the back door and found Xiao Liu fanning himself under the awning and muttering \u201cSo hot! So hot!\u201dJing walked up and hung a blue ice crystal wind chime on the awning and within moments a cool breeze misted down from above and dispelled the heat. Xiao Liu looked at the wind chime and considered whether to accept it. He already asked for two, to not accept the third seemed rather coy. But the first two were meant to save Xuan\u2019s life and Xiao Liu felt it was important and not personal. This was for himself and made him feel like he was taking something.Jing sat down next to the pallet and watched Xiao Liu\u2019s facial expression changes. Xiao Liu suddenly sat up and hollered angrily \u201cThis is Qing Shui Town, not Qing Qiu! Why haven\u2019t you left yet?\u201dJing stared at Xiao Liu \u201cYou are here, I won\u2019t leave.\u201dXiao Liu was so angry he threw the fan at Jing. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you would listen to me. Then leave! Leave far far away and stop bothering my life. You are Tu Shan Jing, not Ye s.h.i.+ Qi!\u201dJing lowered his eyes and pursed his lips tightly. Xiao Liu was very familiar with this sight and didn\u2019t have the heart to be mean anymore. He turned his head away and refused to look at him.After some time, Jing\u2019s voice spoke \u201cYou tenderly cleaned my wounds. You carefully washed my hair. You patiently fed me medicine and food. You gently bathed my body. You were afraid I was in pain so you talked with me. You were afraid I was ashamed so you told me jokes. You were afraid I would give up so you described the beautiful views for me. You were afraid I was lonely so you told me interesting stories. You didn\u2019t just heal my body, you saved my soul. You will never be able to imagine how much I wish I were Ye s.h.i.+ Qi. But I have no choice but to be Tu Shan Jing. Because of this, more than you I hate myself. I know you hate Tu Shan Jing so I control myself not to come visit you. But I\u2019m scared to leave. You gave Ma Zi a family, you found Xan Tian Er for Chuan Zi, you set up everything for Lao Mu. You are already prepared to leave it all behind and continue wandering. I\u2019m afraid if I turn around even for a second, I won\u2019t be able to find you ever again.\u201dThis was the first time Jing spoke so much and the atmosphere was very solemn. He silently looked at Xiao Liu but Xiao Liu never turned around. Jing finally got up and quietly left.Xiao Liu suddenly collapsed on the pallet and stared at the wind chime. s.h.i.+ Qi saw through it, that he was planning to leave. Someone walked into the yard and Xiao Liu covered his eyes and said in annoyance \u201cI\u2019m resting, don\u2019t bother me!\u201dThe person didn\u2019t speak and just sat down on the pallet being so still that if it wasn\u2019t that his body didn\u2019t have the scent of medicinal herbs, Xiao Liu almost thought it was Jing who left and came back.Xiao Liu moved his hands and squinted, then his eyed popped wide open. It was Xuan!Xiao Liu stammered \u201cYou\u2026what are you doing here? I already removed the bug. You ought to have been able to feel it. If you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll p.r.i.c.k myself right now.\u201d Xiao Liu looked around for something to p.r.i.c.k himself but Xuan stopped him with a smile.\u201cI know the bug has been removed. I\u2019m here for another reason.\u201d\u201cAnother reason.\u201d\u201cMy Master wants to see you.\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s heart raced and his body weakened but he forced himself to smile \u201cWhy does your Master want to see me? And who says that if he wants to see me, I will go see him.\u201dXuan stood up \u201cMy real name is Zhuan Xu. Xuan Yuan Zhuan Xu. I am the eldest grandson of the Yellow Emperor of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom. My Master is the Grand Emperor of the Gao Xing Kingdom.\u201dXiao Liu didn\u2019t know how to react so feigned fear \u201cSuch lofty personages! I am from Qing Shui Town and not a citizen of either Xuan Yuan or Gao Xing Kingdoms.\u201dXuan said \u201cWhen I was healing in Yang Valley, my Master came to see me. I told him about you and for some reason he was very interested and asked me to tell him every single detail about my interactions with you. After he heard it all, he asked to meet you. He specifically ordered me to come take you to Gao Xing to meet him.\u201dXiao Liu immediately said \u201cI\u2019m not going!\u201dXuan sighed \u201cThis is an Imperial Summons, you can\u2019t refuse. Xiao Liu, don\u2019t make it hard for me, I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201dXiao Liu immediately switched tactics and smiled \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll go with you to Gao Xing, but you have to give me half a day to pack and say my farewells.\u201d Xuan knew Xiao Liu\u2019s sneaky and slippery personality, and he also knew that a lot of people knew his real ident.i.ty in Qing Shui Town so Xuan couldn\u2019t stay long either.Xiao Liu begged \u201cI saved you twice. You are a Xuan Yuan Prince, how can you treat a savior this way?\u201dXuan was too smart for that and laughed \u201cThe first time you saved me, it was after you plotted with Xiang Liu to ambush me. I let it go means I let you off the hook that time. If you didn\u2019t plant a voodoo bug in me, then the second time wouldn\u2019t have happened and there would be no need for you to save me. Ah Nian is the Gao Xing Princess, and you\u2019ve insulted and shamed her multiple times. You know she is dying to kill you and I\u2019ve been the one keeping her at bay. This time going to Gao Xing, if you fall into her hands and she tries to kill you, don\u2019t you want me to protect you? Who is whose savior is not clear here. \u201dXiao Liu griped \u201cIf I don\u2019t go to Gao Xing in the first place, then I won\u2019t need your protection.\u201dXuan said \u201cThere are two more hours until sunset and I\u2019ve give you until then to pack your bags and say farewells. We\u2019ll leave before dark, and if you try anything\u2026.\u201d Xuan waved his hand and the entire pallet shattered into smithereens and Xiao Liu fell on the floor.Last time when Xuan was in Qing Shui Town, he always tried to use Xuan\u2019s side to solve problems. This time he was here as Zhuan Xu, and he was a Xuan Yuan Prince. Xiao Liu stared at Zhuan Xu as he stood there with his hands behind his back, an unwavering authority in his eyes. Xiao Liu suddenly felt a sense of comfort. It was good that Zhuan Xu was like this \u2013 at times warm and personable, but then able to flip a switch and be cold and ruthless. It was only this way that he could have survived in the precarious position he occupied.Xiao Liu stood up and went into his room to pack but his mind was racing. There was no way he was going to see the Grand Emperor. He can fool Zhuan Xu, but there was no way he could fool the Grand Emperor. But how to escape when Zhuan Xu came specifically to get him and brought a lot of men. Plus he was under Gao Xing orders and could immediately call Gao Xing troops outside town. And if needs be, he can call on his ident.i.ty as the Xuan Yuan Prince and use Xuan Yuan troops nearby as well.Even though Xiao Liu could change his face and form, but he was now under surveillance by a G.o.d and if there wasn\u2019t anyone to block for him to avert their attention, then even if he changed forms he couldn\u2019t escape.Xiao Liu decided he couldn\u2019t escape by his ability alone, he needed help. Right now he really missed Xiang Liu. Only Xiang Liu could care less about Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing authority, plus he could go hide in the Sheng Nong army base to run away from Zhuan Xu. But after their Gao Xing trip Xiao Liu hadn\u2019t seen Xiang Liu and there wasn\u2019t any time to summon him for help.The only one left was Tu Shan Jing. The Tu Shan clan businesses blanketed the vast wilderness, including selling to the Sheng Nong resistance army. They had to have secret pa.s.sages to move items in and out of town. But right now the Grand Emperor of Gao Xing and the Xuan Yuan Prince both wanted him. If Tu Shan Jing helped him, then he would be making an enemy out of the entire world. Would Tu Shan Jing be willing to make an enemy of both Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing for one little Wen Xiao Liu?The moment this thought popped into his head, Xiao Luu suddenly wanted to know Jing\u2019s choice even more than he wanted to escape Qing Shui Town. Xiao Liu looked at the ice crystal wind chime and smiled coldly. Whatever Jing chose to do, once Xiao Liu asked then he\u2019ll know.Xiao Liu walked out and saw Tian Er memorizing medicinal herb concoctions. He said to her \u201cI\u2019m leaving Hui Chun Clinic in your hands. If Lao Mu is sad, tell him people come and go and having traveled a distance together is already enough.\u201dTears came to Tian Er\u2019s eyes and she silently knelt down to bow to Xiao Liu \u201cBe filial to Lao Mu, you are a smart girl so overlook Chun Tao\u2019s pettiness at times. Life is unpredictable and Ma Zi and Chun Tao can only rely on you and Chuan Zi, and you and Chuan Zi can only rely on Ma Zi and Chun Tao.\u201dXiao Liu turned and walked out quickly. Leaving Hui Chun Clinic, whether or not he could successfully escape town, he would never be able to return here again. Close to 30 years of companions.h.i.+p had ended. Perhaps the next time paths crossed would be in front of Ma Zi and Chuan Zi\u2019s graves.Xiao Liu walked down the street and greeted all the neighbors. In the past 20 some years he was a well liked person and everyone smiled back at him. One called \u201cBrother Liu, a hot out of the oven meat pie, have one!\u201d Another called \u201cBrother Liu, thanks for the headache reliever last time.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled back and responded to each and every person. Even if he walked down the same road tens of years later, even if the places didn\u2019t change, no one would be greeting him at that time.Xiao Liu arrived at Jing\u2019s residence and entered through the back and immediately told the guard who he was. A guard went to get Jing Ye who arrived furious with a \u201cyou again!\u201d glare.Xiao Liu smirked \u201cSorry to bother you, I\u2019m here to see your young master.\u201d Jing Ye rolled her eyes and turned to leave and Xiao Liu followed. It was just like last year, with flowers blooming everywhere and lots of ice crystal wind chimes hanging along the corridors to cool the air.Jing Ye brought Xiao Liu to a study and inside Jing sat at a desk listening to two retainers give a report. Xiao Liu stepped back and enjoyed the flowers while the conversation finished inside. Jing Ye went inside to announce Xiao Liu and Jing came out and asked \u201cWhat happened?\u201dXiao Liu smiled wanly that Jing knew he wouldn\u2019t be here if there wasn\u2019t something he wanted. Xiao Liu turned around \u201cXuan Yuan\u2019s Prince Zhuan Xu is waiting for me at Hui Chun Clinic to take me to see the Grand Emperor of Gao Xing Kingdom.\u201dJing said slowly \u201cI will accompany you to Gao Xing. The Grand Emperor is a sage ruler, he would not be looking to harm you.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me if he\u2019s a sage ruler or not. I don\u2019t want to meet him!\u201dJing asked \u201cYou want to run away?\u201d Xiao Liu smiled \u201cYes, I want to run away.\u201dJing replied \u201cIt\u2019ll be very difficult.\u201dXiao Liu nodded with more smiles \u201cIt is very difficult, if it wasn\u2019t difficult I wouldn\u2019t be here with you. The Tu Shan clan must have a secret pa.s.sage way out of town. You help me escape.\u201d\u201cFine!\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s smile froze and he stared at Jing \u201cOnce escaped then its resisting an Imperial Summons from the Grand Emperor. Zhuan Xu will send people to track us down, and if we continue to resist he won\u2019t hesitate to kill. The road ahead will be perilous, and even if we escape, you will have made an enemy of both the Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan Kingdoms.Jing took Xiao Liu\u2019s hand and pulled him into the study and said to Jing Ye \u201cPrepare clothes, I\u2019m taking Xiao Liu and leaving Qing Shui Town.\u201dJing Ye must\u2019ve heard what they said and glared in rage at Xiao Liu but held it in \u201cMy lord there is no need for you to be in danger, I will have two men accompany Master Liu out of town. I will stake my life on protecting him.\u201dJing gently said \u201cPrepare clothes for us.\u201dJing Ye knew Jing made up his mind so didn\u2019t dare speak again and went to prepare the clothes.Jing Ye brought two sets of clothes and the two changed into it and arranged their hair so they appeared like messengers traveling from place to place. Jing Ye took out a box and inside were two dolls. It wasn\u2019t wood carved and was instead furry like an animal\u2019s tail. Xiao Liu was curious and wanted to touch but Jing Ye slapped his hand away \u201cThis is a doll made from the fox tail of a ten thousand year old nine-tailed fox. It\u2019s extremely rare. The nine-tailed fox is the best at transformation and the tail is where all the power gathers. These two tails have tens of thousands of years of power. Using it to make fake people, even if the dead former Emperors came back to life with their powers they wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\u201dJing p.r.i.c.ked his middle finger and touched the doll and it transformed into the exact replica of Jing. The fake Jing handed the other doll and gently told Xiao Liu \u201cIt needs a drop of your blood.\u201dIf Xiao Liu didn\u2019t just see it with his own eyes, he would think that fake Jing was real and the sitting real Jing was fake. He p.r.i.c.ked his finger on the doll which quickly got bigger and was the same size as Xiao Liu but its features were completely blank.Jing Ye was stunned \u201cHow can this be, this was a treasure left by the Tu Shan ancestors and I\u2019ve never heard of it transforming this way.\u201dXiao Liu nervously laughed \u201cProbably because I look so plain, the doll can\u2019t recognize it.\u201d Jing stood up and touched the fake Xiao Liu\u2019s face and arranged his features until it looked just like Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu sighed in relief \u201cFine, fine, it\u2019s all fine now.\u201dThe fake Xiao Liu doll laughed like Xiao Liu and spoke in the exact same voice as him \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you look like yourself, why blame me?\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s face turned white and he angrily threatened \u201cYou\u2019re a dead fox so shut up now before I burn you up!\u201dThe fake Xiao Liu huffed and walked over to the fake Jing, who actually patted him on the arm to comfort him. Xiao Liu stared in shock and Jing Ye said proudly \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t so alike then it wouldn\u2019t be a rare treasure, now would it.\u201dXiao Liu asked Jing what his plan was.\u201cLet them pretend to be two servants and leave with a batch of goods. We\u2019ll transform our looks and pretend to be messengers and leave town the other way with a group of departing messengers.\u201dJing Ye immediately cautioned \u201cThat\u2019s too dangerous. If Prince Zhuan Xu finds you guys missing, he will station men everywhere searching for people using G.o.dly powers. My lord\u2019s powers are all recovered and can mask it, but Master Liu can\u2019t.Jing ordered \u201cYou take them to change.\u201d Jing Ye knew he made up his mind and went with the two dolls.Jing walked up to Xiao Liu \u201cIf you change your looks, can it avoid all detection?\u201d Xiao Liu hesitated and then nodded. Jing smiled \u201cThen we\u2019ll go with the plan.\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s heart was thumping wildly \u201cYou\u2026.you always knew I could transform my face?\u201dThe power of transformation wasn\u2019t a very hard power to learn, but only those with great power using it can truly transform and avoid detection. With Xiao Liu\u2019s power, no one would believe him using the skill could avoid detection using a magical object seeker.Jing said \u201cThe Tu Shan clan aren\u2019t simply from the G.o.d tribe. One of our ancestors was the far-reaching original nine-tailed fox. So the bloodline of the Tu Shan family can all transform. I have the spiritual eye and can usually see through all transformation and masking spells and powers. That was how I was able to see Ah Nian\u2019s true face and knew to avoid her. But everything about you seems real even to me, except my instinct tells me your face is fake. So\u2026..that is why I can\u2019t leave you. If I leave and you disappeared, it would be without a trace.\u201dXiao Liu was stunned. Jing knew all along that he was fake.Jing Ye came back \u201cEveryone is prepared but there are people already stationed outside keeping watch on the residence, likely sent by Prince Zhuan Xu.\u201dJing Ye brought a carriage and she had transformed into an old man. The fake dolls got into the carriage first, and then Jing Ye opened a secret compartment underneath that could fit two people. Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi squeezed in and when Jing Ye leaned in to close it she whispered \u201cMy lord, he only let you stay for 6 years. Tu Shan clan can repay him another way. Why put yourself in danger?\u201dJing calmly said \u201cIn three days you go back to Qing Qiu, if I escape successfully then I will find you there. If not, you and Lan Xiang find a guy and get married.\u201d He closed the secret compartment.Jing Ye pursed her lips to restrain her sobs.The carriage started to move and it was dark and Xiao Liu and Jing were tightly pressed together due to its cramped s.p.a.ce. When Xiao Liu went to look for Jing, it was a spur of the moment thing. He wanted to see Jing put in a tight spot, he wanted to hear Jing try to talk him into going to see the Grand Emperor and it was no big deal. Xiao Liu wanted to hear all of this with his own ears, so that he could use this cruel method to cut the final threads of longing in his heart, so that he could leave without a care, so that he could let Wen Xiao Liu vanish forever without any sadness.But when Xiao Liu said he didn\u2019t want to go and Jing never asked why he would rather risk death to escape than go, nor did he pause to think about his own danger before agreeing to help him escape, the longing in Xiao Liu\u2019s heart expanded instead of being severed.The carriage had an accident allowing Jing and Xiao Liu to sneak out disguised into the messenger group from town. Fake Jing and Xiao Liu continued on in the carriage while Jing and Xiao Liu went back to Qing Shui Town with the messenger group.The group continued on until dark when they returned to the inn for dinner before sleeping outside to guard the goods being transported. It was Summer so it wasn\u2019t cold out at night. The entire town was asleep and the stars out were especially bright. Xiao Liu raised his head to look at the stars and wished for a duck neck to gnaw on to make this feel like a trip rather than running away.Jing said \u201cIf you\u2019re tired, go to sleep.\u201dXiao Liu replied \u201cIt\u2019s crazy outside of town, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zhuan Xu thought he left town so was searching outside but in truth he was still in town.Jing explained \u201cTomorrow the messenger group will depart for Gao Xing.\u201d Xiao Liu laughed, Zhuan Xu would never think that he was running away from going to Gao Xing would then be headed to Gao Xing. Xiao Liu said to Jing \u201cI thought you were so honest, who knew you were this sneaky.\u201dJing said \u201cTomorrow will be exhausting, you rest leaning on me.\u201d Xiao Liu looked up at the stars and said nothing. A raspy voice said \u201cI. Am s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dXiao Liu still looked up at the stars and said nothing, but after a few moments his head slowly tilted and lightly rested on s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s shoulder. s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t dare move as if afraid he would scare him away. Until he heard Xiao Liu sleeping did he slightly turn his head to gently look down on the sleeping Xiao Liu.At dawn, s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu followed the group out of town headed due South. There was a checkpoint set up with very tight inspection and the lines were long to pa.s.s. Chatter about why turned to discussion that both Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing soldiers were joined in some sort of search.It was Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s turn and a woman held up a magical object mirror and shone it on their faces to show everyone\u2019s true form. Those who transformed were pulled aside for further questioning. Xiao Liu walked up to his inspection and the mirror showed nothing so he pa.s.sed. Same with s.h.i.+ Qi as well.After pa.s.sing the inspection, s.h.i.+ Q and Xiao Liu glanced at each other and continued on. Due to the inspection the procession was already late so the leader told everyone to quicken their steps. By nightfall they had arrived within the borders of the Gao Xing Kingdom. Two high mountains flanked a gate with an entry checkpoint. Because Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t think Xiao Liu would come to Gao Xing, the checkpoint was not extra manned so Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi entered easily.That night the procession entered a city and the group checked into an inn. Xiao Liu asked for a hot water bath and after he walked out and changed into fresh clothes he saw that s.h.i.+ Qi had already finished bathing. s.h.i.+ Qi took a towel to wipe his hair. Xiao Liu asked \u201cSo we successfully escaped?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi answered \u201cWhen we entered there was a very powerful being nearby so I completely concealed my power aura. I don\u2019t know if he registered us.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a high ranking Gao Xing general that is stationed here.\u201d But he didn\u2019t feel all that at ease.s.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cNo matter who, we have to be alert. Rest well tonight.\u201dIn the middle of the night Xiao Liu heard a commotion and immediately sat up. He saw s.h.i.+ Qi pour all the water in the room on the ground around them before saying \u201cThe G.o.dly army has surrounded the inn, and there are two very powerful G.o.ds in the mix. I can\u2019t even beat one of them.\u201dXiao Liu chuckled \u201cIf we successfully escaped then I would be disappointed in Zhuan Xu. He is pretty capable.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cI let you down.\u201d\u201cNo you didn\u2019t! Zhuan Xu used the power of two Kingdoms to chase us. You helped me all on your own. It\u2019s a miracle we escaped this far.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi asked \u201cHow much do you not want to see the Grand Emperor?\u201dXiao Liu thought \u201cI would rather die than see him.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi put a fox shaped satchel in Xiao Liu\u2019s hand \u201cI can\u2019t beat them but I can stall them. My winged ride is due Northeast. You run in that direction then raise the satchel and call like a fox. It will come pick you up.\u201dXiao Liu grabbed s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s hand \u201cWill they kill you?\u201d\u201cI am Tu Shan Jing, even if the Grand Emperor was here he would have to consider before killing me. Mere generals won\u2019t even dare.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cThen I\u2019m going to abandon you and run.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi grabbed his shoulder with his voice slightly shaking \u201cLet me see your true face.\u201dXiao Liu smiled and shook his head \u201cNo.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stared at Xiao Liu with unspeakable sorrow in his eyes. Once he walked out of here, Xiao Liu can become anyone else. Once Xiao Liu stopped being Xiao Liu, then s.h.i.+ Qi would never be able to find him again.Xiao Liu stared at him \u201cAre you still willing to risk incurring the wrath of the Grand Emperor and help me escape?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi nodded.Zhuan Xu\u2019s booming voice reached them \u201cWen Xiao Liu, get your sorry behind out here! If you run again, I\u2019ll break both your scrawny legs!\u201d\u201cChange into one of their soldiers and run away\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi told him.s.h.i.+ Qi transformed the water into smoke and it became a mist surrounding him. He transformed into Wen Xiao Liu and walked to the window and opened it. Zhuan Xu said \u201cNow you obediently come out here and I\u2019ll consider not making you suffer as much.\u201dThe mist gradually expanded from the room and floated outside and became so dense and thick it formed a maze. Zhuan Xu was furious and ordered the mist maze stopped immediately.Xiao Liu could see in the maze thanks to the fox satchel s.h.i.+ Qi gave him. He transformed into one of Zhuan Xu\u2019s servants and silently slipped out of the inn.Xiao Liu ran due Northeast and he raised the fox satchel high and a large crane descended. Xiao Liu climbed on the back of the crane and it took off continuing Northeast. Xiao Liu looked back and didn\u2019t feel at ease.Zhuan Xu\u2019s angry thunderous voice reached him \u201cWen Xiao Liu, the person with you right now is Ye s.h.i.+ Qi. I don\u2019t have a problem with killing one Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u2013 he really was able to be cold and heartless at the blink of an eye, thorough and unyielding. No wonder the Yellow Emperor liked Zhuan Xu.Xiao Liu transformed back into being Wen Xiao Liu and turned back. After some time, he saw Zhuan Xu flying towards him and behind him s.h.i.+ Qi was trussed up in a cage.A servant came forward and Xiao Liu allowed himself to be captured. Zhuan Xu stared coldly at Xiao Liu and ordered \u201cBreak both his legs.\u201d The servant kicked both of Xiao Liu\u2019s legs and both snapped. Xiao Liu collapsed on the ground.\u201cThrow him in the cage.\u201dXiao Liu was thrown in the cage and he crawled towards s.h.i.+ Qi 's.h.i.+ Qi\u2026.s.h.i.+ Qi\u2026..\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes were tightly shut and he was unconscious. Xiao Liu examined him and relaxed, s.h.i.+ Qi had used all his powers as one to fight with many so he depleted all his energy and was pa.s.sed out. He had no internal injuries and was in no life threatening danger.Xiao Liu\u2019s legs were in excruciating pain and he leaned on s.h.i.+ Qi and murmured to himself \u201cIf I knew it was so painful to run, I would have chosen not to run. But if I didn\u2019t run, then I would have never known that you would do anything for me. But what shall I do now? It would have been better had you not helped me. I could have easily severed my longing and hope. Or when we were surrounded back there, it would have been better had you not told me to run away by myself. Xan Tian Er\u2019s life is a struggle, and when a man thinks he is helping her by easing her struggle, he is putting her into a different kind of struggle. She is now struggling with the fear that he would leave her one day and she\u2019s left struggling all alone again. Which of the two struggles is harder? Perhaps most women choose to struggle with a man easing her load, at least there is some happiness, some hope that the man won\u2019t let go one day. But I\u2019m not like that! I would rather be roasted all alone, struggle all alone, because at least my hands are free. Pain makes me hope for escape, a man\u2019s hands make me fear he\u2019ll let go. I would then reach out and hold onto him tightly, collect all the happiness tightly. Right now Xan Tian Er is able to save herself because I helped her. But who will help me? The G.o.ds can help humans, but who will help the G.o.ds? No one! I still feel it\u2019s safer to hide in my sh.e.l.l. I\u2019ve suffered so much in my life already, I don\u2019t want to suffer more, I don\u2019t want to be hurt more\u2026..\u201dAfter a day and night, Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi reached Five G.o.ds Mountain.Zhuan Xu ordered them tossed into the dragon bone prison. Xiao Liu smiled, his attempted escape really riled up Zhuan Xu. This infamous dragon bone prison isn\u2019t meant for just any prisoner.The jailers were very rough with Xiao Liu and purposely kicked his broken legs. But they were very careful with the still unconscious s.h.i.+ Qi and gently place him in the cell.Looks like Zhuan Xu WAs also very p.i.s.sed s.h.i.+ Qi helped Xiao Liu escape so want to make him suffer a bit so he learnED not to defy the imperial authority that is the Xuan Yuan Prince. But he was still wary of his Tu Shan last name so he only locked him up and didn\u2019t add any further insult.The cell door closed and Xiao Liu crawled over to s.h.i.+ Qi, hitting him a few times angrily before snuggling by his side. It was pitch black in the cell and Xiao Liu closed his eyes as he felt the waves of pain from his leg hit him. Gradually he also pa.s.sed out from the pain.When Xiao Liu woke up, he didn\u2019t know how much time had pa.s.sed but he felt someone holding his hand. He moved and heard s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cXiao Liu, you\u2019re awake?\u201d\u201cYup, I\u2019m in pain for laying too long.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi sat up and wanted to help Xiao Liu up but touched his leg and Xiao Liu yelped in pain. s.h.i.+ Qi held him \u201cYou\u2019re hurt?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201cMy legs.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi felt Xiao Liu\u2019s legs and the pain lessened but Xiao Liu quickly said \u201cYou\u2019re also injured, don\u2019t use your powers.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi ignored him and touched the other leg and Xiao Liu yelled \u201cBe good!\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said nothing and after he touched the legs Xiao Liu felt the pain lessen a lot. s.h.i.+ Qi helped Xiao Liu up AND let him rest on his shoulder to be more comfortable. s.h.i.+ Qi asked \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see the Grand Emperor, is it because he will kill you if he sees you?\u201dXiao Liu understood that s.h.i.+ Qi was not trying to probe but needed to know what the Grand Emperor would do to Xiao Liu so that he could think about the right plan for now that would ensure Xiao Liu\u2019s safety. Xiao Liu was silent for a moment then said \u201cHe won\u2019t kill me.\u201dWith the way Xiao Liu desperately tried to run away, Zhuan Xu must have gotten the wrong idea as well. The Grand Emperor killed all five of his younger brothers and also their entire families and descendants. But rumor had it that the Five Princes had secret offspring that was wandering the world. Zhuan Xu likely thought Xiao Liu was a secret offspring of one of the Five Princes.s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t feel at ease \u201cThis world boils down to gain at the end, which is really just a business transaction. Even if it\u2019s the Yellow Emperor or the Grand Emperor, I can make a deal with them.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the Grand Emperor for a different reason. s.h.i.+ Qi, don\u2019t worry about me, I stake my life on it that the Grand Emperor won\u2019t kill me!\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi could tell Xiao Liu was being serious so relaxed. Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t help but secretly smile, every person must feel happy to have another worried about their welfare.s.h.i.+ Qi quietly held Xiao Liu and Xiao Liu quietly listened to his heartbeat. In this place of death, separated from the world\u2019s enticements and entanglements, it made the complicated relations.h.i.+p between a man and a woman so very simple. It was just him and her. Xiao Liu suddenly felt right being here and that was calming.Xiao Liu said \u201cHow about we never leave here.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s fine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine staying here.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s fine about it?\u201d\u201cJust you. And me.\u201dXiao Liu laughed knowing that s.h.i.+ Qi also understood. There was so much that made life complicated purely due to circ.u.mstance. The old married couple living in the far off secluded mountains, they were actually the envy of so many who live glamorous lives of conflict.Xiao Liu asked 's.h.i.+ Qi, are you so good to me because you are repaying a debt?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s body stiffened and he said nothing for a long time. Xiao Liu was leaning on him so could feel his heart beating so fast it might burst out of his chest. Xiao Liu casually added \u201cI saved you, let you stay for 6 years, and now you\u2019ve done everything and more for me. When we get out, we\u2019re really even. You don\u2019t need to worry anymore, I will never go ask you for anything and get you in trouble. I promise to stay far far away from you\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s mouth was suddenly shut by s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s hand. Xiao Liu struggled but s.h.i.+ Qi wouldn\u2019t release his hand. Finally Xiao Liu naughtily licked the center of his palm with his tongue and s.h.i.+ Qi was like being hit with an electric shock and released him. Xiao Liu was also shocked by what he just did and his mouth was gaping open and his entire face was flaming red.The two of them remained frozen in silence.Finally s.h.i.+ Qi spoke \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d\u201cWhy? Why not leave? Because of grat.i.tude? I told you that you\u2019ve repaid it.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t answer and stubbornly repeated \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you want to stay with me for the rest of your life then?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi was silent for a moment and then said with absolute certainty \u201cMy entire life.\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u201cI\u2019m a man, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being weird.\u201dThis time s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s response was immediate \u201cYou\u2019re a girl.\u201dXiao Liu actually felt s.h.i.+ Qi had known for a long time that she was a girl, but how did s.h.i.+ Qi know? \u201cWhy are you so certain? Even Xiang Liu being that smart can\u2019t be absolutely certain I\u2019m a girl.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi softly chuckled \u201cThat\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t seen you\u2026\u2026\u201d He suddenly shut up.\u201cSeen me what?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi refused to explain so Xiao Liu got more curious \u201cSeen me what?\u201d Xiao Liu shook s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s arm coquettishly and wheedled \u201cNot seen me what? Tell me! Tell me!\u201dXiao Liu was always acting like a loutish man and this was the first time showing a pouty girlish side. Even in the darkness and s.h.i.+ Qi couldn\u2019t see her face clearly, he was already defeated. He said \u201cThe first time I bathed after I was strong enough, you sat to the side and I saw\u2026..when you saw my body\u2026..I knew you\u2026..to me\u2026..\u201dXiao Liu yelped and then covered her face \u201cYou\u2019re lying! I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying, it\u2019s totally a lie. I never blush.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi usually gave in to whatever Xiao Liu wanted so this was the first time he was so absolutely stubborn and unwilling to concede to her. Xiao Liu turned around and refused to face s.h.i.+ Qi or talk to s.h.i.+ Qi anymore, using action to show that s.h.i.+ Qi was lying and until he admitted it then she wasn\u2019t going to talk to him.s.h.i.+ Qi called Xiao Liu but she didn\u2019t acknowledge, he tugged her a bit but she ignored him. He was afraid her leg hurt so didn\u2019t want to use any strength.s.h.i.+ Qi was silent until Xiao Liu felt all wronged and grumbled \u201cSuch a little matter and you won\u2019t even give me in to me.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi replied \u201cIt\u2019s not a small matter.\u201dXiao Liu pouted, if this wasn\u2019t a small matter, then what counts as a small matter?s.h.i.+ Qi slowly spoke \u201cFrom birth I was the prized child, the perfect one. A woman once learned ten years of dancing just so I could spare her one glance. A famous chess master came from far away and lived for seven years just so I would play one match with him. I was offered tens of thousands just to paint a portrait. Some called me a Master if I wrote one character. I thought that was who I was. That person locked me up and tortured me for two years, every day cursing me, that I was nothing. I didn\u2019t care to argue back and silently endured his torture. He was so upset he said that he could prove it to me. He took me to all the places I once lived and put the me who was crippled, filthy, in rags, couldn\u2019t speak, smelly, in the middle of the bustling city. People walked past me and not a single person looked at me just like he said. Often I saw people I knew and wanted to crawl over to ask for help but they just tossed money at me and immediately walked away in disgust. I finally understood that other than the expensive clothes on me, I was nothing. That was when he succeeded in completely destroying me. He tossed me in the river not even bothering to kill me because he knew he killed me inside already. I floated for a long time until I was laying in the logs. I knew I would die like this, and all I wanted was to feel the sunlight one more time. So struggled to climb towards the sun and then pa.s.sed out knowing that I wouldn\u2019t see another sun and wouldn\u2019t wake up again. But the Heavens, let you appear\u2026..\u201dXiao Liu had long forgotten to be angry and slowly turned around and rested her head on s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s shoulder to listen to him talk. s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s forehead was resting on Xiao Liu\u2019s hair \u201cI couldn\u2019t open my eyes so I couldn\u2019t see you. I could only sense. You didn\u2019t want me to be afraid so told me your name. You didn\u2019t want me to be shamed so told me jokes. You lightly wiped away my sweat and held me in your embrace and washed my hair which hadn\u2019t been washed in three years. I knew how disgusting and horrific my body was, but you treated it like a treasure and tended to it with care. The three years of torture and degradation, the body even I couldn\u2019t face and I couldn\u2019t bear to walk out the door, that day you helped me bathe and when you saw my body you blushed beet red. In that instant I was truly reborn. In your eyes, I was still a man\u2026..a man who affected you\u2026..\u201dXiao Liu yelled \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say another word!\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s eyes misted with tears and it splashed on Xiao Liu\u2019s hair, but his voice was filled with mirth \u201cWhen you carried me out of the tub, you didn\u2019t even dare look directly at me before placing me on the pallet. You ran off even before you were done talking. How could I ever think you were a man?\u201dXiao Liu hit him on the chest and groused \u201cYou are so sneaky! And here I thought you were the most honest! I was hoodwinked!\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi continued \u201cThat day, I put on my clothes and walked out the door, standing under the sun feeling the outdoors I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. In the eyes of others it was just a normal thing to do, but to me it was a rebirth and a new chance. Xiao Liu, I decided right then and there that I would never leave you.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cA reborn phoenix must first be incinerated. But you cannot ever escape your past as Tu Shan Jing.\u201d\u201cMy father died shortly after I was born. I have an older twin brother named Tu Shang Hou. He is different from me since birth, he likes raising beasts and is a very active person. I liked the arts and was very refined. But we were both very good at business even if our methods are different. We were equal and neither was better than the other. Because we were twins, we learned everything together and people couldn\u2019t help but compare us. I was better at the cla.s.sic arts but he was stronger at the spiritual powers. But our mother was always very cold towards him no matter what he did. Because of her att.i.tude towards him, people around us complimented me and derided him as well. My brother tried hard and kept trying to win our mother\u2019s approval, but she not only didn\u2019t give it, she did everything in her power to keep beating him down. No matter what I did she complimented me. Under our mother\u2019s control, the power in the family ended up in my hands. She found for me a fiancee in the powerful Fang Feng family daughter, but only gave my brother a maid for a wife. I raised a fuss for my brother but he continued to try and win her affection so married the maid. But our mother continued to be cold towards him. When she was dying, my brother gave her medicine but she tossed it in his face and told him to scram. She said he disgusted her. My brother finally broke down and cried and asked why she played favorites. She raged at him and said that he could not match up to me, that he had a disgusting heart and mind, that he couldn\u2019t even compare to one toe on my foot. She died shortly thereafter and I was very sad, but felt my brother was even more sad. He didn\u2019t just lose a mother, he lost any chance of getting her acceptance. When she died he started to drink and told everyone that it was enough there was one Tu Shan Jing in this world, there was no need for a pathetic useless Tu Shan Hou. Our grandmother didn\u2019t want him to kill himself so finally told the truth. He wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s son, he was born of our father and a maid. The maid killed herself after she gave birth to him. Because he was born 8 days before me, our grandmother made the announcement that we were twins. After he heard this he stopped drinking and started getting a grip on himself. I felt very bad towards him so treated him very well and that made our grandmother happy and she complimented me often for being so caring. She told my brother to help me always. After my mother died four years, grandmother decided to have my wedding and announce to the world that I would be the clan leader. One day, my brother came to see me and asked to talk. I went with him without any suspicion, and when I woke up I was in a deep dark jail cell, my powers sealed, my limbs in dragon bone chains.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi talked nonstop to get to this point, but the painful torture, the endless degradation, it all came rus.h.i.+ng back and in the darkness his body clenched tightly. Xiao Liu quickly pressed on his heart and softly murmured \u201cThis is not that prison, I am here, s.h.i.+ Qi, I am here.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi buried his head in Xiao Liu\u2019s hair and after some time was able to calm down. \u201cWhen I was being tortured and shamed, I thought about making him pay when I got out. But if that happened then even if I lived a part of me would still be dead. I would never be a complete person, I would only be someone tormented by shame and vengeance. Thankfully the person who saved me was you, no matter how broken down and scarred I was, you only saw me as a treasure and cared for me tenderly. No matter how many horrific scars were on my body, you would always\u2026..blush\u2026..\u201d This time Xiao Liu didn\u2019t interrupt s.h.i.+ Qi and quietly let him finish.\u201cXiao Liu, when I see you, I have no hatred and vengeance in my heart, only grat.i.tude. I am grateful the Heavens let me live, let me have a still whole body, let my eyes still see, so that I can see you pretend to be stupid, let my ears hear, so that I can hear you complain, let my hands still work, so that I can help you dry your hair, let my legs still move, so that I can carry you. Xiao Liu, I don\u2019t want revenge, I just want to be Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dXiao Liu lowered her head.s.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back because my brother is very capable and much more ruthless than me. He\u2019s actually a more suitable leader of the clan than me. If he\u2019s there, the family will be fine. As long as there is no Tu Shan Jing, then Tu Shan Hou will be the best. But that day I went with you to the jewelry store without knowing it belonged to the family. Jing Ye recognized me and the entire store saw me, word would soon get back to my brother that I was alive. I don\u2019t want revenge, and I want even less to be Tu Shan Jing, but once my brother knows he will hunt me down no matter where I go. I was afraid he would hurt you and Lao Mu and them so I had to go back to being Tu Shan Jing. If I am in the open, then my brother will know where his target is and not aim wildly.\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hurt him but he wants to hurt you. For your own safety you ought to kill him, but if you do you can\u2019t have a peace of mind. His death is an instant release but you\u2019ll carry the guilt your whole life. I guess you really can\u2019t kill him.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi was so happy \u201cI knew you would understand and support me. Jing Ye and them cannot understand why I don\u2019t want revenge.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cI\u2019m different than you. You are kindness, I am practical.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said in a low voice \u201cYou are being practical for my own good.\u201dXiao Liu huffed but said nothing.s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s breathing was erratic and his heartbeat was also fast. Xiao Liu knew what he wanted to say but was embarra.s.sed to say. So she didn\u2019t rush and instead nestled like a cat on his shoulder waiting patiently.\u201cXiao Liu\u2026.I\u2026\u2026I know I am engaged and have no right to say this to you\u2026..and I never dared to\u2026.but\u2026\u2026.I will call off the engagement, I will call off the engagement! You wait for me for twenty years\u2026.no\u2026..no, fifteen years. You give Tu Shan Jing fifteen years, and after fifteen years I\u2019ll give you back a Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cHow do you want me to wait?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..you won\u2019t let another man\u2026\u2026into your heart.\u201dXiao Liu was silent.In the darkness, s.h.i.+ Qi couldn\u2019t see Xiao Liu\u2019s expression and he was so nervous he forgot to breath.Xiao Liu suddenly burst out laughing and s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t know if her laughter was mocking him for daring or\u2026.Xiao Liu said \u201cYou, you really don\u2019t know me at all. My heart is cold and there is a hard sh.e.l.l encasing it. Forget fifteen years, likely in fifty years there won\u2019t be a man who goes inside.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi asked \u201cSo you\u2019re agreeing? Let\u2019s make a palm promise.\u201dXiao Liu lazily raised her palm and s.h.i.+ Qi felt where it was and then solemnly pressed his palm on hers. After they joined palms, he didn\u2019t release and instead tightly held her hand \u201cXiao Liu, I\u2019m, I\u2019m so happy.\u201d His voice was quivering as his heart soared.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t help but smile \u201cYou said everything boils down to a business transaction, so why do I feel like I\u2019m not getting the better end of the bargain here.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi shook her hand \u201cThat doesn\u2019t include love, only love can never be measured by profit or loss. Family love, sibling love, friends.h.i.+p love, romantic love, it seems so easy but is a rare treasure that cannot be bought with any amount of money.\u201dXiao Liu giggled \u201cThey say Tu Shan Jing is a shrewd businessman and great at conversation. I didn\u2019t believe it since you\u2019re always so stupid looking around me and rarely talking. Today I finally believe it.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi laughed lightly and his laughter was just like his personality \u2013 gentle, peaceful, pure.Xiao Liu said 's.h.i.+ Qi, I\u2019m not like you. I\u2019m not a businessman but I know that I am a ruthless person. I am ruthless towards others and even more ruthless towards myself. Do you know that?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cDo you really?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cI know you never give yourself hope so you don\u2019t trust first and won\u2019t give first. You have a true heart but if the other doesn\u2019t appreciate it, then you won\u2019t give it. I\u2019m willing to wait, wait until you\u2019re willing to hope.\u201d\u201cWhat if in my entire lifetime I\u2019m not willing?\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait an entire lifetime. As long as you don\u2019t disappear, then even if it\u2019s an entire lifetime it will still be happy.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi smiled \u2013 Xiao Liu was ruthless and cold to herself, but to everyone else in her life she was so good. Lao Mu, Chuan Zi, Mai Zi, Xan Tian Er, these people were just pa.s.sing by in her life yet she gave them everything they needed for their own lives.Darkness like death, silence like death, the most infamous jail cell in the vast wilderness made any prisoner seek death, but to s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu, as they talked they didn\u2019t even feel like time was pa.s.sing. s.h.i.+ Qi was so grateful that Zhuan Xu locked him up in the same cell as Xiao Liu, and only here did he have the courage to reveal his greatest wish. He even wished now to never leave, he was willing to spend an entire lifetime here with Xiao Liu. When the footsteps of the jailer sounded, s.h.i.+ Qi felt like it was much too short.The jailers politely welcomed them out with a changed att.i.tude, and even brought a stretcher to carry Xiao Liu gently. s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t want them to touch Xiao Liu so picked her up and carried her out of the jail cell. It was midday outside and the sun was so bright it hurt Xiao Liu\u2019s eyes and she quickly closed it.Xiao Liu heard Zhuan Xu ask s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cHow do you want me to treat you here. Ye s.h.i.+ Qi or\u2026.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s answer was direct \u201cYe s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cFollow me.\u201dXiao Liu opened her eyes and they were walking along the edge of the cliff. To the right was the vast ocean, waves and waves were pounding the black rocks. Xiao Liu suddenly felt her heart sense, she sensed someone was calling her. She said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cTo the edge of the ocean.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi carried Xiao Liu down stone steps, through the forest, to the edge of the ocean. Standing on the cliff, Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t stop them and instead silently followed behind.Another set of waves rolled towards the cliff and as the blue waves rose higher and higher, at the top a white shadow rode the waves towards Xiao Liu. The white shadow stood steady on top of the wave, white robe and white hair, wearing a mask. He stood in the middle of the waves like a white lily, pure and untouched, extraordinary and beautiful.All the servants rushed forward but Zhuan Xu stared in bemus.e.m.e.nt and asked \u201cXiang Liu, you want to kill me that much that you chased me all the way to Five G.o.ds Mountain?\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cThis time I\u2019m not here for you, Prince.\u201d He looked at Xiao Liu \u201cYou got your legs broken? What did you do that sent all the Gao Xing soldiers running around like headless chickens?\u201dXiao Liu suddenly remembered that Xiang Liu had the bug in him so when her leg was broken, he must have felt it. Xiao Liu laughed \u201cWith my little measly ability? Nothing, it\u2019s just a misunderstanding.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cUnderneath you is the ocean.\u201dXiao Liu understood what he was saying. If she jumped into the ocean then Xiang Liu would take her away. But this was Five G.o.ds Mountain, and the Gao Xing tribe had a lot of generals who were water-based powers. Xiang Liu could come and go if he was alone, but if he had to take another person along, it would be a death sentence. And if she left, what would happen to s.h.i.+ Qi?Xiao Liu smiled \u201cThank you, but I\u2019d rather not owe you too many favors.\u201d Xiao Liu said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cGo back.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stepped off the rock and walked back. Xiang Liu merely smiled at Xiao Liu turning down his offer \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the debt you owe me, a dead person can\u2019t repay it.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a coward, I\u2019ll be around for you to collect.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s eyes glanced across s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face and then landed on Zhuan Xu. He said \u201cFarewell!\u201d before disappearing in the waves. The servants wanted to give chase but Zhuan Xu said \u201cNo need, he came from the sea and he\u2019ll leave from the sea. In the future, strengthen the guards along the edge of the mountain.\u201dXiao Liu stared at the breaking waves on the jagged rocks and felt rather dazed. Xiang Liu traveled tens of thousands of miles, just to ask her two questions?Zhuan Xu walked to a cloud carriage and reached out his hand to Xiao Liu \u201cWe\u2019ll take the carriage up the mountain.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi carried Xiao Liu on the cloud carriage and after some time it stopped outside the largest palace in Five G.o.ds Mountain \u2013 Cheng En Palace. This palace was beautifully decorated, it\u2019s architectural glory known throughout the vast wilderness. Legend had it that long long ago, a Sheng Nong prince saw this palace and started a war with Gao Xing to get it. But after this generation\u2019s Grand Emperor a.s.sumed the throne, he didn\u2019t like extravagance, or banquets, or womanly enticements. His entire harem consisted of one Consort, so Cheng En Palace was very quiet.Zhuan Xu smiled at Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at Cheng En Palace.\u201dXiao Liu appeared tired and rested in s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s arms, but her eyes were tightly shut. s.h.i.+ Qi nodded to Zhuan Xu and stepped out of the cloud carriage and followed him into the palace.\u201cThis is Hua Yin Court, I\u2019ve lived here since I came to the palace. You guys can stay here for now. Yesterday when we arrived at the mountain, it was late so I didn\u2019t go report to my Master. Today after court session ends, I will go meet my Master and report that I\u2019ve brought you here. Xiao Liu, be prepared, His majesty can summon you at any time.\u201dXiao Liu opened her eyes \u201cGive me medicine!\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cI can treat your leg injury, but if you\u2019re healed don\u2019t think about running around. If you run into Ah Nian, it won\u2019t be just your two legs broken.\u201dXiao Liu looked at Zhuan Xu, wanting to say something but not, then said \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dZhuan Xu ordered the maids to bring food, and after s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu had eaten, had the maids take them to wash up. s.h.i.+ Qi carried Xiao Liu to the edge of pool and Xiao Liu said \u201cThe maids will take care of me, you go wash up away and cleanse away the filth of the prison.\u201dTwo maids helped Xiao Liu wash and dress, and when she came out s.h.i.+ Qi was already washed and dressed and waiting outside. When he saw the maids carry Xiao Liu out, he rushed over.Gao Xing was a nation of eternal Spring so their clothing was thin and loose, the fas.h.i.+on was airy and light. Right now s.h.i.+ Qi was wearing a blue Gao Xing robe with wide sleeves and a simple belt, a crown encircling his hair. As he walked it was like he was walking on clouds, like he was the embodiment of the blue moon, his moves like the waves fluid.The two maids stared and Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t look away either. s.h.i.+ Qi appeared taken back and slightly lowered his eyes but he liked Xiao Liu staring at him like this so he kept his eyes locked on hers as he walked over.Xiao Liu teased \u201cNo wonder a girl learned dance for ten years to try and seduce you. After you go back, there won\u2019t be a lack of women throwing themselves at you.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi appeared uneasy and worried Xiao Liu would misunderstand and quickly said \u201cI won\u2019t look.\u201dXiao Liu felt a sweetness in her heart but didn\u2019t want him to see it so purposely turned her head \u201cWhether you look or not has nothing to do with me.\u201dThe doctor came to treat Xiao Liu\u2019s injury and s.h.i.+ Qi stayed to help. The doctor applied medication and then wrapped the legs in wooden boards so the bone could heal. Xiao Liu felt like her two legs were soaked in cool water and almost couldn\u2019t feel any pain.The doctor said \u201cTry not to use your legs, if you rest up then it\u2019ll heal fast in a month and slow in three months.\u201d Xiao Liu smiled and thanked the doctor, and then asked him to check s.h.i.+ Qi. After the doctor checked, he gave s.h.i.+ Qi some medicine for his internal injuries.After the doctor left, Xiao Liu said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cEven though your injury scars, even the most amazing magical medicine cannot remove\u2026.\u201d Normally any injury would have a hard time leaving a scar on any G.o.d, but when Tu Shan Hou was torturing s.h.i.+ Qi, every time he finished a torture he would use a special water on s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s wounds so that it would keep him alert to better feel the pain, and also imprint the degrading injury on his body. Years ago Xiao Liu thought about how to remove those horrible scars, but after a year and searching for all the magical medicine in the world, she discovered it would never be removed.Xiao Liu stared at s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s leg \u201cBut Gao Xing has a lot of special medicine, maybe it can heal your leg.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s right leg\u2019s injury, because of his spiritual powers, when he walked fast it was undetectable that he was a cripple, but when he walked slow it was evident he limped.s.h.i.+ Qi shook his head \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dXiao Liu smiled and then yawned. s.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cYou sleep.\u201dXiao Liu grabbed his sleeve \u201cYou sleep, too. But I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d\u201cI can sleep leaning.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi sat on the pallet and leaned on the side. Xiao Liu closed her eyes but her hand kept playing with s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s sleeve. s.h.i.+ Qi picked up a cup of water and held it in his hand. A white mist came up from the cup and surrounded Xiao Liu. Xiao Liu\u2019s hand gradually stopped moving.s.h.i.+ Qi felt like Xiao Liu was trying so hard to control her nervousness since they left the prison. s.h.i.+ Qi deduced it had something to do with the Grand Emperor. It couldn\u2019t be related to the Emperor\u2019s power, but was because of who he was.s.h.i.+ Qi tightly held Xiao Liu\u2019s hand and said in a low voice \u201cNo matter what happens, I will always be with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe action switches in Lost You Forever from little Qing Shui Town to the vast Palace of the Gao Xing Kingdom, and with it Xiao Liu\u2019s past as Xiao Yao finally catches up to her. By the time Lost You Forever rolls, around the Sheng Nong Kingdom has fallen and the world of the G.o.ds has only the two remaining kingdoms Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing remaining. It\u2019s a tentative truce between them, one that was bought at the price of Xiao Yao\u2019s mother as the Xuan Yuan Princess marrying her father the Gao Xing Emperor. But in the world of power greater than individual need, the bonds of birth and marriage are tenuous at best. Xiao Yao can\u2019t change her ident.i.ty as the most powerful royal child in the G.o.d world, but perhaps her marriage can escape political alliances that her mother sacrificed her love for. She appears to have made her choice in Jing, promising to give him fifteen years so he can end his engagement and come back to her a man who has the right to love her back. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t have picked a better man than Jing, but sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants despite the mind telling you \u201cthis guy is better for you\u201d. What makes her such an interesting leading lady is that she does think with her mind rather than all the grand pa.s.sion that typically dooms romances to epic ups and downs. Life with Jing would be lovely, she knows it, we know it, but she\u2019s got two other guys in her heart as well and how she balances all three men will be interesting to see. The irony of Xiao Yao\u2019s life is that she might have the chance to love any guy she wants, because those around her desperately want her to be happy since she\u2019s suffered so much, but she might end up being too scared to love without abandon. This chapter is amazingly poignant in finally releasing the dams of Xiao Yao\u2019s heartbreak so that she can start moving forward after staying in place for so long.Chapter 9 \u2013 Brow Furrowed, No Choice But Mutual Avoidance:When the sun was setting, a retainer came to summon Xiao Liu that the Grand Emperor wanted to see her.Seeing Xiao Liu\u2019s leg injury, the retainer brought a pallet and s.h.i.+ Qi put Xiao Liu on it. The servants carried Xiao Liu while s.h.i.+ Qi followed behind, and after walking for some time they arrived at Cao Hui Court where the Grand Emperor handled all his daily affairs. The servants stopped outside and went in to announce.When called inside, s.h.i.+ Qi picked up Xiao Liu and the servants wanted to stop him but Zhuan Xu called out \u201cLet him come in.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi carried Xiao Liu inside the expansive quiet interior where there was a pallet placed in the center. A man in white sat in the middle, his face was neither young nor old, he looked about 30 something, but there were a lot of white hairs in his head and he gave off an aura of weathered sadness.s.h.i.+ Qi gently set Xiao Liu down and bowed \u201cYour majesty, I am Ye s.h.i.+ Qi and this is Wen Xiao Liu. His legs are injured so will Your majesty please forgive.\u201dThe Grand Emperor appeared not to have heard s.h.i.+ Qi and instead stared intently only at Xiao Liu.Before entering the court, Xiao Liu was very nervous and strangely solemn. But now she appeared totally at ease and smiled at the Grand Emperor and let him stare his fill. After some time, the Grand Emperor waved for s.h.i.+ Qi to get up.The Grand Emperor asked Xiao Liu \u201cWho hurt you?\u201dXiao Liu smiled and glanced briefly at Zhuan Xu but said nothing. Zhuan Xu turned \u201cIt was me. He tried to run away time and time again, so I ordered him punished.\u201dThe Grand Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu and then asked Xiao Liu \u201cDid you have dinner yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dThe Grand Emperor ordered a servant to prepare dinner.The group dined in the hall off the court, a small hall so everyone\u2019s place settings was placed quite close. The Grand Emperor sat in the center, Zhuan Xu below him on the left, Xiao Liu below him on the right, and s.h.i.+ Qi below Xiao Liu to help take care of her.Contrary to what people thought, the Grand Emperor dined very simply, so simply it was like any ordinary wealthy family. The Grand Emperor didn\u2019t eat a lot, and he didn\u2019t drink wine, and his every gesture was immaculate. s.h.i.+ Qi and Zhuan Xu were as well, the way they dined was like watching art in motion. From chewing, to drinking, to picking things up, there was no sound and every flow was impeccable.In the entire hall, only Xiao Liu was making loud uncouth noises. Xiao Liu ate and drank like a beast, without any refinement, eschewing utensils and just grabbing things with her hands and letting the juices fly everywhere.After she was done, she wiped her hands on her clothes. The servant behind her brought a bowl over with water and petals floating inside. Xiao Liu wiped her mouth with her sleeve and stared at the bowl, and then grabbed it and drank it with a gulp. The servant stared in shock but Xiao Liu smiled and shoved the bowl back with a thanks.Thank G.o.d the servants had followed the Grand Emperor for a long time and was trained to deal with anything. The shock was momentary and then it was back to normal like nothing weird had just happened. The servant continued to serve Xiao Liu and brought the next dishes.Zhuan Xu was either annoyed by Xiao Liu\u2019s loud noises or full and frustrated, he put down his chopsticks and picked up his wine cup, drinking and staring at Xiao Liu. The Grand Emperor never reacted to anything Xiao Liu did.Xiao Liu finished her meat and tackled the bones, sucking the marrow dry like she always did. A loud sucking and slurping noise wasn\u2019t weird when a lot of people were eating together, but here in the silence of the imperial hall, where even the servants didn\u2019t dare make any noise, Xiao Liu\u2019s sucking was like a thunder loud.The servants stood immobilized in fear but s.h.i.+ Qi was silent and calm, continuing to eat his meal, while Zhuan Xu furrowed his brows in disgust.The Grand Emperor finally looked at Xiao Liu and she sucked on a bone and looked around the hall at the odd mood. She spit the bone out and luckily a servant was quick thinking and grabbed it.Xiao Liu smiled and apologized to the Grand Emperor \u201cI\u2019m just a country b.u.mpkin and have never eaten something so delicious before. I don\u2019t know any manners, so will Your majesty please forgive.\u201dThe Grand Emperor stared for a long time at Xiao Liu then asked \u201cWhat do you like to eat normally?\u201d\u201cMe? Anything, but I love roasted lamb the most as the main dish.\u201d\u201cSnacks?\u201d\u201cDuck neck, chicken feet\u2026.\u201d Xiao Liu licked her lips \u201cAnd goose claws.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of flavor? I\u2019ll have the imperial kitchen make it for you. There is still enough time to have it ready for you to eat while listening to stories before bedtime.\u201dXiao Liu was silent and stared at the Grand Emperor.Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion and doubt and his hands started shaking, causing the wine to slosh on him but he didn\u2019t even notice and could only stare at Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu suddenly laughed \u201cWhatever flavor is fine, country folks aren\u2019t picky.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said to a retainer \u201cMake one of every flavor.\u201dXiao Liut turned to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cI\u2019m full, I want to go back and rest.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi bowed to the Grand Emperor and he said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cYou take Xiao Liu back.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi picked up Xiao Liu and walked out of the hall. That was when Zhuan Xu stood up and stared at Xiao Liu\u2019s disappearing form and then he urgently turned to the Grand Emperor and asked \u201cMaster, who is he?\u201dThe Grand Emperor asked back \u201cWho do you think he is?\u201d\u201cMaster wanted me to bring him here and said maybe he was the child of someone close. I thought he could be a son of one of the deceased Five Princes, supposedly one of their wives was a poison master and tried to poison Master before. Xiao Liu is a poison expert, so I thought\u2026.. But Master, you just said for him to have a snack while listening to stories before bedtime. Xiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhuan Xu was so scared and excited that his voice was shaking so hard he couldn\u2019t continue \u201cLittle sister when she was small she would eat snacks before bedtime while listening to Auntie\u2019s stories. Because she wanted to eat bedtime snacks she wouldn\u2019t even eat her dinner properly. When Auntie chastised her, she would argue back that her Daddy let her eat snacks.\u201dCompared to Zhuan Xu\u2019s shock, the Grand Emperor remained calm without a ripple \u201cI cannot see through the magic so I don\u2019t so I don\u2019t know who he really is.\u201d\u201dZhuan Xu sat down wearily on his knees \u201cBut Master must suspect?\u201dThe Grand Emperor said nothing and Zhuan Xu bolted up and rushed to the door \u201cI\u2019m going to ask her. I\u2019m going to ask her who she really is, and why she won\u2019t reunite with me.\u201d\u201cHalt!\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s icy cold voice caused Zhuan Xu to stop and he looked back in confusion \u201cDoesn\u2019t Master want to know? Xiao Yao is your daughter!\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s right hand touched the white bone ring on his left finger and he slowly turned it \u201cWho she is, is not for us to decide. She needs to decide.\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t understand but he knew his Master was never wrong so he kneeled down and listened.\u201cIn this world, it\u2019s not only ill intent that causes harm, a lot of harm is caused by love. You want to know who she is, I want to know too. But don\u2019t force her. Give her time to tell us who she is.\u201dZhuan Xu shook his head \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026..\u201dThe Grand Emperor walked out \u201cYou will understand.\u201dZhuan Xu sat there in a daze for a long time before walking out, stumbling like he was drunk as he returned to Hua Yin Court.s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu sat in the corridor leaning against a beam enjoying the cool breeze. s.h.i.+ Qi had a crystal plate on his leg filled with various fruits and he was peeling it and handing it to Xiao Liu.Seeing Zhuan Xu, s.h.i.+ Qi politely stood up and bowed but Xiao Liu made no move other than to wave with a wide grin. Zhuan Xu walked over and sat down across from them. Images of all his interactions with Xiao Liu flashed before his eyes.He ordered her tortured and they ought to hate each other, but she used her body to save his life. He thought she wanted him indebted to her and it was another plot. When Nine-lives Xiang Liu was chasing him, he lost the white fox tail satchel but later he discovered it wasn\u2019t lost and was tucked into his robe.He was shot in the chest by a Fang Feng family arrow and lured her over thinking that if needs be, he would shoot her as well so that she would go ask Tu Shan Jing for help. But she didn\u2019t even hesitate and went to ask Tu Shan Jing for help and got him the ice crystals.She planted a voodoo bug in him, supposedly just pain but no life threatening danger. But he didn\u2019t believe her, especially when she made up all sorts of excuses not to remove the bug. He thought she clearly wanted to use the bug to control him. But when she sent word that she removed the bug, and he felt it was gone, he still didn\u2019t really believe that she removed it.Because Master wanted to see her, he thought she was the descendant of the traitorous Five Princes, that she approached him for nefarious purposes. He hurt her but she always only smiled back at him, without any anger in her smile, and instead there was comfort that he was now able to be so ruthless.And their nights of drinking, time and time again\u2026.. Everything came back to him, and really the truth was so clearly before his eyes but his cold and suspicious heart chose not to see it.Zhuan Xu looked at Xiao Liu\u2019s legs wrapped up in wooden boards, so clumsy and painful. He reached out towards her legs and s.h.i.+ Qi thought he wanted to hurt her again so his attack was swift. His finger was like a sword as it shot out but Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t duck like s.h.i.+ Qi thought he would, in fact Zhuan Xu let the finger blade pierce his arm and the blood came down.Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand touched Xiao Liu\u2019s leg and he tenderly asked \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dXiao Liu turned her head and closed her eyes \u201cNo.\u201dZhuan Xu had hundreds, thousands of words he wanted to say, tightly wound in his chest so he felt like exploding but he didn\u2019t dare to open his mouth. In the three hundred years since, he was no longer the boy pus.h.i.+ng her on the swing under the phoenix tree. Both his parents were dead, he was exiled and had to sc.r.a.pe by under others, he had worn his mask for too long and no longer knew how to feel genuine joy and genuine pain. He learned to manipulate others but forgot to to act with sincerity. He learned to use all sorts of strategy to achieve his goals but forgot how to converse candidly.Zhuan Xu stood up and said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cTake good care of her.\u201dZhuan Xu walked out the door, aimlessly strolling in the darkened night. The flowers in Cheng En Pavilion were in bloom and all sorts of incredible flora was present. The night wind gust blew the petals all around and sent the fragrance billowing. But in this distant land as far as the edge of the ocean, there was no red phoenix flower, the flower that bloomed like sunrise, the flower that looked like flames dancing when it fell.s.h.i.+ Qi saw Xiao Liu had her eyes tightly shut, and only after the sound of Zhuan Xu\u2019s departing footsteps faded did the tears tumble down from the corner of her eyes. s.h.i.+ Qi pulled Xiao Liu into his arms and Xiao Liu buried her face in his chest as her tears fell like the rain.It\u2019s been over three hundred years, and she was no longer the little girl on the swing under the phoenix tree.She once roamed in the deep mountains, drinking blood like an animal; she was once locked in a cage, raised like a pet; she was once chased and she killed many; her life was a lie, it was blood, it was death, everyone lied to her so she didn\u2019t know who to trust, she didn\u2019t know who to be in front of everyone.Until it was dark into the night, after s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu had long gone to bed, and still Zhuan Xu did not return.When Xiao Liu woke up the next morning, Zhuan Xu was no longer there. He didn\u2019t return to Hua Yin Court until dusk and Xiao Liu was the same, greeting him with a smile and a wave. Zhuan Xu had a cool expression without a smile, but other than being cold to Xiao Liu, nothing else was different.Zhuan Xu said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cIf you\u2019re bored during the day, have the servants take you guys to Qi Qing Garden, there is a lake to go boating, a creek to soak your feet, filled with exotic plants and strange animals, perfect for spending time.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cFine.\u201dZhuan Xu went back to his room and ate all his meals there. The doctor said Xiao Liu would heal fastest in one month, but really in ten or so days she was already moving around on crutches.The doctor was shocked at her recovery speed and admonished \u201cYou can move around now more and gradually you will be back to normal.\u201dXiao Liu was very obedient and walked around everywhere.The Grand Emperor didn\u2019t summon Xiao Liu often, once every three or four days, and each time he said very little. \u201cWhat do you like to drink?\u201d \u201cWhat color do you like?\u201d \u201cWhat plants?\u201d \u2018What\u2026..\u201dWithin Hua Yin Court, his dictates were everywhere, whatever Xiao Liu said she liked it would appear immediately. One time he asked what she liked and she shamelessly said \u201cI like money, it\u2019s even better if I have a mountain of money where I can roll around in.\u201dThe next day when Xiao Liu got up, there was a mountain of money in the courtyard. It wasn\u2019t jewels, it wasn\u2019t jade, it was actually a mound of cold hard coins stacked as high as a mountain.Seeing this glittering money mountain, Xiao Liu\u2019s face darkened but Zhuan Xu who hadn\u2019t so much as cracked a smile in the last two weeks suddenly burst out laughing. Even the reticent s.h.i.+ Qi couldn\u2019t help but laugh as well as he said very earnestly to Xiao Liu \u201cEven I\u2019ve never seen this much money before.\u201dHearing Zhuan Xu\u2019s laughter, Xiao Liu tossed her crutches aside and flopped on the money mountain and rolled around a few times.s.h.i.+ Qi asked \u201cHappy?\u201d\u201cNo, it really hurts.\u201d Xiao Liu laid on top of the money mountain and stubbornly persisted \u201cBut at least now I know what it feels like to roll around on a money mountain.\u201dZhuan Xu and s.h.i.+ Qi both laughed.The servants from then on would always need to walk around the money mountain, and when s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu were relaxing in the yard from any angle they could see the money mountain glittering s.h.i.+ny bright.On a particular moon lit night, Xiao Liu was in the mood and wanted to see the moon, but when she opened the window all she saw was the s.h.i.+ny money mountain. In front of the money mountain, no beauty or beautiful sight could compare. Xiao Liu finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said to a servant \u201cTake it away.\u201dThe servant explained \u201cThis is His majesty\u2019s order, if young master wants it removed, you need to ask His majesty.\u201dThe next time the Grand Emperor summoned Xiao Liu, it was the first time she spoke first to him \u201cI don\u2019t like the money mountain anymore.\u201dThe Grand Emperor had no expression and slightly nodded his head. Only the very familiar Zhuan Xu could see the twinkle of mirth in the Grand Emperor\u2019s eyes.After that, Xiao Liu no longer dared to bulls.h.i.+t when the Grand Emperor asked what she liked. She answered honestly, because having something she didn\u2019t like in front of her every day was such a pain.Xiao Liu\u2019s legs got better and didn\u2019t need the two crutches anymore. She used one crutch and could walk slowly by herself. She couldn\u2019t sit still so she got bored of just wandering Hua Yin Court. She liked walking at sunset until she was covered in sweat and then she would stop.s.h.i.+ Qi would slowly follow behind her.Xiao Liu nattered \u201cMen love a beauty who doesn\u2019t sweat, but that\u2019s a bad idea to marry one. Life has so many annoyances that upset people and to keep it all inside is bad. To walk around in the sun and sweat it all out, that way a woman can feel relieved and not be so petty. Look at me, lately I\u2019ve been so upset but after walking like this I feel much better.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi looked at Xiao Liu with a smile but said nothing.Suddenly there was a sound of a bird calling from above and a large swallow zoomed down from above and landed right next to Xiao Liu. Its body was inching forward and its head was bowed as if it was bowing to Xiao Liu and inviting Xiao Liu to pet its head.Xiao Liu stepped back and dropped her crutch, her body stumbling.s.h.i.+ Qi wanted to go a.s.sist her but the Grand Emperor and Zhuan Xu arrived and the Grand Emperor raised his hand and a giant force blocked s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s path. s.h.i.+ Qi could see the swallow didn\u2019t want to hurt Xiao Liu so he didn\u2019t resist and quietly watched.The swallow saw that Xiao Liu was ignoring it so it c.o.c.ked its head quizzically and walked towards Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu backed away faster and faster and it walked forward faster and faster. Xiao Liu fell on the ground and the swallow thought Xiao Liu wanted to play with it so it happily called out and started rolling on the ground a few times. It then stretched its neck out and curled up next to Xiao Liu.Xiao Liu stared at it and the swallow was heartbroken and cried out pitifully. It put its head under Xiao Liu\u2019s hand and whined, clearly it wasn\u2019t going to stop complaining until Xiao Liu paid it attention. Xiao Liu finally reached out her hand and stroked its head.The swallow flapped its wings and cried out happily in song, its joy evident to everyone watching.Xiao Liu held the swallow\u2019s body and slowly got up \u201cYou thing, how\u2019d you get so fat?\u201d She then raised her head and saw the Grand Emperor and Zhuan Xu staring at her.Xiao Liu laughed and pointed at the swallow \u201cThis fat bird seems to like me a lot, likely it\u2019s a female.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cI selected this swallow as the winged ride for my eldest daughter Xiao Yao. Xiao Yao slept with it every night when it was still an egg. When it hatched, the first thing it saw was Xiao Yao. She named it Yuan Yuan and every day she would ask when she could ride Yuan Yuan in the skies. I always answered \u201cWhen both of you are all grown up\u201d. Now Yuan Yuan is all grown up, but Xiao Yao still has not returned.\u201dXiao Liu bowed apologetically \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was the Princess\u2019s winged ride, if I insulted it then will Your majesty please forgive.\u201dThe Grand Emperor stared at Xiao Liu and then left with Zhuan Xu without saying a word.Xiao Liu saw them leave and then walked to rest on a rock with s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s a.s.sistance. The swallow came over and Xiao Liu patted it \u201cDon\u2019t bother me, you go play by yourself.\u201d The swallow Yuan Yuan crouched pitifully near Xiao Liu for a bit and then flew off.Xiao Liu rested for a bit and then said to s.h.i.+ Qi with a smile \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dXiao Liu was soon able to walk without crutches and she walked all over the court but never to the yard anymore. One day, a very hot and muggy Summer day, s.h.i.+ Qi followed Xiao Liu to Qi Qing Garden and was resting under a tree when Xiao Liu said \u201cThis would be a perfect time for an iced melon.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stood up \u201cI saw some maids icing melons, I\u2019ll go bring some.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cI was just mentioning it, let\u2019s wait until we go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be back quickly.\u201d s.h.i.+ Qi took off quickly and Xiao Liu sat down to wait for the iced melon.Xiao Liu remembered when she was small, she loved playing in the water and often when it was hot out she stayed in the water and refused to come out. Her mom would lure her out with a big plate of iced melon, eating it on land and indicating that she would finish it all if her daughter didn\u2019t come out. She would quickly climb out and run to her mom\u2019s side and open her mouth wide waiting for her mom to feed her a bite.A group of people walked into the garden and Xiao Liu glanced over and didn\u2019t see any familiar faces so continued to sit there.A beautiful young girl rushed over fairly bursting with rage \u201cYou. You. What are you doing here?\u201dXiao Liu looked at the girl carefully, the face was unfamiliar but her personality seemed familiar. Looking at her attire, Xiao Liu knew who she was now. So Ah Nian\u2019s real face was so beautiful, a true beauty through and through. Xiao Liu laughed \u201cI. I. Why can\u2019t I be here?\u201dAh Nian was about to burst a blood vessel in her brain she was so angry \u201cThis is my house! You lowlife, of course you can\u2019t be here! Guards, grab him!\u201dHai Tang and another servant grabbed Xiao Liu and dragged him up and took him back to her quarters. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t resist and got dragged along. Once they arrived at Ah Nian\u2019s quarters Han Zhang Court, she acted like a judge interrogating a prisoner \u201cDo you admit your crimes?\u201dXiao Liu didn\u2019t have a care and instead look around with a smile. Hai Tang was also angry at Xiao Liu so seeing she didn\u2019t seem to care, kicked her knees in so she was kneeling in front of Ah Nian.Ah Nian looked down on her \u201cHa! There comes the day you are in my hands. Zhuan Xu gege said you saved his life so I won\u2019t kill you but you\u2019re going to suffer today. That day you\u2026..you\u2026..to me\u2026\u2026I have to get justice!\u201dAh Nian remembered Xiao Liu feeling her up all over that day and tears came to her eyes again. Zhuan Xu asked her many times but she never had the guts to tell him. After she came back to Five G.o.ds Mountain, she told her mom through tears but her mom just held her and patted her on the back.Ah Nian yelled \u201cGive me his hands!\u201dTwo servants held up Xiao Liu\u2019s hands, but since Ah Nian was so protected and knew nothing about true torture, all she could think of was to hit Xiao Liu\u2019s hands.Hai Tang grabbed a thick bat and struck Xiao Liu\u2019s handed hard. Xiao Liu smiled and purposely egged her on \u201cYour back was so soft and fragrant, even if you break my hands It\u2019s still worth it to feel you up. After I felt you up, I\u2019ve been dreaming\u2026..\u201dAh Nian\u2019s body was stiff and her face turning purple as her tears came streaming down.Gao Xing was a very conservative society with an emphasis on etiquette and manners. The body of the Princess\u2026\u2026the servants were all stunned and Hai Tang shoved a shoe in Xiao Liu\u2019s mouth to keep her from saying anymore.Hai Tang said to Ah Nian \u201cPrincess, this b.a.s.t.a.r.d is purposely angering you, don\u2019t fall for his tricks. You have your reputation and manners to uphold.\u201dThe other servants said otherwise \u201cPrince Zhuan Xu is the Xuan Yuan Kingdom prince, not a Gao Xing prince. He only lives here and is alive by the grace of His majesty. Why does Princess need to care what he thinks? Just kill him and then explain to the Emperor, he won\u2019t blame you.\u201dAh Nian was beyond furious \u201cHit him, hit him in the mouth then hands, and if he dies then I\u2019ll take responsibility!\u201dThe two servants grabbed sticks and started hitting.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t laugh anymore because all she could think of was what the servants just said. Zhuan Xu was sent here by the Yellow Emperor when he was very young, everyone knew he was pretty much a royal hostage. He was the token of the Yellow Emperor\u2019s promise not to attack Gao Xing. In over two hundred years, he never once went back to Xuan Yuan. In everyone\u2019s eyes, he appeared like the lofty Xuan Yuan prince, but in truth he was just a discarded son living under someone else\u2019s grace.When s.h.i.+ Qi came back with the iced melons and couldn\u2019t find Xiao Liu, he followed the trail to here but was kept outside by the guards. He could heard the sounds of striking from within and wanted to rush inside but couldn\u2019t when even more guards arrived.Because Ah Nian was the Grand Emperor\u2019s only daughter now, everyone was very careful so news was immediately pa.s.sed to Consort Jing An, Ah Nian\u2019s mother, as well as the Grand Emperor. Consort Jing An\u2019s residence was close so she got there first.She rushed inside and was relieved to see Ah Nian looking fine albeit spitting mad. Ah Nian saw her mom and immediately forced a smile and asked \u201cMom, why are you here?\u201dXiao Liu kept her head lowered to let the servants. .h.i.t her, but when she heard what Ah Nian said, her body shook and she wanted to look up but didn\u2019t dare. This woman might not be the Empress, but she was the only woman now in the Grand Emperor\u2019s life. Almost no one in the entire world had ever seen her before, rumors were that the Grand Emperor kept her hidden because she was so beautiful.Consort Jing An said nothing but Ah Nian called out \u201cStop!\u201dXiao Liu slowly raised her head and in the split second when she saw Consort Jing An\u2019s face, her entire body spasmed with pain and her heart was shattered. She cried out through the m.u.f.fled shoe in her mouth \u201cMom, mom\u2026\u2026\u201d Her cries was unintelligible but she desperately tried to crawl over and violently struggled to escape the hands of the servants holding her. She desperately reached for the woman wearing blue standing there.Xiao Liu\u2019s hands were b.l.o.o.d.y and bruised and the woman was startled and took a step back. Ah Nian quickly held her mother and screamed \u201cHold on to that lowlife!\u201dThe servants were afraid that Xiao Liu would hurt the Consort and violently pushed her down on the ground but Xiao Liu appeared to be possessed and her strength was shockingly great as she struggled with all her might to grab the Consort.\u201cMom, mom\u2026\u2026.\u201d Xiao Liu\u2019s mouth was stuffed up and she couldn\u2019t make a sound.The Consort looked at her like she was a crazed dog and Xiao Liu could only cry and cry and reach her hand towards her. She just wanted to hold her mom, to not let her leave again \u201cMom, mom\u2026.don\u2019t abandon me\u2026.\u201dShe wanted to ask why her mom abandoned her so many years ago. You promised to come pick me up, but you left and never returned. Did I do something wrong? No matter what I did wrong, if you tell me then I\u2019ll change! As long as you don\u2019t leave me! Am I really a cursed sp.a.w.n who should have never been born? Mom, you tell me, why don\u2019t you want me?When the Grand Emperor and Zhuan Xu rushed over, all they saw was a b.l.o.o.d.y Xiao Liu being pressed to the ground by servants as she struggled with all her might staring at Consort Jing An, her face streaked with tears, her hands outstretched, begging her not to leave \u201cMom, mom\u2026..\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s entire body shook and he appeared to be unsteady on his feet.Zhuan Xu felt his entire head burst open in that very second and he rushed forward like a crazed person. He pushed everyone aside and grabbed Xiao Liu as he cried \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao, she\u2019s not! She\u2019s not Auntie!\u201dZhuan Xu pulled the shoe out of his mouth and crumbled it into ashes. Xiao Liu\u2019s entire body was shaking like a dried leaf \u201cMom, she\u2019s mom. Gege, I want to ask her why she didn\u2019t want me anymore. Was it because I was being bad? I will be good, I promise I will be good, I will be good\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s entire face was buried in Xiao Liu\u2019s shoulder as his tears came down \u201cShe\u2019s not Auntie, Auntie already died on the battlefield. She is Consort Jing An, she just looks a lot like Auntie.\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s entire body shook and she howled through her tears like a wounded wolf \u201cShe said she would come pick me up, she said she would come pick me up. I waited for her for over 70 years! She never came, she didn\u2019t want me anymore! I don\u2019t blame her but I just want to know why\u2026..:Zhuan Xu tightly embraced her, just like when they were small, when his father died, his mother committed suicide, in those endless dark nights he held her tightly.Xiao Liu\u2019s cries gradually subsided but her body continued to shake and spasm. She could feel Gege\u2019s tears silently soaking the collar of her robe. He was still like when they were kids, no matter how hurt, he would never let anyone see him cry. Only her. Xiao Liu\u2019s hands slowly reached out and encircled his back and she tightly hugged him back.The two of them said nothing, just tightly holding each other. They were each other\u2019s comfort, each other\u2019s strength.Ah Nian stared at them in shock and she called out \u201cZhuan Xu gege.\u201dZhuan Xu was like a rock statue, unmoving with his head buried in Xiao Liu\u2019s shoulder, no one could see his expression.Ah Nian called out \u201cFather, they\u2026.they\u2026.\u201dHer father appeared to have aged another hundred years as he wearily said to the servants \u201cTake the Consort and Princess back to rest.\u201dThe servants bowed and half a.s.sisted half carried the Consort and Ah Nian out of the room. Ah Nian felt frightened, this premonition that her world was about to change but she didn\u2019t know how, so she kept turning to look back at Zhuan Xu.The room quickly emptied out leaving only s.h.i.+ Qi and the Grand Emperor. After a long time, Zhuan Xu slowly raised his head and stared at Xiao Liu, his eyes clear without a hint of tears.This became yet another secret just between the two of them. Xiao Liu\u2019s heart quickened and she nervously turned her head to avoid Zhuan Xu\u2019s stare but he said \u201cYou already called me Gege, no use trying to deny it now.\u201dXiao Liu wanted to laugh but couldn\u2019t. Zhuan Xu softly called \u201cXiao Yao.\u201dIt had been so long since she heard this name that she felt scared and unsure. Zhuan Xu called again \u201cXiao Yao, I am Zhuan Xu, your cousin, you call me Gege.\u201dXiao Liu remembered the first time they met when they were kids. Mom and Auntie were still alive back then. Mom smiled \u201cXiao Yao, you have to listen to your older brother from now on.\u201d Auntie smiled and said \u201cZhuan Xu, you have to watch out for your little sister.\u201d The two of them glared at each other like enemy crows. Then Auntie committed suicide, and then Mom died on the battlefield\u2026.and they were the only ones left.Xiao Liu said in a soft voice \u201cGege, I\u2019ve come back.\u201dZhuan Xu wanted to smile but couldn\u2019t as his lips quivered. s.h.i.+ Qi walked over and said \u201cXiao Liu\u2019s hands are injured.\u201dZhuan Xu hurriedly called for medicine. The Grand Emperor\u2019s personal retainer had the medicine ready and was waiting outside and rushed in with everything when he heard Zhuan Xu calling. Xiao Liu\u2019s hands were treated and bandaged quickly.The doctor reported to the Grand Emperor \u201cIt\u2019s just an external injury, no bones or nerves were injured. It will heal in a few days.\u201dThe Grand Emperor nodded and the retainers all disappeared quietly.Zhuan Xu helped Xiao Liu up but Xiao Liu\u2019s head was down and she refused to move. Zhuan Xu shoved her forward until she was standing in front of the Grand Emperor. He then back up until he was standing with s.h.i.+ Qi in the back.Xiao Liu kept her head down, staring at her hands and saying nothing.The Grand Emperor spoke first \u201cYou purposely upset Ah Nian so that she would hurt you, wasn\u2019t that just to get me to show up. I\u2019m here so why are you not speaking?\u201dXiao Liu purposely upset Ah Nian so she would fly into a rage and cause a ruckus so the Grand Emperor would come and see. Xiao Liu\u2019s conflicted feelings made her want to see what he would do, how he would see. She was even ready to mock everything, but the appearance of Consort Jing An disrupted her plans.That person, who once caused Xiao Liu to be so sad she couldn\u2019t even eat, she thought many times of what made her better than Mom. But she never expected that she would look so much like Mom. Plus she was wearing blue so at first sight she was exactly like Mom. All those angry feelings were washed away and all she felt was regret and uncertainty.Xiao Liu knelt down and the words came right up to her lips but she shouldn\u2019t say it, so she bowed her head to the ground, she then bowed again, and then a third time\u2026.The Grand Emperor knelt down and stopped her. Xiao Liu bit her lips and still couldn\u2019t say the words.The Grand Emperor said \u201cThese past two hundred years, there is likely a lot of people who said all sorts of things to you. I once had a lot of things I wanted to say to you. I kept thinking of what I wanted to say when I found you. In the beginning, I wanted to tell you stories to make you happy. Then later how to comfort you. Then later I wanted to hear what you had to say, how you have changed. Then later I kept remembering when you were small and called me Daddy, Daddy. Then finally I thought nothing mattered as long as you are alive. Xiao Yao\u2026..\u201d The Grand Emperor waved his hand and a water spirit formed eagle appeared and zoomed towards Xiao Liu, then suddenly changed into a tiger leaping.This was Xiao Liu\u2019s favorite game when she was small. Every day she would wait outside court before the session ended, with her neck outstretched, waiting for her Daddy. When she saw a tired weary form emerge, she would jump up and loudly call \u201cDaddy, daddy\u201d and rush into his arms. Her daddy would laugh and pick her up with one hand and use the other to conjure all sorts of spirit creatures.Xiao Liu rushed into the Grand Emperor\u2019s arms as her tears spilled forth.The Grand Emperor held his daughter, after three hundred years, after her laughter turned into tears, his daughter was finally home. Xiao Liu said \u201cThey say you\u2026.you don\u2019t want me anymore. Why didn\u2019t you come to Jade Mountain to pick me up?\u201dThe Grand Emperor patted her on the back \u201cBack then I didn\u2019t pick you up because your five uncles revolted and there was battles to the West and a.s.sa.s.sinations in the Palace. I was worried I couldn\u2019t handle it alone and you would be injured. So I wanted the Royal Mother to take care of you in Jade Mountain. Wait until I finished ending the revolt then I would pick you up. Who knew you would sneak off the mountain. If I knew this would happen, I would have kept you by my side no matter the danger.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cAre you really my father?\u201dThe Grand Emperor raised her face and looked directly into her eyes and said with absolute certainty \u201cI am your father! Even if you don\u2019t call me dad, I am always your father!\u201dXiao Liu suddenly felt like a dam burst and she was laughing and crying \u201cDaddy\u2026..daddy.\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled and helped Xiao Liu up and handed her a white handkerchief. She wiped her face but her eyes felt so heavy like she wanted to keep crying, like the tears she had been holding back for hundreds of years needed to come out.Zhuan Xu was all smiles as he walked over with s.h.i.+ Qi following behind.Xiao Liu looked at s.h.i.+ Qi and felt so guilty \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026\u201d wanting to explain but not sure how to say anything.The Grand Emperor shook his head \u201cHe\u2019s a member of the Tu Shan clan of foxes. He\u2019s way smarter than you. Even if initially he didn\u2019t know, he likely long since figured it out.\u201dXiao Liu smiled wanly. He\u2019s right, neither the Grand Emperor nor Zhuan Xu were easy going people. For them to endure and be patient for so long, there were very few people in the world that would merit such treatment.s.h.i.+ Qi bowed to the Grand Emperor who asked \u201cTu Shan Jing?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi respectfully answer \u201cIt is I.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said very leisurely \u201cI remember you are engaged to the youngest daughter of the Fang Feng family. Or am I mistaken?\u201dJing started to sweat and he answered very stiffly \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t engaged? Or no, I am not mistaken?\u201d\u201cYes, Your majesty is not mistaken.\u201dXiao Liu couldn\u2019t watch this anymore and said \u201cDad!\u201dThe Grand Emperor looked at s.h.i.+ Qi for a long time and then said to Xiao Liu \u201cI made a residence in the court where your mother used to stay. If you want to move there, It can be arranged. I moved back to my old residence. If you like any court then pick one, there are plenty sitting empty.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to stay in Hua Yin Court so I can talk with Gege.\u201dZhuan Xu was happy but worried and shot a glance at the Grand Emperor \u201cI want to live with you, too, but once you become a girl again and live in the same residence as me, that won\u2019t be proper.\u201d\u201cI\u2026..\u201d Xiao Liu wanted to say something but she looked at the Grand Emperor and Zhuan Xu and swallowed it. She can discuss it later.The Grand Emperor said \u201cJust stay there for now. When I make the official announcement of your return, then you can move.\u201dZhuan Xu happily bowed \u201cThank you, Master.\u201dThe Grand Emperor wanted to spend more time with her but knew she needed time so he made an excuse to leave. After he left, Xiao Liu\u2019s tightly wound body relaxed. She knew he was one of her closest, and remembered how much her dad loved her when she was small, but with the hundreds of years apart, she wanted to get close to him but felt nervous and awkward, plus some trepidation.Zhuan Xu took s.h.i.+ Qi and Xiao Liu back to Hua Yin Court and s.h.i.+ Qi was silent the entire way. Zhuan Xu had the maids help Xiao Liu wash up and change and dinner was ready by them.Xiao Liu\u2019s hands were injured so couldn\u2019t hold a chopstick. s.h.i.+ Qi wanted to feed her and was about to reach out his hand when Zhuan Xu took it first \u201cIt\u2019s my little sister, you\u2019ll have to wait your turn.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi silently said down with no anger but seemingly with a lot on his mind.Zhuan Xu fed Xiao Liu and he did it so well and at ease she asked \u201cWhen did you take care of people with hand injuries?\u201dZhuan Xu explained \u201cI once disguised myself and joined the army for ten plus years. In the army, there is no one to serve you. When soldiers are injured. everyone helps each other. I fed soldiers, and soldiers fed me.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cNo wonder you\u2026..your earthy aura is so strong. You must\u2019ve done a lot of different things.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cGrandfather and Master both said to experience more. Since I can\u2019t do anything serious, might as well try stuff out.\u201dAfter dinner and was.h.i.+ng up, the maid brought a bowl of water to wash hands. Zhuan Xu laughed and grabbed it and shoved it under Xiao Liu\u2019s lips \u201cDon\u2019t you want to drink it? If it\u2019s not enough, you can drink mine as well.\u201dXiao Liu ducked and started laughing, as did s.h.i.+ Qi. Zhuan Xu used his finger to poke Xiao Liu \u201cYou! Thank G.o.d Master has the patience.\u201dEven after three hundred years apart, perhaps it\u2019s because their blood was connected, and because each tucked the other person away deep inside the heart, the two of them had no awkwardness and could joke with each other without reservation.It got dark and the maids lit the sconces in the hall. The three leaned on jade pillows and started drinking on the pallet. s.h.i.+ Qi was silent and Xiao Liu would sneak peeks at him.Zhuan Xu put down his wine and went to change, but then didn\u2019t return for a long time, clearly to give Xiao Liu and s.h.i.+ Qi time to talk privately.Xiao Liu knew s.h.i.+ Qi guessed her real ident.i.ty, but seeing with his own eyes is still very different. She knew s.h.i.+ Qi didn\u2019t want her to be the Grand Emperor\u2019s daughter, the granddaughter of the Yellow Emperor. Just like she didn\u2019t want him to be the son of the Tu Shan clan. But the only thing a person cannot choose is birth.Xiao Liu said \u201cWhatever you want to ask or say, go right ahead.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cActually, I don\u2019t care who you are. You are just you. Except things have become more and more complicated.\u201dXiao Liu raised an eyebrow \u201cWhat? You scared now?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi smiled \u201cI\u2019ve always been scared. To desire comes worry, to love comes fear. It would be strange not to be scared.\u201dThe s.h.i.+ Qi under the lamp was so warm, so calm, so peaceful, even Xiao Liu felt her heart warm. She laughed \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi played with his wine and smiled \u201cWhat shall I call you from now on? When do I see your real face?\u201d\u201cMy father is the Grand Emperor. My mother is the daughter of the Yellow Emperor, she is the Xuan Yuan Princess. My full name is Gao Xing Jiu Yao. Because my forehead has the birthmark of a peach blossom, my parents gave me the nickname Xiao Yao, from the poem about how the peach blossom is blooming. But for now, you can still call me Xiao Liu.\u201dXiao Liu only answered his first question and for the longest time never answered the second.Zhuan Xu came back and said \u201cXiao Yao, now there is only the three of us, I want to see your real face.\u201dXiao Liu leaned back and looked at the sky, and then she spoke \u201cThese past things I\u2019ll only say once. If later on Dad and Grandfather ask about it, then Gege you go tell them!\u201dZhuan Xu sat down next to her \u201cFine!\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s voice started \u201cDuring the final battle between the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor and Sheng Nong\u2019s General Qi Yo, my mother died during battle. Before she went to battle, she left me with the Royal Mother in Jade Mountain. I wanted to go home, but year after year I waited and Dad never came to get me. I was very immature then, and the Royal Mother rarely spoke and never smiled, every day forcing me to practice my spiritual powers. I hated her, and one time when Dad had a servant bring a present for me, I hid in the undercarriage and escaped down the mountain. Initially I wanted to hide in the carriage all the way home to Five G.o.ds Mountain, to scare Dad and ask why he didn\u2019t bring me home. I wanted him to tell me that Mom wasn\u2019t dead. On the way home, the two servants were gossiping about me. They said a lot of bad things about my mom and me. They called me a b.a.s.t.a.r.d sp.a.w.n. They said I was so pathetic, wanting to go back to Five G.o.ds Mountain, but my dad would never bring me back. It was his grace that he didn\u2019t have me killed. That was when I learned that my mom actually divorced my dad! She wasn\u2019t my dad\u2019s wife anymore!\u201dXiao Liu\u2019s voice became so dark and even s.h.i.+ Qi and Zhuan Xu knew that she was only sharing some of what she heard because the rest was too horrible to even discuss again. How could she have felt when she heard it all and was still so young.\u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly how I felt \u2013 despair, disappointment, rage, disbelief \u2013 I hated my mom, hated my dad\u2026..my entire head was spinning. When the servants stopped to rest, I snuck away and didn\u2019t know where to go but knew I couldn\u2019t go back to Five G.o.ds Mountain. But that was the only home I knew, I didn\u2019t know where else to go. I followed the way to Yi Zhou because I heard that was where my mom died. I didn\u2019t know what to do and just walked on. Probably because I was so cute, people were nice to me and fed me. One time an uncle let me ride in his carriage and said he was headed the same way. I sat down and he took me to his residence. He was nice to me, told me stories and made me laugh. I felt like Dad didn\u2019t want me anymore so I thought he could be my dad. But one day he tried to take my clothes off, and even though I didn\u2019t understand what was happening, I remembered the Royal Mother saying that a girl cannot take her clothes off randomly. I wasn\u2019t willing so he hit me and I accidentally killed him. I was\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Liu gestured to the height of an eight year old human girl \u201cJust this tall. I couldn\u2019t believe a person could have so much blood, my clothes were soaked in his blood.\u201dZhuan Xu knew now why Master couldn\u2019t find Xiao Yao, she had been hidden away by a human in his residence.Xiao Liu was cold but didn\u2019t want to move and only curled up to keep telling her past. s.h.i.+ Qi got up and opened a blanket, lightly covering her with it. He wanted to sit back down but Xiao Liu grabbed his sleeve and s.h.i.+ Qi sat down next to her.\u201cDad and Grandfather made a proclamation to the world looking for me. Many people started looking for me. Some wanted to bring me in for the reward, others wanted to kill me. I saw a little girl my age get killed. Some demons wanted to eat me because rumor was that I was bathed in the holy Yang Valley water when I was born, and live in Jade Mountain for 70 years. The Royal Mother was very harsh with my training but generous with her bounty and I ate whatever treasures were there w.i.l.l.y nilly. So rumor was that eating me would increase their power multiple folds. I was afraid and started running and hiding. One time I hid with beggars but the people chasing me had us cornered. I was so scared and dreamed that if I could change my looks, if I was covered with the pox, my eyes crooked, my nose flat, my forehead without the birthmark, then they wouldn\u2019t recognize me. They checked all the kids and when they got to me, I thought I was a goner but they looked at my face and let me go. I didn\u2019t know why until I got to the river and discovered that I changed my face. I transformed into exactly the face I was thinking of. And after trying it time and again, I learned that I not only could change my face, I could change my gender as well. After learning I had this ability, I was rarely in danger.\u201dZhuan Xu had so many questions but he didn\u2019t ask and only listened.Xiao Liu looked at the sky and calmly continued.\u201cIn the beginning I was so excited and changed my face every few days. After a year the people chasing me gradually decreased and I felt safe. I changed my face all the time and traveled the vast wilderness. One day I looked in the mirror and discovered that I forgot what my real face looked like. I desperately tried to remember and rea.s.semble it but nothing looked it. Initially I tried not to be nervous, I knew magic transformation could never destroy the true face. I tried to learn the magic to transform back and discovered that there was no transformation ability quite like mine. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t find my real face anymore.\u201dXiao Liu closed her eyes \u201cThose days were like an nightmare, my face changing all the time. I walked on the street and a girl walked towards me and if her eyes were pretty and I thought about it, my eyes would become hers. I was so nervous every day, and at night I would worry about it and my face would change even in my dreams so I woke up with a new face. I was constantly changing and every face was a false one. I was too scared to look in the mirror or see anyone. One day I was eating at a restaurant when I heard a girl call grandmother and remembered my grandmother and my face changed and everyone saw it and screamed. I rushed out the restaurant and ran and ran until I ran into the mountains. I hid there seeing no one. I had no mirror and when I washed my face in the river I closed my eyes. If I didn\u2019t look at myself, it didn\u2019t matter what my face turned into because I was still me.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi and Zhuan Xu were both very distressed. They knew Xiao Yao had experienced very bad things, but they never would have imagined that she would lose her face. Everyone envied the G.o.ds for having spiritual powers and could change their forms, but to lose oneself is the biggest nightmare of all.\u201cI lived like a beast and thanks to the Royal Mother\u2019s harsh training I had pretty decent powers and the normal beasts were no match for me. It was free in the mountains but there was no one to talk to and I was very lonely. But I didn\u2019t dare leave so I started talking to myself. Later I talked to a snake demon in training but it didn\u2019t want to talk to me. I stole its egg so it would chase me every day to kill me. I would run and talk to it. It understood what I was saying but hadn\u2019t developed the ability to talk yet so I would talk for it and converse with myself. My talkative habit was formed there. Day after day, year after year, I didn\u2019t know how much time pa.s.sed, and it was only later I learned 20 years had pa.s.sed.\u201dZhuan Xu held her hand tightly, as if wanting to give that frightened lonely girl some companions.h.i.+p. He asked with a raspy voice \u201cHow did you maintain your face?\u201d\u201cOne day I met a man and he candidly admitted he was a demon and was gravely injured and was seeking medicines. He talked to me so I talked to you. Initially I was very wary so I sat far from him and ran away after a few words. After a long time and I kept testing him, he never expressed any ulterior motive towards me. So I talked more to him and he wasn\u2019t afraid of my changing face. He changed his face and I changed my face and we had a compet.i.tion and had a great laugh about it. In front of him I didn\u2019t feel like a monster, I didn\u2019t feel scared so I gradually trusted him. One night he caught me and wanted to take me away. The snake demon got mad and wanted to stop him but he killed it. He took me to a far off Southern place where the mountains was tall and perilous. He hid me in a remote cave where he built a nest and a cage to raise me in. He said he was the Nine-tailed fox, a hundred years ago my mother\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026friend cut one of his tails off. He was greatly injured and his powers were severely diminished. Because of my special body, he wanted to raise me for tens of years to become the best medicine.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s face changed and he pulled out his satchel with the furry white fox tail \u201cIs this his?\u201dXiao Liu nodded her head and Zhuan Xu wanted to destroy the white fox tail but Xiao Liu s.n.a.t.c.hed it away and wrapped it around her wrist and continued talking.\u201cThat b.a.s.t.a.r.d fox demon hated my mom, and not just because my mom\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026friend injured him. It was also because my mom killed my ninth uncle and he was best friends with my ninth uncle. Whenever he thought of my ninth uncle, he would curse my mom with the most vicious loathsome insults. But mom was dead so he could only torture me. I was raised by him for 30 years, tortured by him for 30 years. One night he said that in two more full moon nights then he could eat me. He sang a sad song and got drunk and didn\u2019t shut the cage completely. I had been devising how to run away for 30 years so I opened the cage and came out and secretly poisoned his drink then snuck back in the cage. He didn\u2019t sense anything odd and the second day I tried to get him drunk by purposely mentioning my ninth uncle. He beat me up and started drinking again and ingested the poison that I developed from all the weird things he had been feeding me. He collapsed on the floor and returned to his true fox form. I climbed out the cage and he opened his eyes and looked at me. I picked up a knife and cut off each of his tails. After I cut off a tail, I would show it to him. His entire fox mouth was covered in blood but in his eyes was the sense of release. He closed his eyes and I lit a fire and burned the entire cave down.\u201dXiao Liu picked up the fox tail \u201cHe locked me in a cage for 30 years, cursing and torturing me, stripping all my powers developed on Jade Mountain and turned me into a useless person. But he taught me many things. In the mountain it was just the two of us. When he wasn\u2019t having a crazy fit, he explained the various transformation powers to me and gave me a priceless treasure. It was the mirror made from the soul of a mystic gorilla beast that could record the past. He told me to use the mirror to record my face so that if it changed the next day I could use the mirror to change back. Gradually I learned to hold my face and when he took me out occasionally he would teach me how to differentiate between the plants and told me all the various demons and beasts he had killed. He told me all the weaknesses of the various types. In the end when I killed him, when I cut off each of his remaining 8 tails, then he and I ended our vengeance at that time. I\u2019ve long stopped hating him so just keep this tail!\u201dXiao Liu handed the tail to Zhuan Xu \u201cThe Nine-tailed fox is as rare a beast as the phoenix. I can transform myself so this tail has no use for me. You keep it, in the future you can use it to help you transform and break through mystic enchantments.\u201dZhuan Xu tossed it on the ground in disgust \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201dXiao Liu knew Zhuan Xu was furious right now so pointed to s.h.i.+ Qi to pick it up. She said to him \u201cThat night in the inn when you asked me to show you my true form, I declined not because I was planning to abandon you and disappear forever. It\u2019s because I couldn\u2019t show you my true form. That fox dummy mocked me correctly, if I don\u2019t know what I really look like, how can she transform into me.\u201dZhuan Xu was so angry that the anger even rubbed off on s.h.i.+ Qi who carried the Nine-tailed fox lineage \u201cThey say the Nine-tailed fox is adept at transformation, what problem does Xiao Yao have that she can\u2019t return to her true form?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi thought and realized that Xiao Yao\u2019s childhood face was probably already a false one. If she had a false face from the moment she was born, that meant the Grand Emperor and the Xuan Yuan Princess must have used an incredibly powerful magic or the a.s.sistance of a magical object to transform the face of an newborn infant who had no powers yet. And do so in a way not to be seen through by others. But why? This inexplicable action must be hiding a huge secret, but one done so they could protect Xiao Yao. s.h.i.+ Qi slowly said \u201cI don\u2019t know either. You should go ask the Grand Emperor, perhaps he will know why.\u201dZhuan Xu was very perplexed and turned to Xiao Liu \u201cI can\u2019t see your true form so I feel like you\u2019re hiding in a sh.e.l.l. I\u2019m scared that if I open the sh.e.l.l, you\u2019ll run away again.\u201dXiao Liu teased him \u201cWhat do you want me to look like? I\u2019ll transform into her for you. You can have whatever little sister you want.\u201dZhuan Xu was exasperated and raised his fist \u201cAre you itching for a fight?\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cI can\u2019t beat you in a fight anymore\u201d then turned to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cWhen we were kids, he could never beat me in a fight.\u201dZhuan Xu remembered how all Xiao Yao\u2019s powers were forcibly stripped from her, and the pain she must have endured, and how she would never be able to develop her powers ever again. All his tamped down rage bubbled forth and he couldn\u2019t pretend to be unaffected anymore. He stood up abruptly and rushed towards his room \u201cI\u2019m going to rest.\u201dXiao Liu looked at his departing back and murmured \u201cIt\u2019s all in the past now.\u201dXiao Liu stood up and said to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cI\u2019m off to rest as well.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi said to Xiao Liu \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find your true form.\u201dXiao Liu laughed. They all wanted to see what she looked like but the person who most wanted to know what she looked like in this world was herself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI\u2019m having such a great time translating Lost You Forever and am loving all the great discussion in the comments section of each chapter. Those asking what they can do to in thanks for my taking on this translation project? Comment more and go ahead and share your thoughts, that makes the hard work worth it for me knowing I\u2019m spreading the enjoyment around. Chapter 9 was a very heavy chapter to read as we finally get Xiao Yao\u2019s back story of how she became Wen Xiao Liu living in Qing Shui Town. She has revealed bits and pieces to Xiang Liu before, but this is the first time she shared the entire experience and she did so with her beloved cousin Zhuan Xu and her confidante Jing. Too bad Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t around to make it a party, but I\u2019m going to say her interactions with Xiang Liu strike the balance of never being able to see the light. She can take Jing and Zhuan Xu home to meet her dad if she wants either guy, but I don\u2019t think introducing daddy to her push and pull buddy is going to fly over so well. I loved how the Grand Emperor met Jing and then promptly asked if he was engaged and left poor Jing sweating bullets. Xiao Yao might be a Princess and her future not always up to her own choice, but it\u2019s pretty clear those around her want to do what they can to make her happy. Her dad is carrying on hundreds of years of guilt, and Zhuan Xu operates on the same wavelength as Xiao Yao which is that they always put each other\u2019s wants first. Xiao Yao isn\u2019t quite back to being a Princess yet, not until there is a way to reveal her true face, but it\u2019s nice that she\u2019s finally stopped running and is home at last. Even if her home isn\u2019t all peace and quiet these days with angry little sister Ah Nian around, but I feel like Xiao Yao loves these little distractions and conflicts because it beats being lonely and left alone. That is what struck me about her and Xiang Liu, that a part of her liked his picking on her from the very beginning, while the other half enjoys the mundane existence of Xiao Liu.Chapter 10 \u2013 Who Knows Your Sorrow:Ah Nian came to Hua Yin Court to find Zhuan Xu and saw he wasn\u2019t there. She saw Xiao Liu soaking her hands in healing water and rushed forward to upend the bowl.Xiao Liu leaned back and rested her legs on the table, looking at Ah Nian with a crooked smile and not a care in the world.Ah Nian glared at him, from head to toe, from toe to head, she couldn\u2019t see a single thing that made this dirt bag any good. Last night she went to complain to her daddy and told him all about Xiao Liu\u2019s various crimes but her daddy instead said Xiao Liu never intended to hurt her so she should stop being mad at him. She was so upset and told him about how Xiao Liu felt her up all over. She thought her daddy would fly into a rage but not only wasn\u2019t he angry, he seemed oddly amused and comforted her \u201cIn a little while later, I will announce something and this won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201dWhen Ah Nian left her daddy\u2019s residence, she thought about what he said and how could a woman not be bothered that a man felt her up? That would only be\u2026..if that man became her husband.Ah Nian felt like she was going crazy! She kept telling herself it was impossible, it could never be! But\u2026\u2026he was her royal father, an Emperor who didn\u2019t care about birth and elevated to high positions people who had talent. After he became Emperor, he never named an Empress even though the entire Gao Xing court was against him. He never picked a wife from the Gao Xing n.o.ble families and instead brought her mother from a remote village where she was a servant and made her his consort. It was clearly possible that he would marry Ah Nian to a low born commoner.Ah Nian thought all night about it and rushed to see Zhuan Xu gege to ask him for help, but all she saw was Xiao Liu.When did Xiao Liu move into Hua Yin Court? How come she knew nothing about it? Why would Zhuan Xu allow Xiao Liu to live in his residence? Did Zhuan Xu agree with what her dad wanted\u2026\u2026. Yes, yes! Zhuan Xu was very respectful of her dad, so if her dad wanted\u2026..then Zhuan Xu gege would support it.Ah Nian glared at Xiao Liu as her face reflected all her changing thoughts. She was alternatively gritting her teeth and then almost bursting into tears. Xiao Liu c.o.c.ked her head and stared, completely baffled why this chit was acting like this today.Xiao Liu waved at Ah Nian \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201dAh Nian\u2019s hands balled into a fist and she hollered \u201cI am NOT OKAY!\u201dXiao Liu glanced at her fists \u201cDon\u2019t use force, today if you use force then I\u2019ll return it.\u201dAh Nian wandered around the yard back and forth thinking of what to do. Beat Xiao Liu to death? But there were servants all around, and there was a strange man lurking near the windows. With her daddy and Zhuan Xu\u2019s smarts, there was no way she would succeed here.Ah Nian sat down across from Xiao Liu and angrily spit out \u201cLet me say it now \u2013 I will never marry you! If you marry me, I will fight with you every day! I will make every day a living h.e.l.l for you! I will eventually beat you to death!\u201dXiao Liu was totally confused \u201cI never thought about marrying you!\u201dAh Nian was delighted \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m a Princess!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re a Princess that I don\u2019t want to marry you!\u201dAh Nian didn\u2019t understand why Xiao Liu said that but she was just happy he didn\u2019t want to marry her. She said \u201cIf you act even worse then my royal father will not approve of you. He\u2019ll dislike you, so keep on doing that and I\u2019ll forgive you and stop trying to punish you.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cSure, I guarantee your dad won\u2019t make you marry me.\u201d\u201cYou promise?\u201dXiao Liu raised her hand and solemnly sweared \u201cI promise that the Grand Emperor will never marry the Princess to me, otherwise I\u2019ll die a thousand deaths!\u201dAh Nian was relieved and then leaned in to whisper \u201cIn a few days will be Little Zhu Rong\u2019s Autumn Tournament held once every ten years. It allows the young people to socialize and also show their talents. All the powerful families in the vast wilderness will be in attendance. Daddy likes you and will send you there to meet people. At that time, I\u2019ll work with you and help you disappoint him.\u201dXiao Liu was a bit taken back. Ah Nian really was the daughter of an imperial family. She appeared innocent and clueless but since she was small she was absorbing the politics in the world. She knew the youths sent by the powerful families to the Autumn Tournament was someone powerful and would be the future family and clan leaders. If a person upset those people, then no matter how talented, one\u2019s future was limited. The Grand Emperor would never let such a person have an important position so this was a great strategy.Xiao Liu looked at Ah Nian \u201cYou\u2019re very smart but lack some polis.h.i.+ng. If you endure hards.h.i.+p then it\u2019ll polish you so that you can become of great use.\u201d Ah Nian had no need to fight for power or to struggle for survival so she didn\u2019t care whether she was of any use so Xiao Liu chuckled.Ah Nian gave Xiao Liu a warning glare \u201cDon\u2019t you dare like me!\u201dXiao Liu immediately retorted \u201cI will never like you!\u201dAh Nian huffed \u201cThen we\u2019re agreed. If my daddy won\u2019t send you then I\u2019ll fight for you to go, so don\u2019t forget your promise!\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stood under the awning to avoid Ah Nian and after she left he came over \u201cYou really want to go to Little Zhu Yen\u2019s Autumn Tournament?\u201dXiao Liu nodded \u201cZhuan Xu will go so I want to go with him. Before my dad announces me officially, before things completely change around me, I want to sneak in some last bit of freedom and fun.\u201d\u201cAre you very close with Zhuan Xu?\u201dXiao Liu answered \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about whether we\u2019re close or not. We fought as kids, we argued as kids, I called him Gege when I was happy, I called him Zhuan Xu when I wasn\u2019t. We played together, we laughed together, we ate from the same rice bowl, we slept under the same blanket. When I saw him hurt I wanted the pain to fall on me. When I saw others mock him I was in so much pain for him. Gege\u2019s suffered a lot all these years, his parents both died when he was small, and later my Mom raised him. After my Mom died in battle he was all alone, and when he was still small his various royal uncles all forced him to Gao Xing. Xuan Yuan is his homeland but there is no support for him there. He appears to be doing well in Gao Xing living as a Prince, but he\u2019s been exiled here and even the maids can look down on him. They think he survives by the grace of the Grand Emperor. We\u2019ve been apart for far too long so I don\u2019t exactly what he\u2019s endured, but right now all I want to do is spend more time with him.\u201d\u201cDo you wish to stay here by their side?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to spend time with them. But I\u2019m lazy now and don\u2019t want to be the Gao Xing Eldest Princess. But knowing my dad, my grandfather, Zhuan Xu\u2019s personality\u2026\u2026even Ah Nian that clueless one knows that it\u2019s pointless to go up against them.\u201d Xiao Liu sighed \u201cIf I didn\u2019t reappear it would be fine, but I\u2019m here now so they will never allow me to return to being Wen Xiao Liu. I ran away before not because I was angry at them, it was also because I knew that once I returned to my real ident.i.ty, it would be harder to leave here than to ascend to the Heavens.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi looked at Xiao Liu \u201cA person cannot choose their birth, even if we are unwilling, we must accept it.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi smiled warmly, a clear and gentle smile \u201cIf a heart is like a clean moon, even in the darkened clouds it will pa.s.s and the moon will return.\u201dXiao Liu pointed to her heart and asked half in jest half serious \u201cBut if the lady\u2019s heart is tainted, then will my lord\u2019s heart be clear like the moon and s.h.i.+ne it on the lady\u2019s heart.\u201dZhuan Xu walked in \u201cWhat are you guys talking about? I heard Ah Nian came by, did she pick a fight with you?\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cNo, we had a good talk.\u201dZhuan Xu apologized \u201cMaster already sent word to Grandfather and to the Royal Mother. You know your ident.i.ty is very special so Master will need to discuss with Grandfather, and also get the Royal Mother\u2019s agreement, before making the official proclamation to the world. So for now your ident.i.ty will remain concealed.\u201dXiao Liu yelped \u201cRoyal Mother! That old witch! And that smelly bird Lie Yang, and idiot Ah Bi! Lie Yang will kill me!\u201dZhuan Xu scolded her \u201cStop with the nonsense! Even Grandfather is respectful to the Royal Mother! Also Ah Bi has now evolved into human form and he is called Sir Bi so when you see him be respectful.\u201dXiao Liu remembered her childhood on Jade Mountain. Lie Yang was a demon bird that looked like a phoenix. His human form was that of a ten year old boy but he didn\u2019t like to take his human form. He had a terrible personality and every time she slacked off during training he would viciously peck her and chase her all over the peach blossom forest. Ah Bi was a winged fox demon but had not yet trained to evolve into human form back then. He was very smart and very gentle. Every time Lie Yang would peck her he would save her. After so many years apart, Ah Bi now had a human form, and she wondered if Lie Yang had grown taller.Back then she was too small, she didn\u2019t know any better. She felt that the Royal Mother and Lie Yang were so mean. Later when she used her powers to survive was when she realized what they were trying to teach her. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to go back to Jade Mountain, and perhaps they wouldn\u2019t mind that she was a face changing little monster, but by the time she decided to go back she had been captured and shoved in a cage and tortured for the next 30 years. She lost all her spiritual powers and knew she could no longer go back. She could only continue to wander.Xiao Liu asked \u201cWill Lie Yang and Sir Bi come?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIf the Royal Mother tells them, they will of course come.\u201dXiao Liu sighed \u201cWith so much time pa.s.sed, I\u2019m both excited and scared about the reunion.\u201dZhuan Xu rapped her on the head \u201cWhen did you get so maudlin? Master wants to dine together tonight. I told him all about what happened to you.\u201dThat night the Grand Emperor came to dine with them at Hua Yin Court and s.h.i.+ Qi was included. This time Xiao Liu summoned all her proper manners to dine, but even back then she was never a right and proper lady plus with two hundred years pa.s.sed, she pretty much forgot all her etiquette and was awkward all over.s.h.i.+ Qi a.s.sisted and provided reminders from time to time, whereas Zhuan Xu was totally hands off and sat by with a big smile waiting to watch Xiao Liu screw up. Xiao Liu pouted angrily \u201cYou\u2019re just like when we were kids, you\u2019re still a mean older brother!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s eyes flashed a moment of desolation, but then he laughed \u201cIf I\u2019m not picking on you, then who shall I pick on?\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just eat like you normally do.\u201dXiao Liu smiled sweetly \u201cDaddy is the best.\u201d She slumped forward and pulled her sleeves up. After dinner, the Grand Emperor asked Xiao Liu to stroll with him and the two headed out towards Qi Qing Garden.Qi Qing Garden had an abundance of water, flora, and exotic animals. Legend has it that the previous Grand Emperor loved strolling here the most. Xiao Liu remembered her mother bringing her here often to play. Sometimes staying the entire day, Xiao Liu playing in the water and fighting with the various animals while her Mom read. The entire Cheng En Palace was too big and many places she had never been to before. The two places she was most familiar with was her mom\u2019s residence Cue Xing Court and here in Qi Qing Garden.Xiao Liu strolled here and felt her nose getting twitchy and her eyes tearing up. It was exactly the same as in her memory and it was just like yesterday she was playing here.They pa.s.sed a pavilion and Xiao Liu suddenly rushed in and inspected a post and saw squiggly jagged lines carved on there. She excitedly cried out \u201cDaddy, look! My drawing is still here!\u201d\u201cAnd this! This is still here, too!\u201d There were three lines scratched on the past where Xiao Liu stood against it years ago and her dad marked her height. She crowed back then that she would grow taller than her dad until he could\u2019t mark the place for her.The pavilion had been renovated many times but these doodles were carefully preserved.The Grand Emperor kneeled with a smile \u201cThis was your greatest handiwork, and you told me that I had to keep it forever.\u201dXiao Liu suddenly embraced the Grand Emperor, even if they had already reunited, she still didn\u2019t feel like she had come home until now. Now she finally felt like she had come home.Xiao Liu\u2019s tear tumbled down and the Grand Emperor patted her on the pat, he didn\u2019t comfort her and just let her cry, to let her cry out a few hundred years worth of hurt and pain.Xiao Liu cried and cried, seemingly really going to cry three hundred years worth of tears. Finally she felt like it was too much and started hiccuping \u201cNormally I\u2019m not a crybaby.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cNo need to feel bad, it\u2019s my failing. A daughter\u2019s tears is a father\u2019s lacking.\u201dXiao Liu stopped crying and asked him to measure her height again. He marked a slash above her head and said \u201cYou grew and grew, but you didn\u2019t grow so tall that your dad can\u2019t mark your height.\u201dXiao Liu stuck out her tongue and then stared at the line with her face crestfallen \u201cI don\u2019t even know if this is my true height. I feel like everything is false.\u201d When she told Zhuan Xu what happened, she tried to act nonchalant as if she was used to having no face. But now her true fear emerged.The Grand Emperor touched her forehead and gradually a small peach blossom birthmark appeared in the middle. He said \u201cYou\u2019re face changing is not some weird disease. It\u2019s because you have a magical spiritual object in your body called the Face Forming Flower. It can allow a person to imprint any face.\u201dXiao Liu asked quizzically \u201cA spiritual object? I don\u2019t have a disease? The object causes my face to change at will? But why does my body have this spiritual object? Her face suddenly lit up \u201cDoes that mean if the object is removed, then my true face will emerge? I can become my real self then?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Liu was so happy \u201cDad, take it out for me! I hate transforming and would rather that I was a freakishly ugly girl than be a fake beauty.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s hand caressed the peach blossom birthmark and it glowed a red aura. Back then it required the spiritual power of two G.o.ds, himself and Xiao Yao\u2019s mother, to seal it in Xiao Yao\u2019s body. It would need the spiritual power of two G.o.ds now to remove it. \u201cRight now I can\u2019t remove it but dad promises that I will help you find your true face.\u201dXiao Liu wanted desperately to regain her true face immediately but knew her dad had a reason for not doing it right now. The Grand Emperor looked at the birthmark on Xiao Liu\u2019s forehead and in his eyes was such hidden sorrow. He waved his hand and the birthmark disappeared.After this big worry was lifted, Xiao Liu walked the garden with her daddy in a completely different mood. She chatted about everything and asked about anything. She even dared to suggest \u201cDaddy, can I not be the Gao Xing Eldest Princess? I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t want to be your daughter, I just don\u2019t want to be a princess.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re my daughter, I am the Grand Emperor of Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Liu immediately adopted the saddest puppy dog expression and grabbed her dad\u2019s arm and shook it while pleading \u201cBut it\u2019s so hard being the Princess. I have to eat properly, behave properly, and even my marriage is sacrificed to politics and gain. I don\u2019t want to be the Princess!\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cA person needs to have proper manners, it\u2019s not a bad thing. As for marriage, who do you think I\u2019ll sacrifice you to?\u201dXiao Liu blurted out \u201cI don\u2019t know who you will sacrifice me to, I just\u2026.I just\u2026..\u201dThe Grand Emperor looked at Xiao Liu \u201cI am the Grand Emperor, you are my daughter. You must be the Princess of Gao Xing. This is an imperial birthright, do you understand?\u201dXiao Liu lowered her head and whined \u201cCan I not understand?\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s hand caressed Xiao Liu\u2019s head and he said sadly \u201cI\u2019m not like any other dad, I have too much I need to deal with. I worry about a kingdom and its citizens. I cannot just let you do what you want. I need to protect my daughter and the only protection I can give my daughter is my authority. Only if you are the Gao Xing Princess can you enjoy the protection of the entire kingdom. Before anyone dares to harm you, they need to consider whether they can withstand the wrath of an Emperor. Xiao Yao, this is the only thing I can give you as a father who did not do his duty for you. Please don\u2019t reject it.\u201dXiao Liu felt her tears about to fall and she took a deep breath \u201cDad, I\u2019m willing to be the Princess.\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled \u201cBeing a Princess isn\u2019t all bad, at least you can misuse your authority and pick on people. You can be ruthless and lawless, taking whatever you want.\u201dXiao Liu gaped \u201cDaddy, are you sure you\u2019re teaching your daughter the right things?\u201dThe Grand Emperor grinned \u201cI work so hard as the ruler of the kingdom and for what? I can\u2019t do anything myself and I don\u2019t have the time even if I wanted to. You don\u2019t have that restriction. I can\u2019t do anything but you can do everything. Who said it\u2019s bad your dad is the ruler of a kingdom with supreme authority and can handle whatever you want to do.\u201dXiao Liu was so shocked and confused and so utterly thrilled to have a dad! Having a dad who let her so whatever she wanted was the best feeling ever!That night Xiao Liu talked to the Grand Emperor all night on the stone steps of the pavilion. She felt like she had so many stories to tell her dad \u2013 the first time she killed a tiger, when she stole the snake demon\u2019s egg, when she went to a brothel, when she opened a medical clinic, the farm wife who took her in and taught her to cook, the Lao Mu she brought home, the Chuan Zi and Ma Zi she rescued\u2026..so many things, so many people, she wanted to share it all so her dad would know.She wanted her dad to know that the last few hundred years wasn\u2019t all pain, there was a lot of fun things and happy times. Not everyone she met was bad, she met some really good people too. All these amazing adventures made her feel like she couldn\u2019t live a right and proper life as a Princess, and in fact she felt like the life she did lead was the one she was meant to live. She didn\u2019t want her dad to feel bad, to feel guilty anymore.Xiao Liu forgot where she had gotten with her stories when she fell asleep like she used to when she was small, right in her dad\u2019s lap. In the morning, Xiao Liu came out of her room stretching like a cat, wandering the courtyard before leaning on a tree and staring at the sunlight in contentment.Zhuan Xu and s.h.i.+ Qi were playing chess and looked over to see her standing against the flower tree. s.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s heart skipped a few beats but Zhuan Xu teased \u201cDid you steal a fish last night?\u201dXiao Liu pulled a flower \u201cI talked all night with dad.\u201d\u201cYou talk the most, but then you act like you haven\u2019t talk all that much.\u201dXiao Liu flew forward like she wanted to strangle Zhuan Xu \u201cLet me tell you, I may not have powers now but don\u2019t think I\u2019m easy to pick on. I can make you not talk and not move if you p.i.s.s me off.\u201dZhuan Xu quickly added \u201cFine, fine, fine. I\u2019m playing chess right now so don\u2019t mess it up.\u201dXiao Liu peered at the board and discovered it wasn\u2019t a normal chessboard. It was a magical one used by G.o.ds and she wanted to play.Zhuan Xu tried to plead \u201cI finally convinced s.h.i.+ Qi to play with me, when we\u2019re done with this match I\u2019ll play with you.\u201dXiao Liu pouted and walked over to s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cI want to play now.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi immediately put his pieces in her hand and Xiao Liu glared in victory at Zhuan Xu. She picked up a piece and surveyed the chessboard before putting it down and asking s.h.i.+ Qi \u201cThis place good?\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201d said s.h.i.+ Qi and Zhuan Xu at the exact same time. One said it in sarcasm, the other in gentle warmth.Zhuan Xu stood up and pushed Xiao Liu to his spot \u201cSince you\u2019re not going to let us play in peace, you play with him!\u201dXiao Liu clapped \u201cNow you\u2019re like an older brother!\u201dXiao Liu played Zhuan Xu\u2019s pieces and was her usual reneging on moves and generally being c.r.a.p at everything. But no matter what Xiao Liu did, s.h.i.+ Qi was patient and actually was playing seriously. But after each play he would teach Xiao Liu how to play better to avoid the next loss.The way Zhuan Xu saw it, it was like a kid throwing a temper tantrum and rolling around on the ground. An adult didn\u2019t stop him but also didn\u2019t agree with it, only standing to the side and talking maturely with the kid. After the first time, the second time, the third time, the fourth time\u2026\u2026Half an hour later, Zhuan Xu\u2019s great chess game was a complete and utter disaster under Xiao Liu\u2019s hands. Xiao Liu refused to play another piece and used her hands to upend the entire board and announced \u201cI won!\u201dZhuan Xu shook his head with a sigh but s.h.i.+ Qi smiled at Xiao Liu and looked very wistful and full of longing.Xiao Liu\u2019s heart leapt a few beats and she calmed down to stare at s.h.i.+ Qi.s.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dXiao Liu played with the chess piece and said nothing. s.h.i.+ Qi said \u201cI\u2019ve been worried but now am fully relieved that Zhuan Xu and the Grand Emperor are very good to you and you are very happy here. I need to go take care of my own matters now.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cI know. When are you leaving?\u201d\u201cLater I will go bid farewell to the Grand Emperor. I don\u2019t want people to know that Tu Shan Jing knows you so I will leave in the middle of the night and take the long route back to Qing Qiu.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cThen go say farewell to my dad!\u201dZhuan Xu stood up \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dXiao Liu sat in the courtyard waiting and s.h.i.+ Qi came back alone after a short while. Xiao Liu asked \u201cWhat did my dad say?\u201d\u201cAsked a few matters about my clan but nothing else much.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cIt\u2019s a few hours before sunset, what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s just sit here basking in the sun, smelling the flowers, and eating snacks.\u201dAll of Xiao Liu\u2019s favorite snacks were always prepared so s.h.i.+ Qi brought a plate over and sat down in the corridor with Xiao Liu and enjoyed the view of the flowers.Xiao Liu picked up a duck neck and munched \u201cMy dad said that my face transformation is due to a magical spiritual object in my body. When he removes it I won\u2019t transform anymore. What will you do if I\u2019m really ugly?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\u201cWhat if I am?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cYou think I\u2019m great if I\u2019m ugly?\u201d\u201cEveryone can appreciate a beautiful exterior, if I am the only one who can admire your beautiful interior then I\u2019m happy.\u201dXiao Liu felt her face redden and her heart beat faster. s.h.i.+ Qi lately was the type who chose not to say much, but whenever he said something he had her feel totally off-kilter.\u201cMy heart is pitch black, where\u2019s the beauty.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful and there is beauty in black.\u201dXiao Liu guffawed \u201cWe\u2019re like two peas in a pod.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi stared at her smiling and she grinned before sighing \u201cYou be careful.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cEven though your mother\u2019s actions led to what your brother did, I know you feel pity and want to stop the cycle of vengeance, but don\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cWorry? What me worry. I just think you\u2019re rather stupid and want to remind you out of the goodness of my heart.\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi smiled \u201cI\u2019ll take this fox tail that Zhuan Xu doesn\u2019t want. After I create a magical spiritual object for you, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dXiao Liu nodded. If the Nine-tailed fox is the King of the fox tribe, then the leader of the Tu Shan clan would be the King of the fox kings. There was no one else in this world better than Tu Shan Jing who knew how to use the fox tail.They ate snacks and chatted, talking about whatever came to mind, or silently sitting next to each other.The sun gradually set and the sky gradually darkened.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t eat anymore and washed her hands. s.h.i.+ Qi took out a handkerchief and Xiao Liu reached for it but he didn\u2019t hand it to her. He wrapped her hands in it and slowly dried it for it. Her hands were long dried but he still didn\u2019t let go. He tightly held on to her two hands.Xiao Liu\u2019s heart was a bit jumbled and she kept her head down.s.h.i.+ Qi said in a low voice \u201cFifteen years. Don\u2019t let another man into your heart.\u201dXiao Liu raised her head and said with an laugh \u201cThen what about fifteen years later? Can I let another man in fifteen years later?\u201ds.h.i.+ Qi\u2019s face darkened and he tightly gripped Xiao Liu\u2019s hands.Xiao Liu lightly shook their hands and softly said \u201cDon\u2019t worry and go. Fifteen years, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d Since that connection and longing couldn\u2019t be severed, then let it remain for fifteen years. After that fifteen years, whether the thread disappeared or became a web, no one knows.After dinner Zhuan Xu personally escorted s.h.i.+ Qi off Five G.o.ds Mountain. When he came back, he saw Xiao Liu laying on the pallet in the courtyard staring at the stars. He sat down \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cStar gazing.\u201d\u201cNot sad? I thought you really liked his company.\u201d\u201cI really do like his company, but what I know even more is that there is no person who can keep company forever in this life. You and I have experienced too many partings, that heartbreaking gutwrenching sorrow we have endured too many times. I don\u2019t want to hurt anymore so I learned to protect myself. You can call it being rational, or see it as being coldhearted. Zhuan Xu, do you have that feeling? If you have something and you like it so much, you will still remind yourself that it might be gone so you remain rational. Even if you like it it comes with a sense of melancholy, so when the time comes and it\u2019s gone, you can be fine accepting the loss.\u201dZhuan Xu slid down the pallet to sit on the ground and he leaned back against the pallet so his head was pressed against Xiao Liu\u2019s head as both of them looked up at the stars. After some time he spoke \u201cI thought I was the only one left in this world. But you\u2019ve come back, so I don\u2019t feel lonely anymore.\u201dCompared to Xiao Liu, Zhuan Xu was the real orphan. When he was very small, his father died in battle and his mother committed suicide on his father\u2019s grave. His grandmother died of illness, and the auntie who was taking care of him also died in battle. He lost all his relatives who would have protected him. To survive, he had no choice but to leave his homeland and come to Gao Xing all alone.Xiao Liu said \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Xiao Yao was a very selfish cruel person. She knew Zhuan Xu was waiting for her, she knew Zhuan Xu needed her, but because of her own fear she kept running.Zhuan Xu patted Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and said nothing. He always thought Xiao Yao would grow up like Ah Nian in the sunlight surrounded by rainbows, never seeing any darkness or danger. Like a Spring flower blooming so beautiful and pure. If Xiao Yao was like that, then Zhuan Xu would do everything in his power to protect her. But Xiao Yao today was not like he imagined, yet he wasn\u2019t disappointed. Instead he felt like this was the Xiao Yao he really wanted, no, she was even better than he could have envisioned. Despite the long time apart, they could still immediately understand what each other was thinking. Whether it was beautiful, whether it was ugly, one was not afraid to show it, the other completely understood it.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d Some things Xiao Yao kept inside and still never dared to share. She felt revealing it would be a mistake, would be deep pain, but not saying it felt like a bug growing inside her body gnawing at her insides. Only to Zhuan Xu could she share it without any hesitation.\u201cTell me!\u201d Zhuan Xu immediately said.\u201cThat Nine-tailed fox said I wasn\u2019t my daddy\u2019s daughter. He said that mom was a s.l.u.t and cheated on my dad with General Qi Yo of the Sheng Nong Kingdom. He said I was really the demon sp.a.w.n of the most vicious monster who ever lived Qi Yo.\u201d The Nine-tailed fox constantly insulted Xiao Yao\u2019s mom, and initially she was angry and didn\u2019t believe him, but after thirty years of hearing him say it over and over again, she started to get confused.Zhuan Xu shot up and stared in shock at Xiao Yao. So this was the real reason she was too scared to come home.Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion and terror \u201cThe Nine-tailed fox said that Qi Yo and my Mom were a pair of adulterous lovers and I was their love child. He said my mom was devious and lied to my dad and to the entire world by pa.s.sing me off. If my dad knew the truth, he would destroy the demon sp.a.w.n that was me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Zhuan Xu slapped his hand over Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cYou believe the words of that demon fox? Auntie killed Qi Yo with her own hands! Plus Master is so smart, how could he not know you\u2019re not his daughter? Be honest with yourself, how does Master treat you?\u201dXiao Liu stared at Zhuan Xu with her tears filled with tears \u201cSo I\u2019m daddy\u2019s daughter?\u201dZhuan Xu said with absolute certainty \u201cYou are definitely Master\u2019s daughter!\u201dDad and Gege were both the smartest of the lot, and if those two smart men reached that conclusion, then Xiao Liu finally relaxed and smiled \u201cYes, I\u2019m too foolish, I have to be daddy\u2019s daughter!\u201dZhuan Xu let out a relieved sigh and rubbed Xiao Yao\u2019s head \u201cIn the future, if you ever hear such nonsense, tell me and I\u2019ll handle it.\u201dXiao Liu nodded \u201cDo you know that Qi Qing Garden\u2019s pavilions have been renovated many times but my doodles have remained?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cMaster is a great man. Years ago when my four royal uncles wanted to eliminate me, I remembered my dad told me when he was still alive about the friends.h.i.+p between our eldest uncle and Master. Auntie also told me before that if I ever ran into any problems to write a letter to the Grand Emperor asking for help. I wrote to him when I had no other option left and he wrote back welcoming me to Five G.o.ds Mountain anytime. When I came I was filled with trepidation, but he treated me like I was his real son. He taught me how to run a nation and when I did well he was proud of me and when I made mistakes he never hesitated to punish me. One time I was injured by an a.s.sa.s.sin and he encouraged me to train my own personal guards. Do you know that my guards cannot even take orders from him. One time he purposely ordered something contrary to my orders, and those guards who listened to him were then killed because he told me that the people who guarded my life could only be loyal to me.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cDaddy is so great, then why would my Mom divorce him? I used to think it was because Dad did something wrong to Mom, but you see Ah Nian\u2019s mom. Ah Nian\u2019s real name is Gao Xing Yi, and Yi means memory while Nian means missing. Her name is all about missing someone and past memories. If Daddy was so missing the past and only had my Mom in his heart, then why would my Mom not want my Dad? Sometimes I really hate her!\u201dZhuan Xu remembered his mom and said with a sigh \u201cI don\u2019t know! We can\u2019t understand them! Sometimes I hate my mom, too. Right before she committed suicide, she held me in her arms and begged me to forgive her. She gave birth to me and then abandoned me. How can I forgive her?\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cIn the future if I had kids, I will never leave them no matter what happens.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIn the future when I marry a wife, I will ask for her whether she\u2019ll die if I die first. If she wants to die with me then I don\u2019t want her!\u201dXiao Liu and Zhuan Xu looked at each other and started laughing.Zhuan Xu\u2019s chin was resting on the pallet and his face was right next to Xiao Liu\u2019s hand \u201cWhen I\u2019m done preparing, let\u2019s go back to Xuan Yuan Mountain together. I want to know whether the red phoenix flowers in Cao Yun Court are still glorious, whether the mulberry tree grandmother planted is still as green.\u201dXiao Liu caressed his cheek \u201cThe road to Cao Yun Court is covered with blood.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled matter-of-factly \u201cThe road to power is always littered with blood and bones. I don\u2019t just want to go back to Cao Yun Court, I want the entire Xuan Yuan Mountain.\u201d In front of others he was always refined and charming, the n.o.ble young master who excelled at the arts and socializing. Only in front of Xiao Yao did he show his ruthlessness and ambition.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cYou go fight for it then!\u201d Just like a phoenix was destined to rise to the Heavens, Zhuan Xu was born to wield power. She knew that truth since she was very small.Zhuan Xu said \u201cRight now everyone in the Xuan Yuan Court is aligned with our royal uncles. I once used the merman tribe to request a summons to bring Prince Zhuan Xu back to Xuan Yuan and it was immediately opposed by the entire court. So if I am to go back, I need an excuse that no one can oppose. For that I\u2019m going to need to use you.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYou can use me all you want.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s face was nestled in the palm of Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and he said in a low voice \u201cIt\u2019s so good to have you back. I\u2019m not fighting all alone anymore.\u201d\u201cHey, I never said I was going to help you and fight with you.\u201dZhuan Xu lifted his head and smiled \u201cYou don\u2019t want to help? But its too bad because I\u2019m your Gege! So even if you don\u2019t want to help, the moment I\u2019m in danger you\u2019ll come running to help anyways.\u201dXiao Liu smacked him \u201cYou\u2019re shameless! People say a brother needs to protect his little sister, but you\u2019ve got it switched around and are shamelessly waiting for me to protect you!\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cI have no choice, I haven\u2019t been able to win in a fight with you since we were kids.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re not embarra.s.sed to bring that up now?\u201d\u201cXiao Yao\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s teasing faded and he got serious \u201cYou\u2019ve been whatever goes for so long, but I know you won\u2019t be able to sit back and watch me without getting involved. Once I go back to Xuan Yuan, whatever I do will clearly impact you. The people who want to get rid of me will try and harm you. So why should I act like you won\u2019t get involved? Rather than vowing not to get you involved, I\u2019d rather tell you up front so you are better prepared.\u201dXiao Yao patted Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand to indicate that she understood. She said \u201cZhuan Xu, do you remember? When grandmother was about to die, she grabbed both our hands and said that we were poor children and that we needed to stick to each other from then on and take care of each other.\u201d\u201cI remember.\u201d It was long engraved in his heart, how could he forget? Zhuan Xu vividly remembered their grandmother\u2019s dying request. Because his parents died so tragically, he grew up very young and he solemnly promised grandmother that he would protect his sister for life. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand at that time so she merely copied him and promised to protect her Gege for life.\u201cI thought grandmother was senile back then since you may be a poor orphaned kid but I wasn\u2019t. Look at us now! Grandmother likely already predicted what would have happened to us.\u201dZhuan Xu said softly \u201cBack then the laughter and joy blanketed the entire Cao Yuan Court \u2013 and now it\u2019s only the two of us left!\u201dXiao Yao was silent and then looked up at the stars. Zhuan Xu also looked up at the stars \u201cThank you grandmother, eldest uncle, second uncle, mom, dad, aunties, thank you for letting me reunite with my little sister.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt\u2019s amusing to watch how the main leads have really struck a chord with the readers, so much so that I\u2019ve seen sadness over Jing leaving and clamoring for more Xiang Liu who hasn\u2019t shown up for two chapters. Rest a.s.sured all three male leads are here to stay, but Lost You Forever is still first and foremost Xiao Yao\u2019s story so expect the male leads to be around here and there and sometimes one or more may be missing for chapters on end. It doesn\u2019t mean anything other than the story is bigger than just the romance element. Now that Xiao Yao is back in Gao Xing but not yet announced as a princess, she gets to observe and take in this world of royalty and power plays that she has left behind for three hundred years. She was never born for it, her personality as a kid was always the say it like it is type and she doesn\u2019t have either Zhuan Xu\u2019s ability to socialize and fit in nor Jing\u2019s ability to see everything as a business deal he can close. Unlike the kids of royals and n.o.bles, the one thing Xiao Yao does have is the ability to let it all go. She really doesn\u2019t care about wealth and power and the trappings of luxury, she can live in a shack pretending to be a n.o.body as long as she has someone to keep her company. She\u2019s given Jing a fifteen year promise to wait for him, but neither of them have thought about what to do after those fifteen years? Go back to Qing Shui Town together? He marries into the Gao Xing royal family? I like that she has the freedom to pick her man and like even more that she actually picks Jing. I worried she would be too scared to pick, forget not having a clue how she feels about the guys in her life. For now she like Jing and I hope she gets more happy times with him before she returns to life as a princess.Chapter 11 \u2013 A Grand Gathering For What Time:Little Zhu Rong was a direct descendant of the Sheng Nong imperial family, born into royalty and his father was the world renowned big hero Zhu Rong. When Little Zhu Rong\u00a0surrendered to the Yellow Emperor, he married the only daughter of the Chi Sui clan Chi Sui Xiao Ye. He was greatly utilized by the Yellow Emperor and became one of his top officials. He was given the entire Middle Plains to govern, an area that used to be under the control of the Sheng Nong Kingdom.Initially people didn\u2019t dare publicly critique the appointment since Little Zhu Rong\u00a0was royalty, but behind his back people derided him for surrendering since both his parents died for Sheng Nong in the battle with Xuan Yuan. But in the hundred or so years since, his management of the Middle Plains transformed it from a formerly lawless decrepit region into one filled with bustling activity and thriving with life. His rule was just and fair so the people slowly returned to the region and settled there.Word was Little Zhu Rong\u00a0never tried to hide his Sheng Nong background and would openly ask the Yellow Emperor for things that would benefit the people of the Middle Plains. He never hid his thoughts before the Yellow Emperor of his intention that the people of the Middle Plains who have suffered through a war could return to a life of prosperous peace. Gradually the people of the Middle Plains no longer were suspicious of Little Zhu Rong\u00a0and was instead very respectful. Zhu Rong\u2019s death was an imperial courage to his homeland, Little Zhu Rong\u2019s living was a different type of imperial responsibility to his people.The Chi Sui Autumn Tournament was initially started by Little Zhu Rong\u00a0as a small affair to let the families of the Middle Plains have a fun compet.i.tion, to learn and grow, to meet more people. It was a resounding success and more and more families and clans wanted to partic.i.p.ate until eventually the Autumn Tournament became one of the biggest events in the vast wilderness. This tournament was unique in that it didn\u2019t matter the nationality and was instead a compet.i.tion between families and clans. Each time the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Emperor would send officials bringing great rewards as an enticement for more young people to partic.i.p.ate.This time the Grand Emperor sent Ru So to lead a team to deliver the prize. Zhuan Xu joined the group and Xiao Liu of course tagged along. Ah Nian also wheedled the Grand Emperor allowing her to go as well.Xiao Liu initially thought Zhuan Xu attended the tournament many times before and was surprised to learn this was also his first time. Xiao Liu thought about it and realized why. In the vast wilderness, all the great families and clans always sent their best to partic.i.p.ate, to make connections, to prepare to take over family affairs down the line. Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t go before because he didn\u2019t want to catch the attention of his Xuan Yuan relatives and make them start plotting to take him out. Now he was going because he didn\u2019t care anymore whether he was noticed since he was already preparing to return to Xuan Yuan soon.Gao Xing was a kingdom of water, with many lakes, rivers, and streams flowing through the entire region. Like usual, Ru So chose to take the water route.Zhuan Xu worried that Ah Nian and Xiao Liu would b.u.t.t heads on the same s.h.i.+p but to his surprise the two got along well, and sometimes would be whispering off to the side. Zhuan Xu asked quizzically \u201cHow did you tame Ah Nian?\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cSecret.\u201dAlong the way they encountered many families headed to the tournament, with the more powerful families in boats that could seat over 10, and the smaller families in smaller boats for 3-5 people. Zhuan Xu and Ru So would greet people and then got off their big s.h.i.+p to take a smaller boat following behind. Xiao Liu, Ah Nian, and Hai Tang got off with them.Folks thought they were representing a small family and were very friendly towards them, lots of people would come by to chat whenever they stopped for a rest. Along the way they made many friends.As they got closer to Chi Sui, there were more and more boats in the waterway and Little Zhu Rong\u00a0had many people directing traffic along the sh.o.r.e so everything was orderly.Entering Chi Sui, the waterway widened and both sides were farmland. It was wheat cropping time and as far as the eye could see there was golden wheat stalks glistening under the sun like a sea of gold. Many farmers were hunched over cropping wheat and it was a busy sight to see of a bountiful Autumn harvest.The wind blew the bust of sweet musty wheat that make everyone feel heady. Even Ah Nian smiled \u201cThose people onsh.o.r.e seem really happy.\u201dZhuan Xu looked around and seemed rather sad but he smiled. Xiao Liu asked \u201cWhy are you feeling torn?\u201dZhuan Xu said in a low voice \u201cZhu Rong\u00a0caused my father\u2019s death, and the death of one\u2019s father is a vengeance greater than the Heavens. When Little Zhu Rong\u00a0surrendered, I was still in Xuan Yuan and Grandfather asked me to decide his life or death. I wanted to kill him but in the end I decided not to. Seeing the scenes today, I feel comforted that my decision was correct. But I also feel like I\u2019ve failed my parents\u2026.Ais.h.!.+\u201d Zhuan Xu sighed softly.Xiao Liu said \u201cYou chose the path of greater responsibility to the world. You let go of you personal feelings, and since you made the choice, stop dwelling on it. I think Uncle and Auntie would support your decision.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cI understand.\u201dThe boat continued and the scenery suddenly changed. The Southern sh.o.r.e was still verdant forest but the Northern sh.o.r.e was as barren as a dry desert and it extended so far North it didn\u2019t seem to have an end.Ah Nian wondered \u201cChi Sui is very lush and full of water all four seasons, how could there be a barren desert here?\u201dThis was Zhuan Xu\u2019s first time in Chi Sui as was for Xiao Liu as well. Xiao Liu wandered the vast wilderness for many hundreds of years but never came to Chi Sui because it was close to Yi Province where her mom died in battle. She purposely avoided it so she also never came to Chi Sui before. The two had no answer for her.Their boat master often came to Chi Sui so explained \u201cLegend has it that a hundred or so years ago this area did not have a barren desert. But no one knows when the land one day became a desert. There is a rumor of a giant peach blossom forest in the middle of that desert region, and living in the peach blossom desert is a demon beast that is like a flame that scorched the earth. Because that demon brought a drought, the people call it Han Kui (drought beast).\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cThe G.o.ds didn\u2019t send soldiers to kill it?\u201d\u201cSome brave adventurous young G.o.ds tried to take out the beast but the desert is very strange, it gets hotter as one walks deeper into it. No one has been able to reach the peach blossom forest before almost getting incinerated and quickly retreating. But the demon beast has never harmed anyone so whether there really is a demon in there no one knows for sure. So the people don\u2019t care and gradually this area remains this way.\u201dAh Nian was angry \u201cThat\u2019s horrible! This area was lush and green for thousands of miles and a monster destroyed it. Too bad it\u2019s Xuan Yuan territory, if it\u2019s Gao Xing territory I would tell my dad to send soldiers to eliminate it.\u201dXiao Liu stared at the vast desert \u201cThat monster isn\u2019t bad.\u201dAh Nian didn\u2019t understand but Zhuan Xu explained \u201cThis area is the most water plenty region in the vast wilderness. So for this area to have a desert because the monster is here, imagine the devastation that would be wrought if the monster went elsewhere. Clearly the monster has no intention of harming anyone.\u201dAh Nian felt that Zhuan Xu\u2019s explanation made sense but she still wanted to get rid of the monster. But she was used to listening to her dad and Zhuan Xu\u2019s words since she was small so she said nothing more.The boat traveled until it gradually become a dense fruit orchard ahead filled with all sorts of delicious varieties and the monster matter was quickly forgotten. By dusk the boat slowed and a harbor came into sight. Everyone returned to the big s.h.i.+p and the boat master slowly maneuvered it to sh.o.r.e.An official came to welcome them and knew their group contained the Gao Xing Princess and the Xuan Yuan Prince, but since neither Ah Nian nor Zhuan Xu identified themselves, no one paid them any heed. Everyone was settled into a residence arranged by the official and Ru So went to handle administrative matters and left them alone.Ru So was the son of one of the Grand Emperor\u2019s cousins, and also a was taught by the Grand Emperor and was one of his close subordinates. He asked Zhuan Xu directly what their plans were.Zhuan Xu replied \u201cGet a good night\u2019s rest and tomorrow head out for a stroll. When the tournament starts the day after, we\u2019ll go watch the tournament and you don\u2019t need to worry about us.\u201dRu So said \u201cIt\u2019s the best of the various families and clans who are here to attend the tournament. Some will be naturally very c.o.c.ky so if Prince runs into them, just ignore them and avoid any direct confrontation. We came as spectators and not partic.i.p.ants so there is no need to get into any tussles. If the other side is truly rude, then let me handle it.\u201dZhuan Xu knew that Ru So\u2019s words were intended for Ah Nian and smiled \u201cUnderstood.\u201dAh Nian hated being lectured at but since Ru So was her cousin she just pouted \u201cFine, you handle things and we\u2019ll act clueless, is that okay?\u201dRu So grimaced at Zhuan Xu and left with his servants to attend the welcoming banquet Little Zhu Rong organized for him.The next morning, Xiao Liu and Ah Nian both slept late and woke up after the sun was long overhead. Zhuan Xu was gone and they didn\u2019t know where he went. Xiao Liu and Ah Nian sat in opposite corners of the room and slowly ate their lunch. After eating, Ah Nian yelled over \u201cHey, you know what to do, right?\u201dXiao Liu replied \u201cI know, I promised so don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let your dad marry you to me.\u201dThe two of them leisurely drank some tea and then Zhuan Xu came back. Ah Nian pouted \u201cGege, where did you go?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cJust outside for a stroll to ask around where to take you later.\u201dAh Nian beamed in happiness and Xiao Liu rolled her eyes. Zhuan Xu, that mouth on him was so sweet it was like his honeyed words were free. It was like he would sell you and you would still think he was the best.Zhuan Xu knew Xiao Liu was mocking him so tapped her on the back of her head and said \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dZhuan Xu and Xiao Liu took Ah Nian and Hai Tang out of the residence and it was like everyone in the vast wilderness was here as the entire city was teeming with people. The normally expansive Chi Sui Castle felt small and cramped. The entire Chi Sui Castle contained waterways throughout the interior so most people chose to tour the castle on boat. But Zhuan Xu\u2019s group was tired of being on boats so chose to walk.Zhuan Xu spent the last two hundred years running all through Gao Xing territories but he was unfamiliar with a city within Xuan Yuan territory. He spent his time keenly observing while Ah Nian had been here before but this was her first time out and about without guards so she was also extra excited. All those knick knacks that the commoner ladies used interested her. Zhuan Xu noticed that she liked it so picked out a few silver bracelets for her. Ah Nian gave two to Hai Tang and the two girls happily put them on.Xiao Liu wandered for two hundred years and had seen everything and anything so nothing piqued her interest other than the snacks. She bought some and ate all along the way. She would glance at Zhuan Xu and he would glance back, the two of them saying very little but feeling a peaceful contentment.When Xiao Liu ate something delicious, she would buy more for Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian, but Ah Nian complained that it was dirty so wouldn\u2019t eat, and then neither would Hai Tang. Zhuan Xu would take big bites and enjoy it happily, and when Ah Nian saw them both enjoying their food she wanted to try some but couldn\u2019t bring herself to ask after she turned it down already. She could only stare at them.Perhaps it was due Zhuan Xu and the Grand Emperor, but lately Xiao Liu was rather fond of Ah Nian and knew exactly what was on her mind. She took a piece and neatly peeled off the exterior and handed it to Ah Nian while coaxing her \u201cTry it, the inside isn\u2019t dirty at all.\u201dAh Nian said no until Xiao Liu urged her a few more times and then she accepted reluctantly. The food on the street was always unique unlike anything in the Palace, and girls always loved to enjoy something delicious, so Ah Nian was quickly fond of the street snacks and started happily trying them out along with Hai Tang and Xiao Liu.The four of them ate, played, shopped, and was very happy.In the afternoon, they took an ox carriage out of Chi Sui Castle to the largest s.h.i.+p yard in the Middle Plains that belonged to the Chi Sui clan. Normal s.h.i.+ps could be sold to anyone but there was a special pact between the Yellow Emperor and the Chi Sui clan where the best s.h.i.+ps could only be sold to the Yellow Emperor. The Grand Emperor commissioned a s.h.i.+p from the clan but was turned down.The s.h.i.+p building expertise of the Chi Sui clan was a family secret and no one was allowed inside the s.h.i.+p yard. But admirers still came from far and wide not to steal their secrets but to be able to go home and say they saw the latest Chi Sui s.h.i.+ps that were built.Reportedly with the suggestion of Little Zhu Rong, the Chi Sui clan would hold special s.h.i.+p christening ceremonies from time to time, allowing the clan to show off its prowess as well as indulging the visitors to the s.h.i.+p yard.When Xiao Liu and them arrived, it was almost dusk and there wasn\u2019t a lot of people left by the river banks admiring the sunset. There was suddenly an ocean horn calling signaling a new s.h.i.+p was launching. Xiao Liu and them stopped to watch the sh.o.r.eline.They saw the huge waterway gate to the s.h.i.+p yard open and a large s.h.i.+p slowly enter the river. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t know a good s.h.i.+p from bad but thought this s.h.i.+p was rather unique. It was narrow in the front and wider in the back, resembling a flower about to bloom. Clearly it was designed for a girl in mind.Ah Nian had seen plenty of s.h.i.+ps and scoffed \u201cThe Chi Sui clan s.h.i.+ps are clearly nothing to write home about.\u201dA young girl wearing purple turned her head and walked over glaring at Ah Nian \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that s.h.i.+p?\u201d The girl had pearly white skin and a pair of bright almond shaped eyes that tilted upward in the corners and made her seem flirtatious even when she wasn\u2019t smiling.Ah Nian gave the girl a once over and said \u201cThat s.h.i.+p was clearly built to make a girl happy but it\u2019s design is awkward. What kind of flower is it? It can\u2019t go fast now and it\u2019s exterior isn\u2019t all that striking. Might as well pick one of the two strengths. The Chi Sui clan wanted both when designing this s.h.i.+p and ended up with neither.\u201dThe purple robed girl said coldly \u201cEven if you want one you can\u201dt get one!\u201dAh Nian was so angry she was about to retort when the purple robed girl vaulted onto the s.h.i.+p and turned around to glare at Ah Nian one more time for good measure. Ah Nian realized that the girl was the owner of the new s.h.i.+p so snarked \u201cJust a lousy s.h.i.+p, what\u2019s she\u2019s so proud of?\u201dIt was late and the group discussed where to grab dinner. None of them wanted to go back to the residence so Xiao Liu suggested taking a boat cruise of the lake \u201cThe lake folk are great at cooking fresh water seafood. Let\u2019s rent a clean boat, borrow a net from the boat master, catch some seafood and cook it directly on the boat. Fish, clams, shrimp, there are so many ways to cook it over a grill with the scent bursting and its juices oozing\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Liu was fairly drooling and even Ah Nian was getting into it.Zhuan Xu was feeling very torn, Xiao Liu was describing it so fun and tasty but it came from her experiences living a tough life. He didn\u2019t show any sadness and instead rapped her on the head and laughed \u201cYou useless thing, other than eat you can\u2019t do anything.\u201dXiao Liu knew how to pick a s.h.i.+p and took a glance around at all the boats docked and selected a very nicely tended one and negotiated a price with the boat master. She then sent the boat master off to buy some vegetables, fruits, and alcohol from another boat and brought it over.The four of them got on the boat and everyone watched Xiao Liu busy at work. Hai Tang wanted to help but Xiao Liu shooed her away and borrowed a net and tossed it overboard and pulled back some fish, a couple of shrimps and crabs. Xiao Liu prepped the seafood and pulled out some herbs from inside her robe and seasoned the caught seafood.Ah Nian asked about the clams Xiao Liu promised and Xiao Liu said \u201cWhether we get some depends on you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dXiao Liu pointed to the lake \u201cCan you split the water for me, it doesn\u2019t need to be very wide.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201dAh Nian may be spoiled but her powers weren\u2019t low. She put her hand in the water and the water split open to show the bottom of the lake. Xiao Liu jumped into the water with a basket and walked along the lake floor picking up clams.This was the first time Ah Nian caught her own food so she was super excited and yelled \u201cOver there, I see a big one.\u201dXiao Liu walked in the direction Ah Nian pointed and indeed found a huge clam under a rock.Xiao Liu got back on the boat and put the clams in front of Ah Nian \u201cYou caught this so I\u2019ll cook it for you.\u201dAh Nian asked \u201cWhen can we eat?\u201dZhuan Xu pulled Xiao Liu over next to the fire and took a towel to dry her hair \u201cAre you cold? Drink some wine.\u201dHai Tang brought over some wine and Xiao Liu drank a few sips and instantly warmed up. She waved \u201cStop, stop, I\u2019ll be grilling so I\u2019ll be plenty hot soon!\u201dThe four sat around the grill and started cooking and eating the clams. Ah Nian copied Xiao Liu and started spreading seasoning, and whether it was the fresh clams being delicious or her own cooking, but Ah Nian felt she had never eaten such delicious clams in her entire life.Xiao Liu ate some clams and after her clothes were dry, she took out the three fish she cleaned earlier and wrapped them in lotus leaves before placing them to the side to slowly roast.The four ate and laughed and the night pa.s.sed until the moon was high overhead.There were other boats on the lake and the delicious scent of roasting fish wafted from their boat and many pa.s.serbys on other boats offered to buy it from them. Ah Nian turned them all down \u201cWe have just enough for us to eat.\u201dZhuan Xu said to Xiao Liu \u201cWhatever cooking method you used, even people who are sick and tired of eating this kind of fish like Ah Nian and myself are actually eager to try it.\u201dXiao Liu giggled \u201cSecret recipe, not for divulging.\u201d She was really not boasting, she had long since memorized all the herbs and concoctions in the world and used the taste and smell of it for cooking spices rather than making medicine. She found many unique mixes that guaranteed the food she cooked was one of a kind.A fog rose in the lake and enveloped the s.h.i.+p just as the sound of a zither playing surrounded them. The tune was especially lovely with the fog surrounding them, but the tune appeared to be moving further and further away from them. Xiao Liu sighed \u201cThe tune is being faint.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIf you want to keep on listening to it, it\u2019s not hard for me to make it happen.\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cAre you going to yell at her to come back? Even I wouldn\u2019t dare do that.\u201dAh Nian nudged Hai Tang and she quickly took out a flute from their belongings and handed it to Zhuan Xu. Ah Nian said to Xiao Liu \u201cMy dad is a master at music and he taught Gege everything about it. Gege might not be the equal of the incomparable Young Master of Qing Qiu Tu Shan Jing, but otherwise he\u2019s impressive.\u201dZhuan Xu brought the flute to his lips and started whistling the tune. It was the same as the one played by the zither, but with changes so that it become a companion piece that was full of playful casualness. Even a music novice like Xiao Liu could tell it was amazing and the zither player definitely thought so as well because the zither tune started getting louder and blending in harmony with the flute. The two were playing and testing each other, the sounds of the flute and zither dancing in the fog, soaring high and then dipping low. Gradually the zither tune appeared to be subdued by the flute tune and followed along in perfect synchronicity.Ah Nian got more and more annoyed and suddenly grabbed the flute. The tune stopped abruptly but Zhuan Xu wasn\u2019t angry and gently asked \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe zither lost the flute and appeared to be seeking its counterpart and sounded lonely in the fog.Ah Nian felt her heart was uneasy and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to listen anymore.\u201d Xiao Liu lowered her head and m.u.f.fled her grin, going back to eating her crab.The zither played for a bit longer and after hearing no response from the flute, appeared to get angry and suddenly stopped as well.Zhuan Xu grabbed a crab and peeled it for Ah Nian and placed it before her. She smiled and happily ate it. He did the same for Xiao Liu who had a mouthful of crab and mumbled \u201cCrab has to be eaten by oneself to be tasty.\u201dXiao Liu handed a fish to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou try this.\u201d He opened the lotus leaf and a thick fragrance reached his nostril and even Ah Nian and Hai Tang rushed to grab their fish. Xiao Liu told them to go ahead and eat and threw some drunken shrimp on the grill. The smell of the lotus fish and the grilling drunken shrimp was indescribably fragrant and from a distance a loud voice boomed \u201cHey! That boat over there. Bring some of the food over. If my lady likes it, there will be a great reward.\u201dAh Nian huffed \u201cA little bit of money and this horrible att.i.tude? No!\u201dHai Tang immediately loudly called back \u201cMy lady said \u201cWho cares about a little bit of money? The answer is no!\u201dThe s.h.i.+p steered over and it was the new s.h.i.+p from this afternoon. The maid stood on the s.h.i.+p and realized the mistake when she saw them. But her apology was disingenuous \u201cThere was a lot of fog so we couldn\u2019t see clearly and thought this was a food boat. Sorry for the impolite tone, but if you can sell the fish to us, you can name your price.\u201dAh Nian remembered the girl from earlier and was even more p.i.s.sed. She shot Hai Tang a look indicating she wasn\u2019t talking to a maid so Hai Tang stood up and bowed \u201cMoney, we don\u2019t need any. If you want to exchange with something, we might be willing. But not sure if you have it.\u201dThe maid checked out Hai Tang and haughtily said \u201cThere is very little we don\u2019t have. Say it!\u201dHai Tang smiled sweetly \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything too precious. There is reportedly a mulberry wood from Yang Valley that can burn without fire. If you can give us a stack then we can use it to cook the rest of our drunken shrimp.\u201dXiao Liu covered her mouth to m.u.f.fle her laughter. The Yang Valley mulberry wood was so rare it was measured in finger tip lengths and this was the first time it was ever mentioned in the context of a stack. It was likely only Ah Nian who dared say something so absurd.The maid realized she had been mocked and huffed \u201cYou dare mock me?\u201dHai Tang laughed \u201cYou said for us to tell, how could I have mocked you. Just be careful when you talk to people, in case you can\u2019t make it happen!\u201dThe maid was enraged and fired some water strikes towards Hai Tang who didn\u2019t hesitate and flung it right back. The maid was drenched and in tears \u201cIf you have guts then don\u2019t run!\u201d before running into the interior of the s.h.i.+p.Moments later the purple robed girl and a red robed girl came running out. The red robbed girl wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar face \u2013 it was Fang Feng Yi Yang.Xiao Liu quickly darted into the interior of the boat and hid in the shadows. Zhuan Xu sat down next to her and used his body to s.h.i.+eld her and asked without turning around \u201cYou know her?\u201dXiao Liu said in a low voice \u201cThe red-robed girl is Fang Feng Yi Yang.\u201d Wen Xiao Liu\u2019s face was recognizable in Qing Shui Town but nowhere else, but people in the town rarely left unless they had to so Xiao Liu wasn\u2019t worried people would recognize her. That\u2019s why she was so surprised to see Fang Feng Yi Yang here.The purple robed girl sternly chastised \u201cYou guys are so rude! The maid came to buy some food, if you don\u2019t want to then say no, there was no need for insults.\u201dAh Nian stood up \u201cWho are you to point out insults? Who was the rude one first? Who started it first?\u201dThe purple robed girl recognized Ah Nian and huffed \u201cThe maid reflects her master, I should known who was rude first.\u201dAh Nian raged \u201cYour s.h.i.+p is a piece of c.r.a.p so why can\u2019t people say it? Who do you think you are? I\u2019m going to keep saying it \u2013 a c.r.a.ppy s.h.i.+p!\u201dThe purple robed girl wanted to fight but appeared to hesitate and hold down her anger but it was threatening to burst forth.Fang Feng Yi Yang gently said \u201cLittle sister, this is all my fault since I smelled the fragrant food and wanted to eat it. If it wasn\u2019t for me, then there would be no need for you to be insulted by such little people. Since I started this, let me handle it. That way your dad and brother won\u2019t get mad at you afterwards.\u201dFang Feng Yi Yang turned towards Ah Nian and Hai Tang and her face was chilly \u201cYou apologize immediately otherwise don\u2019t blame me for what I\u2019m going to do!\u201dAh Nian was once kidnapped by the most notorious demon in the vast wilderness that was Xiang Liu along with Xiao Liu\u2019s help and she never once backed down. How could she be scared now? She coldly laughed back \u201cFine, let me see what you\u2019re going to do.\u201dThe boat master knew something big was going down and hurriedly jumped into the water.Fang Feng Yi Yang waved her hand and pulled out a bow and arrow from her sleeve. The arrows went flying and it was all towards Zhuan Xu, and it wasn\u2019t clear if it was the fog causing it or she shot wild.Zhuan Xu knew she was Fang Feng Yi Yang so he used his powers to create a protective s.h.i.+eld around Ah Nian and Hai Tang. They were fine but he was worried about Xiao Liu. Most of the arrows landed on the boat and it was so powerful it caused the entire boat to quake and then collapse in the water. The four of them fell in the water as the boat sank.Xiao Liu was happy since everyone who grew up in Gao Xing knew how to swim. That was why she was shocked to see that neither Zhuan Xu nor Ah Nian knew how to swim. Hai Tang currently was under direct attack from the maid so she had her hands full and couldn\u2019t rescue Ah Nian. Xiao Liu swam towards Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian to save them. Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t know how to swim but he used his powers to transform his legs into wood so he was floating in the water safely. Ah Nian swallowed some water and was about to sink. Zhuan Xu said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, save Ah Nian.\u201dXiao Liu swam towards Ah Nian and said back \u201cYou be careful.\u201dAh Nian grabbed onto Xiao Liu like an octopus when she reached her, not even caring about male-female etiquette. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t have much powers so Ah Nian was dragging her down with her struggling. Xiao Liu hit Ah Nian hard on the back of her neck and she pa.s.sed out. She quickly swam to sh.o.r.e with her.Xiao Liu woke Ah Nian up and said \u201cI need to go back for Zhuan Xu, can you keep yourself safe?\u201dThe fog was dense and thick like it could conceal monsters all around. Ah Nian was s.h.i.+vering but she nodded her head bravely. Xiao Liu patted her on the cheek \u201cHide well and no matter what happens don\u2019t come out.\u201dXiao Liu jumped back into the lake in search of Zhuan Xu. She swam back to where they entered the water but there was nothing there anymore. She searched around everywhere for Zhuan Xu but found nothing other than Hai Tang floating in the lake with an arrow in her leg. Finally she couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore to hide and called out \u201cGege, Gege\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Liu pulled Hai Tang and swam back to sh.o.r.e will calling out for Zhuan Xu but no one answered.Ah Nian was curled up hiding in the water reeds, the dense fog making her blind and even the sound of birds made her frightened out of wits. She heard the sound of water lapping and stared nervously ahead. A black shape emerged and walked towards her and she was so scared until she saw it was Xiao Liu carrying Ah Nian. She rushed out \u201cXiao Liu.\u201dXiao Liu saw the tears in Ah Nian\u2019s eyes and remembered her first time outdoors at night by herself and the fear she felt. She patted Ah Nian on the shoulder and complimented \u201cYou were very brave!\u201dAh Nian was embarra.s.sed and put on a whatever expression \u201cWhere\u2019s Gege? And what happened to Hai Tang?\u201dXiao Liu put Hai Tang down \u201cShe was struck in the back and got an arrow in the leg. But I\u2019m here so no worries.\u201dXiao Liu fed Hai Tang a pill and leaned down to rip her pant leg but Ah Nian\u2019s face reddened \u201cCan\u2019t we treat her after we get back?\u201d\u201cThis huge fog, do you know the way back? This arrow didn\u2019t hit a major artery but I don\u2019t want to underestimate that Miss Fang Feng. If I don\u2019t treat it soon Hai Tang might end up crippled.\u201d\u201cBut, but, you\u2019re a man!\u201dXiao Liu ripped Hai Tang\u2019s pants \u201cSo the worst is that I\u2019ll marry her!\u201dAh Nian thought about it and decided that made sense but it didn\u2019t feel right \u201cHumph, that\u2019s lucky for you!\u201dXiao Liu pulled out the arrow and said to Ah Nian \u201cTake out your best medicines.\u201dAh Nian handed her a bottle with Yang Valley water soaked in mulberry flowers, and when Xiao Liu poured it on the wound it ate away at the blackened charred flesh and revealed healthy healing flesh. Ah Nian handed another bottle over containing pills that stopped the bleeding which then allowed her to bandage the wound.Ah Nian asked worriedly \u201cWhat happened to Gege?\u201dXiao Liu shook her head \u201cI don\u2019t know, but we have to go back to the residence and ask Ru So to search.\u201dXiao Liu piggybacked Hai Tang and said \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ah Nian followed behind Xiao Liu stumbling along the way because of the dense fog and the marshy riverbank. Ah Nian initially struggled because she couldn\u2019t see and her footsteps were uneven, but ahead of her Xiao Liu was carrying Ah Nian and was walking steadily without any trepidation. Ah Nian felt bad and gritted her teeth to catch up and didn\u2019t even make a sound even when she felt snakes slithering beside her.Xiao Liu arrived at a sloped area and called out \u201cBoat master, double the price, take us to Chi Sui Castle.\u201d A voice responded \u201cSure\u201d and then a lamp was lit. Xiao Liu and Ah Nian got on the boat with Hai Tang, and once they were onboard Ah Nian incredulously asked Xiao Liu \u201cHow did you know there was a boat here?\u201dXiao Liu set Hai Tang down \u201cYesterday when we traveled down the river I saw houseboats docked here and people cooking meals.\u201d Ah Nian was in disbelief \u201cOnce glance and you remembered? It\u2019s not like you were expecting us to encounter danger.\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cWhen one lives in constant danger, not remembering can mean death, remembering more is a chance to survive. It\u2019s become a habit even if I don\u2019t intentionally try to remember.\u201dAh Nian stared at Xiao Liu and said nothing else. The boat floated down river during the thick fog as Xiao Liu suggested to the boat master, and when the fog lifted the boat sped up and soon they were back in the castle where the boat master stopped in front of their residence.The servant opened the door and saw the completely mucked up group and immediately went to summon Ru So. He heard Hai Tang was hurt and rushed out, only letting out a sigh of relief when he saw Ah Nian was unharmed. He said to Ah Nian \u201cAs long as you\u2019re around, I just knew something was going to happen. It\u2019s not if but whether it\u2019s a big thing or a little thing.\u201dHai Tang was taken inside to be seen by the doctor while Ah Nian immediately reported \u201cZhuan Xu gege is missing.\u201dRu So\u2019s just relaxed brows furrowed together immediately and he said \u201cTell me everything that happened in detail from the beginning.\u201dAh Nian explained everything and only when she got to the end did Xiao Liu speak up to add \u201cThe woman who started the attack was Fang Feng Yi Yang.\u201dRu So was shocked \u201cIt was her!\u201dAh Nian asked \u201cWho is she? Is she famous? I\u2019ve never heard of her?\u201dRu So explained \u201cShe\u2019s the fiancee of the Young Master of Qing Qiu Tu Shan Jing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s who she is!\u201d Ah Nian slapped the table and stood up \u201cI\u2019ll go ask the Tu Shan clan whether they are looking for all their businesses to be shuttered within Gao Xing.\u201dRu So cautioned \u201cEven though she started it, but she was standing up for the other girl. The matter is really between you guys and the other girl, plus you guys didn\u2019t reveal your ident.i.ties, so it\u2019s hard to blame her for hurting you guys.\u201dXiao Liu seconded that \u201cNow is not the time to stir up more trouble, we need to find out where Zhuan Xu went.\u201dRu So told them \u201cSince we know she is Miss Fang Feng, we can find her quickly and then find where the Prince went. I\u2019ll handle it so you two go take a hot bath and get some rest.\u201dAh Nian returned to her room but Xiao Liu took the long way and then returned to Ru So. He didn\u2019t know Xiao Liu\u2019s real ident.i.ty but the Grand Emperor personally asked him to take good care of Xiao Liu so he asked \u201cDoes young master need me for anything else?\u201dXiao Liu tried to be careful in her warning \u201cBe careful of Miss Fang Feng, I didn\u2019t get the impression that she was doing this for her friend. I suspect she recognized Ah Nian and Zhuan Xu.\u201dRu So \u201cI will be on alert and if I hear anything I will immediately let you know.\u201dXiao Liu bowed \u201cThank you.\u201dXiao Liu took a bath but couldn\u2019t sleep afterwards. Zhuan Xu, Fang Feng Yi Yang, Tu Shan Jing, Xiang Liu\u2026..Everyone swirled in her mind like a horse parade until Xiao Liu felt like her head hurt so much it was splitting.Xiao Liu felt this was pointless, best get a good rest so that after Ru So brought news she could go help him. She took a pill and used it to drowsily fall asleep.When she woke up it was noon and she headed down to eat lunch. She found Ah Nian in a daze by the window, black circles under her eyes, clearly haven\u2019t slept a wink. Xiao Liu sat down and started wolfing down her food. Ah Nian angrily berated \u201cMy Gege treats you so well. There is no news of him and you can still eat?\u201dXiao Liu replied \u201cIf I don\u2019t eat or sleep, will he come back?\u201dAh Nian spit out \u201cCold blooded!\u201dXiao Liu knew she was worried so ignored her and ate her food. After some time, Ah Nian looked out the window and asked \u201cAm I really a troublemaker? If it wasn\u2019t for me, there would have been no altercation last night?\u201dXiao Liu replied \u201cTrouble is the exclusive right for a beautiful woman to have. If women didn\u2019t cause trouble, how else would it show a man\u2019s greatness. Plus last night there would have been a fight with or without you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have sold the fish to that snotty maid either.\u201dAh Nian thought about it while Xiao Liu asked \u201cYou\u2019re from Gao Xing, how can you not know how to swim?\u201dAh Nian awkwardly answered \u201cMy mom is very fearful and she had a hard birth to have me. She\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll drown so when I was small she wouldn\u2019t let me swim. Later on it\u2019s harder for a girl to go swimming. Plus I don\u2019t like it so I never learned.\u201dRu So walked in and Ah Nian stood up \u201cDid you find Gege?\u201dRu So bowed \u201cPrince Zhuan Xu is fine. You both need not worry.\u201d\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cIn the Chi Sui clan residence.\u201dAh Nian was confused \u201cHow did he end up there?\u201dRu So explained \u201cThe young lady who got into an altercation with you last night was Sheng Nong Xing Yue, the daughter of Little Zhu Rong. She is the granddaughter of the current head of the Chi Sui clan, and the younger sister of the future head of the clan.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s face was furious and she smashed all the plates on the table to the ground.Ru So and Xiao Liu remained calm and Xiao Liu said quietly \u201cIt sounds so complicated. This Miss Sheng Nong Xing Yue is the direct descendant of the Sheng Nong royal family bloodline, then how come her older brother is the next Chi Sui clan leader?\u201dRu So quietly explained \u201cLittle Zhu Rong\u00a0married the only daughter of the current Chi Sui clan leader. Her name is Chi Sui Xiao Ye. The Chi Sui clan leader is not just Little Zhu Rong\u2019s father-in-law, he\u2019s also his uncle. Little Zhu Rong\u00a0sees him as a second father and he agreed that if later on he had two kids, a son would be given to the Chi Sui clan and take their name. His wife had a pair of male-female fraternal twins so the older brother was born the future leader of the Chi Sui clan and grew up beside his grandfather the current clan leader. The s.h.i.+p you saw yesterday was designed by Miss Sheng Nong Xing Yue and her brother built it for her.Xiao Liu softly asked \u201cIf that Miss Sheng Nong has such a huge background, and we insulted her, how come Prince Zhuan Xu is staying at the Chi Sui residence.\u201dRu So replied \u201cI don\u2019t know either, all I know is that the Prince is very safe.\u201dAh Nian slammed the table \u201cDid you see him? How do we know he\u2019s safe if they say it!\u201dRu So quickly clarified \u201cOf course I was wary so asked to see him and they gladly brought me inside to see the Prince. He suffered an arrow to the shoulder and was in the water for some time so he looked rather wan. Otherwise he was fine. The Prince told me not to worry and sent be back. He\u2019ll return when he\u2019s injury has healed a bit.\u201dAh Nian huffed \u201cThey must know Gege\u2019s ident.i.ty so they are afraid of upsetting my Daddy and the Yellow Emperor so they are being overly solicitous.\u201dRu So was about to say something but hesitated so Ah Nian yelled \u201cJust say it!\u201dRu So said \u201cI don\u2019t think they know the Prince\u2019s real ident.i.ty. The Prince said he was a distant relative of the Grand Emperor so they think he\u2019s one of the scions of the Gao Xing four tribes.\u201dAh Nian angrily slammed the table again but didn\u2019t have anything else to say so she stood up and stormed out of the room.Xiao Liu asked \u201cDid you see Miss Fang Feng?\u201d\u201cI saw her and it was from her that I learned the young lady was the daughter of Little Zhu Yen. She was very courteous and kept apologizing, explaining she didn\u2019t know we were sent by the Grand Emperor. But she was so courteous that it leads one to think\u2026..\u201d Ru So shook his head \u201cJust remind the Prince to be more careful from now on. It\u2019s hard to dodge secret arrows and Miss Fang Feng is one of the best archers in the entire vast wilderness.\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cBased on what happened, Miss Fang Feng was clearly trying to kill Prince Zhuan Xu, but something happened suddenly and Miss Sheng Nong stopped her and saved the Prince.\u201d Xiao Liu didn\u2019t think it was because Miss Sheng Nong was a kind person. The powerful and rich held the lives of their retainers and commoners in their hands from birth, life and death wasn\u2019t a big deal to them.Ru So coughed and said \u201cActually I already sent someone to dig for details.\u201dXiao Liu wasn\u2019t surprised. A great clan like Chi Sui, the Grand Emperor was of course keeping an eye on them and clearly had someone there inside at all times.Ru So looked at Xiao Liu and marveled at how he didn\u2019t ask any probing questions and understood immediately \u201cA maid on the s.h.i.+p said that the Prince took an arrow and was sinking. Miss Sheng Nong was turning the s.h.i.+p around to leave when a flute rose to the surface. She paused and then dove into the water to rescue the Prince.\u201dXiao Liu thought about it and then explained the zither and flute melody from last night. \u201cI\u2019m thinking this Miss Sheng Nong is very adept at the zither.\u201d If she was the one harmonizing with Zhuan Xu on the flute, then it would explain why she would save him after she saw the flute.Xiao Liu smiled and was about to leave the room when she stopped and casually asked \u201cDid the Tu Shan clan send only Miss Fang Feng?\u201d\u201cYoung master Jing is also here.\u201dXiao Liu said a casual Oh and then left.Xiao Liu slept deeply in the afternoon compared to the morning time when she needed a pill to help her fall asleep. She woke up at dinner time but wasn\u2019t really hungry since she slept all day. She brought a plate of fruit and ate it in the corridor. Ah Nian came by and did the same thing since she wasn\u2019t hungry either. The two of them sat a distance away but Xiao Liu could see the dark circles under her eyes that indicated she didn\u2019t rest well in the afternoon either. She said \u201cHave the maid make you some hot soup and warm milk, then sleep well tonight.\u201dAh Nian just ate and said nothing.Ru So came in after watching an afternoon worth of tournament matches and asked what they wanted to watch tomorrow and he would arrange it. Ah Nian thought \u201cOkay! I want to watch Gao Xing\u2019s four tribes versus the Chi Sui clan.\u201dRu So smiled wanly \u201cYes, that can be arranged.\u201dSince Xiao Liu had her powers stripped, she was uninterested in battles and fighting so she was happy not to have to accompany Zhuan Xu to watch the matches and quickly declined to go tomorrow.The next day, Xiao Liu slept til noon and found the entire residence empty as everyone went to watch the tournament. She didn\u2019t feel like stoking the kitchen fires so ran off to eat street food.She ate two bowls of clam leek soup and afterwards sat under the riverbank wall under the sun watching the activity on the river. A boat pa.s.sed with a green robed man sitting with his back to Xiao Liu and he was enjoyed the view beside a blue robed man. The familiar figure was instantly recognizable as Jing, and since he couldn\u2019t see Xiao Liu, then Xiao Liu stared at him directly.Jing suddenly turned his head and looked at the sh.o.r.e. Xiao Liu didn\u2019t move and just looked at him, not sure if he saw her. The boat moved past and the green disappeared into the distance.He knew she was here, she knew he was here. But it was no longer like when they were in Qing Shui Town, when she would wave and call s.h.i.+ Qi and he would show up beside her.Xiao Liu didn\u2019t know how long she sat there until a person walked by and sat down beside her. The faint herbal scent wafted over but Xiao Liu didn\u2019t turn her head because she knew that even if he saw her face, it was not her real face. She smiled at the pa.s.sing boats and her heart fluttered with a small happiness.After some moments, Xiao Liu asked \u201cNot afraid of being followed?\u201d\u201cMy ancestor is the fox. There is only my following, few can track me.\u201dXiao Liu remembered being captured by Xiang Liu the first time and how he found her. The second time when Zhuan Xu tossed her in prison, he again found her. He really was very adept at tracking.Xiao Liu asked \u201cHave you gone to watch the tournament?\u201d\u201cThe Tu Shan clan doesn\u2019t fight, we come here to discuss business and find talent.\u201dXiao Liu said nothing more and s.h.i.+ Qi silently kept Xiao Liu company under the sun. Xiao Liu never turned around but his herbal scent was very calming. Until the sun was setting over the river, s.h.i.+ Qi softly said \u201cI need to leave. When are you going back?\u201d\u201cI need to go back too.\u201d\u201cThen you go first.\u201dXiao Liu felt a sliver of warmth in her heart and stood up to leave. She walked slowly down the river edge towards the residence, knowing someone was sending her off with his eyes. It made this walk feel less lonely with someone keeping her company.But the person sending her off gave her the warmth while he kept the loneliness of watching her gradually disappear from sight.Xiao Liu rested for five days until the final day of the tournament and she was dragged by Ah Nian and Ru So to go watch the final match.The final match was between a man and a woman. The man was named Yu Jiang from one of the Gao Xing four tribes. The woman was named Xian and came from the most powerful of the Four Great Clans the Chi Sui clan. Yu Jiang had a baby face and always looked like he was smiling whereas Xian was cold and aloof with the aura of fury. Both were adept water type powers but Yu Jiang trained in water while Xian was in ice.Everyone was antic.i.p.ating this water and ice battle and most rooted for Yu Jiang since he seemed so friendly, but thought Xian appeared more ruthless so likely would win.Xiao Liu didn\u2019t want to run into Fang Feng Yi Yang but also didn\u2019t want to change her face. Luckily Ah Nian wore a hat cover so Xiao Liu did as well.Xiao Liu saw Zhuan Xu and a girl wearing a hat cover walking in. Xiao Liu\u2019s head hurt and she acted like she didn\u2019t see them. Ah Nian stood up and waved her hands while calling \u201cGege!\u201dZhuan Xu and the girl walked over and Ah Nian finally realized who she could be and was completely tense now \u201cGege, who is she?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and introduced them \u201cThis is my little sister Ah Nian. Xing Yue, you can call her Ah Nian as well. This is Sheng Nong Xing Yue. Ah Nian, call her Xing Ye. And this is\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu looked around for Xiao Liu who was nowhere in sight.Xiao Liu sneaked out along with Ru So and then went to squeeze in with the spectators in the Gao Xing tribal group section. Ru So laughed \u201cChi Sui Xian will obviously be freezing everything soon, it\u2019ll be cold then so this is perfect to stay warm.\u201dXiao Liu had been pretending to be a man for two hundred years so was fine with it, squeezing in and finally feeling the mood of watching a tournament match.The match began and it was intense, ice versus water, and just like Ru So said Xian froze all the water and it was like there was snow falling just on the match ring. Xiao Liu\u2019s powers were low and the entire arena was like the middle of the Winter so she started s.h.i.+vering. Ru So saw it and put his hand on hers and pa.s.sed her some power to warm her up. He also lowered his head to explain what was happening on the match ring between two opponents.Xiao Liu suddenly felt like someone was staring at her and she looked towards the VIP section where there was a curtain covering one area. She asked Ru So \u201cWho is sitting over there?\u201d Ru So looked \u201cThe Tu Shan clan.\u201dXiao Liu was silent and then started laughing and muttering \u201cYou made me promise not to date a guy for fifteen years, you didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t talk to guys.\u201dRu So asked \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dXiao Liu laughed \u201cNothing, keep on explaining.\u201dRu So and Xiao Liu continued to keep their heads close and talk to each other throughout the match.Yu Jiang and Xian were battling not just on power but also on strategy. In the end these two powerful opponents showcased a thrilling match for the spectators, with Xian losing because all her powers were depleted and she collapsed in a faint. Yu Jiang fared no better and had to be carried to remain standing. He was declared the victor and all the Gao Xing tribes erupted in cheers.The two of them headed out among the departing crowds, with Ru So keeping a hand on Xiao Liu\u2019s shoulder to protect her and avoid being separated by the crowds. A lot of people in the VIP section knew Ru So and teased him that the Gao Xing grand prizes would be going home with him this year. Ru So laughed and accepted the ribbing.The Four Great Clans were leaving and everyone parted for them respectfully.The Autumn Tournament is where families got to win glory and the Four Great Clans represented the everlasting continuation of bloodlines that could never be changed. Kingdoms and Emperors can change, but families remained forever as long as each generation begat the next generation.The Chi Sui clan, the Xi Ling clan, the Tu Shan clan, and the Gui Fang clan all walked past. Jing and Fang Feng Yi Yang walked side by side and when they pa.s.sed Ru So, Fang Feng Yi Yang purposely slowed her steps and smiled at him. Jing glanced at Ru So, his eyes lingering on his hand on Xiao Liu\u2019s shoulder. He said nothing and merely nodded at Ru So.Xiao Liu pulled Ru So into the crowd and made a quick exit. Outside they ran into Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian, with Zhuan Xu glaring at Xiao Liu before asking Ru So \u201cYou two disappeared quickly, where did you go?\u201dRu So just smiled and said nothing. Xiao Liu noticed Ah Nian was all smiles and in a great mood. Ah Nian whispered \u201cWhy did you run off? You should have seen the thunderous look on that Sheng Nong Xing Yue\u2019s face when Chi Sui Xian lost. It was supremely satisfying to watch.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cDid you fight with her?\u201d\u201cNo, she\u2019s Gege\u2019s guest and I don\u2019t want him in a bind. Plus she doesn\u2019t know who I am so I was secretly happy.\u201dXiao Liu remembered Ah Nian in Qing Shui Town, despite how much she hated Xiao Liu, when Zhuan Xu told her not to cause trouble she didn\u2019t. No matter how anyone in Gao Xing looked down on Zhuan Xu, Ah Nian never did. Xiao Liu was thinking in a daze when Ah Nian rapped Xiao Liu on the forehead mimicking Zhuan Xu \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cOf you!\u201d\u201cI warned you, you\u2019re not allowed to like me!\u201d Ah Nian\u2019s face changed and then she remembered that she forgot all about having Xiao Liu make a fool of himself so her daddy wouldn\u2019t marry her to him.Xiao Liu said solemnly \u201cI promised so don\u2019t worry, your daddy won\u2019t marry you to me.\u201dAh Nian realized in the last few days that Xiao Liu was someone who said something and followed through so she relaxed.Back at the residence, Xiao Liu went looking for Zhuan Xu. \u201cHow\u2019s your injury?\u2019Zhuan Xu patted his shoulder \u201cIt\u2019s all better but I can\u2019t move it freely yet.\u201dXiao Liu grabbed his arm and checked it out \u201cThe Chi Sui doctors are good, keep on resting up.\u201dXiao Liu turned to leave but Zhuan Xu grabbed her arm \u201cScaring you like that, are you mad at me?\u201dXiao Liu sat down \u201cYou know I won\u2019t.\u201d She used her finger to poke his shoulder \u201cIf one\u2019s life wasn\u2019t in danger, who would want to risk injury to put on a show.\u201dZhuan Xu explained \u201cLast time in Qing Shui Town, I investigated Fang Feng Yi Yang and learned she had two maids which were also on the s.h.i.+p that night. If I really fought back, then she would allow us to kill one of her maids and thus escalate it for Sheng Nong Xing Yue. Things would get dicey so I decided to play useless since I could tell she only wanted to kill me and didn\u2019t want to harm Ah Nian. When I saw you had taken Ah Nian to safety, I pretended to sink to the bottom thinking Fang Feng Yi Yang couldn\u2019t openly continue to kill me and finish the job and she would have to leave. The only thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was Sheng Nong Xing Yue diving in to save me.\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cYou need to thank me. If I didn\u2019t want to listen to her zither, you wouldn\u2019t have played the flute which led her to like you.\u201dZhuan Xu huffed \u201cThank you? If I didn\u2019t play the flute then I wouldn\u2019t have lured them back, then we wouldn\u2019t have run into them and this whole altercation wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dXiao Liu retorted \u201cIf we didn\u2019t run into them, how would you have made the connection with the Chi Sui clan. This is bad luck begetting good tidings.\u201dZhuan Xu gave up \u201cFine fine, I thank you.\u201dXiao Liu suddenly sighed \u201cI feel like fate is so magical. So many coincidences yet it\u2019s all headed towards an inevitable. The Chi Sui clan and the Sheng Nong family are two families you have to get on your side. I just never thought it would come by this way.\u201d\u201cYou! You claim to have seen it all, yet you\u2019re still a girl who dreams!\u201d Zhuan Xu rapped her on the head \u201cThere is no real coincidence, there is only a must happen. The Sheng Nong tribe and Chi Sui clans, whether they stand with me is not based on coincidence, it\u2019s based on what I can give them. These coincidences are merely the thin veil wrapped around something that must and will happen.\u201d\u201cAy! Gege you are too rational, and too cold hearted\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Liu pouted and then laughed at herself \u201cI guess it\u2019s good that I still dream.\u201dZhuan Xu tenderly stroked her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ru So got dressed bright and early and left with his servants. Xiao Liu lazed in bed but was dragged up by Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian to go and check out the festivities.Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Liu \u201cThe last day is actually the most fun at the Autumn Tournament. Before people are nervous before the matches but now the tournament is over and tomorrow everyone is headed home so this is the best time to drink and carouse.\u201dArriving at the edge of Chi Sui river, Xiao Liu confirmed Zhuan Xu was right. The river\u2019s edge was blanketed by a lush growth of green gra.s.s and the entire length was set up as a banquet. A lamb was roasting, jugs of wine were being drank, people were already drunk and it wasn\u2019t even afternoon yet. Some were diving into the river, others singing, folks were wresting, gambling was off to the side, and a crowd of people were circled together dancing to song.The step dance was a celebration of the harvest, for farmers to gather and sing praise to the bounty accompanied by clapping and rhythmic stepping. Xiao Liu and Zhuan Xu walked over with Ah Nian in tow and was surprised to see Sheng Nong Xing Yue leading the girls dancing in the center. She had her hair in two braids wearing a narrow sleeved robe and was dancing hand in hand with other girls.When Xing Yue saw Zhuan Xu, her eyes twinkled and she flashed him a challenging stare. Someone pushed Zhuan Xu into the dancing group of men, and unlike other n.o.ble scions he spent years living with commoners so he knew how to step dance. Zhuan Xu smiled and naturally danced and sang to the music, his voice and form strong and elegant.Whether it was being pushed by others or the two of them were interested in each other, Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue gradually started dancing across from each other and became the center of the circle.Xiao Liu was getting into watching it when Ah Nian stormed off and she rushed after her. Ah Nian rushed to the river\u2019s edge \u201cShameless! She\u2019s so shameless!\u201dXiao Liu said \u201cSheng Nong tribe may be royalty in the Middle Plains, but now they are all part of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom. The Xuan Yuan tradition is to be pa.s.sionate and wild, and Xing Yue grew up in Xuan Yuan Castle for many years where men and women step dancing together is very common.\u201dAh Nian turned around abruptly and was about to say something when Zhuan Xu ran over. Ah Nian\u2019s anger faded a bit \u201cGege seemed to be having a lot of fun. Why stop now?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled easily \u201cNo matter how fun, nothing is more important than my little sister\u2019s safety.\u201dAh Nian smiled while Zhuan Xu admonished Xiao Liu \u201cThere are a lot of people here, don\u2019t run off.\u201dXiao Liu nodded \u2013 she and Ah Nian were definitely the least safe combo. Ah Nian was a trouble magnet and Xiao Liu had zero faith she could protect both of them.They three went to buy roasted venison and was in the middle of eating when Xing Yue brought a young man over. He looked a lot like her, but the similar features were different enough to lend a very different impression. Xing Yue was spirited and saucy, the young man was reserved and mature. Zhuan Xu smiled and said to Xiao Liu and Ah Nian \u201cThis is Chi Sui Feng Long, Xing Yue\u2019s twin older brother.\u201dAh Nian realized his powerful background so smiled and curtsied politely. Chi Sui Feng Long noticed her perfect manners and knew she didn\u2019t grow up in an ordinary family so was equally polite back.Xiao Liu had a mouth stuffed full of venison and was grabbing more with her oily hands so waved casually, leaving both Ah Nian and Xing Yue to glare at her. One blamed her for not giving Zhuan Xu gege face, the other for not being polite to her Feng Long gege.Feng Long said to Zhuan Xu \u201cDo you guys know Tu Shan Jing?\u201dZhuan Xu breezily said \u201cOf course we\u2019ve heard the famous name of the Young Master of Qing Qiu.\u201dFeng Long explained \u201cMy grandfather sent me to study with Jing at Qing Qiu so we learned together and are good friends. Jing can be considered both my master and my bosom buddy.\u201dXiao Liu now connected that the man she saw on the boat with Jing a few days ago must\u2019ve been Feng Long.Xing Yue added \u201cYi Yang is also my good friend. Before she got engaged, I traveled with her even. Jing gege and Yi Yang jiejie are good friends to both my Gege and me. So much has happened these past years so it\u2019s really precious that they have reunited. We want to throw a party to celebrate for them.\u201dFeng Long explained \u201cNot just to celebrate only, I also wanted to express how happy I am to see Jing again.\u201d Xing Yue explained \u201cTonight our dad Little Zhu Rong is throwing a huge farewell banquet while we two are having a party for Jing and Yi Yang on our s.h.i.+p.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cWe are inviting our close friends only and Yi Yang suggested extending the invitation to you guys. We would be very happy if you can join us, and our friends would like meeting you all.\u201dXiao Liu looked at Feng Long and could see the invitation was clearly Feng Long indicating he wanted to bring Zhuan Xu into the group. Looks like Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t waste his recuperating stay at the Chi Sui residence.Zhuan Xu understood as well \u201cThank you and we would be delighted.\u201d Feng Long and Xing Yue took their leave to prepare for the party. Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian bid them farewell, and Feng Long glanced back at Ah Nian again before leaving with his sister.Ah Nian sat down and glared at Xiao Liu \u201cLook at you! It\u2019s like you\u2019ve never eaten venison before in your life.\u201dXiao Liu said to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou guys go, I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201dZhuan Xu cut a piece of meat and said very casually \u201cI would rather that you go and see for yourself.\u201dXiao Liu laughed and stole the cut piece from him and shoved it in her mouth \u201cI am fully aware. Don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen that you are worried about.\u201dAh Nian looked at Xiao Liu and then Zhuan Xu \u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201dZhuan Xu said to Ah Nian \u201cWe\u2019re talking about how all men are glib-tongued flirts and not to get tricked by them.\u201dAh Nian rolled her eyes and then asked Zhuan Xu \u201cDoes that include you?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cMe too!\u201dZhuan Xu pulled Xiao Liu up \u201cLet\u2019s go over there to see.\u201dWhen the sun was setting, Zhuan Xu had to take Ah Nian to the party and wanted to find Ru So to escort Xiao Liu back but she said in annoyance \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a hothouse flower? I need to be carried everywhere? Without Ah Nian around I can go anywhere so you guys be off and I\u2019ll make my way back.\u201dZhuan Xu rapped her on the head \u201cDon\u2019t go back too late.\u201dIt got rowdier and rowdier the later it got and Xiao Liu drank and made merry with the crowds. But she felt like she was wearing a mask, the exterior being happy while the interior watched dispa.s.sionately. But there was no one around her so who was she acting for?Xiao Liu laughed \u2013 it\u2019s really quite hard to fool oneself.Fireworks suddenly hit up over the Chi Sui river and Xiao Liu squeezed to the edge to watch. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple\u2026\u2026all sorts of colors were rising from the sky from a s.h.i.+p. It illuminated two people standing at the bow of the s.h.i.+p very clearly. The man was wearing a blue robe, standing still and calm, like a bamboo in a forest. The woman was tall and wearing a red robe and appeared to be drunk. She looked up at the fireworks and teetered a few steps and almost tripped. The man reached out to stead her and she curled into his body like a beautiful vine flower.The s.h.i.+p gradually moved off into the distance along with the fireworks so the spectators all dispersed. Xiao Liu remained at the river\u2019s edge staring at the darkened river. It was strange, Yi Yang was not the most beautiful woman Xiao Liu had ever seen, but under the fireworks and the way she almost fell and then leaned into Jing, there was a woman\u2019s elegance and beauty that struck Xiao Liu deeply. It made Xiao Liu, who had been living as a man for two hundred years, feel ashamed and envious.It was deep into the night when Xiao Liu returned to the residence. When she walked in, Zhuan Xu was sitting under a lamp light reading a book and waiting for her. He patted the seat next to him \u201cWhere did you go?\u201dXiao Liu smiled \u201cI suddenly want to find a beautiful skirt to wear.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cOur grandmother is the most revered seamstress G.o.ddess in the entire world. All the most talented seamstresses and artisans have come from her disciples. I\u2019ll have people make you countless beautiful skirts.\u201dXiao Liu softly said \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be used to it since it\u2019s been so long since I wore a skirt.\u201dZhuan Xu stared \u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of disappointing you guys. And with your disappointment in me, I\u2019ll be disappointed in you.\u201d\u201cWho are the you guys? Me and Master? We will never be disappointed in you. If it includes other men\u2026.Xiao Liu\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand was on Xiao Liu\u2019s shoulder \u201cDon\u2019t give yourself hope, then you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201dXiao Liu burst out laughing \u201cI thought you have a better tactic up your sleeve.\u201dZhuan Xu patted her \u201cStop over thinking it, get a good rest and when we get back to Gao Xing, Master has a surprise for you.\u201dXiao Liu nodded.Zhuan Xu walked out of her room and lightly closed the door.The next day as they were departing for Gao Xing, Xing Yue and Feng Long surprisingly came to send them off, a clear sign of how their group had accepted Zhuan Xu. Ah Nian was happy and annoyed but Xiao Liu was just happy. No matter what, Zhuan Xu accomplished what he set out to do when he came to the Autumn Tournament.Before the s.h.i.+p departed, a servant rushed up and bowed to Zhuan Xu before handing over a big basket \u201cMy lord bade me to give this as a parting gift for your journey home. If you visit Qing Qiu in the future, please contact the Tu Shan clan.\u201dZhuan Xu accepted the gift \u201cPlease thank your master for me.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise to see you hit it off with Jing. That\u2019s great!\u201dThe two men bid farewell and the s.h.i.+p slowly pulled away from the dock. Gradually land became further and further away, but Xing Yue remained standing by the dock.Ah Nian scrunched up her nose and humphed before turning to Zhuan Xu \u201cThat Young Master of Qing Qiu seems rather aloof but he\u2019s really warm to Gege. Last night when some other rich sons were purposely being rude to Gege, both Feng Long and Jing helped Gege.\u201d Ah Nian understood that in such a setting, if one made a wrong first impression then it would be very difficult later to be accepted into the group.Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t see the dock anymore and then turned to look for Xiao Liu who had already found a place under the sun and away from the wind to rest. Zhuan Xu pulled Ah Nian over to sit down and Ah Nian pulled the hat off Xiao Liu \u201cYou really are whatever no matter where you are.\u201dZhuan Xu opened the large basket sent by Jing and inside was all sorts of snacks and four jugs of wine. Ah Nian laughed \u201cThis appears to be perfectly tailored for Xiao Liu that lazy cat.\u201dXiao Liu lazily propped herself up \u201cGive me a duck neck.\u201dZhuan Xu put the plate of duck neck where Xiao Liu could reach it and she grabbed one and munched. It tasted just like the flavor in Qing Shui Town, exactly the way Lao Mu made it. Xiao Liu picked up a jug of wine and tried it to discover it was her favorite plum wine from before. Xiao Liu sighed, unsure of whether her sigh was meant for herself or for Jing.The trip home was very enjoyable, sleeping soundly at night, snacking during the day and playing dice and sunning under the sky. In what felt like no time at all, they were back at Five G.o.ds Mountain.Ru So took everyone to report to the Grand Emperor but Ah Nian went to see her mom. Zhuan Xu and Xiao Liu went back to Hua Yin Court.It was already quite cool in the Middle Plains but here in Gao Xing it was still warm as to be muggy. After Zhuan Xu and Xiao Liu washed up, they changed into cool Summer robes and sat in the courtyard catching a breeze. Xiao Liu laid on the pallet and chatted with Zhuan Xu until she fell asleep.When she woke up, she heard voices talking. She opened her eyes and saw her dad and Zhuan Xu, and then two other people as well. She quickly sat up and saw that the two others were strangers. One was a young man wearing all black, very handsome with a pair of beautiful fox eyes that ought to have been rather seductive but on him looked very refined. The other was a young man all in white who wasn\u2019t fully adult yet in height, his features delicate with a pair of green eyes that were filled with anger.Xiao Liu\u2019s heart was thundering and she was too scared to say anything. She nervously looked towards the Grand Emperor.Before the Grand Emperor could say anything, the white robed young man transformed into a white swallow and rushed towards Xiao Liu, viciously pecking her on the head. She clutched her head and tried to run and ended up running into the Grand Emperor\u2019s arms \u201cDaddy, save me.\u201dThe Grand Emperor stopped the swallow and said \u201cLie Yang, that\u2019s enough.\u201dLie Yang stopped and flew to the shoulder of the man in black who looked at Xiao Liu with tears in his eyes. Xiao Liu leaned on the Grand Emperor and asked \u201cAre you Ah Bi?\u201dThe man nodded and transformed into his original form that was a winged fox. Xiao Liu knew the demons who achieved human form were very reluctant to transform into their true form in front of people. But Ah Bi willingly transformed back to his true form so that Xiao Liu wouldn\u2019t feel distant.Xiao Liu kneeled down wrapped her arms around Ah Bi\u2019s neck \u201cSorry I worried you guys.\u201dAh Bi said \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who didn\u2019t take good care of you. All that matters is that you\u2019re back safe and sound.\u201d Ah Bi\u2019s voice was famous within the fox clans for being so melodious because it was low with a soothing timbre.Xiao Liu remembered that he was now a man so felt embarra.s.sed and let Ah Bi go.Ah Bi and Lie Yang both felt a twinge of deep sorrow \u2013 Xiao Yao was the extension of Ah Heng\u2019s life, but she was still not her mother.Ah Bi said to Xiao Liu \u201cThe Grand Emperor told the Royal Mother about your situation. You have a magical spiritual object called the Face Forming Flower in your body. That is an object that was created through tens of thousands of years of power acc.u.mulated in the peach blossom forest of Jade Mountain. It allows a person to forever be beautiful, but it can also be used for transformation.\u201dXiao Liu quickly asked \u201cCan the Royal Mother remove the Face Forming Flower for me?\u201dAh Bi shook his head \u201cShe cannot remove it but she can help you find your true face.\u201dXiao Liu sucked in her breath for a moment and then turned and burst into tears in her dad\u2019s shoulder. After a few moments she wiped her tears away and turned to Ah Bi \u201cAre we headed to Jade Mountain to see the Royal Mother then?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Liu said to the Grand Emperor \u201cI want to go immediately.\u201dHe nodded \u201cLet Zhuan Xu go with you. When you come back I will make an official proclamation to the world that the Eldest Princess of Gao Xing has safely returned.\u201dXiao Liu nodded.Ah Bi said \u201cI\u2019ll take you and Lie Yang can take Zhuan Xu.\u201dLie Yang\u2019s body grew larger and Zhuan Xu bowed respectfully \u201cIf you please\u201d before vaulting on his back. Ah Bi and Lie Yang rose to the sky at the same time and flew towards Jade Mountain.Arriving at Jade Mountain, Xiao Liu was very nervous but she found it exactly as she left it. She couldn\u2019t help but smile and all her nervousness dissipated. Jade Mountain was remote from the entire world and time appeared to be stopped there. It was covered in miles and miles of peach blossom forests. The dawn and dusk shone brightly to create an enchanting view, but it was the same view day after day, year after year. Even the temperature remained constant in the last thousands and tens of thousands of years.They walked through the peach blossom corridors quietly because the Royal Mother didn\u2019t like noise. There were few maids and none looked at them strangely, only giving a curtsy before departing, leaving only reverberating silence.Xiao Liu couldn\u2019t help but want to create noise and said \u201cGege, do you see? If I could choose again, I would still choose to run away from here. I would rather wander the world alone in conflict rather than living a peaceful life resembling death.\u201dZhuan Xu said in a low voice \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dThe Royal Mother was standing by the edge of the pool with the thousands of miles of peach blossoms behind her and a valley before her. She turned and saw Zhuan Xu and Xiao Liu, and her face was weathered and her eyes filled with desolation as if to cause the entire mountain to wither in one glance.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Liu walked up to her and Xiao Liu felt her heart ache and knelt down. Zhuan Xu knelt down with her.The Royal Mother coldly said \u201cYou can get up.\u201dXiao Liu and Zhuan Xu bowed a few times before getting up.The Royal Mother grabbed Xiao Liu\u2019s arm and examined her body. She let go and said coolly \u201cIf you stay in Jade Mountain, I might be able to help you regain your lost powers. My remaining life span is at most one to two hundred years. If you want, you can be the next Royal Mother and control Jade Mountain.\u201dPerhaps controlling Jade Mountain was the greatest dream of many people in the vast wilderness, but Xiao Liu knew exactly what being chained to this mountain was like. She didn\u2019t hesitate and said \u201cI would rather remain this way. Knowing what tomorrow will bring but not knowing what next year will bring. Not too exciting, not too boring.\u201dThe Royal Mother merely nodded her head but her expression never changed, as if nothing in the world or time could ever affect her. A peach blossom branch grew her the tip of her finger and she used it to touch Xiao Liu\u2019s forehead. A bright red peach blossom birthmark appeared in the middle of her forehead.Xiao Liu asked \u201cThe Face Forming Flower is a magical object from Jade Mountain, why can\u2019t you take it out?\u201dThe Royal Mother said coldly \u201cThere is much in this world I cannot do.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cWho put this magical object in my body? Wasn\u2019t it you?\u201dThe Royal Mother replied \u201cWho put it in you doesn\u2019t matter. You need only care that I can help you now. Your body may be unique but your powers are weak now so in the future you will need this to keep your face from aging faster than the other G.o.ddesses. The Face Forming Flower remaining in your body won\u2019t have any harm.\u201dXiao Liu asked \u201cWhen can I regain my true form?\u201dThe Royal Mother said \u201cTake off your clothes and jump into the pool.\u201dXiao Liu glanced at Zhuan Xu who bowed to the Royal Mother before retreating along with Lie Yang and Ah Bi into the dense forest.Xiao Liu took off her clothes and jumped into the pool naked as if to await a rebirth.The Royal Mother started chanting as her hands made a seal. The pool started rippling and thousands of peach blossoms flew towards the pool, dancing in the air and creating a giant blanket that covered the entire pool.Gradually the peach blossom blanket shrank and shrank until finally it became one peach blossom waiting to bloom.The ripples in the pool ceased and the one peach blossom rose to the surface, its peach petals ringed by verdant green leaves wrapping it snugly. The Royal Mother touched the blossom and it opened to reveal a naked girl curled into a ball like a baby. She was sleeping in the middle, her black hair spread over her dewy white skin, making her seem even more fresh than the just bloomed flower.The Royal Mother called \u201cXiao Yao, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201dXiao Yao opened her eyes and slowly sat up. She looked down and wondered if this was herself? She touched her face, is this really me? She leaned over to look at her reflection in the pool but the water was rippling so she couldn\u2019t see.The Royal Mother waved her hand and a green robe landed on the peach blossom \u201cI remember you loved the colors white and green when you were small.\u201dXiao Yao was so dazed she couldn\u2019t speak and could only nod her head.She hadn\u2019t worn female attire in over a hundred years so Xiao Yao felt so clumsy and took a long time to get dressed. She finished tying the ribbon and then stood up on the peach blossom, looking at the Royal Mother who nodded her head.Xiao Yao wanted to call Zhuan Xu out but suddenly was so nervous she couldn\u2019t speak. She suddenly remembered her hair wasn\u2019t tied up and reached for it only to also remember she didn\u2019t have a hair pin. She also long forgotten how to do a woman\u2019s hair so she could only let her hair cascade down her back.The Royal Mother said \u201cYou guys can come out now.\u201dXiao Yao took a deep breath, both nervous and full of antic.i.p.ation, her hands shaking slightly.Zhuan Xu slowly walked out of the peach blossom forest. Initially he didn\u2019t care, no matter what Xiao Yao looked like, she was his Xiao Yao. But waiting in the peach blossom forest for so long, he started to get nervous. He kept his eyes lowered and didn\u2019t dare to look, walking forward and wondering if Xiao Yao looked like Auntie or Master. Until he was at the edge of the pool did he raise his eyes to look \u2014\u2014-A giant peach blossom rested in the pool and in the middle stood a young girl wearing green. IT was as if someone planted a peach blossom in the middle of a lush green valley, collecting all the perfection of the world in one flower. Black hair like silk fell down her back like a waterfall, a small red peach blossom birthmark in the middle of her forehead, her eyes darting in anxiety like a little deer, afraid to meet anyone\u2019s eyes. She was as exquisite as the morning dew on a peach blossom petal.This is my Xiao Yao! Zhuan Xu\u2019s heart thundered like the Spring storm pa.s.sed and he couldn\u2019t say a single word.Xiao Yao noticed Zhuan Xu was speechless and her heart fell. But then she cheered up, no matter how ugly as least this is the real me! She reached out to him \u201cGege, help me!\u201dHer voice was like waking Zhuan Xu up from a dream and he quickly used his power to pull the peach blossom to sh.o.r.e. Xiao Yao came towards him with her hair billowing and her eyes filled with mirth. Zhuan Xu reached out his hand and she grabbed it and vaulted onto land.Xiao Yao bowed to the Royal Mother \u201cThank you Royal Mother for returning my true form.\u201dThe Royal Mother said coolly \u201cThe Face Forming Flower in your body now only can help you maintain your beauty, it no longer can allow you to transform.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cI\u2019ve changed my face enough for a lifetime, I don\u2019t want to change anymore.\u201dThe Royal Mother continued \u201cYou mother entrusted you to me but I didn\u2019t do my duty. You are grown now so you can leave Jade Mountain. If Lie Yang and Ah Bi want, they can leave with you. Or if they want, they can stay here.\u201dThe Royal Mother turned and swiftly disappeared into the peach blossom forest.Xiao Yao walked to Ah Bi and Lie Yang and asked \u201cAre you guys disappointed?\u201dAh Bi said nothing but Lie Yang cut to the chase \u201cI thought you would look like Ah Heng.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI wish that I wouldn\u2019t look like my mom.\u201dLie Yang looked at Xiao Yao\u2019s face carefully and sighed inside. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t look the least bit like Ah Heng, but her eyes were just like that big beast. But in her eyes, there was clarity like a baby, but looking deep showed a coldness.Xiao Yao said \u201cI know you are my mom\u2019s friends and she asked you both to watch over me. But I\u2019m grown now so you don\u2019t need to be held to that promise. Go do what you want to do.\u201dAh Bi looked at Xiao Yao and raised his paw. She grabbed it and there were tears in her eyes. In the epic final battle at Yi Province between Xuan Yuan and Sheng Nong, Ah Bi was gravely injured. When the Grand Emperor sent him to Jade Mountain, he was in a coma and looked like a burned shriveled up fox jerky. The Royal Mother used a ten thousand year old peach leaf to wrap him and soaked him in the deepest pool of bone essence. Only after 50 years did Ah Bi wake up. Xiao Yao knew how close both of them were with her mother and she knew they saw her as an extension of her mother\u2019s life. But she wasn\u2019t her mother, and she never ever wanted to be her mother.Ah Bi said \u201cLie Yang and I will remain at Jade Mountain. The Royal Mother doesn\u2019t need us but we will keep her company for the remainder of her life.\u201dAh Bi shook Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t let what other people say confuse you. Your mother was the best person in this entire world.\u201dXiao Yao nodded but said nothing. Her mom might be the best person, but she was not a good wife, and she was not a good mother.Xiao Yao hugged Ah Bi \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d Xiao Yao looked at Lie Yang and didn\u2019t have the courage to touch him so said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of myself.\u201dLie Yang stared at Zhuan Xu who immediately said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of little sister.\u201dAh Bi reminded Xiao Yao \u201cIf anything happens\u2026..you know where to find us, right?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cI know.\u201d She added \u201cIf the Royal Mother\u2026..send word to me immediately. I want to send her off on the final journey even if she doesn\u2019t need me to.\u201dAh Bi smiled \u201cI will.\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t hold back and rushed back to hug Ah Bi tightly and kissed his fox cheek, and the swiftly touched Lie Yang\u2019s body before turning and disappearing down the corridor.Ah Bi stared while Lie Yang shook his feathers if he was unhappy but there was a twinkle in his eye.The Royal Mother\u2019s winged ride took Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao back to the foot of Jade Mountain. The Grand Emperor seemed to know that Lie Yang and Ah Bi wouldn\u2019t be taking them back so had people waiting for them.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao took the cloud carriage back to Five G.o.ds Mountain. During the trip Zhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao who was in her own world and thinking of G.o.ds knows what.Entering Cheng En Palace, the servant led them directly to Cao Yao Court and Xiao Yao finally seemed to snap out of it by then and she stopped in her tracks \u201cI want to see myself first.\u201dZhuan Xu took out a mirror from a bag of medicines given from the maid at Jade Mountain and handed it to her.Xiao Yao took the mirror but covered it first with her hand \u201cI remember I looked like dad when I was small, but girls can change a lot when they grow so even if I\u2019m not as pretty as Ah Nian I shouldn\u2019t be too ugly.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cYou can see for yourself.\u201dXiao Yao slowly held the mirror up and the girl in the mirror was very strange to her. Only the peach blossom birthmark was familiar. She touched her lips, and the person in the mirror touche her lips. Xiao Yao confirmed this was her and put the mirror away. She said very apologetically to Zhuan Xu \u201cNot too weird, but I look nothing like my dad.\u201dZhuan Xu stared oddly at Xiao Yao but she pushed him ahead \u201cI\u2019ll walk behind you.\u201dZhuan Xu walked inside with Xiao Yao hiding behind him with her head lowered.The Grand Emperor smiled \u201cWhat you are doing hiding behind Zhuan Xu? Didn\u2019t you holler about getting back your true form, but now you\u2019re back you\u2019re hiding.\u201dZhuan Xu wanted to move aside but Xiao Yao grabbed him and pressed her face into his back and murmured \u201cLet me prepare a bit longer.\u201dZhuan Xu stood there not moving but felt this shallow breathing in his lower back that caused s.h.i.+vers and tingles on his skin. It made him want to move aside immediately, and also not want to. He had never felt so strangely torn in his entire life.The Grand Emperor asked \u201cAre you done preparing?\u201dXiao Yao mumble \u201cJust a moment more.\u201dThe Grand Emperor walked over and pulled Xiao Yao out from behind Zhuan Xu and stared at her. Xiao Yao slowly raised her head and met his eyes \u201cI don\u2019t look like mom and I don\u2019t look like you. Are you disappointed?\u201dThe Grand Emperor answered \u201cI don\u2019t want you to look like your mom, and I definitely never wished for you to look like me. I just want you to be healthy, and now you\u2019re not just healthy but beautiful. I am content.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cIn the eyes of all daddies, their daughter is always the prettiest.\u201dThe Grand Emperor looked at her eyes \u2013 the exact same eyes, but in that person it conveyed an arrogance that consumed the world, as well as deep pa.s.sion as hotly burning as a scorching flame. But in Xiao Yao there was only sweet intelligence, and perhaps something more.Xiao Yao saw the Grand Emperor staring at her and his mind appeared elsewhere so she asked \u201cDad, what are you thinking of?\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just feeling how fast time flies, my daughter is all grown up and I\u2019ve grown old.\u201dXiao Yao purposely checked him out and shook her head \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d But she felt a twinge of sadness in her heart. With her father\u2019s power he could easily maintain his youthful visage but his father\u2019s white hairs and wrinkles genuinely conveyed his world weariness.The Grand Emperor laughed and shook his head.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cMaster, when are you making the official proclamation about Xiao Yao\u2019s ident.i.ty?\u201d\u201cI already ordered Ru So to prepare the ceremony.\u201d He looked at Xiao Yao \u201cLater come with me to see Consort Jing An, it\u2019s time to let her and your younger sister know.\u201dXiao Yao nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I heard from Ru So that you get along well with Ah Nian now.\u201dXiao Yao smiled sheepishly \u201cThat\u2019s because she thought you were going to marry her to me and I promised her that would never happen.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cAnd I was wondering why you two were suddenly whispering off to the side all the time.\u201dThe servants came to announce that dinner was prepared at Consort Jing An\u2019s residence so they headed there.When Xiao Yao walked in and saw the Consort Jing An who looked so much like her mom, she still felt like something was twisting in her heart and it hurt painfully. She lowered her head, took a few deep breaths, and calmed herself down.Consort Jing An and Ah Nian greeted the Grand Emperor and went to sit down. Ah Nian helped her mom sit down but her gaze remained on Xiao Yao. The Grand Emperor sat down and indicated for Xiao Yao to sit beside him, and then Zhuan Xu sat down beside her.Ah Nian fumed \u201cDad, who is she? How can she sit there?\u201dThe Grand Emperor said nothing and signed with Consort Jing An, which is when Xiao Yao realized in shock that Consort Jing An was a mute! That is why she never heard her speak before!Xiao Yao looked at Zhuan Xu who indicated that she was like this when her dad married her.The Grand Emperor finished signing and Ah Nian glared at Xiao Yao like a little beast guarding her own nest but with not enough strength to chase the intruder away.The Grand Emperor said to Xiao Yao \u201cGreet the Consort!\u201dXiao Yao stood up to greet the Consort who also stood up and wanted to help Xiao Yao up but then realized it wasn\u2019t proper so quickly pulled her hand back and then just smiled at her. Xiao Yao realized that the Consort was very different than her mom. Under any circ.u.mstance, her mom was calm and serene. Xiao Yao smiled back at the Consort and wanted to show her good intentions.The Consort\u2019s worried gaze faded once she saw and sensed that this girl was good and would not harm her daughter.The Consort signed to Ah Nian to greet her sister.Ah Nian stood up and ask incredulously with mockery \u201cYou really are the daughter of my dad and that woman?\u201dXiao Yao was torn, she hated her mom and would speak poorly of her and her aunt when alone with Zhuan Xu, but she would never allow anyone else to speak in such disrespectful tone of voice about her mom. Years ago the reason for her hatred of the Nine-tailed fox wasn\u2019t just because he tortured her, she cut off his tail one by one after poisoning him because he insulted her mom.Zhuan Xu felt the exact same way as Xiao Yao. His relatives, only he and Xiao Yao can criticize them but no one else! Zhuan Xu harshly rebuked Ah Nian \u201cXiao Yao\u2019s mother is my Aunt, she is also the daughter of the Yellow Emperor and Xi Ling Lie Zhu. And she is also the wife that Master married in the most lavish wedding ceremony in Gao Xing history.\u201dAh Nian knew Zhuan Xu always sided within and she had touched upon his sore spot and she spoke out of turn. But\u2026..he always stood up for her in the past! Ah Nian stared at Zhuan Xu and her body shook. She pointed at Xiao Yao with her eyes full of tears \u201cShe\u2019s your relative so you protect her. What about me? What am I?\u201dZhuan Xu said clearly \u201cMaster is like my father and I\u2019ve pretty much watch you grow up. Of course you\u2019re my relative as well.\u201dAh Nian felt better but had to ask \u201cBut me and her, who would you protect more?\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing so Ah Nian\u2019s voice changed and she shrieked \u201cAnswer me!\u201dXiao Yao shot Zhuan Xu a glance indicating for him to quickly placate Ah Nian, one word would end this, but the normally talkative Zhuan xu was silent and said nothing.Ah Nian cried \u201cAnswer me! Between me and her, who would you protect more?\u201dThe Grand Emperor sighed \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, child, how would you answer if I asked you to pick between your mom and dad. Could you answer?\u201dAh Nian lowered her head and wiped her tears but said nothing.Zhuan Xu spoke up \u201cXiao Yao is Xiao Liu. On the way back to Gao Xing, didn\u2019t you secretly tell me that you think Xiao Liu is pretty great? Now you have a very capable older sister to take care of you, isn\u2019t that nice?\u201dAh Nian jerked her head up. Her dad just told her and mom that he found his long lost daughter but never said Xiao Yao was Xiao Liu.Xiao Yao smiled at Ah Nian who couldn\u2019t connect the beautiful Xiao Yao with the lowlife Xiao Liu. She felt horrible inside and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t want an older sister!\u201d She kicked over her table of food and stormed out. Consort Jing An stood up and looked at the Grand Emperor who indicated for her to follow and she left as well.Xiao Yao sat down and stared at the mess. Zhuan Xu comforted her \u201cThis is all too sudden, she needs some time to process it.\u201dThe Grand Emperor raised his hand and servants came in and silently cleaned the room. The Grand Emperor ordered \u201cPrepare some of the Princess\u2019s favorite foods and send it to her residence.\u201dThe Grand Emperor resumed eating just like normal, as if nothing had just happened. Xiao Yao stared \u201cDad, how can you eat?\u201dThe Grand Emperor glanced over \u201cDo you know how much happens in one day in national affairs. If this little fuss causes me to lose my appet.i.te, your dad would have starved to death long ago.\u201dZhuan Xu also started eating, and Xiao Yao looked around and also joined in. She ate some but felt full and couldn\u2019t eat anymore, whereas the Grand Emperor and Zhuan Xu ate their normal amounts.After dinner, the Grand Emperor said to Xiao Yao \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201dXiao Yao and Zhuan Xu walked beside him and instead of heading towards Qi Qing Garden, the Grand Emperor took her on a walk throughout the entire Cheng En Palace. Every court they pa.s.sed he would ask her whether she liked it. Xiao Yao knew he wanted her to pick a residence and said \u201cI want some place close to Hua Yin Court for now.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cMing Se Court is the closest but it\u2019s not good so pick another.\u201dXiao Yao grabbed her dad\u2019s arm \u201cDaddy, you\u2019ve been to Jade Mountain right? I stayed there for 70 years, and later stayed in the mountain for 20 some years all alone, and then that evil Nine-tailed fox captured me for 30 years. I\u2019m not scared anything other than being scared of being alone. I want to be closer to Gege.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s heart softened and agreed \u201cYes.\u201dThe Grand Emperor continued to stroll with Xiao Yao and by the time they arrived at Ming Se Court, the entire court was lit up in lights and completely cleaned and ready. Even Xiao Yao\u2019s favorite snacks were prepared, and her maids from Hua Yin Court came out and greeted her. The Grand Emperor said to Xiao Yao \u201cGao Xing\u2019s tradition is white and the royal family attire is all white-based. But you can wear whatever you want in your personal time. I remember you like white and green when you were small so I ordered them to stock more green robes and dresses in your wardrobe.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI still like green.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou keep Xiao Yao company, I\u2019m going to check on Ah Nian.\u201dZhuan Xu accompanied Xiao Yao and looked around Ming Se Court. It was small but exactly what Xiao Yao wanted.Zhuan Xu asked Xiao Yao \u201cAnything else missing?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cYears of wandering left me with a few habits. I like to eat, delicious food is the most practical thing. I can sleep anywhere, a pallet is a pallet. I know things are hard to take with me so I have very few desire for objects.\u201d Xiao Yao laid down on the soft pallet \u201cThese things, I\u2019ll enjoy when I have it, and when I don\u2019t I won\u2019t miss it.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou\u2019re not wandering anymore.\u201dXiao Yao lazily drawled \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change habits formed when one\u2019s growing up.\u201dUnder the lamp light, Xiao Yao\u2019s snow white skin made the red peach blossom on her forehead even more entrancing. Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t help but touch it gently with his finger \u201cThis peach blossom birthmark is so real, like someone shoved a peach blossom right into your forehead.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cYou said the exact same thing when we were kids. One time you coaxed me not to move and then used your finger to try and pry it out. You made my forehead all red and raw.\u201dZhuan Xu also laughed \u201cI remember now! Then you punched me twice in the face and my mouth was all bruised. Then you went to tattle to my mom.\u201dXiao Yao started to get sleepy and slowly closed her eyes \u201cAuntie was torn between laughing and crying and smacked you twice. But I heard her secretly saying that she was so mad because you couldn\u2019t even win a fight with a girl\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu wistfully stood up and said to the maid \u201cHelp the Princess to wash up and head to bed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiao Yao is back to being a girl in Lost You Forever, but not just any girl, she\u2019s a Princess with bloodlines that are the most ill.u.s.trious in the entire vast wilderness. Her grandfather is the Yellow Emperor and her grandmother was Empress Xi Ling Lei Zhu, the powerful daughter of one of the Four Great Clans. Xiao Yao\u2019s mother is Xuan Yuan Ba (aka Xi Ling Heng) the only daughter of the Yellow Emperor and her actions made her the beloved Princess of Xuan Yuan, not to mention she\u2019s got two daddies that divide up the rest of the world. Her birth father is General Qi Yo of the Sheng Nong Kingdom while and her legal father is the Grand Emperor Gao Xing Shao Hao. So marrying Xiao Yao is pretty much like punching a ticket to ruling the world. That doesn\u2019t mean her life is suddenly sacrificed to politics and ambition, she\u2019s way too savvy to stand for that, nor does the people around her see her as a bargaining chip. In fact, because her mother\u2019s life was so utterly sacrificed to kingdom and country, the people who love Xiao Yao don\u2019t want the same fate to befall her. That might even extend to her romance, as her mother\u2019s love was so Romeo and Juliet, and sometimes dying for love isn\u2019t as romantic as it seems.Xiao Yao is already a pragmatic leading lady and I don\u2019t see her falling crazy in love for any guy, or at least if she does love someone I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll acknowledge it or even pursue it the way her mother did.\u00a0Her mother\u2019s demon best friends the winged fox Ah Bi and the swallow Lie Yang were both right that Xiao Yao is nothing like Ah Heng, but that only makes Xiao Yao\u2019s life really fascinating because it\u2019s hard to predict how she thinks, feels, or will do. She\u2019s not loyal to anything other than the people she cares about, and that limited scope purpose of her life will be b.u.t.ting up against her birthright that decrees she\u2019s the top prize in a world she lives in. Xiang Liu has been MIA for awhile but he comes back in a pretty major way in this episode, as usual swanning back into Xiao Yao\u2019s world in his devil may care att.i.tude. Jing is a very straightforward guy to like, he wears his heart on his sleeve to Xiao Yao. Zhuan Xu plays the big brother role to perfection but Xiao Yao is so close to him she might not be able to sense his non-platonic feelings even if he hints at it. And Xiang Liu is pretty much the frustrating boyfriend who rarely says when he means simply because he can\u2019t afford to, and in this case, even if he does Xiao Yao is clueless about it.Chapter 13 \u2013 The Peach Blossom Beauty, Blooming in Glory:The servants in Cheng En Palace all knew Xiao Yao\u2019s ident.i.ty because when they saw her they called her \u201cPrincess\u201d like they did with Ah Nian. None of them acted strange, as if Xiao Yao lived in the Palace her entire life.Xiao Yao was impressed with her dad, it was easier to control an army than the details within the house. How much power and oversight did he have that Cheng En Palace was efficiently running through and through.Zhuan Xu was so busy lately that he could only come see Xiao Yao at night. But he would talk to her the entire night until she fell asleep and then he would leave. When Xiao Yao was bored, she often went to Qi Qing Garden to swim. She worried about running into Ah Nian, but Cheng En Palace was so ma.s.sive that she never felt like a consort and another princess lived here.When she was swimming, the maids would would fan out and guard the garden for her so that no one would run across the princess. It was quiet all around and swimming made Xiao Yao think of her mom. She used to think she would never think about her mom, but in truth she still missed her a lot and merely forced herself not to think of her. Back in familiar surroundings, this missing her grew stronger and stronger but along with it came pain. With an ounce of missing came an ounce of pain, and with an ounce of pain came an ounce of anger.Xiao Yao felt that she must be growing lonely again and forced herself to think of other things. Swimming, swimming\u2026..there must be other things in her life connected with swimming\u2026..Xiao Yao suddenly missed Nine-lives Xiang Liu very much. If he was here, likely she would not have any time to think about the past. But Wen Xiao Liu was gone and even if she ran into Xiang Liu in the future, he would not recognize her anymore.Xiao Yao floated on the surface and sighed deeply.That night after dinner, Xiao Yao headed towards Hua Yin Court to find Zhuan Xu and ran into Ah Nian.Ah Nian was already frustrated after days of not seeing Zhuan Xu, so running into Xiao Yao was like pouring gasoline on the fire. She ordered the maids to step aside and walked up to Xiao Yao. \u201cWhy are you keeping Zhuan Xu gege all to yourself?\u201dXiao Yao tried to explained \u201cI\u2019m not. He\u2019s too busy, I only see him every night for a little bit.\u201dAh Nian heard this and realized Xiao Yao saw Zhuan Xu every day and that made her so angry she didn\u2019t know what else to do. She actually shoved Xiao Yao like a little kid fighting.Xiao Yao\u2019s powers were weak so she fell on the ground. In an utter coincidence, Zhuan Xu came back right at that moment and saw this scene. He rushed over and helped Xiao Yao up while berating \u201cAh Nian, don\u2019t you know Xiao Yao has almost no powers? Next time you resort to violence, I\u2019ll have to ask Master to punish you.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s tears fell and she rushed forward and violently pushed Zhuan Xu while sobbing \u201cWhat if I want to resort to violence? I did it so tell my daddy to punish me! Best beat me to death, then you\u2019ll be happy since no one wants me anymore\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t want to harm Ah Nian so didn\u2019t use any power and was therefore shoved backwards by her.Xiao Yao quickly snuck away. Zhuan Xu\u2019s servant walked past and she told him \u201cI need to talk to my dad tonight so tell Gege he doesn\u2019t need to come see me.\u201dXiao Yao snuck into Cao Yao Court and sat beside the Grand Emperor, peering at what he was doing. He smiled at her and kept on working.After some time, Xiao Yao got bored and stood up, walking around and touching things. The Grand Emperor asked \u201cHave you learned the \u201cSheng Nong Book of Herbs\u201d left by your mother?\u201dXiao Yao pointed to her head \u201cThe Royal Mother said that was a bad thing so forced me to memorize it and then destroyed the manual.\u201d The Grand Emperor said \u201cThere are lots of medical books on the shelf over there. If you have time then read it. If there is something you don\u2019t understand, you can ask the doctors in the Palace.\u201dXiao Yao walked over and flipped open a book, but it wasn\u2019t a medical book like her dad suggested, but a book on how to harm others. Ah Nian\u2019s push today reminded Xiao Yao that she can\u2019t let her guard down!Father and daughter, one sat on the throne working, the other rested on a pillow reading medical texts. This went on until late into the night when the Grand Emperor escorted Xiao Yao back to her residence before returning to his.Xiao Yao started researching poisons again. During the day she went to find the palace doctors to discuss and at night she went to hang out with her dad. Everyday she was busy and it made her feel better. The only regret was that there was no one around for her to test her poisons on.One night Xiao Yao was in Cao Yao Court admiring the latest poison she concocted, feeling very sad that she couldn\u2019t give it to Xiang Liu.She took out her most precious mirror and pulled up the memory she saved in it. One was when she drew nine heads on Xiang Liu\u2019s face, and the other was after she moved the voodoo bug from Zhuan Xu to Xiang Liu and walked along the ocean floor with him. She secretly used the mirror to record that moment.In the dark blue ocean depths, Xiang Liu\u2019s white hair white robe was so elegant and refined as he swam, the white hair billowing behind him, making his already handsome face even more ethereally beautiful.\u201cWho is he?\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s voice asked and Xiao Yao was so surprised, turning around to discover her dad was sitting behind her and looking into the mirror. He was clearly curious about the man in his daughter\u2019s mirror.Xiao Yao said \u201cA friend who is not quite a friend.\u201dThe Grand Emperor laughed \u201cI thought at this time you would be missing the Tu Shan clan\u2019s little fox.\u201dXiao Yao made a face \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s walking with his fiancee under the moonlight, happy as can be. I\u2019m not an idiot, why think of him?\u201dThe Grand Emperor stared at Xiao Yao and her candid honesty.Xiao Yao knew she likely spoke too baldly and laughed \u201cI will be careful in front of others when I speak and not embarra.s.s you.\u201dThe Grand Emperor sighed \u201cYou and your mother\u2026..are nothing alike.\u201d And that person, they were both so pa.s.sionate people. Yet Xiao Yao was cold-hearted and rational.Xiao Ya wanted to put the mirror away but the Grand Emperor took it \u201cThe are gorilla beasts in the vast wilderness that can see the past but not the future. I\u2019ve only heard the legend of a beast being made into a mirror but never seen it. Where did you get this mirror?\u201dXiao Yao pouted and said \u201cThat Nine-tailed fox gave it to me so that I could maintain my face after I saved it in the mirror. Having this mirror is what made me not afraid anymore.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cBeing able to keep something of his, that means you really have moved on.\u201dXiao Yao shrugged \u201cHe\u2019s dead, why do I want to let him continue tormenting me mentally.\u201d\u201cYou live very freely.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cBetter said that I\u2019m greedy and don\u2019t want to waste a treasure.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s hand waved over the mirror and called up the image of Xiang Liu under the sea \u201cDoes this friend who is not a friend deserve for you to keep him in your memory forever?\u201dXiao Yao took the mirror back \u201cThis is just for fun, maybe I\u2019ll erase it tomorrow.\u201dThe Grand Emperor laughed and appeared to want to say something, but Xiao Yao stretched and said \u201cSo tired!\u201dHe pulled her up \u201cI\u2019ll take you back to rest.\u201dBack at Ming Se Court, Xiao Yao wanted some water and was about to drink when she sensed and opened the pitcher to find bugs floating inside. She murmured \u201cAh Nian, why are you so weak? If you can be as strong and smart as that Nine-headed demon Xiang Liu, then my days would be way more interesting.\u201dThe maid making the bed gasped and Xiao Yao walked over to find the entire bed shredded by a knife. She shook her head wearily.A maid said \u201cDaily torment like this can\u2019t go on, how about we tell His majesty?\u201d So many days and endless situations from snakes in the bathtub to sand in the rice.The Eldest Princess didn\u2019t seem to care, she would play with the snake while bathing, and keep on eating the rice and crunching through the sand. But the maids were at the end of their rope with the tricks.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cYou guys tell the Emperor. But if Ah Nian finds out, you guys deal with the consequences!\u201dAll the maids grew silent.Xiao Yao grabbed the least shredded blanket \u201cLet\u2019s all sleep tonight and tomorrow go get some new blankets.\u201dThe last day of Winter, Ru So brought the ceremonial gown for Xiao Yao to wear at the proclamation ceremony. The Grand Emperor summoned Xiao Yao to try it on and get it tailored.She went to try on the gown with four maids a.s.sisting and then walked back to court.A white long robe with a cinched waist, it made her figure seem lithe and elegant. An outer robe was made out of long gauze with a train stretched long behind her. The outer robe was embroidered with red and black thread into the design of a swallow and peach blossom portrait. When the entire gown was spread out, it appeared that the entire ground was covered with peach blossoms.Xiao Yao was walking with the long train behind her and was afraid of tripping so she looked straight ahead and walked very very slow. The cinched waist robe was tightly hugging her waist and she could barely breath. It made her back ramrod straight and she cursed how this gown was designed to torture her. She pursed her lips and her annoyance was clearly evident in her eyes.When she walked into court, Ru So and all the courtiers felt dazzled by the peach blossoms bursting behind Xiao Yao as she walked. With her red peach blossom birthmark on her forehead, she was enchanting but for the coldness in her eyes.The Grand Emperor looked at Xiao Yao and his heart clenched in a long sigh. Right now Xiao Yao looked so much like that person \u2013 whether it was the dazzling colors of the world, the endless delights of the Earth, it was all just yellow soil under the feet.Xiao Yao steadied herself and put her hands around her hips and asked \u201cDad, how long do I need to wear this outfit at the ceremony?\u201dEveryone let out a sigh of relief and Ru So felt that this Princess was so cute. But he was also looking forward to the day of the ceremony when the Princess would wear this gown and walk up the high altar tower, with her hair done and wearing makeup, the effect would be infinitely more stunning than today. It would surely strike shock and awe into the eyes of every guest attending from the entire vast wilderness.The Grand Emperor shook his head \u201cThis outfit is no good, make another one!\u201dXiao Yao was so happy she almost jumped with glee except for her waist being so tightly constricted that she couldn\u2019t move.Ru So was gobsmacked. How could this outfit be no good? He looked around and everyone else was just as perplexed. If anyone had eyes, only Xiao Yao and the Grand Emperor thought this outfit wasn\u2019t good.Ru So stammered \u201cThe ceremony is in fifteen days, an outfit worthy of such an event can\u2019t be made in such a short period of time.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said coolly \u201cThat is why I am putting you in charge of it.\u201d\u201cI shall do my utmost!\u201dWhen Ru So was leaving, Xiao Yao ran up to him and patted him on the shoulder before whispering \u201cMake it looser.\u201d\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t worry, the seamstresses will measure you properly to make the outfit.\u201d Ru So moved away from Xiao Yao\u2019s hand, not sure when he was suddenly so chummy with the Princess.The whole world thought the Grand Emperor brought Xiao Yao back from Jade Mountain. Even someone as smart as Ru So didn\u2019t connect the dots that Xiao Yao was Xiao Liu. She smiled and walked away a bit sadly.The invitations were dispatched to all the prominent families in the vast wilderness and the world was abuzz with news that the Eldest Princess of Gao Xing who had been missing for nearly three hundred years had finally been found.The Grand Emperor didn\u2019t like pomp and circ.u.mstance, but this time for his daughter he actually sent invitations to every important family. All the families had to consider the Grand Emperor, as well as the Yellow Emperor, and even the Royal Mother, and thus everyone accepted and rushed to Gao Xing.By the night before the ceremony, the Ying Province in Five G.o.ds Mountain was filled with guests from far and wide. Ying Province was part of Five G.o.ds Mountain but it was actually both ringed by a peak and by the ocean. There was inns, restaurants, stores, everything was there for guests to enjoy and visit. The rest of the vast wilderness was blanketed in deep Winter still, but in Gao Xing it was as warm as Spring with hundreds of flowering blooming. Guests who had never visited Gao Xing before marveled at the sights and could even rent a boat out for an ocean cruise.Zhuan Xu came to find Xiao Yao bright and early in the morning \u201cFeng Long and Xing Yue have both arrived. I\u2019ll be meeting them in a bit to show them around.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cAs a member of Gao Xing, or as the Xuan Yuan Prince?\u201d\u201cOf course as the Xuan Yuan Prince. If I tell them now, they will be shocked but won\u2019t feel too misled. If later they discovered my real ident.i.ty on their own, then that would feel like a real betrayal.\u201d\u201cYou go have fun. I have tons of stuff to do today, and later have to try on my new outfit. If you come back late then no need to come see me. Ru So asked me to sleep early today so tomorrow I\u2019m looking bright eyed and bushy tailed and won\u2019t embarra.s.s Gao Xing in front of the entire world.\u201dXiao Yao thought about Ru So and fumed, he was basically torturing her these past few days with his endless requirements. She wondered if he was in Ah Nian\u2019s pocket.\u201cIsn\u2019t the outfit done already?\u201d\u201cIt was so uncomfortable!\u201dZhuan Xu was about to leave when he turned back \u201cThe Tu Shan clan, other than Jing, his twin brother Hou is also here. Jing should be with Feng Long and them. I\u2019ll be taking two pairs of twins out sightseeing.\u201dXiao Yao wanted to say something but decided not to influence Zhuan Xu\u2019s opinion, and let him meet Tu Shan Hou and form his own impression. Xiao Yao waved her hand indicating Zhuan Xu should hurry off.Zhuan Xu lamented \u201cWhen Jing sees you, he\u2019ll regret leaving.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t understand what he mean and didn\u2019t have time to figure it out. She rushed to eat breakfast afraid that when Ru So arrived she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat any.Zhuan Xu found Feng Long and Xing Yue at Jing\u2019s residence, where Yi Yang and Hou were also there. Zhuan Xu glanced at Hou and found him a very athletic handsome man.Feng Long and Xing Yue were very happy to see Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue said to her brother \u201cSee, I told you he would come find us when he heard we came.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend indeed!\u201dZhuan Xu immediately said \u201cI have something to apologize to you all for.\u201dHe explained his real ident.i.ty and apologized again to Feng Long, Xing Yue, Jing, and Yi Yang \u201cI wasn\u2019t intentionally trying to conceal my ident.i.ty, but that trip I was with the Gao Xing convoy so it would make things awkward if I revealed who I was.\u201dXing Yue was shocked but then her heart jumped for joy, and this secret joy made her cheeks blush red as her heart jumped wildly. She lowered her head and said nothing, appearing like she was angry.Feng Long didn\u2019t care like Zhuan Xu expected \u201cI knew you and Ah Nian were a little strange. I just never expected you were the Prince. Then Ah Nian is\u2026.\u201d\u201cGao Xing\u2019s Second Princess.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s eyebrow raised \u201cHer highness the Princess!\u201d He looked at Jing and Yi Yang \u201cSee? I\u2019m a good enough friend, right? For your celebration, I even got the Xuan Yuan Prince and the Gao Xing Princess to attend.\u201dZhuan Xu bowed \u201cCan you guys let this one slide then!\u201dYi Yang walked up to curtsy \u201cI didn\u2019t know Your highness\u2019 real ident.i.ty back then and injured Your highness. Will Your highness please forgive.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, plus we already put it behind us and are friends, right?\u201dFeng Long laughed and turned to his sister \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, you conceal your ident.i.ty when you go out as well to play. It\u2019s not intentional lying, it\u2019s for ease of travel.\u201dYi Yang put her arms around Xing Yue \u201cSeeing His highness being so solicitous and regretful, just forgive him.\u201dXing Yue raised her head and glanced around before smiling \u201cI\u2019ll punish him by making him take us all out to play. And he pays for everything.\u201dZhuan Xu \u201cOf course I\u2019ll be paying.\u201dZhuan Xu led the group out to try the local foods of Gao Xing.The restaurants of Ying Province were all well kept no matter big or small. Because the weather was warm all year round, flowers grew everywhere and the stores like to plant fresh flowers in front. Strolling the streets, there was water flowing and flowers in front of each storefront, the entire place was so delightful to the ladies.Zhuan Xu led them into a restaurant and sat down. The owner picked up melons and wine being iced in the flower stream outside and put it on the table for them.Zhuan Xu explained \u201cThe people in the Middle Plains like to drink wine as is or warmed, but in Gao Xing the wine is drunk ice cold. This wine is made from the fruit in the mountains, try it.\u201dXing Yue took a sip and marveled \u201cIt\u2019s so delicious.\u201dYi Yang drank a cup and looked out the window and sighed \u201cIf one can put everyone aside and live in a place like this with a loved one for the rest of one\u2019s life, it would be worth it.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cJing gege, did you hear that?\u201dJing\u2019s body was stiff and he kept his eyes lowered and said nothing. It was instead Tu Shan Hou who looked at Yi Yang and then gulped his wine down.The entire restaurant was filled with people discussing the return of the Gao Xing Eldest Princess, from her mysterious disappearance to her mysterious return. What made everyone marvel the most was her background \u2013 the daughter of the Grand Emperor, the granddaughter of the Yellow Emperor, the disciple of the Royal Mother.Someone sighed wistfully \u201cTo marry her is to vault to the top in one step.\u201dAnother snarked \u201cMaybe she\u2019s hideously ugly, even if one vaults to the top it\u2019ll be accompanied by nightmares every night.\u201dSome men started laughing but Feng Long noticed Zhuan Xu\u2019s smile that indicated clearly that he disagreed with that a.s.sessment. Feng Long asked curiously \u201cWhat does your cousin look like?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cWhen you see her, you\u2019ll understand.\u201dXing Yue asked sweetly \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends, that why we should find out earlier than others!\u201dZhuan Xu hesitated \u201cI really don\u2019t know how to describe.\u201dWomen are more fixated on beauty than most so Xing Yue pressed on \u201cHow does she look compared to Ah Nian?\u201dZhuan Xu pretended to think and said \u201cThat\u2019s like comparing the flowers in the garden. The orchid has an orchid\u2019s beauty. The rose has a rose\u2019s beauty. It\u2019s incomparable.\u201dXing Yue was not pleased but Yi Yang interjected \u201cNo matter what type of beauty, clearly she doesn\u2019t have the looks that would worry a guy.\u201dZhuan Xu pointed to the dishes on the table \u201cThis is plants from the sea and very refres.h.i.+ng, try it.\u201dFeng Long and Hou understood he didn\u2019t want to talk about his cousin anymore so started eating and changed the topic to the different cuisine between Gao Xing and the Middle Plains. Yi Yang and Xing Yue also happily joined in.Jing\u2019s hand was on his knee and it was tightly clenched into a fist as he sat there and never said a word.The next day dawned as all the guests gathered at the summit of Five G.o.ds Mountain to watch the Grand Emperor and the Princess pray to the Heavens and ancestors as a ceremony to official welcome the Gao Xing Princess home.No matter how carefree Xiao Yao was, she knew some occasions had to be taken seriously. Such as today. She didn\u2019t know why her dad decided on such a grand ceremony, but she did not want to embarra.s.s him. She kept reminding herself that her every move represented Gao Xing, and if she made a mistake it would shame all of Gao Xing.She woke up at dawn, washed up and had breakfast, got her hair and makeup done, all the while running through what she had to do today.Zhuan Xu ran over to check on her and tell her not to be nervous. He conceded Gao Xing\u2019s ceremonial structure was scarily complicated, but that was also why no one really knew all the details, so even if she made a mistake it should be fine and no one would notice.Xiao Yao knew he was attending today as a representative of the Yellow Emperor so he had a lot of things to prepare as well and sent him on his way.When Xiao Yao was all done up, Ru So was waiting for her outside to escort her to the ceremony. The maids brought the ceremonial outfit and prepared to dress her.Xiao Yao liked this new outfit. Due to the time constraint, it wasn\u2019t as elaborately embroidered but the effort was spent on the material and the accessories. The white dress robe was in the design of cloud patterns and paired with jade accessories. It was elegant and refined and way more comfortable than the first dress.When the maids shook out the dress, there was a collective gasp. Xiao Yao looked over and saw the dress was slashed in the skirt area and dirt was smeared on it. A maid familiar with laundering clothing looked at the damage and said \u201cThis is special dirt and cannot be washed out.\u201dEveryone in the room was white-faced with fear. The Grand Emperor was a very calm person and rarely got mad, but when he did get mad it was like a living nightmare. Many of the maids started crying right then and there.Xiao Yao sighed. That Ah Nian is really too gutsy. She put on a robe and said to to the maid to bring Ru So in to discuss how to salvage the situation. Ru So rushed in and didn\u2019t even greet her before going to check on the dress. His face changed and hollered \u201cWho did it? If I find out, I will kill her entire family!\u201dXiao Yao was sitting on the pallet and said dryly \u201cThen you need to toss in my dad.\u201dRu So seethed \u201cAh Nian that little devious wrecker, does she want us all to die!\u201dThe entire room full of maids couldn\u2019t control themselves any longer and started sobbing.Ru So pointed at Xiao Yao and yelled \u201cStop looking so innocent! This is clearly not Ah Nian\u2019s first time doing something, and if it wasn\u2019t for you letting her get away with it, it wouldn\u2019t have escalated to today! Your sisterly fight has now implicated everyone!\u201dThe maids sobbing grew louder until it was a room full of female wailing as some maids collapsed on the floor.Xiao Yao pointed at her nose and laughed \u201cSir Ru So, stop acting. If all you want is for me to agree with your next suggestion, then say it and I\u2019ll do it.\u201dRu So calmed and bowed to Xiao Yao \u201cI do have an idea. Do you remember the first outfit?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Yao thought of it as well which is why she asked for Ru So to be summoned.Ru So acted all conflicted \u201cWe have to use that one one even if His majesty really doesn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s too late to discuss with him, but if we do it without telling him and he casts blames\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take all the blame!\u201d Xiao Yao smiled at Ru So clearly indicating she knew that was what he wanted all along.Ru So m.u.f.fled his smile and thought about spending all his time with the Princess these past few days preparing for the ceremony. In the end, he started to understand why the Grand Emperor doted on her so much.Ru So left \u201cI will order it prepared immediately.\u201dThe maids all stopped crying when they heard there was another outfit and got back to work.Ru So brought the outfit over and eight maids helped Xiao Yao put it on. When the waist was being cinched, one maid called out instructions while two maids pulled. Xiao Yao moaned painfully \u201cI\u2019m really got to be broken in two.\u201dThe eight capable maids flitted around like b.u.t.terflies and finally Xiao Yao was all dressed. Ru So called from outside \u201cThe time is already here, are you ready?\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d The maids called out together.Xiao Yao walked out stiffly while four maids carried her train behind her. Ru So respectfully escorted her onto the cloud carriage. Xiao Yao was in no mood to talk during the ride, thinking through all the specifics of the upcoming ceremony.The cloud carriage arrived at the summit and the maids helped Xiao Yao disembark. She walked into the cloud tent and the maids checked her hair and makeup one last time. Ru So solemnly reminded her \u201cPrincess, many people will be watching you. Don\u2019t look at them and pretend no one is there.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at him \u201cIt appears you\u2019re more nervous than me.\u201dA horn sounded and Ru So said \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201dXiao Yao took a soft breath and said to herself: This is nothing. Dad is waiting for met at the summit altar. This is the same as the rehearsal, just with one more set of steps.Xiao Yao slowly walked out of the cloud tent and the maids helped adjust her train.The entire summit altar was constructed from white jade and consisted of 99 steps to the top, starting out wide and narrowing as it got to the top. Both sides of the steps were ringed with Gao Xing ceremonial guards who looked very imposing. All the guests were dressed in their finest and watching from the stands.Ah Nian was smiling as she waited for disaster to happen.Zhuan Xu was calm yet expectant \u2013 this moment wasn\u2019t just Xiao Yao\u2019s coming back, it also marked his imminent return.Jing was filled with antic.i.p.ation. He wanted countless times to see Xiao Yao\u2019s true form and now he was finally going to see her. But even more nervous was standing with other guests watching from afar, making him feel he was so distant from her.The sun was s.h.i.+ning brightly and flooding the summit with light. A young girl gracefully walked up the summit steps.Her inky black hair was upswept, a white dress robed with a cinched waist paired with an outer gossamer veil robe with a long flowing train. The robe was embroidered using red and black thread into the design of a swallow and peach blossom forest. As she walked, the robe fanned out on the white jade steps. The peach blossoms extended from her waist on down and created the image of an entire forest of blooming peach blossoms covering the steps.The girl followed the sound of the horn and walked straight forward with her head slightly raised as she stared ahead to the top of the summit. Her snow white skin, fine features, and a small peach blossom right in the center of her forehead \u2013 she was breathtaking. A who\u2019s who of the entire world was here for her but her expression was aloof, her lips tightly pressed together without a hint of a smile, and her eyes conveyed her annoyance and unhappiness to be here, with a dash of scorn.Whether it was the bright sun s.h.i.+ning down, or steps full of peach blossoms, but everyone felt a little woozy like the image was dizzying.Zhuan Xu and Jing stood in the very front and could see the clearest. Zhuan Xu was slightly angry but didn\u2019t know why he was angry. Jing felt this awe inducing sight before him transformed into unease. It was like he wanted to grab onto something, but couldn\u2019t grab onto anything.Xiao Yao stood very still before the Grand Emperor and bowed to him. The Grand Emperor sighed \u2013 so often fate is on its own tracks and no one could stop it.The Grand Emperor took Xiao Yao to pray to the Heavens, and then prayed to the Gao Xing ancestors. Xiao Yao\u2019s mind was blank, all she knew was that she was praying praying praying in between all the chanting and bowing. Thanks to Ru So\u2019s daily torturous training, she was able to do this feeling completely numb and just going through the memorized motions. She secretly scoffed, the more one looked totally stiff, the more the spectators would consider her totally proper in such a solemn setting.Until the very end, when Xiao Yao felt like her body was so stiff it was about to collapse, she heard the announced that the ceremony concluded. Servants escorted all the guests from the summit.Xiao Yao got on the cloud carriage and let out a huge breath. The Grand Emperor asked \u201cTired?\u201dXiao Yao nodded. The Grand Emperor continued \u201cWhen you get back, take off the outfit and go rest. You don\u2019t need to come to tonight\u2019s banquet if you don\u2019t want.\u201d\u201cDad, aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d Xiao Yao didn\u2019t need to go but the Grand Emperor had to do even if he didn\u2019t like socializing.\u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cDad, how come you\u2019re not asking why I\u2019m wearing the outfit you don\u2019t like?\u201d\u201cClearly Ah Nian must\u2019ve ruined the other one.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cI knew you were aware of all the stuff she was doing.\u201d\u201cIf I knew this, I would have stepped in. But\u2026\u2026Ah Nian is using unreasonableness to hide her unease and insecurity. When it was just her, she was the only and never had to fight for anything. Now that you are here, she compares herself to you. The only ones who can rea.s.sure her are Zhuan Xu and myself. I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m playing favorites so I\u2019m more lenient with her right now. But I feel like\u2026..some things are between you sisters and you guys need to resolve it yourselves.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s fear, Xiao Yao could understand the worry that she would take away her dad and older brother. But insecurity? Xiao Yao laughed \u201cI can take care of it myself, I just wanted to let her vent enough before dealing with her.\u201dThe Grand Emperor sighed loudly \u201cThis life, I\u2019ve used everything I have to exchange for everything I want. I have regrets but will still do it again. The only thing I worry about is the two of you sisters. If you can love and accept each other sincerely and look out for each other, then I will have nothing else to worry about.\u201dThis was the rare instance of the Grand Emperor revealing genuine sadness and it made Xiao Yao feel terrible. But there are some things that one cannot do alone. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t have faith she could do what her dad asked with Ah Nian so didn\u2019t want to make a promise she couldn\u2019t keep. But she vowed to try her best.The cloud carriage returned to the Palace, with the Grand Emperor was.h.i.+ng up and heading to the banquet in Qi Qing Garden while Xiao Yao returned to Ming Se Court.The maids knew her personality so immediately took off her outfit and removed her makeup. After taking a hot bath, Xiao Yao finally felt like she was alive again.Xiao Yao would never envy a woman with a willowy cinched waist anymore. She had the maid find a loose fitting robe to put on and then she sprawled on the pallet while the maids did her hair. A maid give her a head ma.s.sage and she promptly fell asleep.As Xiao Yao was sleeping soundly, she had no idea that a group of youth were discussing her in Qi Qing Garden.Xing Yue and Yi Yang grabbed Zhuan Xu and wheedled \u201cCall your cousin out. We want to meet her.\u201dFeng Long and the rest of the sons of powerful families said nothing but also stared at Zhuan Xu. He sighed \u201cShe has a very strange personality. I doubt she\u2019ll be willing to come out.\u201dA guy piped up \u201cWe know she\u2019s got a temper otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be asking you.Xing Yue said to Zhuan Xu \u201cAren\u2019t we all friends? Later if people ask if we are friends and if we met your cousin, are we to say we know her but she\u2019s never met us?\u201dWith all the begging, Zhuan Xu had no choice and turned to Jing \u201cHelp me.\u201dThe normally silent Jing spoke up \u201cYou guys stop putting Zhuan Xu in a difficult position.\u201dFeng Long immediately smiled \u201cYes, you guys stop bugging Zhuan Xu. There are plenty of opportunities in the future to make her acquaintance.\u201dEveryone piped down and thus dispersed to look for things to do. Zhuan Xu turned to thank Jing when suddenly Jing said \u201cI want to see Xiao Yao.\u201dThe expression in Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes changed and he was silent for a moment before smiling \u201cI can only pa.s.s word for you. She decides whether or not to see you.\u201dJing said \u201cThank you. Please tell her that I will be waiting for her at the base of the mountain outside the dragon bone prison.\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t understand \u201cThat is secluded enough but not exactly a good place to go meet a girl.\u201dJIng bowed \u201cIf you please\u201d and then turned and disappeared from the banquet.Zhuan Xu had a servant deliver the news that 's.h.i.+ Qi is waiting for you outside the dragon bone prison\u201d. Xiao Yao felt happiness mixed with nervousness, it was a feeling she couldn\u2019t fully understand.She finished her meal, washed up, and then casually ordered the maids \u201cI want to change to go meet a guest. Pick me a pretty outfit.\u201dIt was the first time the maids heard the Princess ask to dress up nicely and they all perked up in excitement and pulled out all sorts of pretty outfits for the Princess to choose from.The maids conferred and decided on three to pick from. Xiao Yao wanted one that didn\u2019t have a cinched waist and was told she would look like she was pregnant under the moonlight.Another maid said \u201cPrincess, we can\u2019t wear these outfits even if we wanted because our waist isn\u2019t small enough, legs aren\u2019t long enough, top isn\u2019t pretty enough. You look so pretty in it, why don\u2019t you wear it?\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cI really look nice in it?\u201dAll of the maids nodded in unison and Xiao Yao thought about how this was her first time meeting Jing as a girl and decided to go with pretty over comfortable.Xiao Yao picked a white and green robe and the maids did her hair with a bell hair pin so it whistled as she walked. She took a few steps and felt tired but the maids were gasping in joy and clapping \u201cPrincess, go see the person now. We promise he will never ever be able to forget you.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was burning \u201cWhat are you guys talking about? I\u2019m just going to see a regular friend.\u201dAll of the maids controlled their smiles \u2013 yup, just a friend, a regular friend who was so regular that the Princess would spend all that time dressing herself up.Xiao Yao took the cloud carriage down the mountain and got off to walk the rest of the way. It was a full moon out and Xiao Yao slowly walked until she could hear the sound of the waves cras.h.i.+ng against the cliff.She saw a man standing on the rocks, he was facing the ocean and quietly waiting. It was unclear how long he waited, it was unclear how much longer he\u2019ll continue to wait.The person waiting for her was Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.Xiao Yao felt all her frustration slowly disappear until all that was left was joy and nervousness.Xiao Yao walked quietly towards him.At the ceremony, Ah Nian was so excited to see Xiao Yao make a fool of herself, but who could have expected that Xiao Yao would end up wearing an outfit that was even more exquisite than the one she destroyed. She ended up being the center of attention of the entire vast wilderness.Ah Nian almost rushed out and trashed Xiao Yao\u2019s outfit then and there, destroying Xiao Yao and destroying herself. But her mom tightly held onto her hand, her eyes filled with despair and entreaty. Ah Nian would misbehave towards anyone except her mom. So Ah Nian could only close her eyes and endure until the ceremony was over.She escorted her mom back to her residence but couldn\u2019t stay in the Palace any longer. Since Xiao Yao returned, the Palace no longer felt like her own home.Ah Nian rode her swallow winged ride and left he Palace. She didn\u2019t know what she wanted to do, she just wanted to escape for now and not hear the celebration that was for Xiao Yao.The swallow flew aimlessly and Ah Nian was tired so she had it stop in a little island in the middle of the ocean. It was the size of a s.h.i.+p and Ah Nian sat down on a jutting rock and watched the ocean churning around her. The noise it made was like a beast bellowing, and normally she would be afraid, but tonight she wasn\u2019t afraid. She even felt it would be best if a beast came and hurt her. Her dad and older brother had Xiao Yao now and they no longer cared about her. When she was injured and near dying and they found her, they would come to regret it but would be too late! Ah Nian thought about how sad her dad and older brother would be if they lost her, and she felt some comfort in that.Another wave crested towards her and riding on the wave was a man in white with white hair, wearing a silver mask. He was smiling at Ah Nian and gently said \u201cIt hurt a lot? Your father and older brother have abandoned you?\u201dAh Nian recognized him \u2013 he was Nine-lives Xiang Liu who kidnapped her once with Xiao Liu. Perhaps it was because Xiao Liu was the one who did all the mean things to her that time, so Ah Nian\u2019s impression of Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t bad. She was nervous now but not afraid of him.Ah Nian asked \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cWhat do you think? The entire vast wilderness is discussing the Gao Xing Eldest Princess. Naturally I got curious so came to check out the festivities.\u201dXiao Yao again! It was still Xiao Yao! Ah Nian loudly harrumphed.Xiang Liu smiled \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t around, you are still Gao Xing\u2019s one and only Princess, your dad\u2019s only daughter, your older brother\u2019s only sister. But she randomly showed up and took everything from you. Don\u2019t you want to seek revenge on her?\u201dAh Nian bit her lips and said nothing. She knew not to make any deals with Xiang Liu, her Gege called him a demon devil, but\u2026\u2026there was no such thing as a deal that couldn\u2019t be made in this world, it was only that there was not enough enticement.Ah Nian struggled \u201cI hate her, but I don\u2019t want her dead. I just want things to go back to the way it used to be.\u201dXiang Liu gently said \u201cI confess I might kill Xuan Yuan\u2019s Prince, but I will never kill Gao Xing\u2019s Princess. We Sheng Nong resistance army would never want to get on the Grand Emperor\u2019s bad side.\u201dAh Nian knew that which is why she wasn\u2019t scared of him.Xiang Liu looked at Ah Nian and gently suggested \u201cYou want to torment her a bit but not kill her, is that right?\u201dAh Nian slowly nodded her head.Xiang Liu laughed \u201cYou are a kind girl, your dad and older brother ought to love you more.\u201dAh Nian felt like this was the first true words she heard in a long time so asked \u201cHow to give her a good bout of thras.h.i.+ng?\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cAll you need to do is lure her out and not be detected. I\u2019ll handle the rest.\u201dAh Nian asked \u201cWhy are you helping me? What do you want me to do for you?\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cYou are the Gao Xing Princess and want for nothing. It\u2019s rare that I can do something for you and I\u2019m happy to. You know the position of the Sheng Nong resistance army. If in the future the situation arises, I would ask that Princess to help me once in return.\u201dAh Nian smiled \u201cYou don\u2019t even want me to promise, aren\u2019t you afraid I will renege?\u201dXiang Liu solemnly and gently said \u201cI trust you.\u201dAh Nian smiled sweetly \u201cFine! If you teach her a lesson, I will do one thing for you in the future.\u201dXiang Liu handed a clam sh.e.l.l to Ah Nian \u201cLure her to the ocean and then smash this. I will be there.\u201d Ah Nian put the sh.e.l.l away and rode her swallow back.Xiao Yao happily looked at the man standing on the rocks and walked towards him. Suddenly a rock struck her back and she turned to see Ah Nian standing in the distance waving at her to go over. Xiao Yao walked towards Ah Nian when she suddenly turned and ran off.Xiao Yao furrowed her brows and looked back at the cliff side, and then followed where Ah Nian disappeared to.Ah Nian\u2019s form flitted in and out of the forest and Xiao Yao knew she was trying to play with her so she went along to see what Ah Nian had up her sleeve. They emerged from the forest to the other side of the mountain and Ah Nian beckoned Xiao Yao to the edge of the cliff.Xiao Yao slowly walked over \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dAh Nian looked at her and her expression was conflicted. Xiao Yao also looked at Ah Nian and couldn\u2019t figure out what she wanted to do. Even if she pushed her off the cliff, she wouldn\u2019t die.Ah Nian smashed a clam sh.e.l.l and then rushed Xiao Yao who sighed \u201cYou really want to push me off the cliff?\u201d She wanted to duck but Ah Nian used an ice sword to block Xiao Yao\u2019s escape.Ah Nian said \u201cYou guessed right!\u201dXiao Yao could kill Ah Nian if she wanted, but she couldn\u2019t beat Ah Nian in a fight. Suddenly Xiao Yao felt a power strike her back and her body flew over the cliff.Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t scared, she had been cliff diving since she was young and she actually quite enjoyed this free fall before entering the ocean.The wind blew her hair around her and her robe billowed out so she looked like a falling b.u.t.terfly with green wings flying towards the ocean.Xiao Yao stretched out her body and squinted her eyes, when suddenly her eyes opened wide \u2013 under the moonlight, in the dark blue ripples of the ocean, a white haired white robed man was laying on the waves. He had a slight smile as he looked up at her, as if enjoying a dance that was for his eyes only.Xiao Yao wanted to escape but she was in the middle of falling and her only way was down. She could only watch as she got closer and closer to him, closer and closer, until she thought she would fall right on top of Xiang Liu. At that moment he sank into the ocean and she entered the water. He grabbed her hand and pulled her down with him.He held her under water but Xiao Yao knew he wouldn\u2019t kill her but only wanted to torment her so she endured it.When the final breath was almost gone, Xiao Yao grabbed his hands and pleaded with him but he ignored her and kept swimming underwater. Xiao Yao felt her entire chest was about to explode and her hands no longer had any strength. She let go and Xiang Liu grabbed her around the waist with a smile and pointed to his lips indicating that if she wanted fresh air, she was going to have to get it herself.Xiao Yao shook her head. In the past, she was Wen Xiao Liu, she never saw herself as a woman. But now, no matter what happened, she couldn\u2019t do it.Xiang Liu\u2019s smile disappeared and he embraced Xiao Yao and continued to sink deeper.He stared at Xiao Yao, and Xiao Yao stared at him.Xiang Liu was descending faster and Xiao Yao realized that faced with a Nine-headed demon who didn\u2019t give a s.h.i.+t about anything, her ident.i.ty as the Gao Xing Princess couldn\u2019t protect her.Xiang Liu was sinking even faster and the soft water was filled with such pressure it made Xiao Yao feel like it would rip her to pieces. Her chest was about to explode and her entire body hurt.Life and death \u2013 it was one simple choice.Their faces were so close, so close their noses were almost touching. All Xiao Yao needed to do was move forward an inch and she would be pressing to his lips.But\u2026she couldn\u2019t!Xiao Yao felt all the water rus.h.i.+ng into her head. His lips were so close, so close\u2026..and then Xiao Yao lost consciousness and fainted.Xiang Liu jerked her head forward to his lips and then rocketed to the surface with her.The two of them broke the surface.Xiang Liu sat crossed legged on the surface and pulled up the unconscious Xiao Yao and placed her on his leg. His summoned power to his palms and patted her a few times on the back. Xiao Yao coughed and spit out mouthfuls of water. She was gradually regaining consciousness though her entire body as weak and sore and her head was heavy. She couldn\u2019t move so so closed her eyes and rested wearily on Xiang Liu\u2019s lap.After resting for a good while, Xiao Yao finally was able to think straight and she pressed down on Xiang Liu\u2019s leg to help her sit up. Likely Xiang Liu\u2019s power was forming a solid surface so the waves underneath her felt like a soft cus.h.i.+on, making her movements wobbly but she didn\u2019t sink.Xiang Liu was expressionless and just staring at her. He said nothing so Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know what to say either.They were in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by endless darkness, as if the entire world was just the two of them left.Xiao Yao finally spoke \u201cI was planning to pretend I didn\u2019t know you when I saw you again.\u201d\u201cI still have the voodoo bug in my body, are you trying to welsh on your promise?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt ought to be that only I can sense you, but you can\u2019t sense me. How did you know I was Wen Xiao Liu?\u201dXiang Liu raised his hand and pulled Xiao Yao\u2019s hair back from her face, holding her head in his hand and carefully taking in her face \u201cThis is your true form?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a great liar.\u201dXiao Yao wanted to explain \u201cIt\u2019s not lying, I really thought I was Wen Xiao Liu.\u201d\u201cThe Princess of Gao Xing?\u201d Xiang Liu laughed coldly \u201cNo wonder you would die to save Zhuan Xu.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t dare say anything more.Xiang Liu\u2019s hand seemed to casually rest on her shoulder and his finger pa.s.sed by her neck and he softly said \u201cWhat else have you lied about? Why don\u2019t you come clean all together today. I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\u201cI told you before, I only bulls.h.i.+t but I never say anything fake. I like to talk because I\u2019m afraid of being lonely. If I\u2019m full of lies, then the more I talk the lonelier I\u2019ll get.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s sharp finger retracted in that moment and Xiao Yao never knew how close she was to death.Xiang Liu silently stared out at the pitch black sky, unclear what was on his mind, but his entire body was like the edge of the sharpest sword blade, so sharp that no one could get close.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know why \u2013 she was floating on the surface but she felt like she was sinking into the depths. Her heart ached with this pressure when she looked at him like this, and then she suddenly thought of something and pulled out a wet satchel and took out a small jade bottle. She dumped out colorful pills and showed it to Xiang Liu \u201cWant to try?\u201dXiang Liu ate it like he was eating candy, slowly eating it one by one.\u201cHow is it? I made this specifically for you, reading all sorts of manuals, and gathering all sorts of rare ingredients.\u201dThe thrumming intensity in Xiang Liu diminished and he said \u201cIt\u2019s pa.s.sable.\u201d\u201cPa.s.sable?\u201d Xiao Yao was almost in tears \u201cSo many ingredients came from the most hard to reach places and takes thousands of years to grow.\u201dXiang Liu coolly asked \u201cYou still want to poison me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m one of the foremost poison masters of this generation, I can even poison a Nine-tailed fox, there is no reason I can\u2019t poison you Nine-headed demon!\u201dXiang Liu smirked \u201cI\u2019ll wait for it.\u201dXiao Yao felt the mood between them was no longer as intense and dangerous as before so carefully asked \u201cHow did you get mixed up with Ah Nian?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201dXiao Yao grabbed his sleeve and sternly said \u201cNo! You can\u2019t go mess with her again. She\u2019s been so well protected by my dad, she can\u2019t handle being mentally screwed with by someone like you.\u201dXiang Liu leaned forward and laughed \u201cA person like me? What kind of person am I?\u201dXiao Yao rolled her eyes at him \u201cYou totally know.\u201dXiang Liu casually said \u201cShe doesn\u2019t see you as an older sister and you\u2019re already rus.h.i.+ng to be a good older sister.\u201d\u201cThe relations.h.i.+ps between people, one person always needs to make the first move. Men and women, and even parents to children. Before a child is aware, the parents are already giving. I\u2019ve always been selfish and never want to make the first move. But between Ah Nian and I, I\u2019ve decided to make the first move not because she\u2019s worth it, but because of my dad and Zhuan Xu. I\u2019m willing to do it for my dad and Zhuan Xu.\u201d\u201cNot every sacrifice will get a reciprocal response. She can sell you out to me, that means she can sell you out to someone else. She can push you off a cliff today, next time she may plunge a dagger into your chest.\u201d\u201cI know, which is why I\u2019m only going to do this once.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cI promise I\u2019ll stop messing with your sister for fun, but you\u2019ll have to promise me one thing.\u201d\u201cCan I say no?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dXiao Yao looked at him all docilely waiting for him to speak.Xiang Liu said \u201cContinue making poisons for me.\u201dThis was so easy Xiao Yao immediately agreed \u201cBut\u2026but\u2026how can I hand it to you? I\u2019m not in Qing Shui Town anymore, and you can\u2019t come to the mountain top to find me.\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cThis is your problem to figure out. If a prolonged period of time pa.s.ses and I don\u2019t see a new batch of poisons, I\u2019ll go looking for your sister.\u201dXiao Yao pouted \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t forgive me for lying this easily.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cI\u2019ve already forgiven you.\u201dXiao Yao continued pouting and Xiang Liu coldly humphed, and then he suddenly asked \u201cWhy?\u201dXiao Yao knew exactly what he was asking \u2013 why did she refuse to kiss him and would rather die. She pretended to be clueless \u201cWhy what?\u201dXiang Liu grabbed her arm and they started sinking so Xiao Yao yelped \u201cOh, I remember, I remember!\u201dXiang Liu stared at her and Xiao Yao \u201cBecause I\u2019m scared.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s scarier than death?\u201dXiao Liu thought about it and finally put it into words \u201cMy Gege, that is Zhuan Xu, he said one night when we were talking that I was still a girl who dreams. So\u2026.so\u2026.I\u2019m scared that if I\u2019m not careful, you\u2019ll walk into my dreams. And you\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao shook her head \u201cYou\u2019re someone who is never ever suitable to show up in a young girl\u2019s dreams. That might actually be scarier than death.\u201dXiang Liu started chuckling, and it grew louder and louder until he was laughing. He released Xiao Yao and his body drifted away.Xiao Yao yelled \u201cHey\u2026hey\u2026.don\u2019t leave me here. If you leave me here, what\u2019ll I do?\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cSwim back!\u201dXiao Yao was in disbelief \u201cYou want me to swim back from here? This is the deep ocean and sea monsters are around. I\u2019ve got very weak powers, any random sea monster can eat me!\u201dXiang Liu smiled with a twinkle in his eye \u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good. If I\u2019m too tender and considerate with you, I might accidentally enter your dreams and leave you wis.h.i.+ng for death. That would be a crime on my part.\u201dXiang Liu finished talking and sank into the ocean and disappeared.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t believe it and yelled \u201cXiang Liu, Xiang Liu, Nine-lives! Nine-headed demon! Devil b.a.s.t.a.r.d! You d.a.m.n Nine-headed demon b.a.s.t.a.r.d\u2026..\u201dThe waves ripped around her and the sea was desolate. Xiao Yao felt the ocean grew darker and looked around to gather her bearings and started swimming towards Five G.o.ds Mountain.Initially she was scared a sea monster would come and bite her but after swimming for along time and still not seeing land, she was scared she would drown. She conserved her energy and stopped thinking and just started swimming as if she was in a trance and her body was moving in a steady rhythm.Initially she felt tired but gradually it all disappeared \u2013 the sky was not the sky and the sea was not the sea. She couldn\u2019t feel her own existence and was swimming based on her natural instinct for survival. Swimming like she was letting everything all go and just moving forward, forever moving forward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is a very Jing-Xiao Yao centric chapter of Lost You Forever after a very Xiang Liu heavy last chapter. The male leads page time alternates a lot in this novel and all of this will continue to fuel the s.h.i.+pping wars and mess with Xiao Yao\u2019s heart. Thankfully she\u2019s really not a girly girl even if she does blush and sometimes gives into her girly side. What I mean with her not being really girly deep down inside is that she\u2019s completely lost the sense of optimism. One reason she was so good to the prost.i.tute Xan Tian Er was because Xiao Yao has also seen all the ugly and the painful aspects of life and no longer believes in rainbows and unicorns and happily ever afters. She just wants an okay boring simple life, and that is enough to make her happy. Jing wants the exact same thing so I\u2019m glad they have found each other and made a promise to try and be together. Jing is really such a sweetheart but so so dense sometimes and that denseness frustrates Xiao Yao and her reactions are super adorable. LOL, I can see Xiao Yao running circles around him but him letting her and them enjoying a lifetime like that together. Jing really sees Xiao Yao as his one and only, whereas we don\u2019t know what Xiang Liu thinks (yet) and Zhuan Xu definitely has a destiny to fulfill that takes precedence over romance. If the story ended right now with Jing breaking off his engagement, then he\u2019s the right guy for her and the two of them would be little precious puppies living the most ordinary yet meaningful life together. I can live with that, but sadly the characters don\u2019t have the luxury of that type of fast escape ending. More adventure is awaiting all of them, so with that in mind I\u2019m pleased a few of my darlings gets to steal some happy time together.Chapter 14 \u2013 This Feeling Has No Strategy to Remove:Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know how much time had pa.s.sed when she finally touched something solid. She grabbed onto it tightly and opened her eyes. It was a rock and her entire body collapsed on the rock. She could see in the distance a dark figure standing alone on another rock.The sun was rising and the dawn was cold and misty. The figure seemed to blend into the rock, standing in the distance, appearing to wait forever more.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know if she was too tired, or happy, but her voice was gone and she couldn\u2019t call out. She weakly raised her hand to wave but nothing moved. Finally the figure saw her and didn\u2019t even bother to walk along the sh.o.r.eline and instead dove into the ocean and swam to Xiao Yao. Jing held her up and the two of them were treading water. Xiao Yao was so exhausted she was s.h.i.+vering, and for whatever reason, Jing was also s.h.i.+vering.Xiao Yao said \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026.don\u2019t\u2026.in the water.\u201d After a night in the water, she didn\u2019t want to be here anymore.Jing carried her on sh.o.r.e but after taking a few steps his foot slipped and he fell back. He was afraid she would be hurt so turned to land on his back with a loud thud.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cYou\u2026..you\u2026\u2026nine\u2026.fox\u2026..stupid\u2026..\u201dThey finally reached sh.o.r.e and Jing carried Xiao Yao to rest under a cliff outcropping. Xiao Yao\u2019s face was white and her lips were black with cold. Jing put one hand on her back and the other on her palm and transferred power into her. Gradually it moved through her body and she stopped s.h.i.+vering.It was bright sun outside by now but under the outcropping they were in the shade.Jing saw that Xiao Yao was warm and took back the hand that was on her back, and was going to release the hand on her palm. But he didn\u2019t bear to so his hand released and then tightened. Xiao Yao teased him \u201cYou were much bolder back then, when did you lose your courage?\u201dJing released her hand \u201cNow is not the same as before.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201dJing looked at her and then swiftly lowered his eyes.Xiao Yao touched her wild and wet hair and the patted her cheeks. Her face was likely no better off and equally a mess. She decided when she got back she was going to teach that Ah Nian a d.a.m.n painful lesson. Xiao Yao stood up \u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201dJing hurriedly stood up and grabbed her arm, but then released it like he was shocked by electricity, his face blus.h.i.+ng red. Gao Xing\u2019s clothes were light and airy, so after it got wet the robe was plastered to Xiao Yao. It wasn\u2019t as noticeable earlier since she was sitting down, but now that she stood up, from her trim waist to her full bosom, it was all on display.Xiao Yao noticed Jing\u2019s expression and glanced down at herself before immediately squatting into a ball and wrapping her arms around her knees.Jing sat down across from her and said softly \u201cCan you stay for a bit before going back? Just a little bit.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing.\u201cI waited for you all night and thought you weren\u2019t coming.\u201dXiao Yao said angrily \u201cIf you thought I wasn\u2019t coming, then why keep waiting?\u201dJing didn\u2019t know how to answer. If she didn\u2019t come, then he didn\u2019t know where else to go. In this dark deep place, he once experienced the sweetest happiness, but the one who gave him the happiness was Xiao Liu. It wasn\u2019t this girl before him now. If she took back her promise, he would completely understand.Xiao Yao got on her knees and faced him, her eyes reflecting her anger \u201cDo you think waiting all night was hard? You have a fiancee! You step out with her all the time together, and then you find any opportunity to remind me of my promise to you. If you don\u2019t trust me, then why ask me to promise? Let me tell you, last night I tried to keep the promise and almost died!\u201dXiao Yao shoved Jing hard \u201cI don\u2019t want to play anymore. I take back my promise! You scram back to Qing Qiu and go marry Fang Feng Yi Yang!\u201dJing didn\u2019t dare do anything back to her but he also didn\u2019t budge \u201cI won\u2019t marry her. She doesn\u2019t like me so she likely doesn\u2019t want to marry me either.\u201dXiao Yao stopped shoving \u201cI don\u2019t believe it! Why reason does she have to not like you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a cripple and I can tell she\u2019s shocked and dismayed. One time she saw the scars on my body and was shocked\u2026..\u201d To say 'shocked\u201d was an understatement, Yi Yang\u2019s face was stark white and she was petrified, not daring to look at him in that moment. Since then, when they were alone together, she would purposely keep her distance from him.Xiao Yao felt terrible, she knew Jing had a crippled leg and his scars were truly scary, but that shouldn\u2019t be a reason to dislike him. Xiao Yao said \u201cYou guys have been engaged for tens of years, shouldn\u2019t she not care about such external trappings?\u201d\u201cIn truth, before I saw her in Qing Shui Town, I didn\u2019t even know what she looked like. We never met before and she was chosen by my mother. By then my mother was very sick and I didn\u2019t want her to fret over my marriage so I agreed immediately. I took care of my mother and ran the businesses so I was so busy I didn\u2019t care much about this. It was my brother who went off to meet her and came back with a smile and told me \u201ccongrats, she\u2019s beautiful and smart\u201d. After mother died, I had to take care of my despondent brother so was in no mood for romance. After my grandmother revealed my brother\u2019s birth, I was even less inclined to think about this. Then my grandmother wanted to set the wedding date and that was when I remembered I had a fiancee. My grandmother is elderly and my sister-in-law is of no use so the Tu Shan clan needs a lady of the house to help my grandmother with her worries. After my grandmother discussed with the clan elders, they set a wedding date but before it arrived, I was already captured by my brother.\u201dSo Qing Shui Town was their first meeting, no wonder Fang Feng Yi Yang was disappointed\u2026..Xiao Yao\u2019s feelings were so conflicted, she felt angry and upset, but also somewhat happy. She really didn\u2019t know what she was thinking.After a moment, Xiao Yao said coolly \u201cMiss Fang Feng is definitely very beautiful and she\u2019s quite capable. If she\u2019s got high standards that\u2019s normal, don\u2019t feel too bad about it.\u201d\u201cYou. Are the most beautiful.\u201d Jing said that and then lowered his head.\u201cEven now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Yao burst out laughing \u201cNow I know why the young girls are putty in Zhuan Xu\u2019s hands with his honeyed words. Even though I know you\u2019re not telling the truth, I still like hearing it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth, Xiao Yao. I never imagined you would look like this. If I had known you were like this\u2026..even in the dark prison I would have never dared to reveal my greatest wish\u2026.\u201d Jing\u2019s back was straight but his head was still lowered, like a tree growing in darkness. \u201cMy body, my voice\u2026.do you know why I never got my crippled leg healed even knowing I can? Because I know that even when I\u2019m healed, the real injury is inside that no medicine can heal. I can wear clothes to cover up my hideous scars, I can use rare medicine to cure my crippled leg, I can talk less to conceal my voice, I can lie to everyone that I can still the das.h.i.+ng Young Master of Qing Qiu, but I can\u2019t lie to myself\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao, I\u2019m not good enough for you! This time, there will be many handsome, smart, physically whole young men\u2026..\u201d\u201cJing, raise your head! Tu Shan Jing, raise you head.\u201dJing slowly raised his head and Xiao Yao put her face right in front of his and murmured \u201cLast night, a man forced me to kiss him, but right now all I want to do is kiss you.\u201d Her lips softly landed on his lips and Jing\u2019s body shook and he darted backwards \u201cNo\u2026.Xiao Yao.\u201dXiao Yao closed her eyes and raised her face, her cheeks bright red as her body softly s.h.i.+vered \u201cJing\u2026..Jing\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s soft voice was so low he almost could hear what she was saying, but Jing was shaking as his lips touched the peach blossom birthmark on her forehead and it felt like a fire burned from Xiao Yao straight to his head. His cold heart warned up, with the hope that one day those scars concealed deep within his heart would also heal.Jing tightly embraced Xiao Yao and buried his face in her neck, this joy like a dream where he just wanted to hold Xiao Yao forever and never let go.Xiao Yao murmured \u201cYou\u2019re suffocating me.\u201dJing immediately released her with his face bright red. Xiao Yao chuckled and rested her head on his arm and looked at him. Jing was embarra.s.sed so turned his head slightly \u201cYou said just now that you almost died last night, and also said\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao waved her hand casually \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense, I just said it to scare you.\u201dJing looked at Xiao Yao with doubt in his eyes, but he knew she didn\u2019t want to discuss it anymore.Xiao Yao laughed and pointed to her lips \u201cWhy not here?\u201dJing said in a low voice \u201cNow\u2019s not the time yet.\u201d\u201cWhat time then\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao lowered her eyes and used her hands to cover her face and her embarra.s.sment.Jing couldn\u2019t answer because the choice was with Xiao Yao and not with him. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t desire her, but what he wanted was her love. He didn\u2019t want her pity and care for him, she already gave him too much, he didn\u2019t want to continue using her kindess.Xiao Yao peeked at him through her fingers \u201cI thought you men when you see a girl all want to push her down on the pallet and rip their clothes off\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t continue, ever since she returned to being a girl, she couldn\u2019t be as shameless as Xiao Liu anymore. Especially now, she was dying to take what she just said back.Jing may have been very proper, but he was still the clan leader and would often go to places of pleasure to discuss business. Plus the scions of the powerful families were all experienced in the male-female relations, and Jing as a man clearly knew enough. In discussing business, he saw more and heard more explicit things then this and was always just fine with it. But facing Xiao Yao, he felt this fire burning through him and he tried to explain \u201cI am not like that.\u201dThe two were silent, their shyness conveyed in their awkwardness, mixed with the tender stirrings of happiness.\u201cXiao Yao\u2026..Xiao Yao\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice reached them.The two jumped apart like thieves caught in the act, with Xiao Yao making a shus.h.i.+ng gesture for Jing to go hide. Xiao Yao smoothed her hair and walked over to a rock to wave at Zhuan Xu \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201dZhuan Xu ran over \u201cHow come you look so utterly pathetic?\u201d He immediately took off his outer robe and wrapped her up in it.Xiao Yao said \u201cHow did I end up looking so pathetic? It\u2019s your little sister, I\u2019m going to deal with Ah Nian when I get back.\u201dZhuan Xu summoned a cloud carriage and helped Xiao Yao inside \u201cI thought you were going to keep on enduring.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at the rocks and got in \u201cIf I don\u2019t teach her a lesson, I\u2019m worried the next thing she does will make you and daddy heartbroken.\u201d\u201cWhat did she do?\u201dXiao Yao smiled mysteriously \u201cThat\u2019s between us sisters and you don\u2019t need to get involved.\u201d If Zhuan Xu knew that Ah Nian worked with Xiang Liu to scheme against her, he would literally blow a gasket on her.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cDid you see Jing?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cWhat did you two\u2026.talk about?\u201d\u201cWe just chatted, he said a bit about him and Fang Feng Yi Yang\u2026and other stuff.\u201dZhuan Xu asked in half seriousness half casual laughter \u201cJust chatting and you spent the entire night out of the Palace?\u201dXiao Yao huffed back in righteousness \u201cDo I look like someone who happily played all night? If it wasn\u2019t for your good little sister, I would have long been back to the Palace and sleeping.\u201dZhuan Xu picked up her hair and saw seaweed and sand in it and shook his head with a smile \u201cYou definitely look like you got worked over. You finally got taken advantage of by Ah Nian, and you really need to stop calling her my little sister. Based on family, she\u2019s your little sister!\u201dXiao Yao scrunched her face up and then suddenly remembered something and asked \u201cThat Tu Shan Hou, what do you think about him?\u2019\u201cNot bad.\u201dXiao Yao appeared curious so Zhuan Xu went into more detail \u201cHe\u2019s very talented and compared to Jing he has even more commanding aura. During the years Jing went missing, he handled all the Tu Shan clan affairs and did a good job. Once Jing came back, he had to step aside. I find it strange since they are twins and Hou is the older one, and he\u2019s talented in a way equal to Jing, he ought to be the clan leader. But the clan favors Jing and even Feng Long\u2019s group doesn\u2019t seem to take Hou seriously. Especially Feng Long, who is always polite to Hou, but it feels fake compared to his att.i.tude towards Jing. In the powerful families, you can tell the importance of a person based on how the others treat him. Hou has been accepted because of his Tu Shan last name but it\u2019s clear Feng Long doesn\u2019t truly see him as an equal. But I have a feeling Hou isn\u2019t content to be number 2, he\u2019s just biding his time and I can see the ambition in his eyes.\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cLooks like you have a good impression of him.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed in mockery \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s a lot like me, we are both waiting patiently for the right time to take the opponent out. We also want to prove ourselves to others.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s expression turned grim but Zhuan Xu quickly said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if Jing wasn\u2019t so capable the Feng Long won\u2019t respect him this much. If Jing wanted to, he could easily strike first and take out Hou. But I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking by not doing anything.\u201dZhuan Xu patted her shoulder \u201cSeeing that you saved Jing\u2019s life, as long as Jing doesn\u2019t p.i.s.s you off, then I\u2019ll keep an eye on Hou. But I have my suspicion\u2026..that Hou is in cahoots with our royal uncle.\u201dXiao Yao relaxed \u201cIs the Fang Feng family also in royal uncle\u2019s pocket?\u201d\u201cSeeing Fang Feng Yi Yang\u2019s actions, probably yes. Otherwise she would not dare to try and a.s.sa.s.sinate me time and again. The only ones who want me dead desperately are our elder relatives, yes?\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cI\u2019m so impressed, all you guys looking to take each other out, you can all hang out in laughter and spend time together.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is a form of entertainment?\u201dXiao Yao laughed out loud \u201cDefinitely!\u201dThe cloud carriage stopped and Xiao Yao jumped off and called to a maid \u201cFind me a tattered outfit.\u201dThe maid ran in and brought out an outfit that Ah Nian ruined. Xiao Yao handed Zhuan Xu\u2019s robe back, put on the outfit, and walked off.Zhuan Xu called out \u201cDon\u2019t you want to change before going to deal with Ah Nian?\u201dXiao Yao turned around and flipped her seaweed and sand encrusted hair \u201cI want this imposing presence!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cThen I\u2019m not going to get involved, I\u2019ll go find Feng Long and Xing Yue since they are leaving tomorrow.\u201dXiao Yao waved \u201cYou go find your fun, I\u2019m going to find my fun.\u201dXiao Yao kicked open the door to Ah Nian\u2019s residence and walked in. Clearly last night Ah Nian was worried about what she had done and didn\u2019t sleep well and she immediately stood up.The maids came to stop her \u201cEldest Princess, the Second Princess hasn\u2019t risen yet. If you have something\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao shoved them all aside and then faced Hai Tang blocking her way \u201cWhat? Are you going to fight with me?\u201dHai Tang kneeled down \u201cYou servant I wouldn\u2019t dare\u201d but she didn\u2019t move aside.Xiao Yao hollered \u201cAh Nian, if you have the guts to do it, then have the guts to admit it! Hiding behind your maids? You\u2019re a pathetic coward!\u201dAh Nian yanked her door open and said to Hai Tang \u201cMove aside, I want to see what she dares do. If she has the guts, then she should kill me today and then I\u2019ll accept her!\u201dThe maids fretted \u201cEldest Princess, Second Princess, you\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao and Ah Nian both yelled simultaneously \u201cScram!\u201dThe maids scurried to the side and Xiao Yao said \u201cIf you have the guts then invite me in to see what I\u2019ll do to you.\u201dAh Nian scoffed and moved aside. Xiao Yao walked in and locked the door and pointed at herself \u201cYou got together with someone else and did this to me. Are you happy now?\u201dAh Nian sat down and poured herself a gla.s.s of water \u201cNot bad.\u201dXiao Yao dumped the entire pitcher of water in her face \u201cYou idiot without a brain!\u201dAh Nian jumped up \u201cYou\u2026.You\u2026..if I don\u2019t beat you half to death today, then I\u2019m not Gao Xing Yi!\u201d She waved her hand and discovered her powers were gone and she couldn\u2019t summon any water or ice.Xiao Yao said \u201cLet\u2019s see you try!\u201dAh Nian picked up a jade stick and tossed it at Xiao Yao, who picked up a zither to block it. The stick broke and Ah Nian picked up a mirror and lobbed it at Xiao Yao and destroyed the zither.Xiao Yao grabbed boxes of make up and threw it at Ah Nian \u201cYou\u2019re like a bull cow, you actually have some arm strength.\u201dXiao Yao jumped onto the table and Ah Nian smashed the entire table. Xiao Yao ducked next to a shelf and grabbed some books to throw at Ah Nian. She blocked with a mirror and then destroyed the entire shelf.Xiao Yao back towards the pallet and Ah Nian pressed close \u201cLet\u2019s see where you can hide now.\u201dAh Nian tossed her mirror at Xiao Yao with all her strength, wanting this person to disappear forever. Xiao Yao jumped up like a monkey and avoided the strike, as she landed she grabbed the veil bed curtains and pulled it over Ah Nian. The curtains were impenetrable by sword or fire so Ah Nian\u2019s struggles only made herself even more tightly bound.Xiao Yao viciously kicked Ah Nian who fell over and her head hit the floor hard, so painful her face turned blue. Xiao Yao sat on Ah Nian \u201cGao Xing Yi, this is you! Once you lose your powers, you can\u2019t do anything! Without your ident.i.ty, you are nothing!\u201dAh Nian started crying \u201cYou think you\u2019re better than me? If your mom wasn\u2019t the Xuan Yuan Princess then Zhuan Xu won\u2019t care about you. If you\u2019re not the granddaughter of the Yellow Emperor, no one will think you\u2019re better than me. Other than your bloodline being more royal than me, there is nothing about you that is better than me. I trained my own powers and it\u2019s stronger than you. You\u2019re the disciple of the Royal Mother but you have barely any powers and can\u2019t even beat a lowly demon. If it wasn\u2019t for all your lofty backgrounds, then daddy wouldn\u2019t have held a lavish ceremony for you. You think everyone showed up for you? No! They came because your dad is the Grand Emperor, your mom was the Xuan Yuan Princess, your grandfather is the Yellow Emperor, and your master is the Royal Mother! Other than those connections, you\u2019re even less capable than me!\u201dSo this was what was bothering Ah Nian, her insecurity. Xiao Yao thought and said \u201cYou are actually insecure that your mother\u2019s birth was too low.\u201dAh Nian screamed like a crazed animal \u201cI\u2019m not! I didn\u2019t! My mom is the best in the entire world, don\u2019t you dare speak of my mom like that\u2026..\u201dAh Nian tried to struggle up but Xiao Yao punched her in the nose and more tears and snot came out but she stopped struggling. Xiao Yao sat on her and said \u201cYou dare to deny it? Aren\u2019t you angry because of your mom? You\u2019re better than me at everything but because your mom was of low birth, and mute and deaf, so you\u2019re not as revered as me. Don\u2019t you think that if the Royal Mother was your master, you would be incredibly powerful. Don\u2019t you think that if the Yellow Emperor was your grandfather, you wouldn\u2019t be as useless as me.\u201dAh Nian cried pitifully and Xiao Yao patted her cheeks \u201cCan you swear you never thought these things before?\u201dAh Nian\u2019s cries grew louder. She never would admit that she blamed her mom but she did think it before. She wasn\u2019t any less capable than Xiao Yao but everyone put her first. Wasn\u2019t it because of Xiao Yao\u2019s mom? If her mom wasn\u2019t the Xuan Yuan Princess, if her mom was of the same low birth as Ah Nian\u2019s mom, then everyone would treat Xiao Yao differently. She wouldn\u2019t be able to influence the entire vast wilderness.Ah Nian was stunned and wondered if she really did think poorly of her own mom.No, no it cannot be. She was so gentle and so sad, she and her dad was all her mom had. She would never look down on her mom\u2019s birth!Xiao Yao hollered \u201cIf you have the guts to think it, then have the guts to admit it. Other than crying, what else can you do?\u201dAh Nian kept crying so Xiao Liu took out some powder and spread it on the veil curtain. The impenetrable curtain actually burned a hole with the powder. She held the powder and said to Ah Nian \u201cIf you keep crying, I\u2019ll blow this on your face.\u201dAh Nian immediately tightly shut her lips and stared in fear at Xiao Yao, but she stopped sobbing out loud despite the tears streaming down her face.Xiao Yao put the powder away \u201cNow this is better for talking! Since I know your secret, I\u2019ll tell you my secret. Your mom\u2019s birth isn\u2019t a big deal, it\u2019s me who hates my mom\u2019s birth. Don\u2019t believe me? Our dad is truly capable and brilliant, all these years and no one ever slipped in front of you. I\u2019ll tell you the secret \u2013 do you know why no one in Five G.o.ds Mountain dares to mention my mom? Because she divorced our dad!:Ah Nian forgot to cry and stared at Xiao Yao. There was a woman in the entire world who discarded the Grand Emperor?\u201cMy mom divorced our dad and took me to Cao Yun Peak at Xuan Yuan Mountain. If that was it, then so be it, but for nation and country, she ran off to lead an army into battle so she stashed me with the Royal Mother at Jade Mountain. She lied that I was going there to play and would pick me up. But\u2026.she left and never came back. She died in battle! That horrible place Jade Mountain is not where a normal person can live. The maids act like they are deaf and mute, if the Royal Mother said ten sentences in a month she was being extra talkative. I prayed daily for my mom to come pick me up and I waited 70 years\u2026.but she\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao laughed coldly.Xiao Yao leaned down and sincerely said to Ah Nian \u201cHonestly, if the Heavens let me pick a mom, I want yours. She\u2019s gentle and loving, very understanding of her place in life as she sees our dad as her entire world and follows him to the ends of the world. She may be a weak woman who can\u2019t do anything, can\u2019t talk about grand and powerful goals, but she can be with her daughter as she grows up. No matter when, if you miss her, she\u2019s right there waiting for you. Even if the entire world abandoned you, she would still be by your side.\u201dAh Nian was in a daze and Xiao Yao patted her cheek \u201cWant to change moms with me?\u201dAh Nian screamed \u201cNo! Never! My mom is mine!\u201d as if Xiao Yao was going to steal her mom away.Xiao Yao got off her and released her from the veil curtain \u201cNo matter if you want to or not, I\u2019m part of your world. So going forward you have two paths to choose from.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t fully release Ah Nian and just let her head out. She poked Ah Nian hard to make her sit up \u201cThe first path is this path, we don\u2019t get along and you keep trying to hurt me, even getting help from others to do it. Do you know what the result of this path is?\u201dAh Nian said nothing so Xiao Yao said \u201cYou\u2019ll make our dad devastated, and you\u2019ll lose Zhuan Xu.\u201dAh Nian glared at Xiao Yao as Xiao Yao continued \u201cTo our dad, you and I are like his palm and the back of his hand. It\u2019s both his flesh, and whether you or I hurt more, he will hurt equally. If he hurts, then your mother\u2019s entire world will hurt as well. If your parents both hurt, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be happy! As for Zhuan Xu, you refuse to admit it but you know the reality. I\u2019m not going to shy away from being blunt \u2013 Zhuan Xu and I are blood relatives. In danger, we are each other\u2019s support, and in fact we are each other\u2019s only support in this entire world. If you really hurt me, Zhuan Xu will never forgive you!\u201dXiao Yao added \u201cThe second road is very different \u2013 we exist peacefully. Stop glaring at me, I said peacefully not lovingly! Peacefully means we don\u2019t bother each other, the Palace is so large and we can avoid each other easily. Think about this road \u2013 dad will be relieved and Zhuan Xu will still be very caring towards you, and your mom can live in peace.\u201dAh Nian coldly scoffed \u201cJust two paths?\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThere is a third one \u2013 we love each other and get along well. From then on, you don\u2019t just have a dad and older brother who love you, you also have an older sister that dotes on you as well.\u201d\u201cHa! Dream on!\u201dXiao Yao shrugged \u201cI know it\u2019s a dream which is why I didn\u2019t even bother to mention it.\u201dAh Nian lowered her head and contemplated so Xiao Yao didn\u2019t push her anymore.It was quiet inside so the noises from outside got loud all of a sudden. The maids were sobbing and pleading \u201cPrincesses, please stop fighting! We beg of you\u2026.. Wasn\u2019t His majesty told about this, why hasn\u2019t he sent someone here yet?\u201dAfter a few moments, Xiao Yao saw Ah Nian had calmed down and released her upper body from the veil curtain. Ah Nian immediately slapped Xiao Yao across the face and Xiao Yao pushed her back down on the ground hard and raised her fist \u201cYou want to keep fighting? Then let\u2019s continue!\u201dAh Nian raged \u201cYou kicked me in the stomach and punched me in the face. I slapped you back, now we\u2019re even. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cFine!\u201dXiao Yao stood up and headed for the door \u201cWhat you did with Xiang Liu, only you and I know. I won\u2019t tell Zhuan Xu so you better never speak of it again either.\u201dXiao Yao walked outside and all the maids gaped at her. When she returned to Ming Se Court, all her maids stared at her, too. \u201cPrincess\u2026.who\u2026.who beat you up?\u201dXiao Yao walked to the mirror and saw a red palm print on her cheek, and then she thought about Ah Nian\u2019s face all black and blue and laughed \u201cIn this Palace, other than the other Princess, who dares to hit me? Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t let her get away with it. If you want to see how she ended up, run off to check it out.\u201dThe maids remain rooted in place so Xiao Yao said \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to go check it out, then draw me a hot bath. I want to wash off the stench of the ocean.\u201dThe maids snapped out of it and ran off to prepare the bath and get her some medicine. Xiao Yao finished her bath and applied some medicine then had a meal before telling the maids \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep for two hours, remember to wake me up then.\u201dXiao Yao slept peacefully for two hours and then the maids helped her dress to go out. Xiao Yao said \u201cSomething comfortable\u201d and then added \u201cAnd pretty. Something comfortable and pretty.:The maids smiled under their heads and one brought out a yellow dress \u201cThis one needs to cinch the waist but it\u2019s not as tight as formal wear. It\u2019s quite comfortable actually.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and chose this outfit. After getting dressed, she looked at herself in the mirror and sighed. With Ah Nian\u2019s palm print still visible, she might as well have not put any powder on.She put on a hat cover and accessories before taking a cloud carriage out of the Palace. Zhuan Xu said Feng Long was leaving tomorrow which meant Jing was also leaving tomorrow. With this parting, it wasn\u2019t clear when they would see each other again so she wanted to see him one more time before he left.She arrived at the Tu Shan residence in Ying Province but heard from the guard outside \u201cMaster Jing went shopping likely to buy local products to take home for the family.\u201dXiao Yao thought Jing would rest but he went out with the others likely to not let people know he was out all night. Remembering his two fox tail dolls, if he wanted to conceal his whereabouts, it would be hard for the world to find out what he was up to.With Jing not around, Xiao Yao was bored and didn\u2019t want to go right back so decided to walk around town. The last time she was here she was still a kid. Back then only low powered G.o.ds lived here, it was lovely but not very lively. Now there were many humans living here, and even demons, and everyone mixed together made the entire town bustling. Everyone appeared to coexist as equals and were mannered and polite.Xiao Yao felt so proud of her dad. Since she came back, she could tell her dad wasn\u2019t happy, and he said he used everything he had to exchange for this, so this was likely what her dad wanted!Xiao Yao saw a set of coral boxes inlaid within each other. The larger ones could hold accessories while the smaller could be used for make up. Xiao Yao wanted to buy it for her maid and asked \u201cHow much?\u2019A girl\u2019s voice rang out \u201cI want this, wrap it up.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t have to buy it but felt the other girl was so rude so said to the shop owner \u201cI saw this first and asked the price first. If I didn\u2019t pa.s.s on it, then you can\u2019t sell it to someone else.\u201dThe shop owner apologized to the other girl \u201cShe\u2019s correct, this is the etiquette of shopping.\u201dThe girl said \u201cWhatever the price, I\u2019ll pay double.\u201dAnother girl said \u201cThe detail is pa.s.sable but the coral isn\u2019t very good. If little sister wants it, I\u2019ll order my master artisans to craft a coral set just for you.\u201dXiao Yao felt their voices were familiar and turned around to see it was Xing Yue and Yi Yang.Feng Long and Zhuan Xu was walking over with a few servants trailing them. Xing Yue said to a servant \u201cPack up this coral box\u201d and then glanced at Xiao Yao before turning to Yi Yang \u201cI\u2019m not someone who hasn\u2019t seen nice things, this is hardly worth my time. I just think it\u2019s interesting so want to buy it as a reward for my maids.\u201dXiao Yao wasn\u2019t accustomed to using words to match wits with someone like Xing Yue, and actually wished Ah Nian or Hai Tang were around right now. She remembered the way Hai Tang asked Xing Yue\u2019s had for a stack of rare wood and started laughing and said \u201cIf the lady likes it, then she can have it.\u201dZhuan Xu called out \u201cXiao Yao! It\u2019s really you! How come you\u2019re out shopping?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI was bored so came out for a stroll.\u201d She glanced towards Jing and saw quiet joy in his sleep deprived eyes and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but mask her small smile.Despite it being casual conversation, it was clear Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao were very close. Xing Yue warily looked at Xiao Yao and then said to Zhuan Xu \u201cYour lady friends are so many, randomly b.u.mping into one while shopping on the street.\u201dFeng Long and Hou both laughed while Zhuan Xu cleared his throat and made introductions \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys all want to meet my cousin last night? This is my cousin.\u201dFeng Long stopped laughing and everyone got serious and respectfully greeted Xiao Yao. When Feng Long raised his head, he carefully looked at her but her face was covered in a veiled hat so he couldn\u2019t see her features.Xiao Yao greeted everyone back and glanced at Tu Shan Hou. She thought even if he was handsome, he likely looked rather beastly, but who knew he was unexpectedly das.h.i.+ng. He looked very similar to Jing, but harder, fiercer, and he had a small scar on the corner of his lips which gave off the aura of intensity even when he smiled.Xing Yue handed the coral box to Xiao Yao with a laugh \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, because we\u2019re leaving tomorrow and chanced upon this unique present, I got anxious and wanted to buy it. Please accept it as an apology.\u201dXiao Yao was impressed, undoubtedly a child raised by one of the two largest n.o.ble clans so she had finesse. She looked at Zhuan Xu and he nodded so she accepted with a smile \u201cThank you.\u201dXing Yue was ecstatic \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to shop with more people, please come with us!\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Xiao Yao agreed.Everyone shopped and talked but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t say much though everyone was very solicitous of her and the entire outing was very pleasant.Xing Yue and Feng Long bought a lot and their servants had their hands full in boxes and bags. Xing Yue apologized \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at us, both our parents sides are large families and if we visit Five G.o.ds Mountain and don\u2019t bring presents home, it\u2019s rude. And if we give something to one side, we have to give to the other.\u201dHou said \u201cWe won\u2019t laugh, we\u2019re all just envious.\u201dXing Yue smiled.Xiao Yao thought that Xing Yue was very nice to Hou, and treated him the same as she treated Jing.Xing Yue said \u201cI can\u2019t shop anymore, let\u2019s find a place to rest.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI knew you were tired out. There is a restaurant over there that has good food. It\u2019s almost dinner time, why don\u2019t we have dinner there and it\u2019ll be my farewell treat.\u201dZhuan Xu led everyone to the restaurant and the owner came out and greeted them before leading them to a private rooftop area. It was surrounded by two sides as tall as buildings and lots of flowers and vines were growing along the sides, giving off the mood of dining in the mountains.Xing Yue complimented to Zhuan Xu \u201cThis place is lovely.\u201dThe owner led them to a square table with two seats at each side. Xiao Yao glanced at Zhuan Xu before sitting but before she could choose, Xing Yue placed her next to Feng Long, then took the seat to her left beside Zhuan Xu, that left Yi Yang and Jing across from Xiao Yao and Feng Long, and Hou took the solo seat on the final side.The owner brought various types of wines, some were fierce and strong, others light and sweet like honey. He then placed several plates of fruits and appetizers on the table to start.He saw Zhuan Xu nod in approval and then excused himself.Feng Long laughed \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like a customer and more like the owner.\u201dZhuan Xu chucked \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you guys, I am the owner here. I like making wine and it\u2019s no fun to drink alone so I opened a few stores.\u201dXing Yue was interested so continued the conversation, with Yi Yang and Hou also joining in so the talk was flowing.Feng Long used a clean chopstick and picked up some vegetables for Xiao Yao and placed it on her plate \u201cI saw you ate this first but then didn\u2019t take anymore. You must like it but if it\u2019s too far to reach, I can get you some.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Jing and then ate a piece before saying \u201cThank you.\u201dFeng Long had tried all the wines and poured a sweet fruit wine for Xiao Yao \u201cTry this.\u201dXiao Yao accepted it and said \u201cYou chat with them, no need to take care of me.\u201dXing Yue heard and interjected \u201cMy Gege isn\u2019t like this normally, usually people take care of him and he never takes care of others. He\u2019s definitely different today, and I\u2019ve never seen him so solicitous of even me.\u201dFeng Long chastised her \u201cNonsense!\u201dXing Yue made a face back and turned to Jing \u201cJing gege, you\u2019re close with my brother, am I talking nonsense?\u201dJing smiled \u201cNo, it\u2019s not nonsense.\u201dFeng Long was not happy and pointed at Jing before saying to Yi Yang \u201cSister-in-law, please help shut him up for me.\u201dYi Yang\u2019s face was red with embarra.s.sment and she glanced at Hou before saying \u201cStop it!\u201d before swiftly putting some food on Jing\u2019s plate and pouring him a cup of wine.Feng Long shook his head \u201cThis doesn\u2019t count as shutting his lips up.\u201dFeng Long and Xing Yue were playfully cheering her on so Yi Yang didn\u2019t mind and picked up a cup of wine and placed it under Jing\u2019s lips and said \u201cPlease enjoy.\u201dJing sat there stiffly and didn\u2019t move, a very awkward smile on his face.Folks were cheering and Feng Long wondered \u201cEh? You\u2019re not awkward normally, how come you\u2019re so proper today?\u201dJing lowered his eyes and drank the cup of wine from Yi Yang\u2019s hand. Zhuan Xu and Feng Long clapped and Feng Long said \u201cGood for sister-in-law!\u201dHou also laughed and Yi Yang glanced at him before breaking into a smile.Xiao Yao felt her heart tighten and ate all the vegetables on her plate and Feng Long got her another serving.Yi Yang said \u201cXiao Yao, there are no other people here, why don\u2019t you take off your hat and be more comfortable.\u201dXing Yue concurred \u201cYes, yes.\u201dXiao Yao apologized \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, but I must have eaten something and I have pimples on my face and it\u2019s not suitable to show it to folks.\u201dYi Yang and Xing Yue both sighed and Xing Yue turned to Feng Long \u201cDon\u2019t say your sister didn\u2019t try to help you, it\u2019s the Heavens not helping you.\u201dWaiters came back and set down piping hot plates of food and a few more jugs of wine. Xing Yue tried a bite and turned to Zhuan Xu \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cWith your compliment, I\u2019ll have to reward the chef when I get back.\u201dTalk turned to the various families in the vast wilderness, which capable descendants have risen up the ranks, what folks liked, conversation was easy going but within it held lots of important details.Jing silently drank his wine and his friends appeared to be used to him so didn\u2019t think it weird. He seemed zone out but whenever Feng Long or Zhuan Xu asked him something, he was always able to respond, clearly aware of everything said around him.Xiao Yao grabbed the strongest wine and started downing it, gradually her bones grew soft and she curled up like a cat, with her one hand propping up her head and the other holding a wine cup.Feng Long didn\u2019t seem to find it strange and kept pouring her more as he poured himself more, as if they were having a drinking game. Zhuan Xu noticed and said \u201cFeng Long, don\u2019t get my little sister drunk.\u201dFeng Long sighed \u201cWho gets who drunk is not clear yet.\u201dZhuan Xu knew Xiao Yao\u2019s tolerance so said nothing, and lo and behold Feng Long got drunk first. Everyone else was all tipsy and it wasn\u2019t clear who suggested heading out to sea and no one objected.They headed to a nearby port where Zhuan Xu had a boat ready and they all boarded and headed out to sea.On the boat and with the cold sea air blowing, everyone\u2019s drunkenness dissipated somewhat. Perhaps because they were all still so young, or maybe tomorrow was farewell, but everyone was in the mood to keep making merry so the wine continued to flow.Yi Yang got drunk and pulled Xing Yue to dance on the deck. Feng Long saw a giant fish swim by and said he was going to catch it and with a plop he jumped overboard. Zhuan Xu freaked out but Xing Yue laughed \u201cDon\u2019t worry! He\u2019s the son of the Chi Sui clan, he goes crazy around water! Anyone can drown except him!\u201dZhuan Xu wasn\u2019t sure and wanted a servant to go with him but they only brought one servant to steer the boat. Hou put down his drink \u201cI\u2019ll go keep him company\u201d and then with a plop he was in the water as well.Zhuan Xu stood at the bow and stared out into the ocean and Yi Yang said with a smile \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s caught plenty of sea monsters and creatures since he was a kid. We might need to worry more that he\u2019ll bring some crazy seafood back soon.\u201dZhuan Xu felt the wine getting to his head and it started hurting.Yi Yang turned to Xing Yue with a smile \u201cI\u2019m going to catch the moon, wanna come?\u201d Xing Yue shook her head and pointed back at Yi Yang \u201cYou\u2019re really drunk.\u201d Plop, Yi Yang swanned into the water.Xing Yue laughed while Zhuan Xu said wearily \u201cShould I continue to not worry?\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cI don\u2019t know her water power talents, but we\u2019ll know if we go in the water too.\u201d She pulled Zhuan Xu who said \u201cI can\u2019t swim, you know that.\u201dXing Yue\u2019s eyes glittered like seductive stars \u201cI know you can\u2019t swim. But jump down with me!\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing and looked at Xing Yue while she laughed with a fire burning in her eyes \u201cDo you dare put your life in my hands?\u201d She walked backwards still staring at Zhuan Xu before she fell overboard with her back arching.Zhuan Xu smiled and walked over and vaulted into the water.Xiao Yao laughed as she drank her wine and sprawled on the boat thinking to herself that if it wasn\u2019t for Xiang Liu that b.a.s.t.a.r.d demon tormenting her last night, she would have jumped in right now.Jing silently walked behind her and she turned and sat down on the deck and scoffed \u201cNow you dare get close to me?\u201dJing said nothing and Xiao Yao raised her empty cup. Jing poured her another cup and she handed the cup to him. He thought she wanted him to drink and was about to when she lifted her veil and pointed to her lips.Jing placed the cup of wine under her lips and she grabbed his hand to drink it slowly.The alcohol rushed up and her head was splitting in pain as her stomach roiled. She knew she was really drunk this time so she pushed Jing aside and leaned against the s.h.i.+p to wait for the nausea to pa.s.s.Jing took a few pills and placed it under Xiao Yao\u2019s nose for her to sniff. She said \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten what I taught you.\u201d\u201cI will never forget.\u201d\u201cSeeing Feng Long so nice to me, does your heart hurt?\u201d\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Jing paused and said slowly \u201cIt hurts a lot.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cSeeing you hurt, now I feel better.\u201dJing\u2019s hand brushed her face \u201cWho hit you?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cAh Nian, I kicked her a few times and punched her in the face. We\u2019re even.\u201dJing\u2019s hand acc.u.mulated his power and he was lightly rubbing her cheek to make the swelling go down but she pushed his hand away \u201cYour mom picked well. Fang Feng Yi Yang is a good wife to have, you two are very suited for each other.\u201dAll the blood color in Jing\u2019s face disappeared and he lowered his head \u201cI knew this morning felt like a dream. I was happy all day, and when I saw you shopping I thought you came to see me, and I was even happier\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao silently sat on desk and said nothing.Xiao Yao remembered when she saved s.h.i.+ Qi, he would silently lay there and accept whatever Xiao Yao did to him. He didn\u2019t express pain, or hunger, or thirst, and many times she thought s.h.i.+ Qi was dead and touched his pulse to confirm he was still alive.Xiao Yao felt her heart hurt and then she felt her stomach coming up so she leaned over the railing and threw up.Jing patted her back until she was done, then handed her water to rinse her mouth. Xiao Yao\u2019s head hurt and feet were like lead. Jing held her and gently helped her sit down.Jing smoothed her hair back from her face when Xiao Yao suddenly grabbed him around the waist and murmured \u201cI did go see you this afternoon, if you don\u2019t believe me go ask your guard. I couldn\u2019t find you so I went shopping.\u201dJing held Xiao Yao and rested his cheek on her head. It was just a short time, he sunk to the depths of despair and now vaulted back up to the clouds of happiness.He felt Xiao Yao\u2019s body sinking and looked down to see that she was fast asleep. He smiled and adjusted their positions so that she was sleeping in his arms.The sea breeze was gently blowing as the boat was rocked by the waves. He looked up at the moon and wanted to spend this night like this.Jing looked at the jug of wine beside him and placed his hand on it and a white mist rose from the jug and enveloped the entire boat in thick white fog. It was like the entire boat had been consumed by the sea and nothing was left from the outside.Jing lowered his head to look at the sleeping Xiao Yao and his fingers gently traced her face, over and over, until even if he lost his sight one day, he would still be able to see her face.After an hour, Xiao Yao stirred and called out 's.h.i.+ Qi\u201d before opening her eyes. Jing smiled at her and she said \u201cI think I fell asleep.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThey are not back yet?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cNormally one is more serious than the other, who knew they were all a bunch of lunatics.\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019m not interested in Yi Yang and she\u2019s not interested in me. This time when I go back, I\u2019ll tell my grandmother to end the engagement.\u201d\u201cHhmmm, huh?\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s mind was still fuzzy so it told her a moment to process it \u201cHow do you know? She\u2019s so nice to you\u2026..\u201dJing cut her off \u201cXiao Yao, I\u2019ve met plenty of women interested in me, I know how a woman looks at a man she wants. No matter how nice she is to me, she\u2019s never looked at me like that. And now\u2026..\u201d Jing stroked her hair \u201cNow I know what it feels like to want someone, I\u2019m not wrong!\u201dXiao Yao released a sigh \u201cOkay.\u201dJing actually felt worse because Xiao Yao didn\u2019t see that when he was alone with Yi Yang, the way she looked at him. Xiao Yao never thought of him as crippled so thought Yi Yang would feel the same, she thought others saw him the way she saw him.Xiao Yao suddenly thought of something and sat up excitedly \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want you, then come back to be my s.h.i.+ Qi!\u201d Her eyes lit up \u201cYou worried back then that Tu Shan Hou that lunatic would harm Lao Mu and me so you went back to being Tu Shan Jing. But Wen Xiao Liu is gone now and I\u2019m the Gao Xing Princess. Tu Shan Hou can\u2019t harm me, you can come back to be s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao, saying nothing but the sadness was evident in his eyes.Xiao Yao calmed down and mocked herself \u201cDid I just talk nonsense?\u201d Jing disappeared once already, if it happened again, forget Tu Shan Hou, his grandmother wouldn\u2019t accept his death until she saw his corpse with her own eyes.Jing said in a low voice \u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense, bu things have changed. After going back, I realized my brother has been leading the clan into danger. If I leave, I worry he will destroy the family. Xiao Yao, give me some time, okay? I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d It actually wasn\u2019t just his family, if Xiao Yao was Wen Xiao Liu then he would be Ye s.h.i.+ Qi with her in some remote mountain for the rest of their lives. But she was the Gao Xing Princess, and seeing her at the ma.s.sive royal ceremony, he knew that neither of them could go back. A man who deserved to be with Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t be a coward, if he wanted to be with her, then he needed to end the engagement. He needed to be Tu Shan Jing and openly walk to be with Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cYou have fifteen years, Jing. What are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I know I will come back to you. I\u2019ve promised to listen to you for the rest of my life\u2026..\u201d Jing\u2019s forehead rested on Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead and he prayed \u201cPlease keep your heart for me.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s hands sank into his hair and she grabbed it \u201cI can tell you\u2019re a sneaky one, even if I want to forget it, you\u2019ll find ways to keep reminding. You say you don\u2019t dare hope, but then you don\u2019t let go either.\u201dJing\u2019s voice conveyed his torment \u201cI\u2026.I just cannot\u2026..I know you deserve better, but I cannot\u2026..I\u2019m sorry\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao quickly said \u201cI understand, I understand.\u201dJing said in a low voice \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201dXiao Yao was honest \u201cI don\u2019t understand, but I have to try and rea.s.sure you.\u201dJing laughed and then sighed \u201cThey are coming back.\u201dXiao Yao looked up \u201cIt\u2019s almost sunrise, they ought to be back.\u201dJing looked at Xiao Yao and wanted to put the hat on her but she held his hand and wouldn\u2019t let him. She bit her lips and closed her eyes. Jing tenderly kissed her on the forehead, until the very last minute when he lifted his head and put the hat on her.Xiao Yao ran to the back of the boat to fix her clothes and hair. She heard Xing Yue, Zhuan Xu, and Feng Long talking. She looked up and saw Jing\u2019s hair was a mess from her raking her fingers through it. It was too late to tell him and her face darkened with worry. Then she saw Jing stand up and release the band tying his hair up and sent his hair flying in the sea breeze. He leaned against the railing and looked up at the sunrise.Xiao Yao\u2019s heart leaped to her chest like a little deer lost. Zhuan Xu had to call her a few times to get her attention. He pushed her softly \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dXiao Yao quickly said \u201cOh, you guys are back.\u201d Her face was bright red but thankfully it was covered by the veil so no one could see it. Zhuan Xu seemed to understand something and concern flitted across his eyes.Xing Yue complained about how they forgot where the boat was so swam for a long time before finding it, and how they didn\u2019t run into Yi Yang and Hou and hoped they were alright.Yi Yang swam towards the boat and Xing Yue ran over to pull her up \u201cDid you guys also can\u2019t find the boat?\u201dYi Yang paused and then smiled \u201cYeah.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cThere is breakfast inside the cabin, if you guys are hungry go ahead and eat.\u201d Those who swam all night went in and Xiao Yao and Jing followed.Feng Long asked Xiao Yao \u201cWant some breakfast?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI can get it myself, you enjoy.\u201dZhuan Xu glanced at her with a smirk and she glared back: how dare you tease me?Everyone seemed tired so there wasn\u2019t a lot of talk, and even when breakfast was done Hou was still not back.Xing Yue worriedly asked \u201cIs Hou gege alright?\u201dJing said \u201cWith his ability, he should be fine. I\u2019ll have little fox go find him.\u201d He took out a little astral nine-tailed fox from his sleeve but it went nowhere and instead yipped in one direction before running back into Jing\u2019s sleeve.Jing said \u201cHou is back.\u201dIn a few minutes, Hou was visible in the distance. He was riding a giant fierce monster fish and was s.h.i.+rtless as he ripped his robe into cloth strips to create a harness to control the fish\u2019s head and he held on and rode it like a horse in the water. His body rose and fell with the waves, glistening bronzed in the sun exuding all the manly allure of a young strapping man in his prime.Xing Yue and Yi Yang averted their eyes to be polite but Xiao Yao stared in appreciation and called out \u201cDoes it listen to you?\u201d Hou smiled and said nothing but rode the fish around the boat a few more times. Xiao Yao clapped \u201cThis is so fun. I wanted a ride like this so I don\u2019t need to swim anymore.\u201dZhuan Xu mocked her \u201cDream on, with your powers you can to subdue a monster fish like this? It\u2019s easier to make it your snack.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, he was right.Hou held onto the fish and used his other hand to strike its belly and pulled out a red ruby stone the size of an egg. He rinsed it in the ocean and then jumped on the boat.The red ruby was crystal clear and glittered in the sun. Xing Yue said \u201cHou gege, can you give that to me?\u201dNormally Hou would give it to her but he smiled in apology \u201cThis fish ruby I need, next time I\u2019ll have someone get you another.\u201dXing Yue sad nothing and walked over to Yi Yang and then two girls stared out over the ocean. With everyone back, Zhuan Xu ordered the boat back to the port.Hou went inside to change and Xiao Yao asked Feng Long \u201cWhat kind of stone is that?\u201dFeng Long smiled \u201cThere is another Tu Shan son here, I\u2019m not the one to talk about precious gems\u201d He called Jing over \u201cXiao Yao wants to know what kind of gem is the fish ruby.\u201dJing walked over to Xiao Yao \u201cActually it\u2019s the inner power source of the demon fish of the deep seas. It comes in different colors but the red fish ruby is the most common, though one as crystal clear as that is very rare. It can be used as a jewel or accessory, or into medicine, or a top quality one can even be made into a magical object that can help a person breath underwater if it\u2019s place in the mouth.\u201dWhen Jing was talking, Xiao Yao was zoning out until the last thing he said and she got interested \u201cWhat\u2019s considered top quality? Was that piece?\u201d\u201cThe more clear the color, the higher the quality. That piece was one of the best fish rubies.\u201dFeng Long said to Xiao Yao \u201cThis cannot be sought and can only be found by chance. If you want one, I\u2019ll go ask my grandfather.\u201dXiao Yao quickly said \u201cI just found it pretty and was asking for fun.\u201dThe ocean under the morning sun glittered like gold dust was sprinkled on it. A pack of sea birds flew over head and everyone looked out over the ocean to enjoy the view. Xiao Yao snuck a peek at Jing from under her veil. Jing sensed it and he lowered his eyes and smiled. Xiao Yao also smiled, even if she couldn\u2019t talk to him or stand too close, but their hearts were aligned together and felt very close.The boat reached sh.o.r.e and everyone got off. Feng Long\u2019s servants already had their belongings all packed so they just needed to get back on the Chi Sui s.h.i.+p to head back to the Middle Plains.Zhuan Xu led Xiao Yao to say their farewells, and with the talkative and smooth Zhuan Xu around, Xiao Yao only needed to bow and say a few words. Xing Yue\u2019s eyes were slightly red and she stood on the s.h.i.+p with her brother but kept looking back at Zhuan Xu.Jing got on the s.h.i.+p and stood by the railing to stare at Xiao Yao. The s.h.i.+ps left and Zhuan Xu waved to them but Xiao Yao stood there silently. The wind blew the veil on her face and outline her features as she stood there tall in her yellow robe, like a flower blooming in the sunlight.Jing stared until she was gone from sight and he closed his eyes. Xiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026..Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao returned to Cheng En Palace and he pulled her hat off and sighed \u201cYou got slapped by Ah Nian? I need to go see what number you did on her.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cShe and I resolved our issues, and what happens in the future, only fate will determine.\u201dZhuan Xu said with a smile \u201cWhen I got back on the boat and asked the servant, he said he fell asleep last night. Did you and Jing have a good time?\u201dXiao Yao smirked back at him \u201cSomeone jumped in the ocean without fear for his life. Did you have fun?\u201dZhuan Xu casually said \u201cIf she wants to play for real, then we\u2019ll just have to wait and see!\u201dXiao Yao asked in confusion \u201cHow do you guys know when a girl is for real? Even if she\u2019s for real, what kind of real is it? Some real may handle eighty partings, but not the eighty-first. Some real can handle poverty, others can only handle wealthy. Some real can be good in safety, but in tragedy goes their separate ways. Some couples grow old together but it\u2019s not real between them, yet they manage to make it work because they were never faced with any test.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cYour questions are giving me a headache. If you ask how I know, I don\u2019t know other than I can feel it. One cold heart, one clear set of eyes, I\u2019ve experienced a lot so I can see very clearly.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhat if you see wrong?\u201dZhuan Xu softly said \u201cThe only way to guarantee not being wrong is to have a cold heart.\u201dXiao Yao scrunched up her face \u201cI thought you had a better idea!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. I think even the grandfather of ours that is so ruthless and brilliant that he strikes fear in everyone, even he can\u2019t see genuinely through a person\u2019s heart.\u201dXiao Yao chuckled wearily \u201cThe Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cGrandmother, Mom and Dad, Auntie, and Eldest Uncle and Second Uncle\u2026.their graves have been unattended for too many years. Next year at Auntie\u2019s remembrance day, I vow I will be standing on Cao Yun Peak in Xuan Yuan Montain.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes misted with tears and she nodded \u201cYes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe three G.o.d kingdoms that coexisted in Once Promised has become just two kingdoms when Lost You Forever rolls around. We\u2019ve spent time in the Gao Xing Kingdom where Xiao Yao\u2019s dad rules as the Grand Emperor, and where her cousin Zhuan Xu was pretty much educated and trained after he started to become a threat to his Xuan Yuan uncles. While Xiao Yao has been running around the world trying to cut off ties with her past life, Zhuan Xu hasn\u2019t been able to reclaim his past life as the Xuan Yuan Prince even if he wanted to. He wasn\u2019t prohibited from going back to Xuan Yuan, but the situation there remains precarious for his safety so he needed to find the right time to go back and start taking the first steps towards taking back what belongs to him. The Yellow Emperor had ten kids (nine sons and one daughter), but all his capable, courageous, and thoughtful offspring have died leaving a few sons that covet power without having the corresponding ability to lead. Zhuan Xu has shown us that he\u2019s grown into a smart, savvy, and much too strategic adult, one who is clearly well-suited for the game of politics and the burdens of leaders.h.i.+p.Xiao Yao's return to being a Princess finally takes these two cousins back to Xuan Yuan Mountain and it\u2019s a bittersweet return trip indeed.\u00a0She hasn\u2019t been back since her mom took her away to stash in Jade Mountain, and whatever fond memories she had there is all long gone. She does still have a grandfather in the Yellow Emperor, a ruler who managed to topple the Sheng Nong Kingdom by will power and manipulation so vast the price he paid was losing his wives and many of his children. But if you asked him if it was worth it, his answer would probably be the same as what the Grand Emperor said to Xiao Yao \u201cI gave up everything I have in exchange for everything I want.\u201d That makes Xiao Yao\u2019s personality and outlook so at odds with the people closest to her, because she will never give up anything she has because she wants for nothing. She wants for something so simple \u2013 a boring life with s.h.i.+ Qi \u2013 that it\u2019s almost impossible for her to get what would come naturally for ordinary people. This is yet another fantastic chapter of the novel and despite it being so deep into the story, a new character makes his belated appearance not a moment to soon. I said all four leads have alter egos in this story and so far we\u2019ve met Xiao Liu/Xiao Yao, s.h.i.+ Qi/Jing, and Xuan/Zhuan Xu. Guess who is missing an alternate ident.i.ty and that\u2019s the fascinating guy that\u2019s finally arrived to shake up the story even more going forward.Chapter 15 \u2013 Thinking of the Past is Easily Sorrowful:When the first Spring wind blew over the great Middle Plains, Gao Xing\u2019s Eldest Princess wrote a letter to the Yellow Emperor asking to visit Xuan Yuan Mountain on her mother\u2019s death anniversary to pray at her grave as a filial daughter. She also hoped to do her filial duty on behalf of her mother to the Yellow Emperor.The letter was handwritten by the Eldest Princess and had her seal on it, delivered to the Yellow Emperor by an envoy sent by the Grand Emperor.The Yellow Emperor read the letter and then let his court read it. There was no logical reason for anyone to object to a daughter wanting to pray to her mother\u2019s grave and wanting to see her grandfather. So the entire court only discussed how to receive the Gao Xing Princess, who wasn\u2019t just the Gao Xing Princess but also the Yellow Emperor\u2019s granddaughter. Her mother died in battle for Xuan Yuan as well. So after much discussion, it was agreed her reception would be as lavish as possible.When the peach blossoms bloomed throughout the Middle Plains, Xiao Yao left Five G.o.ds Mountain and Zhuan Xu accompanied her as her cousin and at her request. She arrived at Xuan Yuan Castle and her two uncles Xuan Yuan Cang Lin and Xuan Yuan Yu Yang met the convey with her five younger male cousins in tow.After chatting for a bit, Cang Lin said to Xiao Yao \u201cNormally we would have a welcoming banquet at Shan Heng Palace, but father is very old now and doesn\u2019t move around as well, plus he doesn\u2019t like seeing people and making the usual annoying pleasantries, so your seventh uncle will hold a banquet for the entire convoy and your grandfather will see only you at Cao Yun Peak.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cOkay, will Uncle take me to see Grandfather then.\u201dCang Lin said \u201cAfter you, Princess!\u201dThe servants appeared to be keeping Zhuan Xu aside as if no one expected him to go to Xuan Yuan Mountain. Xiao Yao stood in front of the cloud carriage and asked \u201cIs Zhuan Xu gege not coming as well?\u201dCang Lin smiled warmly \u201cFather didn\u2019t say he would see Zhuan Xu so we\u2019ve made arrangements for him so don\u2019t worry.\u201dAnother cousin whose name Xiao Yao hadn\u2019t yet remembered also smiled \u201cOlder sister don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll hang out with big brother.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and walked towards Zhuan Xu. Xuan Yuan guards appeared to want to stop her but she stared at them to see if they dared. The Gao Xing guards had their hands on their weapons already and everybody paused. Xiao Yao walked right up to Zhuan Xu and grabbed his hand and said with a pout to Cang Lin \u201cWhen I used to live in Cao Yun Peak, it was always Zhuan Xu gege with me. If he doesn\u2019t come this time, I\u2019m not going!\u201dCang Lin laughed \u201cIt\u2019s not that Uncle doesn\u2019t want to, but if father doesn\u2019t summon him, then we don\u2019t dare decide on our own.\u201d\u201cIf Grandfather gets mad, Uncle needn\u2019t worry as I\u2019ll accept the consequences!\u201d Xiao Yao tried to pull Zhuan Xu into the cloud carriage but two Xuan Yuan guards blocked her so she looked at Cang Lin \u201cZhuan Xu gege really can\u2019t go?\u201dCang Lin said \u201cPrincess, please forgive!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face fell and she said loudly to her Gao Xing guards \u201cSince Xuan Yuan doesn\u2019t welcome me, back to Gao Xing immediately!\u201d Xiao Yao pulled Zhuan Xu and walked off.The Gao Xing guards immediately formed a line like they were returning to Gao Xing. Cang Lin could tell Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t faking it so hurriedly said \u201cPrincess, please behave!\u201dXiao Yao was furious and yelled \u201cMe behave? Would anyone come thousands of miles to not behave? I\u2019m the Gao Xing Eldest Princess, what can\u2019t I get in Gao Xing. My mother died for the people of Xuan Yuan. I traveled far to pray at her grave and to see my Grandfather. All I want is my beloved cousin to come with me. The Xuan Yuan guards have kept me from getting into the cloud carriage. I want the people of the entire world to decide if I\u2019m the one misbehaving, or is Xuan Yuan unreasonable?\u201dCang Lin couldn\u2019t imagine Xiao Yao\u2019s personality was so fierce and b.i.t.c.hy and she was fairly shrieking like a fishwife on the street. If she left today then things could get ugly and he could be cursed by millions and his father would be furious. He endured and said \u201cPrincess you are mistaken, no one is keeping Princess from getting on.\u201dAll the Xuan Yuan guards moved aside and Xiao Yao saw her goal had been accomplished and calmed down to get into the cloud carriage with Zhuan Xu.As the cloud carriage traveled up to the Peak, Xiao Yao looked at Zhuan Xu who was tightly gripping her hand, his lips pressed together. It had been over two hundred years when a very young him was forced by his four uncles to leave Xuan Yuan Mountain alone. Back then, he stood at the boat bow and looked back at the disappearing Cao Yun Peak and vowed: I will be back!The cloud carriage stopped and the maids came to a.s.sist the Princess down. Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao got off the carriage.Zhuan Xu looked up and saw the plaque hanging over the Palace door, on top was handwritten in their grandmother\u2019s script \u201cCao Yun Court\u201d in three large characters. He said in his heart: Grandmother, Dad, I\u2019m back! After wandering for two hundred years, I\u2019m finally back! Sorry for making you wait so long!Xiao Yao looked up at the same plaque, three hundred years ago this Palace used to be filled with the laughter and happiness of her relatives. Today as she came back, it was just her and Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao looked at each other and then they both step forward at the same time and crossed the threshold into the Court.Xiao Yao had no expression on her face and walked slowly while Zhuan Xu walked behind her also very slowly.Xiao Yao arrived at the front of the Court where a white haired old man with a face full of wrinkles, thin and frail, laid on the pallet with his eyes closed as if tired and was napping. He heard Xiao Yao\u2019s footsteps and opened his eyes and looked at her with a still sharp and incisive gaze.Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu both thought of their beloved pa.s.sed grandmother at that moment and both knelt down simultaneously and said at the same time \u201cYour granddaughter/grandson is back.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor waved his hand \u201cCome here.\u201dXiao Yao and Zhuan Xu bowed three times and then stood up and walked over to him. Xiao Yao was so casual she sat right own on the pallet while Zhuan Xu remained standing respectfully.The Yellow Emperor stared at Xiao Yao \u201cYou don\u2019t look like your mom, but your face shape and mouth does look like your grandmother, exactly like when I first met her.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s memory of her grandmother was old and shriveled and a face full of wrinkles so she didn\u2019t know if she looked like her so could only smile.The Yellow Emperor guessed what she was thinking and said \u201cYour grandmother was once young like you. Her beauty and talent was world renowned throughout the vast wilderness. So many men wanted to marry her. Sadly, she chose the wrong person.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned and didn\u2019t know what to say to that. She couldn\u2019t agree that her grandmother married wrong, or say that she didn\u2019t marry wrong. Because she sensed that her grandparents had a falling out towards the later part of her grandmother\u2019s life. In the years before she died, her grandfather never came to see her. Actually, other than the time her grandfather grabbed a sword and tried to kill her mother, she never saw her grandfather in Cao Yun Court until her grandmother died. Her grandfather was injured and then he moved to Cao Yun Court.Xiao Yas was silent as if processing what he said but the Yellow Emperor didn\u2019t mind and just smiled and stared at her.The Yellow Emperor looked at Zhuan Xu and his smile disappeared, with none of the joy and warmth of when he looked at Xiao Yao, and was instead filled with judgment and careful deliberation. Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t lower his head and just let the Yellow Emperor measure him up from top to bottom.After a few moments, the Yellow Emperor said \u201cI thought you would be enjoying the high life of Gao Xing and forgot how to come back.\u201dZhuan Xu kneeled down \u201cYour grandson made you wait too long.\u201d\u201cWhat have you come back for?\u201dZhuan Xu wanted to answer but the Yellow Emperor interjected \u201cThink carefully before answering, I want to hear what is hidden inside your heart.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and then looked the Yellow Emperor straight in the eye and said \u201cI want Xuan Yuan Mountain. But there is another reason and you might not believe me, but I really want to see my grandfather.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor had no reaction and coldly said \u201cYou have two royal uncles and five younger cousins who all want Xuan Yuan Mountain. If you want it, you figure out how to get it. I won\u2019t help you. Just like this trip back to Cao Yun Peak, only when you walk to see me by yourself will I see you.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor closed his eyes \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m ruthless and cold, if you don\u2019t use your own ability to get something, even if I give it to you, you won\u2019t be able to keep it.\u201d\u201cYour grandson understands.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou both go rest. I\u2019m living in your grandmother\u2019s old residence and the rest are all empty. You can live wherever you want. I don\u2019t like noise so there are very few maids here. If you aren\u2019t use to it\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao interjected \u201cWe\u2019re used to it, when grandmother was still alive there were few maids around and I remember the weeds in the back palace yard being as tall as me. Gege and I played hide and seek there even.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor closed his eyes and waved them off with a smile.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao stepped out of the Court and walked along the corridor to the front section arriving at their old residence in the side. A tall phoenix tree was growing in the courtyard and the flowers were blooming red just like back then. But the swing under the tree was no longer there.Xiao Yao was in a daze like a dream, walking over while a gust of wind blew the flowers everywhere. She reached out and grabbed a flower, removing the stem and putting the petal in her mouth to suck out the flower honey. She smiled and turned to Zhuan Xu \u201cGege, it\u2019s as sweet as before.\u201d She handed a flower to him and he also sucked on it.They were followed by two retainers, one was Xiao Yao\u2019s maid from Gao Xing named Shan Hu, the other was a retainer a.s.signed to Zhuan Xu from Xuan Yuan named Sang Seng.Shan Hu asked \u201cPrincess, shall we stay here?\u201d\u201cRight here\u201d Xiao Yao pointed \u201cI\u2019ll live in that room, Gege will use that room.\u201dShan Hu looked around \u201cIt\u2019s simply decorated but has been kept clean and the bedding is all new. The courtyard is a bit dirty so let me sweep the flowers away.\u201dXiao Yao yelled \u201cNo! When I was small, it was swept every 4-5 days. Grandmother let it acc.u.mulate under the tree even if its mushed into a pile.\u201dXiao Yao and Zhuan Xu sat down in the corridor and silently looked at the phoenix flowers. Shan Hu knew her personality so went to do ch.o.r.es herself, getting friendly with the equally easy to get along with Sang Seng, and the two prepared a bath for Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao. Both were used to taking care of themselves so they washed up alone and then sat down outside for dinner.After dinner, Xiao Yao sent the retainers off to sleep as she and Zhuan Xu walked along the path to the back mountain. The mulberry forest was still verdant green just like when grandmother was still alive. She looked up at it \u201cIn a little while we will have pickled mulberry to eat.\u201d\u201cAuntie loved iced ones. Back then you guys lived in Five G.o.ds Mountain and I hadn\u2019t yet met you but Grandmother would natter about how Auntie loved it and there weren\u2019t any good mulberry trees in Five G.o.ds Mountain so she would make it here and send it to her. I even helped Grandmother pick mulberry to make iced pickled mulberry.\u201dXiao Yao smiled sweetly \u201cEvery year someone will deliver it to my mom and she didn\u2019t want to eat it all at once so she would only have a small dish a day. It was icy and sweet and tart, and Gao Xing is always warm so I loved to eat it too. Every time I would fight with my mom to have some and we never had enough. The maids went to pluck mulberry to make it but it never tasted the same as the ones Grandmother sent.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cWhen the mulberry is ripe, I\u2019ll make some for you. I guarantee it\u2019ll taste just like Grandmother\u2019s.\u201dXiao Yao nodded even when the two of them knew it wouldn\u2019t taste exactly the same. But they had lost so much already and neither wanted to wallow in the past.It wasn\u2019t until late into the night when they came back and went to their own residences to sleep. Xiao Yao thought she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep but once she laid down she quickly fell asleep and slept soundly.Until the second day when the sun was high in the sky did she wake up. She heard Zhuan Xu left already to see to Yellow Emperor.Xiao Yao took her time, was.h.i.+ng and eating, before leaving her room and going outside. She saw a swing under the phoenix tree and heard from Shan Hu \u201cNot sure what the Prince was thinking, not sleeping all night and staying up to make a swing.\u201dXiao Yao leaned on the wall and smiled, feeling her eyes tear up.Shan Hu asked \u201cPrincess, want to swing?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head and slowly walked off, not intending to go see Zhuan Xu or the Yellow Emperor, just wandering. She arrived at her grandmother\u2019s old residence and saw guards standing outside. No one stopped her nor announced her.Xiao Yao walked into the room and saw the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu playing chess, the Yellow Emperor laying sideways while Zhuan Xu sat up. But their expressions were identical, no expression whatsoever so no one could tell what they were thinking.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t pay them any heed and wandered around the room. She was shocked the room was much like it was when she was small, it was like her grandmother still lived here. Even her hairbrush and her accessories were still at her dressing table.Xiao Yao sat at the dressing table and opened an accessory box. Inside was a ruby red headdress that glittered with life as if its owner was coming back right to wear it. But really in Xiao Yao\u2019s memory, its owner never wore it before. She put it on her head and it was magnificent and a crowning glory but it was hard to imagine her grandmother wearing something as flashy as this.\u201cIf you like it, take it.\u201d The Yellow Emperor\u2019s voice reached her.Xiao Yao put down the accessory and closed the box. She shook her head \u201cA woman wears this for someone to see, or more accurately to entrance a man. If I wear this and a man looked at me, I won\u2019t know if he\u2019s looking at the hair piece jewels or me. What if I mistake his feelings and fall for him for real. Aren\u2019t I just looking for trouble?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was stunned while Xiao Yao stared at him and casually said \u201cGrandmother really liked you at one time.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared at her with anger in his eyes \u201cHow can you speak to an elder this way?\u201dXiao Yao looked like she could care less \u201cI like to talk, if Grandfather doesn\u2019t like to hear it, then pretend you didn\u2019t hear it. You all are great at pretending to be deaf and mute whenever you want.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared at her and then sighed heavily \u201cHow did you get this personality? You are totally different than your mom and grandmother.\u201dXiao Yao laughed and made a face \u201cWhy do I want to be like them? The guy gets all the good stuff but the woman suffers!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was exasperated and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cLet\u2019s stop. Want to eat?\u201dZhuan Xu stood up and helped the Yellow Emperor up \u201cGrandfather, lets walk first since you\u2019ve been sitting for some time.\u201dThe two walked slowly in the courtyard while Xiao Yao watched from the window, reminding her of her mom and grandmother. Back then her mom would also take her grandmother on slow strolls in the courtyard.They all sat down to dine simply and the Yellow Emperor casually put a mulberry shaped jade badge in front of Zhuan Xu \u201cCao Yun Peak belonged to your grandmother, every nook and cranny and every blade of gra.s.s here was built by her. The first guards of Cao Yun Peak were trained by her. I live here but I have my own guards. The Cao Yun Peak guards are always at standby and now that you are back, they will listen to you from now on.\u201dZhuan Xu bowed and accepted the jade badge.The Yellow Emperor saw that Zhuan Xu was still expressionless and calm and a fleeting look of satisfaction pa.s.sed through the Yellow Emperor\u2019s eyes. He waved the kids off and headed in to rest.The two walked off before Xiao Yao asked \u201cGege, you really want to come back and take care of Grandfather?\u201dZhuan Xu nodded.Xiao Yao asked incredulously \u201cYou don\u2019t hate him? I do hate him somewhat which is why I was so biting with him back there.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI understand a lot of what he did probably because I\u2019m also a man. In his position, he was not wrong. His choice hurt a lot of people, including grandmother, dad, mom, auntie, you and me, but he also made a lot of people happy. He built Xuan Yuan, he destroyed Sheng Nong, he was the Emperor who united the Middle Plains under one rule. No one sees what he sacrificed and his pain to get there. Do you know, when I was playing chess with him, I knew he had a back injury from a previous battle but he never showed a hint of pain and was always alert and ready to strike. This kind of man, even if he wasn\u2019t my grandfather, I would still respect him. Because he\u2019s my grandfather, I not only respect him, I also love him.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cIt\u2019s lucky being his citizens, but unlucky being his family. You are such a weirdo, he ignores you for two hundred years and let the uncles try to get rid of you, and you still respect and love him.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cXiao Yao, do you hate those two maids who were gossiping about you? Because of them you wandered for hundreds of years.\u201d\u201cNo, if it wasn\u2019t for those two hundred years, I\u2019m not the person I am today. I would have grown up peacefully with my dad but I like who I am today. I\u2019m not scared of anything because I\u2019ve lost everything. No matter what I encounter, I will take a knife in my own hand to destroy my obstacle like I killed that Nine-tailed fox.\u201d\u201cIf the royal uncles didn\u2019t force me, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to Gao Xing, and I wouldn\u2019t have seen another world. Without their a.s.sa.s.sination attempts and plots, I wouldn\u2019t have become wily, calm, powerful in the face of danger. We vanquished obstacles and crushed it under our feet and put it inside of us to give us strength. We don\u2019t see obstacles as bad, and Grandfather is like us as well, which is why he chose to let go.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cFine, fine, I can\u2019t argue with you. I\u2019ll be careful and not try to bait him in the future.\u201dThey arrived at the phoenix tree and both stopped. Zhuan Xu stroked Xiao Yao\u2019s head and said \u201cNo need, you can say whatever you feel. You are his granddaughter and he likes your candid nature. Even if you have resentment towards him, he\u2019s not just anyone, he can handle your resentment and anger.\u201dXiao Yao made a face and said nothing. Zhuan Xu pointed to the swing \u201cDid you play yet?\u201dXiao Yao smiled and sat on the swing \u201cWaiting for the person who pushes me on the swing to play.\u201dZhuan Xu pushed her back and sent her flying forward, time and again, the swing going higher and higher. Xiao Yao looked up and watched the sky full of red falling.The person pus.h.i.+ng the swing, the person on the swing, the red phoenix flowers were still as red. But Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t laugh with abandon like she did back then, only smiling as the wind whistled through her hair.Xiao Yao thought Xuan Yuan had a big memorial ceremony planned for her mom but the Yellow Emperor asked what she wanted \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t like pomp and circ.u.mstance or a lot of people. If you want to have a ceremony my mom would still understand though.\u201d She was surprised the Yellow Emperor ordered all the ceremonies cancelled.On her mother\u2019s memorial day, the only people praying at her grave site was Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao.In the flower covered hilltop, there were six graves containing her grandmother, eldest uncle, eldest aunt, second uncle, fourth uncle and fourth aunt (Zhuan Xu\u2019s parents), and her mom. But in truth, three of the graves were empty and had nothing inside.She wasn\u2019t sure what was in her eldest uncle\u2019s grave and only saw dogwood flowers growing all over his grave site. Her eldest aunt was married to her eldest uncle but she was also the Sheng Nong Kingdom\u2019s eldest princess. When the Sheng Nong Kingdom fell, she incinerated herself and left no corpse behind so what was buried in her grave was her wedding dress when she married into Xuan Yuan.She didn\u2019t know how her second uncle died, only that he left a blackened charred bone fragment which was buried in his grave.Her fourth uncle who was Zhuan Xu\u2019s dad, died at the same time as the Sheng Nong Kingdom\u2019s General Zhu Rong (Little Zhu Rong\u2019s dad). They were both burned alive and nothing was left. His grave was only his clothing. There was also the grave for her fourth aunt who committed suicide.And then her mother who died with the Sheng Nong Kingdom\u2019s Great General Qi Yo with neither leaving any corpse behind. Zhuan Xu said her mother\u2019s grave contained her battle armor.Because she knew her mother wasn\u2019t in her grave, she never wanted to come visit. What could she pray to a battle armor? Gao Xing\u2019s palace still had entire closets full of her mother\u2019s clothes!But when she was standing there with Zhuan Xu, she still felt sorrow even if her mind told her it was just a battle armor.All their relatives who loved them was laying right here! Zhuan Xu knelt down and bowed to all the graves one by one and Xiao Yao followed suit. When he got to their eldest uncle\u2019s grave, Zhuan Xu bowed an extra three times and said about the dogwood flowers growing all over \u201cThis should be the manifestation of Auntie Zhu Yu who was a dogwood wood spirit who gained human form after thousands of years. She chose to kill herself to destroy the demon soul and remove all her G.o.d powers. I was at Gao Xing by then and didn\u2019t understand why but Master told me not to be sad. He said Auntie Zhu Yu got what she wanted and pa.s.sed in peace to be with our Eldest Uncle.\u201dXiao Yao silently bowed three more times.Once they were finished bowing, Zhuan Xu still didn\u2019t stand up. Xiao Yao sat down with her back to the graves and looked at the mountain side full of vibrant flowers. She suddenly remembered when her mom took her to Jade Mountain, they came here with Zhuan Xu to bow to grandmother and her uncles. She went to pick wildflowers with Zhuan Xu, and when they got back, she saw her mother sitting all alone at the grave site. Did her mother know at that moment that she wouldn\u2019t be coming back?[I\u2019ve translated that section from Once Promised below at the end of this chapter]Zhuan Xu stood up and started tending to the graves. His power was rooted in wood and earth so he quickly cleaned everywhere. Xiao Yao picked up the flowers he pulled off and made flower crowns while waiting for him to finish. Once he was done, she had made six flower crowns and laid one at each grave.They were leaving when Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cCome with me to Xuan Yuan Castle.\u201dThey entered the castle and went to a dancing hall and was led to a room with a large center area for dancing. Zhuan Xu said \u201cI want to see Jin Xuan.\u201dHe gave the maid extra money to summon her while Xiao Yao laid on the pallet covered in a veiled hat and looked on curiously.Zhuan Xu sat down at the zither and played it, the melody as clear and flowing as water through a mountain cave, soaring like water over a waterfall. The door opened and a beautiful girl in yellow came in. She quietly sat down and listened to the song. When he was done she said a poem and then \u201cYou finally come.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI finally came.\u201dXiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cGege, I\u2019ll go out to look around.\u201dZhuan Xu nodded and Xiao Yao headed out where she saw a dancer performing in the center of the great hall. Xiao Yao stood at the railing and looked down with a smile. The Xuan Yuan dance halls had male and female guests, though still mostly men, but some women wearing men\u2019s attire. Xiao Yao was dressed like a girl and wearing a veiled hat so garnered a lot of attention. She didn\u2019t care, they could look at her while she looked at the beauties.The dancer was performing and her undulations make her tiny waist oh so touchable and many men tried to reach but were not able to to. Two men walked in through a curtained doorway and one man grabbed the dancer and felt up her waist before tossing her into the arms of the other man \u201cLet this little waist spend the night with you.\u201dThe dancers at the dance halls were performers and not prost.i.tutes so the dancer was p.i.s.sed, but the second she saw the man\u2019s face her face turned red and she docilely followed the man upstairs. The man laughed and put his arms around her to lead her up the stairs and Xiao Yao felt the man looked familiar. Due to the angle and the curtains, she didn\u2019t get a good look at his face until he was on the second floor and Xiao Yao saw his face fully. Her heart thundered and her mouth gaped open \u2013 he looked just like Xiang Liu! But he was wearing fine clothes and his hair was pitch black, and there was mirth in his eyes that was nothing like the normally icy cold Xiang Liu.Xiao Yao stared at him while he swept a glance over her and didn\u2019t even pause. The other man smiled at her and asked \u201cLittle lady, you look nice, tonight you spend with me.\u201dAnother girl grabbed him and coyly said \u201cThis lady is a customer, young master please don\u2019t put us in a bind.\u201dThe man left with the pretty girl while Jin Xuan opened the door and told Xiao Yao to come in.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao left the dance hall the back way and wandered around the city a bit, having dinner at a famous restaurant before getting on the cloud carriage back to Xuan Yuan Mountain.On Cao Yun Peak, Xiao Yao sat on the swing while Zhuan Xu leaned against a tree. She kept wondering, was that Xiang Liu or not Xiang Liu?\u201cGege, have you ever seen Xiang Liu\u2019s real face?\u201d\u201cNo, every time I\u2019ve seen him, he\u2019s wearing a mask.\u201dXiao Yao was curious \u201cXuan Yuan has him on the most wanted list for hundreds of years but there isn\u2019t a portrait to go along with it. All these years and no one has seen what he really looks like?\u201d\u201cPeople have seen it, but Xiang Liu is a Nine-headed demon, and rumor has it that he has nine real faces and also eighty-one different forms. All the people who have seen him have contradictory statements, one time someone described him to look exactly like sixth uncle.\u201dWas the Xiang Liu she saw just one of his faces? Xiao Yao was curious, but also disappointed.Zhuan Xu stared at her \u201cBut it is weird! His transformation ability is one where even a magical object can\u2019t detect it, why does he need to wear a mask? He can just change his face!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cMaybe he\u2019s like me, he wants to have a true self and is uninterested in magical transformations.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cWhy suddenly asking about Xiang Liu?\u201d\u201cI\u2026.I just thought of him.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t want to lie to Zhuan Xu so told him half the truth, and the despondent tone in her voice made Zhuan Xu\u2019s heart hurt a little. He softly said \u201cYou are no longer Qing Shui Town\u2019s Wen Xiao Liu.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI know.\u201dZhuan Xu changed the subject \u201cThe guy who wanted to pick you up at the dance hall is your younger cousin s.h.i.+ Ju, the only son of uncle Cang Lin.\u201d\u201cThe person next to him?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know him but he\u2019s not using transformation or masking spell. Though after what you and Jing did last time, I\u2019m no longer absolutely certain about piercing through transformations.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cThat Jin Xuan is your person?\u201d\u201cI hope so. When Eldest Uncle was alive, he built a vast information network that Auntie Zhu Yu ran. When he died, the network only listened to Auntie. When your mom died, Auntie Zhu Yu was still alive but it stagnated. About a hundred years ago she did bring Jin Xuan to Gao Xing to find me. She handed the network to me per Auntie\u2019s orders before she left for battle. Jin Xuan is also a wood demon. If I am to sit in Eldest Uncle\u2019s spot, then Jin Xuan would sit where Auntie Zhu Yu sat. But whether she is absolutely loyal to me, only time will tell!\u201d\u201cNo matter what, this is your own power.\u201d Xiao Yao looked at him and smiled \u201cPlus with your way with women, I have faith in you.\u201dZhuan Xu covered his mouth and coughed twice and glared at Xiao Yao so she stopped teasing him \u201cI was worried you came back all alone but now I feel better.\u201d\u201cOur elders left us early but they have always been looking out for me. Eldest Uncle is a very powerful capable person, he left me the organization and there are a handful of people left in court loyal to him. My dad left early but I know if one day I controlled the army, they would be deathly loyal to me. My dad could have survived his final battle if he ran away, but he chose to stand in front of all the soldiers and face his own death for their sake. My mom, she left me her entire Ruo Sui tribe of loyal members. And Auntie\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao asked quizzically \u201cWhat did my mom leave you?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and flicked a phoenix flower on Xiao Yao\u2019s face \u201cYou. She left me you.\u201dXiao Yao kicked the fallen phoenix flowers at him \u201cHow dare you mock me!\u201dZhuan Xu laughed and Xiao Yao said \u201cBut what you have isn\u2019t enough yet.\u201dZhuan Xu concurred \u201cNowhere close to being enough, though I also have my guards from Gao Xing which can keep me alive. But this entire court believes uncle will a.s.sume the throne, he once fought alongside grandfather to win the Middle Plains and has lots of battle victories. The army is filled with people who fought with him. He\u2019s also been preparing for hundreds of years and from the Middle Plains to the North and West are his people. There are lots of families like the Fang Feng family who are loyal to him. All I can do now is not die. The rest will take time.\u201dXiao Yao said with a laugh \u201cWhat do you need me to do for you?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou can\u2019t have not known that I\u2019ve been using you all this time?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBe specific so I can see if there is any using I didn\u2019t know about.\u201dZhuan Xu grabbed the swing \u201cLet me think. The obvious things I won\u2019t even bother mention, but the non-obvious things\u2026.like Tu Shan Jing. He wants to get close to you so I gave him the chance. Then he will help me. If it wasn\u2019t him, I wouldn\u2019t have been accepted into that group so easily. Also Feng Long and Xing Yue, I let them know how much I influence you, so when they think of me, they think of your power behind me. These things are small but tip the scale in my favor. In the future, there will be more and more things, and you won\u2019t even realize I\u2019m using you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve done nothing for you.\u201d\u201cYou did a lot, you see me as someone important so I can use you with impunity. Tu Shan Jing isn\u2019t stupid, right now the power is with uncle so helping me is of no use to the Tu Shan clan. But he knows I\u2019m important to you so he stands on my side.\u201d Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cEven though I know you don\u2019t mind getting your hands b.l.o.o.d.y, but I mind. Just stand beside me and that is my greatest help.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and nodded \u201cI understand.\u201dThe second day when Xiao Yao got up, Zhuan Xu was already gone. She went to look for him at the Yellow Emperor\u2019s residence and saw him standing behind him with two other cousins in tow as officials reported something to the Emperor.Xiao Yao waited outside and it wasn\u2019t until dusk that they came out. Xiao Yao hid in the dark and watched them chatting. From the outside they looked like the bestest cousins. Young cousin Cui Liang was seventh uncle Yu Yang\u2019second son and he was saying \u201cTomorrow there is a family banquet, cousins please come.\u201dThe other cousin s.h.i.+ Ju laughed \u201cCousin, you know my personality, if there are beauties then I\u2019m there.\u201dXiao Yao walked over and shot Zhuan Xu a glance but he smiled \u201cIs there good wine? I go for good wine.\u201dXiao Yao had no choice but to pretend to be curious \u201cIf there is something fun, I want in.\u201dCui Liang stared at Xiao Yao until s.h.i.+ Ju shoved him and then he reacted and bowed \u201cif older sister wants to go, then please come.\u201d Except he would need to make new arrangements.After they left, Xiao Yao turned to Zhuan Xu \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me signaling for you not to accept.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cI did but I want to get closer with them since they are the rulers of Xuan Yuan Castle now. If I just arrived and act very aloof, then I\u2019m being rude.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou just got here and haven\u2019t found your bearings yet. They won\u2019t dare hurt you in Cao Yun Peak, but once in Xuan Yuan Castle then that is their territory.\u201d\u201cIf one doesn\u2019t climb up the spiked vines, how does one get to the summit? If I\u2019m not scared, you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s hand was on her chest \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel\u2026..it might not happen\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you tomorrow.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cI have no objection.\u201dThe second night they arrived at Cui Liang\u2019s residence and it was a small private banquet with the connected young men in Xuan Yuan Kingdom. They were polite to Zhuan Xu only on the surface and Xiao Yao sighed, Zhuan Xu really was climbing a steep cliff wall with spiked vines.After the banquet started, seventh uncle\u2019s eldest son Yu Hao arrived and brought the most famous person in the vast wilderness \u2013 the recent victor in Little Zhu Rong\u2019s Autumn Tournament Yu Jiang who was from one of Gao Xing\u2019s four tribes. Everyone saw him and stood up to give him a warm welcome.Yu Hao stood next to Yu Jiang and looked very pleased with himself and made introductions.When Xiao Yao arrived, she asked Ciu Liang not to reveal her ident.i.ty so she could play without reservation. She didn\u2019t want to meet Yu Jiang so went to the gardens for a stroll. She saw the man from the dance hall who looked a lot like Xiang Liu, he was casually sitting on the pallet with his back to the pole, surrounded by flowers and hidden in the shadows, almost impossible to notice him.Xiao Yao softly walked over and stood behind him. She coolly squatted down and suddenly said \u201cXiang Liu, what are you doing here?\u201dThe man barely lifted his head \u201cYou quietly walked behind me and I was wondering what you wanted to do. Clearly I thought wrong since you are mistaken.\u201dXiao Yao looked into his eyes and the man laughed \u201cNow I really want to be the person you mistook for me.\u201dThe bug in Xiao Yao\u2019s body had no reaction so she got confused \u201cYou\u2019re really not him?\u201d\u201cIf you drink with me, I can be him for you.\u201dXiao Yao sweetly smiled \u201cSure!\u201dThe man poured her wine and she gulped it down before pouring him a cup and he gulped it down. A second later, his hand dropped and he wanly smiled \u201cYou poisoned me.\u201dXiao Yao picked up his hand and touched his fingertips which were red because he was poisoned.The man sighed \u201cIf you didn\u2019t poison me, here I was thinking I was about to get lucky.\u201dXiao Yao tossed his hand away and poured him another cup \u201cThis is the antidote.\u201dThe man wearily moved his hand indicating he couldn\u2019t reach for it so Xiao Yao fed it to him.Xiao Yao said \u201cApologizes, I mistook you for someone else.\u201d\u201cEvery time you mistake someone you poison them? That\u2019s a bad habit!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d before turning to leave but the man grabbed her wrist \u201cLeaving with one sorry?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d\u201cI am Fang Feng Bei.\u201d The man wrote the characters of his name on Xiao Yao\u2019s palm \u201cRemember and don\u2019t mistake me again.\u201d\u201cYou are Fang Feng Yi Yang\u2019s\u2026..\u201d\u201cSecond older brother. You know my little sister?\u201dXiao Yao smiled wanly \u201cThis vast wilderness sure is small!\u201dXiao Yao left and this time Fang Feng Bei didn\u2019t stop her.People were enjoying the dancing performances, or drinking and chatting, or playing chess in the pavilion. Zhuan Xu was with s.h.i.+ Ju and other guys discussing something and laughing loudly. Xiao Yao found a quiet corner and sat down.Every detail pointed to Fang Feng Bei was not Xiang Liu. He was the son of a powerful family so lots of people would have known him since birth and there was no way for Xiang Liu to impersonate him. But Xiao Yao felt he was familiar but her mind couldn\u2019t rationalize that feeling of familiarity. She couldn\u2019t explain it either, her body just instinctively felt it.It was deep into the night when the guests started leaving. Perhaps it was because Zhuan Xu lived in Gao Xing for two hundred years, he and Yu Jiang got a long well and talked long after the other guests had left before they headed out together.Xiao Yao waited by the cloud carriage for Zhuan Xu and saw him standing with Yu Jiang by the door chatting.If the person standing beside Zhuan Xu was Fang Feng Bei, then Xiao Yao would be on alert. But Yu Jiang was one of the members of Gao Xing\u2019s four tribes and the tribe that was most loyal to the Grand Emperor. Xiao Yao was therefore relaxed and waiting all bored and looking around.She saw Fang Feng Bei and he was riding on a winged horse at the end of the street. It was dark so she couldn\u2019t clearly see the person on the winged horse but her instinct told her it was him. Xiao Yao squinted into the darkness at the end of the street and thought to herself that all the Fang Feng family members must be crack archers.Suddenly her basic instinct caused her body to tense up and she turned to where she sensed the danger was from. She saw Yu Jiang suddenly attack Zhuan Xu and he was pushed backwards. Yu Jiang was one of the strongest fighters in the vast wilderness so Zhuan Xu could only avoid being hit in his critical parts but continued to be pummeled by the unrelenting Yu Jiang. Every punch was filled with power and the blasts shattered even the jade lion statues in the front of the residence.This was the first time she realized the normally soft water could be so powerfully hard. Xiao Yao screamed \u201cHelp, help!\u201d but not a single guard came. Cui Liang and Yu Hao had fainted by the ripple of Yu Jiang\u2019s power and s.h.i.+ Ju was so scared he was hiding in the cloud carriage and s.h.i.+vering.Xiao Yao realized for the first time that in front of such power no strategy was of any use. At this time, no matter how many smarts she and Zhuan Xu had, only another equally strong power could save Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu was greatly injured and laying on the ground. Yu Jiang picked him up with his eyes blazing hatred and summoned a water sword and sent it slas.h.i.+ng down intending to behead Zhuan Xu.Xiao Yao knew her powers were low but she still rushed forward knowing she would be shattered by Yu Jiang\u2019s water attack. She threw herself on Zhuan Xu and yelled \u201cYu Jiang, do you want to destroy your entire tribe!\u201dYu Jiang\u2019s water sword halted \u201cThis is my own actions, unrelated to my tribe!:\u201cI am the Gao Xing Princess, if I say it\u2019s related then it\u2019s related!\u201d Xiao Yao stood before Yu Jiang and her eyes flashed a coldness that intended to destroy everything.\u201cYou are the Gao Xing Princess, how can you protect an outsider to destroy a Gao Xing tribe?\u201d\u201cWhat about you? In cahoots with others to kill Zhuan Xu and bring upon annihilation for your entire tribe?\u201dYu Jiang raged \u201cI\u2019m not in cahoots with anyone. He killed my older brother, I am getting vengeance for my older brother!\u201d Yu Jiang used his power to toss Xiao Yao aside and she fell hard on the ground and spit up blood.Yu Jiang slashed his water sword towards Zhuan Xu \u201cHe cut off my brother\u2019s head, I will use his head to pray to my brother!\u201dXiao Yao screamed in horror \u201cNo!\u201dYu Jiang didn\u2019t stop and his sword came straight down on Zhuan Xu. Xiao Yao felt her insides ripped to shreds in pain but Zhuan Xu peacefully smiled instead.Suddenly a cold chill descended and wrapped around Zhuan Xu and Yu Jiang and turned Yu Jiang\u2019s water sword into a snow sword. When the snow sword struck Zhuan Xu\u2019s neck, it hurt but crumbled into snow.Yu Jiang\u2019s eyes were blood red in rage and wanted to attack again but an ice wall blocked him. A blue robed Chi Sui Xian walked over through the snow and coldly said \u201cIf you want to fight, let\u2019s go elsewhere.\u201dYu Jiang was filled with rage and sorrow \u201cWhy? You know he killed my brother, why stop me?\u201dChi Sui Xian was as cold as a block of hard ice \u201cWhen you defeat me, perhaps I\u2019ll tell you why.\u201d She turned and walked away and Yu Jiang knew with her around he couldn\u2019t kill Zhuan Xu so followed her.Zhuan Xu struggled to get up but Xiao Yao screamed \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dShe opened her arms and blocked Zhuan Xu\u2019s body and faced towards the darkness. She backed up slowly and Zhuan Xu asked \u201cThe Fang Feng family?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s entire body was tense, like a mother animal protecting her young, glaring in rage towards the darkness. She couldn\u2019t see him, but she instinctively knew he was there and he was holding an arrow that could pierce through Zhuan Xu\u2019s neck at any time.Zhuan Xu\u2019s guards finally broke through the enchantment and arrived to protect him.That person left!Xiao Yao let out her pent up breath and her body relaxed and almost collapsed on the ground. In just a few short seconds, she was in more pain than when Yu Jiang sent her flying with an attack.Zhuan Xu helped Xiao Yao up and she grabbed his hand and got on the cloud carriage. He got in and sat down beside her. Xiao Yao swallowed a pill and then checked Zhuan Xu\u2019s injuries before handing him three pills which he swallowed without a question asked.Xiao Yao said \u201cThere was a guest today, the one who was with s.h.i.+ Ju at the dance hall, his name is Fang Feng Bei.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cThe second son of the family. The Fang Feng clan is very adept at concealment, and paired with their archery skills, that is why they are famous throughout the land. How did you know Fang Feng Bei was there?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a feeling.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a very believable answer but Zhuan Xu believed her since in the split second between life and death he also had similar sensations before.Returning to Cao Yun Court, the phoenix flowers fell and blanketed the air with its fragrance. It was as peaceful as usual and made what just happened feel like a dream except Xiao Yao\u2019s chest still hurt.Xiao Yao wanted to go to her room but Zhuan Xu stopped her \u201cXiao Yao, did tonight startle you?\u201dXiao Yao turned back \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, I\u2019m glad you still have other help and didn\u2019t end up dead because of an unexpected Yu Jiang.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI did keep another help in my back pocket and wouldn\u2019t have died in Yu Jiang\u2019s hand, but later if Fang Feng Bei really fired that arrow, I don\u2019t have faith I would have avoided it.\u201d\u201cWhy did Chi Sui Xian help you?\u201d\u201cI gave the Chi Sui clan one chance to help me, if she didn\u2019t do it then my guards were ready to step in.\u201d\u201cHelp you?\u201d\u201cPeople think only those who receive help are grateful, but forget that those who give help also get their own satisfaction. If I get close to the Chi Sui family too directly, they will be on guard with me. But if I make them feel like they are very powerful and can help me, they will relax their guard. They will see themselves as rich people tossing a beggar a biscuit, thinking they can close the door to the beggar at any time. But they will already have expectations to see what the beggar does in return.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cI think I\u2019m smart enough but compared to you guys, I\u2019m an idiot.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cYou\u2019re not. We strategize and plot because we want something. But you want nothing so you have no need to plot against others. The strongest is those who have no want.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cOkay, I\u2019m the strongest. You\u2019re hurt so get some rest.\u201dZhuan Xu nodded. Today was a double a.s.sa.s.sination attempt. Yu Jiang\u2019s attack was really to set up an opportunity for Fang Feng Bei to kill him for real. Even with his secret guards, but in that moment it was the weak powered Xiao Yao that put him behind her back and used her own body to s.h.i.+eld him.Xiao Yao suddenly said \u201cWhat did Yu Jiang mean that you killed his brother? If so, he\u2019ll come back to kill you.\u201dZhuan Xu furrowed his brows \u201cI don\u2019t know either, I never heard of Yu Jiang having a brother. If he really has such a deep grudge against me, this isn\u2019t good so I\u2019ll send someone to investigate.\u201dA few days later, the report came back.Yu Jiang\u2019s real name was Xuan Ming and his father was a Gao Xing n.o.ble but his mother was a Xuan Yuan woman. When Xiao Yao\u2019s mother married into Gao Xing, the Yellow Emperor selected ten Xuan Yuan ladies to marry into Gao Xing along with the Princess. One woman married a Gao Xing n.o.ble and they had two sons, the eldest was named Xuan Ting and the younger Xuan Ming. After Xiao Yao\u2019s mother divorced the Grand Emperor, the ladies who went with her to Gao Xing all returned to Xuan Yuan with her. Except Yu Jiang\u2019s mother remained but she suffered the strict rules of Gao Xing and had to endure the world\u2019s disdain for the Xuan Yuan Princess divorcing her husband, so she constantly fought with her husband. One fight led to her husband saying he regretted marrying a Xuan Yuan woman who had no manners and didn\u2019t respect her husband. She actually took a page from the Xuan Yuan Princess and divorced her husband and went back to Xuan Yuan with her oldest son.This was too embarra.s.sing so Yu Jiang\u2019s grandfather lied that his daughter-in-law and oldest son died. Yu Jiang\u2019s father didn\u2019t go to Xuan Yuan to get his wife and son back, but also never remarried. Yu Jiang\u2019s mother died shortly after returning to Xuan Yuan, and then his father pa.s.sed after that. Yu Jiang\u2019s grandfather changed his name from Xuan Ming to Yu Jiang and wandered the world together.Yu Jiang grew up with his grandfather while his older brother was raised in Xuan Yuan and later was appointed by the Yellow Emperor to run a castle. But he was infamous for being cruel so before Zhuan Xu left Xuan Yuan, the Yellow Emperor ordered him to arrest and sentence Xuan Ting to death.Yu Jiang found out what happened to his older brother before his grandfather pa.s.sed, but then learned that he was already dead at the hands of Zhuan Xu. He felt Zhuan Xu took his last remaining relative but couldn\u2019t kill Zhuan Xu in Gao Xing territory. He endured until Zhuan Xu left Gao Xing and went back to Xuan Yuan and believed that if he went to Xuan Yuan to kill Zhuan Xu, it was acting alone and wouldn\u2019t get his entire tribe in trouble.Either he used Yu Hao to get close to Zhuan Xu, or Yu Hao and Cui Liang used him to kill Zhuan Xu, either was possible and impossible to suss out now.Xiao Yao listened to his story and felt somewhat sad for Yu Jiang and decided not to tell her dad about it.Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cKilling Xuan Ting was the right thing to do and I don\u2019t regret it. But I do feel bad because his crime was\u2026.\u201d Zhuan Xu sighed \u201cForget it, such dirty history I won\u2019t explain to you.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s injuries healed but Zhuan Xu\u2019s hadn\u2019t but people constantly came to see him and he spent his other free time playing chess with their grandfather or talking with Xiao Yao.When he could move freely again, he summoned Xiao Yao and they picked mulberries and pickled it.By Summertime, Zhuan Xu\u2019s injuries had fully healed and the Yellow Emperor gave him tasks. He started getting busier and even attended Xuan Yuan court matters. To make it easier to meet with people, he set up a residence in Xuan Yuan Castle and when he was too busy he would stay there. Xiao Yao was getting bored at Cao Yun Court so after conferring with the Yellow Emperor, she sometimes went to stay with him in Xuan Yuan Castle.___________________________________________________________________________Once Promised Volume 2 Chapter 17:Ah Heng walked up to the Yellow Emperor \u201cDid Dad you asked Uncle Zhi Muo to come convince me to lead the Xuan Yuan army into battle?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to lead them into battle, but it\u2019s not for you. What happened to you now, you deserve it all! If Xuan Yuan belonged to only you, then its existence or extermination would have nothing to do with me. But the Xuan Yuan Kingdom is not just yours. It was built on the blood sweat and tears of Mom and Uncle Zhi Muo. It was built on the sacrifice of the Xuan Yuan soldiers, it belongs to the Xuan Yuan people.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cWhen Fourth Brother was trapped in Ju Mountain, I asked Shao Hao as the Grand Emperor for his military a.s.sistance. I thought he would do it for the sake of Eldest Brother and their friends.h.i.+p. But he said no\u2026.later Dad you must know that Qi Yo came. He wanted to help me but he could only give he half his strength. It was only the Xuan Yuan soldiers who wanted to save their brother in arms who went into battle knowing they would die and still they did it. That was when I truly understood that the blood ties of an entire tribe was so deep, the meaning and power of a kingdom so vast. Even if I don\u2019t acknowledge you, I\u2019m willing to protect this kingdom you rule and die for it! I just learned Uncle Zhi Muo\u2019s only son died on Ju Mountain as well like Fourth Brother did. All over Xuan Yuan Kingdom there are dead sons leaving orphans and widows. I once couldn\u2019t understand why Fourth Brother went into battle to die, did he not love sister-in-law? How could he also leave little Zhuan Xu behind? But now I can understand Fourth Brother. The people of Xuan Yuan did not fail me, so I cannot fail them!\u201dAh Heng kneeled before the Yellow Emperor \u201cDad, if I protect Xuan Yuan for you, will you protect Zhuan Xu?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor solemnly replied \u201cI swear on the empire I am building, no one will ever harm Zhuan Xu. I will teach him well and everything you are protecting will one day belong to him.\u201dWith such a solemn swear, Ah Heng had no further lingering worries so she bowed her head three times before leading Zhuan Xu out the door.Xiao Yao was swinging on the swing all alone and bored. When she saw them, her eyes lit up and she immediately leaped off the swing and rushed over.Ah Heng took one child in each hand \u201cLet\u2019s go see grandmother and uncles.\u201dAlong the way there, Xiao Yao chatted non-stop but Zhuan Xu bit his lip and said nothing. When they arrived at the graves, Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu both bowed.Ah Heng embraced Zhuan Xu and said \u201cYour grandmother didn\u2019t want to be buried here in Xuan Yuan, in her will she asked to be returned to her homeland the Blue Dragon\u2019s Head. But your grandmother was the Empress and your grandfather refused to honor her wishes and send her so far away. I might not be able to honor that wish for her as well so can you promise your Auntie something? One day when you can make the decisions, please re-bury your grandmother at Blue Dragon\u2019s Head. No matter whatever objections come your way, never ever bury your grandfather with your grandmother.\u201dZhuan Xu nodded his head firmly \u201cI promise. I will honor Grandmother\u2019s last wishes, I will never bury Grandfather with Grandmother.\u201dAh Heng pulled Xiao Yao into her arms \u201cXiao Yao, tomorrow Mom will be taking you somewhere.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cA place Mom lived once before. It\u2019s very beautiful and peach blossom trees blooms all over. The peach blossoms bloom in all four seasons.\u201d\u201cWill Gege come with us?\u201d\u201cYour Gege has things he must do, he can\u2019t go with you.\u201d\u201cOh. How long are we going for?\u201dAh Heng didn\u2019t answer and just smiled \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys go play now. Mom wants to talk alone with your grandmother and uncles for a little bit.\u201dXiao Yao made a face towards Zhuan Xu and skipped off to pick wild flowers. Zhaun Xu stood there not moving \u201cAuntie, are you really going into battle?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWill it be dangerous?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cCan you not go?\u201dAh Heng shook her head and there were tears in Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes and he asked \u201cWhy take Xiao Yao away? Can\u2019t you leave her here? I\u2019ll take care of her.\u201dAh Heng put her hands on his little shoulders \u201cI know that you are a good older brother! But you are still small and your duty is to learn. Your grandfather used his entire empire to swear that he will take good care of you so I\u2019m not worried about your welfare. But Xiao Yao\u2019s birth is not like you. In the future perhaps there will be many who want to kill her. I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll be a burden for you. So I need to take her somewhere absolutely safe.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried of being burdened.\u201dAh Heng smiled \u201cBut right now you don\u2019t even have the ability to protect yourself, you have even less ability to protect her. It\u2019s not enough to not be scared or worried.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s little hands were clenched tightly into fists and his chest was rising and falling rapidly. After a long time, he asked in a muted voice \u201cWhen can my little sister come back then?\u201d\u201cMaybe soon.\u201d Ah Heng was silent for a bit and then forced a smile \u201cOr maybe when you have the ability to protect your little sister.\u201dZhuan Xu lowered his head and mumbled \u201cI understand.\u201d He wiped his tears and turned around to run off.Xiao Yao stood in the center of a field of wild flowers and waved happily \u201cGege, I\u2019m here.\u201dZhuan Xu ran up to her \u201cWhat kind of flowers do you want, I\u2019ll pick it for you.\u201dXiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head and stared at him strangely. Zhuan Xu was always very strict with himself and normally never agreed to play with her. Today he actually wanted to pick flowers for her?Zhuan Xu angrily asked \u201cDo you want me to or not?\u201d\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d Xiao Yao grabbed Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand \u201cI like this kind of red flowers and want to make a flower crown.\u201dZhuan Xu picked a lot of the red flowers and made a flower crown and put it on Xiao Yao\u2019s head.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cAre you sad I\u2019m leaving?\u201dZhuan Xu rolled his eyes at her \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to leave!\u201dXiao Yao took off the white fox tail accessory around her waist. This was the fox tail that the big baddie Qi Yo cut off that her mother saw her playing with it every day so she made it into an accessory that she would wear on her.\u201cYou can have this.\u201dZhuan Xu silently accepted it, his hands brus.h.i.+ng over the soft fur. He knew Xiao Yao loved this very much and wanted to give it back to her when Xiao Yao thought about it and still was reluctant to part with it so she added \u201cWait for me to come back and you give it back to me. I\u2019m just lending it to you to play with so don\u2019t break it.\u201dZhuan Xu burst out laughing and decided not to give it right back to her. He put it around his waist and walked back to find his Auntie. Xiao Yao followed behind and kept nattering \u201cDon\u2019t lose it, don\u2019t ruin it. My dad told me this was the tail of a nine-tailed fox and is very precious.\u201dZhuan Xu stopped and Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d She glanced where Zhuan Xu was looking and saw her mother sitting in front of the series of graves.Various colorful flowers bloomed on the graves but the view remain desolate and her mother\u2019s figure looked so pitiful and alone. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand the feeling, she just felt her heart was very tight.Xiao Yao wanted to call out to Zhuan Xu but when she saw the look in his eyes, her heart felt even worse and she didn\u2019t dare to even open her mouth. She felt like if she said even one word, the tears would start falling. She softly tugged Zhuan Xu\u2019s sleeve.Zhuan Xu bit his lip hard and said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, let\u2019s head over.\u201d He pulled Xiao Yao behind him and walked over. Xiao Yao put the flower crown on her mom\u2019s head \u201cMom, this is for you. I made it with Gege.\u201d Ah Heng laughed and hugged them both.__________________________________The Royal Mother stood at the edge of the cliff watching the clouds and the lights dance before her.The three best friends who once played the world together, two of them were dead and only the Royal Mother remained under the twilight.Ah Heng walked up to the Royal Mother, and perhaps with the final knot in her heart unraveled the Royal Mother\u2019s expression was tender despite the fierceness that remained in her eyes \u201cDo you have anything else?\u201d\u201cI want to entrust my daughter to you.

    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe last chapter of Lost You Forever was a much needed dense back story of Xiao Yao and her cousin Zhuan Xu, but it also pushed the story forward in a new direction now that everyone is back at Xuan Yuan Mountain. From the Southern tips of Gao Xing to the Northern edges of Xuan Yuan, the vast wilderness is great indeed and any ambitious leader wanting to rule over it all would find that getting there is merely the tip of the iceberg. I feel like Xiao Yao doesn\u2019t really have a purpose in life but that\u2019s fine with me. When she was Wen Xiao Liu we saw her do a lot of good as a healer and family provider, but it wasn\u2019t like she had greater aspirations. To live is all she wanted, and if she was lucky she would be able to live and enjoy the life she is living. Right now she\u2019s lucky because she\u2019s back to being a Princess with all the trappings of wealth and power but none of the hands dirtying stuff. While Zhuan Xu is off plotting how to wrestle power from his uncles and cousins, XIao Yao gets to poke around and wonder what she wants to do? Jing still has years left to fulfill his promise to marry her but she\u2019s hardly the type to sit and embroider and gossip with other girls. Our impertinent and odd little tomboy princess has one hobby and one hobby only \u2013 concocting poisons. Will she find a new playmate now that Xiang Liu can\u2019t swing on by whenever he wants anymore? Or will she find a new hobby, one less dangerous to others and maybe equal helpful to her own well being. And how is the person who hates waiting going to handle actually waiting for Jing to free himself and come be with her? She promised not to let another man into her heart, but what if there already is another man in her heart before she made that promise?Chapter 16 \u2013 Missing You, Hating You,\u00a0It\u2019s Not Worth It:From their Ying Province island parting until now, it had gone from Winter to Summer and half a year had pa.s.sed. Jing only contacted Xiao Yao once, to thank Zhuan Xu for his hospitality and in the thank you gift package there were nine bottles of green plum wine. Zhuan Xu might not know what was meant for Xiao Yao in the gift package but he guessed it wasn\u2019t all meant for him. He got the present and called Xiao Yao over \u201cI don\u2019t understand your secret language. You go pick it out.\u201dXiao Yao picked out the nine bottles of plum wine all in white jade bottles with a row of red plum blossoms. It was very ordinary bottles but Xiao Yao felt a warmth surrounding her.Those nine bottles accompanied Xiao Yao from Five G.o.ds Mountain to Cao Yun Court in Xuan Yuan Mountain.The plum wine, Xiao Yao drank it slowly until she had only one bottle left. She was reluctant to drink it and held on to it while putting the eight finished bottles away.She wanted to drink the last bottle but wanted to wait for another new batch to arrive before drinking it.Late at night she would play with the bottles in bed. Sometimes Xiao Yao would smile, but sometimes she would feel sorry for herself.She waited half a year and never heard again from Jing.One night, she laid on the pallet playing with the nine bottles, rolling them around on the blanket. It rested on the white sheets and the nine cherry blossoms bloomed brightly. Xiao Yao suddenly thought of Jade Mountain, she waited for her mother there for seventy years and never got anything. In her lifetime, she never wanted to wait for another person again.Xiao Yao opened the last bottle and instead of drinking it slowly, she downed it all at once. She put the nine bottles away and never took it out to play with again.Xiao Yao started spending more time developing her poisons. Late into the night, she would lay on the pallet playing with her poisons and thinking of how to make it even better in terms of prettier and not necessarily more poisonous.She had memorized the Sheng Nong Herb Manuel left by the Flame Emperor, who the entire world regarded as the progenitor of medicine. She also flipped through all the Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan medical books. She didn\u2019t doubt her poisons ability to be deadly, she just wanted to make it look pretty. She stared at the phoenix flower and researched a few days and worked a few nights and finally created a perfect replica of the small red phoenix flower with the same intoxicating fragrance. She made the poison layered on it like the morning dew.Every one of her poisons was one of her longing, one of her missing, one of her feelings. She created it and watched it come to life in her hands, and then carefully put it away to send out.Xiao Yao wondered what Xiang Liu would think when he saw the poisons? Would he call her a weirdo pervert?Xiao Yao put the finished poisons in boxes and went to the messenger service ran by the Tu Shan clan and handed it to them \u201cDeliver this to the Qing Shui Town brothel.\u201dXiao Yao paid the expensive price to deliver it to the edge of Xuan Yuan and didn\u2019t blink an eye since it wasn\u2019t her money.This was Xiao Yao\u2019s solution to deal with Xiang Liu. The entire world was covered with the Tu Shan messenger network so if Xiao Yao had money then she could send it to Qing Shui Town. She had been sending him poisons every 3-4 months, the last time sent from Gao Xing. She wondered if Xiang Liu got it? He ought to, otherwise with his petty personality, no matter how busy he was he would find time to cause her trouble.Xiao Yao walked out and saw Fang Feng Bei. She couldn\u2019t resist and used her bug to sense him but still got no response.Fang Feng Bei smiled as he walked over \u201cDelivering something?\u201dXiao Yao smiled at him and he asked \u201cYou still remember me, yes?\u201dXiao Yao walked off \u201cYou should stay away from me, when I see you I want to poison you.\u201dFang Feng Bei followed her \u201cYou find that friend of yours that distasteful?She found Xiang Liu distasteful? Of course not, likely he\u2019s the one who found her distasteful.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d That meeting in the garden, he likely didn\u2019t know who she was, but now he had to know.\u201cI\u2019m bored. I can see you\u2019re bored. Two people bored together is better than one.\u201dThat night, the spectre of death radiating from the tip of his arrow, Xiao Yao still remembered it vividly. She sneered \u201cWhat are you doing here in Xuan Yuan Castle? Not here to be bored?\u201dFang Feng Bei chuckled \u201cAll the things I came to do in Xuan Yuan Castle can\u2019t see the light of day and has to wait until night. I really am supremely bored during the day.\u201dXiao Yao was speechless \u2013 this guy\u2019s personality was diametrically opposite to his little sister, he was so blatant it was refres.h.i.+ng \u201cI hear your entire family are crack archers?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cWho is better between you and your little sister?\u201d\u201cHer.\u201d\u201cBetter to what degree?\u201d\u201cYou want to see my archery skills?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen follow me!\u201dFang Feng Bei returned to his residence and called for his winged horse. He then left the castle with Xiao Yao and arrived at Dun Wu Mountain.Fang Feng Bei asked \u201cWhat do you want me to shoot?\u201dXiao Yao narrowed her eyes and then pointed at the tree on the opposite cliff \u201cThat tree\u2019s flower blooms a little yellow bud in the Summer. Shoot the flower bud.\u201dFang Feng Bei took his bow, his arrow, put the arrow on the bow, pulled back, and released.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cNot clear if you hit it.\u201dFang Feng Bei reached out his hand and the arrow flew back from the opposite cliff. He handed it to her and there was yellow on the tip, he clearly hit the yellow bud.Xiao Yao was impressed \u201cAmazing archery skills.\u201d\u201cWant to learn?\u201d\u201cThis can be taught?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re learning archery form and not the power behind the shot. Anyone can teach you, but if I teach you it will be ideal.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t figure out what Fang Feng Bei wanted but just like he said, she was bored so went along.Fang Feng Bei picked a nearby big tree \u201cUse that at a target.\u201d He handed the bow to Xiao Yao and she mimicked his form and pulled the bow back.Fang Feng Bei said \u201cNot bad, you have some form. Your body needs to be straight \u2013 don\u2019t bend the neck, don\u2019t stick your elbows out, don\u2019t lean forward, don\u2019t puff out your chest.\u201d He corrected Xiao Yao\u2019s form \u201cYour power is weak so you should use four fingers to hold the bow. Your thumb will naturally face inward and your forefinger facing down. The bow to your nose\u2026.\u201dHe handed an arrow to Xiao Yao and she let it fly, it flew out but fell a short distance away.He picked another arrow and it was the same as before.After shooting a few successive arrows, Xiao Yao\u2019s arrow was stronger than before but nowhere close to the big tree. Xiao Yao sighed \u201cLooks easy, hard to do.\u201dFang Feng Bei walked in back of Xiao Yao and grabbed her hand, guiding it to follow his movements \u201cBody straight, senses calm, focused and relaxed, pus.h.i.+ng forward and following behind, bow c.o.c.ked arrow flying!\u201d With the word \u201cflying\u201d the arrow few out and solidly embedded in the tree.\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d\u201cThinking of nothing, eyes not on the target, focused only on the arrow movement.\u201d\u201cYou have natural apt.i.tude.\u201dXiao Yao smiled wanly. It wasn\u2019t that she had natural apt.i.tude, it was that her body reacted the same way when Xiang Liu got close to her. She felt that he would bite down on her neck so her mind was blank. But if it was Xiang Liu, even if he was in cahoots with the Fang Feng family, there was no way the family archery skill would be pa.s.sed to a Nine-headed demon.Fang Feng Bei guided Xiao Yao to shoot another arrow \u201cMaintain this feeling and continue.\u201dXiao Yao released another arrow which still didn\u2019t hit the tree but got close. She really got interested and immediately released another arrow which struck the tree. She was incredulous \u201cI hit it?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled and Xiao Yao grabbed another arrow and mimicked the sensation but it fell midway just like her first arrow. Fang Feng Bei said \u201cYou are too overeager.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t believe it and wanted to try again but he stopped her \u201cThis is enough for today.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t understand \u201cI want to practice more.\u201d\u201cIf you practice more, you\u2019ll get worse. The mistaken feeling will be repeated until you remember it. Trust me, things are better when one knows when to stop early.\u201dXiao Yao put down the bow \u201cIf you want to be a Master, your disciples will love you.\u201dFang Feng Bei laughed \u201cEveryone is different, my method only works on the smart.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201dFang Feng Bei vaulted on his winged horse and the two rode the horse slowly down the mountain. Xiao Yao said \u201cI notice your powers are far greater than Yi Yang, how come your archery skills are less than hers?\u201dFang Feng Bei laughed \u201cMany think archery requires vast arm strength but it\u2019s more based on clever strength. A specifically designed arrow can pierce through thick mystical enchantments so even someone without any power can hit a target vastly more powerful. My spiritual powers are much greater than my little sister but my archery technique cannot match up to her.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Fang Feng Bei and her heart started to swell. Her powers were weak and all she wanted was to survive so she long stopped attacking as a strategy. But if what Fang Feng Bei said was true, then within a certain distance she could attack as well. If she ran into another incident like the attempt on Zhuan Xu\u2019s life, she could do more than s.h.i.+eld him with her body.Fang Feng Bei appeared not to notice that what he said had an impact on Xiao Yao and he asked with a smile \u201cWant to learn archery from me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cIf you help me while the time away, then I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dXiao Yao responded \u201cSure.\u201dFang Feng Bei dropped Xiao Yao off at Zhuan Xu\u2019s residence \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d Xiao Yao watched him ride off on his winged horse like a carefree rich boy sauntering down the street.Xiao Yao\u2019s life suddenly become extraordinarily busy. She had to make poisons, she had to practice archery, and when Fang Feng Bei had time, she had to learn from him and go along with him to find entertainment.After Xiao Yao hung out with Fang Feng Bei was when she truly learned what it meant to eat, drink, and be merry. She discovered Xuan Yuan Castle anew, so many places hidden in the small alleys that even her cousins didn\u2019t know, Fang Feng Bei knew.He was like an expert taking Xiao Yao along to eat, drink, and be merry.The jewelry shops run by the dwarves with their little hands and exquisite craftsmans.h.i.+p was delightful. They turned a red ruby into a rose, carving a pair of lovers into a dew drop pendant. Xiao Yao was so enchanted she picked a few accessories for Ah Nian and Consort Jing An.The giants with their huge bowls that was like a bucket for Xiao Yao to eat out of, initially she didn\u2019t think she would finish it but after one bite she kept on eating until she scarfed it all down. Afterwards she moaned that she was going to burst but had no regrets if she died this way.The cosmetics store owned by the flower demons which initially didn\u2019t interest Xiao Yao. Their flower cream would leave a scent on for a month, all the various floral scented perfumes and the unique ways of mixing scents to create new scents that even Xiao Yao who was used to living as a man couldn\u2019t help but be enticed and she ended up buying tens of different scents.Fang Feng Bei wasn\u2019t free every day and usually came by every 5-6 days for Xiao Yao to hang out with him. It so happened to give Xiao Yao enough time to practice her archery from what he taught her in their last meeting. Though one time he disappeared for three months before suddenly showing up. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t ask where he went and he didn\u2019t offer an explanation. Xiao Yao knew their relations.h.i.+p where he taught her archery was just temporary and could end with any little mishap.But in the eyes of outsiders, Xiao Yao was getting very close to Fang Feng Bei. Because he was teaching her archery, there was an indelible closeness between her and Xiao Yao.Fang Feng Bei was very casual so when he came looking for Xiao Yao, if she was up in Cao Yun Peak then he would go up Xuan Yuan Mountain and ask a guard to summon her. Xiao Yao felt no need to conceal anything so their coming and going together was soon spread all over Xuan Yuan Castle that the Gao Xing Eldest Princess and the Fang Feng family\u2019s second son was very close.Even Zhuan Xu teased her \u201cI just got you back and want you around a few more years. Don\u2019t get lured off by that Fang Feng family playboy.\u201dXiao Yao stuck her tongue out at him \u201cAs long as he can shoot you with an arrow, I\u2019ll never run away with him.\u201dWithout her realizing it, a year had pa.s.sed.Xiao Yao was confused and didn\u2019t know what Fang Feng Bei was thinking. She thought he taught her archery as an excuse to get close to her. She thought him taking her out to play was a technique to get into a woman\u2019s heart. But he was very serious when he taught her and every time Xiao Yao was learning archery she really respected him as her teacher.When they were out playing, it was like the two of them was just enjoying life. Two people who didn\u2019t care about anything, who was willing to try everything, became partners venturing out into the dizzying world. Many things in life, it feels different doing it alone or with a companion. Dining, no matter how delicious, just doesn\u2019t taste as good alone. Xiao Yao believed Fang Feng Bei also understood how she felt which is why he never hesitated and introduced her to everything he could think of and then took her to experience it.Xiao Yao sometimes felt Fang Feng Bei was like a child who was lonely for too long. He had played with too many toys alone and it was no longer interesting. Now he had a companion, he couldn\u2019t wait to take her to play, to experience what he tried. It appeared just casual but was in truth very sincere.Gradually, Xiao Yao started sincerely eating, drinking, and being merry with him. As long as Fang Feng Bei wasn\u2019t aiming a bow and arrow at Zhuan Xu, then he wasn\u2019t her enemy.This day, in the morning Fang Feng Bei taught her archery, in the afternoon they went to the dance hall to have lunch and nap, and later Fang Feng Bei took Xiao Yao to an underground gambling den run by the Li Jie Tribe. Legend had it the tribe\u2019s ancestor was the two-headed dog demon, and maybe for that reason, all the men entering the gambling den had to wear a dog mask while the ladies could do as they wished. Xiao Yao saw that Fang Feng Bei wearing the mask looked like a dog head on a man\u2019s body and guffawed loudly at the sight. She put on a mask as well and gestured her hands like claws and barked like a dog. Fang Feng Bei laughed \u201cIf you get a beat down by the Li Jie tribe and tossed out of here, don\u2019t blame me.\u201dWalking into the underground gambling den, everywhere was the sight of a dog head on a man\u2019s body. Because everyone didn\u2019t have a face, they also behaved as if they didn\u2019t care about their reputations. It was raunchy and racy everywhere, so sensual it was erotic. Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei walked through the crowds and remained nonplussed.Fang Feng Bei took Xiao Yao to the dice table first and she spent five years in a casino before so she kept on winning as did Fang Feng Bei, though both knew when to stop and not upset the house.They went to watch the slave fights and used their winnings to wager. The two slaves would fight until one died and there were people cheering all around them at the fight whereas neither Xiao Yao nor Fang Feng Bei seemed affected.The losing side was a pile of b.l.o.o.d.y flesh while the winner was huddled in the corner with a pair of dead cold eyes. This time Xiao Yao lost while Fang Feng Bei won.Xiao Yao scoffed \u201cYou got lucky.\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cLet\u2019s bet again, whatever you pick.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s keep wagering on that slave.\u201d\u201cYou want to come back tomorrow to see him battle to the death again?\u201d\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t you see his eyes? That was a pair of eyes that has lost all hope. Let\u2019s bet on who can give him back hope in an instant.\u201dFang Feng Bei chuckled \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Since you lost earlier, I\u2019ll let you go first as an advantage.\u201dXiao Yao walked over and the slave grabbed her hand and was about to crush it when he realized from years of battles that her hands had very low powers and couldn\u2019t hurt anyone. Plus his animal beast instinct told him that Xiao Yao meant no harm. He hesitated and let her go.The slave owner came over to shoo Xiao Yao away but Fang Feng Bei\u2019s long legs blocked his path and he tossed the winnings from the slave fight to him. The owner picked up the money and moved aside.Xiao Yao took off her dog mask and smiled at the slave before suddenly tightly embracing him and whispering in his ear \u201cThis world has something beautiful in it that is worth you remaining alive for.\u201d She put on the mask again and walked back. The bloodied slave stared at her confused like he had no idea what just happened.Fang Feng Bei was bowled over with his body shaking in laughter that he could barely contain.Xiao Yao pouted \u201cYour turn.\u201dFang Feng Bei walked over and leaned down to say something to the slave. His eyes suddenly lit up and he seemed very agitated yet in disbelief. He stared at Fang Feng Bei who solemnly nodded his head before walking back. The slave seemed to have become another person and when his owner led him away, his footsteps were firm and alive.Fang Feng Bei laughed \u201cI won.\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t believe it, even if Fang Feng Bei promised to buy the slave\u2019s freedom, the slave was so jaded he couldn\u2019t believe him, and that didn\u2019t seem like what he said either.She muttered \u201cYou cheated, you must know him. No wonder you bet on him to win.\u201d\u201cI met him for the first time tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t figure it out.The two of them arrived at the entrance to the gambling den and Fang Feng Bei took off his mask. When they stepped outside it was already dark out and Xiao Yao took a deep breath of the crisp air.She said \u201cI really want to know what you said to him.\u201dFang Feng Bei laughed \u201cIf you hug me too, then I\u2019ll tell you. Your beauty scheme was no use on him, but it\u2019ll work on me.\u201dXiao Yao stomped her foot \u201cForget it!\u201dShe huffed off angrily and Fang Feng Bei followed behind her \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to know anymore!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to know!\u201dFang Feng Bei grabbed her arm and tried to placate her \u201cBut I want to tell you, can you please hear it.\u201dXiao Yao controlled the smile at the corner of her lips \u201cHow are you going to beg me to listen?\u201d\u201cI hug you once? I\u2019m willing to use my handsome man wiles on you.\u201dXiao Yao was angry and amused and shoved him \u201cFang Feng Bei, you\u2019re toying with me!\u201dFang Feng Bei laughed and held onto her arm \u201cI told him that I was once a slave in the death battle matches, yet I survived.\u201dXiao Yao stood still and stared in anger \u201cYou lied to him!\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cHope is but a lie.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s anger dissipated but she shook her head \u201cHe is locked in a cage but he\u2019s a very smart beast. He wouldn\u2019t have believed you that easily. What else did you do?\u201d\u201cI used the code word that only the slaves in the death match battle arenas would know.\u201dXiao Yao was shocked \u201cEven the slave owners don\u2019t know the code. How do you?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cMaybe I really was once a slave in the death match battles.\u201dXiao Yao stared at him for some time and murmured \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cWho do you want me to be?\u201dXiao Yao put one hand on her heart and slowly extended the other hand and placed it on Fang Feng Bei\u2019s heart. His heart was beating at the exact same rhythm as her heart.Xiao Yao was confused. She once thought he was Xiang Liu, who had nine-heads and eighty-one forms. So perhaps one of his forms was Fang Feng Bei. But Fang Feng Bei was so different than Xiang Liu.He took her to buy makeup and skin creams, laying lazily on the pallet watching her try things on and make her picks. Once a woman got into it, the time would fly and Xiao Yao forgot how long she stayed in that store trying on the various scents. She smelled so much for so long her nose wasn\u2019t even working by the end, and when she couldn\u2019t decide, she would ask him to sniff and give her an opinion. He patiently sniffed each one and provided his opinion.When they ate together, Xiao Yao loved eating the filling of a crispy biscuit and he would always peel off the outside of his and put the filling on her plate. When they were eating barbecue, her favorite was the neck area where there was a piece that was juicy with thin skin and he would always grill that piece until it was nicely crisped before handing it to her.When they walked along a narrow mountain path, he would always have her walk ahead of him because when the person in front pa.s.sed tree branches or bushes the person in back would often be hit by the swinging branches.How could Xiang Liu tenderly talk with her, carefully take care of her, patiently spend time with her? Only Fang Feng Bei that playboy would know a woman\u2019s heart so well.But as time went on, even if she still had that niggling feeling, she had accepted Fang Feng Bei was just Fang Feng Bei. But right now\u2026.she felt again that he was Xiang Liu. No reason, impossible to explain, but she just felt that he was.She said \u201cOur hearts are beating as one.\u201d She raised her head to look at Fang Feng Bei and waited for him to give her an explanation.Fang Feng Bei\u2019s hand closed around her hand and he smiled \u201cYes, it sure seems like it\u2019s really beating together.\u201dThis b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Xiao Yao was exasperated but could do nothing to him. She could only grit her teeth and stare at him as he smiled and stared back at her.The lamp post in the waning dusk cast its yellow light on them standing there staring at each other.A carriage stopped beside them and the curtain was raised as Fang Feng Yi Yang incredulously called out \u201cSecond brother?\u201dFang Feng Bei was very nonchalant and said with a smile \u201cLittle sister, no time no see.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s body stiffened because she sensed someone else was looking at her.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know what to feel. She had been learning archery from Fang Feng Bei for 16 months and with the Tu Shan clan\u2019s information network and her and Fang Feng Bei\u2019s ident.i.ties, Jing must have heard about it a long time ago. Or perhaps in the beginning before she really understood Fang Feng Bei\u2019s devil may care att.i.tude, she never believed he would really teach her archery so she wasn\u2019t even learning in earnest. She didn\u2019t reject Fang Feng Bei getting close because she wanted the news that she was hanging out with him to spread across all the powerful families and reach Jing. Xiao Yao wanted Jing to know but she didn\u2019t know why she did that. She just wanted to do it so she did it.Later Xiao Yao realized she was mistaken about Fang Feng Bei and he really was teaching her archery. She began to learn in earnest and gradually she felt her initial purpose wasn\u2019t important, but she still waited for how Jing would respond. But after 16 months she had totally given up waiting and felt she was so lame. Thank goodness Fang Feng Bei turned out to exceed her initial expectations otherwise it wouldn\u2019t just be lame, it would have been pathetic.But just as she had forgotten, he suddenly appeared and even brought along his fiancee!Fang Feng Yi Yang got off the carriage as did Tu Shan Jing. Fang Feng Bei smiled \u201cYou must be the Young Master of Qing Qiu. I\u2019ve heard the great reputation of my future brother-in-law. Nice to meet you finally.\u201dFang Feng Yi Yang said to Jing \u201cThis is my second brother.\u201dJing said nothing for a moment, and as someone who once saw Xiang Liu\u2019s \u201creal face\u201d like Xiao Yao, his reaction was likely the same as Xiao Yao when she first saw Fang Feng Bei. A moment later he bowed politely \u201cGreetings second brother.\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled and turned \u201cLet me introduce you to\u2026.\u201dFang Feng Yi Yang rudely cut him off \u201cSecond brother, no need to introduce your friend to us.\u201d Yi Yang only saw Xiao Yao once at the ceremony dressed in formal attire, but today Xiao Yao was out dressed in casual Xuan Yuan attire and she was currently standing to the side with her head lowered. Yi Yang probably a.s.sumed that a girl with her second brother out late at night and all alone must not be a decent girl so she didn\u2019t want to meet her. She never recognized Xiao Yao.Fang Feng Bei smiled and really made no move to introduce Xiao Yao.Yi Yang asked \u201cWhere is second brother staying? Tu Shan clan has a residence here and you can stay with us.\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cNo need.\u201dThe normally silent Jing suddenly spoke \u201cYi Yang really misses you, the residence is very big and comfortable, second brother please come.\u201dYi Yang glanced in shock at Jing, feeling happy that he treated her family so well and giving her face.Bei laughed \u201cYour hospitality is hard to turn down but no need for tonight. I have to take my friend home but I\u2019ll move in tomorrow.\u201dJing said \u201cWhere is second brother going? The carriage is very s.p.a.cious and we can take you.\u201dBei turned him down \u201cNo need to bother, we were in a gambling den for hours and need to move around now.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Bei waved at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao followed him without hesitation, and from the moment Jing arrived until she left, she never once looked at him.Jing stared at her disappearing form.Yi Yang sighed at her second brother leaving \u201cRumor has it he got really close with the Gao Xing Princess this past year and I thought he finally met a girl who could change him and make him give his real feelings, but he\u2019s still the same.\u201dJing said nothing and silently got back in the carriage and closed his eyes. All he could see was the way Xiao Yao and Bei were standing there looking at each other under the lamp light, and the indescribable feeling that was transpiring between them.Xiao Yao returned to Zhuan Xu\u2019s residence and hurriedly went to find him \u201cZhuan Xu, Zhuan Xu.\u201d She pushed open the door and saw Ah Nian and Hai Tang.Xiao Yao was stunned and looked at Zhuan Xu who smiled \u201cAh Nian came to Xuan Yuan Castle for a visit.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cShe snuck out?\u201d How could the Gao Xing Princess show up here and no one reported to the Yellow Emperor.Zhuan Xu smiled wearily \u201cI\u2019m sure Master knows.\u201dXiao Yao knew her dad knew already and allowed it otherwise Hai Tang would never have the guts to help Ah Nian sneak out. Her daddy was really weird that way, he allowed his daughters to do whatever they wanted outside. Take her and Fang Feng Bei, it wasn\u2019t a big deal here in Xuan Yuan and her grandfather said nothing, but her dad also said nothing and simply asked casually about Fang Feng Bei in one sentence in one letter.Ah Nian asked \u201cGege, are you unhappy I came?\u201dZhuan Xu gently said \u201cOf course not, you came to see me and Xiao Yao, I\u2019m very happy.\u201dAh Nian sneered at Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019m just here to see Gege.\u201dZhuan Xu asked Xiao Yao \u201cWhat were you rus.h.i.+ng in here to talk to me about?\u201d\u201cI ran into Tu Shan Jing and Fang Feng Yi Yang on the street.\u201d\u201cOh, they arrived this afternoon, and in a few days, Feng Long and Xing Yue will be here as well.\u201d\u201cWhat happened that brings them all here?\u201dZhuan Xu explained \u201cXiao Yao, this is Xuan Yuan Castle! Half the proclamations and decrees that affect the vast wilderness originate from here. No matter Chi Sui, Tu Shan, or Sheng Nong, Fang Feng, their families futures are tightly linked to the decisions and information coming out of this castle. Every family and clan sends their kids here every few years to stay for a period of time. The closer friends will make plans to come at the same time.\u201dXiao Yao was silent and seemed disappointed so Zhuan Xu asked \u201cWhat is it?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cI\u2019m going to wash up and sleep.\u201dZhuan Xu led Ah Nian out \u201cI\u2019ll take you to your room and you can stay here. Since you snuck here, if people ask just say you are Xiao Yao\u2019s friend. But I need to tell my grandfather and if he asks to see you then I\u2019ll take you to see him.\u201dAh Nian obediently nodded but asked angrily \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be your friend? Why do I have to be Xiao Yao\u2019s friend?\u201d\u201cBecause Gege\u2019s powers are limited right now and its dangerous to be my friend. It\u2019s safer to be your older sister\u2019s friend.\u201dAh Nian usually was clueless about the little things but surprisingly understanding about the big picture. She immediately gleaned a lot from what Zhuan Xu said \u201cGege, don\u2019t worry, I know this place is not Gao Xing. I won\u2019t make trouble for you.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly blurst out laughing at that and Ah Nian glared \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201dXiao Yao arrived at her room and stepped inside \u201cI. Wait. With. Bated. Breath.\u201d before closing the door and avoiding Ah Nian\u2019s eruption.Zhuan Xu comforted Ah Nian \u201cI know Ah Nian is the most understanding, don\u2019t let your sister get to you.\u201d Ah Nian smiled at that and followed Zhuan Xu to her own room.The next day Xiao Yao left a note for Zhuan Xu and went back to Cao Yun Peak. Knowing Jing\u2019s friends.h.i.+p with Zhuan Xu, he would undoubtedly come see him but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to wait for him anymore. With time pa.s.sing and the feeling of waiting getting worse, she chose not to wait anymore. This time whether he came, when he came, none of that involved her anymore.Xiao Yao practiced her archery in the mulberry forest for a long time before putting it away.\u201cYou\u2019re in a bad mood today.\u201d The Yellow Emperor\u2019s voice boomed.He was holding a walking stick and standing in the mulberry forest. Xiao Yao walked over and helped him sit down on the pallet and she also sat down before picking up a plate of iced mulberries and munching on it. Probably in the entire vast wilderness, she was the only person who dared to sit alongside the Yellow Emperor.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cLet me see your hands.\u201dXiao Yao lifted up her hands and the Yellow Emperor touched the thick callouses that had formed where she pulled the bow back. \u201cWhen little ladies are practicing archery, they don\u2019t want to grow ugly callouses so will wear gloves. Why don\u2019t you have one made.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cTheir purpose is different than mine. They want to go hunting in Autumn, I want to kill people. Will my enemy wait until I put on my gloves first?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor released her hand \u201cFang Feng Bei won\u2019t teach you their family\u2019s entire archery skills. I\u2019ll find you another master. You have weak powers so your bow and arrow will need to be custom made. But there is no rush on that, when you get better I\u2019ll have a set commissioned for you.\u201dXiao Yao casually said \u201cGao Xing has no shortage of weapons forgers. I\u2019ll have my dad make me a set.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared at her \u201cHow does your dad treat you?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes were like the slits of a crescent moon as she grinned \u201cNo better dad than him in the world.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor gazed at the mulberry forest \u2013 with Shao Hao\u2019s intelligence, he couldn\u2019t not have known that Xiao Yao was\u2026.. Did he have an ulterior motive then? The Yellow Emperor slowly asked \u201cHe is the leader of a kingdom, don\u2019t see him as just your dad. If you are born into an imperial family, don\u2019t expect relations.h.i.+ps and feelings to be simple. You have to rely on yourself for everything.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cNot every ruler is as ambitious as you.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor ignored her barb and suddenly said \u201cPick a good husband! Before I die I can guarantee that you can marry any man you want.\u201d He wanted to make sure Xiao Yao was happy.The Yellow Emperor\u2019s conversation jumped topics so abruptly Xiao Yao was stunned and suddenly she felt this tenderness in her heart. No matter how much she blamed him, he was still her grandfather.Xiao Yao controlled her conflicted emotions and asked with a goofy smile \u201cAnyone I want? Even someone who is already engaged? Even someone who is your enemy?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared at Xiao Yao \u201cWhat kind of man do you want?\u201d The Yellow Emperor did not come from a n.o.ble or imperial birth right or received such an education, he was born in an ordinary family so when conversing with him, he was much more blunt that the Grand Emperor.This bold topic would have made any young girl blush but Xiao Yao. She really thought about it and said \u201cBefore I came of age I was already pretending to be a man. When young ladies are just noticing guys I was trying to just survive. I was alone for so long that really I just want someone to keep me company. Not someone I want to marry \u2013 I want someone I can live with, share happiness and sorrow with, fight and make up, I just don\u2019t want to talk to myself anymore. But I\u2019m scared because think about it, my own grandfather, mom, dad, they all abandoned me before. How can I trust someone won\u2019t abandon me. I took in lonely elders and orphans because I know they need me so they won\u2019t abandon me.\u201dXiao Yao chuckled \u201cPeople think I am kind but really I\u2019m just weak. When I\u2019m with those who are weaker than me, I feel like I am in control and am needed so I won\u2019t be abandoned. That is when I feel safe.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor rested on the pallet and stared at Xiao Yao.She continued \u201cWhen I became a girl again, I think marrying is so far away and never thought about it. But I know I\u2019m scared of a man like you. In your heart, there will always be choices that are more important than the woman you love.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was expressionless and he said \u201cMen like me are not suited to be husbands.\u201dXiao Yao slowly said \u201cI am too afraid of having and losing, so I would rather not have at all. Unless there is a man who, no matter faced with any choice, will always pick me first, who will never abandon me no matter what reason, then I will be willing to spend the rest of my life with him.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cThat\u2019s very hard.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI know it\u2019s hard which is why I don\u2019t think about any man. I\u2019m too scared of falling in and not being able to save myself\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao sighed \u201cEven if I have a bit of stirring, I do my best to rein it in.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cThe question you just asked me, there is actually an answer and you know what it is. If he picked another woman, that means you are not his first choice. If he chose to be the enemy of Zhuan Xu or myself, then it means you are not most important to him and he can give you up.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart was jumbled and she sat with her arms around her knees and stared at the mulberry forest.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cActually you think too much. People need to pretend to be clueless sometimes. If you pick the right person, treat him well and it\u2019s not hard to grow old together.\u201dXiao Yao mulled over what he said and after a few minutes smiled ruefully \u201cI understand what grandfather is trying to say but I\u2019m already this way. If I can\u2019t find the kind of man I want, then I rather not marry and take in some orphans and live my life.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor had no further response and silently stared at the mulberry forest.Xiao Yao stayed at Cao Yun Peak for five days, practicing her archery in the morning, flipping through medical texts and making poisons in the afternoon, and when the Yellow Emperor had time, she would dine and chat with him.On the sixth morning, Zhuan Xu brought Ah Nian to pay her respects to the Yellow Emperor.Ah Nian was very courteous and respectful, and the Yellow Emperor was taken aback at seeing how much Ah Nian looked like his own daughter than Xiao Yao did. Because of this, he was warmer to her.Ah Nian immediately sensed it and started her usual pouting and wheedling \u201cI want a grandfather, too! Your majesty, can I call you grandfather like Zhuan Xu gege goes?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor laughed \u201cIf your father doesn\u2019t mind, then go ahead.\u201dAh Nian immediately said in the sweetest voice \u201cGrandfather.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was so happy he had a servant bring one of Lei Zhu\u2019s bracelets to bestow on her. Ah Nian heard it was a bracelet that formerly belonged to Her highness Lei Zhu and was beaming with happiness and immediately put it on.Xiao Yao stared with her mouth open and felt like Ah Nian was the granddaughter who was actually related to the Yellow Emperor.Zhuan Xu winked at Xiao Yao to indicate that she was witnessing Ah Nian\u2019s power now.Xiao Yao gave a thumbs up, she used to think Ah Nian was clueless with the details but smart with the bigger picture. She wasn\u2019t stupid but was hot tempered and not very personable. But now she realized it wasn\u2019t that Ah Nian didn\u2019t know how to be personable, she just didn\u2019t care to. Towards people who had no impact on her, why would she waste time to be nice to them. Ah Nian might be bratty but she also knew where the boundary was with Zhuan Xu and the Grand Emperor and she never once crossed it.A servant came to announce \u201cFang Feng Bei is at the bottom of the mountain asking to meet with the Princess.\u201dXiao Yao spoke solemnly like she was off to do big things \u201cI\u2019m off to play, if I come back late don\u2019t wait for me for dinner.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was chatting with Ah Nian and waved \u201cGo on.\u201dXiao Yao curtsied and left with Zhuan Xu following her.Xiao Yao went to grab a winged horse but didn\u2019t bring her bow and arrow. Other than Fang Feng Bei, only the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu knew she was learning archery and she didn\u2019t want anyone else to know. She purposely had two sets made, one kept with her and one kept with Fang Feng Bei. If others noticed, it would appear to belong to him.Zhuan Xu grabbed the reins \u201cAre you purposely avoiding Jing.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been by every day to see me these past few days. He doesn\u2019t have that much free time to want to see me every day.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cFang Feng Bei is waiting for me, I need to go.\u201dZhuan Xu paused and said \u201cFang Feng Bei is concubine born and he has no real power in the Fang Feng family. You can play with him but\u2026..don\u2019t end things with Jing yet. I need him right now.\u201d Zhuan Xu lowered his head and his hand gripping the reins were blue with strength he was gripping it. Zhuan Xu endured countless insults and humiliations but in this moment he felt utterly powerless and humiliated.Xiao Yao grabbed his hand \u201cGege, don\u2019t feel bad. This isn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019ll go see Jing and it\u2019s not hard and I\u2019m not doing it for you. I actually\u2026.I actually have been mad at him.\u201dZhuan Xu kept his head lowered and said in mockery \u201cI sure am a good older brother. You can\u2019t even be mad when you want to be, and I need you to quickly go and lower your head to a man.\u201d He released the reins \u201cGo!\u201d before striding back into court.Xiao Yao rode the winged horse down the mountain and saw Fang Feng Bei waiting for her. She waved her hand and he kicked his horse and caught up to her, the two of them riding in unison towards Dun Wu Mountain.When they arrived, Xiao Yao grabbed the bow and pulled and arrow and let one rip hard as the arrow embedded into the big tree.Fang Feng Bei laughed \u201cYou\u2019re p.i.s.sed today!\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and grabbed another arrow and slowly turned around and pointed it on Fang Feng Bei\u2019s chest \u201cWho are you?\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cI live in the home of my future brother-in-law, I see my sister every day. Who do you think I can be other than Fang Feng Bei?\u201dSeeing him now, he didn\u2019t look like Xiang Liu again so Xiao Yao glared \u201cIf later on I find out you lied to me, I\u2019ll shoot this arrow right into your heart.\u201dFang Feng Bei laughed \u201cWho do you really want me to be? The friend you want to poison to death?\u201dXiao Yao released her arrow and it whizzed past Fang Feng Bei and landed in the tree behind him. He clapped \u201cI\u2019m a great teacher!\u201dXiao Yao smiled.Fang Feng Bei said \u201cI can tell you\u2019re in a bad mood today, let\u2019s stop for now!\u201dXiao Yao pulled another arrow \u201cIf I don\u2019t practice if I\u2019m in a bad mood, or don\u2019t practice when I\u2019m in a good mood, then life is filled with too many excuses to slack off. If I start then I\u2019ll continue so why bother.\u201dFang Feng Bei sighed and said nothing else. He stared at Xiao Yao shooting and would occasionally give her pointers.They practiced until mid-afternoon before Xiao Yao put her bow away.The two of them did what they always did and went back to Xuan Yuan Castle to have lunch at a dance hall and take a nap.The two of them rode alongside each other down the streets of Xuan Yuan, and despite Xiao Yao wearing a veiled hat, she was riding a winged horse. Plus Fang Feng Bei was beside her and the smart folks easily guessed she was the Princess. People got excited and pointed at her and crowds started gathering.Xiao Yao was distracted this morning and grabbed the wrong winged horse. This one was encrusted with the gold emblem of the royal family and was likely a horse that pulled the Yellow Emperor\u2019s carriage.At this time, they were the only people moving on the street which felt totally strange but Xiao Yao had no choice but to put her her best haughty Princess impersonation as she and Fang Feng Bei pa.s.sed.Fang Feng Bei laughed \u201cI may be shameless but taking you to a dance hall in broad daylight in public makes even me feel sheepish.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThat means you\u2019re not shameless enough and need to keep working on it.\u201d Actually she didn\u2019t have the guts either, worried that it\u2019ll spread back to Gao Xing and her dad would hear of it.Xiao Yao said \u201cLet\u2019s go to Zhuan Xu\u2019s place. He should be in Cao Yun Court until after dinner.\u201dAfter they entered the residence, Xiao Yao jumped off her winged horse and sighed \u201cMy version of the wild Princess is so different than Ah Nian. With the entire street staring at me, my first instinct is to wonder what I did wrong. Is this a side effect of doing too many bad things in my past?\u201dFang Feng Bei asked half seriously half in jest \u201cWhy don\u2019t you not be a Princess anymore and go wander the world with me?\u201dXiao Yao giggled \u201cSure! If you can let everything go first.\u201dFang Feng Bei chuckled while Xiao Yao stared at him. She felt like she called him on his bulls.h.i.+t. When she was wandering the world being a con artist, he was likely home tickling his maids!The center court was where Zhuan Xu handled his business affairs so Xiao Yao led him to the side court where a pallet and meal was set up on the front part of the room while the back half was blocked with a long veil curtain and a pallet was inside for napping.The maids quickly brought out the food and after dining, Fang Feng Bei rested against the window staring out at the courtyard view while drinking wine. Xiao Yao drowsily said \u201cZhuan Xu probably didn\u2019t train any maids to dance so if you want you need to ask the maids yourself.\u201dXiao Yao walked into the back part of the room and pulled down the veil curtain and she was asleep before her head hit the pillow. They were like this when they went to the dance halls as well, after dining Fang Feng Bei would watch the dancers outside while Xiao Yao took a nap on the pallet behind him. When she woke up, they would discuss where to go next.Xiao Yao was aware that Fang Feng Bei said something but she waved him off to not bother her. She hadn\u2019t slept enough and her body wasn\u2019t like the rest of the G.o.ds. After a morning of archery practice, if she didn\u2019t nap she wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything in the afternoon.She slept a bit more and then heard Fang Feng Bei talking to someone. She thought Zhuan Xu came home and didn\u2019t think much about it, turning her head and laying there still.\u201cI heard Xiao Yao saying the Prince will be back after dinner. If you have something urgent, you should send word to Xuan Yuan Mountain.\u201d\u201cI already sent someone to Xuan Yuan Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao shot up fully awake. That gentle raspy voice, other than Jing who else could it be?It was so weird. Anytime she heard him talking to someone else, she always felt it was not the same Jing she knew. When he was saying something false to others, he remained calm and smooth, yet when he talked with her it always felt like he was slightly tongue-tied and awkward.\u201cYou\u2019re close with the Prince?\u201d Fang Feng Bei was checking.\u201cThe Prince gets along with everyone and is close with a lot of people.\u201d Jing\u2019s response was seamless.Xiao Yao stood up and the two men stopped talking. She went to the mirror to tidy herself first.Fang Feng Bei said \u201cXiao Yao, the maid came earlier to announce that Tu Shan Jing is seeking an audience with the Prince. I saw you were still sleeping so made a call to have the maid bring him inside.\u201dXiao Yao lifted the curtain and walked out with a smile \u201cThanks for making the right call otherwise I would have been a poor host for Gege\u2019s friend.\u201dXiao Yao acted like she heard nothing from earlier and politely said to Jing \u201cGege is in Cao Yun Peak and I\u2019ll have someone summon him back. If Young Master is not busy, then wait here. If you\u2019re busy, then you can go back first and I\u2019ll have Gege go find you.\u201d She actually called a maid in and told her to summon Zhuan Xu back from Xuan Yuan Mountain.Xiao Yao curtsied to Jing \u201cBei and I have other matters, we\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201dXiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei walked out of the room and she asked \u201cWhere to next?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cWherever you want to do, we can go.\u201dXiao Yao felt a pair of eyes on her back, it was heavy, so heavy she felt she couldn\u2019t move. But she decided on it so she forced her footsteps to be light as she laughed.When they got to the front door, she suddenly remembered what Zhuan Xu asked her earlier and stopped. She didn\u2019t know why but she just wanted to be mad at Jing.Fang Feng Bei asked \u201cWhat is it?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI suddenly remembered that Gege asked me to do something. I won\u2019t accompany you today and let\u2019s make it up another time, okay?\u201dFang Feng Bei stared at her and that inexplicable familiar sensation rose up again and Xiao Yao\u2019s body tensed. She felt like at any moment Fang Feng Bei would suddenly fly forward and bite down on her neck.Suddenly Fang Feng Bei laughed and said with a casual \u201cSure!\u201dHe left and Xiao Yao touched her neck and felt like she avoided that one.Inside the court, it was eerily silent with no movement. Jing sat on the pallet without moving and it was unclear what he was thinking.Xiao Yao said to herself: he\u2019s Tu Shan Jing, not the broken and battered Ye s.h.i.+ Qi that no one wants.Xiao Yao smiled as she walked over and sat down facing Tu Shan Jing \u201cDo you want some tea? I\u2019ll have the maids make some for you.\u201dJing\u2019s voice was low \u201cNo.\u201dXiao Yao was very eager \u201cThen you want some wine? I\u2019ll have the maids warm up some wine? Xuan Yuan Castle isn\u2019t as warm as Qing Qiu, and now it\u2019s late Autumn so everyone likes warmed wine.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d\u201cYou are here, that is enough.\u201dThere was the hint of a smile in Jing\u2019s eyes mixed with sadness. But it really did appear that no matter what Xiao Yao did or said, as long as she was there then he was content.Xiao Yao suddenly felt really pointless, like pus.h.i.+ng with all her might at a cloud.Jing handed a box to Xiao Yao and she opened it to find inside was a necklace with a purple gem hanging on a pendant. It was crystal clear and glittering.Xiao Yao was in disbelief \u201cA fish amethyst?\u201d\u201cI wanted to find you a red one a fish ruby but it really is hard to find and needs to be by chance. Only a fish amethyst was found and initially I wanted to engrave it but then thought you probably want to put it in your mouth so you can swim longer in the water. This shape is round so it\u2019s comfortable to hold in your mouth. If you want a design I\u2019ll have it carved for you.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cThis was hard to find, right?\u201d\u201cNot difficult.\u201d\u201cNot difficult? Even the Tu Shan clan with wealth to rival a kingdom could only find a purple one. In the future when you give something to a girl, be more sincere about it.\u201dJing said nothing.Xiao Yao played with it \u201cThis is already been processed?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo if I put it in my mouth I can swim underwater?\u201d\u201cYes, I tested it already.\u201dXiao Yao was almost ready to put the gem in her mouth but when she head this she quickly put her hand down and felt the gem was hot in her hands.Jing was worried Xiao Yao loved to play so much she got in trouble \u201cThe longest time I swam was for one day two nights. But I have powers so just to be safe don\u2019t do it for longer than ten hours.\u201dXiao Yao murmured a yes. Jing liked quiet over activity but to test the gem he swam for one day and two nights in the water.Xiao Yao suddenly flopped on the pallet and buried her head in her arms.Jing was shocked and his voice quivered \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just hate you a little.\u201d Every time when she steeled her heart, he always had a way of softening it. Was it because she saved him and took him home that she just couldn\u2019t be heartless with him?\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know I shouldn\u2019t appear!\u201d Jing didn\u2019t know what Xiao Yao was thinking, all he knew was that Xiao Yao was very unhappy but earlier she was very happy with Fang Feng Bei.Xiao Yao was so angry she threw the gem at him \u201cYou are such a big idiot! I don\u2019t know why everyone else thinks you\u2019re so smart.\u201dJing didn\u2019t dare duck so just sat there.Xiao Yao was worried she broke the gem and asked \u201cThe gem?\u201dJing helped her look for it and handed it to her \u201cIt doesn\u2019t break that easily.\u201dXiao Yao glared at him and played with the gem and groused \u201cYou came to Xuan Yuan Castle, why bring along\u2026.. Do you still want to end the engagement? If you don\u2019t, then tell me earlier so I am not holding onto my promise with you!\u201dJing hurried said \u201cI want to end it! I already told my grandmother I don\u2019t want to marry Fang Feng Yi Yang!\u201dXiao Yao lowered her head and said nothing.Jing continued \u201cAll these years, Yi Yang spent by my grandmother and is very close with her. She didn\u2019t agree to let me end it but agreed to postpone the wedding. This time Yi Yang wanted to come to Xuan Yuan Castle and I didn\u2019t want to take her but grandmother said the clan owed her for me to treat her like a little sister.\u201dXiao Yao played with the gem and thought about it.Jing said \u201cXiao Yao, my grandmother spoils me, I will be able to convince her.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ll accept this fish amethyst!\u201d She put the necklace around her neck and then tucked the pendant into her robe.Jing noticed and his heart skipped a beat and he lowered his head.Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019m learning archery from Fang Feng Bei who offered to teach me which is why we\u2019ve been hanging out.\u201dJing\u2019s heart soared and he said with a smile \u201cNo need to explain, and I have no right to ask you to explain. Just now, you coming back, that is enough.\u201dBut she didn\u2019t come back just now for Jing, she came back because of Zhuan Xu! Xiao Yao felt this pressure in her heart, was her relations.h.i.+p with Jing also subject to being used? Xiao Yao said \u201cDo you remember promising me not to hurt Xuan?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what my Gege wants to do, but if it doesn\u2019t harm Tu Shan clan, can you help him a little?\u201dJing warmly said \u201cIf it\u2019s this request, you need not even ask. I actually came with Feng Long this time to discuss something with Zhuan Xu.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have something to discuss, then you wouldn\u2019t have come?\u201d Xiao Yao bit her lip and furrowed her brow.Jing heart skipped a beat and he explained \u201cFeng Long asked me to wait for him but I couldn\u2019t wait any longer and came first\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis is called coming first? I\u2019ve been in Xuan Yuan Castle for twenty months now.\u201dJing tried to think through what Xiao Yao said and he felt she meant he came too late. But he couldn\u2019t quite believe she would mean that, so he had to think through each word and really wished she would say it again so he could hear her tone of voice.Xiao Yao was silent and then sighed, standing up to walk away.Jing grabbed her and stammered \u201cXiao Yao, you\u2026you\u2026you want to see me?\u201dXiao Yao stared at him and he said with uncertainty \u201cI know I\u2019m rather dense at some stuff, if I made a wrong a.s.sumption, don\u2019t be angry.\u201dXiao Yao felt like she was looking at s.h.i.+ Qi again and her heart softened \u201cDo you want to see me?\u201dJing nodded very solemnly. Because he missed her to the core, he thought of an idea and convinced Feng Long and then dragged Feng Long and Xing Yue thousands of miles to come to Xuan Yuan Castle to convince Zhuan Xu.Xiao Yao was angry \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come?\u201d\u201cSome things I needed to do.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cHow can you be so certain I won\u2019t let another man into my heart?\u201dJing shook his head, he was so uncertain.Xiao Yao was so exasperated \u201cYou\u2026.are so stupid!\u201dJing was taken aback, compared to Fang Feng Bei\u2019s das.h.i.+ng charm, he really was too dull and staid.Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian walked in and greeted them. Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201dJing smiled \u201cNo worries, I didn\u2019t tell you beforehand.\u201d He glanced at Ah Nian and Zhuan Xu understood and said to Ah Nian \u201cAfter a day with grandfather, you must be tired. Go wash up.\u201dAh Nian knew they had things to discuss but they didn\u2019t seem to want Xiao Yao to leave as well. She was feeling miffed but didn\u2019t show it and just sweetly said \u201cOkay.\u201dSeeing Ah Nian leaving, Jing said to Zhuan Xu \u201cIn a bit Feng Long and Xing Yue will arrive and they will sneak to come see you. After tonight, they won\u2019t ever meet you privately again.\u201dZhuan Xu heard this and summoned his loyal retainer and gave a few orders. He didn\u2019t ask Jing what it was and just had the maids bring some food and wine \u201cLet\u2019s dine and wait for them.\u201d He turned to Xiao Yao \u201cYou can join as well.\u201dXiao Yao sat down and was bored with their chatter so started drinking. Zhuan Xu laughed and patted her on the head \u201cIf you get drunk, Feng Long and Xing Yue will think you\u2019re an alcoholic and if word gets out you\u2019ll never hope to get married.:Xiao Yao groused \u201cWho said I wanted to drink all alone. Don\u2019t you know how to play? Play me a tune!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIn front of Jing, I can\u2019t say I can play. Ask him to play.\u201dJing said \u201cI haven\u2019t touched a zither in over ten years.\u201dZhuan Xu was shocked and then apologized. He sat down at the zither and started to play, and it was a song Xiao Yao heard before. She sighed.Suddenly Jing said \u201cFeng Long and Xing Yue are here, Xiao Yao go inside.\u201dXiao Yao quickly went inside.The tune finished and Feng Long and Xing Yue walked in \u201cTo wait until you finished, we stood outside for a bit.\u201dXing Yue stared at Zhuan Xu and her face was red.Zhuan Xu welcomed them but Feng Long said \u201cJust water, we\u2019re going to greet the elders later and best not smell like alcohol.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cI had the servants slow the cloud carriage down and I rode my winged ride here first, I bought us only a little bit of time so let\u2019s cut to the chase.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cBetween us, say whatever you want.\u201dFeng Long asked Zhuan Xu \u201cYou came back to Xuan Yuan to fight for the crown, but your uncles have thousands of years of ruling experience over you. What do you have to compete with them?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI do have that desire, but right now I\u2019m barely able to stay alive here. If you have another idea, please share.\u201d\u201cSince Xuan Yuan Castle belongs to your uncles and cousins tight control, why don\u2019t you give it up?\u201d\u201cGive up Xuan Yuan Castle?\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s face changed.Feng Long stood up and waved his hand and a water based map of the entire vast wilderness appeared \u201cLook at the location of Xuan Yuan Castle. Long ago, when the Yellow Emperor and Empress Lei Zhu founded the Xuan Yuan Kingdom and was picking its capital, they selected this place because it can control the Northwest. The Castle is ringing on all four sides by mountains and hard to get in and out which makes it hard to conquer. Back then the Sheng Nong Kingdom couldn\u2019t ever vanquish Xuan Yuan. But now thousands have years have pa.s.sed and Xuan Yuan is no longer a little kingdom in the Northwest. It\u2019s now got the Northeast, the due South, the far North, and the entire Middle Plains. All such great lands belong to Xuan Yuan!\u201dFeng Long pointed to the entire Xuan Yuan map and where Xuan Yuan Castle was located in the remote Northwest didn\u2019t appear worthy of being the capital of such a vast kingdom, and it\u2019s location would become hard for it to exercise influence throughout all its controlled territories.Feng Long said \u201cZhuan Xu, do you see clearly? THIS is the entire world that you will rule over one day.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s hand was shaking \u201cI see it clearly!\u201dFePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhuan Xu gradually got hooked on Cui Liang\u2019s bad habits.His formerly quiet residence started having dancers and singers in residence. It wasn\u2019t a big deal to have women around, which of the rich and powerful men didn\u2019t have kept women around.Cui Liang and his friends felt alcohol wasn\u2019t a big enough buzz and started taking pills made from magical drugs that would give them a bigger high and even hallucinations. Cui Liang wanted Zhuan Xu to try it and initially he declined but after awhile watching Cui Liang take it and having their women coax him, he finally tried it when a sultry dancer used her pert mouth to pa.s.s a pill to him.When there was a first time, there was a second time\u2026..and Zhuan Xu and Cui Liang got even closer.One time Cui Liang brought his buddies and women to Zhuan Xu\u2019s residence and ran into Xiao Yao. She was furious and went to tell the Yellow Emperor in detail without sparing any words. The Yellow Emperor ordered each of his grandsons whipped sixty times, with Cui Liang unable to get out of bed for the next month afterwards. He also berated his Cang Lin and Yu Yang in front of the entire court and had them kneel for two hours. Cui Liang was scared of Xiao Yao after that and never came by the residence anymore and would go a different direction when he saw her coming.Zhuan Xu stopped coming back to the residence and was always out with Cui Liang. No one in Xuan Yuan Castle cared about Zhuan Xu so no one worried that he was wasting his life away. Only the Great General Ying Long, when he ran into Zhuan Xu and saw him drunkenly trying to say h.e.l.lo, slapped him hard and said \u201cThis slap is on behalf of your parents!\u201dZhuan Xu got slapped and felt terrible about it, locking himself up to reflect. But after a few days, Cui Liang came by when Xiao Yao was not around and dragged him out after a few drinks.Initially Zhuan Xu would be repentant and embarra.s.sed after each carousing session, but gradually that stopped. Another time when he ran into Ying Long and saw him angry, Zhuan Xu actually drunkenly pulled out a whip and threatened to beat up Ying Long. Cui Liang had to drag him off since Ying Long was one of the Yellow Emperor\u2019s most trusted generals and was a renowned hard rock.Within the entire Xuan Yuan Castle, the person who worried the most about Zhuan Xu was Ah Nian.She would beg him to stop and he would sweetly agree, and then turn around and forget his promise. Eventually Zhuan Xu never came back to his residence and Ah Nian didn\u2019t know the castle so she couldn\u2019t go look for him and could only wait all night until he came home. But he was so drunk he couldn\u2019t understand what she said and definitely couldn\u2019t keep any of the promises he always made.Ah Nian was so at her wits end she got in a heated fight with Zhuan Xu, even raging at him. But no matter her pleading or her yelling, or even threatening to go back to Gao Xing and never talking to him again, Zhuan Xu would only willingly promise to stop but never followed through.Gradually, Ah Nian lost her temper and started crying. She hated Xuan Yuan Castle! In the most important castle in the vast wilderness, she encountered the most painful thing in her life. She gradually saw Zhuan Xu become a different person, everyday with a different woman on his arms, and she could do nothing to stop him!Because of Zhuan Xu, Ah Nian\u2019s formerly innocent eyes that had never seen any hards.h.i.+p, gradually became clouded with disappointment. It was like she grew up all overnight.Ah Nian finally decided to bow her head and ask Xiao Yao for help to stop Zhuan Xu from hanging out with Cui Liang\u2019s group. She was even willing to take Zhuan Xu back to Gao Xing.Xiao Yao said wearily \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m not trying to stop him. I tried, I argued with him, I even went to Grandfather for help. We\u2019ve had them beat up but the result is what you see.\u201dAh Nian cried tearfully and Xiao Yao said \u201cYou did what you can do. If you can\u2019t bear to see him like this, then go back to Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s calm was completely opposite of Ah Nian\u2019s heartbreak.Ah Nian turned her anger on Xiao Yao \u201cYou cold-blooded monster! If it wasn\u2019t for you, Gege wouldn\u2019t have come back to Xuan Yuan. All because you wanted to visit that bad mother of yours and wanted Gege to accompany you. If he didn\u2019t come back, none of this would have happened! Since you disappeared once before, why did you come back? You shouldn\u2019t have come back!\u201dXiao Yao glared at Ah Nian \u201cDo not insult my mother, or else I\u2019m going to forget we\u2019re sisters.\u201dAh Nian refused to back down because she was so hurt \u201cI never once saw you as my sister so we don\u2019t have sisterly feelings! If your mom wasn\u2019t a bad woman, how could she abandon her own husband? She is a bad woman, who knows which man she ran off with\u2026..\u201dWith a resounding slap, Xiao Yao delivered a blow to Ah Nian\u2019s cheeks and she fell on the ground shaking all over.Xiao Yao said \u201cThis is not Gao Xing, it\u2019s Xuan Yuan. The person you are insulting is the Xuan Yuan Princess. She died in battle for the people of Xuan Yuan and the people remain grateful to her. Just the few words you said is enough for Xuan Yuan to use as an excuse to attack Gao Xing. If you want to be an idiot, then scram back to Gao Xing and stop coming here to incite things.\u201dXiao Yao told Hai Tang \u201cTake her back, the poison will wear off in half an hour.\u201dHai Tang said nothing and quickly picked up Ah Nian and hurried out.Xiao Yao waited for Zhuan Xu in his room and saw him carried home pa.s.sed out drink. The maids were used to it already and helped him change to rest.Xiao Yao waited until they were all gone before sitting down next to his pallet and staring at him. This was a battle, but Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t discuss with her beforehand so she could only play along with him on her own.Xiao Yao touched his wrist and took his pulse before putting a pill in his mouth.Zhuan Xu stirred awake and Xiao Yao said \u201cStop acting in this farce any longer. By the time the show is over, you would have destroyed yourself.\u201dZhuan Xu looked at Xiao Yao \u201cWhat if it\u2019s not acting? What if I really have changed?\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying test me for? That if you didn\u2019t tell me beforehand then I would abandon you? Sorry, your test sucks because I know you too well. I know you\u2019re acting the part. How did you come up with such a brainless plan?\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cSometimes people go stupid.\u201d He really did want to know how Xiao Yao would treat him if he were to become a total dissolute. \u201cIf I really was this way, would you leave me one day because you couldn\u2019t take it anymore?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cAsk yourself whether you would abandon me in the same situation?\u201dZhuan Xu immediately said \u201cI won\u2019t! If you became like this, something must have happened and I would protect you. I would make you better, and if you don\u2019t want to get better\u2026.then I would stay besides you no matter what.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cDo you have my answer then?\u201dZhuan Xu nodded.Xiao Yao said \u201cThose drugs you\u2019re taking\u2026why not ask me for a cure beforehand?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I asked the doctors and they say the drugs are addictive but I have faith in myself to quit it the addiction when this is over. If I want to play act, then it has to be real. I have to let them think I\u2019m so useless it\u2019s safe to send me off to the Middle Plains where there is no way I can ever make anything of myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just addicting, these drugs are actually slow poisons and are poisoning your insides.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cBut I have you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cEven if you break the addiction, your powers will be greatly diminished.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cI said before that I\u2019m not relying on my powers to climb the mountain.\u201d\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\u201cSoon. Soon we\u2019ll be able to go to the Middle Plains.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cAh Nian is devastated and it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve changed. She can handle you being dissolute and a loser rich boy for life and its not enough to cry over. I saw the way she looks at you with those women. I think she doesn\u2019t just like you as a brother.\u201dZhuan Xu covered his eyes \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cHow should I know? Just remember that she is my dad\u2019s daughter and my dad raised you and taught you everything.\u201d Xiao Yao wanted Ah Nian to go back to Gao Xing which is why she was so harsh with her, but it wasn\u2019t clear if Ah Nian would go back.Zhuan Xu sighed \u201cI know, that is why I\u2019ve always genuinely cherished her. I don\u2019t see her the way I do Xing Yue and those other girls.\u201d\u201cThose other girls?\u201d Xiao Yao twisted his ear \u201cFourth Uncle and Fourth Auntie was each other\u2019s one and only for their entire life. Never apart in living or in death. You are completely different than them. I\u2019m going to sit back and see how many women you mess with in your lifetime.\u201dZhuan Xu rubbed his ear \u201cI\u2019m not purposely trying to mess with them.\u201dXiao Yao walked out and said sarcastically \u201cWant me to summon a woman for you?\u201dZhuan Xu closed his eyes \u201cI\u2019m still groggy!\u201dXiao Yao closed the door and went back to her room, laying on the pallet but unable to sleep.The insults Ah Nian hurled at her mother were the words hidden in her heart that she was most afraid to face. But in her eyes there was the image of a vividly red robe, and a man with the look in his eyes that was so arrogant and wild that he could eviscerate the world in his one glance, yet when he looked at her mom, his eyes was so tender and loving. And the way her mom looked at him\u2026..Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know it then, but she understood it now.The way her mom cried when she looked at him\u2026the feeling of the tears landing on Xiao Yao\u2019s face was a sensation she could still feel.Xiao Yao touched her face as if to wipe those tears away but there was nothing.Xiao Yao sat up in shock and opened the box on the foot of her pallet and pulled out a bottle of plum wine. Jing found a way to send plum wine every few months now, whether it was because he found the spy or another way to avoid his grandmother, or because of his alliance wit Zhuan Xu and Feng Long.Xiao Yao gulped down the wine and felt like she got strength from Jing and slowly calmed down. Xiao Yao chased the thoughts of her mom away and drank her wine and thought about her dad. She smiled and her feelings told her that her dad loved her very much! She had to be her dad\u2019s daughter!A person suddenly vaulted into her room from the window and then immediately closed it.The sounds of the chasing soldiers reached her, clearly they were chasing someone.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t yell, didn\u2019t move, and continued to play with the wine bottle in her hand. She said in a slow drawl \u201cI won\u2019t be taken hostage by you so leave now and find someone else.\u201dThe person didn\u2019t accept her suggestion and walked towards the pallet. Xiao Yao counted to ten but the man arrived at her pallet by the count of ten and still hadn\u2019t collapsed by her poison.Xiao Yao knew this person had strong powers and her poison was unable to fell him.The man lifted up the curtains around her pallet and sat down on it. Xiao Yao said \u201cYou may have strong powers but you\u2019re injured. I suggest again you not mess with me.\u201dThe man was wearing a mask and silently staring at Xiao Yao,Her body tensed and her instinct told her this man was someone she knew well. She reached out, and the man didn\u2019t stop her, and she slowly took off his mask. It was Fang Feng Bei.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cI much rather you were making a late night call to my lady\u2019s chamber.\u201dFang Feng Bei said nothing and Xiao Yao said \u201cCan you go find your play buddies? Why come to me?\u201d\u201cLike you said, they are just play buddies.\u201d Blood trickled from the corner of his lips as Fang Feng Bei replied and he wiped it away.Xiao Yao was torn and she picked up his wrist and then gave him some of the precious medicines that the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Emperor gave her.\u201cLay down.\u201dFang Feng Bei laid down on the pallet and Xiao Yao laid down as well and covered them \u201cMy Gege can\u2019t control anything right now and my ident.i.ty isn\u2019t of much use either. If they insist on searching, there is nothing I can do.\u201dFang Feng Bei said nothing and Xiao Yao felt he was very strange tonight. Just as she was mulling it over, a loud ruckus came from outside.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t do anything other than wait.She whispered \u201cWhat did you do? You couldn\u2019t have tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate the Yellow Emperor, did you? No matter how many have tried, they all end up cut down into pieces. You can\u2019t have been that stupid.\u201dFang Feng Bei continued to ignore her.Xiao Yao sighed \u201cToo bad you\u2019re not a real useless playboy.\u201dThe maid came to knock and Xiao Yao let her knock a few times before answering in a drowsy voice \u201cWhat is it? What is going on outside?\u201d\u201cThe Prince is leading soldiers doing a search for someone.\u201d\u201cCui Liang?\u201d Xiao Yao got up and put a robe around her \u201cHe wants to search the residence? What does my Gege say?\u201d\u201cThe Prince is pa.s.sed out asleep still!\u201dAnother maid quickly said \u201cPrincess, please put on your clothes! The soldiers are already searching the Prince\u2019s quarters and have turned it upside down and even the clothes have been shredded. We are afraid they will come and offend you!\u201dXiao Yao clenched her fist, she couldn\u2019t believe how much Zhuan Xu could endure. A Prince allowing soldiers to ransack his room like that.Xiao Yao opened the door and let the two maids in and she went back to sitting on the pallet. The two maids suggested \u201cThe soldiers are very brutish, Princess please go elsewhere and we can wait here.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I want to check it out.\u201dThe soldiers were searching from room to room but had likely heard of Xiao Yao\u2019s spitfire personality so skipped hers for now. They arrived at Ah Nian\u2019s room and were rude, the moment Hai Tang opened the door they wanted to push right inside. Hai Tang wasn\u2019t a pushover either and immediately wanted to fight back, she was trained by the Grand Emperor solely to protect Ah Nian and the soldiers were a piece of cake for her.Xiao Yao sat on her pallet and laughed.The Xuan Yuan soldiers had a reputation for being fierce and under the direction of a captain they formed a spiritual maze to tightly control Hai Tang.Xiao Yao sighed, no wonder the Yellow Emperor was feared all over over, even human Xuan Yuan soldiers were fearlessly opposing a G.o.d with powers like Hai Tang.Ah Nian walked out of her room and with a wave of her hand a row of ice knives appeared and she sent it flying at the soldiers. She was very in control and didn\u2019t aim for a critical spot, but more soldiers arrived and surrounded Ah Nian, and even two rode winged rides and hovered in the air clearly intending to strike.Xiao Yao told her maid \u201cGo ask Cui Liang if he wants to die?\u201dOne maid was too scared to go but the other maid walked to the door and hollered \u201cThe Princess wants to know if the Prince wants to die?\u201dIn a second, Cui Liang appeared with a smile and bowed to Xiao Yao \u201cWhy does cousin say this?\u201d He glanced around the room.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cNot sure what you are thinking but can\u2019t you tell \u2013 look at that maid. Can just anyone use her with her high powers and striking looks?\u201dCui Liang responded \u201cI thought she belonged to you.\u201d\u201cNo, she works for my little sister.\u201d Xiao Yao pointed at Ah Nian.Cui Liang\u2019s entire face lost color and he yelled \u201cStop!\u201dHe was positively ashen \u201cThe Gao Xing Second Princess is here and cousin didn\u2019t announce her?\u201d He was even angrier that no one told him.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cDo you think I care to conceal it. Grandfather could care less to tell anyone and might\u2019ve worried you guys would come bother her. If you don\u2019t believe me, go ask your dad!\u201dCui Liang ordered his soldiers to stop but Ah Nian didn\u2019t stop, released her anger at Zhuan Xu and dislike of Xiao Yao on the Xuan Yuan soldiers until everyone was laying on the ground and she yelled \u201cAnyone else want to try!\u201dCui Liang knew the Yellow Emperor was aware Ah Nian was here so even if he was furious he didn\u2019t dare take it out on Xiao Yao. He laughed \u201cWill cousin please apologize to the Princess, I wasn\u2019t trying to offend her, I just didn\u2019t know.\u201dXiao Yao stood up and pulled open her curtains and said \u201cDo you want to search my room as well?\u201dCui Liang quickly said \u201cNo, no\u201d but glanced over and saw messy blankets like someone got up quickly and in the corner there was an embroidered chest cover that was visible. Cui Liang\u2019s heart skipped and he leaned down to look at Xiao Yao\u2019s chest, if his cousin wasn\u2019t wearing her chest cover\u2026..Xiao Yao saw him looking at her chest and her face changed. She pulled down the curtains and said \u201cGet out!\u201dCui Liang\u2019s sleaziness was itching to touch her but no matter how sleazy he was he wouldn\u2019t dare touch Xiao Yao and he quickly left,Cui Liang figured he saw Xiao Yao\u2019s room already and didn\u2019t look like anyone was hiding there. But he was suspicious of Ah Nian but the soldiers were all dispatched by her and he didn\u2019t want a direct confrontation with her. Plus Xiao Yao was half family and he could explain to his grandfather, but offending Ah Nian would be like declaring war with Gao Xing.Cui Liang ordered the soldiers to leave but remained to apologize to Ah Nian \u201cBecause of the vicious criminals, we are afraid the Princess would be harmed so that is why I will leave soldiers to protect you.\u201dAh Nian blamed Cui Liang for leading Zhuan Xu astray and was waiting for him to say something wrong so she could take out all her rage on him and beat him up. But he kept apologizing and explaining it away so she could only storm back to her room. Ah Nian could care less about the soldiers outside since she did nothing wrong.It gradually quieted down outside and the two maids left the room and closed the door.Xiao Yao extinguished the flame and sat on the pallet and released the curtains. She pulled down the blanket and revealed Fang Feng Bei\u2019s head \u201cDidn\u2019t suffocate to death?\u201dFang Feng Bei had his eyes closed and ignored her and she didn\u2019t light another lamp and instead reached under the covers to touch his hand. She felt his pulse to understand his injuries and realized the pills she gave him earlier had no effect.Xiao Yao released his hand and laid down beside him, staring at the ceiling.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cWho do you want me to be?\u201d Fang Feng Bei coldly answered.Xiao Yao said nothing and after a long time she spit out \u201cYou can be whoever you d.a.m.n well please!\u201dFang Feng Bei half rose up and his head slowly descended, but as his lips were about to touch Xiao Yao\u2019s neck her hand came up \u201cStop!\u201d and his lips kissed her palm.Fang Feng Bei immediately laid down but Xiao Yao turned herself to the side and handed him her wrist \u201cBite here.\u201d\u201cWhy not there?\u201d Fang Feng Bei\u2019s expression was tense.Xiao Yao started to really miss the easy going, whatever goes, totally game Fang Feng Bei \u201cWhy do you think? Fang Feng Bei!\u201dFang Feng Bei was quiet for a moment and then reached for Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and two sharp teeth appeared and pierced through her wrist. This was the first time Xiao Yao could see him sucking her blood. There was no pain, only the frisson of cool excitement.Xiao Yao intently watched Fang Feng Bei but when he glanced over her she immediately closed her eyes docilely! How could it be that she was still scared of him!After some time, Xiao Yao started to feel dizzy but said nothing. This was Xuan Yuan Castle, he had to heal as quickly as possible!Fang Feng Bei finished drinking her blood and he gently licked the bite and Xiao Yao\u2019s bleeding stopped. When he put down her wrist, there was no bite anymore and what remained looked like a pa.s.sionate kiss mark.Fang Feng Bei softly said \u201cXiao Yao.\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t open her eyes and murmured \u201cI\u2019m fine, you heal now and after I sleep it\u2019ll be fine.\u201dFang Feng Bei rummaged through her boxes of medicines and took out a pill and fed it to her.Fang Feng Bei then laid down and closed his eyes to self-heal.Xiao Yao slept until it was nearly noon and when she opened her eyes, she immediately looked at Fang Feng Bei. He was still laying there with his eyes closed and she relaxed her worried heart.Xiao Yao knew he couldn\u2019t move but could hear so she said softly \u201cI\u2019m going out to eat since I\u2019m hungry. No one will come in so you heal in peace.\u201dXiao Yao got up and adjusted the curtains and walked to the corner to change. After she did her hair she walked out but all along the path she spread poison, and spread yet another layer of poison at the doorway before she felt left without worrying.The maid who dared talk back to Cui Liang last night was watering the courtyard plants and Xiao Yao whispered to her \u201cWatch them\u201d indicating the soldiers Cui Liang stationed here. She was sure the maid was one of Zhuan Xu\u2019s people.She nodded \u201cI understand, if anything happens I will raise a huge fuss.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhat is your name?\u201cXiao Xiao.\u201dXiao Yao went to Zhuan Xu\u2019s room where Ah Nian was sitting there. Zhuan Xu was half sprawled on the pallet, the room was a mess, and his clothes were shredded.Ah Nian was angrily explaining last night and Zhuan Xu seemed upset as well and promised to go deal with Cui Liang later.Ah Nian saw Xiao Yao walk in and her heart was a bit scared so she shot her a glare before leaving.Xiao Yao glanced around \u201cDid they search your body?\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cNo, they just pulled the blankets off.\u201dXiao Yao was silent, how dare they!Zhuan Xu yelled \u201cMaids!\u201dThe maids brought in a wash items and he and Xiao Yao washed up together. The maids brought breakfast and Xiao Yao ate. Zhuan Xu asked \u201cYesterday was the biggest insult of all time so even if I want to pretend to be the biggest wussy I should still go and throw a fit with them over this one. If you think this place is getting miserable, go back to Gao Xing with Ah Nian.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cFind out why Cui Liang brought soldiers to search the place.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to ask, I\u2019ll find out.\u201d Zhuan Xu left with his face ashen.Xiao Yao finished eating and went back to her room. She was worried she would interrupt Xiang Liu healing so she whispered \u201cIt\u2019s me\u201d the moment she walked in the door.She opened the curtains and saw Fang Feng Bei silently laying there still.Xiao Yao sat cross-legged on the pallet and quietly stared at him.Xiao Yao still vividly remembered that it was a Summer morning. She was carefully packing the poisons she wanted to send Xiang Liu and was delivering it to the messenger shop run by the Tu Shan clan. After the product was sent, she was just thinking about how Xiang Liu would feel when he saw a box containing all sorts of beautifully designed poisons. Likely he would call her a weirdo pervert.When she was happily leaving the messenger shop, he swanned over to her, just like a playboy hitting on a lady. He was all smiles and honeyed voice offering to teach her archery. Xiao Yao was amused and didn\u2019t mind his trying to get close to her. Probably because he always made her feel like he was someone familiar to her.From the day he taught her archery until now, it had been two years.During the two years, the two of them were each other\u2019s companion exploring every nook and cranny of Xuan Yuan Castle. He sometimes disappeared, and then would show up again, always with a whatever att.i.tude. Xiao Yao felt like the two of them could have kept playing together like this for forever and an eternity. Because the two of them were just too similar \u2013 they didn\u2019t care about anything, willing to try everything, interested in all, and whatever could make them smile. They appreciated all that was beautiful, but wanted to own none of it. Their life balanced precariously between darkness and light, if they chose light then behind them was thousands of miles of desolation, if they chose darkness then behind them was thousands of miles of glittering luxury. But even if they faced the light, they still had one step in the darkness so their light wasn\u2019t completely pure but instead came from never forgetting all the pain they experienced before. The pain followed them forever which is why they were so strong, so brave, so independent, so cold, so no matter what happened, they knew they could keep on living.Last night when she knew for sure he was Xiang Liu, she wasn\u2019t surprised or shocked in the least. It felt like it was always this way, and this heavy burden in the corner of her heart was lifted, though another burden had arisen.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t come back until the night of the second day all drunk with two women on each arm. She heard it was an apology gift from Cui Liang.Ah Nian was in disbelief \u201cFor two women, Gege let someone ransack his residence and even search our rooms and he\u2019ll let it go?\u201dThe servant replied \u201cPrince Cui Liang did apologize.\u201d\u201cApologize? Was what happened okay with just a simple apology?\u201d Ah Nian was so angry her voice changed tone. The Xuan Yuan soldiers daring to raise their arms to her, that was just okay with an apology?Ah Nian pushed the servant aside and stormed into Zhuan Xu\u2019s room but immediately ran out with her face beet red and tears in her eyes. She clearly saw something inappropriate like Zhuan Xu making out with those two girls.Ah Nian stood there for a moment and then turned and rushed towards her own room. Shortly thereafter, Hai Tang came out carrying their luggage with Ah Nian beside her.Xiao Yao asked \u201cAre you going back to Gao Xing?\u201dAh Nian glared \u201cI heard last night Cui Liang even looked on your pallet and you did nothing! All you dare to do is be mean to me!\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and accepted that.Hai Tang summoned their winged ride and Ah Nian vaulted on before it rose into the air. Xiao Yao called out to Hai Tang \u201cEscort the Princess back to the Gao Xing safely.\u201dXiao Xiao saw Xiao Yao looking at the sky and came over \u201cEldest Princess need not worry, secret guards will protect the Second Princess.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI know.\u201d Zhuan Xu was the most protective of Ah Nian but this was the first big hurt he inflicted on her. It wasn\u2019t that Ah Nian\u2019s importance in Zhuan Xu\u2019s heart changed, it was that Zhuan Xu had more important things to do so he gave up protecting Ah Nian.Xiao Yao went back to her room and she held Fang Feng Bei\u2019s hand and checked his injuries. His healing would be done soon.Xiao Yao placed a set of men\u2019s clothes beside him and quietly left. She could face Fang Feng Bei openly and could be all joking with Xiang Liu, but right now she didn\u2019t know how to face both Xiang Liu and Fang Feng Bei at the same time.Xiao Yao laid on the garden bench and stared at the moon.Zhuan Xu came out and sat beside her \u201cAh Nian left?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cYou mad at me?\u201dXiao Yao turned her head to look at him. His hair was wet like he just washed, and he smelled of cedar. Normally Zhuan Xu disliked scents and it was clear he was trying to get rid of a scent he hated with the cedar. Xiao Yao asked \u201cHow does it feel to live a dissolute womanizing life?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled bitterly \u201cA nightmare! Not just women feel dirty being with a man they don\u2019t like, a man equally feels dirty and disgusting. Honestly, I would rather be stabbed a few times.\u201dXiao Yao laughed at his pain \u201cThis time you are in the most pain, and since you are inflicting the suffering on yourself, what do I have to be mad at you about?\u201d Compared to the pain Zhuan Xu inflicted on himself, even more was inflicted on Ah Nian.Zhuan Xu rapped Xiao Yao on the head.Xiao Yao grabbed his wrist and felt his pulse \u201cYou have to hurry, The drug addiction is growing stronger. In another half year, even I can\u2019t guarantee I can break you of it.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cSoon, soon. Everything is prepared, just one more step.\u201d\u201cWhat happened the night before?\u201d\u201cSomething was stolen. The map to Cang Lin and Yu Yang\u2019s residences. Likely things they can\u2019t let other people know so they are freaking out. But I don\u2019t think the thief\u2019s target was them, but instead another two maps that don\u2019t appear important. Xuan Yuan has secret weapons and rations depots in the Middle Plains to guard against sudden war. I\u2019m guessing someone has their eyes on the weapons and rations.\u201dXiao Yao was silent for a moment \u201cWant to tell Grandfather?\u201d\u201cWhy tell him? If Xiang Liu sent someone to steal it, then the Sheng Nong resistance army is Cang Lin and Yu Yang\u2019s problem, not mine. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201dXiao Yao relaxed \u201cGege, help me do something. I want to know everything about Fang Feng Bei, from birth until now.\u201dZhuan Xu stared \u201cYou\u2026..you can\u2019t really be seduced by him?\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t stand his probing stare so she turned her face \u201cI\u2019m just curious so can you help me.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d For Xiao Yao to be interested, Zhuan Xu was now curious.He had been out for some time and he grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s sleeve, burying his head in her robe and lightly sniffing like he was cuddling and angrily said \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back! I hate those two women!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cNo one is forcing you to go back.\u201dZhuan Xu laid there for a moment longer and then raised his head and calmly said \u201cFrom the moment my mom committed suicide, I lost the luxury of doing whatever I wanted.\u201dHe got up to leave but Xiao Yao grabbed his sleeve \u201cI can\u2019t save you from those two women, but I can save your nose so you can\u2019t smell them.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and his tight brow relaxed but he smiled gently \u201cNo, I want myself to remember well this humiliation. Later when I slack off, I will remember what I endured to stay alive.\u201dZhuan Xu left and Xiao Yao stared at the moon until she fell asleep.She returned to her room at dawn and the pallet was neatly arranged but empty. Xiao Yao sat down and put her hands together and fiddled with the bow callous on her hands.Three months later, the ca.n.a.l project that Zhuan Xu was in charge of hit a major fallout. The Yellow Emperor was enraged and ordered him back to Cao Yun Court and was to not leave the mountaintop and reflect.Sheng Nong Mountain had a small Palace that hadn\u2019t been lived in hundreds of years and had fallen into disrepair. The Sheng Nong tribal elders were displeased and requested the Yellow Emperor to maintain and renovate it since Sheng Nong Mountain was the symbol of the Middle Plains, especially the main palace Zhi Jin Court.The officials conferred, those who were too powerful wouldn\u2019t want to go to the decrepit Sheng Nong Mountain to waste their time and sending someone too lowly ranked would be an insult. This project appeared important but was actually a terrible a.s.signment.The officials conferred secretly with Ciu Liang and s.h.i.+ Ju that the Yellow Emperor was thinking of sending one of his grandsons. Those two freaked out \u2013 Sheng Nong Mountain had twenty eight peaks and to fix each and every palace on each peak, they wouldn\u2019t be able to come home for eighty to a hundred years! If they fixed it all it would be fine, if they didn\u2019t, the Middle Plains folks would constantly be sending complaints to the Yellow Emperor. Plus their grandfather was so ill, if anything happened to him, they would be thousands of miles away\u2026..s.h.i.+ Ju got a great idea and they conferred with their dad, the idea would allow them to avoid this a.s.signment and get Zhuan Xu out of Xuan Yuan Castle for good. Otherwise if he stayed, he might get back on the Yellow Emperor\u2019s good side since only Zhuan Xu could live in Cao Yun Court with the Yellow Emperor and see him everyday, whereas they couldn\u2019t even go unless they were summoned.The officials pretended to confer in court and one suggested sending Zhuan Xu. The others all quickly supported the idea, and the Yellow Emperor agreed after thinking over it for a night.Xiao Yao had never been to Sheng Nong Mountain and was curious since it was the residence for the Sheng Nong royal family for generations. She asked the Yellow Emperor to let her go play there.Cang Lin and Yu Yang both objected since she was the Gao Xing Princess. They suggested sending her back to Gao Xing, but who knew the Yellow Emperor would fly into a rage \u201cXiao Yao is the granddaughter of me and my Empress. Xuan Yuan Kingdom was built by me and my Empress. As long as I am alive, she can live in Xuan Yuan for her entire life, play all over Xuan Yuan, do whatever she wants!\u201d The Yellow Emperor roared this with his spiritual power projecting his voice and each and every word boomed out of the court so the everyone in the vicinity heard it.Cang Ling and Yu Yang didn\u2019t know why he flew into such a rage but they all got on their knees to beg forgiveness. In no time at all, the entire vast wilderness spread the news that the Yellow Emperor viewed Xiao Yao was someone very dear to him, as dear as if she was the granddaughter of his son and not of his daughter.Xiao Yao knew the Yellow Emperor purposely said that for everyone to hear but didn\u2019t know why. She felt the Yellow Emperor was worried about her going to the Middle Plains and worried that the Grand Emperor\u2019s authority wasn\u2019t enough to protect her so he had to throw his added authority on top. To let everyone know that she was the bloodline of the Yellow Emperor and Xi Ling Lie Zhu, so to harm her would be a grave insult to the Yellow Emperor and Lei Zhu.But who could hurt her? Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t figure it out. She never had any blood feud with anyone. She felt she was over thinking it and maybe the Yellow Emperor was just trying to find an excuse to put down Cang Lin and Yu Yang.When the Spring flowers bloomed, Zhuan Xu set off for the Middle Plains with a dozen guards in tow. Xiao Yao brought along her maid Shan Hu and a dozen Gao Xing guards and accompanied him.When the cloud carriage rose from Cao Yun Court, Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but look back. Those large phoenix trees were blooming the red phoenix flower and it looked like a red dusk was enveloping the entire court.Zhuan Xu never turned around and silently sat there.The last time she departed from Cao Yun Court, the person beside Xiao Yao was her mom. She waved back at Zhuan Xu standing underneath the phoenix tree and thought she was going to be back soon to swing with Zhuan Xu gege. But neither the innocent Xiao Yao nor the grown up too fast Zhuan Xu realized that parting would be for three hundred years.This departure, they both realized that it would be almost impossible to come back and swing under the phoenix tree together. And even if they did come back, who knows how many years will have pa.s.sed.Zhuan Xu saw Xiao Yao pressed against the window looking out and said \u201cI will plant a red phoenix flower tree in Sheng Nong Mountain\u2019s Zhi Jin Court and fasten a swing on it for you.\u201dXiao Yao sat up and looked at him. Zhuan Xu gave everything up to go to the Middle Plains. He chose a path of no return. If he couldn\u2019t plant the phoenix tree in Zhi Jin Court, then he likely would never be able to return to Cao Yun Court to see that phoenix tree. So he had to pay any price to plant a phoenix tree in Zhi Jin Court.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll love the swinging in Zhi Jin Court.\u201dWhen Xiao Yao came back to Xuan Yuan, it was to see her mom\u2019s grave and was unrelated to the Yellow Emperor and unrelated to the politics in court. In everyone\u2019s eyes, she was just the Gao Xing Princess who happened to share blood ties with the Yellow Emperor. But this time, Xiao Yao choosing to go to the Middle Plains with Zhuan Xu, she was pretty much telling the world that she was standing on Zhuan Xu\u2019s side. In everyone\u2019s eyes, Xiao Yao became Zhuan Xu\u2019s little cousin who happened to share blood ties with the Grand Emperor. Zhuan Xu\u2019s each and every action would impact her, and might even cost her life.Zhuan Xu looked at his hand and scoffed \u201cAm I too selfish? I really ought to send you away like I did with Ah Nian.\u201dXiao Yao held Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand \u201cGrandfather said something right, I am the blood of the Xuan Yuan Empress. Within the entire Cao Yun Court, there is only you and I left of that bloodline. Grandmother told us that we have to be there for each other. If you are fine now then I can ignore this, but the way you are now, even if I leave I won\u2019t be able to stop worrying.\u201dZhuan Xu said in pain \u201cSupporting each other? All I see is you supporting me, I don\u2019t support you.\u201dXiao Yao shook Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? We G.o.ds live for a long time and you\u2019ll be helping me one day. I am pretty clever, deciding to help you today so that in the future you can take care of everything for me!Xiao Yao saw Zhuan Xu\u2019s brows were still tightly knit so she leaned her head on his shoulder and said in a very low very sweet voice \u201cDoes things need to be so clearly delineated between us?\u201dZhuan Xu was still too serious but his brow slowly unknotted and he softly called out \u201cXiao Yao\u201d before tightly holding her hand back.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know what awaited her and Zhuan Xu in the Middle Plains. That was a place that the Grand Emperor\u2019s influence did not extend, and the Yellow Emperor\u2019s authority was still limited. The most powerful clans and families of the vast wilderness were all based there, along with Sheng Nong Mountain that the Sheng Nong resistance army dreamed about reclaiming. There was the most beautiful vistas and the most bustling commence\u2026..no matter what awaited them there, Xiao Yao knew they had to keep walking towards it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter starts the second volume of the novel Lost You Forever. This volume has the English t.i.tle Love You Forever and really does spend a lot of time on that pesky feeling called love. I think it\u2019s safe now to reveal my personal preferences in this novel, I kept it close to the vest so I don\u2019t influence readers and everyone can form their own first impressions of the characters and this magical expansive world they inhabit. My favorite character in the novel is Xiang Liu. By far. Xiao Yao is easily my second favorite character, and might even be equal to how much I adore Xiang Liu\u2019s complexity and depth but for the way her character kinda faltered for me in the third volume. It\u2019s really just grasping at tiny differences in straws because ultimately I love all the leads so so much for their vivid and unique characters. Zhuan Xu is totally my boo and I\u2019ll be the first to defend all his actions because boy has had it rough and to survive and rule the world in the end isn\u2019t an easy road to walk down. Even though I\u2019m crazy in love with Xiang Liu, s.h.i.+pping him with Xiao Yao is like a recipe for combustible disaster. All signs point to Jing being the best choice for the girl in the end, and really his sweetness and perseverance is incredibly swoon worthy.Who doesn\u2019t want a man who does whatever you want and you actually believe him when he says that he will give up everything for you.\u00a0I tend to find Jing mostly dull as beans to read in the novel but that doesn\u2019t lessen my love for him. Compared to the other two male leads, he is mostly lacking in sparks with Xiao Yao but what they share it a desire to live a long long life together, and I root for the maturity in knowing that romance may burn out and pa.s.sion is fleeting but a lifetime dedication is precious indeed. The problem with this novel is that the three guys in Xiao Yao\u2019s life love her in their own way, and it\u2019s hard not to wish there was three of her so each one gets a Xiao Yao and everyone gets a happy ending. If folks can put their personal character preferences aside in deciding whether or not to keep reading this novel, I guarantee the journey truly is rewarding and the wondrous world Tong Hua created unforgettable. Chapter 18 takes all the characters from Xuan Yuan Mountain over to the Middle Plains and the legendary Sheng Nong Mountain. This chapter also is the first real scene where Xiao Yao is in the same place as all three of her guys and we also get to see Xiao Yao spend quality time with each male lead. I honestly can watch her hanging out with such amazing guys forever.Chapter 18 \u2013 Green Plum Collects Longing:Sheng Nong Mountain was located in the center of the Middle Plains. The vistas were beautiful and awe-inspiring, with twenty-eight peaks in total. The North was connected to the center of the military outpost in Zhe Province, the South linked to the rich lands of the Yen Province, the East was protected by the Dan River, and the West was the famous Zhi Yi Castle.Zhi Yi was once the capital of the Sheng Nong Kingdom and was severely damaged in the battle between Sheng Nong and Xuan Yuan. The riches faded and the people suffered. A hundred years ago, Sheng Nong tribe\u2019s Little Zhu Rong was tasked with becoming the castle warden of Zhi Yi Castle and running the entire Middle Plains. He convinced the Qing Qiu Tu Shan clan\u2019s Grand Madam to make Zhi Yi the center of the Tu Shan businesses again. Little Zhu Rong\u2019s wife was the daughter of the Chi Sui clan leader, and the Chi Sui clan was the head of the Four Great Clans, so with the support of the Chi Sui and Tu Shan clans within a short time Zhi Yi Castle was once again the most prosperous bustling place in all of the Middle Plains.Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu arrived in the Middle Plains a month ago and he ought to have gone straight to Sheng Nong Mountain to do his official duty, but instead he stayed in Zhi Yi Castle and wined and dined every day and night. This news traveled back to Cang Lin and Yu Yang and they felt even more relieved.It wasn\u2019t until the Yellow Emperor sent an envoy to chastise Zhuan Xu did he reluctantly decamp to Sheng Nong Mountain.Sheng Nong Mountain\u2019s Zhi Jin Summit had Zhi Jin Palace, the residence of each Flame Emperor. It was the symbol of the entire Middle Plains so the guards stationed there were very careful and the Palace remained in good condition. Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao lived in Zhi Jin Palace and to give respect to the Flame Emperors of the past, neither wanted to live in the residences where the Flame Emperor or Flame Empress used to live. They picked two small courts to the side, reportedly where the Sheng Nong Princess and Prince once lived.Despite being sent by the Yellow Emperor, Zhuan Xu arrived in Sheng Nong Mountain and was still nonchalant and goofing off. He had two beautiful personal maids, one refined and the other seductive, both were world cla.s.s beauties.Every night Zhuan Xu would party with his maids leaving him without any energy during the day. Sometimes he would fall asleep in the middle of talking. Thank G.o.d when Zhuan Xu left Xuan Yuan Castle, the Yellow Emperor sent along officials that understood architecture so they handled all the renovation details and went to Zhuan Xu for the final yes or no.No one dared touch Zhi Jin Palace so after much discussion it was decided to start from the side courts first. All Zhuan Xu needed to do was tour the renovation sites and offer casual comments.During the entire Palace renovation, the workers and the materials were the two main necessities. The Tu Shan clan provided all the best quality materials at a reasonable price and the officials conferred and urged Zhuan Xu to buy everything from them. The quality was guaranteed and later on if something happened, they could go ask the Tu Shan clan to deal with it.Zhaun Xu heard this and drowsily said sure.Everyone thought Zhuan Xu was whoring all night so he had no energy during the day, but in reality Xiao Yao was helping him detox from the drug addiction.The two beautiful maids serving Zhuan Xu, the refined one was Jin Xuan, the seductive one was Xiao Xiao. The first time Xiao Yao saw Jin Xuan, she recognized her as a true beauty, but the once ordinary looking Xiao Xuao turned out to be an incomparable beauty as well once she washed off her disguise makeup.Jin Xuan was Zhuan Xu\u2019s information collector and her skill was gathering data. The seductive Xiao Xiao was one of the personal guards that Zhuan Xu trained and one of his best. Xiao Yao sighed, one really can\u2019t judge another on looks. Xiao Xiao was unwavering in her loyalty to Zhuan Xu, if he handed her a knife she would slit her throat immediately at his one nod. As for Jin Xuan, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know what Zhuan Xu was thinking. She wasn\u2019t as trusting of people as Zhuan Xu, but if he chose to keep Jin Xuan beside him, then she chose to trust Jin Xuan for now as well.Every night, Zhuan Xu would be locked in a sealed safe room to endure indescribable agony. He thought he was mentally strong enough to control it, but the drug addiction was greater than even he antic.i.p.ated. It controlled his mind and when the addiction flared up, he would howl in a screaming raw voice that shredded his throat, ripping at his own flesh, even slamming into the wall to harm himself.Zhuan Xu allowed no one to see this most deplorable side of him except for Xiao Yao.An addict in detox usually chose to tie himself up, but Xiao Yao knew Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t want to tie himself up. If he didn\u2019t use his own will power to detox from the addiction, then he would come to doubt whether his choice to go down this path was correct. So when Jin Xuan handed her a dragon tendon rope, Xiao Yao turned her down \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need it. The only rope that can tie him is his own willpower.\u201dEvery night, Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu would hide in the sealed safe room together. Xiao Yao would talk to him, telling him all sorts of things, or asking Zhuan Xu to tell her stories, anything to divert his attention. When he couldn\u2019t control himself, she would use her body to press down on him and it would usually make him more alert.During the most painful nights, Zhuan Xu would hurt Xiao Yao during his attacks. But the moment Xiao Yao bled, Zhuan Xu would quickly regain consciousness. He laid on the ground with his arms wrapped around his knees and curled into a ball shaking. All of his strength was used to combat the drug addiction and he was as weak as an infant.Xiao Yao held him and for whatever reason, she started to hum their childhood lullabies. Some her mom sang to her, others her aunt sang to Zhuan Xu. Many lyrics she had forgotten so she hummed it.Hearing her singing, Zhuan Xu would survive another attack and gradually calm down until he fell asleep.As he dreamed, there were tears in the corner of his eyes and Xiao Yao felt hers were wet as well.Inside this sealed room, Zhuan Xu seemed so weak. She was as well. They were once the most precious treasures in their moms arms. Carefully protected and loved. If their moms knew what their precious babies were enduring, would they regret abandoning them?Every night Zhuan Xu battled the drug addiction, and every day he had to handle official matters.Whatever information Jin Xuan collected, he would review it all and then give instructions to Xiao Xiao. She would spread the information through their network of trusted guards.Jin Xuan could tell Zhuan Xu was sending orders to his secret guards for something. He seemed on the surface really unreliable, letting his subordinates run the entire Palace renovation, but in truth Jin Xuan knew that he had carefully inspected each and every court and residence in the Palace and used his shaking hands to take personal notes.Jin Xuan saw former drug addicts, no matter how strong, all became destroyed by the addiction. But Zhuan Xu continued to battle the addiction and still handle official matters. Jin Xuan finally understood what Xiao Yao said: the only rope in this world that could bind Zhuan Xu was his willpower.After surviving the hardest few days, Zhuan Xu used his incredible willpower to control even the pain. He never showed any weakness in front of Xiao Yao again, and even if the addition came, he would put his arm in his mouth and viciously bite down to stifle the pain.Drops of blood trickled down but Xiao Yao appeared not to notice and continued talking. After the pain pa.s.sed and Zhuan Xu laid spent on the ground, then Xiao Yao would walk over and apply medicine for him.Night after night, Zhuan Xu\u2019s pain lessened until he would have no expression whatsoever. He would sit there and quietly listen to Xiao Yao talk or sing and that was enough for him to deal with the pain.Two months later, Zhuan Xu successfully detoxed from the addiction.It wasn\u2019t until even the remnants of the drugs in his system were completely flushed did Xiao Yao relax at last.Zhuan Xu continued his former life, playing with the maids at night and sleeping during the day, only Xiao Yao, Jin Xuan, and Xiao Xiao knew what he went though.Jin Xuan once promised Zhu Yu that she would treat Zhuan Xu as her master. She admired him for being handsome, capable, and talented, but now she grew to respect him and was in awe.A few boxes were placed before Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu said \u201cThat Tu Shan Jing has gone crazy!\u201dHe opened the boxes and inside contained one hundred and five bottles of wine. From when she and Zhuan Xu arrived in the Middle Plains, it had been exactly one hundred and five days.The first day they arrived, Jing asked to see her. But Xiao Yao needed to helped Zhuan Xu detox so she declined until she had time to see him.Jing was very obedient and never asked to see her again. Only every fifteen days, he would send a box of plum wine exactly in the amount of the days that pa.s.sed.In the past, Xiao Yao could drink all this wine. But she was helping Zhuan Xu detox so she didn\u2019t dare drink. She put it all away and now the wine cellar had hundred of bottles.Zhuan Xu took out a bottle \u201cWhat kind of promise involves fifteen between you two? I notice Jing likes to play with fifteen as if reminding you of something.\u201dXiao Yao opened a bottle and gulped it \u201cA few months of no wine, I sure miss it.\u201dZhuan Xu played with the bottle in his hand and casually said \u201cMissing wine is fine, don\u2019t miss the person.\u201dXiao Yao made a face at him \u201cSend word for me that I can see him now.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at the bottle in his hand and his lips were pressed in a tight line.Xiao Yao called \u201cZhuan Xu?\u201dZhuan Xu appeared to snap out of it and opened his bottle and drank it before saying with a smile \u201cSure.\u201dThat night Xiao Yao was sleeping when she opened her eyes and saw a astral projection of a little nine-tailed fox sitting next to her pillow staring intently at her.Xiao Yao laughed and put on her clothes as she got up \u201cWhere is your master?\u201dThe fox pa.s.sed through the wall and Xiao Yao opened the door and ran after it.There were many courts in Zhi Jin Palace and it had been hundreds of years since any were lived it so it appeared desolate. The little white fox jumped and lead Xiao Yao down a quiet path until it reached a forest where a white crane was elegantly waiting for her.Xiao Yao recognized it as Jing\u2019s winged ride named Li Li.Xiao Yao smiled and greeted Li Li before vaulting on its back.The Sheng Nong air s.p.a.ce was controlled by a spiritual power grid that prevented people from entering, but within the mountain as long as it was at low alt.i.tude and avoided the guards, then it was safe.Li Li took Xiao Yao to one of its peaks shrouded in clouds. There was a waterfall that ended in a large pool, and not far from there was a wooden hut which was a few yards from the edge of a sharp cliff drop.Jing stood there wearing a green robe staring at the sky. Standing still and silent under the moonlight, he appeared just like a stalk of bamboo, elegant and true.The white crane descended and the little white fox ran into Jing\u2019s sleeve and disappeared.Xiao Yao jumped down \u201cI asked Zhuan Xu to send word this morning, wasn\u2019t expecting to see you for a few days.\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao and couldn\u2019t speak. Since their Xuan Yuan Castle parting, it had been seventeen months since he last saw her. The first months he was prepared since he knew Zhuan Xu needed to plan how to come to the Middle Plains, but these last three months had been sheer torture. He knew Xiao Yao had things to do and couldn\u2019t see him, but his heart worried that she didn\u2019t want to see him because she no longer missed him.Xiao Yao asked \u201cHey, why are you not talking?\u201dJing replied \u201cYou said last time\u2026.you wanted to wash my hair. The tree leaves are grown now.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cOkay, let\u2019s find a sunny day and go pick leaves.\u201dJing finally relaxed and smiled.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWas it hard to come see me?\u201d\u201cSheng Nong Mountain has tight barriers to the outside but lax within. Tu Shan clan can enter easily now and walk around the whole mountain. Only Zhi Jin Palace where you and Zhuan Xu live is tightly guarded. I don\u2019t want to alert the guards so had little fox go get you.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly realized \u201cYou have been close by this whole time?\u201d Only being close to Sheng Nong Mountain could he receive word in the morning and get here by nighttime.\u201cYes, I came a few times already to inspect the Palace renovation and looked around all the peaks. I chanced upon this place and saw it was very remote and quiet and really liked it.\u201dXiao Yao looked around \u201cThis place is nice, ringed by cliffs on three sides and only one path down the mountain which is secluded and hidden. But who on Sheng Nong Mountain would live in a wooden hut?\u201d\u201cI asked the guards and no one knows. All they know is that this peak is called Cao Ao Crest and is a Sheng Nong forbidden area.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face changed and she rushed into the hut while Jing walked on the outside of her to s.h.i.+eld her from the cliff side.She opened the door and inside looked untouched. A rug was on the pallet, there was fresh fruit on plates on the table, two vases sat on the windows with fresh flowers in it. The hut was very simply decorated and warm, like it\u2019s owner merely went out for the day.Jing said \u201cWhen I found this place, I tidied it up a little but it wasn\u2019t dirty before. The owner must be a truly powerful being with great spiritual powers. Even after thousands of years, the spiritual essence gathered here is still strong so this hut hasn\u2019t aged at all. It\u2019s hard to believe there would be someone with powers so strong.\u201dXiao Yao glanced around \u2013 everything was the most simple, revealing the owner didn\u2019t like luxury and only wanted to live easily.Xiao Yao sat on the pallet \u201cDo you know who the owner of the hut is?\u201dJing could tell Xiao Yao knew \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThat most infamous, vicious, brutal devil monster in the entire vast wilderness. I flipped through the books in the Sheng Nong library and read that the Sheng Nong Flame Emperor deemed Cao Ao Crest a forbidden area because of him.\u201dThere were a lot of demons, beasts, and monsters in the vast wilderness that were called brutal and vicious, but to earn the \u201cmost infamous\u201d moniker there was ever only one such person \u201cQi Yo?\u201dXiao Yao nodded with a smile \u201cEveryone thought he craved power and wealth but who would have known his residence in Sheng Nong Mountain is so simple.\u201dJing knew Xiao Yao\u2019s mother died in battle with Qi Yo and apologized \u201cI didn\u2019t know this was his residence. Let\u2019s leave!\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cWhy make it difficult for oneself over someone who has been dead for hundreds of years. You like this place, I like this place, let\u2019s treat this place as our\u2026.home. We can meet here.\u201dJing was a bit red-faced since he did have the same idea in mind when he was cleaning the place up.Xiao Yao walked to the window and looked at the vases of flowers \u201cDid you pick these?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cHave you been well? Did you find the spy?\u201d\u201cI did, your idea was great, it was Lan Xiang.\u201dThese personal maids were with Jing since he was small so there was a lot of affection so Xiao Yao said \u201cDid you decide to forgive her?\u201d\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t reveal who she betrayed me for so I don\u2019t want to kill her but can\u2019t keep her. I had Jing Ye take her away but Jing Ye grew up with her since they were small so she was so angry and must\u2019ve have said something to her. Lan Xiang committed suicide.\u201d Jing looked sad \u201cActually I know who she betrayed me for. I had Jing Ye send her away to end her value to the person using her, and if my brother had no use for her and didn\u2019t contact her, then she would forget my brother.\u201dXiao Yao remembered that monster fish and the man riding in on the waves with the sun s.h.i.+ning on him, his manly power was very different from Jing\u2019s quiet stillness, and it was even more attractive to a woman.Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill Hou?\u201d\u201cEven though mother was always unfair, but since birth he never treated me poorly. We had no dad and he got no love from mother, so he placed all the familial love he craved on me. He was my age but acted like an older brother and dad surrogate, always taking care of me. When I got complimented he would beam with pride. I once asked him why and he said that even if he hurt, I was his beloved younger brother and he was proud of me. We were loving brothers that were the envy of all. He really was an exceptional older brother for four hundred years. Xiao Yao, I can\u2019t kill him!\u201d Jing\u2019s voice conveyed his sadness and regret and guilt, because he knew his choice would bind him and bind Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao walked over and put her head on his shoulder \u201cI complain that you\u2019re too soft-hearted, but actually\u2026.I would rather you be soft-hearted.\u201d She was surrounded by too many cold-hearted people \u2013 her grandfather, her dad, Zhuan Xu, two maternal side uncles, all those cousins, even herself. They were all ruthless, which is why Jing\u2019s soft-hearted nature made her feel safe and she liked it.Jing embraced Xiao Yao and she kept her head on his shoulder and they stood there.\u201cXiao Yao, what is it?\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu had matters that needed my help so I\u2019ve been so busy and so tired lately. Not my body tired, more like my spirit is tired. I worried about making a mistake and always busy but it made me think a lot of the past. It\u2019s unbelievable that Zhuan Xu and I didn\u2019t have parents, and yet here we are, both of us grew up.\u201dJing held her \u201cIf I knew you were tired, I wouldn\u2019t have come see you tonight!\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThe heart being tired isn\u2019t cured by sleep.\u201d She looked out at the pool and took his hand \u201cGo play in the water with me.\u201dIt was Summer so the water wasn\u2019t cold as Xiao Yao jumped right in. She swam one circle and dove underwater thinking it wasn\u2019t too deep but it was much deeper than she thought so before she hit bottom she needed to come up for air.Jing sat on a rock smiling at her.Xiao Yao rapped her head \u201cI\u2019m so stupid!\u201d She took out the fish amethyst from her robe \u201cI forgot you got me this treasure.\u201dXiao Yao sprawled on a rock splas.h.i.+ng water with her feet \u201cLet\u2019s go play in the ocean next time. It\u2019s so beautiful in the bottom of the ocean and even playing all night it doesn\u2019t get boring.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dXiao Yao thought about Xiang Liu and buried her face in her arms and went silent. She didn\u2019t know if he was Xiang Liu or Fang Feng Bei right now. Suddenly she grabbed Jing\u2019s arm and pulled him into the water \u201cGo to the bottom with me.\u201dShe didn\u2019t wait for Jing to answer before putting the fish amethyst in her mouth and diving down with Jing.She pulled Jing down with her but the pool was so deep there was no bottom in sight. Even those with strong powers couldn\u2019t stand too long underwater so Jing grabbed her hand and pointed to the top indicating he was going up.Xiao Yao shook her head and wouldn\u2019t let him. She wanted him with her.Jing\u2019s face was changing color but he allowed Xiao Yao to continue to pull him down. She wrapped her arms around his neck and put her lips on his to pa.s.s him air. Jing\u2019s body stiffened and he was so shocked he started choking.Xiao Yao quickly gave him another breath of air.Jing\u2019s entire body was stiff but he descended with her until they hit bottom. It was dark and nothing was there so Xiao Yao pulled Jing up. He seemed to snap out of it and used his strength to swim up with her. She pointed to her lips indicating for him to get another breath of air but he didn\u2019t. Jing used his one breath and made it to the surface but he was in pain and gasping on the rock.Xiao Yao asked angrily \u201cWhy?\u201dJing stared in the distance and said in a low voice \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t have me in your eyes back there.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and walked towards the hut. She didn\u2019t have much power so she took her off wet clothes and dried herself before huddling in the blanket. \u201cYou can come in now.\u201dJing sat down on the pallet and took a towel to dry her hair and then a comb to brush it. Years ago, Xiao Liu took care of s.h.i.+ Qi like this, and s.h.i.+ Qi used to take care of Xiao Liu like this. Gradually the mood warmed up between them and both smiled.Xiao Yao sighed \u201cIn the past we saw each other every day, not once every few years. Sometimes when I want to talk to people now, I can\u2019t find them.\u201dJing said \u201cIn the future Tu Shan clan can often come to Sheng Nong Mountain so its easy for me to come see you. Qing Qiu is also close to Sheng Nong Mountain so it\u2019s easy for you to come to Qing Qiu.\u201d\u201cThe Heavens seem to be helping us. Zhuan Xu wanted to come to the Middle Plains and there was a Palace here that needed to be renovated. Zhuan Xu and I moved in and the Palace restoration needs big businesses like you guys so the Tu Shan clan becomes the supplier choice making it easy for you to come and go.\u201d Xiao Yao glanced over \u201cDid Feng Long and Zhuan Xu con you onto doing all this?\u201dJing replied \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t them, I wanted to do all this.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI\u2019m not blaming you since the Palace needs to be renovated so rather than give money to others why not to the Tu Shan clan. With your connection with my Gege, if only you help him it\u2019s not a good thing but now he can return the favor so it is a relief for him.\u201dThis was actually exactly what Jing thought. Feng Long had grand ambitions and wanted to work with Zhuan Xu to build an empire. But what he wanted was simply to be close to Xiao Yao. But if he said it no one would believe him. So let others think he wants more money and now Zhuan Xu steered some money his way, he feels more relieved and this relations.h.i.+p could continue growing.Jing looked at Xiao Yao and smiled.Xiao Yao angrily grabbed his hand and bit it hard \u201cAm I in your eyes?\u201dJing hurt in his hand but was happy in his heart \u201cYes.\u201d______________________________The second day, Zhuan Xu was already up when Xiao Yao came back.He was having breakfast when Xiao Yao sat down and silently started to eat.He asked coolly \u201cWent to see Jing?\u201dXiao Yao grinned \u201cYup.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI know he means more to you but he\u2019s not Ye s.h.i.+ Qi anymore, he\u2019s Tu Shan Jing. I received news that the Grand Madam is ill and wants Jing to quickly a.s.sume the clan leader mantle. He carries the weight of his entire clan on his back and can\u2019t do whatever he wants. Jing and Fang Feng Yi Yang is engaged and the Fang Feng family won\u2019t give up a chance to marry with the Tu Shan clan. Jing can\u2019t end this engagement easily! Stop tossing yourself in head first!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s smile faded and she mumbled \u201cI know.\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing more when he saw the way she was.After dinner, Xiao Yao took out a box \u201cFor you!\u201dZhuan Xu opened it and it was a furry doll that was a spiritual object made with the tail of a Nine-tailed fox. He tossed it back \u201cI don\u2019t want it!\u201d\u201cGege, you have to take it! I asked Jing to make this for you. It combined spiritual power and this doll can only transform into you. You need to use it to create a subst.i.tute, and one so real even Jin Xuan and Xiao Xiao can\u2019t tell the difference immediately. I know you are angry at the Nine-tailed fox who hurt me, but that just means you need to use it to protect yourself now. If you are protected, I can worry less!\u201dActually, Zhuan Xi didn\u2019t want it not just because it was from the Nine-tailed fox, but more because another man made it for Xiao Yao. But he saw how serious she was and his heart softened. No matter who made the doll and what it was made from, inside contained all the care she had for him. He had to survive so that he could continue to take care of her. Zhuan Xu reached out his hand.Xiao Yao put the doll in his hand and he gripped it \u201cI have something for you too.\u201dZhuan Xu handed a scroll to her \u201cThis contains all the background information on Fang Feng Bei.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned for a moment before taking it. She spent the entire day poring over the background report.The report started from the moment Fang Feng Bei was born.Fang Feng Bei\u2019s life was exactly that of a second son in a large family, living an ordinary life. He was good at learning the spiritual powers, but because his brother and sister were even better and they were born of the first wife, no matter how hard he worked his brother and sister were always more prominent. Because he was so bitter, he ended up with a gambling addiction.Around four hundred and eighty years ago, the teenage Fang Feng Bei ran away from home to earn money to repay his gambling debts. He went to the North Pole to look for ice crystals. He was gone for almost fifty years, which wasn\u2019t a very long time to be away from home for the G.o.ds, but because he went to a place that was dangerous beyond comprehension, his family a.s.sumed he died there. Who could have expected he would suddenly return home with lots of ice crystals. One would call it returning in glory.Xiao Yao felt those nearly fifty years was very suspicious. During that length of time missing, even if Fang Feng Bei returned changed people would a.s.sume he had endured great hards.h.i.+p in the North Pole and accept his growing up. But what made him accepted as the same guy was that he spent the next four years diligently taking care of his sick mother to the degree that was astounding, from feeding her every meal and medicine to sitting beside her every day. Even now four hundred years later, if people in the know were asked about Fang Feng Bei, they would still say very proudly \u201cBei is very filial.\u201dAfter his mom died shortly after he returned, in those four hundred years since he lived the perfect life of a rich family spare son and dissolute playboy. He wasn\u2019t greatly used by the family and he also didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but he was very easygoing and loved to spend money, so he would do all sorts of random things to earn his keep. He would disappear for chunks of time from months to even years, and his friends and family all got used to it.Because Fang Feng Bei\u2019s personality was very relaxed and didn\u2019t like to fight for anything, his relations.h.i.+p with his brother Fang Feng Zheng and his sister Fang Feng Yi Yang was very cordial.Xiao Yao sighed. If what she suspected was true, the real Fang Feng Bei died over four hundred years ago and no one knows the current one is fake. Because Xiang Liu had been living as Fang Feng Bei for over four hundred years, even if he was fake initially over time he was accepted as the real one \u2013 so the Fang Feng Bei everyone has known in his entire adult life has always been Xiang Liu.But why? What was Xiang Liu trying to get out of it? Fang Feng family was prominent enough but he could have impersonated a son from an even more powerful family. Plus Fang Feng Bei was concubine born so he had no influence in the Fang Feng family. If Xiang Liu wanted anything, he would have chosen better.Xiao Yao mulled it over for a long time but couldn\u2019t figure out Xiang Liu\u2019s reason for doing it. This was a pretense that wasn\u2019t just for a year or two, he was already Fang Feng Bei before she was even born. Xiao Yao gave up trying to figure it out.In the middle of Summer, Zhuan Xu received an invitation from Xing Yue and Feng Long inviting him and Xiao Yao to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence for their upcoming birthday celebration.The G.o.ds had a long life span so birthdays were not a big deal and usually only celebrated on whole numbers like hundreds or thousands. Actually, they lived so long the G.o.ds would long forget how old they were. Only in the powerful families that really catered to their kids did birthdays get celebrated more often.Feng Long and Xing Yue were twins so they celebrated birthdays together by inviting friends and having a small getogether.Xiao Yao arrived to discover it wasn\u2019t a small getogether, Feng Long and Xing Yue were very popular in the vast wilderness, which made sense since both were single, wealthy, scions of the most powerful of families, good looking, they were probably the most eligible kids in the vast wilderness.The maid went to announce them and Feng Long and Xing Yue came out personally to bring them in. Xing Yue was very warm and immediately linked arms with Xiao Yao \u201cYou never attend any banquets so my brother and I were worried you wouldn\u2019t come today either.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI\u2019m really lazy so I turn down all invitations, but since this banquet invitation came from you and Feng Long, I had to come.\u201dEven if what she said was merely a polite excuse, Xing Yue was still happy to hear it.Xing Yue and Feng Long led them into a large garden that had fake rock mountains, innumerable strange and exotic plants, and a stream winding through it until it became a waterfall descending into a small pond. The garden helped to dissipate the Summer heat.Xing Yue pointed to the rock mountain \u201cIt looks just like a fake rock mountain but is actually a spiritual maze. My brother and I were wild as kids so our dad created this maze and we could get lost in it for an entire day. Today there is a crowd so if you like some peace and quiet, we can go explore it later.\u201dBecause it was so hot, a lot of people were wearing wooden sandals and under the tree awning two young girls took off their sandals and played in the water by the pool.Xing Yue laughed \u201cThat is the Tan family and the Shen family daughters. They are cousins, and my maternal grandmother is the daughter of the Shen family so I am also their extended cousin. Most of the relatives are gathered in this courtyard.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cHow can you not be? Your maternal grandmother Empress Lei Zhu was the daughter of the Xi Ling clan, one of the Four Great Clans. You maternal grandmother is actually the cousin of my paternal grandmother, so that makes us extended cousins as well. Plus the current Xi Ling clan leader married the Kang family daughter who is cousins with the Shen family\u2026.which means we\u2019re related that way as well.\u201dAs Xing Yue talked and walked Xiao Yao\u2019s mouth was open \u201cI\u2019m totally dizzy from all that relating.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cI heard from my grandmother that the Xi Ling clan is also related to the Tu Shan clan through marriage a few generations ago as well. If we go down our relations, not sure if we\u2019re cousins, or aunts, or grand-aunts.\u201dThey had walked into a room by then and everyone laughed to hear that. Xiao Yao sighed and realized why the Yellow Emperor saw the Middle Plains as a challenge. All the bloodlines were connected and even if the clans and families were rivals, when push come to shove they would all unite against an outsider enemy. Even more surprising was to hear how powerful the Xi Ling clan and her maternal grandmother was. Everyone wanted to be related to the Xi Ling clan and Lei Zhu, and in comparison the bloodline of the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor was less influential here.Xing Yue grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s veil \u201cXiao Yao, everyone here are close friends so take off your veil.\u201d It was a large rest area and Yi Yang walked in from another door and added \u201cYes, we never got to see you last time, you can\u2019t keep hiding.\u201dXiao Yao never intended to be different and saw all the other girls were not wearing veils so she took hers off.Xing Yue stared at her intently and then sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know who will have the honor of winning your hand.\u201d She pulled Feng Long over to Xiao Yao and teasingly said \u201cI\u2019m not trying to toot my brother\u2019s horn, but in the vast wilderness there really is no one who can mach up to him.\u201dYi Yang laughed \u201cYou\u2019re shameless!\u201dXing Yue grew up in Xuan Yuan Castle so she had the Xuan Yuan woman\u2019s open att.i.tude \u201cMarriage between eligible partners is a totally fine thing to discuss openly. What\u2019s for shame about it?\u201dFeng Long grew up in the Middle Plains and he felt awkward so said to Zhuan Xu \u201cLet\u2019s go see what Jing is doing\u201d before heading into another room with Zhuan Xu.Xing Yue ordered the maid to pull open the curtains dividing the two rooms and the curtains opened to reveal three people into the adjoining room. Fang Feng Bei and Tu Shan Hou were laying on the pallet drinking and chatting while Jing sat beside the window looking out the window. Feng Long and Zhuan Xu walked over to join him.Xiao Yao was stunned, she was expecting Jing but she was shocked to see Fang Feng Bei was also here!Yi Yang pulled Xiao Yao in \u201cSecond brother, look who is here.\u201d Yi Yang\u2019s gesture was clearly to show that Xiao Yao and Bei had a special relations.h.i.+p for everyone else to see.Fang Feng Bei turned to look at Xiao Yao and broke into a slow smile \u201cYou came as well.\u201dTu Shan Hou stood up to greet Xiao Yao and she politely returned the greeting while thinking with \u201cwhat do you mean you came as well\u201d?Fang Feng Yi Yang winked at Fang Feng Bei \u201cSecond Brother, you take good care of Xiao Yao, I\u2019m headed out to play.\u201dThe garden was huge so in a moment Fang Feng Yi Yang disappeared into the fake mountains.Xiao Yao said in a low voice to Bei \u201cYou come with me!\u201dShe walked ahead, he walked behind, the two of them entered the garden and disappeared behind the fake mountains as well.Standing by the window, Jing, Zhuan Xu, Feng Long, and Xing Yue all saw it clearly. Xing Yue nudged her brother \u201cGege, you are so stupid! If you don\u2019t work harder Xiao Yao will be stolen.\u201d She wanted to complain about Yi Yang daring to push her brother towards Xiao Yao, but with Jing standing there she held it in.Xing Yue said to Zhuan Xu \u201cMy brother is normally smart but around Xiao Yao he turns stupid. You\u2019re close with my brother, you have to help him.\u201dFeng Long was too embarra.s.sed to say anything but bowed to Zhuan Xu which said all.Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cI can only help you create opportunities, as for what Xiao Yao thinks, I can\u2019t decide for her.\u201dXing Yue smiled \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough.\u201dShe thought about it and suggested \u201cLet\u2019s go play outside as well and look for them. Jing gege, it\u2019s boring in here so come with us!\u201dThe four of them walked out together and traveled through the fake mountain paths. Because it was a spiritual maze, the roads s.h.i.+fted and the scenery would change. Plus they would run into friends and stop to chat, so soon the group split up until only Xing Yue and Zhuan Xu were together.When Xing Yue was with Zhuan Xu in public, she was bold and playful, but when it was just the two of them, she was quiet and demure. She knew he had two beautiful maids beside him and it bothered her. Her brother said that if she wanted a man who loved only her, then not to pick Zhuan Xu. If she wanted Zhuan Xu, then she can\u2019t expect him to have only her, and had to have the capacity to accept the other women in his life. Xing Yue claimed to understand but it still hurt a lot.She was in her own world and ran into a rock when the scenery changed and b.u.mped her head. She yowled and rubbed it while Zhuan Xu leaned down to ask \u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt?\u201dXing Yue didn\u2019t feel much pain but for some reason she started to cry.Zhuan Xu comforted her like he would a small child \u201cIt\u2019s just a little red, you didn\u2019t break skin, some ice will make it fine.\u201dXing Yue rushed into his arms and started sobbing loudly. Zhuan Xu was stunned and his arms remained rigid next to his body.Xing Yue didn\u2019t realize that and her arms were tightly hugging his waist, like this was her only way to grab onto him and put her in the most important spot in his heart against the other women.After a few moments, Zhuan Xu reached for Xing Yue to continue comforting her. Xing Yue smelled his manly scent and felt dizzying with need and stepped on her tip toes to pull Zhuan Xu in for a kiss.____________________________Xiao Yao led Fang Feng Bei into the maze but had no idea where to go and got lost everywhere until she reached an area dense with trees. It was a good place to talk privately so Xiao Yao stopped.She whipped around and couldn\u2019t control herself anymore and shouted \u201cAre you insane! This is Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence, if you\u2019re discovered this time I can\u2019t save you again!\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cThis isn\u2019t Xuan Yuan Castle, this is the Middle Plains.\u201dXiao Yao was taken aback. Yes, he\u2019s right! This was the Middle Plains, Sheng Nong Kingdom\u2019s original territory. Even though the Yellow Emperor took over rule of the Middle Plains, but the people still respected General Gong Gong and his loyalty to Sheng Nong in refusing to surrender to Xuan Yuan. Even Little Zhu Rong, he was a descendant of Sheng Nong royalty and was likely secretly loyal to the resistance army. The G.o.ds of the Middle Plains might not openly support the resistance army against the Yellow Emperor, but they also wouldn\u2019t help the Yellow Emperor to catch the resistance army.\u201cFine! Consider me worried for nothing!\u201d Xiao Yao turned to storm off.Fang Feng Bei reached out his hand to lean on the tree and block Xiao Yao\u2019s path \u201cHow\u2019s archery practice coming along?\u201d\u201cI keep up with my practice, my grandfather got a master archer to teach me but his method isn\u2019t suitable for me. His method requires strong powers and he thought I was lazy and insisted I build up my powers first. I learned from him a few times and then fired him.\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cThen I\u2019ll keep teaching you!\u201dXiao Yao stared at him slack jawed \u2013 Xiang Liu wanted to teach her archery? It was absurd.Fang Feng Bei laughed \u201cYou scared? Where did the courage to go taunt a demon snake go?\u201dXiao Yao also laughed \u201cFine, I\u2019ll learn from you.\u201d She needed to learn and who taught her made no difference. Let it be Xiang Liu then!Xiao Yao checked him out from top to bottom and used her finger to poke his arm \u201cDid you already die in the North Pole?\u201dOthers would have no clue what she said but Fang Feng Bei casually replied \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy pick him?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t pick him, he picked me. He was on the verge of death but could not die in peace because of his worry for his mother. So he chose to give me his entire life force and spiritual powers asking only that I be his subst.i.tute and take care of his mother. It\u2019s rare to encounter a G.o.d who willingly lets a demon devour him, and his request wasn\u2019t hard for me to do so I didn\u2019t turn him down.\u201dWhether a G.o.d willingly was devoured made a huge difference. If a G.o.d wasn\u2019t willing and was eaten by a demon, the demon would at most be like ingesting good medicine and could strengthen the body a bit. If a G.o.d was willing to be eaten, the demon could absorb all the spiritual power the G.o.d had trained hard to develop and the demon powers would multiply greatly.Xiao Yao once waiting bitterly for her mother to come back for her and understood the agony of waiting. She was a bit envious of Fang Feng Bei\u2019s mother and she gently asked \u201cWhen you got back, did you see the mother?\u201dFang Feng Bei lowered his eyes \u201cI saw her. She was very weak and alone and brokenhearted without anyone by her side. Because I brought back a lot of ice crystals, the Fang Feng family then moved her to a nicer residence and gave her a maid. I stayed with her for another four years before she died in peace and contentment.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, Fang Feng Bei and Xiang Liu\u2019s deal had a happy ending. But it was hard to imagine Xiang Liu would carefully take care of an old woman for four years. This was likely why no one doubted that he was Fang Feng Bei! Even someone as calculating as Zhuan Xu saw no reason to be suspicious of him.Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou\u2019ve fulfilled your promise so why continued to be Fang Feng Bei?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled coldly with scorn \u201cTo fulfill my promise I put on a show for four years. But in the four hundred years since, I\u2019ve just been myself. Which one of your eyes saw me continuing to pretend to be Fang Feng Bei? Regardless of whether it\u2019s Fang Feng Bei, or Xiang Liu, or Nine-lives, it\u2019s just a name.\u201dHe\u2019s right! The adolescent Fang Feng Bei was vastly different than the adult Fang Feng Bei, but with so long pa.s.sed everyone had long forgotten what Fang Feng Bei used to be like. Xiao Yao thought back and realized that Fang Feng Bei appeared different than Xiang Liu only on the surface, but the way he didn\u2019t give a d.a.m.n about anything and didn\u2019t want for anything was the same att.i.tude. The only difference was Xiang Liu appeared to be him when wearing a battle armor and heading to war in the battlefield, while Fang Feng Bei was him who shed the armor and was enjoying exploring the world.Fang Feng Bei mocked her \u201cYou\u2019ve changed ident.i.ties way more than me. Are all of them play-acting for you?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cNo matter how I change, I am still me. Except I\u2019m not as able to let things go like you are, and some things still matter to me.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Xiang Liu and gingerly asked \u201cIs this\u2026.your real face?\u201d\u201cWho has the patience to wear a fake face for four hundred years. And every time I change I\u2019ll need to worry about changing back wrong.\u201d\u201cYou look like Fang Feng Bei?\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t look alike. But when Fang Feng Bei ran away from home he was still an adolescent and his looks wasn\u2019t full matured. Plus he was injured in the North Pole and his face required a doctor to fix up after he got home.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly felt her heart set down a burden and she smiled \u201cThey all say you have nine faces and eighty-one forms, is that true?\u201dFang Feng Bei glanced at the forest and furrowed his brow before crooking his finger at Xiao Yao. She was scared and shocked and put her hand on her neck \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything mean about you! I was just curious.\u201dFang Feng Bei narrowed his eyes and asked \u201cYou want to come over, or shall I go over?\u201dXiao Yao stop delaying and slowly inched closer to him. Fang Feng Bei lowered his head and Xiao Yao scrunched her neck and used both hands to wrap around it and pleaded \u201cIf you want to bite, bite my arm!\u201dFang Feng Bei whispered right against her ear \u201cSomeone is hiding there spying on us.\u201dXiao Yao was furious at the spy and asked \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t stop it?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cJust reminding you that I\u2019m the spare son so I shouldn\u2019t make a scene.\u201d Fang Feng Bei put an ice arrow in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cPrincess, show me how your archery skill has improved.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhere is the person?\u201dFang Feng Bei held Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and directed it \u201cOver there.\u201dXiao Yao concentrated and threw the arrow from her hand. A shadow moved and a person stepped out from behind the tree.It was Jing!Xiao Yao hurriedly asked \u201cDid it hit you? I didn\u2019t know it was you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dJing handed the arrow to Fang Feng Bei who accepted it and said teasingly \u201cHow come it\u2019s just you alone, didn\u2019t you accompany my sister to play?\u201dXiao Yao knew she had been toyed with by Fang Feng Bei and angrily yelled \u201cFang Feng Bei!\u201dFang Feng Bei turned to her with a twinkle in his eye and a smile \u201cYes? You called me?\u201dXiao Yao was utterly speechless \u2013 she felt right now he was being so manipulative and unreasonable and totally devious, like all the flaws in both Xiang Liu and Fang Feng Bei were combined together into one person. What could she do? She could only hope the next time he was injured he wouldn\u2019t come looking for her!Xiao Yao turned to leave, fairly leaping and jumping out of there, she couldn\u2019t wait to get away from that d.a.m.n demon!Jing moved to follow her and took two steps before Fang Feng Bei caught up with a smile and tapped his shoulder before pointing in the other direction \u201cI think I just saw my sister over there looking for you.\u201dJing had no choice but to stop and watch Fang Feng Bei and Xiao Yao disappear into the forest.Xiao Yao turned to glare at Fang Feng Bei and snarked \u201cWas that fun, toying someone so straightforward?\u201dTu Shan Jing straightforward? Fang Feng Bei\u2019s eyebrows raised at that and he snarked back \u201cNot as fun as toying with you.\u201dXiao Yao refused to concede defeat \u201cThe days ahead are long, between the two of us, who toys with whom, who torments whom, who is mean to whom, that is still unclear so you watch it!\u201dFang Feng Bei grinned \u201cNot bad, being a Princess definitely gave you some guts.\u201dXiao Yao stopped and looked around, this maze really was amazing, no wonder it could trap Feng Long and Xing Yue for an entire day.Xiao Yao looked at Fang Feng Bei \u201cHow to get out?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cThis maze has many interesting areas, you don\u2019t want to go check it out?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dFang Feng Bei led Xiao Yao to the exit \u201cDon\u2019t regret it in the future.\u201dXiao Yao coldly huffed.__________________________Outside the maze lots of people were drinking and making merry.Following the curving stream, some sat under the trees, other on rocks, some leaned against the railing, others were in conversation\u2026..Maids placed drinks on a platter to flow downstream and people would grab it when it stopped and required to entertain. The zither was playing, poems were recited, and even magic tricks were being performed for entertainment.Xiao Yao observed and laughed \u201cThat Xing Yue sure knows how to throw a party.\u201dThe music stopped and the platter floated to where Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei were standing.Xiao Yao shrunk behind Fang Feng Bei and whispered \u201cOther than making poisons I don\u2019t know how to do anything else.\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled, picked up the wine and downed it, then lazily bowed to everyone \u201cI\u2019ll do some magic!\u201dFang Feng Bei pointed to Xiao Yao \u201cGo stand over there.\u201dWith everyone\u2019s eyes on her, Xiao Yao stiffly walked over.Fang Feng Bei picked a white flower and waved the flower dew on Xiao Yao who made an annoyed face at him and whispered \u201cIf you dare toy with me, I\u2019ll get you back for this!\u201dThe moment she said that, the white flower dew spread like a dye on her robe and turned it from a yellow robe into a white one.A girl laughed \u201cAnother color?\u201dFang Feng Bei asked \u201cWhat color?\u201dThe girl picked a purple flower and sent it to Fang Feng Bei who ripped the petals and tossed the dew on Xiao Yao\u2019s robe. The purple flower dew turned into a dye and gradually spread over the robe and turning it into a purple color.Everyone was amused especially the girls who loved to be pretty so by now Xing Yue, Zhuan Xu, Feng Long, Jing, Hou, and Yi Yang were all standing by the river and clapping along.Fang Feng Bei used a green flower to transform Xiao Yao\u2019s robe into a green one. He could see Xiao Yao\u2019s hand was clenched into a fist with her impatience so he turned to the audience with a smile \u201cThat\u2019s it for today.\u201dFeng Long tossed a red flower over to Bei \u201cMake one more, a red one!\u201d All the outfits were beautiful on Xiao Yao but perhaps his first time seeing her was so impactful as she wore the red ceremonial dress but she didn\u2019t seem to like red and never wore that color again after the ceremony.Fang Feng Bei smiled \u201cThe birthday boy\u2019s request\u201d and made one more outfit as he splashed the red flower dew on Xiao Yao and her robe gradually changed into red.Xiao Yao\u2019s patience was at its end and she didn\u2019t have any hint of a smile but forced herself to take a bow so she opened her arms and twirled once in a circle before curtsying to Feng Long, indicating the game was ended. She turned to leave.A sharp loud scream cut through the air and a young girl had her hands clapped over her mouth as she stared with her face stark white at Xiao Yao. A young man sitting under the tree slowly stood up and glared balefully at Xiao Yao.Back then, they were both so small, but that nightmare scenario they would never forget. That devil who destroyed their entire tribe also wore a red robe, and he also had eyes that didn\u2019t seem to care about anything or anyone. Faced with the pleading of their fathers and brothers, he only coldly looked towards the distance.Xiao Yao glanced at the girl who screamed and the girl lowered her head to avoid Xiao Yao\u2019s stare but her body was shaking uncontrollably but it wasn\u2019t visible since she was behind a flower stalk.Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei returned to the guest rest chambers and Feng Long and Zhuan Xu walked in behind them.Xing Yue and Yi Yang sidled up to Fang Feng Bei wheedled \u201cDear second brother, teach us your trick!\u201dFang Feng Bei laughed and pointed to Xiao Yao \u201cIt\u2019s temporary so of no use to learn.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s red robe was gradually fading in color to reveal the original yellow robe. Xing Yue and Yi Yang sighed, it really was useless to learn this trick.A maid brought in some snacks and Xiao Yao was hungry so grabbed some. Feng Long and Zhuan Xu sat down to play chess. Xing Yue stood beside Feng Long while Xiao Yao walked over to stand behind Zhuan Xu and watch while munching on snacks.Yi Yang came over to watch as well and sat down next o Xing Yue. Jing limped over to sit next to Yi Yang and was next to Xiao Yao.Yi Yang glanced at Jing and her eyes flashed complete and utterly loathing, disappearing in a split second. No one noticed other than Xiao Yao, and in that second she felt worse than if she was the one being despised.Yi Yang appeared to be repulsed by even sitting next to Jing so she stood up and went to grab wine. She leaned on the pallet and started chatting with Fang Feng Bei and Hou.Xiao Yao handed her plate of snacks to Jing and said with a smile \u201cIt\u2019s very delicious.\u201dJing didn\u2019t know why Xiao Yao was suddenly so nice to him but he was genuinely happy and accepted it with a smile.Xiao Yao suddenly felt very uncomfortable like a poisonous snake was staring at her. She lifted her head and saw a young man staring at her. The moment he noticed her looking, he smiled and nodded his head before walking away.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWho was that just staring at me?\u201dA young man staring at a beautiful young woman was nothing strange so everyone laughed and Xing Yue said \u201cThat is one of my Mu family cousins. The Mu family was once a very prominent family but due to a dispute with Qi Yo, he destroyed the entire tribe and the only one to survive was him.\u201dFeng Long added \u201cThe entire families Qi Yo wiped out wasn\u2019t just the Mu family, plenty of families in the Middle Plains hate Qi Yo. Even though Qi Yo was a Great General of the Sheng Nong Kingdom, his death was celebrated by almost every tribe in the Middle Plains.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cNo wonder so many hate him, Qi Yo that big devil killed too many people!\u201dFang Feng Bei suddenly interrupted \u201cThe entire world can curse and hate Qi Yo, but no member of the Sheng Nong family can ever berate him.\u201dXing Yue was very unhappy to be chastised and glared at Bei who just leaned back lazily on the pallet and calmly said \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, go ask your dad.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a big deal but Xing Yue was angry because she felt like she was embarra.s.sed in front of Zhuan Xu so she picked a fight \u201cMiss Fang Feng, you ought to manage your brother better, he needs to watch his place before speaking out of turn.\u201dYi Yang was furious Xing Yue was looking down on the Fang Feng family so even if the smile was plastered on her face she nailed one back \u201cI\u2019ve been living in Qing Qiu for the last ten years and helping my grandmother, who has time to deal with the Fang Feng family affairs. If you care so much, you deal with it!\u201dXing Yue was so angry she snit back \u201cYou haven\u2019t even married into the family yet, stop talking like you are already the wife of the Tu Shan clan leader. Even if you\u2026..\u201d\u201cXing Yue!\u201d Jing softly but firmly cut her off.Xiao Yao quickly handed snacks to Xing Yue \u201cThis is so sweet, try it.\u201dXing Yue was still p.i.s.sed so didn\u2019t accept it.Zhuan Xu said to her \u201cTry it and if it\u2019s good then get me and Feng Long some.\u201d Xing Yue\u2019s p.i.s.sy face went away and she took the snacks before heading out with the maids to get more.Feng Long stood up and bowed to Yi Yang in apology \u201cPlease don\u2019t take it seriously, Xing Yue has been spoiled by our mother.\u201dYi Yang was so p.i.s.sed, there wasn\u2019t anything she was not as good as Xing Yue at. But because Xing Yue\u2019s last name as Sheng Nong, she had to constantly endure her. Even Feng Long\u2019s apology wasn\u2019t meant for her, it was really meant for Jing. What was so good about Tu Shan Jing? He was just a weak cripple! Other than he was the future clan leader so everyone respected him. It all came down to position!Yi Yang softly murmured \u201cIt\u2019s not Xing Yue\u2019s fault, I was out of line.\u201dFeng Long could see Yi Yang was still angry so he bowed again.He was the future Chi Sui clan leader and he was already doing so much so Yi Yang stood up and bowed back \u201cShe and I are like sisters, so it\u2019s just some words and that\u2019s normal. Even if I\u2019m petty this isn\u2019t anything to keep in mind.\u201dWhen Xing Yue returned with more snacks, she and Yi Yang were back talking like nothing had happened.Feng Long and Zhuan Xu\u2019s chess match went on until dinnertime.Zhuan Xu pulled Xiao Yao aside to whisper \u201cI need to discuss something with Feng Long in a bit so you stay with Xing Yue and don\u2019t run around. When I\u2019m done I\u2019ll send someone to get you.\u201dXiao Yao nodded and stuck by Xing Yue\u2019s side. When they were done with dinner, Zhuan Xu was finished with his business. Xing Yue walked them out to the cloud carriage and bid them farewell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen I read Tong Hua\u2018s other novels, it was easy to have favorite chapters and even favorite volumes, but that didn\u2019t happen with Lost You Forever. There is always something to savor in each chapter, each with a crescendo and a comfortable lull that is pivotal to building the narrative. That probably also comes with loving all the leads so that it doesn\u2019t matter who is getting a scene, it\u2019s forever interesting and adds to the richness of this magical world. Now that we know Fang Feng Bei is Xiang Liu in every way that counts, it\u2019s startling to go back to volume one of the novel and read his scenes with Xiao Yao and just gape at how cold impatient Xiang Liu from the early chapters could also be playful cheeky Bei. I think Xiao Yao has to know that he likes her no matter what he doesn\u2019t say, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being purposely dense. She does not want to deal with that implication, which is why their ocean scene in an earlier chapter where she told him that she doesn\u2019t want him walking into her dreams means so much. We can enjoy watching them hang out in all their chemistry-filled glory, but they are like two parallel paths that can\u2019t cross unless one person makes a ninety degree turn. Jing continues to be strategic and sweet, and I may find his scenes with Xiao Yao comparatively dull, but Jing as a character isn\u2019t dull in the least, he\u2019s just a slow burn that has all the ingredients to be the last one standing. Sometimes love has to be fought for and I love that he\u2019s gotten over his insecurity and understands Xiao Yao loves him for who he is and is willing to wait for him. While Xiang Liu is off fighting a losing battle and Zhuan Xu is off trying to win the keys to a kingdom, Jing is the only one who has only Xiao Yao he needs to weigh in his heart and mind.Chapter 19 \u2013 Standing Out in the Wind All Night:Xiao Yao\u2019s life seemed to return to normal like when she lived in Xuan Yuan Castle. In the morning she practiced archery, in the afternoon she made poisons, every day was packed to the gill.Every few days she would go find Fang Feng Bei to practice archery and afterwards head to the city of Zhi Yi and Zhe Province to play. Fang Feng Bei lived up to his reputation as a consummate ne\u2019er-do-well\u00a0playboy for the last four hundred years, he knew Zhi Yi and Zhe Province like the back of his hand. Whatever nook and cranny had something fun, he could find it, whatever was tasty, he would find it. The two of them were each other\u2019s companion as they enjoyed life\u2019s endless pleasures.Zhi Yi and Zhe Province were equally as far from Five G.o.ds Mountain and from Xuan Yuan Mountain, so whether it was the Grand Emperor of the Yellow Emperor, it was far enough to make their influence seem tenuous. Those who had seen Xiao Yao\u2019s true face was very few so once she put on the attire of the Middle Plains and lightened her complexion a little and used concealer to cover her peach blossom birthmark, she became an ordinary girl who was quite pretty enough.When she was with Fang Feng Bei, Xiao Yao often forgot her ident.i.ty and she would feel like she was still Wen Xiao Liu except wearing girl clothes.Xiao Yao knew Fang Feng Bei was Xiang Liu, but because this wasn\u2019t the battlefield and he wasn\u2019t being a cold and ruthless battle G.o.d, it was like he took off his armor and resumed living the ordinary life as well. He was a spare son who didn\u2019t have any ambition or influence, she was an ordinary G.o.ddess girl with very low power. No one ever paid them any attention.The two of them walked on the street and when they encountered a n.o.ble\u2019s carriage they would move to the side and let them pa.s.s; when they were berated, they would docilely lower their heads to apologize; when their clothes got dirty, they would wipe it with a cloth.Since Xiao Yao resumed being the Princess, she was never short for money. The first time she encountered Fang Feng Bei not having enough money and took out her money to pay, Fang Feng Bei\u2019s expression instantaneously turned deadly furious and Xiao Yao was so scared she immediately put her purse away. Fang Feng Fei stormed out without a word and returned in a bit with more money, likely he sold or p.a.w.ned something valuable on him.After he paid and they left the store, Fang Feng Bei very sternly said to Xiao Yao \u201cPaying is a man\u2019s job, you stop getting involved!\u201dSeeing his expression, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare giggle so she put on her best serious face and nodded. That night in Zhi Jin Court, the sound of Xiao Yao\u2019s laughter would ring out every so often as she laid on her pallet rolling around laughing so hard until her stomach hurt.From then on, Xiao Yao understood that it didn\u2019t matter if he had a lot of money or not enough money, they would simply spend whatever amount of money Bei on him. If he had money they would go to nice restaurants, if he didn\u2019t have much they would eat at a street stall.One time after lunch, Bei only had two coins on him and they had no choice but to take a twirl at a gambling den to earn enough money for the rest of their afternoon play. The gambling den proprietor saw Fang Feng Bei and instantly looked upset, it was likely not Fang Feng Bei\u2019s first time there to earn money. Thankfully when he had money he would gamble and lost a lot so he wasn\u2019t banned from there.Xiao Yao gradually understood what Xiang Liu meant \u2013 he wasn\u2019t pretending to be Fang Feng Bei. He was just being himself. To him, Fang Feng Bei was like having a job that gave him a lot of freedom and he didn\u2019t need to work everyday. When he did work for the Fang Feng family, they would give him money. If he didn\u2019t have enough money, he would work side jobs. As for what being Xiang Liu meant to him, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t dare ask.Jing would come visit Xiao Yao in Sheng Nong Mountain every three or four days.Sheng Nong Mountain was huge and there was too much to explore. Other than the maids and guards stationed at the Palace, many places had no one living there and was very quiet. Sometimes they would play in the water, other times they would go nowhere and stay in the hut in Cao Ao Summit.A lot of hibiscus trees grew around Zhi Jin Court and Xiao Yao often picked the leaves to use to wash Jing\u2019s hair.She soaked the hibiscus leaves in water to create a fragrant bubble which she ladled over Jing\u2019s hair. His hair was beautiful, thick and l.u.s.trous, smoother than silk, and Xiao Yao loved using her fingers to comb through it as she washed his hair.Perhaps it was due to her always taking care of Jing when they first met, but Xiao Yao was very used to taking care of Jing now. On time she remembered the first time she washed his hair and couldn\u2019t believe that the decimated near dead person was this man now.She wanted to take his robe off and check to see if the hideous scars were still on his body, but she didn\u2019t dare since she was not Wen Xiao Liu and he was not Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.Xiao Yao never concealed where she went and Jing knew she was spending a lot of time with Fang Feng Bei but he never said anything or asked anything.Actually deep down inside, Xiao Yao wanted him to ask. But he likely thought he had no right to stop her so he didn\u2019t ask. He never even mentioned that Fang Feng Bei looked just like Xiang Liu, not sure if he investigated and found nothing suspicious, or he didn\u2019t think it mattered.Since Jing didn\u2019t mention it, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t bring it up.Just like that, a year went by in her life.____________________________After four years of practicing archery, Xiao Yao\u2019s skills was moderately developed. The bow she was using wasn\u2019t suitable for her anymore. Fang Feng Bei took Xiao Yao to a weapons store owned by the Tu Shan clan to select a new bow.Xiao Yao knew a good weapon wasn\u2019t cheap and if she wanted the store to bring out the good ones to show them, she couldn\u2019t be dressed too shabby so she picked an outfit made of very expensive material,Fang Feng Bei asked the sales clerk to bring out all the weapons made by the famed weapons forging Jin Tian family. The sales clerk sized them up and figured they could afford it so led them to the back courtyard to try out the weapons.Xiao Yao picked up the bows and pulled it back to try, realizing each was different. A small red bow, Xiao Yao pulled but couldn\u2019t move the string and felt it wasn\u2019t suitable for her so put it aside.Fang Feng Bei picked it up and handed it back to her \u201cTry again.\u201dXiao Yao stood firm and pulled back the string again but it still wouldn\u2019t budge.Fang Feng Bei walked behind her and held her hand and gently guided it and Xiao Yao was able to pull back the string.Xiao Yao released the arrow and it hit the dummy right in the center of the chest.Xiao Yao happily said \u201cThis bow is it!\u201d\u201cSecond brother, Xiao Yao.\u201d Yi Yang\u2019s happy voice rang out.Xiao Yao turned around and saw Jing and Yi Yang walking in, and even if Jing knew Xiao Yao saw Fang Feng Bei often, this was the first them he saw them out together. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t think it was a big deal so smiled back. Jing glanced at Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei before quietly standing to the side.Yi Yang smiled as her eyes stared at Fang Feng Bei\u2019s hand resting on Xiao Yao\u2019s waist and the other on her bow hand \u201cWe also came to buy weapons and what a surprise running into you two here. Is second brother teaching Xiao Yao how to shoot?\u201dBei released Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and smiled very warmly. Xiao Yao knew what he was thinking because four years ago she had the thing misconception, that Bei was teaching her archery as a method to pick girls up.Yi Yang saw the red bow and picked it up and pulled back the string before praising \u201cDefinitely a Jin Tian family made weapon, worth a sky high price!\u201dXiao Yao suddenly remembered the arrow that pierced Zhuan Xu\u2019s chest and said with a smile \u201cI\u2019ve heard your skills are legendary. In my eyes, Bei is already incredible but he claims his skills cannot even compare to yours. Can you show me today?\u201dYi Yang stared at the test dummy in the distance and said nothing. Xiao Yao was about to change the subject when Yi Yang gave a small smile \u201cWhy not?\u201dShe picked up a bow and arrow and pulled back, and in that split second her entire aura changed. She stared at the test dummy and her eyes were filled with rage and barely tamped down disgust, like the test dummy was someone she hated with her entire being.Whoosh, the arrow left the bow and pierced the test dummy\u2019s throat clean to the other side. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t even see Yi Yang grab more arrows but she grabbed two more and released both which pierced the test dummy\u2019s two eyes. Yi Yang\u2019s form didn\u2019t even change and she smiled coldly as if she just let off some steam.A moment later her form relaxed and she became very sweet and docile \u201cSorry for the bit of showing off.\u201dXiao Yao felt a s.h.i.+ver go down her spine but forced a bright smile and clapped loudly, innocently saying to Bei \u201cYou have to teach me, I want to be as good as Yi Yang.\u201dYi Yang looked at Xiao Yao and a flicker of disgust floated past. Bei was leaning against a pole and lazily drawled \u201cYou will never be able to learn that skill.\u201dYi Yang laughed \u201cSecond brother, how can you not give your disciple some positive confidence? Please teach the Princess well!\u201dYi Yang was handed the two daggers she was here to buy and after inspecting it, the clerk packaged it up for her.The sales clerk of course didn\u2019t know Jing and Yi Yang\u2019s ident.i.ty but he still handed the package to Jing for him to pay. Yi Yang glanced at the weapons and suggested \u201cJing, please pay for the bow and arrow for my second brother!\u201dThat suggestion made Xiao Yao completely uncomfortable and Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know why but in that moment any man could pay for that bow and arrow for her except for Jing!Xiao Yao took the bow and arrow from the sales clerk and put it in Bei\u2019s hands and said with a smiling pout to Bei \u201cIf Master Jing were to pay for it, then wouldn\u2019t it become a gift from Master Jing to me?\u201dBei stared at Xiao Yao and his gaze was icy cold.Xiao Yao bit her lip and lowered her head, Xiang Liu was not just any man. She just made a huge huge mistake!Bei\u2019s gaze was still icy cold but he smiled and took out money and turned to Yi Yang and Jing \u201cI\u2019ll accept the thought but this bow and arrow is my present to Xiao Yao so I can\u2019t let you guys pay for it.\u201dYi Yang smiled and apologized to Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was too inconsiderate.\u201dBei said to Jing and Yi Yang \u201cYou two enjoy shopping, we have to leave now.\u201dXiao Yao followed behind Bei and quickly left the store.Bei tossed the bow and arrow at Xiao Yao and coldly said \u201cPay me back for it.\u201dXiao Yao took out money and gave him the exact amount he paid for it.There were two beggars on the side of the street and Bei took Xiao Yao\u2019s money and put it in front of them. Both beggars eyes opened wide to see so much money before them.Bei smiled \u201cFor you both\u201d before turning and striding off.Xiao Yao stared at the two beggars who were weeping tears of joy and hugging each other, and she completely understood what Xiang Liu meant by doing that.__________________________That night the little nine-tailed fox astral projection came to find Xiao Yao but she buried her head in her blanket and refused to acknowledge it.After a long time, Xiao Yao peeked out from under the blanket and the little white fox was still sitting on her pallet with its head c.o.c.ked quizzically staring at her, as if confused why Xiao Yao was playing hide-and-seek with it.Xiao Yao said \u201cGo away!\u201d but it blinked and didn\u2019t understand.Xiao Yao waved at it but it had no form so her hand pa.s.sed through its body. It still wagged its tail cutely and stared at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao took two pills and fell into a deep sleep.In the morning, Xiao Yao drowsily woke up and saw the little white fox still sitting on her pallet with its head on its paws staring at her.Xiao Yao moaned \u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201dBecause it was still here, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare leave her room and called Shan Hu in to help her.Shan Hu saw the little white fox and tried to hug it but her hands pa.s.sed through its body. She exclaimed \u201cWhat kind of magic is this to conjure up such a cute little nine-tailed fox.\u201dXiao Yao woke up, had breakfast, and the little white fox followed her.The entire day, no matter what Xiao Yao did, the little white fox followed her. He stuck to Xiao Yao to the point that she literally couldn\u2019t even muster up the energy to be angry anymore.That night Xiao Yao sat face-to-face with the little white fox.Xiao Yao had her head in her hands deep in worry, the little white fox stayed all day and all night. Jing that idiot couldn\u2019t have been waiting in Cao Ao Summit this entire time, could he? Xiao Yao was in a pique and thought \u2013 if I never show up, can you really wait forever? There is no one who can wait an entire lifetime in this world!The little white nine-tailed fox rested his head on his little clawed paws and stared at Xiao Yao with his black bright eyes, as if he was also very mopey.Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice shouted \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dShan Hu answered \u201cThe Princess is in her room.\u201dThe little white fox appeared to know it couldn\u2019t afford to upset Zhuan Xu, so with one last pathetic look at Xiao Yao, it swished its tails and vanished into thin air.Zhuan Xu rushed in and Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cToday Jing and Yi Yang attended a friend\u2019s banquet and as they were leaving he was attacked.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart leapt \u201cHe\u2026.he\u2026.how is he?\u201dZhuan Xu braced Xiao Yao \u201cThe injuries are likely severe. The news I received said that a spear with two different poisons on it pierced his vital organ. Tu Shan clan has sealed all avenues of information so it\u2019s not clear if he\u2019s dead or alive. I asked Feng Long to look into it\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao pushed Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand away and stumbled and ran outside. Zhuan Xu anxiously called \u201cXiao Yao, where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to look for Jing.\u201dZhuan Xu stopped her \u201cEven if you get to Qing Qiu, you won\u2019t be able to see him. Why not wait for Feng Long\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cI\u2019m not going to Qing Qiu, I\u2019m going to within Sheng Nong Mountain to look for Jing.\u201dZhuan Xu saw Xiao Yao\u2019s anxiety so summoned his winged ride \u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201dThey flew towards Cao Ao Summit and Jing was standing in the doorway shrouded by fog, not moving at all as if he was a pole.Xiao Yao let out a sigh of relief, half happy and half angry as she yelled \u201cHe\u2019s such an idiot!\u201dZhuan Xu quizzically asked \u201cIs that Jing?\u201dBefore the winged ride landed Xiao Yao already jumped off. Jing saw her and regained a semblance of life, smiling at her \u201cYou came!\u201dStanding in the mountain fog for so long, Jing\u2019s robe was all damp and he had dew on his face. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or rage and hit him a few times \u201cYou idiot, you scared me to death!\u201dZhuan Xu remembered the fox tail doll subst.i.tute that Jing made for him and understood what happened. He asked \u201cYou\u2019ve been in Sheng Nong Mountain this whole time? The Jing on the outside is your subst.i.tute?\u201dJing answered \u201cSince entering the mountain yesterday afternoon, I\u2019ve not left. Today I was supposed to attend a family friend gathering but since I didn\u2019t see Xiao Yao, I sent the subst.i.tute in my place.\u201dZhuan Xu couldn\u2019t figure out what he was feeling. Jing being alive had one hundred benefits for him and not a single detriment, but when he heard Jing was attacked, even though he was upset about it, hearing what Jing just said, he also couldn\u2019t feel happy either. Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cAs long as you\u2019re safe. Hurry back then! Your subst.i.tute is gravely injured and all of Qing Qiu is a mess.\u201dXiao Yao pleaded \u201cGege, I want to be alone with Jing for a bit, just a little bit.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and vaulted on the winged ride \u201cI\u2019ll head back and Xiao Xiao will come pick you up in a bit.\u201dXiao Yao watched Zhuan Xu leave before turning to Jing. He suddenly grabbed her in a tight embrace and his damp body immediately soaked her through. She hugged him back and lightly held onto him as if to give him warmth.After a huge scare, Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t in the mood to be angry at him anymore \u201cI didn\u2019t come see you not because I had someone else in my heart, but because I was unhappy. You said you would end the engagement, so what was that in the weapons store?\u201d\u201cA friend invited Yi Yang and I to visit and that friend collects daggers so I went to buy a present and ran into Yi Yang on the street and she insisted on coming with me.\u201d\u201cDid you bring up ending the engagement with Yi Yang?\u201dJing answered \u201cYi Yang was becoming colder and colder to me and I wanted to find time to discuss with her about ending it, but after Feng Long\u2019s birthday, she suddenly changed her att.i.tude and was so solicitous of me. She even mentioned to my grandmother how she was often looked down upon as if hinting she wants to get married sooner. Grandmother always felt like she didn\u2019t do enough for Yi Yang who suffered a lot, so she came to plead with me to give Yi Yang a t.i.tle. Even if I like another girl, I can just marry another concubine.\u201dXiao Yao pushed him \u201cDream on!\u201dJing grabbed her quickly \u201cI didn\u2019t say yes! I couldn\u2019t convince my grandmother so I went to talk to Yi Yang about her ending the engagement. I told her I liked someone else and wanted to cancel our engagement, I was willing to give her whatever compensation she wanted. But Yi Yang said she didn\u2019t care how many women I married as long as she was my first wife.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cCan\u2019t imagine she\u2019s so magnanimous! I think you should marry her and then later you marry your own harem and live in bliss!\u201dJing said painfully \u201cXiao Yao, stop mocking me! Can\u2019t you understand? Because she could care less about me, that is why she doesn\u2019t care. All she wants is the t.i.tle of the wife of the Tu Shan clan leader!\u201dXiao Yao stopped smiling and asked \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cYi Yang knew I wanted to end the engagement and went to cry in front of my grandmother. She reminded her that years ago her dad wanted to end the engagement and she put on her wedding dress and came to Qing Qiu. She never thought about leaving after that. If I want to kick her out, then she\u2019ll kill herself because she wasn\u2019t good enough for me. She said she was willing to serve the same husband with other women and be filial to grandmother\u2026.. Now grandmother thinks I\u2019m the one being unreasonable and refuses to end the engagement. Yi Yang comes off as understanding and open-minded so grandmother is completely on her side.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cSo you guys are stuck at an impa.s.se?\u201dJing nodded his head \u201cI can\u2019t end the engagement, they can\u2019t force me to marry Yi Yang.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u2013 just like Zhuan Xu said, it would be very difficult for Jing to end the engagement.Xiao Xiao whooshed past on her winged ring as if to remind Xiao Yao it was time to go back. Xiao Yao said \u201cI promised you fifteen years. As long as you don\u2019t marry, I\u2019ll keep that promise. Don\u2019t worry about Yi Yang for now. Gege said there was over a dozen a.s.sa.s.sins. Who do you think was behind it? Hou?\u201d\u201cTo a.s.sa.s.sinate me in Qing Qiu, it could only be him. But\u2026.\u201d Jing furrowed his brow \u201cMy brother isn\u2019t someone who is that rash. Why the sudden rash gesture? Since I returned he has been very careful around me, and the few tries he\u2019s made have been very low key so no one can trace it back to him. Today something must have triggered him to go all out and try and kill me. Or maybe it\u2019s not him?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWho cares if it\u2019s him, just know that someone dared to a.s.sa.s.sinate you in broad daylight in Qing Qiu. Think about how to protect yourself! I used all that energy to save you years ago, it was not to let you go die now!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I may not want to kill my brother, but I won\u2019t let him harm me. He did so much this time I can use this chance to eliminate all his cohorts within the clan, which can also help Zhuan Xu so that people within my clan don\u2019t cause problems for him.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cJust be careful.\u201dJing replied \u201cI know.\u201dXiao Xiao flew over again and Xiao Yao said \u201cI need to go, if I don\u2019t go back, Zhuan Xu will be angry.\u201dXiao Yao waved Xiao Xiao down and vaulted on the winged ride.Jing watched her completely disappear form sight before longingly leaving._______________________________The next day, Xiao Yao learned from Zhuan Xu that this a.s.sa.s.sination was planned in detail and arrived in force. If Jing hadn\u2019t used the subst.i.tute by coincidence, he might not have survived it.A few days later, news broke that Tu Shan Jing would survive but there was no word on who was behind the a.s.sa.s.sination so this matter remained an unsolved mystery.In private when Jing and Hou were alone, Hou arrogantly admitted he sent people to kill Jing and told Jing to get him back.Jing didn\u2019t have the heart to get rid of Hou but started clipping his wings.During the investigation into the a.s.sa.s.sins, the shop owners of many Tu Shan clan businesses started getting replaced and this went on for three months before it ended.The Tu Shan clan businesses extended through the vast wilderness and across all industries. Hou supported Cang Lin and Yu Yang so ever since Zhuan Xu arrived in the Middle Plains, the Tu Shan clan businesses kept tabs on Zhuan Xu and would try to undermine him.This time Jing rearranged the clan businesses, it also took some pressure off Feng Long and Zhuan Xu.Feng Long snuck into Sheng Nong Mountain and chuckled to Zhuan Xu \u201cJing\u2019s a.s.sa.s.sination attempt was for the best! Hou doesn\u2019t seem like such a moron but how did he do something so brainless this time? Totally out of character, like an angry woman at her wit\u2019s end.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cYou now say it was for the best, but when Jing was a.s.sa.s.sinated you said something else. An a.s.sa.s.sination if succeeded is a very powerful and deadly attack. Hou would have gotten rid of Jing and taken over the Tu Shan clan just like that.\u201dXiao Yao listened to the conversation and suddenly flashed back to that day in the weapons shop and how Fang Feng Yi Yang pulled the bow back to shoot the test dummy. But upon closer a.n.a.lysis, if Jing died and Hou was the clan leader, Yi Yang would marry Jing\u2019s plaque and live a life alone as the wife of the former leader. Only if Jing was alive would she get whatever she wanted.Xiao Yao shook her head. It couldn\u2019t be Yi Yang!Xiao Yao berated herself to not think badly of Yi Yang just because of Jing. Yi Yang may not love Jing but she was engaged to him and wouldn\u2019t resort to killing him._______________________Zhi Jin Peak, a bright and glorious morning.Xiao Yao was tending to the fire pit and her face was bright red with sweat dotting her forehead.She felt the time was right and put on her gloves before opening the cover of the pot to take out the mold. She put it inside a pail of ice water until the mold solidified. Xiao Yao poured the mold out and individual mold pieces tumbled on the table, some pink, others green, and even yellow.Zhuan Xu walked into this \u201cmedicine making room\u201d and saw Xiao Yao intent on her work. He said nothing and stood in the corner to watch quietly. There were colorful molds strewn all over the table but the shapes were odd. Some looked like flower petals, others like leaves, he really couldn\u2019t figure out what she was making.Xiao Yao took out a rectangular gla.s.s plate, it was dark on both ends and white in the middle like the backdrop of an ink portrait without nothing on it.Xiao Yao used a brush and covered the white part once with a liquid.Xiao Yao washed her hands and then put it in the ice water for some time before wiping it with a clean cloth. She then picked up the molds from earlier and used a small paring knife to start carving the molds. She finished one and would put it on the plate as if she was painting on it.Zhuan Xu was curious so walked over and he saw Xiao Yao\u2019s slender fingers expertly at work and gradually the white plate was covered with a green lily frond and there was dew on it that appeared like it was about to slide off. A pink lily appeared and the yellow nectar inside formed. Within the lilies two salmon peeked out from under the water shyly.The entire morning pa.s.sed and an entire salmon frolicking in a lily pond tableau was created. Other than having no sound, everything was there even the scent of the lilies.Xiao Yao stared at it intently and then smiled in satisfaction.Zhuan Xu clapped \u201cScent, visuals, and taste \u2013 it\u2019s all there. Makes me want to take a bite.\u201dXiao Yao made a face at him \u201cIt\u2019s all poison.\u201dZhuan Xu shook his head \u201cCan\u2019t figure out what this weird hobby of yours is. Who makes poisons into a delicacy. Your poison making room is pretty much a kitchen.\u201dXiao Yao carefully picked up the plate and put it inside a box before shutting it and wrapping it up in a cloth.Zhuan Xu asked warily \u201cYou can\u2019t be giving that to someone?\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cSecret.\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cI can\u2019t decide if you like this person, or hate this person.\u201dAfter a morning of sitting Xiao Yao\u2019s back ached and she rubbed her back and asked \u201cHow come you have time to come watch me make poisons?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI have something to discuss with you.\u201dXiao Yao got serious \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cFeng Long invited you out a couple of times and you turned him down every time?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes twirled and she asked \u201cYou want me to say yes?\u201dZhaun Xu nodded. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand \u201cIsn\u2019t there Xing Yue? If you want to announce a marriage alliance, it\u2019s enough for you to marry Xing Yue!\u201d\u201cXing Yue is Xing Yue, her last name is Sheng Nong. Feng Long is Feng Long, his last name is Chi Sui and he\u2019s the next Chi Sui clan leader. You are you, carrying the bloodlines of the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Emperor.\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her brows \u201cYou can\u2019t be wanting me to marry Feng Long?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Feng Long?\u201d Zhuan Xu was confused now \u2013 Tu Shan Jing was engaged, Fang Feng Bei was a profligate spare son, compared to both guys Feng Long was so much better. He was powerful and talented with a great family background. Yet Xiao Yas would rather spend all her time with Fang Feng Bei wandering the desolate mountainside looking at wild flowers instead of going with Feng Long to regal Sheng Nong mountain to view the famed peonies.Xiao Yao chuckled \u201cIf I tell you the truth, you promise not to throttle me?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be good, but fine, I promise not to throttle you.\u201dXiao Yao giggled \u201cThere is nothing wrong with Feng Long, other than he reminds me of you. He\u2019s too calculating about everything. If he wants to meet me, it\u2019s not because he thinks I\u2019m all that wonderful, its merely that he\u2019s weighed all the girls around him and decided I\u2019m the most suited to be his wife.\u201dZhaun Xu was exasperated and pretend to deck her. \u201cBecause he\u2019s like me, so you don\u2019t want him?\u201dXiao Yao ducked \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t beat me.\u201dZhuan Xu still bopped her on the head \u201cIn his position, he is not allowed to not be calculating. Even if he measures and weighs everything, it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have sincere feelings as well.\u201dXiao Yao pouted \u201cAre you seriously trying to help him? Are you my brother or his brother?\u201dZhaun Xu sighed \u201cOf course I\u2019m your Gege, and if you really don\u2019t like him then I won\u2019t push. Plus I can\u2019t push even if I wanted to. But for my sake at least try to give the guy a bit of face. Xing Yue has already asked me to help many times, and Feng Long is pretty prideful and can\u2019t ask me directly but indicated enough he wants my help.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and asked \u201cDo you need Feng Long\u2019s help in the Middle Plains?\u201dZhuan Xu nodded and then pulled Xiao Yao into his arms in a tight embrace before leaning down and whispering in her ear \u201cI\u2019m secretly a.s.sembling an army.\u201dXiao Yao sucked in her breath and almost forgot to breathe.There was a lot of money needed to renovate the Palace and Tu Shan clan supplying the material can offer different prices to skim off the top, so Zhuan Xu had the funds to build an army. The workers coming and going allowed the soldiers to sneak in as well. Sheng Nong Mountain was thousands of miles vast with so many places to create a spiritual barrier maze to hide a secret army. In the Middle Plains, he could quietly without detection build an army, and with Zhuan Xu\u2019s personality, this allowed him to not wholly rely on Feng Long here.This would be the ideal path, but if their grandfather found out\u2026..it would be the death penalty!Xiao Yao stared at Zhuan Xu but he just smiled with complete conviction in his eyes.Zhuan Xu explained \u201cThe Four Great Clans have survived tens of thousands of years by keeping their bloodlines flowing with one main principle \u2013 do not get involved in any political battles. That suits someone like Jing, but it hampers someone with ambition like Feng Long. He is already sick and tired of his clan elders nagging. I need Feng Long, but he also needs me. With a sage ruler, but without a wise official, no great deeds can be accomplished; without a sage ruler, even the wisest official can have no future. Only when a sage ruler pairs with a wise official can an empire be built that will last for generations.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ll treat Feng Long as a friend, meet him, chat, even go play. I can do all that, but I will never marry him.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough. What happens in the future no one will know so let\u2019s just wait and see!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI\u2019ll go find him in the next few days.\u201dZhuan Xu softly coughed \u201cXing Yue invited you to go stay at the Little Zhu Rong residence for a bit.\u201dWhether it was Feng Long\u2019s desire, or Xing Yue\u2019s own plans, but when it came to matchmaking her brother and Xiao Yao, she was going all out.Xiao Yao asked \u201cZhuan Xu, will you marry Xing Yue?\u201dZhuan Xu thought about it and said \u201cDepends on her! If she wants, I\u2019ll marry her. She is the descendant of the Sheng Nong royal family, marrying her gives legitimacy to me with the people of the Middle Plains. To rule the world, one needs to use force and to use persuasion. Force is to subdue everything with might, persuasion might seem unnecessary but is actually a must as well.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cSince my future sister-in-law is inviting me, then I\u2019ll go and start getting on good terms with her.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao and his eyes showed his conflicted emotions.Xiao Yao asked \u201cDid I say anything wrong?\u201dZhuan Xu lowered his eyes and said with a laugh \u201cIf I knew you would use this reason to agree, I wouldn\u2019t have wasted my time trying to convince you and even told you all my secret plans.\u201d\u201cToo late to regret it! I\u2019m going out for a bit so tell Shan Hu to pack my belongings and I\u2019ll go to Xing Yue\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d Xiao Yao pushed Zhuan Xu out the door \u201cThis \u2018kitchen\u2019 of mine is full of poison so when I\u2019m not here don\u2019t go in.\u201d______________________________A dance hall, a dancer was gracefully dancing.Xiao Yao smiled and placed a white wrapped box in front of Fang Feng Bei.Bei glanced over it and drawled \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou open it.\u201dBei shook his cup \u201cI\u2019m drinking right now.\u201dXiao Yao clenched her fist \u2013 be patient, be patient, be patient! She released her fist and opened the cloth cover over the box.Bei was still uninterested and continued drinking his wine and watching the dancer dancing.Xiao Yao had no choice but to open the box herself. When she made it, to create the scent of the lilies she spent a lot of time on it. Right now the scent of the lilies were lost in the pungent odor of the food and the perfumes around them so it wasn\u2019t noticeable anymore.Xiao Yao rushed here excitedly with a whole bellyful of things she wanted to say to him. She wanted to boast about how she made the poison lilies, how she made the leaf covers, but now the entire salmon frolicking in lilies tableau turned dim and she didn\u2019t feel like saying anything anymore. She picked up her wine and started drinking and pouting.Bei finally turned his gaze from the dancer to the table and checked out the tableau on the gla.s.s plate. It was delicate and full of life, the colors vibrant and the items exquisitely rendered.Bei stared for some time before picking up a chopstick and eating a lily frond.One bite after another, one lily frond, one salmon, one lily\u2026..slowly he ate the entire salmon frolicking in lilies tableau.Xiao Yao gaped at him \u201cYou\u2026.don\u2019t stuff yourself silly.\u201dBei shot her a look and she immediately shut up.Bei ate the final bite and put down his chopstick. He took a sip of wine and casually said \u201cNot bad.\u201dXiao Yao stared at the empty plate and her heart soared \u201cThe only person who can make poisons this tasty in the entire world is me!\u201dBei laughed back \u201cAnd the only person in the entire world who can appreciate your great \u201ccooking\u201d talents is me!\u201dXiao Yao sa.s.sed back \u201cIt\u2019s enough to have a true soulmate.\u201dBei gave her a half-smile but said nothing.Xiao Yao asked \u201cCan you continue teaching me archery now?\u201d What she really meant to ask was \u2013 are you not angry at me anymore?Bei finished his wine \u201cI need to leave for a bit, wait for me to come back.\u201dXiao Yao figured he was going back to Qing Shui town. Even if there was no active warfare, he was still the General of the Sheng Nong resistance army and there was much he had to do.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help it and sighed loudly and murmured \u201cIf only you can forever be Fang Feng Bei, that would be so great!\u201dBei appeared not to have heard her as he set down his wine cup and got up to leave, his form disappearing in the layers of curtains.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter of Lost You Forever\u00a0is delicious\u00a0because it\u2019s lifted straight from a romance novel\u2019s heart thumping goodness, i.e. there\u2019s making out straight ahead. It\u2019s also a Jing-centric chapter and one that is much needed ever since Xiang Liu debuted his Fang Feng Bei alter ego and waltzed into Xiao Yao\u2019s life and sorta parked himself in her heart in a different capacity than Jing. She still has her fifteen year promise with Jing so I\u2019m not expecting her to waver for either Xiang Liu or any other man, and honestly if she weren\u2019t so burnt by familial betrayal I would think she would be willing to wait for Jing forever. He\u2019s so into her and the poor guy is pretty much counting the seconds until he can get rid of that Fang Feng Yi Yang engagement for good. I don\u2019t mind him being engaged, it\u2019s a burden he has to bear much like his scars, and Xiao Yao\u2019s giving him a legit chance to take care of it. If he can\u2019t get rid of Yi Yang either by methods upstanding (a broken engagement) and dastardly (taking her out), then he can\u2019t be with Xiao Yao no matter how long she is willing to wait. Our girl is a Princess and a concubine is not in her cards, nor is it in her nature. She\u2019s a one-man kind of woman, which I totally respect about her, but for the fact that I want to tell her that she already loves three guys in three ways even if she doesn\u2019t quite realize it. I also love this more chapter more upon rereading for the translation because what\u2019s coming in upcoming chapters is pretty much all h.e.l.l breaks loose action packed. It\u2019s nice to have a bit of breather, and this one is lyrical and lovely, romantic and stirring. It elevates Xiao Yao and Jing\u2019s romance from the more chaste sedate variety to a decidedly pa.s.sionate one.Chapter 20 \u2013 The Time is Quiet Spending it With You:At dawn the next day, Xiao Yao moved into Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence.Xiao Yao initially wanted to bring only Shan Hu as her maid but Zhuan Xu gave her another maid called Miao Pu. Xiao Yao guessed she was a trained guard so accepted her without fuss quietly.Xing Yue knew Xiao Yao\u2019s personality was rather odd and Zhuan Xu reminded her carefully not to restrict Xiao Yao so Xing Yue a.s.signed her to her own side courtyard. Other than Xiao Yao\u2019s two maids and the two cleaning ladies, there was no one else in that court.Xiao Yao was very pleased with Xing Yue\u2019s arrangement which relieved Xing Yue. The two maids were left to clean in the court and Xing Yue took Xiao Yao to tour the residence and familiarize her with the estate.That night Xiao Yao finally met the world renowned Little Zhu Rong who was a tall strongly built handsome man. Likely due to his daily administrative burdens, even when he was mellowly chatting with Xiao Yao there was still exhaustion visible in his tightly furrowed brows.Little Zhu Rong chatted with Xiao Yao for a bit and asked Xing Yue to take good care of her before leaving.Xing Yue let out a soft sigh \u201cWas that a bit boring? Don\u2019t worry about my dad, he\u2019s so busy that I see him only every few days, and when he has matters elsewhere it\u2019s not unusual to not see him for a few months. This residence may be large but really I\u2019m the only one home every day.\u201dXing Yue grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cMy Gege is also super busy, and since your Gege arrived, he\u2019s been so busy I can\u2019t even catch a shadow. Sometimes I can\u2019t even find someone to talk with me. Now we at least have each other for company.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and nodded \u201cYes.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cEven though you\u2019re older than me, but I sometimes feel like I\u2019m the older sister since I fret about everything and you worry about nothing. Don\u2019t be shy with me and treat this place like your own home. Whatever you want or need, just tell me.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhat do you mean I worry about nothing, I\u2019ve already thought everything through.\u201d The truth is Xiao Yao wanted nothing which was why Xing Yue thought she didn\u2019t think about anything.Xiao Yao and Xing Yue had dinner and then chatted for awhile longer.Xing Yue was very gregarious so told Xiao Yao all about her childhood. Little Zhu Rong controlled the Middle Plains, her Gege was in Chi Sui, and she and her mom lived in Xuan Yuan Castle. She grew up in Xuan Yuan Castle so she had close ties with it and even played in Cao Yun Court before.Xiao Yao listened and realized that Xing Yue and her mom really were hostages back then. The Yellow Emperor didn\u2019t really trust Little Zhu Rong so even though he was given administration of the Middle Plains, the Yellow Emperor held onto his wife and daughter. Xing Yue must know that as well but she never mentioned it and simply shared all her happy memories of Xuan Yuan Castle. She laughed and Xiao Yao joined in.After Xing Yue left and Xiao Yao laid down on her pallet, she realized that Xing Yue was her first girlfriend. After pretending to be a man for a few hundred years she never had the chance to be so close with a girl, then when she resumed being a girl her ident.i.ty was so lofty other girls didn\u2019t dare get close, while Ah Nian was her sister but it was lucky if they weren\u2019t fighting so it wasn\u2019t likely they would have any girl talk like tonight.This kind of girl talk was different than when Xiao Yao talked to others and she quite liked it.After settling into Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence, Xiao Yao felt it not bad at all.Even though Xing Yue was younger than her, but Xing Yue was a girl for much longer than her. Xiao Yao lacked a woman\u2019s hand growing up so she followed Xing Yue around quite like Xing Yue was her older sister. Xing Yue taught Xiao Yao how to put on make up, discussed how to do her hair, helped paint her nails and told Xiao Yao that men liked to sneak a peak at a girl\u2019s nails so she had to keep it in good condition.Xiao Yao took out all the flower perfumes she bought in Xuan Yuan Castle and mixed it with herbs to create four unique scents for Xing Yue that she could use in each of the four seasons of Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Xing Yue was beyond ecstatic.Feng Long was very polite and stayed away from Xiao Yao when she first moved in and only until she got familiar with the residence did he sometimes come with Xing Yue to visit her. He was very well-mannered and Xiao Yao treated him as a friend so the three of them got along well and played together without any awkwardness.After moving in, she could still practice archery since people thought she was learning just for amus.e.m.e.nt, but she couldn\u2019t make poisons anymore and that made Xiao Yao feel listless. She could only read medicine books and make some medicinal pills which was better than doing nothing.One day Xiao Yao was mixing medicine when Xing Yue came to find her \u201cI have something to ask your opinion. Jing gege is coming to Zhi Yi and my brother learned with him when they were younger so they are very close. Even though Jing gege has his own residences in Zhi Yi, my brother will invite him to stay with us. I wanted to ask if you would mind?\u201dXiao Yao carefully said \u201cThis residence is so big, of course the more the merrier.\u201dXing Yue clapped \u201cI knew you\u2019d say this. I told my brother that you may seen very cold and aloof and hard to approach, but once you are comfortable with someone you are very easy to get along with.\u201dXing Yue added \u201cYou keep on working, I\u2019ll send word to my brother and start having Jing gege\u2019s residence here cleaned up. Once he arrives I\u2019ll come find you.\u201dXiao Yao looked at the herbs in her hand and suddenly forgot what she was thinking about just now.Xing Yue came at dusk \u201cJing gege is staying in the Evergreen Residence filled with evergreens that make the entire place smell fresh. We\u2019ll be dining there tonight to catch up and enjoy the foliage.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSure.\u201dXing Yue led Xiao Yao there and she asked \u201cDid Yi Yang come as well?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Xing Yue stopped and then looked around before saying \u201cIt\u2019s just us so I\u2019ll tell you but don\u2019t say this to anyone else.\u201dXiao Yao still didn\u2019t understand that when girls gossiped they had to set the stage first so she solemnly said \u201cUnderstood.\u201dXing Yue said in a low voice \u201cActually Jing gege is very pathetic because Yi Yang doesn\u2019t like him.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned \u201cHow do you know? Did she tell you?\u201d\u201cHow could Yi Yang say this to me? Jing gege\u2019s mom is from the Tan family and my grandmother is also from the Tan family \u2013 my grandmother was his mom\u2019s aunt. Jing gege\u2019s grandmother was from the Chi Sui clan and was the cousin of my grandfather. Jing gege and I are blood relatives. Yi Yang is nothing to us.\u201d Xing Yue\u2019s eyes flashed her disregard \u201cIf Yi Yang wasn\u2019t Jing gege\u2019s fiancee, I would never be so close with her.\u201d\u201cThen how do you know\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhen a girl likes a guy she will hide it deep down inside even making it seem like she doesn\u2019t like him. But when she really doesn\u2019t like a guy, no matter how hard she tries to mask it, it\u2019ll slip. One time Jing gege was walking over and he was limping and Yi Yang looked at him coldly\u2026\u2026her eyes were filled with disdain so much so that I was shaken to see it. The moment she realized I was looking at her, she warmly walked over to be so considerate towards him. Since then I would keep an eye on her and the more I observed the more I was convinced she didn\u2019t like him.\u201dXiao Yao thought only she noticed Yi Yang\u2019s disgust for Jing but even Xing Yue noticed. Yi Yang wasn\u2019t a careless person which went to show just how much she loathed Jing.Xing Yue said \u201cAnother thing that left a deep impression with me was one time we all went to play in the mountains. The guys all went hunting but Jing gege\u2019s leg is what it is so he didn\u2019t go. Yi Yang went with the other girls hunting. Xiao Yao, tell me, if your sweetheart couldn\u2019t go hunting because of his leg injury, what would you do?\u201dXiao Yao murmured \u201cI would stay with him.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cThat\u2019s right! So I think Jing gege is so sad. Later my brother brought back his kill but Yi Yang remained hunting in the mountains. My brother could see Jing gege was all alone and half joked half berated that Jing allowed his woman too much leeway. Even my brother who is pretty clueless about that stuff could see it. No matter how much a girl likes to have fun, if her heart is on a man, then her heart would want to keep him company.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cIf she dislikes him that much, why not end the engagement?\u201dXing Yue coldly scoffed \u201cEnd the engagement? She would never give it up! Yi Yang is very beautiful and capable, the top at everything. But no matter how talented she is, she is still the daughter of the Fang Feng family. The top six families in the Middle Plains wouldn\u2019t even glance at her or give her the time of day. When I was still small, she tried to cozy up to me and became my friend which is when the other powerful daughters reluctantly accepted her. Once people saw her close to us, their opinion of her rose. I don\u2019t even know how it happened that Jing gege\u2019s mom decided on her and engaged her to Jing gege. She immediately changed and was no longer as solicitous towards me. By that time I was grown up so I understood how things worked and accepted that. Since she was the next wife of the Tu Shan clan leader, I figured I needed to keep her in line with me.\u201dThey were almost at the Evergreen Residence and Xing Yue reminded Xiao Yao \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dXing Yue had the maids set up the dinner within the evergreen forest likely having done it before. There was an evergreen table setting placed in the center of the forest with a clear view of the forest and the moon.Jing and Feng Long were already there and each sat on their own table facing each other. Xing Yue walked over with Xiao Yao and since she knew Jing from childhood she sweetly called out \u201cJing gege.\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Feng Long before sitting down next to Jing\u2019s seat. Xing Yue couldn\u2019t ask Xiao Yao to get up so she sat down next to Feng Long.Xing Yue dismissed all the maids so as to not disturb them.Feng Long smiled at Xiao Yao and looked at the wine set out \u201cYou\u2019ve got a high tolerance so don\u2019t be shy tonight.\u201dXiao Yao was already chummy with him so laughed \u201cStop with the nonsense lest people think I\u2019m an alcoholic.\u201d But then she reached out and poured herself a cup.Xiao Yao toasted Feng Long and Xing Yue \u201cThank you both for the hospitality.\u201dThe three of them gulped their wine.Xiao Yao poured Jing a cup and said nothing other than raise her own cup and he drank with her.Feng Long toasted Xiao Yao back and she immediately gulped another cup.Xing Yue laughed \u201cXiao Yao, you might want to slow down.\u201dXiao Yao waved \u201cDon\u2019t worry, out drinking all three of you won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cDone, I\u2019ll wait and see if you can out drink all three of us combined.\u201dThe maid brought out a zither and Xing Yue said \u201cNormally I would never play my lacking talents in front of Jing gege, but it\u2019s boring to drink without any entertainment. I recently learned a new tune so I\u2019m sorry to showcase my meager skills here.\u201dXiao Yao teased \u201cToo bad Zhuan Xu isn\u2019t here and no one can harmonize on the flute with you.\u201dXing Yue blushed \u201cI thought you were cold and aloof when we weren\u2019t friends, now we\u2019re friends and you turned out to be such a tease.\u201dXiao Yao raised a cup \u201cI\u2019ll take a punishment for teasing little sister.\u201dXing Yue sat down in front of the zither and started playing.Xiao Yao toasted Feng Long three in a row, then toasted Jing three in a row and Feng Long joined in as well. Feng Long then toasted Xiao Yao another three cups in a row. After Xing Yue finished played, Xiao Yao smiled at Feng Long \u201cTonight you\u2019ll be the first one drunk.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cDrinking and making merry is no fun without getting drunk. You are a very open drinker so it\u2019s fun to drink with you!\u201dXiao Yao said to the maid \u201cBring the drinking bowls!\u201dFeng Long was so happy he tossed his cup \u201cGood!\u201dThe maid poured the bowls with wine and Feng Long and Xiao Yao each grabbed one and gulped it down before smiling.Xing Yue shook her head and said to Jing \u201cMy brother was always a lunatic before but with a new one joining him, it\u2019s sure gotten fun around here.\u201dFeng Long said to Xiao Yao \u201cAnother bowl?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Xiao Yao toasted another bowl with Feng Long.Feng Long walked to an open spot \u201cI\u2019ll make a lion dance for entertainment.\u201d He waved his hand and a water based lion appeared crouched on the ground as if ready to pounce. Feng Long said to Xing Yue \u201cLittle sister.\u201d Xing Yue waved her hand and conjured up a fireball and she tossed it to Feng Long. That was when Xiao Yao realized Xing Yue\u2019s power was fire-based while Feng Long had the rare ability of both water and fire.Feng Long started kicking the fireball up and down, left and right, and the water lion chased after it like a cat chasing a ball. The fire and water criss-crossed in the air creating a beautiful sight.Xing Yue would cheat and try to send the fireball into the lion\u2019s mouth but Feng Long would use his power to block it and make the lion keep working to catch it.Xiao Yao clapped in glee and grabbed another cup of wine when Jing stopped her and asked in a low voice \u201cAre you drinking because you\u2019re happy or because you\u2019re upset?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019m happy and upset.\u201d She was upset Yi Yang treated Jing that way, she was happy Yi Yang treated Jing that way.Jing stared at Xiao Yao in confusion.Xiao Yao grabbed Jing\u2019s hand in secret and she smiled brilliantly at him, her smile even more luminous than the light show behind her.Jing stared at her but Xiao Yao turned around and saw Feng Long drunkenly playing with the water lion while Xing Yue giggled and moved the fireball, neither of them looking at them. Xiaon Yao grabbed Jing\u2019s hand hard and pulled him forward while she pushed herself up slightly and quickly kissed him on the cheek.Xiao Yao felt so sweet and happy and nervous and she quickly looked back to see if Xing Yue noticed and released Jing to casually grab her wine cup. But she didn\u2019t realize that she pulled him hard and released him fast, plus Jing\u2019s mind was blank in that instant, so with a bang Jing landed backward on the pallet and all the wine tumbled down with him.Feng Long and Xing Yue rushed over and Xing Yue asked \u201cJing gege, are you alright?\u201dJing said up with his face beet red \u201cNo\u2026no problem. I zone out for a moment and got tangled up.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cI can still lion dance and you\u2019re already drunk.\u201d Feng Long said to Xiao Yao \u201cLooks like Jing is the first one drunk tonight.\u201dXing Yue didn\u2019t want Jing to feel embarra.s.sed so said to her brother \u201cDo you think everyone is like you. It was dim and not easy to see, it\u2019s no big deal to trip.\u201dJing sat with his head lowered looking a bit cloddish. Xiao Yao drank another cup of wine and smiled before standing up and twirling in a circle \u201cI\u2019ll sing a mountain ballad for you guys!\u201dBefore they could answer Xiao Yao start singing.Xiao Yao sang a song about a woman who was missing her beloved and longing for him and wanting only to be together for all of eternity.The final verse she sang three times: together forever, never apart.It was a clear night with few clouds, the moon bright and the stars dim. Within the evergreen forest, the flowers and trees were glittering and the fragrance wafted over them. Xiao Yao sang and danced as lithe as the willow and as light as the spring water. She moved along with the moon and when she sang the final verse three times, she put all her heart into it and her voice was as lingering as silk in the air.For a moment all three listening were in a daze.Xiao Yao sat back down and felt her face was burning hot and her heart was beating fast. Xiao Yao put her head in her hand and laughed \u201cMy head is so dizzy, this whole table is wobbly.\u201dXing Yue sighed \u201cIt really is like what Gege said, drinking is really more fun after getting drunk.\u201d She raised a cup \u201cXiao Yao, a toast to you.\u201dXiao Yao drunkenly picked up her cup and gulped down her wine.Xiao Yao had a high tolerance and even when she was drunk physically her mind remained clear. But today even her mind was addled. Xing Yue started step dancing and called Xiao Yao to join her.Xiao Yao stood up to go when her knees buckled and she pitched backward into Jing\u2019s arms. Xiao Yao smiled at Jing and there was laughter in his eyes. Xiao Yao wanted to reach out to touch his brows but her eyes closed and she fell asleep.______________________________The second day, it was almost noon by the time she got up.Xiao Yao rubbed her throbbing head and couldn\u2019t help but smile. No wonder men loved to drink, it was only after getting drunk that one could do whatever one wanted. Shan Hu handed honey water to Xiao Yao and she sipped it and felt better.Xiao Yao washed up as the maids brought her lunch.She asked Shan Hu and Miao Pu \u201cDid Xing Yue and them dine already?\u201dShan Hu laughed \u201cDined long ago. Master Feng Long and Master Jing left the residence early for work matters. Miss Xing Yue woke just a half hour later than her usual since she handles all the matters inside and out in this grand residence so she can\u2019t slack off.\u201dXiao Yao laughed sheepishly \u201cGuess I\u2019m the only one who has nothing to do.\u201dXiao Yao dined and then practiced archery for an hour before sitting down with her medical texts. After a bit she took a stroll in the garden and would stand by the flowers in a daze or leaning against the corridor thinking.That night Xing Yue called Xiao Yao to dine with her and she noticed neither Feng Long or Jing was there and casually asked \u201cDid Feng Long and Jing dine outside?\u201dXing Yue smiled \u201cMy brother is rarely home, it\u2019s because you\u2019re here that he sometimes comes home to have dinner lately. Jing gege has been back since this afternoon but we don\u2019t treat him like a guest and he comes and goes as he pleases. If my brother is here then they will dine together, otherwise Jing gege dines alone in his residence.\u201dXiao Yao ate and then asked \u201cI heard your zither playing is very good, why would you say you were making a fool of yourself playing in front of Jing?\u201dXing Yue sighed \u201cYou have never heard Jing gege play. Years ago the Young Master of Qing Qiu\u2019s one tune would enchant countless listeners! My mom found me two great masters but it really was due to Jing gege\u2019s pointers that I became an accomplished zither playing. But after his horrific ordeal, he said his fingers were injured so doesn\u2019t play anymore.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cEven if he can\u2019t play, he can still teach others.\u201dXing Yue asked \u201cYou want Jing gege to teach you to play?\u201d\u201cI do have that thought. You know that I got lost when I was still small so I never was taught the arts properly and there is much I don\u2019t know how to do. Sometimes it\u2019s quite awkward.\u201dXing Yue nodded her head in understanding. As the children of powerful families, it was very awkward not to have a skill or talent. People might not dare say it to Xiao Yao\u2019s face, but there would be a lot of criticism and mockery behind her back.Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to learn music but it\u2019s hard to find a good master. Zhuan Xu has no time for me but hearing you compliment Jing, I thought it a good idea especially since he\u2019s here for now.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea if you can convince him, but the way he is now\u2026\u2026I guess it\u2019s worth a shot first!\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s ident.i.ty was so lofty that even if Jing gege was very aloof he might still consider it.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cI was thinking it was worth a shot, maybe he\u2019ll see my sincerity and agree.\u201dXing Yue asked \u201cWant us to bring it up with him?\u201d\u201cNo need. Since I live here now he clearly knows my relations.h.i.+p with you guys. I\u2019ll go ask himself myself, it\u2019s more sincere this way.\u201dXing Yue nodded, Xiao Yao was great this way. She didn\u2019t make a big deal about anything, but when she wanted to do something she did it very appropriately.The next day Xiao Yao got up and asked her maids \u201cYou two pay attention, if Master Jing comes back then come tell me.\u201dNeither asked any questions and told her he was already back.Xiao Yao washed up, changed, and headed for the Evergreen Residence.It was very different in the daylight than at night, quiet and densely fragrant. Shan Hu knocked and it was Jing Ye who opened the door. Xiao Yao smiled \u201cIs your Master home?\u201dJing Ye recognized her as the drunken Princess from the other night and smiled \u201cMaster is home, Princess please come in.\u201dXiao Yao was smirking inside \u2013 she was so huffy towards me years ago, yet she is all sweet and solicitous now!Jing was working at the table but when he heard her familiar footsteps he didn\u2019t wait for her to be announced but walked outside to greet her. He was happy and surprised to see Xiao Yao.Jing Ye stared and thought Jing wasn\u2019t happy to welcome the Princess in so reminded him \u201cMaster, please welcome the Princess in.\u201dJing forced himself to calmly welcome Xiao Yao inside, and when she went in she told Shan Hu \u201cHave Jing Ye make you some tea and you guys go have fun, no need to wait on me.\u201dJing Ye felt this Princess spoke in a way that was very familiar but she couldn\u2019t place it. But seeing Jing\u2019s expression he clearly wanted her to go along with it so she said \u201cYes\u201d and then led Shan Hu away.When it was just the two of them alone in the room, Xiao Yao\u2019s expression turned cold and she asked \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come see me? If I didn\u2019t come find you, then you weren\u2019t going to find a way to come see me?\u201dJing said \u201cI went to see you already.\u201d Last night he hid in her courtyard trees and watched her until she was fast asleep before he left.\u201cYou were peeping at me?\u201d\u201cNot quite, I didn\u2019t get close, I only saw your outline\u2026..\u201d Jing\u2019s voice got smaller and smaller as he tried to explain.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cSo you want to see me?\u201dJing nodded, because he wanted to see her that was why he stayed in this residence.Xiao Yao said \u201cI told Xing Yue I was going to ask you to teach me the zither, that way you can see me every day.\u201dJing broke into an excited smile and Xiao Yao crowed \u201cAren\u2019t I smart?\u201dJing smiled and nodded his head.Xiao Yao looked at his happy smile but felt a twinge of sadness. All the young men went hunting but he stayed behind alone, what was his expression then? When he walked towards Yi Yang and she looked at him in revulsion, what was his expression then?Xiao Yao embraced him and pressed her face against his shoulder.Xiao Yao\u2019s movement was too tender and even if no words were spoken she conveyed it all. Jing embraced her back and buried his head in her hair and felt like time could stop now and he would want for nothing.The two of them quietly embraced for a long time, so long they forgot how much time had pa.s.sed.A slight coughing came from outside that woke Xiao Yao up and she lifted her head but Jing rubbed her head sweetly \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the maids are Jing Ye and Hu Ya, even if they see it there is no reason to worry.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and pushed Jing to the pallet \u201cI want to inspect your leg carefully.\u201dJing sat on the pallet and Xiao Yao kneeled on the floor and inspected his leg from his ankle upward until she got to his knee, and then she worked downward again and stopped where his bone broke. Xiao Yao thought and checked and finally said \u201cI can heal your leg, it won\u2019t be perfect but when you walk no one can tell it\u2019s slightly injured.\u201dJing asked \u201cDo you mind?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head and curved her body to kiss Jing\u2019s leg injury and his body shook. Xiao Yao was shocked by what she just did and felt bashful so she released Jing and sat with her head lowered.Jing sat down beside her \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, then no need.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.but I mind that other people mind. I don\u2019t really mind, I just don\u2019t want others to look down on you\u2026..I want you happy\u2026.I want you\u2026\u2026\u201dJing put his finger on Xiao Yao\u2019s lips to keep her from talking more \u201cI understand. You\u2019re worried I\u2019m hurt by the way others look at me, but I\u2019m not. Xiao Yao\u2026.\u201d Jing\u2019s hand caressed her from her forehead down \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to look at me even once, I don\u2019t care how others look at me. That can never hurt me.\u201dXiao Yao bit her lip and was about to speak when Jing\u2019s breathing became labored and he suddenly leaned forward and Xiao Yao forgot what she was going to say.Jing lightly kissed the corner of her lips and Xiao Yao closed her eyes not daring to move. Jing kissed the other corner of her lips and Xiao Yao still didn\u2019t move until finally he gently kissed her entirely on the lips.Jing\u2019s lips were soft and cool, reminding Xiao Yao of the phoenix flowers on a Summer\u2019s morning. When she was small she would often put the flower petals in her mouth to suck out the sap and the flower honey, and the sweetness would flow through her lips and slide own her throat. But this time instead of phoenix flowers, she was sucking on Jing.Jing softly began to nibble and his tongue licked her lips over and over until he tenderly put his tongue into her mouth. Xiao Yao\u2019s body turn soft and she fell backward weakly. She didn\u2019t understand, Jing was the one sucking on her but she still felt it was sweet, even sweeter than the phoenix flower honey, so sweet from her lips to her throat, from her throat to her heart. It spread everywhere until she was completely weak.Xiao Yao fell back on the pallet and Jing raised his head to look at her. Xiao Yao\u2019s hair was mussed and her sultry lips were softly moving and reddened while her eyelashes were batting furiously like a frightened b.u.t.terfly.Jing couldn\u2019t resist and leaned down to kiss her eyelashes and then he leaned down to kiss her cheeks loving the way it was stained with color. He kissed Xiao Yao\u2019s hair, loving the way it curled in his hands.Xiao Yao shyly opened her eyes a little but not completely, a smile breaking on her face.Jing couldn\u2019t help but kiss her smile, as if he wanted to suck it into his heart and keep it there forever.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d\u201cHhhmm?\u201d Jing didn\u2019t understand what she meant.Xiao Yao ducked into his embrace \u201cYour kiss is sweet.Jing understood and happily kissed her again \u201cBecause you are sweet so I got some of your sweetness.\u201dXiao Yao burrowed her face into his chest and her m.u.f.fled voice said \u201cShameless!\u201dJing\u2019s body was throbbing with desire and he didn\u2019t dare touch her anymore so he loosely held her in his arms.Xiao Yao raised her head and asked \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhy what?\u201d\u201cWhy now? Last time at the beach when I asked you\u2026.you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe you\u2019re too good, or maybe I\u2019m just too selfish now and thinking only of myself. Maybe because you were just so\u2026..\u201d Jing looked at Xiao Yao and smiled and she could guess he meant to say \u201calluring.\u201dXiao Yao hit him on the chest but Jing grabbed her fist and raised it to his lips to kiss her hand hard.Xiao Yao\u2019s heart started beating wildly. When it came to male-female matters, the two genders were so different. She appeared bold and a.s.sertive, but past a certain point she was shy, embarra.s.sed, scared, and excited. Jing appeared cool and rational, but past a certain point he was pa.s.sionate and aggressive, with a basic instinct to possess without any fear or hesitation.A knock sounded on the door and Jing Ye called out \u201cMaster.\u201dXiao Yao sat up hurriedly while Jing continued to lay on the pallet lazily and watch her. She pushed him and then he sat up and called back \u201cWhat is it?\u201dXiao Yao fixed her hair pin and Jing pulled it out and helped her put it back together neatly.Jing Ye said \u201cMiss Xing Yue\u2019s maid asked if the Princess was here and I said she was so the maid went to get Miss Xing Yue who should be here soon.\u201dXiao Yao was so nervous she immediately sat up but Jing pulled her down \u201cThere is still time, you fix yourself slowly.\u201dXiao Yao fixed her hair and inspected her robe before asking \u201cLooks good?\u201dJing stared at her and nodded with a smile.Xiao Yao stood by the window and took a few deep breaths to calm her emotions. Jing said \u201cXing Yue is here.\u201dA knock sounded and Jing Ye went to open the door and Xing Yue walked in.\u201cJing gege\u201d Xing Yue greeted him and also stared at Xiao Yao quizzically. Xiao Yao nodded and Xing Yue smiled \u201cCongrats, congrats.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI have to thank Jing willing to accept a stupid student like me.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cSince Xiao Yao wants to learn the zither, we need to find one for her. I\u2019ve collected four good ones and later I\u2019ll take you to pick one.\u201dXiao Yao quiclly said \u201cNo need, no need.\u201d She wasn\u2019t interested at all in learning the zither. If she had time she rather learn poisons, it could save her in danger and kill others. Xiao Yao was a very practical person.Xing Yue thought Xiao Yao was being polite \u201cDon\u2019t be polite with me, I don\u2019t need so many.\u201dJing helped Xiao Yao \u201cShe just started so there is no need to use a good zither. Tomorrow I\u2019ll take her to the zither store to pick out a beginners one.\u201dXing Yue felt that made sense \u201cFine. But I feel bad since I have things to do tomorrow so I won\u2019t go with you guys.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou said not to treat me like a guest so you do your things and I\u2019ll do mine.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cJing gege, let\u2019s dine together tonight and have Xiao Yao as your student toast you.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Jing nodded.The next morning, Jing came to find Xiao Yao to go buy a zither.It wasn\u2019t their first time shopping together but it was their first time shopping together alone and in broad daylight without any worries. Both of them were feeling quite strange about it. Xiao Yao wanted to laugh because she was happy. Jing was also happy and his happiness was reflected in his eyes.Jing took Xiao Yao to a zither store and when the sale clerk spotted Jing\u2019s presence he immediately ushered them into an inside room, lit the incense and brought out the tea, arranged all the beginner zithers and left them to select without any intrustion.Jing wanted Xiao Yao to pick the one she wanted but she said \u201cYou pick whatever one for me, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m really wanting to learn the zither.\u201dJing remained serious and helped her pick a good one. He checked out the zithers and Xiao Yao checked him out. Jing smiled and glanced up at her and his eyes brushed past her face to land on her lips. Xiao Yao\u2019s face reddened and she quickly averted her eyes and pretending to be interested in the zither next to her.Jing couldn\u2019t help it and reached out to grab her hand. Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes darted around as she looked at him nervously.Jing put her hands in his and said \u201cI just wanted to tell you that I feel like I am the luckiest man in the world.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhy?\u201dJing bent down and lowered his head to kiss her palms. He didn\u2019t raise his head but remained in a position that was bowing to Xiao Yao \u201cBecause of the way you look at me, the way you talk to me, everything you do for me.\u201dXiao Yao was embarra.s.sed and pulled her hand out and said angrily \u201cI look at you the same as I do everyone else, I don\u2019t talk to you tenderly at all, I\u2019m often angry at you. I did do a lot for you but you did a lot for me too.\u201dJing smiled and playfully pinched her cheeks before going to look at another zither. Because he felt Xiao Yao had put him inside her heart, he had become more easygoing around her and no longer as fearful and tentative as if he could lose her at any moment.Jing turned to Xiao Yao \u201cDoes this zither work?\u201dXiao Yao plinked the strings a few times \u201cIf you think it works then it\u2019s fine.\u201dJing summoned the sales clerk \u201cWe want this zither.\u201dThe sales clerk saw it was the best quality and the highest price one and was very happy \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll wrap it right up for you.\u201dXiao Yao asked in a low voice \u201cIs this your family\u2019s store?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHa! You\u2019re not giving yourself business?\u201dJing laughed \u201cI feel like this is really buying a present for you.\u201dXiao Yao smiled.Jing handed the wrapped zither to Hu Ya and said to Xiao Yao \u201cLet\u2019s walk home!\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cOkay.\u201dJing strolled with Xiao Yao the long way back, not because he wanted to buy anything, he just wanted to walk with Xiao Yao as long as possible in broad daylight.When they pa.s.sed by a street stall, Jing bought some duck necks and chicken feet which the owner wrapped up for him.He carried it and turned to the Xiao Yao who was dying to eat it right there and said \u201cEat it at home.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI want to eat the ones you make.\u201d Lao Mu\u2019s cooking was exceptional but neither Xiao Yao nor Xan Tian Er learned it, but s.h.i.+ Qi learned it all.Jing smiled \u201cSure, I\u2019ll make some for you later.\u201d\u201cHow? How to explain to Xing Yue?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, just get ready to eat it.\u201dThe two of them returned to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and Jing took Xiao Yao back to her residence. Xiao Yao watched him leave and her expression was unconcealed longing, like a cat that was going to be abandoned. Jing felt terrible but happy about it \u201cYou just rest, tomorrow I\u2019ll make you something tasty.\u201dXiao Yao nodded and walked into her room.Jing went out every morning to work so Xiao Yao practiced her archery.After lunch Xiao Yao would take a nap and after she woke up, Jing would be waiting for her in the Evergreen Residence.Jing was earnestly teaching Xiao Yao the zither and she was afraid Xing Yue and Feng Long would check on her progress so she was also earnestly learning, But as she learned she got impatient \u201cHow long do I have to learn to play a decent tune?\u201dJing replied \u201cDepends on your definition of a decent tune.\u201dXiao Yao explained \u201cSomething that makes the listener feel good. You play me a tune!\u201dJing hadn\u2019t played in twenty years and one time he sat down at his old zither and strummed it only to quickly realize his fingers were no longer fluid. The notes were off and that was a reminder of what happened to his body. Every time his brother tortured him and the insulting words he said reverberated in his ears and he flipped the zither. He didn\u2019t want to remember those words and remember the pain. He felt that he would never want to touch this again in his life.But right now Xiao Yao wanted him to play for her.Jing could not say no to her so he calmed himself down and concentrated every thought on playing. His fingers rested on the zither but he wasn\u2019t sure what to play. In the repeated torture, his heart had long lost the ability to appreciate music.Xiao Yao shyly smiled \u201cJust play the song I sang for you the other night. Do you still remember?\u201dHow could he ever forget?As the memory of Xiao Yao\u2019s singing the song echoed in his mind, Jing\u2019s heart gradually calmed down and he strummed the zither and began to play. Some notes were not perfect but in Jing\u2019s mind was Xiao Yao dancing and his zither was merely accompanying her singing. She danced under the moonlight while he played for her \u2013 together forever, never apart.After playing once, Jing started playing again. But this time he wasn\u2019t playing to her singing, he was playing the same song to tell her the same words \u2013 together forever, never apart.Xiao Yao understood what he was trying to say and moved into his arms and tightly embraced him around the waist. His playing stopped and Xiao Yao murmured \u201cI like listening.\u201dJing continued to play for her and there was no pain in his heart and no insulting words in his ears. His heart once again was peaceful and happy because of the beautiful sound of music, and it was even happier than before because he now had another person who was happy with his music.Jing Ye and Hu Ya heard the zither playing and both rushed out of their rooms, glancing at each other in shock. Their young master was playing the zither again! Not just playing, but his tune was happy and content!Jing Ye sat down on the ground and covered her mouth with her hands as her tears fell.All these years, despite master returning to Qing Qiu, he was no longer the famed Young Master of Qing Qiu Tu Shan Jing.Jing Ye thought Fang Feng Yi Yang would help heal his sorrows but she realized she was wrong. On snowy days, if Jing stood for long his legs would hurt a lot and she noticed but Fang Feng Yi Yang never sensed it and would continue to play.Fang Feng Yi Yang liked attending banquets and throwing parties and she was always the life of the party, playing the zither and shooting her arrows, the center of attention. But young master would just sit quietly in the corner.Jing Ye brought out young master\u2019s favorite zither and after he saw it, he couldn\u2019t resist trying to play it. But after a few notes he upended the zither and doubled over in pain. Fang Feng Yi Yang not only didn\u2019t comfort him, she looked at him with derision.At banquets people would request young master to play but he would politely decline. People didn\u2019t understand and would beg him to play but Fang Feng Yi Yang not only did not help him decline, she would stand to the side and watch with a smirk in her eyes.Later when young master wanted to end the engagement and spoke with Fang Feng Yi Yang, Jing Ye didn\u2019t know what they discussed but she changed after that and became considerate and tender. But Jing Ye already knew that she was just acting._________________________Jing lived in Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence for half a year from Autumn until Winter. Xiao Yao could see him everyday and he earnestly taught her the zither but she really didn\u2019t have any interest in learning. Every day she would get annoyed when practicing and said to Jing \u201cIf I want to listen to the zither I can ask you to play for me, why bother learning myself?\u201dTheir lessons gradually became Jing playing for her while she munched on the duck necks he made for her and drank the plum wine he brewed for her. Sometimes she would lay under the blanket reading medical books, or else she would chat about all sorts of random stuff with Jing.Every time Feng Long ran into Xiao Yao he would ask how her zither was coming along and she would just chuckle.Xiao Yao decided to take a shortcut and had Jing teach her the simplest tune he knew. She didn\u2019t need to learn technique, just the beat, and she forced herself to mimic the entire tune.Xiao Yao finished playing that tune and she excitedly howled \u201cI can play now, too!\u201dShe practiced for a few days until she felt she was pretty good so when Feng Long came back, she announced to him and Xing Yue \u201cI\u2019ll play a tune for you guys.\u201dFeng Long and Xing Yue sat down excitedly with a very solemn aura, just short of bathing and changing into new clothes for the occasion.Xiao Yao started playing and Xing Yue\u2019s expression changed. She glanced at Jing but he sat there very calmly. Feng Long\u2019s zither skill wasn\u2019t as good as Xing Yue but he was still a son of a powerful clan and learned all the four arts plus he had the talent to appreciate good skills so even he was staring at Xiao Yao with a dumbstruck look.Xiao Yao finished and looked expectantly towards Feng Long and Xing Yue.Xing Yue didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings so clapped overly enthusiastically while gently saying \u201cThere is still lots of room for improvement so keep working hard.\u201dFeng Long couldn\u2019t figure out what to say so Xiao Yao glared at him \u201cAre we friends or not? If we\u2019re friends then tell me the truth!\u201dFeng Long uncomfortably said \u201cI think your talents lie elsewhere. In the future if someone asks you to play the zither, you should decline! Don\u2019t feel bad, look at Jing and me, we\u2019re good at different things.\u201dXing Yue wouldn\u2019t contain it anymore and added \u201cXiao Yao, you wasted a great teacher. In the future if you play the zither, you should never reveal that your teacher was the Young Master of Qing Qiu.\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cI\u2019m really smart.\u201dJing explained \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault, I didn\u2019t teach her properly.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cThe master is too lenient, the student is too shameless, no wonder nothing got learned!\u201dXiao Yao flew over to pinch Xing Yue\u2019s lips \u201cWho are you calling shameless!\u201dXing Yue ducked and teased \u201cWhoever is anxious is the one who is shameless!\u201dXiao Yao stopped and wondered if she ought to be anxious? Feng Long and Jing laughed out loud and Xiao Yao decided to not overthink it and deal with Xing Yue first. Xing Yue quickly ran to hide behind her brother. Between all the laughter the four of them had a great time.By the end of Winter Jing needed to return to Qing Qiu to welcome the new Spring with his family and wish his grandmother a happy birthday. He had continued to delay leaving until he couldn\u2019t delay anymore.From Zhi Yi to Qing Qiu, if taking a cloud carriage it was just an hour away. A winged ride was even faster, just half an hour. But the day Jing left it was heavy snow so the cloud carriage couldn\u2019t be taken so Jing had to take the snow beast pulled snow carriage that would take multiple hours to arrive.Xiao Yao reminded him to be careful and handed medicine to Jing Ye to tell her that along the way if Jing\u2019s leg hurt to apply this medicine. In the future if he went out on snowy days to remember to apply this medicine first. When they got back, if his leg hurt then he was to soak it in a medicinal bath using the herbs she already prepared and put in his luggage.Jing Ye took everything down and packed all the items away.When the snow carriage pulled away, Jing Ye looked back at Xiao Yao, Feng Long, and Xing Yue standing at the front door until the distance widened to where Xing Yue and Feng Long had gone inside but Xiao Yao was going in slowly and periodically turning her head to look back.Jing Ye said and said to Hu Ya \u201cIf the Princess could be our Madam that would be so wonderful.\u201d When Jing Ye said this, she didn\u2019t keep her voice down.Hu Ya glanced at Jing and then admonished Jing Ye \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense. Master is engaged already. The Princess is just very grateful for Master teaching her these past months.\u201dJing Ye huffed \u201cWhat\u2019s an engagement anyway? It\u2019s not married, nothing is finalized! Haven\u2019t you heard of \u201cbroken engagement\u201d in this world?\u201dJing said there quietly as if he heard nothing. He looked out of the crystal windows as the entire world outside was blanketed in snow in complete whiteness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA fair word of warning \u2013 this chapter of Lost You Forever is intense. Jawdropping calamity of the first order arriving with almost nonstop action a few paragraphs in and doesn\u2019t let go type of intense. Next chapter is easily one of my personal favorite chapters in the entire novel, but before we get there we need to experience what is forthcoming here. The novel has hinted at Xiao Yao\u2019s birth father the Great General Qi Yo of the Sheng Nong Kingdom, and there isn\u2019t enough pages I can devote to what an awesome leading man he was in Once Promised. As a lover to Xiao Yao\u2019s mom he was unparalled in his devotion, but as a man he lived true to his principles and never once betrayed those who were dear to him. The problem in Once Promised was that there was a lot of decay and dissolution in the world and Qi Yo shouldered the burden of making sure the Sheng Nong Kingdom could survive the oncoming attack from the upstart Xuan Yuan Kingdom.To do so he needed a revolution and he had the heart and guts to lead one. But for those who benefited from the ingrained corruption and the cla.s.s subjugation, Qi Yo was persona non grata to the entire world. He dared to change the world to make it egalitarian, to lead it to a better future even if the rotten weeds of today needed to be exterminated. His heart was in the right place but he was but one G.o.d against many and his pa.s.sing at the end of Once Promised left the world a bit better but still fundamentally unchanged. Xiao Yao\u2019s mother knew that Xiao Yao would be in danger if her paternity were ever revealed because there were too many people who hated her father, and this chapter shows us just how impossible it is a task to keep Xiao Yao safe. Her life falls in mortal danger and it\u2019ll take the collective efforts of Jing, Zhuan Xu, and Xiang Liu to save her. As usual, the three men who love her save her in different ways with only one goal in mind \u2013 their beloved Xiao Yao must not die!Chapter 21 \u2013 Embracing in Life, Following in Death:Even though neither Xiao Yao nor Zhuan Xu cared to celebrate the lunar new year, Xiao Yao still felt Sheng Nong Mountain was too desolate and planned to go back to keep Zhuan Xu company.Xing Yue said \u201cEven if you go back, it\u2019s still the two of you in the huge Zhi Jin Palace. Why not have Zhuan Xu come here and we can barbecue while viewing the snowfall.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cThat\u2019s okay? My Gege and your Gege have been only meeting in public settings to avoid arousing attention, and the last time it was using your birthday party as an excuse.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my Gege arranged everything already. Zhuan Xu is the Prince and he is living all alone on Sheng Nong Mountain for the palace renovations. My dad is not just a Sheng Nong royal descendant, he\u2019s also the ruler of Zhi Yi Castle and administers to the people of the Middle Plains. No matter what ident.i.ty, he ought to host a thank you gathering for Zhuan Xu. Last year my dad wasn\u2019t at home so nothing was done, it would actually be weird if my dad didn\u2019t do something this year for Zhuan Xu. My Gege asked our dad to invite Zhuan Xu for a short stay in the residence to celebrate the lunar new year and no one will question that.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThat\u2019s great. I didn\u2019t want to go back to Sheng Nong Mountain, it\u2019s more fun in the castle.\u201dA few days later, Zhuan Xu arrived at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence.Xing Yue took Zhuan Xu to his residence and wanted to stay a bit but the lady of the house was busiest preparing for the lunar new year celebrations so she reluctantly said to Zhuan Xu \u201cI\u2019ll come see you tonight, Gege won\u2019t be home until tomorrow.\u201dXiao Yao was giggling off in the corner and Xing Yue glared at her before leaving with her face all red.Xiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cThank G.o.d you didn\u2019t bring Jin Xuan and Xiao Xiao. Xing Yue knows you have those two beside you, but she\u2019s still anxious about it. Seeing you didn\u2019t bring your maids, she seems relieved and even her smile is extra sweet. When we first met Xing Yue she was such an arrogant girl, Gege how did you tame her so that she not only is willing to follow you anywhere, she\u2019s even willing to let you bring along other girls.\u201dZhuan Xu ignored her teasing and stared at her \u201cYou\u2019ve been happy these past few months? If I didn\u2019t come, you were just going to totally forget about me?\u201dXiao Yao sheepishly smiled \u201cIf you didn\u2019t come, I was going to obediently go back to Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dZhuan Xu coldly huffed and Xiao Yao pouted \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, go ask Xing Yue. I even told her I was leaving, and only after hearing Feng Long\u2019s arrangement did I continue to stay.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s expression softened a bit but then he harshly said \u201cThat Tu Shan Jing is everywhere! He\u2019s already engaged with the Fang Feng family\u2019s daughter, what right does he have to compete with Feng Long for you!\u201dXiao Yao sat down beside him \u201cGege!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at her and she sincerely said \u201cIf I say he has the right, then he has the right. Plus there is no compet.i.tion, he doesn\u2019t even need to compete with Feng Long because I never considered Feng Long.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and expressionless for a moment and then he spoke \u201cI hear the Grand Madam of the Tu Shan clan really likes Fang Feng Yi Yang. She keeps her by her side and teaches her personally. Everyone already treats her like she\u2019s the next lady of the house. The Grand Madam doesn\u2019t care whether Jing likes Yi Yang, what matters is whether Yi Yang fits her requirements. She won\u2019t allow the engagement to be broken, and the Fang Feng family also won\u2019t allow the Tu Shan clan to break it off.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes showed her hard to conceal anxiety.Zhuan Xu sighed \u201cForget it, let\u2019s not discuss such unhappy matters. There is a long ways to go, we can discuss it another day.\u201dXiao Yao glared at him \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201d\u201cFine, it\u2019s all my fault!\u201dXiao Yao smiled and started to chat about this and that with Zhuan Xu. She read the letters written to her by the Grand Emperor. She told her dad about learning archery so his letter was mostly concern about that, reminding Xiao Yao not to force herself and even if she\u2019s not very good to not care too much.Zhuan Xu nodded \u201cI also think you\u2019re too insistent on this. You\u2019re not the wandering Wen Xiao Liu anymore. You have your dad, and also me. And you also have grandfather on Xuan Yuan Mountain!\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s letter also contained worry about Xiao Yao and Ah Nian\u2019s future marital prospects where he bemoaned that one daughter didn\u2019t want his worry even if he wanted to worry about her while the other daughter was constantly causing him to worry.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand what her dad meant but Zhuan Xu explained \u201cLast time after Ah Nian went back to Five G.o.ds Mountain, she raised a fuss about wanting to get married. Master helped pick prospective grooms for her but each choice she would spend a few days with and then reject.\u201dXiao Yao was laughing and rolling her eyes \u2013 that Ah Nian, thank goodness she had the best dad in the entire world. Xiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou even have a source on Five G.o.ds Mountain, I\u2019m impressed.\u201dZhuan Xu rolled his eyes at her \u201cI don\u2019t need a source there! I grew up there and have tons of buddies. I got this from Ru So\u2019s letter where he was complaining and worried that Master would decide on him as the groom. He felt like I was a fake poser when I was there but now that I\u2019m gone and he\u2019s being tormented by Ah Nian, he really misses me being there.\u201dXiao Yao laughed out loud and Zhuan Xu also smiled and sighed \u201cActually I miss them a lot, too. I was a down on his luck prince in a foreign land. They were all Gao Xing n.o.bles but they never made me feel low. Even when we fought it was sincere and now looking back I just remember the good times and all the bad times fade away.\u201dXiao Yao smiled, back then Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t wait to leave Gao Xing and got back to Xuan Yuan. But no matter how much he missed Gao Xing now, with his ident.i.ty he would never be able to go back. Just like the Yellow Emperor never ever stepped foot in Gao Xing, Zhuan Xu\u2019s life on Five G.o.ds Mountain would forever remain only in his childhood memory.Xing Yue came to find them for dinner and after a simple meal, Xiao Yao made her excuses and left so that Xing Yue and Zhuan Xu could be alone.The next day on lunar new year\u2019s eve, Feng Long came home.That night Little Zhu Rong had a meal with the four kids. After dinner he didn\u2019t depart as usual but sat around a fire pit with them and asked about his daughter and son\u2019s daily matters. He also asked about Zhuan Xu\u2019s affairs but his att.i.tude towards Zhuan Xu was a bit unusual and Zhuan Xu was also rather strange around him.Feng Long and Xing Yue both knew their grandfather Sheng Nong Zhu Rong and the Xuan Yuan Fourth Prince died together. Xiao Yao also knew how her Fourth Uncle died. But this was so far ago for Feng Long and Xing Yue that they wouldn\u2019t feel the rage and anger of losing a loved one. Xiao Yao knew that Zhuan Xu already let go of personal vengeance hundreds of years ago. So the three of them pretended not to notice anything was off.Xiao Yao inwardly sighed. Little Zhu Rong also gave up on personal vengeance for the greater good. He created a peaceful life for the people of the Middle Plains and gave up on personal and national vengeance. Perhaps because Little Zhu Rong and Zhuan Xu made the same decision, there was grudging respect for each other.As the new year counted down, Little Zhu Rong led them up to the rooftop to watch the fireworks.There were soldiers on all four corners of the Castle releasing specially made fireworks which flew high in the air and turned into beautiful flowers. The entire sky was like a colorful garden.The humans were on the streets releasing their own fireworks which didn\u2019t fly as high but were amusing and everywhere there was laughter and joy.This was the scene of world peace and the happiness of no warfare.Xing Yue whispered in Xiao Yao\u2019s ear \u201cMy dad is especially fond of fireworks. Every year he hand selects the fireworks and to make it beautiful enough he would even pay for it himself.\u201dXiao Yao looked up at the fireworks and thought that it must be just as beautiful right now in Qing Qiu. Jing was likely with his grandmother and watching fireworks with a lot of people as fireworks exploded in the sky. Right now in the mountains outside of Qing Shui Town, it was likely pitch black and freezing cold. The soldiers would be sitting around fires drinking coa.r.s.e wine and singing national anthems. Xiang Liu was likely dressed all in white and accompanying General Gong Gong as they walked through each and every encampment.___________________________After the fireworks, Little Zhu Rong went to bed and told the kids to keep having fun.The four chatted and then went back to the fire pit.Xing Yue and Xiao Yao sat in the outer room pallet and nodded off while Feng Long and Zhuan Xu huddled inside to discuss their matters.Xiao Yao fell asleep and in her sleepy daze she felt someone covered her with a blanket. She opened her eyes and saw that she was sleeping next to Xing Yue and they were actually nestled together on the same pillow.Xing Yue also woke and drowsily asked \u201cAre you guys done?\u201dZhuan Xu covered them with a blanket and said in a soft voice \u201cNo, I heard no talking out here so came out to check. You guys keep sleeping!\u201dXing Yue was so tired from all the holiday preparations that she couldn\u2019t even get up if she wanted and fell back asleep.Xiao Yao also closed her eyes.Zhuan Xu stared at them sleeping side by side, their hair spread out, their sleeping faces sweet in slumber, each with her own alluring features that seemed so complementary right now. It really was like two blooming flowers arrayed side-by-side. Zhuan Xu\u2019s heart skipped a few beats and he stared for a moment before gently stroking Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead and then lightly walked back into the inner room.Zhuan Xu stayed for four days in Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence but Feng Long only stayed for one night and the second day he rode his winged ride back to Chi Sui.Xing Yue stuck her tongue out at Xiao Yao \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, he\u2019s busy like this all the time. He spent new year\u2019s eve with my dad and me, now he has to rush back to spend new year\u2019s day with our grandfather and mom. Actually grandfather and mom don\u2019t mind, but those Chi Sui clan elders will grouse about it. Gege is so sick of them already! They think the Chi Sui clan leader position is greater than the Heavens but my Gege doesn\u2019t think too highly of it. He thinks the clan rules are too strict and hamper what he wants to do.\u201dWhen Zhuan Xu returned to Sheng Nong Mountain, Xing Yue was more upset than Xiao Yao. When his cloud carriage disappeared in the sky, she stood there in a daze until Xiao Yao laughed did she pull her gaze from the sky and sigh \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, you\u2019ll have your turn one day.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, her day was already here but she controlled it well is all. But she also knew that it wasn\u2019t her concealing it all that well, it was Xing Yue not believing it was even possible for Xiao Yao to like Jing. Xiao Yao was like a tomboy and when she was all excited she would be chummy with Feng Long as well. So Xing Yue never even considered that possibility with Jing.Xing Yue asked Xiao Yao \u201cYou really don\u2019t have any feelings for my Gege?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cActually, your Gege has no romantic feelings for me either.\u201dXing Yue knew Xiao Yao was smart and insightful so conceded \u201cMy Gege\u2019s heart isn\u2019t on women and romance. He actually likes you well enough, or better said that as long as he doesn\u2019t dislike you that is enough. Marriage between the G.o.ds, how many are based on true love? As long as the two people can get along well like friends then that is a good marriage. Actually my Gege is different then your Gege, my Gege has never fallen for any woman. If you married my Gege, you never need to worry about other women coming in to annoy you.\u201d Xing Yue let out a loud sigh.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare respond so gave a silly chuckle and changed the subject._________________________Little Zhu Rong went to Xuan Yuan Castle and reported to the Yellow Emperor \u2013 Feng Long was in Chi Sui, Zhuan Xu was on Sheng Nong Mountain, Jing was at Qing Qiu, and the only people left in Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence was Xiao Yao and Xing Yue.The Tan family daughter extended an invitation to Xing Yue to invite her and the Princess to the countryside for a Winter cherry blossom viewing.Xing Yue said to Xiao Yao \u201cCherry blossoms are nothing but an excuse to go out and play. I\u2019m really bored so let\u2019s go for a twirl!\u201dXiao Yao was different than Xing Yue, she lived alone in the mountains for twenty years, then captured by the Nine-tailed fox for thirty years. She liked people keeping her company but she was picky about who her companions were. She would rather be alone than hang out with people she didn\u2019t like. She lazily drawled \u201cYou go, I\u2019ll stay home and practice archery.\u201dXing Yue was insistent and grabbed her arm \u201cGood sister, the invitation named you as well. If you don\u2019t go, they\u2019ll discuss it behind my back that I\u2019m boasting about being good friends with the Gao Xing Princess but you won\u2019t give me any face.\u201dXiao Yao knew those folks put a lot of emphasis on courtesy and Xing Yue was very proud so she couldn\u2019t lose face in front of those powerful offspring so Xiao Yao smiled \u201cSister-in-law gives me an order, how could I disobey. But let\u2019s agree beforehand that I\u2019m not in the mood to make polite talk so you\u2019ll have to deal with them for me.\u201dXing Yue blushed and pinched Xiao Yao \u201cIt\u2019s not clear who is going to call who sister-in-law yet!\u201dWhen Xiao Yao and Xing Yue arrived at the cherry blossom forest, there were already a lot of people there.Xiao Yao was wearing a veiled hat and followed behind Xing Yue, going wherever Xing Yue went and talking to whomever Xing Yue told her to. She was quiet but everyone knew the Gao Xing Princess was difficult so no one minded and was only envious that XIng Yue was so chummy with her.Xiao Yao saw the Mu family son, and even though the last time she saw him looking at her through the window, it was enough for her to take note because her survival instinct was so strong so now she still remembered him.A s...o...b..ll fight started in the cherry blossom forest and Xing Yue and her cousins were pulled into it.A girl accidentally threw a s...o...b..ll on Xiao Yao and kept apologizing but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t mind so she moved away from the s...o...b..ll fight and started walking around the cherry blossom forest. The cherry blossoms were blooming beautifully and because Xiao Yao could hear all the girls laughing and shrieking in the fight, she didn\u2019t feel like she was walking too far from them and continued heading towards the most beautiful view.Suddenly all the sound disappeared and the cherry blossom forest was blooming in silence. Xiao Yao\u2019s beast instinct caused her to stop in her steps and look carefully ahead before slowly turning around. She wanted to head back the way she came but the snow was fresh and there were no footprints in sight.Xiao Yao took off her veiled hat and looked around, she was surrounded by fresh white snow as if she was dropped from the sky to here.Xiao Yao gripped poison in her hand and looked at the sky but couldn\u2019t find the sun. She looked at the cherry blossoms and realized none were casting a shadow so she couldn\u2019t determine the direction. The only explanation was that she was in the middle of a spiritual power maze.To create a maze or to break a maze, both were deep powers that required training and knowledge for hundreds of years to acquire. Xiao Yao lived in Jade Mountain when she was small and the Royal Mother hadn\u2019t yet taught her such knowledge and skills before she ran away. Later on there was no one to teach her so Xiao Yao understood next to nothing about spiritual mazes.Xiao Yao knew she was facing a powerful opponent and if the person didn\u2019t appear then her poison was of no use.Xiao Yao concentrated but wasn\u2019t too worried. She was backed by the Grand Emperor and the Yellow Emperor and no one would risk entire clan and family extermination to kill her. But she couldn\u2019t figure out who wanted to trap her and thought perhaps she wandered into someone else\u2019s maze and when the owner discovered it she would be released.But Xiao Yao quickly realized she was mistaken.All the cherry blossom branches started to move and reached out to wrap around her. Xiao Yao used her agility from living on the mountains to duck and dodge like a monkey but her powers were low so after some time of being attacked she had fallen down many times but continued to get up and keep on running.Suddenly a blackened charred hand reached out from under the snow and grabbed her foot. She tried to use a dagger to stab the hand but the hand turned into a long spike and impaled her foot into the ground.The cherry blossom branch turned into a giant hammer and came down on Xiao Yao\u2019s head but she endured the pain and pulled her foot free and dodged so the hammer struck the snow and sent the snow flurries flying.Xiao Yao\u2019s foot was bleeding profusely and she screamed \u201cWho are you? Why do you want to kill me? If you want to kill me then come out instead of hiding like a coward.\u201d Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t trying to threaten the person since whomever did it clearly understood the consequences. She just wanted to know why the person hated her and was willing to incur the wrath of two Emperors to kill her.No one answered her.This maze was even more powerful and intricate than the maze used by Chi Sui Xian when she battled Yu Jiang at the Autumn Tournament. Only a truly powerful fighter like Chi Sui Xian or Yu Jiang or someone of their level could create such a maze with one person\u2019s power. But Xiao Yao really couldn\u2019t figure out when she incurred such deadly wrath. But then she thought of something scarier, this maze wasn\u2019t the creation of one person but the combined efforts of many. There was actually a group of people with not low powers who wanted her dead!A beast\u2019s growl reached her and two violent vicious beasts appeared in the cherry blossom forest. No such beast could ever exist in such a forest so this must be someone who had the ability to control G.o.d beast who sent them here to kill her.The beasts smelled blood and walked towards Xiao Yao. Her foot was bleeding and she was almost out of strength so she couldn\u2019t escape their attack. She sat down on the snow and quietly watched the beasts.The beasts looked at the weak Xiao Yao and instinctively realized there was danger and started to back away. They were indicating defeat and no intention of attacking her, but suddenly there was a cry from above and the beasts owner was forcing them to attack. The beasts raised its head and had no choice but to attack.One beast rushed Xiao Yao and opened its mouth wide but she put her hand into his mouth, all it needed to do was bite down and her arm would be ripped clean off.The beast closed its mouth but the teeth were blocked by a sharp dagger. Xiao Yao grabbed the dagger out of the beast\u2019s mouth and ducked below its body just in time to avoid the attack of the other beast.The beast raised up to strike with its claws and Xiao Yao stared at it coldly. When the beast\u2019s claw came down, it sensed its life was at an end and whined pitifully before falling on the ground.The other beast stared at its companion and Xiao Yao used the chance to stab it in the eye with her dagger before ducking away behind the dead other beast as a barrier to avoid attack.The beasts had thick skin which made it hard to poison it, but its weak spots were the mouth and eyes. So when Xiao Yao risked her life to stick her hand in to poison it, she then took advantage of the other beast\u2019s shock at seeing its companion die suddenly to strike it in the eye with more poison. It didn\u2019t seem like a lot of work but required precision otherwise she would have lost an arm and would likely be in the beast\u2019s belly right now.Both beasts were dead.Xiao Yao was still alive but she used up the final bits of her strength in the battle. She screamed \u201cIf you guys have the ability then keep on going! I want to see what else you have up your sleeve.\u201dXiao Yao sensed they hated her immensely otherwise they could use many faster ways to kill her but sent the beasts clearly to make sure she suffered and didn\u2019t die a quick death. Xiao Yao wanted them to use more tricks to torment her because Xing Yue was not an idiot and she would sense something was wrong, and if she sensed it then Xiao Yao had a chance to survive today.A man walked out from the cherry blossom forest and it was the Mu family son.Xiao Yao\u2019s heart fell, if they weren\u2019t concealing themselves anymore, it meant she had run out of time to stall.The Mu family son said \u201cWe would rejoice at seeing you die in the most painful way possible, but we can\u2019t risk you surviving.\u201dThe cherry blossom trees started to wildly dance and branches reached out from all sides to twist around Xiao Yao\u2019s limbs. She was too weak to run anymore so the branches tightly gripped her and then pulled her into the air to dangle above the ground.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy? We\u2019ve never met before, what did I do to make you hate me this much?\u201dThe Mu family son yelled in rage \u201cWhat did you do? My entire tribe\u2019s three hundred and forty-seven lives!\u201d\u201cIt was Qi Yo who exterminated your entire tribe, what does that have to do with me?\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s body was shaking uncontrollably.The Mu family son yelled \u201cWhat does Qi Yo have to do with you? Stop pretending! He killed all my relatives and now I\u2019m going to kill his only relative! To use your blood to avenge the deaths of our families, all one thousand twenty two lives!\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cNo! No! I have no relations.h.i.+p with Qi Yo! My dad is the Grand Emperor!\u201dAll the snow on the ground turned into the sharpest blades and pierced Xiao Yao\u2019s palms and feet. The blood started to splash on the snow in a sight that was shocking to behold.The pain started to spread as if all her insides was being ripped to shreds but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t utter any sound and instead calmly said said \u201cI have no relations.h.i.+p with Qi Yo, my dad is the Grand Emperor!\u201dThe Mu family son howled \u201cThis blood is for the Zhan family!\u201dSix sharp blades cut into Xiao Yao\u2019s legs and her blood continued to fall. She was in such pain but she still refused to scream or beg and instead just said \u201cMy dad\u2026.is the Grand Emperor.\u201dThe Mu family son raged \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you refuse to admit it! This is for the Zin family!\u201dThree sharp blades pierced Xiao Yao\u2019s torso and her blood flowed like a waterfall as the Mu family son said \u201cThis is for the Shen family!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was stark white and she kept trying to talk \u201cYou\u2026..you\u2026..you are killing\u2026..the wrong person.\u201dThe Mu family son had tears in his eyes as he looked up to the sky \u201cMom, Dad, may you rest in peace now!\u201dHe waved his hand and the cherry blossoms danced in the sky and became sharp cherry blossom knives. The Mu family son said \u201cAnd this is for the Mu family!\u201dAn entire sky filled with cherry blossom knives flew towards Xiao Yao and embedded into her entire body and blood blanketed the cherry blossom forest like rain falling._____________________________________The deep mountains outside Qing Shui Town.Inside a room, Xiang Liu was discussing with his adopted father about the Spring rations for the army when suddenly he bolted upright and his face changed.Gong Gong stared at him oddly \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI need to leave for something.\u201dXiang Liu left with just one word and whistled as he sprinted outside. Before a white and gold condor had even landed Xiang Liu had vaulted on its back and directed it Northwest.Gong Gong and another general in the room stared at each other and then looked out the door._____________________________________Sheng Nong Mountain, Zhi Jin Summit.Inside a room, Zhuan Xu was sitting on the pallet with his back against the wall as Xiao Xiao was sprawled on his knee while he stroked her hair and listened with a lazy demeanor about the latest palace renovation update.Suddenly Zhuan Xu felt his heart was jumbled and he almost couldn\u2019t breath. He pushed Xiao Xiao aside and stood up. The subordinates could tell something was off and quickly scurried out.Xiao Xiao waited for Zhuan Xu thinking he was about to give her an important a.s.signment.Zhuan Xu\u2019s face was confused as he tried to remember, and then he remembered that when his father died tens of thousands of miles away, he had the same worry and confusion. Zhuan Xu\u2019s entire demeanor changed and he said to Xiao Xiao \u201cYou immediately bring people to Zhi Yi to find Xiao Yao and bring her to see me. No matter what happens you have to keep her safe.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Xiao turned and left.Zhuan Xu paced the room until he suddenly burst out the door and hollered \u201cServants! I need to go to Zhi Yi!\u201dHe got on his winged ride and looked out at the sky as he prayed over and over in his mind \u201cMom, Dad, Auntie, Grandmother, Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle, I beg you, I beg all of you!\u201dNo matter how difficult his life was he always a.s.sured them in his mind \u201cYou guys don\u2019t worry, I will continue on well!\u201d But this time he begged of them, he begged them to help protect the last loved one in his life!_____________________________________Qing Qiu, the Tu Shan clan residence.The Grand Madam was in a room with Jing, Yi Yang, Hou, Hou\u2019s wife Lan Mu. She was lecturing them \u201cI don\u2019t have many more years to live. My first wish is for Jing to quickly become the clan leader. The second is for you brothers to get along well to protect the clan together. And the third is for a grand child. If all three wishes are fulfilled, I will die happy.\u201dAll four said nothing and the Grand Madam coughed so Jing and Hou quickly got her water and patted her on the back. Jing said \u201cGrandmother, don\u2019t worry and rest up. If you get better, everything will be fine.\u201dThe Grand Madam glared at him \u201cYou\u2019re my biggest worry! I want you to get married and you refuse. I ask you to hold the clan leader initiation ceremony and you also refuse. How long are you going to delay all this?\u201dAt that moment the satchel on Jing\u2019s waist suddenly snapped and fell on the ground. Jing stared and then picked it up and felt a ominous feeling. Xiao Yao gave him this satchel! Jing\u2019s face changed and he rushed out the door with nothing on his mind but one thought: Xiao Yao, he had to find Xiao Yao immediately.Yi Yang and Lan Mu were both stunned and Yi Yang called out \u201cJing, Jing, where are you going?\u201dThe Grand Madam said \u201cSomething must\u2019ve happened. Jing can sense it but doesn\u2019t know exactly what it is.\u201dYi Yang and Lan Mu looked at the Grand Madam and she explained \u201cThe true descendants of the Tu Shan clan bloodline possess this power. It cannot be described or explained but is a sensation of something big about to happen. From the ancient times until now, the Tu Shan clan leader may not have the strongest powers but we have become one of the most powerful clans because of this special ability which helps the clan avoid calamity\u201d The Grand Madam glanced at Hou and then at the Nine-tailed fox drawing on the wall before saying \u201cJing is destined to be the next clan leader!\u201dLan Mu lowered her head and didn\u2019t dare look at Hou while Yi Yang glanced at him with a worried look. Hou coldly smiled._____________________________________Jing furiously urged his winged ride faster to get to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and learned Xiao Yao was not there. Shan Hu quizzically said \u201cPrincess went to the cherry blossom forest in the countryside.\u201dJing rushed there and the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. Men and women were playing under the trees and the sound of happy feminine laughter rang out and there was no hint of danger.Jing tensed up and brought out little fox and asked it to track Xiao Yao. The Nine-tailed fox was a born tracker and good at concealment, plus Jing kept Xiao Yao on his heart and mind all the time so even if her scent was mixed with many, he could still differentiate if there was even the slightest smell of her.Jing was born with the spiritual eye that could see through any enchantments and mazes, plus with the help of little fox, he tracked her to another canyon. He saw a maze formed using water, wood, and fire, it was a kill maze. The ground covered in snow was to his advantage and he grabbed the snow in hand and created a fog to envelope him and he disappeared from sight.Jing entered the maze and heard a man\u2019s sorrowful wailing and followed the sound. He didn\u2019t see the man but before him was a snowy ground that was dyed red with blood. A bloodied person was hanging in mid air, the body so cut up it was impossible to tell if it was a man or a woman, but her face was pristine as if carved from a crystal jade and her eyes were still opened wide.Jing let out a scream from deep within his soul, it was a scream that didn\u2019t even sound like it was made by a person, and he flew up and used his hands to slash the branches and grabbed Xiao Yao in his arms.Jing went to feel for her pulse but felt nothing. His entire body was shaking and he tightly embraced Xiao Yao and tried to use his body warmth to warm her icy cold body.He put his hand on her back and continued to push spiritual power into her \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u201dJing called to Xiao Yao and leaned in to kiss her.He kissed her cheek, but her face was still as white as fresh snow. She didn\u2019t blush for him.He kissed her eyes, but her eyelashes didn\u2019t flutter like a b.u.t.terfly\u2019s wing.He kissed her lips and sucked but her lips were tightly shut and cold and hard. She would no longer open like a flower for him so he could taste the world\u2019s sweetest nectar.Jing continued to kiss Xiao Yao but there was no response.Jing\u2019s entire body was convulsing and his tears came down like falling rain. Xiao Yao, Xiao Yao, I beg of you!No matter how much power he transferred to her, her pulse never started again.Jing let out a gutwrenching scream as his tears soaked her robe.Xiao Yao! If you\u2019re not in this world, how do you expect me to continue living? I was wrong! I was really wrong! I should have never left you! No matter what reason, I should have never left your side!The final stage of the maze started and every single cherry blossom turned into a flickering flame and a burning inferno lit up to destroy everything so that even if the Grand Emperor and the Yellow Emperor wanted to destroy all there would be no proof left.The flames rushed forward and burned Jing\u2019s clothes and his skin was in pain but he continued to hold Xiao Yao tightly in his arms and allowed the flames to engulf them together.Xiao Yao, I only want to be your Ye s.h.i.+ Qi. I said I would listen to you for life so you can\u2019t leave me! If you leave then I\u2019ll go with you. No matter where you run to, I\u2019ll always chase after you!__________________________________By the time Zhuan Xu and Xiao Xiao arrived at the canyon it was already ablaze in towering flames.Zhuan Xu wanted to rush in \u201cXiao Yao is inside, Xiao Yao must be inside!\u201dXiao Xiao stopped him \u201cYour highness, this is a kill maze and the maze has started. You can\u2019t risk going in. We\u2019ll go save the Princess.\u201dZhuan Xu paid her no need and rushed forward while screaming \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Xiao summoned all her power and hit Zhuan Xu hard on the back of neck and he fainted.Xiao Xiao ordered the two guards \u201cProtect His highness!\u201dShe led four more guards into the fiery inferno with one final order \u201cIf we\u2019re not back in half an hour that means we\u2019re all dead. You two take his highness back to Sheng Nong Mountain immediately. After he calms down, he will forgive you.\u201dThe flames licked them from all sides and they could only use all their power to hold off the flames and at most they could withstand only half an hour inside. Other than the red flames they could only see other so they searched and called \u201cPrincess, Princess\u2026.\u201dAs the time pa.s.sed the guards with lower power already had charred skin but they didn\u2019t stop and continued searching and calling. Suddenly Xiao Xiao called \u201cHalt!\u201dThe five all paused and Xiao Xiao turned her head before pointing left \u201cOver there!\u201dThe five rushed over and saw a man holding a woman tightly in the center of the flames, he was transferring power to her and her body was not scorched by the flames but he was completely burned to the point of pa.s.sing out.They surrounded the man and extinguished the flames and Xiao Xiao recognized him as Tu Shan Jing. She ordered \u201cI\u2019ll take the Princess, you guys help Master Jing.\u201dThey wanted to carry Jing but his arms were in a death grip around Xiao Yao and they couldn\u2019t separate them. Xiao Xiao had no time to lose \u201cTake them together and we can deal with it later.\u201dA wood power guard created a stretcher and they placed Xiao Yao and Jing on it before carrying them out of the inferno.They were all highly trained powerful warriors so they easily found their way out of the maze and escaped in no time. Zhuan Xu was still pa.s.sed out and Xiao Xiao inspected Jing and Xiao Yao\u2019s pulses and her face fell \u201cMaster Jing is still alive but the Princess\u2026..she has no pulse.\u201dXiao Xiao put her hand on Xiao Yao\u2019s back and said to the guards \u201cBack to Sheng Nong Mountain immediately. Even if its useless, from now on we have to keep transferring power to the Princess. Tell Miss Xing Yue that the Princess is gravely injured and to bring us the best doctors in the Middle Plains but seal all the information.\u201dBack at Sheng Nong Mountain, Zhuan Xu bolted upright the moment he woke up \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dXiao Xiao reported \u201cWe brought the Princess back from the inferno.\u201d She didn\u2019t dare say save, she could only say bring back.Zhuan Xu was elated \u201cWhere is Xiao Yao?\u201dJin Xuan cautiously led Zhuan Xu to see Xiao Yao. After the efforts of the guards, they finally separated Jing from Xiao Yao and she was placed on a special water jade pallet which was used by the Flame Emperor to heal because the water jade could collect all the spiritual power to protect the body. The guards took turns sitting at the head of the pallet and placing their hands on the water jade to transfer power to Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao\u2019s body was wrapped tightly like a wrapped rice dumpling but her face was uncovered. Zhuan Xu\u2019s doctor sat at the end of the pallet and stood up when she saw Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cHow is she?\u201dDoctor Yin was a mute and studied medicine from childhood so wasn\u2019t very adept at social conversing so he signed directly \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201dZhuan Xu glared at Doctor Yin as if he was a thundering beast about to attack and Yin never felt such fear before and quickly kneeled down.After a moment, Zhuan Xu spit out \u201cLeave.\u201dYin quickly left and Zhuan Xu sat down beside Xiao Yao and touched her from her head down to her toes. His face was dark but he was eerily calm and said \u201cExplain!\u201dXiao Xiao immediately reported \u201cThe Princess\u2019s hands and feet were cut by sharp blades, her left leg pierced three times, her right leg pierced three times. Her left arm cut twice, her right arm cut twice. Her abdomen was sliced three times. And her entire body was embedded with countless sharp daggers. This was the vengeance of using blood to avenge blood. The final maze attack was a fire inferno. Based on all the injuries on her body, there was also a wood and a fire power expert involved. Preliminary evidence suggests three people created the maze together but it was one elaborate plan intended to kill her. It could not have been planned in a short time, and one of the involved persons must know the Tan family daughter so as to know beforehand that she invited Miss Xing Yue and the Princess out to play.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s breathing was labored and he finally said \u201cInvestigate! And after it\u2019s been revealed, don\u2019t let them die!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Xiao turned and walked out the door.Jin Xuan asked \u201cShall we send word to the Grand Emperor and the Yellow Emperor?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cHow can they not be told? Have the best doctors from Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing brought here!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Yao had no life but with the power being continuously transferred to her, her body remained soft and warm rather than cold and stiff. Even though no pulse could be detected, but Zhuan Xu felt that her heart was still beating slightly.Zhuan Xu gently touched Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead \u201cI know you\u2019re very brave and you\u2019ll make it through this. You\u2019ve endured being left behind and I know you won\u2019t leave me behind. I\u2019ve planted the phoenix tree on Zhi Jin Summit and in tens of years it\u2019ll grow tall. You promised me that you\u2019ll be with me to watch the phoenix flowers bloom all over Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dXing Yue brought the best doctors in the Middle Plains and rushed to Sheng Nong Mountain. When she saw the dead Xiao Yao, she collapsed on the ground and couldn\u2019t even say a word.The doctors examined Xiao Yao while Zhuan Xu walked over to help Xing Yue up \u201cIt\u2019s not because of you. They planned so well, if they didn\u2019t use you they would use someone else. No need to put the fault of others on you.\u201dXing Yue\u2019s tears pooled in her eyes and she felt her heart warm over, but that just made her feel worse and she was even angrier at those who would use her. She forced the words out \u201cI will start investigating from my Tan family cousin onward and give Xiao Yao back the truth.\u201dZhuan Xu and Xing Yue looked towards the two doctors who carefully examined Xiao Yao before looking at each other and kneeling down \u201cYour highness, we are worthless.\u201d Their words were not direct but it was the same as Doctor Yin, there was no hope for Xiao Yao.The master of these two doctors learned directly from the Flame Emperor and could be considered the true disciples who learned all the teachings of the Flame Emperor. If they said there was no way to save her, then were was no other doctor in the vast wilderness who could save Xiao Yao. Xing Yue\u2019s tears fell but she forced herself not to cry out and cause Zhuan Xu more agony.Zhuan Xu was very calm and waved his hand for the two doctors to leave before turning to Xing Yue \u201cXiao Yao won\u2019t leave me behind, she\u2019ll make it.\u201dXing Yue wanted to say something but Jin Xuan shook her head towards her so Xing Yue said nothing and just handed a box of all the magical and rare medicines she brought.Zhuan Xu said \u201cThank you. You can\u2019t help even if you stayed but there is something I need you to do that you are best suited for.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cI know. I\u2019ll go back now and start investigating from my cousin Tan. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll find out something to start with.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d\u201cNo need, you take care of Xiao Yao!\u201dZhuan Xu said to Jin Xuan \u201cWalk Xing Yue out for me.\u201dJin Xuan walked Xing Yue out and Xing Yue said \u201cThank you back there.\u201dJin Xuan bowed \u201cMiss you are too polite.\u201dThese two women had no connection with each other but because they liked the same man, their connection became rather odd.Xing Yue asked the two doctors \u201cIs the Princess really\u2026..dead?\u201dThe doctors replied \u201cShe\u2019s dead. There is still life coursing through her because of the unending transfer of power into her body, but the moment that ends her body will be completely dead.\u201dXing Yue hesitated and then said to Jin Xuan \u201cXiao Yao is dead and Zhuan Xu hasn\u2019t yet accepted the truth. Please do your best to comfort him.\u201dXing Yue vaulted on her winged ring and left with the doctors.Jin Xuan returned to court and found Zhuan Xu still sitting next to the pallet. The guard transferring power was ashen white and another guard took his place.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cHow is Jing\u2019s injury?\u201d\u201cMaster Jing is just burned. Doctor Yin said his injuries are not severe but he\u2019s inconsolable and his spirit is actively seeking death which is why he remains unconscious.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and then said \u201cAt least he\u2019s worthy of Xiao Yao\u2019s consideration for him. Use the spiritual medicines to preserve his life. If Xiao Yao can make it, then he\u2019ll wake up as well.\u201dZhuan Xu stayed beside Xiao Yao all night. When Xiao Xiao came back, Jin Xuan murmured \u201cFrom yesterday afternoon until now he\u2019s been inside, should we do something about it?\u201dXiao Xiao shook her head \u201cHis highness understands what he is doing. He cannot rage, he doesn\u2019t have the luxury of sorrow, and he cannot collapse. He only has this avenue to let it all out. We need to do our jobs at this time.\u201dSuddenly the guards on Sheng Nong Mountain broadcast a sharp warning alert, indicating someone was forcibly breaching the mountain.The guards tasked with the sky defense were on their winged rides and rushed in a certain direction and in mere minutes the unusually desolate Sheng Nong Mountain was swarming with guards on the ground and in the air.Xiao Xuao gripped her weapon and hollered \u201cEveryone to your positions, do not get distracted.\u201dJin Xuan retreated into court to protect Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu laughed \u201cIf anyone dares to try an attempt on my life right now, I will make him regret that decision.\u201dThe powers collided and the sound of thunderous battle reached them. Zhuan Xu smiled at Jin Xuan \u201cLooks like the power is strong and is not a run of the mill a.s.sa.s.sin. Since it\u2019s not a n.o.body, let\u2019s go for a meet.\u201dJin Xuan wanted to talk him out of it but held back \u201cYes.\u201d Before this man, everything was within his control and all she could do was obey.Zhuan Xu said to the guards \u201cNo matter what happens, your job is to protect the Princess at all costs.\u201dZhuan Xu walked out with Jin Xuan and saw the sky blanketed with soldiers. Suddenly a person broke through the defenses and stormed Zhi Jin Summit. White hair, white robe, standing tall and proud on the back of a white condor, completely untouched like the first snow, he was even more extraordinarily eye-catching with the dawn sun behind him.Zhuan Xu laughed \u201cWho knew it was an old friend.\u201dThe soldiers wanted to stop Xiang Liu but he used his power to transmit his voice directly to Zhuan Xu\u2019s ears only \u201cZhuan Xu, do you want Xiao Yao to live, or to die?\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s face changed, the information was sealed so unless Xiang Liu was the person who killed Xiao Yao, there would be no way for him to get the news this fast.Zhuan Xu was so enraged but he laughed \u201cLet him down.\u201dXiang Liu landed and walked up to Zhuan Xu but a row of guards kept them apart. Xiang Liu asked \u201cWhere is Xiao Yao?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t figure out Xiang Liu\u2019s motive. If he wanted anything, he would need to keep Xiao Yao alive rather than kill her. But the people who set up the cherry blossom maze wanted Xiao Yao dead.Xiang Liu was an exceptionally smart person and immediately realized Zhuan Xu reached the wrong a.s.sumption \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. Until yesterday afternoon I was in the mountains in Qing Shui Town and I just reached Sheng Nong Mountain just now.\u201dZhuan Xu believed him. If Xiang Liu wanted to lie he wouldn\u2019t do it so directly. Zhuan Xu was even more perplexed \u201cThen how do you know what happened to Xiao Yao?\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cIn Qing Shui Town, Wen Xiao Liu planted a voodoo bug on Xuan. To remove the bug, Xiao Liu transferred it into another person.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiang Liu and raised his hand \u201cEveryone leave.\u201dAll the guards left and Xiang Liu walked up to Zhuan Xu. He turned towards the court \u201cFollow me.\u201dXiang Liu saw Xiao Yao and walked over and sat down beside the water jade pallet, staring down at the silent and unmoving Xiao Yao.Zhuan Xu glanced at Xiao Xiao and she walked over to take over for the guard transferring power to Xiao Yao and that guard left the chamber.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cIs the voodoo bug in you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhuan Xu could understand Xiao Yao wanting to remove the bug from him and moving it to another. What he couldn\u2019t understand was why Xiang Liu agreed to let Xiao Yao move it into him.Xiang Liu coolly replied \u201cThat is between Xiao Yao and me.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cWhat are you here for? Why did you ask me if I wanted Xiao Yao alive or dead?\u201d\u201cIf you give her to me, I can save her.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean give her to you? Can\u2019t you save her here?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled wanly \u201cYou are the infamous Nine-lives Xiang Liu who has killed countless. If my brain hasn\u2019t addled, we\u2019re political enemies. Yet you want me to hand my little sister to you. How can I trust you?\u201cIf you don\u2019t give her to me, she\u2019ll die.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s personal Doctor Yin was taught by the best court doctors in Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing and he concluded Xiao Yao was dead. Xing Yue brought the best doctors in the Middle Plains and they concluded Xiao Yao could not be saved. Zhuan Xu believed that even when the best court doctors from Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing arrived, they would say the same as the first three doctors. Xiang Liu was the only one who was certain that Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t dead yet. Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t trust Xiang Liu, but he wouldn\u2019t miss the sole chance to save Xiao Yao. Zhuan Xu said \u201cYou let me consider it.\u201dXiang Liu calmly said \u201cShe\u2019s almost out of time.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for so many powerful people transferring power to Xiao Yao, even by the time Xiang Liu rushed here it would have been too late. It was by Zhuan Xu\u2019s seemingly pointless effort that he managed to secure a lone shred of chance for Xiao Yao.\u201cHow much time do you need? When can I see Xiao Yao again?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe a year or two, maybe tens of years.\u201dZhuan Xu paced in the chamber and his expression kept changing but finally he decided \u201cYou can take her!\u201d Zhuan Xu stared at Xiang Liu and coldly said \u201cIf you dare harm her, I will destroy the Sheng Nong resistance army and cut you into a million pieces!\u201dXiang Liu calmly and coolly replied \u201cEven if I don\u2019t harm her, you\u2019re still planning to destroy the Sheng Nong resistance army, and you\u2019re still planning to cut me into pieces.\u201d Once he was dead, what mattered how many pieces he was diced into.Zhuan Xu stared at Xiang Liu with an exasperated expression. He understood now why Xiao Yao was friends with him, that guy may be a b.a.s.t.a.r.d but he was an interesting b.a.s.t.a.r.d at that.Zhuan Xu sighed and calmly countered \u201cAs long as you know what I mean.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cGive me all your best medicines.\u201dZhuan Xu had Jin Xuan bring all the medicines on Zhi Jin Summit, and along with the medicines Xing Yue brought, handed it all over \u201cIs this enough? If not then I can get more from the Yellow Emperor, the Grand Emperor, or even the Royal Mother.\u201dXiang Liu glanced at the huge box and scoffed \u201cIt\u2019s enough. So this is why everyone wants power.\u201dXiang Liu turned and tenderly picked up Xiao Yao in his arms.Zhuan Xu made the decision but when he saw Xiang Liu taking Xiao Yao away his hands clenched into fists. He said to Xiao Xiao \u201cLead him out through the secret pa.s.sageway. I don\u2019t want my little sister\u2019s name to be a.s.sociated with this big demon. I still want her to marry into a good family one day!\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t appear to mind at all and merely smiled and followed Xiao Xiao into the secret pa.s.sageway with Xiao Yao in his arms.Zhuan Xu took out two magical wooden dolls and used his own blood to form two persons, one was Xiao Yao and the other was Xiang Liu. He said to Jin Xuan \u201cYou walk Xiang Liu out!\u201dJin Xuan walked that Xiang Liu out of the court chamber. Xiao Xiao returned moments later \u201cXiang Liu has been escorted off Sheng Nong Mountain but I put a few guards on his tail.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cNo use, he\u2019ll be able to shake them.\u201dJin Xuan returned \u201cYour highness, Master Jing is still in Zhi Jin Court. We have to tell Qing Qiu but with his current condition\u2026..this might affect your connections with the Tu Shan clan.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cXing Yue must have told Feng Long already and he should be here soon. When he gets here, he can take Jing back to Qing Qiu.\u201d________________________________Feng Long arrived on Sheng Nong Mountain in the middle of the night.Zhuan Xu knew the wooden doll version of Xiao Yao laying on the pallet couldn\u2019t fool Feng Long and he didn\u2019t intend to keep it from him. He told Feng Long everything, except for the part where the voodoo bug was in Xiang Liu. Feng Long of course couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t know that Xiao Yao knew Xiang Liu from before, but because Xiang Liu\u2019s actions were always unpredictable and he could do what most anyone in the world couldn\u2019t, Feng Long didn\u2019t try to dig into why Xiang Liu showed up and instead just a.n.a.lyzed what he might want out of helping Xiao Yao.When it came to Xiao Yao, Feng Long was more calm and collected than Zhuan Xu \u201cNo matter if Xiang Liu was telling the truth or not, if I were you I would have chosen to trust him. His way is the only sliver of hope left. I actually think he can save Xiao Yao, because only by saving Xiao Yao can he have a chance to negotiate a bargain with the Yellow Emperor or you.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled for the first time since yesterday \u201cI trust your judgment.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to tell me all this.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cSome matters are personal so I don\u2019t need to tell you. But some matters may have huge consequences, and since you are placing your life wagering on me, how can I not be truthful about matters like that.\u201dFeng Long countered \u201cYou\u2019ve wagered your life on me as well. If you stayed in Xuan Yuan Castle, you might still have succeeded. But you chose to come to the Middle Plains.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cBecause what I want isn\u2019t just power. What good is one kingdom?\u201dFeng Long added \u201cWhat good is one clan leader?\u201dZhuan Xu and Feng Long smiled at each other. Zhuan Xu said \u201cCome with me, I need you to see someone else.\u201dFeng Long saw the unconscious Jing and was stunned \u201cWhat happened?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI don\u2019t know, when I arrived in the canyon it was engulfed in flames. I wanted to rush in but Xiao Xiao knocked me out. When I woke up, she had rescued Xiao Yao. Let her explain!\u201dXiao Xiao said \u201cWe rushed into the maze to save the Princess. When we found her, Master Jing was protecting her. If it wasn\u2019t for Master Jing using his spiritual power to protect her body then her body would have been incinerated into ashes already. Because he kept transferring power into her, it kept a sliver of hope alive. You can say Master Jing was the real person who rescued her. But when we got there he was already unconscious and we brought them both back to Zhi Jin Summit. Master Jing\u2019s injuries are actually not severe but he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t want to live so that is why he\u2019s not waking up.\u201dFeng Long was thoroughly confused \u201cIsn\u2019t Jing in Qing Qiu? how did he end up in the cherry blossom canyon? I guess its not important since his arrival saved Xiao Yao. But why does he not want to live now? What happened?\u201d\u201cYou handle your task, as for the culprit\u2026.\u201d Zhuan Xu coldly huffed \u201cEven if I have to dig three feet into the ground I would unearth them all.\u201dFeng Long escorted Jing through the night to reach Qing Qiu. Feng Long lived in Qing Qiu when he was young for many years, growing up alongside Jing, and he was very familiar with the Grand Madam as well. Despite showing up in the middle of the night, he was warmly received and the Grand Madam was summoned.The Grand Madam was old so didn\u2019t sleep much and was up already but still laying in bed trying to figure out what happened yesterday to make Jing rush out. She was planning to send someone to find him if he wasn\u2019t back by sunrise.When she heard Feng Long was here, she asked the maid to bring him in.The maid awkwardly replied \u201cMaster Feng Long asked that you go see him.\u201dThe Grand Madam got dressed \u201cFeng Long isn\u2019t a rude young man, there must be a reason he asked this. We have to hurry.\u201dWhen she walked into Feng Long\u2019s room, she saw her grandson laying on the pallet and her body shook. Feng Leng quickly said \u201cHis injury isn\u2019t severe.\u201dThe Grand Madam calmed down and sat \u201cWhat happened?\u201dFeng Long explained about what happened to the Gao Xing Princess exactly as he heard from Xiao Xiao and left off only the part involving Xiang Liu. Feng Long said \u201cThe Princess is currently hovering near death and the culprit hasn\u2019t been found yet. All we know is that Jing saved the Princess but why Jing is choosing death and refuses to wake up is unclear. Prince Zhuan Xu asked me to bring Jing back and I also hope Jing will wake up now that he\u2019s home.\u201dThe Grand Madam had the doctor summoned and when the doctor checked Jing, he explaied \u201cMaster\u2019s injury is not dire. He\u2019s despondent and all his nerves have frozen up and his insides have suspended animation. This is a situation without any medicine to cure. We can only use spiritual medicines to keep his body alive and then slowly try to coax his spirit back to life.\u201dFeng Long comforted the Grand Madam \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know Jing very well. He may seem soft and gentle but his heart is very strong. He will be fine.\u201dThe Grand Madam said nothing and just stared at her grandson.Jing was missing for ten years and when he came back he refused to say what happened. He insisted on ending the engagement but the Grand Madam wouldn\u2019t agree and used a delay tactic to try and create situations to bring Jing and Yi Yang together. She thought if they spent time together, Yi Yang being so beautiful that Jing would slowly fall for her. Who knew that Jing directly told Yi Yang he wanted to end the engagement and neither she nor Yi Yang could talk him out of it. They even agreed Jing could take a concubine and even if Jing only loved that concubine and refused to sleep with Yi Yang, that was still fine. But Jing still insisted on ending the engagement. The Grand Madam could never understand why, but now she did. If the woman Jing loved was the Princess, then everything made sense.The Grand Madam was furious and anxious and wanted to smack Jing but the most important thing right now was to keep him alive. She thought and then said to the maid \u201cJing\u2019s illness must not be leaked.\u201dThe maid confirmed the information has been sealed. Feng Long said \u201cI was very careful coming here, no one knew I brought Jing along with me.\u201dThe Grand Madam said \u201cI have something to ask of you.\u201dFeng Long replied \u201cIf grandmother wants anything, Feng Long will do it, otherwise even my grandfather would beat me up.\u201d\u201cTake Jing to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and let him recuperate there. I will order Jing Ye and Hu Ya and the family doctor to go along as well to take care of him.\u201dFeng Long realized that the Grand Madam knew she was old and worried that someone within the Tu Shan residence would try to kill Jing and she couldn\u2019t protect him \u201cGrandmother need not worry. Little Zhu Rong residence is heavily guarded and after what happened, my sister will only tighten the security. I will also a.s.sign special guards to protect Jing.\u201dThe Grand Madam patted his hand \u201cGood, good!\u201d Her tears were about to fall, cousins were more like real brothers while real brothers wielded swords against each other.She added \u201cTo keep quiet, hurry up and leave with Jing before sunrise!\u201dFeng Long concurred \u201cI will. Grandmother please take care, I will have my sister send updates regularly.\u201dFeng Long brought Jing back to Zhi Yi and after Xing Yue heard what happened, she arranged for Jing to stay in his usual Evergreen Residence.Other than Jing Ye, Hu Ya, and the doctor, Xing Yue a.s.signed some powerful guards to secretly guard the residence. Feng Long also left some Chi Sui clan guards behind as well to protect Jing.Back in the Evergreen Residence, Jing Ye felt her master seemed calmer and perhaps the Grand Madam\u2019s decision to send him here ended up really saving his life.Except every time she remembered what the doctor said she grew frightened. What could have happened to lead to her master becoming so despondent and heartbroken that he wished for death?Jing Ye slowly figured out the reason and nightly prayed that the Gao Xing Princess who made her master start playing the zither again would not die. If the Princess died, then Jing Ye worried that her master would never wake up again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn all of Tong Hua\u2018s historical novels, she chooses to write about characters who often have epic ident.i.ties, but in doing so each is bound by responsibilities and ties that cannot be easily forsaken. What makes Lost You Forever interesting is that we get to sneak a peek at how these awesome characters like Xiao Yao, Jing, Xiang Liu, and Zhuan Xu would be like if they didn\u2019t have their burdens to shoulder. Their alter egos of Xiao Liu, s.h.i.+ Qi, Fang Feng Bei, and Xuan tease us with how wonderful their lives could be if they could love and live with abandon. Xiao Yao desperately wants that but she comes up against her own true ident.i.ty in a devastating way in the last chapter. Everyone\u2019s beloved Xiao Yao died, she really did die, and the only hope for her resurrection lays in the hands of Xiang Liu. Even if he manages to bring her back to life, going forward there is no longer any certainty that being a Princess with all the major backing of two Emperors can keep her safe. When Xiang Liu and Xiao Yao planted that pair of bugs in them, neither expected it would actually be so critical down the road. I love this chapter because it feels like a stolen time for Xiang Liu and Xiao Yao, a time they may never have together again. I\u2019m a sucker for the Xiang Liu-Xiang Yao unspoken romance even if I think Jing is by and large the more stable choice for her. But it\u2019s nice to have a demon warrior who tucks you away in his own private safe haven to save your life, yes?Chapter 22 \u2013 It Feels Like Such a Long Parting:The prison on Sheng Nong Mountain.The sconces were lit along all four walls casting the cell in a light as bright as day.Mu Fei was covered in blood and strung up in the air.The prison door opened and Zhuan Xu, Feng Long, and Xing Yue walked in. Xing Yue furrowed her brows and covered her nose with a handkerchief. Zhuan Xu said \u201cIf you\u2019re not comfortable you can stay outside.\u201dXing Yue shook her head.Feng Ling said \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything in front of her. Plus this concerns matters in the Middle Plains, she ought to hear it so she understands.\u201dA tall guard said to Zhuan Xu \u201cWe\u2019ve only used three tortures on him and his body has already broken down and cannot endure more. He is begging for death but still will not confess his cohorts.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cLet him down.\u201dThe guard let Mu Fei down and he opened his eyes and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cI killed your sister. Do what you want with me.\u201dFeng Long asked \u201cJust you alone? You give yourself too much credit.\u201dMu Fei laughed coldly and closed his eyes, indicating he had nothing more to say and they could kill him.Zhuan Xu kneeled down and said slowly \u201cBefore you guys took action, you must have been chosen to be sacrificed which is why anything that could be traced back was done by you. I think you were chosen not because you are all that smart or brave, but because even if the two Emperors fly into a rage, all they can kill is you alone since every one of your tribe members are all dead. You don\u2019t have a tribe left to exterminate completely for this.\u201dMu Fei opened his eyes and glared at Zhuan Xu with a look of superiority.Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cBut if the Mu family really has only you left, and you died, then the Mu bloodline really is ended. Years ago to save you from Qi Yo\u2019s wrath, countless people in your family must have died to protect you. I believe that even if you are all that reckless and want to do something big, you would not dare to do anything that would end the Mu family bloodline. So if I\u2019m not wrong, you already have a son out there.\u201dMu Fei\u2019s expression changed and Zhuan Xu\u2019s smile disappeared and all that was left was icy rage \u201cYou can choose to die but I will find your son and send him to reunite with the entire Mu family in the afterlife.\u201dMu Fei clamped his teeth shut and said nothing.Zhuan Xu called out \u201cXiao Xiao.\u201dXiao Xiao walked in \u201cWe have already collected the names of all the women who have had any contact with Mu Fei in the last hundred years. Only two women are likely, one is the daughter of Mu Fei\u2019s nurse, she loves him a lot but married another man fifteen years ago and has a son. The other is the Tan family maid, when Mu Fei lived with his Tan relatives in their home, the maid worked there. She was kicked out of the family twenty some years ago for being with a man and now is missing.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cKeep investigating and find that maid. If she was with a man, she could have bore him a son.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Xiao turned and walked out.Mu Fei\u2019s body betrayed his spirit and he was trembling, but still he said nothing and only stared at Zhuan Xu with rage and desperation.Zhuan Xu said \u201cYou hurt my sister and I will definitely kill you. But if you tell me one thing I won\u2019t touch your son.\u201dMu Fei closed his eyes indicating he wasn\u2019t going to talk to Zhuan Xu, but his hands continued to shake.Zhuan Xu said \u201cYou don\u2019t want to betray your cohorts, I can understand that. I am not asking for their names, I just want to know why you want to kill Xiao Yao. If you tell me why, I won\u2019t kill your son.\u201dZhuan Xu stood up \u201cThink about it. Don\u2019t attempt suicide otherwise I will save all the torture for your son.\u201dZhuan Xu said to Feng Long and Xing Yue \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAfter they walked out, Xing Yue asked \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use his son\u2019s life to ask for the names of his cohorts?\u201dFeng Long answered \u201cTo give his cohorts up, that is a betrayal and requires a lot longer for him to work through it in his mind. But Zhuan Xu asked why he wanted to kill Xiao Yao, that is not really a betrayal and won\u2019t require too much inner struggle. Tonight we\u2019ll have the guards bring some babies in and let their cries sound all over the cell. By morning he\u2019ll be ready to talk. Once we know why he wanted to kill Xiao Yao, it won\u2019t be hard to find his cohorts.\u201d______________________There is no measure of time in a prison cell so time appeared to pa.s.s extra slowly and was harder to endure. Mu Fei couldn\u2019t endure through the first night and hollered loudly that he wanted to see Zhuan Xu and also wanted Feng Long present.Both men walked into the cell and Mu Fei said \u201cI can tell you why I killed your sister, but I want your word that you will not harm my son.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIf you tell me the truth, I won\u2019t harm him.\u201dMu Fei stared at Feng Long \u201cHe is from the Xuan Yuan tribe and I don\u2019t trust him. I want your promise, and to say it to me directly, that no one will harm my son.\u201dFeng Long smiled at Mu Fei \u201cIf you tell Zhuan Xu the truth, I promise no one will use what you did to harm your son. But if your son grows up and gets into his own trouble, forget Zhuan Xu, I will deal with him myself!\u201dMu Fei was taken aback \u201cGrow up?\u201d He appeared to imagine his son grown and then smiled \u201cHe\u2019s not like me, he will be a good person, but I won\u2019t be able to see it\u2026..\u201dBecause of what Feng Long said, Mu Fei\u2019s intensity faded and he said \u201cPerhaps you hate me for causing such a calamity for the G.o.ds clans of the Middle Plains, but I had to kill her. If it was you, you would have done the same as me. Because she\u2019s not the Gao Xing Princess, she is Qi Yo\u2019s daughter.\u201dFeng Long shouted \u201cImpossible!\u201dMu Fei laughed bitterly \u201cI remember that devil\u2019s eyes, I can\u2019t be mistaken. Since I saw the fake Princess, I\u2019ve been enraged and furious but still went to investigate to confirm. The fake Princess\u2019s own uncle confirmed that she was the daughter of Qi Yo. He said that years ago Xuan Yuan\u2019s ninth prince was killed by the Xuan Yuan princess because he discovered her illicit love affair with Qi Yo.\u201dZhuan Xu coldly huffed \u201cA load of nonsense! My Auntie did kill my Ninth Uncle, but that wasn\u2019t because of some affair coming to light. It was\u2026.\u201d Zhuan Xu paused \u201cIt was because my Mom wanted to kill my Ninth Uncle and inadvertently killed my Ninth Uncle\u2019s mom Consort Tong Yu who was my Grandfather\u2019s third wife. My Mom knew my Ninth Uncle would kill me in vengeance so she begged my Auntie to protect me before she committed suicide. My Auntie agreed to protect me, and to do so she killed my Ninth Uncle.\u201dThe word given to the outside world was that Zhuan Xu\u2019s mom was injured in battle and died. But to know she committed suicide\u2026..such was the secret annals of the royal family and it was the first time Feng Long and Mu Fei had ever even heard this. But Mu Fei knew Zhuan Xu was telling the truth.Feng Long added to Mu Fei \u201cYou have never met the Grand Emperor so you don\u2019t know how brilliant and ruthless he is. But you do know that when the Gao Xing Five Princes revolted, it was the Grand Emperor who personally cut down his five younger brothers, and even killed all their wives, sons, and daughters. Do you think such a ruler would not know what your investigation uncovered? If he had even a sliver of doubt about Xiao Yao\u2019s parentage, why would he hold such a lavish ceremony for her? That was a proclamation to the entire vast wilderness that he loved Xiao Yao!\u201dMu Fei was confused, did he really kill the wrong person? No, no! He could not have mistaken that set of eyes. Mu Fei said \u201cI\u2019m not mistaken, I\u2019m not mistaken\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu coldly said \u201cEven if you know you are wrong it\u2019s too late! You hurt Xiao Yao, you will pay with your life!\u201dZhuan Xu turned and left the cell and Feng Long followed,Zhuan Xu stood expressionless at the edge of the cliff. Despite telling Mu Fei it was impossible, but did he really not doubt either? This wasn\u2019t the first time he heard that Xiao Yao was Qi Yo\u2019s daughter. Zhuan Xu really understood now why Xiao Yao was frightened. The first few times it could be brushed off as a joke\u2026..but the more and more it was repeated\u2026..Zhuan Xu dug through his own memories for his Auntie and Qi Yo\u2026.Feng Long stood silently behind Zhuan Xu and let him think for a long time. Zhuan Xu then said \u201cMany families were exterminated by Qi Yo but there aren\u2019t a lot of orphans left. Such persons will also need to be close to Mu Fei so they can trust each other to plan this matter. The other two must have powers in wood and water, plus I think a girl is involved. Only with a girl\u2019s involvement can Xiao Yao be separated from Xing Yue at just the right time and also split her up from the guard I a.s.signed. I think you probably have an idea already of who did it.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cTomorrow night you come to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and Xing Yue and I will have an answer for you.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cWhat Mu Fei just said, I hope only you and I know. Not just because this involves my Auntie and the Grand Emperor\u2019s reputations, but because my two uncles actually tried to use the G.o.d tribes of the Middle Plains to kill Xiao Yao.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cI understand.\u201d What happened to Xiao Yao could be handled discreetly or blown up. If not handled well, the entire Middle Plains could erupt.Zhuan Xu said \u201cI was the only who placed Xiao Yao in a visible spot to attract the attention of all my enemies. My enemies see her as my greatest help, so when sending her to stay at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence, they think I am trying to curry favor with you. If they think I am eager to win you over to my side, then they won\u2019t even suspect you\u2019re already on my side. This happened because I put Xiao Yao in a position of danger. Feng Long, Xiao Yao actually knew all along that I was using her.\u201dFeng Long patted Zhuan Xu\u2019s shoulder \u201cXiao Yao will be fine.\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cAll my hope is on Xiang Liu now.\u201dIn the middle of the night, Zhuan Xu snuck into Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence through the secret pa.s.sageway. Feng Long and Xing Yue was waiting for him. Feng Long nodded and Xing Yue explained.\u201cAfter Gege\u2019s investigation, we confirmed four people were involved in hurting Xiao Yao. Other than the Mu family\u2019s Mu Fei, there are the Shen family, Tan family, and Zin family orphans \u2013 Shen Dong, Tan Xue Ling, and Zin Yue Jian.Zhuan Xu said \u201cThat is good to know, thank you.\u201dXing Yue added \u201cXue Ling is the fiancee of the Gong family eldest son, they grew up together and in three months will be getting married. Yue Jian and the Cheng family little daughter have been engaged since childhood. Both the Gong family and the Cheng family are part of the Middle Plains Six Major Families.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xing Yue and casually asked \u201cWhat do you mean by sharing this?\u201dXing Yue\u2019s heart skipped a beat and she murmured \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026.just wanted to suggest you reconsider.\u201dFeng Long clapped his sister on the back and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cI think the same way. You need people on your side and if you kill them, you will be feuding with two of the Middle Plains big families. It\u2019s not worth it! To achieve big goals, you have to know what you can afford to do. Xiao Yao is already hurt, but if you kill them that can\u2019t change things and is only to relieve your anger. It\u2019s pointless! If you forgive them, you will get more help to build your empire.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent for some time and then said \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dBoth Feng Long and Xing Yue smiled in relief.Zhuan Xu smiled and said \u201cI want to tell you guys a story about my childhood. I was very young then when my parents went to war, the war involving your grandfather. I stayed with my Grandmother and one day my Auntie brought my unconscious Mom back. Auntie kneeled before my Grandmother and kept bowing her head on the ground because she didn\u2019t bring my Dad home. My Dad died in battle! My Grandmother asked my Auntie what happened and my Auntie wanted me to leave the room but my Grandmother had me stay. She said from now on, I was the only man in the family. My Auntie said things I only understood parts of, but I understood that my Dad didn\u2019t need to die but my Ninth Uncle caused his death. But my Grandfather took my Ninth Uncle\u2019s side. I watched my Grandmother, my Mom, and my Auntie hold each other and cry.\u201dZhuan Xu stared directly at Feng Long and Xing Yue \u201cYou have never experienced the pain of losing a loved one, so you can\u2019t imagine the pain of those three women at that moment. Those three women were the strongest bravest women I had ever known in this world, but in that moment they were three heartbroken desolate inconsolable people. In that moment I vowed that I will one day be strong, be powerful, be greater than even the Yellow Emperor, just so I could protect them. I never ever wanted them to experience and endure heartbreaking sobbing. But before I could grow up, my Mom killed herself, my Grandmother died of a broken heart, and my Auntie died in battle. I could not protect any of them. They still died all alone and without any protection.\u201dZhuan Xu suddenly stopped talking though he still smiled and sat there without moving. Feng Long and Xing Yue didn\u2019t dare say a single word.After a moment Zhuan Xu continued \u201cI wanted to grow up as quickly as possible solely to protect them. I wanted to stand in a position greater than my grandfather solely for them. I\u2019m grown now but not yet powerful. But I will never ever allow anyone to harm my loved ones. Today if I give up punis.h.i.+ng those who hurt Xiao Yao so that I can grab power, then I am betraying the me who stood on Cao Yun Peak that day. If I betray my own vow, then I will never be able to remember the happy and sad moments of my past with a clear conscience.\u201dZhuan Xu said to Feng Long \u201cYou are right that there is a time and place for everything. But one should never betray one\u2019s own self for any reason. I hope one day when I am standing at the top of the summit facing the entire world that I have united, I can remember the past with a clear heart. I don\u2019t want to be like my grandfather, he rules the world but has locked himself up in Cao Yun Court.\u201dFeng Long stared at Zhuan Xu and Zhuan Xu turned to Xing Yue \u201cYou want me to give up now, but haven\u2019t you thought that if today I can give up protecting Xiao Yao for a reason, then one day I can also give up protecting you for another reason.\u201dXing Yue was dumbstruck and could say nothing.Zhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019m not a good person, and I\u2019m not a good husband for any woman. But I will never ever not protect the women in my life! Whether it\u2019s you, Xiao Xiao, Jin Xuan, if anyone hurts any of you, I will never let that person get away with it!\u201dXing Yue smiled and there were tears in her eyes.Zhuan Xu said \u201cUnder most circ.u.mstances I\u2019m someone who aims for the greatest advantage and uses any tactic, but in the few instances like this, I would rather take the harder road and feud with the Gong and Cheng families then not punish these two. I am eschewing the wider easier path for the narrow th.o.r.n.y path, but what of it? The most is that I\u2019ll have to work harder.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cFine! I\u2019ll walk the th.o.r.n.y road with you!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI believe that one day the Gong and Cheng families will decide that it\u2019s still better to follow me.\u201dFeng Long smacked him \u201cYour crazy self-confidence! But\u2026..\u201d He grabbed Zhuan Xu by the shoulders \u201cYou are definitely the guy I picked!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s face turned and he pushed Feng Long off \u201cI don\u2019t have those tastes, dude.\u201dXing Yue laughed and then rushed outside while wiping her tears away \u201cWho has time for you two crazy guys!\u201dFeng Long saw the door to the hidden room was securely closed before asking in a low voice \u201cDo you like my sister\u2019s ident.i.ty more, or her person more?\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cThen do you like Xiao Yao\u2019s person more or her ident.i.ty more?\u201dFeng Long chuckled.Zhuan Xu said \u201cEven though I\u2019ve decided to kill them, but the method is critically important. If the method is correct, then even if the Gong and Cheng families are upset, at least it might lessen the degree of anger.\u201dFeng Long burst out laughing \u201cYou just said all that and upset my sister making her all worried, but you never intended to walk the th.o.r.n.y road.\u201dZhuan Xu stared back \u201cDon\u2019t let me question my ability to pick a person.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cHow do you want to kill them?\u201d\u201cIf I hand them all to my grandfather, some people might make the connection and reach their own conclusion that will harm Xiao Yao. So I need you and Xing Yue to keep this news from spreading. Let your dad hand Mu Fei to my grandfather. The other three I will handle myself. This way it also won\u2019t alert my uncles.\u201d\u201cHow do you plan to handle it?\u201d\u201cThere are countless ways to deal with Tan Xue Ling, but seeing that she\u2019s a woman, I don\u2019t want to be overly cruel so give her a quick and fast death! But Zin Yue Jian, I will destroy his reputation first so the Cheng family ends the engagement, and after he is left with nothing then I will kill him. Shen Dong I will hand him off to my subordinates and see how many vicious tortures he can endure.\u201dFeng Long actually admired Zhuan Xu\u2019s method of handling this but still gave him some lip \u201cNo wonder all the women like you, you definitely let them off the hook easy.\u201dZhuan Xu stood up \u201cI need to hurry back now.\u201d After he got to the door he paused \u201cHow is Jing?\u201dFeng Long sighed and shook his head \u201cHe\u2019s being kept alive by the spiritual medicines, but in the long run this can\u2019t last.\u201d Feng Long hesitated and then asked \u201cDo you know why he\u2019s so despondent as to want to die?\u201dZhuan Xu replied \u201cWait until he wakes up and you can ask him.\u201dZhuan Xu opened the door to the hidden room and left with his guards.Many days later, the world found out about the Gao Xing Princess being attacked and gravely injured.Little Zhu Rong captured the culprit who was Mu Fei of the Mu family. Because he was the last of the bloodline, many of the prominent families in the Middle Plains gathered together to beg for leniency for him. Cut off an arm or a nose, anything was fine as long as the Yellow Emperor preserved the final bit of Mu family bloodline.The Yellow Emperor ordered Mu Fei to be cut into thousands of pieces and his remains tossed into the wilderness. He then harshly rebuked all the families who pleaded for leniency for him and even ordered clan leaders changed.The Grand Emperor sent an envoy to the Middle Plains to have a banquet for all the major clans and families. An announcement was publicly made that Gao Xing would no longer welcome the children and disciples of these families to enter Gao Xing. From ancient times until now, Gao Xing always controlled the most precise and powerful weapons forging techniques in the world. All the G.o.d families would send their children and disciples to Gao Xing to find the best weapons makers to forge their own weapon. By doing this, the Grand Emperor was publicly stripping these Middle Plains clans and families of their combat ability going forwardEveryone in the Middle Plains was frantic and feared an imminent crisis. Thankfully Little Zhu Rong was there to calm the ma.s.ses and this matter slowly settled down leaving everyone praying the Gao Xing Princess would quickly recover so the Grand Emperor\u2019s rage could be extinguished._____________________Xiao Yao felt that the last thing she saw before she died was a thick wall of cherry blossoms flying towards her. It wasn\u2019t scary and instead was so beaut.i.tful!Such dazzling cherry blossoms wrapped around her body like a cloud and after the sudden sharp pain, as the blood from her body quickly seeped out, everything turned numb.She could vividly sense her heart slowly weakening, but just as it was about to stop, she heard another heart beating. It was strong and powerful, leading her heart so that it wouldn\u2019t completely stop. It was like a sole flame in the palms of the hand, seemingly about to be extinguished at any moment, but still flickering weakly with life.Xiao Yao felt that she heard Xiang Liu snarking at her: Just this and you\u2019re going to give up?Xiao Yao retorted back at him: What do you mean just this? If you\u2019ve been poked so many holes in like a sieve, air pa.s.sing through both top and bottom, even if I don\u2019t want to give up I have to give up.She really had no strength left, so that even the weak sole flame that was keeping her heart beating was too much to sustain. Even with another heart guiding her heart, still the heartbeat grew weaker.Suddenly power coursed through her, unending streams of power that allowed the weak heartbeat to continue beating.She couldn\u2019t hear it, couldn\u2019t see it, couldn\u2019t even feel it, but she felt sad because the spiritual power was so sad and devastated. Even the power was crying and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t even imagine how heartbroken the owner of the spiritual power was.Xiao Yao wanted to see who was so sad but didn\u2019t have the strength. She could only follow the guidance of the other heart and slowly locked herself up. Just like a flower blooming, the reverse process was to return to being a bud, into a seed, back into the soil, laying in the Winter to wait for the Spring to arrive.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t hear, couldn\u2019t see, couldn\u2019t feel, but she still felt unbearable.It was like sleeping, except in real sleep one couldn\u2019t feel the pa.s.sing of time, but when one\u2019s body was sleeping but the conscious wasn\u2019t, then it was like being locked up in a coffin and buried into the ground. Conscious sleeping was so unbearable!In the pitch black darkness, time had no beginning and no end, and everything became forever.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know how long she had been in the darkness, and she didn\u2019t know how much longer she needed to be there. She was trapped in forever, and Xiao Yao realized for the first time how scary forever was. Just like eating duck neck was a really enjoyable thing to do, but if eating duck neck became something she did forever without an end, then it\u2019s not enjoyable at all and would instead be a truly scary torture.In the unending darkness, Xiao Yao felt like a hundred years had pa.s.sed. If her conscious could commit suicide, she would have killed herself. But she could do nothing other than stay like this forever. She started to hate the person who saved her.One day Xiao Yao suddenly felt something, like a little bit of warmth entered her body from the outside. It slowly took away the icy cold and Xiao Yao greedily clung onto that warmth.Every so often the warmth would flow into her. Even though the waiting was long, but the warmth always came so even the long wait wasn\u2019t scary anymore.The warmth entered her time and time again. She didn\u2019t know how much time pa.s.sed but her heart gradually got stronger. It was like the flickering sole flame had a cover placed over it, so even if the light wasn\u2019t as bright at least the flame was no longer in danger of being extinguished.One time as the warmth entered her, Xiao Yao felt another heart beating. Her heart soared as if she was encountering an old friend.Xiao Yao wanted to laugh: Xiang Liu, is it you? I\u2019ve healed you that many times, now it\u2019s finally your turn to repay me.Time and time again, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know how much time pa.s.sed but she felt time was so slow!In the unending darkness, every time Xiang Liu came to heal her became the only time she felt like she was still alive, because she felt another heart beating.Not sure how much time pa.s.sed but one day when the warmth was entering her body, Xiao Yao suddenly felt a sensation, she felt someone was embracing her.It was strange, she couldn\u2019t hear or see, and couldn\u2019t even feel her own body, but perhaps because of the voodoo bug within and their two hearts were as one, she could vaguely sense his movements.He seemed to be tenderly caressing her cheek, and then he fell asleep and didn\u2019t move beside her. Xiao Yao was sleepy and fell asleep too.When Xiao Yao woke up, Xiang Liu was no longer thereXiao Yao didn\u2019t know how long she waited, perhaps just a few hours, but when she felt Xiang Liu again it was like he was coming home. He first touched her forehead and greeted her, and then later he laid down next to her.He fell asleep again so Xiao Yao fell asleep again.Because of Xiang Liu\u2019s daily coming and going, Xiao Yao no longer felt frightened. Because it was no longer unending forever, she could sense time pa.s.sing through him and could feel the changes.Every twenty or thirty days Xiang Liu would heal her. When he was healing her, they ought to be very intimate because Xiao Yao could feel he was tightly embracing her. She could feel him from top to bottom. But during normal days Xiang Liu wouldn\u2019t hold her, at most he could caress her forehead and cheeks.More time pa.s.sed and Xiao Yao guessed it was many years because Xiang Liu healed her so many times she lost count.Gradually Xiao Yao felt more and more alert. When Xiang Liu was embracing her, she could feel his body heat, and could also clearly feel what the warmth was that was flowing into her body. It was Xiang Liu\u2019s blood, and it was different than normal blood. It was scalding hot, and every drop felt like a little flame. Xiao Yao guessed it was Xiang Liu\u2019s essential soul blood.Xiang Liu fed her his essential soul blood, but because he was poisonous all over, even his blood was poisonous, so he needed to suck the poison out of Xiao Yao afterwards.Xiao Yao heard of a voodoo spell where a person could use their life in exchange for another. If Xiang Liu used his life to save hers, she hoped that he really had nine-lives because then if he gave her one it wouldn\u2019t be too detrimental for him.One day Xiao Yao suddenly heard a noise. It was a dull soft thud. She anxiously wanted to confirm she could hear now but Xiang Liu was such a silent person that for the entire night he made no noise.Xiao Yao was so furious she couldn\u2019t even sleep, hollering inside but it was no use. The person next to her lay there quietly without even the sound of breathing.In the morning he left and there was the sound of the dull soft thud as if something was closing slowly. Xiao Yao felt that she would really hear now, but also wondering if she was so desperate she imagined it.Xiao Yao strained to stay awake so that she could hear more noise but Xiang Liu was gone so it was dead silence everywhere with no sound.That night there was the same sound again and then Xiang Liu returned to her side. He stroked her forehead and then held her hand. Xiao Yao desperately felt that she really could hear and the sound must be a door opening. Yet Xiao Yao didn\u2019t feel like she was laying in a room.In the beginning when she couldn\u2019t hear any sound it felt horrible, but later when she discovered that she could hear again, Xiao Yao desperately wanted to hear any sound, especially the sound of people talking. She wanted to hear someone saying her name to prove that she was still alive. But Xiang Liu didn\u2019t say a single world.The entire night he said not a word.At dawn Xiang Liu left again.This went on for many days and Xiang Liu didn\u2019t say something. Xiao Yao was furious and angrily cursed! It couldn\u2019t have been that so much happened during the years that Xiang Liu turned into a mute?The monthly healing day arrived again.Xiang Liu saved Xiao Yao by feeding her his essential soul blood and then used his powers to push life through all her vital organs. Then he bit down on Xiao Yao\u2019s neck and sucked the poison out from his own blood that was now in her body.When the healing was done, Xiang Liu didn\u2019t immediately put Xiao Yao down and instead continued to cuddle her in his arms.After some time, he gently placed her down and stroked Xiao Yao\u2019s face \u201cXiao Yao, I hope that when you wake up, you won\u2019t hate me.\u201dXiao Yao yelled in her heart: I won\u2019t hate you, I won\u2019t hate you, I promise I won\u2019t hate you as long as you talk more to me.But Xiang Liu grew silent again.Xiao Yao angrily raged inside: I hate you, I hate you! Even if you saved me, I\u2019ll still hate you!Xiao Yao wanted to hear sound but she heard nothing. She couldn\u2019t sleep well at night and was moodily angry during, she was totally in a bad mood all the time.When Xiang Liu came back, he went to check on Xiao Yao\u2019s body and sensed that Xiao Yao was still not stirring and appeared the same as always, but there was this aura around her brows that was different.Xiang Liu suddenly remembered how Xiao Yao used to be, so sneaky and clever but always so scared of being alone. He said to Xiao Yao \u201cAre you bored from laying under the ocean for so long?\u201dXiao Yao was stunned: I\u2019m in the ocean? I\u2019m actually in the bottom of the ocean? No wonder she always felt like she was floating in the middle of a cloud.Xiang Liu said \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the surface to look at the moon!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart soared: Yes, yes!Xiang Liu held Xiao Yao in his arms and swam upward like two entwined fishes.They reached the surface and Xiao Yao felt the waves undulating and the sea breeze flowing over her. She could hear the waves and hear the wind. Xiao Yao was so touched she wanted to cry.Xiang Liu said \u201cTonight is a crescent moon like a bow. Every full moon I have to heal you so I can\u2019t bring you to the surface. Actually, I haven\u2019t seen a full moon in many years now.\u201dXiao Yao thought that her a.s.sumption was right, he really was healing her once a month. The demon\u2019s powers are the strongest during the full moon which is why Xiang Liu chose that time to heal her.Xiang Liu stopped talking and silently held Xiao Yao in his arms. As the waves rose and fell, the crescent moon in the sky quietly shone on them.Xiao Yao restfully fell asleep.Xiang Liu lowered his eyes to look at her and smiled.From that day on, every few days Xiang Liu would take Xiao Yao out to play. Sometimes it was on the ocean surface, sometimes it was under the sea. Xiang Liu continued to have very little to say but he would still talk here and there. Perhaps because Xiao Yao had no movement or expression or reaction, so he said whatever he felt like and chatted about whatever came to mind.\u201dIt was almost a full moon again and the clouds swirling around the nearly round moon looked like the moon had a lace edge. Xiang Liu said \u201cTonight\u2019s moon looks like your mystical gorilla mirror. The memories you secretly saved in that mirror\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao was frozen in fear inside.Xiang Liu was silent for some time and then coolly said \u201cAfter you wake up, you have to erase it.\u201dXiao Yao let out an inner sigh: As long as you don\u2019t get mad, I\u2019ll even destroy the mirror if you want!One time they encountered a tornado in the middle of the ocean that looked just like the tornado on land but even scarier.Xiang Liu said \u201cWhen I escaped from the slave death match arena, I was gravely injured all over. I almost died in an ocean tornado but it was my adoptive father who saved me. Back then, the Flame Emperor was still alive and the Sheng Nong Kingdom hadn\u2019t yet been toppled. My adoptive father, along with Qi Yo and Zhu Rong, were the three greatest generals of the Sheng Nong Kingdom. He saved a runaway slave like me and I injured him. He didn\u2019t mind because he saw I was gravely injured and might not survive. He taught me a method for healing through training my powers. He even wanted to take me to the Flame Emperor for medical treatment. But I didn\u2019t trust him so I ran away.\u201dXiao Yao wanted to hear more about Xiang Liu\u2019s past with General Gong Gong but Xiang Liu didn\u2019t continue and instead took Xiao Yao safely away from the ocean tornado.A long time later, one night Xiang Liu took her to the surface and Xiao Yao felt little bits of icy cold hit her face. Xiang Liu softly brushed away the snow on Xiao Yao\u2019s face \u201cIt\u2019s snowing. Where is the most beautiful snowfall you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201dXiao Yao thought and said inside: The North Pole where it\u2019s millions of years of ice and cold gathered into the most dangerous yet most beautiful place!Large snowflakes the size of goose feathers floated down and landed on Xiang Liu\u2019s body.Xiang Liu said \u201cThe snowfall in the North Pole is the most beautiful I\u2019ve ever seen. To avoid my attackers, I escaped to the North Pole and hid there for over a hundred years. The snow there not only saved my life, it awakened an understanding in me and I transformed the healing technique my adoptive father taught me to learning a new powerful fighting style.\u201dXiao Yao thought: No wonder each time seeing Xiang Liu fighting it was as beautiful as snowflakes dancing!Xiang Liu smiled \u201cPeople think it\u2019s just a weird quirk that I wear white all the time. But it\u2019s actually just a habit gleaned from survival. In the North Pole, white is the color that is best for concealment.\u201dXiang Liu stopped talking and Xiao Yao was so anxious inside. She thought that he must\u2019ve decided to leave the North Pole after meeting Fang Feng Bei there. But by then the Sheng Nong Kingdom had fallen and General Gong Gong was leading a paltry resistance army with all his family and friends abandoning him. Yet a certain Nine-headed demon actually willingly went to him, perhaps initially it was to repay a debt, but then Gong Gong truly bonded with him so adopted him as a son. One could repay a debt, but the bonds of love and affection are impossible to ever fully repay.When she thought to here, Xiao Yao actually hated Gong Gong a little, but she felt her hatred really made no sense. So she just pouted and was angry at herself for being angry.Xiang Liu caressed her brows \u201cAre you unhappy? You don\u2019t like the snow? Then I\u2019ll take you to play in the ocean.\u201dXiang Liu descended into the ocean depths with Xiao Yao.Who knows how many more years pa.s.sed and Xiao Yao gradually felt her own legs. She tried to wiggle her toes and it wasn\u2019t clear if it moved. She couldn\u2019t ask Xiang Liu to check for her. But regardless of whether it moved or not, she felt that her body was close to awakening.One day Xiang Liu came back but instead of his usual touching her forehead and cheeks, he instead quietly stared at her. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t figure out what he was thinking, but she knew he was deciding something.Xiang Liu picked up Xiao Yao \u201cTonight is a full moon. I\u2019ll take you out to play!\u201dXiao Yao was confused, wasn\u2019t full moon a night for healing?\u201dXiang Liu took her all over to stroll around, sometimes leisurely swimming in the ocean, other times heading up to the surface to rise and fall with the waves.Tonight was different than usual in that he talked a lot. Every time they got to a place he would start talking.\u201cHere is a seaweed the size of your pallet in Qing Shui Town. If you like it, in the future you can use it to make a pallet.\u201d\u201cA monster fish, and his fish inside is even better than the fish amethyst you wear. But from now on you won\u2019t need this stuff anymore.\u201dA strange sound reached them from within the water, it wasn\u2019t the sound of musical instruments or the sound of people singing. But it was even more alluring than musical instruments, and even more pure and soulful than people singing. It was so beautiful as to defy description, it was the most beautiful sound Xiao Yao had ever heard in her life.Xiang Liu said \u201cIt\u2019s mating season for the merpeople. This is the sound of their mating song and is purportedly the most beautiful sound in the world. The humans and the G.o.ds cannot ever heard it. Perhaps after you awaken you will be able to hear it.\u201dXiang Liu took Xiao Yao out for a long time and they didn\u2019t return until late into the night.\u201cXiao Yao, do you remember Tu Shan Jing? Wen Xiao Liu\u2019s Ye s.h.i.+ Qi? Since you\u2019ve been sleeping, he\u2019s also been unconscious. His life has been maintained by spiritual medicines until now but it\u2019s almost at the limit. He\u2019s at the brink of death.\u201dJing, Jing\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao didn\u2019t feel sad when she died, life has its beginning so it must have an end. It didn\u2019t start happy and need not end sad. But right now she was very sad, she didn\u2019t want Jing to die.Xiao Yao tried to move.Xiang Liu asked \u201cIf he died, will you be really sad and hated me to the core?\u201dXiao Yao answered in her heart: I don\u2019t want Jing to die, but I also won\u2019t hate you.Xiang Liu said \u201cTonight I\u2019m waking you up.\u201dXiang Liu fed his essential soul blood to Xiao Yao, and different than before where it felt like warm flames that chased away the coldness of death in Xiao Yao\u2019s body, tonight his essential soul blood was a raging inferno that scorched Xiao Yao. It was colliding in her body and appeared to rip her insides to shreds before slowly bonding it back together.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t cry out but her body violently shook. Gradually her hands could move, her legs could move, and then she painfully cried out as all the soul essence entered her body and she pa.s.sed out in the midst of unbearable pain.When Xiao Yao woke up, she felt the warm sun on her body and she subconsciously turned over to keep on sleeping. Suddenly she opened her eyes in disbelief. She laid there in a daze and then slowly raised her hand up.Oh! She really could move!\u201cXiang Liu!\u201d Xiao Yao sat up but then her head b.u.mped into something hard and she saw stars.No one answered her and she saw a sliver of sunlight trickling in from outside. Xiao Yao felt that she was inside some sort of sh.e.l.l and she used her hands to feel the surface above her head and her sides. The sides slowly opened like flower petals until instantly Xiao Yao was bathed in sunlight.Only someone trapped by darkness before would understand that sunlight was the world\u2019s most ordinary yet precious treasure! The sunlight stung her eyes but she was reluctantly to close her eyes. She faced the sunlight and slowly stood up and let out a happy holler.After she calmed down, Xiao Yao noticed that she was wearing a loose fitting white robe and was standing on a large open clam sh.e.l.l. She was surrounded by endless ocean and the waves crested against the clam sh.e.l.l and sprayed up white foam.All these years, Xiang Liu placed her in the middle of a clam sh.e.l.l to sleep in the ocean. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t contain her smile, didn\u2019t that make her like a pearl hidden inside a clam sh.e.l.l?Xiao Yao put her hands around her mouth and yelled \u201cXiang Liu, Xiang Liu. Where are you? I\u2019m awake.\u201dA white and gold condor descended but without Xiang Liu on his back.Xiao Yao stroked its back \u201cFurball, where is your master?\u201dFurbal flapped his wings and called towards the sky once, as if urging Xiao Yao to get on his back.Xiao Yao happily asked \u201cXiang Liu asked you to bring me to see him?Furball shook his head.Xiao Yao quizzically asked \u201cXiang Liu asked you to take me home?\u201dFurball nodded his head.Whether Xiang Liu had matters to attend to or he was purposely avoiding seeing her, Xiao Yao stood there in a dumbstruck daze, the initial happiness of regaining life and light disappearing like receding waves.Furball pecked Xiao Yao\u2019s hand to urge her to hurry up.Xiao Yao climbed on Furball\u2019s back and it rose into the air and flew towards the Middle Plains.Xiao Yao stared at the pa.s.sing ocean surface as it rushed past her like a shooting arrow, disappearing behind her. The feelings in her heart were so jumbled.The next morning, Furball landed outside Zhi Yi Castle and Xiao Yao knew many people would recognize Xiang Liu\u2019s winged ride and knew Furball could only take her as far as here.For whatever reason, Xiao Yao\u2019s heart was filled with an endless ache. She suddenly grabbed Furball\u2019s neck tightly and Furball squirmed in annoyance but didn\u2019t really put up a fuss. It c.o.c.ked its head and endured with a sigh.Xiao Yao buried her face in Furball\u2019s neck as her tears came tumbling down, one after another, falling silently on Furball\u2019s feathers and disappearing.Furball finally got fed up and impatiently called out once.Xiao Yao raised her head and the tears were gone from her eyes. She slid off Furball\u2019s back and patted him \u201cGo back to your master!\u201dFurball ran a few steps and then flew into the air. Xiao Yao raised her head to watch it fly away until it was completely gone from her sight.___________________________Xiao Yao entered Zhi Yi Castle and saw it bustling with people on the street even more than before and felt relieved. She called for a carriage and hearing people speak made it feel warm and personable.The carriage arrived at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and Xiao Yao got off. The two servants at the front door were new faces and didn\u2019t recognize her. But the housekeeper did and stared incredulously at Xiao Yao while she smiled \u201cDon\u2019t recognize me anymore? Pay my carriage fee and then hurry to tell Xing Yue that I\u2019m here.\u201dThe housekeeper stuttered \u201cPrincess?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe housekeeper immediately paid the carriage and then vanished in a puff of power and then moments later Xing Yue came bursting out of the residence \u201cXiao Yao, is it really you?\u201dXiao Yao twirled before her \u201cDo I look like someone transformed into me?\u201dXing Yue ecstatically grabbed her \u201cThank G.o.d!\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s my Gege?\u201dXing Yue said \u201cEverything is fine other than he worries about you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI ought to go to Sheng Nong Mountain to see Gege first but I heard Jing is very sick. I want to go to Qing Qiu to see him, can you come with me?\u201dXing Yue pulled her inside \u201cYou came to the right place. Jing gege is not at Qing Qiu, he\u2019s here.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cTake me to see him now.\u201dXing Yue led her to the Evergreen Residence \u201cWhat happened years ago? How did Jing gege end up in the cherry blossom canyon?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cI don\u2019t know either. All I know is that the man turned all the cherry blossoms into daggers and sent it flying into me. Then I couldn\u2019t see or hear anything anymore.\u201dXiao Yao remembered the extent of Xiao Yao\u2019s injuries and still felt shocked. She patted Xiao Yao\u2019s hand warmly \u201cThose people who hurt you have all been dealt with by your Gege. They won\u2019t harm you again.\u201dXiao Yao was silent.They arrived at the Evergreen Residence and Xing Yue knocked. Jing Ye opened the door and when she saw Xiao Yao she was startled \u201cPrincess?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201dJing Ye grabbed her and pulled her inside the residence and she was already crying. Xing Yue was shocked \u201cJing Ye, how can you be so rude to the Princess?\u201dXiao Yao was being pulled behind but called back to Xing Yue \u201cI\u2019ll handle things here, you send word to Zhuan Xu that I\u2019m back.\u201dXing Yue realized she had things to take care of now that Xiao Yao was back \u201cFine, you stay here with Jing for now. If you need anything have someone summon me.\u201d\u201cFine! I won\u2019t be polite with you!\u201dXing Yue smiled and turned to leave. Because the G.o.ds lived for so long, it was common for relatives to see each other every tens of years, and even seeing family once every hundred years wasn\u2019t uncommon or strange. So not seeing Xiao Yao for tens of years didn\u2019t make Xing Yue feel distant from her.Jing Ye appeared scared Xiao Yao would disappear so held her hand tightly.She led Xiao Yao into the middle of the forest where a wooden hut was built using wood from Jade Mountain\u2019s peach blossom trees. Walking into the room, it was filled with all sorts of exotic flowers and plants to create a maze that kept all the spiritual power centered over a crystal pallet where Jing quietly laid.Xiao Yao sat down next to the pallet and carefully took in Jing, his body was atrophied and his face pale white.Jing Ye said \u201cCountless doctors came to check on Master and they all said he was broken hearted so all his spiritual essence was shattered and he is seeking death.\u201dXiao Yao picked up Jing\u2019s wrist to take his pulse.Jing Ye continued \u201cTo keep him alive, the Grand Madam used every method and even got the Grand Emperor to allow him to be brought into the holy Yang Valley to use the holy water there to heal him. But whenever he leaves the Evergreen Residence his condition gets worse and even the most powerful spiritual essence is of no use. Princess, please save Master!\u201dJing Ye kneeled before Xiao Yao and bowed her head.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy would Jing choose to die, why is he so sad he doesn\u2019t want to live anymore?\u201dJing Ye glared at Xiao Yao \u201cHow could Princess not know?\u201d\u201cWhy should I know?\u201d\u201cWhen Prince Zhuan Xu arrived to save Princess, they saw Master holding Princess and you had already died. The entire maze was engulfed in flames and Master could break mazes and ought to be able to leave any maze but instead he was holding Princess and sitting inside waiting for death.\u201d Jing Ye cried \u201cMaster would rather be burned to death then leave the already dead you. Princess, how can you now know Master\u2019s heart? He wants to be with you whether in life or in death!\u201dXiao Yao turned to look at Jing and murmured \u201cYou really are so broken over me that you are seeking death?\u201dXiao Yao felt the sh.e.l.l around her heart shatter completely, all those threads that she tried to cut all those times finally weaved together into a web at last.Hu Zhen brought medicine in \u201cTime for medicine.\u201dJing Ye helped Jing up and put a cloth around his neck before feeding him the medicine. But it all dribbled out onto the cloth and nothing was taken in.Jing Ye was worried Xiao Yao would find it distasteful and quickly wiped the medicine from his lips and explained \u201cIn the past he could take in three spoons out of ten but this year he won\u2019t even take a single drop. Hu Zhen says that if it continues, then Master\u2026..\u201d Jing Ye\u2019s tears started falling again.Xiao Yao took over the bowl \u201cYou guys go outside, I\u2019ll feed him the medicine.\u201dJing Ye stared at Xiao Yao and she said \u201cIf I can\u2019t do it, then I\u2019ll call you back in, okay?\u201dHu Zhen tugged Jing Ye\u2019s sleeve and they walked out.Xiao Yao spooned medicine and fed Jing but it all dribbled out like when Jing Ye did it.Xiao Yao touched his cheek and sighed \u201cWhat to do? Last time you were gravely injured but you had the will to live. No matter how hard to swallow you would work with me, but this time you are rejecting the medicine.\u201dXiao Yao put down the bowl and held Jing by the neck and lightly kissed his eyes, then lightly kissed his nose, then lightly kissed his lips. She bit down on his lip and murmured \u201cDo you remember? In this residence I learned the zither from you, and each time you shyly wanted to kiss me but restrained yourself and even purposely stayed a distance from me. I could sense all that but I loved to tease you so I pretended not to know. I wanted to see you battle with your own self-control. But once you kissed me, you turned from a little rabbit into a big bad wolf, no matter how I avoided I couldn\u2019t run from you, and then I turned from the big bad wolf into the little rabbit.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cBut now you\u2019re really the little rabbit and I get to do whatever with you.\u201dXiao Yao picked up the medicine bowl and drank a sip before kissing Jing and dribbling the medicine into his mouth. Jing\u2019s consciousness was still asleep but it was like a tree that wrapped its roots around soil so his subconscious started to swallow the medicine and wanted more of the sweetness. The entire spoonful of medicine went down his throat.Just like that, with a kiss and a swallow, Xiao Yao fed him the entire bowl of medicine.Jing\u2019s face was still pale white but Xiao Yao\u2019s face was reddenend and she nestled against Jing\u2019s shoulder and said softly \u201cCan you wake up now? I like you being the big bad wolf.\u201dJing Ye waited outside for a long time but continued to worry so she knocked \u201cPrincess?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cCome in.\u201dJing Ye and Hu Zhen entered and saw Jing laying on the pallet but the bowl of medicine empty.Jing Ye saw the cloth next to the bowl only having a few drops of medicine on it and she asked \u201cPrincess, did you dump the medicine?\u201d\u201cNo, I fed Jing the whole bowl.\u201dJing Ye was incredulous \u201cAnd only a little dribbled?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cYou dribbled a spoonful, I dribbled a spoonful, the rest he drank.\u201dJing Ye stared while Hu Zhen nudged her \u201cAs long as Master drinks the medicine then he can be saved.\u201dJing Ye was like waking from a daze and excitedly said \u201cGo make another bowl and have Master drink another.\u201dXiao Yao and Hu Zhen both laughed and Jing Ye realized she was being silly. Xiao Yao said to Hu Zhen \u201cThis medicine is good, send another bowl in four hours.\u201dJing Ye asked \u201cPrincess, how did you get Master to drink the medicine? Teach me!\u201d If Xiao Yao was just anyone, Jing Ye would keep her here to take care of Jing, but she was a Princess so no matter how much Jing Ye wanted she couldn\u2019t dare ask Xiao Yao to help feed her Master medicine.Xiao Yao blushed slightly and said \u201cMy method is secret and can\u2019t be taught.\u201dJing Ye was disappointed until Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ll stay here to take care of Jing, after he wakes up I\u2019ll leave. You don\u2019t need to learn it.\u201dJing Ye was so ecstatic she kneeled down and Xiao Yao helped her up \u201cGive me some meat and vegetable porridge, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jing Ye rushed out but then stopped and looked back. Xiao Yao said \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll take care of your Master and you don\u2019t need to worry about him.\u201dJing Ye happily answered \u201cYes!\u201dAfter Jing Ye brought the porridge, Xiao Yao ate half and fed a few spoonfuls to Jing. Xiao Yao\u2019s const.i.tution was also just healed from a long illness, plus she didn\u2019t sleep for an entire day and night, so she felt exhausted.Jing Ye came to clean up and afterwards Xiao Yao said \u201cI want to rest for a bit, don\u2019t bother me unless it\u2019s urgent.\u201dJing Ye wanted to say something but Xiao Yao already closed the door. Jing Ye stood there for a moment before walking away with a smile.Xiao Yao pushed Jing to the side of the pallet and then climbed on and laid down next to him. In a few moments, she was fast asleep._____________________________When she woke up, Xiao Yao felt the light in the room was dim which meant it was dusk already. In the light floral fragrance, Xiao Yao stretched and then Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice reached her \u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201dXiao Yao sat up and saw Zhuan Xu standing in the trees looking at her.Xiao Yao leaped off the pallet and rushed into his arms \u201cGege!\u201dZhuan Xu refused to hug her and instead wanted to push her away \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you and thinking of you every single day, but you come running to see another man the moment you get back.\u201dXiao Yao grabbed his arm and wouldn\u2019t let go and tenderly called out \u201cGege, Gege, Gege\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me Gege, I don\u2019t have a little sister like you.\u201dXiao Yao pitifully stared at Zhuan Xu \u201cYou really don\u2019t want me anymore?\u201dZhuan Xu pouted \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t want me!\u201dXiao Yao tried to explain \u201cI heard Jing was near death so came to see him first.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re not worried about me?\u201d\u201cHow can I not worry? When I was unconscious I often thought of you. When I entered Zhi Yi Castle was when I lessened my worry, and the first person I asked Xing Yue about was you.\u201dZhuan Xu remembered the way Xiao Yao was when she was gravely injured and immediately his annoyance vanished. He sighed and pulled Xiao Yao into his arms \u201cYou scared me to death!\u201dXiao Yao knew how he must\u2019ve felt and patted his back \u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cWant to go back to Sheng Nong Mountain with me?\u201dXiao Yao bit her lip \u201cI want to wait for Jing to wake up first.\u201dZhuan Xu looked at Jing sleeping on the pallet and wearily said \u201cFine, but\u2026\u2026:\u201d Zhuan Xu rapped her hard on the head \u201cNo more sleeping with him on the same pallet. If people see it they\u2019ll think no man wants my little sister and she\u2019s throwing herself at a man.\u201dXiao Yao stuck out her tongue but obediently said \u201cYes, Gege!\u201dZhuan Xu asked Xiao Yao how Xiang Liu saved her.Xiao Yao answered \u201cI was unconscious the entire time so I don\u2019t know the specifics. Likely due to the voodoo bug connecting us, so his life was the thread that kept me alive, and then he used a certain type of voodoo blood spell and exchanged his life to continue mine.\u201dZhuan Xu thought \u201cVoodoo bugs, voodoo blood spells, those are all unorthodox methods. Does your body feel strange?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cGege, when did you get so narrow-minded? The traditional medicine used to save people can also be used to kill. The unorthodox voodoo can also be used to save people. How do you differentiate traditional good versus unorthodox bad?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019m not narrow-minded, I\u2019m just worried that you\u2019ll get taken advantage of. I will keep my promise so I don\u2019t want Xiang Liu to play tricks.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cXiang Liu saving me was in exchange for something?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cHe said he could save you and asked to take you away. I had no other choice so I agreed. A few days ago he came to see and said that if I agreed to one thing then you can return safely.\u201dXiang Liu really was clear and precise on each and every thing, he never gets taken advantage of! Xiao Yao felt all sorts of conflicted feelings, unsure if it was disappointment or relief \u201cWhat was the deal?\u201d\u201cHe wanted one of Sheng Nong Mountain\u2019s peaks.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI asked Xiang Liu the same thing and he said that all the resistance soldiers following General Gong Gong are unable to forget their homeland but are willing to fight for their cause. If they died they would still not be able to be buried in their homeland. Xiang Liu asked that if one day I were to become the Xuan Yuan Emperor, then I was to carve out one of Sheng Nong Mountain\u2019s peaks as a sacred land and then all the dead resistance army soldiers who were cremated could have their ashes brought back and buried in the Sheng Nong Mountain they long for.\u201d\u201cDid you agree?\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cEven a little peak in Sheng Nong Mountain is still a peak in Sheng Nong Mountain! I know this is a big deal so I can\u2019t readily agree. But I also couldn\u2019t say no, and it wasn\u2019t just because of you. It was because I too want to give those men a place to rest peacefully. They are my enemies on the battlefield and we do our best to kill each other, but I respect their fight!\u201dXiao Yao said nothing.Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cBut I also told Xiang Liu that he might get shafted in this deal. What if I can\u2019t become the Xuan Yuan Emperor? He can\u2019t come find you then and cause trouble. Xiang Liu agreed but I still worry that he might have tricks up his sleeve.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if Xiang Liu wanted to kill me using voodoo and such spells it\u2019s not that easy to harm me.\u201d\u201cEvery time you mention voodoo you just glance over it, but how exactly did you learn to raise and plant a voodoo bug? And who taught you all the poison tricks you know?\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cCan we talk secretly here?\u201dZhaun Xu nodded and cast a protective spell barrier around them. Xiao Yao asked \u201cSo you know the Sheng Nong Herb Manual?\u201d\u201cOf course, legend has it the Flame Emperor used his entire life to write that manual after testing every living herb in existence. The entire world wants that manual but after the Flame Emperor died it disappeared.\u201d\u201cIt was actually with my Mom. Do you remember when Grandmother and Grandfather were both ill and it was my Mom who was healing them.\u201d\u201cOf course, but I always thought Auntie learned medicine from the court doctors.\u201d\u201cI did as well and it was only later that I realized my Mom learned medicine from the Flame Emperor.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.how could that be? Grandfather long wanted to exterminate the Sheng Nong Kingdom.\u201d\u201cWho knows? Perhaps my Mom stole it.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Many times Zhuan Xu\u2019s respect for Xiao Yao\u2019s mom greatly eclipsed her own.\u201cWhen Mom left me in Jade Mountain, around my neck was a jade container that held the Sheng Nong Herb Manual which taught my Mom all about medicines, but it also contained the Jiu Li Poison Voodoo Manual which contained all the spells about using poison and bugs. When the Royal Mother discovered it, she said both books were future catastrophes if people discovered it. She forced me to memorize both and then she destroyed it afterwards.\u201d Xiao Yao remembered how she cried and sobbed and refused to talk with the Royal Mother afterwards for destroying what her mom left for her.Xiao Yao said \u201cInitially I tucked all that knowledge away in the back of my mind, but when I was captured by the Nine-tailed fox, I remembered the poison learnings. I knew I only had one chance to poison him so I was very careful, and even worried that the Voodoo King\u2019s voodoo manual poisons were not deadly and discreet enough, and even used the Flame Emperor\u2019s medical research to create more poisons.\u201dXiao Yao waved her hands \u201cMy Mom left me those things likely wanting me to become a healer to ease the people\u2019s suffering, but I think I\u2019m going to become the poison master of my generation.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and touched her head \u201cYou do whatever you like.\u201dXing Yue called outside \u201cZhuan Xu, Xiao Yao, my Gege is back.\u201dZhuan Xu pulled Xiao Yao out \u201cHave dinner with me, and after I leave you can take care of that guy however you want. If I don\u2019t see it then it won\u2019t annoy me as much!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cFine.\u201dAs she walked out she said to Jing Ye \u201cSince Jing is staying here, then clean up Jing\u2019s old room and I\u2019ll stay there for now.\u201dJing Ye saw Zhuan Xu said nothing so relaxed and said with a smile \u201cYes.\u201d__________________________________Xiao Yao, Zhuan Xu, Xing Yue, and Feng Long enjoyed dinner that night and Xiao Yao discovered that she was actually asleep for thirty seven years.Xiao Yao just got back and no one wanted to discuss too somber matters so merely condensed all the interestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI think it ironic that in Lost You Forever Xiao Yao has three amazing leading man in her life but really none of the three comes equipped with everything she wants in her life. At most we can say one has more than the others, or really it comes down to what she prioritizes first. Xiao Yao keeps saying that she want a simple life to grow old with someone. But from the feisty Xiao Yao we know, that isn\u2019t really her. She longs for adventure deep down inside, she\u2019s just too scared to reach for it. So right now you can say she\u2019s stealing time with all her guys even if she\u2019s mentally decided on Jing. I can\u2019t say the way she\u2019s heartbroken over Xiang Liu and thinking about him bodes well for her being a one-man woman later on with Jing, plus Xiang Liu stuck her in a clam sh.e.l.l for thirty-seven years which if you ask me fairly screams \u201cI love you\u201d even if he says otherwise. I love her loyalty to Jing, though, because it\u2019s the very thing she felt was lacking in her parental figures hence she\u2019s never going to be the first to let go. The ball is in Jing\u2019s court but he\u2019s kindness really is at odds with his end goal of giving everything up to be with Xiao Yao. He could use a little more of Zhuan Xu\u2019s ruthlessness and a bit of Xiang Liu\u2019s coldness, otherwise he\u2019s really drifting farther and farther from his dream life. I\u2019m glad everyone that matter is alive or awake and the story gets back to business with lots of action that might make one s.h.i.+p despondent while giving hope to another s.h.i.+p.Chapter 23 \u2013 Familial Strife Demands No Rush:Jing returned to Qing Qiu around midnight but ordered the servants not to alert the Grand Madam and he\u2019ll go see her when she rose in the morning.Jing was concerned about Feng Long and Zhuan Xu\u2019s situation so didn\u2019t even bother to rest and instead met with his trusted subordinates to get a summary of what happened the last thirty some years. By the time the discussion finished it was already deep into the night.He slept for two hours and washed up before heading to see his grandmother.The Grand Madam was in her room sitting on a pallet, with Hou, Hou\u2019s wife Lan Mu, and Fang Fang Yi Yang flanking her on either side.Jing saw her and rushed over to kneel before her \u201cGrandmother, I\u2019m home.\u201dThere were tears in the Grand Madam\u2019s eyes and she gestured for him to rise \u201cYou\u2019re finally back, I thought I would be able to last until I saw you.\u201dJing saw that she looked healthy and energetic, with her color high and said \u201cGrandmother you look well! How can you not be around to see your grandson?\u201dThe Grand Madam pulled Jing to sit beside her \u201cYou\u2019re too thin! You need to recuperate for some time and not let me worry when I look at you!\u201dJing smiled \u201cYour grandson will eat a lot and fatten myself until grandmother approves.\u201dThe Grand Madam smiled and nodded her head.Jing greeted his brother and sister-in-law and the Grand Madam pointed to Yi Yang \u201cYou need to thank Yi Yang, she\u2019s been so busy on your behalf all these years.\u201dJing politely bowed to Yi Yang but said nothing. After he straightened himself he turned to his grandmother \u201cI have something to say to grandmother.\u201dThe Grand Madam replied \u201cI also have something I want to say to you.\u201d She glanced at Hou and them \u201cYou all leave us, I want to chat with Jing a bit.\u201dEveryone bowed and left the room.Jing knelt down \u201cI want to quickly end my engagement with Yi Yang. Please will grandmother permit it.\u201dThe Grand Madam was not surprised \u201cI knew you would say this. I also know what I will say back: Impossible!\u201dJing begged \u201cI have no feelings towards Yi Yang and she feels the same towards me. Why won\u2019t grandmother let us end the engagement?\u201d\u201cI can see you don\u2019t have feelings for her, but I can\u2019t see that she doesn\u2019t have feelings for you!\u201dJing raised his head \u201cI already love another, please will grandmother permit!\u201dThe Grand Madam sighed \u201cSilly child, you long do you think feelings will last. Day after day, the endless time together, all feelings will be smoothed out until all that remains is lightness. Actually, a married couple is more like a business partners.h.i.+p, you give her what she needs, she gives you what you need, you respect her one step, she respects you one step. Back and forth, like flowing water lasting for a long time.\u201d\u201cGrandmother, I will not marry Yi Yang!\u201d\u201cIf you are Hou then you can do whatever you want and I don\u2019t care! But you are the future Tu Shan clan leader, and the leader determines the rise and fall of the entire clan! Yi Yang is smart and careful, plus the Fang Feng clan relies on the Tu Shan clan which further limits her options. Trust grandmother\u2019s judgement, she is the best choice for the leader\u2019s wife! For the Tu Shan clan, you must marry her!\u201dJing said \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the clan leader, let older brother be the clan leader!\u201d\u201cYou wretch!\u201d The Grand Madam slapped the table and all the plates and cups shattered on the floor and the tea splashed Jing. The Grand Madam touched her heart \u201cSixty years! I spent sixty years training the best clan leader wife, I don\u2019t have another sixty years left!\u201dJing kept bowing his head even as his forehead slammed into the broken shards on the ground and jabbed into his flesh \u201cIf grandmother doesn\u2019t agree to end the engagement, then I can only leave the Tu Shan clan.\u201dThe Grand Madam\u2019s body shook and she pointed at Jing \u201cIf you want me to die, then leave! You might as well strangle me now. If I die then you can do whatever you want and no one will care.\u201dJing kept bowing and begging \u201cGrandmother!\u201dThe Grand Madam called her maid \u201cXiao Yu, tell this wretch to scram!\u201dXiao Yu walked in \u201cPlease will young master not distress the Grand Madam and allow her to rest!\u201dJing saw her clutching her chest and her face had turned purple so he immediately left.But he didn\u2019t leave and only knelt down in the courtyard. The maid reported it to the Grand Madam but she kept her eyes closed \u201cIgnore him! Call all the clan elders here!\u201dJing knelt outside her room for a day and a night but the Grand Madam ignored him and continued to arrange matters with the clan elders.After everything was arranged, she had servants bring everyone back. Jing was just recovered from a long illness and had knelt for so long that his face was pale white and his forehead b.l.o.o.d.y and bruised, looking very ragged. Hou and Yi Yang saw him like that and the hatred in their eyes flitted past.Yi Yang walked into the room and saw the Grand Madam and immediately knelt down in tears to beg forgiveness for Jing.The Grand Madam saw everyone has arrived so said to Xiao Yu \u201cCall that wretch inside\u201dJing was helped inside the room by a servant. Yi Yang rushed over to help tend to him but he kept his distance \u201cNo need to bother the miss!\u201dYi Yang restrained her tears and reluctantly stood to the side and shot very pitiful looks at the Grand Madam.The Grand Madam said nothing and watched Xiao Yu patch up the cuts on Jing\u2019s forehead.She then had both grandsons sit and glanced across their faces \u201cEverything is set. In three days time there will be a ceremony to officially announce Jing as the next Tu Shan clan leader. This is a rushed affair so there won\u2019t be a lot of guests, but the Yellow Emperor, the Grand Emperor, the other clans Chi Sui, Xi Long, Gui Fang, and the Middle Plains Six Big Families, will all send representatives here. That will be enough.\u201dJing and Hou were shocked that the Grand Madam would quietly arrange everything, even inviting the guests.Jing knelt down \u201cGrandmother, the clan leader matter can wait a few years.\u201dThe Grand Madam raged \u201cA few years? How many years do you think I have left? Your grandfather died shortly after your father was born and I had to steel myself and run the entire clan. I finally lasted until your father married and became the clan leader and thought I could take a break\u2026.but that wretch actually left before me! I almost collapsed that time but thank goodness your mom stepped up to manage the clan. Us two widows raised the pair of you but your mom didn\u2019t get to enjoy any happiness before leaving to join that wretch. I pray day and night that you will take over as clan leader, but then you disappeared for years! I got you back after ten years and before I could even let out a sigh of relief, you went unconscious and wouldn\u2019t wake up. How much longer do I have left for you to torment?\u201dThe Grand Madam spoke and a lifetime of pain and hard work rose up and the normally stalwart her began to cry.Hou, Lan Mu, and Yi Yang all knelt down before her and the Grand Madam wiped her tears \u201cI don\u2019t care what you guys think, this time Tu Shan Jing is going to become the clan leader regardless of whether you want to or not.\u201dJing continued to bow his head on the ground and begged \u201cGrandmother, I really don\u2019t want to be clan leader! Older brother is the elder, why can\u2019t he become the clan leader?\u201dThe Grand Madam shouted \u201cWretch! You know the answer and yet you still ask? Some things can be concealed to the world but can\u2019t be concealed from those who are close. Your maternal grandfather was the last leader of the Tan family, and the current leader is your uncle. Your maternal grandmother was the eldest daughter of the Chi Sui clan, the current cousin of the clan leader. Hou\u2026..will they accept him as clean leader?\u201dThe Grand Madam clutched her heart and cried \u201cWretch, tell me! Will the Chi Sui, Xi Ling, and the Middle Plains Six Big Families all agree with you not being the clan leader?\u201dJing pleaded \u201cI can go beg them one by one.\u201dThe Grand Madam cried \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know all the things you\u2019ve done behind my back all these years. The clan elders only accept you, they won\u2019t allow you not to be the clan leader.\u201dJing could only keep pleading and bowing his head \u201cGrandmother, I really don\u2019t want to be clan leader, older brother wants to be clan leader!\u201dThe Grand Madam looked at her two kneeling grandsons \u201cThe clan leader has to lead from within and influence the world beyond, that is a true clan leader. Not everyone can be the clan leader just because of desire!\u201d\u201cHou, come here!\u201d The Grand Madam reached out her hand and Hou kneeled over to her side.She raised him up to sit beside her \u201cHou, I know you are not one bit less capable than Jing. But the clan leader determines the rise and fall of an entire clan. If you become clan leader, the nine clan elders won\u2019t accept you and the Tu Shan clan will splinter from within. Then you won\u2019t get support from outside the clan either, the Chi Sui and Tan families will make it difficult for you. A clan\u2019s fall in one generations means suffering for many generations to come. The fall of a clan could be in one decision.\u201dThe Grand Madam embraced Hou and cried \u201cWhen your father was dying, his last words were for me to take care of you. All these years, have I treated you one whit less?\u201dHou answered \u201cGrandmother has always treated me well, not one whit preferential or lacking.\u201d That is why all those years he had chances to forcibly take the clan leader role and he never could get up the hard heart to kill the grandmother who loved him since birth, which is how things have stagnated until now.The Grand Madam stroked Hou\u2019s head \u201cWhen your dad died, the only thing he couldn\u2019t leave behind was you. No matter how much you hate your mother, she didn\u2019t kill you and instead raised you to adulthood and found you the best masters to teach you all the skills you have now. You have the Tu Shan clan blood in you, how can you watch the clan fall and let me die in worry?\u201dHou was devastated and knelt down and bowed his head hard \u201cGrandmother please be well.\u201d But he never said that he wouldn\u2019t vy for the clan leader position.Jing also bowed his head hard \u201cPlease cancel the clan leader ceremony three days from now. I don\u2019t want to be clan leader.\u201d Still he refused to accept the clan leader role.The Grand Madam stared at her grandsons, her heartbreak, rage, and despair all rushed to her heart and suddenly all her blood burst forth and she spit out blood that splattered on Jing and Hou.Both Jing and Hou jumped up and went to a.s.sist her but her face was ashen and she was barely breathing. Jing wanted to transfer power to her but Hou violently pushed his hand away \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dJing knew Hou\u2019s powers were stronger so didn\u2019t fight him and instead pressed down on his grandmother\u2019s pressure point to help her spirit move in her body.Yi Yang and Lan Mu called out \u201cDoctor, doctor!\u201dThe Grand Madam\u2019s personal doctor a lady by the name of Se Mai Er rushed in and saw the blood on Jing and Hou\u2019s body and her face changed. She fed the Grand Madam a large pill and the Grand Madam gradually stabilized.Jing and Hou were both relieved and Hou said \u201cGrandmother, please cancel the ceremony in three days! Your health is most important.\u201dJing added \u201cYes, please get better soon.\u201dThe Grand Madam smiled bitterly \u201cI won\u2019t hide it from you two anymore, I have at most a year left to live.\u201dJing and Hou were in disbelief and both looked at the doctor.Se Mai Er said \u201cThe Grand Madam is correct, at most one year.\u201dHou was agitated and yelled \u201cNo, no! Grandmother has been so healthy these past tens of years, there must be a way to treat her.\u201dThe Grand Madam wearily said \u201cWhen Jing was unconscious, I figured you would likely itch to do something. As a widow I could manage the entire Tu Shan clan which shows that I\u2019m not someone who is easy to deal with. If you weren\u2019t my grandson I would have gotten rid of you already. But you are my grandson that I held in my arms, and because Jing\u2019s mother preferred him, I was extra good to you. You are the piece of flesh on my heart and I cannot bear to cut you off. But I can\u2019t rid you of your ambition so I can only get up all my remaining strength to keep this family legacy secure. To have the energy to deal with you youngsters, I had Se Mai Er plant a voodoo bug in me. You see all my boundless energy these past tens of years? It was all due to the voodoo bug sustaining me.\u201dBoth Jing and Hou\u2019s face changed. Jing had researched a lot about voodoo bugs these years because of Xiao Yao and he murmured \u201cBut that\u2019s a prohibited magic.\u201dHou asked \u201cIs there is way to break it?\u201dSe Mai Er replied \u201cThe voodoo bug has backfired today, there is no way left.\u201dHou anxiously asked \u201cBackfired? What does backfired mean?\u201dSe Mai Er explained \u201cThe prohibited magic of voodoo is that it allows a person to accomplish their greatest desire, but conversely before death the person will endure the greatest pain of the voodoo bug collecting on it\u2019s equal payment. A person will endure the pain of the bug eating all the insides until the body, soul, and essence is all consumed by the bug. In the end, there is nothing remaining, not even a corpse.\u201dJing stared at his grandmother and tears came, and Hou was also in tears \u201cGrandmother, grandmother, how\u2026.how could you?\u201dThe Grand Madam laughed \u201cHow could I? Because of you two wretches! Even if I endure the most horrific pain and have no corpse left, if I can protect the Tu Shan clan then after I die I will have done my duty to our ancestors and not be ashamed before them\u2026\u2026\u201d The Grand Madam suddenly stopped talking and she curled up in pain. Jing and Hou rushed over to help her.The Grand Madam said \u201cOut, tell them all\u2026..to get out!\u201dSe Mai Er said to Jing and Hou \u201cThe Grand Madam is so strong in her life, she doesn\u2019t want anyone to see her like this\u2026..if you both respect your elder then please leave now!\u201dJing and Hou stared at their grandmother curled up in pain and looked at each other before leaving the room along with Lan Mu and Yi Yang.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u2026Ahhhhhh\u2026\u2026.\u201d The screams of agony came like waves from inside the room.Jing and Hou glared at each other in rage but when they heard their grandmother scream in agony, both closed their eyes in pain. Because of them, their most loved one must endure the agony of a voodoo bug consuming her insides.The Grand Madam\u2019s maid Xiao Yu walked out \u201cTwo young masters, please leave now! The Grand Madam must endure the agony an hour a day now but most of the time she\u2019ll be lucid. In time the pain will grow longer and her mental acuity will leave her. She said earlier that she has at most a year left, but really it\u2019s half a year only.\u201dXiao Yu started crying \u201cFor hundreds of years I\u2019ve taken care of the Grand Madam and seen what she has done for the Tu Shan clan, what she has done for you both. If both of you even have a shred of filial piety left in you, then please accept the Grand Madam\u2019s wishes for the sake of the Tu Shan clan. When she is lucid let her see the new clan leader emerge so that she can die in peace, so that this pain is worth it.\u201dXiao Yu finished and gestured for them to leave.Hou turned and rushed out, with a long whistle he vaulted on his winged ride and was gone into the air though the sound of his angry howling scream floated down.Jing said nothing and walked out slowly, step by step until he left the residence and arrived at the base of Qing Qiu Mountain.His winged ride Li Li came down and nuzzled his arm as if wanting to take him someone. Jing stared at Li Li but didn\u2019t know where to go. He thought he could leave Qing Qiu and wander the world just the two of them. But the truth was that he could never leave Qing Qiu.Jing turned back towards Qing Qiu Mountain.The Tu Shan clan residence was built on the side of Qing Qiu Mountain, from the dawn of time until now, tens of generations of Tu Shan clan leaders have built and expanded on it. There were tens of courtyards and when the waning sun shone down on it, it illuminated all the bricks and trees that made the entire residence glow with life.He was willing to give up everything, but he could not give up his bloodline.The sky turned dark but Jing still stood at the base of the mountain.The sound of thunder reached him and then came the pouring rain. It startled Jing awake and he said to Li Li \u201cTo Sheng Nong Mountain!\u201d___________________________Xiao Yao was already asleep when she was awakened by the thunder in the middle of the night.The sound of the pouring rain striking the roof tops was an unending battering noise.Xiao Yao listened for a bit and was about to go back to sleep when she suddenly heard a crane call out. She put on her robe and opened the door. It was pitch black out and the wind and rain was howling.Xiao Yao looked around and then saw two figures walking towards her in the darkness.Xiao Yao incredulously asked \u201cJing? Is that you?\u201dThe figures came close and one was Xiao Xiao and the other really was Jing. He was soaked through as if just fished out of the water, his hair crown long gone and his hair a mess plastered all over his ashen face.Xiao Xiao said \u201cThe guards said someone was barging into Zhi Jin Palace but when I arrived and saw it was Master Jing, he already looked like this. His highness had me bring him to see the Princess.\u201dXiao Xiao finished and left quietly.\u201cJing, you\u2026.come inside first!\u201d Xiao Yao didn\u2019t care to ask why Jing barged into Sheng Nong Mountain in the middle of the night, pulling him into her room.Xiao Yao placed him beside the brazier and helped dry his hair. She saw his forehead was cut and bruised and she touched it \u201cWhat happened?\u201dJing grabbed Xiao Yao suddenly in a tight embrace, his body cold after being in the rain for so long. Xiao Yao silently let him hold her.After some time Jing said \u201cGrandmother used a prohibited voodoo bug spell, the voodoo bug has backfired and is consuming her insides.\u201dWhen the voodoo bug backfires, there is not much time left to live. Xiao Yao was stunned and didn\u2019t know how to comfort Jing so could only stroke his back.Jing said \u201cGrandmother wants me to a.s.sume the clan leader position in three days time. I can\u2019t say no anymore.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI had decided that regardless of whether Grandmother agreed or not, I was going to be with you\u2026.but now\u2026.I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s really okay!\u201dXiao Yao sighed. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care but if Jing\u2019s grandmother was willing to give up her life and Jing selfishly choose to leave the Tu Shan clan to be with her, then he wouldn\u2019t be the Jing that Xiao Yao liked.That night Jing didn\u2019t go back to Qing Qiu.That night, Hou also didn\u2019t go back to Qing Qiu. Lan Mu was long used to it and never dared speak a word about it. That night she turned into a fox and snuck to check on Fang Feng Yi Yang and saw that she was also missing. In sixty years, it wasn\u2019t the first time she discovered both Hou and Yi Yang gone at the same time. Lan Mu hid under the blankets and cried all night, not because of Hou not coming home all night, but because she discovered something she shouldn\u2019t know and she was absolutely terrified.________________________The second day past noon, Jing and Hou both returned to Qing Qiu.The Grand Madam summoned both and she sat on a pallet looking rather healthy and not like someone near death.She asked Jing \u201cDid you decide?\u201dJing knelt down \u201cYour grandson agrees to a.s.sume the clan leader position.\u201dShe smiled and turned to Hou \u201cDid you decide?\u201dHou knelt down \u201cYour grandson will never vie for the clan leader position.\u201dThe Grand Madam stared at Hou \u201cAre you willing to make a blood swear in front of all your ancestors that you will never vie for the clan leader position and never harm Jing?\u201dHou paused and then said \u201cI am willing!\u201dThe Grand Madam let out a sigh of relief and broke into a smile before brus.h.i.+ng away her tears \u201cI didn\u2019t waste all my love on you both.\u201dHou and Jing both bowed their heads and said simultaneously \u201cYour grandson has caused you to suffer!\u201dThe Grand Madam said \u201cThe elders will handle the ceremony preparation, tomorrow Hou will go to the ancestral shrine to swear a blood vow.\u201dHou bowed \u201cYes.\u201dThe Grand Madam had them both get up and grabbed each by the hand and looked at them both and sighing \u201cEven if I die, I\u2019m dying happy!\u201dJing looked at Hou, since he returned to the Tu Shan clan he\u2019s used all sorts of methods to try and resolve their dispute but Hou never accepted. Could Hou really put down his anger and ambition for their grandmother?After leaving their grandmother\u2019s room, Hou was walking away quickly when Jing called out \u201cOlder brother!\u201dHou stopped and Jing asked \u201cAre you really willing?\u201dHou laughed coldly \u201cYou\u2019re giving up the freedom you want for her, why can\u2019t I give up some ambition for her?\u201dFor a second Jing didn\u2019t know what to feel and said \u201cI know you have always known I don\u2019t want to be clan leader. Why didn\u2019t you work with me tens of years ago. I told you then I didn\u2019t want to be clan leader, and I didn\u2019t hate you. If you worked with me, you could have been clan leader a long time ago.\u201dHou laughed in derision \u201cI can fight for what I want, I don\u2019t need the high and mighty Master Jing to toss me a bone! Why don\u2019t you seek revenge on me? Did you forgive me? Does it make you feel like you\u2019re better than me? Are you sitting up high looking down in pity at someone all consumed by envy and anger like me?\u201dHou walked right up to Jing and Jing backed up and had nothing to say in response.Hou grabbed Jing\u2019s shoulder in such strength it could shatter Jing \u201cWhy don\u2019t you seek revenge? I would rather you sought revenge over looking at you being so fake and pathetically n.o.ble. Why don\u2019t you hate me! Seeing all the hideous scars on your body, seeing your ugly crippled leg, even your woman can\u2019t stand you and doesn\u2019t want you. Don\u2019t you hate me even a little? Come get your revenge, get your revenge!\u2026..\u201dJing grabbed Hou\u2019s hand \u201cOlder brother, I really don\u2019t hate you!\u201dHou pushed Jing off \u201cFor Grandmother, we ought to each do what is required of us. There is no need to pretend to be close brothers. Everyone knows I\u2019m the lowly born son of a maid, I can\u2019t compare to the perfect high born you.\u201dJing rubbed his aching shoulders and watched Hou storm off. He realized this was it, he could never return to the happy close brothers of the past. Perhaps their grandmother\u2019s sacrifice today was in exchange for each brother a.s.suming their position and not killing each other, and that was the best result that could be hoped for.___________________________Two days later, the Tu Shan clan held a not very spectacular but still very solemn clan leader initiation ceremony.The Yellow Emperor, the Grand Emperor, the Middle Plains Six Big Families, everyone sent representatives to attend. The Grand Emperor send his Eldest Princess and Ru So as his envoys and Xiao Yao secretly thanked her dad for giving her a legitimate reason to be at Qing Qiu and witness the most important ceremony in Jing\u2019s life.Perhaps because all nine-tailed foxes are white so the Tu Shan clan preferred white, the altar was decked out in white and below the altar were jade beams carved in various displays of nine-tailed foxes.Jing wore the most formal attire and first prayed to the Heavens and the ancestors, before thanking the Grand Madam, and finally ascending to the altar to accept from the clan elder the nine-tailed fox jade emblem which represented all the Tu Shan clan wealth and power. The two elders placed a white nine-tailed fox lined coat around Jing which represented the king of the foxes and the Tu Shan clan being the ruler of the entire fox kingdom.The ceremonial horns sounded and the elders announced the completion of the ceremony.Jing turned and walked to the edge of the altar to look down on all the Tu Shan clan members sitting below.Behind him a huge white spectral nine-tailed fox suddenly appeared, with nine fluffy tails that danced like dragons in the sky, covering almost the entire air above them in a display of the power and magic of the nine-tailed fox tribe.Such glorious omen did not always appear in every clan leader initiation ceremony so all the clan members kneeled to the ground in supplication and bowed to Jing. Even the Grand Madam kneeled with tears in her eyes and murmured \u201cMay the ancestors continue to watch over the clan in future generations.\u201dIn the repeated bows and prayers of the Tu Shan clan members, the Jing standing on the white altar seemed so far away.Xiao Yao felt rather dazed, from this moment on Jing carried the fate of his entire clan on his back! He, was no longer her Ye s.h.i.+ Qi.When the banquet began, Xiao Yao started drinking and used the excuse of a headache and tossed all the duties to Ru So and snuck away. She followed the mountain path down the hill.The secluded mountain path was windy and uneven, rising and dipping in places, and there was no end in sight. It was just like life.Xiao Yao smiled \u2013 she hated loneliness and never liked walking alone, but life was naturally the journey of an individual and perhaps she was destined to walk her road by herself.The sound of footsteps reached her and Xiao Yao turned around and saw Fang Feng Bei.In a split second her heart soared and beat wildly. She had the urge to run away but forced herself to calm down and casually asked \u201cI didn\u2019t see you at the ceremony.\u201dFang Feng Bei smirked \u201cBack there you had only eyes for Tu Shan Jing, who else could you see?\u201dHis tone of voice was Fang Feng Bei so Xiao Yao relaxed and awkwardly explained \u201cComing to the ceremony, other than looking at Tu Shan Jing, it\u2019s not like I should be looking around.\u201dThe two walked side-by-side along the mountain path, the crunching sound of leaves being stepped on illuminated the expanse of the mountain air.Fang Feng Bei said \u201cLittle sister said Jing didn\u2019t want to be clan leader, and to cancel their engagement he knelt for a day and night in front of the Grand Madam\u2019s room. If he really didn\u2019t want to be clan leader, knowing little sister\u2019s personality, she would have found a way to cancel their engagement herself. But now that Jing is clan leader, little sister\u2019s years of hard work is finally right at her fingertips. She won\u2019t give up now.\u201dBei looked at Xiao Yao \u201cSeeing hope so close but evaporated into the air, are you upset?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cOf course I\u2019m a little upset, but perhaps I\u2019ve been disappointed and always getting the short end of the stick since childhood, no matter what good things are promised me, I instinctively expect it to be crushed. No matter how poignant the promise is, I never fully believe in it. So I\u2019m not that upset.\u201d Having her own mother abandon her for the greater good of the world, what other love in this world could be fully trusted.Fang Feng Bei softly chuckled \u201cYour personality isn\u2019t all that, no matter how happy you always brace for the pain to come.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThat is why I treasure the happiness right before me, because that is the only thing that is real.\u201dFang Feng Bei stopped and asked with a smile \u201cPrincess, want to go find happiness?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201dFang Feng Bei put his fingers in his mouth and whistled and a winged horse came. He vaulted on its back and reached out his hand to pull Xiao Yao on the back of the horse in front of him.Fang Feng Bei rode the horse to Qing Qiu Castle and took Xiao Yao to the underground gambling den run by the Li Jie tribe.Xiao Yao accepted the dog mask and marveled \u201cCan\u2019t imagine the doggie tribe is running their business right under the Tu Shan clan noses.\u201dFang Feng Bei smacked her upside the head \u201cEven if you\u2019re not scared of offending the Li Jie tribe, I sure am.\u201dXiao Yao put on her mask and changed into a dog faced female body, she made a doggie gesture towards Bei and barked twice.Bei wearily shook his head and quickly walked inside \u201cStay away from me! I don\u2019t want to get beaten up as well when you get walloped!\u201dXiao Yao giggled and ran up to him and grabbed his arm \u201cI purposely want to stay close to you!\u201d As she said that she barked a few times for good measure.Fang Feng Bei used his finger to pinch her \u201cdoggie mouth\u201d shut and begged \u201cLittle lady princess, stop causing a scene!\u201dFang Feng Bei was an old hand and took Xiao Yao to gamble at the tables. Xiao Yao always felt gambling and hard drinking was good stuff, able to numb a person\u2019s heart so that no matter how unpleasant life was, a few cups of strong alcohol and the gambling table and everything was temporarily forgotten.Fang Feng Bei made a six gesture and the serving girl brought out six cups of hard alcohol. Fang Feng Bei raised a cup and Xiao Yao raised a cup and the two of them said nothing and each downed three cups of hard alcohol.Xiao Yao laughed and swanned off to the tables to place her bet and Fang Feng Bei went off to find his kicks.Xiao Yao gambled and drank and after winning a small pouch of money, Fang Feng Bei came back \u201cWant to go watch the slave death matches?\u201dXiao Yao wouldn\u2019t get up \u201cWhy do you men like watching so much slicing and dicing and killing? What\u2019s so interesting about watching blood fly?\u201dFang Feng Bei jerked her up \u201cYou\u2019ll see when you get there. I guarantee you won\u2019t regret it.\u201dIn the slave death match arena, Xiao Yao drank and casually glanced around.Two slaves about to fight a match walked out and Xiao Yao sat up straight the moment she saw one of them. It was the slave she met years ago in Xuan Yuan Castle. She and Bei once bet on him. The way she remembered it felt like just a few years ago, but to that slave, it was over forty years ago and he had to fight every single day in a death match to survive.Xiao Yao murmured \u201cHe\u2019s still alive?\u201dEven though he was pale and skinny and missing his left ear, but he was still alive.Bei crooked his long legs and put his hands behind his head and leaned back \u201cForty years ago he made a deal with his slave owner. If he helped his owner win for forty straight years, then the owner would grant him his freedom. Tonight if he wins, he gets his freedom.\u201d\u201cHow did he do that?\u201d\u201cEndless enduring and patience, for a sliver of hope he never gave up on. Actually, it was the same thing you did when you were trapped in the cage by the nine-tailed fox.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and gulped her cup of wine down. She then tossed her money to place a bet and pointed to the slave she knew \u201cI bet on him winning.\u201dChatter rose around her in disbelief because she placed her bet on a slave that was physically much weaker than his opponent.The fight began.That slave really was so weak! Likely because he was about to gain his freedom, his owner saw him as a losing proposition so never spent money to heal his recent injuries.Soon his injuries began to bleed but his opponent remained as strong as a lion.The wine bottle was right next to Xiao Yao but she never drank and instead focused all her attention on the match.The slave fell in a puddle of blood time and time again, but time and time again he got back up.In the beginning the entire arena was loud with roars and cheers because spectators liked watching b.l.o.o.d.y theater. But in the end, seeing a completely bloodied person keep getting up, everyone lost their voice and could no longer cheer.In the long silence, everyone quietly watched a skinny weak slave battle a strong healthy slave.In the end, the strong healthy slave laid in a puddle of blood and could not get back up, but the skinny weak slave also laid in a puddle of blood and could not get back up.Both slaves laid on the ground so this match did not have a winner.Everyone sighed and got up to leave but Xiao Yao suddenly stood up and yelled loudly towards the match ring \u201cGet up, you get up!\u201dEveryone stopped and stared at her in shock. Xiao Yao yelled again \u201cYou\u2019ve lasted for forty years and you have just one more step to go. Get up! Get up! Get up!\u2026..\u201dThe skinny weak slave actually moved but still couldn\u2019t get up. Everyone got excited and stared at him. Xiao Yao loudly called out \u201cGet up, get up, get up! If you get up then you\u2019ve earned your freedom! Get up, get up!\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know why but her heart which has been cold for hundreds of years suddenly felt burning hot, she didn\u2019t want him to give up, she wanted him to be strong. Even if living didn\u2019t bring happiness, but she still wanted him to stand up. She wanted him to get the ending he endured for, she wanted him to live another kind of life afterwards. Even if he didn\u2019t like it, at least he lived to see it!Some other folks also knew about the slave\u2019s deal with his owner so in the chatter in the arena, soon the entire arena knew he had endured for forty years and this was his final step towards freedom.Xiao Yao yelled \u201cGet up, you get up!\u201dEveryone joined with Xiao Yao to loudly yell \u201cGet up, get up, get back up!\u201dSometimes people could be so dark and cold, but then other times people could be warm and caring. In this moment everyone chose the light and they all hoped for this slave to stand up, to accomplish a near miracle.Everyone hollered \u201cGet up, get up, you get up!\u201dThe skinny weak slave staggered and pushed himself up. Even as he stood there covered in blood and filth and was unsteady, but he stood up, he won!Almost everyone lost money on the match but everyone was happy and celebrating. The slave\u2019s victory was unrelated to them but this moment of goodness in life let them forget their own disappointments and could be happy for the slave just like they had personally also conquered over life\u2019s unbeatable obstacles.Xiao Yao laughed out loud in joy and turned around and hugged Bei and excitedly exclaimed \u201cDid you see that? He won, he\u2019s free!\u201dBei stared at the slave staggering forward and smiled \u201cYes, he won!\u201dXiao Yao saw the slave owner take the slave to meet the gambling den owner to remove the slave\u2019s badge of slavery.Xiao Yao silently sat down and watched everyone excitedly discussing what just happened as they dispersed, until gradually the entire arena was just her and Bei left.Xiao Yao stared at the empty match ring and asked \u201cWhy did you bring me to watch the match?\u201dBei lazily drawled \u201cTo find amus.e.m.e.nt, what else could it be for?\u201dXiao Yao was silent and a moment later said \u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201dXiao Yao and Bei put back on their dog masks and left the gambling den.\u201cWa\u2026.Wait!\u201dA person staggered out behind them wearing cheap rucksack cloth and was cleaned up haphazardly so the blood was wiped off and his hair was pulled back into a bun. If he wasn\u2019t missing a left ear, he would look just like any skinny weak young man.He stuttered at Xiao Yao \u201cJust then, I heard your voice and I remembered your voice. You hugged me once.\u201dXiao Yao was delighted \u201cI remember you, too. I\u2019m so happy you won!\u201d She pointed at Fang Feng Bei \u201cDo you remember him?\u201dFang Feng Bei didn\u2019t turn around and in the dark night only his tall figure was visible. But the young man only saw him in the slave death match arena as wearing a dog mask so he didn\u2019t need to see Bei\u2019s face to recognize him.The young man nodded \u201cI remember! I remember his aura, he came to see me fight to the death. A total of seven times!\u201d The young man suddenly eagerly said to Fang Feng Bei \u201cI\u2019m free and willing to do anything. Can I follow you?\u201dFang Feng Bei coldly replied \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone.\u201dThe young man was disappointed but not despairing. He said to Fang Feng Bei and Xiao Yao \u201cThank you both.\u201dHe turned to leave and Xiao Yao called out \u201cDo you have money?\u201dThe young man\u2019s face was confused likely unclear what money was. Xiao Yao handed him the pouch of money she just won \u201cThis is my winnings from betting on you. Take it because it\u2019s not charity.\u201dThe young man looked down at the cold hard thing in his hand and Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhat is your name? What are you going to do now?\u201dThe young man lifted his head and earnestly replied \u201cThey call me Slave Eleven. I want to see the sea, they all say the sea is so vast.\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cYes, the sea is very vast and very beautiful. You should go see it. Uhm\u2026.can I give you a name?\u201dThe young man looked at her for a long time and then solemnly nodded his head.Xiao Yao thought and then said \u201cYou\u2019re missing a left ear, so how about calling you Left Ear? You have to remember that in the future when people laugh at you for missing an ear, you don\u2019t have to mind because you should be proud that you are missing a left ear.\u201d\u201cLeft Ear?\u201d The young man repeated it a few times and says \u201cMy name is Left Ear!\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cIf you see the view enough or people are mean to you, then you go to Sheng Nong Mountain and find someone named Zhuan Xu, tell him that I recommended you and he\u2019ll find you a job. My name is Xiao Yao, got it?\u201d\u201cSheng Nong Mountain, Zhuan Xu, Xiao Yao\u2026..Left Ear got it.\u201dLeft Ear held the pouch of money Xiao Yao gave him and staggered into the night.Xiao Yao watched his departing figure and suddenly thought about five or six hundred years ago when Xiang Liu escaped the slave death match arena. He ought to have been a young man just like him, but already so world-weary and beaten down, so broken and battered. But like a newborn baby, whatever and whomever he encountered would direct the course of his life going forward.But\u2026.she wasn\u2019t even born yet back then!Bei interrupted her thoughts \u201cHe\u2019s long gone, snap out of it! Let\u2019s go!\u201dXiao Yao walked and talked \u201cI was thinking that when you escaped the slave death match arena, wouldn\u2019t it have been great if I was the one who saved you! If that was the case, then I would let you only be Fang Feng Bei! I really hate that I wasn\u2019t born a few hundred years earlier. I would definitely find you in the slave death match arena\u2026\u2026.\u201dBei stopped and stared at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao turned and stared at him, their eyes meeting in the darkness, wanting to say more but not.Bei reached out his hand as if to caress Xiao Yao\u2019s cheek but the moment he touched her, he jerked his hand back. He glanced behind Xiao Yao and then smirked \u201cBased on you right now wanting to save me? Are you worthy?\u201dXiao Yao tried to explain \u201cI\u2019m not saying General Gong Gong isn\u2019t a good guy, I just think, I just feel\u2026..\u201d\u201cBe quiet!\u201d In that instant Bei appeared to don a full armor, wrapping himself tightly in a deadly aura.Xiao Yao stared warily at Xiang Liu and then slowly backed up.She backed into a familiar embrace \u201cJing?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jing held Xiao Yao and stared at Bei, his eyes full of warning.Bei\u2019s dangerous aura vanished and he laughed \u201cI heard you wanted to break the engagement. You just became clan leader, do you think my sister isn\u2019t good enough for you now?\u201dJing\u2019s deadly aura also vanished \u201cIt\u2019s not that Yi Yang isn\u2019t good, it\u2019s that\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao grabbed Jing and ran \u201cHe\u2019s a lunatic, ignore him!\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know where she wanted to go, but instinctively she ran in the opposite direction of the Tu Shan clan residence.Gradually Xiao Yao got tired and she slowed down and started walking.Walking and walking, Xiao Yao stopped.Jing didn\u2019t wait until she opened her mouth and said \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t leave me.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to leave you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Jing didn\u2019t believe her. He knew her too well, Xiao Yao relied on herself for survival since she was small. Her heart was strong after being forged in independence. She was too logical and cold, she needed nothing and no one. Even if Xiao Yao liked him, but once this like make her feel hurt or difficult, then she would choose to sever it.Xiao Yao honestly said \u201cWhen I saw you become clan leader I was a bit down but not anymore.\u201dJing finally relaxed and held her hand \u201cThank you!\u201d_____________________________Because Zhuan Xu and Feng Long was in dire need of money, the next day after Jing a.s.sumed the clan leader position, he returned to Zhi Yi Castle with Xiao Yao.Jing didn\u2019t go to his own residence and as usual went to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence.The servants were familiar with him and bypa.s.sed announcing him and took him directly to the Evergreen Residence.Xing Yue heard and rushed over \u201cJing gege, you know my Gege doesn\u2019t welcome you here. What is the meaning of this?\u201dJing read a book and relaxed like he was in his own home \u201cI\u2019ll wait until Feng Long kicks me out personally.\u201dXing Yue stared at Xiao Yao who shrugged her shoulders \u201cWhen he wants to be unreasonable, he\u2019s really unreasonable!\u201dXing Yue shot Xiao Yao a glance and the two of them walked out of the room.They stood under an evergreen tree and Xing Yue said \u201cXiao Yao, how could you pick Jing gege over my Gege? How is my Gege any less than him?\u201d\u201cThere is nothing lacking in any way, it\u2019s just like eating a dish, whatever you prefer depends on your personal taste.\u201d\u201cI thought you would become my sister-in-law!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough for you to become my sister-in-law? An older sister-in-law is like an older sister, I want an older sister to be good to me.\u201dXing Yue wasn\u2019t angry at Xiao Yao to begin with and now softened even more. She asked curiously \u201cAre you happy with Jing gege?\u201d\u201cThere are happy times, and there are unhappy times.\u201dXing Yue sighed in solidarity \u201cJust like me. But you\u2019re worse than me. Fang Feng Yi Yang \u2013 even I\u2019m worried for you. I would rather face all the women around your Gege than face one Fang Feng Yi Yang.\u201dThe sound of slamming doors reached them and before Shan Hu and Jing Ye could open the door, the entire gate flew off the hinge.Feng Long angrily rushed in \u201cJing, you dare come here?\u201dXing Yue rushed to stall but Xiao Yao stopped her \u201cLet the men resolve their manly issues.\u201dXing Yue\u2019s face changed \u201cMy Gege\u2019s powers are super strong, if they really start fighting even three Jing gege isn\u2019t able to beat him.\u201dXiao Yao patted her shoulder \u201cNo one will die.\u201dFeng Long stormed into the room and Jing put down his book. Feng Long saw him so at ease and got even angrier and rushed forward to punch Jing in the face.Jing wiped the blood from his lip \u201cI\u2019ll let you three punches, but after that I won\u2019t hold back either.\u201d\u201cHold back? When have you ever held back?\u201d Feng Long punched Jing twice in the stomach and Jing doubled over.Feng Long went to kick Jing and Jing slammed a fist into his kneecap causing Feng Long to almost lose his balance. He was so angry he started punching and kicking and Jing didn\u2019t hold back either and dished it right back. Two powerful high born young G.o.ds with strong powers actually started fighting like two school boys without any concern for their lofty images.The sound of things shattering in the room reached everyone outside and Xing Yue heard it and asked in worry \u201cYou sure no one will die?\u201dXiao Yao said slowly \u201cMaybe get laid up in bed for a few months.\u201dFeng Long and Jing brawled and brawled until it wasn\u2019t clear who stopped first. Neither fought anymore and both laid in complete utter mess on the ground and stared at the ceiling in silence.Feng Long remembered that a young Jing was always courteous and polite, his clothing immaculate, unlike Feng Long who was always messy like a monkey. But one time he yelled at Hou and Jing overheard and Jing immediately got angry and threw a zither at him. The two of them got into a fight right then and there, and even though he was a better fighter than Jing, but once Jing seriously got into a fight he was toast. He vowed then and there never to be mean to Hou again. At that moment he really envied Hou for having a younger brother who would risk it all to protect him. He thought about it for a good half a year and one day his auntie reminded him to be good brothers with Jing, and Feng Long finally figured it out. If he couldn\u2019t have a younger brother who would fight for him, he could have Jing be his older brother!During all these years, Jing never disappointed him. His ambition, his vision, his power drive, he could tell Jing everything. Jing never felt he was being ridiculous or overreaching, and one day he secretly told Jing he wanted to break the Four Great Clans traditions. Jing only smiled \u201cTraditions are created by people, of course it can be broken.\u201d Feng Long asked \u201cWill you help me?\u201d Jing replied \u201cI don\u2019t want the ha.s.sle, but I won\u2019t watch you die either.\u201dAll these years, whatever he thought he could share with Jing and Jing would understand and help him. He never got fed up with cleaning up his messes. He watched Jing and Hou grow apart and secretly was happy because from now on Jing would only be his brother!Actually, he wasn\u2019t angry Jing stole Xiao Yao. He was angry Jing didn\u2019t see him as a real brother. If Jing wanted her, all he needed to do was ask. Why didn\u2019t Jing tell him? If Jing saw Xiao Yao as important as his own life, then how could Feng Long not give her to Jing?Jing finally spoke \u201cBefore Xiao Yao was Xiao Yao, I already liked her. You must wonder why I never told you, that is because I could not tell you. Many times I worried that I wasn\u2019t good enough for her. You, Fang Feng Bei, you are better options for her. No matter who gets close to her, I thinks its better for Xiao Yao. No matter who she chooses, it\u2019ll be happier than with me. I constantly tell myself to give up, but I can\u2019t give up.\u201dFeng Long felt his anger vanish and another anger rose \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not good enough for Xiao Yao! Tu Shan Jing, when did you become such a weakling? Did Hou torment you to the point that your bones are soft now?\u201d Feng Long grabbed Jing around the collar \u201cYou listen to me! My brother is the best so don\u2019t even mention one Xiao Yao, you match up to even ten Xiao Yaos!\u201dJing asked \u201cI\u2019m still your brother?\u201dFeng Long coldly huffed and turned his head to ignore Jing.Jing said \u201cI treat you as my brother and I know you would let me, which is why I dared to openly woo her on your territory.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s annoyance was all gone and he asked \u201cYou said before Xiao Yao was Xiao Yao, you already liked her. What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI met her a long time ago, when she was wandering the world, before she went back to being a Princess.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s anger rose again and he punched Jing \u201cSo you\u2019ve been playing me like I was a monkey!\u201dJing stared \u201cDo you think I want to? How do you think I felt when I watched you be nice to her and try to win her heart.\u201dFeng Long was silent for a moment and then spit out \u201cYou totally deserve it!\u201dJing asked \u201cAre you not angry anymore?\u201dFeng Long got up and snarled \u201cNot yet!\u201d But he extended his hand to help Jing up.Feng Long stared at Jing and started laughing \u201cNo one will believe me if I said that I beat up the Tu Shan clan leader like this.\u201dXing Yue poked her head in the door \u201cAre you guys done fighting? Need a doctor called?\u201dFeng Long coldly harrumphed \u201cPrepare dinner!\u201dXing Yue rolled her eyes at him \u201cGetting into a fight and then throwing an att.i.tude!\u201d She turned and had the maids prepare dinner in the courtyard.Xiao Yao took out a few pills and went to first apply it on Jing before turning to Feng Long \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d She crushed the pulls and it turned into liquid light that seeped into the wounds and after a moment of iciness it eased the pain. Feng Long looked at Jing who smiled back at Xiao Yao and Feng Long.Xiao Yao finished applying medicine on Feng Long and went back to treat Jing again. Xing Yue yelled from the doorway \u201cYou guys are wasting such precious medicines, watch out that you don\u2019t get struck by lightening for such frivolous use!\u201dXing Yue had dinner prepared already and invited Xiao Yao and Jing to sit down next to each other. Xing Yue felt this tableau was familiar and then laughed at Feng Long \u201cThose two! Under our noses they were already guy likes girl, girl likes guy. No wonder that day Xiao Yao sang that song about lovers that made us all swoon.\u201dXiao Yao blushed and lowered her head.Jing said to Feng Long \u201cCall Zhuan Xu here so that Xing Yue stops chattering.\u201dXing Yue blushed \u201cJing gege, how can you!\u201dJing said to Jing Ye \u201cRelease the bird, Zhuan Xu should get the message shortly.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dXing Yue was nervous and said to Feng Long \u201cGege, you see how mean Jing gege is to me!\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cSeeing you normally so in control, seeing Jing tease you and you\u2019re all atwitter. Jing needs to talk to Zhuan Xu about important matters.\u201dXing Yue realized she was totally toyed with by Jing and glared at Xiao Yao \u201cNow you have even stronger backing, I really can\u2019t be mean to you in the future.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Jing, it really was the first time she saw him play tricks like this in jest.Feng Long raised a cup to Jing \u201cYou\u2019re really regained your former glory.\u201dThe two drank to each other.When the dishes arrived, Xiao Yao resumed her usual ways and buried her head in her food.Jing knew all about what Xiao Yao liked and most of his attention was on her. She liked to soak her biscuit in the meat juice so he crushed the biscuit into little pieces and put it in the lamb stew to soak it and picked it out before it got soggy and handed it to her. Xiao Yao had a weird preference, she didn\u2019t like whole pieces of meat and liked the bits fallen on the bottom of the plate because she considered it marinating in all the juices. Jing took out all the pieces on the bottom of his place and handed it to her.Feng Long was chatting with Jing and he was pretty clueless to these things anyways so never noticed. Xing Yue noticed all the details and saw that Jing kept talking to Feng Long but was always paying attention to Xiao Yao. These little things seemed so unimportant but he did it so naturally and with a happiness in his eyes. She watched and was actually a little bit envious of Xiao Yao.Xing Yue suddenly asked \u201cJing gege, are you happy?\u201dJing paused and then nodded \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d He could finally openly sit with Xiao Yao, could take care of Xiao Yao, how could he not be happy?After half an hour, Zhuan Xu arrived.Zhuan Xu bowed in apology to Jing \u201cYour clan leader initiation ceremony, I couldn\u2019t ask my grandfather to send me so I had to miss it. I told Feng Long to go but he was in a p.i.s.sy mood so refused.\u201dJing said \u201cIt was just a ceremony, attending or not doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dZhuan Xu looked at the bruises on Jing\u2019s face and then looked at Feng Long and burst out laughing \u201cYou two are a piece of work! A clan leader and a future clan leader, without any hesitation for important matters. I think the next few days, you two will need to hide at home to heal!\u201dXing Yue worriedly asked \u201cYou came in a rush, did anyone notice?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cToday is not like others, important matters have to be dealt with so its fine if people notice.\u201dJing said to Xing Yue \u201cXiao Yao will stay in her old residence, have someone prepare it.\u201dXing Yue understood what Jing mean and said to Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019ll take you to check it out, if anything is missing let me know and I\u2019ll arrange it.\u201dXiao Yao left the courtyard with Xing Yue and asked \u201cI\u2019m not interested in their stuff, but why are you also stepping out?\u201dXing Yue replied \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell your Gege, then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t tell him.\u201d\u201cMy Gege wants me to stay away from it. He wants me to be a happy woman and the less I\u2019m involved in the men\u2019s affairs the better.\u201d\u201cYour Gege seems rather clueless and obtuse but he gets the important things. He is truly a strategically smart person.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change your mind! My Gege is happy to marry you. He says you\u2019re just like a guy and it\u2019s not bad hanging out for the rest of life together.\u201dXiao Yao felt her temper rise, was Feng Long trying to compliment her? Xiao Yao chuckled \u201cIf Jing doesn\u2019t want me, I\u2019ll cast my lot with your brother.\u201dZhuan Xu chatted with Jing and immediately left, not even coming to see Xiao Yao. Under Jing\u2019s direction, Zhuan Xu and Feng Long\u2019s pressing matter was swiftly resolved,Zhuan Xu could continue to skim money off the Palace renovation. Jing also pa.s.sed all the profit to Xing Yue who then handed it to Feng Long.Jing and the tribal leader of the Li Jie tribe Li Jie Chang had some ties so he introduced him to Zhuan Xu. After Zhuan Xu conferred with Li Jie Chang, the tribe couldn\u2019t contribute money all the time but he was willing to a.s.sign the bravest men in the tribe to take orders from Zhuan Xu.Because Hou made a blood vow not to vie for the clan leader position, he stopped opposing Jing in all areas. Jing didn\u2019t immediately make clear he was supporting Zhuan Xu, but at the clan meeting he make clear that the Tu Shan clan wasn\u2019t going to have close ties with Cang Lin and Yu Yang anymore. Hou gradually distanced himself from Cang Lin and Yu Yang.In the beginning Cang Lin and Yu Yang thought Hou was playing games and if they agreed to back him as clan leader then he would support them as well, only to realize that Hou appeared really no longer going to vie for the clan leader position.Even though Zhuan Xu and Feng Long\u2019s a.s.sociation was very covert, but forty years had pa.s.sed and with the expansion of Zhuan Xu\u2019s power base in the Middle Plains, some things could no longer be concealed. Even the best concealment would reveal cracks and Cang Lin and Yu Yang understood that Feng Long had chosen to support Zhuan Xu.Soon the entire Middle Plains knew that Zhuan Xu and Feng Long were close, but Cang Lin and Yu Yang thought that Zhuan Xu was behind the betrayal of Hou. They started to reevaluate Zhuan Xu and the more they thought about it the more nervous they got. He was a useless piece of trash they sent off to do a thankless task, who expected he could turn into a true power. That this power was independent of the Xuan Yuan influence. Forget them, even the Yellow Emperor would have trouble corralling Zhuan Xu.Cang Lin and Yu Yang called their allies together to discuss how to deal with Zhuan Xu but could not get a common answer.Some thought to immediately take him out.Others thought it was much ado about nothing. Even if Zhuan Xu was close with the Middle Plains families it wasn\u2019t a big deal? All the armed forces was under the control of the Xuan Yuan tribe. As long as the Yellow Emperor didn\u2019t pa.s.s control of the army to Zhuan Xu, then there was nothing Zhuan Xu could do. The way it looked, the Yellow Emperor tossed Zhuan Xu to the Middle Plains and never paid him any attention, clearly he didn\u2019t see him as important. If he was killed now, that would instead alert the Yellow Emperor\u2019s attention and if he changed his mind and summoned Zhuan Xu back to Cao Yun Court, then it would be a greater problem.Someone suggested that the Yellow Emperor was wary of the Middle Plains families and since Zhuan Xu was getting close with them, they could find an opportunity to frame Zhuan Xu for traitorous collusion.Cang Lin and Yu Yang got more and more anxious, not sure whether to get rid of Zhuan Xu or to do nothing for now. The more they thought the more they felt like the third option was the best. Let Zhuan Xu get closer with the Middle Plains families and then wait for the opportunity to lead the Yellow Emperor to removing Zhuan Xu personally.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence waiting has less duration and more a feeling of holding onto a hope. Jing\u2019s fifteen year promise with Xiao Yao is long over since she\u2019s slept thirty-seven years in a clam sh.e.l.l with Xiang Liu already, but that promise no longer matters as Xiao Yao will wait for Jing. She tried to walk away many chapters ago, when Jing first disappointed her and she was actually ready to excise him from her life and end the promise. But she loves him and is clearly putty in his hands, anytime Jing steps up he finds a way to keep holding onto Xiao Yao. Will his intelligence and ability to quietly plot finally break through his grandmother\u2019s insistence that he marry Fang Feng Yi Yang? \u00a0One of my favorite parts of this story is seeing four very capable and confident and powerful characters all working their best to achieve their goals.\u00a0It\u2019s hardest to read Xiang Liu while the other three are like open books.Xiao Yao\u2019s goal is a happy simply life with a man who loves her, Jing\u2019s goal is to be with Xiao Yao, and Zhuan Xu\u2019s goal is to make the world a safe place for Xiao Yao and give her whatever she wants. Xiang Liu\u2019s goal in life is probably like the way he lives as both Xiang Liu and Fang Feng Bei, he has two goals with one personal and one his day job as the General of the Sheng Nong resistance army. His life would be so much simpler if he didn\u2019t run across Xiao Yao and her mouthful of lies in the mountain that day, but just like Xiao Yao ran across a half-dead Jing outside her medical clinic, sometimes fate is one tricky and elusive beast that brings people together only to plunge them into the sweetest kind of angst.\u00a0Everything is starting to come a head and the Jing and Xiao Yao s.h.i.+p will make a clear turn in one direction soon. Xiao Yao will also be given a huge clue to what kind of voodoo bug is linking her with Xiang Liu, but before then she gets a gift from Xiang Liu that she won\u2019t even know is a gift from Xiang Liu. And what a gift it is, tailor-made for her forged from the wonders he scoured from the ends of the world, how much more devastating would it be if she ever found out who made it for her?Chapter 24 \u2013 Love and Hate are Inextricably Tied Together:Jing finished up Zhuan Xu and Feng Long\u2019s pressing matters and prepared to rush back to Qing Qiu to spend time with his grandmother.Xiao Yao initially didn\u2019t want to get involved with the Grand Madam\u2019s situation since if there was a person around the Grand Madam\u00a0who could plant a voodoo bug in her then that person was clearly a voodoo master. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t think her half-a.s.sed knowledge would be any better, but it was still Jing\u2019s grandmother so Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t really not care about her.Xiao Yao said \u201cI want to go with you to see the Grand Madam.\u201dJing knew Xiao Yao\u2019s poison ability was almost unmatched in this world and even if she only used a voodoo bug once it was already powerful enough for Zhuan Xu to have no way to counter it. Jing took her hand \u201cThank you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI might not be able to help so it\u2019s too early for thanks.\u201dJing smiled \u201cI\u2019m not thanking you for doing anything, I\u2019m thanking you for caring.\u201dXiao Yao tossed his hand aside and muttered \u201cWhat care do I have for you, stop a.s.suming things.\u201dJing smiled at Xiao Yao and said nothing and her cheeks turned red.Jing took Xiao Yao back to Qing Qiu and arrived\u00a0just when the Grand Madam had another eruption.Jing rushed in to check on her while Xiao Yao waited outside.The sound of gutwrenching screams filtered out and anyone listening would be quaking in fear. Miao Pu said to Xiao Yao \u201cNo wonder everyone in the vast wilderness turns scared when hearing about voodoo, the bug backfiring is truly scary! The Tu Shan Grand Madam was a widow since she was young and is notorious for being an iron lady. Hearing her pitiful and painful screams, the voodoo bug is really scary.\u201dAfter awhile,\u00a0Jing, Hou, Yi Yang, and Lan Mu walked out of the Grand Madam\u2019s room and the pained expression on Hou and Jing\u2019s face was identical. It was clear they were brothers.Xiao Yao walked up and said to both \u201cCan I see the Grand Madam to diagnose her?\u201dHou and Yi Yang both were stunned. They immediately remembered how Jing wanted to end the engagement and made the connection but still found it such a stretch. Hou asked in shock \u201cWhy is the Princess here?\u201dJing answered for Xiao Yao \u201cI invited her.\u201dOnly the Grand Madam and Jing knew the real reason Jing was unconscious for so long. Yi Yang always thought he was severely injured physically so she never imagined Jing and Xiao Yao getting together. Yi Yang asked Jing \u201cIs it her?\u201dJing said nothing and Yi Yang was flabbergasted and blurt out \u201cHow can it be? How can she ever like you?\u201dYi Yang\u2019s voice was raw with her derision towards Jing that everyone was stunned by what she said. Hou coughed and said to Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my grandmother can\u2019t see guests right now. Princess please leave!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI want to see the Grand Madam because I know voodoo. Before I check her personally I can\u2019t be certain, but if I can help even a little and I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll feel terrible.\u201dHou asked in disbelief \u201cYou know voodoo? That is a Jiu Li tribe secret learning. How would you know it?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI just know it.\u201dJing said to Xiao Yao \u201cLet\u2019s go back and when grandmother is better, I\u2019ll let her know.\u201dJing walked off with Xiao Yao and Hou and Yi Yang watched them leave with perplexed expressions on their face. If it was another woman, she could like Jing for his wealth and position, but Xiao Yao wanted for nothing and even the lofty Feng Long was pursuing her. It was hard to imagine that she could pick any man and she picked Jing!The Grand Madam didn\u2019t want to see Xiao Yao but after Jing pleaded she finally agreed.Jing was the new clan leader and Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want this matter to be bandied about and cause problems later so asked that Hou and Yi Yang was present when she treated the Grand Madam.Xiao Yao walked into the Grand Madam\u2019s residence and saw the Grand Madam, Jing, Hou, and an old woman who was the Grand Madam\u2019s long term doctor named Se Mai Er.The Grand Madam smiled \u201cJing said the Princess you know voodoo?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cA little.\u201dThe Grand Madam pointed to the old woman \u201cHer name is Se Mai Er, she is a Jiu Li tribe woman. She learned voodoo in the tribe and later became a slave. I saved her and brought her back to the Tu Shan clan. I found a doctor for her to learn medicine from. She might not be known in the vast wilderness, but her medical skills are as good as the doctors in the Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan courts.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Se Mai Er and saw her sleeved was embroidered with little colorful moths that looked like b.u.t.terflies to the eye. Xiao Yao remembered the Jiu Li Voodoo King\u2019s manual wrote about these moths and included strange writings next to it. Xiao Yao made a hand gesture to Se Mai Er and then recited the lines from the manual.Se Mai Er\u2019s face changed and she immediately knelt down before Xiao Yao and was agitated and pleading and reverent. She bowed and used voodoo language to speak with Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao learned some Jiu Li voodoo language when she was small from her mom so she could read what the Voodoo King wrote in his manual, but she never lived in Jiu Li so she couldn\u2019t speak it and could only somewhat understand it.Xiao Yao guessed a bit and slowly tried to explain \u201cI am not the next voodoo king, I\u2019m just\u2026..\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for the poison manual left for her by her mom that was written by the Jiu Li Voodoo King, she\u2019d be long dead by now, so it was accurate to say the Voodoo King saved her and Xiao Yao felt great respect for him \u201cThe Voodoo King saved my life and taught me voodoo. I know you didn\u2019t harm anyone and the Voodoo King will not punish you.\u201dSe Mai Er happily bowed to Xiao Yao and said \u201cYou are his disciple.\u201dWas she the Voodoo King\u2019s disciple? Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know but said to Se Mai Er \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone my connection with the Voodoo King.\u201dSe Mai Er agreed and got up after Xiao Yao signaled her to.The Grand Madam and Hou had known Se Mai Er for a hundred years and saw her as always quiet and cold, she was merely respectful to the Grand Madam who saved her life. But right now she was so reverent and respectful of Xiao Yao that everyone now believed Xiao Yao knew voodoo.Se Mai Er said to the Grand Madam \u201cShe can help you, not only lessen your pain, maybe even extend your life.\u201dThe Grand Madam was willing to endure the pain for her grandsons and for the clan, but there was no person who would turn down the offer to lessen the pain or live a but longer. The Grand Madam anxiously looked at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao smiled sheepishly, Se Mai Er was really a true believer of the Voodoo King! She made this promise even before Xiao Yao could diagnose her, but with the knowledge in her brain of the Sheng Nong Herb Manual and the Jiu Liu Poison Voodoo Manual, plus with Se Mai Er around, Xiao Yao was fairly certain she could lessen her pain.Xiao Yao went to check on the Grand Madam who was fully cooperating. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t need to ask Se Mai Er and diagnosed it as a idiotic moth voodooo bug and confirmed it with Se Mai Er who nodded \u201cYes, I raised the idiotic moth voodoo bug.\u201dXiao Yao gained confidence and had already guessed the type of bug in the Grand Madam and already considered how to counter this type of bug.The Grand Madam anxiously looked at Xiao Yao and she said \u201cThe Grand Madam should raise a few canaries! The canaries are the natural enemies of the moths and even the most powerful beings when faced with its natural enemy will shrink in fear. Find canaries that are hundreds of years old with spiritual powers and keep them beside you at all times. It might not lessen the pain but will lengthen the episodes when the moths flare up. It will suppress the moths day after day and let you live at ease more. I\u2019ll go make some pain pills that may lessen the pain during the episodes. I can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll work until after you take it during an episode. If it works, then after you take better care of your health, you may be able to live out a full year.\u201dHou quickly said \u201cI\u2019ll have someone go find the canaries for grandmother.\u201dThe Grand Madam said to Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death but I can\u2019t bear to leave Jing and Hou behind. I hope to see them walk a bit further in life. Thank you Princess.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cGrand Madam, no need for thanks. I\u2019m half a doctor and treating patients is what I do.\u201dThe Grand Madam glanced at Jing and said \u201cIf Princess doesn\u2019t mind, you can call me Grandmother like Jing does.\u201dXiao Yao looked at Jing and he stared at her. She smiled and said \u201cGrandmother.\u201dThe Grand Madam smiled and nodded her head.Xiao Yao had Jing collect all the supplies to brew medicine and the ingredients, then asked for a bowl of Se Mai Er\u2019s blood to use to lure the medicine effect out.The Tu Shan clan was definitely the richest family in the world and their supplies were even more sprawling than even in the Palace. Everything was ready and Xiao Yao started brewing the medicine. She was used to making poisons and this was just a dash different, one was to kill a person, one was to save a person. But the process was about the same so Xiao Yao was really adept at it.Jing used a handkerchief to wipe her sweat \u201cTired?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is so easy compared to making poisons for Xiang Liu.\u201dJing fell silent and then asked \u201cYou\u2019ve still been making poisons for Xiang Liu this whole time?\u201dXiao Yao purposely stared at the fire and casually replied \u201cYes!\u201dJing slowly said \u201cThat night\u2026..I felt that Fang Feng Bei was Xiang Liu.\u201dXiao Yao was startled and didn\u2019t wan\u2019t to lie to Jing but also didn\u2019t want to expose Xiang Liu\u2019s secret so she tiredly said \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss those two guys.\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019ll tend the fire for you and you go rest.\u201dXiao Yao leaned against his shoulder and said \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to do this, it\u2019s light ch.o.r.es so I\u2019ll teach you slowly later on.\u201dOne phrase 'slowly later on\u201d slowly relaxed Jing\u2019s tense heart. He smiled and watched their shadows in the fire as it warmed their figures.After seven days and nights the pills were finished. Little red pills the size of longans but released a bitter sour taste. Xiao Yao handed the pills to the Grand Madam who thanked her. Xiao Yao said \u201cI did the work but Se Mai Er had to give the blood.\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cThe Grand Madam gave me a lot of magical pills and soon I will be all recovered.\u201dThe Grand Madam said \u201cI have to thank both of you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cTake these pills with wine once a day at noon. I made one hundred and nine pills and if it\u2019s useful I will make more.\u201dHou looked at the water clock and said \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon.\u201dXiao Yu brought the wine and Jing and Hou helped the Grand Madam take her pill.The Grand Madam said \u201cWe\u2019ll know tomorrow if it works. Xiao Yu and Se Mai Er are here to a.s.sist so everyone can leave now!\u201dThe next morning, Xiao Yao had just gotten up when the Grand Madam\u2019s maid was at her door. Xiao Yao thought something was wrong with the pills so quickly washed up and rushed to see the Grand Madam.Jing, Hou, Lan Mu, and Yi Yang were all there and the room was filled with light laughter as opposed to the previously somber mood.The Grand Madam saw Xiao Yao and beckoned her over \u201cCome sit next to Grandmother.\u201dYi Yang\u2019s hand clenched into a fist but her expression remained gentle and warm with a beaming smile as if all she cared about was the Grand Madam\u2019s health.Xiao Yao sat down and picked up the Grand Madam\u2019s wrist to take her pulse.The Grand Madam smiled \u201cLast night the bug acted up and it was painful but compared to the days before it was like a cat scratch as opposed to a lion claw.\u201d The Grand Madam patted Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cWhether I can live a few extra day, even by the pain lessening now, you\u2019ve already saved my old life.\u201dXiao Yao let out a sigh of relief \u201cIt works.\u201dXiao Yao got up to leave \u201cI rushed here worried something bad happened. I haven\u2019t eaten yet so I\u2019m off.\u201dThe Grand Madam saw Xiao Yao very casual and didn\u2019t try to get close to her, plus she kept an eye on Xiao Yao secretly these last few days, and had decided Jing had good taste. It was too bad she was a Princess.After Xiao Yao left, the Grand Madam sent everyone away except for Jing.When they were alone, the Grand Madam asked Jing \u201cDo you want to marry the Gao Xing Princess?\u201dJing answered clearly \u201cYes!\u201dThe Grand Madam sighed \u201cIt\u2019s too bad she\u2019s the Gao Xing Princess, and also the granddaughter of the Yellow Emperor! You know the number one rule of our clan is that we do not get involved with politics between the royals. The Four Great Clans have remained so powerful because we do not get involved. Xiao Yao is the Princess but she\u2019s not in Five G.o.ds Mountain but instead by the side of the Xuan Yuan Prince Zhuan Xu. She\u2019s clearly picking sides on the battle for the Xuan Yuan throne succession. She\u2019s not a woman who can be underestimated. I don\u2019t want the Tu Shan clan dragged in. Right now the vast wilderness is at peace but I calculate that the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor and the Gao Xing Grand Emperor will inevitably battle each other. Xiao Yao will bring danger to the Tu Shan clan. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like her, but for the Tu Shan clan, even if your engagement with Yi Yang is dissolved, I still won\u2019t agree to let you marry Xiao Yao.\u201dJing thought his grandmother would see Xiao Yao and change her mind but her mind was even more firmly set. He kneeled down to plead \u201cThe Four Great Clans have their self-preservation rules but rules were set thousands of years ago by ancestors and the situation has changed now. It\u2019s not always correct and we need to change according to the times.\u201dThe Grand Madam\u2019s goodwill towards Xiao Yao evaporated in an instant and she harshly rebuked \u201cYou are the clan leader, how can you say such awful words? You\u2019ve been well-behaved since childhood and when have you became as careless as Feng Long? Did the Gao Xing Princess teach you this?\u201d\u201cNo, Xiao Yao never said this, it\u2019s my own observation after seeing the current situation.\u201dThe Grand Madam didn\u2019t believe him and was sure Xiao Yao pressured him and wanted to use the Tu Shan clan to help Zhuan Xu get the crown \u201cTu Shan Jing, as clan leader you cannot overthrow our ancestral rules for a woman! How can you\u2026..\u201d The Grand Madam couldn\u2019t continue as she pressed her chest to catch her breath.Jing hurriedly transferred power to her \u201cGrandmother, Grandmother, please take care!\u201dThe Grand Madam said \u201cYou promise your grandmother that you\u2019ll give up the Gao Xing Princess.\u201dJing remained kneeling and said nothing, only bowing his head repeatedly.The Grand Madam saw the despair in his eyes and said forlornly \u201cYou wretch!\u201d She stroked his head and cried \u201cJing, don\u2019t hate grandmother, this is what must be!\u201d__________________________________Xiao Yao practiced her archery for an hour and felt a bit tired and handed her bow to Shan Hu before heading to check on JIng.As she left her residence, she strolled along the forest lane leisurely since she loved the crisp Autumn air and the red leaves out. She took her time and took the long route heading up the mountain to a pavilion to rest a bit and enjoy the view.Miao Pu tugged her sleeve and whispered \u201cPrincess, look!\u201dXiao Yao looked at the direction she pointed, and after she was injured and her body took in a lot of Xiang Liu\u2019s essential soul blood, there were a lot of changes and one of it was much farther and sharper vision. She saw at the bottom of the mountain lane Jing and Yi Yang walking alongside each other. It wasn\u2019t clear what they were talking about but their footsteps appeared slow.They arrived at Jing\u2019s residence and he stopped to bid Yi Yang farewell. She suddenly embraced him and appeared to be crying as her body shook. She looked like a flower in the rain, sad and frail, as if needing protection.Jing wanted to push her away but her powers were strong so he pushed a few times but she wouldn\u2019t budge and instead held on tighter to him. He was still a gentleman so he couldn\u2019t rebuke a crying woman so he could only try to avoid her.Miao Pu said \u201cMaster Jing is too soft-hearted. Some women are like vines, seemingly weak but clinging on ever tighter.\u201dXiao Yao walked out of the pavilion and headed towards Jing\u2019s residence. Maio Pu said \u201cIf Princess is annoyed, tell His highness and he\u2019ll have an idea to chase Fang Feng Yi Yang away.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWe\u2019re not even together and I need Gege to help solve the problem. Later when we are together and it\u2019s forever, we\u2019ll face all sorts of problems. Should I have my Gege help me each and every time?\u201dMiao Pu stuck out her tongue and giggled \u201cHis highness will be happy to solve Princess\u2019s problems for the rest of your life.\u201dXiao Yao strolled another turn in the forest before heading back.Shan Hu saw then return and asked \u201cWas Master Jing busy, you\u2019re back so soon?\u201dMiao Pu gave Shan Hu a look and Shan Hu immediately changed the topic \u201cPrincess, are you thirsty? When we were leaving, Miss Xing Yue gave me some evergreen flowers and I\u2019ll go brew you some evergreen honey water.\u201dThat afternoon Jing came to see Xiao Yao and he looked thoroughly exhausted. Xiao Yao pretended not to notice and said nothing. The two silently sat for a bit and Xiao Yao pa.s.sed him a cup of evergreen flower honey \u201cThis time I came to Qing Qiu with you for the Grand Madam\u2019s illness. Now she\u2019s stabilized, and takes her pills regularly and I send more on a regular basis, that ought to be enough. I\u2019m going to head back now.\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019m going to Zhi Yi Castle in a few days, let\u2019s go together then!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThe truth is that I\u2019m not accustomed to staying here. You know my personality, casual and lazy. I can\u2019t even stay in Five G.o.ds Mountain and my dad knows it which is why he allows me to wander around the world. If I stay here I need to watch what I say and do for the sake of my dad and my grandfather. I can\u2019t be myself.\u201dJing quickly said \u201cThen I\u2019ll send someone to escort you back. I\u2019ll spend some time with my grandmother and then go to Zhi Yi.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and nodded her head._____________________________________The second day Xiao Yao left with Shan Hu and Miao Pu but didn\u2019t go to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and instead went to Sheng Nong Mountain\u2019s Zhi Jin Summit.Zhuan Xu was inspecting a renovation site so wasn\u2019t in Zhi Jin Palace. Jin Xuan settled Xiao Yao in a residence.That night Zhuan Xu came back and found Xiao Yao laying in the courtyard staring at the stars. He went inside to grab a blanket to cover her and then laid down next to her. \u201cThe tired bird come back to the nest?\u201d\u201cYup!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cJing couldn\u2019t have antic.i.p.ated the Grand Madam having only another year left and it messed up his plans. Fang Feng Yi Yang also couldn\u2019t have expected that with Jing as the clan leader now, if the Grand Madam died then the Tu Shan clan cannot restrict his plans anymore. So no one will help Fang Feng Yi Yang to marry Jing so she needs to rush the marriage now before the Grand Madam dies. She was always anxious but with you suddenly appearing in Qing Qiu, it would be like her greatest enemy showing up on her front step. She\u2019s going to use every way to cling onto Jing. So you shouldn\u2019t blame Jing too much for what happened and let it go.\u201dXiao Yao knew Miao Pu would tell Zhuan Xu about it so wasn\u2019t surprised \u201cI don\u2019t know if you a.s.signed me Miao Pu to protect me or keep tabs on me.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cYou think Shan Hu doesn\u2019t report everything about you to Master? This is what caring is, like a warm blanket on a cold night, but pressed on it feels like a burden. We can control ourselves to each just a.s.sign one person to you so you should count your lucky stars!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI want to go back to Gao Xing and see my dad. Any word you want me to bring?\u201d\u201cNo, but I have presents for Consort Jing An and Ah Nian. When are you going back?\u201d\u201cIf your present is ready by tomorrow, I\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled wanly \u201cAre you missing Master or trying to avoid Jing?\u201d\u201cBoth. From when I woke up until Jing took over as clan leader, we have both been forced into decisions due to the circ.u.mstances. No matter what he\u2019s now the clan leader and carries the future of his entire clan on his back. I feel like he needs to settle down and we both need to a.s.sess our new roles in life and decide what we each need.\u201d\u201cYou keep talking about him, but what about yourself? What do you think?\u201dXiao Yao flipped over and rest her chin on the pillow and stared at Zhuan Xu \u201cForget me, I\u2019m the same as you! We appear to be two extremes but we\u2019re the same. We will never actively fight for something, because we\u2019re afraid that it\u2019s a mistake to fight for it to begin with. We are both so reactive hoping the choice picks us.\u201dZhuan Xu looked torn and glanced at Xiao Yao before laughing \u201cI\u2019m different than you, I don\u2019t care about romance.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThis is different, I want someone to spend an entire life with me, but you\u2019ve chosen to spend your entire life with power.\u201dZhuan Xu rubbed her head and sighed \u201cThe presents will be ready tomorrow, you leave tomorrow then! Go rest in Five G.o.ds Mountain and if you get bored then go fight with Ah Nian.\u201dXiao Yao laughed out loud \u201cWhat kind of Gege are you? Encouraging your two sisters to fight?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cOnly siblings can fight and still keep on fighting in the future. Friends would be strangers already after fighting. Ah Nian is just innocent but not stupid. You angered her to leave last time, she likely already figured out what you did to protect her.\u201d_________________________Xiao Yao returned to Five G.o.ds Mountain with Shan Hu and Miao Pu accompanying her.It was early Winter in the Middle Plains but still warm like Spring in Gao Xing. Xiao Yao resumed her previous leisurely life, practicing archery in the morning, making poisons in the afternoon, but now she added one more hobby which was to start learning more medicine.One day the Grand Emperor finished court early and came to watch Xiao Yao practice archery.Xiao Yao finished a hard practice and went to sit beside her dad, her hair was mussed and she took our her gorilla mirror to fix her hair and asked \u201cDad, how\u2019s my archery skill?\u201dThe Grand Emperor nodded and took Xiao Yao\u2019s hand to examine her callouses \u201cYour persistence with archery is beyond what I expected. Xiao Yao, why do you desire such ability? Is it because we don\u2019t make you feel safe enough?\u201dXiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head and smiled \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you all, it\u2019s that I\u2019m used to years of taking care of myself. I\u2019ve got so much time on my hands I ought to find things to do.\u201dXiao Yao pulled her hand back to put her mirror away but the Grand Emperor grabbed it and waved his hand across. The image of Xiang Liu swimming in the ocean depths appeared and Xiao Yao stared in a daze. Even though when she was unconscious Xiang Liu told her to erase the images, but after she woke up he didn\u2019t mention it again so she had forgotten about it.The Grand Emperor asked \u201cIs he Nine-lives Xiang Liu? This time, he was the one who saved you?\u201dXiao Liu answered in a low voice \u201cYes.\u201dThe Grand Emperor covered the mirror with his hand and the image of Xiang Liu disappeared.The Grand Emperor said \u201cXiao Yao, I don\u2019t restrict your freedom but as your father I beg of you \u2013 do not have any relations.h.i.+p with him. He\u2019s exactly on the opposite side of Zhuan Xu and your blood line has already made the choice for you.\u201d The Grand Emperor had already seen one tragedy before, he didn\u2019t want to see the same tragedy with Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao took the mirror back and smiled \u201cDad, what are you thinking about? My interactions with him have always been a transaction. He saved me because he made a deal with Zhuan Xu.\u201dThe Grand Emperor sighed \u201cYou need to remember this well, I would rather have the entire world vilify and castigate me for eliminating the entire Fang Feng family if that is what it takes to s.n.a.t.c.h that Tu Shan clan\u2019s little fox for you. That is preferable than you having anything to do with Xiang Liu.\u201dXiao Yao made a funny face to her dad and laughed \u201cOkay, okay, I remember! Daddy who likes to lecture, your subordinates are all waiting for you!\u201dThere was a day when he was called someone who liked to lecture? The Grand Emperor rapped Xiao Yao on the head and left.Xiao Yao lowered her head to stare at the gorilla mirror, and gradually her smile disappeared completely.______________________________The Grand Emperor watched Xiao Yao\u2019s archery practice and summoned the most famed weapons forger in the Jin Tian family to make a bow for Xiao Yao.To have her own bow, and forged by the mysterious Jin Tian family, even the casual Xiao Yao got all dressed up to solemnly await the master forger.A young girl with apple cheeks, her hair in two braids, wearing raggedy clothes walked in and checked Xiao Yao out \u201cMake a bow for you? Your powers are so weak and you want a bow to kill people? The clan leader didn\u2019t lie to me, this really is a very challenging project!\u201dXiao Yao incredulously asked \u201cAre you the master forger who is making my bow?\u201dThe girl lifted her chin \u201cI am Xing Shen, the most talented forger in the Jin Tian family. If my clan leader didn\u2019t keep saying this would be a challenging project, even if His majesty asks I would turn him down.\u201dXiao Yao bowed \u201cPlease will you a.s.sist.\u201dXing Shen saw Xiao Yao\u2019s humble request and nodded her head happily. She took out a bow and had Xiao Yao shoot it. Xiao Yao shot ten straight arrows and Xing Shen nodded her head. She had Xiao Yao stand still and took out her tools to quickly make a Xiao Yao doll. Then she looked at Xiao Yao\u2019s palms and her face registered confusion.She asked \u201cAny requirements for the bow? Like color, shape, added features, etc.\u201dXiao Yao answered \u201cOne requirement \u2013 it can kill a person!\u201dXing Shen was stunned and said \u201cI really wonder if you\u2019re a woman.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cI wonder the same thing about you.\u201dXing Shen laughed out loud \u201cI\u2019m going back to think about it. When the weapon is ready I\u2019ll contact you. Fast is ten to twenty years, slow might be a hundred years. So don\u2019t think too much about it!\u201dStrangely a month later, Xing Shen came to find Xiao Yao and said \u201cYour people killing bow is almost ready.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned \u201cThat fast?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fast, this bow was commissioned by someone else and has been forged for the past thirty five years. He suddenly changed his mind and doesn\u2019t want it. I think it\u2019s suitable for you so decided to give it to you.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s it, I\u2019m so lucky!\u201dXing Shen nodded \u201cYour lucky isn\u2019t just any luck, you have no idea what this bow is made out of. The most rare materials in the entire vast wilderness \u2013 mermaid bones, monster fish ruby, undersea bamboo, demon clam blood, star sand from the Heavens, the moon stone which can collect all the essence from the moon\u2026..\u201dThe more Xing Shen said the more in awe she was but Xiao Yao was totally clueless. Xing Shen knew Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know just how\u00a0rare those precious items were \u201cJust know that it\u2019s the most rare precious things in the entire world. Even if His majesty wanted to gather it all, he would have a hard time doing so! I really don\u2019t know how that guy managed to collect all these materials for the bow!\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t want such a weapon?\u201dXing Shen furrowed her brow \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want it means he doesn\u2019t want it! What could be the reason? It\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t make it the best!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI believe you!\u201dXing Shen smiled \u201cSuch an amazing weapon I would rather destroy instead of giving to just anyone, but I think you\u2019re not bad so decided to give it to you.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cCan I ask out of curiosity \u2013 who commissioned it?\u201dXing Shen said \u201cI don\u2019t know either, I just know the guy is connected with the Gui Fang clan. Every time he meets with me, he wears a large black robe, a hat covering his entire head, he\u2019s wrapped snugly from head to toe.\u201d\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s Gui Fang clan?\u201d\u201cWhen he came to the Jin Tian family, he held a token of the Gui Fang clan leader. The Jin Tian family is indebted to the Gui Fang clan so the clan leader had me forge a weapon for him. I didn\u2019t want to accept but my clan leader said he wanted a bow that would allow someone with weak powers to kill someone with strong powers. I had never heard of such a request so decided to meet him. He handed me a few designs and it was all flawed, but then I realized I could design something that could meet his requirements.\u201d Xing Shen quieted and scratched her head \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t possibly know you, it\u2019s like he commissioned that bow specifically for you! Are you sure you two don\u2019t know each other?\u201dXiao Yao thought about the Gui Fang clan leader token and knew the person had strong ties with the Gui Fang clan. The only person she knew who had any ties with the Gui Fang clan was Zhuan Xu so Xiao Yao laughed \u201cIt can\u2019t be someone I know. Having a bow commissioned for me is a nice thing so who would\u2019t tell me. I wouldn\u2019t turn it down!\u201dXing Shen nodded \u201cThe materials used to make this bow is so G.o.dd.a.m.n awesome plus it took me thirty five years to make it, this is definitely the best work I have ever made to date. But\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao was listening happily until the \u201cbut\u201d and she asked \u201cBut what?\u201d\u201cBut the bow needs to recognize its owner.\u201d\u201cLots of weapons need to recognize its owner.\u201d\u201cThis bow is harder to tame than the best wild stallion in the world. It\u2019s requirements are unique, but since you\u2019re a Princess, His majesty can likely solve the problem for you.\u201d\u201cHow to solve it?\u201d\u201cIt needs the blood of the King of the Seas the Nine-headed demon. Plus it needs to be blood from a full moon.\u201d Xing Shen chuckled and felt that this requirement really was ridiculous \u201cThe only Nine-headed demon I have ever heard of in the vast wilderness is that Nine-lives Xiang Liu. I heard he\u2019s difficult to deal with but you\u2019re a Princess! You\u2019re dad is the Grand Emperor! You guys can find a way!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes were in a daze and she couldn\u2019t speak for the longest time.Xing Shen twirled her head and laughed \u201cAnd even the owner recognizing method sure is unique as well.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Xing Shen and Xing Shen slowly explained \u201cThe blood of the nine-headed demon isn\u2019t to feed to the weapon, it\u2019s for the weapon owner to drink, then the weapon owner uses her own blood afterwards to feed to the weapon.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Xing Shen and couldn\u2019t smile or frown \u201cNo wonder no one wants this bow.\u201dXing Shen\u2019s dry laugh confirmed it \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, being made of so many rare treasures, only the blood of the nine-headed demon can control it completely.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and said nothing. Xing Shen didn\u2019t know that Xiang Liu used poisons to train so his blood couldn\u2019t be ingested at all! Perhaps that guy knew something which is why he gave up.Xing Shen said \u201cPrincess, this really is a one-of-a-kind extraordinary bow, I guarantee you won\u2019t regret having it.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhen can the owner recognition take place?\u201dXing Shen said \u201cAny full moon night.\u201d\u201cFine, then this full moon night I\u2019ll go see you.\u201dXing Shen\u2019s eyes were saucer wide \u201cPrincess means this month? Two days from now?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cNine-headed demon?\u201d\u201cYou said I was a Princess, my dad is the Grand Emperor!\u201dXing Shen laughed \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go prepare immediately and see you in two days in Jin Tian Canyon.\u201dFull moon night, Jin Tian Canyon.The servant led Xiao Yao into a spiritual circle created by Shen Xing.In the distance there was a waterfall with water brought from the holy Yang Valley that was used just to forge weapons. There was an eternal hot volcano to the right of the waterfall which seemed like a red ruby if it didn\u2019t emit heat.Xing Shen still looked raggedy with her hair in two disheveled braids but she was wearing a pure white ceremonial robe and appeared solemn and reserved.She asked Xiao Yao \u201cAre you prepared?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYes!\u201dXing Shen looked at the full moon above and began to recite chants. Her voice started slow but gradually got faster and faster and the volcanic fire started bubbling and turning the entire sky red.At Xing Shen\u2019s final chant the volcano erupted in full and sent sparks shooting into the air like dancing flames, and then one white arc cut through the red like a caged bird freed from captivity.Xing Shen had her hands clenched in a spell as she chanted but the white light totally ignored her and danced in the sky. Xing Shen\u2019s face turned white and her sweat dripped down and she bit her own tongue tip and the white light finally reluctantly came down from the sky.As it\u2019s speed slowed, Xiao Yao finally saw that it was a silver white bow without any marking on it, it was so beautiful Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t turn her eyes away. Xiao Yao walked forward and reached out her hand to the sky and the bow slid down on her arm like a silver white crescent moon,The bow started slicing her arm, slice after deep slice it cut so deep her bone was exposed.Xiao Yao felt the pain as the bow demanded to know how she had the right to own it. If Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t answer, the bow would destroy her body.But as the bow sampled her blood, it quieted down and was finally subdued.Xiao Yao ordered it \u201cFold!\u201dThe silver white bow entered her arm and disappeared, leaving only the mark of a crescent moon shaped bow on her arm, like a beautiful tattoo.Xing Shen sat down on the ground \u201cNow you know why I said there had to be the blood from a nine-headed demon.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThank you!\u201dXing Shen took a few pills and wiped her sweat \u201cNo need! It\u2019s was coincidence and luck that this bow was meant to be yours. Next time when I want something from His majesty, I won\u2019t hold back!\u201dXiao Yao put medicine on her cuts and said \u201cWant me to check what treasures my dad has squirreled away?\u201dXing Shen shook her head \u201cI already know what I want.\u201dXing Shen regained her strength and stood up to walk Xiao Yao out \u201cYour powers are low so you can only shoot three arrows a day. Use wisely!\u201dXiao Yao genuinely thank her \u201cFor someone who is nearly useless, three times a day is more than enough!\u201dXing Shen looked at the thick callouses on Xiao Yao\u2019s hands and sighed \u201cI don\u2019t deserve the thanks, you grabbed this from the Heavens own hands!\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe that a Princess could be so tough on herself.________________________________Xiao Yao stayed in Five G.o.ds Mountain for nearly three months.She calculated the Grand Madam\u2019s pills were almost done and she needed to go back. Xiao Yao went to say her goodbyes to her dad.She didn\u2019t see Ah Nian much and occasionally both would dine with the Grand Emperor and never said much to each other.Hearing Xiao Yao was leaving, Ah Nian came to find her \u201cYou\u2019re leaving for Sheng Nong Mountain tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI hear Zhuan Xu gege is all good again now and doesn\u2019t screw around with bad influences.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cDaddy said Zhuan Xu gege was just acting back then.\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cHe was.\u201dAh Nian glared at Xiao Yao \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me back then, why have me misunderstand Zhuan Xu gege?\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu didn\u2019t tell me back then either and I knew what you knew. What could I say to you. Would you have accepted my own conclusion?\u201dAh Nian heard Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t tell Xiao Yao and felt better and asked \u201cI, I want to go to Sheng Nong Mountain with you. Can I?\u201dAh Nian actually lowered herself to Xiao Yao for Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao sighed \u201cI heard Dad has been picking your future husband for you. There is no one in Gao Xing you like?\u201dAh Nian\u2019s face turned red and white \u201cNo one can match up to Zhuan Xu gege.\u201dXiao Yao sighed again and patted the seat next to her \u201cLittle sister, come here.\u201dAh Nian actually docilely sat down next to Xiao Yao \u201cYou are my little sister so I actually don\u2019t want you to like Zhuan Xu.\u201dXiao Yao thought Ah Nian would fly into a rage but Ah Nian sat there in silence. Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, back then Zhuan Xu was acting but it\u2019s a reality that he has a lot of women in his life. I already know three, and the ones I don\u2019t even know about, I\u2019m sure are out there.\u201dAh Nian said in a low voice \u201cI heard a bit, he has two exquisite maids beside him that he\u2019ll take as concubines eventually.\u201d\u201cNot just those women! Later when a woman likes him or wants to follow him and is of help to him, and he doesn\u2019t dislike them, he\u2019ll accept them all\u201d Xiao Yao chuckled sadly \u201cActually I\u2019m wrong! If she\u2019s of use to him, even if he dislikes her, he\u2019ll still accept her.\u201dAh Nian stared at Xiao Yao in confusion and Xiao Yao explained \u201cWhen our Dad rejected taking an Empress from one of the Gao Xing four tribes, other than you and I, no one else in Gao Xing was happy with Dad\u2019s decision. Actually, if Dad had done so, then there wouldn\u2019t even have been the Five Prince Rebellion in the first place! To quell the rebellion so many lives were lost and so many families impacted. Many still hold a grudge against Dad. If Zhuan Xu was Dad, he wouldn\u2019t have rejected taking that Empress because sometimes having one woman can lessen a conflict. Fewer people need to die and a battle can be avoided. How do you think Zhuan Xu will choose going forward?\u201dAh Nian\u2019s mouth dropped open but she couldn\u2019t say anything.Xiao Yao sighed \u201cI actually don\u2019t like Zhuan Xu like this. But because I lived in the world for hundreds of years as a normal person so I support Zhuan Xu\u2019s decision to better the world. This is what it means for One to Suffer, the World to Better.\u201dAh Nian was silent but her eyes were filled with sadness.Xiao Yao said \u201cLittle sister, I don\u2019t want you to like Zhuan Xu. Have Dad pick a husband for you in Gao Xing and forget him.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s tears fell \u201cI want to forget him! But I\u2019ve known him from the moment I was born. My mom is deaf and mute and dad is always busy with work. I talked late when I was small so people thought I was deaf and mute too. But he never lost patience with me, always telling me over and over to call him Gege. To coax me to talk, he mimicked bird sounds. When people mocked my mom behind her back, I would hide in the corner and cry but he encouraged me to fight back. Even when he left home he would always remember to send me a present every year. From young until now, he\u2019s the only one by my side. All my memories contain him. How do you want me to forget? How can I find a man now who knows me as well, understands all my likes and dislikes. Even if he gives me just one tenth of himself, it\u2019s better than another man giving me one hundred percent of himself.\u201dAh Nian wiped her tears away \u201cI know you mean well and really see me as your little sister which is why you said all this to me. But I tried for forty years to forget him but I can\u2019t do it! I thought about it over and over and finally realized that in this world, other than dad, what man doesn\u2019t have many wives. Even if Zhuan Xu gege has other women, as long as he\u2019s always good to me, then I care about nothing else.\u201dXiao Yao was filled with pity and anger \u201cYou, you, why can\u2019t you be more hard with yourself? It\u2019s just leaving one man, how can you not go on with life? It\u2019s just like a cut on the heart in pain.\u201dAh Nian cried \u201cI\u2019m not like you and Dad! I don\u2019t have your strength to cut the heart and still smile and live life. All I know is that if I lost Zhuan Xu gege, everyday no matter what I do I won\u2019t be happy. I would rather die!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making Dad really pained to see you like this.\u201dAh Nian wiped her years \u201cDad knows, otherwise how else would I know about the other women around Zhuan Xu gege. Dad\u2019s servant told me and also said Zhuan Xu gege will marry Sheng Nong Xing Yue. I know Dad is doing this to end my hopes but I told Dad I can\u2019t ever forget him!\u201dXiao Yao was in disbelief. Never forgetting? With the long lives of the G.o.ds, how can one never forget another?Ah Nian begged \u201cJiejie (older sister), other than my mom and our dad, only you can help me! Jiejie, help me please!\u201dXing Yue also called Xiao Yao jiejie once, but Ah Nian\u2019s one \u201cjiejie\u201d totally twisted Xiao Yao\u2019s heart into a knot and she racked her brains but had nothing to dissuade Ah Nian. Xiao Yao wearily said \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Dad, you go wait.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201dXiao Yao had no choice but to see the Grand Emperor immediately.She found him standing right outside her residence by the water tree.Xiao Yao walked over and put her hand behind her back and looked up at the Grand Emperor \u201cDad, you knew I would come see you?\u201d\u201cAh Nian wants to go to Sheng Nong Mountain with you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Grand Emperor looked up at the endless starry skies \u201cXiao Yao, should I let Ah Nian go?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIn forty years, I believed Dad you tried your best but the result is as you see. If we object Ah Nian won\u2019t listen. Dad, if you want to stop her then you need to use the hard way. If you want to force her to marry another man, then you can do it. But can you bear doing it?\u201dLooking at the constellations in the sky, the Grand Emperor vividly remembered taking someone with him up into the Heavens to view the constellations and said \u201cYour mother and I was a political marriage. Before you two grew up, I already decided that I don\u2019t want my daughters to experience the same pain your mom went through. I will never use your marriage for political gain, and I won\u2019t force your marriage in any way. I will let you be with the man you love.\u201dXiao Yao felt her heart ache and she purposely looked at the stars to quell her tears \u201cDad, I said all sorts of bad things about Zhuan Xu to Ah Nian to try and change her mind. But speaking candidly, even if you picked a husband for Ah Nian you can\u2019t guarantee he will be good to her for her entire life. You can\u2019t guarantee he really likes her and isn\u2019t doing it because of your influence. You can\u2019t guarantee that after he marries Ah Nian he won\u2019t fall for another woman.\u201dThe Grand Emperor stiffly said \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee his heart but I can guarantee his character.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cHaven\u2019t Dad you heard of sneaking around, the more you try to control the more sneaking will be done. What\u2019s the point of getting a guy like that. I kinda understand Ah Nian now, a real man with character and drive, a guy like Ru So, he doesn\u2019t want to marry Ah Nian. The ones who want her can\u2019t match up to Zhuan Xu. He watched Ah Nian grow up and truly loves her without any additional reason. Ah Nian seems clueless but she sees the important stuff, she knows which guy is really good to her. What she said just now is right, compared to any of those guys giving her everything, she would rather have just a part of Zhuan Xu.\u201dThe Grand Emperor was silent and then asked \u201cXiao Yao, do you think Ah Nian will be happy with Zhuan Xu?\u201d He controlled the lives of countless but he was truly uncertain about his daughters future.\u201cAh Nian doesn\u2019t want to be his only, she just wants Zhuan Xu to be good to her for the rest of her life. I believe in Gege, and his feelings for Ah Nian since they grew up together. Ah Nian should be happy, even though it\u2019s not a happiness I can accept. Just like I see Consort Jing An and don\u2019t think that is happiness, but to her she is happy. What is happiness really? It\u2019s merely a person getting what he or she wants, even if in the eyes of others it\u2019s completely worthless.\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled wanly \u201cYou\u2019re mocking your own dad?\u201dXiao Yao stuck her tongue out \u201cYour majesty please forgive. Dad, since Ah Nian can\u2019t forget him in forty years, its only made her remember more about Zhuan Xu\u2019s good. Let her go see for herself and live what it\u2019s like to see other women around Zhuan Xu. Let her suffer and perhaps she\u2019ll actually give him up that way.\u201dThe Grand Emperor thought and said \u201cTake Ah Nian to Sheng Nong Mountain! Without looking after her, I feel better.\u201dXiao Yao got on tippy toes to ease the furrowed brow of her dad \u201cDad, Ah Nian isn\u2019t alone, we have you behind us! No matter who she marries, that person won\u2019t mistreat her! The person who ought to be worried now isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s Zhuan Xu!\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled \u201cYou! Don\u2019t worry about lessening our worries and keep all your worries inside!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cDad don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m different than Ah Nian, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dThe Grand Emperor sighed, because Xiao Yao was so different than Ah Nian, he didn\u2019t know how to start worrying about her, which was what worried him the most._______________________________At dawn Xiao Yao and Ah Nian set off for Sheng Nong Mountain.Xiao Yao mischievous streak came out and ordered no one to tell Zhuan Xu, and even Miao Pu didn\u2019t know Ah Nian was coming as well until they departed.It was dusk by the time they arrived and there had been a fresh snow storm a few days ago so the entire Zhi Jin Court was covered in glittery white snow. Zhuan Xu worried Xiao Yao was dressed too lightly so when he heard her cloud carriage arrive he rushed outside with a ermine cloak waiting for her. He saw the cloud carriage descend and rushed over, but the door opened and two equally exquisite girls jumped off simultaneously and yelled \u201cGege!\u201dZhuan Xu froze and didn\u2019t know who to put the cloak on.Xiao Yao smiled and ran across the snow into the court chamber where Xiao Xiao had another cloak and Xiao Yao wrapped herself snugly in it before peering outside.Zhuan Xu put the cloak around Ah Nian \u201cKnowing it\u2019s dead of Winter in the Middle Plains, how come you\u2019re not wearing warmer clothes?\u201dAh Nian\u2019s eyes were red rimmed \u201cGege, I left without saying goodbye because I misunderstood you. Aren\u2019t you angry at me?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and sc.r.a.ped her nose \u201cIf I\u2019m angry at you for that then I\u2019ll already have angered myself to death by you! Hurry inside, it\u2019s freezing out here.\u201dZhuan Xu led Ah Nian inside and said \u201cThe plum blossoms on the mountain top are all blooming, I\u2019ll take you to see. It\u2019s more beautiful than the plum blossoms I planted for you in Qing Shui Town.Ah Nian smiled \u201cA present from Gege was a plum blossom vase which looked like it was drawn by you. Was it a plum blossom from this mountain?\u201d\u201cYou guessed right. One time I saw a beautiful one and remembered that you like plum blossoms so painted it and have it made into a vase.\u201dAh Nian was so happy \u201cI figured you weren\u2019t coming back to Gao Xing anytime soon so I dug out the wine we buried in the bamboo forest and brought it here.\u201dAh Nian was dim and wan in Gao Xing, but right now she was like a flower blooming after a rain shower, sparkling with life. Xiao Yao thought that no matter what happened in the future, at least Ah Nian was happy now. Perhaps this was why Ah Nian refused to give up.After dinner, Xiao Yao used the excuse of being tired to head back to her room and let Zhuan Xu spend time with Ah Nian. She had not seen him in over forty years and would obviously like to be alone with him.Xiao Yao bathed and Shan Hu was drying her hair when Xiao Xiao came in with a jug of wine \u201cThis is the wine the Second Princess brought, His highness asked me to bring it for Princess.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThis is the wine Gege made years ago? Put it there, I\u2019ll drink it in a bit.\u201dXiao Yao leaned against the pallet and slowly drank the wine and sighed.\u201cWho are you sighing for? Who are you worried about?\u201d Zhuan Xu parted the veil and walked inside.\u201cWhere\u2019s Ah Nian?\u201d\u201cPa.s.sed out drunk, Hai Tang took her to rest.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhat? You want to drink some more with me?\u201dZhuan Xu sat at the end of the pallet and poured himself a cup \u201cWhy did you bring Ah Nian?\u201d\u201cShe wanted to see you, I let her follow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d\u201cI remember you told me to stay away from Ah Nian.\u201d\u201cEven if she\u2019s my little sister, I have no right to make her decisions.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled bitterly \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201dXiao Yao smiled wickedly \u201cJust remember that Ah Nian is your Master\u2019s daughter and my little sister.\u201dZhuan Xu held his forehead and pain \u201cI have so much things to deal with, now is not the time for Ah Nian to be here.\u201dXiao Yao waved her hands like she can\u2019t help so it\u2019s all his problem now.Zhuan Xu said \u201cTu Shan Jing is at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence. When are you going to see him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow, I want to go to Qing Qiu with him to see the Grand Madam and make more medicine for her. I\u2019ll be back in a week or so, take care of Ah Nian for me.\u201dZhuan Xu held his wine and grinned at Xiao Yao until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore \u201cIs he well these days?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cYou want me to tell you?\u201d\u201cGege!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cAfter you left, he came about ten days later to see you and learned you went back to Gao Xing. His face darkened and I guaranteed you would come back before he relaxed a bit. But recently he\u2019s been odd, Xing Yue says he spends all night pacing in the Evergreen residence and likes to bath and change often.\u201d\u201cBath? Change clothes?\u201d Xiao Yao remembered when Fang Feng Yi Yang hugged him that time, he changed afterwards before seeing her.Zhuan Xu said \u201cI see Jing won\u2019t end the engagement while the Grand Madam is still alive and will wait until she\u2019s dead. Actually I can\u2019t figure Tu Shan Jing out. Feng Long seems smart and bold, but I can control him because I know what he wants. Tu Shan Jing seems mild and gentle but he\u2019s like creek water, impossible to grasp and hold. I can\u2019t rein him. He appears to really want to be with you but he does nothing concrete. To get the Fang Feng clan to end the engagement, there are ways to force it!\u201dXiao Yao glared \u201cIs the Fang Feng family causing trouble for you so you want Jing to take them out?\u201dZhuan Xu yelled back \u201cI\u2019m upset for you!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI get your point, as long as Fang Feng Yi Yang\u2019s life and death doesn\u2019t matter, then there is a way to end the engagement and even get rid of her. Once she\u2019s dead, the wedding is off. But the engagement was set by Jing\u2019s mom and grandmother, Fang Feng Yi Yang just wants to be the clan leader\u2019s wife and hasn\u2019t done anything really bad to Jing. Honestly, if Jing was like you and was hardhearted enough to decide on the plan to kill Fang Feng Yi Yang to end the engagement, then I would actually leave him. Men like you make decisive and hard decisions, so attractive to the world, but I\u2019m just an ordinary woman and I wanted a companion for the rest of my life. Life is long and so many things can happen, I believe only a kind person can be good\u00a0to me for my entire life. Even if I make a mistake he will accept me. I don\u2019t believe a hardhearted person to the world will make me an exception, I\u2019m neither that confident nor that self-absorbed.\u201dZhuan Xu angrily tossed his cup down and turned to leave \u201cFine, I\u2019m hardhearted, then you quickly leave me!\u201dXiao Yao quickly grabbed him \u201cYou\u2019re the only exception.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao and she smiled and shook his arm \u201cYou\u2019re the only exception in the whole wide world.\u201dZhuan Xu was expressionless and Xiao Yao buried her face in his waist and murmured \u201cBecause I know you will let me do whatever I want, that\u2019s why I say whatever I want to you.\u201dZhuan Xu sat down and grabbed a lock of Xiao Yao\u2019s hair \u201cXiao Yao\u201d, his head was lowered and he stared at the lock of hair twined around the palm of his hand.Xiao Yao raised her head to look at him \u201cWhat?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI hope Jing deserves the feelings you give him!\u201dXiao Yao smiled and sighed \u201cI hope so, too. I tell myself not to hope but who really doesn\u2019t hope. On Five G.o.ds Mountain, I frequently thought of him.\u201dZhuan Xu put down the lock of hair and smiled \u201cTomorrow you can go see Jing so get some rest early!\u201dHe got up and took Xiao Yao\u2019s cup away before calling \u201cShan Hu, a.s.sist the Princess to retire.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis is the chapter in Lost You Forever where the s.h.i.+t hits the fan for Xiao Yao and Jing. It\u2019s high time these two faced the enormity of the pressures against them getting together rather than stubbornly cling to the hope that Jing can just somehow make it happen. I think Jing\u2019s intelligence is no less than Zhuan Xu or Xiang Liu, but he lacks the ruthlessness of the other two and that is exactly what he needs to overcome his grandmother and Fang Feng Yi Yang plotting against him. I know Xiao Yao loves Jing especially for his kindness, but that kindness served them well when he was just Ye s.h.i.+ Qi but as Tu Shan Jing he has the weight of two powerful forces tugging at him. On on side is familial duty to one of the most powerful clans and the other is his love to be with a princess so lofty in position that even his position in life is merely good enough for her. I\u2019m not asking Jing to suddenly grow some b.a.l.l.s but he does need to make a choice one way or the other rather than just standing in place. This leaves other people making things happen for him, and later on in the novel it\u2019ll become clearer and clearer that Jing is\u00a0the elusive safety net for Xiao Yao that requires others around her to make happen for her.By this time in the story bratty Ah Nian is really becoming an endearing thing to have around for Xiao Yao. She\u2019s really growing into being Xiao Yao\u2019s little sister in every way especially in how annoying she can be paired with real sisterly affection. Xiao Yao needs family more than romantic love and might even be content if to be spinster even her family never left her side. But she\u2019s too darn special and easy to love it\u2019s no wonder three amazing men love her even if they aren\u2019t fighting over it. I still can\u2019t get over the glimpses we see of how much Xiang Liu does for her without ever revealing it and asking nothing in return. Scouring the world for the most rare items and having the best bow forged for her is a present as perfect as their thirty-seven years spent in that clam sh.e.l.l. Every time Xiao Yao is with Xiang Liu or Bei, it feels like an escape for her from the real world problems. The concern is that it\u2019s fleeting because Xiang Liu had already pledged his life to General Gong Gong even before he met Xiao Yao. So even if she loses Jing, there isn\u2019t another guy around that can give her the unreserved commitment she wants.Chapter 25 \u2013 Suddenly Hear the Sorrowful Wind Tune:In the morning, Xiao Yao took Shan Hu and Miao Pu and left Sheng Nong Mountain.She had another task in mind and used the excuse of needing to buy some items to shop around on the street before finally diverting her maids to allow her to sneak into the Tu Shan clan messenger store. She handed over a wooden box to the shop owner to ask him to deliver to Qing Shui TownIt was all poisons Xiao Yao made, and even though Xiang Liu already asked Zhuan Xu for payment of her \u201cmedical bills\u201d, but\u00a0it was her life that he saved. In the three months Xiao Yao was at Five G.o.ds Mountain, she rifled through all the rare herbs and medicines stored there and created a lot of poisons to thank Xiang Liu.After she paid the bill and left the store, she saw the street was filled with stores and lots of people were busy with their business. She couldn\u2019t help but smile, having experienced so much separation and heartache, every time she saw such simple bustling life she felt happy even if it had nothing to do with her.As she looked around, she saw a familiar figure.Fang Feng Bei was riding a winged horse through the crowds, his expression gentle with a smile on his lips, just like any regular son of a rich family.Xiao Yao was rooted in place and watched him come closer to her through the dense thrum\u00a0of bustling ordinary life. Even knowing it was hopeless, she still fervently wished that this ordinary world could keep him in it.Fang Feng Bei stopped before her and asked with a smile \u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201dXiao Yao smiled back \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dThe two of them, one asked and the other answered, as if they really were next door neighbors or close friends, but Xiao Yao distinctly remembered their last parting in front of the gambling den. He was filled with\u00a0angry\u00a0intensity while she bolted like a frightened rabbit.Fang Feng Bei asked \u201cHave you been seriously practicing archery?\u201d\u201cGetting a second chance at life, do I dare slack off? I practice every day.\u201dFang Feng Bei nodded and added \u201cThere can never be enough skills that can protect a life.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cHow long are you in Zhi Yi for? Do you have time to teach me archery? I got a great bow from the Jin Tian family and wanted to show it to you.\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cCoincidence is better than scheduling, how about now?\u201dXiao Yao thought and knew she could get to Qing Qiu in half an hour plus another day to get the Grand Madam her pills would be fine \u201cSure!\u201dFang Feng Bei vaulted back on the winged horse and Xiao Yao grabbed his hand and vaulted on in front of him.Miao Pu and Shan Hu arrived and Xiao Yao waved to them \u201cWait for me at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence\u201d and then they were off without any regard to the two maids hollering and hopping. In a moment she and Fang Feng Bei were gone.The winged horse stopped at a remote canyon and it was the place Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei used to practice archery.Fang Feng Bei asked \u201cYour bow?\u201dXiao Yao opened her hand and a silver bow appeared in her palm.Fang Feng Bei squinted to carefully check it out and then nodded \u201cNot bad!\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhat do you want me to shoot?\u201dFang Feng Bei plucked some leaves and tossed it into the air, the leaves turned into a green bird and under his powerful direction, the bird flew into the air and disappeared into the clouds,Fang Feng Bei said \u201cI just used a third power.\u201dXiao Yao calmed her heart and pulled back her bow, with a whoosh her arrow flew out and a green bird fell from the sky.Fang Feng Bei reached out his hand and the bird dropped in his hand, the silver arrow pierced it right in the heart.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cMaster, are you pleased with your disciple?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019ve always been pleased with you as my disciple.\u201dXiao Yao blushed and glared \u201cI was talking about archery!\u201dFang Feng Bei looked all innocent \u201cI was also talking about archery! What did you a.s.sume I was talking about?\u201dXiao Yao was exasperated and said \u201cI can\u2019t win any argument with you, I can\u2019t win any fight with you, so there is nothing I would dare a.s.sume!\u201dFang Feng Bei took the bow from Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and inspected it \u201cIf just for fun, this is enough, but if you want to kill a person, you need to be more hardhearted.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThis weapon\u2019s entire purpose is to kill. I plan to smear the arrow in poison so that once it\u2019s released, it\u2019s surefire death.\u201dFang Feng Bei handed the bow back with a smile \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve graduated.\u201dThe bow vanished in a silver light and disappeared into Xiao Yao\u2019s arm \u201cI graduated?\u201d\u201cYour power is low but for your archery to get to this level it\u2019s already the top. You\u2019ve mastered everything I can teach you. From now on, you don\u2019t need to learn archery from me anymore.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart shook and suddenly she felt so adrift and lost. It was a joking offer between them tens of years ago, but as time pa.s.sed in a blink, they were standing here now and so much had happened.Fang Feng Bei laughed \u201cWhat\u201d You\u2019re going to miss me being your Master?\u201dXiao Yao glared \u201cI was thinking that since I graduated, shouldn\u2019t you get me a graduation present?\u201dFang Feng Bei furrowed his brows and sighed and said with sadness \u201cA long time ago I wanted to give you a bow when you mastered archery. But now you have a great bow already, so I won\u2019t need to give it to you.\u201dXiao Yao snarked \u201cI highly doubt you would be willing to spend money to buy me a good bow.\u201dFang Feng Bei stared at the silver crescent moon mark on Xiao Yao\u2019s arm and smiled but said nothing.Xiao Yao solemnly bowed \u201cThank you for teaching me archery.\u201dFang Feng Bei lazily laughed \u201cThis archery technique is a Fang Feng family secret, giving it to you, I don\u2019t feel bad at all. Years ago I said I would teach you archery if you played with me. The only thing I spent was my time, and the only payment you gave was your time. This was a very fair transaction.\u201d\u201cEach transaction is so clear for you, clearly you never get taken advantage of!\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled and stared \u201cDo you want to take advantage of me?\u201dXiao Yao mocked herself \u201cI can\u2019t out wit all nine of you heads, I\u2019m happy to have an even deal between us.\u201dFang Feng Bei stared a the clouds in the distance for a few moments before speaking \u201cToday I didn\u2019t teach you archery but since we\u2019re out already, spend the rest of the day with me as a thank you for your master!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSure!\u201d_________________________Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei came back in the late afternoon together.Miao Pu and Shan Hu saw her and relaxed. Xiao Yao leaped off the winged horse and waved goodbye to Fang Feng Bei and entered the Little Zhu Rong residence.Xing Yue accompanied Xiao Yao to the Evergreen Residence and waited for Jing Ye to open the door. Xing Yue sat to Xiao Yao \u201cI won\u2019t entertain you guys.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cComing and going, we already see your home as our home. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll head straight to Qing Qiu with Jing later.\u201dXing Yue smiled \u201cSure, say hi to the Grand Madam on behalf of me and Gege.\u201dJing Ye led Xiao Yao inside the room \u201cMaster, the Princess is here.\u201dJing stood before the table and quietly stared at Xiao Yao, his eyes reflecting a quiet control.Xiao Yao\u2019s heart twinged and felt like he was a bit off. She asked \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t welcome me? The Grand Madam\u2019s pills are almost done so let\u2019s go to Qing Qiu!\u201dJing appeared to snap out of it and walked over wanting to embrace Xiao Yao but hesitated and only took her hand.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jing pulled Xiao Yao out the door. The two got in a cloud carriage and Jing remained strangely quiet.Xiao Yao thought it was about her leaving for Gao Xing without saying goodbye and explained \u201cI went to Gao Xing alone to help me think. We\u2019ve been forced along by situations and I wanted you to have time to think clearly. Plus I needed to spend some time with my dad.\u201dJing said in a low voice \u201cXiao Yao.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cXiao Yao.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cXiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao stared at him quizzically but Jing said nothing more.They arrived at Qing Qiu at dusk and Jing took Xiao Yao to greet the Grand Madam.They entered the Grand Madam\u2019s courtyard and there were a row of bird cages in the corridor and inside some canaries were napping.A very alert and energetic canary was sitting on the Grand Madam\u2019s shoulder and she was feeding it spiritual nuts. It ate one and happily chirped. It saw Jing and Xiao Yao come in and appeared to know they were going to discuss important matters so it nudged the Grand Madam\u2019s hand and chirped a few times before flying out the window.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cThat little thing doesn\u2019t need a cage anymore.\u201dThe Grand Madam smiled \u201cIt\u2019s so smart, it knows I have nuts for it and we treat it all like precious treasures so none of them want to leave.\u201dXiao Yao took the Grand Madam\u2019s pulse and the Grand Madam said \u201cNo need to take my pulse, I know I am doing well. In the past when I slept I didn\u2019t like bird calls disrupting my sleep, but now when I hear the canaries call I sleep even more restfully.\u201dXiao Yao said to Se Mai Er \u201cYou\u2019ve been taking good care of the Grand Madam. I\u2019ll need another bowl of your blood.\u201dSe Mai Er reverently bowed to Xiao Yao \u201cThis is what I ought to do.\u201dHou said to Xiao Yao \u201cAll the supplies are ready.\u201dXiao Yao said to everyone \u201cTo make the medicine I need to get a good night\u2019s rest. I\u2019ll be off now.\u201dThe Grand Madam said \u201cThe Princess needs to rest so no one go bother her!\u201dXiao Yao had dinner and then went to sleep.The next day she woke up and inspected all the supplies and checked that everything was prepared. She had the maids summon Se Mai Er and Doctor Hu Zhen and had him take a bowl of Se Mai Er\u2019s blood.Like last time, Xiao Yao spent seven days and nights making the medicine and made one hundred pills. But this time she had Hu Zhen watch everything and since he knew medicine and was very bright, he learned the technique from her completely after seven days. Next time Hu Zhen could independently make the pills for the Grand Madam.Hu Zhen thanked Xiao Yao, as a doctor spending the last seven days with Xiao Yao he learned more than just how to make one medicine.It was nighttime by the time the medicine was ready and Xiao Yao had Shan Nu pack it into bottles. Xiao Yao was exhausted and skipped dinner to just head to bed.It was noon by the time she woke up and the first thing she said was \u201cI\u2019m so hungry.\u201dShan Hu and Miao Pu quickly brought out breakfast and Xiao Yao wolfed it down and then rested before saying to Shan Hu \u201cPrepare a bath.\u201dAfter soaking her body in the herb water did Xiao Yao regain her energy. Miao Pu sat beside her and said \u201cPrincess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI saw Fang Feng Yi Yang go to Master Jing\u2019s residence but Jing Ye was cold and blocked the door and wouldn\u2019t even let her in. She didn\u2019t even give her any face and she likely dared be so rude because Master Jing told her to. Thank G.o.d Master Jing has finally put his foot down!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cSome things, if it\u2019s meant to be yours then it\u2019s yours, if it\u2019s not then staring isn\u2019t going to keep it there.\u201dMiao Pu pursed her lips and said nothing more.Xiao Yao got dressed and did her hair and then took the pills to see the Grand Madam.Jing, Hou, Yi Yang, and Lan Mu were all there talking with the Grand Madam.Xiao Yao handed the pulls over and Hou asked \u201cCan\u2019t you make more?\u201d Hou didn\u2019t trust Xiao Yao and having the Grand Madam rely on Xiao Yao for the pills made him feel like Xiao Yao had something on her.Xiao Yao casually explained \u201cWith the Tu Shan clan wealth you can get whatever medicinal supplies you need. But you can\u2019t take too much blood from Se Mai Er. One bowl every three months is the limit. If you take more her blood will thin and the medicine brewed will not be as effective. If the Grand Madam ingests it then it won\u2019t suppress the pain. Se Mai Er\u2019s body needs to be in optimal health so that her blood drawn is at its best.\u201dActually Xiao Yao\u2019s explanation she just made up, she didn\u2019t trust Hou and the Grand Madam either and was worried they would hurt Se Mai Er to get her blood, so what she said was meant to keep them in line. Hou and the Grand Madam didn\u2019t know any voodoo so they had to somewhat believe Xiao Yao and couldn\u2019t afford to discount what she said.Xiao Yao changed the subject \u201cI taught Hu Zhen how to make the pills so later when I can\u2019t come, he can make it for the Grand Madam.\u201dThe Grand Madam and Hou were astonished, they couldn\u2019t believe Xiao Yao would teach Hu Zhen the method. Even normal medical teachings was worth a lot of money, much less a medical technique that could extend the life and lessen the pain of the Grand Madam of the Tu Shan clan.Hou summoned Hu Zhen and asked \u201cThe Princess said you can make the pills yourself. Is that true?\u201dHu Zhen answered \u201cIt\u2019s true, thanks to the Princess teaching so patiently.\u201dThe Grand Madam watched Hu Zhen grow up and knew his personality was reliable and careful, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have entrusted him to care for the unconscious Jing years ago. The Grand Madam was rea.s.sured and had him leave.The Grand Madam smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cPrincess you are royalty and the medicine making process is so arduous, having you also have to come here, I feel really imposing.\u201dXiao Yao acted like she didn\u2019t understand the subtext and smiled \u201cIt\u2019s hard so thankfully Hu Zhen learned it.\u201dJing stared at the smart and aware Xiao Yao and felt his heart ache. He knew what his grandmother meant by that, she was an old woman who was at the end of her life and he simply couldn\u2019t castigate her.Xiao Yao sat for a bit and was about to bid farewell to the Grand Madam and head back to Sheng Nong Mountain by dinnertime. She was about to open her mouth when she saw Yi Yang standing by the pallet suddenly wobble like she was about to pitch over.Xiao Yao yelled \u201cHurry help her\u2026\u201d but before she finished speaking Yi Yang had collapsed in a faint on the ground.The Grand Madam called out \u201cHurry, hurry\u2026..\u201dThe maids put Yi Yang on the pallet and called \u201cDoctor, get the doctor!\u201dYi Yang regained consciousness and tried to sit up \u201cI\u2019m fine, likely didn\u2019t sleep well last night and got a little bit woozy.\u201d She sat up and then promptly threw up on the maids.Before the doctor arrived the Grand Madam asked Xiao Yao \u201cPrincess, can you please check first.\u201dXiao Yao walked to the pallet and put her finger on Yi Yang\u2019s wrist and a second later her face changed. She wobbled herself as if she was going to collapse and the maid propped her up.The Grand Madam anxiously asked \u201cWhat is it? Is it serious?\u201dXiao Yao took a deep breath and sat on the pallet with the maid\u2019s a.s.sistance. She controlled her emotions and took Yi Yang\u2019s pulse again. A moment later she pulled her hand back and walked to the side. She hid her shaking hand in her sleeve and even felt her legs were trembling, but she forced a smile and casually said \u201cMiss Fang Feng is expecting.\u201dThe entire room turned silent in an instant, so silent a leaf dropping could be heard. Everyone\u2019s expression was odd, expecting was a happy occasion, but unmarried and expecting was not.The Grand Madam spoke first and asked Yi Yang \u201cYou and Jing\u2026..\u201dFang Feng Yi Yang glanced at Jing and her face turned beet red and her tears fell \u201cGrandmother please forgive Jing\u2026.it\u2019s not his fault\u2026..it\u2019s all my fault! It\u2019s my being stupid\u2026..:She pretty much confirmed that the baby was Jing\u2019s with that and everyone\u2019s expression lightened. Unmarried pregnancy might be embarra.s.sing but the Grand Madam was at the end of her life and having a great-grandchild was of utmost importance.The Grand Madam grabbed Yi Yang\u2019s hand and her happiness was all over her face \u201cI can die without regret now! I can die without regret now!\u201dYi Yang kept her head lowered and kept crying and saying shamefully \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026.I didn\u2019t have the face to tell Grandmother.\u201dThe Grand Madam looked at Yi Yang like a treasure \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault! It\u2019s my fault! Because of my health I didn\u2019t force the wedding sooner. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll have the elders prepare the wedding immediately.\u201dAll the maids started congratulating the Grand Madam while Xiao Yao stared at Jing and saw his expression was full of despair with his face stark white in pain.Xiao Yao smiled, she initially had a bit of hope that the child had nothing to do with Jing.Everyone in the room gathered around the pallet so Xiao Yao turned and walked out. No one noticed her leaving other than Jing and he appeared to want to say something but no words came out.Miao Pu and Shan Hu saw Xiao Yao walked out with a smile as if she was in a good mood.Miao Pu asked happily \u201cPrincess, anything good happened?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBack to Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dThe maids replied \u201cYes!\u201dThe three of them got in a cloud carriage and returned to Sheng Nong Mountain. Miao Pu asked \u201cPrincess, I heard a lot of chatter in the Grand Madam\u2019s room, what happened?\u201dXiao Yao smiled as if she didn\u2019t hear it and Miao Pu asked again \u201cPrincess?\u201dXiao Yao looked at her and smiled \u201cWhat?\u201dMiao Pu shook her head \u201cNothing. Princess, are you\u2026.okay?\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cMe? I\u2019m fine!\u201dShan Hu and Miao Pu felt Xiao Yao appeared fine but was strangely happy in a way that made them feel totally weird.It was nighttime when they returned to Zhi Jin Palace.Ah Nian saw Xiao Yao and ran out all pouting \u201cJiejie, you have to help me! Zhuan Xu gege took me to see the plum blossoms and Xing Yue tagged along. She acts like Gege\u2019s wife in front of me, like she\u2019s my sister-in-law. She appears polite to me but secretly she\u2019s always undermining me! She keeps talking about this clan and that clan and Zhuan Xu gege talks to her so he doesn\u2019t have time for me. I listen beside him but Xing Yue tells me this stuff is boring and tells me to go elsewhere to play and I don\u2019t need to keep her company. Who the h.e.l.l was keeping her company! Zhuan Xu gege actually took her side and told me to go play! Jiejie\u00a0help me get rid of Xing Yue! Before coming to Sheng Nong Mountain I said it was fine if Gege has other women\u201d Ah Nian stomped her foot \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t include Xing Yue. Other than Xing Yue, I can accept anyone else!\u201dXiao Yao smiled and staggered off to her room.Ah Nian shook Xiao Yao\u2019s arm \u201cJiejie, jiejie, are you going to help me?\u201dZhuan Xu walked out and saw Ah Nian pleading with Xiao Yao and smiled at the cuteness, but he immediately sensed something was off. Xiao Yao was as dazed as a wooden doll and Ah Nian was tugging her to the point that Xiao Yao was about to fall over. He cried out \u201cAh Nian, let go\u2026.\u201dBefore he finished saying it, Xiao Yao\u2019s body pitched forward and Zhuan Xu flew up to catch her in his arms and Xiao Yao spit up blood on Zhuan Xu\u2019s collar.Zhuan Xu immediately picked Xiao Yao up in his arms and rushed inside the court while yelling \u201cBring the doctor!\u201dAh Nian was stunned and followed behind Zhuan Xu and anxiously tried to explain \u201cI didn\u2019t use force.\u201d But her frustration with Xing Yue, now she wasn\u2019t so sure \u201cMaybe\u2026..I used a little.\u201dZhuan Xu carefully placed Xiao Yao on the pallet and she used her sleeve to wipe the blood from her lip and smiled \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is a congealed blood clot on my heart, it\u2019s better to spit it out.\u201dXiao Xiao brought the doctor and rushed there but Xiao Yao said \u201cReally no need!\u201dZhuan Xu glared at her and Xiao Yao had no choice but to hand her wrist to the doctor and after he examined her he signed to Zhuan Xu.Ah Nian read the sign language and explained to Xiao Yao \u201cHe said you are suddenly so distraught that your spirit couldn\u2019t move through your body, but to keep your sorrow tamped down it caused harm to your heart and what you spit out was a congealed blood clot on your heart. It\u2019s better now and you have to rest well in the coming days and not to have wild mood swings.\u201dZhuan Xu had the doctor leave and Ah Nian asked \u201cJiejie, what happened? Who caused even someone like you to be so sad?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cSomeone like me? As if I don\u2019t have a heart.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIt\u2019s just us three in this room, if you can\u2019t even smile then stop forcing a smile for others to see!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cIt\u2019s not smiling for others, it\u2019s just a habit because I can\u2019t cry. Because life is just like this, cry one day, laugh one day, since I have to live it no matter what, it\u2019s better to live it with a smile. People like smiles, no one likes tears.\u201dZhuan Xu felt his heart ache while Ah Nian seemed to understand something and stared at Xiao Yao in a daze.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cDo you want dinner?\u201dXiao Yao smiled bitterly \u201cI actually can\u2019t eat right now so give me some soup and leave it there! I\u2019ll drink it when I\u2019m hungry. You guys go eat. I\u2019ll sleep and it\u2019ll be better.\u201dZhuan Xu dragged Ah Nian out and said to Shan Hu \u201cLook after the Princess well.\u201d He glanced at Miao Pu and she immediately followed Zhuan Xu.Xiao Yao took a sleeping pill and drowsily fell asleep.In the middle of the night, Xiao Yao woke up but was in discomfort and couldn\u2019t get up because her body felt weak.Zhuan Xu was resting in the outside room and immediately woke up and rushed inside. He helped Xiao Yao sit up and wrapped her in a coat before handing the still warm soup to her. Xiao Yao sipped the soup and felt her chest relax a bit.Zhuan Xu touched her forehead \u201cA bit feverish but the doctor said your const.i.tution is unique so don\u2019t take medicine yet but drink more liquids. What\u2019s most important is that you remain calm and peaceful.\u201dXiao Yao leaned back against the pillow and asked \u201cWhy are you outside keeping watch? Aren\u2019t there maids left in Zhi Jin Palace?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, from small until now what haven\u2019t I experienced? Will I really go die because of a man?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re totally fine because the person who spit up blood was totally not you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so serious. I\u2019ll be fine in a few days.\u201d\u201cI asked Miao Pu and she said you went to deliver medicine to the Grand Madam and everything was fine, but when you left her residence everything was off. What happened?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI want to go back to sleep?\u201dZhuan Xu pushed \u201cYou want to keep it even from me?\u201d The doctor said Xiao Yao\u2019s personality was to control everything and push it down so it was better for her to discuss it rather than hide it inside.Xiao Yao smiled and sighed \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hide it from you, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s nothing big so not worth discussing.\u201dZhuan Xu felt like needles were p.r.i.c.king his heart, many times he told himself that it wasn\u2019t a big deal: when his mom committed suicide it wasn\u2019t a big deal since everyone\u2019s mom dies eventually; his uncle wanted to kill him and it wasn\u2019t a big deal since everyone had bad relatives\u2026..Zhuan Xu softly asked \u201cWhat happened?Xiao Yao laughed \u201cJust that Fang Feng Yi Yang suddenly fainted and I diagnosed that she is pregnant.\u201dZhuan Xu grew silent and after a few months he snarked \u201cYou mean that Fang Feng Yi Yang who sent an arrow through my chest? She suddenly fainted?\u201d\u201cOf course she could have fainted on purpose, but being pregnant is real.\u201d\u201cHow long?\u201d\u201cI can only estimate about three months about. The actual date of conception only Fang Feng Yi Yang and\u2026..Jing know.\u201d\u201cIt really is Jing\u2019s child?\u201d It wasn\u2019t that Zhuan Xu believed Jing would remain chaste out of love for Xiao Yao, it was that his royal uncles were sharpening their swords right behind him and he didn\u2019t want Fang Feng Yi Yang to cement her position in the Tu Shan clan at this critical juncture.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask him, but seeing his expression it\u2019s likely his\u2026..Yi Yang isn\u2019t stupid, if it\u2019s not Jing\u2019s baby then she wouldn\u2019t dare faint in public.\u201d Xiao Yao laughed and said in derision \u201cWho knew my leaving for Gao Xing would lead me to come back to find Jing having a baby.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, there are better men than Jing in the world.\u201d Xiao Yao had tears in her eyes she tried to conceal and she forced a smile \u201cI\u2019m not sad because of him, I\u2019m sad because I trusted the wrong person.\u201dZhuan Xu acted like he didn\u2019t see anything and smiled \u201cRest up now! Didn\u2019t you say that it\u2019ll be better in a few days. When you\u2019re better, I\u2019ll take you and Ah Nian down the mountain to play.\u201dXiao Yao curled into the blanket and Zhuan Xu waved his hand and the lamp extinguished leaving only moonlight in the room.Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell and she turned over so her back was to Zhuan Xu. She wiped her tears with her blanket \u201cGege, don\u2019t leave.\u201dZhuan Xu patted her back and said \u201cI won\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll always stay with you.\u201dEven though Xiao Yao didn\u2019t cry out loud, but as her tears fell her nose got stuffy and her labored breathing sound extra clear in the silence.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t say anything and just sat at the head of the pallet and continued to gently pat Xiao Yao\u2019s back.The second day Xiao Yao got sicker and fell into a deep slumber.Ah Nian saw that Xiao Yao was sick and put away her little girl att.i.tudes and earnestly and sweetly helped Zhuan Xu take care of Xiao Yao. Zhuan Xu was very rea.s.sured since he knew that Ah Nian meant a lot to Xiao Yao so Ah Nian being nice to Xiao Yao would make Xiao Yao happy.Jing heard Xiao Yao was sick and wanted to come see her. Xing Yue also wanted to come see Xiao Yao. Zhuan Xu declined them all. Because he spent every night in Xiao Yao\u2019s room, and his secret guards would be stationed outside, even Jing\u2019s little nine-tailed fox spirit couldn\u2019t sneak in to find Xiao Yao.Jing asked Feng Long to help him see Xiao Yao and Feng Long heard Fang Feng Yi Yang was pregnant and encouraged Jing to give up. But Jing was wasting away in mere days and Feng Long couldn\u2019t bear it so brought Jing to go see Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu saw Jing and showed no displeasure and instead warmly greeted both men with dinner.Jing said \u201cPlease let me see Xiao Yao.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cXiao Yao caught a cold recently and is not up to seeing guests.\u201dJing said \u201cI just want to see her once.\u201dZhuan Xu was very polite \u201cI\u2019ll pa.s.s along your concern, but Xiao Yao\u2026.\u201dFeng Long cut him off annoyed at the beating around the bush \u201cCool it, everyone stop play-acting! You know about Jing and Xiao Yao\u2019s situation! Fang Feng Yi Yang is pregnant and you and Xiao Yao must not be happy. But this is between Jing and Xiao Yao, even if Xiao Yao wants to break up with Jing, you ought to let Xiao Yao tell Jing directly.\u201dZhuan Xu considered it and then said to Xiao Xiao \u201cGo ask the Princess if she\u2019s willing to see Jing.\u201dXiao Xiao came back a few minutes later \u201cThe Princess asks the clan leader to come.\u201dZhuan Xu said to Jing \u201cXiao Yao is willing to see you.\u201dJing followed Xiao Xiao to Xiao Yao\u2019s residence and when the door opened, a warm and medicinal air wafted out.Shan Hu and Hai Tang were holding Spring flowers and discussing how to arrange it. When Shan Hu saw Jing, she rolled her eyes and coldly harrumphed.Separated by a crystal part.i.tion, he could see Xiao Yao wearing a yellow robe laying on the pallet facing Ah Nian. The two of them had a crystal dish between them and Ah Nian was using her powers to conjure up an entire dish full of lilies and Xiao Yao was laughing at the trick.Xiao Xiao and Miao Pu welcomed Jing in. Ah Nian smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cJiejie\u2019s guest is here so I\u2019ll come play with Jiejie later.\u201dAh Nian nodded at Jing and then left.Xiao Yao gestured to where Ah Nian was sitting and invited Jing in with a smile.Xiao Yao\u2019s face was pale white and her body wan, but she was wearing a warm yellow color and had on a bit of blush so she didn\u2019t seem all that sick. She seemed more like a Spring flower that was facing the still cold late Winter air, a fragile kind of beauty rooted in steeliness to survive.Jing\u2019s heart churned in pain \u201cXiao Yao, I\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao silently stared at him and intently listened.Jing said with great difficulty \u201cThree months ago, the first time you gave Grandmother the pills, Yi Yang started sticking really close to me. Usually I could leave Qing Qiu to avoid her but Grandmother was sick so I couldn\u2019t go anywhere. One night she tried to kill herself and even Grandmother was alarmed. She chastised me so I had to keep her company as she recovered. Later\u2026.I thought I saw you and you kept smiling at me\u2026..\u201d Jing\u2019s face was filled with regret and anguish \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened but I woke up and I was sleeping with Yi Yang in my arms.\u201dXiao Yao coolly explained \u201cYou likely got entranced by a confusion spell and then a love potion. You learned from me for a long time, how could you so easily fall into Yi Yang\u2019s medicinal trap?\u201dJing\u2019s hands were clenched into a fist and he was filled with rage, but then he released it \u201cMy Grandmother set up the trap.\u201d His dearest family tricking him left him nowhere to turn to release his rage.Xiao Yao was astonished \u201cIt was the Grand Madam.\u201dJIng curled over in pain and put his hands on his face \u201cYi Yang told me that she just wanted to be my wife. If I wanted to I could kill her. In that instant I really wanted to kill her, but I wanted to kill myself more\u2026..I escaped from her room and ran to Zhi Yi. I didn\u2019t dare go see you and instead hid in the Li Jie tribe gambling den and drank myself into a stupor. Ten days later the owner kicked me out back to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence when I learned that you had long left for Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Yao thought and realized this was why Jing was so strange and didn\u2019t contact her while she was gone.Jing said \u201cI wanted to find the chance to tell you this but you rushed to make medicine for Grandmother and I never got the chance. After you were done, before I could tell you, Yi Yang fainted\u2026.Xiao Yao, I\u2019m sorry!\u201dXiao Yao was silent and then said \u201cThank you for telling me this. Now I know at least that I didn\u2019t misjudge you. My trust was not wrongly given. But what\u2019s happened has happened and nothing can be reversed. Don\u2019t blame yourself anymore.\u201dXiao Yao took off her fish amethyst necklace and placed it in front of Jing \u201cThe Grand Madam will likely hold your wedding to Yi Yang soon. I won\u2019t be attending to congratulate you. I\u2019ll give you my blessings early now \u2013 respect and love each other until your hair is white.Jing\u2019s head jerked up and he stared at Xiao Yao.In the dish, the lilies Ah Nian conjured up was wilting and as each petal fell and each leaf wilted, Xiao Yao sat on the pallet seemingly looking at him and seemingly not seeing him. The distance between them was but one crystal dish, but it felt as far and wide as the ends of the Earth.Jing\u2019s hand shook and he picked up the necklace and walked out of the residence. His footsteps were one light one heavy and he had no clue how he walked back to Zhuan Xu\u2019s residence.Feng Long saw the despondent Jing and tried to lighten the mood \u201cZhuan Xu, people sure are different, I see you have tons of women around you and never seen you affected. Jing only has two women and he\u2019s completely a mess and near death. You\u2019ve got to hurry up and teach him a few tricks!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled but Jing appeared not to have heard anything, his face ashen and lifeless.Zhuan Xu said to Feng Long \u201cLet\u2019s not discuss anything tonight, you take him back!\u201dFeng Long sighed and took Jing away.______________________Ten days later, the Tu Shan clan Grand Madam organized a hastily arranged wedding announcement that the Tu Shan clan leader would be marrying the daughter of the Fang Feng family.It was so sudden that everyone was surprised but the Grand Madam placed all the reason on her due to her illness and not having time left to wait.Everyone accepted this explanation and complimented Fang Feng Yi Yang for being so filial and willing to have a hasty wedding for the sake of the Grand Madam.Zhuan Xu received the wedding invitation and ordered Xiao Xiao to prepare expensive presents to congratulate the Tu Shan clan leader on his happy day.Zhuan Xu knew Xiao Yao broke up with Jing and he ought to now spend more effort to be on good terms with Jing. He can use the wedding for a legitimate trip to Qing Qiu and it would be very useful for him. But Zhuan Xu felt very conflicted, on one hand was happiness like a burden was shed, on the other was utter loathing at this wedding taking place. In the end, he handed off the task to Feng Long and remained on Sheng Nong Mountain to keep Xiao Yao company.After lunch, Xiao Yao laid on the pallet with Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian and was holding the wedding invitation \u201cDid you prepare a present for me?\u201dZhuan Xu coolly replied \u201cIt\u2019s prepared.\u201dAh Nian asked quizzically \u201cWhy don\u2019t either you go to Qing Qiu? This is the wedding of the Tu Shan clan leader\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh Nian, be quiet!\u201d Zhuan Xu cut her off with a smile and his eyes may be gentle but Ah Nian saw beneath it and wisely said no more.Xiao Yao stared at the water clock and the minute hand was getting closer to the time of the wedding. Right now Jing and Yi Yang must be standing in the ceremonial hall. The water dropped one by one and each drop was like a poison dropping on Xiao Yao\u2019s heart. It pierced her through into hundreds and thousands of pockmarks. Xiao Yao knew she shouldn\u2019t think about it but it was like she was possessed and she stared at the water clock thinking of when Jing would say his vows.The Tu Shan residence must be decked out and bustling with activity.Jing wearing a groom outfit, standing side-by-side with Yi Yang.The officiant calling out as Jing and Yi Yang started to go through the wedding rites. Yi Yang got her wish come true and she must be thrilled, but what about Jing? What was his expression\u2026.Xiao Yao suddenly felt her heart beating wildly and was so unexpected she couldn\u2019t catch her breath and it banished all the images in her mind.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cAre you feeling sick?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cNo! But a bit stuffy and suddenly want some fresh air.\u201dXiao Yao rushed out the door and Zhuan Xu hurriedly draped a fur cloak around her. Xiao Yao stood in the courtyard staring up at the blue sky. Why did Xiang Liu suddenly had her feel his presence? Did he feel her pain? Or was it because he was currently in Qing Qiu watching Yi Yang and Jing get married and remembered she might not be happy about it? Was he mocking her? Or trying to console her?Zhuan Xu asked \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI suddenly remembered the voodoo bug I planted in Xiang Liu. My body\u2019s pain, he has to feel all of it. But what about my heartache? Does he also need to endure it? He said he has nine bodies so my pain isn\u2019t too much for him to endure. But what about the heart? He only has one heart!\u201dZhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao by the shoulders and harshly said \u201cI don\u2019t care what your relations.h.i.+p with him was in Qing Shui Town. Do not remain close to him now!\u201dXiao Yao smiled bitterly \u201cI know!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cEven though you keep saying the bug has no ill effects, when you\u2019re all better it\u2019s best to find a way to remove it.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dXiao Yao stared at the blue sky and quietly felt her heart beating as one with another heart. The pressure and pain on her heart lessened, probably because another heart was taking some of the burden from her.Xiao Yao got better and she started making poisons again.When she was sick Zhuan Xu got all sorts of herbs and medicines but she didn\u2019t use much of it so now it came in handy to use.Xiao Yao smiled as usual but all the poisons she made were dark color. Black bats, black crows, black lover birds, black hibiscus\u2026.each one she placed in the box and totally gave off the impression that the maker was in a foul mood indeed. But during the process of making these dark and dreary poisons, Xiao Yao released all of her pain.When the early Spring arrived, Xiao Yao took Ah Nian to Zhi Yi Castle to play.Ah Nian\u2019s attention was captivated by a street vendor\u2019s knicknacks and was picking a few to take back. Xiao Yao had Hai Tang and Shan Hu keep Ah Nian company as she took her time to make her selection. She snuck away to the Tu Shan clan messenger service to mail the poisons to Xiang Liu.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but smile when she imagined his displeasure when he saw this batch of poisons.When Xiao Yao went back, what she saw was Ah Nian together with Xing Yue and Feng Long.Xing Yue complained to Xiao Yao \u201cYour real sister is here so you never come find me to play anymore. Even coming to Zhi Yi Castle you didn\u2019t come see me.\u201dXiao Yao put all the blame on Zhuan Xu\u2019s head \u201cZhuan Xu doesn\u2019t let me run around and insists I recuperate. Today is the first day I\u2019ve gone down the mountain since I recovered and I was planning to go see you in a bit.\u201dXing Yue was placated and warmly grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s elbow \u201cSince you\u2019re here, don\u2019t hurry back and come have dinner at my house. I\u2019ll send a message to Zhuan Xu and he can join us.\u201dAh Nian immediately grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s other arm and pulled her sleeve repeatedly indicating for her to decline.Xing Yue noticed what Ah Nian was doing and stared at Xiao Yao \u201cAre you deciding to end our friends.h.i.+p forever?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s head hurt and turned to Feng Long but he coughed twice and turned around indicating he was of no help.Xiao Yao chuckled and said to Ah Nian \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Xing Yue\u2019s house to play a bit, after dinner we\u2019ll go back with Zhuan Xu.\u201dXing Yue smiled while Ah Nian pouted and glared balefully at Xiao Yao. Xiao Yao lightly squeezed her hand to indicate that she was still closest with her which was when Ah Nian reluctantly nodded her head.Xiao Yao was afraid Ah Nian and Xing Yue would get in a fight and didn\u2019t dare go straight to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence so used the excuse of shopping to keep both on the street and in public where they would be a bit more restrained.She lasted unto Zhuan Xu arrived and immediately rushed to his side and spit out through clenched teeth \u201cFrom now on, Ah Nian and Xing Yue are your problem. Do not allow them to come bug me!\u201d Xiao Yao pushed Zhuan Xu between Ah Nian and Xing Yue and rushed off to find Feng Long.Feng Long congratulated Xiao Yao \u201cYou successfully escaped, congrats!\u201dXiao Yao punched him hard \u201cYou did nothing to help!\u201dFeng Long turned back and it wasn\u2019t clear what Zhuan Xu said but suddenly both Xing Yue and Ah Nian were beaming in smiles and Feng Long sighed \u201cYou\u2019re Gege is the man!Xiao Yao glanced back and burst out laughing \u201cHe likely summoned all his intelligence that would be used to deal with conflicting party officials in court.\u201dWhen they got to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence, it wasn\u2019t clear if Xing Yue really wanted to go all out to treat Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao, or she was trying to send a message to Ah Nian, but a last minute dinner banquet turned out to be lavish and seamless.Ah Nian initially didn\u2019t pay too much heed to it, but then she heard that Xing Yue\u2019s mom lived in Chi Sui Castle and it was Xing Yue who ran the Little Zhu Rong residence. The way she looked at Xing Yue changed. Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence appeared like any expensive residence but all the orders and decrees in the Middle Plains originated from here. All of the Middle Plains and Xuan Yuan officials and important personages came through here and Xing Yue handled all the back end. It wasn\u2019t any woman who could do this, and Ah Nian accepted that she wasn\u2019t able to do it herself.Ah Nian silently ate her dinner, and her silence caused no ripples during dinner and everyone was happy and relieved.After dinner Feng Long and Xing Yue walked the three of them out, but then Feng Long pulled Zhuan Xu aside and the two of them talked for a long time. Xiao Yao was standing close but could hear nothing, likely Feng Long cast a masking spell and the discussion had to be very important.After returning to Zhi Jin Palace, Xiao Xiao and Jin Xuan was waiting in the court and Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cI have to take care of something, you guys go wash up and afterwards I\u2019ll come to Xiao Yao\u2019s room to discuss something with you both.\u201dAh Nian and Xiao Yao agreed and went to wash up.After Xiao Yao finished and Shan Hu was drying her hair, Ah Nian came in but her hair was still wet and she anxiously asked \u201cJiejie, what does Gege want to talk to us about?\u201dHai Tang grabbed a crystal comb and fixed Ah Nian\u2019s hair and used her power to dry it at the same time.Xiao Yao \u201cI don\u2019t know, but seeming how solemn he looked, it has to be something important.\u201dZhuan Xu walked in and both Hai Tang and Shan Hu left.Ah Nian nervously stared \u201cGege, what do you want to tell us?\u201dZhuan Xu glanced at Ah Nian and then kept his eyes on Xiao Yao \u201cI wanted to tell you that I\u2019m getting married.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ah Nian stood up and her face was white and her voice shook \u201cYou\u2026.you\u2019re marrying Xing Yue?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d Ah Nian didn\u2019t know if she was happy or even more sad. She stood there in a daze with the most awkward expression.Zhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019m marry the only daughter of the Tan family. She won\u2019t be my princess, she\u2019ll just be my consort, though just a level below.\u201dAh Nian stared in despair at Xiao Yao, having no clue where this random woman popped out from. Xiao Yao explained \u201cThe Tan family is one of the Middle Plains Six Big Families, and is the largest one of the lot. When the Sheng Nong Kingdom was still in existence, the royal family always intermarried with them.\u201dAh Nian asked \u201cDoes Xing Yue know?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cShe should know by now, Feng Long will tell her.\u201dAh Nian murmured \u201cIs Gege done with what you wanted to say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving\u201d Ah Nian rushed out.Zhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao and there was no expression on his face. She took out wine \u201cYou want to drink? I can get raging drunk with you.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled bitterly and took the cup from her and downed it in one gulp.Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ve seen the Tan family daughter, she\u2019s not as pretty as Jin Xuan or Xiao Xiao but she\u2019s pretty enough. She\u2019s reserved and very good as embroidery. Even seamstresses are in awe when they see her work.\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing and continued drinking.Xiao Yao said \u201cIf you marry the Tan family daughter, you are officially declaring war against our uncles. Are you ready?\u201dZhuan Xu nodded.Xiao Yao slowly said \u201cGrandfather has always been wary of the Middle Plains families. Because she won\u2019t be your princess, then Grandfather will agree. But she\u2019s still the first woman you marry, I\u2019m afraid if uncles urge on and the Xuan Yuan elders get upset, they will speak ill of you. What if Grandfather gets suspicious of you, then you will be in danger\u2026.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI know, but I have to take this step, I have to make a marriage alliance with the Tan family.\u201dXiao Yao reached out her hand and took Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand, and both their hands were ice cold.Xiao Yao gripped his hand tightly and said each word clearly \u201cNo matter what you do, no matter what tactics you use, I only ask that you stay alive!\u201dZhuan Xu also gripped Xiao Yao\u2019s hand tightly back \u201cI said, I will let Sheng Nong Mountain bloom in phoenix flowers.\u201dXiao Yao raised her cup and Zhuan Xu raised his cup and the two toasted before downing the wine.Zhuan Xu put his cup down \u201cI want to get raging drunk with you but I still have things to take care of.\u201dXiao Yao shook her cup \u201cGo! As long as you\u2019re fine, I\u2019m always here and we have plenty of time to drink.\u201dZhuan Xu suddenly appeared overcome and he said \u201cXiao Yao\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head to stare at him and he was silent for a moment before smiling \u201cAt the wedding, don\u2019t congratulate me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Xiao Yao was clear that this wasn\u2019t something to congratulate, it could even be considered Zhuan Xu\u2019s shame.Zhuan Xu turned and walked off without looking back.Xiao Yao poured herself another cup and slowly sipped it. Then she stood up and went to find Ah Nian.Hai Tang saw her come in and looked like a burden was taken off her shoulders. She pointed to the inside and then ran outside.Xiao Yao walked in and saw Ah Nian sprawled on the pallet sobbing her guts out. Xiao Yao sat down next to her and patted Ah Nian\u2019s shoulder \u201cWant to drink?\u201dAh Nian sat up and grabbed the wine and gulped it down before coughing and saying \u201cMore!\u201dXiao Yao poured her another cup \u201cYou can still go back to Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dAh Nian said \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t consider that? I hurt now but every day I don\u2019t see him and he\u2019s nice to other women, I hurt more. I\u2019m picking the lesser pain.\u201d Ah Nian appeared to have a blood feud with wine and viciously downed it \u201cThis is the first time, I\u2019ll slowly get used to it.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cThere\u2019s no hope for you!\u201dAh Nian cried \u201cThese days Gege doesn\u2019t even try to shy away and instead purposely holds Jin Xuan in front of me. I know he\u2019s doing it on purpose to force me to leave. But on Five G.o.ds Mountain I suffer the pain of missing him without any happiness. By Gege\u2019s side I hurt but when he\u2019s with me then I\u2019m happy. Even if he\u2019s not with me, I think about the things we say and do together and I\u2019m still happy.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly realized that Ah Nian didn\u2019t care about Zhuan Xu\u2019s potential to be someone and loved him regardless of his position. Other women, whether it was Jin Xuan or Xing Yue, they had some part of liking him because of his position and his future power.Xiao Yao asked \u201cAh Nian, if Zhuan Xu was still in Gao Xing and just an empty Prince with a t.i.tle, but really a man who had nothing, would you still be willing to be with him?\u201dAh Nian wiped her tears and glared at Xiao Yao \u201cYou mentioned this and I hate you! If it wasn\u2019t for you, Gege would have never gone back to Xuan Yuan. If he stayed in Gao Xing forever that would be so great!\u201dXiao Yao was certain that if Zhuan Xu stayed in Gao Xing, Xing Yue would never have liked him. Xing Yue wanted a man who s.h.i.+ned for the world to s.h.i.+ne and gave it to her. Whereas Ah Nian wanted a man who just loved her sincerely. Ah Nian loved the wrong type of man but it was too late for her now.Xiao Yao hugged Ah Nian.Ah Nian pushed her \u201cYou leave! I\u2019m hating you right now!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBut right now I\u2019m finding you cute and pitiful, and I just want to hug you!\u201dAh Nian snuffled \u201cI hate you! I want to drink!\u201dXiao Yao poured wine for Ah Nian \u201cDrink!\u201dXiao Yao wanted Ah Nian to get raging drunk but Ah Nian talked about her memories with Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao thought about Jing and all the sorrow in her heart welled up and she couldn\u2019t help but drink along with her until she groggily pa.s.sed out asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter of Lost You Forever is beautiful and bittersweet for all three male leads. Each had a chance with Xiao Yao at some point in their interactions with her and either blew it (Jing), never did anything (Xiang Liu), or can\u2019t do anything (Zhuan Xu). Chapter 26 sticks them all together with her at a wedding and boy is it uncomfortable to watch. There\u2019s Zhuan Xu getting married so he can actually keep on protecting Xiao Yao the only way he knows how, to win the Xuan Yuan throne and make her entire existence safe. Jing\u2019s just wallowing in misery about being forced to marry Yi Yang after being tricked into sleeping with her. He let his enemies take advantage of him by not taking them out earlier, but it\u2019s a rock and a hard place choice since his enemies are his family which is exactly Jing\u2019s burden to bear. Xiang Liu\u2019s presence in Xiao Yao\u2019s life has morphed into\u00a0protector and soulmate openly, he shares in her misery and aids in bringing her solace. He\u2019s like the typical second male lead who just loves silently, except his alpha male personality and crackling interactions with Xiao Yao always leave the impression that they are mere seconds from throwing caution to the wind.It\u2019s always been like this since their first meeting now it\u2019s settled\u00a0into a quiet beautiful unspoken friends.h.i.+p.\u00a0He taught her archery so she can protect herself and makes the perfect priceless bow for her, she makes poisons that keep him strong (i.e. she is actually cooking for and feeding him, how quaint), and through it all they have that bug that links them together. This chapter finally reveals what that particular voodoo bug is called \u2013 it\u2019s the legendary and rare Lover\u2019s Bug. The true magnitude and requirements for planting and removing the Lover\u2019s Bug won\u2019t be divulged just yet, but it\u2019s going to be devastating to read later on as Xiao Yao\u2019s life is only going to get more and more complicated despite her desire for it to get less and less complicated. Zhuan Xu\u2019s quest for the throne is heading towards a make or break juncture soon and Xiao Yao\u2019s got to decide where her own life is headed once she doesn\u2019t need to help him anymore. Could she ever return to being sufficiently alone and bopping along carefree without a man or a mission in her life?Chapter 26 \u2013 The Returning Wind Carries Well-wishes:A year later in Zhi Yi Castle, Little Zhu Rong officiated the wedding for Prince Zhuan Xu to marry the only daughter of the Tan family as his princess consort. Xuan Yuan\u2019s Seventh Prince Yu Yang rushed to the wedding to stand in as Zhuan Xu\u2019s elder in lieu of the Yellow Emperor and bestowed Tan Shu Hui to Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu was the only grandson of the bloodline of the Yellow Emperor and Empress Lei Zhu. The Tan family was the head of the Middle Plains Six Big Families. Even though it was just a consort wedding and wasn\u2019t too big, but still plenty of powerful guests from within the vast wilderness came.Empress Lei Zhu came from the Four Great Clan\u2019s Xi Ling clan, so the current Xi Ling clan leader who was also Zhuan Xu\u2019s uncle brought his son to the wedding. It was the first official indication that the Xi Ling clan was going to back Zhuan Xu. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to any of the families in the vast wilderness, Zhuan Xu was ultimately Empress Lei Zhu\u2019s bloodline so the Xi Ling clan supporting him was to be expected.The biggest surprise was the arrival of the mysterious Gui Fang clan. It was a clan that no one dared to cross and they would mysteriously traverse the vast wilderness without leaving any signs. The clan appeared uninterested in anything the other clans cared about but this time one of its disciples brought a very extravagant wedding gift \u2013 Nine Stalks Soul Reversing Gra.s.s. When the present was presented, everyone present fell silent. Nine was the most ill.u.s.trious number, so the Gui Fang clan appeared to be showing its respect to Zhuan Xu. The way everyone saw it, the Gui Fang clan also seemed to have chosen to support Zhuan Xu.Among the Four Great Clans, the most nebulous of att.i.tudes came from the Chi Sui and the Tu Shan clans. Everyone knew Zhuan Xu was close to Feng Long but Feng Long was not the clan leader. Only the Chi Sui clan leader\u2019s clear indication could determine which way it fell.At Zhuan Xu\u2019s wedding, with all the clan and family leaders in attendance, the elders were non-stop busy observing and a.n.a.lyzing, fearful of one mistaken conclusion leading their clan or family into great calamity.Because the Xi Ling clan leader came all this way, Zhuan Xu felt it wasn\u2019t appropriate for others to welcome him, but he had no time to do it himself, so he specifically asked Xiao Yao to greet the Xi Ling clan leader.The Xi Ling clan leader saw Xiao Yao and was stunned for a moment. Before Xiao Yao could say anything, he said \u201cSeeing you, one look and it\u2019s clear your are the blood of Her highness Lei Zhu.\u201dXiao Yao respectfully greeted the Xi Ling clan leader \u201cYour niece greets Uncle.\u201dXiao Yao was the Gao Xing princess and ought not to pay such a big respect to the Xi Ling clan leader. But Xiao Yao\u2019s greeting made it clear, blood first with no regard to position. She was very sincere and the Xi Ling clan leader warmly accepted it and felt very happy. He introduced his son Xi Ling Chun to Xiao Yao. Xi Ling Chun greeted her rather shyly \u201cCousin.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and returned the greeting.Xiao Yao was afraid Ah Nian would cause a scene so kept her by her side and pulled her over and said to Xi Ling Chun \u201cThis is my little sister. Little brother Chun you can call her Ah Nian like we do.\u201dXi Ling Chun greeted Ah Nian and even though she was still in a bad mood, she was raised in a royal family so knew all the correct etiquette so she returned the greeting.The Xi Ling clan leader nodded his head in approval.When the auspicious hour arrived, amidst\u00a0trumpets and horns, Zhuan Xu and Shu Hui got married.Xiao Yao stood with the Xi Ling clan leader to watch the ceremony, one hand tightly clenching Ah Nian. Thankfully she did nothing other than keeping her head down as if she turned into a log.Seeing Zhuan Xu getting married, Xiao Yao plastered a smile on her face but had no happiness in her heart. They stumbled, they fell, they drifted, they fought, along the way her and Zhuan Xu both grew up and now he was getting married. But this wedding wasn\u2019t what Xiao Yao had envisioned.In her memories: her Eldest Uncle\u2019s wedding to the Sheng Nong Kingdom\u2019s Princess was a lavish ceremony. She and Zhuan Xu got in a fight, he said a married daughter was like water splashed outside. She remembered later her Fourth Auntie committing suicide, Zhuan Xu\u2019s nightly nightmares, her comfort that she would forever be with him. Zhuan Xu said she would marry one day and leave her, she innocently said that she wouldn\u2019t marry another, she would marry him\u2026\u2026Though the crowd and the noise, Zhuan Xu turned to look at Xiao Yao. When their eyes locked, both had a perfect seamless smile locked on their face: no matter what, at least we are both still alive, as long as we stay alive, nothing else matters!After the ceremony, the ushers invited the guests to be seated.The Four Great Clans were so lofty, plus the presence of Xuan Yuan, Gao Xing, and Sheng Nong tribes, those seven groups were placed in the center room and the rest of the families of the vast wilderness were seated outside, with many spilling out even into the courtyard.The Grand Emperor sent Ru So and Ju Mang to congratulate Zhuan Xu. Ju Mang was also a disciple of the Grand Emperor and was from a outsider tribe like Zhuan Xu was. He was alone in Gao Xing and his personality very strange, but because Zhuan Xu was so easygoing and got along with everyone, they became good friends.Xiao Yao accompanied her Uncle and Cousin into the center room and when Ah Nian saw the familiar faces she immediately rushed to Ru So\u2019s side. Xiao Yao and her Cousin flanked her Uncle\u2019s side.Everyone stood up. Because of the Xuan Yuan Empress Lei Zhu, even Prince Yu Yang stood up, and everyone greeted the Xi Ling clan leader.The Xi Ling clan leader chatted first with Yu Yang, then a few pleasantries with Ru So. Feng Long and Xing Yue paid their respects to him and because of their shared relatives, they chatted about this elder\u2019s health and that elder\u2019s current state. They appeared to be able to talk for a long time but the Xi Ling clan leader saw Jing sitting with his head lowered and brought everyone over and jokingly said in an angry tone \u201cJing, you\u2019ve got quite an att.i.tude now!\u201dChun and Jing were familiar with each other and Chun playfully said \u201cJing gege, last time I saw you, you were friendly and outgoing. How come it\u2019s been just a year and you\u2019re so standoffish?\u201dJing stood up and greeted the Xi Ling clan leader with a smile. Both the Xi Ling clan leader and Chun were startled to see a few strands of white hair on Jing\u2019s head. Chun was still a youth and he asked in shock \u201cJing gege, what happened to you?\u201dThe Xi Ling clan leader shot his son a look and Chun immediately shut up. The Xi Ling clan leader smiled and asked about the Grand Madam\u2019s health and whatnot and Jing answered all his questions.Xiao Yao hadn\u2019t seen Jing in over a year and seeing him like this, Xiao Yao maintained her smile and quietly stood next to the Xi Ling clan leader. She remembered in the ocean when he let his hair loose, the stirring in her heart. She remembered twining his hair around her fingers, each strand was a longing. Everything felt like yesterday but it was already black hair turned white and all longing severed.Xiao Yao felt her heart was being clawed at by a large hand, so painful it was like being ripped apart. She could only keep smiling when suddenly she felt her heart violently beating. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t maintain her fake smile anymore, much like a person could endure severe pain without any change in expression yet couldn\u2019t control\u00a0exhibiting bodily reaction to intense exercise. Xiao Yao clutched her chest and took a few deep breaths.Xing Yue hurriedly a.s.sisted her and asked in concern \u201cAre you okay?\u201dXiao Yao smiled and shook her head. The Xi Ling clan leader saw her face flushed bright red and quickly said \u201cI remember your const.i.tution is not strong, hurry and sit down to rest.\u201dXing Yue helped Xiao Yao to sit down at Jing\u2019s table.Jing anxiously put one hand on Xiao Yao\u2019s wrist while his other clutched the wine cup and transformed the wine into a fog. Everyone knew the Tu Shan clan had the power to mystify which was very useful for taking away pain. No one thought it weird what Jing was doing.Her heart continued to beat wildly and strongly, so much that she felt like all her blood was rus.h.i.+ng into her head. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t control it and muttered under her breath \u201cXiang Liu, will you cut it out already?\u201dEveryone only heard \u201ccut it out already\u201d, but Jing was sitting closest to her and he was completely familiar with Xiao Yao\u2019s voice, so he heard every word she said.Her heartbeat started to return to normal and Xiao Yao gently pulled her hand away from Jing \u201cThank you, I\u2019m fine now.\u201dJing pulled his hand back but it clenched into a tight fist to tamp down everything he was feeling.Xiao Yao stood up and politely thanked him before returned to the Xi Ling clan leader\u2019s side. He said \u201cLet\u2019s go sit down.\u201dJing asked Xing Yue \u201cDidn\u2019t you said she was all recovered?\u201dXing Yue angrily said \u201cZhuan Xu told me with his own mouth that she was all recovered. If you don\u2019t believe me, then from now on don\u2019t ask me about Xiao Yao!\u201dFeng Long shot Jing a look \u201cI suggest you not mess with her today!\u201dZhuan Xu arrived in his groom\u2019s outfit to toast the guests and everyone congratulated him \u201cCongrats, congrats!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and said \u201cCongrats!\u201d and the downed the cup in his\u00a0hand.Ah Nian had a p.i.s.sy face all day but she saw that Xing Yue could actually smile so she forced herself to smile and toasted Zhuan Xu \u201cCongrats!\u201dXiao Yao silently drank along with everyone. Zhuan Xu thanked the guests for their well-wishes and went outside to toast more guests.Xiao Yao said in a low voice \u201cCousin Chun, can you drink?\u201dChun admittd \u201cGu Ju has good hard alcohol, I\u2019m a Gu Ju region son so of course I can drink.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cToday there are so many guests, you follow behind your older cousin and drink on his behalf and watch out for him.\u201dShe was treating him like a real close family member without any reservation so Chun gladly agreed \u201cWill do.\u201d He stood up and snuck out behind Zhuan Xu.The Xi Ling clan leader smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cBefore coming I was afraid you guys would be like strangers and not get close right away, who knew you and Zhuan Xu are so easygoing and Chun also gets along with you guys. This is a relief!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cMy Gege and I stayed beside our grandmother for quite some time and hear her often talk about Gu Ju, she really wanted to go back.\u201dThe Xi Ling clan leader sighed \u201cAll these years, it\u2019s been hard on the Xi Ling clan, and even harder on Zhuan Xu. From now on, you cousins have to support each other.\u201d\u201cXiao Yao understands.\u201dThe Xi Ling clan leader said \u201cI\u2019m going to drink with some old friends to catch up. You don\u2019t need to keep an old fogey like me company, go play with your friends.\u201dXiao Yao knew the elders would drink and discuss matters, perhaps her Uncle would try to get more supporters behind Zhuan Xu. She said \u201cOkay, if Uncle you need anything then just have a maid come get me.\u201dXiao Yao saw Ru So pouring Ah Nian wine and knew what he was trying to do. She felt relieved and smiled at Ru So in thanks and saw him smile back in understanding.Xiao Yao reminded Hai Tang \u201cWhen the Princess is drunk, you take her back to Zhi Jin Court to sleep.\u201dHai Tang agreed and Xiao Yao left without any worry.Xiao Yao walked along the wall with her head lowered as she pa.s.sed the other guest tables.The sound of loud cheers reached her and Xiao Yao glanced over and her eyelid jumped and she stopped her footsteps. She stared at a table with a bowl in the middle and lots of young men were drinking and making merry. Fang Feng Bei, wearing a white embroidered robe, was standing there with a lazy smile.Xiao Yao felt the voodoo bug in her body but got no response. Xiao Yao gave up, was she the one who raised the bug or was it Xiang Liu? Xiang Liu could control her but she couldn\u2019t control Xiang Liu at all! Could it be that even voodoo bugs know how to fear the strong and sneer at the weak?Fang Feng Bei glanced over at Xiao Yao and she wanted to leave but stood there and didn\u2019t move for the longest time.Fang Feng Bei finally picked up a jug of wine and walked over to Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao turned and slowly walked while Fang Feng Bei followed behind her, gradually the sound of voices and noises faded behind them.She could smell the cloves from far away and followed the scent until she got to a cl.u.s.ter of clove trees. The flowers were blooming and the purple buds littered the ground.Xiao Yao sat cross-legged on the ground while Fang Feng Bei leaned against a tree and drank.Xiao Yao stared at him while he smiled down at her. She said nothing and he appeared to have no intention of speaking either.Finally Xiao Yao spoke first \u201cDid you attend Jing and Yi Yang\u2019s wedding?\u201d\u201cI may be irresponsible but I still would manage to attend my little sister\u2019s wedding to the Tu Shan clan leader.\u201d\u201cThe pain in my heart, do you feel it?\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s face turned red, not clear if it was\u00a0over\u00a0embarra.s.sment or frustration. The reason the heart was tucked deep inside the body was so that people\u2019s feelings, whether it was happiness or sorrow, would remain concealed. But right now her heart felt like it was stark naked before Xiang Liu, like she was stripped naked before him to observe.Xiang Liu softly chuckled \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid I will feel everything, then stop tormenting yourself. If your heart doesn\u2019t hurt, then I\u2019ll be better off as well.\u201dXiao Yao heard the last thing he said and immediately perked up \u201cIf my body hurts 9/10th, then you hurt 1/10th. But if my heart hurts, is it how much I feel you feel?\u201dXiang Liu honestly said \u201cYes! If your heart hurts how much is how my heart hurts how much. What of it? Are you planning to use that to reckon with me?\u201dXiao Yao was silent. He was right! She could inflict bodily pain on herself, but she couldn\u2019t make happiness or sadness.Xiang Liu suddenly said \u201cI\u2019m a killer for hire sometimes.\u201dXiao Yao looked quizzically at him and he said slowly \u201cIf you pay, I can kill Fang Feng Yi Yang and her child for you.\u201dXiao Yao smiled wanly \u201cThat is like the worst idea ever!\u201dXiang Liu said in a half sincere half joking way \u201cThen you stop giving yourself a heartache in the future. If you keep causing trouble for me, maybe I\u2019ll decide to kill you!\u201dXiao Yao pouted \u201cI didn\u2019t force you to take the voodoo bug into your body years ago.\u201d\u201cYears ago, I knew you were useless and would often get injured. But I didn\u2019t know you were this foolish and couldn\u2019t even protect your own heart.\u201dXiao Yao opened her mouth like she wanted to argue back but said nothing. She dejectedly lowered her head like a wilted sunflower.A winged horse trotted over and Xiang Liu vaulted on its back \u201cWant to go?\u201dXiao Yao raised her head and stared at Xiang Liu \u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cThe ocean.\u201dXiao Yao hesitated, this wasn\u2019t Qing Shui Town, the ocean was very far from the Middle Plains.Xiang Liu didn\u2019t rush her as his hand held the reins and he stared into the vast distance. The winged horse was also silent and stepped quietly in place.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t control her body and soul longing for the vast expanse of the ocean and she leaped up \u201cLet\u2019s go to the ocean.\u201dXiang Liu turned back and stared at Xiao Yao before he reached out his hand.Xiao Yao grabbed his hand and vaulted on the winged horse\u2019s back.The winged horse appeared to know it was time to leave and loudly whined. Xiang Liu whipped the reins and the horse flew into the air.Miao Pu rushed out and anxiously yelled \u201cPrincess!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cTell Gege I\u2019m leaving for a few days.\u201dWhen the winged horse left Zhi Yi Castle behind, Xiang Liu switched rides to his white condor.Xiao Yao sat on Furball and stared at Xiang Liu, feeling like it was another lifetime ago. She asked \u201cAren\u2019t you going to transform your hair color back?\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cThis is dyed and not transformation.\u201d\u201cWhy pick such a ha.s.sle of a method?\u201d\u201cThe first time it was to avoid making a mistake, later it became a habit.\u201dXiao Yao stared at the plump clouds pa.s.sing by and thought about Xiang Liu being hesitant and afraid of making a mistake and she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Xiang Liu appeared to know what she was thinking and casually said \u201cIn the beginning, even the biggest baddie is a callow youth like any other.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s smiled slowly disappeared.It was the middle of the night when they arrived in the deep ocean.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but stand up and she closed her eyes to in breath in deep ocean air.Xiang Liu grabbed her and suddenly vaulted off the back of the condor.She knew Xiang Liu wouldn\u2019t let her fall to death so she was just startled but not scared. She instead enjoyed the sensation of falling from up high.The wind whizzed past her ear like knives cutting and her skin was stinging in pain. Her entire body was being frozen by the cold air and only their joined hands felt a sliver of warmth.Xiao Yao suddenly thought \u2013 if she died falling like this, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.When they entered the ocean, it wasn\u2019t a huge splash like she imagined.When Xiao Yao opened her eyes, she curiously looked around. The ocean was parting for them ahead and closing for them behind. Their speed gradually decreased but they continued to sink into the depths.After some time, Xiao Yao felt the water pressure gently squeezing her. She held her breath until it was almost gone and she pointed to the surface to go up. Xiang Liu grabbed her hand and wouldn\u2019t let her go up.Xiao Yao furiously stared at him, was he trying to force her\u2026..to do that?Xiang Liu smiled and pulled Xiao Yao down with him deeper. Xiao Yao\u2019s face was turning blue and white and her brain was fighting with itself \u2013 kiss or no kiss?Back then it was because of her promise to Jing, but now it was all in the past and Jing was married. There was no reason for her to suffer for it anymore and risk her own life\u2026.Xiao Yao made her decision and pulled on Xiang Liu\u2019s arm and used it to propel her closer to him.Xiang Liu stood in the water and smiled at her. Xiao Yao was embarra.s.sed and frustrated and lowered her eyes because she didn\u2019t dare look at him. Right as she was about to kiss Xiang Liu, he suddenly turned his head and avoided her kiss and then starting laughing loudly.Xiao Yao was so embarra.s.sed she decided to just go die! She shook off his hand and didn\u2019t swim upward but instead dove deeper.Xiang Liu chased behind her and chuckled as he said \u201cDon\u2019t suffocated yourself to death! Try breathing. I didn\u2019t let you swim up not because I wanted to force you to\u2026..kiss me.\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s laughter rang out again \u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t need to do that anymore.\u201dXiao Yao tried breathing and it was just like when she put the fish amethyst in her mouth. She could breathe underwater like fish. Xiao Yao realized that when Xiang Liu gave her his essential soul blood, she gained some of his powers. From now on, she could be like the daughter of the sea and swim in the water in complete freedom.But at the moment Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t happy about that, but instead was so embarra.s.sed about what she just tried to do that she would rather slam her head in the water and kill herself.Xiao Yao was so furious she screamed \u201cXiang Liu, you\u2026.you did that on purpose! I hate you!\u201d She finished yelling and realized she was just like Xiang Liu and could now talk underwater.\u201cI, I can talk!\u201d Xiao Yao was stunned for a moment and then back to being furious \u201cXiang Liu, I hate you! How dare you keep laughing? If you keep laughing, I\u2019ll\u2026.I\u2019ll\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t think of anything she could use to torment him. He played the world and wanted for nothing, the only thing he cared about was the Sheng Nong resistance army, but even if Xiao Yao had ten guts she didn\u2019t dare to use the army to threaten Xiang Liu.Xiang Liu was still laughing and Xiao Yao was still so mortified and humiliated that she turned and started swimming away, only thinking she never wanted to see Xiang Liu again.Xiang Liu called out \u201cFine, I\u2019ll stop laughing\u201d but his voice was still full of mirth.Xiao Yao ignored him and swam earnestly. Xiang Liu said nothing more and if Xiao Yao swam fast then he sped up and if she swam slow then he slowed down, keeping pace beside her the entire time.The underwater world was desolate and mysterious, but still full of colorful wonders.The transparent and lissome jellyfish; all sorts of colorful sh.e.l.ls and clams; multi-hued fishes in all sizes; ambling starfish floating in the water really like the stars in the sky\u2026.After swimming for a long time, Xiao Yao forgot she was angry and her body and soul was immersed in the water world.In the past, no matter how much she loved the water, she was still her and water was still water. Even with the fish amethyst there was still a barrier between them. But this time she felt like she was part of the water, she could stay in the water forever.Xiang Liu suddenly asked \u201cDoes it feel strange?\u201dXiao Yao turned a few times and swam on top him and stared at Xiang Liu \u201cIt does feel strange that my body isn\u2019t like before.\u201dXiang Liu coolly said \u201cThis is the price you paid to stay alive, to become a monster.\u201dXiao Yao was startled and remembered that one time when Xiang Liu was healing her he whispered \u201cDon\u2019t hate me.\u201dXiang Liu saw Xiao Yao dazed and saying nothing and felt she was upset that her body had turned deviant. He laughed and sped up quickly and zoomed right past Xiao Yao and swam towards the ocean depths.Xiao Yao reacted and quickly went to chase him \u201cXiang Liu, Xiang Liu\u2026..\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t catch up to him, and even though Xiang Liu didn\u2019t abandon her fully, he kept his wide distance and never looked back, leaving only his distant figure in her eyes.\u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201d Xiao Yao screamed suddenly and curled up into a ball like she had been bitten by something.The second Xiang Liu turned around he was right next to Xiao Yao. He reached out his hand but immediately realized that he and Xiao Yao were linked by the bug so if she was really hurt then he would feel it. He reached back his hand but Xiao Yao already tightly grabbed it and smiled deviously at him.Xiang Liu coldly said \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then let go!\u201dXiao Yao looked at Xiang Liu and released his hand but then grabbed his sleeve and shook it \u201cI\u2019m just kidding! Don\u2019t be so mean!\u201dXiang Liu ignored Xiao Yao and swam forward but she held onto his sleeve and stayed right beside him \u201cMy body is different than other G.o.ds but I don\u2019t see this as a price to pay for living, I think of it as getting a great gift! I\u2019m so happy about it!\u201dXiang Liu continued to ignore Xiao Yao but didn\u2019t shake her hand off.Xiao Yao continued to natter \u201cYou\u2019re a Nine-headed demon, you have nine-lives and you spent one on saving me. I can swim in the ocean freely like you now. If I die again and you give another of your lives to save me, will I become even more like you\u2026\u2026.\u201dXiang Liu stared at Xiao Yao and his face was as placid as the water.Xiao Yao\u2019s voice got smaller and smaller \u201cBecome, become\u2026..I mean\u2026..\u201d She suddenly started to chuckle like a fool \u201cI, forget I said anything!\u201dXiang Liu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s neck and moved his face right in front of her face and said each word carefully \u201cIf you dare die again, I will cut you into nine pieces, perfect for each of my heads to eat a piece!\u201dXiao Yao shook her head hard \u201cCan\u2019t you be more gentle? It\u2019s hard for you to save me, if you choke me to death, how could you bear it?\u201d After she said that XIao Yao suddenly realized what she just said and jerked her head up and stared into Xiang Liu\u2019s eyes for a long moment. She suddenly laughed \u201cI mean how can you bear wasting more of your essential soul blood.\u201dXiang Liu smiled and his two teeth sharpened into fangs \u201cDo you want me to show you now?\u201dXiao Yao grabbed her neck and pulled back \u201cNo, no, I know you can bear to waste it since you can just eat it all back later if you want!\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s fangs retracted and he swam off. Xiao Yao rushed to catch up to him. Xiao Yao gradually caught up and a colorful school of fish swam past them.Xiao Yao reached out her hand and the colorful fishes kissed her palms and she could feel their simple joy \u201cThey are so simple like they have no feelings.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cThis type of fish have very short memories. When you pull your hand back, they will have forgotten they kissed your palm.\u201dWithout memory there was longer, happiness or joy, so their peaceful simplicity was truly the most organic in the world.Xiao Yao swam and turned back to look at the colorful fishes still swimming back and forth \u201cI remember them but they\u2019ve already forgotten me. In the future when I see the same type of fish I\u2019ll remember them so that each new meeting is like a reunion, but each meeting for them is a new meeting, so even a real reunion is like a first meeting.\u201dXiang Liu asked \u201cDo you want to remember or forget?\u201dXiao Yao thought about it \u201cRemember, even if it\u2019s painful and a burden, I still want to remember.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly stopped and strained to listen as a melodic singing drifted to her, so beautiful even her soul was quaking, it was a sound not to be heard in the world above. But Xiao Yao remembered that she heard it before.Xiang Liu said \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe mating song of the merpeople.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Xiang Liu stared at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao acted nonchalantly with a smile \u201cI guessed it. Legend says the merpeople have incredibly melodic voices so from who else in the deep ocean but the merpeople to sing like that?\u201d Xiang Liu didn\u2019t want her to know that when she was unconscious the things he did with her, and she didn\u2019t want him to know that she already knew. Their embraces and companions.h.i.+p, just let it be buried deep in the dark ocean depths!Xiang Liu said \u201cThe merpeople\u2019s song is very beautiful but it\u2019s also a weapon. Rumor has it that Gao Xing\u2019s Prince Yen Long heard the sound of the merpeople and devised a kill attack from it.\u201dXiao Yao \u201cCan we go sneak a peek at them?\u201dXiang Liu had a look of discomfort for the first time ever.Xiao Yao pleaded \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a merperson, and if I miss this chance who know when I\u2019ll get another chance.\u201dXiang Liu reached out his hand \u201cThey are very alert things, I need to mask your presence.\u201dXiao Yao took his hand and slowly swam behind him.Xiao Yao saw them.The merpeople had the body of a person and the tail of a fish. The mermaid had thick l.u.s.trous hair like seaweed, brilliant gem-like eyes, snow white skin, beautiful and exotic; the merman was comparatively ugly but strongly built with thick chest muscles and arms, very powerful. He was raising a giant clam sh.e.l.l above him while chasing the mermaid and singing his song. The mermaid ran from him but sang back, fast and swift she darted so the merman couldn\u2019t touch her.In the pursuit, the mermaid appeared to be moved and slowed down. The merman opened his giant clam sh.e.l.l and inside was a purple pearl the size of a fist glowing brightly.The mermaid smiled and swam into the clam sh.e.l.l and picked up the pearl and happily sang to it. She appeared to have accepted the merman and was praising him.The merman also swam into the clam sh.e.l.l and embraced the mermaid before enthusiastically kissing her. Their tails intertwined and was rhythmically thumping.Xiang Liu tried to pull Xiao Yao away but she wouldn\u2019t leave \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t answer her and Xiao Yao thought about it before suddenly realizing \u2013 they were mating! She swiftly turned around.The two merpeople in the clam sh.e.l.l sensed movement and both exposed their sharp teeth and looked over angrily. Xiang Liu grabbed Xiao Yao and swam for it.When it was certain the merpeople wasn\u2019t going to catch up, Xiao Yao incredulously asked \u201cAre you afraid of them?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them, but for them to notice we were peeping at them\u2026..that\u2019s not something to be proud of!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was beet red \u201cHow was I to know they would be so direct?\u201d\u201cIn this world, other than the G.o.ds and the humans, all other living beings are direct in mating. From the percentages, direct is the natural way and the unnatural way is you guys. So you have no right to be upset at them.\u201dXiao Yao immediately surrendered \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m in the wrong.\u201dXiang Liu stifled a smile.Xiao Yao curiously asked \u201cWhy did the merman carry a giant clam sh.e.l.l?\u201d\u201cThe clam sh.e.l.l is their home, and the larger the clam sh.e.l.l the harder to catch, so the mermen display their strength in wooing the mermaids to mate by displaying their catch. They mate in the clam sh.e.l.l and bear their offspring there. The pearl inside is actually the innards of the clam sh.e.l.l demons, and will become the food fed to the baby merchildren.\u201dXiao Yao remembered when she was asleep for thirty-seven years, it was inside a giant clam sh.e.l.l. She didn\u2019t pay attention after she woke up but she remembered it was all white, and there seemed to be wave pattern ridges along the edges. She didn\u2019t remember how big it was though. Xiao Yao wanted to ask Xiang Liu but was too embarra.s.sed to bring it up. She now regretted not carefully observing the clam sh.e.l.l she slept in for thirty-seven years to see what it looked like.Xiang Liu noticed Xiao Yao was saying nothing but her face was gradually turning red again. He coughed lightly \u201cI know you\u2019re pretty shameless and thick skinned, who knew you\u2019d be wrangled to behave by a pair of merpeople.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Xiang Liu and it was the rare instance when she didn\u2019t have a quip back.The two of them aimlessly ambled in the ocean until Xiao Yao got tired and laid down in the water and couldn\u2019t move anymore.Xiang Liu asked her \u201cTired?\u201dXiao Yao was tired and sleepy and murmured \u201cI\u2019m just going to close my eyes for a second.\u201d And she promptly fell asleep. With the water as her cus.h.i.+on, it was soft but continuously moving so her sleep was being jostled.A pure white enormous clam sh.e.l.l floated over to them and slowly opened when it arrived next to them. Xiang Liu picked up Xiao Yao in his arm and gingerly placed her inside the clam sh.e.l.l. He didn\u2019t sleep and instead leaned against the clam sh.e.l.l and stared at the glittering starfish in the distance.Xiao Yao hadn\u2019t slept through the night for the past year and would even wake up two or three times a night. Sometimes she needed sleeping pills on particularly bad nights to even fall asleep.This sleep was deep and restful and she didn\u2019t even had a single dream. When she was about to wake up, she finally had a dream and it was one where she was picking stars in the ocean. The ocean stars were growing like mushrooms in the mountains and she plucked one after another and it was in all sorts of colors. She ate one and discovered it was sweet. Xiao Yao laughed happily as she picked more and she actually laughed out loud and woke herself up with her laugh. She realized it was a dream but kept her eyes closed to remain happily ensconced in the happy dream.Xiao Yao opened her eyes and saw Xiang Liu leaning against the clam sh.e.l.l next to her, one leg straight and the other curved with his arm resting on it as he lowered his head to stare at her, a smile curving on his lips. Xiao Yao smiled and stretched and sweetly said \u201cI had a happy dream.\u201dXiang Liu answered \u201cI know.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly realized they were in a clam sh.e.l.l and wanted to immediately check it out but was afraid her intentions would be too obvious so forced herself to be patient. She continued laying for a bit before slowly getting up and acting all nonchalant as she looked around. It was the same clam sh.e.l.l, all white in color with wave ripple ridges. It was beautiful.The clam sh.e.l.l was enormous and even with the two of them inside it wasn\u2019t a tight squeeze at all. She slept here for thirty-seven years with Xiang Liu, would that be equivalent of sleeping in the same bed and sharing the same pillow? Those two merpeople saw the clam sh.e.l.l as their home, how did Xiang Liu view this clam sh.e.l.l?Xiao Yao suddenly felt all sorts of thoughts and feelings rush up and her face burned as her heart sped up.Xiao Yao chastised herself and tried desperately to control her feelings and reactions, but she couldn\u2019t control her heartbeat. Just like that, Xiang Liu sensed it and looked over at her. Xiao Yao quickly said \u201cI\u2019m hungry! So hungry I\u2019m all nerves!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was so red it was like a burning sunset and she forced her eyes wide open to stare at Xiang Liu. His heartbeat quickened a few times and Xiao Yao sensed it. But then it was gone just like that and she wondered if it was her mistaken sensation.Xiang Liu casually said \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dXiang Liu led the way as they swam up to the surface. Xiao Yao turned to look back and saw the clam sh.e.l.l slowly closing like a flower.When they reached the surface it was already sunset. Xiao Yao realized they spent a day and a night under the sea. Xiang Liu took Xiao Yao to an island, Xiao Yao grilled two fishes for herself and roasted a giant suckling pig sized fish for Xiang Liu. She used a conch sh.e.l.l to make a seafood soup. She carried her herb pouch with her everywhere but she didn\u2019t use any seasonings on her fish but sprinkled it on Xiang Liu\u2019s fish. It wasn\u2019t even done cooking yet but the mouthwatering scent wafted everywhere.Xiao Yao stared at it and started drooling but she didn\u2019t have the guts to eat it and instead docilely ate\u00a0her two fish.Xiang Liu took a bite of his fish and made a rare compliment to Xiao Yao \u201cThe taste is pretty good.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and asked \u201cI\u2019ll drink the soup first, and then afterwards I\u2019ll season it for you. Do you mind drinking after me?\u201dXiang Liu casually replied \u201cYou drink first!\u201dXiao Yao drank her soup and felt full and warm as her clothes were dry by now. She was very relaxed and comfortable and sprinkled poison in the soup and it mixed with the seafood to make an even more tasty flavor.Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t afraid of the heat and picked up the conch sh.e.l.l and drank the soup directly as he ate the fish.Xiao Yao wrapped her arms around her knees and stared at the stars in the sky and listened to the waves cras.h.i.+ng on the rocks.After Xiang Liu was done eating he said \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t move and continued to stare at the ocean. If it was possible, she really wanted to live like this for the rest of her life.\u201cXiao Yao?\u201d Xiang Liu stood before Xiao Yao. She raised her head to stare at him and smiled \u201cDon\u2019t you feel like today was a day we stole to spend together? That there is only now and no tomorrow!\u201dXiang Liu was taken aback and said nothing. Xiao Yao pointed to the horizon \u201cWhat\u2019s over there?\u201d\u201cEndless ocean.\u201d\u201cNo land?\u201d\u201cScattered islands.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of islands?\u201d\u201cSome islands have not even a blade of gra.s.s, others as beautiful as a dreamscape.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cI really want to go see.\u201dXiang Liu remained silent and then whistled once before Furball arrived. He vaulted on its back and Xiao Yao had no choice but to stand up and climb on.As they got close to Zhi Yi, Xiang Liu switched to his winged horse.As they reached Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence, they ran into someone leaving and a cloud carriage was about to rise. Xiang Liu pulled back on his winged horse and the driver on the other side also pulled back and the two sides avoided a collision.Xiang Liu patted his winged ride to calm it while the cloud carriage window opened. Xiang Liu saw it was Jing and smiled \u201cMy apologies!\u201dJing said \u201cWe were at fault as well.\u201dXiao Yao ignored Jing and jumped off the winged ring and said to Xiang Liu \u201cWill you be in Zhi Yi in the coming days?\u201d\u201cMaybe, or maybe not.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and sighed \u201cI\u2019m off.\u201dXiang Liu nodded and Xiao Yao ran into Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence.Jing slowly closed the window and said to Hu Ya \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dXiao Yao found Xing Yue who said \u201cZhuan Xu just stayed one night and then took Shu Hui to Sheng Nong Mountain. Why don\u2019t you stay here tonight!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cNext time, I need to hurry back. I didn\u2019t tell Zhuan Xu before leaving with Fang Feng Bei to play, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s p.i.s.sed so can you have a cloud carriage take me back to Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cI won\u2019t urge you to stay then. I\u2019ll have it arranged immediately and you can leave shortly.\u201dXing Yue walked Xiao Yao out and Xiao Yao asked \u201cI\u2019ve been busy with Gege\u2019s wedding planning and haven\u2019t had time to chat with you. How are you holding up?\u201dXing Yue sighed with a wan smile \u201cBeing sad is to be expected, but since I\u2019ve decided to follow your Gege, I knew this day would come so it\u2019s not that hard to bear.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know what to say and only patted her hand.Xing Yue helped Xiao Yao on the cloud carriage \u201cWhen you have time come see me more often, don\u2019t grow distant because of Jing gege.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and agreed. The cloud carriage rose into the air and her face fell.It was nighttime when she arrived at Zhi Jin Court.Xiao Yao rushed into the court and saw Zhuan Xu, Shu Hui, and Ah Nian having dinner. Shu Hui immediately stood up when she saw Xiao Yao. Zhuan Xu glanced at Xiao Yao and his face was impa.s.sive as he ignored her.Xiao Yao greeted Shu Hui \u201cSister-in-law, please sit. No formalities in the family.\u201dShu Hui\u2019s face was red and she shyly sat down.Ah Nian tossed her chopsticks and rushed out and Xiao Yao make a quick excuse \u201cI\u2019ll dine with my little sister privately, Gege and sister-in-law continue with dinner!\u201dXiao Yao caught up to Ah Nian who was walking and wiping her tears.Xiao Yao wanted to stop her but Ah Nian pushed her aside \u201cWhere\u2019d you go? You smell like the ocean, don\u2019t get close to me.\u201dXiao Yao smiled wryly, this girl doesn\u2019t even forget to be bratty even when she\u2019s sad.Entering Ah Nian\u2019s residence, Hai Tang ordered the maids to bring dinner. Xiao Yao said to Ah Nian \u201cYou eat first, I\u2019m going to wash up.\u201d Xiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head \u201cThe way you look at everything is from whether you like something or dislike something.\u201d\u201cHow can I be more like Xing Yue?\u201d\u201cYou envy her?\u201dAh Nian bit her lip and reluctantly nodded her head \u201cI feel like Gege will like a girl like Xing Yue more, capable and smart, worldly and well-behaved, a woman who knows when to push forward and when to give in.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cAh Nian, you might be somewhat arrogant and self-absorbed, and rash, but you don\u2019t need to be like Xing Yue.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid Gege will dislike me.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and shook her head \u201cHe watched you grow up, he knows exactly what your personality is. When he had nothing he treated you so well, in the future when he has everything he will also treat you well.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026..\u201d\u201cAll you need to change is to control your temper. Don\u2019t blame your unhappiness on other women. If you really want to hate someone, then hate Zhuan Xu.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hate him\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Ah Nian\u2019s eyes were teary and red.Xiao Yao said \u201cLike I said, your temper will only lead others to look down on Zhuan Xu. Everyone is watching Zhuan Xu\u2019s each and every move right now, so it will be harmful to him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll change my temper. If I\u2019m not happy, I\u2019ll walk away.\u201d\u201cAh Nian, I\u2019ll ask you one last time \u2013 are you certain you want to follow Zhuan Xu?\u201dAh Nian said with absolutely certainty \u201cI want to be with Zhuan Xu gege.\u201d\u201cCan you accept that he will only have a little portion of his time to spend with you?\u201d\u201cI said that I would rather than a percent of Gege\u2019s niceness to me, then a hundred percent of another man.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cThen listen to your Jiejie, ignore the women around Zhuan Xu. Whether it\u2019s Xing Yue, or this one, or that one, you don\u2019t need to pay attention to any of them. Since you can\u2019t change anything, then act like they don\u2019t exist. You just need to enjoy every moment Zhuan Xu spends with you. When he\u2019s off spending time with other women, then you can act like he\u2019s off working on important matters.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.what if Gege is entranced by another woman and forgets me?\u201dZhuan Xu entranced by a woman? Not unless that woman was named Absolute Royal Power. Xiao Yao laughed out loud and Ah Nian pursed her lips.Xiao Yao controlled her laughter and said \u201cAs long as you are Ah Nian then Zhuan Xu will never forget you. You are different then all of them which is why Zhuan Xu keeps trying to drive you away. He would never be so considerate to all those other women!\u201dAh Nian didn\u2019t understand and stared at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao knew Ah Nian had to get over this hump and said very sternly \u201cZhuan Xu will never forget you for another woman. If you follow him and can\u2019t deal with that and are always having a temper, then he might drift from you.\u201dAh Nian understood this and thought about it \u201cJiejie, trust me, since this is my decision, I won\u2019t have a temper anymore.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThen do you believe what I said to you?\u201dAh Nian said \u201cYou are Gege\u2019s closest person, whatever you say I believe you.\u201d Once she couldn\u2019t stand how close Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu were which is why she had a temper towards Xiao Yao. Later when other women showed up, her anger towards Xiao Yao decreased and she started remembering how good Xiao Yao was to her.Xiao Yao lovingly pinched Ah Nian\u2019s cheeks \u201cDon\u2019t go emulating Xing Yue, you can\u2019t learn it even if you tried. Just be the Ah Nian who can control her temper. Let Dad and I handle the other stuff for you.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s nose got stuffy and she said in a low voice \u201cAm I extraordinarily stupid and need you guys to constantly worry about me?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIntelligence can breed conflict, a woman needs to be a dash more clueless to keep her happiness intact.\u201dAh Nian smiled \u201cThen am I lucky and can keep on being stupid?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cStupid girl, go eat your dinner!\u201dZhuan Xu ignored Xiao Yao for ten straight days and Xiao Yao refused to admit she did anything wrong. She would only flit around him smiling and if he ignored her then she would keep smiling and flit away.After ten days it was Zhuan Xu who gave in first, when Xiao Yao flitted by with a smile he said in annoyance \u201cIf you have nothing to do, then take Ah Nian down the mountain to play and stop being an eyesore around here!\u201dXiao Yao made a face to Shu Hui and then sat down next to Zhuan Xu \u201cI\u2019ll take Ah Nian to find Xing Yue who has been complaining that I don\u2019t hang out with her anymore. Maybe we\u2019ll stay there for a few days.\u201d\u201cGo!\u201dXiao Yao looked at Shu Hui \u201cWant to go, sister-in-law?\u201dShu Hui glanced at Zhuan Xu and blushed \u201cI\u2019ll pa.s.s this time, next time I\u2019ll go see cousin Xing Yue.\u201dXiao Yao took Ah Nian to visit Xing Yue who naturally asked they to stay. Xing Yue thought Xiao Yao would decline because of Ah Nian but who knew Xiao Yao accepted immediately.Ah Nian knew Xiao Yao was doing this to even out her temper, and she really wanted to try and get rid of her quicksilver temper as well. She tried using a natural att.i.tude towards Xing Yue and stop thinking of her as someone trying to take her Zhuan Xu gege away. Ah Nian reminded herself that Zhuan Xu gege would never be taken away, he would only drift away on his own if her temper wasn\u2019t changed.In the beginning, every time Xiao Yao and Xing Yue talked, Ah Nian would respond stiffly with an expressionless face. Sometimes Xing Yue purposely tried to get a rise out of her and would happily chatter about her interactions with Zhuan Xu. Ah Nian almost lost it a few times but every time she was about to explode she saw Xiao Yao sitting to the side grinning at her so she gritted her teeth and endured.As the days pa.s.sed, Ah Nian discovered that enduring wasn\u2019t such a difficult thing. With the first time, there was the second time, and the third time, and by the fourth time it became rather effortless. Patience and endurance was itself a habit and need to be developed. When she calmed down and actually listened to what Xing Yue said, Ah Nian had a realization that the Zhuan Xu that Xing Yue saw wasn\u2019t the full Zhuan Xu.Ah Nian had a strange sense of having an advantage and she started to really understand what Xiao Yao said. In the future no matter how many women Zhuan Xu had, Zhuan Xu would never be really himself with them because he was no longer himself. She was forever unique among all the women.Ah Nian got increasingly calmer and a few times Xing Yue mentioned Zhuan Xu and how she was to him, Ah Nian wanted to snap back about how nice Zhuan Xu was to her but she saw the lazily sprawled Xiao Yao give her a look and Ah Nian s.h.i.+vered and whatever she was about to say went right back into her.Afterwards Ah Nian was upset since she was afraid of her dad and Zhuan Xu gege but when did she become afraid of Xiao Yao as well? After Xing Yue left, Ah Nian asked Xiao Yao \u201cWhy did you glare at me? If she can talk about it, why can\u2019t I?\u201dXiao Yao breezily said \u201cIs wine better right after it\u2019s done or after it\u2019s been stored for some time?\u201dZhuan Xu learned how to make wine from the Grand Emperor for a long time and Ah Nian often a.s.sisted so she immediately said \u201cOf course sealing and storing! A real good wine, the long its stored, the better it is!\u201dXiao Yao waved her hand \u201cThen you already know the answer.\u201dAh Nian quietly thought about it and realized that what she experienced with Gege was life\u2019s littlest things and shouldn\u2019t be used to boast. Plus why should she let other women know how good Zhuan Xu was? Only she knows it, isn\u2019t that even better?Xiao Yao saw that Ah Nian understood and sighed \u201cIn this world, even the Heavens will envy the good things, the happy things. Such things is best kept to oneself. Taking it out to boast, if the Heavens heard it, maybe it\u2019ll be taken away.\u201d Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know if the Heavens will take it away, but she knew others would try.Ah Nian remembered her dad saying once \u201cSince the dawn of time, the Heavens do not let people do as they wish\u201d, which probably is what Xiao Yao meant now! Ah Nian said \u201cI understand.\u201dXiao Yao and Ah Nian lived at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence for two months and by the time they left, Xing Yue and Ah Nian were friendly and chatty with each other. Even Xing Yue couldn\u2019t believe it, was Ah Nian really the Princess who exploded at an instant? No matter how she tried to push Ah Nian\u2019s b.u.t.tons, Ah Nian remained calm and even appeared to have a mirth in her eyes like she was keeping a delightful secret. She started to have a little bit of Xiao Yao\u2019s att.i.tude.Arriving at Zhi Jin Palace, Ah Nian was even nicer to Shu Hui than before, because in Ah Nian\u2019s eyes only Xing Yue was a worthy compet.i.tor to her so Ah Nian didn\u2019t pay any heed to anyone else.Zhuan Xu was stunned and asked Xiao Yao \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d\u201cNot me, she did it herself. A woman\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao sighed \u201cWould give her life for her man, who else can\u2019t she do?\u201dZhuan Xu heard the other meaning in Xiao Yao\u2019s words and decided not to dig deeper and changed the subject to Xiao Yao \u201cYou no longer have any relations.h.i.+p with Jing. Feng Long tested me on whether you would consider him.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yao was stunned for a moment \u201cEven though Jing is married, but I have no intention at this time of considering another man.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and then said \u201cYou treated Jing special but he didn\u2019t stay true\u2026\u2026he will regret it one day!\u201dXiao Yao looked saddened \u201cWhat good will his regret bring me? Since we can\u2019t be together, better to forget it completely and go our separate ways!\u201d\u201cYou still haven\u2019t forgotten him?\u201dXiao Yao wanted to say \u201cI forgot him!\u201d but she couldn\u2019t lie to herself. Since losing Jing she never slept through the night again.She missed him! Her longing for Jing exceeded anything that anyone could have imagined, and it even shocked herself.She thought she controlled everything so perfectly. Even if Jing left she could candidly accept it. But when it happened she realized that she thought too highly of herself. She could use her willpower to handle everything and control her behavior so she wasn\u2019t angry, wasn\u2019t upset, didn\u2019t act out of turn, didn\u2019t go see him, continued living as if nothing was the matter. But every night she couldn\u2019t control her missing him.One time she dreamed about Jing kissing her and it was as sweet as dew in her dream, but when she woke it was only bitterness in her mouth, even drinking honey water it turned bitter.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to remember and would rather not open her eyes and keep it tightly shut. All she could see would be them together and the memory was so clear and the warmth was still lingering on her lips. But everything was gone.Every time she thought of him she would rather never see him or hear him speak. Everything about him no longer had anything to do with her. His presence would no longer be in her life. That kind of pain made Xiao Yao feel like she would rather live in a dream and never wake up.Xiao Yao said in a low voice \u201cI thought everything was under my control, but in truth feelings cannot be controlled.\u201dZhuan Xu patted her back and sighed \u201cI\u2019ll drink with you!\u201dXiao Yao wanted to get raging drunk \u201cSure!\u201dZhuan Xu had Shan Hu go get some jugs of hard alcohol and two drinking bowls.Xiao Yao toasted a big bowl with Zhuan Xu and he didn\u2019t even blink an eye before pouring her bowl full again.Xiao Yao started getting drunk and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou pick me a man!\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cWhat kind of man do you want?\u201d\u201cMy companion in life, dispel loneliness, nothing else matters. But the critical element is that he can\u2019t have another woman! Otherwise I\u2019ll castrate him!\u201dZhuan Xu appeared to be lost in thought and the wine bowl was overflowing but he kept pouring. Xiao Yao laughed \u201cDid I shock you? But I\u2019m being serious!\u201dZhuan Xu waved his hand and the wine spilled on the table disappeared into fog.Xiao Yao picked up her bowl \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s like Grandfather said, love can only be encountered and cannot be forced. If one picks the right partner, then to grow old together in mutual respect isn\u2019t hard. I no longer trust my choice so you pick one for me!\u201dZhuan Xu said slowly \u201cOkay, if you want then I\u2019ll pick someone for you. If he can\u2019t do what you require, then forget you castrating him, I\u2019ll dice him into pieces first!\u201dXiao Yao laughed and then sprawled drunkenly on Zhuan Xu\u2019s lap \u201cMy Gege is the most reliable.\u201dZhuan Xu held his bowl in one hand and his other hand stroked Xiao Yao\u2019s end, but on his face was a smile filled with despair.A year later, Fang Feng Yi Yang delivered a baby boy that the Grand Madam bestowed the name Zhen.The Tu Shan Grand Madam saw Jing a.s.sume the clan leader mantle and saw that Hou would not compete for the leaders.h.i.+p with Jing, and saw her great-grandson born. She finally lasted until everything she wanted came true.Not a month after Tu Shan Zhen was born, the Grand Madam held Hou and Jing in each hand and peacefully pa.s.sed with a smile on her face.The courageous and stubborn woman who lost her husband young, then lost her son, lasted through the hundred year battle between Xuan Yuan and Sheng Nong, used her fragile body to protect the entire Tu Shan clan, after her pa.s.sing the clan elders unanimously agreed the entire vast wilderness Tu Shan businesses would be in mourning for a month. It was the first time such an honor was bestowed on someone not the clan leader, but not a single Tu Shan clan member objected.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t want Xiao Yao to have anything to do with Jing so didn\u2019t tell her the Grand Madam pa.s.sed. It was only when Xiao Yao went to deliver poisons to Xiang Liu at a Tu Shan clan messenger store that she learned of her pa.s.sing.When Xiao Yao treated her back then, she thought the Grand Madam would at most live a year. Who knew she would last another two more years. It was likely due to Hou and Jing\u2019s filial care for her that she lasted until her great-grandson was born.The Grand Madam died without any regrets, but did she realized she left many regrets in others?Xiao Yao was in a daze when she returned to Sheng Nong Mountain and heard from Miao Pu \u201cSe Mai Er is asking to see you. Xiao Xiao asked her to wait at the foot of the mountain but she appears to be anxious to leave.\u201dXiao Yao took the cloud carriage down to see Se Mai Er.When Se Mai Er saw Xiao Yao, she immediately kneeled and bowed and Xiao Yao a.s.sisted her up \u201cI don\u2019t leave the mountain much these days so I just learned of the Grand Madam\u2019s pa.s.sing. What are your plans now?\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cThe Grand Madam left me a great boon before she pa.s.sed, she permitted me to return to my home in Jiu Li and I wanted to say farewell to the Princess before I departed.\u201dMiao Pu pursed her lips \u201cThe Grand Madam finally did a good thing, but the Princess was planning to get you out of the Tu Shan clan no matter what after the Grand Madam pa.s.sed.\u201dXiao Yao rapped Miao Pu on the head \u201cDon\u2019t talk useless nonsense here! Go get the items with Shan Hu and bring it here for Se Mai Er.\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cNo need! No need!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou left home young and will return old, you need to bring some gifts back.\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cThe clan leader already gave me much.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes flashed a quick sadness and she smiled \u201cThe clan leader\u2019s gesture is his, my gift is mine!\u201dXiao Yao hesitated and then asked \u201cAfter the Grand Madam pa.s.sed, how is the Tu Shan clan leader doing?\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look good. In the past he was eloquent and sociable, but in the last two three years other than smiling when being filial to the Grand Madam, I\u2019ve never see him smile elsewhere.\u201dXiao Yao hid her worry and said nothing. Se Mai Er knew Xiao Yao had something that went on with Jing and was afraid she was sad so changed the subject \u201cAfter the Grand Madam pa.s.sed, three days later Master Hou\u2019s wife Lan Mu also pa.s.sed.\u201dXiao Yao thought and remembered that una.s.suming weak girl. In Qing Qiu, she saw her many times but she never spoke. Xiao Yao said \u201cHow can that be? She didn\u2019t look ill.\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cIt was apparently about Master Hou have a woman on the side. She likely said something and Hou struck her a few times. She committed suicide by taking poison. Word was that before she died, she tried to go talk to the clan leader for him to be the judge of things.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cShe\u2019s a sad woman.\u201dSe Mai Er sighed \u201cA woman\u2019s biggest fear is to give her heart to the wrong man!\u201dXiao Yao stared at the tea cup in her hand and said nothing.Se Mai Er looked around to make sure they were alone and then said \u201cThe voodoo bug the Princess mentioned before, I thought and thought and still have no idea what it is. But I did remember a legend that circulated in Jiu Li about a very rare voodoo bug.\u201dXiao Yao perked up and listened carefully \u201cWhat kind of bug?\u201dSe Mai Er explained \u201cMost voodoo bugs are parent-child bugs. The parent bug can control the child bug, and this kind of bug is easy to raise and easy to plant. But legend has it there is a rare extremely difficult to raise and plant bug. That bug has a gender difference and is split into a male bug and a female bug. It is hard to raise and even harder to plant. If a woman raised the bug, she needs to find a man to plant it. If a man raised the bug, he needs to find a woman to plant it. Almost always this bug is raised but cannot be planted even in a lifetime. So this bug remains just a legend in Jiu Li.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of bug is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of bug it is but I do know its name. It\u2019s called a Lover\u2019s Bug and legend says \u201cLover\u2019s Bug, Heart to Heart.\u201d It sounds a lot like what Princess described.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned and in a daze. She then asked \u201cIf a woman raised the bug, she needs to find a man to plant it in. But this world had plenty of men and women, how hard would it be to plant the bug! How could this bug be so hard to plant a lifetime could pa.s.s and it still wouldn\u2019t be planted?\u201dSe Mai Er shook her head and said apologetically \u201cI learned too little back then and listened to this but didn\u2019t ask more questions thinking it just a legend. But our Voodoo King will know. If Princess has time, please visit Jiu Li! Even though the outside considers us scary evil people, but our people are actually quite wonderful!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWhen I have the chance, I will definitely visit Jiu Li.\u201dSe Mai Er said \u201cI feel liPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat makes Lost You Forever that much more impressive is that Tong Hua does serious mythology building and tells a story beyond romance and love triangles and who loves whom. That stuff is great but I\u2019m just as keen on the world of the various G.o.d kingdoms and the conflicts between G.o.ds and demons and the general immersion into a world that is fascinating and surreal. The action picks up on the political front in this chapter and it\u2019s a pivotal moment for Zhuan Xu. Let\u2019s not forget that Xiao Yao has zero reason to return to her rightful position but for helping Zhuan Xu become the next Xuan Yuan Emperor. It\u2019s his destiny, their dead relatives blood and sacrifice rests on their shoulders, and neither will be safe unless he\u2019s the one calling the shots. When I look at adult Zhuan Xu it\u2019s hard for me to not remember the little boy he was in Once Promised. So bratty and as much a firebrand as Xiao Yao was equally bratty and a spitfire. They were like two peas in a pod that loved and loathed each other, and the sparks between them were so strong and amazing every reader thought any sequel would involve these two as the OTP. I do love Xiang Liu and Jing, but Xiao Yao has a special place in her heart that only Zhuan Xu resides in. Too bad she doesn\u2019t realize he tucks her away in his heart in a way more romantic light than she sees him as just an older brother. But love is love and these two have an unbreakable bond that is going to start getting truly tested. The mighty and fearless Yellow Emperor arrives in the Middle Plains with his own agenda and everyone else is just going to have to walk on eggsh.e.l.ls. This is good for our heartbroken Xiao Yao because the busier she is the less time she has to mope about Jing\u2019s failure to keep his promise to her and Xiang Liu\u2019s is-he-isn\u2019t-he waltzing in and out of her life.Chapter 27 \u2013 When Waves Ripple on Flat Ground:In the middle of Summer, the Yellow Emperor proclaimed that he was going to personally survey the Middle Plains.The last time the Yellow Emperor visited the Middle Plains was over two hundred years ago, and that trip was terribly eventful. The former Sheng Nong Mountain Head of the Palace Guards attempted to a.s.sa.s.sinate the Yellow Emperor and actually breached layers of protection to arrive right before the Yellow Emperor and almost succeeded in cutting him down. At the nick of time it was Sheng Nong\u2019s former General Hou Tu that saved the Yellow Emperor from the brink of death.After that the shadow of the sword struck down and blood flowed everywhere with many many people dying in the Middle Plains. Many people also died in the Xuan Yuan Court. The Yellow Emperor\u2019s sixth son Prince Xuan Yuan Xiu died in that aftermath while the eighth son Prince Xuan Yuan Qing was jailed. Just like that the once glorious Wan Lei family fell from grace. [The Yellow Emperor\u2019s sixth and eighth sons are born from his fourth Consort the daughter of the Wan Lei family]The first time the Yellow Emperor visited the Middle Plains was when he battled and defeated Sheng Nong\u2019s General Qi Yo and united the Middle Plains before leading his troops to ascend Sheng Nong Mountain to pray to the Heavens; the second time the Yellow Emperor visited the Middle Plains was when he was almost a.s.sa.s.sinated; now would be his third time visiting the Middle Plains and to the families and clans there, each time the Yellow Emperor visited the Middle Plains had resulted in blood flowing like a river so everyone believed this third time would likely be no different.Every clan and family strictly ordered all their members to be alert and vigilant and to avoid any untoward behavior.When Zhuan Xu told Xiao Yao that the Yellow Emperor was coming to the Middle Plains, she nervously stared back \u201cWhy is he coming to survey the Middle Plains? Does he know something? Or did our two uncles tip him off?\u201dZhuan Xu was very nervous inside but he smiled and rea.s.sured Xiao Yao \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen.\u201dXiao Yao smiled nervously, how could she not be scared? In her eyes, her dad was the kindest but he was also the Emperor who killed his own five younger brothers and then exterminated their whole families including wives and children. Hundreds of lives lost, not one was spared. On Xuan Yuan Mountain, her grandfather was also very kind but Xiao Yao knew clearly that he was even scarier than her dad! He was a man who started with nothing, leading a small G.o.d tribe growing from North fighting South to create a new Kingdom. He also defeated the ruler of the Middle Plains the Sheng Nong Kingdom and united the greater part of the vast wilderness!Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao by the shoulders \u201cXiao Yao, we\u2019ll be fine!\u201dXiao Yao gradually calmed down and her eyes showed her determination \u201cEven if something happens, we will make it fine!\u201dZhuan Xu also calmed down and nodded his head with a smile.Days later the Yellow Emperor arrived at Ban Quan where a heavy armed force was stationed there led by the Yellow Emperor\u2019s trusted General Li Yuan. He stayed there for three days and accepted an invitation by the Middle Plains Six Big Families to go see military drills.General Li Yuan was running the troops through the paces and the soldiers were not soft and slacking off despite the lack of war for the last hundreds of years. They still remained fierce and exuded the ferocity of vicious beasts.The elders of the Six Big Families watched the drills and felt their knees grow weak. When the Yellow Emperor asked for their opinion, they could only fearfully reply \u201cVery good.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled and bid them to leave. After the elders left, soon word spread all over the Middle Plains of the power and might of the Xuan Yuan army.After leaving Ban Quan, the Yellow Emperor surveyed all along the way and arrived at another critical spot in the Middle Plains Zhe Province. It was the spot closest to Zhi Jin Summit on Sheng Nong Mountain, on a winged ride it would take but half an hour to arrive.Zhuan Xu wanted to go welcome the Yellow Emperor at Zhe Province but the Yellow Emperor declined and told him to wait on Zhi Jin Summit.Zhe Province was also guarded by heavy forces and Zhuan Xu smiled as he said to Xiao Yao \u201cDo you think Grandfather will have the soldiers in Zhe Province run through their drills as well? Forget the Six Big Families, he might as well summon the tens of mid-sized families and hundreds of small families all to come watch!\u201d\u201cGrandfather won\u2019t do the same tactic twice, likely he has a different arrangement in mind.\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cYou\u2019re right, after scaring them with might, now he will try wooing them with warmth.\u201dIt was the time of flowers blooming so the Yellow Emperor had Prince Cang Lin arrange a Hundred Flower Banquet and invited all the major families to attend.Jing, Feng Long, Xing Yue all received invitations, and everyone rushed to attend the banquet. Zhuan Xu was purposely left on Zhi Jin Summit and if by now Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t understand that the Yellow Emperor was marginalizing him then he was an idiot.The Grand Emperor sensed something was afoot and exposed the Gao Xing spies in the Middle Plains and ordered them to swiftly bring Ah Nian and Xiao Yao back to Gao Xing, and to travel separately as a precaution.Ah Nian was confused to hear her dad was urgently wanting to see her but got on the winged ride and left with them. Xiao Yao said to her escorts \u201cI can\u2019t go see my dad right now, please tell him and he will understand why.\u201dThe people escorting her had no choice but to leave for Gao Xing.Xiao Yao calmly walked out of her residence and took out her bow to practice, with each arrow hitting the bulls eye. Zhuan Xu came to send Xiao Yao away and she drawled \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have confidence?\u201dZhuan Xu replied \u201cI do!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThen you don\u2019t need to send me away!\u201dZhuan Xu was angry \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to!\u201dXiao Yao grinned \u201cThen I\u2019m not leaving because you need my protection and support!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at her and pleaded \u201cXiao Yao, please leave!\u201dXiao Yao smiled but her eyes were iced cold \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019m not my Mom, I don\u2019t owe the Yellow Emperor a debt of grat.i.tude for raising me. If he dares harm us then I will harm him right back!\u201dZhuan Xu stared and said slowly \u201cFine, let\u2019s go together.\u201dXiao Yao sent an arrow whoos.h.i.+ng out and shattering the dragon head on a statue by the wall before coolly saying \u201cHe raised you for tens of years and if that day comes and you can\u2019t strike the killing blow, leave it to me.\u201dXiao Yao turned and went to her \u201ckitchen\u201d.Zhuan Xu clenched his fist, he didn\u2019t want that day to come and if it did come then he would never let Xiao Yao take any action!For successive days the Yellow Emperor held banquets in Zhe Province.Zhuan Xu continued renovating the Palace on Zhi Jin Summit and if he didn\u2019t have official duties them he would take Shu Hui to tour Sheng Nong Mountain and admire the flowers.In the middle of the month, an a.s.sa.s.sination attempt was made on the Yellow Emperor. Two a.s.sa.s.sins were killed on the spot and word quickly spread that both were quite far away from the Yellow Emperor unlike the last a.s.sa.s.sination attempt. This one looked like a kid\u2019s goofing off.But this matter was no less serious than last time because someone wanted the Yellow Emperor dead. The two a.s.sa.s.sins had tattoos that linked them to a family or organization so the Yellow Emperor ordered a swift and thorough investigation. All of the Middle Plains went silent as everyone tried to protect themselves.Zhuan Xu walked out into the courtyard where Xiao Yao was practicing archery and her arrow hit the dummy in the heart. He applauded and Xiao Yao asked \u201cDid they learn who was the mastermind behind the two a.s.sa.s.sins?\u201d Zhuan Xu answered \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone will find out.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI heard that the two a.s.sa.s.sins were tattooed using ink from the Ruo Mu tree sap.\u201d The Ruo Mu tree was one of the Three Great Trees of the G.o.d tribe, and it was the spiritual protector of the Ruo Sui Tribe. Zhuan Xu\u2019s mother was the former tribal leader of the Ruo Sui tribe and after she died the tribe never elected a new leader. From a certain perspective, Zhuan Xu ought to be considered the current tribal leader of the Ruo Sui tribe.Xiao Yao asked \u201cThe tattoo can determine when it was inked, did grandfather investigate?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled wanly \u201cBecause he investigated which is why I said the truth can\u2019t be discovered. The tattoos were determined to be no less than thirty years old.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cOur two uncles are so calculating to have long ago prepared these a.s.sa.s.sins. No matter who the a.s.sa.s.sination attempt was made on, they would pin it on you. With a tattoo inked on tens of years ago, no one would believe it was a set up. Who could believe that tens of years ago a.s.sa.s.sins would be prepped to frame you?\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cGrandfather has been very wary of the Middle Plains families and now I\u2019m getting closer and closer to them. Likely someone whispered to him and he\u2019s suspicious hence this survey trip here. But before the a.s.sa.s.sination attempt he was just warning me and didn\u2019t intend to punish me. But they were not happy enough with that and decided to make sure Grandfather would be pushed to kill me.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t put another arrow in but pulled back her bow and let go with a whoosh \u201cYou can\u2019t even try to explain your way out of this so what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cSee how things unfold and react then.\u201d\u201cGrandfather arrived quite forcefully and immediately cowed the Six Big Families into submission. Then he wined and dined the rest to show that as long as no one did anything, they could happily live on like this. Would those leaning towards you have changed their minds after Grandfather\u2019s scare and then woo tactic?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cVery possible! Grandfather\u2019s warning also included what he could give them, whereas I honestly have nothing concrete to offer and who knows when the day will come that I can give them something.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, allies turning is the scariest thing ever! She anxiously asked \u201cWhat about Feng Long? Will Feng Long change allegiances?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cHe likely won\u2019t, he wants things his grandfather won\u2019t give him and our uncles don\u2019t have the guts to give. The entire world only I can give him, but it\u2019s still impossible to ascertain a person\u2019s heart. Sometimes it\u2019s not him changing but the situation forcing him to. He is still not the Chi Sui clan leader yet so he can\u2019t decide many things and still needs to take direction from others.\u201d\u201cWhat about the Tan family?\u201d\u201cThey might want to but can\u2019t because I married their daughter. Even if they align with our uncles they won\u2019t trust the Tan family.\u201d That is why the clans and families all put great importance on marital connections.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhen are you going to marry Xing Yue?\u201dZhuan Xu scoffed \u201cDo you think I can marry her just because I want to? She will not marry me right now! In this entire world, other than you foolish girl, everyone else who helps me will first wait to see what I can give them.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly understood what Xing Yue did. She refused to get married but to help Zhuan Xu build his power base in the Middle Plains she pushed forth her Tan family cousin to marry him. This allowed Xing Yue to both attack and guard her position at the same time. If Zhuan Xu won, she would then vault to the top of the peak. If Zhuan Xu lost, she would still be the Sheng Nong tribe\u2019s princess without an official princess t.i.tle, still able to pick among the most eligible men to marry. Xing Yue did have feelings for Zhuan Xu but her feelings came with a price. Xing Yue was like a very savvy businessman, she knew exactly what Zhuan Xu could give her and what she needed to pay for it.In that moment Xiao Yao felt her heart jumbled and she put away her bow and grabbed Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand \u201cAre you upset?\u201dZhuan Xu looked perplexed \u201cWhy would I be upset? It\u2019s hard enough to survive for any person and romance isn\u2019t all there is in life. It can\u2019t be food when one is hungry, it can\u2019t be warmth when one is cold. A woman wants to follow me not just because of the care a man can give a woman, but because of what else they can get. Xing Yue may want a lot but she can also give a lot. It\u2019s the same as all other women, I can give them what they want, they can give me what I want. It\u2019s fair.\u201d\u201cAs long as you are okay with it then it\u2019s fine.\u201d Xiao Yao sighed, Zhuan Xu appeared to have a lot of women around him, but even with Ah Nian there was a price to be exchanged. They would never like a Zhuan Xu who came in whatever condition they saw him.Zhuan Xu pinched her cheek \u201cHey! What\u2019s with that expression? Don\u2019t look at me like I\u2019m an abandoned puppy no one wants. You\u2019re usually so free thinking, why all the contemplation now?\u201dXiao Yao glared at him \u201cAren\u2019t people like this? Easy to overlook things when it happens to others, hard to when it happens to oneself! I know life is like this but I still wish Xing Yue and them were nicer to you, just a bit nicer to you!\u201d Zhuan Xu guffawed and poked Xiao Yao\u2019s nose \u201cFine! But I really don\u2019t care so don\u2019t be mad on my behalf towards them!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSeeing as Xing Yue has decided to sit on the fence, that means Sheng Nong will definitely not help you.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cDon\u2019t think too far ahead. Right now what is most important is how Grandfather will react. They want to use an Emperor\u2019s mistrust to eliminate me which is a smart move! But Grandfather is not a fool either!\u201dA few days later, the Yellow Emperor summoned Zhuan Xu to Zhe Province to see him.Receiving the summons, the entire Zhi Jin Court turned deadly silent, with Xiao Xiao and the guards all stony-faced with a conviction like they were headed to their deaths.Jin Xuan collected information for Zhuan Xu so knew exactly what was happening with the Yellow Emperor and begged Zhuan Xu not to go to Zhe Province. The area was teaming with armed forces and if he went, then his life and death would be completely in the Yellow Emperor\u2019s hands. And right now the Yellow Emperor was suspecting that Zhuan Xu was the second Xuan Yuan Xiu.Shu Hui didn\u2019t completely know what was happening but she sensed this would be a dangerous trip but didn\u2019t interfere in Zhuan Xu\u2019s decision, only secretly crying until her face was all bloated.Zhuan Xu gathered up all his confidantes and said \u201cI\u2019m going to Zhe Province because if I don\u2019t go then I prove my uncles lies that I an planning to revolt to kill the Yellow Emperor and take his place. Then the Yellow Emperor will immediately attack Sheng Nong Mountain and he has the entire Xuan Yuan Kingdom backing him with endless supplies so we can only keep Sheng Nong Mountain from falling without the ability to fight back. When Sheng Nong Mountain falls, everyone who followed me will be killed. I don\u2019t want to die like that and I don\u2019t want any of you with so much talent to die like that. You are the wealth of the world so even if I die you all must still live.\u201dYu Jiang and them all knelt down and bowed their heads loudly on the floor to beg Zhuan Xu to reconsider through tears and pleading but Zhuan Xu\u2019s mind was made up.Xiao Xiao and the guards begged \u201cWe want to go with Your highness to Zhe Province.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cNo need, if my Grandfather wanted to kill me, you guys there won\u2019t make a difference and will instead cause a scene. You wait for me outside the castle.\u201dXiao Xiao\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed \u201cYes!\u201dStanding outside the court, Xiao Yao listened to all this and then walked in \u201cI want to go with you to Zhe Province.\u201dZhuan Xu was about to say something but she glared and mouthed \u201cDon\u2019t make me publicly counter you!\u201dZhuan Xu had no choice \u201cFine!\u201dXiao Yao followed Zhuan Xu to the cloud carriage but he blocked the door and wouldn\u2019t let her in \u201cXiao Yao, you really don\u2019t need to go with me. I dare go which means I have some faith I will come back.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSince you have faith then why can\u2019t I go? I haven\u2019t seen Grandfather in quite some time.\u201dZhuan Xu was so frustrated \u201cWhy are you acting dumb? If you go with me you can\u2019t do anything. You have low powers and if something happens you can\u2019t run away and will be a drag on me! Do you know that you constantly create trouble for me?\u201dXiao Yao pushed Zhuan Xu hard and slipped under his arm into the cloud carriage and said belligerently \u201cEven if I create trouble for you, I\u2019m still going!\u201dZhuan Xu glared so Xiao Yao acted pathetic and wheedled \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019m still the Gao Xing Princess, uncles won\u2019t dare do anything openly to me. If you kick me off this carriage I\u2019m still going to sneak to Zhe Province!\u201dZhuan Xu knew her personality and rather than have her sneak there it was better to keep her next to him.Zhuan Xu ordered the servant to depart, bringing only one guard on this trip to Zhe Province who was acting as the driver of this cloud carriage. His name was Ju Yi and he was the top warrior among the guards.Arriving in Zhe Province, the servants led them to see the Yellow Emperor.In the center court, the Yellow Emperor was with Cang Lin and he was sitting on the pallet while Cang Lin and three other officials sat lower than him.In forty some years the Yellow Emperor continued to age, he was now like a shriveled old wood giving off the clear signs that life was sapping out of him.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao walked up to kneel and bow to him. Xiao Yao was very calm and polite but Zhuan Xu was raised by the Yellow Emperor for tens of years so his feelings for him were different. Compared to Xiao Yao\u2019s polite coolness, it was immediately clear Zhuan Xu really cared about his well being.This clear contrast made Cang Lin furrow his brows while the Yellow Emperor looked quizzically at Zhuan Xu for a moment. He invited Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu to sit and Xiao Yao giggled before sitting down at a pallet close to Cang Lin leaving the corner area for Zhuan Xu to sit.The Yellow Emperor asked how the palace renovations were coming along and Zhuan Xu briefed him on all the courts that had been renovated and the remaining progress.Cang Lin scoffed \u201cYou\u2019re really into it, no wonder the Middle Plains families all like you. The Tan family even married their daughter to you. Have you started thinking of this place as home having lived on Sheng Nong Mountain for so long now?\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t answer as if he didn\u2019t even hear what Cang Lin said.The other three officials chimed in \u201cHis highness is getting too close with the Middle Plains families rather than being on guard towards them!\u201d\u201cXuan Yuan has so many smaller families with good daughters. His highness married his first consort\u00a0who\u00a0should be a daughter from the Xuan Yuan Kingdom established family.\u201d\u201cHis highness doing that really hurt our hearts.\u201dZhuan Xu continued sitting there saying nothing.The Yellow Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu and suddenly asked \u201cIf you were the Xuan Yuan Emperor, how would you treat the Middle Plains families and clans?\u201dEveryone\u2019s face changed and no one dared breath a sigh.Zhaun Xu immediate bowed his head \u201cYour grandson I would not presume.\u201d\u201cI asked you to answer so all you need to do is answer.\u201dZhuan Xu thought for a moment and then slowly said \u201cWhen the Heavens parted, the world was one family. The vast wilderness did not have Sheng Nong Kingdom, and did not have Xuan Yuan Kingdom. Then came the Great Emperor Pan Gu followed by Fu Yi and Nu Wa. Now there is the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor. Your grandson I think that if the Great Emperor Pan Gu along with Fu Yi and Nu Wa were still alive, they would first see all the people of Xuan Yuan and Sheng Nong as their citizens. Only by viewing the people of the Middle Plains as also our citizens, that is how one can truly be a ruler over them. Grandfather, why did you want to conquer the Middle Plains? Was it to be wary of them everyday afterwards? Your grandson I dare say that if you had the guts to conquer this land then you ought to have the guts to view them as your own people. If it belongs to you, then why so much guarding and wariness? What\u2019s the difference between Zhi Yi Castle and Xuan Yuan Castle? What is the difference between Sheng Nong Mountain and Xuan Yuan Mountain? It\u2019s merely just another castle and another mountain in an empire that all belongs to you!\u201dAs Zhuan Xu spoke, the Yellow Emperor gradually sat up straighter and straighter and stared at Zhuan Xu without any expression. The other four all knelt down on the ground leaving only Xiao Yao casually sitting there as if none of this had anything to do with her.In a bit, the Yellow Emperor looked at Cang Lin and asked \u201cIf you were the Xuan Yuan Emperor, how would you treat the Middle Plains clans and families?\u201dCang Lin was ecstatic and nervous and his voice shook \u201cYour son\u2026..I wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d\u201cAnswer!\u201dCang Lin immediately said \u201cThe Xuan Yuan Kingdom conquered the Middle Plains with the support of all the Xuan Yuan clans and families. Only those clans and families are truly loyal to the Xuan Yuan Emperor. They are fierce and loyal and as the Emperor I would favor them the most. As for the Middle Plains clans and families, I believe what dad you are doing now is the best approach, use them but not in critical capacities, be wary of them but not overly so. All the major army installations are placed throughout the Middle Plains while the Sheng Nong army has been disbanded and split into the Xuan Yuan troops. If the Middle Plains children want to rise in the Xuan Yuan army, they need to go through an added layer of review. If the Xuan Yuan Emperor want to preserve the strength and power of the Kingdom and keep the peace, he needs to rely on the Xuan Yuan elders along with a sword in one hand and a bottle of wine in the others when dealing with the Middle Plains.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said nothing and still had no expression but nodded his head. Cang Lin was so happy but kept his composure and bowed to the Yellow Emperor.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cEveryone get up!\u201dEveryone relaxed and returned to their seats. Cang Lin glanced at Zhuan Xu who was still the same, neither nervous nor worried. Cang Lin made up his mind and glanced at another official with a knowing look.That official got up \u201cYour majesty, the a.s.sa.s.sination attempt has no conclusion but the tattoo remains the only clue. Perhaps Prince Zhuan Xu can a.s.sist in a.n.a.lyzing with us.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cFine, tell Zhuan Xu all that is known about the a.s.sa.s.sins.\u201dThat official likely had earth powers so he used the earth to create two lifelike men and each one had a complicated tattoo on his left chest. The official pointed to the tattoo \u201cThe tattoo ink was made using the Ruo Mu sap and the doctors calculate it\u2019s been inked on for at least thirty years. The entire vast wilderness knows that the Ruo Mu wood is the patron wood spirit of the Ruo Sui tribe. Other than the Ruo Sui tribal leader permitting it, no one can get close to the Ruo Mu wood so how can one cut the branch off to get the sap? Can Your highness give us an explanation?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI don\u2019t know but in the last tens of years the Rui Sui tribal leader has not reported to me of any branch cutting incidents.\u201dThe official said to the Yellow Emperor \u201cIf I can be so bold, right now the most likely suspect is Prince Zhuan Xu. For Your majesty\u2019s safety, please order Prince Zhuan Xu incarcerated for now. if we determine the truth that he\u2019s not involved, he can be released.\u201dXiao Yao snarfled a laugh \u201cIf you can\u2019t determine the truth, will he be locked up forever like my Eighth Uncle, or killed like my Sixth Uncle?\u201dThe official was an elder at court and berated \u201cWe are discussing important matters. Will the Gao Xing Princess please be respectful and don\u2019t interrupt!\u201dXiao Yao coldly laughed \u201cFine. Years ago when Xuan Yuan was trapped by Qi Yo at the base of Xuan Yuan Castle, how come no one said that to my Mom? If you have such authority, where did it go then that you all asked my Mom to lead the army? Give my Mom back to me and I\u2019ll immediately shut up!\u201dThe old official was so infuriated his face was beet red but he really had nothing to say to that. He only kneeled down and wailed \u201cWill Your majesty please understand!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor coolly said \u201cYou\u2019re so old you\u2019re halfway in your grave, why get p.i.s.sy with a little girl?\u201dThe old official bowed his red face \u201cYes, I was wrong and disrespectful.\u201dCang Lin said to Xiao Yao \u201cSixth brother and Eighth brother both had ill intentions to kill Dad. His handling of their punishment was fair and just. Does Princess think he did wrong? Is Princess feeling bad for them, or feeling bad for Zhuan Xu?\u201dXiao Yao felt she spoke too rashly before and glanced apologetically at Zhuan Xu who said to Cang Lin \u201cUncle, are you trying to determine my guilt, or trying to determine Xiao Yao\u2019s wrongs?\u201dCang Lin stopped pressing Xiao Yao and turned to the Yellow Emperor \u201cDad\u2019s well being affects the entire security of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom. The attempted a.s.sa.s.sination is very important so will dDad please take it seriously and proceed.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor lowered his eyes to think and everyone stared nervously at him. Xiao Yao suddenly said \u201cGrandfather, I have something to say.\u201dCang Lin wanted to say something but the Yellow Emperor glanced at him and he immediately closed his mouth. The Yellow Emperor warmly said to Xiao Yao \u201cSay it.\u201dXiao Yao asked Cang Lin and the three officials \u201cDo you guys think Zhuan Xu is a smart person or a stupid person?\u201dCang Lin was silent and the three officials exchanged looks and saw the Yellow Emperor looking at them to answer so one official said \u201cHis highness is of course a smart person.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThe entire world knows of the relations.h.i.+p between the Ruo Sui clan and Zhuan Xu, using the Ruo Mu ink sap to tattoo is equivalent to writing \u201cZhuan Xu\u201d two words on their chest. You are all important officials in Xuan Yuan and likely all have secret guards to do your dirty jobs. Would you carve your name on the bodies of those guards?\u201dThe three officials were so furious they yelled \u201cPrincess cease with the nonsense!\u201dXiao Yao scoffed \u201cWhat do the people framing Zhuan Xu think? That he\u2019s an idiot? Using the Ruo Mu wood sap as tattoo ink just to make super duper clear the a.s.sa.s.sin was sent by Zhuan Xu? Fifth Uncle, would you carve \u201cCang Lin\u201d on the body of your own personal tasked guards? I can\u2019t see you doing something so utterly moronic, do you think Zhuan Xu who is smarter than you would do that?\u201dCang Lin was so infuriated he raged \u201cGao Xing Jiu Yao, you\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cBut the framer is also quite smart! He knows that as long as the Emperor\u2019s suspicions are aroused, that is enough. The tattoo is but a clue and there is likely much more evidence of coveting the throne. But how many princes are truly clean in that? If Grandfather investigated Uncle now, he will easily find tons of evidence that indicate Uncle wants the throne. But does that prove Uncle wants to revolt? Of course not! It just means Uncle wants that spot one day.\u201d Xiao Yao looked at the Yellow Emperor \u201cAs the sons and grandsons of the Xuan Yuan Emperor, is it wrong to want the throne one day?\u201dCang Lin said \u201cThat\u2019s true, but to kill\u2026..\u201dThe Yellow Emperor cut him off \u201cYou all leave.\u201dCang Lin tried to interject \u201cDad\u2026.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared at Cang Lin who immediately lowered his head \u201cYes!\u201d He left with the three officials.The Yellow Emperor asked Zhuan Xu \u201cDo you really want to kill me?\u201dZhuan Xu knelt down \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor coldly asked \u201cAre you just renovating palaces on Sheng Nong Mountain?\u201dZhuan Xu was sweating but he answered \u201cYour grandson remembers your teachings and is doing only what is within my purview.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu who knelt there without moving. Moments later the Yellow Emperor said \u201cI believe you weren\u2019t behind the a.s.sa.s.sination attempt this time. You can leave!\u201dZhuan Xu bowed three times and got up.Xiao Yao knelt down to bow her farewell \u201cThank you Grandfather.\u201d Her words were much more sincere now and her smile extra sweet.The Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cYou! If you were a boy, what kind of troubles you would be causing!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with my causing trouble? If I wanted to s.n.a.t.c.h power, I\u2019d still be aiming for my dad\u2019s throne.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cThe Sheng Nong Herb Manual is in your hands, right? How\u2019s your medical skills?\u201dXiao Yao figured he wanted her to check on his health so answered sincerely \u201cMy medical skills are not as good as my poison skills. But if Grandfather wants me to check on you, I will try my best.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed with a smiled \u201cIt requires courage to decide to have you treat me. I need to think about it some more.\u201d Xiao Yao made a face at him.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou can leave now!\u201dZhuan Xu and Xiao Yao stepped out of the residence and he sped up and whispered to her \u201cBe careful!\u201dXiao Yao understood now, it didn\u2019t matter whether the Yellow Emperor was going to let Zhuan Xu leave Zhe Province, Cang Lin has no plans to let Zhuan Xu return to Sheng Nong Mountain alive.Entering the cloud carriage, Zhuan Xu said \u201cFull speed out of Zhe Province and quickly rendezvous with Xiao Xiao.\u201dFour winged horses took flight when suddenly countless arrows flew towards the carriage. The driver guard Ju Yi\u2019s was very powerful so wasn\u2019t hit but two horses were struck and whined painfully which caused the other two horses to panic. The entire cloud carriage almost tipped over.\u201cAbandon the carriage!\u201d Zhuan Xu tucked Xiao Yao into his arms to protect her and leaped onto one of the uninjured winged horses while Ju Yi took the other one. The tethers were cut but tens of a.s.sa.s.sins encircled them.Xiao Yao tried to squirm out of Zhuan Xu\u2019s arms but he held her tightly and barked \u201cDon\u2019t move, it\u2019ll be safe once we leave Zhe Province!\u201dA silver bow appeared in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cYou guard, I\u2019ll attack!\u201d Zhuan Xu was stunned but Xiao Yao already pulled back her bow and sent an arrow striking one of the a.s.sa.s.sins in the chest.Zhuan Xu knew Xiao Yao was practicing archery but he didn\u2019t realize she was this good. He was so surprised and happy that he leaned down and kissed her on the head.Xiao Yao said \u201cI can only shoot three arrows.\u201d Zhuan Xu replied \u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201dThe a.s.sa.s.sins had formed a spiritual maze but with Xiao Yao there Zhuan Xu no longer needed to guard but could attack. He could see through the construct of the maze and said to Xiao Yao \u201cThe third guy on the left.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s arrow already flew out but the a.s.sa.s.sin was on guard already, but Xiao Yao\u2019s arrow was strange in that it turned before striking but her powers were still too low so it didn\u2019t hit a critical spot. But suddenly the man fell off his winged ride just like that and Yu Ji remembered that the Princess was adept at using poisons.The maze creator had been killed so the maze was broken leaving the remaining a.s.sa.s.sins attempting a close kill of Zhuan Xu so their winged rides zoomed closer.Xiao Yao looked around, with tens of a.s.sa.s.sins around them but they were nowhere close to leaving Zhe Province, with her low powers and Zhuan Xu\u2019s not being strong enough as well, that left only one Yu Ji to fight back and it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the a.s.sa.s.sins.Both remained calm and glanced around while Yu Ji managed to engage all the a.s.sa.s.sins at once. Zhuan Xu said \u201cSuch a ruckus but the Zhe Province castle guards have no reaction.\u201dXiao Yao gave a dastardly smile \u201cI have an idea but you need to help me.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cSame idea as mine.\u201dXiao Yao pulled her arrow back and aimed it back where they came from, the residence of the Yellow Emperor. Zhuan Xu waved his hand over the arrow and put a spell on it.Xiao Yao sent the arrow flying with all her might and as it reached the residence it turned into countless arrows falling like rain. It didn\u2019t hurt anyone but caused a huge thunderous sound. Due to the recent a.s.sa.s.sination attempt on the Yellow Emperor, all the guards were extra vigilant so someone immediately yelled \u201ca.s.sa.s.sination!\u201dLike a giant rock falling into the lake, swarms of the Yellow Emperor\u2019s guard rushed out of the residence.Cang Lin had bribed the Zhe Provincial castle warden to turn a blind eye to the a.s.sa.s.sination of Zhuan Xu, but he couldn\u2019t ignore an attempt on the Yellow Emperor. To save his own position and life, he tossed aside his task from Cang Lin and immediately sent all the castle guards out as well.Soldiers surrounded them on all sides and Zhuan Xu pointed at the original a.s.sa.s.sination group \u201cThey look suspicious, check them out.\u201dThe a.s.sa.s.sins could only watch as Zhuan Xu waltzed out of Zhe Province right before them.Leaving Zhe Province Castle, Xiao Xiao and team greeted them with smiles that showed a relief after a near brush with death. Zhuan Xu abandoned his winged rose and changed into a winged bird and said \u201cXiao Yao, thank you!\u201dXiao Yao raised her head and stared at him \u201cAm I your burden?\u201dZhuan Xu hugged her \u201cYou\u2019re not! I said that earlier\u2026..you know why. Actually there are times I wish you were my burden so that I can carry you on my back.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and purposely twisted his words \u201cPiggyback me? Sure, and you can do it later!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cFine, I\u2019ll piggyback you in a bit!\u201dXiao Yao asked Zhuan Xu \u201cThis solo trip to Zhe Province, how much certainty did you have that you would come out alive?\u201dZhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cThirty percent, but after I received a secret letter from Master, that doubled it to sixty percent. It was worth going.\u201d\u201cWhat did my dad say?\u201d\u201cHe told me the real reason our Eldest Uncle died. He wasn\u2019t really killed by Qi Yo. Years ago Grandfather wrongly suspected that Eldest Uncle wanted to kill him and usurp the throne so he set up Eldest Uncle to die in the battle with Qi Yo.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned.Zhuan Xu said \u201cMaster said Eldest Uncle was Grandfather\u2019s most beloved son that he trained to be his successor. He loved him the most and was most proud of him. But due to a moment\u2019s suspicion he lost his best son. Master said he sent word to General Ying Long to have him convince Grandfather to listen to my explanation first. Master said Eldest Uncle\u2019s death was always one of Grandfather\u2019s most unforgivable mistakes and he cautioned me not to be too rash.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cLooks like Grandfather summoned you to Zhe Province was to allow you to explain.\u201dZhuan Xu nodded.Xiao Yao said \u201cEscaping this calamity, but there is still the last question he asked you.\u201d Forming a private army might be as treasonous as an attempted a.s.sa.s.sination, it was death at the end no matter what.Zhuan Xu looked solemn \u201cThat is actually what I\u2019m really worried about. The other stuff only Cang Lin and his band of small minded idiots would keep obsessing over.\u201dArriving at Zhi Jin Summit, Zhuan Xu landed his winged ride on a path heading up to the palace.Zhuan Xu pulled Xiao Yao off and then knelt down \u201cGet on!\u201dXIao Yao was shocked \u201cYou really want to piggyback me?\u201d\u201cDid you think I was just placating you?\u201d Zhuan Xu turned around to look at her \u201cI said I will carry you on my back!\u201d Xiao Yao said \u201cOkay, I believe you, but we need to hurry back because everyone is waiting for you!\u201d\u201cWhat? You won\u2019t let me carry you? Who was the little thing that was too lazy to walk and always wanted me to carry her?\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Xiao Xiao and then and said \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of people laughing?\u201d\u201cWho would dare laugh at me? What I said counts on Zhi Jin Summit so get on!\u201d\u201cFine, if you\u2019re not scared when why do I need to be?\u201d Xiao Yao pulled her sleeves back and got on Zhuan Xu\u2019s back.Zhuan Xu piggybacked Xiao Yao and slowly climbed the stairs towards Zhi Jin Palace.Looking up at the palace, the phoenix trees planted outside the palace was even more vivid. In a few more years, it would bloom bright red flowers that would blanket the sky in its splendor.Xiao Yao sighed \u201cThe phoenix trees have grown.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIt has!\u201dXiao Yao tightly grabbed Zhuan Xu around the neck \u201cGege!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWe have to stay alive!\u201d\u201cWe will!\u201dZhuan Xu piggybacked Xiao Yao all the way until he entered Zhi Jin Palace and then he let her down. He said \u201cI need to go out tonight, do you want to come with me?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cJing will be there.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI have no relations.h.i.+p with him anymore and see him as your friend. Why avoid him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dIn the dark of the night, Zhuan Xu took Xiao Yao secretly to Sheng Nong Mountain\u2019s Dan River.Arriving at the secret meeting point, Xiao Xiao disappeared into the forest and Zhuan Xu tossed a jewel into the river. Soon a giant turtle floated to the surface and opened its mouth. Zhuan Xu pulled Xiao Yao behind him and jumped into its mouth. The turtle closed its mouth and descended into the water.Zhuan Xu led Xiao Yao into the depths and she realized that it wasn\u2019t a real turtle but a s.h.i.+p shaped like a turtle that had been sealed tight so that it could travel underwater.Walking through the turtle\u2019s neck and into the belly it became like a room in a house, with tables and pallets and chairs all arrayed. Jing and Feng Long were having tea.Xiao Yao knew Jing would be here so was prepared and acted normally with a smile for both guys. She really did see Jing as just Zhuan Xu\u2019s friend now. But Jing didn\u2019t know Xiao Yao would be here and his expression changed. Seeing Xiao Yao so candid and open with him as if it was all in the past now, it made him feel even more forlorn.Xiao Yao smiled and didn\u2019t react while the other two acted like they saw nothing.Feng Long smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cI heard Xing Yue say that your little sister didn\u2019t think too highly of our Chi Sui clan s.h.i.+ps in the past. How\u2019s this one?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cVery good, and discussing matters here is discreet and secure, no one can eavesdrop.\u201dFeng Long toasted Zhuan Xu \u201cMy apologies first, knowing you were headed alone to battle today and I couldn\u2019t do anything to help you.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cSome things I have to shoulder alone. Right now the situation is unclear and everyone avoids me at all costs. To have you and Jing ask to see me today is truly a friends.h.i.+p that can withstand tough times.\u201dFeng Long glanced at Jing \u201cI discussed with Jing that the current situation is bleak for you, but it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have a chance for success. Two of the Four Great Clans the Xi Ling and Gui Fang clans have tossed their support behind you. Tu Shan clan is behind you. When I become the Chi Sui clan leader, then I can guarantee the Chi Sui clan will support you. With the Four Great Clans and the Tan family who is the head of the Six Big Families, then the powerful denizens of the Middle Plains will almost all be choosing you. The critical matter is how you can use this dangerous juncture, and how I can quickly become the clan leader.\u201dFrom Feng Long\u2019s words Zhuan Xu learned one important news \u2013 Jing had chosen to support him as the Tu Shan clan leader. He was happy and shocked, having thought that Jing would stay neutral after he broke up with Xiao Yao. But Jing continued to support him secretly and now openly as clan leader would also support him. Clearly Feng Long spent a lot of time persuading Jing and Zhuan Xu felt like this was a much needed rain in a drought. He stood up and bowed to both guys \u201cEvery man for himself, but you guys\u2026\u2026\u2026I will never forget this debt of grat.i.tude. Thank you!\u201dJing stood up and returned the bow \u201cYour highness need not be so polite, the world is meant to be ruled by the strong and Feng Long and my choice is because you are worthy of our choice. So you should thank yourself.\u201dFeng Long scoffed \u201cZhuan Xu, the world doesn\u2019t have many like you, who can see the entire world as all part of your own family! I\u2019ve not seen a ruler like that! Everyone looks out for their own family, their own clan, their own tribe. The Four Great Clans appear so lofty and not involved but actually carefully guards their own territory and reach. Look at those Xuan Yuan elders, like b.u.t.t poor farmers who finally had a good harvest but afterwards guarding their haul anxiously afraid of anyone stealing it.\u201dXiao Yao chuckled \u201cYou managed to insult and deride every powerful group in the vast wilderness.\u201dFeng Long pouted \u201cd.a.m.n straight! It\u2019s so painful for me to have to play along with those old fogeys, but thankfully there is a weirdo like Zhuan Xu otherwise I would probably agonize to death already. In the end, I might even revolt! But we\u2019re no longer living in an age of heroes and grand battles, any revolt will only end in failure!\u201dZhuan Xu rapped the table to get back on track so Feng Long said \u201cToday we asked to see you is to tell you and Jing and I support you without reservation. Another is to have you make clear decisions now, not everyone will support you early based on potential and all will wait until you take decisive action to support you. Do you get it?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cMy grandfather asked me what I have been doing on Sheng Nong Mountain other than renovating palaces.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s face changed \u201cDoes he know anything?\u201dZhuan Xu shook his head \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what he knows that is why I\u2019m so anxious. Grandfather might be just testing me, or maybe he really knows something. Today it\u2019s very safe to talk so tell Jing everything!\u201dFeng Long said to Jing \u201cZhuan Xu has ama.s.sed a private army of twenty thousand hidden in the Sheng Nong Mountains.\u201dJing didn\u2019t look surprised and merely nodded his head. Feng Long shook his head, this dude really was totally dispa.s.sionate even if the world was collapsing.Feng Long said to Zhuan Xu \u201cNo matter if His majesty is testing or knows something, you need to decide what to do! Like I said, His majesty is in Zhe Province and it appears bad for you but can also be good, the key is how you handle it.\u201dZhuan Xu nodded \u201cI understand.\u201dZhuan Xu got up and bid farewell \u201cWe have to go back now.\u201dFeng Long glanced at Xiao Yao and seemed to want to say something but held back. The servants walked Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao out and the turtle opened its mouth and they jumped on sh.o.r.e. The turtle close its mouth and vanished in the water.Xiao Xiao appeared \u201cNo one was following on sh.o.r.e.\u201dZhuan Xu nodded \u201cBack to Zhi Jin Palace.\u201dZhuan Xu dropped Xiao Yao off at her residence and turned to leave but stopped \u201cHow does it feel to see Jing?\u201d\u201cYou have so much important matters to handle, why worry about my little stuff?\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cIs your heart really like your expression, everything is over and done with in the past now?\u201dXiao Yao was silent and softly said \u201cNo, when I see him looking so devastated it actually makes me a little bit happy. If he was like me, smiling and unaffected, then I would feel worse.\u201d Xiao Yao sighed \u201cI know it\u2019s all over and I want to forget him as soon as possible, and I can say we are just nothing to each other, but deep down inside I don\u2019t want him to forget me. I act like I don\u2019t care but I won\u2019t allow him not to care. If he doesn\u2019t care this soon then I\u2019ll hate him forever\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao shook her head \u201cAm I really sick to think this?\u201dZhuan Xu listened and then said \u201cYou\u2019re not sick, you just loved him for real.\u201d He smiled sadly \u201cXiao Yao, I really regret it now. If it wasn\u2019t for me wanting so badly to get the support of Tu Shan Jing, then none of this would have happened.\u201dXiao Yao walked up to him \u201cDid you forget? I saved him before you even showed up.\u201d\u201cBut you didn\u2019t love him then. I\u2019m the one who not only gave him the chance, I even created opportunities for him so that he could get closer to you step by step.\u201dIt really was due to Zhuan Xu that she and Jing got to this point today \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t for Zhuan Xu capturing her, she wouldn\u2019t have asked Jing for help, she would have just switched her face and disappeared one day. If Zhuan Xu hadn\u2019t locked them in the jail, Jing wouldn\u2019t have asked for a fifteen year promise. If Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t need Jing, she wouldn\u2019t have gone back to see Jing that day because she had already severed the ties\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao pushed Zhuan Xu out and said with a smile \u201cWhat happened between Jing and I, you merely created the opportunity, but I don\u2019t regret liking him so why do you need to feel bad? Don\u2019t worry, time will heal everything and I just need more time to forget him.\u201dZhuan Xu turned around \u201cXiao Yao\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao muttered \u201cSleep now! So many people\u2019s life and death hinges on you so you need to remain level leaded.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cFine! You rest as well.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t torment myself.\u201dXiao Yao closed the door and walked over to her pallet and laid down.She knew tonight that she wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep unless she took a sleeping aid. She swallowed a few pills and fell asleep.In her dream, she saw Jing with his son, but she couldn\u2019t see his son\u2019s face, only that he curled in his dad\u2019s arms and called him sweetly \u201cDaddy\u201d while Jing smiled back.Xiao Yao ran away as fast as she could and in a second she ran from Qing Qiu to Qing Shui Town. Xiao Yao jumped in the river and swam towards the vast blue ocean. She could see endless horizons and the joy of swimming freely, but she was so so tired! Where could she go in this entire world? Fang Feng Bei appeared on the surface and he sat on an all white clam sh.e.l.l smiling at her with his black hair flying in the breeze. Xiao Yao swam towards him but in a second his hair turned all white and he became Xiang Liu coldly staring at her. White clam sh.e.l.l, all white Xiang Liu, it was like an ice mountain floating on the ocean surface.The black hair him, the white hair him, closer and further away\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao suddenly turned and swam towards land, as she swam her tears tumbled down like rain\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao startled awake from her dream and felt coldness next to her. She touched her face and discovered that she was drenched in tears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s a girl who is so scared and scarred from childhood ident.i.ty and abandonment issues that her qualifications as a spouse is simply that he is never unfaithful to her. Granted\u00a0she does have three men who love her more than that, but timing and issues stymie each of them. Jing would have done that and given her so much more in terms of companions.h.i.+p and romance. If Xiang Liu could get off his \u201cI\u2019m going down in flames with the Sheng Nong resistance army self-sacrificing high horse\u201d he could give her everything Jing could and the pleasures of exploring the world together. Sadly a girl like Xiao Yao who deserves so much might end up settling for so little in terms of emotional fulfillment.Chapter 28 \u2013 Yard Full of Spring Air, Worry at the Corner Wall:The Yellow Emperor came to survey the Middle Plains and tradition required him to ascend Sheng Nong Mountain to pray to the Great Emperor Pan Gu, Fu Yi, Nu Wa, and the former Flame Emperors. Even two hundred years ago when he came and was almost a.s.sa.s.sinated, he still ascended Sheng Nong Mountain to hold a prayer ceremony before returning to Xuan Yuan Mountain. But this time he remained in Zhe Province and still hadn\u2019t ascended Sheng Nong Mountain.The Yellow Emperor staying for a day was yet another day the denizens of the Middle Plains lived in anxiety.The Yellow Emperor finally scheduled a day for the prayer ceremony and announced he was going up to Zhi Jin Summit on Sheng Nong Mountain. But he didn\u2019t hand the planning for this matter to Zhuan Xu who was on top of Sheng Nong Mountain and instead had Cang Lin handle it.Because of the answers given by Cang Lin and Zhuan Xu last time, Cang Lin was certain he was the next Emperor.One day Xiao Yao got Xing Yue\u2019s invitation to visit Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence.Since the Yellow Emperor came to the Middle Plains, Xing Yue never left home and never met with Zhuan Xu, so this time she proactively\u00a0extended an invitation was a clear sigh to\u00a0Xiao Yao that\u00a0she had to go.Xiao Yao arrived at the residence and Xing Yue brought her to a secret room where Feng Long was already inside.Xing Yue smiled \u201cI\u2019ll go prepare the snacks, Gege you chat with Xiao Yao first.\u201dXiao Yao was confused since she thought it was Xing Yue who wanted to talk to her, who knew it was Feng Long.After Xing Yue left, Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou mysteriously called me here to talk about what?\u201dFeng Long grabbed his head and blushed, stammering for a bit while Xiao Yao smiled at him. He poured a bowl of wine and downed it before saying \u201cXiao Yao, marry me!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yao was dumbstruck.Feng Long got the question out and could now talk freely \u201cWhat do you think of us getting married?\u201dXiao Yao felt her head spinning \u201cYou know Jing and I\u2026..you are Jing\u2019s best friend and good brother and you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s to mind? Everyone wants a good thing and I\u2019m just sad he got you first. But he doesn\u2019t have the fate to keep you and become your husband. I don\u2019t like to beat around the bush so before asking you I already told him that I wanted to marry you. I said that if you agreed to marry me, I will treasure you and hope he can end all lingering feelings for you. You will only be his best friend\u2019s wife from then now.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cHe said nothing but I can tell he\u2019s distraught. But if you agree then I believe he will give us his blessing.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and poured herself a bowl of wine to drink \u201cFeng Long, why do you want to marry me?\u201d\u201cYou are pretty, have a fun personality, and can drink with me.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThose three reasons you can find with a prost.i.tute at a brothel who does it all better than me.\u201dFeng Long laughed and shook his head \u201cYou\u2026..you really are something! Saying stuff like that!\u201d\u201cThen tell me your real reasons.\u201d\u201cThose reasons are real, but there are indeed additional reasons. Zhuan Xu needs my help now and if I want to help him I need to become clan leader. But the clan elders think I am immature and rebellious so they are forcing my grandfather to teach me for tens more years. If I want to be clan leader immediately, I need to have a reason for the clan elders not to oppose me anymore, and there can be no better reason than you.\u201d\u201cYou want to marry me solely to help my Gege?\u201dFeng Long sighed \u201cYou really want to strip all the skin off me layer by layer! Fine, I also need you. I need you now to help me become clan leader, I need you later to cement my alliance with Zhuan Xu. Alliances can be formed for various reasons but none are as strong as a marital bond. You are the only granddaughter of the Yellow Emperor and the Silk G.o.ddess Empress Lei Zhu as well as Zhuan Xu\u2019s only little sister cousin. If I marry you, it means so much more and you can figure the rest out yourself.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt can also mean more trouble. Years ago the Grand Madam didn\u2019t approve of me because she didn\u2019t like the trouble I brought. I remember you Four Great Clans have a rule not to get involved in politics.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cXiao Yao, do I look like someone who abides by clan rules? If you are afraid my grandfather will object, I can a.s.sure you that he\u2019s no Grand Madam. The Chi Sui clan is the head of the Four Great Clans and thousands of years ago Her highness Lei Zhu even borrowed soldiers from us! Without the Chi Sui clan\u2019s a.s.sistance, there might not be a Xuan Yuan Kingdom today! If I want to marry you, my grandfather will be ecstatic!\u201d\u201cDid you discuss terms with Zhuan Xu about marrying me?\u201d\u201cI did and he told me that if I wanted to marry you, I need to swear that you will be the only woman in my life. He asked me to think carefully about it.\u201d Feng Long pointed to himself \u201cYou\u2019ve known me for tens of years, you ought to have some idea of my personality. I\u2019m not all that interested in fun with the ladies and even if I play around it\u2019s when the occasion requires it. If I marry you, I don\u2019t mind my friends thinking I\u2019m a wuss who is scared of my wife and won\u2019t dare dawdle with other ladies. If you marry me, I will only have you in my life. I can\u2019t promise to be all that tender and considerate, but I will do my utmost to be good to you.\u201dXiao Yao finished her bowl of wine and sat there in silence saying nothing.Feng Long poured her another bowl \u201cI know I can\u2019t match up to Jing and you won\u2019t truly love me. But I really am most suited for you. We\u2019re equal in family background, as long as you are willing both families will be happy to give us their blessings. You\u2019re the best in terms of looks and personality but I\u2019m not all that bad either. At least standing beside it, we will only be envied and no one will think a glorious flower is stuck in a pile of manure.\u201dXiao Yao took a sip and spit out her wine in laughter. Feng Long took the bowl from her and handed her a handkerchief.Feng Long said \u201cTruthfully, even having these two reasons is hard enough in this world. There is no guarantee we won\u2019t face conflict ahead but at least we will always be on the same side. We will both forever support Zhuan Xu so we won\u2019t have the chance for a huge problem to arise between us. I know women want romance to be pure but sometimes you can think that all these unpure reasons are the invisible threads that bind us together tightly. It might even be stronger and tighter than pure romance. At least you know that I will never leave you! Because to betray you is to betray Zhuan Xu!\u201dXiao Yao took the wine bowl back \u201cNow I know why my Gege sends you to convince others to support him.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cIt\u2019s not the same, sometimes I bulls.h.i.+t with them, but everything I just said to you is the truth.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThis is so sudden and marriage is a once in a lifetime big decision. Let me think it over and I can\u2019t answer you right away.\u201dFeng Long was happy \u201cYou didn\u2019t reject me which means I still have a chance. Xiao Yao, I promise I will be really good to you!\u201dXiao Yao was a bit sheepish \u201cThis feels rather weird, when people discuss marriage the girl always shyly hides in the back. Yet we\u2019re talking openly like a business transaction.\u201dFeng Ling said \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re made for each other! Honestly, I used to really not want to get married. But marrying you makes me feel like no matter what happens, we can sit down and calmly discuss it. Now I think having a wife is pretty swell. Sometimes we can even drink together and talk.\u201dXiao Yao drank the wine and said nothing.Feng Long kept Xiao Yao company and nibbled on some snacks before saying \u201cI have matters to handle so need to be off first.\u201dXiao Yao was used to it \u201cNo worries, go take care of your things.\u201dFeng Long got up to leave but seemed reluctant to go, he turned back to stare in entreaty \u201cI really hope you agree.\u201dXiao Yao nodded her head \u201cI know, I will give you an answer soon.\u201dFeng Long tried hard to smile \u201cBut still no worries, we can still be friends regardless.\u201dAfter Feng Long left, Xing Yue invited Xiao Yao outside to have tea. The two sat on the pallet and Xing Yue brewed a cup of tea for Xiao Yao.Xing Yue asked \u201cHow is Zhuan Xu these days?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201ci can\u2019t say he\u2019s good but he appears the same as always. Sometimes after dinner he\u2019ll take Shu Hui for a walk around the caves.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cIf you really want to help Zhuan Xu, you need to marry my Gege.\u201dXiao Yao stifled her smile and said nothing. If Xing Yue really wanted to help Zhuan Xu, why didn\u2019t she marry him first?Xing Yue brewed the tea and said \u201cInitially with my Gege and I speaking for Zhuan Xu, we had already gotten the Six Big Families to agree to support him. But then the Cheng family and the Gong family had a conflict with Zhuan Xu over your attempted a.s.sa.s.sination. Other than Mu Fei, there was another man and woman, the woman was the fiancee of the Gong family eldest son and the man was the fiancee of the Cheng family daughter. My Gege and I tried to persuade Zhuan Xu to let those two live but he refused and killed them both thus leaving a feud with the Gong and Cheng families. The Gong son has tried in crazy ways to take vengeance plus there are many people in the Middle Plains harboring ill will towards Xuan Yuan. They don\u2019t dare kill the Yellow Emperor so instead turn their target to Zhuan Xu. It started getting more and more dangerous so we needed to subdue them all. That is why Zhuan Xu chose to marry the Tan family daughter.\u201dThe water boiled and Xing Yue placed the tea inside and then poured a cup for Xiao Yao \u201cEven though Zhuan Xu marrying the Tan daughter wasn\u2019t solely because of you, it still has some reason to do with you.\u201dXiao Yao accepted the tea \u201cI know how my Gege treats me so there is no need to convince me. I\u2019m also not the type to know that my Gege did something for me and I\u2019ll immediately go do something in return.\u201dXing Yue smiled \u201cI just thought you ought to know about this.\u201dXing Yue picked up her cup and stared at her tea \u201cOne time I was talking to my Mom and she said a woman would encounter two types of men in her life. One is like fire and the other is like water. When we are young we want fire to burn us up. But in the end most women choose to live a long time with water, calm and placid, forever flowing. My Gege is not your fire to ignite your heart, but he ought to be able to be your water, calmly accompanying you until you are both old.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cIs my Gege your fire or water?\u201dXing Yue replied \u201cXiao Yao, I\u2019m not like my mother. She was the only daughter of the Chi Sui clan leader, raised in care and protection and she had the luxury of falling in love based on her heart. As for me\u2026..I grew up in Xuan Yuan Castle like a n.o.ble but in the eyes of the Xuan Yuan n.o.bles I was the descendant of the losing tribe. I was but a hostage used to keep my dad and grandfather in line. Do you know what it feels like to be a hostage?\u201dXiao Yao stared and said nothing.Xing Yue smiled \u201cMy mom thought I knew nothing and used all sorts of excuses for why we couldn\u2019t live with my dad. But she never knew that the kids never kept secrets and they would repeat all the horrible things the adults said back to me. If the Yellow Emperor gave me an honor at a banquet, they would say afterwards that it was to keep my dad from rebelling. They said that if my dad rebelled, the Yellow Emperor would dice me into a thousand pieces. Do you know what being diced into a thousand pieces is like?\u201dXing Yue laughed and shook her head \u201cDo you know that for a period of time, I would pray for something before I fell asleep? I prayed my dad would never rebel because I didn\u2019t want to be diced into a thousand pieces and have my heart and guts scooped out.\u201dXing Yue\u2019s voice was hard and she lowered her head to drink her tea and Xiao Yao followed suit.After some time, Xing Yue lifted her head \u201cI know you think I\u2019m very calculating and sometimes even my Gege loses patience with me. But I can\u2019t be like Ah Nian. In Xuan Yuan Castle I already vowed that I would never live like that again. I will stand above all on the highest spot.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cXing Yue, you don\u2019t need to explain to me. This is between you and Zhuan Xu and he never blamed you.\u201d\u201cHe\u2026.he really said that?\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu was abandoned to Gao Xing to grow up for two hundred years. He knows it\u2019s hard to stay alive and now I know he was likely understanding your reasons and doesn\u2019t blame you one bit.\u201dXing Yue drank her tea and said \u201cNo matter what it was like growing up in Xuan Yuan Castle, on the surface I still need people to respect me because I am the descendant of the Sheng Nong tribe. I have my pride and if Zhuan Xu wants to marry me, he needs to give me the grandest wedding ceremony. It\u2019s not because I want it, it\u2019s because this is what the Xuan Yuan tribe needs to give to the Sheng Nong tribe. Xiao Yao, do you understand? I am not just me, I represent the entire Sheng Nong tribe. I represent a tribe that lost in battle, I represent all the families of the Middle Plains, to bring pride and honor to the losing side! You can marry in a simple ceremony and no one will say anything because you are backed by the ill.u.s.trious Gao Xing Kingdom so people will consider it your being carefree. But I can\u2019t, if I have a simple wedding ceremony the world will consider it tied to our defeat and shame.\u201dXiao Yao sincerely said \u201cI didn\u2019t understand before but I do now, and I\u2019m sure Zhuan Xu understands even more than me.\u201dXing Yue was a bit sheepish \u201cI was only trying to persuade you to marry my Gege, not sure how talk turned to me.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since we chatted like this, it\u2019s great!\u201dXing Yue said \u201cWhen you were with Jing gege, I always knew you guys would break up. I can understand how Yi Yang feels because we both desire something far above us. She will never let him go and you can\u2019t scheme over her. I tried hinting to you a few times but you appeared not to understand.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt\u2019s all in the past now, no need to bring it up.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cCompared to Jing gege, it\u2019s my Gege who is actually better suited for you.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cFeng Long said a lot and I will sincerely consider his proposal.\u201dXiao Yao looked at her empty cup and the waning light \u201cI need to get back.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201dAs they arrived at the cloud carriage Xing Yue added \u201cXiao Yao, everyone knows how close you are with Zhuan Xu. Your husband will have to also support him. My Gege\u2019s position is very unique, he is Little Zhu Rong\u2019s son but has the Chi Sui last name. If you marry him, you are the daughter-in-law of the Chi Sui clan, but you have to call Little Zhu Rong dad. If you and my Gege get married, I believe the Yellow Emperor will reconsider his choice of successor.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI will really consider it.\u201dXing Yue urged \u201cYou need to hurry, time is of the essence!\u201dXiao Yao carried the heavy pressure and boarded the cloud carriage. Returning to Zhi Jin Palace, Xiao Yao washed up and changed into a comfortable outfit and took a walk.She told Xing Yue that she would consider it but she actually already made up her mind. She just needed to convince herself that her decision was for herself.She arrived at a mulberry tree and remembered how she used to pick the leaves in the morning to bring it to the wooden hut to wash Jing\u2019s hair in the afternoon. The tree was still here but the person was long gone.Xiao Yao plucked two leaves and held it in her hand and silently continued on. She arrived at the edge of the cliff and could see in the distance Cao Ao Peak but it was covered in clouds.She remembered in the wooden hut and the nights she didn\u2019t want to waste sleeping so even if she yawned she still grabbed Jing to keep talking about whatever and it just made her happy.The wooden hut was likely still there but the person who kept her company to talk was now a father.Xiao Yao ripped the mulberry leaf in her hand into shreds and opened her hands to let it float away in the wind. The wind carried it into the air towards the clouds.There was still the scent lingering in her hands and Xiao Yao stared at her palm: With Feng Long she would never rise early to get mulberry leaves; they would never just wash each other\u2019s hair; she would never talk all night not wanting to waste the time on sleep because even if she wanted to talk Feng Long wouldn\u2019t be interested in listening; if something happened they would talk openly and calmly, and if nothing happened then Feng Long would likely not be home a lot so when he was home he would be tired and wanted to rest; likely she would never lose her temper with Feng Long and the two of them would treat each other respectfully.Actually it wasn\u2019t that bad, if she had a problem she could discuss it with him; most of the time she would have a lot of freedom to plant a herb garden in the residence and open her own medical clinic since Feng Long hated rules so wouldn\u2019t mind if his wife was a healer; when Feng Long came home they would have dinner and if he was out then she would eat alone.If they had a child then she would be busy since she vowed to make her child her most important person after being abandoned by her mom. She would do everything for that little one so that whenever the little thing thought of mom it would be the sweetest memory of how good of a mom she was.As the child grew up she and Feng Long would grow older.Xiao Yao smiled, it really was like what her grandfather said, to pick a suitable person to grow old with wasn\u2019t all that hard.The sound of familiar footsteps reached her and Zhuan Xu sat down \u201cWhat did Xing Yue say to you that you\u2019re hiding here alone thinking?\u201d\u201cShe explained why she couldn\u2019t marry you now and asked me to tell you so that you don\u2019t blame her. I told her you really didn\u2019t blame her and she said\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cNo need to explain, I already understand what she said.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, Zhuan Xu could understand because he didn\u2019t place hope and trust with Xing Yue hence he wasn\u2019t disappointed. Xing Yue didn\u2019t understand that she had lost the one chance she had to gain Zhuan Xu\u2019s genuine trust and she would never get another chance again. But perhaps Xing Yue didn\u2019t care, like she said, she wasn\u2019t her mother so she didn\u2019t care about romance.Zhuan Xu said \u201cXing Yue couldn\u2019t have called you just to explain that reason, what else did you guys talk about?\u201d\u201cI saw Feng Long.\u201d\u201cDid he ask you to pa.s.s word to me?\u201dXiao Yao smiled and shook her head \u201cHe wanted to talk to me.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s smile froze on his face and Xiao Yao said \u201cHe proposed to me.\u201dZhuan Xu silently stared at the rolling clouds in the distance and saw that it was covering Cao Ao Peak. No wonder Xiao Yao would be sitting here.Xiao Yao stared at Zhuan Xu but couldn\u2019t figure out what was on his mind \u201cGege, do you think I should marry Feng Long?\u201d\u201cDo you want to marry Feng Long?\u201d\u201cHe vowed to have only me as his woman for his entire life. And promised to be good to me. I\u2019ve known him for tens of years and know his personality. We can be friends and it can\u2019t be hard to be respectful married couple.\u201dZhuan Xu was still silent and said nothing and it wasn\u2019t impossible to read what he was thinking.Xiao Yao was perplexed \u201cGege, didn\u2019t you ask me to give him a chance in the past?\u201d\u201cGiving him a chance to pursue you and allowing you to marry him are two completely separate things.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to marry him?\u201dZhuan Xu nodded his head, and then shook his head.\u201cWhat are you thinking, Gege?\u201dZhuan Xu took a deep breath and smiled \u201cI\u2019m not thinking anything, this is just so sudden that I\u2019m a bit muddled.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m muddled, too. In the beginning I was ready to just reject him but he was so sincere and I listen to his persuasion and thought about it and realized he made a lot of sense.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cStuff complimenting me and tooting himself! He said I was pretty with a nice personality and he can drink and talk with me. He said he wasn\u2019t that bad either. Oh, and he said that we were well-matched and if we got married then everyone would bless us and things would work out.\u201d\u201cJust that? He didn\u2019t mention me?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cHe did but I don\u2019t remember what specifically. Just stuff like you are his good friend and would be happy to see me with him.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao who suddenly felt transparent but kept up the pretense and asked \u201cWhat are you trying to find out?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI don\u2019t want you to marry him because of me.\u201d\u201cNo way, of course I won\u2019t! Feng Long is most suited for me because of our backgrounds and our personalities. It all matches.\u201d\u201cDo you even care about that stuff? Do you want this yourself?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI really want you and dad to approve and bless me. Plus it\u2019s important that he said that I would be his only woman in his life and be good to me. Gege, in the vast wilderness can I even find another guy better suited for me?\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing and after a moment he laughed \u201cThere can\u2019t be another guy more suited. Later on he will be my right hand man and you will be even closer to me. It\u2019s easy for me to see you and if anything happened then I can take care of you. With me there, he can\u2019t dare not be good to you!\u201dZhuan Xu was sighing and laughing as if he figured something happy out \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a better suited guy than him!\u201dXiao Yao stood up and stared out at the cloud sea and took a deep breath. She finally made up her mind. She turned to face Zhuan Xu with her back to Cao Ao Peak \u201cGege, I agree to marry Feng Long!\u201dZhuan Xu nodded \u201cFine.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and grabbed his arm and headed back to Zhi Jin Court \u201cI will have someone send a letter to dad and he\u2019ll get it tomorrow morning.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to tell Feng Long. The Chi Sui clan leader needs to send someone immediately to Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dBack at Zhi Jin Court, Zhuan Xu told Xiao Xiao about this and had her inform Feng Long immediately. Xiao Yao watched Xiao Xiao leave and sighed \u201cI\u2019m getting married!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cYes, you\u2019re actually getting married!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI\u2019m going to write a letter to my dad so won\u2019t have dinner with you. Have the maids send dinner directly to my room.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled as he watched Xiao Yao\u2019s figure disappear in the corridor. Suddenly his fist slammed into the tree next to him and the entire huge tree split in half and collapsed. Jin Xuan witnessed this scene and used her power so the fallen tree slowly rested on the wall.Jin Xuan rushed over \u201cYour highness?\u201dZhuan Xu casually said \u201cI accidentally struck the tree. Clean it up.\u201d Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cI hope you immediately erase this incident in your mind.\u201dJin Xuan immediately knelt down \u201cYes.\u201dZhuan Xu left and after he was gone Jin Xuan stood up and stared at the split open tree and then glanced towards Xiao Yao\u2019s residence. She was a wood demon so quickly cleaned up the tree mess and even planted a same tree there. Without looking at it clearly it wasn\u2019t evident anything happened here.Feng Long figured Xiao Yao would likely agree but he didn\u2019t think that talking to Xiao Yao in the morning would bring Xiao Xiao that evening with the response that Xiao Yao agreed to marry him. If the person delivering the message wasn\u2019t Xiao Xiao, Feng Long would suspect it was a false message.Feng Long once again felt grateful that he picked the right person, Xiao Yao\u2019s fast decision making personality was as good as a guy.Feng Long removed the jade he always wore around his waist and said to Xiao Xiao \u201cThis isn\u2019t a very rare jade but I\u2019ve worn it since I was small. Please give it to the Princess and ask her to wait for me.\u201dXiao Xiao took over the jade \u201cI will convey this to her.\u201dFeng Long didn\u2019t have time to tell Xing Yue to the good news and immediately vaulted on his winged ride to rush home in the dead of night. He barged into his grandfather\u2019s room which caused the old man to jump off the pallet in worry \u201cWhat happened?\u201dFeng Long smiled \u201cSomething happened but it\u2019s not bad but good. Your grandson is going to give you a granddaughter-in-law.\u201dThe Chi Sui clan leader was stunned \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe Gao Xing Eldest Princess.\u201d\u201cWhat? You are marrying the granddaughter of the Yellow Emperor and Empress Lei Zhu who is also the disciple of the Royal Mother?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s her!\u201dThe Chi Sui clan leader murmured \u201cShe\u2019s the most eligible unmarried young woman in the entire vast wilderness. I can\u2019t believe she ended up in our family. You have quite the ability!\u201dFeng Long smiled \u201cBut there is a catch.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201dFeng Long said \u201cI want to be clan leader. I want to marry her as clan leader with all the pomp and circ.u.mstance.\u201dThe Chi Sui clan leader furrowed his brows \u201cDid she ask for that?\u201d\u201cOf course not! She\u2019s the Gao Xing Eldest Princess, the Grand Emperor treats her like a precious treasure and she can get anything she wants. Why does she need to play games with me? I want it. You don\u2019t want guests at the wedding discussing how I married my woman, do you? I want to give her the grandest wedding ceremony the Chi Sui clan can give her.\u201dThe Chi Sui clan leader stared \u201cDo you want to be clan leader, or you want to give her grand wedding?\u201dFeng Long smiled.The Chi Sui clan leader already wanted to hand the position to Feng Long but the clan elders opposed it. But under these circ.u.mstances, they ought not object anymore. The clan leader rapped Feng Long on the head \u201cYou like this heavy burden, you take it! I\u2019ve been wanting to enjoy a retirement. I know you have grand ambitions and one Chi Sui clan leader isn\u2019t enough for you. I don\u2019t object but you have to remember that you are responsible for what you do. You have to be responsible to the mom who bore you and to I who raised you.\u201dFeng Long knelt down and solemnly said \u201cGrandfather, you enjoy your retirement, your grandson I won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201dThe Chi Sui clan leader helped him up and sighed \u201cI\u2019m old and don\u2019t understand what you youngsters think and don\u2019t care. If I have the luck then I will be able to see my great-grandson.\u201dFeng Long hurried said \u201cHurry up\u00a0and summon all those old fogeys elders here to have an emergency session. And send someone to the Grand Emperor to officially ask for his daughter\u2019s hand. We need to quickly get this marriage settled so I can be clan leader.\u201dThe clan leader felt his head spinning with all of Feng Long\u2019s requests \u201cYou\u2026..fine! I\u2019ll have one last bout of crazy with you!\u201dThe Chi Sui clan leader had all the clan elders summoned in the middle of the night and each one rushed over within an hour and the entire group was a.s.sembled.The Chi Sui clan leader explained everything to the clan elders and one asked Feng Long \u201cAre you sure the Gao Xing Eldest Princess will agree to marry you? If she agrees, will the Grand Emperor agree?\u201dFeng Long impatiently retorted \u201cYou guys immediately send someone to ask the Grand Emperor and he will definitely agree.\u201dThe elders could hear Feng Long\u2019s confidence and that was the end of that topic. But another elder asked \u201cHer ident.i.ty is very unique, has the clan leader thought it through?\u201dThe clan leader said \u201cI\u2019ve thought it through, to rise is to take risk and with this granddaughter-in-law our Chi Sui clan will only rise!\u201dThe elders nodded their heads and accepted the Gao Xing Princess,The clan leader saw all the elders had agreed \u201cI want to send my third brother to Five G.o.ds Mountain to ask the Grand Emperor for his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. We need to get this settled immediately. Now that I\u2019m older, I want to rest and pa.s.s the clan leader position to Feng Long as well. Anyone have any objections?\u201dAll the elders looked at each other and grew silent. Even the elders who wanted to object knew that Feng Long was going to be clan leader eventually and now by objecting they would get on his bad side and offend the princess. If they agreed, they can curry favor with Feng Long and later on ask the princess for help and resume making weapons for their clan.All the elders spoke \u201cWe will abide by what the clan leader decides.\u201dThe clan leader smiled \u201cGood! I\u2019ve sent people to prepare the gifts and tomorrow third brother will make the journey to Five G.o.ds Mountain to propose marriage.\u201dChi Sui Yun Tian was an easy going fellow who loved good food and had a rotund face which now smiled \u201cThis is a good task and this trip isn\u2019t hard at all and I can even sample the Gao Xing royal kitchen\u2019s delights.\u201dAt dawn, Chi Sui Yun Tian took a convoy of gifts headed for Five G.o.ds Mountain.The Grand Emperor already read Xiao Yao\u2019s letter but spent the day as if nothing happened as he did all his official business as usual. But that night he held her letter and walked outside until late.Ah Heng, Ah Heng, are you willing to let Xiao Yao marry that boy from the Chi Sui clan?The moon was silent, the shadow was silent, only the wind cried softly.The Grand Emperor rarely thought about the past but he suddenly remembered so much of long ago \u2013 Qing Yang, Yun Zhe, Chang Yi\u2026..each of their faces flitted through his mind and they were each still handsome and beautiful and strapping\u00a0while he was a face full of weathered wrinkles and white hair.Father, Zhong Rong\u2026.he killed all of them but they still lived on. No matter how much time pa.s.sed, the Grand Emperor knew that his feet still stood in their pool of blood.There was a time when people would happily call him Shao Hao. There was a time when people would angrily call him Shao Hao. But now, whether happy or angry, there was no one left to call him Shao Hao even once. His only name remaining was the Grand Emperor who no longer felt happiness or anger.The Grand Emperor looked up at the sky full of stars and slowly closed his eyes.The following day Chi Sui Yun Tian arrived to ask the Grand Emperor for his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. The Grand Emperor smiled and agreed.Chi Sui Yun Tian sent a letter back to Chi Sui that the marriage was approved. Preparations were underway to send ma.s.sive marital gifts to the Gao Xing Princess while also preparing the clan leader initiation ceremony for Feng Long.Feng Long insisted on being clan leader before he officially had the engagement ceremony with the Gao Xing Princess and everyone understood why. No man wanted to think that he became clan leader because of his wife. Since it was already a done deal, no one wanted to offend the future clan leader and wife so no one objected.Not a lot of guests were invited due to the time and the Chi Sui clan leader held a similar ceremony to the one held by the Tu Shan clan for Jing\u2019s initiation. Only the Xuan Yuan, Gao Xing, and Sheng Nong three G.o.d tribes were invited along with the other three clans in the Four Great Clans, and the Middle Plains Six Great Families.The ceremony took place as Feng Long a.s.sumed the mantle of clan leader, followed a month later as the Grand Emperor and the new Chi Sui clan leader Chi Sui Feng Long announced his engagement to the Gao Xing Eldest Princess Gao Xing Jiu Yao.Soon the news spread through the vast wilderness and the entire world was abuzz. The Gao Xing Eldest Princess still lived in Zhi Jin Palace on Sheng Nong Mountain and was still as close as can be with Zhuan Xu. Her marriage to the Chi Sui clan leader indicated the Chi Sui clan would officially support Zhuan Xu. And Feng Long was also Little Zhu Rong\u2019s son so what did that mean for the Sheng Nong tribe?Feng Long and Xiao Yao\u2019s engagement attracted enough interest to cover over the Yellow Emperor going to Sheng Nong Mountain to pray to the Heavens. Even the people supporting Cang Lin decided to lay low and survey the situation first.Then the Tan family head held a banquet inviting Zhuan Xu, the Chi Sui clan leader Feng Long, the Tu Shan clan leader Jing, the son of the Xi Ling clan leader, and the messenger of the Gui Fan clan. The Tan family\u2019s relations.h.i.+p to Zhuan Xu was tied to marriage and the Xi Ling clan was clear in support while the Gui Fang clan dropped clear hints at Zhuan Xu\u2019s wedding. Their presence at the banquet was expected but to unexpectedly see both the Tu Shan and Chi Sui clan leaders there was a shocking but clear sign.The entire vast wilderness was on fire with talk \u2013 this was the first time since the dawn of time that the Four Great Clans united to openly support one Prince in vying for the throne.With the Four Great Clans and the Tan family leading the pack, days later the rest of the Middle Plains Six Big Families other than the Gong family all held a banquet to host Zhuan Xu and also in attendance was many of the other smaller families.Initially the Gong family head turned down attending but after hearing of how festive it was, he started to the get angsty. Then Feng Long asked for a secret meeting and told him about the Yellow Emperor\u2019s question to Cang Lin and Zhuan Xu that day about how each would treat the Middle Plains and then how each answered differently.Feng Long said \u201cIs your eldest son\u2019s vengeance more important or the future fate of the entire Middle Plains? Please think carefully.\u201dAfter Feng Long left, the Gong family head grabbed his second son and rushed to the banquet.That banquet lasted late into the night and soon word spread of that conversation between the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu and Cang Lin. The Sheng Nong tribe didn\u2019t appear but everyone knew that the head of the Middle Plains the Sheng Nong tribe had to have consented otherwise so much would not be openly taking place.Since the Yellow Emperor defeated Sheng Nong and united the Middle Plains, the families in the Middle Plains felt downtrodden and this was the first time they united as a form of defiance and entreaty to the Yellow Emperor to show their choice.The Yellow Emperor ascended Sheng Nong Mountain to prepare for the prayer ceremony. He was old and after a busy morning, he sent Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao away so he could take an afternoon nap.Inside a secret room, Zhuan Xu\u2019s followers were begging him to take this opportunity. Right now all of Zhi Jin Palace was teeming with the Yellow Emperor\u2019s own guards, but this was also the place Zhuan Xu spent the last tens of years developing his base. He had soldiers who knew this area and were deathly loyal to him and had already prepared secret pa.s.sageways. The Yellow Emperor\u2019s guards may be ferocious and loyal but they only knew Xuan Yuan Mountain well. The Xuan Yuan army was stationed right next to the mountain but if the strike was fast they wouldn\u2019t get here in time. Once Zhuan Xu became the next Emperor, the army would listen to him since the army was loyal to Xuan Yuan and not necessarily the Yellow Emperor.Zhuan Xu neither agreed with nor rejected the option, only telling his followers to be ready for anything.After a nap, the Yellow Emperor awoke refreshed and summoned Cang Lin and some officials to hear what was prepared for tomorrow. Seeing Cang Lin did well with the preparations, the Yellow Emperor was in a good mood and even complimented him that as long as he did what was within his purview, the rest will fall in line.Because of the Four Great Clans and the Middle Plains families recent activities, Cang Lin had been anxious but now he finally relaxed and walked out happy.The Yellow Emperor summoned Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao to see him and only chatted about random matters. Zhuan Xu was the way he always was, mature and thoughtful, whereas Xiao Yao was the one feeling fidgety.The Yellow Emperor teased her \u201cAre you missing that Chi Sui clan boy? You\u2019ll see him tomorrow.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cGrandfather, how is your health these days?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor replied \u201cThe entire vast wilderness wants to know the answer, they want to know how long this piece of creaky bones has to live.\u201dHe smiled at Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao \u201cHow long do you guys want me to live?\u201dZhuan Xu respectfully said \u201cYour grandson wants you to be healthy and witness your greatest dream come true.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor flashed a gleam in his eye \u201cNo matter what I announce tomorrow, you still want me to be healthy and live long?\u201dZhuan Xu calmly answered \u201cYes.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cAnd you?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me so you won\u2019t trust whatever I say. Do I even need to answer?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cIt\u2019s true I don\u2019t dare have you treat me. You guys leave! Tomorrow is a busy day so get some rest.\u201dXiao Yao walked out and mulled over what was said and her grandfather\u2019s words could be explained as wanting Cang Lin to be the next Emperor so he didn\u2019t want Xiao Yao to treat him. Or it could be he hadn\u2019t made up his mind yet.Xiao Yao whispered \u201cTomorrow, do you think grandfather will announce Cang Lin as the next Emperor?\u201d\u201cGrandfather\u2019s actions have been strange lately. No one can tell what he\u2019s going to do until the very last second.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cDo you have medicine to make people sleep around twelve hours?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Xiao Yao handed two pills to Zhuan Xu.He took them \u201cGo get some rest, I need you bright and energetic tomorrow!\u201dZhuan Xu saw Xiao Yao walk off and said in a low voice \u201cXiao Xiao.\u201dXiao Xiao walked out from the shadow and Zhuan Xu handed her the two pills \u201cGive this secretly to the Princess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Xiao immediately disappeared into the shadows again.Zhuan Xu thought that no matter what his grandfather decided there would be an outcome tomorrow. Xiao Yao, there is already so little your Gege can do for you, I don\u2019t want you to watch the blood of your relatives being spilled!That night, many eyes remained wide open unable to sleep.Zhuan Xu\u2019s followers remained kneeling as they begged Zhuan Xu to rebel tonight and don\u2019t let the Yellow Emperor announce tomorrow his decision. Once Cang Lin was announced as the next Emperor, Zhuan Xu would be in danger. The more supporters of Zhuan Xu there are, the more Cang Lin would want to eliminate Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu dismissed them but they wouldn\u2019t leave and both sides were at a stalemate. They knelt and Zhuan Xu sat there silently. They knew they were forcing Zhuan Xu but they didn\u2019t want him to miss this opportunity.When the rooster crowed Zhuan Xu appeared to snap out of it and stood up. Yu Jiang said in entreaty \u201cYour highness, this is the last chance!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI already decided, everyone is dismissed.\u201d\u201cYour highness\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu said to Xiao Xiao \u201ca.s.sist me to wash up and change into the prayer ceremony robes.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe secret guards left through the secret pa.s.sageways and remained perplexed. They didn\u2019t know why the usually decisive Zhuan Xu would let this prime chance pa.s.s him by.Zhuan Xu washed up and changed into the prayer robes with Xiao Xiao and Jin Xuan\u2019s a.s.sistance. After he was ready, he went to greet the Yellow Emperor but before leaving he asked Xiao Xiao \u201cHow is the Princess?\u201d\u201cMiao Pu gave her the pills and she\u2019s been sleeping soundly since.\u201d\u201cSend guards to watch over her and should anything happen, escort her out of the secret pa.s.sageway.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dZhuan Xu arrived at the Yellow Emperor\u2019s residence to find Cang Lin already there anxiously waiting. Zhuan Xu politely greeted him but got back a cold shoulder, Cang Lin wasn\u2019t even bothered to put up a pretense anymore.Inside the Yellow Emperor was being dressed in formal robes and then he walked out flanked by his guards. Cang Lin and Zhuan Xu walked up to flank him and greet him respectfully. Cang Lin nervously tried to curry favor worried that the Yellow Emperor would change his mind at the last minute. Zhuan Xu was calm as if today as just an ordinary day like any other day.Cang Lin and Zhuan Xu accompanied the Yellow Emperor to the prayer dais where the two sides were already filled with Xuan Yuan officials, the leaders of the clans and families, with the leaders of the Four Great Clans standing at the forefront.The auspicious hour arrived and with the cheers of the people the Yellow Emperor led the denizens of the Middle Plains and Xuan Yuan to pray to the Heavens and to their ancestors Pan Gu, Fu Yi, Nu Wa, and finally to the former Flame Emperors.It was already noon by the time the long ceremonial rites wrapped up.The Yellow Emperor stood on the dais and looked down at everyone below. He may be old and weathered but he still had the powerful presence\u00a0of his youth and no one below dared to think lightly of this wizened old man.The Yellow Emperor\u2019s old but still powerful voice boomed so loudly everyone could hear \u201cDid you all come today not just to pray but because you all heard I was planning to announce something important? What do you all think it is?\u201dNo one dared to answer.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou all heard I was going to announce the successor to the throne today?\u201dEveryone sucked in their breath to listen carefully so as to not miss a single word.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou all heard wrong \u2013 today I am not announcing who the successor is.\u201dThe collective mood dropped but then relief swelled since nothing scary and dramatic was also going to happen.Can Lin and Zhuan Xu stood right below the Yellow Emperor and Cang Lin stared in disappointment at the Yellow Emperor while Zhuan Xu remained placid and expressionless.The Yellow Emperor smiled and his eyes glanced over everyone and he said \u201cI will announce who will become the next Xuan Yuan Emperor today.\u201dThe crowd hadn\u2019t get gotten over the shock of hearing a successor wasn\u2019t going to announced so it took moments before the even more shocking announcement was processed. Everyone glanced around wondering if anyone misheard but saw the same dumbstruck expression all around confirming no one misheard.The Yellow Emperor appeared to enjoy the dramatic expressions appearing on the faces in the crowd and waited until everyone absorbed what he said and was gaping at him. He then said \u201cToday we are here to pray to Pan Gu, Fu Yi, Nu Wa, and the Flame Emperor. From the dawn of time there have been countless rulers and emperors. But why do only the four of them deserve to be remembered and revered by the world? I keep asking myself that question. I spent my life fighting to bring peace and happiness to countless people, but I also brought pain and suffering to countless people. On Cao Yun Court, I often think about how the world will remember me after I am dead. I want the world to someday think that the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor is also worthy of their remembrance and prayer. There is still much I want to do, many dreams I have yet to accomplish. I want the world to see that I have brought my people and my descendants peace and prosperity. I also want all the G.o.d tribes to live in equality and chose their own path in life. I want the Middle Plains people to be like the people of the Northwest and Southeast who love and respect me. I want the lowly people to have their kids have a chance to become great heroes. But I am gradually aging while the Xuan Yuan Kingdom is heading towards its pinnacle. It needs a new ruler, and this ruler needs to have vast ambition, sharp intelligence, boundless energy, and great capacity for compa.s.sion. Only with such a ruler can he lead the Xuan Yuan Kingdom to create its own history, build a brighter future. In this world people only know how to grab their own desires and very few know when to let go and let others take the stage. I am giving myself a good ending by giving another a good beginning. I have already nurtured the best next ruler for Xuan Yuan and now I have chosen to step down from the throne. I will let the new ruler accomplish the dreams that I still have yet to achieve.\u201dEveryone stared at the Yellow Emperor and everyone who was standing there hearing this speech was each standing at the peak of their own power. They understood more than any ordinary person what the Yellow Emperor meant. Sometimes letting go was the hardest yet the Yellow Emperor was letting go now. This man, in his prime he stunned the entire vast wilderness with his accomplishments, and now in his dotage he continued to stun all with his decisiveness.The Yellow Emperor stared tenderly at Zhuan Xu and said \u201cZhuan Xu, come here.\u201dCang Lin wanted to scream: Father, you\u2019re choosing wrong! But he discovered that he was wrapped in a powerful grip and could not make a sound. He could only stare in rage and despair as he watched Zhuan Xu slowly walk up to the Yellow Emperor and kneel down.The Yellow Emperor took off his crown and placed it securely on Zhuan Xu\u2019s head. Zhuan Xu raised his head to stare at the Yellow Emperor and there were tears in his eyes.The Yellow Emperor raised Zhuan Xu up and announced to the world \u201cFrom now on, Xuan Yuan Zhuan Xu is the Emperor of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom. Perhaps you all think I am too casual about this coronation which is not worthy of the ascendance of the ruler of a nation. But I want you all to remember that whether it was Fu Yi or Nu Wa or even the Flame Emperor, no one took the throne in a lavish ceremony. The world will not remember a ruler because how pompous the ceremony was, the will remember a ruler for what he did in his lifetime.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor walked off the dais and perhaps it was due to being so busy all morning so his steps were uneven. Two servants rushed to a.s.sist this all white-haired old man and he took their arms and walked through the two rows of guests.No one announced a bow and by now the Yellow Emperor had removed his crown, but as he pa.s.sed everyone knelt down and lowered their heads, willingly bowing to this weak old man.It was the first time all the men standing at the peak of their own power bowed to him not because of his greater power but because they so respected him.This man created one legendary feat after another. He broke the power stratus between the G.o.ds, the humans, and the demons. He told everyone that they were all equal. He shattered the belief that only royalty and n.o.bles had all the chances in life, he proved that even the most ordinary of men could achieve the impossible. It was only what one dared to achieve so that even the most ordinary of men could become a hero. And now, he was creating yet another legend before their eyes.You can hate this man, you can attack him and curse him, but even his enemies could not deny that his greatness was something they had to hold up.Until the Yellow Emperor completely vanished from sight did everyone stand back up. It was dead silent on and below the prayer altar.No one could believe that there wasn\u2019t a blood bath or interminable\u00a0wait and suddenly Zhuan Xu a.s.sumed the throne just like that?But Zhuan Xu was standing right before them and staring calming down at them.Was this young Emperor really like the Yellow Emperor said? Could he bring so much to lead a kingdom to greater heights and write its own glorious new pages in history?It wasn\u2019t clear who knelt down first but soon everyone was on their knees and chanting \u201cFelicitations to Your majesty!\u201dZhuan Xu waved his hand \u201cEveryone rise.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor heard the sound of cheers from behind him and smiled as he stared towards the distance ahead of him.Many years ago when the Xuan Yuan Kingdom was being established, he stood on a dais with Ah Lei and held a totally ramshackle coronation ceremony. His followers and buddies weren\u2019t the well raised and educated officials of today who could chant in unison. Back then the chants were all over the place and came in all sorts of random calls. One former bandit demon even said \u201cHope our King can lead us guys to grab more territory, and then lead us to grab some women to bear kids for us.\u201d Even the Yellow Emperor winced at such bawdy talk but Ah Lei didn\u2019t mind and merely laughed.The Yellow Emperor sighed. All his followers and buddies on and off the dais that day have long ago left. Many of those people, even when he joined them in death, they would not want to see him ever again. But today he can finally face them candidly and proudly tell them that the Xuan Yuan Kingdom they built together with their own hands had been handed to the most suitable person.Ah Lei, Ah Lei, he\u2019s our grandson! He\u2019s not only like me, he\u2019s also like you!Xiao Yao walked up to her grandfather and waved to the servants who all moved aside and she a.s.sisted him. He turned and smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cFrom tomorrow on help treat me, I want to live longer.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Xiao Yao smiled \u201cGrandfather, you really pulled a fast one today and toyed with the entire world.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor chuckled loudly \u201cSometimes being a ruler is very dull so one needs to create amus.e.m.e.nt.\u201dXiao Yao hesitated and then asked \u201cSince Grandfather has already decided to hand the throne to Zhuan Xu, why didn\u2019t you tell him. Why\u2026.aren\u2019t you worried Gege might\u2026..\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cAre you talking about the secret soldiers Zhuan Xu has stashed in Sheng Nong Mountain?\u201dEven knowing this old man was no longer the Emperor of the Kingdom, Xiao Yao still stiffened and stammered \u201cSo Grandfather was aware of everything.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor patted Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cNo matter what Zhuan Xu did he will be the next ruler and I will pa.s.s the throne to him. The result will be the same so the process doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned, her Grandfather didn\u2019t care that Zhuan Xu could have led an army to s.n.a.t.c.h the crown by force?The Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cIf he s.n.a.t.c.hed the crown by force, it means I raised him too well. He\u2019s too much like me, and would be a decisive ruler willing to pick up arms when necessary. But I\u2019m very happy because he\u2019s not only like me, he\u2019s also like your grandmother. He has a side that can kill, but also a side that is compa.s.sionate. I hope with both sides he can bring greater peace to the world.\u201dXiao Yao felt like this Yellow Emperor was different than the Yellow Emperor in her memory, and she liked this one more.The Yellow Emperor asked \u201cWhere did you go during the ceremony? I didn\u2019t see you and thought Zhuan Xu had you stashed somewhere safe.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cGege really was raised by you! He tried but who am I? He\u2019s the grandchild of the Yellow Emperor and Empress Lei Zhu but so am I! I merely used that to let him focus on his task and not worry about me.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor shook his head with a smile \u201cAnd what were you planning to do?\u201d\u201cI hid, and I\u2026\u2026I decided that if you were to announce Uncle Cang Lin as the next Emperor, I would immediately a.s.sa.s.sinate Uncle Cang Lin.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cYou really are my blood!\u201dXiao Yao made a face at him.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cCang Lin, Yu Yang, your cousins, they are not bad people merely standing at different at odds positions. Now that the fight for the throne is at an end, I hope you can face them with a different att.i.tude.\u201d\u201cAs long as they don\u2019t harm Zhuan Xu, I will treat them well.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cThank G.o.d Zhuan Xu has greater capacity than you and can accept them all.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, where are you going to live now? Back to Xuan Yuan Mountain?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go back to Xuan Yuan Mountain. Zhuan Xu just a.s.sumed the throne and the Middle Plains people will clamor for his attention leaving the people of the North and West feeling slighted. If I go back now, it will appear there are two rulers in the Kingdom. I decided to abdicate then I\u2019m stepping down completely! There is no need to cause misunderstanding and leave Zhuan Xu\u2019s followers nervous. I will remain in Sheng Nong Mountain and wait until Zhuan Xu brings all the tribes and clans in line before considering whether to go back to Xuan Yuan.\u201d\u201cThe people of Xuan Yuan all follow Grandfather, you can bring them in line with one word!\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu has the ability to bring the Middle Plains to support him and he can bring those other clans to support him. He\u2019s still the grandson of Ah Lei and myself. As long as those people don\u2019t betray Xuan Yuan then they will never betray Zhuan Xu. But they will be resentful and will often be angry at Zhuan Xu and find ways to thwart him. It\u2019s like having two kids in the family and both will be jealous of the other.\u201dXiao Yao nodded and the Yellow Emperor continued \u201cIf Zhuan Xu knows what they are feeling then he will use this opportunity to transform their anger into acceptance. Then he will truly show that he is worthy of the praise I gave him today. Whether it\u2019s Xuan Yuan or Sheng Nong, it\u2019s now all his people. He cannot play favorites and must treat them as equals. He cannot favor the Middle Plains people because they helped him.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI have faith in Gege.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cLet\u2019s stay on Sheng Nong Mountain and slowly watch him become a good ruler!\u201dZhuan Xu finished all his tasks and hurried back to Zhi Jin Court to see the Yellow Emperor. The servant announced him but Xiao Yao walked out \u201cGrandfather is sleeping now.\u201dZhuan Xu stared \u201cYou\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao rolled her eyes \u201cI what? If I got drugged by my own pills then that would be the joke of the century.\u201dZhuan Xu and Xiao Yao walked out of the Yellow Emperor\u2019s residence and towards his residence. Xiao Yao said \u201cRight, Grandfather wants you to move to the former residence of the Flame Emperor Qian An Court.\u201dZhuan Xu thought about it \u201cThat makes sense.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cCongratulations.\u201dZhuan Xu replied \u201cSame back.\u201dXiao Yao asked in a low voice \u201cWhy wait? What if Grandfather chose Cang Lin today, wouldn\u2019t you regret it?\u201dZhuan Xu \u201cEvery choice is a gamble and I can only say I gambled correctly. As for the rest, it\u2019s now all been decided so no need to discuss.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cGrandfather won\u2019t be going back to Xuan Yuan yet so from tomorrow on I will help him fix his health.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou take good care of Grandfather.\u201d\u201cYu Yang, Cui Liang and them are all still on Xuan Yuan Mountain. What if they try something?\u201d\u201cBefore Grandfather came he already had everything prepared. General Yin Long is guarding Xuan Yuan Castle and likely this morning Grandfather sent word back telling Yin Long he was abdicating so Yin Long will make sure those guys don\u2019t try anything. This time Grandfather coming to the Middle Plains he brought a lot of generals, on the surface he\u2019s cowing the Middle Plains but now he\u2019s also showing the leaders of the army that they are not loyal to the Emperor but need to be loyal to the Xuan Yuan Kingdom.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Xiao Yao fully relaxed.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao entered the court to find everyone waiting for them, Xiao Xiao, Jin Xuan, Yu Jiang\u2026..they all knelt and exclaimed \u201cFelicitations to Your majesty!\u201dZhuan Xu bade them to rise \u201cThank you all for walking this far with me. The future will be tough and I still need everyone\u2019s support.\u201dEveryone smiled and nodded their heads. Yu Jiang said \u201cThe future path will be tough but the path before today was the most pressure-filled and darkest path of all.\u201dThe maids poured wine for everyone and Zhuan Xu toasted and drank with his subordinates. Yu Jiang knew Zhuan Xu had a lot to do so took his leave and everyone else followed suit.Zhuan Xu watched them leave and said to Xiao Yao \u201cI invited Feng Long and them here. You come drink with us so that Feng Long won\u2019t complain.\u201dXiao Xiao and Jin Xuan smiled \u201cSince getting engaged, the Princess hasn\u2019t seen the Chi Sui clan leader yet right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to change.\u201d Xiao Yao smiled as she ran off.With Xiao Xiao and Jin Xuan\u2019s a.s.sistance, Zhuan Xu changed into an everyday outfit after was.h.i.+ng up. After he was ready, the servant came to announce that Feng Long and others were here. He sent someone to summon Xiao Yao.Zhuan Xu brought Xiao Yao to the inner court where five people were already sitting at their seats. From the left there was the Chi Sui clan leader Feng Long, next to him was Xing Yue, on the right was the Tu Shan clan leader Jing, next to him was Xi Ling Chun, and beside Chun was the older brother of Shu Hui Tan Shu Tong.Everyone stood up when Zhuan Xu arrived. He walked towards them and sat down at the top center seat and automatically gestured for Xiao Yao to sit beside him.It was fine sitting with Zhuan Xu at the same seat before but now was not like before. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to sit at the same level as Zhuan Xu in front of others and said to the servant \u201cAdd another seat next to Xing Yue.\u201dNo one said anything but Xing Yue laughed \u201cWhy bother? You should just sit next to my\u00a0Gege.\u201dEveryone smiled at Feng Long and Xiao Yao except for Jing and Zhuan Xu, both of them stared down at the wine cup before them.Xiao Yao lowered her head and said nothing. Feng Long glanced at Xing Yue who didn\u2019t continue to tease Xiao Yao.After Xiao Yao sat down, Feng Long coughed lightly and adopted a very formal att.i.tude and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cThe messenger from the Gui Fang clan has left, they are a very mysterious clan so never really get involved in what happens in the vast wilderness. So you\u2026\u2026shouldn\u2019t mind.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cWhy would I mind. They have helped me greatly plus I know how they work.\u201dZhuan Xu stood up and raised his cup \u201cI\u2019ll dispense with the unnecessary talk \u2013 Thank you all!\u201d Zhuan Xu downed his wine and bowed to everyoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter has an incredible scene involving Xiao Yao, Xiang Liu, and Jing. We need more scenes like this. I felt like Once Promised\u00a0was always about the big picture in both novel construct and story perspective. The battles between the three G.o.dly kingdoms, the grand and epic love between Xiao Yao\u2019s parents, all the various princes and princesses struggling between duty and individual desires, the world was seen from the top down in its expansive glory. But Lost You Forever started from the bottom up even in the very first chapter, tossing the reader into the mundane daily life of a little healer in a random town. There was no glorious ambition or blood feuds, there was only one person trying to live a peaceful existence in a very unpredictable world. I should have expected LSF to end the battle for the Xuan Yuan crown this early as it abruptly and logically happened in the last episode, with the Yellow Emperor abdicating for his talented and capable grandson which he always intended to do.When Xiao Yao\u2019s mother agreed to lead the Xuan Yuan army into battle towards the end of OP, she raged to her father that she was doing this for the people of Xuan Yuan and also for her dead brothers so that her nephew Zhuan Xu would one day rule wisely over the kingdom. The Yellow Emperor solemnly swore\u00a0to her that he would\u00a0pa.s.s the throne to Zhuan Xu, except Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t know that so he continued to plot and plan to win it. But the\u00a0Yellow Emperor wanted Zhuan Xu to do all that as a test of his ability, wisdom, and foresight and Zhuan Xu pa.s.sed with flying colors. LYF was never about winning battles, it\u2019s about what happens afterwards and how an Emperor can rule with compa.s.sion and make the hard decisions so the ball is in Zhuan Xu\u2019s court. What will Xiao Yao do now that the one thing she\u2019s been using to keep her mind off Jing is taken care of? Will she also find her own path in life outside of which guy she loves and which guy loves her? I sure hope so, one of the things I miss the most about her character is the could-care-less Wen Xiao Liu who munched on duck necks and lived a lazy carefree existence.Chapter 29 \u2013 Misty Fog and Water, Longing Impossible to Forget:The battle for the Xuan Yuan throne succession ended abruptly with the Yellow Emperor abdicating and Zhuan Xu ascending the throne. Even if Cang Lin and Yu Yang were angry, the situation was settled and there were\u00a0no big waves to come and Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t care about any lingering small\u00a0ripples.The Grand Emperor saw that the situation was settled and finally released Ah Nian from locking her up in her room. Ah Nian immediately stormed to Sheng Nong Mountain and the Grand Emperor chuckled that a grown daughter really couldn\u2019t be kept at home.Ah Nian wasn\u2019t just angry at her dad, she was also angry at Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao. She felt they all underestimated her. When the danger came right to their front door, Xiao Yao stayed beside Zhuan Xu while she was locked up safely away? Was she someone who was afraid of death and danger?But when she arrived at Sheng Nong Mountain ready to throw a fit with Zhuan Xu, the moment she saw him and realized that she almost could never have seen him again, all her anger went away and she hugged him while bawling until she couldn\u2019t breathe. After Zhuan Xu calmed her down, she was no longer angry at him and instead felt happy and content, wanting only to be with him every minute from then on. But Zhuan Xu was now the Emperor and even if he coddled her there was only so much time he could spend with her so Ah Nian didn\u2019t want to waste that precious time on being angry with him. Therefore she turned all her anger on Xiao Yao, refusing to talk with her and ignoring her. Xiao Yao merely smiled happily and let Ah Nian act out with her.The Yellow Emperor settled in Zhi Jin Summit and chose the most remote court. He rarely left his residence and never inquired into national affairs. Every day was spent on his health and well being, reading medical books and faithfully following Xiao Yao\u2019s recommendations on taking care of himself. Shu Hui and Jin Xuan and them were all scared of the Yellow Emperor so did their best to avoid him. Ah Nian was the only one not scared of the Yellow Emperor and went to see him everyday sweetly calling \u201cGrandfather, Grandfather\u201d and acting like his real granddaughter even more than Xiao Yao.Perhaps due to Xiao Yao and Ah Nian spending every afternoon with the Yellow Emperor, with one in a daze and the other chatting or playing chess with the Yellow Emperor, Zhuan Xu would always come by around that time. There were no formalities and awkwardness in the room as laughter would ring out.The Yellow Emperor was very casual as if he didn\u2019t care whether Xiao Yao or Zhuan Xu came to visit, but one time after Ah Nian walked Zhuan Xu out, the Yellow Emperor stared at Xiao Yao and said \u201cMany years ago when your grandmother was still alive, one evening I snuck through the secret pa.s.sageway to Cao Yun Court and saw you swinging under the phoenix tree\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao turned to look at him oddly and the sadness in his eyes almost made her cringe as he continued \u201cI hid outside the window and watched you guys surrounding Ah Lei and taking good care of her. I thought at that moment that even if I would own the entire world one day, I was destined to die alone. Who could have imagined that the day would come that I would have grandchildren by my side.\u201dIf the Yellow Emperor continued to hold onto power, then he would likely really have died alone surrounded by power. Xiao Yao said \u201cEven though you gave up power to make your dreams come true, but you also made Zhuan Xu\u2019s dream come true.\u201d\u201cWhen I was young and brash, it was all about never budging for what was important. Only afterwards did I realize I was wrong but it was too late.\u201d The Yellow Emperor looked at Xiao Yao and said very solemnly \u201cXiao Yao, you need to remember that sometimes taking a step back does not equal losing.\u201dXiao Yao sprawled on the window sill and said nothing.Zhuan Xu was taking another consort again, this time the only daughter of the Wan Lei family.The Wan Lei family was one of the prominent families of the North and the Yellow Emperor himself married a Wan Lei daughter as his second consort with a position just below Empress Lei Zhu. The Wan Lei Consort gave birth to two princes \u2013 Sixth Prince Xiu and Eighth Prince Qing. But now one Prince was dead and the other imprisoned forever and the Wan Lei family\u2019s star had fallen. The Yellow Emperor ignored the Wan Lei family and Cang Lin hated them for supporting Sixth Prince Xiu in the battle for the throne with Cang Lin. All these years Cang Lin and Yu Yang constantly found ways to denigrate them and make their life miserable.Everyone thought that Zhuan Xu\u2019s next wife coming from one of the Northern prominent families would at least be a powerful family so it was a shock to see him pick the thoroughly beaten up and down on its luck Wan Lei family.The Wan Lei family finally got a chance to rebuild its prominence and was very grateful to Zhuan Xu. Not to mention the family hated Cang Lin and Yu Yang hence the family threw its full and unreserved support behind Zhuan Xu.The Wan Lei family followed the Yellow Emperor from the inception of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom and thus quickly regained it\u2019s prominence as one of the most powerful clans of the North.Xiao Yao and Ah Nian heard about Zhuan Xu taking a consort from the Wan Lei family while they were in the Yellow Emperor\u2019s residence. Xiao Yao was leaning on a fan listlessly while Ah Nian was learning Go from the Yellow Emperor. Ah Nian\u2019s chatter rang out from time to time while the Summer sun shone through the melon awning on the tiles below creating a light and dark contrast making this leisurely afternoon seem even more quiet and long.Zhuan Xu walked in and stood behind Ah Nian for a bit to watch before walking over to Xiao Yao and taking the fan to fan her. Xiao Yao asked in a low voice \u201cHow come you have time today?\u201dZhuan Xu squinted his eyes as he stared at the sun s.h.i.+ning through the awning outside and said nothing.Ah Nian quickly finished the match and asked \u201cGege, you\u2019re not busy today?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cI came to tell Grandfather a matter.\u201d Even though the Yellow Emperor was no longer involved in national affairs, Zhuan Xu would still use a casual chat to tell him important matters that was happening.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me those things now.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI need to tell Grandfather this particular matter. I am planning to take the Wan Lei family daughter as my consort.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled and congratulated him \u201cGood choice.\u201dXiao Yao looked at Ah Nian but because this was now the second time and also because Zhuan Xu was now the Xuan Yuan Emperor, Ah Nian didn\u2019t have any big reaction other than a brief pa.s.sing of sadness.Zhuan Xu said \u201cYour grandson I need to thank Grandfather for leaving the Wan Lei family for my use now.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said casually \u201cIt\u2019s good you understood what I intended, but now you are the Xuan Yuan Emperor so who you want to use or not use is up to you and there is no need to consider me.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dZhuan Xu took his leave and as he was handing the fan back to Xiao Yao he whispered \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026..do you understand?\u201dDon\u2019t congratulate me \u2013 Xiao Yao still vividly remembered what Zhuan Xu asked her when he was marrying Shu Hui. She nodded \u201cI understand.\u201dZhuan Xu walked out with Ah Nian staring at his departing form with longing in her eyes.The Yellow Emperor gestured to Ah Nian indicating that she could run after Zhuan Xu so she took off with her face all red. The Yellow Emperor smiled and watched Ah Nian slip on her wooden sandals and quickly darted after Zhuan Xu. The sound of the wood clicking on the tiles reverberated down the corridor leaving the impression of a maiden chasing after her lover and imbued the entire court with a sense of youth.Xiao Yao wanted to smile but also wanted to sigh. She said to the Yellow Emperor \u201cYou want Ah Nian to marry Zhuan Xu?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cAh Nian is a very good girl, innocent and impetuous, candid and open-hearted, she doesn\u2019t have all those schemes that the other girls have.\u201dXiao Yao stared out the window and felt that she was so old and jaded\u00a0compared to Ah Nian.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou leave, too! Don\u2019t spend the entire day in the court with an old fogey like me. With Zhuan Xu and me here, you should learn from Ah Nian and be more impetuous and do what you want.\u201dXiao Yao casually said \u201cIt\u2019s because you and Zhuan Xu are here that I don\u2019t dare be impetuous and do what I want. My bloodline has destined me to be tied down so why even bother? If I said right now that I\u2019m going to find Xiang Liu to play with, will you agree?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor grew silent and seemed very concerned \u201cI won\u2019t agree. Zhuan Xu and he are destined to battle to the death one day. I don\u2019t want you to be devastated when that day comes. Anything else you want, I will do my best to give it to you.\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu is a man and now the Emperor so that is why you are so strict and demanding with him. I\u2019m not the same, you want to pamper and coddle me because you want to alleviate your guilt towards Grandmother, my Mom, my Uncles, all of that you want to now give me. But there is no amount of power in this world that can guarantee my happiness. Plus what you owe them is owed to them and you can never make it up with me, and I don\u2019t want it! You just be my grandfather, and like all the grandfathers in the world, you worry about my future marriage and happiness but can do nothing about it other than worry until in the end you sigh and say \u201cgrandchildren have their own fated happiness!\u201dXiao Yao fanned herself and smiled at the Yellow Emperor \u201cYou never experienced wanting to do something but not being able to, right? Try that on me then!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor looked very torn.That night after Zhuan Xu was done with work and leaving the court, the Yellow Emperor\u2019s servant came up and he followed him back to the Yellow Emperor\u2019s residence.He saw the maids preparing dinner and said \u201cI\u2019ll dine here with Grandfather.\u201dZhuan Xu ate dinner with the Yellow Emperor and afterwards the maids brought out sour date tea. Zhuan Xu took a sip \u201cIt\u2019s strangely tasty\u201d and the Yellow Emperor explained \u201cXiao Yao won\u2019t let me drink tea with dinner but after dinner she concocted a special tea for me.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cIt\u2019s amazing she\u2019s willing to put the effort into learning healing medicine for Grandfather.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cI called you here because there is one task I need you to do your best to make happen.\u201d\u201cGrandfather please tell me.\u201d\u201cFind a way to get Xiang Liu to agree to come to our side. I know it\u2019s very difficult, in the past hundreds of years I\u2019ve asked Qing, Hou Tu, Cang Lin, and even Little Zhu Rong, all of them tried and were turned down by Xiang Liu. But I wish for you to try nonetheless.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhuan Xu paused and then asked \u201cWhy does Grandfather care so much about Xiang Liu?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cJust an old man\u2019s little bit of regret.\u201dZhuan Xu saw that the Yellow Emperor wasn\u2019t going to explain more so he didn\u2019t ask more and only said \u201cI will do my best but I think it\u2019s hopeless.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cPeople do their best, the Heavens determines the outcome!\u201dThe Wan Lei Consort was the first wife taken by Zhuan Xu after he ascended the throne so the wedding was much more grand than when Zhuan Xu married Shu Hui. Zhi Jin Palace was transformed inside and out with color and celebration.Ah Nian tried to console herself but to no avail and decided to not even bother releasing some steam on Xiao Yao and instead said \u201cJiejie, let\u2019s go down the mountain to play for a bit!\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhere to?\u201dAh Nian thought \u201cHow about to find Xing Yue?\u201dXiao Yao informed the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu that she was taking Ah Nian to Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence to find Xing Yue.The friends.h.i.+p between women could be so strange, two women who ought to be rivals but because the man was marrying a third woman, those first two women instead felt like the same victims and were strangely\u00a0friendly with each other. Ah Nian and Xing Yue grew up in similar surroundings and they had so much to discuss \u2013 the best cloth, the most cutting edge designs and color combinations, the latest fas.h.i.+onable hair styles\u2026..Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t get a word in and only watched them smile and chat.Xiao Yao grew more and more quiet but Ah Nian and Xing Yue didn\u2019t notice anything was off. They always saw Xiao Yao as someone casual and strange and a bit aloof. They didn\u2019t know that Xiao Yao was in truth scared of being lonely and loved to talk.Because the Emperor was taking a new consort, Zhi Yi Castle was extra bustling and the shops were decked out with their best wares. Xing Yue and Ah Nian channeled their disappointment into a frenzied shopping spree \u2013 make up, buy! silk, buy! jewelry, buy!\u2026..The two went from store to store while Xiao Yao took her time coming out holding multiple bags in each hand. It wasn\u2019t clear if the bags weren\u2019t secured properly or was simply too heavy but it suddenly spilled everywhere.It rained last night so the ground had puddles and as Xiao Yao leaned down to pick up the fallen items, a carriage drove past without stopping and the wheel splashed water on Xiao Yao\u2019s face.Xiao Yao wiped her face with her sleeve and continued picking the items up and checking to see if it was dirtied. Someone knelt down to help her.\u201cThank you\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao raised her head and saw the person helping her was Jing. Xiao Yao immediately couldn\u2019t speak and felt her tiny bit of downtrodden was magnified.Jing packed the fallen boxes together and tied it with the rope \u201cToss the spilled box and I\u2019ll have the clerk get you another.\u201dXiao Yao felt her eyes redden and tears threatened to fall so she suddenly stood up and ran down the street without a thought as to where she was going other than she needed to get away.She kept telling herself that losing a man wasn\u2019t anything, she could still live well. She used her willpower and controlled it all but in this very moment all the emotion she kept bottled up inside suddenly spiraled out of control.Xiao Yao turned left and right through the streets and entered the underground gambling den run by the Li Jie tribe.The gambling den didn\u2019t allow in just any customer and in the past Xiang Liu was the one who brought Xiao Yao so this time coming alone the two guards were prepared to toss her out. They were about to talk when suddenly a small white fox appeared on top of Xiao Yao\u2019s head and angrily scratched at the air with its claw.The two men politely offered her a dog faced mask and opened the door to show her into the long corridor. Xiao Yao put on the mask and entered the den. She sat down at a table and released all her emotions as she gambled and realized that the rule to have everyone wear masks allowed people to release feelings they normally would never show.Xiao Yao kept winning and her bets kept getting bigger without any desire to stop. She was hoping to cause a scene, just like the Yellow Emperor said, she could be impetuous and do what she wanted for once. But oddly the house did nothing, Xiao Yao kept winning and no one came to stop her. The other gamblers started crowding around her and watched her bet and followed suit until everyone was winning along with her.Xiao Yao was getting bored, did Zhuan Xu have some sort of agreement with the Li Jie tribe leader that during his wedding the doggies couldn\u2019t cause a scene in the castle?Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know that in another room, the Li Jie tribe leader Li Jie Chang was sitting before a water mirror watching her every move with interest. He said to Jing \u201cWho is that girl? Last time when you hid out at my place getting drunk for days, it couldn\u2019t have been because of her?\u201dJing said nothing and just watched Xiao Yao, the water mirror reflected the flower, it could only be viewed and not touched.Li Jie Chang grumbled \u201cThat girl is sure crazy when she gambles, I run a little business so you\u2019re going to have to give me back all that money!\u201dOn the other side of the gambling hall, Fang Feng Bei watched as everyone rushed over to one table. He casually got up and sauntered over only to smile and shake his head when he saw the little mountain of coins in front of Xiao Yao.Everyone was in different outfits but all wearing the same dog face mask and it was impossible to see who was who, but Fang Feng Bei was just different and Xiao Yao immediately knew that was him.Xiao Yao glared at Fang Feng Bei and placed all her winnings on one bet\u2026.and then promptly lost.The crowd gasped and then slowly dispersed.Xiao Yao walked out of the gambling den with Fang Feng Bei chuckling at her \u201cYou seem in a p.i.s.sy mood. But in this day and age, I can\u2019t imagine anyone in the vast wilderness who dares make you upset.\u201dThe two arrived at the end of the corridor and Xiao Yao sniped back \u201cAs far as the edge of the sky, as close as right before my eyes.\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cThe future Chi Sui clan leader wife, where is that proud future husband of yours? How come you came to such a place alone?\u201dXiao Yao silently took off her dog face mask as did Fang Feng Bei.Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou already know I\u2019m engaged?\u201d\u201cSomething so newsworthy, it\u2019s hard not to know even if one doesn\u2019t want to know! I forgot to say congratulations!\u201dXiao Yao silently stared at Fang Feng Bei for a few moments before shaking her head with a smile \u201cI need to discuss two things with you.\u201dFang Feng Bei played with his mask \u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cThe first is making poisons for you. I can still do it now but after\u2026.I\u2019m married I won\u2019t be able to anymore.\u201dFang Feng Bei held the mask still and smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cAnd the second?\u201d\u201cI want to remove the voodoo bug linking us. The Tu Shan Madam had a doctor from the Jiu Li tribe who said that\u2026\u2026.our bug might be the legendary Lover\u2019s Bug. This bug is used by lovers\u2026..and you and I\u2026..it\u2019s not suitable!\u201d Xiao Yao mockingly said \u201cLast time you said you were annoyed by the bug so I want to know when you have free time to go to Jiu Li with me so that we can find the Voodoo King to remove the bug.\u201dFang Feng Bei stared at Xiao Yao and under the dim light of the gambling hall his sliver of a smile felt cold.Xiao Yao added \u201cEven if the bug is removed, I\u2019ll still be good for my promise.\u201dXiang Liu coolly said \u201cFine, wait until I have time.\u201dThe two silently left the gambling den and Xiao Yao handed her mask to the guards before exiting with Fang Feng Bei.It was already dark outside with the half moon hanging in the sky. Xiao Yao forced a smile and said to Fang Feng Bei \u201cI\u2019ll keep sending poisons every three months. I\u2019m off now.\u201dFang Feng Bei grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s arm. She didn\u2019t look back but also didn\u2019t pull of his grasp. Her body was tense as she quietly waited. After a good long while, Fang Feng Bei said \u201cHave dinner with me.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s entire body sagged and she shook her head with a forced smile \u201cI don\u2019t have time!\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cYou best not turn down what a certain person has decided to do.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Fang Feng Bei right now!\u201d\u201cAll that stuff you just said, who was it meant for?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao took a deep breath \u201cFine, General Xiang Liu!\u201dFang Feng Bei took Xiao Yao to a small alley and before they even got close she could smell the mouthwatering aroma.Pus.h.i.+ng open the tattered wooden door, inside was a rundown house with an one-armed old man holding a giant ladle standing in front of a big pot. He glanced at Fang Feng Bei and smiled \u201cWhat a rarity, hundreds of visits and it\u2019s the first time you brought a friend. And a girl to boot.\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled and walked through the house and out another door into a small courtyard. They sat down on the straw pallet while the one-armed old man brought them two bowls of seafood and meat soup along with a plate of large biscuits. He limped as he walked over to place it on the table.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhat smells so good?\u201d\u201cDonkey meat.\u201d Fang Feng Bei pointed to the old man \u201cHe\u2019s from the Li Jie tribe and the tribe\u2019s specialty is stewing donkey meat. In the vast wilderness, there is no other who can cook donkey meat like he does.\u201dThe old man brought a plate of vegetables for Xiao Yao \u201cMade this just for you.\u201dXiao Yao wasn\u2019t very hungry so drank and nibbled on the food. The old man sat down on a wood chopping stool and drank while talking with Xiang Liu. Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t able to understand all they were talking about, other than it was about people they both knew and who was dead now. The old man\u2019s att.i.tude was very placid as was Xiang Liu, but in this soft muggy Summer night Xiao Yao suddenly felt the sorrow of having friends pa.s.s away.In the quiet out-of-the-way alley, Li Jie Chang was walking and nagging \u201cLook at you! When the woman was there you didn\u2019t even have the courage to show your face before her. Then you watched her leave with another man and can only look despondent.\u201dJing said sadly \u201cWhat can I do if I show up before her?\u201dLi Jie Chang pushed open the wooden door \u201cLet me tell you, there is only three moves you need to deal with women. Rush up to her and toss her over your shoulder, take her home and deposit her on the pallet, take her clothes off and jump her! It\u2019s a done deal just like that! You have to do as I tell you and I guarantee she\u2019ll docilely follow you.\u201dXiao Yao heard such ridiculous bravado advice and burst out laughing.Li Jie Chang heard her laugh and scowled \u201cWhich gal dare mock me? I\u2019ll cart you home tonight!\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cTry carting but don\u2019t break your back!\u201dLi Jie Chang laughed out loud as he walked into the courtyard and stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei. He first greeted Bei and it was clear from his tone of voice that they were quite familiar with each other.Chang then turned back to chuckle at Jing \u201cIt\u2019s sure a small world!\u201dJing stood there stiffly not moving while Li Jie Chang boldly sat down at another table and said to the old man \u201cBring the meat.\u201dThe old man put down his wine bowl and smiled as he stood up and said to Jing \u201cSit!\u201dJing walked over and sat down.The old man brought them soup and biscuits before sitting back down on the wooden stool with his wine bowl continuing to chat with Fang Feng Bei.Li Jie Chang grinned at Xiao Yao \u201cHey! I say\u2026.Little Lady, what\u2019s your name?\u201dXiao Yao ignored him and put on a totally engrossed face as she listened to Fang Feng Bei talking with the old man.Li Jie Chang said \u201cLittle Lady, Fang Feng Bei is like that old man, neither are good stuff. Following Bei isn\u2019t a good bet, why don\u2019t you seriously consider my pal here. My pal here was accidentally set up by a woman and a son resulted, but it\u2019s not a mistake that can\u2019t be forgiven\u2026.\u201d\u201cChang!\u201d Jing glared at Li Jie Chang with his eyes blazing a warning.\u201cYour warning is useless, when I d.a.m.n well want to talk I\u2019m going to talk even if you put a sword to my throat.\u201dLi Jie Chang leaned over towards Xiao Yao \u201cThere is no perfect thing in this world and everyone makes mistakes. Jing made a mistake but it\u2019s not an unforgivable mistake. Think about it, because he made the mistake now he\u2019ll never make the same mistake again. After marriage you won\u2019t even need to worry about him! You try finding a man who has never made a mistake, and even if you do you can\u2019t guarantee he won\u2019t make a mistake after marriage. Then you\u2019ll be even more upset!\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cAre you done?\u201dLi Jie Chang said \u201cNo!\u201dXiao Yao turned her head and poured wine for Fang Feng Bei, clearly not intending to hear more.Li Jie Chang said \u201cYou don\u2019t like the wife and son in Qing Qiu, then just have another residence here in Zhi Yi and have Jing live here with you. Let me tell you straight up, Fang Feng Bei\u2019s life\u00a0is here today with no guarantee of tomorrow. Even Jing who made a mistake is a better choice than Fang Feng Bei\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao slammed her wine bowl on the table and gave Li Jie Chang a piercing look \u201cI\u2019m already engaged and my fiancee isn\u2019t him. So please, please, I beg you stop stepping all over Bei!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Jie Chang was incredulous and howled \u201cWho is it? Who dares take my brother\u2019s woman? I\u2019m going to knock down with him! If he doesn\u2019t cancel the engagement, then I\u2019m going to break both his legs\u2026\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao laughed out loud and said coldly \u201cChi Sui Feng Long, you go talk with him then!\u201d\u201cFeng Long\u2026..\u201d Li Jie Chang stuttered \u201cYou\u2026..you are Feng Long\u2019s fiancee? You are the Gao Xing Princess, Zhuan Xu little sister cousin?\u201dXiao Yao glared at Chang and said to Fang Feng Bei \u201cYou are sure even-tempered with this guy.\u201dFang Feng Bei drank his wine and said casually \u201cEvery word he said is the truth. I\u2019m not a guy suitable for a woman to follow. Isn\u2019t that something you already know?\u201dXiao Yao stared at Fang Feng Bei and couldn\u2019t utter a response.The one-armed man stared at Xiao Yao and suddenly asked \u201cYou are the daughter of the Xuan Yuan Princess?\u201dXiao Yao turned to the old man \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYour dad is\u2026..\u201dLi Jie Chang just called out that she was the Gao Xing Princess, didn\u2019t the one-armed old man hear that? Xiao Yao quizzically answered \u201cThe Gao Xing Grand Emperor.\u201dThe one-armed old man stared intently at Xiao Yao before downing all the wine in his bowl and then launching into a song. His song was sad and plaintive, singing about the fallen Sheng Nong kingdom and the sorrow of the soldiers fighting.Xiao Yao listened intently and suddenly remembered the blood red sunset when Xiang Liu was dressed all in white and walked towards her from a burning funeral pyre of dead Sheng Nong soldiers.Li Jie Chang yelled \u201cUncle, stop your drunken craziness!\u201dThe old man kept singing so Li Jie Chang shoved him into the house and nervously said to Xiao Yao \u201cThe old man has low tolerance but loves drinking. When he gets crazy he loves to sing songs he heard from places\u2026..he only has one arm now and his legs can barely walk, he\u2019s already useless\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI only came to eat. Once I walk out this door I\u2019ll forget everything.\u201dLi Jie Chang was relieved and listened to the singing from inside the house and sadly added \u201cMy Uncle isn\u2019t a bad guy, in fact he\u2019s too good of a guy which is why he\u2026.can\u2019t forget.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly realized that when Li Jie Chang was talking about Fang Feng Bei earlier, all the things he was saying were about Xiang Liu. Did he know Fang Feng Bei was Xiang Liu?That meant Jing also knew now that Bei was Xiang Liu.Xiao Yao looked over at Jing and then back at Bei before saying to Bei \u201cAre you done eating? If you\u2019re done then let\u2019s go!\u201dXiao Yao and Bei walked out while Chang chased out after them \u201cLittle Lady!\u201dXiao Yao stopped and looked back wearily \u201cWhat else do you want to say?\u201d\u201cKnowing your ident.i.ty, what else can I say? I just wanted to tell you that Jing\u2019s son was due to him falling into the trap set by Fang Feng Yi Yang and his own grandmother. All these years since Jing lives alone and he never allows Yi Yang near him. I use my life as Li Jie Chang to swear that Jing deeply loves you, he only has eyes for you.\u201dXiao Yao turned and walked away. The night was quiet and the road was long \u2013 which way was her path?Xiao Yao softly asked \u201cBei, tell me\u2026..why is it so hard to find a person to walk the path with?\u201dFang Feng Bei said \u201cFinding a person isn\u2019t hard, finding a person who shares the same interest, genuinely treats you well, and makes the journey more interesting, that is what is hard.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cCan one never forget a person for an entire life?\u201d\u201cDepends on the person. If you are talking about Jing, then I think it\u2019s highly possible.\u201d\u201cDo you mean he can\u2019t forget me, or I can\u2019t forget him?\u201dFang Feng Bei smiled \u201cHowever you want to interpret.\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her brows and angrily said \u201cThere are a lot of good men left in the vast wilderness!\u201d\u201cThere are plenty of good men, but there isn\u2019t many who will really put you inside his heart.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? So I shouldn\u2019t marry Feng Long?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean anything. You asked me so I honestly told you my thoughts.\u201d\u201cXiang Liu, I really don\u2019t know, what is your heart thinking deep down inside?\u201d\u201cYou and me are travelers who have crossed paths in this windy world. Whenever we meet we are each other\u2019s companions to enjoy the world is all! Why do you care what I think deep down inside?\u201dXiao Yao mocked herself \u201cYes, it\u2019s my over thinking! No matter what you feel deep down inside, none of has anything to do with me!\u201dXiang Liu stared down the dark alley and said nothing.Xiao Yao was silent for a few moments and then casually said \u201cJing knows you\u2019re Xiang Liu now. He won\u2019t tell my Gege but if Feng Long knows, Gege will find out. You\u2026\u2026be careful.\u201dXiang Liu stared at Xiao Yao and she avoided his piercing gaze and asked \u201cWho was that old man selling donkey meat?\u201d\u201cHe used to be a subordinate of Qi Yo and one of the survivors in the final battle in Yi Province. Carrying all the memories of those who perished, it\u2019s easier just to have died.\u201d Xiang Liu smiled \u201cActually, to a General, the best ending is to die on the battlefield.\u201dIt was a warm Summer night but Xiao Yao suddenly felt her entire body turn cold in an instant.They arrived outside Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence and Xiao Yao and Xiang Liu both stopped at the same time. But one didn\u2019t depart and the other didn\u2019t go in. They just silently stood there.In the past she felt they had so many opportunities to see each other, but it wasn\u2019t clear when it began that Xiao Yao started to feel that she was seeing less and less of him. Until tonight, when this feeling became impossible to ignore.After a few moments, Xiang Liu said \u201cYou go inside!\u201dXiao Yao wanted to talk to him but she didn\u2019t know what she wanted to say. She said \u201cNow is not like before, you shouldn\u2019t come to the Middle Plains so often anymore.\u201dXiao Yao thought Xiang Liu would mock her, asking whether she was worried Zhuan Xu would kill him, or worried he would kill Zhuan Xu. But surprisingly Xiang Liu said nothing and continued to just look at her.Xiao Yao quietly stood there waiting, but she didn\u2019t know what she was waiting for.Xiang Liu cold voice spoke \u201cYou go inside!\u201dXiao Yao smiled and curtsied to him before turning to knock on the door. The door opened and Xiao Yao stepped inside while Xiang Liu continued to stand outside, white robe black hair, tall and proud, like the white snow on the black mountains in the North, even if it was covered with flowers it would still look imposing.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t take another step and stood rooted in place staring at him as the door slowly closed and Xiang Liu disappeared from sight.Xiao Yao returned to her residence to find Xing Yue and Ah Nian were both there trying on the items they bought earlier during the day. Seeing her back, both groused \u201cGood older sister, next time let us know before you suddenly disappear? Thank G.o.d the store clerk said you left with a friend so we weren\u2019t left worried.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and said nothing. The two continued to discuss their new outfits and giggled merrily. Xiao Yao laid on her pallet and felt her mind in a daze \u2013 these people were her friend and family, so why did she feel so lonely right now?The day Zhuan Xu married the Wan Lei Consort, all the Middle Plains and Xuan Yuan prominent families gathered on Sheng Nong Mountain and all of Zhi Jin Court was abuzz with merriment.Now Zhuan Xu was the Emperor so the officials handled everything within the palace leaving Xiao Yao watching from the sidelines. She initially worried about Ah Nian but found Ah Nian handling it well. She didn\u2019t like it so she dragged Xiao Yao off early back to her residence. Xiao Yao kept Ah Nian company as she got drunk and the next day the two of them woke up around noon to find all the guests had departed and it was over. The only difference was another woman was now living on Zhi Jin Palace. But the Palace was big so a year could go by and they wouldn\u2019t even run into her once.Life returned to normal, Ah Nian remained happy as she kept the Yellow Emperor company because that meant she could see her Zhuan Xu gege every day as well.Xiao Yao stopped practicing archery, likely after Zhuan Xu became Emperor the threat was gone so she stopped pus.h.i.+ng herself so hard. She became very lazy and seemed uninterested in anything. All she liked to do every day was sleep, often past noon was when she woke. She had lunch and then went to visit the Yellow Emperor but would sit in his residence in a listless daze.Ah Nian always found Xiao Yao weird so nothing Xiao Yao did made her think anything was wrong.The Yellow Emperor asked a few times \u201cXiao Yao, what are you thinking about?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cNothing, which is why this is called being in a daze.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stopped asking and let her be.Zhuan Xu worriedly probed \u201cXiao Yao, what\u2019s with you lately?\u201dXiao Yao lazily drawled \u201cWorking so hard for so many years, now you\u2019re the Emperor can\u2019t you let me relax? Or is it that if I\u2019m lazy and do nothing then you won\u2019t take care of me.\u201dZhuan Xu warmly said \u201cNo matter what you\u2019re like, I am willing to take care of you for your entire life.\u201dAh Nian heard that and immediately asked \u201cWhat about me? Me too?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cYou, too. Since\u2026.\u201dAh Nian quickly asked \u201cSince what?\u201d\u201cSince if you eat to much I can just ask Master for more money.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..you\u2019re such a cheapskate!\u201d Ah Nian hurtled over to hit Zhuan Xu and also tell on him \u201cGrandfather, did you hear what Gege just said?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cYour dad is going to have to prepare a dowry for you anyways, even if Zhuan Xu doesn\u2019t want it your dad will give it.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s face turned beet red and she darted behind the Yellow Emperor\u2019s back and lightly rapped his back in embarra.s.sment.That night when Xiao Yao was getting ready for bed, Zhuan Xu suddenly came.Xiao Yao asked in surprised \u201cA rare guest! Is anything going on?\u201dZhuan Xu sat down on the pallet \u201cCan\u2019t I come see you if nothing is going on?\u201d\u201cOf course not, but didn\u2019t we already see each other this afternoon at Grandfather\u2019s residence?\u201d\u201cI just heard Ah Nian jabbering on and didn\u2019t hear you say anything.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cAll is well so there is nothing to say.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao \u201cXiao Yao, are you living well? Are you happy?\u201dXiao Yao was taken aback \u201cWhy\u2026.why are you suddenly asking me this?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cMiao Pu says you often sit alone late into the night. I thought as time pa.s.sed you will get better but lately you seem more and more distant and uninterested. I\u2019m really worried about you.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI\u2019m fine. With you ascending the throne I don\u2019t have any pressure anymore so I\u2019m not as hard on myself to do things.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao until gradually she stopped smiling \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d Xiao Yao laid down on the pillow and buried her face in her arms and used her sleeve to cover her head.Zhuan Xu said \u201cNow that I am on the throne, I can give you the things I couldn\u2019t give you before. I want you to live better than you used to, but now you\u2026\u2026.did I do something wrong?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cNo, you did nothing wrong. I messed up myself.\u201d\u201cXiao Yao, tell me.\u201dZhuan Xu sat next to Xiao Yao and said in a low voice \u201cXiao Yao, what is there in this world that you can\u2019t tell me?\u201dXiao Yao finally spoke \u201cSince breaking up with Jing my heart aches so I can\u2019t sleep well. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal and keep on living as usual. Since you ascended the throne, for whatever reason I suddenly feel exhausted and uninterested in anything. I don\u2019t have the pressure to get up the next day so I don\u2019t even sleep well that night. I keep remembering the days I spent with Jing in Qing Shui Town and then remembering life with you when we were small and living on Cao Yun Court. I like those times but I don\u2019t like living in memories of the past. No matter how wonderful the past was, it\u2019s gone now. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so weak and useless and I don\u2019t like myself now\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu quietly listened.A person can be hurt two ways, one is physical and can be seen and the other is emotional and cannot be seen. No matter how strong, a person who is physically injured will rest and heal. But emotional injury, the stronger a person is, the more the person will pretend it never happened and live on as usual. But this type of injury is even harder to heal.Abandoned by her mother, running for her life, turning into a faceless monster, living alone in the deep mountains, captured by the Nine-tailed fox, wandering by herself\u2026\u2026.all those things injured Xiao Yao deeply but she stayed strong and pushed the injuries deep down inside and pretended it didn\u2019t happen. She told herself that she was grown now and those things were in the past.Xiao Yao appeared carefree and want for nothing, but due to her experiences as a child she actually longed for a stable home more than anyone, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have formed her own mismatched family when she was Wen Xiao Liu.Xiao Yao placed all her hope for a family on Jing, which is why his leaving her was like the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. But even if she couldn\u2019t handle it anymore, it happened during the most dangerous time for the battle for the Xuan Yuan throne so Xiao Yao had to keep being strong for Zhuan Xu. Now that Zhuan Xu was safe, she finally collapsed inside.Zhuan Xu\u2019s heart hurt and for the first time he started to detest Jing. Xiao Yao gave her trust and hope, which took so much courage and effort on her part that normal people couldn\u2019t imagine. She was building a home on a bruised and battered body, yet Jing shattered Xiao Yao\u2019s trust and hope.Zhuan Xu stroked Xiao Yao\u2019s head \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone anymore. I\u2019m here. You can be weak if you want. You can even cry! Don\u2019t worry!\u201dXiao Yao felt tears come, since she was small every step she took she couldn\u2019t be weak because that would mean death. She never allowed herself to soften and be weak and she didn\u2019t know how she actually survived such a difficult childhood to arrive at this point only to break down now? But every night all her dreams brought forth so much pain it was like a flood threatening to drown her.Xiao Yao said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I trust time will heal everything.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI learned many years ago that the wounds on the heart are very hard to heal. That is why I still can\u2019t forgive my mom even now.\u201d\u201cThe physical injuries have medicine to heal, there must also be a way to heal emotional injuries.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t any.\u201d\u201cHow to heal?\u201d\u201cWhat you have today will make up for what you lost before. The happiness now will cover the pain of the past. I can\u2019t forgive my mom but because you are by my side, all the pain of losing her has already been smoothed out and covered over.\u201dXiao Yao silently thought about it and forced a smile \u201cAre you encouraging me to find a new lover?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI just hope there is a person out there who can pave over the pain Jing left on you. That you can believe you are treasured, you are loved, you are valued, you are someone he can never ever let go of.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s tears swam in her eyes and she murmured \u201cI\u2019ve always been unlucky. This type of lucky thing I don\u2019t even dare to hope for.\u201dZhuan Xu said in a low voice \u201cIt\u2019s there, Xiao Yao, it\u2019s there.\u201dZhuan Xu kept Xiao Yao company until she fell asleep. He got up and covered her with the blanket. Even though Xiao Yao refused to cry in front of him because she was so headstrong, but right now the tears were slowly falling from her eyes.Zhuan Xu lightly wiped away her tears with his fingers. Years ago if he knew that one day Xiao Yao would be crying because of Jing, then even if he wanted and needed the Tu Shan clan\u2019s a.s.sistance he would have never allowed Jing a chance to get close to Xiao Yao. Right now he hated Jing, but he hated himself even more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter of Lost You Forever finally feels like a chance for a fresh start for Xiao Yao. Of course I love her with the three guys who love her, kind patient Jing, volatile perplexing Xiang Liu, and constant oppa Zhuan Xu. From the moment the books start she\u2019s always been tied up with one or more of the men around despite her conscious desire to be independent and not rely on others to avoid getting hurt. The last few chapters have been hard on Xiao Yao\u2019s emotional well being but nothing worse than the childhood she survived. I want to see more about what she wants outside of finding a person to walk life\u2019s road with. If she does find such a guy, who loves her and she loves back and being together isn\u2019t going to involve world shattering imminent death, what is she going to do in that very ordinary life she craves. The easy answer is to go back to being a little doctor in a little clinic in a little town. But the first time around Xiao Yao didn\u2019t really take it seriously. It was yet another way for her to form a ragtag life without a long time outlook.Now that Jing is married and has a son, Xiang Liu\u2019s duty as a General in the Sheng Nong resistance army is heating up under pressure from Zhuan Xu\u2019s powerful rule, will Xiao Yao finally look at her Zhuan Xu gege in a different light when suddenly there is no other men around and the two of them don\u2019t need to worry about one wrong step leading to danger? I do want her to grasp how important she is to Zhuan Xu, and important beyond being his family and little sister. Zhuan Xu\u2019s love for Xiao Yao is just as sad in that he can\u2019t express it and she doesn\u2019t even know it. At least Xiao Yao isn\u2019t that dense as to be unable to sense that Xiang Liu feels something for her. He stubbornly refuses to openly admit it, and she also keeps getting reminded by everyone around her that Xiang Liu is not\u00a0an option. Poor Xiao Yao gets tugged around until finally she decides to step back and get herself out of the center of the maelstrom for now.Chapter 30 \u2013 No Reason for a Desire to Return:Spring went and Winter came, Winter left and Spring arrived, in the blink of an eye three years pa.s.sed.Zhuan Xu was the only grandson of the Yellow Emperor and Empress Lei Zhu. It was unexpected the way he ascended the throne but also understandable. The Xuan Yuan elders initially opposed him but Zhuan Xu was patient and used grace to lessen their opposition on one hand while being strict and forceful on the other hand. Gradually all the Xuan Yuan prominent families acceded to him and acknowledged him as the Emperor.Zhuan Xu saw the time was right and brought up moving the capital from Xuan Yuan Castle to Zhi Yi Castle. He was already governing from Sheng Nong Mountain but Zhi Yi Castle was not officially designated as the capital. When Zhuan Xu broached this topic it caused waves to ripple as all the Middle Plains families supported it while the Xuan Yuan elders vehemently opposed it.But Zhuan Xu\u2019s mind was made up and he a.s.signed Yu Jiang to write up the capital move plan. Yu Jiang\u2019s plan was thorough and detailed and everyone knew he was Zhuan Xu\u2019s trusted subordinate so clearly this plan was in the works for awhile. With such a detailed plan in hand, people had no room to object and even the Xuan Yuan elders had to concede that Xuan Yuan Castle was no longer suitable to be the capital for the increasingly powerful Xuan Yuan Kingdom.After half a year, Zhuan Xu overcame any lingering opposition and ordered the capital to be moved.Zhuan Xu\u2019s followers included people who spent the last fifty years renovating the palaces so had lots of experience with construction, plus with the Middle Plains full support, after the royal decree came down everyone threw all their energy into it . After a year of building and reconstruction and renovation, a bigger, better, and more fortified castle wall and palace was built on top of the original Sheng Nong Kingdom capital.Perhaps it was due to consideration for the Xuan Yuan elders, or because of his own nostalgia, Zhuan Xu renamed Zhi Yi Palace as Shang Heng Palace which was the same name as the Xuan Yuan Palace. The Middle Plains families didn\u2019t care about this name but it made the Xuan Yuan elders happy to feel like they were the legitimate side. In the end both sides were happy.Zhuan Xu picked a auspicious day for the official capital move and the designation of Zhi Yi Castle as the capital city of Xuan Yuan.Zhuan Xu visited the Yellow Emperor every day and briefed him on the progress. The Yellow Emperor never offered any suggestions or praise or criticism, only taking everything in calmly with a silent a.s.sessment. He was weighing whether Zhuan Xu was like he boasted to the world, having a grand vision, broad ambition, brilliant mind, and vast energy.It was clear he was pleased with Zhuan Xu\u2019s rule, his grandson not only did not disappoint him and even managed to surprise him.On the day when Zhi Yi Castle became the Xuan Yuan capital, the Yellow Emperor listened to the fireworks going off outside and said to Xiao Yao \u201cZhuan Xu did well!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYou\u2019ve been so silent on this that many officials even used you to pressure Zhuan Xu! They said you and Grandmother built Xuan Yuan Castle personally that you would never agree to the capital move.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cTo move the capital is to shatter tradition and requires shouldering a lot of pressure. But Zhuan Xu did it so well!\u201dXiao Yao was proud of Zhuan Xu as well \u201cWhatever Gege wants to do, he will never give up!\u201dWith everything all settled, Zhuan Xu came one day to see the Yellow Emperor who found a reason to send Ah Nian aside so they could talk.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cIt\u2019s time to announce an Empress and allow the Middle Plains to be fully at ease.\u201dZhuan Xu unconsciously glanced at Xiao Yao and she perked up and asked \u201cWho does Gege want to be your Empress?\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s lips were tightly pursed and he said nothing.The Yellow Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu and sighed inside his heart before slowly stating \u201cOf course it can only be Sheng Nong Xing Yue.\u201dXiao Yao yelled \u201cI don\u2019t agree!\u201dZhuan Xu glanced with unbridled joy at XIao Yao as she grumbled \u201cI don\u2019t object to Xing Yue becoming the Empress but what about Ah Nian? Where do you guys leave her?\u201dThe happiness seeped out of Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes and he lowered his head seemingly in a daze.The Yellow Emperor explained to Xiao Yao \u201cIf Ah Nian becomes Empress, the Sheng Nong tribe will be furious and the Chi Sui clan will also feel slighted. It will leave the entire Middle Plains feeling like Zhuan Xu crossed the bridge and then tore it down, lying to them. If we stayed in Xuan Yuan Mountain then we would have room to retreat but we\u2019ve moved the capital now so there is no way back. We can only keep going forward. What do you want to do, Xiao Yao? Send the world into chaos again just for one Ah Nian?\u201dXiao Yao had no response. She hardly left the mountain these past few years but the few times she went down she could see the vast wilderness changing before her eyes. The Middle Plains families were cautiously accepting the Xuan Yuan elders clans as they also cautiously stepped in. In this critical juncture, it was like two powerful beasts residing in the same mountain as they wearily circled each other. If they determined neither had ill intent then they would live in harmony and even become companions in the future. If if there was even a slight tense wind blowing, it could lead to them attacking and tearing each other apart.Xiao Yao walked up to Zhuan Xu \u201cGege, between Xing Yue and Ah Nian, who do you want to be your Empress?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cWhichever one you guys want. I don\u2019t care since this is all my life will be!\u201d He stood up and walked out without even a farewell greeting to the Yellow Emperor.Xiao Yao stamped her feet \u201cGege! You, you\u2026.what do you mean you don\u2019t care!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cLet him be alone for now!\u201dXiao Yao angrily glared at the Yellow Emperor \u201cIf Grandfather has already decided on Xing Yue as the Empress, why did you give Ah Nian hope?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Ah Nian about this so don\u2019t worry about it. Ah Nian, come in here!\u201dAh Nian bit her lips and walked in with her eyes red, clearly she already overheard the news that Zhuan Xu was going to take Xing Yue as his Empress.The Yellow Emperor waved to Xiao Yao to leave and gently said to Ah Nian \u201cCome here to grandfather, I have some things to say to you.\u201d\u201cGrandfather!\u201d Ah Nian buried her face in the Yellow Emperor\u2019s lap and started bawling.Xiao Yao walked out to the sound of Ah Nian crying. She felt so helpless knowing that the Yellow Emperor was still manipulating people even in his small chambers.It was dark by the time Ah Nian returned to her chamber where Xiao Yao was waiting for her. She saw Ah Nian\u2019s eyes swollen like two peaches and sighed \u201cDid you use up an entire lifetime\u2019s worth of tears today?\u201dAh Nian said \u201cI wish.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhat did you discuss with grandfather?\u201dAh Nian said \u201cI made a promise to grandfather and that is between us.\u201d\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going back to Gao Xing tomorrow.\u201dXiao Yao was thrilled \u201cYou don\u2019t want to marry Zhuan Xu anymore? That\u2019s great!\u201dAh Nian said \u201cWhat are you talking about? I just think it\u2019s not suitable for me to live here anymore. No matter how many wives Zhuan Xu gege takes I can ignore it as unrelated to me. But the Empress is not like the other wives, now Zhi Jin Palace will have a mistress of the house and she won\u2019t welcome me to stay here. I\u2019m still the Gao Xing Princess so even if I can do anything for Zhuan Xu gege I still can\u2019t embarra.s.s Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her eyebrows and stared at Ah Nian wondering what the Yellow Emperor said to her.Ah Nian said to Xiao Yao \u201cJiejie, don\u2019t waste your life sleepwalking through each day. You\u2019re not a kid anymore, you need to start thinking about your own future.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re talking about me?\u201d Xiao Yao was caught off guard.Ah Nian sincerely said \u201cYou are listless all day with nothing to do. If it\u2019s just Zhuan Xu gege, Grandfather, and me around then no one will care. But once Xing Yue becomes Empress she will become the mistress of this palace. In the past you were above her but going forward she will be above you. Even her father needs to bow to her when he sees her, much less you\u2019re just a sister-in-law. Once the positions change between people then many things will change. She will look at you differently and treat you differently. She won\u2019t be happy with your casual att.i.tude. You don\u2019t even give the proper respect to the Grand Emperor or the Yellow Emperor, much to an Empress like she will become.\u201dXiao Yao conceded \u201cI really can\u2019t give her the respect to curry favor with her.\u201dAh Nian said \u201cNo matter how you treat Dad and Grandfather, they will not mind since they are your family. But Xing Yue will mind, a woman\u2019s heart is small especially someone like Xing Yue who has spent her entire life trying to reach her position in life. Your casual att.i.tude will only lead her to think you don\u2019t give her the proper respect and she\u2019ll start to resent you. How she will deal with you is something I don\u2019t even dare have a clue about.\u201dXiao Yao was shocked \u201cDid Grandfather explain all this to you?\u201dAh Nian glared \u201cGrandfather said a bit but more about life and not specifically about you. I grew up in a palace so I know a lot even if I\u2019ve not yet experienced it. The way I treat Grandfather is exactly that, friendly with a side of b.u.t.tering him up.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and laughed \u201cThat\u2019s true! So that was you being friendly and b.u.t.tering him up.\u201dAh Nian retorted \u201cSeeing as how you spoke up on my behalf, I wanted to give you some advice but you\u2019re not taking me seriously! Let me tell you, if you keep being like this then one day you will fall into Xing Yue\u2019s hands! I suggest you come back to Gao Xing with me! On Five G.o.ds Mountain, no one will dare do anything to you!\u201dXiao Yao smiled and said nothing. Her dad was on Five G.o.ds Mountain but because her mom divorced her dad and she followed her mom to Cao Yun Peak, she always felt like her Dad, Consort Jing An, and Ah Nian was one complete family unit while she was the outsider. She felt more like family living with the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu.But Ah Nian was right, Zhuan Xu\u2019s home was about to get its mistress of the house and Xiao Yao\u2019s personality likely wouldn\u2019t win any favors with the new mistress.She used to think that no matter what happened, her Gege\u2019s home would always be her home. But this day arrived with the truth so sobering, her Gege\u2019s home was his home and she could stay for as long as she wanted but it was living under someone\u2019s roof. She would need to endure the owner\u2019s whims and avoid being disliked.Ah Nian saw Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t ready to go back and added \u201cIf you don\u2019t like living in Five G.o.ds Mountain and can\u2019t stay in Sheng Nong Mountain, then you only have another path left.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGet married! Marrying is the only way out for a woman, unless you want to go to Jade Mountain and be the next Royal Mother.\u201d Ah Nian sighed \u201cBut even if you got married it would be a problem. Feng Long lives in Zhi Yi and Zhuan Xu gege might even give him a residence on Sheng Nong Mountain. He\u2019s very sociable and is the Chi Sui clan leader and you are his wife so you need to know how to socialize. But you\u2026..you\u2019re socially awkward and don\u2019t know how to even dress. Now people are already mocking you behind your back about how much embarra.s.sing situations will arise in the future. If you don\u2019t get on the good side of the Empress, who knows how the days will be like for you down the road\u2026\u2026Sigh!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou stop it, I\u2019m already despondent and if you keep talking then I\u2019ll feel like my life is such an utter failure without any hope left.\u201dAh Nian burst out giggling \u201cI was feeling miserable but seeing you like this makes me feel like I\u2019m not as bad off as you.\u201dXiao Yao stood up \u201cGet some sleep! Tomorrow I\u2019ll go back to Five G.o.ds Mountain with you.\u201d\u201cEh? Why?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean why? I need to interact less with Xing Yue to maintain our past friends.h.i.+p. If we live in the same palace and ignore each other, the past friendly feelings will get wiped away and I\u2019ll start to get on her nerves. Best leave as soon as I can!\u201dAh Nian smiled \u201cSo you were listening to what I said earlier.\u201d\u201cYou have more experience than me in terms of being a woman in the palace. I ought to listen to you more.Ah Nian nodded \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201dXiao Yao left Ah Nian\u2019s residence and thought that she ought to say goodbye to Zhuan Xu tonight if she was leaving tomorrow. But she didn\u2019t even know which of his wive\u2019s residences he was in right now.Xiao Yao smiled wistfully, it really wasn\u2019t the same as before! She couldn\u2019t go find her Gege anytime she wanted.Xiao Yao sighed, time to go back! It doesn\u2019t matter when she said her farewells, tonight or tomorrow, if she was leaving anyway.Xiao Yao returned to her residence and laid down on her pallet but couldn\u2019t sleep. When she lost Jing she felt that she still had Zhuan Xu and no matter what happened she would never lose him.But tonight she felt for the first time that she was gradually losing Zhuan Xu.Years ago they held hands and walked up Cao Yun Peak, facing adversity that did not defeat them or make them give up on each other. But now they reached the end, there were so many things and people gradually forming between them that it naturally split them apart.It wasn\u2019t that one wanted to leave the other or the other stop caring, it was life being so merciless and unwittingly leading them to this point.Xiao Yao felt her heart constricting tightly so she sat up and took deep breaths. It started with being sleepless but over time she seemed to have developed a heart problem. She knew Xiang Liu was being bothered by her right now.All these years in the deep dark of the night, when she was at her most painful to endure moments, knowing someone was experiencing the same feeling made her feel she wasn\u2019t alone. It made her feel like he was right there keeping her company and it comforted her a lot.In the poison packages she sent him, she wrote in a letter apologizing for disturbing him and reminding him to go to Jiu Li with her when he had time. But Xiang Liu never replied and Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare mention it a second time.Xiao Yao clutched her heart and slowly laid back down. After laying for a long time, she slowly fell asleep.The next morning when Xiao Yao went to see the Yellow Emperor, Ah Nian and Zhuan Xu were both there.Ah Nian looked terrible, her eyes were still red and swollen likely having cried some more. Zhuan Xu also looked weary with dark circles under his eyes as if he didn\u2019t sleep a wink last night. Xiao Yao wanted to laugh and didn\u2019t realize that she also looked as bad.Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cI spoke with Grandfather and have decided to make Xing Yue my Empress.\u201dAh Nian quietly sat beside the Yellow Emperor and remained placid but not smiling. If Ah Nian didn\u2019t object then Xiao Yao had even less reason to object so she said \u201cFine!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao with his eyes blazing but Xiao Yao just smiled.Ah Nian said to Xiao Yao \u201cI already told Grandfather and said goodbye to Gege. We\u2019ll leave for in a bit for Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao said with a smile to Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor \u201cI haven\u2019t been back to see Dad in a long time so I plan to go with Ah Nian.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to go back and see your Dad.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cWhen will you be coming back?\u201dXiao Yao was taken aback, when will she be coming back? She really didn\u2019t think about it! Not like before when she knew she would becoming back to Zhuan Xu so she didn\u2019t take much with her when she left. This time she subconsciously knew she wasn\u2019t planning to come back so she told Shan Hu to pack everything.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cHaven\u2019t decided when to come back, let me spend some time with my Dad before deciding.\u201dWhen Xiao Yao went back to Gao Xing in the past she said the same thing but this time Zhuan Xu felt Xiao Yao\u2019s tone of voice was very dismissive. He wanted to press her more but with his grandfather and Ah Nian there he couldn\u2019t ask so he casually said \u201cFine.\u201d Zhuan Xu understood for the first time that the more nervous a person was, the more it was tucked deep inside.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t go back to handle his official matters and just kept Ah Nian and Xiao Yao company. Ah Nian was reluctant to leave and kept by Zhuan Xu\u2019s side while Xiao Yao attended to the Yellow Emperor and checked his vitals before reminding him of all the things he needed to pay attention to about his health.These past years with Xiao Yao tending to him and his cooperation, the Yellow Emperor\u2019s health had improved dramatically. If he remained cloistered away in Sheng Nong Mountain taking care of himself then he would have no problem living another few hundred years.Zhuan Xu summoned some snacks and dined with Xiao Yao and Ah Nian. After they finished was when Hai Tang came to report \u201cThe luggage is all packed, do the princesses want to depart now?\u201dXiao Yao and Ah Nian stood up and bowed to the Yellow Emperor who said to Zhuan Xu \u201cAfter you send them off go handle your affairs, no need to come back to see me.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dZhuan Xu accompanied Xiao Yao and Ah Nian to the cloud carriage. As they neared Zhuan Xu saw five large cloud carriages stuffed with luggage trailing behind the pa.s.senger one.Xiao Yao never used luggage carriages when she left so Zhuan Xu chuckled \u201cAh Nian, you sure have a lot of luggage, did you clean out your entire residence?\u201dAh Nian blinked a few times \u201cIt\u2019s not all mine.\u201dZhuan Xu turned and stared at Miao Pu who reported \u201cThree of the luggage carriages contain the Eldest Princess\u2019s luggage.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s expression shuttered so quickly Miao Pu was alarmed and immediately knelt down. Zhuan Xu calmed himself and turned back around with a smile \u201cXiao Yao, you come here, I have something to say to you.\u201dXiao Yao was already sitting in the cloud carriage with her eyes closed ready to nap so she yawned and walked out of the cloud carriage. Zhuan Xu pulled her to the side while she lazily asked \u201cWhat\u2019s so important?\u201dAh Nian stared curiously at them but Zhuan Xu placed a spell so she couldn\u2019t hear anything.Zhuan Xu asked Xiao Yao \u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it, I want to live with Dad for a bit and then think about coming back!\u201d Xiao Yao was perplexed, didn\u2019t he already ask her before?\u201cCan you come back in one month?\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d With the wedding discussions just underway, Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue\u2019s wedding couldn\u2019t be held in just one month.\u2019\u201cCan you come back in two months?\u201d\u201cProbably not.\u201d\u201cThree months?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cFour months?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dZhuan Xu actually went down the list of months one by one while Xiao Yao said a string of no, not likely, and probably nots.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cCan you come back in thirteen months?\u201dXiao Yao felt she couldn\u2019t say \u201cprobably not\u201d to that so slowly said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cFine, I\u2019ll send someone to fetch you in thirteen months.\u201dXiao Yao quickly added \u201cNo need, if I want to come back then I\u2019ll come back.\u201dZhuan Xu appeared to not hear what she said \u201cIn thirteen months, I\u2019ll send someone to fetch you back.\u201dWithout waiting for Xiao Yao\u2019s reply, he walked towards the cloud carriage ready to send her off.Xiao Yao walked over and muttered \u201cComing and going, I\u2019m already used to it, why need someone to come fetch me? What if thirteen months later I\u2019m not ready to come back, wouldn\u2019t that be a wasted trip? Whatever!\u201dZhuan Xu stopped and stared at Xiao Yao and it actually made her heart lurch so she quickly looked down.Zhuan Xu said \u201cIf you don\u2019t come back, I will go to Five G.o.ds Mountain to get you.\u201d And then he walked off in big fast strides.Since the dawn of time the Emperors never met each other. Even if the Grand Emperor was Zhuan Xu\u2019s master, now that Zhuan Xu was the ruler of a kingdom he still could not go to another kingdom. Xiao Yao wondered if she heard wrong and chased after Zhuan Xu \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dZhuan Xu shoved Xiao Yao into the cloud carriage and said to both girls \u201cDon\u2019t play too much on the way home and go straight to Five G.o.ds Mountain. Say h.e.l.lo to Master for me. Have a safe trip!\u201dZhuan Xu stepped back and said to the servants \u201cDepart!\u201dThe driver immediately whipped his winged horses which rose into the air.Xiao Yao and Ah Nian crowded around the window with Ah Nian waving frantically at Zhuan Xu as he waved back at them. It wasn\u2019t until he was gone from sight that Ah Nian turned back and looked very gleeful \u201cDid you get yelled at? I saw Gege was angry at you, why was he upset at you?\u201dXiao Yao laid down on the soft pillow \u201cMy mind is all jumbled, I\u2019m going to sleep for a bit.\u201d\u201cWhat do you do all night long then? Don\u2019t you sleep?\u201dXiao Yao sighed, she woke many times a night and even if she did sleep it wasn\u2019t soundly. She really wasn\u2019t resting enough so she just had to increase her resting hours.Ah Nian jabbered \u201cHey, I\u2019m talking to you!\u201dXiao Yao placed a handkerchief over her face indicating don\u2019t bother me, I\u2019m asleep!________________________________A month and a half later, the Xuan Yuan Emperor Zhuan Xu married the direct descendant of the Sheng Nong royal family Sheng Nong Xing Yue as his Empress.The wedding was lavish as the nation celebrated for three days. This wedding officially announced the true merging of the Xuan Yuan tribe led by the Yellow Emperor and the Sheng Nong tribe led by the former Flame Emperors.At the wedding Xing Yue wore all red as the custom of the Sheng Nong tribe, but Zhuan Xu did not wear all yellow as was the custom of the Xuan Yuan tribe. He instead wore all black embroidered with gold thread.No one knew why Zhuan Xu did this but the all black was imposing and regal so it quickly made black fas.h.i.+onable among the younger set. Feng Long and his friends a.s.sumed it was to differentiate Zhuan Xu from the still alive Yellow Emperor and they started calling him the Black Emperor. After Zhuan Xu heard that he said \u201cI was worried about what my official moniker would be but this will do, from now on I\u2019ll be the Black Emperor.\u201dFrom then on the official designation of the Black Emperor was created.Three days after the wedding, Zhuan Xu announced an official decree encouraging intermarriage between the Sheng Nong families and the Xuan Yuan families. He would reward any intermarriages and even put to greater use the sons from those families.Initially the two tribes were not very keen to get close to each other but after the capital move and with the pa.s.sage of time, the interactions naturally increased and gradually the intermarriages started happening more and more.No matter the opposition in the past, once the bloodlines were mixed and offspring were born, even two grandfathers from formerly enemy tribes softened when staring at their mutual adorable grandchild.There was still a long ways to go before the two tribes would fully be integrated but Zhuan Xu had taken the first successful step forward. Perhaps tens of thousands of years later, when the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu were no longer around, the vast wilderness would have no Sheng Nong tribe or Xuan Yuan tribe and all that remained was the bloodline mixed descendants of both tribes.___________________________With half the vast wilderness celebrating the marriage of the Xuan Yuan Emperor and Empress, even Gao Xing was affected. The songs being sang in the tea houses are all celebrating the marriage and everyone who heard it was happy except for Xiao Yao and Ah Nian.Xiao Yao started to really understand what Ah Nian said, the Empress was not like the other women. In the past it didn\u2019t matter who Zhuan Xu married, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t feel anything. She saw Ah Nian and Xing Yue tussling but it didn\u2019t involve her because she would always be Zhuan Xu\u2019s little sister no matter who he married. But this time she really felt Zhuan Xu belonged to someone else, even if she was his little sister she couldn\u2019t be by his side anymore. From now on, it was Xing Yue who would be happy when he was happy and sad when he was sad. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t lay under the moonlight with him chatting or when she got sick he couldn\u2019t sleep in the outside room all night keeping her company.Xiao Yao had no choice but to admit that Xing Yue stole the person she was closest with.Xiao Yao confided her sadness to Ah Nian but Ah Nian didn\u2019t pity her and instead said \u201cEven you have this day.\u201d After she mocked Xiao Yao was when Ah Nian felt even worse, in the past she felt Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu\u2019s closeness gave her a leg up over all the other women, but now even Xiao Yao felt like Xing Yue stole Zhuan Xu, wouldn\u2019t that mean she was even further from Zhuan Xu from now on?___________________________Xiao Yao still couldn\u2019t sleep well at night so she rose well past noon. After dining she would go to Qi Qing Garden not to swim but just to sit in a daze staring at the water in the pool.One evening the Grand Emperor walked into Qi Qing Garden and saw Xiao Yao sitting in a daze next to the water. It was already dark out and with Xiao Yao\u2019s low powers she couldn\u2019t be able to see in the dark.The Grand Emperor asked \u201cYou stare at the water every day deep in thought. It\u2019s been a few months, you have any conclusions?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI was thinking about when I was small and how my mom loved me so. If she loved me so much, why did she still abandon me for the greater good of the world? She couldn\u2019t bear to see other kids lose their parents, but she allowed me to lose my mom. I\u2019ve been thinking that had she not abandoned me and watched me grow up, what would I be like? Will my personality not be as weird? Will I be happier than I am now?The Grand Emperor said \u201cXiao Yao, you\u2019re being swallowed up by your own insecurity. If it\u2019s because of that Tu Shan clan little fox, I\u2019ll go s.n.a.t.c.h him for you.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cDad, are you forgetting I already have a fiancee?\u201dThe Grand Emperor was taken aback and then said \u201cI\u2019ll write to Chi Sui Feng Long to have him come keep you company.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSure, tell him to come see me!\u201dLike Zhuan Xu said, the cure for a sadness is to fill up the void again and use happiness to smooth over the pain. Actually the best way to heal from losing a lover was to find a new lover, but Feng Long\u2026..his lover was his vast ambition.Feng Long received the letter from the Grand Emperor and traveled day and night to come see Xiao Yao. He spent a day and a half with her before traveling all night back to the Middle Plains.The Grand Emperor wanted to say something to Feng Long but saw that he did drop everything to come be with Xiao Yao. He was also going back to handle important matters and not to booze and play around. Feng Long did nothing wrong by putting his career first so the Grand Emperor could only sigh.Xiao Yao told her dad she didn\u2019t want to live on Five G.o.ds Mountain anymore but he wouldn\u2019t let her leave. The father-daughter fight ended in a compromise, Xiao Yao left Cheng En Court and went to Ying Province Island.In the past Xiao Yao was always in ready-to-fight mode as she earnestly learned her poisons and practiced her archery. After losing Jing and seeing Zhuan Xu ascend the throne, she had nothing left to lose and nothing left to protect. Xiao Yao deflated entirely and gave up her archery and didn\u2019t study poisons other than to make poisons for Xiang Liu.She had a lot of free time now and to pa.s.s the time she opened a medical clinic on the island. It was normal to have female doctors in the vast wilderness but Xiao Yao always wore a veil so it was hard for patients to trust her which is why her clinic had very few patients.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t mind, every day after lunch she would open the doors to see patients with Shan Hu waiting in the front while Xiao Yao was in the back reading medical texts and studying herbs.Sometimes a few poor patients would come by since they couldn\u2019t afford the other clinics. They tried out Xiao Yao\u2019s treatment and discovered it work so gradually more patients came. But it was always the poor fisherman from the area and sometimes they even paid her in fresh caught fish.Xiao Yao would then cook the fish for Shan Hu and Miao Pu and both girls found their mouths watering to discover the Princess cooked fish as good as the royal chefs!This type of ordinary life went on day after day until Xiao Yao forgot how much time pa.s.sed. Then the person sent by Zhuan Xu arrived to fetch her and she realized thirteen months had pa.s.sed. But she didn\u2019t want to go back. In the past she accompanied him because the road was dangerous and no one else would walk with him but her.Now he was the ruler of a kingdom with the bravest men following him and the most beautiful women by his side. His grand ambitions were slowly taking shape. And she was tired and wanted to live only this ordinary life and didn\u2019t want to face the ups and downs that affected countless lives.Xiao Yao wrote a letter and had the servant bring it to Zhuan Xu. She waited a few days and saw Zhuan Xu had no response and took that as his consent for her not to go back. She let out a sigh of relief and went back to living her boring life.A few days later, a fisherman brought Xiao Yao a basket of fresh caught sea urchin at her request. She had discovered new herbs not catalogued in the Sheng Nong Herb Manual \u2013 when the Flame Emperor was writing it he lived inland so didn\u2019t have a lot of access to herbs in the sea. Xiao Yao discovered new herbs from the ocean after talking to the fishermen and hearing their own concoctions and sea urchin was one such new find.Xiao Yao pulled up her sleeve and started cleaning the sea urchin, the meat could be eaten tonight while the sh.e.l.l would be dried and turned into good medicine.The courtyard door opened and a person walked in.Xiao Yao had her hands full so didn\u2019t lift her head \u201cGo wait in the front if you are here to see the doctor.\u201dThe person said nothing and also made no move to leave.Xiao Yao raised her head and saw it was Zhuan Xu and was so startled her knife slipped and cut her finger.\u201cIs it serious?\u201d Zhuan Xu hurriedly asked.Xiao Yao pressed down on her bleeding finger \u201cWhy are you here? Are you crazy?\u201d\u201cLet me see it.\u201dXiao Yao handed her hand to Zhuan Xu and said \u201cI\u2019m fine! You\u2019re the one in danger!\u201dZhuan Xu used his handkerchief and water to clean the wound and then took out pills which he crushed over the wound and the blood stopped. Xiao Yao asked \u201cWho knows you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cIf you leave with me right now, not many people will know. If you don\u2019t leave with me right now, I don\u2019t know who will find out. Maybe\u2026..the entire vast wilderness!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..are you threatening me? Are you using my worry for your safety?\u201d Xiao Yao asked in disbelief.Zhuan Xu raised an eyebrow and thought about what she said before replying \u201cYes, I am putting myself in danger to pressure you.\u201dZhuan Xu was being such a b.a.s.t.a.r.d right now! When Xiao Yao lived in the market place she was also used to being a b.a.s.t.a.r.d so now she was ready to see who was more unreasonable! Xiao Yao said \u201cI don\u2019t believe that if I don\u2019t leave with you then you won\u2019t go back! Stay if you want!\u201d Xiao Yao sat back down and resumed cleaning the sea urchin.Zhuan Xu kicked a wooden stool over and pulled his sleeves up and sat down to help Xiao Yao clean the sea urchin. He didn\u2019t even need a paring knife and with a light squeeze of his hand he pulled out the meat cleanly. He also spent plenty of time down in the market places with the ruffians and right now it was two equally stubborn b.a.s.t.a.r.ds b.u.t.ting heads. The one that was more ruthless was going to win.Zhuan Xu cleaned the sea urchin and discussed with Xiao Yao how to eat it. He lived in Gao Xing for two hundred years and knew way more about how to prepare seafood. Xiao Yao was in a daze, Zhuan Xu always gave in to her and she never opposed his wishes. This was the first time in their lives where they b.u.t.ted heads and Xiao Yao actually didn\u2019t know what to do.The two finished cleaning the sea urchin and Zhuan Xu helped Xiao Yao wash the sh.e.l.ls.A patient arrived and Xiao Yao put on a veiled hat and ran out to see the patient all while praying that Zhuan Xu would be gone by the time she got back.When she got back, Zhuan Xu was still there and cutting firewood for her.It was getting dark and Zhuan Xu headed to the kitchen to start dinner. Xiao Yao stood in the courtyard as stiff as a wooden board and so was Miao Pu and Shan Hu. After half an hour Zhuan Xu called out \u201cDinnertime!\u201dMiao Pu awoke from her daze and ran into the kitchen to bring out the dishes. Gao Xing was warm all year round so most families dined outside in the courtyard. Miao Pu wiped down the table and set it with the dishes and utensils.Zhuan Xu called out \u201cYou guys come in and eat as well.Almost ten of Zhuan Xu\u2019s personal guards filed in and Miao Pu handed them each a bowl of food and each took it silently and went to the corner to eat.Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cLet\u2019s sit down and eat!\u201dHe prepared a bowl for Xiao Yao and she silently ate from it. He placed a piece of sea urchin in her bowl \u201cTry it.\u201dXiao Yao ate it but couldn\u2019t taste anything.After dinner Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t appear to be planning to leave. He told Miao Pu to prepare bedding for him and he started heating water in the kitchen to run a bath.Xiao Yao finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and asked \u201cAre you really doing this?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cDo you think I traveled thousands of miles to Five G.o.ds Mountain to come play around with you?\u201dXiao Yao knew she had to be ruthless to win but she couldn\u2019t play around with Zhuan Xu\u2019s personal safety so she tossed in the towel and angrily said \u201cI\u2019ll go with you! But you remember that I didn\u2019t go willingly!\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing and with the wave of his hand all the fires in the kitchen went out. He walked out and called \u201cBack to Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dMiao Pu shot out from the room like an arrow with a bag already in hand \u201cPrincess, your belongings are all packed.\u201dXiao Yao glared at her \u201cTraitor!\u201dMiao Pu lowered her head.Zhuan Xu\u2019s winged ride descended and he vaulted on before reaching his hand out to Xiao Yao. She ignored him and walked to another guard \u201cI\u2019ll ride with you.\u201d The guard glanced at Zhuan Xu who nodded so he let Xiao Yao on \u201cPrincess, please hold tightly to the swallow\u2019s neck.\u201dThe winged rides all rose into the air and disappeared into the clouds.Suddenly Ru So appeared out of nowhere on his winged ride to escort them though each checkpoint until the convoy left Five G.o.ds Mountain. Zhuan Xu thanked Ru So who looked exhausted \u201cCan I beg of you not to come back ever again! If you miss me that much I\u2019ll go visit you. Whoever you want to see, other than His majesty, I\u2019ll kidnap that person and bring to you!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and waved his hand and the entire convoy took off.Ru So muttered \u201cIf I knew you were such a b.a.s.t.a.r.d, back then I would have rather been beaten to death by my dad than to learn martial arts with you!\u201d Ru So sighed and headed back to report to the Grand Emperor that the task was done.______________________________Rus.h.i.+ng through the night the convoy safely returned to Sheng Nong Mountain.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t take Xiao Yao to Zhi Jin Summit but instead took her to Xiao Yue Peak. Zhuan Xu explained \u201cGrandfather moved to Xiao Yue Peak now so you ought to live closer to him.\u201dXiao Yao relaxed knowing she wouldn\u2019t have to see Xing Yue often \u201cI heard Xiao Yue Peak has a medicine canyon. It\u2019s where the Flame Emperor lived for many years, is that where Grandfather is living now?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIt\u2019s there.\u201dBefore the winged ride landed Xiao Yao could already see the entire ground blanketed with fire red phoenix flowers. Xiao Yao gasped \u201cYou planted phoenix trees here as well?\u201d\u201cYes, years ago I thought this peak was very nice and maybe you would want to live here one day so planted the trees here as well.\u201dXiao Yao got off the winged ride and walked in a daze through the phoenix tree forest, it was just like the trees on Cao Yun Peak. Xiao Yao reached out and caught a falling petal and put it in her mouth to suck out the honey which was just as sweet as the flowers on Cao Yun Peak.From Cao Yun Peak to Xiao Yue Peak, after tens of thousands of days and nights, she finally saw the phoenix flower again.Xiao Yao handed a phoenix flower to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou did it!\u201dZhuan Xu took it \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, we did it!\u201dZhuan Xu tucked the phoenix flower in Xiao Yao\u2019s hair and pulled her behind him towards the inner reaches of the forest. Deep inside the forest there was a huge phoenix tree with a swing dangling on it that could seat two people and appeared to be silently awaiting its owner.Xiao Yao smiled and felt her heart ache. When she was small she asked her mom to fasten a bigger swing so she could swing with Zhuan Xu but her mom was so busy taking care of her grandmother and raising her and Zhuan Xu. So her mom could only put a small swing in the courtyard but today the big swing was finally a reality but there was no one remaining who could watch her swing with Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu read her thoughts and lightly hugged her \u201cWe can see it.\u201dXiao Yao nodded.\u201cWant to swing?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cLet\u2019s go see Grandfather first.\u201dZhuan Xu led Xiao Yao out of the phoenix forest and through a river walk until they entered a vast canyon. There were a few wooden huts inside the canyon and more phoenix trees planted outside. Nine-colored deer munched on gra.s.s outside while there was a farm plot behind the hut where the Yellow Emperor was currently tending with a hoe with his pant legs folded up.Zhuan Xu said \u201cThis path here isn\u2019t very convenient so you should take another path which is ringed with blue flowers as it winds through a flower valley.\u201dXiao Yao walked into the plot and looked down at the medicinal herbs and complimented the Yellow Emperor \u201cIt\u2019s growing well.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cWhen I was small, to find food to eat I hunted and farmed. It was a long time ago but the things one learned in childhood seeps into the bones and no matter how much time pa.s.ses one can never forget.\u201dXiao Yao stared at the Yellow Emperor with his feet covered in mud and his face much darker but his energy was better as well so she smiled \u201cI don\u2019t need to take your pulse and can tell you\u2019re doing well.\u201d\u201cThe earth is not like people, to interact with people is taxing and draining but to interact with the earth is rejuvenating and refres.h.i.+ng. Of course I\u2019m doing better.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYes, you put in the effort in the earth and will get back the same rewards. But with people it\u2019s impossible to tell.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor left the plot and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cYou hurry back, even with Xiao Xiao using the fox dummy as your subst.i.tute but the women you married are not easily fooled.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m headed back now.\u201d Zhuan Xu bowed to the Yellow Emperor and stared at Xiao Yao before leaving.Xiao Yao was shocked \u201cYou knew about it? And you allowed Zhuan Xu to be so irresponsible?\u201d\u201cWhat can I do? He\u2019s an adult now so am I supposed to truss him up so he can\u2019t leave. If I help him then at least he\u2019ll discuss it with me and if something happens I can intervene. If I object he\u2019ll still do it.\u201dXiao Yao had nothing to say to that because it was all true.Shan Hu and Miao Pu stood to the side and the Yellow Emperor pointed to the other huts \u201cYou guys pick whichever!\u201dThe maids went to unpack and Xiao Yao started to live in Xiao Yue Peak._______________________________That night Zhuan Xu actually came again.Xiao Yao was still p.i.s.sed at him so just ignored him. Zhuan Xu smiled happily and coaxed Xiao Yao who sniped back \u201cUse your method of b.u.t.tering up women on someone else! It doesn\u2019t work on me.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s smiles disappeared and he just stared at Xiao Yao with sadness in his eyes.Xiao Yao ended up losing her frustration with him and asked wearily \u201cWhat else do you want? I\u2019ve come back with you, do you need me to apologize to you?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s sleeve \u201cIf you know you can\u2019t run away, then don\u2019t try to run away again.\u201dXiao Yao huffed \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to run away, if I was then I would run somewhere you would have no reach.\u201dZhuan Xu grinned \u201cThen I\u2019ll conquer that place and make it mine.\u201d\u201cSuch bold words! There is a place in this world that doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cThen I will make the entire world belong to me, so that no matter where you run to I can always bring you back.\u201dXiao Yai was doubled over laughing \u201cFine, fine, the entire world belongs to you.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was coming back from a walk and heard this pair of young ones talking and stared at Zhuan Xu. He sighed inside, the person talking meant one thing but the person listening didn\u2019t get the true meaning.The Yellow Emperor walked over and Xiao Yao squeezed closer to Zhuan Xu to make room for him. Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s sleeve and twisted it around his finger while Xiao Yao smiled and tried to pull it back. Grab and pull, the two of them went back and forth until Xiao Yao complained \u201cGrandfather, you see what Gege is doing!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled and opened his palm to hand what looked like half a duck egg to Zhuan Xu. He picked it up and appeared to remember something \u201cThe River Portrait Book?\u201d He heard of it when he was small but this was the first time he saw it.The Yellow Emperor nodded.Xiao Yao squeezed over to look and Zhuan Xu handed it to her. She couldn\u2019t see anything interesting about it other other it looking like half a jade egg but seemed to have constellations on top of it.Zhuan Xu explained \u201cLegend has it this contains the greatest secret of the universe but it can\u2019t be unlocked until the two halves are placed together to form one complete jade egg.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhere is the other half?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said nothing as did Zhuan Xu.Xiao Yao thought it was a Xuan Yuan state secret so didn\u2019t press on and returned the half egg to Zhuan Xu \u201cI\u2019ll go tidy up and then off to bed.\u201dZhuan Xu saw Xiao Yao walk off and then formed a blocking spell while the Yellow Emperor waited for him to speak first. Zhuan Xu finally spoke \u201cThere is something I can\u2019t confirm. Since I ascended the throne I\u2019ve been investigating Xiao Yao\u2019s birth secret but the more I investigate the more confusing it is. I\u2019ve even begun to believe in the rumors. Grandfather, who is Xiao Yao\u2019s dad?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cYour Auntie never confessed the truth to me but I think\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao\u2019s dad is Qi Yo.\u201dSuspicion and confirmation are two different things and Zhuan Xu took time to absorb this before murmuring \u201cDoes Master know? Auntie divorced him so he couldn\u2019t have not known\u2026.but why\u2026.why is he so good to Xiao Yao to the point I never once doubted. Doesn\u2019t he know?\u201d\u201cPerhaps he didn\u2019t know in the beginning but the moment he saw Xiao Yao\u2019s real face he must know. Qi Yo had the most beautiful expressive eyes and Xiao Yao inherited his best feature. Her eyes are identical to Qi Yo and even her forehead area is very similar.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cBut Master genuinely loves Xiao Yao very much.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cI once suspected he had ulterior motives but now I\u2019m not the ruler anymore and stop looking at everything from a calculating wary perspective, I feel like he really has no other reason but that he loves her. It may be his guilt and regret at work.\u201d From Qing Yang\u2019s death to Chang Yi\u2019s death, and even Qi Yo\u2019s death, the Grand Emperor was well aware of what he did to lead up to it.Zhuan Xu looked down at the half jade egg in his hand and said nothing.After a moment he said \u201cIt\u2019s actually good Xiao Yao is not the Grand Emperor\u2019s daughter. I actually feel a bit of relief!\u201d\u201cDo you want to let Xiao Yao know?\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t answer that question and said \u201cWhat matters if the entire world knows she\u2019s Qi Yo\u2019s daughter? No matter how many people Qi Yo killed and how many people hate her now because of it, I have tens of thousands of guards ready to protect her.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as you think.\u201dZhuan Xu stood up \u201cGrandfather get some rest. I want to go check on Xiao Yao and then head back.\u201dZhuan Xu walked into the wood hut and saw Xiao Yao laying on the pallet flipping through geography books. He asked \u201cWhy the sudden interest in that?\u201d\u201cI learned that the earth can grow herbs to heal and can also add to wisdom and introduce new things.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cI\u2019ll order all such books collected here\u00a0for you to read that you can\u2019t even get to all of them for your entire life.\u201dXiao Yao pouted \u201cYou\u2019re such a b.a.s.t.a.r.d!\u201dShe put down on her book and turned over \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201dZhuan Xu closed her seash.e.l.l night light but didn\u2019t leave and squatted down next to her pallet \u201cAre you still angry at me?\u201d\u201cGege, you don\u2019t need me anymore.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, now I only don\u2019t need your help anymore. In the past I was your Gege but relied on you, from now on you can rely on me.\u201d Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cWhatever Master can give you, I can give you. You can live on Five G.o.ds Mountain but you can also live on Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and decided to satisfy the dreams of a man who finally accomplished his goal.She said \u201cFine, I\u2019ll stay but just to be clear, if I cause you headaches and embarra.s.sment then don\u2019t blame me.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t have any social graces or learned arts and the scene in Sheng Nong Mountain and Zhi Yi Castle was getting more and more complicated as was the people around Zhuan Xu.He smiled \u201cI\u2019m waiting for that day to arrive.\u201dXiao Yao pushed him and said \u201cI sleep until past noon while you have to get up first thing in the morning. Hurry back to rest!\u201dZhuan Xu fixed her blanket before softly saying \u201cI\u2019m off, I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to see you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUgh, I love this slow and delicate chapter of Lost You Forever way too much. So little action but so much richness in important details. Xiao Yao moves back to Sheng Nong Mountain and finds her true calling after a walk down memory lane. She reads the former Flame Emperor\u2019s medical journals and really understands what being a healer means and that motivates her to become a doctor in spirit as well as in skill. Xiao Yao will never know that her own mother actually met the Flame Emperor in the last days of his life and he pa.s.sed on his life\u2019s work to her. Not to mention the former Flame Emperor being platonic best friends with Xiao Yao\u2019s grandmother Empress Lei Zhu as well as Xiao Yao\u2019s master the Royal Mother. It\u2019s so apropos that Xiao Yao carries the mantle now. Medicine becomes also her distraction from the surreal quality of her life, engaged to Feng Long but doesn\u2019t love him, recovering from Jing\u2019s broken promise which felt like pouring salt on her lacking in trust heart, and wondering what the heck is really between her and Xiang Liu.Okay, she doesn\u2019t ever wonder but she does something that I\u2019m so happy to see from a girl who never ever wants to take the first step and make the first overture. She sends Xiang Liu the most obvious and undeniable message of what is in her heart towards him. She pleads wordlessly for him to take her hand, for him to take her away from it all, for them to forget that he\u2019s the General of the Sheng Nong resistance army and she\u2019s the cousin of Emperor Zhuan Xu. Even with everything she went through with Jing, he was always the one who made the effort, the one who bared his heart to her, the one who extracted a promise from her. For the first time we see Xiao Yao dare ever so little to hope. My heart bleeds for her as it does for all the male leads in this novel. Who will be the one to break free of their fate and find long lasting happiness? I don\u2019t know but can\u2019t my woobies stop hurting me so much with their inner angst? I don\u2019t know how I can translate through the tears to come.Chapter 31 \u2013 Chasing Past Memories, Empty Hopes and Disappointed Visage:Life on Xiao Yue Summit was very languid and lazy.Zhuan Xu said Sheng Nong Mountain was the same as Five G.o.ds Mountain but that wasn\u2019t true. Five G.o.ds Mountain had no memories but Sheng Nong Mountain, Zhi Yi, Zhe Province, it all had lots of memories in each place.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know if she purposely didn\u2019t want to face the past or really was lazy, but she didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. When Zhuan Xu suggested she open a medical clinic like she did on Five G.o.ds Mountain, Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t interested.Every day Xiao Yao woke up after noon and then flipped through her medical books. Only when making poisons did she perk up slightly.The Yellow Emperor saw her so withdrawn and suggested \u201cThat boy from the Fang Feng family, his name is Fang Feng Bei, right? I see you guys get along well, how come he hasn\u2019t come play with you these past few years? You can ask him to hang out together.\u201dIt was better the Yellow Emperor not mention that because afterwards Xiao Yao got even more uninterested even in making poisons. She spent every day sitting in a daze in the corridor.One day the Yellow Emperor summoned Xiao Yao and took her into a wooden hut. It was spa.r.s.ely\u00a0decorated with only a jade box on the pallet that caught the eye. The Yellow Emperor said \u201cThis was the residence of the former Flame Emperor.\u201dShe knew which former Flame Emperor he was referring to but couldn\u2019t help but confirm \u201cThe Flame Emperor that is regarded as the founder of medicine?\u201d\u201cYes, the one who wrote the Sheng Nong Herb Manual, that Flame Emperor.\u201dEven though she never met him, Xiao Yao remained curious about him after memorizing the manual so she quietly looked around the hut.The Yellow Emperor walked up to the pallet and pointed to the jade box \u201cThis contains all the notes written by the Flame Emperor when he was doing his medical research. You can read it.\u201dXiao Yao wasn\u2019t very interested and murmured \u201cSure.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor added \u201cWhether he was still alive or after he died, the entire world respects the Flame Emperor more than me. After uniting the Middle Plains and to sooth the people\u2019s will I had no choice but to venerate him, but in truth I never felt he was worthy until I settled at Xiao Yue Summit and chanced upon his handwritten notes. After reading it carefully I finally conceded that I could never match up to him. At least the me of the past couldn\u2019t! Xiao Yao, I have only ever respected myself, the Flame Emperor is the only other person I ever respected and admired in my life.\u201dXiao Yao stared in shock at the Yellow Emperor, unable to believe that such an ambitious, brave, and proud Yellow Emperor could have just said that.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cThe Sheng Nong Herb Manual is something you\u2019ve long memorized but no matter how much you know it front to back\u00a0you have never truly understood it. Don\u2019t look at me like that, after you read it then you\u2019ll understand what I mean.\u201dXiao Yao opened the box and picked up the first scroll and started reading.Once she started she was mesmerized and didn\u2019t even know when the Yellow Emperor left.From morning until evening, from evening until morning, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t sleep or eat and just kept on reading.The notes started with the Flame Emperor writing that he personally tested hundreds of plants and herbs to understand what its effects were. He discovered that he was being poisoned by the testing so he started to cure himself with antidotes.The Flame Emperor carefully wrote down in detail every type of medicine he took.He\u00a0needed to catalog the effects of each medicine before and after, and then carefully write down how it affected him after he took it: weakness, pain, deafness, vomiting, spasms, heart murmurs, seizures, frothing at the mouth\u2026..The notes were detailed and calm without a shred of emotion. Xiao Yao read in it the cold stark words but knew behind it was real pain that a body had to endure. In the beginning Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand why the person who could write the Sheng Nong Herb Manual didn\u2019t know how to lesson his own pain? But the more she read led her to understand that he knew how but didn\u2019t want to help himself. He wanted to give the people of the world a manual that listed the first reaction to a plant or herb exactly as it was ingested.Until the end, when the Flame Emperor knew there was no cure for his poisoned body, he still used his body to test all sorts of medicines not to cure himself but to catalog more and more to leave behind.This could cure heart attacks but would leave nerve damage; that can lessen retching but will cause sleeplessness; that could help bodily pain but might lead to blindness\u2026..In these cold words, how deep was the love for the world, how magnanimous was the sacrifice, how brave and resilient was the determination.An Emperor for the ages was willing to endure such pain and agony just to leave behind knowledge to help the humans lesson pain. But the lifespan of the G.o.ds was so long that to devote it to experiencing agony willingly required how vast a heart full of courage.These notes were just a portion of what the Flame Emperor wrote but contained some plants not included in the Manual itself likely because he didn\u2019t have time to test it repeatedly to confirm. The knowledge included in the Manual was so detailed and precise, how much repeated testing did it take to create one such Sheng Nong Herb Manual?After Xiao Yao finished reading the handwritten notes she sat there in a daze for some time before finally leaving the hut.The Yellow Emperor stared at her quietly and she said \u201cI was wrong! I never truly read and understood the Sheng Nong Herb Manual!\u201d In the past she heard people talking about how the Manual was the life\u2019s work of the Flame Emperor but she never truly comprehended what that meant. Now she understood that what she had casually learned was not just a medical text but the blood and guts of an Emperor\u2019s entire life.The Yellow Emperor nodded \u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, how will you fix it?\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t have an answer.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cThe Flame Emperor didn\u2019t have time to collect his final notes. He likely doesn\u2019t care whether I am venerating him during official prayer ceremonies, if I could present the world with the final collection from his notes and help the people, it would be the best tribute to him. But I don\u2019t know medicine.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor took his hoe and headed for the fields.Xiao Yao sat down crossed legged and slowly contemplated.Zhuan Xu came in the evening and she said to him \u201cI want to learn medicine.\u201dZhuan Xu was perplexed \u201cDon\u2019t you already know medicine?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI learned my accident.\u201d She learned by trying to poison people and lacked the fundamentals. She didn\u2019t even know how to treat the most basic ailments so she could never be considered a real doctor.When Xiao Yao was running the medical clinic in Yin Province she actually discovered this limitation but she didn\u2019t care to fix it. She never intended to help the people of the world with her healing so if there were ailments she couldn\u2019t treat then another doctor could deal with it. But now she faced her limitations and decided to conquer it. She wanted to forget everything she learned and start learning medicine from scratch.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cHow do you want to learn medicine? Want me to order Dr. Zhen to teach you?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cRight now I\u2019m not worthy of him teaching me.\u201d\u201cWhatever you want to do, I will support you.\u201dThere were medical schools in Zhi Yi Castle so Zhuan Xu ordered royal physicians to take turns teaching courses there. Xiao Yao covered her face with a veiled hat and pretended to be a regular medical student and started learning medicine from the bare basics.Xiao Yao stopped sleeping in and got up early every day to take cla.s.ses at the medical school. The Yellow Emperor also got up early every day and went to tend the fields and read up on medical texts. One old, one young, the days pa.s.sed peacefully on Xiao Yue Summit.Every day Zhuan Xu would come have dinner with them rain or s.h.i.+ne. After years of testing Zhuan Xu finally understood that the Yellow Emperor had let everything go with no intention of ever going back to rule. Zhuan Xu also gained experience with ruling\u00a0Xuan Yuan and didn\u2019t need his advice as much so he stopped telling the Yellow Emperor every detail of what went on in court and only shared the critical issues with him.Most of the time Zhuan Xu never talked about politics or Zhi Jin Palace. He discussed the land with the Yellow Emperor and asked Xiao Yao what she learned today, the new friends she made in cla.s.s, or whether anything interesting happened.Sometimes Zhuan Xu would linger after dinner to accompany Xiao Yao to swing or help her do little ch.o.r.es or even take a walk with her in the phoenix tree forest.Xiao Yao felt nothing changed between her and Zhuan Xu, he was still her closest person. But everything was still not the same. He never let her go to Zhi Jin Palace so she felt that he placed her outside of his normal daily life. But Xiao Yao didn\u2019t have a problem with that since he didn\u2019t need her anymore now.__________________________________Winter left and Summer came, time pa.s.sed swiftly and Xiao Yao had been learning medicine for two years in the medical school.One afternoon Xiao Yao walked out of the school and found Feng Long waiting for her. She smiled \u201cHow come you have time today?\u201d Feng Long smiled \u201cI\u2019ll take you back.\u201dIn the last two years, when Feng Long was in Zhi Yi Castle he would find time to visit Xiao Yao in Xiao Yue Summit and also chat with the Yellow Emperor. After Zhuan Xu arrived the four of them would then have dinner together.Xing Yue only visited once after Xiao Yao came to Xiao Yue Summit. Due to the Yellow Emperor, everyone avoided Xiao Yue Summit, especially Xing Yue. She was a hostage in Xuan Yuan Castle from birth so the Yellow Emperor represented the spectre of death to her. Her fear of him was ingrained since childhood so even if she was now the Empress of Xuan Yuan and the Yellow Emperor could not harm her anymore, she still felt very awkward whenever she saw him. So she intentionally avoided it and if she had her way she would have sent the Yellow Emperor back to Xuan Yuan Mountain already.In her one and only visit, Xing Yue was very formal and stayed only briefly before departing.Feng Long was vastly different than Xing Yue, he was taken at birth by the Chi Sui clan leader and grew up in his grandfather\u2019s protective care without any worry. After he grew up he understood that the Yellow Emperor caused his family to be split into three places but by such time it was already over. He might\u2019ve been angry before but he didn\u2019t blame the Yellow Emperor anymore nor was he scared of him. He was actually rather in awe of him, the type of feeling a man with great ambition would have for another who succeeded. Like a beast\u2019s natural admiration for another powerful beast.The other government officials\u00a0were wary so kept their distance from the Yellow Emperor to avoid the awkwardness of one nation with two rulers and lead to Zhuan Xu\u2019s suspicion of their allegiance. Feng Long was as smart as any when it came to politics yet with this he was completely candid and forthright, he never avoided the Yellow Emperor and even used Xiao Yao to spend more time with him. He liked to talk with the Yellow Emperor, to learn from him the historical events that the Yellow Emperor lived through and had greater understanding of. Feng Long wanted to learn such wisdom and knowledge from an elder, such an opportunity people dreamed of and might never experience once, but because of Xiao Yao he had many opportunities.Xiao Yao and Feng Long returned to Xiao Yue Summit and Feng Long immediately ran off to find the Yellow Emperor. He excitedly used his water power to draw a map to show the army formations and discussed the attack strategy with the Yellow Emperor who listened patiently. When Feng Long was done talking, the Yellow Emperor swapped a few formations and Feng Long was rendered dumbstruck. He furrowed his brows in deep thought and then excitedly bowed to the Yellow Emperor in appreciation.Xiao Yao sighed and shook her head, she wondered if Feng Long was visiting her not because he missed his fiancee but because he missed the Yellow Emperor. She ignored that pair of young and old and went to the dummy to practice her acupuncture.Zhuan Xu arrived to find Feng Long and the Yellow Emperor still discussing army strategy and he listened for a bit before walking over to watch Xiao Yao poking needles.Likely she practiced archery for so many years, she integrated the technique into her acupuncture so the way she wielded needles was very different than other doctors.Even though it was just a dummy, Xiao Yao treated it as a real person so she didn\u2019t dare slack off and was covered in sweat after her practice session. Zhuan Xu handed her a handkerchief to wipe her face and tenderly said \u201cThere are many doctors in the palace, why are you spending time learning such detailed skills?\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cIf I work hard during the day I can sleep better at night.\u201d\u201cIs your sleeplessness better?\u201d\u201cSince starting to learn medicine, it\u2019s gotten a lot better.\u201d She still had a hard time falling asleep but she woke up less during the night. Because she slept better, her heart pain problem also lessened.Zhuan Xu\u2019s expression was conflicted \u2013 Xiao Yao\u2019s illness was caused by Jing and she never mentioned him now, but after so many years she still hadn\u2019t forgotten him.Feng Long saw Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao chatting in front of the dummy and called over \u201cYour majesty, can you work a little harder please? Can\u2019t you see me discussing army strategy with your grandfather over here? Of course with me around you\u2019ll never end up on the battlefield, but you should come learn it!\u201dZhuan Xu walked over and moved the formations and immediately destroyed Feng Long\u2019s side. Feng Long stared slack-jawed in disbelief.Zhuan Xu scoffed \u201cSince I was small I was already learning such things with my grandfather. He acted out all the battles he fought and back then it was during the height of the Sheng Nong and Xuan Yuan war so I heard so many battles firsthand. Many times Grandfather took me to the battlefield and said that only by standing in the middle of the fallen corpses can I experience the heat of the blood and understand the sacrifices of the soldiers.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s emotions\u00a0flitted from envy to jealous to anger and finally to pity. When he was playing pretend war with his friends, Zhuan Xu was stepping over corpses to walk forward.Real battle, real death, such things even an adult would have a hard time enduring, yet a very young Zhuan Xu was standing there in the battlefield.Feng Long sighed \u201cFor sure an Emperor isn\u2019t a position that just anyone can possibly occupy.\u201dShan Hu announced dinner and the four sat down to eat. Feng Long awkwardly stood up and started toasting each person individually. He then stammered and looked at everyone until Zhuan Xu impatiently asked \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dFeng Long chuckled \u201cThat\u2026.I was thinking\u2026..my wedding to Xiao Yao ought to be scheduled. My grandfather wants to see great-grandchildren and I\u2019m sure your grandfather does as well.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart dropped with a thud, like a person walking on the edge of the cliff suddenly stepping on empty. Her hands started to shake and she quickly clenched into a fist and looked down.Feng Long stared at the Yellow Emperor who smiled \u201cI have no opinion, you youngsters decide your own matters.\u201dFeng Long relaxed and immediately looked at Zhuan Xu who smiled and slowly sipped his wine. Feng Long kept staring pitifully \u201cYour majesty, you have a gaggle of women so you ought to pity a brother. I promised Xiao Yao I would only have her as my one woman in my entire life. I don\u2019t have a problem with it and am willing to do so, but my family is anxious that I get married.\u201dZhuan Xu finished his wine and smiled \u201cThis is Xiao Yao\u2019s matters so everything according to her wishes.\u201dFeng Long sighed and turned to Xiao Yao and wheedled \u201cWhat do you think?\u2019Xiao Yao bit her lip and said nothing, she didn\u2019t sense anything when she and Feng Long were coming back but he clearly came prepared. Sometimes he wasn\u2019t as clueless as he appeared.Feng Long softly said \u201cIf you like living on Sheng Nong Mountain, let\u2019s ask His majesty to give us a peak since there are so many palaces uninhabited. If you like Zhi Yi, the Chi Sui clan has a big residence in Zhi Yi and you can renovate it. If you find both places too hectic and want quiet then we can go to Chi Sui. Have you been there? There are lots of rivers and lakes, like Gao Xing, so you\u2019ll like it a lot. The Chi Sui residence is very lovely centered around a lake and especially beautiful in the Summertime.\u201dFeng Long looked at Xiao Yao\u2019s expression and continued \u201cIf you like medicine, you can keep learning and even if you want to become a practicing doctor I would fully support you.\u201dXiao Yao felt that if her life was exactly as Feng Long offered then it was already such a good life. Chi Sui castle wasn\u2019t very big and was beautiful and serene. Perhaps she can open a medical clinic in Chi Sui Castle, there might not be blissful happiness but there also won\u2019t be gutwrenching sadness. The days would pa.s.s in mellow calmness. She wanted to say yes but the word was stuck in her mouth and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to actually say it out loud so she nodded her head.Feng Long asked \u201cSo you agree?\u201dXiao Yao nodded again \u201cYup.\u201dFeng Long was so happy he couldn\u2019t barely contain his smile. He scooted back to his seat and said \u201cI\u2019ll write a letter to my grandfather tonight and have him send an envoy to discuss wedding details with the His majesty the Grand Emperor.\u201dWith this matter decided the four of them resumed eating. Xiao Yao was silent while Zhuan Xu smiled but said very little. The Yellow Emperor chatted a bit with Feng Long but it was all Feng Long talking and being so happy.After dinner Feng Long didn\u2019t stuck around like he used to and spend more time with the Yellow Emperor but instead immediately bid farewell and rushed off in excitement on his winged ride.Xiao Yao walked back into the hut to write a letter to her dad and ask him to pick an auspicious wedding date for her.After she wrote the letter and summoned the messenger bird, she tied the letter on its leg and was about to release it when Zhuan Xu reached out and captured the bird in his one hand and grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand in his other hand.Xiao Yao looked quizzically at him as he asked \u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWe\u2019ve been engaged for a long time and I have to get married sooner or later. Since Feng Long wants to get married soon then might as well get married soon!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou\u2019re not going to consider anyone else?\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cTo be honest you have plenty of talented men reporting to you and Feng Long is just one of them. But his personality is open and easygoing and he isn\u2019t too into romance, plus he\u2019s willing to accept all my quirks. When I agreed to get engaged to him years ago, you were the one who said there couldn\u2019t be a better option than him.\u201dZhuan Xu remained silent.Xiao Yao \u201cGege!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get married!\u201d His hand was cold and his fingers were shaking.Xiao Yao patted his hand \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes were trained on his feet and his eyes were filled with abject sorrow and despair.Xiao Yao said \u201cI understand! Years ago when you married Xing Yue, I also felt very upset like she was taking you away from me, that we would be like outsiders from then on.\u201dZhuan Xu looked up and stared at Xiao Yao \u201cYou were upset when I got married?\u201dXiao Yao laughed at herself and nodded \u201cI really felt so awful back then, so angry like something that was mine was being stolen by another. Later I realized I was being petty, you\u2019ve been married to Xing Yue for three years but you\u2019re still my Gege. You didn\u2019t get stolen by Xing Yue. Later when I marry Feng Long, you\u2019re still my closest, most trusted person.\u201dBut he didn\u2019t want just that, he wanted more\u2026\u2026 Zhuan Xu could only smile as his heart fell. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want anything and only asked for her man to have only her. He no longer had the right anymore.It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have a chance with her, he actually had more chances than any of the men in her life. When they were working hard to get close to her, he was already deep inside Xiao Yao\u2019s heart. If he but reached out then no one else would ever have a chance. But he needed those men\u2019s help so time and time again he pushed Xiao Yao towards them.When Xuan Yuan Castle was dangerous to him, he got Jing\u2019s help. When he arrived in the Middle Plains and it was dangerous in Sheng Nong Mountain, he got Feng Long and Jing to unite and back him. Then the entire Middle Plains backed him. But now that he didn\u2019t need help from either of them anymore, Xiao Yao had already given her heart to Jing and pledged her body to Feng Long.In Xuan Yuan Castle, he knew that night Jing stayed all night in Xiao Yao\u2019s room. But he could only pretend not to know. He stared at the map of the entire vast wilderness all night until sunrise. On Zhi Jing Summit, he knew Xiao Yao went to visit Cao Ao Peak to meet Jing and didn\u2019t come back until the next morning but he could only pretend not to know anything. He tensely studied his work all night. When he was in the most dangerous moment, he knew Xiao Yao agreed to marry Feng Long just for him but he could do nothing to stop it\u2026\u2026. Back then he couldn\u2019t even protect himself. A woman who claimed to love him was too scared to even meet with him, but Xiao Yao agreed to marry another man for him.Zhuan Xu gripped Xiao Yao\u2019s hand tighter and the messenger bird started to cry out trying to escape his hand.The Yellow Emperor suddenly appeared and yelled \u201cZhuan Xu!\u201dZhuan Xu and Xiao Yao looked over at him and the Yellow Emperor said very gently \u201cZhuan Xu, release the bird and let it go.\u201dZhuan Xu gradually released his hand and the messenger bird took fight towards Gao Xing.Xiao Yao rubbed her hand and said \u201cThis matter is a bit abrupt, Feng Long can be very random when he does things.\u201dZhuan Xu turned to leave and his voice was dark \u201cRandom? He calculated this better than anyone!\u201dXiao Yao watched Zhuan Xu disappear into the clouds and asked the Yellow Emperor \u201cDoes Zhuan Xu and Feng Long have a conflict I don\u2019t know about?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cA liege and his subordinate will always help each other but at the same time be wary of each other.\u201dXiao Yao wanted to say more but the Yellow Emperor added \u201cNothing to worry about, Feng Long is a smart man and he will plan what\u2019s best for him but will never cross the line with his liege. But people have tempers so if Zhuan Xu needs him then he also needs to give him some leeway. As the ruler Zhuan Xu needs to have this magnitude.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cAfter the wedding I think it best if I go to Chi Sui Castle. It would be too complicated to stay here!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled and then sighed. Feng Long really was the man most suited for Xiao Yao, he can\u2019t give her deep pa.s.sion but he can give her a calm uneventful life.The Yellow Emperor walked off but then turned back to see Xiao Yao sitting beside the window staring into the dark night in a daze. He coughed lightly and Xiao Yao appeared to wake from a trance \u201cGrandfather, you haven\u2019t gone to sleep?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor suddenly said \u201cI asked Zhuan Xu to find any way possible to get Nine Lives Xiang Liu to turn his allegiance to us.\u201dXiao Yao bolted upright and stared at the Yellow Emperor.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cAll these years, using any method, any persuasion, any means available, he turned it all down.\u201dXiao Yao looked back out into the dark distance and her face showed no emotion, no joy and no sorrow.\u201cZhuan Xu ordered that two peaks in Sheng Nong Mountain be designated as off-limits and he has his own personal soldiers guarding it. You ought to know why he did that. Even though Xiang Liu saved your life, but you don\u2019t owe him anything.\u201d________________________________Zhuan Xu went to Xuan Yuan Castle to handle some matters and didn\u2019t come to Xiao Yue Summit for ten plus days.It was instead Xing Yue who never came that decided to pay a visit.Last time Xing Yue saw Xiao Yao was when she just returned to Xiao Yue Summit and after that visit she invited Xiao Yao to visit Zhi Jin Palace to see her. Xing Yue was now the Empress and she loved the adulation and respect her position earned her. She liked everyone bowing before her, even Yi Yang who used to give her att.i.tude now had to lower herself before her. But Xiao Yao remained the exception.Xiao Yao was very respectful to her but never bowed her head to her. From birth until now, Xing Yue never encountered a girl like Xiao Yao. She never looked down on people below her nor did she pander to those with more power than her. She wanted for nothing and wished for nothing.Xing Yue liked Xiao Yao because she was so different than the other girls, she had this carefree aura about her. But Xing Yue hated Xiao Yao also because she was so different than the other girls, all the things the girls valued became insignificant when it reached Xiao Yao.Xing Yue was hiding a secret fear deep inside her. When she married Zhuan Xu, he had a smile the entire time but her womanly intuition told her that Zhuan Xu was in the worst mood possible. She actually felt that Zhuan Xu wearing all black was a declaration to the entire world that he was not happy. On their wedding night Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t sleep with her and she endured her anxiety and tried to be nonchalant about it. She turned over to get closer to him but he turned over and was further from her. Xing Yue didn\u2019t know why but the entire night she was in a state of abject worry. She told herself over and over that Zhuan Xu was simply too tired. The next morning she got up and put on a happy face to head out and receive the people\u2019s well-wishes.The second night Zhuan Xu still didn\u2019t want her. Xing Yue worried the entire night and by morning even her makeup couldn\u2019t mask her dark circles under her eyes. Thank goodness Zhuan Xu was as sweet to her as always during the day and it even led to the people jumping to the wrong conclusion and joking about how Zhuan Xu was going to wear his Empress out if he didn\u2019t control himself.By the third night, Xing Yue pushed aside her fear and nervousness and took off her robe and embraced Zhuan Xu from behind. She wasn\u2019t as pretty as Jin Xuan or as seductive as Xiao Xiao, she wasn\u2019t as gentle as Shu Hui or as alluring as the Wan Lei Consort\u2026.but she was always very certain that she could give Zhuan Xu something none of them could. Yet right now she was frightened.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t turn around and was so cold like a rock. Xing Yue\u2019s tears fell and she pressed forward to kiss him.Zhuan Xu finally turned around and pressed her down underneath him. In the darkness she couldn\u2019t see his face but her body could feel him. In that moment he was like another person, his actions were filled with pent up longing and overflowing tenderness. Xing Yue felt that she was drowning in his pa.s.sion and in the moment when he entered her, Xing Yue\u2019s tears fell in happiness. Then she heard something, soft and barely perceptible, she heard Zhuan Xu seemingly call out \u201cXiao Yao\u201d. Xing Yue was like a cat straining to hear but she heard nothing else and soon she was swept up in the moment and forgot everything. By the time she woke the next morning, she couldn\u2019t be certain what she heard last night was real or just a figment of her imagination.Those three nights became Xing Yue\u2019s deepest secret.Gradually Xing Yue forgot those three nights because she wanted to forget. Zhuan Xu treated her nice but not pa.s.sionate though never cold. He treated her better than his other consorts and that was enough to make Xing Yue content.But just when she was about to forget it completely, Xiao Yao came back. Xing Yue didn\u2019t even know how Xiao Yao came back, but by the time she found out, Xiao Yao was already ensconced in Xiao Yue Summit.The name Zhuan Xu called that night, whether it was real or not, it caused Xing Yue to develop a hidden fear that she couldn\u2019t tell anyone about. She could only secretly observe and in the last two years since Xiao Yao\u2019s return, Zhuan Xu went to Xiao Yue Summit every day rain or s.h.i.+ne. Of course, before Xiao Yao came back he also went every day to greet the Yellow Emperor so no one saw any change in his behavior. But Xing Yue felt it was different but it wasn\u2019t something that could be explained why it was different. When Zhuan Xu went he always had a slight smile on his face and when he returned this was a sliver of tenderness in his eyes. It was the way he occasionally glanced towards Xiao Yue Summit with a fleeting look of longing.The more Xing Yue observed the more terrified she became. But her terror was something she couldn\u2019t even find evidence for. With Zhuan Xu\u2019s personality, if it was true then why didn\u2019t he just take Xiao Yao for himself? He was already the ruler of a kingdom, there was no need for him to hold himself back! So Xing Yue could only rea.s.sure herself that she was over-thinking it all because of a mistaken murmur she heard that night.But Xing Yue still couldn\u2019t feel relaxed so she went to see Feng Long and asked when her brother was going to marry Xiao Yao. Thank goodness her brother\u2019s answer made her happy because he said he was just thinking the same thing.Feng Long sighed \u201cIf I want to marry it ought to be now otherwise it\u2019ll have to wait until the war is over and by then it\u2019s not clear if Xiao Yao will marry me.\u201dXing Yue asked \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou have to keep this secret.\u201dXing Yue nodded \u201cGege you know you can trust me to keep silent.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cSeeing Zhuan Xu\u2019s moves recently, I think he\u2019s planning to attack Gao Xing.\u201dXing Yue\u2019s eyes widened and Feng Long smiled \u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to never underestimate Zhuan Xu. He is a very scary man!\u201dAfter her shock pa.s.sed Xing Yue felt ecstatic, like she was already able to sneer at Xiao Yao\u2019s upcoming fate.When Feng Long told Xing Yue that Xiao Yao agreed to get married she asked \u201cWhat did His majesty say?\u201dFeng Long replied \u201cBoth majesties gave their consent.\u201dXing Yue finally felt relieved, she really did conjure up too much in her own night. That night it was just Zhuan Xu\u2019s pa.s.sionate sigh that she heard wrong.Xing Yue went to Xiao Yue Summit to visit Xiao Yao with a feeling like she was above Xiao Yao\u2019s fate in life, feeling happy and pitying her at the same time. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know why Xing Yue\u2019s att.i.tude was so odd this time but she felt Xing Yue was suddenly nicer to her because she was marrying Feng Long soon.Xiao Yao treated Xing Yue the same as always, respectful but not deferential. Xing Yue and Xiao Yao chatted about this and that and she lingered until the Yellow Emperor returned to the hut carrying a hoe on his shoulder.The Yellow Emperor was wearing a farmer\u2019s hat with his pant legs rolled up and his feet covered in mud. He smiled at Xing Yue with no stern aura in his expression but Xing Yue felt like her inner most thoughts were laid bare before the Yellow Emperor\u2019s eyes. It was like sharp daggers digging into her back and Xing Yue couldn\u2019t sit another second and quickly greeted the Yellow Emperor and took her leave.______________________________The Grand Emperor wrote back to Xiao Yao that he and Feng Long\u2019s grandfather had conferred and set the wedding for two months hence.Ever since Xiao Yao got engaged the Grand Emperor had her trousseau prepared already so all Xiao Yao needed to do was don her wedding dress and walk down the aisle. But the Grand Emperor requested that Xiao Yao return to Five G.o.ds Mountain to prepare for the wedding before he would announce the wedding date to the entire world.Xiao Yao knew why her dad did this, it wasn\u2019t to adhere to wedding custom because her dad didn\u2019t care about that. It was the request of a father who was worried and anxious over the future of his daughter and wanted to confirm her decision one last time. He wanted to be certain that Feng Long was the man his daughter wanted to entrust the rest of her life to.Xiao Yao wrote back that she would return to Gao Xing after she did a final personal matter.Xiao Yao went through Yu Jiang to contact Chi Sui Xian to ask her to dig up something that Xiao Yao asked her to bury a few years ago.After Zhuan Xu a.s.sumed the throne, Xiao Yao used her position for the first time in her life to have precious treasures from around the vast wilderness collected and brought to her.From the Northeast tops of the Snow Mountain, she collected a piece of Snow Mountain Ice Essence. It grew on the tops of the Snow Mountain and itself was not poisonous. But if something poisonous went inside when it was forming, then it would soak up the poison and after tens of thousands of years it would become one of the most poisonous things in the world. This particular Ice Essence that Xiao Yao found happened to have an injured ice worm demon crawl inside so after countless thousands of years underneath Snow Mountain, it had become a piece of extremely rare poisonous ice. It appeared like a beautiful piece of icy jade but actually exuded a poisonous aura that could pierce straight to the heart.Xiao Yao used all her effort to carve this piece of poisonous Ice Essence into the shape of a sea clam sh.e.l.l, she carved two sides of an exquisite white clam sh.e.l.l with wave ripples along the edges. When it was opened it resembled a blooming flower.Xiao Yao then used all sorts of exotic herbs and poisons to create two merpeople. She put the mermaid on the clam sh.e.l.l and she put the merman in the corner away from the clam sh.e.l.l. Xiao Yao also made red coral and colorful little fishes.After it was all completed, Xiao Yao brought out the ice crystals collected from the North Pole and had a specialist split it open and hollow it out. She put the red coral in first and secured it on the bottom. Then she mixed up a batch of poisons with Jade Mountain bone essence to create a blue liquid suspension that she filled the ice crystal ball with so it appeared like blue water. She then put the clam sh.e.l.l with the mermaid and the merman carefully inside the poisonous liquid and surrounded it with the colorful fish. She then closed up the ice crystal ball and used her spiritual power to temporarily seal it.To permanently seal back up an opened ice crystal required that it be returned to the North Pole and placed back inside the ice mountains. Then a powerful ice spirit G.o.d or G.o.ddess would then create a spiritual maze around it. After two or three more years, the opened up ice crystal would permanently seal back up without any signs it had ever been opened.Back then when Xiao Yao finished to the final step, she racked her brains and remembered the most powerful ice power G.o.d in the vast wilderness was Chi Sui Xian. She asked Zhuan Xu if she could ask Xian to help and he said \u201cYou found the right person. I\u2019ll have Yu Jiang ask her for help. That ice G.o.ddess is quite warm towards Yu Jiang.\u201dWhen Xian came to see Xiao Yao, she thought Xian would look down on her for asking such a powerful G.o.ddess to do such a little favor. But when Xian saw Xiao Yao\u2019s creation she exclaimed \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful! You must have spent a lot of time?\u201dXiao Yao nodded.Xian said \u201cI\u2019ll help you seal it into the ice mountain in the North Pole. When you need to retrieved just have someone send me a message.\u201dFour years had pa.s.sed and now Xiao Yao needed to take it out. When Xian brought the ice crystal back, she placed it on a dish and it was covered with more ice so looked just like a regular chunk of ice crystal dug out from the North Pole.Xiao Yao asked a master carver who spent three days and three nights to finally shape the ice crystal into a round ball.The clear exquisite ice crystal, inside was the deep blue sea, and in the water was colorful little fishes swimming and beautiful red coral. There was an all-white giant clam sh.e.l.l like a blooming flower and inside a beautiful mermaid sat on the clam sh.e.l.l. Her hair flowed like seaweed and her beautiful tail was half on the clam sh.e.l.l and half in the water. She had one hand on her heart and the other hand reached out towards the distance like she wanted to grab onto something or like she was calling someone to her. In the direction where her hand stretched there was a merman floating in the water. He appeared close to the clam sh.e.l.l but he was coldly staring outside the ice crystal ball so that it felt like he was actually in another world and not in the world of the peaceful isolated ocean with the mermaid.The underwater world inside the ice crystal was too beautiful that it appeared like a blue-colored dream.When the ice crystal ball was placed on the table, it was so cold the icy air swirled around it and make it even more illusory like it could vanish in a gust of wind, except the ice crystal was so hard that even knives and swords couldn\u2019t damage it.The Yellow Emperor saw what Xiao Yao had made and he was so taken aback. He walked into the hut and carefully examined it for a long time. He said nothing other than to sigh \u201cOnly you will waste such precious things.\u201dXiao Yao stared at the ice crystal ball and said \u201cThis is the last time.\u201dXiao Yao wrapped the ice crystal ball in a demon bear pelt and sent it along with a letter inside a jade container. She went to the Tu Shan clan messenger shop and paid five times more than usual to deliver it as soon as possible to Qing Shui Town.Inside the jade container was a letter with only one short message:\u201cIn two months I am getting married. This is the last poison I will make for you. Please accept with a smile.\u201d____________________________After Xiao Yao left the messenger shop, she wandered around the streets of Zhi Yi and could see it was even more bustling than before. This newly designated capital was bigger, more vibrant, more diverse than Xuan Yuan Castle. But for some reason Xiao Yao missed the Zhi Yi Castle she first encountered when she first arrived in the Middle Plains with Zhuan Xu.A fragrant scent wafted out from the snack shop and Xiao Yao went to buy some duck neck and chicken feet which the shop owner wrapped carefully in lotus leaves. She then went to the next door wine shop to buy a jug of plum wine.Back then she loved to snack because it was delicious and she couldn\u2019t help but want to nibble on it. Now she realized it wasn\u2019t the taste but the feeling. Back then she thought she was all wizened inside but she was still a very young girl who could happily enjoy the delights of the world.Xiao Yao left Zhi Yi Castle and Miao Pu was waiting for her by the cloud carriage. She saw her carrying two bags and laughed \u201cPrincess hasn\u2019t bought these things in a long time.\u201dXiao Yao got on the cloud carriage and said suddenly \u201cI\u2019m not going back yet.\u201dMiao Pu asked \u201cWhere to then, Princess?\u201dXiao Yao was silent for a moment and then said \u201cAccompany me to Qing Qiu.\u201dMiao Pu was startled and asked \u201cWhat does Princess want to do in Qing Qiu?\u201dXiao Yao stared at Miao Pu and she immediately said \u201cYes! Departing right away!\u201dAn hour later the cloud carriage landed in Qing Qiu and Xiao Yao got out and glanced over at Qing Qiu Mountain. The mountain was still the same, trees green and rivers flowing, but the person and situation was no longer there.She slowly walked along the Qing Qiu streets. Qing Qiu was close to Zhi Yi but very different since the people of Qing Qiu were very well off thanks to the Tu Shan clan. The people walking on the streets ambled because they could afford to enjoy life. Xiao Yao unexpectedly came and she didn\u2019t know why she came either. She just walked with no destination in sight with Miao Pu trailing behind her.Xiao Yao walked until suddenly Miao Pu called out \u201cPrincess!\u201d and pulled her sleeve.Xiao Yao stopped and glanced quizzically back at Miao Pu who whispered \u201cOver there!\u201dXiao Yao looked in that direction and saw Jing standing not far from her. Neither expected to run into each other on the streets of Qing Qiu so as people pa.s.sed them by both stood rooted in place like a spell was cast on them.Finally Jing got a hold of himself and rushed over to Xiao Yao \u201cXiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d He had a million things to say to her but couldn\u2019t say any of it.Xiao Yao\u2019s smile was beaming \u201cI randomly came for a twirl, didn\u2019t expect to run into you.\u201dXiao Yao handed over the packages in her hand and Jing instinctively took it. Xiao Yao smiled \u201cIn two months Feng Long and I will be getting married. Please attend with your wife when the day arrives.\u201dJing dropped the items in his hand and the jug of wine smashed on the ground and the scent of plum wine wafted in the air. Xiao Yao ignored it and bowed to Jing with a smile before turning and quickly walking away.\u201cXiao Yao\u2026\u2026.\u201d Jing reached out his hand but couldn\u2019t keep her there and could only watch as her sleeve slipped through his fingers and she floated off.Moments later Jing kneeled down and picked up the other package and opened it to find the duck necks and chicken feet.In that split second the past came rus.h.i.+ng back\u2014\u2014-The first time he went into the kitchen he was so clumsy and Xiao Yao laughed at him and then came to help.The first thing he learned to make was marinated duck neck. When Xiao Liu ate it his eyes lit up and whispered \u201cYours taste better than Lao Mu. But what will happen if I get used to your flavor?\u201d He smiled and said nothing but in his heart he thought \u201cI want you to get used to it because I\u2019ll make it for you for the rest of your life.\u201dInside the Evergreen Residence, he taught her to play the zither but she hadn\u2019t the patience to learn. She liked to munch on a duck neck and make him play for her. She would solemnly declare \u201cSince you know how to play, in the future if I want to listen to music you can just play for me.\u201dOn Sheng Nong Mountain, munching on duck necks and drinking plum wine they talked all night\u2026\u2026.Everything was as vivid as if it was yesterday. But she\u2026..she was about to become another man\u2019s wife! Her life would no longer have anything to do with him!Jing felt such pain in his heart he couldn\u2019t speak. Such pain that a sweet acrid taste rose up in his throat and he started coughing violently.__________________________Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Summit that evening and found Xiao Yao had personally cooked dinner for him. Xiao Yao\u2019s cooking wasn\u2019t bad but she was lazy so rarely cooked. The fact that she cooked for him made Zhuan Xu so happy he ate a lot and the two of them kept the Yellow Emperor company with lots of laughter and chatter.After dinner Xiao Yao bid farewell to Zhuan Xu since she planned to leave first thing in the morning for Five G.o.ds Mountain.Zhuan Xu simply smiled and said nothing.The Yellow Emperor gently said \u201cYou go back first, later Zhuan Xu and I will have the trousseau our side prepared for you sent over.\u201dZhuan Xu had Miao Pu bring out the wine and Xiao Yao also wanted to drink so order Miao Pu to bring out big bowls.Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu started gulping bowl after bowl of wine. Their tolerance level was equal and back in Qing Shui Town they never could determine who could drink more because both held back.Tonight they drank and held nothing back, gulping down wine like water until both were roaring drunk. Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and kept saying \u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d Xiao Yao kept hollering \u201cIt\u2019s you guys who don\u2019t want me!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI want you. You be my Empress. I don\u2019t want anyone else, I\u2019ll kick them all out\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Yellow Emperor asked \u201cWho is the personal guard tonight?\u201dXiao Xiao walked out and the Yellow Emperor said \u201cTake Zhuan Xu back now.\u201dXiao Xiao picked up Zhuan Xu who held onto Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and refused to let go \u201cI don\u2019t want any other woman, I just want you\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Yellow Emperor raised his palm and struck Zhuan Xu unconscious with one blow to the neck.The Yellow Emperor stared at Xiao Xiao \u201cYou guard him personally tonight. If anyone else hears a word he says tonight, kill that person immediately.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Xiao picked up Zhuan Xu and vaulted on a winged ride and was gone in the clouds.____________________________Xiao Yao woke up at dawn with a raging headache. Her things were packed so after breakfast she bowed three times to the Yellow Emperor and climbed on the cloud carriage.Once she arrived on Five G.o.ds Mountain, as expected her dad asked again if she was certain she wanted to marry Chi Sui Feng Long.Xiao Yao giggled \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to marry him then why get engaged to him?\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cBack then Zhuan Xu was surrounded by danger from all sides so knowing your personality you would do anything to help you. If you didn\u2019t get engaged to Feng Long, the Middle Plains clans and families would never have banded together to back him.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBut Grandfather planned to pa.s.s the throne to Zhuan Xu already.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cSilly girl, it\u2019s not the same. If the Middle Plains didn\u2019t band together then the Yellow Emperor may have waited to keep watching Zhuan Xu and delay the pa.s.sing of the throne. With one delay anything can happen. If it wasn\u2019t for the Four Great Clans banding together to lead the other Middle Plains families, do you think they would support Zhuan Xu this completely? In their eyes Zhuan Xu is the bloodline of Xuan Yuan and the Middle Plains are natural rivals. But because of their battle with the Yellow Emperor they think Zhuan Xu is the Emperor they chose and not the successor the Yellow Emperor chose thus all their rivalry vanished.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing. When she agreed to marry Feng Long it was because of Zhuan Xu, she kept insisting otherwise because she didn\u2019t want him to feel bad. But now she didn\u2019t want to call off the wedding because Feng Long was the best choice for her. He knew about her past with Jing and accept it. They also agreed that he would help Zhuan Xu and he did do that. Feng Long help up his end of the bargain, it was Xiao Yao\u2019s turn to fulfill her end of the promise.The Grand Emperor said \u201cI\u2019ll give you seven days to reconsider.\u201dDuring the ensuing seven days, Xiao Yao really did reconsider and think carefully. Every day she sat on the jagged rocks outside of the Dragon Bone Prison and looked out over the deep blue ocean.When Ah Nian went to get her, she could see the blue horizon, the red rocks on the cliffs, and Xiao Yao dressed all in white sitting bare foot on the black jagged rocks as the waves crested at her feet.This image was impossible to describe other than Ah Nian felt a sense of utter desolation for her sister. Xiao Yao\u2019s image made her think of the legends of old, of a fisherman\u2019s wife sitting on the rocks waiting for her lover to come back, sitting and waiting for so long she turned into a rock.Ah Nian had to break the desolation so she flew over and yelled \u201cJiejie!\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Ah Nian and then continued looking out over the horizon. Ah Nian said down beside her \u201cJiejie, what are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dAh Nian also looked out on the horizon and sighed \u201cI remember it was near here that I pushed you into the ocean. Back then I was so unhappy but know I realize it was nothing.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up.\u201dAh Nian asked \u201cJiejie, what were you doing that night here?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI came to see a friend.\u201d\u201cThen later, did that Nine-headed demon Xiang Liu continue to hara.s.s you?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head.Ah Nian said \u201cI thought that demon was pretty fascinating.\u201dXiao Yao looked back out over the blue ocean and said nothing.________________________________Seven days later the Grand Emperor asked Xiao Yao \u201cHave you decided?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI decided, announce the wedding date!\u201dThe Grand Emperor said nothing and announced the wedding date to the world. In the Autumn month on the 22nd day, Eldest Princess Gao Xing Jiu Yao was going to get married.The Chi Sui clan sent out wedding invitations to the world since the Chi Sui clan leader wasn\u2019t just the leader of the clan that was the head of the Four Great Clans, he was also the son of the Sheng Nong tribe head Little Zhu Rong as well as the older brother of the Xuan Yuan Empress. The entire vast wilderness mobilize to attend for Chi Sui Feng Long, and also for the Grand Emperor, the Black Emperor, and the Yellow Emperor. Not to mention the Royal Mother from Jade Mountain.The Chi Sui clan wedding presents were sent to Gao Xing on a fleet of s.h.i.+ps so vast it was impossible to see the first and last s.h.i.+p in once glance. A few years ago when the Xuan Yuan Black Emperor married his Empress, the entire Xuan Yuan Kingdom celebrated. But this time for the marriage of the Chi Sui clan leader and the Gao Xing Eldest Princess, the entire vast wilderness was celebrating. When the news reached Qing Shui Town, all the restaurants were abuzz and even the brothel ladies couldn\u2019t stop gossiping about it.Xiang Liu was drinking and discussing matters when conversation reached him.Some said the Chi Sui clan leader was marrying the Gao Xing Princess for connections, other said he really loved her and promised that she would be his one and only woman in this lifetime, still others said the Princess was so beautiful she was unreal\u2026..So many rumors and suggestions but it all reached the same conclusion \u201cThis Princess sure has got a lucky life!\u201dEveryone sighed \u201cThis wedding is the biggest event in the last hundreds of years in the vast wilderness.\u201dXiang Liu stood up with a smile and bid farewell to the people he was drinking with.He walked out of the brothel to find a misty rain falling.He walked through a long street towards the western riverbanks, strolling slowly.He stood by the edge of the river and stared out at the water and misty air and it was impossible to tell what he was thinking.After a long time he looked down and opened his hand and in his palm was an ice crystal ball.Misty raindrops fell on his palm and created an icy mist around the ice crystal ball. It made the blue water inside even more vibrant like the ocean under a full moon,The blue ocean depths, the isolated peacefulness, the mermaid sitting on her beautiful clam sh.e.l.l home reaching out her hand to beckon, to plead, to summon. But the merman just coldly looked out at the world outside the ice crystal ball.Xiang Liu stared at the ice crystal scene for a long long time.Slowly he reached out a finger and pressed it on the ice crystal so it looked like he was taking the mermaid\u2019s outstretched hand.At at glance it appeared that they were holding hands but in truth the ice crystal separated them. They were from two completely different worlds, they could never truly be together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI hope no one thought\u00a0she was actually going to go through with it that easily and marry a guy dull as beans (to her) and who is likely more into studying war maps than making love to his wife. I love the reader jokes about how Feng Long is secretly in love with Zhuan Xu, that\u2019s not true but he\u2019s definitely way more excited to hang out with Zhuan Xu than Xiao Yao, that\u2019s for sure. I don\u2019t want that kind of pa.s.sionless marriage for Xiao Yao, and neither does the three men who love her. So which guy shows up to interrupt the exchange of vows? The whole thing goes down in the most dramatic way possible (perfect for a drama scene) but like everything there is more than meets the eye. If only the most romantic gesture of all time could be acknowledged but that would be too easy. Get ready to swoon and cry and swoon some more as this chapter unfurls in all its pent up glory. This is probably as close as its ever gotten between Xiao Yao and the guy but even the truth about their feelings for each other cannot set them free to be together.Chapter 32 \u2013 A Shadow Headed in Which Direction:The Autumn month arrived and the Gao Xing wedding party departed from Five G.o.ds Mountain via the water route towards Chi Sui.Under Ru So\u2019s expert travel planning, the wedding party entered the Chi Sui waterways on the dawn of the 22nd and the Chi Sui welcoming s.h.i.+ps were waiting with celebratory music playing that was so loud it shook the Earth.Both sides of the Chi Sui sh.o.r.e were jam packed with spectators there to watch the festivities.Chi Sui\u2019s clan traditional attire was the cla.s.sic flair of the Middle Plains with a preference for red. Xiao Yao took off her white robe with her maids a.s.sistance and put on her red wedding dress.The s.h.i.+ps entered the Chi Sui river and gradually slowed down. It was the season for the magnolias to bloom and there were magnolia trees on both sides of the sh.o.r.e and the fragrance carried for miles as the petals rained down. Xiao Yao sat by the s.h.i.+p\u2019s window and silently stared at the yellow petals floating by in the water.The s.h.i.+p hadn\u2019t yet reached the Chi Sui clan residence when the sound of the chatter on the sh.o.r.e reached the s.h.i.+p. Because too many guests were in attendance and the residence could not hold so many, the Chi Sui clan used its ice powers to freeze the lake surface into ice and a banquet was set up there. It brought a cool breeze to the proceedings and a great view to enjoy the banquet.The guests sighed, clearly the head of the Four Great Clans could do anything, it could find disciples with the necessary powers and it had money to spend on even the biggest of parties.When everyone saw the Gao Xing s.h.i.+ps arriving all the wedding guests\u00a0stood up to watch.Feng Long was wearing all red and was standing by the sh.o.r.e.Xiao Yao gingerly walked to the edge of s.h.i.+p with the a.s.sistance of her maid. She was dressed regally in all red and wearing a crown of jewels but her face was very beautifully bare. She only had on a little bit of lip tint which paired with the red peach blossom brand on her forehead turned her into a vision of beauty.Feng Long normally didn\u2019t put much thought into women but seeing her and thinking that tonight she would lay in his arms made even his heart thunder.The s.h.i.+p reached sh.o.r.e but Feng Long still didn\u2019t move and only stared dumbstruck at Xiao Yao.The crowds laughed at him and his face turned beet red and he quickly grabbed the red lotus flower branch bouquet and bowed to Xiao Yao \u201cThe lotus opens to bear unity, together our hearts as one.\u201dXiao Yao reached out for it and repeated the same auspicious promise.With the sound of music surrounding them, Feng Long a.s.sisted Xiao Yao off the s.h.i.+p and felt her small hand in his but it wasn\u2019t soft like the other girls but instead had hard callouses which made him feel even more tender towards her and he held her hand even tighter.Xiao Yao and Feng Long each held the bouquet branch and walked forward. The path was created using lotus flowers of every color because the Chi Sui clan was based next to water so revered the lotus flower as good luck. The red lotus was the most rare and required using spiritual powers to grow.The kids were told to pick up the lotus and toss it at her to bring more children. Feng Long leaned down to whisper \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like you, it\u2019s custom to use lotus to throw at the bride\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was red \u201cI know, on the s.h.i.+p the maids explained to me.\u201d Apparently right after the ceremony the couple would retreat to a lotus tent also as a sign to have more children.Feng Long stared at Xiao Yao and he was so overcome that he couldn\u2019t wait for the ceremony to be over as soon as possible, for night to fall as quickly as possible, to return to their honeymoon suite as soon as possible. Feng Long said \u201cXiao Yao, after the ceremony then you\u2019re mine for the rest of our lives.\u201d Xiao Yao lowered her head and Feng Long smiled.There were people outside the residence cataloging all the wedding gifts sent from around the vast wilderness.\u201cTu Shan clan, ninety nine East Sea pearls, ninety nine North Pole ice crystal wind chimes\u2026..\u201d Everyone stared at the Tu Shan clan leader, the ice crystals were rare and expensive and had many uses. Turning it into a wind chime was actually a waste so most ice crystals were gifted in original form, no one would ever give an ice crystal wind chime much less ninety nine of them.Xiao Yao entered the residence and saw Jing sitting next to the Xi Ling clan leader. He was dressed in blue and looked thin and wan but still had a respectful smile on his face though he appeared\u00a0exhausted.Xiao Yao thought, is he sick? And it looks rather serious. Then why come to the wedding? Did he want to come or did he come because he didn\u2019t want Feng Long to think there was any awkwardness? Did anyone know he is sick\u2026.Xiao Yao\u2019s mind was jumbled in that moment.Feng Long whispered urgently \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dXiao Yao snapped out of it and realized this was her wedding to Feng Long. She felt this bittersweet sadness well up, from now on Jing would have nothing to do with her anymore.Feng Long whispered \u201cTwo months ago Jing came to see me while sick and asked me to cancel the wedding. I left in a huff. I hope after the wedding he can finally let you go.\u201d Xiao Yao said nothing and Feng Long asked \u201cAre you happy?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dFeng Long saw her smile and felt relieved \u201cJing said he asked me to cancel the wedding not because he still had you in his heart but because he knew you weren\u2019t happy and didn\u2019t want to marry me. I felt conflicted and discussed it with my sister but she said no one forced you to marry me and you agreed yourself so how could you not be willing?\u201dA white-haired elder said \u201cShush, the auspicious hour is here!\u201dFeng Long and Xiao Yao readied themselves and stopped talking.A voice rang out \u201cAuspicious hour is here! First pray to the Heavens!\u201dXiao Yao and Feng Long prayed to the Heavens.\u201cSecond pray to the ancestors!\u201dFeng Long\u2019s grandfather, his dad Little Zhu Rong, and his mother all smiled down at them.Feng Long was about to lead Xiao Yao over to kneel before them when suddenly a clear loud voice sounded that interrupted the proceedings.\u201cXiao Yao!\u201dEveryone turned their heads and saw Fang Feng Bei dress all in white walking in from outside calling out in a strong voice \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t marry him.\u201dXiao Yao stared in a daze at Fang Feng Bei.Everyone was stunned, no one could believe that a lowly born son of the Fang Feng family would dare interfere with the wedding of the Chi Sui clan leader. Chi Sui Zhen Tian thundered in rage \u201cGuards! Drag this rude b.a.s.t.a.r.d away and hold him! Afterwards I\u2019m going to ask Fang Feng Xiao Guai how he raised his son?\u201dA few Chi Sui clan guards rushed towards Fang Feng Bei to drag him out but they were held back by a powerful barrier and couldn\u2019t even get close to Fang Feng Bei.Fang Feng Bei acted like no one else was around and walked towards Xiao Yao. As he walked the guards trying to block him all were sent flying to the ground.Feng Long controlled his rage and said in a threatening way \u201cFang Feng Bei, there are many honored guests present today and I don\u2019t want to disturb them. I hope you don\u2019t live to regret this!\u201dFang Feng Bei ignored him and only stared at Xiao Yao \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t get married.\u201dXiao Yao furiously asked \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t marry Chi Sui Feng Long!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me NOW not to marry him?\u201d Xiao Yao wanted to laugh her head off. \u201cYou leave immediately!\u201dXiao Yao said to Feng Long \u201cLet\u2019s continue the wedding, I don\u2019t want to miss the auspicious hour!\u201dChi Sui Xian led some guards to block Fang Feng Bei\u2019s way and even with Xiang Liu\u2019s power he couldn\u2019t break though immediately.Feng Long nodded to the wedding coordinator to continue with the wedding \u201cSecond bow to the elders\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dXiao Yao and the Feng Long faced the three elders and prepared to bow.Fang Feng Bei was battling Chi Sui Xian and he called out \u201cXiao Yao, do you remember the blood oath you swore? If you renege on the promise then everything you love will become pain, everything that brings you happiness will turn bitter.\u201dXiao Yao stopped moving, she did make a blood oath with Xiang Liu to do one thing for him.Feng Long noticed Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t bowing and started to get nervous and called out \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dXiao Yao slowly turned back around and stared at Fang Feng Bei \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dFang Feng Bei \u201cI want you to leave with me right now!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s entire body turned cold, with the entire vast wilderness gathered here, if she ran away from her wedding and especially left with another man, that would be such an insult to the Chi Sui clan and to Feng Long. How would the Chi Sui clan see her? How would the entire world view her?Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy?\u201d Xiang Liu, you knew two months ago I was getting married, why do you have to do it this way? Do you want the entire world to spit on me? If you want to destroy me, why did you choose this most degrading method?Fang Feng Bei coldly said \u201cYou don\u2019t need to ask why, you just need to do as I say. I want you to leave with me. Right. Now!\u201dThe blood oath rang in her ears \u201cIf I renege on this promise, whatever I love will turn into pain, whatever brings me happiness will turn bitter.\u201d With today\u2019s events, even if she kept the promise, did that mean there won\u2019t be any pain and any bitterness? Xiao Yao bitterly smiled, whether or not she kept the promise, she was going to have not a day of peace in her life.Feng Long nervously stared at Xiao Yao and he didn\u2019t realize his voice was quivering \u201cXiao Yao, it\u2019s time to bow!\u201dFang Feng Bei stared intently at Xiao Yao and coldly pressed her \u201cXiao Yao, you owe me this.\u201dShe did owe him! Not just the blood oath, she owed him her life.Xiao Yao\u2019s face was stark white as she stumbled towards Fang Feng Bei. Feng Long grabbed her hand and his eyes were wide with terror \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao, don\u2019t\u2026..\u201d No matter when, he was someone in control. But right now he didn\u2019t know what was happening. Why was his life filled with utter joy a moment ago and in a split second all the joy vanished?Xiao Yao\u2019s voice shook \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2026.I\u2026.today I can\u2019t marry you! I\u2019m sorry!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t loud but everyone present all had powers so everyone heard it clearly. It was as shocking as thunder and even the folks who thought they had seen it all couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.From birth until now, Feng Long was like the son of the Heavens. There was nothing he couldn\u2019t have in the world, only things he didn\u2019t want. As the entire gathered guests stared at him, Feng Long felt his entire world collapse.Feng Long released his hand and stood straighter, a proud smile on his face. He said slowly \u201cI don\u2019t know what you promised Fang Feng Bei, but you promised to marry me today!\u201dXiao Yao knew she and Feng Long had an understanding, and even if she didn\u2019t want to marry him she would have chosen the right time to calmly tell him. He wouldn\u2019t mind in that case, but to run out of the wedding like this publicly was was shaming him. No man could accept such shame, much less a son of the Heavens like Feng Long.Xiao Yao\u2019s face was stark white and she turned to plead with Fang Feng Bei who coldly said \u201cLeave with me right now!\u201dXiao Yao said to Feng Long \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026.I wronged you!\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s voice was shaking and even her body was shaking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I don\u2019t dare ask for your forgiveness, and later you can do whatever you want to me and I\u2019ll accept it!\u201d Xiao Yao finished and didn\u2019t dare look at Feng Long before she ran towards Fang Feng Bei.Xiao Yao had weak powers and Feng Long could have easily forced her to go through with the wedding. This was the Chi Sui clan residence and he was the Chi Sui clan leader, no matter how powerful Fang Feng Bei was, he could stop him. But his pride, his arrogance, neither would allow him to forcefully keep her in front of a room full of guests.Two guards stopped Xiao Yao and pushed her back towards Feng Long.Feng Long called out \u201cLet her go!\u201dThe guards stared at Chi Sui Hai Tian and Little Zhu Rong.Feng Long called out \u201cI said let her go! No one dare stop her!\u201d His face was blue and a vein throbbed on his forehead and there was actually unshed tears in his eye but he still smiled proudly.All of the guards moved aside.Xiao Yao lowered her head and bowed to Feng Long before Fang Feng Bei grabbed her hand and pulled her out behind him.One person in all white taking away one person in all red, right in front of an entire wedding full of guests.It was dead silent in the wedding hall and not a single guest dared make a noise or move.The sound of merry music floated in from outside.Jing stared at Xiao Yao and Fang Feng Bei\u2019s retreating forms and his face was tinted with an odd red hue.Fang Feng Bei vaulted on a winged horse with Xiao Yao and it rose into the air and disappeared in the sky. Jing suddenly started coughing violently and that seemed to awaken the entire hall of guests. Little Zhu Rong stood up and calmly said \u201cThe banquet is prepared and everyone came from far away. Please enjoy the banquet before leaving.\u201dEveryone acted like nothing happened and accepted before quickly leaving the wedding hall.Little Zhu Rong stared at his son standing ramrod straight and his elderly father-in-law and said \u201cDad, you and Feng Long go rest! Don\u2019t worry, let Xiao Ye and I handle the rest.\u201dThe Chi Sui Madam sighed and stood next to Little Zhu Rong. Yet another time when she and her Gege needed to once again shoulder the burden together and overcome this difficult event.The winged horse flew out of Chi Sui Castle and once Xiang Liu confirmed no one was following, he switched to the back of the white condor.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t say a word or make a move. She was like a wooden puppet letting Xiang Liu do as he wanted with her.The white condor flew East and in the middle of the night it actually flew to Qing Shui Town.Xiang Liu led Xiao Yao into an ordinary human residence and said \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here for a few days.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and curled up into a ball in the corner of the pallet.Xiang Liu asked \u201cDo you hate me for preventing you from marrying the Chi Sui clan leader?\u201dXiao Yao curled her body, grabbed her legs, buried her head on her knees, and said nothing. Hate or no hate, she owed him this. He came to ask, she had to do it.Xiang Liu saw that Xiao Yao was ignoring him so said \u201cThere is hot water in the kitchen. Want to bathe?\u201dXiao Yao said nothing.\u201cDo what you want. I\u2019m going to rest.\u201d Xiang Liu turned and left.His one foot was out the door when Xiao Yao suddenly asked \u201cWhen did you find out I was getting married?\u201d Due to her head being buried on her knees, her voice sounded m.u.f.fled like it was coming from far away.Xiang Liu didn\u2019t turn around and his voice was cold \u201cTwo months ago.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s voice was shaking \u201cWhy\u2026.why did you have to do it this way?\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s voice got colder \u201cDo you have any right to ask me why? The terms of the deal was discussed in advance. Whatever I asked, you would do!\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and Xiang Liu left without looking back. When the door slowly closed behind him, it let out a soft thud. Xiao Yao remembered that when she was asleep under the ocean, every time the clan sh.e.l.l closed it would make a similar sound. Xiao Yao\u2019s tears silently fell.She didn\u2019t sleep all night and when the sun rose Xiao Yao felt her head throbbing in pain. She walked out of the room to go to the kitchen to get hot water to take a bath.She took off her dress and saw the bright red wedding gown. Xiao Yao bitterly smiled wondering what her dad, grandfather, and Zhuan Xu were thinking after hearing she ran off with another man on her wedding day. Xiao Yao saw a chest on the pallet and rummaged through it and found a few sets of ladies clothes. She picked a simple outfit.Xiao Yao bathed and changed into a the simple outfit and felt hungry. She remembered not eating much the day before the wedding and now it had been three days since she had eaten.Xiao Yao walked outside and saw Xiang Liu standing in the courtyard.His hair was back to being all white and fell behind him like a waterfall. The tree behind him had red leaves and the brightness contrasted so that he looked even more ethereal like untouched snow.Xiao Yao sensed something but had to confirm it \u201cWhere is Fang Feng Bei?\u201dXiang Liu coolly replied \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Xiang Liu and her eyes were blinded in pain by his whiteness like a cloud and like the snow. Tears came to her eyes, Fang Feng Bei took her away and now Fang Feng Bei was dead and would never appear again. From now on it was only Xiang Liu. That irresponsible, do whatever he wanted, taught her archery, took her through the world seeking the simplest of pleasures, that man was now dead.He once said \u2013 she and he were just temporarily companions in this unpredictable life seeking happiness. He never lied to her!Xiang Liu quietly stared at Xiao Yao, his face was like a ten thousand year old snow mountain, cold and inscrutable.Xiao Yao abruptly turned around and grabbed a pail of water from the well and splashed the cold water on her face. When she lifted her head her face was all wet. she didn\u2019t know if her tears came down and mixed with the water or was forced back and never fell.Xiao Yao went to the kitchen and found a biscuit and laid down on the gra.s.s pallet in the courtyard to munch on it and bask in the sun.Xiang Liu asked \u201cHas your sleepless problem not been cured yet?Xiao Yao acted like she didn\u2019t hear him. After what happened yesterday, who cared whether she slept well at night. A more prudish lady would have committed suicide by now.Xiang Liu asked \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go outside to walk around?\u201dWhat was there to see outside? It had been seventy years and even if the streets were the same, the people were all gone. If the people were all gone then why the walk down memory lane? If she didn\u2019t go see then she could preserve the happy memories. If she went to look then she might find all the flaws in her memories.Xiang Liu said nothing more and quietly read the sheep skin cloth in his hand.Xiao Yao nibbled on the biscuit and gradually fell asleep. She felt like she was back in Hui Chun Clinic and napping in the courtyard with s.h.i.+ Qi quietly working beside her. She would natter to s.h.i.+ Qi that the Autumn afternoon was the highlight of the day and have him go lay on the pallet with her to bask in the sun.A string of children\u2019s laughter roused Xiao Yao from her sleep and she flipped over. She subconsciously glanced towards s.h.i.+ Qi and instead saw only pure white. Xiao Yao covered her eyes with her hands but she didn\u2019t know what she was trying to cover.Xiang Liu and Xiao Yao lived in Qing Shui Town for over a month just like that.In the morning when Xiao Yao was still sleeping, Xiang Liu would go out. Xiao Yao never went out and when she slept she would toss and turn like she was still awake. When she was awake it was like a daze and she was dreaming. To say she hated Xiang Liu, but she never resisted and never tried to run away. To say she didn\u2019t hate Xiang Liu, she never spoke to him and acted like he didn\u2019t exist.It was now early Winter and the temperature was dropping. Xiang Liu still wore a simple all-white robe and often did work in the courtyard. Xiao Yao had weak powers and couldn\u2019t stay in the courtyard anymore so she often wrapped herself in a blanket and sat by the window.Xiang Liu would often stare at Xiao Yao for a long long time. Xiao Yao sometimes couldn\u2019t sense it and when she did sense it she didn\u2019t mind and let him continue to stare at her.When the first snowflakes fell, it was the first snow of the Winter. Xiao Yao reached out her hand but the snowflakes were too wispy and melted the moment it touched her palm.Xiang Liu walked into the room and closed the window for her.Xiao Yao opened it. Xiang Liu closed it again.Xiao Yao opened it again. Xiang Liu closed it again.Xiao Yao went to open it again but Xiang Liu used his power and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t open it at all.Even since she left Chi Sui Castle, Xiao Yao had been calm but now she couldn\u2019t endure it any longer and punched the window violently before glaring at Xiang Liu.Xiang Liu coolly said \u201cWhat kind of person I am, you\u2019ve known all along. Since you dared to make a deal with the devil, you ought to have the courage to accept the consequences.\u201dXiao Yao was taken aback because Xiang Liu was absolutely correct. Their deal was completely fair. Even if she could do it over and knowing the consequences of today, to protect Zhuan Xu she would still choose to move the voodoo bug into Xiang Liu. It had simply been too long since Xiang Liu asked her to fulfill her end of the bargain. She had also seen Fang Feng Bei as real, so their relations.h.i.+p was covered by this tender sweet layer like a gauzy veil. Xiao Yao simply forgot that their relations.h.i.+p was always just a transaction, so no matter what he chose to ask of her, she had no right to be angry.Xiang Liu sat down and started drinking wine and stared at Xiao Yao. There was a conflicted look in his eyes, unclear what he was thinking about.Xiao Yao finally spoke \u201cWhen can I leave? What is your plan?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t answer her question and just tossed a jug of wine to Xiao Yao \u201cThis wine is specially made strong liquor, one sip and it\u2019ll knock a person out.\u201dThere was no brazier lit in the room so Xiao Yao was chilled \u201cNo matter how strong the wine, it won\u2019t let me drink my woes away!\u201dShe picked up the jug and took a big large gulp. The strong wine hit her throat and burned its way down to her belly, instantly warming her body and relaxing her mood.Xiao Yao continued to drink and Xiang Liu kept her company and also silently drank.Xiang Liu suddenly asked \u201cDo you want to marry Feng Long?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s expression changed, she appeared to try and snap herself alert. Xiang Liu\u2019s eyes were piercing bright and his voice tender and soft as he asked \u201cDo you want to marry Ye s.h.i.+ Qi?\u201dXiao Yao murmured \u201cI do.\u201dAnother question was right at the tip of Xiang Liu\u2019s lips but he was actually torn until a moment later he asked \u201cWho do you most want to spend your entire life with?\u201dXiao Yao opened her mouth to answer but her expression showed her internal struggle as her mind refused to let her say what her heart felt.After multiple struggles she became more and more pained and her body began to shake as she clutched her head \u201cHurt\u2026..hurt\u2026..\u201d Xiang Liu had used his power to try and see into Xiao Yao\u2019s heart but Xiao Yao\u2019s mind was too strong willed. If she encountered something that even she refused to think about, then she would unexpectedly oppose answering it and the headache was the result of her refusal to answer the question.Xiang Liu was afraid that she would injure her soul essence so he didn\u2019t dare push her and quickly pulled back his probe and said \u201cIf your head hurts, rest!\u201dXiao Yao wearily rested on the pillow with her forehead furrowed in pain.Xiang Liu covered her with a blanket and Xiao Yao suddenly opened her eyes \u201cWhy?\u201dXiang Liu stared at Xiao Yao and didn\u2019t know exactly what she was asking why about. Was it why he forced her to become a runaway bride? Or was it why he used his powers to probe the true feelings inside her heart?Xiao Yao gave up asking and closed her eyes to murmur \u201cI\u2019m so hurting\u2026\u2026Xiang Liu, I hurt\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s hand pressed on Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead and he said in a low voice \u201cYou\u2019ll forget what just happened and after a good night\u2019s sleep it\u2019ll all be fine!\u201dXiao Yao fell asleep but there was a sardonic smile on her lips as if mocking \u201cEven after a good sleep it won\u2019t all be fine!\u201dWhen Xiao Yao woke up, her head felt like splitting and she sensed something strange happened last night but no matter how much she tried to remember she couldn\u2019t figure it out so she gave up.Perhaps it was due to waking up early today Xiang Liu had already left.Xiao Yao washed up and had breakfast before going to sit in a daze in the courtyard under the sun. The sound of children playing reached her.She opened the courtyard door and saw seven or eight kids playing house. They were currently having a pretend wedding and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but lean against the door and watch them. She suddenly remembered Ma Zi and Chuan Zi, when she found them and brought them back they were about the same age. But they weren\u2019t as noisy back then, they were quiet and fearful, working hard and eating little, afraid she would toss them back out. It wasn\u2019t until after a long time did they believe she and Lao Mu wouldn\u2019t kick them out just to have one less mouth to feed.That was all nearly ninety years ago now! The gra.s.s on Ma Zi and Chuan Zi\u2019s graves had grown multiple times but her memories of them were still so vivid like yesterday.An old woman with a face full of wrinkles and hair all white sat near the wall and watched the kids. She appeared ancient but was full of life still and her clothing was neat and clean. She beamed with happiness as she watched the kids play.The old woman beckoned to Xiao Yao \u201cLittle lady, come here to sit under the sun.\u201dXiao Yao walked over and sat beside the old woman, it was warm with the sensation of the Spring afternoon.The old woman said \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you before? Are you Bao Zhu\u2019s\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know who Bao Zhu was but likely Xiang Liu transformed into a human or his subordinate did so and Bao Zhu must be who the old woman thought was her neighbor. Xiao Yao said \u201cRelative. I recently arrived here.\u201dThe old woman said \u201cAre the kids bothering you? You haven\u2019t had kids yet?\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cWho knows if I\u2019ll have the good fortune to have kids in this lifetime.\u201d She broke off her wedding to the Chi Sui clan leader and ran off with another guy. Likely no man would dare marry her in this lifetime.The old woman said \u201cYou decide if you will have good fortune in your life.\u201dHer words didn\u2019t sound like an uneducated country woman and Xiao Yao glanced at the old woman and then looked around her surroundings. It seemed familiar \u2013 if some arrangements were changed around and the residence smaller and older\u2026..Xiao Yao suddenly asked \u201cIs this Hui Chun Clinic?\u201dThe old woman said \u201cYes!\u201dXiao Yao was startled and then asked \u201cTian Er?\u201dThe old woman was taken aback and sadness flitted across her eyes \u201cSince my Chuan Zi died, it\u2019s been a long time since I heard someone call me that name. How do you know I\u2019m Xan Tian Er?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2026.I heard the old folks in town mention it once.\u201dXan Tian Er laughed \u201cLikely they were gossiping about how I was once a prost.i.tute and doesn\u2019t deserve to live such a good life. But I did live an entire lifetime with Chuan Zi, we had four sons and one daughter, and now I have ten grandson, eight granddaughters, and three great-grandchildren.\u201d\u201cLao Mu, Ma Zi, Chun Tao, how are they\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThey are all gone, I\u2019m the only one left.\u201dXiao Yao was silent for a long time before asking \u201cLao Mu\u2026..how was he when he pa.s.sed?\u201d\u201cLao Mu had no children of his own but Ma Zi and Chuan Zi treated him like their own father. They took care of him until he was old no worse than a real son would have done. Chun Tao and I were also good daughter-in-laws and we took care of Lao Mu until he pa.s.sed with a smile on his face.\u201dXiao Yao smiled, she didn\u2019t make an effort to find out not because she didn\u2019t care, but because she cared too much. Now she knew they lived a good life it was like a dam had broken. Xiao Yao asked Tian Er \u201cDid Chuan Zi ever find fault with you? Did you ever feel unhappy? Did you regret anything in this lifetime?\u201dXan Tian Er felt this girl\u2019s questions were odd but from the first moment she saw her, she felt this strange kins.h.i.+p so she answered \u201cIt\u2019s not like a prost.i.tute with a client, only sweet without the bitter. How could our days together not be stumbling and fumbling at times? After I had two sons, Chuan Zi and I almost broke up but I couldn\u2019t withstand his pleading for forgiveness so we stayed together. But looking back I\u2019m so relieved I didn\u2019t just leave in anger at that time.\u201dTo push a woman who gave birth to two sons to leave, Chuan Zi really must have committed a huge infraction. But mistakes and wrongs can be seen in an instance or viewed in a lifetime. After her life was almost at its end, Xan Tian Er looked back and decided her forgiveness was the right decision. Xiao Yao asked \u201cA person can only see what is right before her, not what is ahead for the lifetime. How does one know that a decision in that moment, even if it\u2019s painful, is the right decision that one won\u2019t regret down the road?\u201dXan Tian Er answered \u201cNot only am I unable to answer your question, even a G.o.d or G.o.ddess living hundreds more years can\u2019t answer it. Isn\u2019t a person\u2019s lifetime like walking a desolate road? No one has walked it before you so each step is stepping on unknown ground. Some walk a road with a good view, others have a poor view. But no matter what the view is, there will always be jagged cliffs, broken paths, dangerous beasts, perhaps one wrong step and one will tumble or maybe one wrong turn and one will head the wrong way. Because it\u2019s a desolate road that is unknown and dangerous, everyone wants to find a companion to walk it with. Another set of eyes, another pair of hands, each taking care of the other. I warn you of a fork in the road, you warn me of a cliff ahead, we hold hands to cross together, joining forces to beat back a dangerous beast\u2026\u2026.two people stumbling and fumbling an entire lifetime together and that\u2019s how it happens.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing.Xan Tian Er appeared to remember something and she squinted her eyes and also said nothing. The sound of children laughing startled Xan Tian Er and she stared at her great-grandchildren with Chuan Zi and smiled \u201cI smiled and I cried in my life, it\u2019s been worth it!\u201dXiao Yao never could have imagined the Xan Tian Er standing at the end of her life would be so content.Xan Tian Er counseled Xiao Yao \u201cLittle lady, you have to remember that whatever you want, you have to believe it exists. If you refuse to believe it, then how can you give your true heart? If you don\u2019t plant the seeds, you can\u2019t have a happy harvest.\u201dThe kids had moved on from the wedding to having kids, the little girl was anxious about not being able to have a \u201cbaby\u201d and the little boy was anxious about going to see the \u201cdoctor\u201d and the \u201cdoctor\u201d gave them medicine wrapped in leaves to go home and \u201cbrew.\u201d The \u201cdoctor\u201d solemnly told the \u201ccouple\u201d that their nightly activities would need to be decreased to every three days and not to rush it in the eagerness to get pregnant.Xiao Yao burst out laughing and Xan Tian Er awkwardly explained \u201cThey play all day in the clinic and eavesdrop on a lot of the adult conversations with patients.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been happy. Today, I\u2019m really happy.\u201dXiang Liu came back and stood beside the tree to watch Xiao Yao and Xan Tian Er.Xiao Yao stood up and stroked Tian Er\u2019s head \u201cTian Er, you did well. I know Chuan Zi must have understood and appreciated that he got a great wife. Lao Mu and I are both very happy.\u201dXiao Yao walked towards Xiang Liu and Xan Tian Er\u2019s voice broke as she called out \u201cYou\u2026.who are you?\u201dXiao Yao turned back and smiled at Xan Tian Er but didn\u2019t answer her question. She and Xiang Liu walked through the copse of trees and disappeared.The tears in Xan Tian Er\u2019s eyes fell and she struggled to stand up so she could kneel and bow in Xiao Yao\u2019s direction.Xiao Yao said to Xiang Liu \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that the kids disturbing me everyday with their loud playing are Ma Zi and Chuan Zi\u2019s grandchildren and great-grandchildren?\u201d Life was so hard to predict, the two quiet little kids she took in years ago now left her a gaggle of loud boisterous offspring to give her a headache.Xiang Liu coolly said \u201cI told you to go out and walk around the first day when we got here, you\u2019re the one who wasn\u2019t interested.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ve been gone for so long now, it must be a mess back there?\u201dXiang Liu said nothing.Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou did what you wanted but you let the Fang Feng family bear the brunt of the consequences. Fang Feng Yi Yang must have to help her family weather the storm, and since she\u2019s now the Tu Shan clan leader\u2019s wife, even the Tu Shan clan has been dragged into it.\u201dXiang Liu coldly laughed \u201cDid you think I kept you from getting married so that Zhuan Xu would get into a tiff with the Four Great Clans? I\u2019ll tell you the truth, that was but half the reason!\u201d\u201cThe other half!\u201d\u201cTu Shan Jing hired me to go stop your wedding. He promised that if I could keep you from getting married, he would give me thirty-seven years worth of army provisions for the soldiers.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. Jing hired Xiang Liu to ruin her wedding?\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me you can go ask Tu Shan Jing yourself.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhen are you going to let me leave?\u201dXiang Liu casually said \u201cI already got what I wanted, you can leave anytime!\u201dXiao Yao turned to leave and Xiang Liu said \u201cA word of reminder, the voodoo bug still connects us so if you tell the world I\u2019m Fang Feng Bei, don\u2019t blame me if I hurt your heart and you die from the pain.\u201dXiao Yao stopped and looked back at Xiang Liu.\u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart was suddenly cut with so much pain like a sword pierced it, the pain so excruciating she fell on the ground in a slump.Xiang Liu appeared to hold her life in his hands and he coldly said \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then don\u2019t say a word!\u201dXiao Yao was in such pain her face was ashen and cold sweat dotted her face. She sat up and smiled \u201cIs this the reason you never had time to go to Jiu Li to break the voodoo bug? You want to control my life and death so that one day you can hold me hostage to your will? General Xiang Liu, you really are something!\u201dXiang Liu smiled and turned to leave. With a whistle his white condor descended and he vaulted on its back and disappeared in the clouds.The pain in Xiao Yao\u2019s heart vanished but it was so painful that her body was still weak and needed some time to recover her strength. After some time, she slowly got up and walked towards town.Qing Shui Town had to have a place where Zhuan Xu collected information. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know where it was and it was even harder for her to know where the Grand Emperor had his secret spies. It was easiest for her to find a Tu Shan clan business and she went into the nearest jewelry store and asked to see Yu s.h.i.+n.The clerk saw Xiao Yao was very forceful so summoned Yu s.h.i.+n out.Xiao Yao said to Yu s.h.i.+n \u201cTake me to Qing Qiu, I want to see Tu Shan Jing.\u201dYu s.h.i.+n noted that Xiao Yao called the clan leader by his full name and wasn\u2019t happy about it. He just smiled and wasn\u2019t going to do anything but Xiao Yao impatiently said \u201cTu Shan Jing will see me! If I\u2019m lying, you will only make a useless trip and I\u2019m in your hands and you can punish me however you want. But if what I say is true and you turn me down, you\u2019ll upset Tu Shan Jing.\u201dYu s.h.i.+n lived in the world of jewelry and saw many customers and was good at discerning those with power. He made a decision and summoned a cloud carriage to take him and Xiao Yao to Qing Qiu.On the cloud carriage, Yu s.h.i.+n asked Xiao Yao \u201cWhy do you want to see the clan leader?\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her brows and said nothing. Why? She had so many whys to ask Jing! Why stop her wedding? Why hire Xiang Liu? Why? Why?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone wanted to see the clan leader so he brought her here? Yu s.h.i.+n carefully explained \u201cI know it\u2019s crazy but that girl really is very unique, even for me who has seen many kinds of people\u2026..\u201dJing Ye asked \u201cWhat is her name?\u201d It couldn\u2019t be that Princess who eloped with another man on her wedding day, could it? The Yellow Emperor, the Black Emperor, the Grand Emperor, the entire vast wilderness was abuzz looking for her but she suddenly vanished without a trace.\u201cI don\u2019t know, she won\u2019t tell me anything. She just said the clan leader would see her. Oh right, she has a red peach blossom birthmark on her forehead.\u201dJing Ye immediately said \u201cHurry, hurry and bring me to see her.\u201dYu s.h.i.+n noticed her reaction and knew he did the right thing. He let out a sigh of relief and knew what to do next \u201cI worried Miss would want to see her so I have her waiting outside in the carriage!\u201dJing Ye said to Yu s.h.i.+n \u201cGo outside and quietly bring the carriage in. Remember, quietly!\u201dYu s.h.i.+n nodded.The carriage quietly entered the Tu Shan clan residence and Jing Ye saw Xiao Yao step off the carriage. She sighed in relief but also worry. The entire world was looking for her but she came to Qing Qiu. What was she thinking?Jing Ye walked up to bow \u201cPlease\u2026.my lady will you please wash up and change. Rest a bit and I will go report to the clan leader.\u201dXiao Yao felt dirty and tired so she nodded and followed two maids to wash up.When Xiao Yao left Qing Shui Town, she was furious and wanted to demand to know why Jing paid Xiang Liu to stop her wedding. She wanted to know why he would shame her like that. But the cloud carriage winged horses were not the best so the trip took over two days, and by then Xiao Yao\u2019s anger had dissipated and now she felt resigned. What could she do even after she found out why? Even if Jing did it, what could she do to him? She couldn\u2019t kill him.Xiao Yao started to regret this trip. She really had her brain fried in anger by Xiang Liu. How could she just storm here to Qing Qiu like this?Xiao Yao hid in the bath and wouldn\u2019t go out. The maids didn\u2019t rush her and would occasionally call out to make sure she didn\u2019t faint in there.Xiao Yao bathed for two hours and she decided in the end that she couldn\u2019t hide forever. She toweled off and changed into fresh clothes and walked outside to find Jing waiting for her in the room. People here had powers so could dispel the cold but Xiao Yao\u2019s powers were weak so the room had a lot of braziers placed around it in case Xiao Yao was cold.The room felt muggy so when Xiao Yao walked in Jing immediately stood up but she ignored him and went to open the window. Jing quickly said \u201cYour hair is not dry yet, you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201dJing wanted to close the window but Xiao Yao yelled \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201dJing quickly pulled the window so that only a small slit was open. Xiao Yao wanted to lose her temper but found that she couldn\u2019t. Jing placed a brazier right behind Xiao Yao and then handed her a cup of magnolia flower tea for her to sip. After she drank the tea she asked \u201cYou\u2019re not going to ask me where I went for for the past month and more with Fang Feng Bei?\u201dJing said \u201cI know Fang Feng Bei is Xiang Liu, he ought to have taken you to the Sheng Nong resistance army base in the mountains.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Zhuan Xu\u2019s little sister, he would take me to the Sheng Nong resistance army base? You think he\u2019s an idiot?\u201d Xiao Yao angrily yelled \u201cI was in Qing Shui Town this entire time, right next door to Hui Chun Clinic.\u201dJing was taken aback, Qing Shui Town was filled with all sorts of people. How could Xiao Yao have stayed there for over a month and no one spotted her?Xiao Yao said \u201cI never left the house, it wasn\u2019t until the last day that I discovered I was living next door to Hui Chun Clinic.\u201dJing asked \u201cYou saw Xan Tian Er?\u201dXiao Yao was shocked, Jing\u2019s question meant he knew only Tian Er was still alive. Xiao Yao said \u201cI saw her.\u201dJing said \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Lao Mu and them all pa.s.sed in peace.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..you always kept an eye on them?\u201dJing nodded \u201cWhen Lao Mu was on his death bed, I went to see him and told him that Xiao Liu was fine and for him not to worry.\u201dThe final bit of anger inside Xiao Yao vanished and she stared at the cup of tea in her hand in a daze until she finally calmly spoke \u201cXiang Liu said that you gave him a lot of money to hire him to prevent me from marrying Feng Long.\u201d\u201cI did do it, but I never could have imagined that Xiang Liu was so extreme in how he did things.\u201d\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d\u201cThat day, on the streets of Qing Qiu, you told me you were getting married but there wasn\u2019t a hint of happiness in your eyes. No one forced you so why are you forcing yourself to marry Feng Long. I\u2026.I couldn\u2019t let you marry Feng Long like that. I begged him to cancel the wedding but he said no. I wanted to find you but I knew I was pouring oil on the flame. Right when I was at wits end, I ran into Fang Feng Bei. I remembered that you promised to do one thing for Xiang Liu as the price for breaking the voodoo bug in Zhuan Xu. Since Zhuan Xu became Emperor, the provisions have been scarce in the army base so I discussed a deal with Xiang Liu to buy the promise you made to him. I asked him to beg you to cancel the wedding. But I couldn\u2019t have imagined that he would show up at the actual wedding ceremony to ask you to fulfill your promise. It was my fault, Xiao Yao I\u2019m sorry!\u201dXiao Yao coolly said \u201cNothing to be sorry about, it was a willing transaction between us all. My deal with Xiang Liu was fair and willing, your deal with Xiang Liu is also fair and willing. But I hope that you will never get involved in my life again! Whether I\u2019m happy or not has nothing to do with you!\u201dXiao Yao felt her coming to Qing Qiu was ridiculous but now that she said her piece, she had nothing else left to stay for so she stood up to say her farewell to leave. Jing jumped up and blocked the door while calling \u201cXiao Yao\u2026..\u201d while his body shook like he was about to keel over.Xiao Yao quickly a.s.sisted him and took a look at his ill visage and wanted to take his pulse.Jing pushed her hand aside \u201cI\u2019m fine! It\u2019s dark now so please stay one night, you can leave in the morning. If you don\u2019t want to see me, I\u2019ll leave immediately.\u201d Jing\u2019s face was stark white which made his eyes even darker, there appeared a million things he wanted to say but couldn\u2019t and it all turned to despair.Xiao Yao remembered what Xan Tian Er said and sighed before sitting down \u201cI\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao for a moment and then sadly said \u201cI\u2019m leaving, you rest well and Jing Ye will keep watch outside. If you need anything let her know.\u201dJing walked to the door when Xiao Yao suddenly said \u201cI have something to say to you.\u201dJing turned and quietly waited.Xiao Yao pointed to the pallet \u201cPlease sit.\u201dJing sat down across from Xiao Yao as she stared at the smoke wafting from the brazier and didn\u2019t say anything for a few moments.Jing quietly watched Xiao Yao and wished this moment could go on forever.Xiao Yao said \u201cAll these years, I\u2019ve not slept well and constantly think about the past.\u201dJing was shocked, he hadn\u2019t slept one night well all these years either and constantly thought about the past. But Xiao Yao appeared fine so Jing thought she had totally gotten over him.Xiao Yao said \u201cFang Feng Yi Yang is underhanded but you also gave her the chance. In the beginning I said it was fine and I didn\u2019t care, but I hated you and resented you deep down. So at each occasion, I would either avoid you or act like I was fine. I never let you see that I was still affected by you, but I always took note of your reactions.\u201dJing said \u201cI know, I was wrong.\u201d Back then he thought Fang Feng Yi Yang was innocent and it was the Tu Shan clan that wronged her. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her but then he forgot that by doing so then he ended up hurting Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao said \u201cYou were wrong but it wasn\u2019t only your fault. All these years I\u2019ve been diligently learning medicine and my att.i.tude has changed a lot and the way I see things. I discovered that it wasn\u2019t right for me to blame it all on you.\u201d\u201cNo, you were always good to me\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao gestured for Jing to be silent and let her finish \u201cXan Tian Er said that a person\u2019s life was liking walking a mountain road with no clue what to expect. People want a partner for the walk to a.s.sist and help. I promised to walk the road with you but I was always pessimistically waiting. It was like if we went to climb a mountain and agreed to do it together, but when I saw you heading down the wrong path, I didn\u2019t stop you and let you continue the wrong way. So I saw a drop and didn\u2019t help you from falling and instead stood to the side watching coldly.\u201dXiao Yao asked Jing \u201cDid you know that Fang Feng Yi Yang tried many times to kill Zhuan Xu? One time she even shot an arrow into his chest.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Jing looked shocked.Xiao Yao said \u201cFang Feng Yi Yang was always polite and well-mannered in front of you, gentle and sweet, but I knew from the very beginning that she was calculating and deadly. I also knew you were soft-hearted and felt apologetic to her. Fang Feng Yi Yang was sure to use your personality and your regret against you. But I did nothing, I didn\u2019t even warn you. I stood to the side and watched. My childhood made me pessimistic about human emotions, I feel like nothing will last forever and no one can be relied on. I never truly believed in you and I didn\u2019t want to make the effort first. So when what I expected happened, I felt like it was exactly as I predicted! I know people can\u2019t be trusted! But I didn\u2019t know that what we put in is what we get back. We need to make the effort to achieve the ending we want. Xan Tian Er said that I never planted the seeds and tilled the field, how can I expect to reap the crop in the end?\u201dThere were tears in Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes \u201cEvery night I think about the fault and knew that I was wrong. My own pessimistic personality and att.i.tude, my own distrust of others, it caused me to lose the man I like. If I made a bit more effort, said more or did more, perhaps the result would be completely different. Zhuan Xu thought I couldn\u2019t get over it because I hated you, but in truth it\u2019s because I can\u2019t forgive myself. Jing, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty anymore. The world thinks we\u2019re both very smart and calculating but when it came to our feelings and relations.h.i.+p, we both made mistakes. A person can make mistakes that can fixed, other times it can never be fixed\u2026\u2026.\u201dEvery night when she woke up from her dreams, she knew she was wrong but it was too late to fix. That pain was like a saw cutting through her bones. But it was all too late\u2026\u2026..Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell and she turned around to use her sleeve to wipe her tears but it fell more and more.Jing was so anxious he grabbed her \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026.don\u2019t cry! You did nothing wrong, I promised to make the effort and to have faith in you and to protect you, but I didn\u2019t do it.\u201dXiao Yao leaned her head on his shoulder and cried soundlessly. In the thousands of nights in the dark, she hated Fang Feng Yi Yang, hated Jing, and in the end, hated herself.Jing felt like a knife was cutting his heart when he heard Xiao Yao crying. This was the first time she ever cried for him. When she heard Yi Yang was pregnant, she smiled at him. If he could choose again, he would rather that she act like she didn\u2019t care, he would rather that she really forgot him. He didn\u2019t want Xiao Yao to be as pained and tormented as him.Jing softly stroked her back \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026..\u201d He kept murmuring her name over and over, like him calling her every night as he missed her and thought of her but could never touch her.Xiao Yao hit Jing hard and cried \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let me get married? Why can\u2019t you let me act like I\u2019m fine and keep walking forward with a smile?\u201dJing couldn\u2019t answer. Why? Perhaps it was Xiao Yao\u2019s look of sadness as she stood on the streets of Qing Qiu. He didn\u2019t want her entire life to be like that. Perhaps he loved her too deeply and couldn\u2019t let her marry another man. Perhaps deep inside his heart was a sliver of undying hope.Jing said \u201cI apologized earlier but I take it back now. I don\u2019t regret it at all, even Xiang Liu using such an extreme means that caused the entire vast wilderness to descend into chaos, I\u2019m still very happy that you didn\u2019t marry Feng Long.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..you b.a.s.t.a.r.d!\u201d Xiao Yao cried as she kept hitting him.Jing smiled \u201cI always was a b.a.s.t.a.r.d!\u201dXiao Yao cried until she let out all the years of tamped down anguish and gradually regained her clarity. She realized she was in Jing\u2019s arm and forcefully pushed him away.Jing didn\u2019t force her and got up to bring her another cup of hot tea \u201cDrink some water.\u201dXiao Yao took the cup and felt so embarra.s.sed and shy, not able to look Jing in the eyes. What did she just say? She was the one who said they were now strangers, yet she just cried buckets of tears in his arms.Xiao Yao\u2019s att.i.tude turned cool and she said \u201cI said what I wanted to say so you can go now. Tomorrow I\u2019ll go back to Sheng Nong Mountain and you don\u2019t need to see me off.\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao and said nothing. It took ten years for Xiao Yao to finally lose her composure and the tears were still in the corner of her eyes but she was once again calm and rational. This time she said the final things she needed to say, after this parting he likely would never see her again.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cWrong is wrong, even regret can\u2019t change things. I will try hard to forget and keep on walking forward for your sake and for mine. Let\u2019s not see each other ever again!\u201dBecause he correctly guessed what Xiao Yao would say, Jing actually smiled and said \u201cHave dinner first and afterwards I have something to say to you.\u201dXiao Yao was about to turn him down when Jing added \u201cI listened to what you had to say, you ought to listen to me as well. That\u2019s only fair.\u201dXiao Yao neither said yes nor said no.Jing Ye brought porridge and served Xiao Yao a bowl and then served Jing a bowl.Xiao Yao hadn\u2019t eaten properly these past few days so smelling the delicious food she was genuinely starved and focused on eating.Jing also lowered his head to eat, all these years he never had an appet.i.te to taste good food but right now he felt the porridge was delicious and had two bowls with Xiao Yao.Jing Ye saw the entire pot was eaten and sighed internally, feeling both happy and said. She collected the dishes and retreated from the room.After Jing Ye left, Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201dJing said \u201cPromise me that whatever I say, you\u2019ll have the patience to hear me out. Don\u2019t leave in a huff.\u201d\u201cI promise, so say it!\u201d Xiao Yao decided that after tomorrow she would never see Jing again and since this was their last night in each other\u2019s presence, whatever Jing had to say then she would listen to it.Jing said \u201cSince Yi Yang and I\u2026..had that happen, I always felt dejectedly dazed. I let my grandmother arranged everything and the only demand I had was that I would never see Yi Yang. But with the wedding done and she was pregnant, Yi Yang didn\u2019t care either. It wasn\u2019t until my sister-in-law died that I snapped out of it and started to see what was going on.\u201dXiao Yao was perplexed, she remembered that quiet woman who allegedly killed herself because Hou had an affair with another woman. What did that have to do with Jing?\u201cMy sister-in-law and Jing Ye, Lan Xiang, they all entered the residence at the same time. Because she was very gentle, my grandmother had her a.s.signed to serve my brother. I\u2019ve known her also since we were small. She might be very reticent but she loved to smile and was very generous with others. Jing Ye and Lan Xiang were both good friends with her. My mother married her to my brother and she became more and more quiet and withdrawn until I never saw her smile again. I knew my brother was cold towards her but I could do nothing other than secretly take care of her a bit. When Jing Ye had free time, I had her go visit my sister-in-law. She rarely spoke to me likely knowing it would upset my brother. But every Spring, if I\u2019m in the residence, would she would hand a silver blossom to Jing Ye to place in my study. The flower is beautiful and grows on Qing Qiu hill. I remember going with my brother and the maids to see it when we were all little. My sister-in-law appeared slow but actually she knew everything. She gave me the flower likely to thank me and also to beg me not to forget my childhood affection for my brother and to forgive him\u2026..\u201d Jing grew silent \u201cMy sister-in-law didn\u2019t kill herself by ingesting poison, she was murdered.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who killed your sister-in-law?\u201d Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t believe it. Regardless of her low birth, she was still the first wife of the Tu Shan clan son, who dared to do that to her?\u201cFang Feng Yi Yang.\u201dXiao Yao was so shocked she was speechless. She was confused but believed that Fang Feng Yi Yang could do something like that.\u201cAfter my sister-in-law died, I started to really take a look at my situation with Fang Feng Yi Yang. I tried to recollect that night and even used a highly powered fox demon to hypnotize me and bring forth my hidden memories. But I could never remember that night. All my memory was being in a daze and mistaking Yi Yang for you and you took off your clothes and embraced me and wanted to make love, but I tried hard to push you away\u2026\u2026\u2026and then I remembered nothing.\u201dWhen Jing spoke he kept watching Xiao Yao, afraid she would leave in anger but luckily she kept her promise and remained silently listening.Jing said \u201cMy powers may not be as high as Xiang Liu, Feng Long and those top warriors in the vast wilderness, but I\u2019m still the descendant of the nine-tailed fox. I learned my powers from childhood so it\u2019s not low. A love potion can\u2019t work on people like us, all it does is increase an existing urge but it wouldn\u2019t be able to render me unable to control my urges.\u201dXiao Yao nodded, it was true. To the G.o.ds, forget Jing, even giving a love potion to those sleazebags like Cui Liang, they won\u2019t be rendered unable to control themselves. A bucket of water could break the spell, they simply didn\u2019t want to control themselves.Jing saw that Xiao Yao agreed with his conclusion and continued \u201cYi Yang must know that so she knew the love potion couldn\u2019t make me\u2026.sleep with her. So she had my grandmother put a mystifying spell on me so that I mistook her for you. But Yi Yang doesn\u2019t know how much you mean to me. Because that person is you, I would never ever sleep with you under those circ.u.mstances.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cEven if I threw myself at you and you still wouldn\u2019t?\u201dJing said \u201cIf you threw yourself at me, I would control myself even more. If you are willing it means you trust me, so I will try even harder not to let you down and give you everything you deserve. Xiao Yao, back then Yi Yang tried to kill herself and I went to see her, but that was another woman\u2019s room and another woman\u2019s bed. I want to be with you openly and legitimately, how could I have slept with you just like that on another woman\u2019s bed? That would be shaming and hurting you! No matter how confused I was, I firmly believe I would never betray my deepest convictions.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing. She experienced Zhuan Xu detoxing from the drugs and he was in such pain he wanted to ram a wall. But the moment he hurt her then Zhuan Xu would immediately retreat.Xiao Yao knew medicines and the spell could only arouse what was deep inside, but she also believed Jing deeply respected her and would never sleep with her on another woman\u2019s bed.Xiao Yao asked \u201cSo you deduced that the situation is suspect, but I heard from my Xi Ling clan leader uncle that your son looks a lot like you and also like his grandfather.\u201dJing said \u201cIf he looks like his grandfather, then he will of course look like me.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t get it right away and couldn\u2019t understand the difference between what she said and what Jing just said.\u201dJing said \u201cMy grandmother said that both my brother and I look like our dad. Especially my brother, he closely resembles our dad.\u201dAn understanding thundered through Xiao Yao\u2019s brain and she was rendered speechless. Many moments later, Xiao Yao slowly asked \u201cAre you saying Yi Yang\u2019s son doesn\u2019t look like you, he looks like Hou?\u201d\u201cMy brother and the maid who served my sister-in-law said that she killed herself after confronting my brother about his affair and he slapped her. That year when my mom forced my brother to marry her, my grandmother didn\u2019t object but also gave him a lot of concubines. My sister-in-law accepted and endured all that, why would she have a fight with my brother over a woman he had outside? Even if she wanted to raise a fuss, with her personality she would ask to see me as clan leader and ask me to rationally take her side. I know her death is suspect because before she died she wanted to see me. But I wasn\u2019t home at that time and by the time I rushed back, she was dead and my brother took care of everything. I couldn\u2019t find any clues in my investigation. In the years before my grandmother died, I didn\u2019t get to speak with my sister-in-law a lot despite seeing her often since my brother or Yi Yang would always be there. The one time is the day before my grandmother died, I brought Zhen Er to my grandmother\u2019s room and saw my sister-in-law there. As I was leaving, she leaned close and said \u201cZhen Er looks so much like his grandfather.\u201d My grandmother and all the elders constantly noted that so I didn\u2019t pay attention. But after she died I realized what she said was odd. It wasn\u2019t weird for my grandmother to say it, but when my sister-in-law arrived in the residence my dad already died. She never saw my dad before, how could she say the boy looks like his grandfather?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIf your sister-in-law really was killed because she knew something, then she was already being spied on at that time so she could only hint at you by saying that.\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for clues all these years but have found nothing. I\u2019m blood brothers with my brother so even if the son is his, it\u2019s the same bloodline and even a mystical object cannot tell the difference.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s mind was all jumbled\u2026\u2026Back then Hou battled for the clan leader position nearly to the death with Jing, and even threw his support behind Yu Yang and Cang Lin and opposed Zhuan Xu. But then he gave up just like that and even swore a blood oath not to hurt Jing. If Yi Yang\u2019s child was Hou\u2019s, then it all made sense. Who cares if Jing became clan leader, in the end the position would fall to Hou\u2019s own son.Hou swore a blood oath not to hurt Jing but Yi Yang didn\u2019t. If they wanted to, Yi Yang could try and kill Jing anytime\u2026..This plot must have been plotted for a long time by Hou and Yi Yang and pushed forward with the Grand Madam\u2019s illness. They were seamless and until they killed Jing, they would never meet alone and even acted like they couldn\u2019t stand each other so the world would never discover this secret.Xiao Yao shuddered, if it wasn\u2019t for the last few years with the Yellow Emperor abdicating, Zhuan Xu taking the throne, Xuan Yuan moving capitals, so much happening all at once, would Yi Yang have already attempted to kill Jing?That timid thoughtful kind generous girl, she must have known about their plot and couldn\u2019t keep silent any longer and wanted to warn Jing so she was killed by Hou and Yi Yang.Jing said \u201cAll these years I\u2019ve done nothing but have secretly kept an eye on them. But they are too calculating and Yi Yang publicly opposes my giving power to Hou and Hou would also complain about Yi Yang having too much power to the elders. Everyone thinks they don\u2019t get along so to say they are having an affair would be like the sun rising from the West. I can\u2019t give you proof of my suspicions right now but I\u2019ll continue to look for evidence and clear my name.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cRemember that big a.s.sa.s.sination attempt on you years ago?\u201d\u201cWhen the a.s.sa.s.sins attacked my body double?\u201d\u201cYes! Back then both you and Feng Long noted that it wasn\u2019t like Hou\u2019s personality to do that, Feng Long said it appeared to be the actions of a really p.i.s.sed off woman yet Hou admitted he did it.\u201d\u201cI thought about that, right before the a.s.sa.s.sination was when I told Yi Yang that I liked someone else and asked her to end the engagement. Likely that p.i.s.sed her off and she probably ordered the a.s.sa.s.sination on her own. Hou was afraid I would investigate and lead to her so openly admitted that he did it.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cEven without definitive proof, there are so many suspicious hints that I actually believe you.\u201dJing\u2019s impa.s.sive face broke into an open smile, the kind that was like a dying person getting another chance at life but was hard pressed to be truly happy in the face of enduring so much.Xiao Yao said \u201cDon\u2019t be rash now, if they suspect you cottoned onto them, then likely you\u2019ll never be able to get proof. If you act, then you have to strike dead center. But you must be careful!\u201d Xiao Yao thanked Jing\u2019s sister-in-law in her heart, if it wasn\u2019t for her then Jing would have likely been killed already.Jing said \u201cAfter my sister-in-law died, I\u2019ve been exceedingly on guard towards my brother and Yi Yang, don\u2019t worry.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart hurt, how did Jing live all these years. With so much turmoil in the vast wilderness, as clan leader he needed to take each step carefully and needed the support of his family the most, yet his brother and his wife both wanted him dead.Xiao Yao asked \u201cAfter your sister-in-law died and you became suspicious, how come you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201cWithout evidence, if you\u2019ve already moved on then why do I need to involve you anymore. Knowing after tonight that you still\u2026..I thought things can\u2019t possibly get worse so decided to just tell you!\u201dJing Ye knocked and brought in a plate \u201cMaster, please take your medicine.\u201dJing crushed the pills and took the medicine with warm water.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but ask \u201cWhat is your illness?\u201d\u201cNot a big illness, just managing my health.\u201dJing Ye interrupted \u201cMaster almost died ten years ago of heart break. And all these years, because of Princess, he can\u2019t sleep and can\u2019t eat, it\u2019s all in his heart. Three months ago Princess came to Qing Qiu to deliver a wedding announcement and invited Master to the wedding. It caused him to fall ill and he hasn\u2019t gotten better\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cJing Ye!\u201d Jing\u2019s voice was filled with censure.Jing Ye had tears in her eyes and glared at Xiao Yao before leaving.Xiao Yao watched Jing who said \u201cIt\u2019s not as serious as Jing Ye claims.\u201d\u201cGive me your hand.\u201dJing didn\u2019t move so Xiao Yao stared until he finally moved his hand over.Xiao Yao placed a finger on his wrist and after a moment her face fell and she pulled her hand back without saying a word. She had no many thoughts in her mind but in the face of death nothing else mattered.Likely Jing already heard from Hu Zhen his real condition so he didn\u2019t need to hear from Xiao Yao and smiled \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019ll get better slowly.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s spirit was low but she forced a smile \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, yes.\u201dJing asked \u201cHow\u2019s your health all these years?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, I don\u2019t sleep well at night but it\u2019s not as bad as you. You have many things to worry about during the day. I\u2019ve nothing to worry about since Zhuan Xu took the throne and can stay in bed for as late as I want. And no one will come bug me every few days to annoy me.\u201dJing couldn\u2019t help but laugh \u201cIf I hurt and you feel better, I actually feel better as well.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if it was hate or anger, at least she still cared.Xiao Yao said \u201cYou don\u2019t know that I felt better then.\u201d\u201cAt least it\u2019s not too late that I know now.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing, even believing nothing happened between Jing and Yi Yang, and the child was Hou\u2019s, did that mean she could start over again with Jing?Jing didn\u2019t dare to hope and he was already thrilled that Xiao Yao believed him. Before he resolved his mess, he didn\u2019t dare say anything or hope for anything.Xiao Yao asked \u201cFeng Long\u2026.is he alright?\u201d\u201cHe appears fine but he\u2019s proud and always gets his way so this was his greatest failure in his entire life. He\u2019s forcing himself to be fine and I worried that if he couldn\u2019t find Fang Feng Bei then he would take it out on the Fang Feng family. So I told him that I ordered Fang Feng Bei to ruin the wedding.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yao nervously stared at Jing \u201cYou guys\u2026.fought again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fighting this time, he really wanted to kill me. My guards held him back but he\u2019s currently severed our friends.h.i.+p.\u201d\u201cWhy did you admit to it? The Tu Shan clan will protect the Fang Feng family no matter what anyways.\u201d\u201cFeng Long is my brother, and because my thoughtlessness caused Xiang Liu to create a scene, I feel guilt towards him. I can\u2019t also continue to keep the truth from him so that he ends up hating the wrong person.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cTo Feng Long, a woman is just like his clothes and can be changed. You\u2019ve been friends with him since childhood, after some time he\u2019ll forgive you. But towards me, he\u2019s likely forever going to hate.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is just one embarra.s.sment and even if he can\u2019t let it go in a few months, but after a few years and with his open-natured personality, he\u2019ll get over it.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, no matter what she did now Feng Long won\u2019t accept it so there was nothing else for her to do now.The two of them silently stared at each other, like there was more to say but what they wanted to say had all been said.Jing stood up \u201cIt\u2019s late, you get some rest!\u201dThat night Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know if Jing slept well but she couldn\u2019t sleep. The thought about Jing\u2019s health, Yi Yang and Hou, about what to do from now on\u2026\u2026At dawn Xiao Yao rose to wash.Jing arrived shortly thereafter and after they breakfasted, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t say she was leaving but Jing knew that her time here was coming to an end.Xiao Yao said to Jing \u201cI want to take a good look at your health today. I\u2019ve been learning medicine carefully these past few years and yesterday when I took your pulse, I discovered something troubling about your health. Luckily there is still time so don\u2019t worry\u2026\u2026\u201dJing casually said \u201cI was never worried, if you don\u2019t want to heal me then I don\u2019t care if I live or die. I know I\u2019ll get better now.\u201dXiao Yao calmed herself and asked \u201cIs Hu Zhen still your doctor? Have him join us!\u201dHu Zhun arrived and Xiao Yao took Jing\u2019s pulse and asked about his daily routine and food intake. Some questions Jing answered and others he needed to ask Jing Ye and Hu Zhen.Xiao Yao asked what medicine Hu Zhen was currently prescribing and then discussed it with Hu Zhen.Hu Zhen listened to Xiao Yao\u2019s suggestions and changed some medicinal ingredients and decreased the dosage but increased the frequency.Hu Zhen solemnly said \u201cThe clan leader\u2019s illness from forty years ago never was properly treated and now it\u2019s gotten much worse. Princess your idea is great but requires long term care for about ten to twenty years. Princess you really suggest this?\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t respond.Jing said to Hu Zhen \u201cEverything according to Xiao Yao\u2019s suggestion.\u201dHu Zhen bowed \u201cYes!\u201dXiao Yao said to Jing \u201cAnother matter, I want to see your closest servants.\u201dJing said to Jing Ye \u201cBring Hu Ya and Ling here.\u201dBoth were startled and then Jing Ye softly replied \u201cYes!\u201dXiao Yao had seen Hu Ya before but it was her first time meeting Ling, she was a very ephemeral girl, her visage like a shadow and her face impossible to see clearly.Jing Ye explained \u201cLing is a very powerful fox demon and the head of the clan leader personal guards. She never sees anyone.\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Jing \u201cI want to speak privately with them, can I?\u201dJing placed a spell around Xiao Yao and walked aside.Xiao Yao bowed to Hu Ya, Jing Ye, Hu Ya, and Ling. Hu Ya, Hu Zhen, and Jing Ye bowed back but Ling avoided Xiao Yao\u2019s bow and also didn\u2019t bow back.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to say is odd but please remember it.\u201dJing Ye said \u201cPrincess please speak.\u201d\u201cFang Feng Yi Yang will likely try to kill Jing.\u201dAll four stared at Xiao Yao who continued \u201cYou are all Jing\u2019s personal servants so you know his relations.h.i.+p with Yi Yang. If anything happened to Jing, then Yi Yang\u2019s son will become the next clan leader and at his young age, Yi Yang would effectively be ruling the Tu Shan clan.\u201dThe four gaped and Jing Ye said \u201cWhat else does the Princess know?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll try to kill Jing or how she\u2019ll attempt it but I am positive she will do it. You must protect Jing well at that time.\u201dHu Ya said \u201cPrincess, that is our job.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cAnd Tu Shan Hou, you also know about him and have been on guard against him but it\u2019s not enough! You must all be on guard even more, likely Fang Feng Yi Yang and Tu Shan Hou will work together to kill Jing.\u201dJing Ye was shocked \u201cThat can\u2019t be, the Madam and the Eldest Master hate each other.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe but there is no harm to be more careful! The worst is when the unexpected happens! You must all be alert and on guard.\u201dHu Ya said \u201cPrincess don\u2019t worry, we will remember it.\u201d\u201cPlease do so!\u201d Xiao Yao bowed to all four of them again.This time all four bowed back and Jing Ye said \u201cThank you Princess for the warning.\u201dXiao Yao said to Jing \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201dJing was standing with his back to them so Xiao Yao walked over and tapped him on the shoulder. Jing turned around \u201cDone?\u201dThe four all stepped aside.Xiao Yao said to Jing \u201cI told them all to be careful about Fang Feng Yi Yang.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to say it in front of Jing not to keep it from him but so he didn\u2019t feel even worse.\u201dXiao Yao reminded Jing \u201cYou also need to be more on guard, normal poisons can\u2019t harm you and the poisons that can harm a G.o.d must be ingested to hit all the vital organs so don\u2019t eat or drink anything you don\u2019t know where it came from.\u201dJing smiled \u201cI got it!\u201dJing Ye knocked on the door \u201cThe Black Emperor sent a messenger asking of the clan leader has news about the Princess.\u201dJing sighed, in just one night and half a day, Zhuan Xu was already aware.Xiao Yao knew Zhuan Xu would have someone watching the Tu Shan clan and Yu s.h.i.+n\u2019s actions were odd so it was normal Zhuan Xu would follow up.Xiao Yao said to Jing Ye \u201cHave them wait a bit.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Yao said to Jing \u201cI need to go.\u201dJing felt reluctant but knew he had no right to keep her.Xiao Yao walked out and said \u201cYou are kind and loving and it\u2019s not a personality flaw but faced with Yi Yang and Hou then it becomes a weakness.\u201dJing said \u201cI understand, it all stops now and I won\u2019t retreat anymore.\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201dJing walked her to the front door and Xiao Yao said \u201cNo need to send me off, Jing Ye will lead me out.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Jing stopped Xiao Yao and took out the fish amethyst from his waist and handed it to her.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t accept it nor did she reject it.Jing said \u201cThis is my payment for the medical consult, will the Princess please accept.\u201dXiao Yao thought and said \u201cIf I accept then I have to fully cure your illness.\u201dJing said \u201cI will do as the doctor says and take care of myself. After some time I will go to Zhi Yi castle and ask the Princess to continue to treat me.\u201dXiao Yao took the fish amethyst and walked away without saying a word.Jing let out a pent up breath, as long as she was willing to see him even if just as a patient then he was happy.On the way back to Shen Nong Mountain, Xiao Yao kept thinking of how Zhuan Xu will deal with her.Furious? Definitely. Angry? Absolutely.She tossed such a mess to Zhuan Xu and it would be shocking if he wasn\u2019t furious and angry! But if was over a month ago and his initial rage was likely calmed by now and he was left with ha.s.sles that were annoying and tedious to deal with.The cloud carriage landed on Xiao Yue Summit and Xiao Yao saw Zhuan Xu immediately as she got off.Zhuan Xu appeared very calm but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare press her luck so she put on a big smile and walked toward him while sweetly calling \u201cGege.\u201dZhuan Xu glared at her for a second before coolly said \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dXiao Yao followed behind him and snuck looks at him but it wasn\u2019t clear what Zhuan Xu was thinking. It was impossible to tell his mood and Xiao Yao once again was reminded that the Zhuan Xu now was the Black Emperor who owned half the world.There were lots of snow collected in the canyons and because few pa.s.sed through there were no marks on the snow. It was a clear and pristine blanket of white and gave one the urge to leave an imprint on it.Xiao Yao would periodically kneel down to leave her hand prints quickly in the snow and Zhuan Xu continued to ignore her but his footsteps slowed.After pa.s.sing through another white snowy area, Xiao Yao bent down and used her hands to pat the snow and creates tens of interlocking hand prints. She then drew a long line down the middle so it looked like a tree branch.Xiao Yao looked up at Zhuan Xu \u201cGege.\u201dZhuan Xu bent down and left tens of hand prints next to Xiao Yao\u2019s and added a few lines, creating a mulberry tree on the snow. When they were small they often drew in the snow and using their hand prints to create a mulberry tree was something Zhuan Xu taught Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao smiled and put her face right next to his \u201cStill angry?\u201dZhuan Xu coolly said \u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d On the day Xiao Yao was supposed to get married, he sat alone in the phoenix tree forest surrounded by silence and desolation. When he heard Xiao Yao ran away from her wedding, his eyes lighted up in uncontrollable joy.\u201cFeng Long\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019m here so you don\u2019t need to worry about him! From now on, just think of him as someone with no connection to you.\u201d\u201cI feel like I wronged him.\u201d\u201cNo need, I already compensated him and all he\u2019ll have to endure is a few months of gossip. It\u2019s hard to endure now but when he\u2019s in possession of great power and his beauties in his arm, the world will forget that joke of a wedding.\u201dXiao Yao quizzically stared \u201cI left you with such a mess to clean up and I thought you would be furious with me!\u201d In the past when she left to play with Fang Feng Bei for a few days time, Zhuan Xu would be p.i.s.sed at her for days afterwards.Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and pulled her up from the snow and used his hand to warm hers \u201cDo you want me to punish you?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head, grateful that Zhuan Xu was being lenient and she had no desire to bring trouble on herself.Zhuan Xu said \u201cLet\u2019s hurry, don\u2019t catch a chill.\u201dZhuan Xu pulled Xiao Yao behind him and quickly walked but then Xiao Yao started laughing and ran ahead to pull Zhuan Xu behind her as she ran.The two laughed as they ran until they arrived in the bamboo hut and Xiao Yao quickly took off her boots and jumped inside to call out \u201cI\u2019m home!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled as he languidly took off his shoes and stepped inside.The Yellow Emperor walked out and Xiao Yao immediately stopped smiling and nervously ducked behind Zhuan Xu. The world was afraid of the Yellow Emperor but she never was, until now because this time she did something wrong so she actually was a little bit afraid of him.Zhuan Xu smiled but liking this very much so he just bowed to the Yellow Emperor and dragged Xiao Yao to sit down. He shoved a hand warmer in her lap for her to hold.The Yellow Emperor stared at Xiao Yao with his brows furrowed.Xiao Yao slowly scooted behind Zhuan Xu, desperately wanting to completely disappear behind his back.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou have the guts to run away from your wedding in front of the entire world, I thought you would be afraid of nothing.\u201dXiao Yao lowered her head and said nothing.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cActually, because you are a Princess, it\u2019s even harder to find a good man. A man with talent will be arrogant and might not want your power. A man who wants your position is someone you will never like. Feng Long matched you in every way, he is talented but doesn\u2019t need your position. Giving him up is a regret for you.\u201dXiao Yao murmured \u201cI know.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cIf you want to get married to a good man later it\u2019s going to be hard!\u201d He wanted Xiao Yao to grab this last opportunity and settle down, who knew she didn\u2019t manage to settle down and even destroyed her own reputation instead.Xiao Yao said \u201cI know.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor asked \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you and Fang Feng Bei? He wants to marry you but doesn\u2019t have the courage to come see us?\u201dXiao Yao glanced guiltily at the Yellow Emperor and then Zhuan Xu and then ducked behind Zhuan Xu again. He patted her back to indicate that no matter what he would cover for her. Xiao Yao said \u201cFang Feng Bei, he\u2026..he\u2019s dead.\u201dBoth the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao in shock and she said \u201cDon\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. He\u2019s dead and won\u2019t show up ever again!\u201d\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..just think of it as he died because of me. What happened between him and me I don\u2019t want to discuss!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor saw that Xiao Yao looked devastated and didn\u2019t want to probe further into romantic entanglements. He said to Zhuan Xu \u201cThe entire world saw Xiao Yao leave with Fang Feng Bei. She came back but he\u2019s dead, an answer must be given to the Fang Feng family.\u201dZhuan Xu coolly said \u201cI sent guards to bring Xiao Yao back and Fang Feng Bei wouldn\u2019t let her go so the guards kill him in their haste to bring the Princess back. This will give the Chi Sui clan and the entire world an answer as well. Feng Long\u2019s temper will calm down now and the Fang Feng family won\u2019t ask for anything for their second son.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor nodded.Xiao Yao sadly thought about what Xiang Liu would think once he hears that this is how Fang Feng Bei ended up.The Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cXiao Yao, what will you do from now on?\u201d\u201cWhat will I do?\u201d Xiao Yao looked at Zhuan Xu \u201cCan\u2019t I go back to the way it was? No matter how the world sees me, at least my Dad and my Gege won\u2019t not want me.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cOf course!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor looked at Zhuan Xu and sighed again.Xiao Yao giggled \u201cGrandfather, you are full of sighs today! Not like the smart brave Yellow Emperor!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cRight now I\u2019m just an old fool worried about my grandson and granddaughter!\u201dXiao Yao made face at Zhuan Xu since she was likely the only person in the world who could make the Yellow Emperor sigh left and sigh right.The sun set early in the Winter so dinner was also early. After dinner, Xiao Yao grabbed Zhuan Xu\u2019s sleeve and indicated for him to go to her room with her. Miao Pu made the room toasty warm and left wine for Xiao Yao.Xiao Yoa and Zhuan Xu settled on the pallet and Zhuan Xu held a cup of wine and kept smiling at Xiao Yao, his eyes reflected his contentment and happiness.Xiao Yao said \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to Five G.o.ds Mountain. Aish, this time I really wiped the floor with my dad\u2019s face!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cI\u2019ll have Xiao Xiao accompany you to Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cFine.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cHow long will you stay there?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWhen I was in Qing Shui Town, my mind was a mess and didn\u2019t want to think or do anything. I didn\u2019t even step foot out of the house. So your guards would have never noticed me. Later I wanted to go back but didn\u2019t know how to contact you or dad so went to find Yu s.h.i.+n and had him deliver me to Qing Qiu.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cSo you ran off from a wedding. It\u2019s no big deal! Are you afraid you won\u2019t be able to get married in the future?\u201dXiao Yao stuck her tongue out at him \u201cI\u2019m not worried, but I\u2019m afraid you and dad will be worried.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao \u201cIf you can\u2019t get married for your entire life, then I\u2019ll take care of you for your entire life.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIf you take care of me for long, you\u2019ll get annoyed whenever you see me.\u201dZhuan Xu held the wine cup in one hand and his other hand picked up a lock of Xiao Yao\u2019s hair and twined it around his hand as he casually drawled \u201cXiao Yao, if no man wants to marry you, actually living with me for an entire life isn\u2019t bad, right?\u201dXiao Yao thought of Jing, and thought of that painful period when it was Zhuan Xu who accompanied her every night and said \u201cIf no one is willing to marry me, then I guess you\u2019ll have to keep me company.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and his hand gripped Xiao Yao\u2019s lock of hair even tighter.Under Xiao Xiao and Miao Pu\u2019s accompaniment, Xiao Yao returned to Five G.o.ds Mountain.For her runaway bride routine, the Grand Emperor didn\u2019t even care and even smiled \u201cI never wanted you to marry Chi Sui Feng Long so you running away was exactly the ending I wanted.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cDid I leave you a mess to clean up?\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cDid you forget what I told you before? You can do whatever you want because your dad is a powerful ruler. I have the power to let my daughters do whatever they want.\u201dXiao Yao saw the Grand Emperor like this and felt even more apologetic. She felt guilty to her dad but also grateful that her dad coddled her this much.Ah Nian reveled in how Xiao Yao was so well behaved usually so when she did mess up it was in a way to shock the entire world.Xiao Yao snarked \u201cSo you better not learn from me, you hear.\u201dAh Nian said \u201cNo matter how much I try I will never beat you on this. And with you as a comparison, now the entire court and citizens of Gao Xing think I\u2019m the best Princess ever!\u201dXiao Yao smiled wanly. She heard already that the officials wanted her dad to punish her but her dad remained firm in protecting his daughter and nothing would sway him.Knowing that Hou and Yi Yang was planning to kill Jing, Xiao Yao wanted to make medicines for him to carry that could save his life in an emergency. But such medicines was very rare and hard to made. Luckily her study of the Sheng Nong Herb Manual all these years plus the holy waters in Gao Xing along with the heavenly mulberry trees, she had on hand all the rarest of ingredients to make it.Xiao Yao thought and used all the ingredients and added her own blood and after toiling away for a hundred days, she finally produced one pill.Xiao Yao fell deathly ill because she used her blood to make the pill, leaving her so weak she couldn\u2019t even get out of bed.After she fully recovered, she had lived on Five G.o.ds Mountain for four months and Xiao Xiao reminded Xiao Yao it was time to go back to Sheng Nong Mountain. Xiao Yao was also worried about Jing\u2019s health so went to say her farewells to her dad.On the day before she was leaving, the Grand Emperor left court early and took Xiao Yao and Ah Nian out to sea. The three fished, cooked the fish, and happily spent time together.Xiao Yao knew Ah Nian loved crab so purposely dove into the deep waters to catch two big ones for her. Ah Nian believed more and more that having an older sister like Xiao Yao was great. In the past she was jealous of Xiao Yao stealing her thunder but now compared to Xiao Yao everything she did seemed more proper. She could even have Xiao Yao do all the work while she just enjoyed the treats afterwards, who said Xiao Yao had to be the older sister. It\u2019s all Xiao Yao\u2019s lot in life that she had to take care of Ah Nian!The father and daughters played until it was completely dark out before they went back. The Grand Emperor watched his two daughters beside him chatting in their sweet voices and his usual cold visage melted like warm water.That night Xiao Yao bathed and was ready to sleep when Ah Nian came and took over Xiao Yao\u2019s pallet \u201cTonight I\u2019ll sleep with you.\u201dXiao Yao was startled and then smiled \u201cSure!\u201dThe two girls laid down in the darkness and Ah Nian grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s arm and shook it \u201cJiejie, why did you run away from your wedding?\u201dXiao Yao understood for the first time what nighttime girl talk was and said \u201cI thought you came to ask about Zhuan Xu! Why the interest in my matters?\u201dAh Nian scoffed \u201cI write regularly with Zhuan Xu gege, plus he\u2019s the ruler so his actions are watched by everyone. I often go to talk with Ru So about Zhuan Xu. I probably know more about his life than you do. Jiejie, did you run away from your wedding because you don\u2019t like the Chi Sui clan leader?\u201dXiao Yao thought \u201cYeah, I guess so!\u201d Even though running away was forced by Xiang Liu, but the truth was that she didn\u2019t love Feng Long.Ah Nian excitedly said \u201cThen what is your relations.h.i.+p with that Fang Feng Bei who stormed the wedding so dramatically? Everyone said you two already got it on before, when you guys were in Xuan Yuan Castle there was all this flirting and you guys hooked up then.\u201dXiao Yao looked out the window at the silver moon s.h.i.+ning down and smiled sadly but said nothing.Ah Nian got even more into it \u201cThe maids all say that the Xuan Yuan guards killed Fang Feng Bei and you were so devastated that you fought with the Black Emperor and ran back to Five G.o.ds Mountain. They all say you collected all the rare ingredients and worked so hard to make a pill to bring him back to life and save Fang Feng Bei. They all say that Fang Feng Bei\u2019s body was never found because you hid it\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s mouth dropped open \u201cThat\u2019s the rumor going around?\u201dAh Nian excitedly said \u201cYes! Yes!\u201d\u201cDo you believe it?\u201d\u201cNot one whit!\u201d\u201cThen why did you come ask me?\u201d\u201cI want to know why you ran away from the wedding. Good Jiejie, tell me!\u201d\u201cMy running away from the wedding impacted a lot of people but actually the fundamental reason is that I don\u2019t love Feng Long. You know that liking someone is something that can\u2019t stop you, and not liking someone gives you any reason to end it.\u201dAh Nian sighed \u201cI know!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s words got Ah Nian to start chattering about her own situation and the two sisters talked until they drowsily fell asleep.The second day, Xiao Yao got on the cloud carriage and kept yawning.The Grand Emperor and Ah Nian came to send her off and Ah Nian said \u201cJiejie, you\u2019re afraid of the cold so come back in the Winter where it\u2019s warmer her and we can go back out to sea.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSure! In the Winter when I come back, I\u2019ll teach you to swim.\u201dThe Grand Emperor looked at his two sleep deprived daughters and secretly smiled inside.Xiao Yao closed her eyes and her fingers touched the fish amethyst until her smile disappeared.Hou and Yi Yang were not compa.s.sionate people, and with their personalities, their patience was at an end. So every day Jing was living under the specter of death and even if he was very careful, as time went on people got careless and Hou and Yi Yang would have a chance to strike. The best solution was to eliminate the danger once and for all.Killing Hou and Yi Yang wasn\u2019t hard but Jing wanted the truth.Otherwise with Hou and Yi Yang dead then Jing still wouldn\u2019t be able to face that child Tu Shan Zhen.To get the truth both Hou and Yi Yang had to remain alive. But if they remained alive then Jing would be in danger.Xiao Yao furrowed her brows, this really was a conundrum!But she needed to resolve it because she also wanted to know the truth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each needle was intricate and precise and she was nearly done.Zhuan Xu waited until she finished the final thread and asked \u201cWhen did you get the interest to make such things?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cTwo birds, one stone. Needle work is good medical skill practice since I can sew up a wound so the more practice I have to make my movements more fluid the better for my patients.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the second benefit?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhen I\u2019m done I\u2019ll give this to Jing.\u201dZhuan Xu was stunned and after a moment asked \u201cYou\u2026\u2026..you got back together with him?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2026.what\u2019s that for?\u201d Zhuan Xu pointed to the embroidered pouch in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand.\u201cLast time I went to Qing Qiu, I learned that he was quite ill and if he wasn\u2019t treated promptly then he might not live more than a hundred years. I\u2019m simply his doctor now.\u201dZhuan Xu silently sat there and didn\u2019t have any expression on his face and appeared very calm.Xiao Yao felt something odd and asked \u201cGege?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and gently said \u201cWhen you\u2019re done embroidering this pouch, I want one as well. I want it with the phoenix flower, our favorite flower.\u201dXiao Yao happily replied \u201cSure.\u201dXiao Yao went to check on Jing and found he was getting better and said to Hu Zhen \u201cVery good!\u201dHu Zhen explained \u201cThese past days the clan leader is looking better and the clan elders even compliment my medical skills so I had to accept it.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou did do half the work.\u201dXiao Yao handed the magnolia embroidered pouch to Jing and inside was a pill sealed in beeswax. Xiao Yao said \u201cThis pill is for an emergency and at such time it can preserve your final breath.\u201dWith Xiao Yao\u2019s position and medical skills and she could still only make one such pill, Jing knew how rare and precious it was.Jing carefully put it away \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m very careful.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cWith the danger looming for one day is one day I can\u2019t relax.\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019m mostly in Zhi Yi Castle and only go back when there are clan matters to handle.\u201dXiao Yao forced a smile \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dJing didn\u2019t want Xiao Yao worried about such things and asked \u201cDid you have fun in Five G.o.ds Mountain?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cMy dad couldn\u2019t have been a good kid when he was young, his fis.h.i.+ng and cooking skills even I have to bow down to. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s an expert at anything fun.\u201dXiao Yao spoke with Jing a bit longer and then left. Jing was loathe to part but didn\u2019t stay her since this was already more than he could wish for and he didn\u2019t dare push for more.Xiao Yao returned to Xiao Yue Summit and remembered agreeing to make Zhuan Xu an embroidered pouch so started to draw phoenix flowers on a silk handkerchief.When Zhuan Xu arrived he saw Xiao Yao\u2019s room covered in various phoenix flowers and he couldn\u2019t help but smile.Xiao Yao said \u201cI really have no drawing ability. Help me draw a few flowers.\u201dZhuan Xu was too happy but teasingly groused \u201cI don\u2019t want to. When you made the pouch for Jing did you ask him to draw the flowers? Since you\u2019re making it for me, then you need to do it from beginning to end.\u201dXiao Yao was frustrated and amused \u201cYou\u2019re so picky! Fine, I\u2019ll draw it!\u201dZhuan Xu stood behind Xiao Yao and watched for a bit before sighing \u201cYou! You\u2019re so stupid!\u201d He grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and taught her how to draw \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be softer here, relax your wrist and be lighter with the touch. You\u2019re drawing a phoenix flower, not a phoenix tree\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu taught Xiao Yao and lectured her and initially Xiao Yao listened with a joking smile but later she got annoyed and decided to smear the ink on Zhuan Xu\u2019s face.Zhuan Xu laughed and ducked while attacking Xiao Yao back \u201cLook at you being so useless, since you were a kid and couldn\u2019t do something you wouldn\u2019t let anyone talk about it!\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re totally useful then? Other older brothers help their sisters out and let them win. Only you\u2019re so petty that you blame me for being stupid. Why don\u2019t you blame yourself for being so stupid that you can\u2019t teach me well?\u201dThe two of them bickered until it was just laughter in the room.The Yellow Emperor walked by and stopped to smile at them. It felt like yesterday he watched two little kids chasing each other under the phoenix tree.Since Chang Yi died in battle and his daughter-in-law committed suicide in front of Zhuan Xu, his grandson was forced to grow up overnight. There was a sharp coldness in his eyes and he was careful not to reveal emotion like an adult would. Only when he was with Xiao Yao did he act like a child. All these years later after even more hards.h.i.+p and pain, Zhuan Xu securely locked up all his emotions so that the world only saw someone who never had any strong feelings. He was calm and mellow at all times. Except with Xiao Yao, then he was just like a child laughing and being unreasonable.The Yellow Emperor sighed, Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao were like his palm and the back of his hand, both sides were his flesh. If either hurt he would hurt, but this world didn\u2019t allow things to always satisfy both ends. He wondered if he really was too old, the leader who led his forces to conquer castles never seemed to be stuck in this quagmire.The Yellow Emperor sighed and walked off.That night Xiao Yao laid in bed and thought about Hou and Yi Yang while unconsciously playing with the fish amethyst.Under the lamp light it glowed a warm soft brilliance. Shan Hu helped Xiao Yao arrange her blankets and secretly smiled. Xiao Yao glared at her \u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201dShan Hu quickly explained \u201cNo, I\u2019m not smiling about anything. I just think this fish amethyst is so rare. I once saw a fish ruby that wasn\u2019t as big or as crystal clear as this one.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI once saw a fish ruby too but it was bigger than this one without a speck of imperfection. It was beautiful.\u201dShan Hu suggested \u201cIf Princess likes it, have the Tu Shan clan leader buy it for you!\u201dXiao Yao glared at Shan Hu who smiled \u201cPrincess want to sleep? Then I\u2019ll dim the lights.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dShan Hu closed the clamsh.e.l.l nightlight and the room darkened.Xiao Yao held the fish amethyst and closed her eyes and remembered that day out at sea\u2026\u2026..That sea outing, she spent the night alone with Jing on the boat but no one noticed other than Zhuan Xu. Come to think of it, Feng Long never noticed any romance related matter; Xing Yue was focused on flirting with Zhuan Xu; Hou and Yi Yang\u2026\u2026that night they likely had a private date as well. Back then Jing had just returned so Yi Yang was likely in a pique with Hou and to upset him would purposely be extra nice to Jing.Xiao Yao sighed, that day the entire s.h.i.+p, other than Feng Long, everyone had their secrets so no one noticed anyone else\u2019s oddness.That day Hou was the last to return and he rode the monster fish in the waves and circled the s.h.i.+p a few times before killing the fish in front of everyone to grab the fish ruby. That fish ruby was bright red and so sparkling, even Xing Yue who was used to seeing expensive baubles wanted it and asked for it. But the normally very generous Hou didn\u2019t agree to give it to her.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want it but couldn\u2019t help but look at it as well. She curiously asked what it was and Jing noticed she was interested which is why he gave her the fish amethyst later.Of the three ladies on the s.h.i.+p, only Yi Yang never showed any interest in it from beginning to end. She didn\u2019t even spare it a glance and that wasn\u2019t like her personality, Yi Yang not being interested wasn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t like the fish ruby, it was because she knew Hou would give her the fish ruby.Hou killed the monster fish in front of everyone to extract the fish ruby, that was like a male beast killing a prey before the female in a form of courts.h.i.+p. His powerful form riding the monster fish under the sun was filled with a man\u2019s strength and vigor, and Hou was actually shaming Jing right in front of his face. He wanted to show Jing\u2019s fiancee how much stronger he was and conquer Jing\u2019s woman.Hou\u2019s torment and shame didn\u2019t topple Jing and he also didn\u2019t win in the power struggle with Jing. He could only use winning away the women around Jing, such as making Jing\u2019s maid Lan Xiang betray Jing and also cause Jing\u2019s wife to like Hou over Jing.Xiao Yao suddenly sat up \u201cb.a.s.t.a.r.d!\u201dThe next day Xiao Yao rushed to find Jing who was leaving and Hu Ya driving the carriage looked upset.Seeing Xiao Yao, Jing had Hu Ya wait and asked \u201cWhat happened? Why are you here?\u201dXiao Yao took off her veiled hat \u201cI\u2019m not here to see you, I want to talk to Jing Ye.\u201dJing said \u201cJing Ye is inside, I\u2019ll go with you to see her.\u201dXiao Yao \u201cYou handle your matters, I want to speak with her alone.\u201cThen I\u2019ll come back as soon as I can.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and said nothing before walking in.Jing Ye was speaking with Hu Zhen and when Xiao Yao walked in she quickly curtsied \u201cPrincess you are here! Where is the master?\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cI noticed Hu Ya\u2019s expression was odd, what happened?\u201d\u201cLast night a personal guard of my master secretly poisoned his medicine but luckily Princess you warned us so we are extra careful and he didn\u2019t succeed. The guard committed suicide before he could be interrogated but the guard grew up with Hu Ya so Hu Ya feels terrible.\u201dJing Ye sighed \u201cThis feeling is so scary, one second it\u2019s someone you trust and the next is someone with a sword aimed at you. Hu Zhen said the enemy wants to make us all uneasy and start suspecting even our closest family. Thankfully master is very kind and isn\u2019t affected, he keeps comforting Hu Ya.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s expression darkened, so Hou and Yi Yang have started taking action!Hu Zhen said \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone about the clan leader\u2019s health but the two of them are not stupid so they likely already knew. They have been waiting for him to fall gravely ill but in the last few months the clan leader looks so much healthier so they know that method won\u2019t work which is why yesterday\u2019s poison attempt is just the beginning.\u201dHu Zhen stared at Xiao Yao without blinking and she knew what he wanted to say. She said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let anyone harm my patient.\u201dHu Zhen was relieved and bowed \u201cThank you to the Princess.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI have something to talk to Jing Ye about.\u201dHu Zhen looked at Jing Ye before retreating from the room.Xiao Yao sat down at Jing\u2019s usual seat and stared at Jing Ye who felt her gooseb.u.mps rise and asked \u201cDoes Princess want to take me to task?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI have to ask you things and if you tell me the truth then I won\u2019t do anything to you.\u201dJing was gentle and polite and never harsh with Jing Ye so right now she felt unhappy but knew how important Xiao Yao was to Jing so she accepted it \u201cWhatever I can say I will answer.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cTell me, has Hou ever given you presents, been nice to you, tried to seduce you?\u201dJing Ye\u2019s face flushed red \u201cDoes Princess suspect that I betrayed my master? I didn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cAnswer my question, has Hou tried to seduce you? Tell me the truth!\u201dJing Ye bit her lip and after a moment slowly nodded her head.\u201cHas he touched you?\u201dJing Ye\u2019s eyes were filled with tears \u201cOne time almost but I vowed death in denying him so he let me go.\u201d\u201cWere you ever moved by him?\u201dJing Ye immediately said \u201cAfter Master went missing, I always suspected Hou did it. How could I be moved by him? Only Lan Xiang that idiot could have taken Hou\u2019s fake affection as real and ruined her life over him.\u201d\u201cIf you weren\u2019t moved by him, why didn\u2019t you tell Jing about it?\u201dJing Ye held back her tears \u201cI may seem capable on the outside but I\u2019m still a maid in the Tu Shan clan. If Hou liked me then I need to treat it as my lucky day. How dare I complain? Plus\u2026..how can I tell Master this since I\u2019m a woman?\u201dXiao Yao stared at Jing Ye who added \u201cI swear that I never did anything to betray Master. I\u2026..I already have someone I like. I could never like Hou.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cHu Zhen. When Master was asleep for 37 years because of the Princess, Hu Zhen and I took care of him together. He was with me in enduring the pain of watching Master wasting away. He\u2019s not like Hou\u2026..full of honeyed words, he\u2019s dense and stupid. But he makes me feel safe, with him beside me, I know even if the Heavens fell he would hold it up with me.\u201dHu Zhen dense and stupid? Xiao Yao never got that impression, he seemed quick-witted and sharp. Only a woman who really liked a man would describe him as dense and stupid and still say it in an affectionate way.Xiao Yao asked \u201cDoes Hou still hara.s.s you?\u201d\u201cNo, ever since Master became clan leader, he stopped hara.s.sing me. Later he knew I liked Hu Zhen and wasn\u2019t even upset about it. He even gifted me a future wedding accessory.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cI believe you. Actually I never thought you could betray Jing. I just wanted to find out because it wasn\u2019t right that you kept this from Jing. But you\u2019re also right, this isn\u2019t stuff you can talk about. And with the Grand Madam around back then, she might\u2019ve just married you off to Hou.\u201dJing Ye let out a sigh of relief and wiped her tears \u201cThank you Princess for understanding my difficult position.\u201d That was also her worry back then that she would become the next Lan Mu which is why she never said anything.Xiao Yao put her hands under her chin deep in thought. Jing Ye softly called \u201cPrincess?\u201d Xiao Yao waved her off \u201cYou go do your thing, I\u2019m mulling through some stuff.\u201dJing Ye quietly left the room.Xiao Yao was mulling over what Hou was thinking. Jing Ye\u2019s rejection told Hou that he wasn\u2019t as good as Jing so that enraged Hou and he kept on hara.s.sing her. But when he knew she liked Hu Zhen, he stopped because winning Jing Ye meant winning over Hu Zhen and not Jing. Hou wasn\u2019t interested in Jing Ye after that. Hou used conquering Jing\u2019s women to prove he was better than Jing! Hou actually having that thought meant he would have set his eyes on Yi Yang from the beginning. Compared to maids like Lan Xiang and Jing Ye, Yi Yang was way more meaningful a conquest.Based on what she saw, Yi Yang genuinely liked Hou but how much Hou was sincere towards her versus conquering her to win over Jing was unclear.Jing wanted to lessen Hou\u2019s anger but didn\u2019t know that Hou\u2019s entire soul was twisted. He tortured Jing, tried to win the clan leader position, stole Jing\u2019s women, all of that was to prove he was better than Jing. But the one woman he could never win the affection of was already dead. He could never show her his victory over Jing.Xiao Yao sighed, if Jing\u2019s mother knew that the poison wine she brewed with her own hands would be drunk sip by sip one day by Jing, would she have treated Hou better? Xiao Yao still couldn\u2019t agree with Jing in not killing off Hou already, but Jing had already stepped aside too much and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t let Hou keeping harming Jing.Jing walked into the room and saw Xiao Yao with her head lowered and brow furrowed as if deep in thought. The sunlight s.h.i.+ned on parts of her and illuminated her face like an orchid waiting to bloom.Jing quietly looked at her and felt that the sunlight s.h.i.+ning on Xiao Yao s.h.i.+ned right into his heart. It was like he had drunken wine and felt this warm buzz.Jing slowly walked over and Xiao Yao was still thinking until Jing walked up to her before she realized he was there. She raised her head and smiled at Jing, and that smile was from deep inside and brightened her face.The moment her smile came and showed her teeth like a crescent moon, she was so beautiful and the smile was all for him. Jing felt his heart filled full with happiness and called out \u201cXiao Yao.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cBack so early? Are you all done?\u201d\u201cI did the urgent matters already and the rest can wait.\u201d Jing sat across from her \u201cWhat were you thinking about?\u201dXiao Yao mocked herself \u201cWhat can I think about? A person like me, when I think it\u2019s all messed up and all I come up with are a bellyful of bad ideas. Jing, can you promise me something?\u201d\u201cJust say it.\u201d\u201cTrust me! No matter what happens, trust me completely without reservation!\u201d\u201cI promise.\u201dXiao Yao was still wary and reminded him \u201cNo matter what you see, what you hear, close your eyes and ask your heart.\u201dJing said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the things I promised you before that I didn\u2019t do, this time I will do this no matter what!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cGreat, I look forward to seeing you do it.\u201dThat night when Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Peak,\u00a0Xiao Yao asked him \u201cAre any of the consorts having parties or celebrations soon? Like a birthday? Or someone in their family getting a promotion?\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing?\u201d\u201cI want a party on the water. Best if it\u2019s on a boat in the middle of a big lake.\u201dZhuan Xu called \u201cXiao Xiao.\u201dXiao Xiao walked over and Zhuan Xu asked \u201cPrincess wants a water banquet. Anyone suitable to hold one?\u201dXiao Xiao replied \u201cThe Wan Lei Consort grew up by the water and every banquet likes holding it by the water. In ten or so more days will be when the water lilies bloom on the Great Mirror Lake. She can hold a flower viewing banquet on the lake as a reason to invite guests.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and nodded \u201cThat\u2019s perfect and no one will have reason to suspect.\u201dXiao Xiao asked \u201cWho does Princess want to invite?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cJing, Fang Feng Yi Yang, Tu Shan Hou, Li Jie Chang. I don\u2019t care about anyone else but those four people have to attend.\u201dXiao Xiao said \u201cI understand.\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cXiao Xiao, thank you.\u201d\u201cPrincess you are too kind.\u201d Xiao Xiao quietly retreated.Zhuan Xu asked Xiao Yao \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to see Fang Feng Yi Yang? What are you planning?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m planning to do some bad stuff and it\u2019s only stuff I can do secretly so I can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cFine. If I\u2019m free that day I\u2019ll come see what you\u2019re up to.\u201dDays later, the Wan Lei Consort held a flower viewing banquet on the Great Mirror Lake in Sheng Nong Mountain. She invited guests to admire the water lilies and enjoy the scenic vistas.Xiao Yao was now infamous in the vast wilderness but she rarely went out so when she arrived at the party, she was the center of attention as everyone wanted to see what the Princess who ran off with a dissolute rake on her wedding day looked like.The Wan Lei Consort had all the guests brought onto various s.h.i.+ps, and likely to lessen Xiao Yao\u2019s discomfort, her s.h.i.+p had few people with only close friends and family \u2013 Jing, Fang Feng Yi Yang, Li Jie Chang, Xi Ling Chun and his fiancee Ji Yen Ran, the Wan Lei Consort and her little sister Wan Lei Yun.The Wan Lei Consort and Yi Yang sat on the pallet catching up while Wan Lei Yun stuck by her sister\u2019s side. She spoke little and took in everything, a very quiet and polite young lady. Ji Yen Ran was also a gently bred young lady who smiled and sat beside Fang Feng Yi Yang. That left Jing, Chang, Hou, and Chun, the four men talking in the rear of the s.h.i.+p and fis.h.i.+ng.Only Xiao Yao was alone standing by the railing admiring the view.Chang saw Xiao Yao and kept poking Jing with his elbow but Jing had no reaction. Chang walked over to Xiao Yao and spoke loudly \u201cPrincess, will you consider my buddy?\u201dXiao Yao leaned against the railing with a smile and said nothing.Chang said \u201cYou left Feng Long, your reputation is ruined because of Fang Feng Bei, you can\u2019t find a decent man to marry you now. My buddy is true to you, why don\u2019t you just go with him!\u201dXiao Yao flipped her hair and laughed \u201cHe\u2019s true to me? I can\u2019t feel that.\u201dXiao Yao was wearing a gossamer thin Spring robe that billowed in the wind and outlined her pet.i.te figure, giving her an aura of innocent seductiveness like one of the blooming water lilies ringing the s.h.i.+p.Chang was gritting his teeth \u201cHow does Jing need to treat you so that you feel his true heart?\u201dXiao Yao bit her lip and said \u201cI want a water lily.\u201dChang said \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of cake.\u201d But Xiao Yao added \u201cNo using powers though. I want a hand plucked water lily, and I want it right now.\u201dChang was startled, it seemed simple but sometimes the simplest things in the world are the hardest to do. Chang glanced over at Yi Yang and the Wan Lei Consort, and then over at Hou and Chun, before looking around at all the s.h.i.+ps in the lake. He sighed \u201cPrincess, you are clearly being difficult.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing and just smiled at Jing.Chang was about to say something when with a plop Jing dived off the s.h.i.+p and swam towards a water lily.The sound startled the other four ladies and everyone stood up.The Wan Lei Consort asked in dismay \u201cThe Tu Shan clan leader, what is going on?\u201dXiao Yao grinned \u201cThe Tu Shan clan leader went to pluck a water lily.\u201dSince Chang dragged Jing over to Xiao Yao, Hou had been keeping an eye on them while still fis.h.i.+ng with Chun. He heard every word Chang said to Xiao Yao. He already knew Jing liked Xiao Yao but he didn\u2019t realize Jing was willing to do anything for her.The rest of the folks on the other s.h.i.+ps didn\u2019t know why Jing suddenly jumped in the water but they could tell this was a very strange occurrence so everyone stopped laughing and stared at Jing.Someone called out on another s.h.i.+p \u201cTu Shan clan leader, do you need some help? I\u2019m happy to oblige.\u201dJing swam and calmly answered \u201cNo need, I need to do this myself.\u201dEveryone was gossiping \u201cWhat needs the clan leader to do personally?\u2019Jing candidly replied \u201cPlucking a flower.\u201dEveryone paused and then started laughing uproariously.Chang leaned on the railing and covered his eyes wearily with his hands, not having the heart to look anymore. He viciously chewed out Xiao Yao \u201cYou little witch, are you happy now?\u201dJing swam to the sh.o.r.e and plucked the most beautiful water lily before swimming back.He vaulted onto the s.h.i.+p dripping wet and everyone saw that he was holding a gloriously bloomed water lily in his hand. He handed it to Xiao Yao and she accepted it with a smile. She plucked the two prettiest blooms and tucked it in her hair and put the rest around her wrist as a bracelet.Everyone thought the Tu Shan clan leader was plucking a flower for Fang Feng Yi Yang but seeing him hand it to Xiao Yao caused silence to descend as all eyes focused on Xiao Yao.Li Jie Chang purposely loudly laughed \u201cWe made a bet with the Princess and we lost. The bet was to not use powers to pluck a water lily. I wanted to welsh on the bet but the much too serious Jing actually made good on the bet!\u201dEveryone knew Li Jie Chang was a prankster so laughed along with him and then went back to their own pleasures. But everyone on Xiao Yao\u2019s s.h.i.+p knew this wasn\u2019t some bet.Xiao Yao raised her arm and asked Jing \u201cIs it pretty?\u201dJing nodded and all the women on the s.h.i.+p had to agree that it was gorgeous. Ji Yen Ran even glanced at Chun with a realization that the most beautiful accessory in this world wasn\u2019t jewels but was instead a wild flower plucked by a lover.Xiao Yao said to Jing \u201cTake care of yourself and quickly dry your clothes.\u201d She finished and acted like nothing had happened and sauntered away.Yi Yang\u2019s express was thunderous and everyone awkwardly stood there. Xiao Yao was nonchalantly standing at the front chatting with Shan Hu and enjoying with the view.The Wan Lei Consort composed herself and smiled \u201cEveryone try the dishes which are all local specialties from my hometown. If you don\u2019t like it at least you\u2019ve now tasted it before. Later there will be main courses and if you like it then have more.\u201dEveryone awkwardly sat down and dutifully ate the dishes brought by the maids.Hou smiled and observed Xiao Yao. Likely due to her living in the common world for hundreds of years, she may be royal but was very different than the other n.o.ble ladies. She was like a wildflower growing in the countryside, brazen and free. No wonder she publicly discarded Feng Long, and now that Fang Feng Bei was dead, she didn\u2019t seem all that upset and was flirting with Jing.The perfect Jing was always cool and calm with no desires and no wants. Everyone\u2019s dream position as the clan leader was something he didn\u2019t even want. The beautiful Fang Feng Yi Yang didn\u2019t even merit an extra look from him. Even an aphrodisiac couldn\u2019t get him to sleep with Yi Yang. But Jing\u2019s heart was captured by that wildflower, there was finally something he wanted and he desired now.Hou liked hunting since he was small, the more dangerous the beast the more he liked it. The more dangerous it was, the more he got a thrill out of conquering it.Another s.h.i.+p pulled up alongside but no one noticed until Feng Long and Empress Xing Yue walked out. Everyone on the Wan Lei Consort\u2019s s.h.i.+p stood up and bowed as Feng Long and Empress Xing Yue boarded. Xiao Yao\u2019s head started hurting and she shrank behind others.Xing Yue said to the Wan Lei Consort \u201cI heard you were having a party on the lake so decided to come join the fun. I hope I didn\u2019t intrude on the festivities.\u201dThe Wan Lei Consort laughed \u201cThe arrival of the Empress will only add to the festivities.\u201dXing Yue\u2019s eyes moved over everyone until she landed on Xiao Yao \u201cWhat a surprise to see the Princess here as well.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know how to answer so didn\u2019t reply.Xing Yue said to Feng Long \u201cGege, this is the first time you\u2019ve seen Xiao Yao since that ridiculous wedding ceremony, right?\u201dFeng Long glanced at Xiao Yao and said nothing.Xiao Yao knew Xing Yue came today for her and she could just ignore Xing Yue. But she truly felt apologetic towards Feng Long and if her being shamed by Xing Yue could make him feel better, then she was willing to endure it.Xing Yue walked over to Xiao Yao and circled her \u201cPrincess was supposedly so in love with Fang Feng Bei, but he\u2019s been dead only a few months and already Princess is out attending a party. There isn\u2019t the slight bit of mourning.\u201dXing Yue said to Yi Yang \u201cYour second brother died for her but look at her! Encountering such a heartless woman, even I don\u2019t think it was worth it for your second brother. It must be hard for you to be here pasting on a smile.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cGege, you should be happy that the Heavens looked out for the Chi Sui clan so that this type of woman didn\u2019t join our family!\u201dFeng Long\u2019s expression was dark and he continued to say nothing.Chang laughed and tried to change the subject \u201cEveryone came to enjoy the flowers, let\u2019s all just look at the flowers!\u201dXing Yue pointed to the flowers on Xiao Yao\u2019s wrist \u201cHere are some water lilies to enjoy? Princess is dressed so provocatively, which man gave you this glorious water lily? Who are you planning to seduce now\u2026..\u201dJing stepped in front of Xiao Yao \u201cI gave her the flower. Will Your highness please be mindful of what you say.\u201dXing Yue covered her mouth \u201cOoops, I totally forgot about you two. That\u2019s great, since no man will want her now, why don\u2019t the Tu Shan clan leader take her home as a concubine. But you need to watch her carefully, who knows if she\u2019ll run off with another man down the road.\u201dJing was about to say something when Xiao Yao jerked his sleeve to indicate that he just endure and say nothing. Jing held back.\u201cLook! Just look!\u201d Xing Yue sighed loudly \u201cYi Yang, Yi Yang, you are so magnanimous, look at them flirting and shooting looks at each other right in front of you and you don\u2019t even say anything. Are you really going to let this woman who caused your second brother\u2019s death to share a husband with you? You are still the wife, show some backbone\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhat is the Empress planning to do with some backbone?\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear when Zhuan Xu arrived on the s.h.i.+p and he was walking over with a smile on his face.Everyone quickly bowed and Zhuan Xu pa.s.sed everyone to personally help the Wan Lei Consort up \u201cAre the water lilies pretty?\u201dThe Wan Lei Consort answered \u201cVery pretty. Does Your majesty want to view it with us?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and teased \u201cYou\u2019re prettier than the flowers, no need to view the water lilies!\u201dThe Wan Lei Consort\u2019s face blushed pink while Xing Yue\u2019s face turned white.Zhuan Xu waved at Xiao Yao and she walked over to him. He plucked the water lily from her hair and turned it into a longer strand that he wanted to put around the Wan Lei Consort\u2019s wrist like Xiao Yao had. He couldn\u2019t secure it right and laughed \u201cThis stuff you women are better at.\u201dXiao Yao placed the water lily strand around the Wan Lei Consort\u2019s wrist and helped her make a wrist corsage. Zhuan Xu complimented \u201cLovely!\u201dThe Wan Lei Consorted curtsied to Zhuan Xu \u201cThank Your majesty for the grace.\u201dXiao Yao also curtsied \u201cYour majesty, I have a headache and will excuse myself.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019m just planning to go visit Grandfather so let\u2019s go together.\u201dZhuan Xu said to everyone \u201cEveryone continue enjoying the flowers!\u201d Zhuan Xu turned to go but stopped and whispered a few words in the Wan Lei Consort\u2019s ear. She shyly smiled and nodded her head.Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao got on the other s.h.i.+p and left.The Wan Lei Consort smiled and asked everyone to go back to enjoying the view. Xing Yue\u2019s expression was thunderous and was about to explode but the Wan Lei Consort remained cool and composed. The Wan Lei Consort was different than the other consorts like Shu Hui who were from the Middle Plains. She was from Xuan Yuan so she may be respectful of Xing Yue but was not afraid of her.Yi Yang as furious that Xing Yue shaming Xiao Yao also included her so she smiled at the Wan Lei Consort \u201cHis majesty is surely so loving to Your highness. Back there on the s.h.i.+p, he only had eyes for you and no one else.\u201dThe Wan Lei Consort raised the water lily corsage on her wrist and wordlessly smiled.Xing Yue was so furious, when Zhuan Xu arrived he didn\u2019t berate her but ignored her in front of everyone. Xing Yue felt the entire lake full of water lilies were mocking her and wanted to immediately escape.Feng Long\u2019s voice reached her in her mind \u201cI told you not to come. You insisted and now you\u2019re here then you can\u2019t just leave. If you leave then everyone will speak even worse behind your back. If you endure then all people will say is that it doesn\u2019t matter which consort Zhuan Xu likes, you\u2019re still the Empress and don\u2019t need to vy with the other consorts for anything.\u201dXing Yue could only hold in her furious rage and put on a magnanimous demeanor to enjoy the flowers with everyone.After the s.h.i.+p departed, Zhuan Xu immediately started yelling at Xiao Yao, poking her in the head \u201cWhen did you become such a hare brain! Xing Yue insults you and you just take it? If you have such a easygoing personality then why don\u2019t you use it on Grandfather and me instead? How come you\u2019re not nicer to me? Every time I nag you about something you\u2019re all sharp teeth retorts flying back at me! Faced with an outsider you\u2019re all docile and tongue-tied. Let me tell you, if I see this happen again, I\u2019ll first thrash you little spineless thing!\u201dXiao Yao kept her head lowered in silence.Zhuan Xu kept on yelling \u201cSay something! Are you mute now?\u201dXiao Yao wearily splayed her hands \u201cAren\u2019t you complaining that I\u2019m too sharp-tongued all the time. Aren\u2019t I docilely listening to you berate me right now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu was so frustrated he bopped her on the head. \u201cIf you have this att.i.tude with me why don\u2019t you use it on outsiders?\u201d\u201cMy past with Feng Long\u2026.I feel like I wronged him. So if Xing Yue was to insult me then let her, it\u2019ll also let Feng Long release from frustration.\u201d\u201cWronged him? What did you do wrong? Your dad and I have given way more reparations to the Chi Sui clan than needed and said plenty of nice things. Feng Long is currently above the whole world and under only one person. He has everything he could want in power and glory. All he has to deal with it some gossip behind his back! Forget later, he can have any woman he wants right now! But you? Your reputation is shot and the person who ended up on the losing side of this situation is you!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cJust this time then! Next time Xing Yue wants to pick a fight with me, I\u2019ll fight back.\u201dZhuan Xu coldly huffed \u201cYou said you were planning to do something bad. I thought you were planning to do something exciting so I found time in my busy schedule to come watch from the sidelines. Who expected that I would see you were the one being attacked?\u201dXiao Yao opened her arms and stretched before smiling \u201cMy bad thing is just getting started. I tossed the lure and now will have to wait for the fish to bite. Later I\u2019ll tell you everything so you can marvel at my plan.\u201dZhuan Xu felt the water lily on Xiao Yao\u2019s wrist was annoying him so he flicked his finger and it fell into the water.\u201cAish, my flower!\u201d Xiao Yao wanted to scoop it up but it floated away. Xiao Yao\u2019s face was crestfallen and Zhuan Xu scoffed \u201cJust a few worthless flowers. Later I\u2019ll get you as much as you want.\u201dXiao Yao muttered \u201cIt\u2019s not the same\u2026\u2026..\u201dA few days later, Xiao Yao and Shan Hu entered the Tu Shan clan jewelry store. She was wearing a veiled hat so the clerk couldn\u2019t see her face but he saw the blue pearl earrings hanging from Shan Hu\u2019s ears and immediately welcomed them warmly and brought them to the inner chambers.The maid brought out refreshments and the clerk brought out a set of jewelry for Xiao Yao and Shan Hu to peruse. Xiao Yao sat on the pallet and glanced across the offering before looking out the window, clearly not interested in what was presented. Shan Hu picked a seven colored fish bracelet that wasn\u2019t very expensive but nicely made with each piece the same size and color.Xiao Yao had the clerk wrap it up and was preparing to pay and leave. Hou lifted the curtains and said with a smile \u201cPrincess isn\u2019t picking something for yourself?\u201d Hou gestured to the clerk who quickly retreated.Xiao Yao lazily drawled \u201cBit bored so brought Shan Hu out shopping.\u201dHou said \u201cThe rare items won\u2019t be shown that easily. Princess, please see if there is anything you like.\u201dTwo maids came in and placed boxes on the table.Hou opened a box and inside was a jewel that was exquisitely made. Xiao Yao picked it up and complimented \u201cThe Tu Shan clan have good jewelry designers, comparable to the artisans in the Palace.\u201dHou described bracelets and hair pins to Xiao Yao, going into detail the painstaking labor needed for the intricate details and flawless finishes. His explanations were detailed and Xiao Yao listened raptly. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but ask \u201cHow do you know so much about the jewelry?\u201dHou laughed \u201cI designed all these from picking the raw materials and gems to selecting the right artisan to hand craft it. I handled it all myself.\u201dXiao Yao was genuinely surprised and startled and checked out Hou again in earnest.Hou explained \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be surprised about, the Tu Shan clan dabble in business and jewelry is the business with the greatest risk. It\u2019s the field I focused on learning since I was small. If you spent as much time learning it as me, you would know just as much and do it just as well.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cJewelry seems cold but it contains a person\u2019s creative ideas, hard work, and lifetime\u2019s investment to make a woman look a little bit prettier.\u201dHou clapped \u201cExactly! But I noticed you rarely wear jewelry.\u201d\u201cI was pretty down and out in the past so to even survive was a blessing. I feel like such external items are to be admired and I don\u2019t any have desire to own it.\u201dHou raised an eyebrow \u201cThat\u2019s unique.\u201dXiao Yao mocked herself \u201cIt\u2019s not that unique, I\u2019m also very particular so rarely does anything catch my eye.\u201dHou smiled at the glittering jewelry and sighed \u201cI guess none of these items make your heart flutter.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and got up to take her leave.Hou suddenly asked \u201cDo you have time tomorrow? Tomorrow a s.h.i.+pment of raw gems will arrive, are you interested in seeing what it looks like in its original state?\u201dXiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head and stared at him before smiling and laying it out in the open \u201cYou must know that Jing likes me.\u201dHou smiled back and decided to take a step back in his approach \u201cIf you\u2019ve decided to marry him then I take back what I just said.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cFang Feng Bei taught me archery and died in a shower of arrows. If you\u2019re not afraid of death then I don\u2019t mind going with you to see the raw gems.\u201dHou said \u201cThen it\u2019s set. I\u2019ll meet you here tomorrow at noon.\u201dXiao Yao grinned and put her on veiled hat before leaving with Shan Hu.The second day Xiao Yao arrived and Hou took her to see the uncut gems.With a first date, there was a second date, and a third date\u2026\u2026.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but admit that Hou was a very attractive man. He was handsome, strong, hardworking, interesting, serious when working but carefree when playing. His carefree was different than Fang Feng Bei\u2019s similar att.i.tude. Fang Feng Bei really didn\u2019t care about anything so he wanted nothing. Hou\u2019s pa.s.sion was because he wanted to dominate it all. His daring was not the same fearless as Fang Feng Bei who really wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. Hou\u2019s adventurous spirit was only within the confines of what he felt he could handle. He wanted the thrill but also protected his life. He was likely exactly the kind of man Fang Feng Yi Yang wanted. His ambition could fulfill a woman\u2019s lifetime wants and his adventurous spirit could give her endless thrills but nothing that was life threatening.Hou knew Xiao Yao was a smart person and there was only ever one reason for a man to spend time with a woman. He never openly said or did anything nor did he try to conceal it. He gave Xiao Yao everything he thought she would like and did it in a self-deprecating way \u201cI know you might not like it but it\u2019s my way of expressing how I feel. You just have to accept it and you can do whatever you want with it afterwards, throw it away or give it to someone else.\u201dXiao Yao smiled, no wonder even Xing Yue said Hou was very generous. The things Hou gave her, Zhuan Xu might not even give his consorts and then boldly say they could do whatever they wanted with it afterwards.From Spring to Summer, the two of them gradually got closer.One Summer afternoon, Hou took Xiao Yao out on a little boat and they went in the water to play with the fishes and pluck the water lilies. Hou and Xiao Yao dove into the water and were relaxed and playful. Hou knew Xiao Yao\u2019s powers were weak but playfully took her deeper until she had one breath left. He wanted to help her but Xiao Yao smiled and took out a fish amethyst from her robe and popped it in her mouth. She could now hold her breath longer than him in the water.They came to the surface and Xiao Yao climbed on the boat and spit out the fish amethyst and took out a cloth to wipe it. It glowed purple as it dangled on a chain from her neck.Hou said \u201cSo the fish amethyst ended up in your hands. Jing gave it to you, right? Years ago he claimed some mysterious person bought it but it turned out to be himself.\u201dXiao Yao openly confirmed \u201cJing gave it to me.\u201dHou remarked \u201cSo it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t like all jewels. Jing really knows what you do like.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThis actually all relates back to you. Remember years ago when we all went out to sea and you captured a monster fish and removed a fish ruby from its innards. Both Xing Yue and I were enchanted by it and I wanted it then but Xing Yue asked first. You said no and since I wasn\u2019t familiar with you then I didn\u2019t even bother asking. Later I asked Feng Long and Jing about it and wanted to ask my Dad to find me one. But such things come by luck and even the Gao Xing Palace can\u2019t easily obtain one that pretty. I don\u2019t like ordinary ones and was quite disappointed but Jing kept on looking and got me this fish amethyst.\u201dHou remembered that day and Xing Yue did ask him for it but he said no. Xiao Yao stood with Feng Long and Jing discussing it afterwards. Hou\u2019s anger bubbled forth but he kept his smile plastered on his face \u201cSo I\u2019m the one who helped Jing out.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark, let\u2019s go back!\u201dHou said \u201cThree days later then?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cSure!\u201dThree days later Xiao Yao met up with Hou and he rowed them on a little boat into the water lilies before stopping and asking \u201cCan I see your fish amethyst?\u201dXiao Yao took it off and handed it to Hou who palmed it in his hand and sneered inwardly that Jing really put effort into it as he likely made it himself.Hou said to Xiao Yao \u201cClose your eyes.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhy?\u201dHou said \u201cClose your eyes and you\u2019ll see.\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Hou but refused to close her eyes so he coughed and pleaded with her \u201cTrust me, close your eyes.\u201dXiao Yao closed her eyes and Hou placed the necklace back around her neck and said \u201cOkay, open your eyes now.\u201dXiao Yao opened her eyes and laughed \u201cWhy so secretive to put my necklace back on me?\u201dHou pointed to Xiao Yao\u2019s chest and she looked down to see a s.h.i.+ning red fish ruby that was even bigger than her fish amethyst. She happily lifted it up and stared with excitement \u201cYou\u2019re giving this to me?\u201dHou said \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you. But you can only wear one necklace, so if you want this then you can\u2019t wear the fish amethyst anymore.\u201d Hou opened his hand and inside was the fish amethyst necklace.Xiao Yao stared at the fish amethyst and furrowed her brows before taking off the fish ruby to hand back to Hou coldly \u201cYour gift is not sincere so I\u2019m not interested!\u201dHou didn\u2019t take the fish ruby back and kept the fish amethyst in his hand as he pleaded \u201cI just wanted to say that eventually you\u2019ll have to choose. But I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re willing.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and swung the fish ruby \u201cI don\u2019t like being pressured otherwise no matter how great something is, I don\u2019t want it!\u201dHou believed her, there were few women in the world who would let go of Chi Sui Feng Long so Xiao Yao really was an odd one. Hou said \u201cI\u2019ll keep this fish amethyst for you and later you can ask for it back or throw it away, you decide.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and put the fish ruby back around her neck.They two played on the lake for a bit longer before Hou took Xiao Yao back.Xiao Yao was cool and calm until she returned to Xiao Yue Summit\u00a0and her little bamboo hut. She immediately hugged Shan Hu and hopped around excitedly \u201cI got it, I finally got it!\u201dShan Han was jostled and asked \u201cWhat did you get?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI got the key that will unlock the truth.\u201dWith Hou\u2019s att.i.tude towards jewelry, even the most rare precious fish ruby that can only be found by luck he likely wouldn\u2019t care to keep it. He kept this fish ruby around for sixty some years then it had to be his gift to Yi Yang. But Jing saw this fish ruby before and Yi Yang was Jing\u2019s wife so she couldn\u2019t wear it. Yi Yang knew she was cheating so she wouldn\u2019t risk keeping it with her, and neither would Hou risk it, so even if it was gifted to Yi Yang it would still be kept by Hou. Yi Yang likely only wore it when she was alone with Hou.Ever since the baby was born, Yi Yang and Hou were even more vigilant to keep up pretenses and never once met privately and even publicly argued with each other. This fish ruby was likely kept in a box somewhere hidden by Hou and forgotten. It wasn\u2019t until he saw Xiao Yao\u2019s fish amethyst that he remembered that victory prize from that day.An item Hou kept in a box for tens of years, he wouldn\u2019t have a problem using it to win another woman\u2019s heart, especially if that woman was the one Jing really wanted.Xiao Yao asked Zhuan Xu to organize another banquet for her, like last time it had to be on the water and invite Hou, Jing, Yi Yang, and Chang.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cThese days you\u2019ve been hanging around Hou. What\u2019s going on?\u201dEven though Xiao Yao was secretive about meeting Hou, she never tried to hide it from Zhuan Xu so she smiled \u201cYou\u2019ll know soon what I\u2019m up to.\u201dTen days later, the Li Jie Consort organized a banquet for friends to explore the Sheng Nong gorges.It was Summer time so the Li Jie Consort naturally picked a boating excursion even without Xiao Xiao suggesting it.The Li Jie Consort was the older cousin of the tribe leader Li Jie Chang, she was a very open and engaging woman and invited her close friends and her cousin Chang\u2019s close friends. The guests numbered around twenty or so and everyone took a s.h.i.+p into the middle of the lake.When Xiao Yao arrived all the guests were in attendance and her eyes flitted across Jing and Yi Yang before landing on Hou. He smiled at her and she smiled back before sitting down behind the Li Jie Consort.After the musical performance was done, everyone split into groups to chat.The Li Jie Consort chatted with Yi Yang about fas.h.i.+on while Xiao Yao and Shan Hu stood by the railing admiring the view.Chang dragged Jing over and asked with a huff \u201cWhat is your relations.h.i.+p with Hou?\u201dFrom Spring until Summer, Xiao Yao met with Hou tens of times and it wasn\u2019t something that could be kept from the clan and tribe leaders. Xiao Yao was afraid Chang or Jing would demand answers from her so she avoided them.Xiao Yao glanced at Jing before answering in annoyance \u201cWhat do you care what my relations.h.i.+p is with Hou?\u201dChang was enraged \u201cSince you\u2019re with Jing, then you shouldn\u2019t meet privately with Hou.\u201dXiao Yao laughed coldly \u201cI\u2019m just ordinary friends with Jing, and also ordinary friends with Hou. You stop b.u.t.ting in!\u201dHou stood in the shadows and heard what Xiao Yao said and his face darkened.Hou said to the crowd \u201cI heard this lake has silver fish that love eating lily dew so its meat has the scent of lilies. Whether grilled or in soup it\u2019s mighty tasty. But it\u2019s very sensitive so hides in deep places and is hard to catch. And must be cooked immediately upon catching it otherwise the meat will turn sour. We have a great chef onboard today and I also have a fish amethyst so I\u2019ll go catch some for everyone to eat.\u201dThe Li Jie Consort was very playful and laughed \u201cIf you can catch some then I\u2019ll cook it personally. My culinary skills are not all that shabby against the chef.\u201dHou walked to the railing and took out his glittering fish amethyst and everyone stared at it. Jing was stunned that his present to Xiao Yao would end up in Hou\u2019s hand and his dismay was evident. Xiao Yao seemed rather awkward and lowered her head to avoid Jing\u2019s pained look.Hou glanced over at them before diving into the lake. After he dove in did Xiao Yao lift her head and glance at Jing whose expression was as placid as water and impossible to discern his feeling. Xiao Yao took a few steps and walked beside him but didn\u2019t try to explain.After some time, Hou emerged on the surface with a two feet long silver fish in his hand. Everyone clapped in glee and the mood on the s.h.i.+p got excited as the Li Jie Consort rolled up her sleeves to head to the kitchen to cook the fish.Hou saw Xiao Yao and Jing standing next to each other on the s.h.i.+p with no smiles on their faces. Hou smiled and beckoned towards Xiao Yao\u2019s general direction \u201cWant to come catch silver fish? It\u2019s fun.\u201dA few folks dived into the water and Xiao Yao glanced at Jing before wordlessly diving in as well.Jing stared at Hou who floated on the surface and locked eyes with Jing, a look of wanting Jing to take it all in. After Xiao Yao swam to his side, Hou slowly swam into the distance with Xiao Yao.Yi Yang saw Hou beckon in Xiao Yao\u2019s direction to invite her into the water to play. Her heart jerked even if others also went in. She thought she was overthinking it and what Hou said was meant for everyone on the s.h.i.+p and not just Xiao Yao. But when Xiao Yao dove into the water and swam alongside Hou as everyone watched, their gestures were not overly close but her woman\u2019s intuition told her something wasn\u2019t right.Yi Yang was unsettled and looked towards Jing and saw Chang angrily saying something to Jing who just quietly stared out over the lake.There wasn\u2019t a lot of people on the s.h.i.+p to begin with, and with a handful in the water and the rest around the Li Jie Consort cooking, Yi Yang noticed no one was paying her any attention so she sneaked to the rear of the s.h.i.+p to listen to Chang and Jing talk.Yi Yang didn\u2019t dare get too close but she learned archery since she was young so her hearing was excellent. She heard Chang mention Hou and Xiao Yao so she calmed her senses to hear better.\u201d\u201cThat witch meets secretly with Hou every few days, going out to play, viewing flowers, climbing mountains\u2026..she claims to just be ordinary friends but do you believe that? I don\u2019t!\u201dHou and Xiao Yao meeting secretly? Yi Yang couldn\u2019t believe it, Hou would never! Would never\u2026\u2026\u2026.Yi Yang was waiting for Jing to refute what Chang was saying but Jing said nothing as if admitting what Chang said was all true.Then\u2026..Hou and Xiao Yao really had been meeting secretly for some time?Yi Yang felt her eyes darken and her head spin.Chang furiously raged \u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s all one-sided from Hou. When he called her back there she plopped right into the water and left you! Jing, are you blind, how could you fall for such a woman\u2026\u2026.\u201dYi Yang felt like she fell into an ice cave, her entire body was s.h.i.+vering as she thought about how the whole world knew about Hou and Xiao Yao and only she was kept in the dark.The Li Jie Consort called out \u201cYi Yang, Yi Yang, come try my fish.\u201dYi Yang composed herself and forced and smile as she walked over.The maid handed a plate of fish to Yi Yang but it wasn\u2019t clear if Yi Yang was out of it or the maid was clumsy but the fish landed on her dress and left an oily smear. The maid knelt down to beg forgiveness but Yi Yang waved it off \u201cJust a dress, I\u2019ll just go change.\u201dThe Li Jie Consort ordered another maid to lead Yi Yang to the inner chamber to change. After changing, the maid asked if she wanted to head back out but Yi Yang sat there with her face ashen and said nothing. The maid said nothing as well and quietly waited for her.Yi Yang\u2019s heart was jumbled, thinking it must be false but then thinking what Chang said was true. This wasn\u2019t something hard to confirm if she sent someone to check.Just as Yi Yang was trying to collect her thoughts, the door opened and a wet Xiao Yao walked in. She politely nodded her head and walked inside. Yi Yang remembered Xiao Yao had very low powers so while others could dry themselves she actually needed to change her clothes.Through the veiled part.i.tion she could see Xiao Yao changing. Xiao Yao was giggling with Shan Hu \u201cI don\u2019t want that skirt, bring another one.\u201dYi Yang was annoyed just hearing Xiao Yao\u2019s voice and was about to get up and leave when Shan Hu lifted the veil and before it descended Yi Yang\u2019s eyes glanced inside and felt a fire red burst sear her eyes. She turned around to look carefully but the veil was covering Xiao Yao again.Yi Yang forgot all about courtesy and walked over to pull open the veiled part.i.tion and saw Xiao Yao wearing her underclothes and a red fish ruby was hanging on her chest covering. Yi Yang couldn\u2019t even maintain her balance and stumbled so she grabbed the wall.Shan Hu angrily said \u201cMadam, the Princess is changing.\u201dYi Yang didn\u2019t seem to hear that and just stared at Xiao Yao. She forced a smile and casually asked \u201cThe fish ruby Princess has sure is lovely. Not sure where to buy one, can I see it?\u201dXiao Yao put on her dress and took off the necklace and tossed it to Yi Yang who quickly caught it afraid it would break. Xiao Yao laughed \u201cJust a little trinket, Madam no need to worry, no big deal if it breaks.\u201dSuch words Yi Yang heard often from people trying to show off how little they care about expensive treasure. Being in the Tu Shan clan, no matter how rare a treasure she could get it, but today Yi Yang finally understood that whether something was priceless was how the person viewed it. She treasured this so much she would use her body to protect it, but to Xiao Yao it was just a trinket she could toss carelessly.At first glance Yi Yang already knew this fish ruby was the one Hou gave her. But she didn\u2019t want to believe it so had to hold it in her own hands to be absolutely sure. She realized that her heart which Hou should have cherished and hidden away was instead now given to another woman who viewed it as a trinket that could be tossed.Yi Yang returned the necklace and said \u201cIt\u2019s very pretty.\u201dXiao Yao accepted it with a smile and put it back around her neck.Yi Yang glanced at the fire red ruby around Xiao Yao\u2019s neck which brought out her snowy white skin and made it even more beautiful. When Hou was meeting privately with Xiao Yao, did he also roll it around her body and say \u201cOnly such fire red could match your snowy white skin.\u201dYi Yang abruptly turned around and walked out the door.Xiao Yao saw Yi Yang leave and the smile disappeared from her face. She sat down and sighed loudly, feeling exhausted. This battle was waged from Spring until Summer and with this moment, she did everything she could and the rest was up to Jing.Shan Hu silently fixed Xiao Yao\u2019s clothes and asked \u201cPrincess, want me to get you some hot tea?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cNo, I\u2019ll rest for a bit before departing on a little boat. Send word to Jing to meet me at the usual spot after he extricates himself.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dXiao Yao went out and had some silver fish before excusing herself with the Li Jie Consort. She was so easygoing she didn\u2019t mind but asked \u201cHis majesty might come soon, you\u2019re not going to wait?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cNo, I see him everyday anyway.\u201dThe Li Jie Consort ordered the little boat readied and it took Xiao Yao back.Xiao Yao left on the little boat not to go back to Xiao Yue Summit but to Cao Ao Peak and the little hut that remained the same after all these years. Back then she often met Jing there and today Xiao Yao looked around the hut before sitting by the edge of the pond to wait for Jing.After quite some time, Jing finally arrived.Jing sat down next to Xiao Yao and she looked sideways at him \u201cAre you upset to see the present you gave me in Hou\u2019s possession?\u201dJing said \u201cIf you really gave it to him, I\u2019m not going to get upset with you over an item. Xiao Yao, tell me what you\u2019re really planning?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYou must\u2019ve guess bits and pieces already.\u201dJing said \u201cSome idea but I hope I\u2019m wrong. Xiao Yao, I don\u2019t want you to\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao took out the fish ruby from her sleeve \u201cRegardless of whether you want me to or not, I\u2019m done with my part. The rest is up to you.\u201dJing took the fish ruby \u201cThis is\u2026.the one that Hou got from the monster fish in the sea years ago?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cWhen you saw Hou holding something you gave to me, you trusted that there was nothing going on between me and him. But you felt a bit bad still, right?\u201dJing mockingly said \u201cMy first reaction was shock and despair, but I immediately knew you were planning something else. I don\u2019t know exactly what and I can\u2019t help you, so I can only remain calm and unaffected, to let no reaction be my only action.\u201dXiao Yao contained her smile \u201cDo you think Hou and Yi Yang will have our level of trust? When Yi Yang saw the fish ruby in my hands, what will she think?\u201dJing understood everything now \u201cHou gave this fish ruby to Yi Yang, but now to win your affection, he gave it to you.\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cIt was just a guess initially but today Yi Yang\u2019s reaction confirmed it for me. Soon their promise will be shattered as Yi Yang will be sure to go find Hou. When Hou can\u2019t give the fish ruby to her, she will explode and Hou will need to use everything he can to placate Yi Yang\u2026..do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Hou and Yi Yang\u2019s had a mutual secret that lead to them acting in tandem without any weakness. But Xiao Yao wedged a rift between them now and they would start to question each other and that would disrupt their plans.Jing controlled his excitement and thought carefully before saying \u201cXiao Yao, can you lend me your mystical gorilla mirror?\u201dXiao Yoa knew what Jing was planning, to use the mirror to rePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI\u2019m sorry for the readers on such a long gap in publis.h.i.+ng another translated chapter of Lost You Forever. But I\u2019m not sorry for myself because I desperately needed a breather from the breakneck pace as well as a bit of regrouping on my energy and conviction for this project. It\u2019s sooooo long and once I hit volume three with the last chapter it felt like a giant boulder came cras.h.i.+ng down from seeing how far I\u2019ve finished and how much more I need to do to bring this amazing Chinese novel to the English-speaking audience. The sabbatical gave me back my sanity, and time to deal with real life conundrums as convoluted as any K-drama, and now I\u2019m back to hopefully keep on going and stick to my earlier pace. Chapter 34 was actually a good break point if any since it ended as happy as can be for Xiao Yao. She got back together with Jing! The nicest sweetest feller in the vast wilderness and the loverboy she had to pine over for years on end when they broke up.Xiang Liu s.h.i.+ppers might be annoyed Xiao Yao keeps sticking with the reliable and altogether too soft-hearted Jing, but honestly she can\u2019t do any better than him. No girl would marry Zhuan Xu and join his harem, however much Zhuan Xu himself doesn\u2019t even want said harem. The reality is his harem is there and he\u2019s got to do right by them otherwise his empire starts wobbling. And my boy Xiang Liu is about as suitable for a girl to hitch a ride to as a wild stallion with a death wish. I am happy Xiao Yao and Jing managed to destroy Hou and Yi Yang and get back together in one fell swoop. I was tired of Jing constantly being targeted and moping around like a walking dead person, and I need Xiao Yao to start figuring her life out and she can\u2019t do that unless she gets some emotional closure or happiness. Too bad that happiness isn\u2019t going to last long and this chapter brings Xiao Yao\u2019s real ident.i.ty out in the open in a way big along with a past she can no longer refuse to acknowledge. Luckily her three men are all around to help her deal with it in their own way.Chapter 35 \u2013 Where Did Such Person Come From:Xiao Yao opened a little medical clinic in a rundown alley in Zhi Yi Castle. It wasn\u2019t her first time opening a clinic but this time wasn\u2019t like in Qing Shui Town when she used the Sheng Nong Herb Manual tricks to earn a living. It also wasn\u2019t like on Five G.o.ds Mountain when she was pa.s.sing time, this time she was sincerely using her medical skills to save lives.Xiao Yao practiced medicine at the same time she kept learning, she didn\u2019t go to the cla.s.s anymore since the medical teaching there wasn\u2019t enough for her needs anymore. She had Zhuan Xu order the best doctor in the Xuan Yuan Palace to personally teach her.Zhuan Xu smiled: My best doctor is Yin but he\u2019s a mute and hard to communicate with.Xiao Yao replied: No problem, I can learn sign language.Yin was a medical savant and thought it a waste of his time to teach Xiao Yao but couldn\u2019t disobey Zhuan Xu\u2019s command. He reluctantly came but after interacting with Xiao Yao he was truly happy that he did come.Xiao Yao\u2019s medical knowledge could not compare to Yin who learned since childhood, but she wandered the world, lived in the wilderness, and spent hundreds of years delving into poisons. Her personal knowledge of herbs was far greater than Yin\u2019s understanding and she could rattle off anything so Yin felt like he wasn\u2019t teaching Xiao Yao as much as she was teaching him.In two more months was year end and another new year was arriving.Jing was alone now but he was still the clan leader and all matters big and small still rested with him. He needed to be in Qing Qiu for the new year so Xiao Yao wanted to wait until after the festivities was over before taking Jing back to Five G.o.ds Mountain for a short stay.Jing was willing and joked: As long as your dad doesn\u2019t object, I\u2019m at your beck and call.Xiao Yao took a jade cannister from Jing\u2019s desk and wrote a letter to her dad with a laugh: Dad\u2026..will of course do whatever I want.Jing waited until Xiao Yao finished the letter before saying: Recently, there is a rumor spreading in the major clans and families. I\u2019m not sure if anyone has told you?\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYears ago in the Plum Blossom Canyon, it wasn\u2019t just one person who intended to kill you, it was actually four people.\u201dXiao Yao casually replied \u201cI know, other than the Mu Fei that my Grandfather executed, there are three more people. Xing Yue said my Gege secretly had them all killed. Because of this, the Gong and the Cheng families were furious with my Gege.\u201dJing\u2019s expression was dark \u201cThis matter coming up has led to talk about why these four people would disregard their good future ahead and risk getting diced into thousands of pieces by the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Emperor in order to harm you.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s body stiffened, she remembered every word Mu Fei said in the kill maze. She tried to forget it but never really did.Jing said \u201cThese four people only have one thing in common \u2013 they are orphans from families exterminated by Qi Yo. So once the rumor has emerged it will only spread like wildfire. The source that wants to spread this rumor will point the finger at\u2026\u2026..\u201d Jing paused as if unable to finish the thought.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cMe being Qi Yo\u2019s b.a.s.t.a.r.d daughter, right?\u201dSince she was small this remained her scariest nightmare. She was frightened to have it confirmed which led her to not return to Five G.o.ds Mountain to reunite with her dad. She had thought it was all over but who knew the nightmare would catch up to her.\u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t call yourself that.\u201dXiao Yao looked out the window and her eyes reflected her fear. She knew how to face any danger but right now she really didn\u2019t know how to face this.Jing said \u201cVery few people knew the truth about what happened back then, if the Gong or Cheng families knew then they would have spread it already and not wait until today. That leaves only Feng Long and Xing Yue\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIf not Feng Long then it\u2019s Xing Tue. I shamed the Chi Sui clan so if they wanted to destroy me that would be understandable.\u201dJing said \u201cIt\u2019s likelier that it\u2019s Xing Yue.\u201dXiao Yao was frazzled and sighed \u201cForget it! I don\u2019t want to think about it. We can\u2019t stop the rumor and it\u2019s not like I get to decide whose daughter I am. Only my mom can confirm it but she\u2019s not here anymore. Let them say whatever they want!\u201dJing Ye reported from outside the room \u201cMaster, Shan Hu is here to pick up the Princess.\u201dXiao Yao got up and put the letter container in her sleeve \u201cI\u2019m headed back to Xiao Yue Summit.\u201dJing accompanied Xiao Yao out the back door where a cloud carriage was waiting with a boy-dressed Shan Hu. Xiao Yao paused and stared at the vines growing on the wall without getting on.Jing softly asked \u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t look at Jing and said in a low voice \u201cIf\u2026.I\u2019m saying if, everyone believes I\u2019m Qi Yo\u2019s\u2026\u2026and everyone hates me, you\u2026\u2026\u201dJing pulled Xiao Yao into his arms \u201cDon\u2019t ask such silly questions, when you saved me you were just you. Not anyone\u2019s daughter, and I decided then I would be with you until I die.\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but lightly rest her head on Jing\u2019s shoulder as Jing patted her back \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this will pa.s.s soon.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Yao smiled at Jing and hurried onto the cloud carriage.As the cloud carriage rose into the air, a carrier bird arrive and landed on Shan Hu\u2019s shoulder as she asked \u201cPrincess, didn\u2019t you have a letter to send to His majesty? The carrier bird is here.\u201dXiao Yao tightly clenched the letter container and Shan Hu saw Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t responding \u201cPrincess?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI haven\u2019t written the letter yet.\u201dShan Hu was perplexed but didn\u2019t press further and waved for the bird to leave.That night Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Summit and Xiao Yao wanted to tell him about what Jing told her. Then she realized if Jing knew then there was no way Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t know. If he didn\u2019t say anything to her then it was for her not to worry about it. If Zhuan Xu can stop the rumor and make it go away, then there was no need to worry her over it. If Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t stop it, then telling her now made no difference.Xiao Yao decided not to confer with Zhuan Xu about this. Since she couldn\u2019t do anything, let Zhuan Xu take care of it!Due to her childhood experiences, Xiao Yao was naturally pessimistic and always expected the worst. This time, perhaps due to the people helping her being Zhuan Xu and Jing, the Black Emperor and the Tu Shan clan leader, even the normally pessimistic Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but feel hopeful \u2013 the rumors would be quashed and everything would return to normal.But in less than a month, the rumor that Xiao Yao was Qi Yo\u2019s b.a.s.t.a.r.d daughter exploded wide open in the vast wilderness.When everyone heard this rumor, naturally two sides formed. One side believed it and one side didn\u2019t. Those who didn\u2019t believe it scoffed at how absurd the rumor was. The best evidence was the Xuan Yuan Princess killed Qi Yo herself. Those who believed it had their own evidence, the ones who saw Qi Yo before tried to remember what he looked like and created a portrait of him and his picture convinced them that Xiao Yao looked more like Qi Yo.Gradually more and more details added to the uncontrollable rumor, with some unable to accept how the Xuan Yuan Princess who killed Qi Yo could have bore him a child so some speculated that the vicious Qi Yo raped the Xuan Yuan Princess.In Gao Xing, the Grand Emperor\u2019s esteem led to people there choosing to believe his determination that Xiao Yao was his daughter. But privately they couldn\u2019t help being angry at the Princess who was bringing speculative shame to Gao Xing and wished that she was never found.In Xuan Yuan, the hatred of Qi Yo was so overwhelming that more and more people started leaning towards believing that Xiao Yao was Qi Yo\u2019s b.a.s.t.a.r.d.Qi Yo led the Sheng Nong army and laid siege to Xuan Yuan Castle. He killed and plundered and his soldiers stacked dead Xuan Yuan bodies as high as a mountain. Almost every Xuan Yuan family had someone die under Qi Yo\u2019s hands and the Xuan Yuan elders hated him to the bone.The Middle Plains families also hated Qi Yo. He was brutal and relentless and also killed countless in the Middle Plains. Many entire families were wiped out by him and even the Six Big Families had to beg before him. This shame and rage lasted through the centuries and the hatred for Qi Yo never abated.There were very few common elements between the Xuan Yuan and the Middle Plains families, but on the hatred of Qi Yo, both sides were in complete alignment. The entire Xuan Yuan kingdom hated Qi Yo from top to bottom but his death left no one for them to release the rage towards. All they could do was spit on his memory. Now that Qi Yo\u2019s daughter appeared, people had a concrete target for their rage and all the long simmering pain was awakened and they all transferred their hatred of Qi Yo onto Xiao Yao.Of course those in high places remained rational about this while those without power had no ability to harm Xiao Yao. Ultimately it didn\u2019t matter who her dad was, she was still the Yellow Emperor\u2019s granddaughter and this was an una.s.sailable fact. They transformed their rage into curses and from restaurants to docks there was the relentless cursing of Xiao Yao. Some brazen Middle Plains families even gathered at the base of Sheng Nong Mountain and yelled \u201cQi Yo\u2019s b.a.s.t.a.r.d get out of Sheng Nong Mountain!\u201dAll sorts of pleadings reached Zhuan Xu, some tactful and other boldly, all aiming for the same goal of having Zhuan Xu send the Gao Xing Eldest Princess back to Gao Xing.Xiao Yao bitterly smiled, they hated her because they believed she wasn\u2019t the Grand Emperor\u2019s daughter, then why ask to send her back to Gao Xing? Were they hoping the Grand Emperor would believe the rumor and have her killed?The year end was arriving but Xiao Yao never mentioned to Jing again to go back to Five G.o.ds Mountain.The Grand Emperor sent Xiao Yao four letters, none of them were long but contained unbridled love. The Grand Emperor didn\u2019t pretend he didn\u2019t know about the rumors and brought it up himself, comforting Xiao Yao not to worry about it.Xiao Yao placed his letters under her pillow and slept every night curled against them as it formed a protective barrier to keep the hurtful gossip at bay.On the last day of the year, Jing had to return to Qing Qiu to leave a clan prayer ceremony while Zhuan Xu held a banquet on Zhi Jin Peak for his hundreds of officials.Xiao Yao spent it on Xiao Yue Summit with the Yellow Emperor, one young one old the two of them enjoyed a table of food and happily chatted as they waited for the new year to arrive.At midnight, the skies on Zhi Jin Peak lit up with thousands of fireworks that brightened the entire night. Xiao Yao ran to the window to watch the fireworks and the Yellow Emperor also got off the pallet and stood behind Xiao Yao to watch the pink and purple lights explode and then disappear like the world\u2019s most elusive dream.Xiao Yao\u2019s voice floated over in the sound of the thunderous explosions \u201cGrandfather, whose daughter am I?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor placed his hand on Xiao Yao\u2019s shoulder and said nothing for the longest time. Xiao Yao lowered her head waiting for his answer. After some time, the Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou are the granddaughter of the founding Emperor of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom and his Empress Lei Zhu. This will never change. As long as I am there, Xuan Yuan will forever be your home!\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cSo Grandfather doesn\u2019t know either.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor shook Xiao Yao \u201cDon\u2019t care about what others say, you are still you!\u201dXiao Yao raised her head and smiled at the exploding fireworks \u201cThis is fine. Since Mom is dead, no one will ever know the truth. I believe I\u2019m my Dad\u2019s daughter and that\u2019s enough!\u201dIn the middle of the night, Xiao Yao was long in bed when she heard the sound of her room door opening and Zhuan Xu sitting down on her pallet.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want him to know she was worried and couldn\u2019t sleep so pretended to be asleep and kept her back towards Zhuan Xu. In the darkness the thick smell of alcohol emanated from Zhuan Xu, likely his officials and courtiers plied him with G.o.d knows how much to drink.After some time he laid down and lightly embraced Xiao Yao through her blanket and said in a low voice \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I won\u2019t let them harm you. They don\u2019t understand that everything that I have is also yours. Sheng Nong Mountain, Zhe Province, Zhi Yi\u2026.it\u2019s all yours. No one can make you leave.\u201dXiao Yao bit her lip, likely the Middle Plains folks said more to Zhuan Xu and he was controlling his anger.Zhuan Xu was drunk so likely couldn\u2019t figure out past and present and he murmured \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, I\u2019m all grown up now and no one can harm you. I won\u2019t let you go to Jade Mountain\u2026\u2026you\u2019ll be with me forever!\u201d\u201cAuntie, I can protect Xiao Yao, don\u2019t send Xiao Yao to Jade Mountain\u2026.\u201d\u201cAuntie, I already told Xiao Yao that we would be together forever\u2026..Xiao Yao, don\u2019t leave! Auntie, I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026\u201dZhuan Xu fell asleep drunk while Xiao Yao\u2019s tears silently fell but she didn\u2019t know what she was crying for. The young boy of the past or the her of today.The first full moon night of the new year, Xiao Yao proactively suggested going to Zhi Yi Castle to view the lanterns. Jing and Zhuan Xu naturally agreed.Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Summit in the afternoon dressed in a cotton attire while Xiao Yao dressed as a boy and wore a hat. Jing also changed into burlap and the three left Sheng Nong Mountain on an ox-drawn carriage. They arrived and mingled with the crowds in Zhi Yi Castle, ambling to look at the lanterns.Xiao Yao looked at Jing, and then at Zhuan Xu, and started laughing \u201cWhat do we remind you guys of today?\u201dZhuan Xu and Jing exchanged a glance and Jing smiled while Zhuan Xu said \u201cA bit like our time in Qing Shui Town.\u201dXiao Yao beamed \u201cExactly!\u201dA little boy rode on his father\u2019s shoulder and said \u201cDaddy, you have to buy me candy when we get into the castle!\u201d The father responded \u201cOf course!\u201dA flicker of concern flickered across Xiao Yao\u2019s face.They entered the castle and it was nearly dark. Zhuan Xu said \u201cThe lanterns haven\u2019t been lit yet. How about let\u2019s get something to eat. Xiao Yao, what do you want to eat?\u201dSitting for so long, her body was chilled so she laughed \u201cGrilled meat of course, washed down with bowls of hard liquor.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed and said to Jing \u201cLast time you were going to treat but you took off midway. This is the perfect chance to make it up.\u201d The last time the three of them made plans to have grilled meat was in Qing Shui Town but due to the sudden appearance of Fang Feng Yi Yang, it ended up being just Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu going.Jing smiled \u201cYou still remember? Sure!\u201dAfter deciding what to eat, the two men were at wits end. One was the Emperor and the other Clan Leader, they were no longer Xuan and s.h.i.+ Qi. They didn\u2019t know where the good places to eat in town were anymore.Xiao Yao smiled and shook her head \u201cCome with me!\u201dXiao Yao led them into an alley and entered a grilled meat restaurant \u201cThis is the best one I\u2019ve ever eaten in terms of taste and cleanliness, but I haven\u2019t been in a long time so not sure if the taste is the same.\u201dAll the restaurants in the alleys and corners were places that Fang Feng Bei took her to. Faced with the two people closest to her, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t try to hide it but her voice revealed a bit of anxiousness. Both Zhuan Xu and Jing were brilliant minds and immediately figured out that Xiao Yao came in the past with Fang Feng Bei. Zhuan Xu patted Xiao Yao on the shoulder indicating for her not to over think it while Jing merely silently sighed.The store had a part.i.tion that closed off the inside area and since they arrived early, they took the secluded seat and later customers wouldn\u2019t even be able to see them inside. The three ordered lamb and beef and jugs of wine. The fire was burning hot and the stiff drinks flowed into their stomachs. Zhuan Xu was especially enjoying himself and sighed \u201cIt\u2019s been so many years since I\u2019ve enjoyed myself like this. Later I should come back often.\u201dXiao Yao turned the meat and muttered \u201cSomeone wants too much, there is no way that everything good in this world will be all enjoyed by you.\u201dZhuan Xu was taken aback and then stared long and hard at Xiao Yao with a smile \u201cWho says so? I purposely want it all!\u201dXiao Yao placed a grilled meat in his plate \u201cIf you want it all then take it! The people you\u2019re tormenting is Xiao Xiao and them, not me!\u201dZhuan Xu flicked her on the forehead \u201cSo sa.s.sy! You always get the last word!\u201dXiao Yao glared at Zhuan Xu while Jing pointed to his own empty plate and playfully said in woe to Zhuan Xu \u201cShe\u2019s only mouthy with you but you get all the good, while she\u2019s all sweet smiles and joking to others but doesn\u2019t give any good.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and picked up his meat but Xiao Yao moved it over to Jing\u2019s plate. Jing smiled \u201cThanks!\u201dZhuan Xu paused and then smiled wanly to Xiao Yao \u201cGrill me another plate.\u201dXiao Yao was busy seasoning and retorted \u201cYou grill your own because I need to feed my sa.s.sy mouth otherwise where would the sa.s.s come from.\u201dZhuan Xu pleaded in a soft voice \u201cGrilling my own meat doesn\u2019t taste as good as when you grill it.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing but when the meat was done, she placed it all on Zhuan Xu\u2019s plate.Three large men walked into the store and was seated next to them. Zhuan Xu and Jing said nothing more and just listened to them order. In addition to meat, they also ordered vegetables and in this season vegetables were way more expensive than meat. Xiao Yao only ordered meat so as to not attract attention, so the group that just arrived were either wealthy or n.o.bility.Their accent was clearly Xuan Yuan and Xiao Yao whispered to Zhuan Xu \u201cDo you know them?\u201dZhuan Xu nodded and then wrote two words on the table \u201cGeneral.\u201dXiao Yao stuck her tongue out at Zhuan Xu, who told you to summon them to Sheng Nong Mountain?After they ordered suddenly all noise stopped from their side. Likely it was a spell so that others couldn\u2019t hear what they were talking about.Xiao Yao muttered \u201cMust be something secret.\u201dShe scooted closer to Jing \u201cNot fair, I was afraid of getting attention so didn\u2019t place a spell and they ended up placing the spell. If they are discussing Gege, that\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d Xiao Yao pulled Jing\u2019s sleeve \u201cI want to hear what they are saying, do you have a way?\u201dJing smiled \u201cThere\u2019s a way!\u201d He held a cup of wine and it became a white mist that traveled over to the other side and disappeared.The voices traveled over and it wasn\u2019t anything secretive or important, just comparing the new capital Zhi Yi Castle with the old capital Xuan Yuan Castle. All three were rational folks who may love their hometown but all agreed the new capital was better suited as the capital for the growing Kingdom. From their address of each other, Xiao Yao deduced that the oldest was the Great General Li Yuan, the other two, one was his brother-in-law and the other his nephew.They chatted some more about the capital and then talk turned to the Yellow Emperor. One sighed \u201cWho knows if we\u2019ll be able to see the Yellow Emperor.\u201dThe other replied \u201cWe won\u2019t but maybe uncle can see His majesty.\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Zhuan Xu who wrote \u201cLi Yuan, the guarding general of Zhe Province. He followed Grandfather in conquering the Middle Plains\u2026..\u201d his hand paused before continuing \u201cIn the Yi Province big battle, he fought under Auntie.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s smile evaporated.The three started drinking and one asked \u201cBrother-in-law, you fought with the Princess General in winning the Yi Province battle. You must\u2019ve had some close ties with her?\u201dPrincess General was the special way the Xuan Yuan forces who fought with her Mom called her. Xiao Yao tried to act nonchalant but her ears perked up to try and catch what Li Yuan said. But Yi Yuan said nothing for a long time before saying \u201cThat battle, it\u2019s hard to say we won.\u201d His words seem to bring back the pain from hundreds of years ago and everyone with him silently drank.After a period of silence, another voice asked \u201cUncle, not sure if you heard the recent rumors? The stuff about the Gao Xing Eldest Princess.\u201d\u201cI heard.\u201dLI Yuan\u2019s voice was calm and Xiao Yao\u2019s body leaned closer.\u201cUncle was friends with the Princess General. Then\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s voice paused awkwardly before saying \u201cWhose daughter is the Gao Xing Eldest Princess?\u201dLi Yuan said nothing while Xiao Yao\u2019s body was tense and stiff. Jing held her hand, she didn\u2019t notice it but subconsciously grabbed it back.Another older male voice asked \u201cBrother-in-law, it\u2019s just us three close family here, what can\u2019t you say?\u201dLi Yuan finally spoke \u201cI\u2019m not good friends with the Princess General, it\u2019s General Ying Long who was deeply close to her as friends. Years ago I reported to her but never spoke with her privately. I don\u2019t know whose daughter the Gao Xing Eldest Princess really is.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s body relaxed and she felt weak.Suddenly Li Yuan\u2019s voice spoke again: One morning, General Ying Long took me to check on the army base camp and there was loud noise from outside the camp. We rushed there to see the Princess and Qi Yo being surrounded in the middle by Qi Yo\u2019s troops\u2026.Xiao Yao\u2019s body shook as if not wanting to hear more and Jing tried to pull back the spell but she grabbed his hand with her eyes wide open like a beast staring at the distance with all her senses engaged.\u201cQi Yo\u2019s troops were loudly raging and it took me awhile to understand what they were upset about. Turns out the Princess and Qi Yo didn\u2019t come back last night and they saw them returning together this morning. They even saw them embracing in farewell. They were interrogating Qi Yo who said nothing. General Ying Long yelled back at the other side and soon the crowd was about to disperse when suddenly the Princess yelled out to everyone \u201cI am in love with Qi Yo.\u201d We were all stunned and though she forgot to add the word \u201cnot\u201d in there. But the Princess loudly added \u201cI\u2019ve loved Qi Yo for hundreds of years!\u201d Her voice was so loud as if she wanted the entire world to hear it.\u201dLike she was in the grips of a nightmare, Xiao Yao was so frightened she couldn\u2019t move and the voices appeared to be coming from far away.\u201cW\u2026..wh\u2026..Why? Qi Yo\u2026.Qi Yo is a big demon devil!\u201d The young man\u2019s voice stuttered and was filled with woe, unable to accept that the idol Princess General who died for her country and people could have liked Qi Yo. He would have rather that she was raped by him.Li Yuan\u2019s normally calm voice grew harsh \u201cI know you both are asking not because of the rumors, but also because folks are pressuring you to join in harming the Gao Xing Eldest Princess. I\u2019m warning you now \u2013 NO! As long as General Ying Long and I are alive, no one in my army can ever harm the daughter of the Princess General!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.but\u2026.Uncle\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo buts!\u201d Li Yuan\u2019s voice carried ten tons of weight as befitting a seasoned soldier of the battlefield.Both men immediately responded like soldiers \u201cYes!\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s voice returned to calm \u201cThere is much hards.h.i.+p and difficult choices in life that you guys haven\u2019t experienced before so you don\u2019t understand. The Princess gave up everything so you guys will never need to experience it. Qi Yo\u2026.he was our enemy but he was worthy of the Princess to love!\u201d After saying that Li Yuan got up and left.The other two sat for a moment before running out after him.\u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao raised her head and saw Zhuan Xu and Jing worriedly looking at her. Xiao Yao\u2019s lips moved but her throat was dry and no words came out. Jing handed water to her but she shook her head but accepted the bowl of wine from Zhuan Xu. She gulped down the wine and when the burning went through her tongue she felt like she was alive again.It was dark already and the lanterns lit up the street. Xiao Yao was sitting straight and didn\u2019t look at Jing or Zhuan Xu, only looking out the window.After a long time, she was unusually calm but also very certain \u201cI am Qi Yo\u2019s daughter!\u201dZhuan Xu hurriedly said \u201cXiao Yao, it doesn\u2019t matter whose daughter you are, you are the dearest person to me.\u201dJing slowly said \u201cXiao Yao, when we first me, you were just you, not anyone\u2019s daughter. In the future, it doesn\u2019t matter whose daughter you are, you\u2019re still just you.\u201dXiao Yao stood up and walked outside. Zhuan Xu and Jing followed but she said \u201cI want to be alone, you guys don\u2019t follow me!\u201dBoth Jing and Zhuan Xu stopped in their tracks and watched her leave.After Xiao Yao walked far, a little astral white fox jumped out of Jing\u2019s sleeve and disappeared into the night. Zhuan Xu walked out of the restaurant and said to his personal guards \u201cSend a few to protect the Princess.\u201dZhuan Xu coolly said to Jing \u201cThe guards will take Xiao Yao back to Xiao Yue Summit, you head back to rest!\u201dZhuan Xu was leaving when Jing asked \u201cYour majesty, why did you do that?\u201dZhuan Xu slowly turned back around. The crowds were rus.h.i.+ng past below the steps but on the steps, either the guards were keeping a barrier or there simply was no one else headed that way, it was oddly silent with only Jing and Zhuan Xu staring at each other under the lamp light.Zhuan Xu had a mocking smile on the corner of his lips \u201cHow did you find out?\u201dJing said \u201cI initially thought it was the Empress since she wants to hurt Xiao Yao and has the power to spread the rumors. I thought Your majesty would be working to staunch the rumors but as much as I tried, even using the power of the three clans of Xi Ling, Gui Fang, and Tu Shan, it could not stop the rumors. I realized it didn\u2019t appear to be the Empress since the power behind the rumors was too great. Tonight it appears Xiao Yao made all the choices but if Your majesty wanted Xiao Yao to be undisturbed, then General Li Yuan and his group would not have been able to enter the restaurant. The only explanation is that Your majesty wanted Xiao Yao to accidentally meet General Li Yuan\u2019s group.\u201dZhuan Xu calmly said \u201cFeng Long told me once that you are smarter than anyone he knows. I didn\u2019t really believe him then but today it appears you deserve Feng Long\u2019s praise.\u201dJing said \u201cYour majesty, it\u2019s not Xiao Yao being not smart enough to figure it out, it\u2019s that she will never ever believe that you would hurt her.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s smile vanished and he coldly said \u201cI did it because I want to protect her.\u201dJing already knew Zhuan Xu\u2019s intentions but to have it confirmed still shook him to the core. He silently stepped off the steps and bid farewell \u201cYour humble citizen I shall be going.\u201dXiao Yao wandered with the lantern viewing crowds and didn\u2019t have a destination in mind. She didn\u2019t know how many streets she walked or how many lanterns she saw. She wandered down a decrepit alley until she was standing in front of a ramshackle door and she realized that this was where she wanted to go all along.Xiao Yao pushed open the door but instead of the fragrant donkey meat cooking in the yard it was cold and empty inside. That old one-armed man who cooked delicious donkey meat, he wasn\u2019t cooking it anymore?Xiao Yao walked into the courtyard where it was pitch black with no sign of life. The moon reflected down on the tables stacked in the corner which was covered in dust.Xiao Yao knocked on the door \u201cIs anyone here? Old uncle, old uncle\u2026.\u201dNo one answered and Xiao Yao walked into the residence where an altar was set up on the table and three burning incense sticks was lit before it. This tableau told her exactly where the old man had gone.Xiao Yao stood there for awhile before walking inside and sitting down on the pallet.The residence was already old but having no one live in it gave it a musty scent but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to leave. Perhaps this was the only place that welcomed her.Xiao Yao stared at the altar and silently sat there for awhile before suddenly asking \u201cOld uncle, they said you were once a general for Qi Yo, you must be very familiar with him! Did you ever meet my mom before? Actually I\u2019ve wanted to come talk to you for a long time but I never had the guts to do it! I avoided anything related to Qi Yo but now I can\u2019t avoid it any longer. I finally have the courage to come ask you \u2013 what kind of person was Qi Yo? Is he really a demon devil b.a.s.t.a.r.d like everyone says he is? Did he ever talk about my mom with you? Did he know of my existence? I have so many questions to ask you, but you\u2019re already gone\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao leaned against the wall and closed her eyes, her tears broke through the sea wall and flooded her face.The donkey meat cooking old general was the only person left in the world who knew Qi Yo. She had thousands of opportunities to come ask him but she didn\u2019t come, and now she was here it was already too late.Xiao Yao opened her mouth to scream in pain but no sound came out. The utmost pain mixed with her suppression caused her entire body to quake \u201cOld uncle, everyone hates him, everyone hates him! I also hate him\u2026..but I just want to hear one person who didn\u2019t hate him tell me about him. Tell me that I shouldn\u2019t hate him. I want to know what kind of person he was\u2026.. Old uncle, no matter where I go everyone curses him and you\u2019re likely the only person in the world who doesn\u2019t curse him. But now you\u2019re gone as well\u2026\u2026 I hate him! I hate him\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao kept repeating \u201cI hate him\u201d \u2013 she hated Qi Yo for bringing such shame to her mom and her, she hated that he never once gave her a father\u2019s care and love, she hated even more that they abandoned her. If they didn\u2019t want her, why give birth to her?But coming here tonight, she didn\u2019t want to say \u201cI hate him\u201d, she desperately wanted someone to give her a reason not to hate, a reason so she could candidly face the world cursing and spitting upon her.But, the last person was also gone! All she knew about her dad was the world\u2019s curses!In her teary eyes, Xiao Yao saw a shape appear from the corner of the dark room. Xiao Yao immediately used her arms to cover her face and wipe away her tears.\u201cWho are you? Why are you hiding there?\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s voice was scratchy but she was already calm.The shadow didn\u2019t speak but also didn\u2019t leave, instead it walked over to the pallet.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t raise her head but clearly felt it, the other heart was walking towards her and beating with her heart \u201cXiang Liu!\u201dXiao Yao lifted her head and saw Xiang Liu dressed all in black with a black cloak covered him, wrapping his entire form snugly in pure black. He seemed like an imposing but ordinary person, until the slight gap in his hat showed a few white hairs.Xiao Yao suddenly realized he saw her earlier crying and loss of composure and felt very awkward so she coldly asked \u201cWhy are you hiding here? To see something you can mock?\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cBe reasonable, okay? I came to pay my respects to a departed old friend and you suddenly barged in. It\u2019s you who interrupted me! Furthermore, what is there about you that is worth mocking?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t General Xiang Liu hear that I\u2019m the b.a.s.t.a.r.d daughter of Qi Yo?\u201dXiang Liu laughed and his cold expression softened a bit \u201cSo it\u2019s that business! What\u2019s so mockworthy about that? Tell me.\u201dXiao Yao angrily glared at Xiang Liu but with her cheeks still streaked with tears this glare was totally weak.Xiang Liu sat down beside her and laughed \u201cLooks like the rumors are true, you really are the dear daughter of the Great General Qi Yo.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Xiao Yao lowered her head to ignore him.\u201cSuddenly changing a dad, and into one that is reviled by the entire world, that would indeed be hard to accept.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cYou might not know anything about Qi Yo but you know your mom. Since she chose him, you ought to trust her taste!\u201d\u201cI said to shut up!\u201d\u201cNo matter what, you know who your parents are and that\u2019s better off than me! I\u2019m a demon that came out of an egg, I have zero clue who my parents are.\u201dXiao Yao raised her head to look at Xiang Liu trying to ascertain whether he was telling the truth. Xiang Liu earnestly said \u201cYou know I have nine heads and at most I eat more than others. Since I was small I scrounged around for food and my days were absolutely the pits. I\u2019d get beaten and chased and almost killed. My nine heads would sometimes fight with each other. One time I was so hungry one head almost ate another head\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes widened into saucers \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d Xiao Yao was so exasperated she almost expired on the spot.Xiang Liu kept on talking earnestly \u201cI remember someone said to me once \u201cpeople are so weird, whether lucky or unlucky, happy or unhappy, it\u2019s all based on comparing with others.\u201d I\u2019m just telling you about my even more horrible past so that you can see your life is pretty good in comparison!\u201dXiao Yao remembered that the person was her and she grumbled \u201cI didn\u2019t make stuff up though!\u201d\u201cComing out of an egg was true, having nine heads is true, the rest\u2026..\u201d Xiang Liu rapped himself on the head and muttered \u201cI was making it up so well\u2026what else did I say?\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know if she ought to cry to laugh but the pain in her heart really had lessened a lot.Xiang Liu asked \u201cDo you want me to tell you more about my pitiful past so that you can feel like having a big demon devil for a dad isn\u2019t that big of a deal?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes opened wide and she asked \u201cDid you ever meet Qi Yo?\u201d Maybe because Xiang Liu was also a world renowned demon devil it was easier for her to talk about Qi Yo with him.\u201cNo, when I started to follow my adoptive father, Qi Yo was already dead.\u201d\u201cHow was the relations.h.i.+p between Gong Gong and Qi Yo?\u201d\u201cReally bad back then, almost hated foes. But after Qi Yo died and my adoptive father would pay respects to Zhu Rong, he would always also pay respects to Qi Yo.\u201d Xiang Liu laughed in mockery \u201cYou can\u2019t have expected those guys to have been on good terms back then. If they got along then Sheng Nong would have never been destroyed.\u201dXiao Yao was silent before suddenly asking \u201cXiang Liu, why did you pick Gong Gong? Because he\u2019s your adoptive father?\u201d Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know how she had the guts to ask him this question, probably because Xiang Liu didn\u2019t seem like Xiang Liu tonight!\u201cNot just because he\u2019s my adoptive father, there are also all those soldiers I fought along with and watched them die. We drank together, we went to battle together, we picked up our fallen brethren\u2019s bodies\u2026..\u201d Xiang Liu looked over at the altar \u201cFor hundreds of years, do you know how many of my fellow soldiers I\u2019ve have to personally cremate?\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t imagine but she understood what Xiang Liu felt. Her Fourth Uncle could have survived that day, and he did love Fourth Aunt and Zhuan Xu, but he chose to die alongside his soldiers. In this world there was camaraderie so strong that one would die rather than abandon it.Xiang Liu laughed and pointed at his head \u201cI\u2019ve lost count but they are all here.\u201dXiao Yao buried her head in her lap and grew silent. She felt her heart all jumbled and she didn\u2019t know if it was for Xiang Liu or for herself.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cAs Qi Yo\u2019s daughter, there is no place in the world for me.\u201dXiang Liu lifted Xiao Yao\u2019s head \u201cIf you have nowhere then you can always go out to sea. The ocean is so vast that there will be a place for you.\u201dXiao Yao remembered that she had the ability of a sea demon now and the endless ocean might be a nightmare for others but was paradise for her. If Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing didn\u2019t have a place for her, she could always go to the sea. Having discovered a secret pa.s.sage that no one else knew that could save her life, Xiao Yao suddenly felt a sliver of calm.She stared at Xiang Liu and the man before her was that dissolute wastrel but the moment she was about to become torn again a strand of white hair fell that reminded her exactly who he was. Xiao Yao softly stroked his hair and said \u201cThis place is not safe to stay, pay your respects and hurry off!\u201dBecause she just cried, Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes were extraordinarily clear and bright. Xiang Liu could clearly see himself reflected in her eyes so he covered her eyes with his hand \u201cI\u2019m off!\u201dXiao Yao felt a soft coolness brush over her forehead, a brief touch that immediately vanished. Xiao Yao clasped her forehead in shock and opened her eyes to see the room was already empty before her.Mistaken illusion! It was a mistaken illusion!Xiang Liu vaulted out of of the room and onto the courtyard wall to see that it was dense fog all outside and nowhere he could go.Xiang Liu turned around with a smile to see Jing standing there dressed in blue. He asked with a chuckle \u201cTu Shan clan leader, was it interesting to eavesdrop? I didn\u2019t tell her you were listening in back there so why are you using a mystical fog to make it difficult for me?\u201dJing calmly said \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to run into Zhuan Xu\u2019s personal guards, head North because I left a path open there.\u201d\u201cLooks like I misunderstood clan leader\u2019s intentions, thank you!\u201d Xiang Liu fixed his hat and changed his face before vaulting North.Jing said \u201cThank you.\u201dXiang Liu abruptly stopped in his tracks and turned back \u201cWhat is the Tu Shan clan leader\u2019s thanks for? I ought to listen carefully in case I miss something of value in the future.\u201dJing smiled \u201cThank you for comforting her. I\u2019ll definitely offer something of value but the question is whether you\u2019ll want it?\u201dXiang Liu said in half serious half joking tone \u201cOf course I want it, but \u2014\u2014\u2014 not from you!\u201dJing\u2019s expression changed while Xiang Liu laughed out loud and disappeared into the fog.In the cold dark room, Xiao Yao sat there in a daze.A person walked in from outside and as he walked, all the lamps lit up in the room like he was bringing light to Xiao Yao. She was surprised and called out \u201cJing!\u201dJing placed a fox fur cape on Xiao Yao which was when she realized she was actually cold and she pulled the cape around her tightly.Jing lit the three remaining incense sticks and said \u201cLet\u2019s pay our respects together to Uncle Li Jie!\u201dXiao Yao and Jing bowed together.After paying their respects Jing said \u201cThere are many things we can decide but we can\u2019t decide on our parents. Don\u2019t torment yourself for something you can\u2019t decide.\u201dBefore Xiao Yao could respond, Xiao Xiao walked in with a bow \u201cPrincess, it\u2019s very late so let your servant I escort you back to Xiao Yue Summit so the two Majesties don\u2019t start worrying.\u201dXiao Yao looked at Jing who said gently \u201cI\u2019ll come see you tomorrow.\u201dXiao Yao forced a smile \u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Xiao Yao returned to Xiao Yue Summit, she saw the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu sitting by her lamplight.The Yellow Emperor let out of sigh of relief to see Xiao Yao and his exhaustion showed on his face. He took his servants arm \u201cI\u2019m going to rest.\u201dZhuan Xu walked up to Xiao Yao and saw her face red with the cold and placed his hand on her shoulder to use his power to warm her. After her body was warm, Zhuan Xu took off her cloak and hat.Miao Pu rushed in with a steaming bowl of soup \u201cPrincess, please use\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao overturned the bowl and she was always easygoing and never got angry so Miao Pu immediately kneeled down \u201cYour servant deserves death!\u201dXiao Yao wearily said \u201cNot you but me! Never call me Princess from now on!\u201dMiao Pu was so frightened she could only nod her head while Zhuan Xu sent her out and she quickly scurried out.Zhuan Xu dragged Xiao Yao to the pallet and sat her down \u201cPrincess, after being out all night, sit down and rest.\u201dXiao Yao glared at Zhuan Xu and wanted to shake his hand off but he refused to let go and smiled back at her.Xiao Yao was furious \u201cYou know I\u2019m not\u2026..you still\u2026\u2026are you trying to gang up with everyone else on me!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cHow are you not? I can announce tomorrow to the entire world that you are the Xuan Yuan Princess. If you want to be a regional king that is fine as well. Pick any region under my control and I\u2019ll a.s.sign it to you.\u201dXiao Yao was exasperated \u201cStop making more problems for me! I\u2019m so frustrated right now!\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cDo you really care that you\u2019re not a Princess anymore?\u201d\u201cYou know I don\u2019t care about that at all\u2026..aish I\u2019m so tired!\u201d Xiao Yao felt her body and soul was tired and she laid her head on Zhuan Xu\u2019s shoulder without moving for the longest time like she was sleeping. Zhuan Xu also didn\u2019t move and let her rest on him.After a long time Xiao Yao\u2019s low voice spoke \u201cDo you still hate your mom? You own it all now and no one can ever be mean to you. Do you hate her less than when you were small?\u201d\u201cI still dream about her committing suicide in front of me. No matter how much power I have, I still can\u2019t stop her from plunging the dagger into her chest, I still can only watch the blood soak her gown, I still can do nothing when she jumped into my dad\u2019s grave.\u201dXiao Yao yelled \u201cI hate her!\u201d but the her she was referring to wasn\u2019t Zhuan Xu\u2019s mom but her own mom.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t know how to unknot Xiao Yao\u2019s anger because he couldn\u2019t do it for himself. They were the people closest and dearest to them and neither Xiao Yao nor he wanted to hate them. They wanted to forgive them but who could give them a reason to do so?Xiao Yao said \u201cI was small then but I still remember every time my mom met Qi Yo. I think\u2026.I\u2019ve always known the truth deep down. That\u2019s why I was willing to wander the world rather than return to Five G.o.ds Mountain. Hearing what Li Yuan said tonight, it made me sad but also like a heavy burden was lifted and I feel a sense of relief. I don\u2019t need to hide it anymore. Even though I\u2019m loath to give up my Emperor dad\u2019s love, but I don\u2019t want to keep lying to him anymore!\u201dZhuan Xu lightly stroked Xiao Yao\u2019s back \u201cXiao Yao, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201dXiao Yao smiled bitterly \u201cI always wondered why put the Face Forming Flower in my body to turn me faceless and now I know it had to be my mom! She wanted to conceal my true face. It\u2019s so ridiculous! Since I was born everything was a lie. The two of them died so dramatically, one reviled by all and one idolized by all, and all they left me are lies! Gege, do you think they thought about me before they died together? Do you think they were even a little bit loath to leave me behind?\u201d\u201cXiao Yao, I can\u2019t answer for them but I know that I can never bear to leave you.\u201dXiao Yao softly said \u201cI know.\u201dThe two of them leaned against each other like they did when they were kids. Back then Xiao Yao was Zhuan Xu\u2019s support so he knew she was always there for him when his parents were gone, but now it was Zhuan Xu as Xiao Yao\u2019s support so that she knew even if the entire world reviled her he would still be by her side.In the middle of the Spring month, the Grand Emperor proclaimed to the world that Gao Xing Jiu Yao would be stricken from the Gao Xing family ledger. The entire world was stunned.Even though the rumor was spread far and wide, it was still a matter that happened hundreds of years ago. Other than the Xuan Yuan Princess coming back to life to tell the truth, there was no way to confirm it either way. What the Grand Emperor did appeared to be punis.h.i.+ng Xiao Yao, but in truth he was taking all the shame of being cuckholded on himself.Since Xiao Yao was born she had one of the most ill.u.s.trious and powerful last names in the vast wilderness: Gao Xing. Even when she was wandering the world and had no face, she knew she was Gao Xing Jiu Yao. But in an instant she lost her last name and became someone as low as a slave who had no last name.Xiao Yao took out the letters her dad wrote to her during the rumor period and smiled bitterly at how he changed in a few months from not believing the rumors to believing it and taking everything away from her. No! She can\u2019t call him dad anymore! He had no relations.h.i.+p to her anymore, she needed to call him Your majesty.Xiao Yao handed the letters to Jing \u201cDestroy these for me!\u201dJing didn\u2019t do that and instead put it in his sleeve.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t care and said \u201cThis is fine, I wanted to take you to Five G.o.ds Mountain but now you don\u2019t need to win over that Emperor and don\u2019t need to worry about the officials and citizens objecting.\u201dShan Hu quietly came in with tea before leaving silently. Xiao Yao sipped her tea and sighed while Jing asked \u201cAre you worried about Shan Hu?\u201d\u201cI want to send her back but she\u2019s served me for tens of years and everyone knows she\u2019s my maid. The Gao Xing people see me as a shame to them and after she goes back her days will be tough. I want to keep her but I can\u2019t find a good reason.\u201dJing said \u201cIf she was an orphan then it would be fine but she has siblings in Gao Xing so keeping her in Xuan Yuan wasn\u2019t good for her family.\u201dXiao Yao was surprised Jing already dug up such detailed background on Shan Hu \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d\u201cTu Shan clan has many businesses in Gao Xing and some cater specifically to women and need a female proprietor. Shan Hu worked in the palace for many years and knows her jewelry and would be suitable to work at a jewelry store. Working for the Tu Shan clan, most people wouldn\u2019t dare be difficult with her. I\u2019ll tell Ru So as well and he\u2019ll keep an eye on taking care of her.\u201d\u201cThat sounds like a plan.\u201dXiao Yao called Shan Hu in and told her about the idea. Shan Hu heard the store was close to where her parents live and burst into tears. It was also difficult for her during this period and she didn\u2019t know what to do either. Having Xiao Yao and Jing understand and take care of her made her eternally grateful to them.Shan Hu agreed to the plan and Xiao Yao her off to pack so she could leave the mountain with Jing later.Xiao Yao grabbed Jing\u2019s hand when they were alone and said \u201cYou keep helping me like this, I\u2019ll grow lazy.\u201dJing laughed \u201cYou were going to make me some pills for external wounds for You and them to use. Is it done yet?\u201d\u201cAi ya! I totally forgot!\u201dJing said \u201cDo you have time to make it now? I can help you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ve been sequestered here by my grandfather and Zhuan Xu, the only thing I have plenty of is time.\u201dShe rushed out to gather her things and her furrowed brow relaxed which was when Jing also inwardly let out a sigh of relief.When Zhuan Xu arrived at Xiao Yue Summit, he saw Xiao Yao and Jing making pills together.Zhuan Xu greeted them with a smile before going to see the Yellow Emperor. Soon the sound of arguing reached them and Xiao Yao was stunned as she whispered to Jing \u201cThis is the first time ever!\u201dXiao Yao listened in and the argument was over her. The Yellow Emperor wanted to give her the Xuan Yuan last name to make her officially the Xuan Yuan Princess and have the most powerful last name in the world. But Zhuan Xu wanted to give her the Xi Ling last name because the world would know she was the Xuan Yuan family blood anyways. The Xuan Yuan people would not dare touch Xiao Yao since she was the bloodline of the Yellow Emperor and Empress Lei Zhu. But the Middle Plains folks didn\u2019t necessary fear and idolize the Xuan Yuan last name as much whereas the Xi Ling clan was one of the Four Great Clans and had greater influence over the Middle Plains. Only with the Xi Ling last name could Xiao Yao be safe from the ire of the Middle Plains.The pair of grandfather-grandson was actually getting into a raging argument over whether she should be called Xuan Yuan Jiu Yao or Xi Ling Jiu Yao and finally Xiao Yao had enough and ran to their room \u201cDid you guys ask me what I want?\u201dBoth looked over at Xiao Yao and realized they hadn\u2019t asked her opinion yet. Zhaun Xu said \u201cGrandfather, I can\u2019t convince you so let Xiao Yao decide.\u201dXiao Yao was about to talk when the Yellow Emperor warmly asked \u201cAren\u2019t you going to discuss this with Jing first?\u201dZhuan Xu immediately piped up \u201cGrandfather, what does Jing have to do with this?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor chuckled like a sly fox and stared at Zhuan Xu \u201cWhat do you think he has to do with this?\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s eyes flashed a bit of embarra.s.sed guilt as he grumbled like a kid \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a grandfather like you who won\u2019t help your own grandson! Are you still my grandfather or not?\u201dSeeing they were about to argue again, Xiao Yao quickly spoke up \u201cWhen did I ever say I wanted a last name? Can\u2019t I just have a first name and no last name?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu spoke in unison \u201cNO!\u201d Their tone of voice was firm, the authority of Emperors making a stand.Xiao Yao burst out laughing and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cSee, Grandfather is still helping you!\u201dXiao Yao thought about it, with no intention of asking Jing\u2019s opinion. Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor were her family and she could upset them all she wanted but to Jing they were Emperors and she didn\u2019t want to risk him getting on one of their bad sides.Xiao Yao said after much thought \u201cI pick the Xi Ling last name.\u201d The Xi Ling and Tu Shan clans were exactly the same level with each other, the Xuan Yuan last name was too ill.u.s.trious and came with too much baggage.A few days later, the Xi Ling clan leader announced to the world that Xiao Yao would be added to their clan ledger and she officially became the eldest daughter of the Xi Ling clan.The Xuan Yuan Emperor congratulated the Xi Ling clan by showering them with priceless treasures and also gifted the Jang Yi Pavilion on Xiao Yue Summit to Xiao Yao. Jang Yi Pavilion was the residence of the former Flame Emperor\u2019s daughter Princess Yao Ji and was famed for producing beautiful jade. The name Jang Yi also meant hiding beautiful jade so it was hinting to the world that Xiao Yao was as precious as a princess.After the Black Emperor ascended the throne, the Yellow Emperor never once made a proclamation before. But this gift to Xiao Yao had the seal of both Emperors on the proclamation papers which was the first ever in history to have two emperor seals on the same doc.u.ment.The Royal Mother gifted forty eight bottles of priceless saturn peach wine and bone essence to Xi Ling Jiu Yao. The Royal Mother was always aloof and even when the Black Emperor got married she only send half of that which signaled to the world that her disciple Xiao Yao was of utmost importance to her.After Xiao Yao was stripped of her Gao Xing Eldest Princess ident.i.ty, everyone thought it was time to get rid of her. But it was unbelievable that the Yellow and Black Emperors didn\u2019t care that she was Qi Yo\u2019s daughter and widely announced to the world how much they treasured her.To the Xuan Yuan elders, the Xi Ling last name reminded her that even if they hated Qi Yo, Xiao Yao was still the bloodline of Empress Lei Zhu and Princess who died to protect them. General Ying Long and Li Yuan led the brigade to treat Xiao Yao as if she was the Xuan Yuan Princess and didn\u2019t care about anything else. Plus with the two Emperors att.i.tude in protecting Xiao Yao, the rest of the elders decided that they couldn\u2019t transfer their hatred of Qi Yo to Xiao Yao no matter what.Xiao Yao took Jing to tour Jang Yi Pavilion which was covered in beautiful flowers from the days that the flower loving Princess Yao Ji lived there. It actually resembled Qi Qing Garden in Cheng En Palace back on Five G.o.ds Mountain.Xiao Yao walked to the edge of the lake and picked up water in her hands \u201cMy dad told me before that he wasn\u2019t like any other dad and all he could give me was his powerful protection. But in the end he took it back. I ought to call him Your majesty but I keep forgetting.\u201dJing took Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cThe water in your hands will always slip through so it appears you don\u2019t have any but you can\u2019t deny having held it once.\u201d Xiao Yao said nothing and Jing wiped her hands dry. \u201cThe Grand Emperor was once your dad and loved you dearly, that all existed and is undeniable.\u201dXiao Yao felt her eyes mist up \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dJing pulled Xiao Yao to sit down on the gra.s.s \u201cThis rumor came fast and furious to expose your birth secret. But under the two Emperor\u2019s arrangement, you went from the Gao Xing Eldest Princess to Miss Xi Ling. But it\u2019s not over because they can\u2019t stop people from deriding you and insulting you and ostracizing you. You need to learn to deal with people\u2019s animosity as Miss Xi Ling and even if no one would dare openly hurt you, there are still those who would secretly try to a.s.sa.s.sinate you. You also need to live bravely as Qi Yo\u2019s daughter. Xiao Yao, running away won\u2019t solve anything and you need to face this all directly!\u201dXiao Yao stared at Jing before pinching his cheek \u201cYou, when we first met what was your name? Who named you?\u201dJing smiled \u201cYe s.h.i.+ Qi, you named me.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cYou really are Jing! Maybe because you\u2019re clan leader now but how come you sounded just like Zhuan Xu!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always been like this but\u2026..\u201d Jing smiled at Xiao Yao and didn\u2019t say more.\u201cBut what?\u201cBut I merely got clouded by love for a certain Wen Xiao Liu.\u201dXiao Yao laughed and smacked Jing who tried to avoid her and the two of them rolled around on the gra.s.s until Jing raised his hands \u201cSurrender! I surrender!\u201dXiao Yao stretched out her arms and laid down on the gra.s.s to look at the blue skies \u201cActually I\u2019ve known for a long time how sly you are! Just excelling at the arts isn\u2019t enough for Feng long and Li Jie Chang and those guys to go with whatever you say. It\u2019s merely that you\u2019ve never shown your strong willed side in front of me and I often forget that you can be just like them.\u201dJing sat down next to Xiao Yao and looked down at her \u201cXiao Yao, no matter if you meet wild beasts or a cliff in the future, you know that I will walk with you the rest of the way.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cDo you know why I picked the Xi Ling last name?\u201dJing smiled back \u201cI know.\u201dXiao Yao raised her hand and Jing clasped it, the two of them sitting in silence to let the warm sunlight envelope them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslating this chapter of Lost You Forever took forever because it\u2019s basically three chapters in length, not to mention the tears and snot that poured forth which required me to take numerous breaks in order to calm myself down. This is by far the most touching and devastatingly sad chapter of LYF but it\u2019s not sad for Xiao Yao or any of the three men in her life. This chapter is a look into the past, the past of Once Promised that chronicled the story of Xiao Yao\u2019s parents. Her mother the Xuan Yuan Princess and her father the Sheng Nong Great General, theirs was a Romeo and Juliet star-crossed love story that is heartbreaking and unforgettable. It was through their love and sacrifice that Xiao Yao is alive and sharing her story with us, so it\u2019s only fitting that Xiao Yao finally learns the real truth behind all the rumors and terrible reputation that has dogged her daddy his entire life. Her mom couldn\u2019t have fallen in love with a ruthless b.a.s.t.a.r.d so why was Qi Yo persona non grata in the entire vast wilderness? What exactly happened hundreds of years ago that decimated Xiao Yao\u2019s loved ones but brought about the peace of the current Sheng Nong-Xuan Yuan unified under one kingdom prosperity?I don\u2019t blame Xiao Yao for being angry and petulant in the way she thinks about her parents and the legacy they left her, but sometimes the best people suffer to make the world better. Qi Yo was willing to play the part of the villain and do the dirty work that needed to be done to rid Sheng Nong of its rotting status quo but he did it before he knew that one day he would leave behind a daughter that would suffer for being related to him. It\u2019s easy to be a martyr, harder to let your loved ones suffer with the aftermath the martyrdom. After this chapter I\u2019ve translated the most critical portions of the last two chapters of Once Promised. It helps to paint a complete picture for the viewers who didn\u2019t read OP. I wish I had the time and fort.i.tude to translate OP as well since the love story between Xiao Yao\u2019s parents is actually much more satisfying to read mostly because that novel didn\u2019t have a real love triangle. Here there is basically a love quadrangle so the romance gets split four ways and the readers are left with each of Xiao Yao\u2019s guys being awesome in their own way but lacking something different each. Xiao Yao\u2019s mom got lucky in her man having all the strengths and flaws combined together into one pa.s.sionate devoted man who loved only her.Chapter 36 \u2013 Flowers Bloom Flowers Wilt, Farewell to a Loved One:Towards the end of Spring, Fang Feng Yi Yang fell ill and her father the Fang Feng family head rushed to Qing Qiu to see her. Two days later the Tu Shan clan leader and the Fang Feng family head together announced that the Madam had pa.s.sed away.All the clans and families in the vast wilderness sent their condolences but there were few that truly mourned Fang Feng Yi Yang. Almost all cared only about who would be the future Tu Shan clan leader wife. The Middle Plains custom was to wait a year after the death of a wife to remarry but anxious clan leaders were already sending inquiries to the Tu Shan clan leader to try and ascertain the type of woman he liked.After the funeral Jing left Qing Qiu and continued to reside in Zhi Yi Castle.With the Yellow Emperor\u2019s permission, Jing came to Xiao Yue Summit daily not to spend time with Xiao Yao but to accede to the Yellow Emperor\u2019s wishes and play Go with him. Using a specially created G.o.dly Go board, the board represented the entire world and the battle was far reaching. One match often lasted for months.Xiao Yao would hang around them and read her medical texts or nap.One evening a match finally concluded.The Yellow Emperor stared at the board and sighed \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that your objective in life isn\u2019t on this; it\u2019s a relief that your objective in life isn\u2019t on this!\u201dXiao Yao brought over plum soup and peered at the match but understood nothing \u201cWho won?\u201dJing smiled \u201cOf course I lost.\u201dXiao Yao smiled sweetly and handed the bowls of soup over.The Yellow Emperor grumbled \u201cThe Middle Plains customs are the worst. What\u2019s the point of mourning? If the heart misses the deceased then a person will mourn forever, if the heart has moved on then it doesn\u2019t matter how long customary mourning lasts. Us Northwestern tribes view such matters clearer, for a widow or widower, one can have a funeral in the morning and a wedding ceremony in the afternoon. Many tribes go to funerals and then weddings on the same day.\u201dXiao Yao spit out her plum soup with a laugh \u201cGrandfather, you\u2019re regressing in how you talk! They say older folks become kids as they age and now I actually believe it!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor shook his head at Xiao Yao \u201cYou! I\u2019m worried for your sake!\u201dXiao Yao blushed and muttered \u201cI\u2019m in no rush to get married!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not in a rush but someone else is. Otherwise why would he quickly arrange a funeral when Fang Feng Yi Yang is clearly still alive.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Jing \u201cHe pities Fang Feng Yi Yang and thought of this plan for her to die publicly so she doesn\u2019t have to be sacrificed to the G.o.ds anymore and can live to watch her son grow up.\u201dJing candidly admitted \u201cHelping Fang Feng Yi Yang was secondary, my main purpose was to marry Xiao Yao sooner.\u201dXiao Yao wanted to glare at Jing but when she met his eyes her heart started to race. She was angry but also touched and she lowered her head to focus on drinking her plum soup but her cheeks remained brightly flushed.Jing said to the Yellow Emperor \u201cYour majesty, I have a matter to beg your allowance.\u201d\u201cSpeak!\u201d\u201cI want to take Xiao Yao out to travel.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said nothing and Jing added \u201cI know Your majesty is worried about her safety but she can\u2019t hide here forever. These past few months Xiao Yao has picked up her archery again and is making poisons as well, she has the ability to protect herself.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cI know that raising baby eagles requires setting them free when they are grown but now that I\u2019m older I still worry.\u201d\u201cIf Your majesty is worried then you can send secret guards to protect us.\u201dXiao Yao grumbled \u201cGrandfather, don\u2019t forget that I wandered the world alone for hundreds of years, I raised myself!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor decided \u201cXiao Yao does need to go out to clear her mind, you guys go!\u201dJing bowed \u201cThank Your majesty!\u201dZhuan Xu heard Xiao Yao was traveling with Jing and didn\u2019t agree but the Yellow Emperor already agreed so he relented after Xiao Yao begged him. His only requirement was that she was to take Xiao Xiao and Miao Pu along.In the Summer Jing set off with Xiao Yao and Jing Ye, Hu Zhen, Hu Ya, Xiao Xiao, and Miao Pu. They traveled until they reached Chi Sui where they boarded a s.h.i.+p and headed into Gao Xing territory.Xiao Yao was perplexed and asked Jing \u201cAre you going to do business or have something else in mind?\u201dJing smiled \u201cBusiness of course but I do have other plans.\u201d\u201cWhat other plans?\u201d\u201cOne of them is to tour the scenic vistas.\u201dXiao Yao walked to the s.h.i.+p bow and stared at the familiar scenery \u201cThere are so many beautiful vistas in the world, why bring me to Gao Xing? Don\u2019t you know the Emperor and citizens here don\u2019t welcome me?\u201dJing handed a jug of plum wine to Xiao Yao and embraced her waist \u201cThe year of the Chi Sui Autumn Tournament, when you left I really wanted to send you off. I arrived at the port but could only stay in the carriage and have a servant send the snacks to you. I wanted to see you but only saw Zhuan Xu, Ah Nian, Feng Long, and Xing Yue talking on the s.h.i.+p. Until the s.h.i.+p disappeared from view I still didn\u2019t see you. I knew you were about to reclaim your princess ident.i.ty and we might not be fated to be together so my heart hurt. I kept convincing myself that I would travel this route again with you someday and tell you that I came personally to see you off that day\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes misted and she leaned into Jing\u2019s embrace and drank the plum wine while watching the view pa.s.s by.The entire trip Jing really was just sightseeing with no rush and often docking the s.h.i.+p to sh.o.r.e and taking Xiao Yao to explore.Even though Xiao Yao wandered for hundreds of years, it was in the Middle Plains and she never explored Gao Xing. Jing was different, being the clan leader designate since he was young meant he traveled for business all over the vast wilderness. Whether it was the dangerous and scary Jiu Li, the unpredictable ocean, he visited everywhere before. This trip he knew where all the fun things were and the delicious food spots and he planned everything so that Xiao Yao was totally taken care of.Since her mom died, Xiao Yao finally felt like she could be a kid and just enjoy without any worry or planning.That night the two of them camped out on the mountain top.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cLet me show you something!\u201d and then she climbed up a tree like a monkey to rest on the branch.Jing took out a jade container and released spiders who quickly got to work between the branches.Xiao Yao stared \u201cAre you planning to make a web lace?\u201dJing vaulted to Xiao Yao\u2019s side and embraced her, blocking the cold night wind for her \u201cI\u2019ve raised these spiders since I was small, they make light and soft but impervious webs.\u201dXiao Yao stared as the spiders worked feverishly until they made a web hammock between the branches. They returned to Jing who fed them bone essence and they happily retreated back to the jade container.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know how Jing raised them but the spiders produced a sky blue web that glittered in the moonlight. She asked \u201cAre you planning to take it back to make clothes with it?\u201dJing smiled and then grabbed Xiao Yao in his arms to vault down and landed on the web. It was soft like resting on clouds. Xiao Yao marveled at how it even felt warm and laughed \u201cJing, you\u2019re so clever even as a kid, to think of such a method of camping outdoors. Of course only the Tu Shan clan can afford it.\u201dJing smiled wistfully at memories of the past \u201cMy mom and my brother really spoiled me.\u201dXiao Yao laid on the web and stared at the stars above. Since wandering the world as a child, she slept outdoors countless times and it was never something she found fun. It was because she had no home so she had to sleep outside in a dangerous place where she had to always be on guard. But tonight sleeping outside became something different. Xiao Yao said in a low voice \u201cJing, these days I feel like I\u2019m a kid again, and being with you feels like having my mom by my side.\u201dJing coughed a few times and muttered \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel like a compliment.\u201dXiao Yao flipped over and stared at him with a smile \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re like my mom, it\u2019s more\u2026.it feels like when I was small and didn\u2019t need to think or worry about anything. Every day was happy.\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s smile gradually disappeared \u201cIt all feels like a dream and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll wake up from the dream like when I was small.\u201dJing softly kissed her \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream. We\u2019ll walk the rest of our lives together.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYes.\u201dThe wind gently rocked their web hammock and the two laid next to each together staring at the glittering stars s.h.i.+ning down on them.They walked and stopped the whole way until a month later they reached the sea near Gao Xing and by then it was the end of Summer.Xiao Xiao said to Jing \u201cClan leader, if you want to go to the sea to sight-see, why don\u2019t we head North. The East Sea has beautiful scenery and its a good place for my lady to wait for you if you have business to discuss.\u201dJing said \u201cThat works.\u201dJing changed course and headed North to the East Sea. He took Jing Ye and Hu Ya on a boat to Five G.o.ds Mountain to discuss business and afterwards planned to rendezvous with Xiao Yao on the East Sea.Xiao Yao watched Jing\u2019s boat disappear from view before heading back inside the cabin. When Jing\u2019s boat entered Gao Xing borders, Ru So arrived on a large s.h.i.+p to receive him and he boarded the s.h.i.+p.Jing said to Ru So \u201cPlease send word to His majesty that Tu Shan Jing and Xi Ling Jiu Yao ask for a meeting with him. If he\u2019s willing we\u2019ll go up the mountain and if not then we\u2019ll leave.\u201dRu So was stunned and the Jing Ye standing behind Jing stepped forward and took off her spider web spin face mask with a smile \u201cLord Ru So, long time no see. Have you been well these days?\u201dRu So was silent for a bit and then said \u201cI\u2019ll go see His majesty now\u201d and swiftly departed on his winged ride with no regard for pleasantries.Xiao Yao stood beside Jing with her heart hanging in the balance but he patted her hand to a.s.sure her.Ru So returned shortly with smile \u201cHis majesty asks both of you to come up the mountain.\u201dXiao Yao let out a small sigh of relief but got even more nervous as the cloud carriage ascended. It stopped in front of Cheng En Palace and Ru So said \u201cHis majesty is inside.\u201dJing said to Xiao Yao \u201cWait for me here.\u201dXiao Yao nodded.Jing entered the palace court and noticed the Grand Emperor\u2019s eyes staring past him. Jing said with a bow \u201cXiao Yao is outside waiting but I wanted to speak privately with Your majesty first.\u201dThe Grand Emperor had no emotion on his face as he looked at Jing calmly.Jing said \u201cThese recent months I\u2019ve done all I can to search for information about Your majesty and Qi Yo. Whether it was Your majesty or Qi Yo, both are incisively smart and overly cautious and wary people. If Xiao Yao\u2019s mother wanted to fool the world it wasn\u2019t hard. But to fool either or both of you, it would be impossible. Unless someone helped her, that is. My guess is when Xiao Yao was born, Your majesty knew that she was Qi Yo\u2019s daughter. Because there was Your majesty helping to place the Face Forming Flower in Xiao Yao, that is why she resembled you so much when she was small.\u201dThe Grand Emperor still had no expression but he coolly said \u201cYour conclusion is correct, it was Ah Heng and I who sealed the Face Forming Flower in Xiao Yao\u2019s body.\u201dAh Heng must be the name that her close family called the Xuan Yuan Princess. Jing continued \u201cThe world thinks that Your majesty doesn\u2019t know the truth and thus treated Xiao Yao as your daughter. They don\u2019t know that you know the truth and still treated Xiao Yao as your daughter. I can guess that it was the Black Emperor who spread the rumor far and wide, and Your majesty is so smart you probably also figured that out already. I believe I know why he did it, and I think Your majesty does as well.\u201dJing kneeled down and bowed his head to the floor \u201cJing thanks Your majesty for your love and protection of Xiao Yao.\u201d Jing was the Tu Shan clan leader and when he saw the Yellow Emperor or the Grand Emperor he only needed to bow at the waist yet he was giving a full on the floor bow right now to the Grand Emperor.The Grand Emperor was expressionless and motioned for Jing to rise \u201cDid the clan leader come to see me just to say these pointless things?\u201dJing sat down and continued \u201cAfter Xiao Yao learned she was Qi Yo\u2019s daughter, she\u2019s been devastated. Now she appears accepting but it\u2019s just her masking her inner pain. Your majesty knows Xiao Yao\u2019s personality, she doesn\u2019t care whether her dad is an emperor or a demon b.a.s.t.a.r.d, she\u2019s upset because both her mom and her dad abandoned her and left her only lies. She is also sad because of Qi Yo, because all she knows about him was what the entire world thinks of him as a vicious bloodthirsty demon who killed indiscriminately. In this world only Your majesty knows information about Xiao Yao\u2019s parents so I beg of you to tell her about the past.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s right hand unconsciously stroked the white bone ring on his left hand and his eyes stared at a point in the distance beyond Jing. His expressionless expression didn\u2019t change but there was slight confusion in his eyes mixed with desolation. He murmured \u201cDoes Ah Heng really want Xiao Yao to know? I always thought Ah Heng wanted Xiao Yao to live free without a care.\u201d\u201cSince Xiao Yao was born her life has determined that she can\u2019t grow up like Ah Nian. Now that she\u2019s grown up, no matter how painful and cruel the truth is, please tell Xiao Yao everything because only the truth can open her heart so that one day she can live carefree.\u201dThe Grand Emperor murmured \u201cShe\u2019s grown up?\u201d When Ah Heng gave birth to Xiao Yao in a dangerous delivery, Ah Heng was in a coma for over a year and he was the one who slept with baby Xiao Yao and fed her. Ah Heng, why do I feel like Xiao Yao is still a daughter that must be protected at all costs? But she really is all grown up now!Jing wanted to talk but heard the Grand Emperor say out loud \u201cAh Heng, our daughter is all grown up!\u201d Jing realized then that the Grand Emperor wasn\u2019t talking to him.The Grand Emperor said to Jing \u201cYou can leave now!\u201dJing tried to ask \u201cShall I bring Xiao Yao to see Your majesty?\u201dThe Grand Emperor waved his hand \u201cYou guys head down the mountain and the boat will take you to Chi Sui.\u201d After that he walked out of the chambers.Xiao Yao saw Jing come out and rushed over \u201cDa\u2026..His majesty discussed business with you? How come it took so long? He\u2026.shall I go inside now?\u201dJing said apologetically \u201cHis majesty told us to head down the mountain and a boat will take us to Chi Sui.\u201dXiao Yao was heartbroken but put on an indifferent look \u201cI told you already that no one on this land welcomes me. Forget it, no need to meet, let\u2019s go!\u201dAfter taking the cloud carriage down, Xiao Yao saw a Gao Xing s.h.i.+p on the waters and Ru So formed a water bridge for Xiao Yao and Jing to board. Xiao Yao rushed on as if she couldn\u2019t wait to leave while Jing pondered as he walked and wasn\u2019t clear what he said wrong. How come the Grand Emperor changed his mind and actually kicked him and Xiao Yao off the mountain?After they boarded the s.h.i.+p immediately set sail towards the Northwest.Xiao Yao said to Ru So \u201cWe can go alone just take us out of Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dRu So answered \u201cHis majesty\u2019s orders was to take you to Chi Sui.\u201dXiao Yao was furious \u201cJing!\u201dJing pulled Xiao Yao aside and asked \u201cDo you still want to go to the East Sea to play?\u201d Xiao Yao shook her head. Jing said \u201cThen catch a ride on their s.h.i.+p, with a G.o.d at the helm this s.h.i.+p is immensely fast and we\u2019ll arrive in three to four days.\u201dXiao Yao groused \u201cI just feel like they can\u2019t even bear for me to be in Gao Xing for one extra second and is rus.h.i.+ng to personally escort me to Chi Sui.\u201dJing was silent and then pointed skyward \u201cLook!\u201dXiao Yao looked to where he was pointing and saw the ocean with Five G.o.ds Mountain in the background in the fog and this beautiful view was likely her last time seeing it so she silently took it all in.Four days later the s.h.i.+p entered Chi Sui waters and Xiao Yao thought the s.h.i.+p would pull to sh.o.r.e to let them off but Ru So didn\u2019t slow down the s.h.i.+p or appear to have any intention of docking it.The s.h.i.+p sped towards Chi Sui Castle and years ago it was also Ru So who delivered her in the wedding party there. Xiao Yao leaned against the railing and asked \u201cRu So, are you still upset I ran away from my wedding? Do you want to personally deliver me to the Chi Sui residence so they can punish me? Right now everyone hates me so the Chi Sui clan is actually happy and grateful now that I ran away from the wedding and spared them having me in their family.\u201dRu So was chatting with Jing and acted like he didn\u2019t hear Xiao Yao and it was Jing who grinned at her.Xiao Yao looked out over the railing where the view was lush green fields and forests when suddenly the view turned completely barren. Xiao Yao remembered seeing this barren area years ago when she came to the Autumn Tournament with Zhuan Xu and she asked Ru So and Jing \u201cDo you guys know why this area is a barren desert?\u201dJing said \u201cRumor has it a monster lives inside.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes suddenly bulged forward and Jing followed her and saw the Grand Emperor standing on the s.h.i.+p looking towards the barren wasteland. He was wearing a simple white robe with none of the emperor trappings and looked like a warrior wandering the world.Jing bowed \u201cYour majesty.\u201dThe Grand Emperor walked to Xiao Yao and grabbed her hand and flew up in the air with her towards the barren land on sh.o.r.e. Jing hurried to join them.After the three of them reached sh.o.r.e, Jing looked back and saw the s.h.i.+p speeding off as if nothing happened, still heading forward with people on the dock busy preparing to unload wares once the port was reached.Xiao Yao tried to pull her hand back but the Grand Emperor didn\u2019t let go. Xiao Yao grumbled \u201cYou don\u2019t consider me your daughter anymore, why hold onto me?\u201dThe Grand Emperor pulled Xiao Yao behind him into the barren land and Xiao Yao had no choice but to go with him.In the beginning there were some cactus growing on the ground but as they headed deeper inside gradually there was nothing living around. Xiao Yao tossed her handkerchief into the air and it instantly burned up. Xiao Yao stared in shock and realized why the Grand Emperor held her hand, if it wasn\u2019t for his spiritual power s.h.i.+elding her, she would have been burned already.Xiao Yao asked \u201cDad, where are we going?\u201d After she said that she realized she couldn\u2019t call him dad anymore but it was too late to take it back so she grew silent.The Grand Emperor turned to look at Xiao Yao warmly but didn\u2019t answer her question. He said instead \u201cI was born the Eldest Prince of Gao Xing and my mother was my father\u2019s first wife and empress. Reportedly they were very much in love but she died giving birth to me. Soon afterwards a pair of sisters from the Chang Yi tribe entered the Palace and my father had new loves. Since I was small there would be constant accidents befalling me in the Palace. A few times I almost died. Later my uncle helped me leave Five G.o.ds Mountain and I wandered the vast wilderness. I settled down in a little town and opened a blacksmith shop. One day your Eldest Uncle came to ask me to fix his sword. We didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s real ident.i.ty as the Eldest Prince of Gao Xing and the Eldest Prince of Xuan Yuan and we became best friends.\u201dXiao Yao listened raptly.\u201cYour mom was the only Princess of the Xuan Yuan Kingdom and is about a thousand years younger than me. When your mom was just born your Eldest Uncle jokingly said to me \u201cYou can become my brother-in-law!\u201d Years later because of the Grand Empress and my many half-brothers, I almost died again. Your Eldest Uncle came to me after that attempt on my life and official proposed an engagement between your mom and me. He explained that I can use the alliance with the Xuan Yuan Princess to keep myself alive while he can use my Gao Xing Eldest Prince status to help keep his mom and younger brothers safe. I agreed with his proposal but rather than saying your mom and I got engaged it was really two princes in peril, myself and Prince Qing Yang, announcing to the world an alliance for our own protection. At that time your mom just learned to walk and couldn\u2019t even talk yet and honestly I never imagined I would ever marry her so I never saw the engagement as real\u2026..\u201dIn the Grand Emperor\u2019s recollection, the past appeared before Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes, all those past happiness and sorrows: Eldest Uncle Qing Yang, Second Uncle Yun Zhe, Fourth Uncle Chang Yi, her Grandmother Lei Zhu, and her playful mischievous mom\u2026..It wasn\u2019t clear how much time pa.s.sed but Xiao Yao smelled something burning and she looked over to see the Grand Emperor\u2019s white robe had turned charred yellow and his lips were chapped like he hadn\u2019t drank water for days. She hurriedly yelled \u201cDad!\u201d She looked to Jing for help and saw his face bright red and he walked slowly like he was stepping on scalding lava.Xiao Yao forgot about listening to the story and screamed \u201cDad! Stop going! If we keep going we\u2019ll all die.\u201dThe Grand Emperor looked back at Jing \u201cCan you keep going?\u201dJing forced a smile but couldn\u2019t talk so nodded. A little white astral fox appeared and perched on Jing\u2019s shoulder and he looked less pained.The Grand Emperor continued while Xiao Yao was horrified \u201cDad, it\u2019ll only get hotter as we go deeper inside.\u201dThe Grand Emperor appeared not to hear her and held her hand tightly and continued to tell Xiao Yao his story with Ah Heng while pulling her swiftly behind him.It was unending desert before them and because it was so hot even the blue sky was gone and instead turned all red giving the world around them the feel of eerie desolation.The fox on Jing\u2019s shoulder got smaller and smaller until it vanished and Jing spit up blood and his leg caught on fire. The Grand Emperor grabbed Jing and the fire was extinguished.The Grand Emperor grabbed Xiao Yao on one hand and Jing on the other and continued forward. Xiao Yao saw his robe burn up while his arm was like a dried desert cracking open until blood seeped out and stained his robe.Xiao Yao cried \u201cDad, you\u2019re the head of a kingdom, how can you leave your citizens behind and die here?\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s step halted for a moment before he continued to rush forward. Xiao Yao saw his hand was shriveled and blackened with only bone and no flesh or blood left and she screamed \u201cDad, Dad, please stop, I beg you please stop\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Grand Emperor kept going and Xiao Yao raged \u201cYou\u2019re not even my dad and I\u2019ve no connection with you so you let me go, you have no right to hold me, let me go\u2026..\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s steps were slow and his powers could barely sustain him but he held on tightly to Xiao Yao and Jing and kept going forward. His expression was no longer his usual calm expressionless visage and instead looked stricken and anxious like he was looking for a long lost beloved treasure.At this point they couldn\u2019t make it back out alive anymore so Xiao Yao gave up struggling and followed behind the Grand Emperor but having no clue what he could be looking for.After some time the Grand Emperor finally collapsed on the ground and pulled Xiao Yao and Jing down with him. Jing regained some of his power and held onto Xiao Yao to keep her from being burned but the Grand Emperor\u2019s leg was badly burned and was almost just a skeletal bone.Xiao Yao took out her precious medicine but the moment it left the jar the elixir evaporated.Xiao Yao railed at the sky \u201cWhat is this G.o.dforsaken place!\u201dThe Grand Emperor tried to get up but couldn\u2019t and his eyes reflect his utter despair. He looked at the sky \u201cWhy? I just wanted to confirm whether she was really here? Why don\u2019t you let me know if she\u2019s really dead or alive?\u201dJing suddenly yelled \u201cYour majesty! Look! Look!\u201d as he pointed to the left.Under the red sky there was a perfect pristine peach blossom forest that was ethereal like a fairy realm and untouched by the heat.Xiao Yao rubbed her eyes in disbelief that a peach blossom forest could be intact in the middle of a raging inferno wasteland. The Grand Emperor\u2019s desolate expression regained a sliver of hope and he stood up with Jing\u2019s help and the three of them rushed forward together towards the peach blossom forest.When they entered the peach blossom forest both Jing and the Grand Emperor collapsed on the ground nearly dead but the low power Xiao Yao appeared completely fine standing there with only her hair and clothes a little bit singed.Jing still felt it was burning hot but because this peach blossom forest had the water and wood powers so he could summon the wood powers to help him create a water maze to keep the heat out unlike in the desert where there was nothing around and he had to only use his own power to withstand the heat.Jing hurriedly conjured up the water maze and was about to pull Xiao Yao inside when he saw her nonchalantly strolling around the peach blossom forest as if on a spring day hike.Jing stared slack jawed, if he didn\u2019t know she had low powers he would have thought she was one of the most powerful G.o.ddesses in the world.Jing asked \u201cXiao Yao, are you not hot?\u201d\u201cHot? No! The moment I entered the peach blossom forest I felt cool like a spring day on Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201d As Xiao Yao spoke the peach blossom petals fell around her like falling snow and enveloped her in an embrace. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but reach out her hand to catch the petals.Was he being strangely affected? Jing glanced over at the Grand Emperor and saw him sitting in a water maze he constructed and it was clear he also felt the burning heat. But he didn\u2019t seem confused about Xiao Yao\u2019s odd reaction and merely silently watched her with joy and sorrow in his eyes.Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou two want to stay here and heal your injuries first? After you heal then we continue on?\u201dJing grimaced. Heal? He was only barely able to stay alive.The Grand Emperor smiled \u201cXiao Yao, we\u2019re not healing, this place isn\u2019t any less hot than in the barren desert.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t feel any of that.\u201d Xiao Yao looked confused \u201cThe peach blossoms here are growing so beautifully, even more beautifully than on Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dThe Grand Emperor stared at the peach blossom forest and said nothing but his eyes was filled with abject sadness.Jing looked around and carefully observed the peach blossom forest which was itself the most powerful spiritual maze in the world. Jing couldn\u2019t help but be utterly impressed with whomever constructed the maze. The strange peach blossoms grew in the barren wasteland to create an oasis of life and helped to seal the monster\u2019s terrifying power. But what was strange was the maze appeared to also be protecting the monster. If Jing headed deeper inside then the peach blossoms would not let him collect its water power and would instead shoot to kill him.\u201dJing tried to test out his theory and walked deeper into the forest and he was right because the water power pulled back as a warning. Jing took a few more steps and the peach blossom forest was infuriated and thousands of peach blossom petals turned into the sharpest blades and flew towards him. Xiao Yao was terrified and flew towards Jing to push him down on the ground.The petals turned back into soft fronds right before it struck Xiao Yao and landed softly on top of her and Jing.Jing suddenly realized the petals only started falling after they entered the peach blossom forest and it wasn\u2019t because he activated the maze but it was falling solely because of Xiao Yao.Jing also realized why Xiao Yao didn\u2019t feel the heat and said to the Grand Emperor \u201cYour majesty, the peach blossom forest is\u2026..protecting Xiao Yao.\u201d Just like in the desert when the Grand Emperor used his spiritual power to protect Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao was perplexed \u201cDad, what is this place?\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cXiao Yao, I think\u2026\u2026your mom is still alive.\u201dXiao Yao stared at him and he repeated \u201cYour mom is still alive.\u201dThe world was as silent as if it ended. Xiao Yao\u2019s heart sank to the depths of the world\u2019s lowest point and she couldn\u2019t breath. She heard the sound of petals falling on her and her own voice sounding like it was from far away \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cYour mom is still alive.\u201dXiao Yao could hear her thundering heart but didn\u2019t know if it was happiness, sadness, or rage? She calmly wondered why she should be angry, shouldn\u2019t she just be happy? But she heard herself scream \u201cI don\u2019t believe it! If she was alive when why didn\u2019t she come back to pick me up? You\u2019re lying! You\u2019re lying!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Grand Emperor sadly stared at her.Xiao Yao believed that her mom was still alive but wished she was really dead so that she had a reason to forgive her.\u201cIf she was alive then why didn\u2019t she pick me up? Why did she abandon me? Does she know how I grew up? I was called a b.a.s.t.a.r.d sp.a.w.n, chased by people, I didn\u2019t have a face, I fought with animals for sc.r.a.ps of food\u2026..I was raised in a locked cage for thirty years no better than an animal! My hard earned powers was forcibly stripped from me and I was forced to eat the most horrific things\u2026..Isn\u2019t she my real mom? When I was being tortured and abused where was she? Did she give birth to me just so I could endure such abuse and torture\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao thought she experienced all that and was cold and heartless enough to withstand it but some pain was merely locked away so now when the sh.e.l.l was forcibly peeled off she could still cry and hurt.Xiao Yao headed out of the peach blossom forest with only one thought \u2013 to leave here immediately and forever!Jing tried to stop her but he couldn\u2019t move easily in the forest while she could.\u201cXiao Yao, stop!\u201d The Grand Emperor blocked her path.Xiao Yao pushed him aside and ran towards the edge of the forest \u201cI hate her, I hate her! From the day she abandoned me I had no mom anymore! I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s dead or alive, it has nothing to do with me! Whether she\u2019s a hero or a wh.o.r.e also has nothing to do with me\u2026\u2026\u201dSLAP! The Grand Emperor\u2019s hard resounding slap landed on Xiao Yao\u2019s cheek.Xiao Yao\u2019s cheek was red and throbbing in pain and she stared incredulously at the Grand Emperor. He never once said an angry word to her and even in the desert he would risk death to s.h.i.+eld her first. But right now he struck her because of a woman who divorced him,Xiao Yao angrily yelled \u201cShe divorced you hundreds of years ago, she doesn\u2019t want you!\u201d\u201cYour mom doesn\u2019t want me but she never abandoned you! If it wasn\u2019t for you then why would she need to survive in this not G.o.d, not human, not demon painful way? Look around here, do you think this is a place for anyone to live?\u201dXiao Yao stared at the Grand Emperor where his two arms were shriveled up and his one leg was as dry as tinder. Even a supremely powerful G.o.d like the Grand Emperor could not last even a day in this place, yet her mom had been in here for hundreds of years.Xiao Yao\u2019s rage evaporated with only her despair burning her up inside. She whirled around and rushed towards the inner part of the peach blossom forest while yelling on the top of her lungs \u201cMom! Mom! Mom\u2026..I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, your Xiao Yao is here\u2026\u2026\u201dThe peach blossom petals blanketed the sky like the misty rain of the South in an unending torrent falling.Xiao Yao kept calling out \u201cMom, Mom, Mom, I\u2019m Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u201dA figure in blue appeared in the midst of the peach blossom petal rain and Xiao Yao stopped in her tracks and stared at the sliver of blue in the sea of red.With the peach blossom petal rain covering the landscape the figure was murky but she walked very hesitantly.Finally she got close to Xiao Yao but with still a distance separating them she stopped and the peach blossom petals fell even more heavily. Her face was covered in the peach blossom petals and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t see her clearly at all.Xiao Yao opened her mouth but her throat was dry and she couldn\u2019t speak so Xiao Yao tried to walk forward but the petals gently but insistently pushed her back so she couldn\u2019t move.The Grand Emperor behind Xiao Yao asked \u201cAh Heng, is that you?\u201dAfter some time a scratchy voice answered, a voice that sounded like her vocal cords had been burned \u201cShao Hao?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d The Grand Emperor\u2019s voice was shaking.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown old.\u201dThe Grand Emperor wanted to laugh but couldn\u2019t \u201cYou\u2026..have you been well?\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dVery calm, very nonchalant, the two of them conversed as if they merely ran into each other on the streets in the misty rain, with the hundreds of years behind them but still two close friends who could candidly ask each other\u2019s well being.The Grand Emperor said \u201cI brought Xiao Yao to see you.\u201dThe figure in blue silently stood there and it wasn\u2019t clear what her expression was but the petals flew around her as if clouds were converging and parting in an ever changing pattern.Xiao Yao pushed aside the thick petals and desperately tried to walk forward but the figure in blue appeared startled and immediately moved back \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t come close!\u201dXiao Yao yelled \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go over? I want to go over, I\u2019m going to go over! Why do you have to hide in the peach blossom petals, make it go away!\u201d\u201cXiao Yao, be obedient!Xiao Yao often heard that when she was a child \u201cXiao Yao, be obedient!\u201d When she was naughty her mom would say that. When she wanted to eat snacks and not eat dinner her mom would say that, when she wouldn\u2019t listen to Zhuan Xu gege her mom would say that\u2026..but back then her mom\u2019s voice was gentle and melodic, not scratchy and rough like now.Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell but she didn\u2019t rebel against her mom like she did as a child and really was obedient and stopped trying to walk closer. But she was still stubborn like a child and asked \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go over?\u201d\u201cI have the power of the sun\u2019s fire inside of me. It can burn up lush green land and endless forests and turn it into an unending desert. If you come too close it will burn you.\u201dXiao Yao was shocked \u201cYou\u2026..you are the drought monster?\u201d\u201cThe world calls me the drought monster? Then I am.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cHave you been living here this entire time?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t come pick me up, not because you didn\u2019t want to, but because you can\u2019t, right?\u201d The truth was right in front of her eyes but Xiao Yao still needed to ask because she was waiting for this answer for her entire life.The blue shadow appeared to understand Xiao Yao\u2019s pain and reached out her hand and walked forward a few steps but immediately pulled back \u201cI have the sun\u2019s fire inside me so wherever I go it will be destroyed so I cannot leave here. I can only wait here for you. I\u2019ve waited four hundred years to tell you in person that Mom is so very sorry to you. Xiao Yao, in my entire life I did not let down my kingdom or my people, but the only two people I let down was your dad and you. Mom is so very sorry to you\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter four hundred years Xiao Yao finally got the answer she needed, the answer she never imagined she would ever get in her entire life.In that moment Xiao Yao released all her anguish and bitterness as her tears fell and she knelt to the ground \u201cMom!\u201dThe blue shadow shook and almost bent low but the peach blossom petals around her surrounded her tightly as if comforting her and sharing in her sorrow.Xiao Yao cried \u201cMom, have you been alone here for the last four hundred years?\u201d\u201cNot alone, your daddy has been with me.\u201dXiao Yao looked back at the Grand Emperor and then realized it wasn\u2019t that dad but\u2026..Xiao Yao quickly asked \u201cQi Yo is also still alive?\u201dAh Heng knew Xiao Yao\u2019s emotional knot over this issue so didn\u2019t get angry with Xiao Yao calling her dad by his name but also didn\u2019t answer her question. She asked \u201cWho is the young man behind you?\u201dXiao Yao turned around and her heart fluttered in nervous sweetness as if she was on a secret date with her boyfriend and her parents caught them.The Grand Emperor answered \u201cHis name is Tu Shan Jing, the Qing Qiu Tu Shan clan\u2019s current clan leader.\u201dJing knelt to the ground to bow his head low \u201cGreetings to the Princess.\u201dAh Heng raised her hand \u201cNo need for such formality, you are the clan leader.\u201dThe Grand Emperor explained \u201cHe wants your most precious thing, of course he\u2019ll be like this.\u201dAh Heng looked at Jing bowing on the ground behind Xiao Yao with no intention of getting up and understood everything. She felt conflicted and couldn\u2019t speak for some time.Jing and Xiao Yao nervously remained kneeling until Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but call out \u201cMom?\u201dAh Heng appeared to snap out of it and asked \u201cIs he good to you?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYes, very good.\u201dAh Heng added \u201cNo one treats you even better? Why does it have to be him?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBecause only him, no matter what happens, he will never leave me.\u201dAh Heng appeared to chuckle before she called \u201cJing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cPlease take care of Xiao Yao.\u201dWas that her stamp of approval for him? Jing immediately bowed three times and joyfully replied \u201cI will definitely do that.\u201dAh Heng asked \u201cWhere is Zhuan Xu? Where is he now?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cZhuan Xu is now the Emperor of Xuan Yuan and lives on Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dAh Heng was silent and then asked \u201cWhen did your Grandfather pa.s.s away?\u201d\u201cGrandfather is still alive.\u201d Xiao Yao vividly explained how the Yellow Emperor dramatically abdicated the throne to Zhuan Xu and then shared how both men were doing now.Ah Heng asked \u201cHas Zhuan Xu taken a wife?\u201dBecause she already spoke for so long, Xiao Yao was back to being animated again and she laughed \u201cMom, you\u2019ll never believe this even in your dreams! You should ask how many wives he has rather than if he has a wife.\u201d Xiao Yao sat cross-legged and used her fingers to count for her mom \u201cHe has the Sheng Nong clan, and in the Middle Plains he has the Tan family, the Ji family, the Gong family, and in the North he has the Wan Mei family, the Li Jie family, and in the West he has the Heng Sa family, the Xiao Yue family, and \u2026\u2026oh! There are too many that I can\u2019t even remember them all!\u201dAh Heng softly sighed, happy to know that Zhuan Xu was safe and well but also dismayed shock \u201cHe\u2019s nothing like Fourth brother and Fourth sister-in-law.\u201dXiao Yao looked at the Grand Emperor since only he knew her Fourth Uncle like her mom did and could share in her opinion. The Grand Emperor said \u201cZhuan Xu looks a lot like Chang Yi, but his personality is like Qing Yang. And a little bit like me. But he\u2019s more capable than Qing Yang and myself, he has the best from both of us.\u201dAh Heng said \u201cThank you for taking care of and teaching Zhuan Xu.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s voice was pained \u201cYou know\u2026.that\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s what I owe to Qing Yang and Chang Yi, and also to you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cMom, my medical skills are very strong now and I can find a way to heal you. After Mom is healed then you can see Zhuan Xu.\u201d She eagerly asked \u201cWhere is Qi Yo? Didn\u2019t Mom say he has been with you? Why doesn\u2019t he come out to see me?\u201dAh Heng gently said \u201cFrom the moment you stepped inside the peach blossom forest, your daddy has been keeping you company.\u201dXiao Yao looked around \u201cWhere? How come I can\u2019t see him?\u201dAh Heng saw Jing still kneeling there and called him to stand up before saying to the Grand Emperor \u201cShao Hao, I want to talk to Xiao Yao alone.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dThe Grand Emperor led Jing to the side where they couldn\u2019t hear the conversation anymore.Ah Heng warmly said \u201cXiao Yao, do you want to know how I met your daddy?\u201dXiao Yao nodded and remembered her mom couldn\u2019t see her through the peach blossom petals so added \u201cI want to know.\u201d\u201cI was the littlest daughter of the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor and I had three full blood older brothers above me. But sadly my second brother Yun Zhe died before I was born and my eldest brother Qing Yang was always very strict with me. My mom and my fourth brother Chang Yi coddled and pampered me. When I was small I loved to play so I often snuck down the mountain and my mom didn\u2019t try to control me. I took my mom\u2019s maiden last name and called myself Xi Ling Heng and wandered the vast wilderness. One summer evening when the sun was setting in the sky, I was on my way to Buo Fu nation when I met a man wearing a red robe\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIn her mom\u2019s story Xiao Yao became the young girl Ah Heng and lived through her happiness and sorrows with Qi Yo.That man called Qi Yo gradually aligned with Xiao Yao\u2019s childhood memories of him and was no longer a stranger to her.When Ah Heng and Qi Yo made the promise to each other under the peach blossom tree in the Jiu Li tribe to meet every year there, Xiao Yao was so happy for them but also so worried.When Ah Heng heard that the Yellow Emperor wanted her to marry her fiancee Shao Hao, she injured her eldest brother Qing Yang to escape Xuan Yuan Mountain and ran to Jiu Li to wait all night under the peach blossom tree. But that night the Sheng Nong Flame Emperor died and Qi Yo couldn\u2019t come because the entire Sheng Nong Mountain was under lockdown and he broke their promise. Xiao Yao was so anxious for them.When Ah Heng decided to marry Shao Hao for the sake of her mom and brother, Qi Yo came to disrupt the wedding ceremony. On the bird bridge Qi Yo tried to take Ah Heng away but his power was no match for Shao Yao who sent him flying into the water. Xiao Yao cried for them.When Ah Heng and Shao Hao agreed to only have a marriage alliance in name but not be husband-wife in reality, Xiao Yao was happy for Qi Yo but also sad for Shao Hao because he didn\u2019t know then that he would live to regret this decision for the rest of his life.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell like a downpour as she listened to her eldest uncle\u2019s death, her fourth uncle\u2019s death, Qi Yo\u2019s anguish, her mom\u2019s despair\u2026..In the end Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes were swollen red from crying but Ah Heng\u2019s voice remained very calm and peaceful \u201cBehind him was Sheng Nong and behind me was Xuan Yuan. He \u2013 could never forsake Sheng Nong. I \u2013 could never betray Xuan Yuan. So in the end we could only battle to the death on the field. I\u2019m sorry Xiao Yao, Mom lied to you. When I said goodbye to you on Jade Mountain I was already certain I was heading to my death.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026.what about Daddy?\u201dAh Heng said \u201cI never asked him but he likely wasn\u2019t. He was too brashly\u00a0arrogant and would never go anywhere antic.i.p.ating\u00a0death. But in the end, he died and I lived.\u201dXiao Yao anxiously asked \u201cBut Mom you said you weren\u2019t alone these past four hundred years and Daddy has been with you?\u201d\u201cTo save Xuan Yuan I summoned forth the sun\u2019s fire power that was hidden in my body but the power was too strong that even a G.o.ddess couldn\u2019t control it so I lost my consciousness and became a killing demon. I was destroying everything when your daddy saved me by using his own heart to replace my heart that was destroyed by the sun\u2019s fire power. I promised him \u201cthe vines entwine the tree even if it\u2019s dead, the tree remains with the vines even if it dies\u201d and I wanted to die with him but he asked me to stay alive. He said \u201cI never had parents and I don\u2019t want my daughter also to have no parents. Since Xiao Yao was born I never once did my duty as a father so the only thing I can do for her to is keep her mother alive for her so that she can only day know what kind of people her parents were so that she doesn\u2019t need to live her life in shame.\u201dAh Heng touched the peach blossom tree \u201cXiao Yao, your daddy\u00a0never ever did anything in his entire life that he needed to apologize or feel ashamed about. He never let down the Sheng Nong tribe or the Flame Emperor that he owed a debt of grat.i.tude to. The only thing he regretted when he died was you, his only regret was that he was never able to hear you call him daddy! He asked me \u201cTell Xiao Yao that I loved her very much, tell her that her mom and dad didn\u2019t do anything wrong and she should never feel ashamed about us.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s tears fell and she was in such pain she couldn\u2019t talk.Ah Heng touched her chest with one hand and pointed to the peach blossom forest with her other hand \u201cYour daddy\u2019s heart is inside my body and your daddy\u2019s body transformed into the peach blossom forest. Xiao Yao, he\u2019s been with me this entire time as we waited for you to come.\u201dXiao Yao looked up at the peach blossom petals falling around her, caressing her cheeks and twining around her body, so tender, so affectionate, just like a dad\u2019s embrace.Xiao Yao\u2019s tears poured forth and she yelled \u201cDaddy! Daddy! Daddy\u2026.I\u2019m your daughter Xiao Yao. Do you hear that? Daddy! Daddy\u2026\u2026..\u201dHer heartwrenching screams reverberated around the forest and a gust of wine appeared to rise as the petals danced around her.Xiao Yao cried to her mom \u201cMom, do you think Daddy heard me?\u201dAh Heng touched her head and smiled \u201cXiao Yao, Mom needs to go now.\u201d\u201cGo? No, no, Mom, you come back with me and I\u2019ll heal you\u2026\u2026\u201dAh Heng walked towards Xiao Yao and her features were finally revealed.In the red light Xiao Yao saw her mom and she didn\u2019t have a single strand of hair on her head and her features were dried and shriveled, frightening and ugly beyond belief.Ah Heng also finally saw Xiao Yao clearly and smiled \u201cYour eyes are exactly like your daddy! Your daddy was right, when I finally saw you all the pain would be worth it! Xiao Yao, Mom knows you don\u2019t want me to go but Mom really is so very tired. Now that you\u2019re all grown up and have a lover to take care of you and Zhuan Xu to look after you, Mom can finally leave to be reunited with your daddy.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart was like a knife cutting through but she knew death was the best release for her mom. Her mom already lived in this G.o.dforsaken state for the last four hundred years to wait for her.Ah Heng walked up to Xiao Yao and in the falling petals she reached out and pulled Xiao Yao into her arms for an embrace.To let his wife and daughter finally reunite, the peach blossom forest disappeared. An embrace right before death was so solemn and comforting as Ah Heng cried \u201cQi Yo, Xiao Yao, our family is finally together!\u201dAh Heng\u2019s body gradually vanished and Xiao Yao tried to hold onto her \u201cMom! Mom\u2026..\u201d but it was like trying to catch falling sand.Ah Heng smiled and kissed Xiao Yao on the peach blossom birthmark on her forehead and Xiao Yao watched as her mom turned into a beautiful blue light that joined the red peach blossom petals dancing around.In the haze Xiao Yao saw her daddy wearing a red robe standing beside her mom dressed in blue. Her daddy was still the proud and powerful warrior in her memory and her mom was back being her beautiful vibrant old self. The two of them were standing side by side in embrace while smiling at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao ran towards them reaching out her hand wanting to hold onto them \u201cDaddy! Mom! Daddy, Mom, don\u2019t leave me\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer parents gradually disappeared as the peach blossom petals melted and everything vanished. There was no burning desert, no peach blossom forest, no red flaming sky.Xiao Yao stood there in a daze for the longest time before she turned back around \u201cMy daddy and my mom are gone.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s hair had turned all white and he had tears in his eyes.Xiao Yao looked up at the sudden clap of thunder and the sky tore open in a torrential downpour. In a split second everyone\u2019s face was sopping wet.Once Promised- Qi Yo and Ah Heng\u2019s Ending:\u201cAh Heng.\u201d Shao Hao could say nothing more but he held onto Ah Heng and wouldn\u2019t let go.Ah Heng took out a blood stained handkerchief \u201cYou copied my writing and wrote this note asking Qi Yo to go to Ju Mountain to save my Fourth Brother, right?\u201dShao Hao saw the blood and glanced at Ah Heng\u2019s missing finger and his body shuddered slightly.Ah Heng saw that he didn\u2019t deny it and smiled \u201cThank you. Actually\u2026I don\u2019t hate you anymore. You aren\u2019t our Eldest Brother so asking you to save my Fourth Brother was asking too much to begin with.\u201d\u201cI promised to take good care of you and Chang Yi and it was I who didn\u2019t fulfill my promise to Qing Yang. If you hate and loathe me, that\u2019s only to be expected.\u201dAh Heng softly sighed \u201cWhen we were young we all thought we could just be ourselves and do what we wanted to do. It was later that we realized that we couldn\u2019t break free of the chains of family and birth. You are Gao Xing Shao Hao, you can\u2019t go save someone even if you wanted to. I am Xuan Yuan Ba, I have to kill people even when I don\u2019t want to. Some things we want to do but can\u2019t, other things we don\u2019t want to do but are forced to. Even I\u2019m in this position, much less you as the ruler of a nation. There are even more things you can\u2019t do or are forced to do.\u201dShao Hao was praying for Ah Heng\u2019s understanding and now that this moment arrived and she understood the dilemma he faced, he didn\u2019t feel comforted. Instead he felt this overbearing sadness. Both he and Qing Yang wanted to protect and s.h.i.+eld Ah Heng, not wanting her to become like them. But in the end Ah Heng became just like them. If Qing Yang was still alive and saw Ah Heng standing here wearing her battle armor with her sword in hand as she commanded thousands of attacking troops, his heart would break.Their destiny was to keep the world safe, but they couldn\u2019t even keep their closest loved ones safe!\u201cAh Heng\u2026\u2026..\u201dThere was heavy exhaustion in Ah Heng\u2019s eyes as she stared down at Shao Hao\u2019s hand on her arm \u201cLet go. I don\u2019t hate you anymore but we can\u2019t go back to the way it was. Because I now truly understand you, that\u2019s also why I\u2019m certain that we can\u2019t even be friends. You are Gao Xing Shao Hao and I am Xuan Yuan Ba!\u201dShao Hao\u2019s heart was ice cold as his body felt powerless and his hand slacked.Ah Heng lifted the curtains and walked out.That night as all the troops were asleep, Ah Heng took Ah Bi out to survey the geography. She saw in the desolation a peach blossom tree blooming in an empty courtyard and realized that it was peach blossom season again and she didn\u2019t even realize it. Yi Province wasn\u2019t far from Jiu Li so she said to Ah Bi \u201cLet\u2019s go to Jiu Li!\u201dThe entire tribe seemed empty with only a few nicely dressed young ladies but no one was attending the peach blossom festival as they sat quietly outside their homes.Ah Heng walked into the valley and saw the blooming peach blossoms but there were no young men singing songs to the young women. Where did everyone go? A soft singing reached Ah Heng and she followed the voice to see a white haired old woman humming a tune under the peach blossom tree.The old woman asked \u201cYou\u2019re an outsider, right? Are you here for our peach blossom festival? Come back in a few years, all the men have gone to war and they will be back in a few years.\u201dAh Heng asked \u201cHow long have you been waiting for your lover?\u201d\u201cSixteen years.\u201dAh Heng was silent, the dead bodies turned into white bones in the battlefield remained lovers to the women waiting for their return. Day in and day out, the corpses turned to dust on the field as the women\u2019s hair turned white waiting for their return.The woman saw Ah Heng staring at her with pity and yelled \u201cHe will be back! He will be back\u2026\u2026\u201d Her voice gradually got smaller \u201cThe war will end, the war will end! The Sheng Nong and Xuan Yuan war will end and then he will be back\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAh Heng\u2019s heart broke, this desolation was caused by them! The common folks didn\u2019t care who won, they just wanted the war to end as soon as possible so they could resume their ordinary happy life.She made a solemn vow to the old woman \u201cYes, the war will end.\u201dAh Heng walked away through the peach blossom forest and into the back hill where a white altar stood in the center. She walked up to the altar and saw an animal bone wind chime laying on the ground. She hung it back up on the pole and the wind blew a melody from the chime.On Jade Mountain, in those lonely sixty years, she spent it accompanied by the sound of the wind chimes. She clearly already fell in love with him but refused to admit it. She left him in Qi Yo fort and moved to the nearby De Wa fort but clearly still worried about him but forced herself not to acknowledge it\u2026\u2026.Ding dong, ding dong\u2026..The sound remained as clear as ever but in the blink of an eye it had been hundreds of years. She was still as young and radiant in looks but her heart was old and weary.Ah Heng turned to leave when suddenly everything stopped.In the falling peach blossom there stood Qi Yo dressed in all red, quietly waiting for her like an unmovable mountain. It was like that back then, it is like that now, and it would forever be like that.Qi Yo broke into a beaming smile and extended his hand to her. Ah Heng smiled back and rushed off the altar like a b.u.t.terfly traversing through the petals into Qi Yo\u2019s arms.They held hands and smiled into each others eyes.The entire sky full of stars could not match the aura of their smiles.Qi Yo held Ah Heng\u2019s hand and they walked through the peach blossoms back to their bamboo residence.The residence was kept neat and tidy inside and out with the courtyard filled with tended flowers of various colors. Opening the door, they walked inside and Ah Heng stared at Qi Yo as her throat constricted. Their home, he kept it so well tended.Qi Yo smiled at her before he pulled her in for an embrace and kissed her on the forehead.They sat down facing each other and shared a jug of wine, just like hundreds of years ago. Neither said a word, as if even speaking would be wasting their time together. Neither took their eyes off each other as if even a blink would make everything disappear.Ah Heng started to undress Qi Yo who smiled and complied before he moved her to bed and slowly undressed her. He poured wine down her body and his lips followed the trail. In the small residence there was no Sheng Nong or Xuan Yuan, just a man and a woman who loved each other sharing the most primal of pleasures and the most pa.s.sionate happiness.Both of them woke up at the same time in the middle of the night.The moonlight trickled in through the window and Ah Heng stared greedily at Qi Yo\u2019s face before tracing it slowly as if to etch it into her memory.Qi Yo smiled and stared at her until tears came to her eyes. He pulled her into his arms as she traced a line of words on his chest \u201cThe entwisted tree will entwine in life and in death.\u201dQi Yo initially didn\u2019t realize Ah Heng was writing on his chest and after he realized it then he could feel that she was writing the same words over and over. Qi Yo grabbed her hand and brought it to his lip for a kiss with their fingers entwined.Ah Heng stared at Qi Yo who smiled back and their bodies were once again entwined as if trying to become one forever with such fervor and desperation. Finally both were exhausted but still loath to part as they embraced tightly.Qi Yo softly asked \u201cWhere is our daughter? Is she safe? You know there are too many people in this world who hate me.\u201d This was the first time Qi Yo seemed worried about his enemies.\u201cOn Jade Mountain, with the Royal Mother protecting her. And Lie Yang keeping watch over her.\u201dQi Yo was rea.s.sured \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThe moonlight shone on the wall and a small red light reflected. Ah Heng asked \u201cWhat is that?\u201dQi Yo lifted his arm and the small bow hanging on the wall flew into his hand. The red light vanished and the bow become the size of his palm. It was the Ancient Pan Gu Bow, a priceless treasure that Qi Yo hung casually on the wall.Ah Heng laughed \u201cYou still haven\u2019t tossed this away?\u201dQi Yo picked up the bow and stared at it under the moonlight \u201cI tried to pull it many times but it never responded. But I can feel that this isn\u2019t a useless item, I simply haven\u2019t divined exactly how it\u2019s used and what it\u2019s meant for.\u201dAh Heng heard the legend of the Ancient Bow when she lived on Jade Mountain and it was stored there. Legend had it that the first Emperor Pan Gu created the bow to find the woman he loved. But it wasn\u2019t clear why Pan Gu never once used it or why he designated it as the number one weapon in the ranking of all G.o.dly weapons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s became a drifter by life\u2019s cruel realities but her personality and background would have led her down a different path had she not been separated from her parents. But that path would not have crossed with Jing or Xiang Liu, and perhaps I\u2019m selfish because I think all the suffering made her a better person than all the rich n.o.bles ladies around her and opened up a new path in life for her.With Xiao Yao\u2019s tearful reunion with her mom over with, she gained a real amazing daddy but lost an adopted equally awesome dad, an upheaval that is easier to deal with because she has Jing back beside her. Jing also got mommy\u2019s approval and that\u2019s gotta mean something, that even Xiao Yao\u2019s mom totally approves of why Xiao Yao is so certain she wants Jing. Will Jing and Xiao Yao\u2019s marital plans finally come to fruition now that danger and secrets have been overcome? This chapter takes the lovebirds into Jiu Li and unravels the true mysteries of the Lover\u2019s Bug that binds Xiao Yao and Xiang Liu. It\u2019s so romantic and bittersweet, just the way those two have always been with each other.Chapter 37 \u2013 Love Will Grow Old Together with the Verdant Mountains:Above Chi Sui, a Gao Xing merchant s.h.i.+p smoothly glided across the water.Inside the s.h.i.+p\u2019s hold, a full hair of white Grand Emperor rested on the pallet with Ru So and Jing standing beside him while Xiao Yao sat on the pallet to serve him medicine.After he drank the medicine, he coolly said to Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019ll help you extract the Face Forming Flower and then you two depart\u00a0the s.h.i.+p.\u201dXiao Yao got on her knees \u201cDad you were gravely injured because of me, I want to take care\u2026.\u201dThe Grand Emperor cut her off and impatiently said \u201cI said it had nothing to do with you. It\u2019s what I owed Qing Yang, Chang Yi, and the Xuan Yuan Princess. It\u2019s unrelated to Qi Yo, and even more unrelated to you! Come to think of it, Qi Yo once injured me seriously, I still have a bone to pick with him.\u201dXiao Yao was brokenhearted, was all the love she received since she was born and the protection he gave her in the desert, that was all because he owed her uncles and her mom? Not one whit was because of her?The Grand Emperor stared at the red peach blossom mark on Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead and his heart was so conflicted. When Ah Heng tearfully sealed the Face Forming Flower before his eyes, he already knew it meant he was going to be separated from her forever. He waved his hand over Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead and a flash of red streaked across before\u00a0the peach blossom mark vanished leaving only a beautiful peach blossom branch in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand.The Grand Emperor closed his eyes and said to Ru So \u201cEscort them out.\u201dRu So courteously moved to escort them out so Xiao Yao bowed her head three times on the ground before leaving the cabin with Jing.The three of them stood on the s.h.i.+p\u2019s deck and Ru So checked to see they were alone before asking \u201cThousands of years ago His majesty was already renowned as the most powerful warrior in the entire vast wilderness. During his lifetime only Qi Yo was able to hurt him, but this time His majesty returned severely injured. I don\u2019t mean to pry about what happened but need to ask if there is anything I need to guard against?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cHis majesty was not injured by a person but by\u2026..that desert.\u201dRu So knew that desert which he tried to enter when he was young and reckless with his friends and they almost burned up alive in there. He knew how dangerous it was, yet he could sense that since yesterday it started to rain there and the deadly heat had vanished. By next spring the desert would be sprouting bits of green and in no time it would be a verdant landscape once again.Ru So didn\u2019t know what happened but knew when to stop probing. If the Grand Emperor wasn\u2019t injured by an individual then he could relax. Ru So smiled \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to keep the two of you but\u2026\u2026..\u201d He shrugged \u201cLet\u2019s part now but when the two of you get married then I will arrive bearing a large wedding gift.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s lingering sadness was washed away by his ribbing and she scoffed \u201cSo lofty in position now yet you still are so whatever!\u201dJing\u2019s white crane winged ride arrived and circled the s.h.i.+p. Jing bid farewell to Ru So and embraced Xiao Yao by the waist to jump on the crane before it called out and ascended into the clouds.Jing asked Xiao Yao \u201cBack to Sheng Nong Mountain or to the East Sea?\u201dXiao Yao looked at the package on Jing\u2019s back and said \u201cTo Jiu Li.\u201d Her mom and dad\u2019s only wish was to be an ordinary husband and wife and grow old together. But they controlled thousands of soldiers yet could never give themselves a home.The crane arrived in Jiu Li in half a day, a place with the reputation of being filled with deadly toxins and noxious gases, with vicious wild beasts and poisonous foliage. The only famous thing it ever produced was Qi Yo and voodoo, both of which had the worst reputation in the world.This was the first time Xiao Yao visited but she heard her mom describe it so it felt familiar \u2013 Qi Yo\u2019s fort, the white altar, the peach blossom forest, the green bamboo tower.Jing visited Jiu Li before with the Tu Shan merchant group so he knew the various forts so he flew directly to Qi Yo\u2019s fort. Xiao Yao saw the white altar immediately not because it was big but because in the entire fort of little bamboo huts it was made of pure white rock.Xiao Yao vaulted down the winged ride and stared at the familiar yet foreign altar which was weathered with time. Hanging on all four sides were wind chimes made of animal bones, giving off a melodic sound that her parents listened to thousands of years ago.A few voodoo masters walked out and stared tensely at Xiao Yao and Jing. An old voodoo master used very stiff Middle Plains language to say \u201cOutsiders are not welcome here.\u201dXiao Yao used very stiff Jiu Li language to answer back \u201cMy father was a Jiu Li person.\u201dThe voodoo masters expressions grew less tense but likely they have been taken advantage of before so they were still wary. The old voodoo master asked \u201cWhere is your dad now?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026.he\u2019s dead!\u201dXiao Yao looked at Jing who took the bag from his back and handed it to Xiao Yao. She clutched it in her arms \u201cI brought him and my mom back so that they can return to here per their wishes.\u201dThe voodoo masters stared in sadness at the bag in Xiao Yao\u2019s arms. Because the people of Jiu Li were considered untouchables of the lowest cla.s.s, the women were born into servitude and the men into slavery. Every twenty to thirty years, the young men and women of Jiu Li would be delivered to the outside world to become household slaves. Most of them would never be heard from again and never return to their homeland.The voodoo master asked \u201cWhich fort does your dad belong to? We can sing a soul summoning song for him. You spread his ashes around his fort perimeter and he will be summoned home.\u201d\u201cHe belongs to the Qi Yo fort. I think\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Yao glanced around and saw the peach blossom forest beyond the altar \u201cMy parents home is over there.\u201dThe voodoo masters expressions all changed and immediately moved to attack Xiao Yao but a very old man with a full head of white hair shouted \u201cCease!\u201d\u201cVoodoo King.\u201d The voodoo masters all respectfully took steps back.The Voodoo King walked to Xiao Yao and looked at her carefully \u201cMiss, you are certain your parents once lived there?\u201d\u201cMy mom said that their bamboo hut was not far from the altar and inside a peach blossom forest. In this area there is only the peach blossom forest on the hill over there.\u201dThe Voodoo King began a long voodoo chant like a song that was from ancient times. Xiao Yao memorized the chant before but never knew it could be sung like this so she joined in as well.The Voodoo King stared at Xiao Yao with tears in his eyes and the voodoo masters all gaped in shock and awe at her. This voodoo song was the work of the most powerful Voodoo King of all time and only the subsequent Voodoo Kings could sing the entire song.Xiao Yao nodded to the Voodoo King and headed to the peach blossom forest.The Voodoo King called out \u201cMiss, do you know that hill is sacred ground in Jiu Li. We venerate Qi Yo there. In the past thousand years only Qi Yo and his wife the Xi Ling G.o.ddess lived there.\u201dXiao Yao stopped in her steps. So here her mom\u2019s only ident.i.ty was as her dad\u2019s wife. After a second she continued walking \u201cI know now.\u201d\u201cWhat does the young miss call yourself?\u201d\u201cXi Ling Jiu Yao.\u201dThe news that Xiao Yao was Qi Yo\u2019s daughter was well-known gossip in the vast wilderness but due to Jiu Li being so remote the news didn\u2019t spread here. So the Voodoo King was trembling with excitement as he walked Xiao Yao and Jing enter the peach blossom forest. He ordered \u201cSummon all the voodoo masters to prepare a large prayer ceremony.\u201dBefore coming here Xiao Yao thought the residence would be run down so was surprised to see it intact and well kept. Even the foliage outside was tended to and a mult.i.tude of flowers grew around the residence. A bucket was placed next to the well as if the owner had just stepped aside and was planning to be right back.Xiao Yao lightly pushed open the door and walked in.A large portrait was hung in the main entrance chamber of Qi Yo wearing all red and standing on the back of his giant condor winged ride with an arrogant fearless look on his face.Xiao Yao placed the bag on the table and stared at the portrait for a long time before smiling at Jing \u201cThis is my dad.\u201dJing got on his knees and bowed three times before lighting three incense sticks.Xiao Yao leaned against the window and stared out at the peach blossom forest \u201cWhen I pushed open the door, for a split second I thought my mom and dad would answer me if I called out to them.\u201dJing walked up behind Xiao Yao and embraced her \u201cTired?\u201dXiao Yao closed her eyes \u201cA bit. I\u2019m not as strong as I act like. All of the insults, the derision, the hatred\u2026.I felt it.\u201dJing said \u201cIt\u2019s been over seventy years now but when I see the scars on my body I still can feel the pain and the shame. It\u2019s normal to feel and only by feeling the pain can we also feel the happiness. It proves that our heart is still beating.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true but I still wish I can be stronger.\u201d\u201cCrying when sad, avoiding when hurting, that\u2019s all normal reaction. A moment of weakness does not mean cowardly, it\u2019s to let the wound heal and conserve strength for the future.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cSo be it! With your explanation and encouragement I\u2019ll just let myself be weak all I want now then!\u201dJing smiled back and clasped her hand.A choral singing reached them from the altar and Xiao Yao asked \u201cThey are singing, what for?\u201d\u201cA prayer ceremony. I think they are welcoming your mom and dad home. The Jiu Li people do not see death the same way as the Middle Plains. They think life comes from nature and death is not the end but is instead a return.\u201d The song comforted the soul and led it back, a plaintive ballad that wasn\u2019t sorrowful.Xiao Yao was silent for awhile before she picked up the bag from the table \u2013 inside was dirt she collected from the desert north of Chi Sui.\u201cJing, can I borrow your winged ride?\u201dThe white crane flew over and Xiao Yao got on its back.The crane rose into the air and flew over the altar where Xiao Yao saw over twenty voodoo masters dressed in ceremonial prayer robes singing and dancing. They saw Xiao Yao and paid no heed and continued their singing and dancing.The crane flew over the rivers and hills and Xiao Yao opened her bag to look at the dirt from the peach blossom forest. Because it contained hundreds of years of fallen petals the dirt was red-tinted in color.Xiao Yao picked up handfuls of it and opened her palms to let the wind carry it away.The red dirt flew in the air like droplets of blood and disappeared into the rivers and hills.The Voodoo King led his voodoo masters in praying and singing.Many years later in the Jiu Li mountains there would grow maple trees with leaves as red as blood. A Voodoo King explained it as the red maple being formed from the blood of Qi Yo so generations of Jiu Li people would venerate the maple as their sacred tree.When Xiao Yao woke up it was almost noon.She asked in shock \u201cI slept that long? And you didn\u2019t wake me?\u201dJing set the table \u201cIt\u2019s rare you slept so well, of course I was going to let you sleep as much as you want.\u201d In the past year even when Xiao Yao smiled there was hidden sadness in her eyes. Now she finally got closure and slept soundly, of course Jing didn\u2019t have the heart to wake her.Xiao Yao sat down at the table and buried her head in the food.After eating, the two of them strolled in the hills and Xiao Yao felt that every place looked familiar. She shared her mom and dad\u2019s story with Jing.The two arrived at the white altar and saw the Voodoo King sitting under a tree drinking tea.Xiao Yao stopped and said to Jing \u201cYou go back first, I have something I need to talk with the Voodoo King privately.\u201dJing didn\u2019t leave \u201cAre you planning to ask him about the voodoo bug in your body and in Xiang Liu\u2019s body?\u201dXiao Yao sheepishly admitted \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to keep it from you, I just didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201dJing said \u201cKeeping it from me is what will worry me. Let me stay with you, okay?\u201dXiao Yao nodded.Seeing Jing and Xiao Yao, the Voodoo King invited them to join him for tea.Xiao Yao sipped her tea and said \u201cI have a friend named Se Mai Er and wanted to ask the Voodoo King what fort she belongs to?\u201dThe Voodoo King replied \u201cSo you\u2019re the person who knows voodoo and helped Se Mai Er. She\u2019s dead now but she was my mom\u2019s older sister. Years ago it was actually my mom who was to be sent to the outside but she already had a beloved and was carrying me so my aunt went in my mom\u2019s place to be a slave. Thank you for helping her come home safely.\u201dXiao Yao silently poured her tea on the ground for Se Mai Er\u2019s pa.s.sing.The Voodoo King continued \u201cSe Mai Er mentioned that you wanted to know how to break the Lover\u2019s Bug voodoo spell?\u201dXiao Yao quickly glanced at Jing and acted nonchalant \u201cWhen I placed the voodoo bug I didn\u2019t know it had such a weird name.\u201dJing smiled \u201cIt\u2019s just a name, why are you in a rush to explain?\u201dXiao Yao quickly said \u201cYes, yes! It\u2019s just a name.\u201dThe Voodoo King coughed once and solemnly explained \u201cLover\u2019s Bug, like its name indicates is a pair of male-female voodoo bugs. The couple who has the bug successfully planted will have their life and emotions connected. If one hurts then the other will hurt. If one is injured then the other will also be injured.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThis I know already. What else?\u201d\u201cTo outsiders voodoo is considered mysterious and bad, but really its a craft and magic that the Jiu Li tribe has pa.s.sed down through generations to protect and heal us. Jiu Li has lots of deadly insects, deadly plants, deadly ga.s.ses, to live here our ancestors had to learn to understand it and control it. Voodoo is seen as a harmful power but we actually mostly use it here to save lives. The Lover\u2019s Bug keeps two people\u2019s lives connected, which means when one is injured as long as the other is healthy then then injured person will survive. This is a very good thing. Even if the Lover\u2019s Bug is notoriously hard to grow, it ought to still be relatively prevalent since many people will try to grow it. So why it is so rare to see?\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAll living things that have a benefit must also carry a harm. The greater the benefit then the greater the potential for harm. The Lover\u2019s Bug is exactly that. It can lead two people to be connected in life and emotions but it is just like a pair of lovers in love with each other. It is tempermental and hard to control. If the Lover\u2019s Bug turns on each other then both people will die. Which is why the Lover\u2019s Bug also has another name, the Heartbreak Bug.\u201dJing stared in dismay at Xiao Yao who quickly said \u201cIt can\u2019t be as scary as he makes it out to be. It\u2019s been over seventy years and I\u2019m still just fine.\u201dThe Voodoo King\u2019s expression changed as he stared at Jing \u201cYou\u2019re not the man the other bug is planted in?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe Voodoo King stared in shock at Xiao Yao \u201cCan I feel the bug in you?\u201dXiao Yao noddedThe Voodoo King didn\u2019t move so he was likely using a bug inside of himself to sense. He furrowed his brows and murmured \u201cIt really is a Lover\u2019s Bug! But how is this possible? \u2018Lovers who raise the bug produce the Lover\u2019s Bug, Not Lovers who raise the bug produce the Heartbreak Bug.\u2019 The Lover\u2019s Bug is different then other voodoo bugs and absolutely requires the couple to willingly accept the bug for it to be successfully planted. If the man you successfully planted the other bug in is not your lover, then how did you plant it in him?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou might not know as much as your ancestors, the bug could be more multi-facted and evolving in ways beyond your understanding.\u201dThe Voodoo King was still perplexed. But it was clear that the young man sitting beside Xiao Yao was clearly her beloved so the rest of what he wanted to say wasn\u2019t suitable for discussing at this time. He smoothed things over \u201cMiss you are likely right, the bug inside of you is different than other bugs. Likely Miss and the other man have very unique bodily compositions.\u201dXiao Yao inwardly sighed in relief \u201cHe is very unique!\u201d Since the bug was planted, only Xiang Liu could sense her but she could never sense him.Jing anxiously asked \u201cHow to break the spell?\u201dThe Voodoo King\u2019s face scrunched up \u201cThe Lover\u2019s Bug \u2013 either live in love or die in heartbreak. Once the Lover\u2019s Bug has been planted there is no way to break the spell. It is impossible. This is what I was trying to say earlier for why so few people raise it despite the great benefit. Only very determined girls would raise the bug but even if they successfully raise it, it\u2019s near impossible to find a man willing to accept the other bug to be planted in him.\u201dJing was stunned and after a moment of silence he slowly asked \u201cWhat happens if one person who has the Lover\u2019s Bug dies? What happens to the other person?\u201dThe Voodoo King sighed \u201cOur Jiu Li folk ballad sings \u2018The twisted roots of the parasol tree entwine on land, the doves do not fly alone in the sky, the pair of mandarin ducks in the water always die together.'\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao and tightly grabbed her hand.Xiao Yao smiled at him and made a joke face \u201cDon\u2019t worry! We don\u2019t need to believe everything the Voodoo King says. Don\u2019t forget, he said that only a pair of lovers in love could the bug be successfully planted. But I don\u2019t have any relations.h.i.+p with Xiang Liu but we still successfully planted the bug. The Voodoo King also said the spell couldn\u2019t be broken once the bug was planted but don\u2019t forget that I planted the bug first in Zhuan Xu before Xiang Liu helped me break the spell and move the bug to himself.\u201dJing let out a sigh of relief \u201cYes! The bug was moved from Zhuan Xu!\u201dXiao Yao shook Jing\u2019s hand \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there is no absolutes in this world. If no one has broken the spell before then let me be the first.\u201d She said to the Voodoo King \u201cOnce I break it I\u2019ll pa.s.s on the knowledge to you as grat.i.tude for your ancestor teaching me voodoo.\u201dThe Voodoo King smiled \u201cJiu Li people are the lowest untouchables and we have limited ability. But to protect the Miss we would do everything in our power. Please Miss never mention repaying any grat.i.tude.\u201dThis was the first time Xiao Yao was being treated with respect and offered kindness because of her real daddy. Xiao Yao\u2019s heart clenched and she didn\u2019t have the heart to decline \u201cThank you.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at the peach tree forest and Jing asked \u201cWant to spend another night?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cEverything is done that needed to be taken care of, let\u2019s go home! By now Xiao Xiao will have discovered that the Xiao Yao on the s.h.i.+p is a fake.\u201dXiao Yao bid farewell to the Voodoo King \u201cRight now the Xuan Yuan ruler is the Black Emperor. He\u2019s different than other rulers and in his eyes there are no cla.s.s differences. Please give him some time and he will lift Jiu Li\u2019s slave tribe designation.\u201dThe Voodoo King didn\u2019t know if that could ever happen but he bowed low to Xiao Yao \u201cMiss, please take care!\u201dXiao Yao and Jing returned to the bamboo hut and tidied it up before Xiao Yao said \u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201dJing was waiting outside on the crane allowing Xiao Yao some alone time to say farewell to her parents.Xiao Yao stood before Qi Yo\u2019s portrait for some time before softly saying \u201cDaddy, Mom, I\u2019m leaving now. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be just fine.\u201dShe turned and ran outside to greet Jing with a big smile and cheerfully said \u201cBack to the East Sea to look for Xiao Xiao and Miao Pu.\u201dWhen they returned to the Tu Shan s.h.i.+p, Xiao Xiao as expected figured out that the Xiao Yao on the s.h.i.+p was a clone but she didn\u2019t know where Xiao Yao went so she could only wait on the s.h.i.+p in the East Sea.Seeing them return, Maio Pu was so happy she could cry while Xiao Xiao remained as placid as usual as she greeted Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao scooted over with a grin \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if Gege gets mad I\u2019ll take all the blame.\u201dXiao Xiao didn\u2019t say thanks or no need, she just calmly asked \u201cDoes my lady want to return to Sheng Nong Mountain now?\u201dXiao Yao stared at the sea and didn\u2019t respond. Moments later she said \u201cI want to stay one night on the sea.\u201dThat night the waves rocked the s.h.i.+p and Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t sleep. She climbed off her pallet and draped a robe over herself and walked out on the deck.A slight ocean breeze, a bright round moon hanging in the sky reflecting the glittering light on the waves. It was beautifully silent.Under this big ocean she laid inside a giant white clam sh.e.l.l for thirty-seven years. No one knew how Xiang Liu managed to save her life, or that her body had changed. Every time Zhuan Xu would ask she would claim to have slept the entire time and remembered\u00a0nothing. But in her heart everything was crystal clear to her. His blood flowed inside her body. Even now her body clamored for the ocean. In the past she loved water but that feeling was nothing like what she felt now. Back then the ocean was the ocean and she was herself. Now she was a daughter of the sea, she could swim with the fishes and listen to the merpeople\u2019s song. She could dive into the deepest part of the ocean like a demon fish and could swim faster than a dolphin.With just one vault she could jump into the ocean and swim happily. But Xiao Yao refused, she tightly clenched her fist and warred with herself.The merpeople\u2019s song reached her from the depths of the ocean and Xiao Yao\u2019s heart lurched and she ran to the s.h.i.+p\u2019s bow to stare out into the distance. Under the silver moonlight a white haired white robed man was walking on the waves towards her.He said nothing and Xiao Yao didn\u2019t speak either. The two of them, one on the s.h.i.+p and the other on the water, they listened together to the song of the merpeople. The song spread out on the water\u2019s surface, melodic and pure, touching deep into the soul like a pa.s.sionate entreaty in darkness, like a longing sigh that shatters the heart, it made the soul rise and fall with the song.When the song ended Xiao Yao softly said \u201cSo beautiful!\u201dXiang Liu softly concurred \u201cYes.\u201dThe merpeople\u2019s song was in a pitch that very few people on earth could hear so in that split second Xiao Yao felt that her heart was intimately close to Xiang Liu and there was nothing she couldn\u2019t share with him. She said \u201cMy daddy is Qi Yo.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s eyes showed his amus.e.m.e.nt. Saying \u201cMy daddy is Qi Yo\u201d is very different than saying \u201cI am Qi Yo\u2019s daughter.\u201d The latter stated a truth complete with anger, the former was warm and loving about the relations.h.i.+p.\u201cWhen I first met you, back then you called yourself Wen Xiao Liu. Later your name was Gao Xing Jiu Yao. Now you are called Xi Ling Jiu Yao. If you ever get a fourth name, likely no one will be able to keep track.\u201dXiao Yao laughed out loud and immediately clasped her hand over her mouth and glanced back. Only after confirming she didn\u2019t alert anyone did she sa.s.s right back \u201cJust three names. In the future even if there is a fourth name, you have nine heads so use a brain to remember half a name and you can remember it all and still have room.\u201dXiang Liu coldly stared at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t scared in the least \u201cIf you dare raise a hand, then I dare to yell for help!\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cWhy do I need to do anything? Your dad is Qi Yo, there are plenty of people who will make your life difficult.\u201dXiao Yao laughed back \u201cI just came back from a trip to Jiu Li. The Voodoo King told me all the specifics about the bug inside our bodies. I don\u2019t remember any of the specifics of what he said but the one thing I do remember clearly is that the two bugs live and die together. Which means our lives are connected. If I\u2019m in trouble then you\u2019re not going to get off scot free!\u201dXiang Liu smiled at Xiao Yao and didn\u2019t seem surprised at all.Xiao Yao was shocked and asked \u201cYou\u2019ve known all along since the beginning what kind of bug this was, right?\u201d\u201cWhat if I did?\u201d\u201cThe Voodoo King said \u2018the doves don\u2019t fly alone in the sky, the pair of mandarin ducks in the water die together\u2019. If I die then how can you live?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask the question in reverse \u2013 if I die, then how can you live?\u201dXiao Yao tried to stay calm and plead with him \u201cI don\u2019t know who dies and who lives so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you. Tell me!\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s expression was sly and acted really nonchalant \u201cHow would I know? You\u2019re the one who learned some voodoo. This is the first time I played with a bug. But no need to fret, when either you or I die then we\u2019ll know what happens, right?\u201dXiao Yao was so frustrated by him she was nearly hopping up and down in fury \u201cYou broke the spell on Zhuan Xu so how could you not want to how to break the spell between us?\u201dXiang Liu smiled until his eyes were slits \u201cI don\u2019t want to know!\u201dXiao Yao wearily asked \u201cWhat do you want then?\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s body was slowly sinking into the water \u201cOther than checking on how my wares are doing in your body, what else do you think I want?\u201d\u201cHey! Don\u2019t go!\u201dXiao Yao flipped over the railing ready to dive into the water to chase after Xiang Liu but a pair of hands grabbed her hard and pulled her back on deck.\u201cLet me go\u2026\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao struggled and then turned around to see Jing. She meekly allowed him to keep her on deck.Xiao Yao tentatively asked \u201cWhen did you get up?\u201dJing said \u201cI\u2019ve been up for awhile.\u201d Actually, he couldn\u2019t sleep either so he knew from the moment Xiao Yao went on deck. But it was clear she wanted to be alone so he didn\u2019t go disturb her.From the very beginning Xiang Liu knew Jing was there on deck so Xiang Liu cast a spell that blocked anyone from hearing what he was discussing with Xiao Yao, except he allowed Jing to listen in.Seeing Xiao Yao going to chase after Xiang Liu, Jing couldn\u2019t explain the feeling but he rushed forward instinctively and grabbed Xiao Yao as if afraid she would vanish from his life.Xiao Yao said \u201cXiang Liu was just by and I asked him how to break the bug spell but he wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201dJing\u2019s worry dissipated.Xiao Yao said sadly \u201cI\u2019m not as glib as him, powers are not as high as him, all my poisons he eats like candy, every time I see him he is totally mean to me.\u201dJing smiled \u201cDo you want me to help you?\u201dXiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head \u201cNo, you two are business transactions, what\u2019s between him and me is purely personal. No need to mix it.\u201dJing nodded \u201cIf my mom were alive she could compliment her daughter-in-law on being a good merchant.\u201dXiao Yao teased back \u201cWho said I was going to be your wife?\u201dJing jerked Xiao Yao into his arms and tightly embraced her \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to be anyone else\u2019s wife!\u201dXiao Yao was startled and then quietly stayed in his arms.Jing stared at the ocean before softly saying \u201cXiao Yao, let\u2019s leave here tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\u201cBack to Sheng Nong Mountain then!\u201dXiao Yao purposely picked early morning to return to Sheng Nong Mountain. Zhuan Xu was in court in the morning and wouldn\u2019t have time to berate her.The Yellow Emperor was working the fields when he saw Xiao Yao and Jing. He put his hoe down and walked over.Jing bowed courteously \u201cYour majesty, Xiao Yao and I have returned.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cIt was summer when you left and it\u2019s fall now that you\u2019ve returned. You two must have visited many places and did many things.\u201dXiao Yao could tell the Yellow Emperor had more in what he was saying but she couldn\u2019t tell if he was angry or not \u201cGrandfather, it\u2019s not Jing\u2019s doing. I\u2026..\u201dJing said \u201cXiao Yao, let me explain to His majesty.\u201d He knew that Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t want Xiao Yao to have any further connection with the Grand Emperor and he would object if asked to bring her to see him. That\u2019s why he used the sightseeing trip was an excuse so that Xiao Yao could see the Grand Emperor but it was lying to the two Emperors. It was a huge transgression but to help Xiao Yao break through there was nothing Jing couldn\u2019t do, even if it meant incurring the wrath of two Emperors!Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know the extent of Jing\u2019s risk in planning this trip but knew he lied to the Yellow Emperor so she said \u201cThis is our family matter! I will tell Grandfather and Gege!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cXiao Yao is right, this is our family affair. Jing, you go home first!\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Jing to a.s.sure him she\u2019ll be fine and he could leave. Jing bowed farewell to the Yellow Emperor and left.The Yellow Emperor washed his hands and sat down in the corridor with a half cooled cup of tea.Xiao Yao sat down across from him and felt all sorts of emotions that she didn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cI\u2026..I went to the desert north of Chi Sui. I saw my mom.\u201dThe cup of tea in the Yellow Emperor\u2019s hand shattered and for a long time he said nothing before finally asked \u201cWas it painful for her when she pa.s.sed?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes teared up \u201cFor Mom, living was what was painful.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sadly lowered his head and after a long time asked \u201cXiao Yao, do you hate me?\u201d\u201cWhat you want to ask is whether my mom hated you? She didn\u2019t say but I think after all these years she has come to accept that Xuan Yuan taking over for Sheng Nong was going to happen no matter what. My mom and my dad\u2019s fated life was destined from the moment they met. Only if they didn\u2019t fall in love with each other, because once they fell in love then it was the beginning of the end for them. Zhuan Xu described you like the sun s.h.i.+ning down to bring life and warmth to the world. But those who got to close to you burned up and perished.\u201d\u201cDo you hate me?\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know. If I didn\u2019t sneak off Jade Mountain and grew up in the palace, I would definitely hate you. But I lived an ordinary hard-scrabble life out in the common world as just a citizen living under the rule of the Yellow Emperor. I felt your warmth so I can\u2019t ever fully hate you. Zhuan Xu once hated Zhu Rong who caused him to lose his parents but in the end for the people he accepted Little Zhu Rong. Just like Zhuan Xu once said, some men are born to take care of one family, others destined to take care of an entire clan. And you and Zhuan Xu live for people of the world, for millions of ordinary lives\u2026\u2026.you guys must sever personal feelings for the greater good. Grandfather, you don\u2019t need to ask if I hate you because whether I hate you or not everything has happened already.\u201dXiao Yao stood up \u201cI\u2019m going to wash and change. Oh right, if Zhuan Xu is angry with me then you need to be on my side. You can explain to him why the desert is now raining! My mom is his auntie so he ought to know the truth!\u201d That painful memory she didn\u2019t want to relive it again in explaining so she handed it off to the Yellow Emperor.His voice reached Xiao Yao from behind her so she stopped.\u201cBack then, I forced your mom to pick up arms and go into battle. All I wanted was for her to wear down Qi Yo\u2019s army and its willpower. After the soldiers will was low then I would arrive with reinforcements and attack. I never could have imagined that your mom would summon the sun power within her body, or that the sun power would be that deadly and uncontrollable. When I saw your mom turning into a demon I was filled with deep regret but it was too late. Xiao Yao, I have used countless people in my life but I never intended to sacrifice my daughter\u2019s life for my ambition.\u201dXiao Yao wiped her tears away \u201cI believe you. I also know Zhuan Xu would understand as well.\u201dThat night when Zhuan Xu arrived on Xiao Yue Peak, Xiao Yao was sitting on the swing under the phoenix tree softly swaying.Zhuan Xu\u2019s expression was dark and he glared at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao acted clueless and made a face at him \u201cGrandfather has something to say to you!\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t leave and checked out Xiao Yao carefully. He suddenly rushed over and lifted her chin and brushed her hair aside on her forehead \u201cWhere is the red peach blossom mark here?\u201dXiao Yao pointed to the peach blossom hair pin in her hair \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cHow did that happen? Did Master break the spell for you?\u201d\u201cGrandfather is waiting for you and he\u2019ll tell you what happened.\u201d\u201cWait here for me!\u201d Zhuan Xu rushed into the house.It wasn\u2019t until late into the night did Zhuan Xu come back out. Xiao Yao was still sitting on the swing and playing with an incense ball on a string in her hand to tease the fireflies.Zhuan Xu walked over and sat down on the gra.s.s. Xiao Yao tossed the incense ball to him and he tossed it back, together the two of them played with the fireflies as if creating a milky way of firefly light.Xiao Yao laughed out loud and Zhuan Xu joined in.Zhuan Xu quieted down and said \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I never imagined Auntie was still alive\u2026..I should have gone with you.\u201d From Auntie\u2019s death until being found alive and then really dying, Xiao Yao\u2019s pain was impossible to fathom. Every time he was in pain she was always beside him, but when she was in pain he was never beside her.Xiao Yao played with the incense ball and the fireflies circled her \u201cNo one could have imagined that. Even Grandfather and the Grand Emperor wasn\u2019t sure my mom was still alive. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m really going to be fine. In the past I hated my mom for abandoning me so that whenever I missed her I felt empty inside. Now I know that both my mom and dad really loved and cherished me. Even though they are gone but now when I think of them my heart feels full.\u201dZhuan Xu still couldn\u2019t forgive himself. When Xiao Yao was running for her life he wasn\u2019t beside her; when she was captured by the nine-tailed fox he wasn\u2019t beside her; when she went to see Auntie he wasn\u2019t beside her. Zhuan Xu seriously wanted to beat himself up.Xiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head and stared at Zhuan Xu \u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me anymore, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m mad at myself. Forget about the past\u2026.but at least now I ought to have been with you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the Black Emperor and have too many things you need to do. You can\u2019t travel the world with me! I appreciate that you have the heart though!\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and gradually the sorrowful rage in his heart expanded. He controlled the world now but he couldn\u2019t travel the world with Xiao Yao!\u201cZhuan Xu?\u201d Xiao Yao tossed the incense ball as the fireflies flew towards him.In the light she could see his expression filled with utter desolation. Zhuan Xu said \u201cI really wish I could accompany you like Jing, to tour the mountains and vistas, to ease your worries, to go see Auntie with you.\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu, it\u2019s really no big deal! I\u2019m fine!\u201dZhuan Xu looked up at the sky and suddenly asked \u201cWhat if my mom and dad didn\u2019t die, what would we be like now? What would I be like now?\u201dXiao Yao was taken aback and thought about it but didn\u2019t have a clue \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe like now, one of us sitting on the swing and the other sitting on the gra.s.s, both of us playing with fireflies. What do you think?\u201dZhuan Xu tossed the incense ball back to Xiao Yao \u201cI would be like my dad, in my entire life I would only love one woman. I will play the flute for her. I will build a swing for her. I will darken her brow for her. I will make cosmetics for her. I will take her back to Ruo Sui and marry her under the sacred Ruo Sui tree and be with her forever and always. No matter what, I would always be by her side.\u201dEven though this was a somber topic but Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and burst out laughing. She quickly apologized \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry! I don\u2019t want to laugh but I\u2026..I\u2026..can\u2019t imagine\u2026..if you really were like that then what will happen to all those women in Zhi Jin Palace. Who will they marry?\u201dZhuan Xu guffawed.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t see his expression but could sense sadness in his laughter. She quickly tossed the incense ball back \u201cZhuan Xu?\u201dZhuan Xu caught the incense ball and in the light of the fireflies his expression was absolutely normal and filled with laughter. It appeared he found amus.e.m.e.nt in what he said as well so Xiao Yao relaxed.Zhuan Xu stood up \u201cI\u2019m heading back. You hurry up and go to sleep.\u201dXiao Yao jumped down from the swing and carefully asked \u201cGege, you won\u2019t be mad at Jing, right? He only did it to help me.\u201dZhuan Xu played with the incense ball and said \u201cI didn\u2019t take care of you properly so what does that have to do with him?\u201d\u201cWill you punish Xiao Xiao and Miao Pu?\u201d\u201cSince you asked it means you don\u2019t want them punished so I won\u2019t punish them.\u201d\u201cI just knew you wouldn\u2019t be mad!\u201d Xiao Yao smiled sweetly and walked towards her room \u201cI\u2019m going to bed, see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cXiao Yao!Xiao Yao turned around and smiled at Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu stared at her and smiled before tossing the incense ball at her \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiao Yao often comes across as really clever, scheming and devious no less, the hardscrabble smarts of someone who\u2019s had to survive on her own and learned all the tricks. But she selectively chooses when to apply that brain of hers, and sometimes even though the answer is clear she can be clouded by personal feeling or an unwillingness to think about that particular issue. Case in point her relations.h.i.+p with Xiang Liu, whatever is going on between them that neither addresses. Same with her problems with Jing that may have been avoided had she put more effort into it initially.Up next in the world of Lost You Forever is the percolating next steps between Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing. Zhuan Xu isn\u2019t content to just rule over 2/3rd of the world, and truth be told his ambitions may actually benefit the people more than divided rule. While Zhuan Xu can, and does make the hard decisions, Xiao Yao has always s.h.i.+ed away from that. Moreover she places family above anything else, and definitively about kingdom and country when those things kept her parents apart and ruined her hopes for a warm loving childhood. With that said, everyone could see this cataclysmic day coming from a mile away except for the girl who just wants to live an ordinary boring life.Chapter 38 \u2013 Armed Conflict Closer, No Hope in Sight:Spring was late coming this year and even late into the fourth month there were still lots of snowy patches on Xiao Yue\u00a0Peak.That was good for Xiao Yao because she liked to bury fruit wine in the snow and take it out during dinner to drink. It tasted even better then using mystical power to quickly freeze the wine.Even though Xiao Yao had her own palace, most of the time she spent in the medicine valley or with Yin seeing patients in the clinic.Xiao Yao and Yin practiced medicine vastly differently and often\u00a0b.u.t.ted heads\u00a0over how to prescribe medicine leading to sign language fights.One day Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t convince Yin and was so frustrated she got the Yellow Emperor involved to judge.\u201cI concede Yin\u2019s prescription isn\u2019t wrong and has very good effect but this particular patient lives by the lake and the medicine I prescribe grows by water. If he\u2019s lucky he can find some by the lake and if not it won\u2019t cost much to buy it near where he lives. But Yin\u2019s medicine grows in the deep mountain and doesn\u2019t grow where he lives. It will cost a lot for him to buy it.\u201dYin signed to to the Yellow Emperor and Xiao Yao translated \u201cTo treat a patient the first priority is finding the best medicine to cure the illness. Xiao Yao\u2019s medicine is slow working and eating it will cause the patient to lose his appet.i.te.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cYou are both right but at this point deciding the right medicine isn\u2019t based on either of your medical skill but based on the patient\u2019s family situation. If he\u2019s rich then use Yin\u2019s prescription for the best medicine, if he\u2019s poor then use Xiao Yao\u2019s prescription since the family livelihood is just as important as the patient\u2019s illness. You can\u2019t cure the patient and cause him to starve to death.\u201dYin thought about it and agreed with the Yellow Emperor: All my patients are n.o.bles so I have never taken into consideration whether the patient can afford the medicine.Xiao Yao quickly added \u201cAnd I put too much emphasis on the ease of getting the medicine locally.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cCuring an illness isn\u2019t limited to one prescription either. If the patient lived near the mountains then Yin\u2019s prescription would be cheaper than Xiao Yao\u2019s.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYes, and that is why medicine isn\u2019t limited to the wealth of the family but also where they live. Years ago in Gao Xing when I opened a clinic a lot of patients were fishermen and the prescriptions I gave based on the Sheng Nong Herb Manual were good but were Middle Plains plants that the fishermen were not familiar with nor could they afford it. Later I tried using local plants and my prescriptions were much better received.\u201dYin was incredulous: People dared to find fault with the prescription gleaned from the Sheng Nong Herb Manual!The Yellow Emperor said \u201cIn the vast wilderness all the environment and climate are different and one Sheng Nong Herb Manual is not enough, not anywhere enough! You two want to write ten more manuals to supplement it?\u201dXiao Yao and Yin stared at the Yellow Emperor and Yin signed \u201cNot possible, it\u2019s impossible since in the last ten thousands of years there has only been one Sheng Nong Herb Manual!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt\u2019s too hard, it\u2019s not doable!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor spent his life conquering from North to South and created countless legendary miracles in his lifetime so in his mind there was no \u201cimpossible\u201d. He said \u201cI asked you two if this task was worth doing, not whether it was easy to do.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s possible to create a herb manual from all parts of the vast wilderness then it\u2019s not just something worth doing it\u2019s one of the most amazing things ever! It would benefit the people of the entire world and all their future generations. Every single person!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor pushed \u201cIf you are certain of the value in doing it then why not undertake the task? One word \u201cimpossible\u201d and you don\u2019t dare try?\u201dYin and Xiao Yao grimaced, not everyone was the Yellow Emperor daring to do things no one dared, daring to think things no one dared. Xiao Yao thought and said with certainty \u201cAs much as can be done then. Even if it\u2019s another hundred remedies then there will be people who benefit from just another hundred more.\u201dYin nodded: Even ten more herbs it will be beneficial.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cGood!\u201dThat night the Yellow Emperor told Zhuan Xu that he decided to organize the writing of a new medical text and wanted his full a.s.sistance.Since the Yellow Emperor abdicated he never asked Zhuan Xu for anything and this was the first time so Zhuan Xu immediately agreed.The Yellow Emperor summoned a group of doctors over from Xuan Yuan and picked twenty of the best to bring to Xiao Yue Peak.Yin and Xiao Yao started to prepare writing another medical text.Xiao Yao was so busy with the medical text discussion with the doctors she didn\u2019t notice that it was particularly busy on Zhi Jin Summit and Zhuan Xu\u2019s residential palace Qian Yang Palace was brightly lit day and night with powerful officials coming in and out. It had been two months since Zhuan Xu visited any of his consorts.But no matter how busy or tired every single day Zhuan Xu would go to Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0to greet the Yellow Emperor.The officials and consorts chalked this up as \u201cthe Black Emperor is so filial\u201d but in the eyes of Empress Xing Yue there was another meaning behind it and that meaning caused her to be sleepless every night and had no appet.i.te. She sometimes thought only she saw through Zhuan Xu and knew his secret, but then she sometimes chided herself for making something out of nothing.As summer approached the female Xuan Yuan Commander\u00a0Chi Sui Xian led a night attack on a Gao Xing barracks south of Chi Sui and successfully conquered it. It was like a dagger deep into Gao Xing by ensuring that even if the Xuan Yuan forces attacked deep into Gao Xing it would never risk having its supplies cut off because this river territory was now under Xuan Yuan control.The Black Emperor named Chi Sui Feng Long as the Great General of the Xuan Yuan army and dispatched him to lead thirty thousand troops to attack Gao Xing.It had been tens of thousands of years since Gao Xing fought a war. The Gao Xing army was like a rusty sword sheathed too long and even the most impressive weapon was now dull after too long since being sharpened. The Xuan Yuan army was different, since the forming of the Xuan Yuan kingdom the army never stopped fighting and had spent the last thousands of years in battle. It was as ferocious as a attacking tiger, as tough as forged stone. The Xuan Yuan front line army was led by General Yu Jiang who came from Gao Xing\u2019s Yi He tribe. He was a water power and familiar with water battles as well as Gao Xing territory and climate. Under his charge within three days Xuan Yuan had conquered two Gao Xing castles.Faced with such a colossal event the entire vast wilderness was in stunned shock.Only Xiao Yao on top of Xiao Yue Peak remained in the dark about what was happening. She only noticed that the doctors seemed to be chatting less and often zoning out while working.Jing came to visit Xiao Yao on Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0and Xiao Yao asked him \u201cDid Zhuan Xu forget to pay the doctors? I feel their hearts are not really into doing their jobs!\u201dJing was about to respond when the Yellow Emperor coughed. Jing said nothing but directly stared back at the Yellow Emperor and didn\u2019t look cowed in the least.Xiao Yao stared at the Yellow Emperor and then at Jing and noticed for the first time that Jing\u2019s aura was not weaker than the Yellow Emperor at all. She suddenly jumped in front of the Yellow Emperor and blocked him from Jing before making a funny face \u201cGrandfather, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cGirls, when you grow up you always side with your man!\u201d The Yellow Emperor shook his head \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You go ask Zhuan Xu since neither Jing nor I want to be blamed for being loose lipped.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and pushed the Yellow Emperor to sit down \u201cYou play a go match with Jing and I\u2019ll brew tea for you guys.\u201d She grabbed the tea set and went to the kitchen to work seeming like nothing was wrong.When the sun was setting Xiao Yao said to Miao Pu \u201cGo to Zhi Jin Palace and tell His majesty that I\u2019m cooking dinner personally so if he has time come dine with us.\u201dA half hour later Zhuan Xu arrived and saw the table was still empty and Xiao Yao was plucking herbs. He smiled \u201cAren\u2019t you cooking? Where\u2019s the food?\u201dXiao Yao slowly wiped her hands \u201cJust waiting for you to arrive.\u201dServants walked in with four charcoal grill platters and placed one on each dining table. They then brought out all the meat that Xiao Yao already marinated \u2013 lamb chops, venison, and rabbit.Xiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cOther than meat there are fresh vegetables gathered today in the valley. Grill the leaves and the stem can be used to make soup to drink afterwards to cut down the oiliness of the meat\u201dThe Yellow Emperor, Jing, and Zhuan Xu all sat down before their own table and Xiao Yao placed the herbs she was plucking earlier on plates for them to use as dipping sauces.Zhuan Xu sniffed and immediately placed meat on the grill \u201cLast time we grilled our own meat was the lantern festival last year. It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve eaten wild vegetables. Every spring it crosses my mind but then I get busy and forget.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cWild vegetables have more bitterness and most people aren\u2019t used to it but once one gets used to it then it\u2019s tasty. I figured you guys all tried it before so prepared it today.\u201d When the Yellow Emperor was young he barely had enough to eat so he ate more than his share of wild vegetables. Zhuan Xu was a market hooligan and often ate wild vegetables with rice. When Jing was in Qing Shui Town every spring Lao Mu would buy wild vegetables to save money so Jing got used to it as well.This meal took a good hour to finish and afterwards Jing and the Yellow Emperor resumed their unfinished go match.Xiao Yao laid on the pallet with a wine cask in hand and two gla.s.s chalices. Zhuan Xu took one over and Xiao Yao poured him the purple reddish mulberry wine. It was iced cold so the gla.s.s chalice was soon frosted over.Zhuan Xu took a sip \u201cSealed in snow? It\u2019s better than frozen with ice powers.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cOf course.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI hear from Yin that since coming back from your trip last year you\u2019ve been collecting books and information on voodoo.\u201d\u201cI visited Jiu Li so it\u2019s natural to be interested in voodoo.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao \u201cHow\u2019s your health these days?\u201d\u201cUnder your orders Yin gives me an annual check up. Doesn\u2019t he report to you?\u201d\u201cHe tells me you\u2019re fine but how do you feel?\u201d\u201cI feel fine.\u201d\u201cDid you break the voodoo bug linking you with Xiang Liu?\u201d\u201cMore or less!\u201d Having one Jing worried about it was enough, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want Zhuan Xu also worried.\u201cWhat do you mean more or less?\u201d\u201cI raised the bug and planted it. What are you worried about? Are you worried I\u2019ll die because of my own bug? I think you\u2019ve been listening to too many rumors. Voodoo isn\u2019t that scary and even if you don\u2019t believe me you should believe in the Jiu Li tribe.\u201dZhuan Xu \u201cIt\u2019s Xiang Liu I don\u2019t trust. You be careful and if Xiang Liu comes to see you tell me immediately.\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cYessir, Your majesty!\u201dZhuan Xu moved to smack her and Xiao Yao ducked and his hand was very gentle to begin with so he ended up combing his fingers through her hair in a gesture that was tender and longing.Xiao Yao sipped her wine \u201cGrandfather, Jing, and those doctors here, everyone is being weird. What\u2019s going on outside?\u201dZhuan Xu played with his chalice and said nothing as he stared at the wine colors reflecting in the gla.s.s.Xiao Yao said \u201cIf I head down the mountain I\u2019ll know everything so I just want to hear it from you.\u201dZhuan Xu gulped down all the wine in his gla.s.s and sat up straight on the pallet. He stared at Xiao Yao and said \u201cI gave the order to attack Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s smile froze. She had thought Zhuan Xu did something because of her real birth ident.i.ty but who knew\u2026.Xiao Yao thought she heard wrong \u201cZhuan Xu, repeat that again.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI gave the order to attack Gao Xing.\u201dXiao Yao bolted up and threw the gla.s.s chalice in her hand at Zhuan Xu\u2019s head.The gla.s.s chalice struck Zhuan Xu\u2019s head hard and the purple red wine splashed all over his hair and face.Xiao Yao turned and ran off and Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t even bother to wipe his face before bolting after Xiao Yao.The Yellow Emperor and Jing both heard the noise and looked over. Jing was about to get up but the Yellow Emperor grabbed him and shoved him into a room and ordered the servant to close all doors and windows.Xiao Yao ran into her room and slammed the door hard in Zhuan Xu\u2019s face. Zhuan Xu pounded on the door \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao used her back to keep the door closed and refused to let Zhuan Xu in.\u201cXiao Yao, listen to me.\u201d\u201cListen to you what? Are you going to say that when our four uncles was trying to kill you back then you ran to Gao Xing and it was the Grand Emperor who took you in? Are you going to say that he took you as a disciple to teach you the zither, to govern, to train your secret guards?\u201d\u201cXiao Yao, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what? Tell me what! Did I say anything that wasn\u2019t true?\u201d\u201cWhat you just said is all true but there is a lot more you don\u2019t know. If it wasn\u2019t for him then I wouldn\u2019t even be an orphan in the first place, why would I need him to take me in? You also wouldn\u2019t have needed to wander the world alone for three hundred years.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cWhen Auntie told you about the past she must have been very detailed in telling you all about your real daddy. But she must have said nothing about what happened in the past with the Grand Emperor, right? Maybe Auntie already forgave him or maybe Auntie wanted to protect you and not let you know.\u201d\u201cWhat past things? What are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cDo you know why our Eldest Uncle was mistakenly kill by your real daddy?\u201d\u201cMom said Eldest Uncle wanted to force Grandfather to abdicate so he had Mom concoct a potion for him that would cause a G.o.d to be unable to use his powers for a few months. Who knew Eldest Uncle would accidentally drink the potion himself and that is why he couldn\u2019t protect himself against my daddy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Eldest Uncle who wanted Grandfather to abdicate. It was Master who convinced Eldest Uncle to do that! He also was the one who got Auntie to make the potion and he handed it to Eldest Uncle. When Auntie was making the potion she didn\u2019t know Eldest Uncle was going to use it. That was a potion that Auntie made for Master so that he could successfully force the former\u00a0Grand Emperor to abdicate. When the former\u00a0Grand Emperor was forcefully locked up in his palace and then mysteriously died, do you know why there was the Five Prince Rebellion afterwards? Or why Master used such a b.l.o.o.d.y approach to deal with his own brothers? Now there is no talk about how Master become the Grand Emperor but Xiao Yao, back then you lived on Five G.o.ds Mountain so look deep into your own memory. You must still remember the former\u00a0Grand Emperor, the one you called grandfather as well. He was murdered by Master! That is why the Five Princes revolted!\u201dXiao Yao wanted to deny it that but the broken memory fragments in her mind confirmed for her that what Zhuan Xu said was true. She remember the former Grand Emperor that she used to call grandfather. She actually witnessed the moment he died and she remembered that her mom tearfully slapped her dad hard afterwards.Zhuan Xu sorrowfully continued \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Master then our Eldest Uncle would not have died. If Eldest Uncle didn\u2019t die, then the chasm between your mom and real daddy wouldn\u2019t have been so impossible to bridge!\u201dXiao Yao leaned against the door and wearily said \u201cIt\u2019s not all dad\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cThen what about my dad! When Auntie discovered Zhu Rong\u2019s nefarious plan and went first to beg Master to help her, it was Master who denied Auntie!\u201d Xiao Yao shook her head and yelled \u201cNo! That\u2019s impossible!\u201d That was the dad who loved and adored her, the dad who tirelessly taught Zhuan Xu everything.How could he have said no to Mom\u2019s entreaty to go save her Fourth Uncle? But then he was indeed the same Grand Emperor who brutally killed his own five brothers!Zhuan Xu said \u201cWhen you were small, didn\u2019t you ask Auntie why she was missing one finger all of a sudden? Didn\u2019t Auntie tell you that she accidentally misplaced it? You know that Master always wears a white bone ring on his left pinky, right? Do you know what that ring is made from? That\u2019s Auntie\u2019s finger! When she was crying and begging on her hands and knees for Master to save my dad, she severed her own finger to made a blood oath to him. But he still\u2026..said no!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s raspy voice said each word clearly \u201cXiao Yao, He. Said. No!\u201dXiao Yao tightly clasped her hand over her mouth and sank into the ground. She remembered the day when she discovered her mom had only four fingers left on one hand, she asked why mom was missing a finger. Her mom said she accidentally lost it. She asked her mom if it hurt? Her mom said \u201d No, it doesn\u2019t hurt. The persons who are hurting the most right now are your Fourth Auntie and Zhuan Xu gege. Xiao Yao be good and spend more time with your Gege.\u201dIf her Fourth Uncle didn\u2019t die, then her Fourth Auntie wouldn\u2019t have committed suicide. Then her Grandmother\u2019s illness wouldn\u2019t have taken a turn for the worse. Then her Mom wouldn\u2019t have needed to go to battle\u2026.. Maybe, just maybe everything would be different now\u2026.Zhuan Xu added \u201cAnd your real daddy! Even now the world continues to marvel at Qi Yo\u2019s subordinates, the two most capable were Feng Bo (Uncle Wind) and Yu s.h.i.+ (Teacher Rain). Do you know who Yu s.h.i.+\u2019s real ident.i.ty was? He had another name, his real name was Yi He Nuo Nai. Now no one knows anymore, but thousands of years ago he was a very well known handsome powerful young Gao Xing n.o.ble who was also the Great General of Gao Xing\u2019s Yi He tribe. He was also Master\u2019s dearest friend since childhood. So much time has pa.s.sed now that no one remembers anymore and I can\u2019t discover what Yu s.h.i.+ was actually doing working for Qi Yo. But do you think that Master would send one of his best friends to your daddy\u2019s side for no reason whatsoever? Yes, maybe you\u2019re right and we can\u2019t blame everything on Master. But Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026every time I think about how my Dad didn\u2019t need, to die, my Mom didn\u2019t need to commit suicide in front of me. Our Grandmother could have lived a few more years. Auntie didn\u2019t need to go to the battlefield. You didn\u2019t need to leave my side. I\u2026\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s breathing was labored \u201cI really can\u2019t treat him as just my respected Master!\u201dXiao Yao kept her eyes shut and felt her throat constricting so she couldn\u2019t breath anymore.Zhuan Xu said \u201cMaster always told me \u2018You don\u2019t need to feel grat.i.tude towards me, this is what I owe Qing Yang, Ah Heng, and your dad.\u2019 I never took what he said seriously and thought he was just being modest. Until I discovered the truth and now I know, Master was completely truthful to me!\u201dXiao Yao remembered that on the Chi Sui river when she thanked her dad for saving her in the desert, he also said very clearly to her \u201cThis is what I owe Qing Yang, Chang Yi, and your mom.\u201d\u201cXiao Yao, I haven\u2019t forgotten that he\u2019s my Master, but I also can\u2019t forget\u2026..Xiao Yao, do you remember the dagger?\u201d\u201cThe dagger that Fourth Auntie used to commit suicide?\u201d That dagger that gave Zhuan Xu nightmares every night, yet he insisted on wearing it daily.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhuan Xu scoffed \u201cThat dagger was hand forged by Master and given to my parents as a wedding gift. Mom chose that very dagger to commit suicide. When Mom died, she must have hated Master so much.\u201d\u201cAre you invading Gao Xing because you hate him?\u201d\u201cNo! Towards him I feel both love and hate. But he is the Gao Xing Grand Emperor and I am the Xuan Yuan Black Emperor. My decision is based solely as a ruler.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBut in Gao Xing there are the guys you grew up with, Ru So and Ju Mang, and the Ah Nian you watched come into this world\u2026..Zhuan Xu, have you not thought about how they feel?\u201d\u201cRu So and Ju Mang are men and even if they oppose me they will understand my decision. Ah Nian\u2026..likely will hate me. Xiao Yao, I didn\u2019t think about how they would feel nor do I care. But I will accept all the consequences to come!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t care about how we feel then you leave. I don\u2019t want to see you! In the future you\u2019re not welcome at Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0either!\u201d Xiao Yao ran into the inner room and flopped on her pallet before pulling the blanket tightly over her head.\u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu pounded on the door but heard silence back from inside the room. He could have broken down the door easily with his power but he didn\u2019t force his way inside.Zhuan Xu\u2019s forehead wearily leaned against the door \u201cI care about what you think!\u201d That\u2019s why a war that should have began three years ago got delayed time and again until now. That\u2019s why he was willing to alert the Grand Emperor to his war intentions and sever Xiao Yao\u2019s connection with him as father-daughter first.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t dare go in but he also didn\u2019t bear to leave. He leaned against the door and sat down on the ground, staring in desolation into the dark night.He had a plan and a strategy for everything but right now his mind was blank. He could think of nothing so instead he remembered a time long ago\u2026\u2026When he met Xiao Yao for the first time, they didn\u2019t get along at all. He was a boy but he couldn\u2019t beat the rough and tumble Xiao Yao in a fight. He even tried to be sly and find a way to get rid of her. But gradually the two of them played together and when his parents both died it was Xiao Yao who kept him company every night. When he had nightmares it was Xiao Yao who kissed him on the forehead and vowed \u201cI will be with you forever.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe her \u201cYou\u2019ll get married eventually and leave me.\u201d She hurriedly said \u201cI won\u2019t marry anyone else, I will marry you and never leave you.\u201dFrom Five G.o.ds Mountain to Xuan Yuan Mountain, from Xuan Yuan Mountain to Sheng Nong Mountain, Xiao Yao accompanied him each step of the way. No matter what happened, no matter what state he was in, she resolutely stood beside him. When Yu Jiang tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate him, it was Xiao Yao who used her body to s.h.i.+eld him. When he was in the hidden chamber detoxing from the drugs, it was Xiao Yao who endured the agony with him and was willing to be injured but wouldn\u2019t use Jin Xuan\u2019s suggestion to tie him up. She knew that if she suggested it then he would do it\u2026..Late into the night, Xiao Yao figured Zhuan Xu left already and pushed open the door to look out at the moon.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t know what she was thinking about. Was she thinking about her childhood on Five G.o.ds Mountain?The two of them, one sitting on the ground against the door, the other perched on the window, they were mere feet from each other as they stared at the moon together all night.When a ray of light emerged from the East, Xiao Xiao appeared in the fog and knelt down in front of the doorXiao Yao thought Xiao Xiao was kneeling towards her and gestured for her to get up but instead heard Xiao Xiao say \u201cYour majesty, please return to Zhi Jin Summit. The officials and ministers will be arriving soon.\u201dXiao Yao was stunned and she saw in the corner of her eye Zhuan Xu appear.He sat outside the door all night long? Xiao Yao lowered her head and wouldn\u2019t look at him.Zhuan Xu also didn\u2019t saw anything and was about to vault on his winged ride when Xiao Xiao stopped him \u201cYour majesty, please wash your face first.\u201dXiao Yao looked up and Zhuan Xu looked back and in that moment their eyes met and both were shocked.Last night Xiao Yao broke a chalice of wine on Zhuan Xu\u2019s head and he hastily wiped before running after her so he didn\u2019t clean himself up. His face was streaked in red and white in a big mess and he actually forgot about it and was planning to return to Zhi Jin Palace like this. If the servants saw him then there would be a giant freak out.Xiao Yao opened her door and said to Xiao Xiao \u201cHis majesty can wash up in the restroom.\u201dBefore Xiao Xiao could answer Zhuan Xu strode inside as if afraid Xiao Yao would change her mind.Xiao Yao took out Zhuan Xu\u2019s old clothes from her closet and handed it to Xiao Xiao. Zhuan Xu quickly washed up and changed, putting medicine on his bruise, before walking out.Xiao Yao was in the courtyard and heard his footstep and looked over. Zhuan Xu had a bright purple bruise on his forehead that came from the gla.s.s striking him. Earlier there was wine streaks on his face so no one saw it but after he was cleaned up the bruise was especially noticeable.Last night Xiao Yao was so angry she used her full strength when she tossed it at Zhuan Xu. He must have bled a lot and even though the wound was patched up with spiritual powers it could only heal the wound but could not remove the bruising.Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cNo worries, it\u2019ll be gone in two days.\u201dXiao Yao lowered her head and walked past Zhuan Xu to enter the house.Zhuan Xu stood there for awhile longer before getting on his winged ride and flying towards Zhi Jin Palace.Zhuan Xu\u2019s forehead bruise naturally caused all his consorts and servants to fret over him and led to his ministers and officials mumuring about what happened.Zhuan Xu said nothing and no one dared to ask him. Everyone tried to find out from his guards and Xiao Xiao claimed that he was napping at the desk and accidentally hit his head. Everyone knew how tirelessly Zhuan Xu worked especially lately so accepted that. Only Empress Xing Yue didn\u2019t believe it, but if she didn\u2019t believe then then her guess of the real reason was even more terrifying so she chose to believe it in the end.The Yellow Emperor walked out of his chamber and saw Jing sitting on the pallet having not touched his bedding last night but the go board pieces had been moved. Clearly he didn\u2019t sleep last night and was playing against himself.The Yellow Emperor looked at the board and gently said \u201cZhuan Xu is the Emperor, he may allow Xiao Yao to toss a gla.s.s of wine at his head and beg for her forgiveness, but he would never allow an outsider to see him in such a low state. Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao have been through much difficulty in their youth so between them most of the time everyone is an outsider, including myself.\u201dJing stood up and bowed \u201cI understand. Thank you for the concern, Your majesty.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou are a very smart young man, remember that a harder steel is easier to break.\u201dJing replied \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled \u201cGo check on Xiao Yao now! Then let\u2019s breakfast together.\u201dXiao Yao was bathed and brus.h.i.+ng her hair by the window when she saw Jing walk towards her from the canyon. His one hand was behind his back and he strode forward until he was standing before her window.Xiao Yao saw his clothes was still what he wore yesterday \u201cLast night\u2026..where did you sleep?\u201d\u201cI slept in the Yellow Emperor\u2019s chambers for the night.\u201d Jing handed a bouquet of blue baby\u2019s breath to Xiao Yao and the tender leaves still had morning dew on it.Xiao Yao lowered her head to sniff and marveled \u201cSo fragrant!\u201dShe put down the hair pin in her hand and pointed to her hair before turning around and lowering her head.Jing picked a long strand and threaded it through her hair.\u201cDone?\u201dXiao Yao picked up the mirror and saw the blue baby\u2019s breath wound through her hair in a half braid like a crescent moon. Even the most precious and expensive bauble in the world could not have such rousing scent.Xiao Yao put down the mirror and said \u201cThank you, not just for the flower but also\u2026..for all the trouble I bring you.\u201dJing lightly flicked Xiao Yao on the forehead \u201cWho said to me that two people have to walk a lifetime together so we have to watch out for each other?\u201dXiao Yao lowered her head dejectedly \u201cJing, whatever shall I do?\u201d\u201cDo you have the confidence to get the Black Emperor to withdraw his troops?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head. She knew Zhuan Xu too well, whatever he wanted no one could stop him.\u201cDo you want to stand with Gao Xing and fight back against Xuan Yuan?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cI only know medicine and poisons, what ability do I have? Plus I may hate what Zhuan Xu is doing but I will never help others against Zhuan Xu.\u201d\u201cXiao Yao, this is between two Emperors so there is nothing you can do.\u201d\u201cBut they are the dearest people in my life. Shall I just dispa.s.sionately watch from the sidelines?\u201d\u201cYou are not dispa.s.sionately watching, you are painfully watching.\u201d\u201cTu Shan Jing!\u201d Xiao Yao glared at him \u201cYou have the mind to tease me? Don\u2019t you know I spent all last night thinking about this?\u201dJing pinched Xiao Yao\u2019s cheek \u201cDon\u2019t think of the worst outcome when nothing is decided yet. This war will take ten or twenty years at least. Xuan Yuan is not the same as it was before and the Grand Emperor is not like Qi Yi was back then.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor called from the door \u201cYou two want breakfast or to keep talking through the window?\u201dXiao Yao was embarra.s.sed and yelled \u201cBreakfast!\u201dAfter breakfast Jing left the mountain leaving Xiao Yao sitting in a daze in the corridor while the Yellow Emperor paid her no heed.Xiao Yao sat until it was noon when she suddenly got up and grabbed her arrow to go practice archery for two hours. After that she was exhausted and crawled into bed and immediately fell asleep.When Zhuan Xu arrived later that night Xiao Yao was still asleep so he dined with the Yellow Emperor and then left.Xiao Yao slept until dawn the next morning and told Miao Pu that she wanted to dine in her own court residence today and from now on as well.Every day when Zhuan Xu came he didn\u2019t see Xiao Yao but he didn\u2019t look angry or sad and instead was just like always, chatting and dining with the Yellow Emperor before leaving.The Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing was was like Jing expected, it was impossible to see a victor within a short span of time.When Zhuan Xu deployed the troops, he issued a decree to the entire world that no common citizens would be harmed or hurt. Initially the Xuan Yuan army had the advantage but as they got deeper into Gao Xing territory they encountered fierce opposition from the Gao Xing people. Whether it was Feng Long, Yu Jiang, or Xian\u2019s tens of thousands of top notch troops, everyone was under orders not to hurt the Gao Xing people so their earlier advantage was quickly gone.Zhuan Xu was clearly prepared for a long haul war and ordered Feng Long already so Feng Long did not push his troops deeper and instead settled down in the castle already conquered and got ready to manage it.Summer was monsoon season in Gao Xing and flooding was expected. Feng Long grew up by the water so he knew the devastation of when the flood waters broke through dams and barriers to destroy a village instantaneously. Under his grandfather\u2019s tutelage he learned how to fortify dams and dig trenches to redirect the water so he brought his best men from Chi Sui over to help protect the castle along with the Xuan Yuan soldiers. Initially the Gao Xing citizens were resentful and angry but the Xuan Yuan soldiers never hurt or killed people or burned and looted, plus they worked hard and the only difficulty was the language barrier otherwise everyone got along well. Seeing the flood season was about to come, the Gao Xing people gradually accepted the help of the Xuan Yuan soldiers to protect their homes.The Xuan Yuan army was able to keep getting a steady stream of supplies because of its water edge location so the Gao Xing army could not easily win back the taken territory. But venturing further South with the humid temperatures caused the Northern Xuan Yuan soldiers to be unaccustomed to the climate so Feng Long could not easily continue his battle attack. Just like that the two sides settled into a stalemate.Xiao Yao avoided Zhuan Xu but could not avoid the war going on in the outside world. She knew there was nothing she could do by avoiding hearing about what was happening so would ask Jing \u201cWhere is Feng Long now, has there been another big battle?\u201dJing teased her \u201cIf you keep asking about Feng Long then if someone heard they would think you regretted being a runaway bride and is totally worried about him.\u201dXiao Yao was so frustrated and amused with his teasing and was about to shut his lips but he kept avoiding her and teasing some more \u201cNow Feng Long is a Great General and his future is unlimited bright, way more successful then me simply being a clan leader. Tell me the honest truth, do you regret it even a little? Feng Long doesn\u2019t have a wife yet so if you regret it then it\u2019s still not too late.\u201dXiao Yao was so exasperated and yelled \u201cI heard that before the Young Master of Qing Qiu was so quick witted and glib, I just thought they were all being mean to you! Now I totally regret it but its not because Feng Long has unlimited potential but because you\u2019re a super meanie!\u201dJing scooted next to Xiao Yao \u201cWhat would make me a nice guy then? I let you hit me?\u201dXiao Yao lifted her head and huffed \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it anymore!\u201dJing stuck his head in front of Xiao Yao \u201cHow about hit me twice?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Xiao Yao turned her head again.\u201cThree times?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor\u2019s laughter rang out and Xiao Yao and Jing quickly moved apart a few inches. The Yellow Emperor lightly coughed and said \u201cI came to get a drink of water, you two continue on teasing each other.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s teasing with him! He\u2019s being mean to me!\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s face was bright red as she ran to pour a cup of water to hand to the Yellow Emperor.The Yellow Emperor stared at Xiao Yao and laughed \u201cI think he\u2019s being mean for good reason. When Jing\u2019s not around you\u2019re all zoned out but when he\u2019s here then you get mad and perk up again.\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Jing and said nothing.As the Summer head towards the end, Gao Xing entered its rainy season which meant for the Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing armies a temporary halt to the war. For Jing it meant that the one year memorial for his \u201cdead wife\u201d was now over and based on custom he could remarry again.One afternoon Jing came to Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0and said to Xiao Yao \u201cLet\u2019s go out for a walk.\u201dXiao Yao was working on her medical text notes and said \u201cSure!\u201dXiao Yao followed Jing out of the medicine valley and he summoned his crane winged ride and they got on.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cI thought we would stay on Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0for a walk, so where are you taking me?\u201dJing smiled and said nothing as the crane took them deep into the clouds.After some time Xiao Yao saw a peak appear and the crane descended next to a small pond. Xiao Yao got off and looked towards the hut in the distance \u201cSometimes I think life is fated.\u201dJing took her hand and sat her down \u201cI want to discuss something with you.\u201dXiao Yao reached down to play with the water and said \u201cTell me!\u201d\u201cThere is a ballad that says \u201ca beautiful young lady, a gentleman will pursue.\u201d Every young man knows what this lyric means and will wonder about what their future wife will be like. When I was young I thought she would be a beauty like the moon and flowers, refined and calm, excel at all the arts, not talk too much or too little, know how to manage a household and also run a business so that she can discuss my work with me\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao compared herself to each description and her expression got progressively more and more sullen.\u201cWhen my mom was picking my bride and asked me what I wanted, I told all of that to her.\u201dXiao Yao wondered \u201cAnd your mom didn\u2019t say you were asking for too much?\u201dJing laughed \u201cMy mom said none of what I wanted was hard to find. Other than looks being given by birth, the rest all the ladies in the high families would be trained to be such. The only thing that is hard to gauge is whether she will really love me.\u201dXiao Yao was quiet and realized he was right, he wanted a lot but for him it wasn\u2019t hard to find. He just wanted someone who could understand and share in his life interests, not requiring that she be as talented and successful as him.Jing continued \u201cBut who knew\u2026..that I would meet you!\u201dXiao Yao scrunched up her nose \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with meeting me! I don\u2019t have epic beautiful looks, I\u2019m not refined and demure, I know zilch about the feminine arts, I do know how to poison people to death and can talk a lot. I don\u2019t know how to dress myself up or how to manage a household or how to socialize for business\u2026..\u201dJing nodded \u201cYes, you are all of those things!\u201dXiao Yao glared at him with her fist clenched.Jing continued \u201cBut when I met you was when I realized that when a person fell in love then nothing mattered about requirements.\u201d Jing tenderly smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cYou\u2019re not quiet but I\u2019m plenty quiet enough and can use someone as talkative as you; you\u2019re not refined and demure and constantly want to thwack me, but when you wash my hair and feed me medicine you are exquisitely gentle; you don\u2019t know the arts but I do and I can show them off to entertain you; you can\u2019t embroider but I\u2019m not marrying a seamstress and I can buy the talents of the best seamstress around; you don\u2019t know business but I do and I can make more than enough to take care of you; with how chatty you are, even in another thousand years we won\u2019t run out of things to discuss; you\u2019re not needed to run the household and you hate socializing which is fine by me because I would love to hide you deep inside my residence so that no one can see you and try to s.n.a.t.c.h you from me\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s expression got brighter and she stared at Jing.Jing smiled \u201cXiao Yao, you were right in saying you\u2019re not an epic beauty. You are\u2026\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s nose twitched and Jing lightly tapped her on the nose \u201cEven if the world was extraordinary it would not hold a candle to your one smile.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face turned bright red and she stood up to leave \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you today! Talking about all these random things!\u201dJing grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and she suddenly realized a thick fog surrounded them. Within the fog a series of peach blossom trees sprung up and soon they were surrounded by thousands and thousands of peach blossoms all around them.Xiao Yao knew this was a mystical illusion created by Jing but she couldn\u2019t help but reach out to catch a petal.Jing said \u201cThis place is where your daddy used to live. I brought you here today to ask you in front of your parents \u2013 Tu Shan Jing asks for Xi Ling Jiu Yao\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s entire body froze.Jing asked \u201cXiao Yao, will you marry me?\u201dYears ago when Xiao Yao and Feng Long were in the secret chamber and he asked, she didn\u2019t feel shy at all. But right now she felt so shy and embarra.s.sed and wanted to turn and run away. She murmured in a low voice \u201cIf you want my hand you need to ask my grandfather and Zhuan Xu.\u201d\u201cOf course I will ask them but before I do I want to ask you first. Xiao Yao, will you marry me?\u201dWithin the blanket of falling peach blossoms around her, Xiao Yao felt like she could see her mom and daddy standing together and smiling at her.\u201cI do!\u201d Xiao Yao tossed Jing\u2019s hand aside and ran into the hut with her face burning up and her heart pounding uncontrollably. She looked at herself in the mirror and she was as red as if she drank wine. She cupped her face and chided the her in the mirror \u201cYou\u2019re so hopeless!\u201dThat night when Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0and unexpectedly saw Xiao Yao he was so happy.He nodded at Jing before sitting down next to the Yellow Emperor.Jing respectfully bowed to both emperors and said \u201cI want to marry Xiao Yao, will Your majesties please grant me her hand in marriage.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s heart lurched and he stared at Xiao Yao. The last time when Feng Long asked to marry her she looked startled and unwilling but now she kept her head lowered but her face reflected her shy happiness and willingness.Zhuan Xu felt like he was sitting alone on a desolate mountaintop and his body was left there while his soul had flown away and was flying through time and s.p.a.ce to revisit all the vivid moments from the past\u2014\u2014\u2013His childhood experiences left him maturing early. He could enjoy the pleasures of life but he never once felt his heart truly stir. When he was teased about what kind of woman he wanted, he would always remember when Xiao Yao was small and she hugged him while promising \u201cI will never marry someone else. I will marry you and be with you forever!\u201dWhen he came back from Jade Mountain with Xiao Yao, that night he tossed and turned unable to sleep. All he could see was Xiao Yao, when she was small and her now, Xiao Yao as a man and Xiao Yao turned back into a woman. It didn\u2019t matter which Xiao Yao, she always made his heart happy and his heart hurt. He wasn\u2019t a clueless green boy, he knew what\u00a0changed in\u00a0the way he felt about her.But\u2026.what could he do? A man who was sleeping in quarters that was given to him, what right did he have? One slip and he could be a.s.sa.s.sinated, what right did he have?He remembered vividly when Auntie was taking Xiao Yao to Jade Mountain and he begged her to leave Xiao Yao with him \u201cI will take care of Xiao Yao, I\u2019m not worried about the hard work\u201d but his Auntie smiled \u201cBut you don\u2019t even have the power to take care of yourself, you have even less ability to take care of her. Simply not being worried about it isn\u2019t enough!\u201dHe vowed to grow up as quickly as possible so he could go to Jade Mountain and pick Xiao Yao up when he could take care of her. But a few hundred years pa.s.sed and when she returned to his side, he still didn\u2019t have the power to take care of her. So he told him: you don\u2019t have the right because you can\u2019t even protect her!Back then Xiao Yao hadn\u2019t yet fallen for Jing and she was completely unmoved by Feng Long. But because those two men, one was Tu Shan and the other Chi Sui, both had more right and ability to pursue her than he did so he took half a step back and also a half step forward to use them by allowing them to get close to Xiao Yao.In Xuan Yuan Castle when they were in constant danger, Jing came to see Xiao Yao but she actually ended it with him and refused to see him.On Xuan Yuan Mountain, it was he who stopped Xiao Yao and asked her to go see Jing. He had been shamed countless times before but never felt the shame deep down, but that time he felt gutwrenching anger and shame.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t just see Jing, she spent a night in the room with him. That night he spend in ice cold water that could not wash away the pain in his heart and could not wash away his own shame and agony. He wanted to rush inside and kick Jing out but he couldn\u2019t because in front of Cui Liang\u2019s residence it was Xiao Yao who used her body to s.h.i.+eld him from danger. So he had no right!Then he got Jing and Feng Long\u2019s support and made the most critical decision in his life to abandon Xuan Yuan Mountain for Sheng Nong Mountain. When he was pretending to be a drug addicted dissolute, part of him knew it wasn\u2019t just acting. He really was in such pain and agony and using the drugs to numb his torment. Because he knew that he wasn\u2019t just giving up on Xuan Yuan Mountain, he was giving up on his Xiao Yao!When he got to Sheng Nong Mountain he could see Xiao Yao and Jing\u2019s connection growing closer so he kept telling himself that he was just Xiao Yao\u2019s older brother! As long as the two of them stayed alive and Xiao Yao was happy then nothing else mattered!That way when Xiao Yao came back from Qing Qiu and collapsed in his arms and spit up blood, he felt a thousand knives cutting into his heart.Xiao Yao was gravely ill because of Jing and he kept vigil over her every night. When he saw her cry in her sleep, he hated the Jing who had Xiao Yao but didn\u2019t cherish her, but he hated himself even more.When the Yellow Emperor was surveying the Middle Plains and everyone was in a state of anxiety, he stood at the brink of completely success and failure and everyone kept their distance from him. But at that moment Xiao Yao agreed to marry Feng Long.Overnight the Four Great Clans all tossed their support to him. Even though Xiao Yao smiled as she said that Feng Long was the most suitable for her, he knew that if it wasn\u2019t for him then she would not have agreed to marry Feng Long even if she was heartbroken over Jing.Feng Long and Xiao Yao\u2019s wedding date was set and even if he felt a stirring beast within that was roaring to come out, he kept it in check because his grandfather counseled \u201cXiao Yao just wanted a simple uneventful life so if you use your power now to give her that then that is what\u2019s best for her.\u201dFor Xiao Yao? He tightly controlled the beast within to not let it out.On Xiao Yao\u2019s wedding day, he sat all night in the phoenix tree forest in Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0watching the phoenix flowers falling all around him. The new swing was ready but the person who was going to swing on it had left.He reminded himself over and over \u201cFeng Long was the best choice for her while he can keep watch over Xiao Yao for her entire life and ensure Feng Long never mistreated her.\u201dBut when news arrived of Xiao Yao running away at her wedding, he felt all the darkness around him lift and he burst out laughing uncontrollably in the phoenix forest.Zhuan Xu looked around with a smile as Jing and the Yellow Emperor both stared expectantly at him. Clearly the Yellow Emperor already gave his permission and all that was left was his response.Xiao Yao lifted her head and stared at him expectantly as well.Zhuan Xu said to Jing with a smile \u201cHave your clan elders bring up the marriage with the Xi Ling clan leader and settle this engagement!\u201dJing\u2019s wary heart settled down and he bowed respectfully before saying in sincerely \u201cThank you, Your majesty.\u201dAt the end of the year, the Xi Ling and Tu Shan clans jointly announced that the Tu Shan clan leader was engaged to Xi Ling Jiu Yao.The news of their engagement caused shockwaves to ripple through the vast wilderness but neither Jing nor Xiao Yao paid any heed.After the engagement talked turned to setting a wedding date.Jing wanted it as soon as possible and an elder who watched Jing grow up laughed \u201cYou\u2019ve always been calm growing up, what\u2019s the rush now?\u201dJing said \u201cOthers may think I\u2019m rus.h.i.+ng but in truth I\u2019ve waited tens of years already.\u201dThe elder knew how deeply Jing loved Xiao Yao so he stopped teasing and chuckled \u201cStill don\u2019t rush, these things can\u2019t be rushed! The wedding appears to be your second marriage so can\u2019t be more lavish than your first but can you bear it? Even if you can bear it this old man I won\u2019t agree! Forget the ceremony, we also need to remodel the residence and need at least a year. Also new furniture for the residence. Does Miss Xi Ling want a medicinal herb garden? Let\u2019s just start with tearing down and tossing away everything used by that woman and start anew with what you both life. This is a big undertaking and can\u2019t be rushed, clan leader!\u201dJing said nothing because the elder was right, a proper marriage did need all these things.The elder continued \u201cBecause clan leader cares so much for Miss Xi Ling, it\u2019s my job to remind you to not rush something that is so important and leave you with regrets later.\u201dJing nodded \u201cElder is correct.\u201dThe elder laughed \u201cBut clan leader need not worry, with our Tu Shan wealth everything will proceed as swiftly as possible so you won\u2019t need to wait too long and will still be very satisfied.\u201dJing smiled \u201cThe most important thing is that Xiao Yao likes it.\u201dThe elder laughed \u201cNo worries, I\u2019ll make sure to get a report on Miss Xi Ling\u2019s likes and dislikes.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor asked Xiao Yao on her thought for the wedding date.Xiao Yao glanced out the window at the busy doctors and said \u201cI want to have more progress on the medical text first before setting a wedding date.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor reminded her \u201cThat will take more than two or three years. Are you sure?\u201dXiao Yao nodded \u201cThe Sheng Nong Herb Manual has been in my possession for the last four hundred years and saved my life countless times. I\u2019ve never done anything for it or better said that I want to do something for the Flame Emperor who sacrificed his life to write it. The text that he used his entire life to write, I don\u2019t want to it be used by doctors simply to make money or gain fame.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cXiao Yao, you keep saying you\u2019re not like your mom but you are actually just like your mom!\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her brows \u201cI\u2019m not like her at all!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor laughed \u201cFine, you\u2019re not like her!\u201dThat night Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Peak\u00a0and heard Xiao Yao\u2019s decision on the wedding date and smiled \u201cThat works.\u201dLikely due to the engagement with Jing, Xiao Yao realized that her time on Xiao Yue\u00a0Peak\u00a0with Zhuan Xu was finite rather than forever. With the battle between Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing taking on losses for both sides but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t personally know anyone who died and she didn\u2019t find out the details of the war, she felt it so far removed from her so she stopped avoiding Zhuan Xu.The two of them resumed their old ways hanging out. Every night Zhuan Xu would come and chat happily with Xiao Yao as they hung out.The winter pa.s.sed into summer and the seasons changed quickly, before anyone realized it 8 years had pa.s.sed.Whether it was the Voodoo King or Xiao Yao, no one had discovered the way to break the Lover\u2019s Bug.Xiao Yao was a tad disappointed but not worried since the bug was in her for the last 80 some years and she was used to it.Jing was very worried and every time she failed to break the voodoo spell he couldn\u2019t conceal his disappointment.Xiao Yao giggled and a.s.sured him \u201cBeing heart connected isn\u2019t all that intimate. At most Xiang Liu feels some of my pain whereas I feel nothing from him. This doesn\u2019t count as having our hearts as one.\u201dActually Jing wasn\u2019t bothered by the hearts connected, he was worried about the life being linked. This worry was something he couldn\u2019t discuss with Xiao Yao so he continued to let her a.s.sume he was bothered by their emotional ties.One day Xiao Yao left the medical clinic and was chatting and walking with Miao Pu.It was almost dark and the street was filled with people rus.h.i.+ng home to their families. In the busy throngs Xiao Yao didn\u2019t even know why she noticed a very richly dressed man. She stared at the man but he didn\u2019t even glance at her. They pa.s.sed each other by and the man continued on his way. Xiao Yao stopped and turned back to look for him.Miao Pu asked quizzically \u201cWhat did my lady see?\u201dXiao Yao stood there in a daze before rus.h.i.+ng off after the man but with so many people on the street she couldn\u2019t find him.Miao Pu kept following and asking \u201cWhat is my lady looking for?\u201d\u201cI\u2026.I\u2026..I don\u2019t know.\u201d Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t trying to lie to Miao Pu, she really didn\u2019t know.She aimlessly wandered for some time and was about to give up when she saw a closed door in a dark alleyway with the Li Jie tribe underground casino logo.Xiao Yao walked up and knocked on the door.\u201cMy lady wants to gamble?\u201d Miao Pu asked?\u201cJust looking.\u201dThe gambling den was open only for regulars and the guard was about to shoo them away when Miao Pu flashed a badge and the guard respectfully handed them two dog faced masks and welcomed them in.It was just dark so the gambling den so there weren\u2019t a lot of people in the den yet. Xiao Yao wandered the entire place before grabbing a drink and sitting down in the corner. Miao Pu could tell Xiao Yao had something on her mind so didn\u2019t bother her and quickly stood beside her.As night fell the gambling den got busier as more and more people arrived. After sitting for who know\u2019s how long, Xiao Yao saw the richly dressed man again. He was wearing the mask but Xiao Yao immediately recognized him.Xiao Yao rushed after him through multiple rooms and corridors before she caught up to him. The man was standing next to a gla.s.s wall that the Li Jie tribe must have enchanted because on the other side was a constellation filled with shooting stars.The man said with a smile \u201cYou chased me for so long, do you want something?:Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou don\u2019t know me?\u201d\u201cShould I know you?\u201dXiao Yao took off her mask.The man stared before whistling \u201cIf I know you then I wouldn\u2019t forget you! Sorry!\u201d He turned to leave but Xiao Yao grabbed him \u201cXiang Liu! I know it\u2019s you, stop pretending!\u201dThe man wanted to shake Xiao Yao off but she was like a squid clinging onto him and refusing to let go. The man got annoyed \u201cIf you don\u2019t let go then I\u2019m going to stop being polite!\u201d\u201cGo ahead! If I hurt then you\u2019re not going to feel good either!\u201dThe richly dressed man sighed and took off his mask before turning around. With the starry sky behind him his face gradually changed to reveal his true visage.Xiao Yao stared at him before breaking into a beaming smile, the happiness lighting up her eyes.Xiang Liu wearily asked \u201cMiss Xi Ling, what do you want?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..I\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao actually didn\u2019t know what she wanted so she got tongue-tied. She finally said \u201cHelp me break the voodoo bug spell and you can pick your price!\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cHalf an hour earlier, Tu Shan Jing said the exact same thing to me.\u201d\u201cYou came here to see Jing?\u201d\u201cMore accurate to say Tu Shan Jing asked to see me to discuss business.\u201dXiao Yao understood now, Jing saw that she couldn\u2019t break the spell so went directly to Xiang Liu to discuss terms. \u201cDid you accept Jing\u2019s offer?\u201d\u201cHis offer was tempting and I very much wanted to accept but it\u2019s not that I\u2019m refusing to break the voodoo spell, I really don\u2019t know how!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying! Back then you broke it from Zhuan Xu and moved it over to you. How come you can\u2019t do it now?\u201dXiang Liu sighed loudly and shook his head \u201cYou need to ask Tu Shan Jing to teach you how to conduct business. Doing business isn\u2019t picking a fight, especially when you have something you want from the other person. You can\u2019t just accuse the other person, what you want is for me to help you and not for me to be p.i.s.sed at you.\u201dXiao Yao glared at Xiang Liu \u201cBut you\u2019re clearly lying!\u201d\u201cDo you think I would say such a lame lie? Tu Shan Jing is much smarter than you and he asked why I was able to break the spell before but not now?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe voodoo bugs are living creatures! Back then is not the same as now! You can beat a baby tiger to death but can\u2019t you win a fight with a thousand year old tiger demon?\u201dXiao Yao felt that what he was saying made sense but also this niggling sensation that he wasn\u2019t telling her the whole truth. She slowly said \u201cI can\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me then why keep asking me?\u201dXiao Yao was silent before asking \u201cDid you come to Zhi Yi just to see Jing? When are you leaving?\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t stop me then I would have left already.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly realized that she was still holding on tightly to Xiang Liu\u2019s arm and she quickly let go.\u201cWhere\u2019s Jing? Still in the gambling den?\u201dXiang Liu smirked and looked down the long corridor \u201cHe\u2019s been behind you this whole time.\u201dJing walked forward and took Xiao Yao\u2019s hand in his hand.Xiao Yao wanted to warn Xiang Liu to be careful and leave as soon as possible but now she couldn\u2019t say those words so remained silent.Xiang Liu glanced at Xiao Yao and Jing\u2019s joined hands before smiling at Jing \u201cFarewell!\u201d He turned and vanished into the darkness.Jing said to Xiao Yao \u201cI finished discussing matters with Xiang Liu and was about to part ways when I saw you were here so followed you while directing Miao Pu elsewhere.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t want to discuss Xiang Liu anymore and shook Jing\u2019s hand with a smile \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I know you\u2019re worried about me. Let\u2019s go, I haven\u2019t had dinner yet!\u201dThe two held hands and walked together and Xiao Yao said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the voodoo bug. The boat rights itself at the end and it\u2019ll be solved eventually.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Jing said yes but he was still worried. The only comfort was how close Zhuan Xu was with Xiao Yao. When the day arrived, Jing hoped that Zhuan Xu would hold back the killing blow towards Xiang Liu for Xiao Yao\u2019s sake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But one clear indicator that things are different this time around is the motivation behind it, Zhuan Xu\u2019s ambition to unite the world is like his grandfather wanted, but not with the same underlying desperation nor with the same win at all costs mentality. This war feels more like a gentlemanly skirmish and one wonders what the Grand Emperor has up his sleeve to play Zhuan Xu\u2019s war of attrition game. No matter who wins or loses, right now both Xiao Yao and Ah Nian feel like losers either way.I\u2019ve been missing bratty little Ah Nian and I didn\u2019t even realize it until she showed up in this episode. She\u2019s really grown on me probably because she\u2019s also growing herself, one of the female characters that isn\u2019t calculating and says what she thinks just like Xiao Yao. It\u2019s sad their sisterly relations.h.i.+p looks fractured now that they don\u2019t share the same dad anymore, but who\u2019s to say sisterly affection can\u2019t continue onward, especially since they are not fighting over the same guy. Speaking of which, how\u2019s Ah Nian going to reconcile the love of her life attacking her kingdom and looking to overthrow her Emperor daddy? Not exactly a guy she can marry even if Zhuan Xu wanted her, which we all know all he wants is the one girl he can\u2019t get. Oh LYF, do keep on being complicated and difficult and oh so engrossing.Chapter 39 \u2013 The Bitterness of Longing For You:The war between Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan was now going on ten years. During that time both sides had victories but Xuan Yuan was gradually gaining an advantage and very slowly encroaching into Gao Xing territory.Living in Gao Xing for so long, many Xuan Yuan soldiers learned to speak the Gao Xing language. Zhuan Xu gave strict orders not to bother the civilians and any violation would be punishable by death. The soldiers were extremely well-behaved towards the Gao Xing people and every year during high tide season the soldiers would work alongside the Gao Xing people to build dams. When there was no battles looming, the soldiers would take their instruments and travel to villages to provide impromptu performances.If there was no ongoing war, the Gao Xing people really had no reason to hate the Xuan Yuan soldiers.Towards the end of summer, Xuan Yuan attacked a critical Gao Xing castle and after four days and four nights of nonstop battling Feng Long finally lost to Ru So.Zhuan Xu heard the news and wasn\u2019t worried about the defeat at one particular castle siege but was instead worried about Feng Long. He was young and proud, born from an elite n.o.ble family with great talent and always praised to the heavens by everyone. He was unused to defeat whereas Ru So was seasoned at all types of skirmishes. Zhuan Xu was worried that this defeat would lead to Feng Long feeling doubt and pa.s.sing it on to his troops. Once the troop morale gets shaken then everything can start to fall apart.Zhuan Xu mulled it over and decided to personally pay a visit to the battlefield. Even if he did nothing, he would get raging drunk with Feng Long while cursing out Ru So and help him let out that frustration and get back on his feet.When Zhuan Xu paid a visit to Xiao Yue Peak, both Jing and Xiao Yao happened to be there.Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Yao \u201cI need to leave for some time.\u201d\u201cWhere to?\u201d\u201cTo the outside world I\u2019m going to Xuan Yuan Mountain but in reality I\u2019m going to the battlefield. It\u2019ll likely take a month.\u201dXiao Yao realized it was to Feng Long\u2019s army base and awkwardly asked \u201cAny danger?\u201d\u201cThere is always danger but I\u2019ve walked through the most difficult path already so no danger can ever be as scary.\u201dXiao Yao nodded her head \u201cOkay, you go and I\u2019ll take good care of Grandfather.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou said before that some plants only grow in Gao Xing and you can\u2019t find it here so it\u2019s hard to catalogue accurately. Do you want to go to Gao Xing with me and take a look at those local plants yourself?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Xiao Yao answered immediately.Zhuan Xu nodded his head with a smile and said to Jing \u201cI want to discuss a proposition with you. Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan products are very different and the two kingdoms never were that close so the flow of goods have been limited only to the expensive items the n.o.bles like while the common people never get to enjoy it. The free flow of trade is good for the entire vast wilderness and the Tu Shan clan businesses blanket everywhere. I want you to go with me to Gao Xing and see what\u2019s suitable for importing to the Middle Plains for trade. If possible this matter may be delegated to the Tu Shan clan in the future since trade is best left for private exchanges rather than government agents.\u201dJing glanced at Xiao Yao and smiled \u201cThis is good for the entire world and the Tu Shan clan gets a benefit from it, of course your subject I would be happy to accompany Your majesty to Gao Xing.\u201dZhuan Xu shot a glance at Xiao Yao \u201cDo you want to come along?\u201dXioa Yao was furious that Zhuan Xu already hooked her so pressed her lips together and insisted\u00a0\u201cNot going, not going, I said I\u2019m not going!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and said nothing more, calling Xiao Xiao over to have her pack with a reminder to include packing for Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao went to talk to the Yellow Emperor and acted like she heard none of that.On the departure day, Zhuan Xu sent Xiao Xiao to pick up Xiao Yao. She was long packed and climbed onboard the cloud carriage with Miao Pu.Arriving in Gao Xing, Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t hurry to the army base and instead strolled through a town with Xiao Yao and Jing.This was a private trip so there was no official bodyguards protecting them, only Xiao Xiao and her secret guards kept watch.Zhuan Xu, Jing, and Xiao Yao changed into Gao Xing clothes and both Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu spoke perfect Gao Xing dialect language while Jing easily mimicked them so walking on the streets all the vendors saw them as Gao Xing people.This castle had been conquered by Xuan Yuan years ago and since then the signs of battle was long gone and after being ruled well it was bustling. There were people everywhere milling around much like it was before the war. The only difference was that it was even more thriving with the presence of Middle Plains women speaking in Gao Xing language asking and haggling prices with the vendors.Xiao Yao asked Jing \u201cHow did it become this way?\u201dJing smiled \u201cXuan Yuan troops live in Gao Xing for extended periods of time and His majesty worried that the soldiers missed their families too much. So he spent the money to encourage soldier families to move to Gao Xing. When there is no battles fought, every month the soldiers can rotate from an active army camp back here to the town and live with their families. Soldiers with kids get additional compensation to help. His majesty did this and the troops are both comforted and also work extra hard to secure this territory because they are also protecting their own families who live here now.\u201dXiao Yao saw many young wives carrying baskets of food in one hand with a baby or child on their backs. \u201cSo their kids are born in Gao Xing?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Jing thought about it and divined deeper into what Zhuan Xu was thinking, having Xuan Yuan next generation born in Gao Xing would encourage them to settle here and further integrate the people.A bunch of kids were playing by the castle wall and it wasn\u2019t clear from their happy hollering who was Gao Xing and who was Xuan Yuan. Xiao Yao stared at them and murmured \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I thought the war would be like.\u201dJing said \u201cThe Black Emperor is very different than the Yellow Emperor, just like the Grand Emperor was very different than Qi Yo, just like today\u2019s Xuan Yuan Kingdom is very different than the Xuan Yuan Kingdom back then.\u201dZhuan Xu heard every word of Jing and Xiao Yao\u2019s conversation. Since Xiao Yao entered Gao Xing she didn\u2019t want to speak with him so he kept silent and allowed Xiao Yao to see and hear for herself.The sun started to set and the waning light cast upon the castle walls.Zhuan Xu said \u201cThe castle walls will be closing soon. I don\u2019t want to spend the night in the castle and want to stay in the village. If you two don\u2019t care, let\u2019s exit the castle now.\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao who stiffly replied \u201cYou\u2019re the Emperor, we\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201dThey exited the castle and rode a cow pulled cart until arriving in a little village later that night.A fire was lit at the entrance to the village and there was lots of bustling activity as people sat on rocks and trees watching a stage. Xiao Yao had the cart stop and walked over to see a stage play was being performed about the ancient G.o.d Wan Xiang who could change his face at will. This type of play based on this G.o.d allowed the performer to change masks at will and act out multiple parts.The Wan Xiang play was popular throughout the vast wilderness and tonight\u2019s story was about the opening of the earth to begin civilization. The story included the smart and caring Hua Xu, the loyal and brave Sheng Nong, the das.h.i.+ng and elegant Gao Xing, the well-learned and talented Xi Ling, the sly money loving Tu Shan nine-tailed fox, the physically weak but devious Gui Fang, the water-based power that was Chi Sui, the forger of all metals Jin Tian\u2026\u2026all these figures worked with the Great Emperor Pan Gu to slay demons and create the vast wilderness. Back then the vast wilderness was one family, there was no Sheng Nong royal family, no Gao Xing royal family, and especially no Xuan Yuan royal family.The children watching the play cheered and cried and hollered as the story progressed and even Xiao Yao got really into it. Even though this was based on legends and myths pa.s.sed on through time, there was some truth to it and she believed that the sacrifices made by those ancestors were all real.Other than watching the play, Xiao Yao also understood why Zhuan Xu encouraged such performances. It was for entertainment, yes, to relieve the pressure of everyday life. But after watching it, over time the Gao Xing people was gradually soaking in the belief Zhuan Xu wanted to impart: The entire world was one big family without Gao Xing or Xuan Yuan divisions. From all four corners it was all people of the vast wilderness.It was very late when the play was done and the three of them didn\u2019t rush anywhere else and just bunked down in the village.The next morning as they were departing, Xiao Yao saw a bunch of village kids enacting their own version of the play story and picking characters to play happily. Xiao Yao watched them and smiled, as long as Zhuan Xu and Feng Long didn\u2019t kill and harm needlessly, then these kids would grow up not to hate Zhuan Xu or the Chi Sui family.As the cart gradually left the village and the sounds of the kids laughter faded, Xiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cHow did you think of this idea? Even I was captivated and influenced by the play last night, much less the villagers.\u201dZhuan Xu replied \u201cThe play is just telling history that really happened and I simply want the people to learn it.\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t help herself \u201cI hope learning this truth won\u2019t pay the price of lives.\u201dZhuan Xu looked out over the hills and said \u201cI lived in Gao Xing for over two hundred years. I went out early fis.h.i.+ng with the fisherman and coming in late into the night. I went out hawking wares with peddlers in exchange for wine, I dug for lotus root by the pond and sang songs afterwards under the moonlight, I hunted bandits on raids with the soldiers, when I was forced into exile from Xuan Yuan and wandered Gao Xing, it was the people of this land who accompanied me through the most lonely and adrift period of my life. They are all dead now but their grandchildren and beyond still live on this land They still work hard doing all the things I did with their ancestors. I know their hards.h.i.+p and I know their happiness!\u201dZhuan Xu looked back at Xiao Yao with candor in his eyes \u201cXiao Yao, if we\u2019re discussing who cares for this land, I will only surpa.s.s you and will never be any less than you!\u201dXiao Yao was speechless because he was right. She was the Gao Xing princess but she didn\u2019t really understand Gao Xing. Zhuan Xu was the one who explored and wandered every inch of this land.Zhuan Xu said \u201cI admit I have ambitious dreams but I\u2019m also just going with the flow and making something inevitable happen. Uniting the entire vast wilderness is best for the people. War will undoubtedly have casualties but I\u2019ve done everything I can to avoid harming the innocent. Xiao Yao, I don\u2019t hope that you will approve of what I\u2019m going but at least try to see that I\u2019m doing all I can.\u201dXiao Yao turned her head to look at the scenery and said in a low voice \u201cI see it.\u201d Her voice was as soft as a whisper but both Jing and Zhuan Xu\u2019s hearing was excellent so they both heard it clearly.Zhuan Xu let out a relieved sigh before crossing his hands and laying back on the cart to stare at the blue sky above. He rarely expressed any emotion but hearing what Xiao Yao said turned him into an untried young man as he let out a happy laugh.Next came the sound of a strong male voice as Zhuan Xu sang a fisherman\u2019s song in Gao Xing dialect. Fishermen in the lake heard his song and joined in as the song grew louder and louder.Jing was stunned, he knew that Zhuan Xu wandered the world as a commoner for hundreds of years but he would have never imagined Zhuan Xu would show that side of him at this point in his life. Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t perturbed in the least, clearly accustomed to seeing Zhuan Xu like this. Clearly Zhuan Xu was always like this in front of Xiao Yao and Jing just happened to chance upon it today.Jing remembered what the Yellow Emperor said to him before \u201cBetween Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu, even I am an outsider.\u201d Jing saddened felt a frisson of unease but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint the exact reason why. His marriage with Xiao Yao was already arranged and both Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor consented. During the entire time he was dating Xiao Yao, Zhuan Xu never once objected.They arrived at Feng Long\u2019s army base on the evening of the second day.Xiao Yao felt awkward seeing Feng Long and whispered to Zhuan Xu \u201cHow about I change and pretend to be your secret guard?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding him for nearly twenty years, are you going to do it for the rest of your life? All you did was run off from one wedding. Neither Jing nor Feng Long care anymore about that old business, why can\u2019t you let it go?\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t lower his voice when he said that so both Jing and the just arriving Feng Long heard it. Both felt a tad awkward but Zhuan Xu acted like he didn\u2019t see it and pushed Xiao Yao in front of Feng Long and said with a smile \u201cFeng Long, do tell her that you don\u2019t care anymore about the runaway bride old news.\u201dFeng Long bowed to Zhuan Xu and when he straightened he said \u201cFrom when I open my eyes until I close them at night, all I think about is Ru So. I even think about Ru So in my dreams.\u201dZhuan Xu asked Jing \u201cDo you care that Xiao Yao ran away from a wedding?\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao and said clearly \u201cNot one whit.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cDid you hear that? One long ago forgot and the other doesn\u2019t care at all. Can you let it go now?\u201dXiao Yao knew what Zhuan Xu did in forcing this issue out in the open to be discussed directly. She could avoid Feng Long forever but he was Jing\u2019s best friend and she couldn\u2019t let their friends.h.i.+p be strained because of her so she bowed to Feng Long \u201cGreat General.\u201dFeng Long politely returned the bow \u201cMiss Xi Ling.\u201dXiao Yao retreated behind Jing and Zhuan Xu.Feng Long asked Jing curiously \u201cWhy are you here with His majesty?\u201d The awkwardness was gone and he was back to himself as usual.Jing laughed \u201cI thought you would never meet someone who could best you. Who knew Ru So would serve you three defeats in a row so of course I had to come watch from the sidelines.\u201dFeng Long acted all hurt \u201cYour majesty, did you hear that!\u201dThe three men walked into a tent to start discussing important matters and Xiao Yao quietly went off to wash up. She believed it now that Feng Long had let it go but men and women were different. A man\u2019s world was vast and many things are easily washed away with time. Feng Long would be upset three months later, but three years later he wouldn\u2019t feel much. Now he was a Great General commanding tens of thousands of soldiers, he could care even less that Xiao Yao ran off from being his bride. Plus Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t even the Gao Xing princess anymore and was instead Qi Yo\u2019s daughter, likely the ambitious Feng Long was even relieved he didn\u2019t end up marrying her.Zhuan Xu sent someone to liaise with Jing to provide a source of business information he needed. The person turned out to be Jin Xuan and Xiao Yao was very happy to see a familiar face. She called for some food and wine and sat down to catch up with her.Xiao Yao asked \u201cHow did you end up in Gao Xing?\u201dJin Xuan said \u201cHis majesty needs Gao Xing information the most right now so I\u2019m in Gao Xing to collect information for him.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cI thought you and Xiao Xiao would become His majesty\u2019s consorts but who knew both of you continued to serve him in the same capacity as before. I saw the way you feel about him so I wrongly a.s.sumed you were living on Zhi Jin Summit.\u201dJin Xuan smiled at Xiao Yao and said nothing for some time. She drank her wine before saying \u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong, I did fall for him. Because I really fell for him that is why I requested to leave.\u201dXiao Yao was perplexed \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf my heart wasn\u2019t moved then everything I do can receive a commensurate reward. But having my heart in it, then I will gradually want more and more. I know His majesty can never give me all I will want and I would be hurt and then commit an infraction that will lead to him distrusting and disdaining me. I would rather leave when I can still be sensible about it. If I keep my distance from him, with how much I\u2019ve done to serve him then he will forever be grateful towards me.\u201dXiao Yao \u201cYou\u2026.you\u2026..you\u2019re so smart yet so cruel towards yourself! Very few women can carve out a free distance for herself in your situation.\u201d\u201cI have to thank His majesty for giving me this freedom and s.p.a.ce. I know a lot of secrets and another person would keep me close to him. But I wanted to leave and His majesty let me!\u201d Jin Xuan drank her wine with a smile \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to forget a man like His majesty, but I know with time that can be accomplished. The world is so vast and as long as I\u2019m traveling the road then I believe I can meet a man one day who will make me forget His majesty.\u201dXiao Yao toasted Jin Xuan \u201cBest wishes to you meeting that person soon!\u201dJin Xuan smiled and returned the toast before leaving with Jing to head to the town to collect the information he needed.On the 17th day in mid-autumn, Ru So\u2019s army launched an attack first. Ru So was riding on the last three victories and his troops advanced confidently, with Ju Mang defeating Xian. To avoid having her troop be cornered, Feng Long ordered Xian to retreat and she led her troops back to rendezvous with Feng Long\u2019s forces.This was his fourth defeat to Ru So and Feng Long was thoroughly shamed but it was Zhuan Xu who rea.s.sured him \u201cIt\u2019s more important to preserve your forces and wait for the a better time. A dead person can\u2019t resurrect and if Xian continued to fight without reinforcements and she was lost, then the defeat of the right forward flank cannot be fixed. As long as they are alive then I have faith they will continue to win more territory in the long run.\u201dBecause Xian was a Chi Sui clan member, Feng Long was worried Zhuan Xu would think he was going easy on her yet Zhuan Xu never doubted him and instead understood and consoled him. Feng Long was relieved and touched that his choice many years ago was correct, Zhuan Xu was a sage ruler who was worth following.Feng Long invited Jing out for a walk and when they were alone he said \u201cBack then I felt Zhuan Xu was a smart choice but he was fighting an uphill battle all alone so I hesitated in deciding whether to back him. It was thanks to your endless persuasion that led me to make up my mind. Thank you!\u201d Back then to get him to decide, Jing even said \u201cBecause Zhuan Xu is all alone is even more reason for you to back him. If you picked Cui Liang or Yu Hao it would be adding to their ma.s.ses of supporters. But if you picked Zhuan Xu then you\u2019re the first to back him and would be forever in his good graces.\u201dJing smiled \u201cI was merely a.n.a.lyzing the situation for you, in the end you made the choice of your own consideration.\u201dFeng Long looked out over the distance and sighed \u201cYou\u2019re always like this, always refusing to accept your due! You thought up the plan to win Zhuan Xu the throne by giving up Xuan Yuan Mountain and going to Sheng Nong Mountain. You explained it all to me, how His majesty would be gaining the support of the Middle Plains by going to Sheng Nong Mountain, and with our help his success would increase since he was the eldest grandson of the Emperor and Empress anyways so the Xuan Yuan elders would not vehemently oppose him in the end after he got the support of the Middle Plains. Your a.n.a.lysis persuaded me to support His majesty and to this day he still thinks I came up with that plan, that I was the one with such grand vision, hence he\u2019s always extra trusting of me and allow me to remain as both a friend and subordinate to him.\u201dFeng Long was perplexed \u201cJing, why don\u2019t you ever fight for something with me?\u201d He was born in the same lofty background as Jing, one the future Chi Sui clan leader and the other the future Tu Shan clan leader. On the journey to make Zhuan Xu the Black Emperor, Jing likely did more for Zhuan Xu than Feng Long, and definitely not any less. But Jing always remained in the background and acted like Feng Long\u2019s follower, allowing him to take all the reward on the way to making Feng Long\u2019s own ambitions come true.Jing said \u201cHow did I not compete with you? I only gave up the things I don\u2019t care about. What I really want I never once let you have.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026..\u201d Feng Long furrowed his brow and asked \u201cXiao Yao?\u201dJing sighed and admitted \u201cYou view me as an older brother but I haven\u2019t been completely forthright with you. I knew you were interested in Xiao Yao yet I wooed her in your own residence. I knew you planned to marry her yet I send Fang Feng Bei to s.n.a.t.c.h her at the wedding. I\u2019ve never done anything in my entire life I need to apologize for, other than these two things, and both were done to you.\u201dFeng Long remembered the incident and still felt a sting of anger \u201cWhen Xiao Yao ran off from the wedding, I really was miserable for quite some time and was so ashamed to see anyone.\u201dJing said \u201cI thought I could let her go but I thought too highly of myself. I\u2019m sorry!\u201dFeng Long stared at Jing and then laughed \u201cI always thought you so magnanimous, so n.o.ble in all your actions. Every time I saw you I felt inadequate, who knew you were really a selfish sneaky guy all along!\u201dJing said \u201cWhen Xiao Yao and I got engaged, you were already in Gao Xing fighting so the present from you likely came from the Chi Sui elders preparing it while cursing me out. All these years we still communicate but never mention this issue and act like it doesn\u2019t exist. But I really wish to receive a sincere well-wish from you.\u201d\u201cDo you really care?\u201d\u201cI care very much, you know that in this lifetime I will never get a well-wish from my older brother, I don\u2019t want to also not get one from you.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s heart smiled seeing Jing discuss him in the same breadth as Hou. He really did view him as a real brother! But he decided to cop an att.i.tude still \u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201dJing and Feng Long grew up together for thirty years as kids so Jing could tell immediately what Feng Long was really thinking and laughed \u201cYou take your time considering it. It\u2019s still a ways away before Xiao Yao and I get married.\u201dFeng Long stopped pretending and laughed \u201cActually, I was angry when I first heard of the engagement since it\u2019s hard not to remember the past. But I also marveled at your courage since Xiao Yao\u2019s not the same as before, she was a priceless treasure before but is now a big problem that no one dares to touch. At least now I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to be with her. So after a few days my anger pa.s.sed but I wasn\u2019t able to be happy for you either. So I told the elders to prepare whatever present they wanted.\u201d Feng Long patted Jing\u2019s shoulder \u201cDon\u2019t worry, on your wedding day I will personally be there to deliver a present. As long as Ru So that b.a.s.t.a.r.d isn\u2019t in the middle of picking a battle with me, I will find time to attend your wedding.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the thanks for? I really ought the thank you. Everyone admires the head of the Four Great Clans but I see it as bars in a prison. In the past you patiently listened to all my gripes and only you never chastised me for being impertinent. Not only that, you also supported me and now I\u2019ve finally broken the traditional edicts and become a Great General to live my dreams! Jing, you actually helped me achieve what I truly wanted. Forget that Xiao Yao isn\u2019t mine now, even if she is mine you can have her if you really want her. She\u2019s not what I really want but she\u2019s someone that you will exchange your life in order to be with.\u201dFeng Long grabbed Jing\u2019s shoulder and sighed \u201cActually I should be thankful that all you want is Xiao Yao. If you wanted what I want then we may never be brothers since one mountain cannot have two tigers.\u201dJing didn\u2019t reject the bodily contact like before when Feng Long touched him because he knew that after all they went through and the positions they occupied now, a shoulder hug was so precious and rare. In this very moment, Jing and Feng Long completely trusted each other with closeness that could easily deliver a killing strike to the other.Feng Long and Jing just arrived back at the base when Yu Jiang came rus.h.i.+ng over to report \u201cA girl barged into the army base and has been captured. It\u2019s unclear her ident.i.ty, likely a Gao Xing n.o.ble.\u201dFeng Long asked \u201cYou didn\u2019t interrogate to confirm her ident.i.ty?\u201dYu Jiang had two large scratches on his face and looked sheepish \u201cThat girl is too difficult to wrangle. I\u2026.I\u2026.I\u2019ll leave her to the Great General to interrogate!\u201dFeng Long and Jing walked over and saw from the distance a girl bound tightly with ropes but she refused to stop fighting and still shot water arrows and swords from her free hands towards the soldiers, none of who dared to hurt her but still had to keep her restrained.Feng Long sighed \u201cIf it was a Gao Xing spy who has been captured she ought not to be so belligerent. If she\u2019s not a spy then why won\u2019t she just talk nicely?\u201dJing already recognized her and rushed over. Feng Long stopped once he got close and saw her face which had a dirty rag stuffed in her mouth. It was the Gao Xing princess! Yu Jiang may have come from Gao Xing\u2019s Yi He tribe but he never was ranked high enough to have met the princess in person.Feng Long quickly asked \u201cWho stuffed the rag in her mouth?\u201dA soldier replied \u201cI did, sir! She kept insulting and cursing His majesty and the Great General so I used my rag to shut her mouth.\u201dFeng Long hurriedly untied her and took out the rag as Ah Nian immediately started screaming \u201cYou piece of s.h.i.+t Zhuan Xu! You b.a.s.t.a.r.d who forgot who raised you! Also Yu Jiang, you traitor, get out here now\u2026\u2026.\u201dFeng Long\u2019s forehead furrowed tightly and he wanted to shove the rag back in Ah Nian\u2019s mouth but didn\u2019t dare.Jing brought over a cup of fresh water and handed it to Ah Nian \u201cRinse your mouth.\u201dAh Nian stopped cursing and immediately took the cup to rinse her mouth. Thinking that a stinky dirty man\u2019s rag was in her mouth, she wanted to grab a brush and scour her mouth inside and out.Jing appeared to understand and said \u201cIf you want to curse at least wash up first, I\u2019ll take you to clean up.\u201dAh Nian c.o.c.ked her head to stare at the handsome n.o.ble man before her, his form lean and tall like a pristine spring winding through a serene bamboo forest and calming anyone who saw him \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before, you\u2019re the Young Master of Qing Qui \u2013 the Tu Shan clan leader.\u201dJing smiled back \u201cIt\u2019s all men here and not clean, will Princess please come with me.\u201dAh Nian docilely followed Jing and Feng Long breathed a sigh of relief that Jing was here to handle this. He ordered all the soldiers to never divulge what happened here today and then rushed to report to Zhuan Xu. This \u201cGao Xing spy\u201d was not someone Feng Long dared to interrogate, he would leave her to His majesty.\u201dJing brought Ah Nian to Xiao Yao\u2019s tent and called inside \u201cXiao Yao, guess who\u2019s here?\u201dJing opened the curtain to let Ah Nian in with such ease and comfort without any awkwardness of the situation today between the girls. Xiao Yao was startled to see Ah Nian looking so woebegone and immediately said to Miao Pu and Xiao Xiao \u201cQuickly prepare a wash for the Princess.\u201dAh Nian stood at the door to the tent, saying nothing and not making a move, only glaring at Xiao Yao. Clearly she was not expecting to see Xiao Yao here. Jing made a gesture for Xiao Yao to have Ah Nian rinse her mouth so she brought a scented water cup over \u201cRinse your mouth.\u201dAh Nian wanted to decline but that dirty stinky rag bothered her so much she quickly started was.h.i.+ng. Jing looked at Xiao Yao who smiled and nodded her head so he quietly left the tent.Ah Nian finished was.h.i.+ng her mouth and was angrily about to start yelling when Xiao Yao said \u201cYou smell like sweat, go take a bath first.\u201d Ah Nian dejectedly sniffed herself before immediately following Xiao Xiao to bathe.After bathing and changing into clean clothes, Ah Nian returned to Xiao Yao\u2019s tent with all her bl.u.s.ter gone and her real emotions bubbling to the surface.When Xiao Yao suddenly appeared on Five G.o.ds Mountain and took away her dad and then her Zhuan Xu gege, she hated Xiao Yao and never wanted to call her jiejie. But she constantly paid attention to Xiao Yao who never spoke about Ah Nian behind her back like others did and instead told her directly what she thought. Xiao Yao dared to fight back and argue back with Ah Nian, and when Ah Nian was b.u.t.ting heads with Xing Yue it was Xiao Yao who always backed her and taught her what to do. She gradually accepted Xiao Yao as her older sister and even started to like this jiejie.When dad took his two daughters out to sea and they spent the night talking, they agreed to reunite in the winter and Ah Nian even prepared an exquisite present for her homecoming.But, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t come back!She suddenly disappeared just as suddenly as she appeared in Five G.o.ds Mountain, never once saying a word to Ah Nian about it.Ah Nian hated Xiao Yao not because she was Qi Yo\u2019s daughter, she hated Xiao Yao only because she broke her promise to Ah Nian, she broke her promise and never even said a word about it.Ah Nian stared at the calm Xiao Yao and suddenly all her anger came forth. See! Xiao Yao was living so well! She totally forgot about her promise to come back to Five G.o.ds Mountain in the winter and to teach Ah Nian to swim!If it was Xiao Yao, she would use calm to cover up her anger, to use disinterest to cover up how much she really cared. But Ah Nian wasn\u2019t like that, when she was angry she wanted to tell the world about it.Ah Nian hollered at Xiao Yao \u201cRu So told me not to blame you, said you were very pitiful, but how are you pitiful? I\u2019m the pitiful one, with a fake sister who lied and made me treat her as a real older sister. And Zhuan Xu, he\u2026.\u201d Ah Nian couldn\u2019t even continue as her eyes filled with tears \u201cYou\u2019re both cruel selfish liars! I hate you both!\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cI never lied to you to be your older sister, I really wanted to be your older sister. It\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yao felt sad she couldn\u2019t be her dad\u2019s daughter, but she also liked that she turned out to be her daddy\u2019s daughter, so she didn\u2019t quite know how to explain it to Ah Nian.Ah Nian saw Xaiao Yao pause and asked \u201cAnd what?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know back then that my real father was Qi Yo.\u201d\u201cAfter finding out later then you didn\u2019t want to be my jiejie anymore, right?\u201dXiao Yao walked to the window and stared out, not wanting Ah Nian to see the weakness in her heart \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t want to but\u2026.Ah Nian, the Grand Emperor had me stricken from the Gao Xing family tree and ancestral lineage books and forbade me from using the Gao Xing last name.\u201dAh Nian\u2019s mouth dropped open and didn\u2019t know how to berate Xiao Yao anymore, by being stricken from the family then Xiao Yao would have no right to go to Five G.o.ds Mountain anymore. Remembering the way the Gao Xing officials viciously cursed Xiao Yao, Ah Nian\u2019s heart softened.Ah Nian said \u201cThen you\u2026.if you can\u2019t come to Five G.o.ds Mountain then at least send message to say hi to me. I\u2026.I\u2019m still waiting for you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for me?\u201d Xiao Yao was surprised and realized that Ah Nian was angry at her and not disgusted with her.Ah Nian harrumphed and said irritably \u201cI\u2019m not here to catch up with you! If you\u2019re here then that black hearted b.a.s.t.a.r.d Zhuan Xu must also be here. I want to see him!\u201dXiao Yao sat down next to Ah Nian \u201cI didn\u2019t know my true birth secret and later when I found out my heart was broken. From birth I\u2019ve been living a lie and I never knew it but people hated me and wanted to kill me. I didn\u2019t know you were waiting for me, I thought you also looked down upon me and despised me, never wanting to see me again. Everyone thinks my mom wronged your dad, and my daddy is Qi Yo. Even now I\u2019m very careful around you, worried that if you get mad you\u2019ll say the most hurtful things to insult my mom, my daddy, or call me a b.a.s.t.a.r.d.\u201dAh Nian stared at Xiao Yao \u201cI can\u2019t tell you\u2019re in pain or that you\u2019re being very careful.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhen I was small growing up with no parents to take care of me, I learned never to expect others to comfort me. My tears will only attract predators so I like to keep my emotions deep inside.\u201dAh Nian considered it and her expression softened \u201cIs Zhuan Xu the same way?\u201d\u201cPretty much.\u201d\u201cWas he mistreated greatly when he lived in Gao Xing and never told my dad and me? That\u2019s why he\u2019s attacking Gao Xing now?\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu must have suffered things living in Gao Xing but that\u2019s not the reason he\u2019s attacking Gao Xing.\u201dAh Nian was anxious \u201cThen why? Why is he doing this? What did my dad and I do to deserve this from him? Why is he doing this to us?\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know how to answer when Zhuan Xu lifted the curtain and walked in \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong to me. This is between your dad and me.\u201dXiao Yao sighed in relief and quietly left the tent to let those two have a private conversation.Ah Nian saw Zhuan Xu and all her emotions welled up. She didn\u2019t realize it but her tears started falling as she collapsed on the ground sobbing \u201cI don\u2019t understand! Daddy also said this has nothing to do with me, it\u2019s between him and you. But how can it have nothing to do with me? You two are fighting a war! There\u2019s bloodshed and people dying, how can it not concern me?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cHow did Master allow you to sneak out? I\u2019ll send someone to escort you back to Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dAh Nian pleaded \u201cZhuan Xu gege, please don\u2019t attack Gao Xing anymore, okay? Daddy is really exhausted, his hair has turned all white and his health is worsening and now has difficulty walking!\u201dAh Nian grabbed Zhuan Xu\u2019s robe and looked up at him through her tears \u201cZhuan Xu gege, Zhuan Xu gege, I beg you, I beg you!\u201d In the past when Ah Nian pleaded with Zhuan Xu, no matter how difficult he would acquiesce to her. But now he just silently stood there.After a long time Zhuan Xu replied \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that.\u201dAh Nian was heartbroken and enraged \u201cIf Xiao Yao was still daddy\u2019s daughter and she begged you, would you still say no?\u201dZhuan Xu calmly answered \u201cTen years ago she already begged me and I said no. Ah Nian, I am the ruler of a kingdom and this decision I made is not something that will change if either you or Xiao Yao beg me.Ah Nian started sobbing again, hating Zhuan Xu for being so heartless but also secretly feeling comfort that Zhuan Xu also didn\u2019t agree when Xiao Yao begged him.Zhuan Xu watched Ah Nian grow up and couldn\u2019t help himself, kneeling down to hand a handkerchief to her \u201cI know you hate me and I know this will sound insincere to you but I really do believe this. Some things are between kingdoms and others are between emperors. But between you and I, you are still Ah Nian and I am still your Zhuan Xu gege, as long as it doesn\u2019t involve national affairs then I will do everything in my power for you.\u201dAh Nian covered her face and continued to sob because she just didn\u2019t know what to do. One was her daddy and the other was Zhuan Xu. How could both tell her so calmly that it didn\u2019t have anything to do with her. If so then why didn\u2019t Ru So gather information about Zhuan Xu for her anymore? Why didn\u2019t Zhuan Xu write to her anymore? If it had nothing to do with her, then why did even her mom tell her to forget about Zhuan Xu from now on?Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t try to cajole and comfort Ah Nian like he used to, he just silently sat beside her and watched her with the sadness of time gone by reflected in his eyes.Ah Nian cried for half an hour before her tears gradually subsided.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cYou said Master\u2019s hair all turned white, is that really true?\u201dAh Nian hiccupped \u201cWhen Dad announced that Xiao Yao was no longer a princess, that year I saw him one day gravely injured and his hair has turned all white. He was supposed to slowly recuperate, who knew you suddenly declared war and attacked us. Dad\u2019s illness has never recovered\u2026..I think he\u2019s suffering from a broken heart which is why his hair and body can\u2019t fully recover.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cSince Master is gravely ill, why are you here instead of spending time on Five G.o.ds Mountain with him?\u201dAh Nian lifted her head \u201cI didn\u2019t come find you! I saw Xiao Yao and then realized you were here.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dAh Nian added \u201cI came to a.s.sa.s.sinate Yu Jiang and Feng Long.\u201dZhuan Xu was shocked and silently glad Ah Nian didn\u2019t come to a.s.sa.s.sinate Xian. Feng Long recognized Ah Nian while Yu Jiang would never hurt a weak Gao Xing girl due to feeling guilty towards his Gao Xing roots. If it was Xian that block of cold ice, she would kill right back.Zhuan Xu huffed \u201cGao Xing has plenty of generals, when did it land to your turn to be an a.s.sa.s.sin! I need to write Ru So a letter to strengthen the guards around Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dAh Nian started crying again \u201cYou know the Bai Hu tribe and the Chang Yi tribe still resent Dad for not taking an Empress from them and picked my lowly born mute mom. They don\u2019t want to follow dad and resent me, all these years with the battling and Dad\u2019s illness, they\u2019ve started clamoring for him to officially name a successor. I\u2019m his only daughter but they don\u2019t support my being the next ruler, calling me useless and stupid so they want to pick one of Dad\u2019s nephews. Dad has refused to answer them so they are fighting about it daily. I don\u2019t care about being the next ruler but I can\u2019t stand them bothering Dad every day! They call me useless and stupid so I wanted to show them what I can do which is why I decided to a.s.sa.s.sinate Yu Jiang or Feng Long. The former is a Gao Xing traitor and the latter is the Xuan Yuan Great General. No matter who I kill they will have to acknowledge me!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do something foolish like this ever again! You don\u2019t need to care about those tribes, their conflict with Master long predated you and your mom. You don\u2019t need to feel bad about what they said about you, or think you\u2019re the reason why Master is currently in a bind.\u201dAh Nian asked \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cYes! Sure Master could have lessened some tension by picking a consort from their tribes which he didn\u2019t do.\u201dAh Nian pursed her lips \u201cThen it does have something to do with my mom and I.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cMaster refused to pick back then because of his own stubbornness, not because of your mom! It has nothing to do with you, understand?\u201dAh Nian thought about it and slowly nodded her head.\u201cAh Nian, you have to trust Master. Sometimes in a tough bind is just a spider spinning a web to catch a b.u.t.terfly in the long run.\u201dAh Nian thought and didn\u2019t understand and started crying again \u201cWhy do you have to attack Gao Xing? If you didn\u2019t attack Gao Xing then I would have come to discuss my worries with you, then I wouldn\u2019t have tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate Yu Jiang and end up with a stinky man\u2019s rag in my mouth\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu patted the crying Ah Nian\u2019s back while deep in thought: With Master\u2019s smarts he would have a way to counter the demand to name a successor. It wasn\u2019t something he could ignore because all four tribes care about it on top of all the officials. Other than Ah Nian there wasn\u2019t a single successor but Master never trained Ah Nian to rule the kingdom\u2026..If Master took one wrong step then Gao Xing would descend into chaos, so the best choice is to find a suitable husband for Ah Nian, name her successor, and slowly train her son to rule one day. Did Master want to pick Ru So? Is this the reason why Ru So was so proactive in attacking recently?Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t figure out what Master was thinking, even though he stayed with him for two hundred years he still didn\u2019t fully understand him the same way he could never fully understand his grandfather. Perhaps this is what it is like being a ruler, never able to discern their thought process.To a.s.sa.s.sinate Yu Jiang and Feng Long, Ah Nian was jittery for many days and last night didn\u2019t even sleep a wink. Now she tired herself out from crying and her tightly wound self relaxed and fell asleep.Zhuan Xu gestured to the maids to take care of Ah Nian and left the tent towards the direction his guards pointed.Under the setting sun, Jing and Xiao Yao sat on a rock beside a creek, with Xiao Yao chattering nonstop while Jing listened to her with a soft smile. Suddenly Xiao Yao flew forward and kissed Jing on the lips before sitting back down even before Jing could react, smiling like a satisfied cat and continuing her talking.Zhuan Xu foot stepped down hard and loudly snapped the branch underfoot.Xiao Yao turned around and saw him and her face turned red \u201cGege.\u201dJing stood up as if nothing happened and asked \u201cDid the princess leave?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cShe fell asleep exhausted and I ordered the maids to tend to her inside Xiao Yao\u2019s tent. Xiao Yao, you can sleep with Miao Pu and Xiao Xiao tonight.\u201d\u201cI can sleep in the same tent as Ah Nian!\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t want Xiao Yao to interact too much with Ah Nian \u201cNo need, I told Xiao Xiao to stay there and take care of Ah Nian so you go sleep with Miao Pu one night.\u201dXiao Yao said yes.Jing noticed Zhuan Xu was preoccupied and said \u201cI\u2019ll be off then.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and waved him off.Zhuan Xu continued walking along the creek with Xiao Yao following behind waiting for him to talk first. After a long time Zhuan Xu continued to just walk in silence.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help it and asked \u201cWhat are you thinking about, worried over Ah Nian?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried over all the people who live on this land.\u201d Zhuan Xu sighed \u201cI was born in Xuan Yuan but raised in Gao Xing. Sometimes I can\u2019t figure out whether I see myself as a Xuan Yuan person or a Gao Xing person. As the Emperor of Xuan Yuan, I should be happy that Gao Xing is having problems which is a great opportunity to strike. But I\u2019m actually not happy about it and sincerely want Master to have a solution for his current predicament and not let this land descend into a battlefield.\u201dXiao Yao stared \u201cWho is the one who brought the battlefield to this land first?\u201dZhuan Xu got angry and whacked Xiao Yao softly \u201cI declared war but both Master and I are very much in control and the battles have not impacted the citizens. But if Gao Xing descends into civil war then those people will not be as restrained as Master and I, they will plunder and pillage and destroy all.\u201dXiao Yao was genuinely scared \u201cWhat kind of problem has happened?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re no help even if you knew. I don\u2019t want to discuss it!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.humph!\u201d Xiao Yao turned to huff off \u201cI\u2019m going to find Jing.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s grip was as tight as a steel vise and Xiao Yao yelped \u201cOuch!\u201dZhuan Xu quickly released his grip and Xiao Yao rubbed her arm \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201dZhuan Xu pursed his lips and said nothing as he walked faster on.Xiao Yao could tell he was in a foul mood and rushed to catch up \u201cOkay, you don\u2019t want to discuss it so I won\u2019t ask, just slow down because I can\u2019t keep up with you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dZhuan Xu abruptly slowed down and stared towards the Northeast and said in a low voice \u201cDo you remember what you once said on Cao Yun Court in Xuan Yuan Mountain\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao silently waited for the rest but Zhuan Xu stopped himself and said nothing more. Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhat did I say?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cNothing.\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s smile was seamless and no longer allowed a crack of real emotion so Xiao Yao stared quizzically at him.Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and dragged her towards the tents with a smile \u201cGo rest, I\u2019ll be fine, just Ah Nian showing up rattled me a bit.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t follow behind Zhuan Xu and just stared at him \u201cI don\u2019t like your war against Gao Xing and often verbally express my dislike but I\u2019m not completely without understanding of why you made the choice. You were born in Xuan Yuan but you spent way more time in Gao Xing. This land helped make who you are today so in terms of attachment you likely are more attached to Gao Xing than to Xuan Yuan. I know the reason you took me out this time is to lessen my worry and also tell me that you haven\u2019t changed. You\u2019re the Emperor but you can still feel hurt and sadness like an ordinary young man. You lost your own loved ones, you endured the pain, which is why you won\u2019t carelessly take it away from others and make them suffer needlessly. I know whatever happens in Gao Xing, at least you will prevent the worst from taking place.\u201dZhuan Xu turned back and smiled at Xiao Yao, this smile was genuine, full of warmth and tender openness.Xiao Yao smiled and shook his arm \u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201dWhen Ah Nian woke up it was morning time and she was already in a cloud carriage headed up to Five G.o.ds Mountain.She was angry Zhuan Xu did this to her, but also felt it was the best way to part. They already said what needed to be said and the rest couldn\u2019t be said, or perhaps didn\u2019t matter if it was said.Ah Nian touched the mulberry rope on her wrist, it was a weapon that she asked the Jin Tian family to forge for her. She was so close to Zhuan Xu but never once thought about using it.Feng Long\u2019s army had been invading Gao Xing for the last ten years but the territory it took over wasn\u2019t even one-tenth of Gao Xing. But what if one day the Xuan Yuan army came right to the base of Five G.o.ds Mountain, would she consider using the mulberry rope to a.s.sa.s.sinate Zhuan Xu then?Before she understood longing the seeds were planted, after she understood longing all she tasted was the bitterness of missing him. She thought she already swallowed the most bitter pill, who knew there was even more bitterness left.The more she thought about it, her love for Zhuan Xu started already with nine-tenths bitterness and only one-tenths sweet, yet she still couldn\u2019t sever it.Ah Nian curled into a ball and covered her face with her hands as she silently wept. Turns out the ability to loudly sob was because of knowing someone else was listening and hoping he would be pained by it. When one was alone, the tears only came down silently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This chapter brings Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao face-to-face with the only male father figure in their lives, and finally understanding how much he suffered for the greater good of the world and how much thought he\u2019s put into handing the same task off to the right person.The war between Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan turns out to be an elaborate side show to mask the greatest political scriptwriting ever, letting the Grand Emperor Shao Hao finally shed the burden he gave everything up to don hundreds of years ago. It\u2019s also wonderful that the kids generation finally learn the whole truth about the past, but sadly that doesn\u2019t make their complicated future any easier a road left to journey. There\u2019s still a lot of LYF awesomeness left so let\u2019s get this s.h.i.+p sailing again!Chapter 40 \u2013 The World is But One Family:The Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan armies stagnated in conflict for ten days around the Li Sui region when Ru Su suddenly launched a ma.s.sive strike by sending the Yi He tribe\u2019s General Qing Lian to engage Yu Jiang in battle.Even though the two kingdoms had been warring for ten plus years, Yu Jiang had intentionally avoided head on skirmishes while Ru So also s.h.i.+ed away from a direct engagement, which is why Yu Jiang had never directly battled an old friend on the battle field. Yu Jiang thought he would be fighting Ju Mang this time, who knew it would be his childhood friend Qing Liang. One was surprised and the other was prepared, one felt guilty and the other angry, Yu Jiang was caught off guard while Qing Liang attacked with fervor. The victory was determined quickly.The right flank army led by Xian came up against Ju Mang who was himself as disciple of the Grand Emperor. He was the same age of Zhuan Xu yet loved to transform into the form of a little boy. He looked playful and innocent but was in truth scheming and tactical. If Ju Mang was battling the reserved stoic Yu Jiang then it would be like encountering a tiger who wasn\u2019t moved by flashy tricks. But battling Xiang, Ju Mang let loose his bag of tricks and managed to severely wound Xian.With their commander injured, the right flank army tasted bitter defeat. Ju Mang wanted to strike the killing attack on Xian and almost succeeded when Yu Jiang dove into the attack maze created by Ju Mang to save her. Ru So\u2019s real plan was never to kill Xian, he wanted to use Xian to lure Yu Jiang into the maze so the maze was set up specifically to contain Yu Jiang.Normally Ru So\u2019s scheme likely wouldn\u2019t succeed but Yu Jiang was in an irrational frenzy to save Xian and completely disregarded his army tactics, diving into the maze to save Xian. He managed to rescue her but was even more gravely injured than her.Ru So\u2019s central flank army was about to launch the final attack when Feng Long ordered all his troops to retreat with his two commanders severely injured and Zhuan Xu also at the army base.This retreat lost the Xuan Yuan forces three castle holdings, the first two was taken back by Gao Xing but the third castle Feng Long abandoned because it was impossible to hold down without ample food supplies inside and a low castle wall.Zhuan Xu remained calm \u201cYou are the Great General, all decisions fall to you.\u201d Feng Long grit his teeth and didn\u2019t care anymore if Zhuan Xu thought he was useless, he ordered all the troops back to Luo Yang Castle with the adage that as long as the mountain existed one didn\u2019t need to worry about finding firewood in the future to burn.This was the worst Xuan Yuan defeat since the war began, with major losses and the two commanders in Xian and Yu Jiang nearly dying. The Xuan Yuan army was fighting a war of slow gains and attrition but with this major loss it was like the last three year\u2019s worth of victories evaporated. If the three earlier defeats were added to the tally, then Xuan Yuan lost a total of five years worth of gains.This victory led to Ru So\u2019s name recognition to spread through the vast wilderness and Zhuan Xu ordered all of Ru So\u2019s battle strategy to be collected and studied. Why was Ru So willing to lose and never use any of the Yi He tribe soldiers? Why use Ju Mang against Xian? Everyone marveled at Ru So\u2019s incisive patience in fighting a long war.Feng Long was spitting mad, raging at Yu Jiang, yelling about Ru So, but there was nothing else he could do as a defeat remained a defeat.Feng Long thought Zhuan Xu would be furious with him but Zhuan Xu a.s.sured him \u201cI already expected Yu Jiang to suffer a crus.h.i.+ng defeat. He\u2019s like a priceless sword that hasn\u2019t been fully unsheathed. Only after a huge defeat will his true power be revealed. Who knew Ru So saw him the same way, he never let Yu Jiang have that opportunity and once he gave him the opportunity it was with an intended killing blow. Yu Jiang got lucky to come out of this alive, and this will teach him that once he has made a choice then he cannot hesitate otherwise he doesn\u2019t just doom himself he may doom others as well.\u201dFeng Long grumbled \u201cThat Ru So is usually all smiles and goofy jokes, not a moment being serious. Hard to believe he\u2019s this hard to deal with.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cHe is also a disciple of Master, if Ru So is easy to deal with then the Grand Emperor would not be the Grand Emperor.\u201dFeng Long thought to himself, His majesty is also the Grand Emperor\u2019s disciple so who would win out in a match between His majesty and Ru So?Zhuan Xu knew what he was thinking \u201cI\u2019m different than Ru So so there is no way to compare. My Grandfather and Master both trained me to become the ruler of the kingdom while Ru So was trained since childhood to be a high official, in peace to serve and in war to protect.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cYour majesty was taught by both Emperors then clearly Your majesty would win in any comparison with Ru So.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cYou better stop learning from the court officials to say such brown-nosing things to me.\u201dFeng Long puffed his chest out \u201cI\u2019m also learning to be a good official to my liege.\u201dZhuan Xu laughed and said nothing. Feng Long and Xing Yue were twins, she seemed intelligent and thoughtful while he was slow and brutish, but in truth the real intelligence laid with Feng Long. He knew when to take a step forward and when to step back. Xing Yue didn\u2019t know when to press and when to give.Feng Long asked \u201cWhen does Your majesty plan to return to Sheng Nong Mountain? I\u2019m not rus.h.i.+ng you back but this is a war zone and I worry about your safety.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI was planning to go back but I feel something else might happen soon. I\u2019ll wait here a bit longer.\u201dHalf a month later, Feng Long received a secret missive from the Gao Xing Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes indicated they wanted to surrender and defect to join the Xuan Yuan kingdom.Feng Long was shocked and handed the missive to Zhuan Xu who read it \u201cYou send the reply and act disbelieving in your response and be haughty.\u201dFeng Long did as ordered and wrote a response.A few days later the messenger came with a new reply missive and asked to see Feng Long in person before handing the letter over.Feng Long met the messenger in his tent and Zhuan Xu transformed into a guard and stood behind Feng Long at the meeting. Feng Long continued to act haughty and disbelieving, coldly asking \u201cI\u2019m not purposely suspicious but this is so unexpected it\u2019s hard to believe. If Xuan Yuan already took over half of Gao Xing territory and surrender was near then the two tribes capitulating would be understandable. But right now Xuan Yuan just suffered a crus.h.i.+ng battle defeat, why would the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes surrender at this time? If the explanation doesn\u2019t make sense then it\u2019s clearly nefarious!\u201dThe messenger took off his mask and he was actually the Chang Yi tribe Elder Liu. When Feng Long was an adult and his grandfather needed the Jin Tian family to make him a weapon, he went to ask Elder Liu for a favor since the Chang Yi tribe was connect in marriage with the Jin Tian family. Based on seniority Feng Long had to call him Grandfather Liu.Feng Long was startled and quickly stood up, exchanging a glance to make sure Zhuan Xu approved before saying \u201cGrandfather Liu, why are you here in person? Hurry and sit down!\u201dElder Liu was very pleased with Feng Long\u2019s polite propriety and smiled \u201cThis is an important matter and your suspicion is understandable. Rather than try and explain in writing I came in person to allay your suspicions.\u201dElder Liu glanced at the guards in the tent and Feng Long a.s.sured him that anything said in here would be confidential. Elder Liu hesitated before explaining \u201cThe Chang Yi tribe and the Chi Sui clan were connected in marriage a few generations ago. Your great grandfather even took in some Chang Yi tribe members before. You must have heard of the plight of the Chang Yi tribe, and how the Chang Yi tribe and the Qing Long tribe conflict happened.\u201d\u201cI heard bits here and there.\u201d\u201cThe former Grand Emperor\u2019s wife the Empress, the mother of the current Grand Emperor, she came from the Qing Long tribe. She died in childbirth giving birth and my two aunties were beautiful and intelligent so were chosen to enter the palace. The former Grand Emperor really liked them and my older auntie was named Empress and gave birth to four sons. My younger auntie the consort gave birth to two sons and two daughters. Both daughters married into the Bai Hu tribe. The two princes wives also came from the Bai Hu tribe. Likely my two aunties were so beloved by the Grand Emperor, the Qing Long tribe continued to believe that they were plotting to kill then Eldest Prince Shao Hao. From then on the Qing Long tribe and the Chang Yi tribes were at odds with each other. It\u2019s hard to believe now since it happened so long ago, but the former Grand Emperor really didn\u2019t like his eldest prince, the currently Grand Emperor, and preferred his second prince Yen Long. My older auntie told me that the former Grand Emperor had actually decided to name the second prince as the Crown Prince heir but then suddenly a coup happened in the palace. Second Prince Yen Long and the Grand Empress were both thrown in Dragon Bone Prison while the current Grand Emperor ascended the throne. A few years later the former Grand Emperor mysteriously died and both my aunties committed suicide. Second Prince was stripped of his G.o.dly rank and vanished. The other five princes were either banished or locked up and they couldn\u2019t accept that so they aligned with the Chang Yi and Bai Hu tribes to launch a rebellion. This is what is now remembered by the world as the Five Princes Revolt.\u201dElder Liu\u2019s eyes misted with tears and sadness \u201cLater all five princes were killed, including their wives and children.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cThis happened hundreds of years ago, I don\u2019t understand why it has to do with today\u2019s meeting?\u201d\u201cThe last hundreds of years, it appears all four Gao Xing tribes were equal in rank and position but the Grand Emperor has only trusted the Qing Long and Yi He tribes. The Grand Emperor has only one princess who is spoiled and untalented, she cannot be relied on to accomplish great things. But under the Qing Long and Yi He tribe\u2019s support, the Grand Emperor actually wants to name the princess as the successor.\u201dFeng Long still looked confused.Elder Liu angrily continued \u201cThe Qing Long and Yi Hi tribes and their sneaky plans! They want Ru So to become the princess\u2019s husband. The princess is useless and the Grand Emperor\u2019s health is deteriorating fast. Once he pa.s.ses then Gao Xing would belong to Ru So who came from the Qing Long tribe. Rather than wait for Gao Xing to fall into the hands of the Qing Long tribe and at such time the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes are pushed to the edge, it\u2019s better to seek greener pastures now.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cI heard about that but the Grand Emperor hasn\u2019t agreed yet. Why don\u2019t the two tribes continue to object?\u201dElder Liu explained \u201cWe did object and initially most of the officials backed us. But with Ru So winning one victory after another and his name being bandied about the vast wilderness, now all the officials and even the commoners of Gao Xing support Ru So marrying the princess. The Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribe voices have been pushed aside.\u201dFeng Long finally understood why the two tribes really did want to surrender and leave Gao Xing \u201cGrandfather Liu, let me be frank. The Chang Yi and Bai Hu tribes may not be as all powerful as before in Gao Xing, but both together are still part of the kingdom\u2019s foundation and leaving would shake the very core of Gao Xing. What does Grandfather Liu really want to accomplish?\u201dElder Liu hesitated and Feng Long pressed \u201cPlease be completely candid, that why I can understand and report back to the Black Emperor who will make the decision.\u201dElder Liu gritted his teeth and declared \u201cIf we help the Black Emperor conquer Gao Xing, then we want the Black Emperor to name the tribe leaders of the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes as territorial kings and also divide up the Qing Long and Yi He territories to us.\u201dEven though Feng Long had mentally prepared for this he was still stunned. The Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes actually wanted to banish the Gao Xing royal family and the Qing Long and Yi He tribes from Gao Xing land forever. No wonder they chose to surrender to achieve this.Feng Long collected himself and replied \u201cThis is a big matter and I will immediately report to His majesty and give a reply in 5 days.\u201dElder Liu was relieved to hear a time set for the reply but noticed two guards standing behind Feng Long shooting angry glares. Feng Long knew what Elder Liu said affected the life and death of two tribes and needed to explain \u201cThese two guards were provided to me by His majesty so even if they are not here they will hear it later from His majesty.\u201dElder Liu didn\u2019t press further with this a.s.surance and was escorted out by Feng Long personally.After Elder Liu was gone, Feng Long looked at Zhuan Xu and saw him calmly thinking while seated in the chair Feng Long just occupied.Feng Long didn\u2019t dare intrude so quietly stood to the aside. After some time Zhuan Xu called \u201cMap.\u201dFeng Long took out the map jewel and injected power inside so the map of the vast wilderness was projected in the tent. Zhuan Xu stared at the Gao Xing territory and asked \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dFeng Long excitedly replied \u201cA great deal! If Jing heard this he would say we won big! If we didn\u2019t have the help of the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes, even after Xuan Yuan won the war Your majesty will naturally have to divide up the land in reward to various families to rule as territorial kings. So if the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes joined Xuan Yuan now, might as well give it to them! This is a trade that\u2019s good for both sides, the only downside is that I don\u2019t get to fight as many battles.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIf I agree then you won\u2019t get your portion.\u201dFeng Long laughed \u201cWho says?\u201d Feng Long pointed at the map \u201cHere, here, and here, the territories that I\u2019ve already conquered happen to be adjacent to Chi Sui. Give those to me is perfect, any more even I don\u2019t dare ask for.\u201dZhuan Xu glanced at Feng Long \u201cYou asked for the best spots.\u201dFeng Long was sheepish \u201cIf Your majesty gave me territory less ideal, then it\u2019ll look bad on Your majesty as well.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled, he wasn\u2019t afraid of officials asking him for something direct, he actually liked Feng Long\u2019s candor and open att.i.tude. The point of the entire world was to share with the world. If a good territory was given to a good subordinate to manage and made it even better then it was good for Zhuan Xu as well.Feng Long probed \u201cDoes Your majesty plan to agree to this offer?\u201d\u201cNo rush, wait until the 5th day.\u201dFeng Long understood that Zhuan Xu had decided to agree but wanted to cool their heels for 5 days. Feng Long was so relieved he picked Zhuan Xu early on.Five days later Feng Long responded to Elder Liu and asked both tribe elders to come personally to hear the Emperor\u2019s reply.Both elders were thrilled to see the Black Emperor personally, and to discuss this matter with them, it made them even more certain that they wanted to surrender to Xuan Yuan.After negotiation, Zhuan Xu accepted their demands to later name their two tribes as regional kings and allow their future generations to live on Gao Xing land permanently. He had both tribes agree never to inter-marry and their descendants must marry Xuan Yuan citizens.After signing the blood oath, the two elders kneeled to the ground with their head bowed to swear fealty to Zhuan Xu. Elder Liu asked if both sides needed to send their troops now to fight alongside the Xuan Yuan army but Zhuan Xu turned them down.Feng Long added \u201cYou both just need to announce to the world that the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes have left Gao Xing and joined the Xuan Yuan kingdom and will now follow the Black Emperor.\u201dBoth elders were flabbergasted \u201cAll you need from us is that?\u201d Both expected the Black Emperor to ask to use their armed forces and to test out their loyalty. They figured the Black Emperor wouldn\u2019t care to lose their soldiers since they were not Xuan Yuan forces.Zhuan Xu said \u201cJust do this is all I need. From now on your people are Xuan Yuan people but they were all Gao Xing born. To have them immediately raise swords against their Gao Xing brethren is difficult so if I don\u2019t need to use them then I won\u2019t.\u201dThe two elders were so grateful \u201cYes! We will immediately make the announcement once we get back telling the entire world that the Chang Yi and Bai Hu tribes now belong to the Xuan Yuan kingdom.\u201dZhuan Xu \u201cI\u2019ll wait for it.\u201dThe next day the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes officially broke from the Gao Xing kingdom and joined the Xuan Yuan kingdom.The news spread like wildfire through the vast wilderness in shock. The Bai Hu and Chang Yi ancestors followed the Gao Xing family since even before the formation of the Gao Xing kingdom. Even now the stories of loyalty and valor from are still shared through the land, but with this the friends.h.i.+p and ties for ten thousand years was shattered in one blow.The world sighed but also eagerly watched the next move from the Grand Emperor. He ought to immediately strike the Bai Hu and Chang Yi forces but with the Xuan Yuan army in the Gao Xing north ready to send reinforcements, it would be a tough battle. If the Grand Emperor didn\u2019t do anything then it would mean he weakly accepted the traitorous desertion of the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes.Zhuan Xu was also waiting for the Grand Emperor\u2019s response. He had been in the army base for too long to keep it a secret so he made it publicly known he was there to survey the troops and also watch response from Gao Xing.Two days later the Grand Emperor declared war on the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes, not using Ru So\u2019s army but the Grand Emperor was going to personally lead forces to punish the traitors.Now the world watched to see what the Black Emperor would do. With news of the Grand Emperor leading the forces everyone expected the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes to lose. But they now followed the Black Emperor so he needed to send back up to help them otherwise in the future no one will ever dare surrender to Xuan Yuan.A giant war catastrophe was looming over the entire vast wilderness and everyone waited anxiously.Zhuan Xu\u2019s brows were furrowed and didn\u2019t allow anyone to bother him, always glancing in the direction of Five G.o.ds Mountain.Right before war broke out, news spread that the leading general of the Gao Xing forces had changed \u2013 just as the Grand Emperor donned his battle armor and was about to depart on his winged ride, he suddenly collapsed due to a leg injury.Princess Gao Xing Yi took her father\u2019s place and donned her battle armor to head to war.Perhaps it was due to the injured Grand Emperor willing to go to war for his people, or perhaps now a weak woman was willing to go to battle in her father\u2019s place, the Gao Xing people turned even more against the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes, hating them to their core and praying for the Princess to vanquish them completely. But all the leaders of the various clans and families figured that if the Gao Xing Princess would defeat the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes then the sun would be rising from the west.Likely Zhuan Xu thought as much because he didn\u2019t move to send troops.If Zhuan Xu did nothing then Ru So also did nothing with his troops.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t have the patience to see who won or lost, she heard the Grand Emperor was so injured as to be unable to ride his winged ride she immediately set off for Five G.o.ds Mountain. She didn\u2019t care that the Grand Emperor didn\u2019t want to see her, she was going to barge in and see him!Zhuan Xu pleaded \u201cDon\u2019t be so impatient, okay? Don\u2019t you feel that the scenario of \u201cgoing to war in place of father\u201d sounds really familiar? Ah Nian was raised by Master himself, how could he think she could go to war for him?\u201dXiao Yao hollered \u201cI don\u2019t care! I don\u2019t care about your strategy and or his schemes. You guys and your kingdom ambitions have nothing to do with me! All I know is that he raised me, loved me, and used his life to protect me! Zhuan Xu, I don\u2019t have the power to stop you from attacking Gao Xing and you can\u2019t stop me from going to see him!\u201d Xiao Yao glared at Zhuan Xu, daring him to fight with her.Zhuan Xu gave up \u201cFine, fine, fine! I don\u2019t care so you go!\u201dHe glanced at Jing who said \u201cYour majesty needn\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll accompany her.\u201dZhuan Xu watched Xiao Yao get on Jing\u2019s winged ride with him, rising into the clouds above and gradually disappearing from view. He wasn\u2019t sure why but his heart hurt and in an impetuous decision he vaulted on his winged ride and chased after them.After he caught up to them was when he realized he was too rash but by then he might as well go all the way!Xiao Yao stared quizzically \u201cAre you sending us off? You can\u2019t be following us all the way to Five G.o.ds Mountain, are you?\u201dZhuan Xu retorted \u201cTogether!\u201d\u201cYou go back!\u201d The two kingdoms were still at war and she didn\u2019t want to second guess the Grand Emperor and was worried about Zhuan Xu\u2019s safety.\u201cJust be silent!\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s tone of voice was still harsh but his expression was warmer.\u201cThen change your face, everyone in Cheng En Palace recognizes you.\u201d\u201cStop nagging, I know what to do.\u201d Even though it was a rash decision Zhuan Xu still had confidence he could safely get back. But seeing Xiao Yao worried about him lifted his spirits.Arriving on Five G.o.ds Mountain, neither Xiao Yao nor Zhuan Xu could make an appearance so had Jing request an audience with the Grand Emperor.Jing\u2019s position as the Tu Shan clan leader was very useful, even though the Grand Emperor was ill the servant still went to announce him. Soon the cloud carriage arrived to take them to the top.Led by the servant, the three arrived at the Grand Emperor\u2019s residence Zhu Xing Pavilion. Xiao Yao\u2019s heart sank, in the past the Grand Emperor did all official business from Cao Hui Court but now he was so ill he needed to see them in his private residence.They walked inside and saw the Grand Emperor sitting against a jade pallet resting, his hair all white and the wrinkles clearly visible on his forehead and eyes. Xiao Yao and Jing saw him like this the last parting in Chi Sui but Zhuan Xu had not seen the Grand Emperor since he left Gao Xing with Xiao Yao back to Xuan Yuan Mountain. He heard that the Grand Emperor was wounded and ill but his memory of him was still from one hundred years ago. Back then the Grand Emperor was as imposing as a mountain vista while now he was like a toppled hillside.Zhuan Xu was so startled he forgot to properly greet the Grand Emperor.Xiao Yao was thinking of how to smooth it over when the Grand Emperor waved his hand and all the servants left the residence leaving only the four of them inside. The Grand Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu and said \u201cZhuan Xu?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Zhuan Xu walked towards the Grand Emperor and transformed his face back.The Grand Emperor smiled \u201cI was just thinking of a way to force you to come see me, who knew you came on your own.\u201dZhuan Xu kneeled down before the Grand Emperor \u201cMaster, why are you like this?\u201d Within the residence, with Master so ill, he didn\u2019t keep a single servant or guard indicating how much he still saw Zhuan Xu as his disciple without any need to guard against him.The Grand Emperor smiled \u201cYou\u2019re all grown up, of course I\u2019ll grow old, and will one day die.\u201dZhuan Xu felt his heart twist and his eyes mist. He lowered his head until he composed himself before lifting his face \u201cXiao Yao\u2019s medical skills are very good now. If she\u2019s here then Master you will get better soon.\u201dXiao Yao kneeled down beside Zhuan Xu \u201cYour majesty, please let me treat you.\u201dThe Grand Emperor handed his wrist to Xiao Yao and she took his pulse and then checked his leg injury. Afterwards Xiao Yao said \u201cHis majesty was gravely injured in the Chi Sui desert but Gao Xing has very good doctors and countless good medicine. If His majesty rested properly and healed then he would be mostly recovered now. But His majesty is plagued by emotional and mental worries, every day fretting and every night sorrowful, unable to sleep properly. That is why the illness hasn\u2019t healed and instead has only gotten worse. If His majesty continues this way\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s words caught in her throat and she couldn\u2019t say it out loud.Zhuan Xu was shocked \u201cFretting every day and sorrowful every night?\u201d Was Xiao Yao really describing Master?The Grand Emperor had nothing to say, he could conceal it from everyone but could not hide it from a skilled doctor. He could control his emotions from showing on his face but his body reflected his true feelings.Zhuan Xu said \u201cMaster, I can understand fretting every day, but I don\u2019t understand being sorrowful every night!\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cZhuan Xu, you should understand. You are sitting in the position where you have lost the right to feel sad. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t feel sad, it\u2019s that we control and suppress our feelings deep inside our hearts.\u201d The Grand Emperor smiled wryly \u201cUnfortunately when I was injured, the sadness I\u2019ve suppressed my entire life was released and has become like a runaway horse can\u2019t\u00a0control.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s eyes reflected his understanding and he sadly replied \u201cI understand now.\u201dThe Grand Emperor appeared exhausted and closed his eyes, but when both Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu thought he had fallen asleep his voice rang out \u201cEvery night I will dream, one piece after another. Sometimes I dream I\u2019m a blacksmith, forging weapons when Qing Yang walks in smiling and laughing. Sometimes I dream of Yun Zhe and Chang Yi, they are both still little boys, just the same age as Zhuan Xu when he came to Gao Xing. They call me \u201cShao Hao gege!\u201d, one asks me to teach him swordplay, the other asks me to teach him the zither. I sometimes dream of my father, when I was born my mom died and he was afraid I would forget her face so he often drew her portrait for me. One night I dreamt that my father carried me to the garden to learn the different types of peach blossoms. I woke up from the dream and couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. I sat up on the pallet and recited the various peach blossoms: green blossom, white peach, beauty peach\u2026..over a hundred different peach blossom varietals that I thought I had long since forgotten and turns out I still remember it all.\u201dThe Grand Emperor continued \u201cThose dreams are all very happy, and when I dream them I don\u2019t want to wake up because I know the reality behind those dreams are all a wasteland of pain where everything is gone. Sometimes all I dream are nightmares. I dream Qing Yang died in my arms, glaring at me and berating me for not keeping my promise; I dream of Chang Yi screaming in horror in a fiery inferno \u2018Shao Hao gege, why didn\u2019t you come save me?\u2019; I dream of the ground entirely covered in blood and my five younger brothers heads ringed in a circle as I stand in the center and they are all mocking me; I dream of my father and he laughingly pushes me onto the throne and asks \u2018You want it? You can have it!\u2019 He takes off his crown and robe and hands it to me, then he ripes his skin and flesh and hands it to me, he\u2019s just a fleshless skeleton and he still reaches out his bony hand and asks \u2018You want it? You can have it!\u2019\u201dZhuan Xu, Xiao Yao, and Jing listened in collective horror, unable to make a single sound, as if a skeleton really was before them in the residence holding forth his skin and flesh in his hands while asking with a smile \u201cYou want it? You can have it!\u201dThe Grand Emperor covered his eyes \u201cThe world pities that I don\u2019t have a son but they don\u2019t know that I am grateful and relieved not to have a son. I\u2019m afraid my son will be like me, if he\u2019s like me who killed my own fa\u2026..\u201d\u201cYOUR MAJESTY!\u201d Jing\u2019s voice rang out and cut short the Grand Emperor.The Grand Emperor opened his eyes and look confused as if waking from a dream and unsure of his surroundings. Likely Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu were so close to him and the past hearing it also overwhelmed them while Jing as the outsider remained the most coolheaded. He handed the Grand Emperor a cup of tea and gently said \u201cYour majesty, please drink some tea!\u201dThe Grand Emperor sipped the tea and his expression gradually regained clarity but his smile was filled with self-pity. The things he did, he could not tell others and others dare not hear it.The Grand Emperor said \u201cAfter Consort Jing An had Ah Nian she couldn\u2019t bear any more children, and I didn\u2019t plan to take any more consorts, so I\u2019ve long since knew I would only have two daughters.Xiao Yao bit her lip while staring at the Grand Emperor.The Grand Emperor reached out his hand \u201cXiao Yao, I remember when you were small. Every night you would sit in front of the court steps with your eyes staring ahead until you saw me. Then you would happily run towards me and into my arms. That was the happiest part of my day because you loved me not for my power or anything else, but because I was your Dad. I loved and coddled you because you were my daughter, even if I didn\u2019t promise your mom or if I didn\u2019t know your uncles, I would still have loved and treated you the same. Don\u2019t be mad at the cold way I\u2019ve pushed you away, I just didn\u2019t want you to feel torn between Zhuan Xu and me.\u201dXiao Yao tightly gripped the Grand Emperor\u2019s hand as if fearing losing him again \u201cI know\u2026.I understood it deep down\u2026.I wasn\u2019t angry at you.\u201d\u201cNot angry? Then why all this \u201cYour majesty\u201d since you walked in here, as if wanting to remind me of what I did.\u201d\u201cI was a little miffed, just a little, but no anger.\u201d\u201cThen you should call me\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao cried out \u201cDad!\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled while Zhuan Xu furrowed his brows.The Grand Emperor glanced at Zhuan Xu \u201cI have many nephews but not a single one worthy. I did hand raise and train three very capable disciples: Ju Mang is reliable and pulls through, Ru So can be trusted with important tasks, and Zhuan Xu\u2026.\u201d The Grand Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu with bright piercing eyes that made Zhuan Xu feel like he was being openly read and he wanted to avert his eyes but in the end he kept his eyes locked with the Grand Emperor.The Grand Emperor continued \u201cI taught you for two hundred years so I know that your ambition is not on one mountain or one land but on the vast wilderness. Since you left Gao Xing, I have been waiting for you to come back.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s heart sank \u201cIf Master already knew then why did you let me leave for Xuan Yuan?\u201d\u201cJing, help me.\u201d The Grand Emperor gestured to the jewel map on the table.Jing picked up the jewel and injected his power to project the map in the residence. The entire vast wilderness surrounded them all, the valleys, rivers, rolling vistas. In that moment everyone was stunned by the breadth.The Grand Emperor said \u201cHundreds of years ago, on the plains of Yi Province, Xiao Yao\u2019s mom pointed to a direction and asked me what is over there. I answered \u2018Mountains, rivers, earth, and people.\u2019 She changed three more directions and asked me the same whether it was in the direction of Gao Xing, Xuan Yuan, or Sheng Nong. My answer remained the same. I knew she already foresaw that one day Gao Xing would battle with Xuan Yuan but she didn\u2019t want people to be sacrificed like her and Qi Yo. So she placed all her hopes with me to do the right thing and avoid the bloodshed.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at the map and mulled over what his Auntie said.The Grand Emperor smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cWhen Zhuan Xu came to Gao Xing, he was young but already had the personality of Qing Yang which was a relief to me. I earnestly trained and taught him even as my officials worried I was training a future enemy. At that time I remembered what Ah Heng said and ignored the officials and continued to nurture Zhuan Xu. I worried the officials would plot to have their children lead him astray so I encouraged Zhuan Xu to travel the commoner world and live as they live. I urged him to travel all through Gao Xing and understand every inch of this land so that one day he could govern it properly.\u201dZhuan Xu stared in confusion, he understood what the Grand Emperor was saying but didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to get at.The Grand Emperor said warmly \u201cZhuan Xu didn\u2019t disappoint me, and even moreso he didn\u2019t let down Qing Yang, Ah Heng, or his parents. Zhuan Xu grew up just like I had hoped. Or no, shall I shall he grew up even better than I expected. The Chang Yi and Bai Hu tribes are angry at me for not training and naming a successor. As the ruler of a kingdom how could I have forgotten to do such an important task. I not only trained a successor to rule Gao Xing, I even trained two good officials to serve him. The three children I raised: Ju Mang is reliable and pulls through, Ru So can be trusted with important tasks, and Zhuan Xu will be tasked with the entire world\u2019s governance.\u201dZhuan Xu tripped over his words \u201cI\u2026.I don\u2019t\u2026.don\u2019t understand what Master means.\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled \u201cSilly child, you\u2019re the successor I prepared to rule Gao Xing!\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s words were casual and light, even teasing, but the three listened where so thunderstruck as to be immobilized. Even the always prepared for any occasion Jing was staring in shock.The Grand Emperor smiled at the expressions of the three kids faces.After a few moments Zhuan Xu said \u201cMaster, did you really mean what you just said?\u201d\u201cDo you think I would joke about something like this? The hundreds of years I spent developing and preparing you, how could that be a joke?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s thoughts were so jumbled \u201cI\u2019m not a Gao Xing person, I am Xuan Yuan born!\u201d\u201cYou see\u00a0a rule that a Xuan Yuan member cannot be the ruler of Gao Xing? You even send your soldiers to put on plays telling of the world being one family, so how can you doubt that now?\u201d\u201cThe court will vehemently object.\u201d\u201cDid they support your invasion of Gao Xing? Would they agree to allow you to conquer Gao Xing and add it to Xuan Yuan rule?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the same!\u201dXiao Yao was fed up \u201cZhuan Xu, when Dad didn\u2019t want you to have it then you would fight for it, now Dad wants to give it to you and you are arguing against it. What do you mean? Do you think something tastes better only if you s.n.a.t.c.h it by force so you want to keep the war going?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean that! I just\u2026.\u201d Zhuan Xu took a deep breath \u201cI just feel like such a small person right now, ashamed and unable to immediately accept.\u201dThe Grand Emperor laughed out and pointed at Zhuan Xu \u201cHis candor right now is so much like Qing Yang. Both the Yellow Emperor and I would have never admitted that.\u201dXiao Yao felt all the dark clouds lifting and smiled \u201cDad, since you already wanted to give the throne to Zhuan Xu, why not tell him? Why make him into the smaller person and have to attack Gao Xing?\u201dThe Grand Emperor explained \u201cI may have reached this decision and the people of Gao Xing may be able to accept any ruler as long as he brings peace and prosperity. But Zhuan Xu is right in pointing out the court officials would never agree to it and I can\u2019t influence such a powerful faction alone. Zhuan Xu needs to use his might to make them obey at the tip of the sword, where they are faced with loss or gain before they will all accept. Like the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes, haven\u2019t they already accepted Zhuan Xu as their Emperor after weighing their pros and cons?\u201dZhuan Xu grumbled \u201cI thought I got the better end of the bargain, who knew they did.\u201dThe Grand Emperor asked \u201cWhat did you promise them?\u201dZhuan Xu dejectedly explained the terms of the agreement, thinking the Grand Emperor would get angry and yell at him but who knew he said \u201cThat\u2019s about what I thought, you did well in not allowing them to intermarry so later when they become regional kings they will counterbalance each other.\u201dZhuan Xu felt bad and asked \u201cWhat will happen to the Qing Long and Yi He tribes? They loyally followed Master the entire time.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cI\u2019ve lived my whole life on Five G.o.ds Mountain and am tired of it. I want a mountain range from you.\u201d\u201cWhich mountain?\u201d\u201cI want to move to Xuan Yuan Mountain and the Yi He and Qing Long tribes will follow me. Please give them territory near the Xuan Yuan Mountain.\u201dXuan Yuan Mountain was vastly important territory in the Xuan Yuan Kingdom and currently belonged to the Yellow Emperor. Xiao Yao thought exchanging Five G.o.ds Mountain for Xuan Yuan Mountain was an even trade. That\u2019s not how Zhuan Xu or Jing saw it \u2013 the Grand Emperor moving to Xuan Yuan Mountain was telling the entire world that his position is as important as the Yellow Emperor, telling the world that Gao Xing did not get conquered. It was similar to the Yellow Emperor\u2019s abdication many years ago when he gave up Xuan Yuan Mountain and moved to Sheng Nong Mountain. Both rulers did not want the officials to have options, to see the kingdom as having two rulers, so they both definitively ended that possibility. It allowed Zhuan Xu\u2019s rule to be smoother and eliminated unnecessary bloodshed.An even deeper reason was the Grand Emperor purposely splitting Gao Xing in two this way. One half stays in Gao Xing and the other half leaves with him to move to Xuan Yuan Mountain. After future generations of intermarriage the dialects and customs would all gradually mesh until one day the Gao Xing citizens would completely be part of the Xuan Yuan people. This was the same reason Zhuan Xu took his time in attacking and has his people govern the Gao Xing castles and towns under Xuan Yuan rule sagely to allow the Gao Xing people to get used to the Xuan Yuan customs.Zhuan Xu was so touched but didn\u2019t want his Master to leave his homeland \u201cMaster, you needn\u2019t do this. The climate and environs of Xuan Yuan Mountain is vastly different than Five G.o.ds Mountain\u2026..\u201dThe Grand Emperor cut him off with a wave of the hand \u201cSheng Nong Mountain is vastly different than Xuan Yuan Mountain yet the Yellow Emperor is living there just fine. I hear the Yellow Emperor\u2019s health is even better than before. The importance of Xuan Yuan Mountain cannot be overstated so many will object but if you dare give it to me then I will be very comforted.\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cZhuan Xu, I really do want to leave Five G.o.ds Mountain. There are the reasons you have already thought of but I also have my own selfish considerations. My father\u2019s shadow is everywhere on Five G.o.ds Mountain, every flower and every pond was crafted by him. I can see him everywhere I go. I didn\u2019t grow up here so I don\u2019t have any happy memories here. Thinking of the past here only brings back all the conspiracies and the deaths and I\u2019m tired! Xuan Yuan Mountain may have no memories for me but Qing Yang, Chang Yi, and Ah Heng grew up there so I\u2019m very familiar with Cao Yun Peak and won\u2019t feel lonely there.\u201dThe Grand Emperor\u2019s eyes showed his weariness \u201cThere, I likely won\u2019t have any more nightmares.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cZhuan Xu, just say yes to Dad!\u201dZhuan Xu got on his knees and bowed his head hard on the ground with his face pressed low, not getting up for a long time. When he learned the truth of how his father died there was a part of him that couldn\u2019t forgive his master but today all the reservations and anger was completely washed away.Zhuan Xu could forgive Little Zhu Rong but not Master because Little Zhu Rong had no connection with him but his master took him in when he was in peril. He raised him for two hundred years and his master\u2019s face had long since merged with his memory of his dad. Because he saw his master as his father now, that is why he couldn\u2019t so easily forgive him. But now all the resentment was gone leaving only the comfort and grat.i.tude of love. The Grand Emperor really did do his job as a dad and take care of everything for Zhuan Xu leaving him like any child in this world who could never repay the parental care.The Grand Emperor had Xiao Yao help Zhuan Xu up.Jing saw the Grand Emperor had been talking for a long time and worried he was tired so brought over a cup of peach juice. The Grand Emperor took a sip and continued \u201cNow that the official matters are done, let\u2019s discuss some personal items.\u201dZhuan Xu and Xiao Yao stared at the Grand Emperor who glanced first at Jing \u201cXiao Yao doesn\u2019t need me to worry about her. I just have to prepare her dowry and wait for her to get married. But my other daughter\u2026..\u201d The Grand Emperor sighed \u201cShe leaves me with a headache and worry. Zhuan Xu, who should I marry her off to?\u201dXiao Yao burst out laughing while Zhuan Xu awkwardly answered \u201cI thought Master wanted to marry Ah Nian to Ru So.\u201d\u201cRu So? He would be willing to die for me in battle before he would agree to marry Ah Nian. Even if he agreed Ah Nian would never marry him.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cThen keep on looking.\u201d\u201cSince you left Gao Xing I have been looking, for the past hundred years and still she hasn\u2019t found one she likes.\u201d The Grand Emperor rubbed his forehead and sighed \u201cIt\u2019s even more exhausting dealing with her than dealing with the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes! I said it all, logic and persuasion, and even hoped that your war against Gao Xing would end her feelings. Who knew she was so persistent and still only wants you! Zhuan Xu, tell me what I should do with her?\u201dZhuan Xu lowered his head while Xiao Yao was giggling and sprawled next to the Grand Emperor.He asked Xiao Yao \u201cWhat do you think Dad should do?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cWhat does my little sister want?\u201d\u201cOf course she wants to marry that Zhuan Xu.\u201d\u201cDad doesn\u2019t object?\u201d\u201cWill my objection change anything? I\u2019ve objected tens of years and now I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve figured it out and decided to just go with it. Life may be long but it\u2019s her life, why not give in to her and let her have what she wants. Xiao Yao, do you agree with Dad?\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and nodded. Ah Nian would be unhappy her entire life if she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, if she was given what she wanted at least Zhuan Xu would always remember his grat.i.tude to her dad and treat her well.The Grand Emperor asked \u201cXiao Yao, do you think that Zhuan Xu would agree to marry my daughter?\u201dXiao Yao saw that the Grand Emperor was serious so couldn\u2019t help but laugh. They say the world pities the parents worry and even the Grand Emperor can\u2019t avoid it! Ah Nian is the Gao Xing princess, her marrying Zhuan Xu would even more legitimately help Zhuan Xu unite Gao Xing with Xuan Yuan. But the Grand Emperor would never use his daughter\u2019s marriage as a political bargaining chip which is why he first discussed official matters before changing the subject to Ah Nian\u2019s marriage and emphasized that this was a personal issue. He also didn\u2019t want to ask Zhuan Xu directly and pressure him so he had Xiao Yao act as the intermediary.Xiao Yao tugged Zhuan Xu\u2019s sleeved \u201cHey you, do you agree to marry my Dad\u2019s daughter?\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and felt the absurdity of the world on him. If years ago he didn\u2019t help Tu Shan Jing get close to Xiao Yao, if back then he made his feelings for Xiao Yao clear like Tu Shan Jing, if he never let her hand go\u2026\u2026..would the \u201cmy dad\u2019s daughter\u201d that Xiao Yao was asking about today be referring to herself and not Ah Nian? Would he then happily yell \u201cYes!\u201d and not once again forced to agree to marry another woman in front of Xiao Yao?Zhuan Xu kept his head lowered and said nothing so Xiao Yao stuck her head in his lap and stared up at him \u201cZhuan Xu?\u201dZhuan Xu lifted his head with a smile \u201cAs long as Master doesn\u2019t object then I of course will be willing. Except\u2026\u2026..Ah Nian is the Princess and I already have an Empress.\u201dThe Grand Emperor already considered this problem \u201cI\u2019ve only heard of one kingdom cannot have two rulers, never heard of one kingdom cannot have two empresses. If you can make Xing Yue Empress then you can also make Ah Nian Empress.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly remembered what the Yellow Emperor privately discussed with Ah Nian years ago when Xing Yue was going to be Empress and then Ah Nian quietly went back to Gao Xing. Did the Yellow Emperor also have the same idea back then? Xiao Yao suddenly yelled \u201cI agree, I agree! My little sister of course has to be an Empress!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao and while his smile deepened but his eyes were dark like two unending wells with no light. Xiao Yao suddenly felt this odd sensation so she yelled \u201cWhat? What did I say wrong?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cNo, you said nothing wrong. I will marry Ah Nian using the pomp and circ.u.mstance of marrying my Empress and give her the same position as Xing Yue.\u201dThe Grand Emperor said \u201cI will move to Xuan Yuan\u00a0Mountain and this palace will now belong to you. I suggest you give one palace to Ah Nian since she grew up here. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with her personality living with the daughter of the Sheng Nong family and causing you problems. Why don\u2019t the two empresses each live on one mountain, Xing Yue on Sheng Nong Mountain and Ah Nian on Five G.o.ds Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao clapped \u201cWhat a great idea!\u201d She was just getting worried about Ah Nian dealing with all those wives on Zhi Jin Summit, who knew her dad already had plans. Once Gao Xing became part of Xuan Yuan then Zhuan Xu would have to visit annually to govern in person. Even if he lived just one month a year on Five G.o.ds Mountain, that was one month when he belonged completely to Ah Nian.Zhuan Xu smiled \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! I was worried about how to placate the Middle Plains families but this would solve everything.\u201dXiao Yao inwardly sighed. Even if her dad was just trying to marry a daughter, if Ah Nian didn\u2019t have such a powerful dad and all of Gao Xing behind her, how can she get an entire palace? The Grand Emperor pa.s.sed his throne to Zhuan Xu unrelated to Ah Nian, but the world might see the Grand Emperor as giving his daughter the biggest dowry in the world. If the Grand Emperor handed an entire kingdom to Zhuan Xu as dowry for Ah Nian, then even the Middle Plains families could not complain or object to making her an empress as well.The Grand Emperor turned to Xiao Yao \u201cI\u2019m hungry, go see what\u2019s to eat and bring me a couple dishes.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d Xiao Yao walked outside and Jing knew it was intentional to divert her so joined her.After both Xiao Yao and Jing left, the Grand Emperor stared at Zhuan Xu \u201cYou\u2019re not happy to marry Ah Nian.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s smile lessened \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to Master, Ah Nian is not the woman I love. But just like Consort Jing An is not the woman Master loves, but I will treat Ah Nian with the same affection and care as Master treats Consort Jing An. I will give Ah Nian a lifetime of comfort and peace.\u201dThe Grand Emperor was not surprised Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t love Ah Nian in that way and sighed \u201cYou remember this promise you made today.\u201d He knew that between Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian, the person who was happier in this marriage would be Ah Nian.Zhuan Xu\u2019s face revealed his desolation \u201cMaster, what does it feel like to marry the woman you love.\u201dThe Grand Emperor smiled sadly \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Master marry Auntie?\u201d\u201cWhen I married her I didn\u2019t love her yet, by the time I fell in love with her, she already saw herself as Qi Yo\u2019s wife.\u201dZhuan Xu sighed \u201cSo even Master doesn\u2019t know!\u201dThe Grand Emperor joined him and sighed \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dZhuan Xu sadly continued \u201cSometimes I feel like my life is so absurd. I moved an entire garden of flowers into my backyard but the only flower I want isn\u2019t there. Just that one I want isn\u2019t there! When in actually I don\u2019t even want an entire backyard full of flowers, I just want that one flower!\u201dThe Grand Emperor patted Zhuan Xu on the shoulder because only he understood how much sadness and suffering lay underneath Zhuan Xu\u2019s calm composure. To sit in the highest chair, it appeared one had it all but there wasn\u2019t a single marriage that was what Zhuan Xu really wanted. Each time he married to resolve an impa.s.se or avoid bloodshed\u2026..if years ago he could have suffered in marriage like Zhuan Xu, perhaps the Gao Xing tribes would not be fighting near a civil war now.Xiao Yao and Jing wandered outside the pavilion and she said \u201cYears ago you told me \u2018Zhuan Xu is not the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Emperor is not Qi Yo.\u2019 You wanted me not to think of the worst case scenario and I didn\u2019t believe you then but now I really understand what you meant.\u201dJing said \u201cThe critical element is that the Xuan Yuan kingdom now is not the same as it was before.\u201d\u201cA battle hinges on the smarter general, a war hinges on the more powerful kingdom. Right now most of the world belongs to Xuan Yuan so it\u2019s more wealthy and has more resources. Eventually Gao Xing will be ruled by Xuan Yuan which is why the Black Emperor chose to fight a slow war of attrition. From the day Zhuan Xu declared war, Gao Xing was doomed to be conquered. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the smart choice for the Grand Emperor to pa.s.s the throne to Zhuan Xu\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao covered her heard \u201cNot listening! So many things sound worse when you a.n.a.lyze it!\u201dJing grabbed Xiao Yao to avoid a low branch and laughed \u201cThe tides cannot be changed but the choices made can impact how it happens. Without the Black Emperor\u2019s restraint and the Grand Emperor\u2019s foresight, it\u2019s hard to have such a happy ending for all that is happening now.\u201dXiao Yao glanced back in the pavilion \u201cWhat do you think they are talking about? Are they done yet?\u201dJing could tell she couldn\u2019t wait so said with a laugh \u201cLet\u2019s go check.\u201dXiao Yao immediately ran back inside while hollering \u201cDad!\u201dZhuan Xu walked to the door and gestured her inside. Xiao Yao ran inside and reached Zhuan Xu before realizing her hands were empty. She turned and saw Jing carrying a basket of food.Xiao Yao placed the dishes before the Grand Emperor with a smile \u201cDid Ah Nian really go the battle?\u201d\u201cShe really went. Regardless of my plans, the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes betrayal must be punished.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJu Mang is with her.\u201d\u201cThat means Ah Nian will emerge victorious then?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat happens afterwards?\u201dThe Grand Emperor glanced at Zhuan Xu who smiled and popped a snack in his mouth \u201cAfter the battle is won, Master will announce that Ah Nian is marrying me. That\u2019s the best of both worlds as Ah Nian will be the Gao Xing Princess who punished the betrayers, but she\u2019s also going to be the next Xuan Yuan Empress so even if she vanquished the two tribes it\u2019s like she\u2019s battling for me. It won\u2019t force me to avenge their defeat.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cEveryone thinks the battle is so earthshattering, who can expect it\u2019ll be followed by a ma.s.sive wedding.\u201dIn the middle of winter, on the 17th, the Gao Xing Princess who went to war for her father successfully defeated the Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes. On the same day the Xuan Yuan Black Emperor sent Chi Sui Feng Long as envoy to Five G.o.ds Mountain for the hand in marriage of the Gao Xing Princess and the Grand Emperor agreed.With the wedding set the war between the two kingdoms ended. The Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes went from crying about revenge to shutting up and hoping the Princess didn\u2019t hold a grudge later on.The palace was ready and the dowry was prepared, the two kingdoms discussed and set the wedding date for the coming autumn.Everyone thought the two kingdoms were in close contact to plan the wedding but in truth the Grand Emperor and the Black Emperor was planning the abdication and succession plans.Since Zhuan Xu left Gao Xing, the Grand Emperor had been preparing for this day and many of the people were already prepared. The Grand Emperor told Zhuan Xu to stay in Gao Xing and a.s.sured him Xuan Yuan and Sheng Nong Mountain was already on track and could administer itself for now.The Grand Emperor pa.s.sing the throne to Zhuan Xu appeared to be a nigh impossible task, but under the careful planning and execution of three brilliant rulers it continued step by step without delay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI\u2019m always in awe of writer Tong Hua\u2019s ability to keep the plot moving so briskly and sensibly, on top of creating unforgettable characters in so many of her\u00a0stories.\u00a0Both skills come to play now that Lost You Forever is deep into the third and final volume of the epic novel, with no signs of slowly down or losing steam. Zhuan Xu finally unites the vast wilderness under one rule, finis.h.i.+ng the dream left by his grandfather the Yellow Emperor. Along the way much was sacrificed, from family to love, and the cracks are starting to show in Zhuan Xu\u2019s tight self-control now that he\u2019s gotten to the very top.I really like his character even if my boo is forever Xiang Liu, in many ways Zhuan Xu is the male counterpart to Xiao Yao so we can consider the novel having two main characters in Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu. In that respect, Jing and Xiang Liu are simply the male leads to Xiao Yao whereas Zhuan Xu\u2019s story is just as front and center as Xiao Yao\u2019s journey, and compared to her he\u2019s had it just as rough in different ways. At this point, everyone has gotten what each wants except for Zhuan Xu, so will he continue the status quo or shake things up for a final grasp at his personal happiness? I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not going to watch Xiao Yao leave his side that willingly.Chapter 41 \u2013 Full of Emotion Yet Seeming Emotionless:Even though Zhuan Xu already married many women, Xiao Yao had actually never prepared a wedding present for him before. Every time Zhuan Xu had one prepared on her behalf and Maio Pu send it out in her name. Many times Xiao Yao didn\u2019t even know what the present was.This time it was the wedding of Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian and also the first time Xiao Yao prepared a present personally. She really wanted Zhuan Xu and Ah Nian to be happy, even if she knew Zhuan Xu could get everything in this world but the simplest of happiness might be beyond his reach. So while she was wis.h.i.+ng for Zhuan Xu to make Ah Nian happy, she was also hoping Ah Nian could bring some happiness to Zhuan Xu. At least Ah Nian grew up with Zhuan Xu and was not like all his other women.The night before the wedding, Zhuan Xu walked in as Xiao Yao was inspecting the wedding present.Xiao Yao spread her arms and blocked the view of the present \u201cDon\u2019t look, you\u2019re not allowed to look. This is for you to open with Ah Nian.\u201dZhuan Xu wasn\u2019t interested in the slightest, not even sparing it a glance, before grabbing Xiao Yao outside with him \u201cGo walk with me in Qi Qing Garden.\u201dXiao Yao was dejected \u201cYou don\u2019t even care about my present.\u201d\u201cYes! I don\u2019t care because I don\u2019t even want it!\u201dZhuan Xu took giant strides\u00a0so Xiao Yao had to run to catch up. It wasn\u2019t until entering Qi Qing Garden did Zhuan Xu slow down. Xiao Yao raised her head to look at Zhuan Xu \u201cDid you drink? You\u2019re not drunk, are you?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Zhuan Xu coldly scoffed \u201cTomorrow is not just any wedding, it\u2019s when the Xuan Yuan Emperor marries the Gao Xing Princess. The armies inside the Gao Xing borders and at the outskirts combined are greater than a hundred thousand men. This is a matter as important as the world, what right do I have to get drunk!\u201dXiao Yao stared quizzically at Zhuan Xu \u201cI thought you would be a little happy at least to marry Ah Nian. In your heart, is Ah Nian the same as all the women living on Zhi Jin Summit?\u201d\u201cAh Nian is not the same as them! But that not the same is also not the same as me wanting to marry to her!\u201d Zhuan Xu angrily punched the water and sent a water spout into the air before the drops fell back down.In the past, Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t want to get married either but he controlled his emotions well, but this time he was losing control so Xiao Yao asked \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to this much, why did you agree?\u201dZhuan Xu turned and stared angrily at Xiao Yao \u201cWhy did I agree? Don\u2019t you all think I would naturally agree? Did you even care what I wanted? All you cared about was that Ah Nian got to marry me! In your mind, I already had so many women, it wouldn\u2019t matter to add one more Ah Nian!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s temper flared up \u201cBut isn\u2019t that the truth? There are so many women on Zhi Jin Summit, what\u2019s the difference in adding one more? Years ago you could happily marry Xing Yue, compared to her Ah Nian isn\u2019t any bit worse off. Has Ah Nian given you less than Xing Yue did? She is bringing to you the peace and stability of all of Gao Xing!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s expression was dark and livid, his chest rising and falling fast as he pressed closer to Xiao Yao step by step \u201cWhen was I ever happy to marry Xing Yue? You tell me now what kind of happy I was to marry her!\u201dXiao Yao took steps back and remembered that she ran back to Gao Xing during that wedding so she never watched Zhuan Xu get married. She sheepishly said \u201cThe tea houses of Gao Xing said your wedding was lavish and exciting, the entire world saw you happy and thrilled!\u201dXiao Yao backed up to the pavilion support beam and had nowhere else to go but Zhuan Xu continued to stalk towards her. Xiao Yao sat down on the steps and pressed up against the beam \u201cZhuan Xu, don\u2019t act drunk as an excuse to throw a fit! If you have the guts then you throw this fit tomorrow in front of the wedding guests!\u201dZhuan Xu pressed both arms on the beam and encircled Xiao Yao right in front of him, bending down until he was face-to-face with her and spit out each word clearly \u201cLet me tell you, each time I\u2019ve gotten married I\u2019ve been miserable. The time I married Xing Yue, I was so miserable I hated myself, and even hated you!\u201dXiao Yao leaned back acting like she was going to kick him off \u201cLet me tell you, if you keep acting up I\u2019m going to fight back!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao as his head slowly lowered. Xiao Yao stared with her eyes wide as saucers \u201cI\u2019m going to kick you!\u201dJust as Zhuan Xu\u2019s lips was about to touch Xiao Yao, he suddenly turned his face and rested it on Xiao Yao\u2019s shoulder, breathing heavily.Xiao Yao softly asked \u201cZhuan Xu, what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201dZhuan Xu raised his head and lightly rubbed Xiao Yao\u2019s head before sitting down beside her \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t have the ability to do as you said! So tomorrow I\u2019ll let the world see my happy face!\u201d If he had the ability, then why would he have needed the Tu Shan and Chi Sui clans many years ago to help him win the throne, and in the process handed Xiao Yao to them with his own hands.Xiao Yao looked at Zhuan Xu but his face was turned away so she couldn\u2019t see his expression \u201cWhy are you so upset today? In the past I can understand your feelings but right now I don\u2019t have a clue. Fine, I\u2019ll admit I only thought about Ah Nian and didn\u2019t consider what you wanted. But I really thought\u2026\u2026one more wouldn\u2019t make any difference!\u201d\u201cXiao Yao!\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice contained his rising anger.Xiao Yao quickly added \u201cDon\u2019t be like this! If you really don\u2019t want to marry Ah Nian then let\u2019s find a way to call off the wedding.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and then said calmly \u201cHow to cancel? The wedding is tomorrow and the entire world knows it. One hundred thousand soldiers are standing by. One wrong move and the world descends into chaos, and Ah Nian will hate you and me forever!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t care if Ah Nian hates me, or hundred thousand soldiers, or world peace, all I care about is that if you\u2019re not willing then I will support you! Let\u2019s find a way, we can find a way together.\u201dFor him, Xiao Yao was willing to risk her life, and be at odds with the entire world. But she wanted to live the rest of her life with another man. Zhuan Xu started laughing, and it wasn\u2019t clear if his laughter was sorrow or joy.Xiao Yao jumped up \u201cI\u2019m going to find my dad!\u201dZhuan Xu stopped her with a smile \u201cThere are already tons of women on Zhi Jin Summit, it really doesn\u2019t matter to add one more. I just drank too much today but am fine now!\u201dXiao Yao stared at Zhuan Xu who patted the spot next to him so she sat down. Zhuan Xu said \u201cSame rules, don\u2019t prepare a present for me, don\u2019t say congratulations, and tomorrow don\u2019t even show up at the wedding!\u201d\u201cBut how am I going to explain to Ah Nian and my dad?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the Princess stricken from the Gao Xing royal family register, your attendance is what would be awkward.\u201dEven though Xiao Yao really cared about Ah Nian and the Grand Emperor, but neither was as important to her as Zhuan Xu so she said \u201cFine, tomorrow I\u2019ll hide myself away.\u201dZhuan Xu lazily leaned against the beam and used his fingers to flick at the lake, and with each flick he would send a power surge into the water and a spray would burst from the surface.Xiao Yao wrapped her arms around her knees and stared at the water bursts on the lake, and after some time suddenly asked \u201cYou were never happy even once?\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s answer was immediate \u201cNever.\u201d\u201cI think you will be happy one of these days, eventually you\u2019ll meet a woman you love.\u201d\u201cI also want to know what it feels like to marry a woman I love. I want to feel genuine happiness, I want to accept other people\u2019s congratulations with true joy.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart hurt and she said \u201cYou will!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cI believe that too, I believe if I have the patience to keep waiting then I will wait for that day to come.\u201d\u201cYes, it will come. But when that day arrives, you can\u2019t treat Ah Nian poorly because of her.\u201dZhuan Xu tenderly smiled at Xiao Yao so she sa.s.sed \u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cWhen I marry her, I will listen to her on everything.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yao jabbed her finger at Zhuan Xu \u201cYou\u2026\u2026you have some backbone, will you? What do you mean listen to her on everything? You\u2019re the ruler of an entire kingdom!\u201dZhuan Xu drawled \u201cThis is different than having no backbone. As long as I marry her, then I will take her side on everything. Whatever makes her unhappy, I won\u2019t do it.\u201dXiao Yao started pinching him to get the point across \u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t like me, or she says bad things about me? Will you listen to her then?\u201dZhuan Xu was laughing so hard his shoulders were shaking so Xiao Yao demanded \u201cAnswer me!\u201d Zhuan Xu kept staring at Xiao Yao and saying nothing so Xiao Yao continued to threaten him \u201cTell me clearly now! When that day comes, are you going to listen to her or listen to me?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I listen to both?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cMaybe both will have the same point of view?\u201d\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not the same?\u201d\u201cWhat if there is never a case when it\u2019s not the same?\u201dXiao Yao grew anxious \u201cZhuan Xu, tell me now so that I can make preparations for the day when I\u2019m not in your good graces anymore!\u201d\u201cThen of course I will listen to\u2026\u2026..\u201d Zhuan Xu paused \u201c\u2026.you!\u201cOh! That\u2019s more like it!\u201d Xiao Yao breathed a sigh of relief before realizing how immature she was being. But then she saw how Zhuan Xu\u2019s expression had lightened up and he seemed very happy, so it was worth being teased by him.Xiao Yao asked \u201cFeeling better?\u201d Zhuan Xu nodded. Xiao Yao added \u201cThen when you\u2019re unhappy tomorrow, think of all that you\u2019ve accomplished, and even if you\u2019re unhappy you can still make Ah Nian happy!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao so she quickly added \u201cIt\u2019s not that I care about Ah Nian more than you. It\u2019s just that this is the best way for you\u2026\u2026oh you know what I mean.\u201dZhuan Xu could have said \u201cOkay\u201d or \u201cSure\u201d, but he instead answered \u201cI\u2019ll listen to you\u201d, clearly still remembering their earlier conversation. Xiao Yao laughed and smacked him.Zhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s fist in one hand and the other pressed on the beam behind Xiao Yao\u2019s head, smiling down at her \u201cQi Qing Garden is your favorite spot on Five G.o.ds Mountain. Going forward I\u2019ll construct a replica of Qi Qing Garden on Xiao Yue Peak on Sheng Nong Mountain for you.\u201dXiao Yao understood Zhuan Xu\u2019s intention, even though her mom was long gone, her dad still maintained the places her mom frequented to remain exactly the same. But from now on this place no longer belonged to her dad, and Ah Nian would naturally renovate it based on her own wishes. All the memories that belonged to Xiao Yao were gradually getting lost.Xiao Yao stared at the bamboo forest in the distance and said nothing. After a pause she smiled and shook her head.It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want it, but Xiao Yue Peak wasn\u2019t her permanent residence either so why waste the effort? She could consider having Jing build her a Qi Qing Garden in Qing Qiu.Zhuan Xu turned his head aside, the smile still lingered on his lips but his eyes were cold.The two sat there in silence, each thinking their own thoughts, until Xiao Yao said \u201cLet\u2019s go back and rest, tomorrow you have to rise early.\u201dThe two stepped out of the pavilion to see that the stars were blanketing the sky. Both slowed their steps at the same time. When they were small, during the summer after bathing, they would play in the outside corridors and then lay down to look at the stars above when they got tired.Zhuan Xu softly said \u201cOften I would miss the days on Cao Yun Peak, but back then Cao Yun Peak didn\u2019t belong to me and I had no power to keep you beside me.\u201d He vividly remembered when Auntie was sending Xiao Yao away and he begged to have her stay, promising to take care of Xiao Yao, but his Auntie answered that he didn\u2019t have the power to protect himself much less her.Xiao Yao was silent but her expression was solemn and sad. She arrived at her residence and said \u201cIt\u2019s all in the past! Now Xuan Yuan Mountain, Sheng Nong Mountain, and Five G.o.ds Mountain all belong to you.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cYes, all belongs to me!\u201dXiao Yao felt that Zhuan Xu\u2019s smile didn\u2019t have any happiness in it so she worried asked \u201cTomorrow\u2019s wedding\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu waved his hands for her to go inside \u201cHave I ever screwed anything up? Go rest and have Miao Pu and Xiao Xiao take you out to sea tomorrow to play.\u201dXiao Yao thought and realized that from childhood until now Zhuan Xu had never made a single mistake! She was relieved so nodded her head and went inside.Zhuan Xu slowly walked under the stars \u2013 yes, he would never make a mistake, because only when he never made any mistakes could Xiao Yao make as many mistakes as she wanted. It was why she could be Qi Yo\u2019s daughter and still live without a care in the world.Zhuan Xu said in his heart: Auntie, do I have enough ability now to protect myself, and to protect Xiao Yao?In mid-Autumn, at the bright of noon, the Xuan Yuan Black Emperor Zhuan Xu took the Gao Xing Princess Gao Xing Yi as his Empress.On the day after the wedding, the Grand Emperor summoned his officials and announced his abdication due to his ill health, pa.s.sing the throne to Zhuan Xu for the future of all Gao Xing people.The court was in an uproar but since the Chang Yi and Bao Hu tribes already defected to Zhuan Xu, and the Qing Long and Yi He tribes supported the Grand Emperor, as well as the Emperor\u2019s Five G.o.ds Army, the remaining dissenters had no choice but to accept the reality.Under the protection and escort of hundreds of armed soldiers, Zhuan Xu became the Emperor of Gao Xing. The war between Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan ended, the two kingdoms merged under the authority of the Black Emperor.From then on, nearly the entire vast wilderness was under the control of the Black Emperor.But this was not a successful end but a difficult beginning, as now there were three tribes bickering for power with Zhuan Xu. But his path to power was always difficult so his personality developed to being forgiving and generous, intelligent and thoughtful, and he used his vast wisdom to handle all the complaints and conflicts and resolve it one by one.Zhuan Xu did not marginalize Ru So, who defeated the Xuan Yuan army time and again during the war, and instead used him greatly as his loyal official. Even the officials who disagreed with him in the past were not punished and Zhuan Xu continued to listen to their opinions. For those few who harbored ill will and fomented discord, Zhuan Xu did not hesitate and punished them harshly.Under the support and guidance of the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Emperor, Zhuan Xu got past the most difficult phase until all the officials understood and accepted that he truly was the Emperor to all.After Zhuan Xu\u2019s wedding, Xiao Yao lived on Five G.o.ds Mountain a bit longer until she was confident that the Grand Emperor\u2019s health was fine. After abdicating, he managed to stabilize his healthy but real recovery could not come until he left everything behind on Five G.o.ds Mountain.Seeing that the Grand Emperor was doing well, Xiao Yao decided to go back to the Middle Plains first with Jing. Arriving on Sheng Nong Mountain, she saw it was still the same, the exuberance of Five G.o.ds Mountain didn\u2019t reach all the way there.Xiao Yao asked the Yellow Emperor \u201cXing Yue didn\u2019t object?\u201d The Yellow Emperor casually answered \u201cOf course she\u2019s not happy but she\u2019s a smart woman. She can\u2019t stop it and knows it doesn\u2019t affect her position here. It\u2019s better than Zhuan Xu marrying Ah Nian and bringing her back to Xuan Yuan Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and agreed. Ah Nian lived on the far away Five G.o.ds Mountain, and even if Zhuan Xu needed to be there more in the coming years until Gao Xing was fully stabilized and integrated, he would still be spending the majority of his time on Sheng Nong Mountain. So in reality Ah Nian may also have the Empress t.i.tle and Five G.o.ds Mountain, but Ah Nian wouldn\u2019t be wielding real Empress authority or take away anything from Xing Yue.Xiao Yao mused \u201cDad really is wise, he knew that only by letting go of everything could he ensure Ah Nian\u2019s happiness and peace her entire life.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor\u2019s expression grew solemn \u201cVery few can clearly see, even fewer can see clearly and choose to give it all up, and even less do so willingly. In the past I didn\u2019t give him enough credit for his breadth of character. It\u2019s just too bad your mom first met\u2026\u2026\u201d The Yellow Emperor sighed and let his words trail off.Xiao Yao took out a silk pouch and handed it over \u201cZhuan Xu wanted me to give this to you. He said that he doesn\u2019t have time to study it so wanted Grandfather to give it a shot.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor opened the pouch and inside was a jade shaped like half a goose egg. He took out the other half already in his possession and put it together to form a complete jade egg. He sighed, hundreds of years later it was finally complete, the River Drawing Mountain Book. Legend had it that the person possessing it would rule the world. But in truth it was first ruling the world before a person could possess it. No wonder Qi Yo and Zhuan Xu could care less about it.Xiao Yao curiously asked \u201cWhat\u2019s hidden inside?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cI\u2019ve been studying it for hundreds of years and have an idea. Soon we\u2019ll know for sure.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor closed his eyes and injected his power into the jade egg, and after a few moments he opened his eyes and sighed loudly.Xiao Yao asked \u201cGrandfather, what did you see?\u201d\u201cInside is a map of the entire vast wilderness, notes on various spiritual maze construction, and a section of the journal of the Great Emperor Pan Gu.\u201d\u201cLooks like this really contains the personal items left behind by the Great Emperor Pan Gu. What does it say?\u201d\u201cJust notations on what regions with different climates are suitable for planting what crops, much like the medical journal left behind by the Flame Emperor. This contains the things the Great Emperor Pan Gu still hadn\u2019t completed. The mazes are not intended for battle but to a.s.sess the climates of places and help a.n.a.lyze how to plan crops.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and understood \u201cThe Flame Emperor wanted to help heal the world\u2019s ails, while the Great Emperor Pan Gu was thinking of keeping his people from ever being hungry.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor nodded and sighed \u201cSo the secret to ruling the world was never any mystery, to keep the people healthy and fed would then naturally lead to ruling a content world.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor looked out on the fields deep in though. Xiao Yao smiled, her grandfather was going to be busy again. In addition to completing the Flame Emperor\u2019s legacy, he now wanted to complete the Great Emperor Pan Gu\u2019s wish that the people were well fed.The Yellow Emperor put the jade egg away and asked \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201dXiao Yao bowed \u201cYour Majesty, you put all the pains and suffering of the people in your heart, the people will also put you in their hearts. Thousands of years from now you will be like the Flame Emperor, revered and spoken about by all.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor smiled and shook his head \u201cI don\u2019t care about that now, all I care about is doing what I can for the future of the people.\u201dA year later, the Grand Emperor moved to Xuan Yuan Mountain and into Cao Yun Court on Cao Yun Peak. He stripped the t.i.tle of Grand Emperor and henceforth was known as the White Emperor. Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t even know why he did that, but perhaps it was the only way to fully shake off the nightmares of the past or to tell the world that Gao Xing no longer had an Emperor.The Qing Long and Yi He tribes followed the Grand Emperor to Xuan Yuan Mountain, and Zhuan Xu gave them fertile land that formerly belonged to the Xuan Yuan royal family, and further bestowed countless other lavish rewards. Both tribes were initially dejected to leave their homeland behind but after seeing what the Black Emperor rewarded both tribes felt comforted.Both tribes consulted with the oracles during the move for auspicious signs, and the Qing Long tribe received an ominous omen. With the permission of the White Emperor, the Qing Long tribe asked the Black Emperor to bestow a new name for their tribe. Zhuan Xu henceforth bestowed the name of the Qing Yang tribe.Initially no one thought much of it until learned that Qing Yang was the name of the Black Emperor\u2019s eldest uncle. He was also the most favored beloved son of the Yellow Emperor, and also a great hero to the entire Xuan Yuan royal tribe. Even the Great General Ying Long who guarded Xuan Yuan Castle revered Prince Qing Yang, so having that name guaranteed the tribe would be taken care of living in Xuan Yuan.The irony came when the Black Emperor divided the land that originally belonged to the two departed tribes among the remaining Bai Hu and Chang Yi tribes, but then named Ru So as the Great General with his armed forces stationed on those lands. Ru So was known by all to be from the Qing Yang tribe.Everyone knew what a smart underhanded move this was by the Black Emperor, but also impressed with how much trust he had in giving such a powerful army to Ru So without any second guessing or even a surveillance troop overseeing.The Black Emperor further named Ju Mang as another Great General in charge of the Five G.o.ds Army to protect Five G.o.ds Mountain. Both Ju Mang and Ru So were disciples of the Grand Emperor and good friends, so this showed that the Black Emperor\u2019s trust was so great he didn\u2019t worry about them colluding against him. With all this the lingering worries all slowly dissipated.With the vast wilderness under one rule of the Black Emperor, the borders were opened and information and knowledge was freely exchanged.The Yellow Emperor summoned all the famed doctors and healers around the vast wilderness and together with Xiao Yao convinced them to write down all their knowledge to create medical texts for future generations much like the Flame Emperor did in creating the herb medicinal manuals.Without any wars and conflicts, time and the seasons pa.s.sed quickly when there was much to do, and in the blink of an eye fifteen years had pa.s.sed.One night when Zhuan Xu came to Xiao Yue Peak, he saw Xiao Yao and the doctors busily a.s.sembling texts while many more doctors waited outside in exhaustion but looking content. Even the Yellow Emperor seemed anxious, playing Go with Jing but occasionally glancing over.Zhuan stopped in his steps and curiously observed. Moments later someone called out \u201cIt\u2019s done! The last volume is done!\u201dAll the doctors gathered at the door and even the Yellow Emperor stood up. Xiao Yao walked to the Yellow Emperor carrying two stacks of books while the doctors trailed behind her.Xiao Yao kneeled down \u201cWe have not let Your Majesty down. The compendium of medical texts took 42 years to complete with the involvement of hundreds of doctors gathering herbs and testing out the treatments. Thirty eight died falling off cliffs, fifty two disappeared in floods and storms, sixty one died at the hands of beasts and noxious fumes, and seven died at the writing desk still holding their pens and writing down medical knowledge.\u201dAll the doctors and Xiao Yao started to cry silent tears as she lifted the books in her hands \u201cThere are a total of fifty five volumes of medical texts, split into two parts. Part 1 is 37 books containing all the herbs and usage methodology to heal, and Part 2 is 18 books that help prevent illness and promote health. Will Your Majesty please name the text!\u201dTo build a kingdom, to conquer far and wide, to reunite the Middle Plains, a.s.sa.s.sinations and abdications, the Yellow Emperor experienced every single momentous event in the vast wilderness and was never affected, but this time his hands were shaking as he reached for the books.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cThis set of medical texts may have been accomplished because I a.s.sembled all the doctors, but it was due to the Black Emperor uniting the vast wilderness that all the doctors could work together and travel freely to collect the information. So Zhuan Xu, you name the text!\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t turn him down and walked over to the Yellow Emperor. He picked up the pen and thought for a moment before writing on Part 1 \u201cThe Yellow Emperor External Medicine Treatise\u201d, and then writing on Part 2 \u201cThe Yellow Emperor Internal Medicine Treatise.\u201dWith such simple words he gave birth to the world two priceless medical texts and everyone gathered cheered.The Yellow Emperor paused before breaking into a laugh. With the completion of the medical texts the world can rejoice, and with having a grandson like Zhuan Xu, he can rejoice!With this project completed, Xiao Yao\u2019s busy life suddenly ended and she was so excited to do nothing again. She decided to go to Xuan Yuan Mountain to pay a visit to the White Emperor.The White Emperor was looking well, likely from having no political matters to deal with, but he still carried a limp from waiting too long to treat it.Xiao Yao was upset about that but the White Emperor laughed \u201cI\u2019m an old man now, no girl will spare me a second glance, so who cares if I walk a little ugly. I\u2019d rather Jing\u2019s leg get healed if there is a way.\u201dJing just smiled and said nothing more so this issue wasn\u2019t mentioned again.The Yellow Emperor resided on Xiao Yue Peak and never left, calling doctors to write medical texts while he used the mazes left by the Great Emperor Pan Gu to conjure up different climate zones on the Peak so he could experiment with planting different crops. The Yellow Emperor was only interested in his crops and nothing else outside of the Peak.The White Emperor was the opposite, he didn\u2019t stay on Xuan Yuan Mountain at all, instead always traveling around and even took Xiao Yao and Jing down the mountain with him.The White Emperor opened a blacksmith shop in a desolate alley in Xuan Yuan Castle. He made anything and everything other than weapons. The location was out of the way but his skill was unparallel so after tens of years it was so renowned that every day there were customers coming to place an order. The White Emperor was friendly and solicitous so all the folks liked this handsome old man.If he wasn\u2019t forging, he was drinking at an old wine shop while playing Go with an old musician, with the White Emperor losing more often than not. The old musician was so happy and suggested \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped that you don\u2019t have the natural apt.i.tude, this is already hard for ordinary folks to learn. Do you know who invented it? It was the Yellow Emperor! I\u2019m descended from an ill.u.s.trious family so that\u2019s how I learned a little.\u201dThe White Emperor just smiled as the old musician proudly twirled his mustache.Beside the blacksmith shop there was a large tree, with firewood stacked underneath. Jing helped the White Emperor chop firewood while Xiao Yao sat on a stump and stared at this completely foreign White Emperor. Was he the same White Emperor who never smiled on Five G.o.ds Mountain and even one cutting look could frighten an entire court of officials?Jing finished cutting firewood and sat down beside Xiao Yao. She murmured \u201cHow did he become a completely different person? If Ju Mang and Ru So saw him now they would die from shock!\u201dJing said \u201cPerhaps he is back to being who he really was, the White Emperor that your Eldest Uncle Qing Yang met was probably just like this.\u201d\u201cPerhaps!\u201d There was plenty of good wine on Xuan Yuan Mountain but he wanted to drink cheap wine, it couldn\u2019t be the taste but likely the memories he was seeking. Was that shop really over a thousand years old, and could he have drank there with her Eldest Uncle? Xiao Yao signed \u201cInitially I worried he wouldn\u2019t get used to living on Xuan Yuan Mountain but clearly my worry was for naught. I think us being here is distracting him, let\u2019s leave tomorrow!\u201dBack to Sheng Nong Mountain, Xiao Yao felt odd now that she had nothing to do. She discussed with Jing \u201cShall we go to Zhe Province to open a clinic?\u201dJing said \u201cHow about open a clinic in Qing Qiu?\u201d\u201cBut Zhe Province is closer, Qing Qiu is farther away and a ha.s.sle making a trip daily.\u201d\u201cIf you lived in Qing Qiu, then it would be close and convenient.\u201d\u201cWhat? Me live in Qing Qiu?\u201d It took Xiao Yao a few moments to understand as Jing laughed \u201cThe Tu Shan residence in Qing Qiu is all arranged and ready for a wedding.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face gradually turned red as Jing took her hand \u201cXiao Yao, let\u2019s get married! From the moment we got engaged I\u2019ve been looking forward to marrying you.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart surged with sweetness as she lightly nodded her head.With her agreement, that night Jing discussed the wedding plans with the Yellow Emperor and the Black Emperor. Jing couldn\u2019t explain why but he always got the sense that the Yellow Emperor was happy he was marrying Xiao Yao, but the Black Emperor was not.But that made no sense as it was the Black Emperor that helped pa.s.s word for him and Xiao Yao long ago when they couldn\u2019t communicate freely. And after arriving on Sheng Nong Mountain, it was with the Black Emperor\u2019s allowance that he could meet Xiao Yao on Cao Ao Peak. Without the Black Emperor\u2019s help all along the way, Jing could never have reached this point with Xiao Yao.Jing had calmly a.n.a.lyzed this matter and felt that Zhuan Xu\u2019s att.i.tude changed after the Yi Yang pregnancy incident and Xiao Yao\u2019s serious illness. Likely Zhuan Xu felt he hurt Xiao Yao too much, and did not match up to her as well as Feng Long did. But Zhuan Xu consented to the engagement so Jing could only hope that time will help him convince Zhuan Xu that he would treasure Xiao Yao forever and never make another mistake again.As expected, when Jing brought up setting the wedding date, he saw both Emperors smile but Jing just had this niggling feeling that the Black Emperor wasn\u2019t happy.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cYou two have been engaged for so long, it\u2019s time to get married. I\u2019ve got the dowry all prepared, whenever the Tu Shan clan is ready then the wedding can take place.\u201dJing immediately said \u201cIt\u2019s all readied, the wedding can be tomorrow even!\u201dBoth Emperors laughed as Xiao Yao blushed so Jing quickly explained \u201cTomorrow\u2026.tomorrow is too fast, I meant\u2026.everything is ready is all.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor asked the Black Emperor \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cHave the auspicious days noted for us to consult!\u201d Xiao Xiao went out and came back shortly with the list of upcoming auspicious days. It was pa.s.sed around and the Yellow Emperor asked Jing \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dJing paused and said \u201cA month later is too rushed, how about three months late in mid-Summer.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cA great day!\u201dJing and Xiao Yao turned to Zhuan Xu to wait for his opinion. Zhuan Xu glanced past Jing and Xiao Yao and said with a smile \u201cMid-Summer?\u201d Jing answered \u201cYes.\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t answer for some time as if pondering something. Just as Jing was about to get nervous, Zhuan Xu said in a clear voice \u201cIt\u2019s a good day, set it for that day!\u201dJing smiled as if all the weight was lifted and bowed to both Emperors \u201cThank Your Majesties!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor\u00a0glanced at Zhuan Xu before joking \u201cYou need to thank Xiao Yao, we are loathe to marry her off but she only has you in her eyes so even if we\u2019re sad we\u2019ll do as she wishes and marry her to you.\u201dJing smiled and bowed to Xiao Yao \u201cThank you my lady for agreeing to marry me!\u201dXiao Yao was embarra.s.sed \u201cHow come no one is being serious!\u201d She ran out of the room and felt her face flushed and didn\u2019t want to go back. She walked along the creek and headed towards the phoenix tree forest.Entering the phoenix tree forest, she smelled the fragrance and felt the petals falling around her. A large swing dangled in the center of the clearing, with the bench covered in red petals.Xiao Yao used her sleeve to brush off the petals before sitting down on the swing. She swung a few times and felt her heart gradually calm down.Zhuan Xu walked through the clearing towards her so Xiao Yao asked with a smile \u201cWhere\u2019s Jing?\u201d\u201cDiscussing wedding details with grandfather.\u201dThe swing was very large and could fit two people so Xiao Yao patted the seat beside her and Zhuan Xu sat down. The two sat side-by-side on the swing, looking down at the falling petals wordlessly.From the phoenix flowers on Cao Yun Peak to the phoenix flowers on Xiao Yue Peak, this whole road Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu walked it together as each other\u2019s sole source of support. No matter what happened, they knew the other person would be right there. In three months she would be getting married, and even if Qing Qiu wasn\u2019t too far, at most she would see Zhuan Xu every few months. She had Jing, but what about Zhuan Xu? Who would keep him company when he was sad, chat with him after he got drunk?Xiao Yao asked \u201cHave you found the woman you want to marry?\u201dZhuan Xu reached out his hand and caught a falling phoenix flower. He stared at the flower with a smile, silent and melancholy.Xiao Yao rea.s.sured him \u201cYou\u2019ll meet her one day!\u201d But even she felt hopeless, Zhuan Xu experienced so much and met all sorts of women, Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t imagine what woman Zhuan Xu could meet that could touch his cold steely heart.Zhuan Xu tucked the phoenix flower in Xiao Yao\u2019s hair and asked \u201cIf I found her, should I hold onto her tightly and never let her go?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Xiao Yao said with certainty \u201cOnce you meet her, you have to told on tight.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao and smiled.Xiao Yao and Jing\u2019s wedding was set and announced to the world, leaving the Tu Shan and Xi Ling clans busy planning the wedding.Zhuan Xu announced he had to make a trip to Southeast region of the vast wilderness to handle some official matters, and then pay a visit to Five G.o.ds Mountain and spend some time there before coming back. He would be gone about a month and wanted to leave Xiao Xiao behind to protect Xiao Yao. She had him take Xiao Xiao since he was traveling and he promised to be back safely for her wedding.Xiao Yue Peak got quiet after Zhuan Xu left, thankfully Jing came every day using the excuse of wedding planning to keep Xiao Yao company.Jing sat in the corridor with the Yellow Emperor playing Go when a servant announced the arrival of Empress Xing Yue here to congratulate the young lady on her upcoming wedding and to bring a wedding present.The Yellow Emperor asked Xiao Yao \u201cDo you want to see her?\u201dXiao Yao remembered when she first arrived on Sheng Nong Mountain, Xing Yue was her first girl friend and they even slept on the same pallet and took trips together. But once Xing Yue became her in-law, it was like the two became distant. And after Xiao Yao ran off from the wedding, their relations.h.i.+p completely fractured and in all those years they never saw each other.Xiao Yao said \u201cShe\u2019s the Empress and if she\u2019s making the overture to be nice then how can I have airs. Plus I was the one to wrong Feng Long and the Chi Sui clan first.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor had Xing Yue brought inside and she immediately kneeled to him. The Yellow Emperor gently said \u201cGet up, family doesn\u2019t need such formalities. I\u2019m playing Go with Jing so you don\u2019t need to keep me company. Have Xiao Yao walk outside with you, there is not much here but the flowers are nice so have a look.\u201dXing Yue looked at the Go board and knew that she was interrupting so nervously said \u201cGrandfather continue your chess game, I\u2019ll just stay a bit to talk to little sister and then leave.\u201dXiao Yao accompanied Xing Yue out and Xing Yue shot a glance at Jing, who sat across from the Yellow Emperor but his eyes followed Xiao Yao. Xing Yue felt a host of conflicted emotions, from envy to unease.Only after leaving the sight of the Yellow Emperor and Jing did Xing Yue speak \u201cCongratulations.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cJust saying it doesn\u2019t count, I won\u2019t accept unless it comes with a gift.\u201dXing Yue laughed \u201cOf course there are gifts! It\u2019s already sent to your residence and likely right now your maids are cataloguing it for you. Do you want to go have a look?\u201d\u201cNo need! Gifts from the Empress is certainly going to be good.\u201dDespite the two exchanging their pleasantries, the relations.h.i.+p had already fractured and there was no way to go back to the way it was before. After that, there was nothing else to talk about. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say while Xing Yue seemed to have her mind in the clouds. The two just walked along the creek silently until they reached the mountain top, only then did Xing Yue realize they hadn\u2019t spoken in half an hour.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t care about silence so she sat down on a rock to look out and admire the view.Xing Yue suddenly said \u201cI\u2019m very happy you\u2019re marrying Jing.\u201dXiao Yao looked up with a brilliant smile and said without any awkwardness \u201cI\u2019m also very happy.\u201dXing Yue took in her smile and couldn\u2019t help but smile back. This time Xiao Yao really was marrying a man, she really was going to leave Sheng Nong Mountain for good. To leave\u2026\u2026.Zhuan Xu!Standing on the mountain top, she could see Zhi Jin Summit\u00a0in the distance in the clouds and Xing Yue stared at Zhi Jin Palace before loudly saying \u201cI wish you and Jing to be happy and loving, forever and ever.\u201dXiao Yao nodded her thanks before asking Xing Yue \u201cAre you happy being the Empress?\u201dXing Yue smiled \u201cI got everything I wanted, I can\u2019t say whether I\u2019m happy, but I\u2019m very satisfied.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThen congratulations to you too.\u201dXing Yue stared at Xiao Yao and said very seriously \u201cBecause I got it all, that\u2019s why my biggest fear is to lose it. Who wants to take it from me, I won\u2019t ever let her get away with it.\u201dXiao Yao sighed, thank goodness her dad had Ah Nian living on Five G.o.ds Mountain and not involved in the compet.i.tion in Zhi Jin Summit. But then the taking and the losing was all between Zhuan Xu\u2019s women, he should be the one sighing and not her.Xiao Yao stood up and opened her arms to the wind while yelling loudly \u201cHey!!!!\u201dThe wind carried her voice echo and Jing arrived along with it. He first pulled Xiao Yao away from the cliff edge next to him before greeting Xing Yue.Xing Yue said to Xiao Yao \u201cLook! It\u2019s only half an hour and he\u2019s worried enough to come find you. Xiao Yao, you are very lucky, you need to treasure your luckiness!\u201dXiao Yao kept sensing that Xing Yue\u2019s words carried more meaning but she couldn\u2019t figure it out, nor could she sense any ill will, so Xiao Yao just smiled \u201cI will.\u201dXing Yue said \u201cI\u2019ll be off now to say farewell to Grandfather. You two take your time down the mountain!\u201d With that, Xing Yue didn\u2019t wait for Xiao Yao and Jing\u2019s response before using her power to rush down the mountain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the lovers get their happy ending too early, then what\u2019s the lure to keep readers following along when there is no compelling obstacles left to overcome. Despite all signs pointing to impending wedded normalcy for our intrepid leading lady in Lost You Forever, Xiao Yao\u2019s life was never a calk walk and it would be rash to think differently this time. While I never quite felt the love between Jing and Xiao Yao of the heady variety that I prefer, I definitely feel their commitment and devotion to each other after being through thick and thin to finally reach this point.Xiang Liu has no one to blame but himself for stubbornly refusing to take a chance with Xiao Yao, even when she gives him so many chances to step up, while Zhuan Xu made a deal with the devil and the price is hiding his love for Xiao Yao away. If there are no guys around to interrupt her wedding with Jing, unlike the dramatic and quite hilarious wedding debacle when she was marrying Feng Long, what could possibly happen now? Read on to find out! This chapter was sooooo long and but each word is worth the exhaustion of translation as the story takes another exciting turn.Chapter 42 \u2013 Soul Dreams Cannot Rest Easy:It was less than a month from Xiao Yao and Jing\u2019s wedding, and according to tradition the two were not to see each until then. Jing had no choice but to return to Qing Qiu, try on his wedding attire and inspect the final preparations before settling in to wait for the day to arrive that he would marry Xiao Yao.Other than renovating the Tu Shan clan residence, he also redesigned the living quarters and courtyard where he would reside with Xiao Yao according to her likes: Xiao Yao liked to eat snacks so there was a kitchen built within, Xiao Yao liked to drink plum wine so he planted different plum trees, Xiao Yao liked water play so he had a hot spring diverted into the pond\u2026\u2026Even though the elders already handled everything, Jing\u2019s requirements for his future residence with Xiao Yao was even more detailed so he got to work personally decorating the place and the elders were happy to let Jing do it himself.Then came word from Hu Mao that Tu Shan Zhen was critically ill and couldn\u2019t take in any food and water, only calling out for his father in bouts of alertness.Hu Mao was Hu Yao\u2019s brother and both were loyal servants to Jing. Hu Mao was tasked with taking care of Zhen since he was born, and even if Hu Mao hated Yi Yang and Hou, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to hate young Zhen and instead took very good care of him.Jing couldn\u2019t bear to let Yi Yang have her powers and energy sucked dry and die so he devised a plan to have her declared dead and smuggled out of Qing Qiu. In the past Yi Yang was very social so many people met her before, but now she was scared to be seen so Jing found the best place to situate her was Qing Shui Town.Even though Yi Yang wasn\u2019t going to die yet, she was gravely injured and even with the best care and recovery at most she could live until Zhen grew up. To keep Yi Yang from killing herself, Jing had Zhen sent to live in Qing Shui Town every spring and summer for a few months to keep him close to see his mom. Now Jing was getting married and he had arranged for Zhen to return in the fall, who knew Zhen would unexpectedly fall ill.Hu Mao was a thorough person so this news couldn\u2019t be wrong. With twenty more days until the wedding, Jing could make the return trip with plenty of time. But Jing felt unease, that he shouldn\u2019t go, but even if Zhen may not be his real son he was Jing\u2019s real nephew. Plus in Zhen\u2019s eyes, Jing was the father and if anything were to happen to Zhen then Jing would never forgive himself.Jing decided to go, taking Hu Zhen along to Qing Shui Town plus having You bring along extra guards.This was the first time Jing asked for the most skilled guards so You was taken aback \u201cThe wedding is next month, if Clan Leader has any premonitions then please don\u2019t make the trip.\u201dJing replied \u201cIf anything were to happen to Zhen, the wedding wouldn\u2019t go on either.\u201dYou bowed \u201cI understand! Clan Leader rest a.s.sured that we will make sure you are back for the wedding as that is the sole purpose of our job.\u201dBefore departing, Jing wrote a letter to Xiao Yao telling her that he needed to go to Qing Shui Town and explaining why. He a.s.sured her not to worry since he was safely guarded, and would be returning to Qing Qiu quickly.When Jing arrived at Qing Shui Town, it was already dawn. Yi Yang sat beside the pallet, her face shrouded in black gauze and wearing all black. Her entire form was fully covered other than a pair of autumnal water colored eyes showing.Jing asked \u201cHow is Zhen Er?\u201dYi Yang appeared dazed and pointed wordlessly to the pallet. Hu Zhen rushed up to take a pulse while Jing kneeled down and gently said \u201cZhen Er, Dad is here.\u201dZhen could make out Jing and burst into tears, reaching out to embrace Jing \u201cDad, I\u2019m in so much pain. Am I dying?\u201dJing took Zhen into his arms \u201cDon\u2019t cry! Don\u2019t cry! You need to be brave, Dad brought the best doctor here and once you\u2019ve recovered Dad will take you to see the open ocean.\u201dZhen weakly said \u201cI want to see the ocean.\u201dBoth Jing and Zhen looked hopefully towards Hu Zhen, who furrowed his brows and set down Zhen\u2019s wrist to examine his eyes and tongue. Jing noticed Hu Zhen\u2019s expression was dark so smiled at Zhen \u201cSleep a bit, okay?\u201dZhen was already exhausted \u201cYes, I\u2019ll sleep a bit. Dad stay with me.\u201d\u201cOkay, Dad will stay with you.\u201d Jing placed his hand on Zhen\u2019s forehead and soon he was asleep.Jing asked Hu Zhen \u201cWhat\u2019s the illness?\u201dHu Zhen replied \u201cIt\u2019s not an illness, it\u2019s poison.\u201dJing didn\u2019t even try to ask how and anxiously asked \u201cIs there an antidote?\u201dHu Zhen dejectedly said \u201cThis is a layered set poison and the methodology is complicated, I can\u2019t devise an antidote. Ms. Xi Ling can cure it, but there is little time left\u2026.\u201dThe silent Yi Yang suddenly spoke up \u201cHu Zhen, all these years and you\u2019ve actually improved. You could diagnose this as a layered set poison. Actually, why bring anyone from far away, just ask for the antidote from the person who set the poison.\u201dJing said \u201cThat\u2019s a solution, but do you know who set the poison?\u201dYi Yang pointed to herself \u201cRight in front of you.\u201dHu Zhen was so shocked he unconsciously blocked Jing and angrily asked \u201cThey say even the most evil tiger won\u2019t eat its own young, how could you poison your own son?\u201dJing stared in dismay at Yi Yang, also unable to believe she was the one who poisoned Zhen.Yi Yang laughed \u201cAll the people you arranged here are wily and wilier, if it wasn\u2019t using such a complicated set poison so they believed Zhen was close to death, how could I have lured you here.\u201dJing coldly said \u201cI\u2019m here now, give Zhen the antidote.\u201dYi Yang was taken aback \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to ask why you were lured here?\u201dJing grabbed Yi Yang hard by her arm and dragged her to the pallet \u201cAntidote!\u201d Because he was so enraged, his voice was low and his face harsh.Yi Yang fell on the pallet and looked up at Jing, a sheen of tears misted over her eyes \u201cYou really do care about Zhen.\u201dJing coldly repeated \u201cAntidote!\u201d and used power in his grip until Yi Yang\u2019s body shook. Yi Yang struggled \u201cThe antidote is in the hands of the person who had me do this.\u201dJing tossed Yi Yang on the ground and roared \u201cTu Shan Hou!\u201dHou walked into the room with a smile and joked \u201cThe one who was poisoned is my own son. I\u2019m not even anxious, my good little brother, why are you in such a rush?\u201dJing asked \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cEveryone you have in Qing Shui town has been\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hou made a throat slitting gesture \u201cand all your guards have been detained. Right now only my men are here and if I make one call you will be shot full of arrows.\u201dHu Zhen didn\u2019t believe it and called out but no one answered. He angrily said \u201cHou, don\u2019t forget your vow to the ancestors that if you dare harm the Clan Leader you will die a terrible death.\u201dHou laughed like he heard a hilarious joke \u201cI die a terrible death? Do you think I\u2019m scared of death?\u201dJing asked Hou \u201cIf you want to kill me, why haven\u2019t you made the call yet?\u201d Hou smiled broadly \u201cEver since we were kids, everyone said you were better than me. No matter what I did, you did it better. This time I want a fair fight, to use life or death to determine once and for all who is better.\u201dJing said \u201cI have a condition, let Hu Zhen live.\u201dHou smiled \u201cHe\u2019s the man of your maid, right? Fine, so she doesn\u2019t shed any tears I\u2019ll spare Hu Zhen.\u201d Hu Zhen yelled \u201cNo! No, Clan Leader! You can\u2019t agree\u2026\u2026\u201d Hou struck Hu Zhen with his palm and Hu Zhen fainted.Hou smiled \u201cFinally I can have a quiet talk with my little brother.\u201dJing said \u201cFair fight?\u201dHou said \u201cRight, until one of us dies, and the one who lives is naturally better. Neither can dispute the result! Even if mother saw it, she must also accept it, right?\u201dJing stared at Hou and his sadness and pity was evident in his eyes. Hou smiled back \u201cSince we were kids, mother always helped you cheat. No matter what I did it wasn\u2019t as good as you. Tu Shan Jing, you owe me one fair fight.\u201dJing\u2019s sadness was as thick as ink in his eyes \u201cIf this is a fair fight, you already chose the method, I will choose the location.\u201dHou scoffed \u201cFine!\u201d\u201cThen I agree!\u201d\u201cThis is the antidote!\u201d Hou tossed a pill at Yi Yang before walking out.Jing followed behind Hou silently. Since they were kids, he followed countless times behind Hou, following his big brother out to play, to school, to hunt, to greet their grandmother\u2026..back then they could have never imagined that one day they would fight to the death.The two rode their winged rides to the outskirts of Qing Shui Town, to an open field by the river. \u201cHere!\u201dHou said \u201cMountains and streams, this is not bad a place for your resting ground.\u201dJing looked at Hou who made a gesture to go ahead.A fog blanketed out from Jing until the entire field was shrouded in mist. Hou scoffed \u201cA fox is a fox, never daring for a direct combat, even generations of descendants can\u2019t change this pathetic habit!\u201dHou conjured up a water power based tiger who roamed in the mist roaring. It leaped in one direction and a white nine-tailed fox scampered away.Hou laugh \u201cJing, I know your battle strategy is to buy time so that your guards can arrive. Next month is your wedding and you desperately want to go back to be a groom, but let me tell you know that\u2019s impossible!\u201dThe tiger pounced towards the nine-tailed fox, and with Hou being adept at battling since young, many times the tiger nearly captured the fox who only managed to escape at the last minute thanks to the concealing fog.Hou laughed \u201cIt\u2019s not only you who is the descendant of the fox.\u201d The tiger changed color to white and disappeared into the fog.Many little nine-tailed foxes darted around the fog quickly and the tiger tried to capture each but wasn\u2019t as fast, huffing in frustration while shrinking in size.Hou knew the foxes were an illusion, but if this continued all his power would be depleted with this useless chase. Hou suddenly closed his eyes and the white tiger closed its eyes. Not seeing, everything turned still, so even if a fox was beside the tiger it did nothing, only hiding in the fog with its senses alert.Hou was relieved that he injured Jing\u2019s hand and throat so long ago, so Jing could never sing or play the melodious tunes again. The world only knew that the Young Master of Qing Qiu\u2019s musical talent was unparallel, no one knew it was actually an enchanting skill that Jing developed since childhood. If he used the mystifying music now, Hou would need to close off his ears, and a tiger without sight or hearing would find it impossible to kill the fox.The tiger suddenly moved, leaping forward as if attacking the fox on the left but using his strong tail to whip at the fox on the right. The fox tried to dodge but the tiger tail smashed down on the fox tail and split it in two.Jing tasted blood in his throat and the thick fog lifted a bit, while the tiger got bigger. The nine-tailed fox wasn\u2019t as fast having lost two tails and with a less dense fog it couldn\u2019t hide as well. Soon the tiger bit off another two fox tails.Hou said \u201cJing, if you admit you\u2019re not as good as me, I\u2019ll let you die a quick death.\u201dJing\u2019s face was ashen and he tightly pursed his lips, saying nothing. Hou said \u201cThen I\u2019ll keep ripping each tail off one by one so you die in the most painful way!\u201dThe tiger ripped off another fox tail and Jing screamed in pain while continuing to battle with Hou. The tiger bit off yet another tail and Hou roared \u201cJing, you rather have every organ ripped to shreds and still won\u2019t admit you\u2019re not as good as me?\u201dJing\u2019s body shook but his voice was calm \u201cIf it was my older brother from before who asked me this, I would immediately admit I\u2019m not as good, there are many areas I can\u2019t match up to him. But asking me now, I can tell you clearly that I look down on you! You\u2019re just a weakling who let jealousy and hatred control your heart.\u201dHou\u2019s face was contorted in range and he screamed, and with that deafening scream the entire ground shook and all the fog lifted. The tiger pounced and pressed down on the nine-tailed fox under its paws.Jing collapsed on the ground covered in blood. Hou yelled \u201cWho is the weakling now? How dare you look down on me? Say it! Who is the weakling!\u201dJing said nothing and didn\u2019t even look at Hou.The tiger ripped another fox tail and Jing\u2019s body convulsed in pain. Hou raged \u201cWho\u2019s stronger than who? You answer! Who isn\u2019t as good as who? You answer me\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe tiger raised its front paws and was about to smash the entire fox body to smithereens when suddenly Hou\u2019s entire body froze and his roar stopped, while the tiger\u2019s body began to shrink.Hou looked down in disbelief as an arrow tipped with a pair of intertwined mandarin ducks protruded from his chest. He touched the tips with the lover birds and murmured \u201cYi Yang!\u201dHou lifted his head to look up towards the sky.A white flying horse descended and an all black clad Yi Yang was sprawled on the horse and holding a beautiful bow in her hand.Because she was so weak and afraid of falling off the horse, she used a rope to tie herself to the horse\u2019s back. Now Yi Yang untied the rope and fell off the horse. She appeared too weak to walk but used the bow as a crutch to slowly stumble over.Hou stared at Yi Yang as the blood dripped from his chest, a mocking smile on his lips \u201cIs that the bow that I designed for you?\u201d\u201cThis is also something you gave me!\u201d Yi Yang ripped off her black face veil and her face was completely shriveled and dried, without any blood or flesh. It was like dried skin directly plastered on bone, except her eyes were bright and s.h.i.+ny like a young girl, making the visage even more ghastly.Hou made a noise and it wasn\u2019t clear if he was trying to laugh or cry \u201cYou\u2019re saving him? You came to save him? If it wasn\u2019t for him, we wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this.\u201d\u201cYou should say that if it wasn\u2019t for you, everything would be different!\u201d Yi Yang glanced at Jing with conflicted emotions. She harmed him time and again but he chose to forgive her. She used to see his kindness as weakness but only after she was truly heartbroken did she understand that hating is easy but forgiving required a stronger vaster heart.Yi Yang stumbled towards Hou \u201cBut I met you first! That year it was festival season and I was in Gao Xing traveling with my girl friends to see the lanterns. There was an accident and I fell in the water, but I couldn\u2019t swim and was caught by a water gra.s.s demon. It was you who saved me, and then accompanied me to view the lanterns while rowing on the lake to help me find my friends. I could tell this wasn\u2019t your first time in Gao Xing and asked why you were there. You said \u201cI came to see a girl, I heard she was viewing the lanterns.\u201d I knew I was already engaged but felt this disappointment in my heart. Later I found my friends and they called me Yi Yang, and you heard that and asked if I was Ms. Fang Feng. I said yes and you stared at me before smiling \u201cSo it\u2019s you!\u201d You then rowed out towards the ocean and I heard someone calling you \u201cYoung Master Tu Shan\u201d and you responded. All my friends teased me because we all thought you were the Tu Shan young master I was engaged to, and you came specifically to see me. I stared at you rowing away, with surprise and joy in my heart, thinking \u201cSo it\u2019s you!\u201d I prepared my trousseau and happily waited to marry you. But the news came instead was your grave illness and the wedding called off. Father tried to find out if you were dead or missing, not wanting to marry me to someone who was going to die. He wanted to cancel the engagement but all I could see was you standing within the lanterns with a smile saying \u201cSo it\u2019s you!\u201d I ignored my father\u2019s objection and put on my wedding dress, rus.h.i.+ng thousands of miles to Qing Qiu with one thought \u2013 I would find out who harmed you and kill that person. Even if you didn\u2019t marry me yet, I lived as your wife, taking good care of grandmother. When I learned that Tu Shan Hou harmed you, I decided to take revenge for you once Hou came back to the residence. Months later you finished a big deal and came home from Xuan Yuan Castle, I helped grandmother out to welcome you back and you walked towards me under the lit lanterns and I stared dumbstruck with only one thought \u201cSo it\u2019s you!\u201dYi Yang used all her strength to shoot out that arrow and now she collapsed on the ground, and ignoring the mud on her face, she raised her head to look at Hou \u201cThat moment, all my hate turned into joy. I didn\u2019t care who you were or what you had done, as long as you were alive then I was happy.\u201dYi Yang softly asked \u201cHou, I just want to know, was your true heart there even for one moment?\u201dHou coldly laughed \u201cWe\u2019re about to die, what does it matter, true heart or not?\u201dYi Yang crawled forward and stood up shakily. She looked at Jing \u201cI agreed to set this trap for Hou not to kill you, but to kill Hou. I told you before that I\u2019m not the same as you. Someone who wrongs me, I will make him pay! Zhen Er\u2019s poison has been lifted and I wrote him a letter to let him know all the wrong things his mom and real dad did. I hope that when he grows up, he can repay you on my behalf. Jing, I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not good, it\u2019s that you\u2019re too good! The heavens knew that you were too good for me, that I wasn\u2019t good enough for you, so that\u2019s why I met him first!\u201dYi Yang walked up to Hou and whispered in his ears \u201cI don\u2019t care if you were sincere or faking it this whole time, you promised to be a pair of mandarin ducks with me, lovers forever, in life and in death.\u201d She grabbed Hou\u2019s waist with one hand and the arrow with the other, and used all her remaining power to push the arrow forward until it pierced fully through Hou\u2019s heart and into her heart.Hou may have been gravely injured with the arrow but he still had power, he could have pushed Yi Yang away. It wasn\u2019t clear if he was dazed or wanted this, but he let Yi Yang embrace him as if he knew what she was going to do. When Yi Yang touched the arrow, he actually wrapped his arms around her to pull her closer into his arms. He smiled at Jing \u201cThis time, it\u2019s still not fair. And the person cheating for you is my own wife!\u201dWhen the arrow pierced Yi Yang, Hou used all his remaining power to rush forward and kick Jing with all his might \u201cLet\u2019s all die together!\u201dJing\u2019s body flew into the air and fell into the Qing Shui River.With that kick Hou used up all his energy and died, but his body continued to move forward and he fell into the Qing Shui River along with Yi Yang.Yi Yang held him tightly, nestled in his arms, tears falling from her eyes.The two pierced together with an arrow tipped with mandarin ducks disappeared underneath the churning waves.When Xiao Yao arrived at Qing Shui Town, it was already dusk. The field was covered in blood, a winged horse grazing, a b.l.o.o.d.y mandarin duck engraved bow laying on the ground. The bow reflected the sun but not a soul was in sight.Xiao Yao knew that Jing was not a fighter, and compared to Hou it was like a forest fox versus a mountainb tiger. The tiger might not be able to catch the fox in the woods, but in a direct battle the fox was doomed. Hou claimed he wanted a fair fight but he chose the method that gave him the advantage. So Jing was going to die either he agreed to the fight or not.But Xiao Yao didn\u2019t believe it. She kept telling herself that Jing was alive! He must be alive! In twenty four days he was going to marry her, so how could he not be alive?Xiao Yao followed the river calling out \u201cJing \u2014\u2014\u2013 Jing\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201c But no one answered her.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t care and even if her throat was parched raw she kept yelling while Jing Ye kneeled before her sobbing \u201cWe\u2019ve searched everywhere, Clan Leader hasn\u2019t been found.\u201dHu Ya and You walked the field and stopped by a patch of blood. Hu Ya said to Xiao Yao \u201cThis is all Clan Leader\u2019s blood, because his powers were ripped when the nine-tailed fox tails were pulled off, his internal organs were severely injured. He couldn\u2019t even stand so must have collapsed here.\u201dLooking around, he continued \u201cThis is where he laid the longest, and he would be severely injured so couldn\u2019t move easily. If he moved anywhere he would leave a trace behind, unless\u2026..Clan Leader went from this spot directly into the river.\u201dJing Ye was ecstatic \u201cThat means Master must have escaped, he\u2019s still alive!\u201dYou shook her head so Jing Ye\u2019s face fell. Hu Yao continued \u201cYou doesn\u2019t believe that. If Master escaped then Hou should still be alive, but You smells Hou\u2019s scent of death.\u201d Hu Ya pointed to the trail of blood leading to the river \u201cThat\u2019s all blood from Hou\u2019s heart, and the blood on that final stretch doesn\u2019t have any scent of life, which means Hou was already dead.\u201dXiao Yao anxiously asked You \u201cIf you smell Hou\u2019s death scent, do you smell anyone else\u2019s?\u201dHu Ya said \u201cClan Leader is the King of the fox tribe. You has no ability to determine if he\u2019s dead or alive.\u201d Hu Ya saw Xiao Yao\u2019s face ashen and about to cry so quickly added \u201cRight now it\u2019s just Hou, she also can\u2019t smell Fang Feng Yi Yang\u2019s death either.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cBut you\u2019re certain Jing fell in the river?\u201d Hu Ya added \u201cClan Leader couldn\u2019t have vanished into thin air, so that\u2019s the only possibility.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go find him!\u201d Xiao Yao dove into the water with a plop and vanished in the waves. Hu Ya yelled \u201cWe\u2019ve already send s.h.i.+ps searching up and down the river!\u201dJing Ye cried \u201cLet her go, if she doesn\u2019t do anything she might have a break down.\u201dThat night Qing Shui River was brightly lit with lamps on s.h.i.+ps going up and down the length. There were also tens of water demons searching in the water depths. Deep into the night, even more s.h.i.+ps and water demons arrived to join the search. Right as the sun was close to rising, at the darkest and coldest point of the night, Zhuan Xu arrived.He was in full armor and clearly rushed here straight from an army base without even stopping to change, riding the fastest winged ride to get here.Xiao Yao was still in the river looking for Jing, from dusk until now she refused to leave the water. She searched every inch of the river floor from Qing Shui Town until when the river met the ocean. A s.h.i.+p brought Xiao Yao back to Qing Shui Town but she refused to quit and wanted to swim back upstream and search all over again. Everyone could see she was exhausted but no one could stop her. Xiao Yao jumped into the river and her legs spasmed so she couldn\u2019t swim. She tightly grabbed onto an oar and still refused to get out of the water, as if she could stay closer to Jing if she stayed in the water, and give him a better chance of being alive.It was only when Zhuan Xu arrived that he forcefully pulled Xiao Yao out of the water. Her face was blue and her lips black, her eyes blank, with her hair plastered on her face and body colder than ice. Zhuan Xu called her to drink wine but she didn\u2019t respond. Zhuan Xu forced her lips open and poured wine in her mouth. Xiao Yao\u2019s body jerked and she started to cough.Xiao Xiao dried Xiao Yao\u2019s hair with a towel and used her power to dry her clothes. Zhuan Xu wrapped Xiao Yao up in a blanket to carry her away but Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes remained fixed on the water in abject terror as she shook her head vigorously. Zhuan Xu had no choice but to let Xiao Yao sit by the sh.o.r.e.Xiao Yao stared blankly at the s.h.i.+ps coming and going on the river, and whatever Zhuan Xu said it was like she didn\u2019t even hear it. From time to time she would ask \u201cFound yet?\u201dBy noon, Qing Shui River had been searched upside down, and it wasn\u2019t just Jing not found, neither Hou or Yi Yang had been found either. The only find was a jade bracelet, dark green and malleable, without any design on it but the jade itself was very high quality and exquisite. But it wasn\u2019t finished yet so the bracelet shape wasn\u2019t finished either.Jing Ye saw it and burst into tears \u201cClan Leader said the Miss didn\u2019t wear jewelry but a bracelet wouldn\u2019t be too c.u.mbersome, so he was making her this bracelet himself.\u201dXiao Yao stood up but Zhuan grabbed her \u201cWhere was it found?\u201dOne person replied \u201cDown river close to the mouth to the ocean.\u201dXiao Yao yelled \u201cJing! Jing is there!\u201d\u201cBecause this bracelet was found there, we had men search that area top to bottom and every rock turned over. Nothing was found. Likely carried by the current into the ocean.\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s voice was tight and sharp \u201cThen search the ocean.\u201dNo one dared say anything other than to murmur \u201cThe mouth to the ocean has been searched thoroughly.\u201dWhether it was Tu Shan people or Zhuan Xu\u2019s people, every person was doing everything possible and searching the ocean area nearby. But it was still the ocean, the vast open ocean, forget looking for one person, even sinking an entire mountain into the ocean it would be difficult to find it. Plus there were lots of demon water beasts and sea monsters in the ocean, and G.o.ds had G.o.dly powers that were the favorite foods of those sea creatures.Zhuan Xu ordered \u201cKeep searching!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Everyone went back on the s.h.i.+ps or dove back into the water, and in a second was all gone. Under the bright sun, the river waves churned beautifully forward, not a shred of sadness or awareness that it swallowed up the happiness of two people.Xiao Yao stood up and stumbled \u201cI\u2019m going to look for him!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIf you want to go, you still need to eat. If you don\u2019t have energy how can you search. Be good, let\u2019s eat first, okay?\u201dXiao Yao wanted to shake his hand off \u201cI want revenge!\u201dZhuan Xu shot Xiao Xiao a look and she quickly returned with a s.h.i.+p. Zhuan Xu carried Xiao Yao and flew onto the s.h.i.+p. The s.h.i.+p traveled downstream as Xiao Yao held the unfinished bracelet in her hand and stared out at the water unblinking, as if she wanted to remember clearly the river that so cruelly took Jing away from her.Xiao Xiao\u2019s powers were strong and the s.h.i.+p was sailing fast. When the sun was dipping low the s.h.i.+p entered the mouth to the ocean. There were countless s.h.i.+ps out in the ocean continuing to search. Xiao Xiao halted her powers as the s.h.i.+p slowly sailed forward in the current.Xiao Yao touched the bracelet and asked \u201cWas the bracelet found here?\u201d Xiao Yao struggled to stand up to jump in the river. Zhuan Xu grabbed her \u201cYou can\u2019t even stand, what are you going to do down there?\u201dThe s.h.i.+p wobbled and Xiao Yao weakly fell in to Zhuan Xu\u2019s arms. She still insisted on diving in as her eyes fixed on the water \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026.I want to go find him!\u201dZhuan Xu grabbed her chin and forced her head up to look around her, nearly about to yell \u201cLook! How many people are looking for him? They are stronger and more familiar with this area than you, they know better than you how to look for someone in the water. If you go down I\u2019ll have to ask them to follow you and protect you. Are you looking for someone or causing more problems for them?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s lips were quivering as her body shook. Zhuan Xu embraced her tightly and softened his tone \u201cXiao Yao, if Jing is alive they will find him.\u201dXiao Yao stared at the people in the water, searching in pairs in perfect form, truly looking at every inch and nook.Xiao Xiao directed their s.h.i.+p to follow along with the search vessels. From the sunset until late into the night, all the s.h.i.+ps were far out at sea. It was a dark starless night but the moon was bright and it shone down on the thousands of searchers still looking for Jing. Because everyone carried an illuminating new moon jewel sent over by the Tu Shan clan, thousands of moon jewels glittered in the water like thousands of stars dancing in the waves.From when Jing fell into the water, two days had pa.s.sed. All the searchers had lost hope but without Zhuan Xu\u2019s order no one dared stop or give up.Xiao Yao stared out at the dark waves and murmured \u201cI don\u2019t understand. In the past when things went wrong, I always knew what the mistake was. Some was because he was too kind and forgiving, others because I didn\u2019t trust him and hold onto him. But this time what did we do wrong? He rushed to see a child in need, that was not wrong. He brought along guards, that was not wrong. He wrote me a letter before leaving, that was not wrong. He chose to battle rather than get shot by arrows, that was not wrong. I rushed to him when I received the letter, that was not wrong. So where did we go wrong?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cNeither of you did anything wrong.\u201d\u201cIf we didn\u2019t do anything wrong, then why did things go wrong?\u201dZhuan Xu had no answer for that.\u201cIn the past, if we made mistakes, we corrected it and things got fixed. But what about this time? Gege, you tell me, what did we do wrong? I\u2019ll fix it, I\u2019ll for sure fix it. No matter what I did wrong, I\u2019ll change and fix it!\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s body convulsed from the pain and not eating for two days, she felt like throwing up but nothing came up.\u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao.\u201d Zhuan Xu tried to inject power into Xiao Yao to lessen her pain but could do nothing because her pain came from her heart.The moon gradually disappeared as the sun came up from the East and its red light blanketed the ocean in color. One commander came to report \u201cYour Majesty, we\u2019ve searched for two days one night, many soldiers are exhausted and pa.s.sed out. Does Your Majesty want us to rest or continue searching, or call more men here?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cRest and then continue searching, and order a thousand more water based soldiers here.\u201dThe commander paused for a moment before saying \u201cYes!\u201dThe exhausted soldiers climbed onboard the s.h.i.+ps and collapsed on the deck even before drinking water. Calls of \u201cdoctor, doctor!\u201d rose from various directions. Some didn\u2019t even have strength to climb onto the s.h.i.+p and fell back into the water, dragging other soldiers behind. No one dared say anything since Zhuan Xu was there.Xiao Yao stared at the soldiers before looking back out at the ocean, so vast and unending. Even taking all the soldiers of a kingdom as vast as the wilderness was not enough to even match up with one part of the ocean. She was never going to find Jing!Xiao Yao said in a low voice \u201cTell them to stop searching.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cPerhaps he was saved by a fis.h.i.+ng vessel, or saved by merpeople and sent back to land.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s tears fell in large drops \u201cTwenty two more days until our wedding, he needs to mind the time to hurry back.\u201dAfter saying that, Xiao Yao toppled forward in a dead faint. Zhuan Xu scrambled to catch her in his arms, she didn\u2019t eat or rest for two days and finally collapsed from exhaustion.Zhuan Xu carefully wrapped Xiao Yao in a blanket and held her in his arms, staring carefully at her face. Her visage was pale and lips white, in two days it was like her entire body wasted away. Zhuan Xu felt his heart hurt and he looked up into the dawning light before taking a deep breath \u201cXiao Yao, this too will pa.s.s, and one day you will forget him!\u201dXiao Yao slept for four days straight, and Yin said her body was healthy but it was like she was gravely ill and couldn\u2019t wake up. Even in sleep she would shake in pain.Zhuan Xu was anxious beyond belief but could do nothing other than stay beside Xiao Yao. After four days and four nights, Xiao Yao woke up, her body wan and thin as if recovering from a major illness. Zhuan Xu had also lost weight and wanted to take Xiao Yao back but she refused so he had no choice but to stay with her in the East Sea for tens more days.Every night Xiao Yao would wait, every day Xiao Yao would go in the water. Zhuan Xu had no choice so had Xiao Xiao follow her everywhere. On the eleventh day, with four more days until the wedding date, Xiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cI want to go back to Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dZhuan Xu brought Xiao Yao back to Sheng Nong Mountain and when she saw the Yellow Emperor she asked \u201cGrandfather, is my wedding dress altered?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs my dowry prepared?\u201d\u201cYes, already packed.\u201dXiao Yao seemed relieved and went back to her room.The Yellow Emperor\u2019s expression was somber and he stared out at the mountains in the distance for a long time before asking \u201cIs Jing dead?\u201dZhuan Xu answered \u201cYes, he\u2019s dead.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor closed his eyes and in a moment he seemed to have aged yet another round. He walked stoop backed to his room \u201cThese days, you\u2019ve neglected your government affairs.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI did not neglect my official duties. Even in the East Sea, I worked all day and during the day it was Xiao Xiao watching over Xiao Yao, I only spend time with her at night.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor wearily said \u201cAs long as you know what you are doing. The Tu Shan clan businesses are throughout the entire vast wilderness. Something happened to its clan leader, that doesn\u2019t just affect all the big families, clans, and tribes of the vast wilderness, if you don\u2019t handle it properly, then it might affect the foundation of the kingdom.\u201dThe day before the wedding arrived and by evening the moon was round in the sky and still no word about Jing. The residence was silent with no wedding hustle and bustle, but the wedding decorations long strung up were still there with no one daring to take it down or use it, so everyone acted like it was just any other day.In the middle of the night, Xiao Yao woke from her sleep as if someone was knocking on her window. She opened the window \u201cJing\u2026\u2026Jing, are you back?\u201dMiao Pu was beside her \u201cMiss, it\u2019s just the wind rustling the trees.\u201dXiao Yao felt dizzy and couldn\u2019t stand up so she leaned on the window \u201cIt\u2019s really not him?\u201dUnder the moonlight there were only trees with no shadow of a person. Xiao Yao\u2019s heart broke and asked \u201cMiao Pu, who do you think I\u2019ve not once dreamed about Jing?\u201dMiao Pu draped a robe over Xiao Yao and handed her a slipper and didn\u2019t know how to answer other than \u201cYour servant doesn\u2019t know.\u201dXiao Yao looked up at the moon \u201cI really miss him, and even if I really can\u2019t see him again, seeing him in a dream is better than nothing.\u201dMiao Pu felt like crying, she had been serving Xiao Yao this whole time and had seen how hard it was for Xiao Yao and Jing to finally get together. Just as they were about to get their happy ending, then this happened.Xiao Yao said \u201cLikely because I didn\u2019t see it with my own eyes, everything doesn\u2019t seem real. I feel like he will suddenly appear. How could someone just vanish like that? How come he didn\u2019t say goodbye to me? I would rather he died in my arms, that we could say our last words to each other. But what\u2019s this? One day I get his letter telling me to sleep early and not read late into the night, and the night day everyone says he\u2019s gone. How\u2019s that possible, I don\u2019t believe it! Why didn\u2019t he tell me anything? I hate him!\u201d Xiao Yao screamed at the moon \u201cTu Shan Jing, I hate you!\u201dThe night was silent back.Xiao Yao wearily lowered her head as the tears came down like rain drops \u201cBut I don\u2019t have the heart to hate you. I know that you must be in pain that you couldn\u2019t keep your promise.\u201dMiao Pu used her sleeve to wipe away the tears \u201cDon\u2019t think anymore, just sleep!\u201dXiao Yao said to Miao Pu \u201cBring me a G.o.dly mulberry wood.\u201d Miao Pu didn\u2019t know why but quickly went to bring one back. When she got back, she saw Xiao Yao in the corridor and she had already brought a ladder over. Miao Pu said \u201cMiss, be careful, this branch seems flameless but is entirely a flame. Hold it by the jade handle.\u201dXiao Yao took the branch with the jade handle and climbed the ladder to light the bright red wedding lantern. She got down and wanted to move the ladder but Miao Pu understood what she wanted to do\u201cLet me!\u201d She was trained as one of Zhuan Xu\u2019s secret guards so she was very powerful and easily moved the ladder under another lantern. Xiao Yao climbed up and lit another lantern.In the dark silent night, Miao Pu moved the ladder and Xiao Yao lit the lantern, one after another, until all the wedding lanterns were s.h.i.+ning brightly. With that the entire residence was bathed in warm red light.Miao Pu saw dark circles under Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes \u201cMy lady, let\u2019s go back to your room so you can get some sleep.\u201dXiao Yao sat down in front of her dresser table \u201cDo my hair and makeup.\u201dThese days Xiao Yao didn\u2019t even eat, much less get dolled up. Miao Pu was stunned until she realized why and said with a tearful reply \u201cYes!\u201dMiao Pu wasn\u2019t trained in doing the elaborate wedding hairstyle and none of the old biddies arrived since the wedding was called off, so Miao Pu did Xiao Yao\u2019s hair in her favorite style and put on a hair ornament that Jing gave Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao looked at herself in the mirror and together with Miao Pu did her own makeup. Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhere is my wedding dress?\u201dMiao Pu opened the chest and took out a red wedding dress with gold thread \u201cMiss?\u201d Xiao Yao opened her arms \u201cI want to wear it!\u201dMiao Pu bit her lit and opened the dress for Xiao Yao to put on. Since Zhuan Xu moved the capital, the style of the West and the Middle Plains had been merging so Xiao Yao\u2019s wedding dress was a design combination of the best features of both cultures. It was ornate like the Sheng Nong style but also free flowing like the Xuan Yuan preference, beautiful and regal.After she was all readied, Xiao Yao sat down as if she was just a bride waiting for the hour of her wedding ceremony.Xiao Yao asked \u201cMiao Pu, do you know when the scheduled wedding time was?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDo you think Jing knows?\u201d\u201cHe would definitely know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dXiao Yao picked up a medical text from the front of the pallet and started reading it while Miao Pu stood there in a daze. She then left to bring back some soup and snacks to plate on the table behind Xiao Yao.A noon the Yellow Emperor came to see Xiao Yao and saw her wearing her wedding dress sitting on the pallet. The vivid color of the wedding dress and the silence of reading the medical text formed a startling contrast.It was mid-Summer so the bright sun filtered through the window and illuminated Xiao Yao, but didn\u2019t s.h.i.+ne any celebratory air and instead highlighted the sadness of a happiness torn asunder.So alike! The Xiao Yao reading with her eyes lowered looked so much like her! The Yellow Emperor seemed to see the Xiao Yao before him rapidly aging away in a lonely room, her black locks turning white and her proud visage adding desolate wrinkles. Her old and lonely visage in Cao Yun Court overlayed on the Xiao Yao before him until the Yellow Emperor could no longer bear to look and shut his eyes.Xiao Yao heard a noise and looked up to see the Yellow Emperor, and then looked out the window at the bright light of midday.The Yellow Emperor walked into the room and saw the food on the table untouched and said \u201cXiao Yao, eat with me.\u201dXiao Yao picked up a snack and slowly ate it. The Yellow Emperor kept Xiao Yao company from noon until it was completely dark outside and Miao Pu lit the lamps one by one.Because of Jing\u2019s sudden death, Zhuan Xu was busier than ever these days so when he was done for the day it was already late into the night. He didn\u2019t even stop to eat and rushed to Xiao Yue Peak, going straight to Xiao Yao\u2019s residence. Even as his winged ride was in the air he could see the entire residence bathed in the celebratory glow of wedding lanterns.When he got close he saw every red lantern lit, asking in a dark voice as his winged ride landed \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dXiao Xiao said \u201cThe Miss ordered it lit.\u201d The lanterns were the highest quality and once lit could burn for nine days.Zhuan Xu stared down the corridor of red lanterns, not moving or saying anything. Moments later he expression warmed and he started walking towards Xiao Yao\u2019s room.Xiao Xiao immediately knelt down and carefully said \u201cMiss put on her wedding dress and makeup.\u201dZhuan Xu stopped dead in his tracks and his face was thunderous \u201cShe put on her wedding attire?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t walk forward but also didn\u2019t turn around. Xiao Xiao was on the ground kneeling, pressed down with her forehead to the ground so she couldn\u2019t see Zhuan Xu but could hear his heavy breathing. With each breath Xiao Xiao\u2019s body trembled.Moments later, Zhuan Xu abruptly turned around and got back on his winged ride and left.Xiao Xiao collapsed on the ground in a heap and let out a sigh of relief, her back already damp with a cold sweat.She walked into the residence \u201cThe Black Emperor has matters tonight that he must tend to, he won\u2019t be coming today but will come see Your Majesty and Miss tomorrow.\u201dXiao Yao was dazed and didn\u2019t even react but the Yellow Emperor stared long and hard at Xiao Xiao but said nothing, only waving his hand for her to leave.Xiao Yao asked \u201cHas the auspicious hour pa.s.sed?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor said \u201cXiao Yao, Jing won\u2019t be coming back. Your life is still long so forget him!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m tired and I want rest. You go rest too!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was worried but Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just\u2026..need time.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor stared silently before standing up and slowly shuffling out of the room.Xiao Yao walked to the window to look up at the full moon. Jing picked a full moon night for their wedding likely so they had a round happy ending. But today the round moon didn\u2019t s.h.i.+ne on a happy ending pair.Xiao Yao told the Yellow Emperor she just needed time, but how much time did she need? How long would it take before her heart didn\u2019t hurt anymore?Xiao Yao asked \u201cMiao Pu, how long do you think before I\u2019m not heartbroken?\u201dMiao Pu answered \u201cLike a severe injury, it will hurt a lot initially, and slowly the wound will scab and scar, and slowly it won\u2019t hurt as much.\u201dXiao Yao looked down, she had been injured before and knew how long it took to stop hurting. To stop hurting she had to forget! But time was like sand, it would cover up everything in the heart.But\u2014\u2014Jing, I don\u2019t want to!If the price to pay to not hurt is to forget you, then I would rather be in pain always so that you can live in my heart, until my life reaches its conclusion.I\u2019ve already put on my wedding dress and said my vows to the moon. From tonight forward, I am your wife!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree volumes of Lost You Forever and finally I\u2019m seeing the end of the road ahead, with less than ten chapters left of a novel that has really taken an unforgettable bite out of my soul. A few years ago I probably would have had the energy to power translate the entire thing like I did with Da Mo Yao, but alas the few hiatus that I took with LYF likely seeped some of the fervor from the reading experience for those following along with my translations.Thankfully these last few chapters should offer a nice resurgence for the avid readers, with Tong Hua pulling out all the stops by the end.With Jing seemingly dead to the world, it would appear that Xiao Yao either chooses to be a spinster, or end up in the arms of the other two men who love her as much if not more than Jing. But things aren\u2019t that easy to redirect, the obstacles between Xiao Yao and Xiang Liu are only growing stronger with Zhuan Xu\u2019s tightening of his rule over the entire vast wilderness, not to mention a new danger to Xiao Yao that is not going to be easy to siolve. Will Xiao Yao get her happy ending, or it is merely worth a life lived as colorfully as hers that she was so loved by three of the most fascinating fictional men in any novel world.Ch 43 \u2013 Thinking of My Dearest Daily to No Avail:Xiao Yao bowed three times to the moon and was standing up when a little white bird landed on the window sill. It didn\u2019t have a little bird\u2019s noisy affects and was instead silent and staring at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao put out her hand and the bird landed on her palm and spit out a small crystal ball. Xiao Yao picked up the ball and saw it wasn\u2019t a real crystal but the fish egg of an echo fish demon. An echo fish had no intelligence but had the strange ability to remember word for word what was said. So people used its fish eggs to forge message jewels for use in transmitting voice mail.Xiao Yao placed the fish egg to her ear and used her fingers to burst it. Her body shook as the voice said \u201cXiao Yao, come to the East Sea immediately, don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d It was Jing\u2019s voice.Xiao Yao instinctively asked \u201cJing, say that again.\u201d But a message jewel could only be used once and could not repeat.The white bird flew away and Xiao snapped alert and grabbed Miao Pu \u201cI have to go to the East Sea immediately! Don\u2019t tell anyone!\u201dMiao Pu\u2019s freaked out \u201cNo! No!\u201d\u201cMiao Pu, are you going to help me or not?\u201dMiao Pu stuttered \u201cBut\u2026..but\u2026\u2026His Majesty ordered Xiao Xiao to guard outside. I can\u2019t beat her in a fight\u2026..\u201d Miao Pu suddenly shut up and looked at the door.Xiao Xiao appeared and was holding the white bird from earlier and it was already dead. She bowed to Xiao Yao \u201cMiss, what did this white bird give you just now?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cWhy do I need to tell you?\u201dXiao Xiao stared at Miao Pu who said in a low voice \u201cA message jewel.\u201dXiao Xiao asked \u201cWhat did it say?\u201dMiao Pu said \u201cI didn\u2019t hear.\u201dXiao Xiao bowed again to Xiao Yao \u201cWill Miss please tell me what the message jewel said.\u201dXiao Yao c.o.c.ked her head and thought \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask clearly then you can\u2019t report back to Zhuan Xu. Fine, I won\u2019t make it difficult for you!\u201d Xiao Yao walked up to Xiao Xiao and put her hand on her shoulder and leaned in to whisper. \u201cXiao Xiao, you\u2019re a good girl but too inflexible at times. I\u2019m going to the East Sea and won\u2019t bring you because you clearly won\u2019t let me go.\u201dXiao Xiao saw black and her body went slack, tumbling backwards as Miao Pu rushed over to catch her while staring in shock at Xiao Yao.\u201cHelp me!\u201d Xiao Yao had Miao Pu put Xiao Xiao on the bed and covered her with a blanket before putting down the bed veil. At a glance it appeared Xiao Yao was sleeping inside.Xiao Yao quickly changed and said to the stunned Miao Pu \u201cWhat are you standing there for? Let\u2019s go!\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t just a.s.sign Xiao Xiao to protect Xiao Yao, but only Xiao Xiao and Miao Pu protect her at close range, the other four guards were men and stayed at a distance. They were guarding against outside intruders and never thought that Xiao Yao would take out Xiao Xiao so they didn\u2019t even realize Xiao Yao had knocked Xiao Xiao out.Xiao Yao pressed the opening and a door to a secret pa.s.sage opened. She went inside with Miao Pu and started walking. Back when Zhuan Xu was renovating the Sheng Nong Palaces, Xiao Yao also studied all the design maps and saw that all the palace residences had secret pa.s.sageways, some just had more than others.Miao Pu\u2019s expression was desolate and glum, muttering as she walked \u201cHis Majesty is going to kill me!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThen he\u2019ll have to kill me first!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s words didn\u2019t rea.s.sure her as Miao Pu continued to look like she was going to cry.The end of the secret pa.s.sageway led to the stables and Xiao Yao said \u201cNot sure which former owner of the residence liked to sneak out and play but this is totally helping us tonight.\u201dMiao Pu picked two of the strongest winged horses and readied the cloud carriage. Xiao Yao huddled in the cloud carriage and handed a jade badge to Miao Pu \u201cThis is Grandfather\u2019s badge, allowing unfettered travel in and out of Sheng Nong Mountain.\u201dMiao Pu took a deep breath and said to herself \u201cIf I\u2019m going to die then just go for it!\u201d Miao Pu drove the cloud carriage into the air and handed the badge to the guards at the East Sky Gate and was immediately let through.After they left Sheng Nong Mountain, Xiao Yao stuck her head out the cloud carriage \u201cThank you!\u201dMiao Pu grumbled \u201cMy Lady, why did you have to go to the East Sea in the middle of the night? Can\u2019t Xiao Xiao have informed His Majesty, he dotes on you and lets you do whatever. If you wanted to go he would have allowed it. Why sneak around?\u201d\u201cI heard Jing tell me to immediately go to the East Sea and tell no one.\u201dMiao Pu gasped \u201cWhat? The voice inside the message jewel was the Tu Shan Clan Leader? What did he say?\u201d\u201cTo go to the East Sea, and to tell no one.\u201dMiao Pu thought about it \u201cIf he can say those words why can\u2019t he explain more? It\u2019s easy to find someone to impersonate his voice, but those closest to him will see through it if a lot is said. The less is said the more the ruse will work. I think this sounds fishy, my lady let\u2019s go back!\u201d\u201cPerhaps you are right but it could have been an urgent situation and he could only say such curt phrases. Miao Pu, do you know, even if there is a miniscule chance or even a trap, I have to immediately go.\u201dMiao Pu sighed and urged the horses faster. Even if this was a trap, the person setting it was ruthless and found the one way to get Xiao Yao to follow instructions. Miao Pu silently prayed for the miniscule chance to come true.The two strong winged horses flew nonstop and Xiao Yao fed them Jade Mountain stew to keep up their strength. They landed on an island in the East Sea around noon the next day. The two winged horses were spitting foam from exhaustion and could not be used to search over the sea lest they fall into the water from pa.s.sing out.Xiao Yao pointed to the East where a s.h.i.+p was sailing towards them, and on the mast cover was a beautiful nine-tailed fox.Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019ll go see over there, you hide here waiting for me.\u201d Miao Pu immediately said \u201cNo! I\u2019m going with you!\u201d\u201cThen who will watch the winged horses? If they run away and we need to escape, are we going to run on our two feet?\u201dMiao Pu had no answer until she said \u201cXiao Xiao will definitely find us, their powers are strong and at most will be here in two or three hours. Wait until then.\u201d\u201cWe can wait but Jing might not be able to wait.\u201d Xiao Yao picked up her amethyst fish ruby on the necklace and said \u201cI\u2019ll swim over there underwater and look around. If there is any danger I\u2019ll hide deep underwater. They won\u2019t be able to do anything to me there. If you come with me then you\u2019ll be a liability. Plus if you wait here, you can be my backup and I can go forward or retreat. If anything happens, you can also tell Xiao Xiao and find the Xuan Yuan forces stationed nearby to come rescue us.\u201dMiao Pu had to admit Xiao Yao made sense but she was still upset \u201cThen you quickly come back, just go take a look and no matter what we need to discuss before taking any action.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Xiao Yao hid behind a rock and slowly disappeared into the water.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t need the fish ruby to breath underwater but she didn\u2019t want others to know of her body\u2019s new ability and she kept the fish ruby on her because it was a gift from Jing. Right now Xiao Yao felt this ache in her heart as she sank into the water and prayed: heavens, you can do anything cruel to me but please let Jing be alive even if he\u2019s gravely injured or crippled.Xiao Yao was swimming under the s.h.i.+p taking things in when a woman in purple laying on the edge lifted her head \u201cIf you want to see Tu Shan Jing then get on the s.h.i.+p.\u201dXiao Yao emerged and asked \u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201dThe woman tossed a sc.r.a.p of cloth at Xiao Yao and it on it was writing in Jing\u2019s hand. It was the lyrics of the song she sang for him in his residence.If beloved is wind above the waterTo see and to missIf beloved is the cloud in the skyTo love and to cherishIf beloved were the tree in the forestTogether and connectedWhy does the world have sadnessOnly wish with belovedTogether forever, never apartXiao Yao finished reading and restrained her tears before jumping on the s.h.i.+p.The woman in purple handed a bowl of wine to Xiao Yao with a laugh \u201cI\u2019ve heard you are well versed in medicines so I don\u2019t dare to use poison in front of you. This is just a bowl of wine made from the red jade plant. Humans who drink it will sleep for three hundred years, at most it\u2019ll make a G.o.d weak in the limbs and dizzy and a good sleep will shake it off. It\u2019s not a poison or will render you unconscious, therefore it doesn\u2019t have an antidote either. After you drink it I will take you to see Tu Shan Jing.\u201dXiao Yao picked up the bowl and sniffed, it really was red jade plant wine. Drinking too much would make it addictive, but one drink wouldn\u2019t harm the body.The purple robed woman said \u201cI never force anyone, if you don\u2019t want to drink then go back!\u201dXiao Yao raised her head and gulped it down \u201cWhere is Jing?\u201d\u201cI always fulfill my promises!\u201d The woman started moving the s.h.i.+p into the deeper reaches of the ocean.The s.h.i.+p moved swiftly over the water and Xiao Yao could hear the wind whistling around her as her limbs weakened so she laid down on the deck and stared up at the sky.The s.h.i.+p stopped in the middle of the ocean nowhere, with no land in sight in any direction. The woman walked over and picked up Xiao Yao to place her inside a crystal coffin.Xiao Yao weakly asked \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe woman took out the sc.r.a.p of song lyric and burned it, then took Xiao Yao\u2019s amethyst fish ruby and shattered it completely, turning it into purple light.Tears fell from Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes \u201cWhere\u2019s Jing?\u201dThe purple robed woman leaned on the coffin with a smile \u201cTu Shan Jing is dead! I\u2019m fulfilling my promise now to send you to see him! This s.h.i.+p is taking in water now and soon will completely sink into the ocean. I\u2019m just a hired killer and doing my job. The person who hired me gave specific instructions \u2013 no hint of blood and you have to disappear completely without a trace, not even a hair to be found. I thought all night about it and remembered this area in the ocean and how scary it is and come up with this plan.\u201d The woman patted Xiao Yao\u2019s face \u201cCan you imagine how much the person who hired me hates you, to not even let a hair of you remain on this earth? But, only this way can there be no trace left of you, otherwise the Yellow Emperor and the Black Emperor will be hard to deal with.\u201dXiao Yao stared at the sky and didn\u2019t feel any rage at being lied to, or fear at imminent death. Only the sadness of having her hopes dashed. Since childhood she had lived a hard life, her heart always drifting, feeling like she would be abandoned at any time. After her engagement to Jing did her heart settle down, thinking that things would finally change. Who knew Jing left her, even if it was just like her parents when a reason that couldn\u2019t be helped. But she was still abandoned again, and she didn\u2019t want to keep being strong anymore to face a long life ahead. If Jing slept in this ocean then she would rather be here with him.The purple robed woman noticed that Xiao Yao was oddly at peace, not like people she killed in the past, and felt some pity for her. She fixed Xiao Yao\u2019s hair and cloth and sincerely complimented \u201cYour wedding dress is very beautiful, your hairstyle is lovely as well. You are an exquisite bride, the Tu Shan Clan Leader will be very pleased when he sees you.\u201dXiao Yao broke into a beaming smile \u201cThank you!\u201dThe woman startled \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know who wants to kill you?\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t even care to answer, what difference if she knows or not.The woman in purple said \u201cI don\u2019t even know who it is, the person paid an astronomical sum so my partner and I decided to take this job and afterwards we can retire.\u201dThe water lapped at her feet so the woman sealed the crystal coffin tightly before looking skyward \u201cSo annoying, I have to show my demon form again.\u201d She transformed into a seagull and flew into the sky, her clothes burning on the deck and disappearing.The crystal coffin slowly sank into the water.Xiao Yao felt suffocated and couldn\u2019t breathe, until the water seeped into the coffin and she could breathe like a fish returning to the water. Xiao Yao laughed wryly as she thought about this plan and how perfect it was, to kill her with no bloodshed and hidden in the depths of the ocean. Except the plan wasn\u2019t perfect because no one knew that Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t drown.Because she drank the red jade plant wine, Xiao Yao was woozy and found it hard to think. As the coffin sank she thought she was going to die as well and was calmly facing death, except now she wasn\u2019t going to die and felt like a free falling ent.i.ty that couldn\u2019t find an end to the fall.Xiao Yao laid in the crystal coffin and looked at the fishes swimming around her. She tapped on the coffin and asked \u201cHave you guys seen Jing?\u201dThe fishes were startled and swam off. Xiao Yao could only lay in the crystal coffin zoned out.The sun set outside and gradually the water turned dark, as dark as ink. Many fishes glowed in the dark so the water was like a night sky filled with shooting stars. She wondered if Xiao Xiao arrived, whether Zhuan Xu was looking for her, if Miao Pu was crying. Xiao Yao suddenly remembered how angry Zhuan Xu would be and what if he killed Miao Pu. Xiao Yao stopped laying there to enjoy the view and started to try and get out. But no matter how hard she pushed she couldn\u2019t open the coffin.Xiao Yao tried so hard to open the coffin but it wouldn\u2019t budge, until she was all tired out and hungry. She suddenly realized that she might end up dying after all, not of drowning but of hunger. Xiao Yao rested for a bit before continuing to try and open the coffin.Suddenly her instinct sensed danger. She looked around and there wasn\u2019t a fish in sight, the colorful underwater was now pitch black. Xiao Yao felt the entire ocean shaking and she remembered the seagull demon saying how scary the ocean was under here. She suddenly remembered what Xiang Liu said before, that after he escaped from the slave death match ring, he almost died in an underwater tornado called a whirlpool. Xiang Liu may not have been that powerful then but something that almost killed him must really be super scary.Xiao Yao had never seen a whirlpool before but if it was like a tornado on land then anything it pa.s.sed would be obliterated. This really was the perfect way to ensure not a hair of Xiao Yao was left behind.Xiao Yao tried to bust out of the coffin but it still didn\u2019t move, making her understand why the seagull demon took that extra step of sealing her inside the coffin.The water churned around her and the coffin was swept up in the waves of the whirlpool, with Xiao Yao getting spun around so hard she was seeing stars.She could hear the coffin getting crunched and now she prayed for the coffin to stay intact. If the whirlpool was so powerful as to shatter the immovable crystal coffin, then the second the coffin broke Xiao Yao would be crushed to oblivion.As the water churned faster and faster, the power of the whirlpool increased and in a resounding crack the coffin shattered. Xiao Yao screamed and closed her eyes, but then didn\u2019t experience the pain of being smashed to smithereens.Xiao Yao slowly opened her eyes and in the whirling inferno she saw Xiang Liu, white hair white robe, standing right in front of her. His hair was fanned out like the wings of a bird and was protecting Xiao Yao by forming a barrier between her and the whirlpool.Xiao Yao felt like this was a dream and stare dumbfounded at Xiang Liu. He furrowed his brows, clearly he was being affected being in the whirlpool. They were also being carried closer and closer to the center, and by then even Xiang Liu would be crushed.He moved his hands over Xiao Yao\u2019s face and closed her eyes. She heard his voice \u201cI need to revert to my demon form so that we can escape from here. Don\u2019t look!\u201dXiao Yao nodded and felt this humongous impact, like something ripped a hole in the whirlpool. She felt they were far away and the danger was gone. That made her curious and she wanted to open her eyes to see Xiang Liu\u2019s demon form. She hesitated and told herself \u201cjust one peek\u201d before opening her eyes.In the thundering around, she could see a pure white nine-headed sea demon battling with the ocean, with the ocean trying to destroy it but the sea demon taking every hit and bracing for more. This was a battle as powerful as the earth and the sky fighting, without any flowery moves or clever techniques, just brute force against brute force, shaking the world around it.In the heat of battle, Xiang Liu actually sensed Xiao Yao\u2019s tiny move and one head turned to look at her. Xiao Yao immediately closed her eyes and her heart was racing uncontrollably, not because she was scared of him but because she was so awestruck. It was like someone who had never seen the ocean seeing it for the first time, someone who had never seen the mountain seeing it for the first time. It wasn\u2019t about beauty or ugly, it was about being in awe of such power.\u201cI told you not to open your eyes.\u201d Xiang Liu\u2019s icy cold voice rang out.Xiao Yao opened her eyes and saw that they were now on a deserted island. Xiang Liu\u2019s clothes were torn and messy, and his face and neck were covered in injuries.Xiao Yao forced a smile and tried to act nonchalant \u201cI was just curious what your nine heads looked like.\u201d\u201cNow you know!\u201d Xiang Liu turned to leave.\u201cXiang Liu\u2026\u2026Xiang Liu\u2026..\u201d Seeing him about to disappear, Xiao Yao was so anxious she threw herself at him, and Xiang Liu didn\u2019t manage to avoid her and was instead hugged straight on by Xiao Yao. Plus he couldn\u2019t even stand up still and fell down on the sand taking Xiao Yao with him.Xiao Yao worriedly asked \u201cThe injuries are severe, for real?\u201dXiang Liu tried hard to push Xiao Yao away to swim off with the receding tide.Xiao Yao grabbed him and twined herself completely around him, using all her strength so that he couldn\u2019t leave. \u201cI was wrong! I promised to close my eyes and not look but I welshed on my promise and secretly opened my eyes! I just\u2026\u2026..just\u2026\u2026.I admit it was my pathetic curiosity! I wanted to know what you really looked like. I was wrong! I was wrong\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe waves crashed on the beach with a roar and retreated with a howl, the two of them were covered by the waves and emerged again and again so Xiao Yao\u2019s voice was sometimes audible and other times m.u.f.fled. It wasn\u2019t clear how much Xiang Liu heard but it was clear he wasn\u2019t going to accept her apology as he continued over and over to push her off him.He managed to shove her off once more and Xiao Yao got so frantic she hooked her arms around his legs and jumped up to pounce on him, using her body to tightly grab him and pull him down again. Xiang Liu had no strength left to push Xiao Yao off but he was like a terribly stubborn child and continued to wriggle under her.The water around them was seeped with red, clearly Xiang Liu\u2019s injuries were bleeding and Xiao Yao begged \u201cI\u2019m wrong! I\u2019m really wrong! If you want to hit me or punish me, whatever you want is fine! Just please stop moving around!\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cNo! Not until you first promise me not to leave!\u201dXiang Liu was furious and his fangs bared \u201cDon\u2019t push me to eat you!\u201d\u201cIf you want to eat me then eat me!\u201dXiang Liu jerked Xiao Yao into his arms and bit down on her neck in one move. Xiao Yao\u2019s body s.h.i.+vered and then she fell slack, docilely nestled into Xiang Liu to accommodate him.Injured Xiang Liu was like a dying of thirst traveler in the desert encountering an oasis, drinking up her blood in big gulps. Xiao Yao rested her head on his neck and closed her eyes, feeling only the rising and falling of the tides around her.It wasn\u2019t clear how much time pa.s.sed when Xiang Liu stopped drinking her blood. Xiao Yao drowsily opened her eyes \u201cYou can drink more, I\u2019m fine.\u201dXiang Liu raised his head to look up at the star-filled sky and the hazy moonlight \u201cAren\u2019t you scared one whit? You should know a demon is a demon, when gravely injured will lose control and revert to basic instinct. I could have sucked you dry!\u201dXiao Yao softly touched the corner of his lips with a trace of blood on it and tenderly said \u201cYou\u2019re the one who is scared!\u201dXiang Liu scoffed \u201cI\u2019m scared?\u201d\u201cI saw your demon form, and it wasn\u2019t hideous at all! And you didn\u2019t suck me dry either!\u201d Xiang Liu stared darkly at Xiao Yao and she got up her courage to continue \u201cYour form is larger than me\u2026\u2026uhm, okay! So it\u2019s not just larger, it\u2019s much much bigger\u2026\u2026and you have more heads than I do, just eight more only\u2026..but the laws of nature didn\u2019t say that a one headed type like me is the norm, right? It just happens that us one headed types are the majority, if nine headed types like you were the majority, I would feel self-conscious that I only have one head.\u201d\u201cYou have so much energy, clearly I should suck some more of your blood!\u201d Xiang Liu still had a p.i.s.sy face but when he leaned down to bit Xiao Yao\u2019s neck and began sucking, Xiao Yao felt only a frisson of excitement and tingling, with no feeling of pain.Xiao Yao said \u201cHey! Hey! I was just being polite just now. And you\u2019re really sucking again? A demon really is a demon\u2026..\u201d And with that Xiao Yao fell asleep and finally stopped talking.Xiang Liu stopped drinking and lifted his head to stare quietly at the sleeping Xiao Yao in his arms.Xiao Yao woke up lured by the delicious smell of food. She opened her eyes and saw Xiang Liu by the fire roasting fish. The fish was already golden and crispy, the fat dripping into the fire. Xiao Yao crawled over on her arms and legs and stared at the fish while asking in longing \u201cCan I eat it?\u201dXiang Liu placed the fish on a large sh.e.l.l plate and handed it to her, on the white sh.e.l.l was a side of vegetables made with seaweed.Xiao Yao swallowed and started gobbling down the food. She didn\u2019t even stop to talk until all the fish and seaweed was in her belly before sighing \u201cSo good! So so good!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just hungry.\u201d Xiang Liu handed over a sh.e.l.l bowl with piping hot seafood soup and Xiao Yao took it with both hands and slowly sipped it.After finis.h.i.+ng the soup Xiao Yao said \u201cThank you!\u201dXiang Liu coldly replied \u201cNo need! This is the payment for your blood.\u201dXiao Yao pouted \u201cAm I worth so little?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cMy thank you was for saving me! You haven\u2019t forgotten why you were injured in the first place, right?\u201dXiang Liu furrowed his brows \u201cIt\u2019s not that I wanted to save you, I simply have no interest to use my own life to confirm the words of the Voodoo King.\u201dOh! Right, the Lover\u2019s Bug! The Lover\u2019s Bug does not live alone, if she died then likely Xiang Liu would die. Xiao Yao smiled sadly \u201cNo matter what, thank you for saving me.\u201dXiang Liu asked \u201cWhy were you imprisoned in the ocean?\u201d\u201cSomeone wanted to kill me.\u201dXiang Liu stared in disgust at Xiao Yao \u201cSomeone wanted to kill you, so you let yourself get imprisoned?\u201dXiao Yao stared at the fire and said nothing.Xiang Liu pressed on \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight back?\u201dXiao Yao said in a low voice \u201cJing\u2026\u2026disappeared.\u201d She suddenly remembered and anxiously asked \u201cThe East Sea is like your home. You\u2026.you\u2026.have you seen Jing?\u201dXiang Liu mockingly said \u201cDo you think I spend my time hanging in the ocean just waiting to rescue people?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026.I just thought\u2026.Qing Shui Town is also your territory of sorts, perhaps you noticed Tu Shan Hou\u2019s activities. The East Sea may be big but you\u2019re a sea demon\u2026.so maybe\u2026..\u201dXiang Liu coldly replied \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many maybes!\u201dXiao Yao lowered her head and her tears came down silently.Xiang Liu turned around to stare at the ocean expanse, with his back to Xiao Yao, but even then he clearly heard her tears falling. One drop after another, so soft and bunched together, the sound entered his ears like a sharp thorn p.r.i.c.k, each drop a stab to his heart.Xiang Liu said \u201cIf you have time to cry, use it to think about who tried to kill you.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly remembered Miao Pu and used her sleeve to wipe away her tears \u201cI have to go back, otherwise Zhuan Xu will kill Miao Pu for sure!\u201d\u201cEven if the Black Emperor wanted to kill Miao Pu, he\u2019d have to find her first.\u201dXiao Yao remembered the seagull demon mentioning a partner. Miao Pu never came to rescue her which meant she likely encountered the other killer. Xiao Yao\u2019s face fell \u201cMiao Pu\u2026..is Miao Pu dead?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! When I rushed over all I saw were two winged horse corpses in the water. She likely was attacked but I didn\u2019t see her body.\u201d Xiao Yao sighed in relief until Xiang Liu added \u201cShe could have sunk into the ocean.\u201dXiang Liu always had a way of making her grateful to him in one second, and the other want to choke him to death. Xiao Yao was anxious and upset but there was nothing she could do to Xiang Liu for being mean \u201cI need to find Miao Pu, you take me back to that island.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cI happen to have free time, I can accompany you to go look for Miao Pu.\u201d\u201cWhen did you become so nice?\u201d\u201cOf course there is a price.\u201d\u201cI only have one head so can\u2019t outthink your nine heads. I don\u2019t think this deal is going to be good.\u201dXiang Liu vaulted into the ocean without a care about Xiao Yao\u2019s reverse psychology negotiating tactics. Xiao Yao anxiously jumped into the ocean after him and grabbed a lock of his flowing white hair.Xiang Liu turned around and glared at her so Xiao Yao let go with a smile \u201cYou help me find the seagull demon and I agree to your price.\u201d The seagull demon chose to let the whirlpool swallow her up forever, clearly she knew this ocean expanse very well. Only with Xiang Liu\u2019s help could Xiao Yao hope to find her quickly.Xiang Liu rose up from the ocean to stand on the waves. His white hair like the clouds, his white robe like the snow, the silver moonlight made him look even more n.o.ble and ethereal, except his expression looking down at Xiao Yao was filled with an evil smirk \u201cAny price I want?\u201dXiao Yao stood up on the waves and raised her chin to look at Xiang Liu \u201cAs long as it has nothing to do with Zhuan Xu, then any price is fine!\u201d For Miao Pu, even if she had to make a real deal with the devil she would do it. At this point what else did she have left to lose?Xiang Liu said \u201cThe price is for you to stay alive! Even if Tu Shan Jing is really dead, you have to stay alive!\u201dXiao Yao stared dumbstruck at Xiang Liu before her eyes went beyond him to stare at the limitless ocean horizon. A life that was long, a longing that had no end in sight\u2026\u2026if she didn\u2019t give up and stayed alive, what would that feel like? Probably like a dark night with no sunrise. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand why Xiang Liu cared about her life or death.Xiang Liu coldly said \u201cI just don\u2019t have any interest to die with you! If you want to give up, then first find the way to break the voodoo bug link.\u201dRight! Her life was connected to Xiang Liu. She really did need to find the solution to break the spell. Xiao Yao said \u201cI accept your price so take me to find the seagull demon!\u201dXiang Liu summoned his gold crowned white condor Furball and vaulted on with Xiao Yao.They were already in the deep ocean but still there was more out there. Furball flew all night but the ocean beneath still looked the same. From above there was still no land in sight, just endless ocean beneath. Xiao Yao said \u201cThe ocean really can swallow everything.\u201dXiang Liu casually said \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.Xiao Yao saw a s.h.i.+p below and Miao Pu was unconscious on the deck. The seagull demon was wearing bright red and currently arguing with a man. The man had his back to Xiao Yao so she couldn\u2019t see his face. He was wearing coa.r.s.e clothes that had been washed so many times it was white, his body tall but on the thin side. He didn\u2019t look like a killer at all.\u201cKill her! If you don\u2019t kill her then the Black Emperor and the Yellow Emperor will surely find us! Do you want to die? I said kill her!\u201d The seagull demon was so furious she was apoplectic to the point she wanted to kill the man in front of her but didn\u2019t dare make a move.The man didn\u2019t appear to like to talk so he just ignored the seagull demon\u2019s screaming and calmly said \u201cNo kill!\u201dXiang Liu flew down on Furball without even trying to conceal himself. Xiao Yao whispered \u201cThey are killers! It\u2019s two against one, how\u2019s your injuries?\u201dXiang Liu glanced at Xiao Yao \u201cTwo against two.\u201dXiao Yao rolled her eyes, unsure whether she should be happy that Xiang Liu thought so highly of her, so angry that Xiang Liu thought so highly of her.The seagull demon was so angry she didn\u2019t even sense their approach but the man did. He turned around like a beast ready to attack, his entire being radiating danger. Xiao Yao actually felt this overwhelming fear and wanted to back up, thankfully Xiang Liu radiated even more danger so the man stared intently at Xiang Liu and backed up one step.Xiang Liu and Xiao Yao jumped onto the deck and the seagull demon stared in shock \u201cYou\u2026.you\u2019re not dead?\u201dXiao Yao smiled and twirled once \u201cNot dead, and from head to toe perfect as can be.\u201dThe seagull demon glanced behind Xiao Yao at the white hair white robed man with beautiful features standing there, suddenly remembering the legend of a very famous demon in the vast wilderness. Her face fell and she immediately moved behind her partner, but she still incredulously asked \u201cXiang Liu? Nine Lives Xiang Liu?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t even spare the seagull demon a look, clearly he didn\u2019t even consider her a threat. All his attention was on the man in front, the two were like two beasts poised, neither moving but both waiting to find each other\u2019s weakness.Xiao Yao stared at the cowering seagull demon and laughed \u201cWhat if he is Xiang Liu? Or isn\u2019t Xiang Liu?\u201dThe seagull demon said \u201cHe can\u2019t be Xiang Liu. You are the Yellow Emperor\u2019s granddaughter, there is no way he would save you.\u201dSo even the demons who didn\u2019t care about human relations.h.i.+ps and emotions saw her relations.h.i.+p and connection with Xiang Liu the same way as everyone in the vast wilderness did, that it couldn\u2019t possibly happen. Xiao Yao was suddenly p.i.s.sy and didn\u2019t want to taunt the seagull demon anymore. She put on a stern expression \u201cGive my maid back!\u201dAt that moment, the skinny pale young man suddenly launched an attack like a tiger pouncing towards Xiang Liu. The seagull demon reverted to her bird form and flew into the air, abandoning her partner just like that.Xiao Yao\u2019s archery skill was so good she could have taken down the seagull demon, but Xiang Liu was severely injured and she was so worried about him she didn\u2019t even care about chasing the seagull demon. Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes were locked on the attacking young man.Xiang Liu and the young man quickly sparred before breaking apart again. The young man\u2019s chest was rising and falling rapidly while his eyes were locked on Xiang Liu, who looked very relaxed and said with a laugh \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t you recognize this little beast?\u201dXiao Yao did feel like she knew the young man so she stared long and hard at him. The young man seemed affected when he heard her name, but right now he was like an animal caught in the claws of a stronger beast so he didn\u2019t dare move to try and get a good look at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao saw the young man was missing an ear and finally remembered who he was. That slave who endured forty years and finally won his freedom! Xiao Yao happily ran over to him \u201cHey! How come you became a killer for hire? I\u2019m Xiao Yao, do you still remember me?\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t try and stop her, like allowing a small animal to go investigate a larger beast or not interfering with a child playing. He only stared intently at the young man, and if he made even the hint of attacking then Xiang Liu would kill him in an instant.The young man also sensed that Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t going to kill him right now, but he didn\u2019t want Xiang Liu to get the wrong impression so he still didn\u2019t dare move. He only looked over at Xiao Yao and tried hard to smile, but since the young man rarely smiled the expression was really awkward.The young man said \u201cI am Left Ear.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou\u2019re using the name I gave you! You still remember me then?\u201dLeft Ear said \u201cI remember.\u201d He would never ever be able to forget her or the man she called Bei.Xiao Yao asked \u201cAll these years, how have you been?\u201d\u201cYour money, used it up, so hungry, near death, kill people, can earn money.\u201dXiao Yao was startled and counted on her fingers before turning to Xiang Liu \u201cHe used fourteen words to describe tens of years of his life. He\u2019s the other extreme from me, I could have used up fourteen hours to tell my story.\u201dXiang Liu laughed \u201cAre you sure fourteen hours is enough for you? You pushed a monkey to bash his head against a rock wall to commit suicide rather than hear you keep talking, fourteen hours is not nearly enough!\u201dLeft Ear saw that Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t going to interfere so he ran over and picked up Miao Pu \u201cFor you, don\u2019t want your money!\u201dXiao Yao examined Miao Pu and found her fine and just pa.s.sed out. She fed Miao Pu a pill before moving her to the inside cabin to rest.Xiang Liu asked Left Ear \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill Miao Pu?\u201dXiao Yao walked out of the cabin \u201cYes, why didn\u2019t you kill her?\u201d With Left Ear\u2019s personality and background, if he attacked it would be swift and ruthless, but Miao Pu was only slightly injured.Left Ear said \u201cShe smelled like your scent.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and realized why. Back then she often went to the flower demon shops to play with Xiang Liu, and tried many different essences. She thought it fun to combine essences into unique scents and made some which she gave to Ah Nian and Xing Yue. She kept one for herself that she named \u201cdream\u201d, and later Miao Pu liked it so Xiao Yao gave it all to her after getting bored with using it herself.Xiao Yao mused with a sigh \u201cI haven\u2019t played with scents in a long time, but it\u2019s been tens of years and you still remember the scent?\u201dLeft Ear said \u201cI remember!\u201d Back then he was dirty and smelly and everyone shrank away from him, too scared to even get close. Xiao Yao\u2019s hug was the first time anyone had ever hugged him. He didn\u2019t know what Xiao Yao was thinking but he forever memorized her unique smell. It was a scent that was present yet drifting, distant yet close, like a starry sky in a summer\u2019s night.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the vagaries of life, who knew her one casual action so many years ago would end up saving Miao Pu\u2019s life today.Xiang Liu asked Left Ear \u201cWho hired you to kill Xiao Yao?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Seagull said she would kill the other and sent me to kill her.\u201d Left Ear pointed to Miao Pu inside the cabin. \u201cAfter it was done, Seagull was going to give me ten gold coins and said I could use it to buy a plot of land in the countryside and take a wife to settle down.\u201dXiao Yao was furious \u201cWhat? She only gave you ten gold coins? How could I be worth so little! She totally tricked you!\u201dLeft Ear lowered his head and stared at his toes before saying dejectedly \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was you. I shouldn\u2019t have accepted.\u201dXiao Yao patted him on the shoulder \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re all fine right!\u201dA resounding condor cry reached them and Furball came flying back with a seagull in his claws. He proudly circled above them a few times and intentionally called out to Xiao Yao. That\u2019s when Xiao Yao realized that Xiang Liu\u2019s \u201ctwo against two\u201d was referring to himself and Furball, not Xiao Yao. He didn\u2019t even count Xiao Yao in the fight.Furball got his fill of showing off and landed on the deck. He stood on one foot and used the other to hold the seagull.The seagull was so scared she was s.h.i.+vering underfoot, pleading \u201cI didn\u2019t know Ms. Xi Ling was the friend of the Great General Xiang Liu. Will General Xiang Liu spare my life seeing as we\u2019re all demons. I promise to never make the same mistake again!\u201dXiang Liu asked \u201cThe ident.i.ty of your employer?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. The other side clearly knew Ms. Xi Ling\u2019s ident.i.ty was special so took extra precautions when meeting with me. I only heard his voice but that could be faked as well.\u201dXiang Liu coldly scoffed and Furball pressed own hard so the seagull cried out in pain \u201cThere is a song lyric written on cloth that the other side said would make Ms. Xi Ling agree to do what I asked. But neither Left Ear nor I know how to read so I don\u2019t know what the lyrics said.\u201d Reading is only what the n.o.bility and above had the ability to learn, forget a killer like the seagull demon, even many generals and commanders in the kingdoms didn\u2019t know how to read.Furball used his beak to pluck off a thatch of seagull\u2019s fur so she screamed \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else, nothing else! General please spare me\u2026.please spare my life!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cDon\u2019t ask anymore, if I really died there would be no trace but now I\u2019m alive there are plenty of traces to find out who.\u201dXiang Liu asked Xiao Yao \u201cDo you have an idea who?\u201dXiao Yao looked solemn \u201cThe voice in the message jewel was Jing, the lyrics in the cloth was a song I sang for Jing. Even the cloth was Jing\u2019s favorite type. The person who wants to kill me must be very close to Jing. I\u2019m not certain yet but have a strong hunch.\u201dFurball flapped his wings excitedly towards Xiang Liu who nodded his head. Before Xiao Yao could react, a scream rendered the air as Furball\u2019s claw dug into the seagull before he picked her up with his beak and went inside the cabin to enjoy his meal.Xiang Liu didn\u2019t even blink and even Left Ear was calm and unaffected, like Furball just captured some random seagull and was eating it. Xiao Yao lived in the mountains for tens of years and understood the laws of nature among the beasts, to eat one\u2019s own kill. She knew this was the law of the demons, the strong winning over the weak. The difference even between the people and the demons was simply one cooked their food first and the other ate it raw. But hearing the sound from the cabin still made Xiao Yao feel uncomfortable so she asked Xiang Liu \u201cI know you\u2019re going to mock me, rightly so, for being so missish, but can you ask Furball to eat his meal somewhere else?\u201dXiang Liu raised an eyebrow at Xiao Yao \u201cFurball, did you hear that?\u201dFurball huffed a few times in annoyance at Xiao Yao before flying into the sky with the seagull in his beak.Without Furball noisily eating, Xiao Yao pressed her luck with Xiang Liu \u201cCan you use your powers to clean off the deck. It smells like gross blood!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t find it annoying.\u201d Xiang Liu leaned against the railing, clearly not planning to make Xiao Yao more comfortable.Left Ear immediately grabbed some water and started cleaning the deck. Xiao Yao was touched and helped him out while loudly talking about how different some demons can be from one another.After finis.h.i.+ng, Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes were seeing stars \u201cDo you have anything to eat?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Left Ear ran into the cabin and brought out some food. Xiao Yao found a shaded area and sat down to eat with Left Ear. After finis.h.i.+ng, Xiao Yao drank some wine and asked \u201cI told you to go to Sheng Nong Mountain to look for Zhuan Xu. If you were hungry who didn\u2019t you go there?\u201d\u201cToo far. So hungry couldn\u2019t even walk. Later got money, buy food, no need to go.\u201dXiao Yao thought he must\u2019ve reached the East Sea by then and with no money to get a winged ride he couldn\u2019t make it to Sheng Nong Mountain. \u201cSo that\u2019s what happened.\u201dLeft Ear asked \u201cWho is Zhuan Xu?\u201dEveryone knew the Black Emperor but very few people knew his real name so Xiao Yao said \u201cThe Black Emperor.\u201d\u201cWhat about the man who was with you before? You called him Bei.\u201d Left Ear saw Bei many times in the slave death match arena, but he was always wearing a dog face mask so Left Ear didn\u2019t know what Bei looked like.Xiao Yao looked at Xiang Liu just as he glanced at her and the two\u2019s eyes met. Xiao Yao immediately looked away and said to Left Ear \u201cHe died.\u201dLeft Ear\u2019s normally dispa.s.sionate eyes turned sad. In his heart, Bei wasn\u2019t just someone who experienced the same fate as him, he was also Left Ear\u2019s teacher that guided him to be reborn. Many times when Left Ear collapsed from a severe injury, feeling like not a shred of hope was left, he would see Bei silently sitting in the audience staring at him. He never said anything, but Bei\u2019s presence was enough to convey warmth and hope to Left Ear. It gave him strength to stand back up one more time. Left Ear\u2019s grat.i.tude to Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t just because she hugged him and gave him a sack of money, it was also because Xiao Yao and Bei\u2019s relations.h.i.+p. Because Xiao Yao accepted his own species, because she was friends with his own species.Left Ear asked \u201cDo you miss him.\u201dXiao Yao sighed and didn\u2019t answer.Left Ear was persistent and stared at Xiao Yao to ask again \u201cHe\u2019s not here anymore, do you miss him?\u201dXiao Yao cried out \u201cYes!\u201dLeft Ear smiled \u201cThat will make him very happy!\u201dXiao Yao stared at Xiang Liu as she said to Left Ear \u201cYou\u2019re not him, how do you know whether he cares that someone misses him? He totally wouldn\u2019t care!\u201dLeft Ear\u2019s express was dead serious, and he normally spoke so little and cared not to explain anything, but now he was very agitated and said \u201cI know! We slaves are never scared of death! We\u2019re not scared of anything, other than being scared of the dark! If I died and someone missed me\u2026.\u201d Left Ear used his fist to hit his chest \u201cthen it wouldn\u2019t be dark here, it would be very bright and very happy!\u201dXiao Yao asked Xiang Liu \u201cIs what he\u2019s saying true?\u201dXiang Liu smirked at Xiao Yao and teased \u201cYou actually want to believe that? I totally don\u2019t care!\u201cI must be crazy then, to have believed it!\u201d Xiao Yao laughed heartily and used that exaggerated gesture to snap the tenuous mood between them. She said to Left Ear \u201cCan you steer the s.h.i.+p? If you can then let\u2019s sail the s.h.i.+p back to land!\u201d\u201cI can.\u201d Left Ear raised the sails and took the wheel to turn the s.h.i.+p towards land.Xiao Yao walked over to Xiang Liu \u201cIt\u2019s another 4 or 5 days until we reach land. We\u2019re the only s.h.i.+p in the ocean here so it\u2019s very safe so you can heal.\u201dXiang Liu looked out at the ocean and remained silent. Xiao Yao thought he was turning her down when she heard \u201cFine.\u201dXiang Liu pointed at the earnestly steering the s.h.i.+p Left Ear \u201cWhat are you going to do with him when you reach land? Let him continue to roam and be a cut rate killer for hire? What happens if he does it long and turns into a real bad guy, or get killed by someone else?\u201dLeft Ear heard what Xiang Liu said and grumbled \u201cI can feed myself!\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Left Ear \u201cYou can work for the seagull demon then you can also work for me! I can feed you!\u201dLeft Ear happily said \u201cFine, I\u2019ll kill people for you.\u201dXiao Yao shuddered and said with a wry laugh \u201cI\u2019m not hiring you to kill people!\u201d\u201cI only know how to kill people.\u201d Left Ear was very calm but his eyes betrayed his sadness. From when he had a memory he was a slave and his only ability was to kill people.Xiao Yao stopped teasing and solemnly said \u201cI want you to be my bodyguard, normally you don\u2019t need to kill people but if someone tries to kill me then you kill them to protect me, okay?\u201dLeft Ear stared at Xiao Yao, trying to decide if she really needed protection or was just pitying him.Xiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019m not pitying you, I really need protecting. You saw yourself that someone wants to kill me. I don\u2019t have my own bodyguard, and Miao Pu was a.s.signed to me by Zhuan Xu but she can\u2019t even beat you. You\u2019re really powerful, if you agree to protect me then I\u2019m the one who is getting the better end of the bargain.\u201dLeft Ear\u2019s eyes lit up and he happily said \u201cI will! I will be your bodyguard!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThen it\u2019s set, in the future you will protect me and I will ensure you have food to eat and clothes to wear, and I\u2019ll find you a wife.\u201dLeft Ear\u2019s pale face blushed slowly so he focused on steering the s.h.i.+p and avoided looking at Xiao Yao and Xiang Liu.Xiao Yao smiled and looked at Left Ear, feeling this hard to grasp feeling inside. Many years ago, was Xiang Liu just like this? Appearing dangerous and deadly, but actually simple and straightforward. If back then she could have met Xiang Liu, could he have found the woman he loved? Would he take her to buy perfumes at the flower demon shops? Go eat at hard to find restaurants in little alleys\u2026\u2026.Xiao Yao glanced at Xiang Liu but he was standing with his profile to her, looking at the ocean with a small warm smile on his lips. Because of the angle, his smile made his face no longer cold but instead splashed with a sliver of warmth.Xiao Yao stared for a while before looking away so that she could sort out all the jumbled feelings in her heart. She went inside the cabin to check on Miao Pu, feeding her another pill and some water before heading outside .Xiao Yao found a shaded corner to sit down, looking up at the blue sky and hearing the sea birds crying, and with that she drowsily fell asleep.Xiang Liu\u2019s voice suddenly called out \u201cBased on your deduction, who do you think tried to kill you?\u201dXiao Yao sleepily opened her eyes \u201cJing\u2019s voice in the message jewel is easy to fake since many have heard him speak, but the song lyrics on the cloth only Jing and his servants, my maids, and Feng Long and Xing Yue know it. Not even Zhuan Xu has heard me sing it! My maids would never, Jing\u2019s servants would not betray him, so that only leaves Xing Yue and Feng Long. And only they would have the ability to pay the sky high price the seagull demon named.\u201d\u201cChi Sui Feng Long? Sheng Nong Xing Yue?\u201d\u201cYes. But I can\u2019t figure out why. The only beef I have with them is running away from the wedding but so many years have pa.s.sed. Feng Long really doesn\u2019t seem to care anymore, and I may not be close with Xing Yue but there is nothing between us other than what happened with me and Feng Long. Even if she hated me, it can\u2019t be to the degree of having me killed.\u201d Xiao Yao waved her hand as if trying to shoo away a fly \u201cForget it, don\u2019t want to think about it!\u201dXiao Yao acted like a Great General and an Empress was no big deal, but neither were ordinary people so it didn\u2019t matter which one did it, if there is a first time then there would be further attempts. Next time she might not be so lucky. Even Left Eat didn\u2019t agree and grumbled \u201cThey should be killed.\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cThis isn\u2019t the wilderness or the mountains, you can\u2019t kill people just because you think they pose a danger.\u201d The world was just at the early days of peace, Feng Long and Xing Yue\u2019s ident.i.ties were very touchy and Zhuan Xu was trying to placate everyone and meld the groups together. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want her personal issue to cause a headache for Zhuan Xu, or cause tribal strife and conflict.The s.h.i.+p was sailing smoothly westward, a flock of white sea birds circled overhead and periodically dived down into the water. Xiang Liu stared at the birds and slowly said \u201cThe Wen Xiao Liu I knew a long time ago had many deficiencies, but the one deficiency not there was to roll over and accept a beating like an idiot. Has Tu Shan Jing taken such good care of you all these years that you\u2019ve forgotten how to stay alive now that he\u2019s dead?\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t handle anyone talking about Jing being dead so she glared at Xiang Liu.Xiang Liu sneered right back and said in a sarcastic way \u201cDid I say anything wrong? You may not be in the wilderness or the mountains but you\u2019re in a place even more dangerous, Sheng Nong Mountain. The most dangerous beast at most eats you. But in Sheng Nong Mountain, your death affects so much more, do you know how many people will die if you died? Chi Sui Feng Long smashed the tradition of the Four Great Clans and now with the Tu Shan clan leader suddenly killed and leaving behind a child successor, if you died then the Tu Shan Clan may be picked apart and taken over by the three other clans. In the face of power and wealth, people are even brave enough to try and kill an Emperor, what\u2019s stopping them from trying to kill you? I really regret getting my life connected with as stupid a woman as you! I beg of you, before you die from idiocy can you find a way to break our bug link first!\u201dXiao Yao walked to the edge of the s.h.i.+p and looked out at the wide expanse of the ocean, the wind whipping her red wedding dress around her like a dance, and the red sunset behind her illuminated her vivid color so much that the red dress looked like blood was dripping from it.The sun gradually set and the moon rose from the ocean surface. Xiao Yao pointed and said to Xiang Liu \u201cLook!\u201dXiang Liu stared coldly at her and didn\u2019t move but Left Ear turned to look at the moon and said \u201cVery round moon!\u201dXiao Yao burst out laughing while staring at the moon \u201cJing picked the full moon night to get married. I wanted to ask him why but was too embarra.s.sed to, and figured I could ask him after the wedding since we had plenty of time. The last time I saw him was 32 days ago, he came to Xiao Yue Peak to see me and was supposed to leave before dinner but stayed until long after dinner, until the moon rose high over the mountain. We walked in the moonlight along the mountain paths, the moon was very beautiful that night. I pulled him to dance as I sang but he didn\u2019t know how so I laughed at him for being so silly. Later he left on his winged ride and pointed to the moon and said \u201cAt the next full moon, no matter if the moon is bright or dark, if people gather or part, I will be with you forever, never apart.\u201dXiao Yao suddenly started singing towards the ocean.If beloved is wind above the waterTo see and to missIf beloved is the cloud in the skyTo love and to cherishIf beloved was the tree in the forestTogether and connectedWhy does the world have sadnessOnly wish with belovedTogether forever, never apartThe silver moonlight lent an air of desolation around as the waves crested glittering in soft folds. Xiao Yao pointed at the moon with a smile \u201cIf I don\u2019t see his body then in my memory he will always be on the back of his crane smiling at me while pointing to the moon to say \u201cAt the next full moon, no matter if the moon is bright or dark, if people gather or part, I will be with you forever, never apart.\u201d I likely am very stupid and very weak, I can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s dead and feel that he may come back at the next full moon.\u201dXiao Yao whirled around and stared with bright eyes at Xiang Liu and said in a strong voice \u201cXiang Liu, I don\u2019t have a way to break our bug link right now. Sheng Nong Mountain is rife with danger but Qing Shui Town isn\u2019t any better. It\u2019s unclear who will drag the other down. Rather than worry that I\u2019ll be a ha.s.sle to you, why don\u2019t you worry about yourself first!\u201dXiao Yao walked up to Xiang Liu and lifted up her arm from under her sleeve \u201cWhile I\u2019m still here to give you blood, hurry up and get better so you don\u2019t burden me!\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t even act polite and took her arm to bite down and suck.During the rest of the trip, every dawn and dusk Xiang Liu would drink Xiao Yao\u2019s blood, and sometimes they would say a few words to one another, other times stay silent. One would sit with her arms wrapped around her knees staring sadly at the ocean as if waiting, the other would sit cross-legged facing the ocean healing with no expression on his face. After three days, Xiang Liu finished healing and stood up. He said to Left Ear \u201cThank you for giving me a ride.\u201dLeft Ear asked \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201dXiao Yao turned around and appeared to want to say something but ended up closing her mouth again.Xiang Liu said \u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll encounter the people sent by the Black Emperor to search for Xiao Yao.\u201d He tossed a little jewel to Xiao Yao before vaulting off the s.h.i.+p to land on the water surface.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Xiao Yao asked.\u201cA sea map. If you don\u2019t have ability to survive on Sheng Nong Mountain, then come to the ocean. This sea map is but a small portion of the ocean but with your body in no time you\u2019ll be like a fish as familiar with the ocean.\u201dXiao Yao remembered what Xiang Liu said before, there are countless islands in the vast ocean, some with nothing on it, others as beautiful as a dream.\u201cI don\u2019t need this!\u201d Xiao Yao wanted to toss the jewel back but Xiang Liu was already walking away, stepping on the emerald waves headed North until his form disappeared.Left Ear watched Xiao Yao continue to stare at the direction where Xiang Liu vanished.After a long long time, Xiao Yao finally looked away and carefully tucked the sea map jewel away. She said to Left Ear \u201cTomorrow I will wake Miao Pu up, don\u2019t let her know that Xiang Liu was ever here. And never tell anyone that Xiang Liu killed the seagull. If anyone asks, say that you brought Miao Pu back on the s.h.i.+p and learned the seagull wanted to kill me so you killed her and saved me.\u201dLeft Ear nodded his head.Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t afraid Left Ear couldn\u2019t tell a lie, he was just so straightforward he never bothered to before.At dawn, Xiao Yao woke Miao Pu up and she was immediately in tears to see Xiao Yao alive. She then howled with rage when she saw Left Ear and rushed over to attack him. Xiao Yao yelled \u201cHe\u2019s on our side!\u201dMiao Pu heard it but she was so furious at Left Ear she continued to attack and Left Ear didn\u2019t even try to fight back so she landed two good punches on him, and appeared to want to continue.Xiao Yao harshly yelled \u201cMiao Pu, stop!\u201dMiao Pu finally stopped and Xiao Yao chided her \u201cI said he was on our side, what are you doing? If he beat you then you\u2019re simply not as strong as him, why get so angry you want to kill him now?\u201dMiao Pu was angry and embarra.s.sed, saying through tears \u201cI want to beat him up not because he defeated me, but because\u2026..he hara.s.sed me!\u201dLeft Ear hara.s.s a girl? Xiao Yao was so excited she asked \u201cHow did he hara.s.s you?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t move and he was sniffing all over my body.\u201dXiao Yao understood but to explain why to Miao Pu would involve talking about Bei, and Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to talk about Bei so she ordered \u201cLeft Ear didn\u2019t mean it, he was just curious and used scent to determine the situation. He didn\u2019t mean to hara.s.s you so you let this go. From now on Left Ear is serving me so you don\u2019t be mean to him!\u201dHow could she be mean to him? Miao Pu glared at Left Ear and said nothing. She was one of the guards trained by Zhuan Xu and had seen all types of kill attacks but when she saw Left Ear tear the winged horses apart with his bare hands even she was taken aback. She believed then that Left Ear would take the most direct and b.l.o.o.d.y approach to killing anything.An hour later they encountered a s.h.i.+p searching for Xiao Yao, and Xiao Xiao happened to be on that s.h.i.+p. She collapsed on the deck after seeing Xiao Yao hale and hearty. Xiao Yao rushed over to help her up but Xiao Xiao\u2019s expression was wan and exhausted.Xiao Yao apologized for alarming Xiao Xiao who explained \u201cI\u2019m fine but His Majesty has been so worried about the Miss that he doesn\u2019t eat or sleep. Miss needs to hurry back with me now to see His Majesty.\u201dXiao Yao said to Left Ear \u201cI need to go first, you stay with the s.h.i.+p and come later.\u201d Xiao Yao ordered Miao Pu \u201cLeft Ear is new here and doesn\u2019t know anything, you take care of him.\u201dMiao Pu rolled her eyes \u201cWhen he does anything it\u2019s the most vicious attack, who would dare do anything to him.\u201dXiao Yao knew Miao Pu just had a tart tongue and laughingly smacked her before saying to Left Ear \u201cMiao Pu has a tough demeanor but a soft heart, ignore whatever she says and just stick with her!\u201dXiao Xiao took Xiao Yao on the winged ride and rushed to see the Black Emperor.After half a day, Xiao Yao saw an island that was the one she landed on with Miao Pu that day. The winged horses were still dead on the gra.s.s and the area covered with dark blood. Zhuan Xu wasn\u2019t even avoiding the disgusting surroundings and was instead sitting in the b.l.o.o.d.y gra.s.s and staring in a daze out at the ocean. His clothing was covered with blood and gra.s.s stains so much that it wasn\u2019t even clear what the original color was. His face was dark with stubble and his hair a wild mess, nearly unable to make out his original visage.Xiao Yao walked over in shock and asked \u201cZhuan Xu, is that you?\u201dZhuan Xu slowly turned his head and happily followed by nervousness flitted past \u201cXiao Yao, is that you?\u201dXiao Yao walked over and knelt down to touch his messy hair \u201cYes! It\u2019s me! My G.o.d, how did you end up this way?\u201d\u201cNot an illusion?\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s had dark circles under his eyes, clearly he hadn\u2019t slept in days. Xiao Yao\u2019s heart ached and she hugged him tight \u201cNo, I\u2019m not an illusion! I\u2019m sorry, I was wrong, I was wrong\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dZhuan Xu finally believed that Xiao Yao was back alive beside him and the sense of elation was combined with even more fear of losing her. He tightly embraced her back as if he wanted to chain her beside him forever, never to lose her again. \u201cYou\u2019re back! You\u2019re really back! It\u2019s been hundreds of years since I was truly afraid, but these past few days I was abjectly terrified!\u201dXiao Yao laid her head on Zhuan Xu\u2019s shoulder as her tears came down \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s my fault for being so careless.\u201dXiao Yao silently cried and was too scared to tell Zhuan Xu that she almost gave up! She forgot what she went through, she forgot about Zhuan Xu, she didn\u2019t try to escape and stay alive, she just wanted to end her pain. She promised to Zhuan Xu \u201cI won\u2019t ever do it again.\u201dZhuan Xu thought she meant that she wouldn\u2019t easily trust and fall into a trap again. He patted her on the back \u201cI won\u2019t give you a chance to make the same mistake.\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes flowed his uncontrollable anguish.Xiao Yao wiped her tears away and purposely acted upset \u201cYou smell!\u201dZhuan Xu smelled himself and agreed \u201cI do stink, but why do I stink like this?\u201d He tried to shove his smelling sleeve in Xiao Yao\u2019s face and she avoided it and pushed Zhuan Xu. He actually fell backward so she was alarmed she ran over to quickly help him up \u201cI\u2019ll take you back to rest, you need to eat something and get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201dZhuan Xu acted like he didn\u2019t hear and still raised his arm to shove his stinky sleeve in her face. Xiao Yao picked up the sleeve and took a deep whiff \u201cSatisfied? Willing to go rest now?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and stopped goofing around.Xiao Yao helped him up and his guard moved to help but took a step back when Zhuan Xu shot over a look. Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu took the cloud carriage to the Xuan Yuan army base near Qing Shui Town.Xiao Yao helped Zhuan Xu inside a residence but no one was inside. Zhuan Xu explained \u201cI rushed so fast here I didn\u2019t bring servants, and I sent Xiao Xiao and them all to search for you and are exhausted so I let them go rest.\u201dZhuan Xu wasn\u2019t someone who needed a.s.sistance but with his current exhausted state Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to leave him be so she a.s.sisted him in bathing and changing. Zhuan Xu rapped her on the head \u201cDon\u2019t be unwilling, this is totally your task after what you did.\u201dXiao Yao knew she was in the wrong and lowered her head \u201cI\u2019m not unwilling, it\u2019s an honor to a.s.sist the Black Emperor.\u201dZhuan Xu huffed and flicked Xiao Yao on the head for her sa.s.s.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t want to eat after bathing but Xiao Yao insisted he drink some porridge before giving him some medicine.Xiao Yao had Zhuan Xu lay down but he wouldn\u2019t close his eyes so Xiao Yao asked \u201cYou\u2019re not tired?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t slept in days but I never felt tired. After showering and relaxing I am so tired, my eyelids are like two mountains pressing down on it.\u201d\u201cThen close your eyes!\u201dZhuan Xu was silent and then said \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me! For the first time in my life I\u2019m scared to the point of not daring to sleep. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lost You ForeverChapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI\u2019m always torn between my all-consuming love for one particular male lead in Lost You Forever, and my just one step below love for the other two male leads. Unlike other Tong Hua novels, there is genuinely no one I dislike among the suitors vying for leading lady Xiao Yao\u2019s heart \u2013 I get Zhuan Xu and all his choices (probably because he was the alluded to male lead for Xiao Yao when I first met him in Once Promised), I appreciate Jing\u2019s contrasting personality that complements Xiao Yao so nicely, and I know in my gut that there is no other choice for Xiang Liu than to keep pus.h.i.+ng Xiao Yao away.The novel is winding down but not slowing down, as this chapter ramps up the action yet again, in an even more pressing way than Xiao Yao\u2019s brush with death in the ocean in the last chapter. This time her heart-connected boo Xiang Liu isn\u2019t around to rescue her (booooooo), but another person will step in when Xiang Liu/Bei can\u2019t. Jing is still dead for all we know, while Zhuan Xu\u2019s secret love is getting closer to being blown open and the results will be good for no one. If Xiao Yao loved him like that then so be it, but she doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s all because of what he did way back when to conceal his heart. Now he just has to lay in his own bed and boy does it suck to be him.Ch 44 \u2013 A Familiar Person\u2019s Heart Changes EasilyAll the wedding decorations in Xiao Yao\u2019s residence were taken down as if nothing had happened. No one mentioned Jing, and no one mentioned Xiao Yao\u2019s disappearance. Xiao Yao\u2019s life returned to the way it was before, from the Yellow Emperor to Zhuan Xu, nothing changed. But Xiao Yao knew it was all different \u2013 now when she looked skyward, there would never be a white crane carrying Jing flying towards her.The guards increased on Xiao Yue Peak, and clearly Zhuan Xu said something to Left Ear and Miao Pu because Left Ear followed her wherever she went. He was as un.o.btrusive as if he wasn\u2019t even there, and initially Xiao Yao thought he wasn\u2019t even around. She would call out \u201cLeft Ear\u201d, and then a head might pop up from the tree above, or a voice would answer from the bushes, or a sleeve would peek out from behind a corridor beam. Left Ear was like a beast in the wild, able to conceal himself into the surroundings.Xiao Yao asked about the Tu Shan clan situation and Zhuan Xu said \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess. Tu Shan Zhen is the successor in name but the clan elders know he isn\u2019t Jing\u2019s real son so they are complicating things with their plotting. The Tu Shan clan is a prime piece of flesh that everyone wants a bite out of, and the world would be thrilled to see internal strife in the clan so are fanning the discord.\u201dZhuan Xu never mentioned Jing actively but if Xiao Yao asked then he discussed it directly. He was like a doctor treating a patient, he didn\u2019t hide the injury but also didn\u2019t actively exacerbate it. He knew Xiao Yao was very sensitive to any mention of Jing\u2019s death but he chose not to shy away from the subject now.Xiao Yao asked \u201cCan you get involved with the Tu Shan clan situation?\u201d\u201cOf course I can\u2019t openly, but neither can the other players. So everyone is getting involved behind the scenes.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cAs long as I am alive, I don\u2019t want the Tu Shan clan to fall.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cTu Shan Zhen is not Jing\u2019s son but he is the bloodline of the Tu Shan clan. I think the Tu Shan Grand Madam would not have objected to him being the clan leader.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cHis parents killed Jing, don\u2019t you hate him?\u201dXiao Yao was silent for some time before saying \u201cIf Hou was still alive I could cut him into millions of pieces, but Tu Shan Zhen is just a child and he did nothing wrong. You and I know what it\u2019s like to grow up without parents, and his birth isn\u2019t something good to begin with so his life is already going to be hard. If he can\u2019t be the clan leader then others will likely harm him one day. He is the successor in name and blood, I don\u2019t want Jing to come back one day and have Zhen gone.\u201dZhuan Xu was startled into silence by Xiao Yao\u2019s words, but after a few moments he smiled \u201cFine, let Tu Shan Zhen be the clan leader then.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThank you.\u201dZhuan Xu rapped Xiao Yao on the forehead \u201cWhy are you being polite with me? Do you want to get beat?\u201dXiao Yao rubbed her forehead \u201cDon\u2019t think you can be mean to me now that you have power, don\u2019t think I can\u2019t get you back!\u201d\u201cBring it on!\u201d Zhuan Xu sa.s.sed right back.Xiao Yao grew solemn, these days she didn\u2019t have any energy or interest in fiddling with her poisons or concoctions.Zhuan Xu rubbed Xiao Yao\u2019s head \u201cYou\u2019re on Xiao Yue Peak 24/7, you\u2019ll get sick this way.\u201d Last time when Jing broke Xiao Yao\u2019s heart, she found things to busy herself with but this time she didn\u2019t even seem to care about that.\u201cYou have ordered so many guards to protect me, do you expect me to go shopping and have them trailing me en ma.s.se down a street? Plus there isn\u2019t any place around Sheng Nong Mountain that I haven\u2019t been to.\u201d Xiao Yao smiled wanly \u201cThis is what happens when one lives for so long, at the end one has seen everything.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cHow about this then? You can open a medical clinic in Zhi Yi Castle.\u201d\u201cYou can handle having me running around outside? I don\u2019t want the medical clinic to become famous not for my skills but for having a bunch of guards around.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe having you running around but I feel even worse seeing you like this. I\u2019ll handle how to manage the guards, you just plan on using your medical skills to help alleviate the suffering of others.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it and remembered Jing discussing with her to open a medical clinic in Qing Qiu. Xiao Yao smiled broader and said \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go to Zhi Yi to open a medical clinic.\u201d This would also help her investigate who wanted to kill her. If she stayed on Xiao Yue Peak all day long, tightly protected by guards so that no one could access her, she would also not be able to access others to figure out the attempt on her life.Xiao Yao used her own pocket money to open the medical clinic in Zhi Yi.She cross-dressed as a man for ease, and other than having Miao Pu and Left Ear around, the only other people working at the clinic were two young men Xiao Yao hired. She tested them personally and confirmed them to be ordinary men and not secret guards sent by Zhuan Xu.Medical clinics are not like other businesses, patients need to trust and know the doctor, so initially business was bad. Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t anxious, she used the time to teach the two young men to identify herbs and plants, and also teach Miao Pu and Left Ear to read.Miao Pu was with her for years so she already recognizing some characters here and there, so Xiao Yao sometimes had Miao Pu teach Left Ear how to read and write. All Xiao Yao could hear was Miao Pu\u2019s voice nagging and haranguing Left Ear. Miao Pu was fully aware of how strong and powerful Left Ear was, so when Xiao Yao asked her to take care of him, she would roll her eyes and snark \u201cWho would dare be mean to him?\u201d without acknowledging that she was being mean to him.Because Xiao Yao\u2019s medical skills truly were exceptional, when patients did come they left in awe of the skills of this smiling young man doctor. She charged a not cheap fee, but her prescribed treatment used common plants and made it affordable. Gradually word spread and Xiao Yao\u2019s clinic got busier with more patients from nearby.Xiao Yao said to Miao Pu and Left Ear \u201cI can finally afford to take care of you two by myself.\u201dMiao Pu couldn\u2019t understand why Xiao Yao insisted on earning money herself, but Left Ear smiled in rea.s.surance that he wouldn\u2019t need to be hungry again. In his eyes, only the money Xiao Yao earned was reliable, nothing from anyone else could be relied upon.Aside from worrying about being fed, Left Ear was even more worried about Xiao Yao\u2019s safety. In his eyes, the guards sent by Zhuan Xu were not his so were not reliable. Left Ear asked Xiao Yao \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know who tried to kill you?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cAlready investigating it!\u201dLeft Ear stared in confusion so Xiao Yao laughed. It wasn\u2019t clear if it was because Left Ear hung around Miao Pu all day long, but Left Ear added more expressions these days which made him seem more and more human.Xiao Yao said \u201cThe person trying to kill me either is doing it for gain or because of hatred. If it\u2019s because of hatred, then if the person you hated didn\u2019t die and is instead parading around all happy and healthy, how would you feel?\u201dLeft Ear said \u201cI will kill!\u201dXiao Yao patted Left Ear on the shoulder, sighing with the hope that one day Left Ear will stop it with this one answer to all questions.Miao Pu scoffed \u201cThe person trying to kill Miss, seeing you come back fine will likely cause that person to sleep poorly and pay more attention to Miss. The happier Miss is, the worse that person will feel. Likely that person will try to kill Miss again, and if that person strikes then we find out who.\u201d Miao Pu raised her chin and glared at Left Ear \u201cThis is what His Majesty means by seemingly doing nothing but actually doing everything. An uncouth brute like you would never understand.\u201dLeft Ear said nothing as usual but Xiao Yao could see through to his feelings. Miao Pu saw how powerful he was yet she still sa.s.sed him around, which meant she wasn\u2019t afraid of him or saw him as a monster. Xiao Yao coughed slightly and said in a low voice \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell His Majesty about this matter yet.\u201dMiao Pu was silent and then nodded \u201cI understand.\u201d After the discussion last time, she knew that between her old master and current master her loyalty could only reside with one.Xiao Yao clapped and said with a smile \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to work now. Let\u2019s see how long that person can sit tight.\u201dOne afternoon Xiao Yao was seeing a patient when Feng Long walked in. Xiao Yao smiled at him and continued seeing her patient. Miao Pu walked up to greet him while Left Ear seemed to do nothing but his entire body was coiled in readiness for any sudden attack.After Feng Long drank his tea, Xiao Yao finished with the patient and walked over while the patient left grumbling about the high price of the consultation. Xiao Yao just smiled and didn\u2019t try to explain but also didn\u2019t lower the fee.Feng Long said \u201cIf the patients knew the doctor they were seeing helped compile Yellow Emperor Internal Medicine Guide and the Yellow Emperor External Medicine Guide, they wouldn\u2019t complain about the high fees.\u201d Since the two manuals were released to the world, the doctors of the world praised it to the heavens and even the ordinary people who didn\u2019t understand what was written in it knew that it saved lives and was invaluable. Doctors who were rumored to have worked on it could charge sky high prices for medical visits, and often couldn\u2019t even be summoned for a consultation.Xiao Yao explained \u201cHis illness is a common one and any doctor could have seen him. My fee was high so his complaint was valid, so next time he doesn\u2019t need to come see me!\u201dFeng Long wondered \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing charity, why open the clinic under a false ident.i.ty? But if you\u2019re doing charity, why charge such high a consultation fee?\u201dXiao Yao explained \u201cMy medical skills are so good that if the fee is low and everyone comes to see me, I can\u2019t handle that volume. But I don\u2019t need to use my medical skills to earn money to feed my family, but other doctors do, so I can\u2019t do charity at the expense of ruining their livelihood. This way some who can afford it can still see me, and others go to the other doctors, and everyone gets a way to live.\u201dFeng Long chuckled, Xiao Yao really had a way of thinking that was always different than other people. He could never understand her thought process. Perhaps the only one who understood her was Jing, but\u2026\u2026Feng Long\u2019s smile turned down \u201cThe Tu Shan elders have agreed to let Tu Shan Zhen become clan leader, and will a.s.sist and support him until he comes of age. The elders handle the Tu Shan clan affairs together, and with His Majesty\u2019s support, the Tu Shan clan can manage until Zhen grows up.\u201dZhuan Xu had already told this to her so Xiao Yao didn\u2019t believe Feng Long came all this way just to tell her this. She silently stared at him.Feng Long said \u201cToday I got together with old friends from the Tan and Jiang families. In the past they did whatever I wanted, but now they are even more accommodating. I felt bored so slipped away early. I was just wandering and didn\u2019t intend to come inside, and am not even sure why I ended up walking in. What happened to Jing\u2026..I\u2019m very sad about it.\u201dXiao Yao looked downward.Feng Long continued \u201cWhen I was small, I looked forward to growing up, being free to do many things. But now I keep thinking of the childhood days. Back then, Jing and Hou were so close I was super jealous. Hou was very active like me yet we didn\u2019t really play together. Every time my teacher would scold me, I would run to Jing\u2019s room to complain and talk about my grand dreams for the future. And Li Jie Chang, that dog headed b.a.s.t.a.r.d, he loved to oppose me yet also played with us. So if Jing wasn\u2019t around, we would end up fighting. Us boys fought and played and somehow all grew up. Now when Chang talks to me, he\u2019s got a polite smile and is very well mannered, like I\u2019m his customer. Hou\u2019s dead and Jing isn\u2019t here anymore either. In the blink of an eye, I discovered that I don\u2019t have any friends to play with genuinely anymore.\u201d Feng Long smiled bitterly \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am telling you all this, likely I used to go find Jing when I was frustrated to vent so today I\u2019m venting to you. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201dXiao Yao said warmly \u201cJust lending an ear, I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201dFeng Long stood up \u201cI\u2019m off now. You\u2026\u2026don\u2019t be too sad. You have a long life ahead, Jing will want you to be well.\u201d Feng Long suddenly felt rather absurd, Xiao Yao was going to be his bride and after she ran away at the wedding, he thought he would never forgive her. He once cursed her a lifetime of loneliness and pain. Who knew today seeing her like this, he actually felt bad himself.Xiao Yao walked Feng Long to the door and casually asked \u201cHow did you know I opened a medical clinic here?\u201d\u201cThe Empress mentioned it.\u201d Actually, Xing Yue didn\u2019t just mention it, she said a lot of words in disgust, which didn\u2019t make any sense to Feng Long. Since Xiao Yao ran off at the wedding, Xing Yue hated her guts. She called her witch and s.l.u.t all the time, so much so Feng Long got used to hearing it. Every time Xing Yue heard about Xiao Yao, she would launch into a diatribe, and one time even said Xiao Yao was a wh.o.r.e like her mother, and cursing Xiao Yao to die like her mom. Feng Long finally had enough and chastised her but Xing Yue just huffed off. Feng Long couldn\u2019t do anything since she was the Empress now.Xiao Yao walked back inside and silently sat there thinking. Was it really Xing Yue? But why? Feng Long said he didn\u2019t understand how it came to this, old friends dead or scattered, even when meeting it was just superficial talk. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know how it came to this either, years ago she shared a pallet with Xing Yue, covering for their own brothers, worried for Zhuan Xu together\u2026\u2026..so why did she want Xiao Yao dead so badly now?Left Ear said \u201cMiao Pu said he is Chi Sui Feng Long. Is it him?\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cIf he isn\u2019t the best actor around\u2026.the it\u2019s likely not him.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s Sheng Nong Xing Yue? I\u2019ll go kill her now.\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Xiao Yao grabbed Left Ear and said harshly \u201cWithout my order, you don\u2019t do anything. Got it? Otherwise I won\u2019t let you be my bodyguard anymore!\u201dLeft Ear\u2019s impa.s.sive face flashed across a pout but he said \u201cI understand.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t know why she would suddenly thought of Xiang Liu pouting, which made her want to laugh and want to comfort him, so her voice turned warm \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this, you just need to stop thinking about killing people. A bodyguard is different than being a killer.\u201dLeft Ear grumbled \u201cKill her, protecting you.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s head hurt so she handed it over \u201cMiao Pu, you explain to him the difference between being a bodyguard and a killer.\u201dMiao Pu giggled and ran over to Left Ear and started her haranguing.Before Zhuan Xu married Xing Yue, Xiao Yao had already left Zhi Jin Summit, and since then she hadn\u2019t visited once.When Xiao Yao arrived at Zhi Jin Palace, no one recognized her, so she flashed the Yellow Emperor\u2019s badge and shocked everyone while Miao Pu said \u201cThis is Ms. Xi Ling from Xiao Yue Peak\u2019s Zhang Yi Palace.\u201dPeople had heard of this Ms. Xi Ling with unique birth background and colorful life, but even more had heard of how much the Yellow Emperor and the Black Emperor cherished her, so seeing the Yellow Emperor\u2019s badge today confirmed the rumors. They opened the door quickly to welcome Xiao Yao inside.When Xiao Yao left, Zhi Jin Palace was a bit desolate but that mood was completely gone now. Every inch was bright and s.h.i.+ny, every blade of gra.s.s well-tended, countless people coming to and fro. But the activity was orderly and silent, giving off a sense of silent pressure. People\u2019s movements were tightly controlled, as if being afraid of one tiny misstep and upsetting those in charge.Xiao Yao smiled softly, so this was the everything that Xing Yue wanted.Today was March 3rd, a Middle Plains holiday where people went to bath in the rivers and pray to the heavens, and later that night walk through the spring foliage to admire the blooms. This holiday was as important to the people of the Middle Plains as the lantern festival on May 5th was to the people of Gao Xing.Zhuan Xu treated all tribes the same, keeping all the major holiday traditions of Xuan Yuan, Middle Plains, and now Gao Xing. Every holiday Zhuan Xy would celebrate according to the tradition of that place, while letting the ordinary folks decide whether and how to celebrate it themselves.The consorts in Zhi Jin Palace came from all over the vast wilderness so every holiday would be celebrated, but because the Empress was from the Middle Plains, this holiday was even more festive. For the evening\u2019s celebrations, Zhuan Xu would be attending as earlier in the day he already went to see the Yellow Emperor and Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao followed the servants lead into Hundred Flower Garden.Inside the garden, there were creeks and trees everywhere, and hundreds of flowers blooming. Small winding pathways, little bridges, and multiple pavilions dotted the landscape. Consorts were sitting here and there, and a dragon phoenix raised dais was placed in the center where Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue sat together. Zhuan Xu was half reclining while Xing Yue sat very demurely upright, listening to the musicians play a lively tune.When the song was done, everyone clapped but one consort Xiao Yao didn\u2019t recognize said \u201cThe tune was good but cannot compare to Her Highness.\u201dConsort Jiang smiled and added \u201cRumor has it that His Majesty and Her Highness met on the Chi Sui Lake during a thick fog, and His Majesty heard Her Highness playing her zither so he joined her on his flute. They hadn\u2019t even met yet and already played so in sync with each other. Back then they were strangers but now as husband and wife, playing together would be even more destined.\u201dSome other consorts added their voice to the request, while other consorts said nothing and looked rather annoyed. Xiao Yao had Miao Pu stop the servants from announcing her presence and stood under a tree to observe.Xing Yue\u2019s expression was a bit upset, a bit excited, and a bit blus.h.i.+ng, clearly she wanted to play the zither with Zhuan Xu. He said nothing so the chatter gradually grew silent.Xing Yue looked around and said to Zhuan Xu \u201cHis Majesty, tell them to stop teasing and asking me to be a musician today!\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cToday is a holiday so if they want you to be a musician for a day there is no harm in that. I\u2019ll keep you company, who dare tease you.\u201dThe myriad expression changes on the consorts faces was a sight to behold, while Xing Yue\u2019s face lit up as a zither was placed before her and a flute handed to Zhuan Xu.Xing Yue readied herself while Zhuan Xu walked over to the side of the creek with the flute. Xing Yue started playing first, and it was the tune she played that day with Zhuan Xu. He joined on the flute and there was dead silence all around so the music was even more audible. One was strong and forceful, the other tender and docile, one was bold and daring, the other careful and conservative, one was soaring and casual, the other followed the lead.Xiao Yao remembered the sound of the same zither on the lake, so haughty and challenging back then, daring to compete with the flute, to grow anxious, to get so angry as to snap a string. Xing Yue gave that kind of playing up and chose this type of playing now. Xiao Yao unconsciously sighed, and it wasn\u2019t a loud sigh but because it was complete silence all around as the Black Emperor and his Empress were playing a duet, Xiao Yao\u2019s sigh was heard by all and came across as especially rude and insolent under the circ.u.mstances. Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue both furrowed their brows and looked over at the tree.Xiao Yao knew she had been rude and sighed inwardly that she really wasn\u2019t suited to behave at important events. She stepped forward and bowed to Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue, and despite the gesture being so subservient, when Xiao Yao lifted her head she made a silly face that only Zhuan Xu and Xing Yue could see that clearly showed Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t being subservient in the least.Xing Yue\u2019s hand jerked so hard that she snapped a string on the zither, while Zhuan Xu was so shocked to see Xiao Yao that he stopped playing at the same moment so it appeared their tune stopped in sync and didn\u2019t seem odd.Zhuan Xu composed himself and asked \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dXiao Yao lowered her head respectfully and said \u201cGrandfather\u2019s cherries are ripe earlier than expected, knowing Your Majesty is here celebrating the holiday, he asked me to bring it over.\u201dMiao Pu stepped forward and presented a basket of cherries. The servants received it and Zhuan Xu said \u201cIf it\u2019s Grandfather\u2019s gift then everyone have some!\u201dThe servants quickly pa.s.sed out the cherries to each consort present.The Yellow Emperor lived on Xiao Yue Peak and never came to Zhi Jin Summit. He also never summoned any granddaughter-in-law to go see him. Other than the Empress very rarely paying her respects, none of the wives had ever interacted with him. The consorts were so shocked and pleased at this unexpected gesture and happily ate the cherries. They thanked the Yellow Emperor, thanked Xiao Yao for bringing it over, and generally make a big to do all just to make Zhuan Xu notice, and in that moment the entire garden was lit up with beautiful women all atwitter.Xiao Yao smiled as she looked around and Zhuan Xu plastered a smile on his face but didn\u2019t seem comfortable, like he was doing something he shouldn\u2019t have been and was caught by Xiao Yao. He looked over at the servant \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, the consorts should be retiring.\u201dThe consorts weren\u2019t surprised, the Black Emperor seemed very easygoing but was actually quite aloof and uninterested in celebrations. Every event, he would either come early and leave early, or come late and make the event end right after, he never had the interest to partake of an entire celebration.As the consorts were leaving, Zhuan Xu handed his flute to Xing Yue with a smile \u201cWill the Empress please hold onto this.\u201d All the consorts glanced at Xing Yue before looking away and hiding their own disappointment and envy.Xing Yue smiled and took the flute with both hands, but felt a boiling rage in her heart that she could barely contain. She wanted to scream loudly \u201cAre you guys all blind? Can\u2019t see it? He doesn\u2019t even care about me! He\u2019s just using me so no one notices that he ended the celebration the second Xiao Yao arrived. He\u2019s doing this so later on when people remember today, they will only remember the zither-flute duet and afterwards him giving me the flute. You guys are all blind as bats! He\u2019s protecting the person he\u2019s hidden away all this time! If you guys want to be jealous, to hate, it should be towards her!\u201d But Xing Yue couldn\u2019t say any of this so she just bowed low and took her leave beautifully.Xing Yue knew she shouldn\u2019t keep looking but she couldn\u2019t control herself. She purposely slowed down behind everyone and then made up an excuse to circle back to look for a dropped satchel. As she got close to the edge of the creek, she didn\u2019t dare get any closer so she couldn\u2019t hear what Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao were saying. All she could see was the two walking side-by-side along the creek edge.Xing Yue thought back in her memory, since she married Zhuan Xu, she had never walked alongside him. She always walked one step behind, without figuring out whether it was his authority or her own consideration, until it became that way always. If the Empress didn\u2019t dare walk alongside the Emperor, the other consorts would also never dare. With no woman on Zhi Jin Summit who dared walk alongside Zhuan Xu, it made Xing Yue feel like her one step behind wasn\u2019t a problem. But tonight she suddenly realized that there was a woman who dared to walk alongside Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu walked slowly and calmly, while Xiao Yao flitted from the gra.s.s to hopping on the stones next to the creek. Whether Xiao Yao was fast or slow, Zhuan Xu always kept pace right next to her. Xiao Yao stepped on a moss covered stone and her foot slipped and was about to fall into the creek. Zhuan Xu reached out to grab her so only one foot landed in the water. Her shoe and hem got wet so Zhuan Xu bent down to pick up her wet hem to dry it for her.Xiao Yao bent over with her hand on Zhuan Xu\u2019s shoulder so she could take off the wet shoe. As Zhuan Xu stood back up, he took the wet shoe from Xiao Yao to carry for her. Xiao Yao pointed to the creek and said something but Zhuan Xu shook his head no. His winged ride arrived and Zhuan Xu vaulted on with Xiao Yao before flying off towards Xiao Yue Peak.Xing Yue wanted to leave but she had no strength left in her. She took two steps forward before her knees buckled and she collapsed on the ground. Xing Yue felt this moment was just like when she was a little girl and realized she wasn\u2019t some high born lady but in truth just as hostage to keep her father in line. She could be killed at any moment and have everything taken away, so she was so scared and fearful that everything she had would be gone in the blink of an eye.She once thought that Zhuan Xu was a fickle playboy, and wondered if she was up to enduring him trading the old for the new on a regular basis. But once she married him, she discovered that Zhuan Xu was actually very distant to all women, his focus and attention solely on governing. He wasn\u2019t loving towards her, but he also wasn\u2019t loving towards any other women. As long as she didn\u2019t cross him then he also gave her due preference over the other consorts in public, letting her wield her Empress authority. She thought Zhuan Xu was this aloof so she accepted it without worry. But once she started to have doubts, then she grew more and more frightened every day, scared that Zhuan Xu wasn\u2019t aloof or uninterested in women, he simply had given his entire all to one woman already.Zhuan Xu kept Xiao Yao so well protected that Xing Yue observed for tens of years and still never saw a single slip up. He went to Xiao Yue Peak every single day, rain or s.h.i.+ne, he let Xiao Yao hit him and didn\u2019t get angry, and instead look very sad and longing when he touched the injury, he was willing to carry Xiao Yao\u2019s wet hem and shoe\u2026\u2026All the women on Zhi Jin Summit competed and vied with each other, but they never realized that the one woman Zhuan Xu spent the most time with wasn\u2019t even on Zhi Jin Summit but was instead Xiao Yao. Even as the Empress, Xing Yue at most saw Zhuan Xu once a month, but Xiao Yao saw him every single day.Years ago when she married Zhuan Xu, Xing Yue thought she was unparallel, and the confidence came not from herself but having Sheng Nong and Chi Sui behind her. But then came Ah Nian, and she had as much as Xing Yue and even more as Ah Nian brought as her dowry an entire kingdom when she married Zhuan Xu. Everyone told her to accept it then, even her Gege went to Five G.o.ds Mountain to request the marriage alliance. She had no choice but to accept since she had no ability to fight it.Xing Yue was furious with Ah Nian but wasn\u2019t scared of her. Ah Nian lived on Five G.o.ds Mountain and just had the Empress name without any real power. Sometimes Xing Yue would even scoff that Ah Nian wouldn\u2019t even be able to hack it as the Empress with real power. The White Emperor knew his daughter\u2019s limitations so arranged it that way. But now Xing Yue was growing more and more scared, as the vast wilderness united as one, the importance of the Sheng Nong tribe was decreasing to Zhuan Xu. If Zhuan Xu would let Xiao Yao hit him, could carry her s.h.i.+rt and shoe, then whatever Xiao Yao wanted Zhuan Xu would give it to her. Down the road, forget Zhuan Xu spending time with Xing Yue, even her position as Empress might be in peril!Xing Yue bitterly laughed \u2013 it didn\u2019t even need to wait for Xiao Yao to want something. Just like tonight, Xiao Yao appeared and Zhuan Xu sent all the wives away so he can give Xiao Yao his undivided attention. Xing Yue knew that it was a frightening idea, to kill Xiao Yao, and if Zhuan Xu found out the consequences would be unimaginable. But if she didn\u2019t get rid of Xiao Yao, wouldn\u2019t her future be just as unimaginable? At that time, it would be even more unbearable!After the holiday pa.s.sed, Xiao Yao waited for Xing Yue to make a move but nothing happened. Xiao Yao was confused, was it not Xing Yue after all? That time she went to Zhi Jin Summit, Zhuan Xu chewed her out for it, so did she get yelled at for no reason?At the end of April, Zhuan Xu went to Five G.o.ds Mountain and ordered Xiao Yao not to go to the medical clinic and to stay put. If she was bored then to wander around Sheng Nong Mountain.Xiao Yao promised him that she would be careful and would not leave Sheng Nong Mountain before Zhuan Xu felt a.s.sured enough to depart.Xiao Yao got an invitation from the Li Jie Consort, the older sister of Li Jie Chang. She was inviting Xiao Yao in early May to attend the lantern release in Sheng Nong Mountain. The invitation include instructions for making beautiful flower lanterns with the opening on bottom, unlike the Gao Xing lanterns where the opening was on top. She wrote that the event would be great fun and invited Xiao Yao to attend.The Li Jie Consort was neutral on Zhi Jin Summit, she neither supported nor opposed the Empress, so she wouldn\u2019t be doing anything for Xing Yue. And the close friends.h.i.+p between Li Jie Chang and Jing made Xiao Yao warmer towards the Li Jie Consort, but even then there were no close ties so Xiao Yao didn\u2019t understand why she suddenly got invited.Xiao Yao thought about it and decided to go, it was years since she went to a lantern festival.Xiao Yao and Left Ear set off around dusk. Left Ear hadn\u2019t learned how to ride a winged horse yet so Miao Pu loudly mocked him for it. But then she went on to earnestly show him how to ride it.Xiao Yao sat in the cloud carriage and looked at the two sitting up front. Left Ear pulled on the reins but used too much force so the winged horses neighed in discomfort. Miao Pu laughed on one hand while moving over to grab Left Ear\u2019s hand to show him how to control the reins. As the winged horses stabilized, Miao Pu\u2019s body was half sitting in Left Ear\u2019s arms.Xiao Yao watched them from behind, noticing Left Ear\u2019s body posture tensing up as his ears turned bright red. Who knew the cold brutal killer would turn shy and nervous like this? Xiao Yao\u2019s heart turned melancholy, her Jing was once this awkward and shy. Xiao Yao used to be so frustrated with him, thinking he didn\u2019t like her enough, didn\u2019t care enough, and even thought about ending the relations.h.i.+p. But looking back now, she understood it was a type of cheris.h.i.+ng, of caring too much as to be hesitant. That was so precious, because it was the first and the truest heart.In Left Ear\u2019s nervous and awkward flying, the cloud carriage arrived at the meeting place.It really was an exquisite view, with a large rock that seemed to have been dropped off the air into the top of the mountain, perched precariously as if on the verge of toppling over, yet securely remaining in place. A bunch of people were gathered on the rock, chatting amiably as the party was underway.Xiao Yao\u2019s cloud carriage landed in one corner as another cloud carriage landed in the other. Xiao Yao and Xing Yue got out one after the other and the Li Jie Consort hurried over to greet both, with the three exchanging pleasantries.Xing Yue looked around and said with a smile \u201cThis place is so unique, how did you find it?\u201dLi Jie Consort laughed \u201cSheng Nong Mountain is thousands of miles, even living here there are places one will never see even in a lifetime. In my free time I like to wander around the mountain since I have so much free time so found this place by chance. It\u2019s too bad Your Highness is so busy, otherwise there are many more interesting odd places to explore.\u201dLi Jie Consort\u2019s words seemed candid but a sliver of sadness was hidden within. Xing Yue didn\u2019t continue that conversation and instead asked \u201cYour invite said releasing lanterns, I prepared many lanterns but there is no water here so how to release the lanterns?\u201dThe Gao Xing people lived by water so their lantern festival was releasing lit lantern the water surface. If it floated longer before sinking it meant wishes would have a greater chance of coming true. Legend had it that wishes on marriage were the most likely to come true, so when Xing Yue and the Li Jie Consort were still unmarried, they went to Gao Xing with their girlfriends to release lanterns before.Li Jie Consort laughed \u201cSheng Nong isn\u2019t like Gao Xing, if we release lanterns in water it\u2019ll disappear from view shortly, what fun is there in that? I thought up an unique idea to release lanterns here.\u201d\u201cWhat unique idea?\u201dLi Jie Consort nodded to her maid before pointing to the sky \u201cLook!\u201dThey were standing on the surface of a rock perched on the top of a mountain, with white clouds swirling around them. As the winds s.h.i.+fted the sea of clouds changed shapes. A maid rode her winged ride into the clouds and lit up a lantern before releasing it into the clouds. The lantern moved with the clouds as if it was on the surface of water, yet different as some lanterns were higher and others lower rather than all on the same level when released on water. The lights flickered all around them making the view even more mesmerizing.Xing Yue nodded her head \u201cVery unique indeed!\u201dLi Jie Consort smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Xiao Yao exclaimed \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic!\u201dLi Jie Consort said \u201cWhen more lanterns are released it\u2019ll be even more beautiful.\u201d She gestured \u201cWill Your Highness please go first.\u201dThe maids had the swallow rides ready to the side and Xing Yue said \u201cThen I shall.\u201d Xing Yue\u2019s maid brought out the prepared lanterns and Xing Yue took one in hand before getting on the swallow and flying into the air. She closed her eyes to make a wish before releasing the lantern.Everyone watched the Empress release her lantern and followed suit on swallows to release their lanterns. Some were lazy and just tossed lanterns into the sea of cloud, with some landing well and floating off but others flipping over and the light extinguis.h.i.+ng. Those with low powers decided not to be lazy and got on the swallows to release it properly into the clouds.Everyone had different design lanterns, in various colors and shapes, and as more and more lanterns were released into the clouds the view grew more resplendent with a rainbow of glowing lights\u2026..as if various colored gems were tossed into the clouds to glitter brightly.Li Jie Consort asked Xiao Yao \u201cPretty?\u201dXiao Yao stared at the lanterns around her \u201cVery pretty!\u201dLi Jie Consort said \u201cChang wanted me to tell you that no matter if Jing was alive or dead, he had the same wish for you to be happy. Even if he wasn\u2019t the one to make that wish come true, he would still only want you to be happy.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes grew misty, so this is why Li Jie Consort invited her today, to pa.s.s word from Chang.Li Jie Consort stared at the floating lanterns with sadness in her eyes \u201cThe dead is gone and the living must go on. Being sad and raging to the heavens won\u2019t bring the dead back, best move on to let your heart heal.\u201dXiao Yao said nothing so Li Jie Consort smiled \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for me because I\u2019m just saying this. Your pain I have experienced before, I know what it feels like to hurt so much I would rather not live. But I know my every smile would make him happy, so I try hard to smile every day.\u201dXiao Yao turned in shock to stare at the always jovial Li Jie Consort \u201cXiao Yao, learn to hide your beloved deep inside your heart, even if you accept another in the future, remember that Jing loved the most to see you be happy and not crying. Allow yourself to be happy again, it\u2019s not forgetting or betraying him. The dead won\u2019t be upset and will instead be comforted.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI know.\u201dLi Jie Consort sighed \u201cGo make a wish and release a lantern!\u201dLi Jie Consort\u2019s maid said to Xiao Yao \u201cThis swallow is very docile, if Miss holds the rein tightly nothing will happen.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Xiao Yao got on the swallow while Miao Pu rode another swallow and followed alongside.Xiao Yao wrapped the reins tightly around her wrist and tossed a lantern into the sea of clouds. A gust of wind carried into the distance. She released three more in succession and the oil used for the light was from the magnolia tree so the air filled with that scent. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t make a wish, since she was small every wish was dashed in the most cruel way possible so she no longer made wishes. Xiao Yao felt the heavens heard her wish and would purposely destroy that very wish. After some time watching the lanterns float away, Xiao Yao thought to herself \u201cJing, I\u2019ve planted magnolia trees on Xiao Yue Peak, when the flowers bloom I will sing for you.\u201dThe swallow Xiao Yao was riding suddenly screamed in pain and violently flying out of control. Xiao Yao was taken off guard and almost fell off but managed to grab the reins tight and stay on.Miao Pu yelled \u201cMiss, Miss!\u201d She tried to catch up but the crazed swallow was flying too fast and Miao Pu couldn\u2019t catch it.The swallow cried out while flying all over the place, up and side and sideways, even turning in the air. Xiao Yao was sent flying but she held onto the reins and was flung around like a leaf in the wind.Screams rendered the air as people yelled \u201cHelp, help!\u201dLi Jie Consort yelled \u201cXiao Yao, hold on tight, no matter what don\u2019t let go!\u201d She climbed on her winged ride not waiting for help and flew towards Xiao Yao. But the crazed swallow was in the throes of survival and all its power focused on this final flight so Li Jie Consort could not catch up.Xiao Yao looked at the swallow and saw blood coming from its mouth. The swallow likely didn\u2019t go crazy but was suffering from deadly poison. So the person who wanted to kill her struck again!This might really be the end for Xiao Yao. Li Jie Consort picked a location far from anywhere close to help arriving, and even if they arrived Xiao Yao likely would have fallen from the sky already. She could survive in water but couldn\u2019t survive a fall from the air.Xiao Yao flashed an image of Jing telling her not to give up and don\u2019t die! Xiao Yao bit her tongue and the pain allowed her to focus and eased the nausea from being tossed around.Xiao Yao took in the surroundings and saw the swallow flew to an area with sharp cliffs on both sides. An area of green suddenly appeared so Xiao Yao used all her might to climb up the reins towards the back of the swallow. The reins were soft leather but under the pressure it cut into Xiao Yao\u2019s palm, with each pull it cut deeper and the blood and pain flowed.The swallow turned a few more times in agony and Xiao Yao was turned with it, so she bit her lips to maintain her consciousness. She gradually climbed the reins and quickly released both hands to grab the neck of the swallow.The swallow was nearly its end and could fall from the sky at any time.Xiao Yao saw the green forest below and decided to land there. She was like a beast as she bit down hard on the right side of the swallow\u2019s neck and caused it to turn left towards the green forest below.The swallow appeared to know it was going to die and cawed pitifully. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t even hesitate as she wrapped her arms tightly around the swallow\u2019s neck and snapped it with a crack. Xiao Yao tightly held onto the swallow\u2019s neck with her arms as her legs wrapped around its body. She curled in tightly as the swallow fell like a shooting star from the sky towards the ground below. As the green got closer and closer, Xiao Yao turned the swallow around so it was below as she was above, and then curled her body tightly against the swallow\u2019s soft stomach.Bang! Bang! Bang! The thunderous impact noises rose around her.Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes saw black and her entire body was aching. She didn\u2019t know how many bones she broke or whether she could withstand all the impact, she just curled her body tightly against the swallow to lessen as much impact as possible.Xiao Yao was in so much pain she pa.s.sed out.Some time later, Xiao Yao woke up to the stench of overwhelming blood. She struggled to climb out of the flesh and guts around her, noticing that she was covered in blood from head to toe, unclear whether it was her blood or the swallow\u2019s blood or a mix of blood.Regardless of whether that person was Xing Yue, to dare attempt to kill her in Sheng Nong Mountain meant there was a backup plan. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare stay put and she picked up a branch to use as a crutch and tried to walk. Thank goodness she lived alone in the mountains for tens of years, she still had the instinct of the wilderness survival so she headed in the direction of water.Xiao Yao always carried medicine with her but it all scattered during the swallow\u2019s wild flight. She could only look for herbs along the way, and luckily she found a few as she got closer to the water. When she reached the water source, Xiao Yao weakly sat down and took a deep breath. She walked into the water to wash the blood off and inspect her body.She heard the birds behind her startle into the air so she reached out her arm and a silver bow appeared.When she fell from the sky, clearly Xiang Liu must have felt the pain, and right now he was probably annoyed at himself for getting tied up to her because of the bug. Xiao Yao smiled and stroked the bow \u201cIt\u2019s all up to you now!\u201dAs she pulled the bow back, Xiao Yao\u2019s arms shook in pain but once the bow was c.o.c.ked, all her training kicked into place and her stance was steady and firm. She released and a silver arrow flew forward with a whoosh.A scream split the air and someone said \u201cNo worries, it wasn\u2019t a critical hit.\u201dAll her arrows were tipped with poison but Xiao Yao was more worried that she already used her one out of three chances.Six masked men walked out of the forest. They saw Xiao Yao sitting there unable to even walk and relaxed their stance. They clearly were told Xiao Yao had weak powers so laughed when they saw her pulling back her bow.A silver arrow was released going from low to high, it grazed the thigh of one before lodging in the arm of another. Another arrow flew forth, the trajectory weird as well, whizzing by the ear of two and leaving a thin blood trail before embedding in the eye of a third.Two arrows and five people! Xiao Yao did the best she could!The bow disappeared into her arm and Xiao Yao weakly smiled and her heart said a soft \u201cThank you!\u201dA voice from the forest yelled in alarm \u201cIt\u2019s poisonous! Be careful!\u201dA masked man ran out from the forest \u201cThe arrow has deadly poison, number 7 is dead!\u201dAnd with that, one, two, three\u2026..all five fell one by one, leaving only the one who didn\u2019t get shot and the one who came out of the forest.The two masked men stared in shock at Xiao Yao, they had strong powers and training, and before this mission they were told Xiao Yao had low powers. They expected danger but not from her.Xiao Yao finished shooting three arrows and her body was spent. Her entire body was shaking as she stared at the two men and picked up the branch to use as a weapon. The two men didn\u2019t dare underestimate Xiao Yao anymore and summoned their power as they advanced on her. Xiao Yao knew she must look amusing to them, using a branch as a weapon, but if she was going to die then she wanted to take as many with her as she could.The two men unsheathed their swords and came at Xiao Yao from two sides, treating her like she was a real foe. Their attacked shattered the branch in her hand and right as she was about to be pierced, a shadow dashed between her and the attackers like lightning. He didn\u2019t have a weapon but used his bare hands against the attackers yet showed no fear.One masked man stabbed at him but he didn\u2019t even dodge and instead softened his arm until twisting it around to grab the masked man\u2019s arm and then wrenched it clean off, with bone snapping and blood spurting everywhere.When the shadow first arrived the movement was too fast so Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t see clearly who it was but seeing such a brutal attack she said \u201cLeft Ear!\u201d Xiao Yao let out a sigh of relief and collapsed on the ground, unable to move anymore.The two masked men were not any less weak than Left Ear but his attacks were so direct and lethal they had never encountered it before. Left Ear even licked the blood that splashed on his face and made the men even more terrified. Left Ear didn\u2019t even blink, this was like being in the slave arena death match, his entire focus was solely on killing the men before him using whatever means possible so he could survive.After a short battle, two more corpses laid on the ground.Left Ear walked over to Xiao Yao and kneeled down. Xiao Yao said \u201cMy one leg is broken, and cracked a few ribs. You?\u201d\u201cMy arm is injured.\u201dXiao Yao tossed herbs to Left Ear that could staunch the blood flow and mask the stench of blood. She applied the herb to herself and said to Left Ear \u201cLet\u2019s find a place to hide.\u201dLeft Ear carried Xiao Yao on his back and headed upstream \u201cYour archery skills are very high, even I might not have been able to avoid your arrows.\u201dXiao Yao smiled before sighing wistfully \u201cI had a very good master.\u201dPerhaps it was the emotions that came through in Xiao Yao\u2019s tone of voice and Left Ear was especially sensitive to it \u201cWas it Bei?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLeft Ear exclaimed \u201cI will help him now to protect you!\u201dLeft Ear was like Xiang Liu \u2013 crystal clear in those who help and harm him. In Left Ear\u2019s mind, Bei helped him so he wanted to repay the debt, but Bei was dead so now he wanted to repay his debt to Bei by taking care of Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao laughed softly \u201cYou two really are the same species! But him and I\u2026\u2026..we\u2019re not as close as you think we are.\u201dLeft Ear walked for an hour or so before saying \u201cThere is a wolf cave over there.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cGo negotiate with them so we can stay the night.\u201dThe wolf cave was very hidden, but Xiao Yao lived in the mountains for tens of years and could a.s.sess the surroundings well, plus Left Ear had a very acute sense of smell. In no time they found the wolf cave. Left Ear went in first and Xiao Yao slowly crawled in after. The wolf cave wasn\u2019t very high but was quite s.p.a.cious in width. Seven or eight little wolf pups stared at them while a horde of adult wolves surrounded them. Xiao Yao wondered why they weren\u2019t attacking when she saw Left Ear sitting in front of one large wolf. That was the alpha male clearly and Xiao Yao smiled at how Left Ear didn\u2019t know any war strategy but intuitively knew that winning a battle meant taking the leader first.Left Ear grabbed the wolf leader out of the cave, likely to eliminate any traces outside using the best method of having the wolf pee all around. A short time later, Left Ear came back and the wolf leader bounded inside. The wolves formed a semi-circle surrounding Xiao Yao and Left Ear, tense like they wanted to attack but not daring to.Xiao Yao knew an agreement was reached and asked Left Ear \u201cDo you have medicine on you?\u201dLeft Ear took out two bottles \u201cMiao Pu gave these to me.\u201d Left Ear was a slave for so long he was accustomed to carry nothing, so even these two items he only kept on him because Miao Pu forced him to take it.One bottle had thousand year old bone essence from Jade Mountain, the other a small piece of G.o.dly wood that burned without being ignited. Xiao Yao laughed \u201cMiao Pu is certainly generous, giving you these priceless items.\u201dXiao Yao handed the bone essence back to Left Ear \u201cKeep this safe, at the critical moment it can extend your life.\u201d Bone essence was no use to Xiao Yao since she drank so much of it living on Jade Mountain, but for Left Ear it could keep him alive, and only by him staying alive could she hope to make it out.Left Ear said \u201cWhen I came, I saw a lot of guards and servants searching for you. Shall we rendezvous with them?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see. Grandfather may be powerful but these years he tries to avoid any a.s.sociation of using his power so he doesn\u2019t get involved with the Sheng Nong Mountain security guards. Other than the guards on Xiao Yue Peak, none of the guards belong to Grandfather and report to him. Without Zhuan Xu around, I don\u2019t know which guards are trustworthy. What if they act like they are here to rescue but really to finish me off? Why deliver ourselves to them?\u201dLeft Ear didn\u2019t ponder any further and closed his eyes to rest. As a slave at the edge of life and death all the time, his demeanor was always calm and he never let any opportunity to rest pa.s.s.\u201dDespite the pain in her body, Xiao Yao also started to fall asleep.Left Ear suddenly opened his years and jostled Xiao Yao towards outside.Someone was here! Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know if it was someone here to rescue or kill her. She strained to hear and there were footsteps outside that gradually grew faint. Suddenly she heard two voices \u2013 it was Feng Long and Xing Yue! They were likely conversing near the opening to the wolf cave. Feng Long likely used an enchantment to protect their conversation, but there was some gap due to Left Ear\u2019s actions earlier in securing the perimeter. The voices were audible but very soft, requiring Xiao Yao to strain to listen but even then she could only make out a bit of what they were saying.Xing Yue\u2019s voice was agitated but m.u.f.fled, clear that she was saying a lot.\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Feng Long booming voice was loud and clear since he was so furious.\u201cI already did it\u2026\u2026a released arrow cannot go back to the bow\u2026\u2026I can only try and kill Xiao Yao before His Majesty gets back. I\u2019ve already thought of a cover story and pin all the blame on\u2026\u2026..\u201d Xing Yue\u2019s voice grew m.u.f.fled again.It wasn\u2019t clear what Feng Long said but Xing Yue\u2019s voice suddenly rose an octave and she shrieked in fury and sadness \u201cWhen you were growing up without a care in Chi Sui, did you think about my life in Xuan Yuan Castle? I carefully tried to get on the good side of all those lords and ladies, all while you were sleeping exhausted after playing all day! I would wake up from nightmares, praying that Dad wouldn\u2019t revolt and the Yellow Emperor wouldn\u2019t kill me. When I was a kid being a hostage, you were growing up without a care and never once helped me. When His Majesty wanted to make Ah Nian an Empress as well, you actually talked me into agreeing just for a few plots of prime land. This is my first time begging you, if you don\u2019t want to help me then get the f.u.c.k out! From childhood until now I haven\u2019t needed your help and won\u2019t need to start now either!\u201d\u201cI urged you to agree to Ah Nian being Empress not for the added land, but because it was also in your best interests.\u201d\u201cJust leave! I don\u2019t want to hear what you have to say anymore! If I live, if I die, it\u2019s got nothing to do with you!\u201d Xing Yue\u2019s voice gradually disappeared as she likely was rus.h.i.+ng off.\u201cXing Yue, listen to me\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Long\u2019s voice was filled with regret and his voice also trailed off as he hurried after Xing Yue.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t hear the rest of their conversation but she knew that in the end Feng Long would agree to help Xing Yue! It wasn\u2019t just because they were siblings, but also because Feng Long felt he owed Xing Yue because she was the hostage in Xuan Yuan Castle when they were growing up, that allowed him to grow up carefree in Chi Sui.Feng Long didn\u2019t want to hurt Xiao Yao but life often had choices that one was forced to choose. Even if doing so would be difficult to endure, one would go down that path. Xiao Yao understood but she was still saddened as she remembered years ago the parties and singing under the moonlight, where did that all go that Xing Yue had to kill her no matter what?Left Ear said \u201cThey are going to work together to kill you.\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cI heard it.\u201dLeft Ear added \u201cThey will be back.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe killers were afraid Xiao Yao would escape so was rus.h.i.+ng ahead to catch up to her. Once they couldn\u2019t find her ahead, they would double back and at such time even this hidden spot would be discovered.Left Ear stared intently at Xiao Yao who shook her head \u201cDon\u2019t keep thinking about killing people. Feng Long has strong powers and Xing Yue is surrounded by top guards. You won\u2019t be able to kill them. Let\u2019s just try and escape!\u201dAfter Miao Pu\u2019s repeated lectures, Left Ear learned that a bodyguard\u2019s only job was to protect, and killing was only used in protecting. He wasn\u2019t as fixated on killing anymore so he listened to Xiao Yao. She thought a bit and said \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to escape out of Sheng Nong Mountain, and even if we do it\u2019s likely not any safer.\u201dSheng Nong and Chi Sui, Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare underestimate the combined power of Xing Yue and Feng Long. In Sheng Nong Mountain at least they would hold back a bit, outside they would likely do anything. Xiao Yao said \u201cThe only safe place is Xiao Yue Peak, we need to find a way to get back there, or find a way to stay alive until Zhuan Xu gets back.\u201dIt was also dawn so the news of what happened would have been sent. The fastest Zhuan Xu could get back was two days and two nights later, so the road to staying alive was two days and two nights long!Xiao Yao said \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, let\u2019s set off!\u201dLeft Ear carried Xiao Yao on his back and she moaned in pain. Left Ear asked in concern \u201cCan you endure?\u201dXiao Yao fell from the sky and even if she survived she was still gravely injured. Even the accustomed to injury Left Ear was worried about her. Xiao Yao said \u201cI can hang on! Don\u2019t worry, my body is different than most people.\u201dLeft Ear scrambled out of the wolf cave and headed in the direction of Xiao Yue Peak.Along the way Xiao Yao looked around and occasionally had Left Ear pick various herbs. She also had Left Ear pick a sour fruit and they both ate some. Later she was so exhausted she fell asleep on his back.When Xiao Yao woke up, she was sitting on the ground against a tree while Left Ear fought with six attackers, with four dead bodies already on the ground.Left Ear finally understood the difference between killer and bodyguard, his goal was to protect Xiao Yao so his every move included keeping someone from attacking Xiao Yao. He could not attack freely so was like a caged beast, his power greatly reduced, so he was already covered in even more injuries.Xiao Yao looked at the wind direction and coughed while taking a handful of dried leaves and placing it on the small piece of G.o.dly wood and then inserting the herbs Left Ear collected this morning. A smoke started to rise and the wind carried it around.\u201cBe careful! The smoke is poison!\u201dBy the time the killers reacted it was too late and their movements slacked. Left Ear used that opportunity to swiftly kill them all.Left Ear curiously asked \u201cThat was poison?\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cNo, poison needs to be brewed and cooked together, those herbs will only stun people temporarily. The sour fruits we at this morning was the antidote to the effects of this herb.\u201dLeft Ear wanted to extinguish the fire but Xiao Yao told him to throw more wet branches on it. Soon there was a thick black smoke rising high into the sky.Left Ear carried Xiao Yao and started to run again as Xiao Yao explained \u201cOur tracks are already revealed so might as well expose ourselves completely. The thick smoke will attract the attention of those who are actually here to save us, and might make those who are here to kill us hesitate as Feng Long and Xing Yue will be wary. I also don\u2019t want them to figure out how we killed those people, a secret trick is of no use when people know about it.\u201dLeft Ear saw Xiao Yao\u2019s face stark white and her energy flagging \u201cYou sleep a bit now.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cSure.\u201d But instead she got up her energy to keep looking around for herbs to help Left Ear or anything that could come in handy to save them.It could be Xiao Yao\u2019s planned work, or Left Ear was adept at hiding, either way they didn\u2019t encounter any more attackers by the time sun set.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t express any discomfort other than whimpering if Left Ear\u2019s running was too jerky, but that was enough for Left Ear to sense she was in great pain.At nighttime, he chose a very hidden spot and had Xiao Yao lie down. Xiao Yao handed him herbs for his injuries and he asked \u201cNo herbs for you?\u201dXiao Yao smiled wanly \u201cMy const.i.tution is very different, I ingested all sorts of herbs and medicines when I was small so I recover faster than most people, but conversely most herbs and medicines have no effect on me. I need very rare items to heal from a grave injury.\u201dLeft Ear killed a little deer and he could eat it raw but didn\u2019t know how to feed Xiao Yao without starting a fire. Xiao Yao needed food otherwise she wouldn\u2019t last the night. Xiao Yao said \u201cI can drink the blood even if I can\u2019t eat the raw meat.\u201dLeft Ear bit open the deer\u2019s soft neck and placed the wound next to Xiao Yao\u2019s lips. She drank the fresh blood, about a bowlful, before she shook her hand indicating enough.Left Ear squatted to the corner and quickly ate the deer, making no sound at all, likely still remembering on the s.h.i.+p Xiao Yao asking Xiang Liu to have Furball eat his meal elsewhere.After Left Ear finished eating, he covered the tracks before was.h.i.+ng his hand and going over to carry Xiao Yao on his back again.Xiao Yao said \u201cNow let\u2019s head away from Xiao Yue Peak, and move slower but cover our tracks better, no matter what don\u2019t leave any tracks.\u201dLeft Ear looked around before jumping on a tree to travel from branch to branch.Xiao Yao explained \u201cFeng Long and Xing Yue know that only Xiao Yue Peak can protect me so they will have stationed more people waiting for us there to kill me once and for all. We can\u2019t beat them by force so we have to endure until Zhuan Xu gets back. Even if Zhuan Xu doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s Feng Long and Xing Yue, he\u2019s a suspicious person by nature so he won\u2019t trust anyone anymore. He will send everyone away and only keep his most trusted people around Sheng Nong Mountain after this.\u201dLeft Ear could tell she was having trouble talking \u201cDon\u2019t need to explain, I trust you. Rest up now.\u201dXiao Yao was starting to see things and before her flashed Xiang Liu and she murmured \u201cOne day you will become very smart and powerful, and won\u2019t need me anymore. I\u2019m just upset that your transformation won\u2019t have my involvement, which is why I\u2019m going to teach you as much as I can now.\u201dLeft Ear was indeed truly intuitive and asked \u201cI will become like Xiang Liu?\u201dXiao Yao drowsily said \u201cI hope it\u2019s more like Bei\u2026\u2026but it\u2019s all the same! No matter what you become, I will accompany you to walk the entire path\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao pa.s.sed out and Left Ear kept going until stopping right before dawn. He saw Xiao Yao\u2019s face turn red hot and called \u201cXiao Yao\u2026..Xiao Yao\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t respond and the normally fearless Left Ear started to feel afraid for the first time. He took out the bottle of bone essence and fed it to Xiao Yao before putting her back on his back and heading off again.With his alert senses, he managed to avoid two groups of seachers and when no one was around he would call Xiao Yao\u2019s name but never got any response.At sunset Left Ear finally stopped because he was so exhausted he couldn\u2019t move another step. He placed Xiao Yao on soft gra.s.s and looked at her burning face. He grabbed a large frond to fan her while also using it to cup water to feed her.Xiao Yao finally woke up and Left Ear said \u201cYou hang in there, after tonight when the sun rises tomorrow we\u2019ll be safe.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes were unfocused and didn\u2019t seem to see Left Ear, instead smiling at the distance \u201cMagnolias.\u201dLeft Ear saw that Xiao Yao liked those pink flowers and quickly plucked an armful to bring back and place around her.Left Ear placed on in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and she said \u201cWhen the weather is nice I\u2019ll wash your hair, and you can wash my hair, Jing. Don\u2019t forget to pluck the leaves in the morning dew.\u201dLeft Ear knew Xiao Yao was delirious and could no nothing other than repeating \u201cEndure tonight and His Majesty will be here at sunrise, so you have to make it until then.\u201dXiao Yao smiled at the flower as the sun gradually set. Xiao Yao suddenly started crying \u201cJing, the flower is gone! I can\u2019t see you anymore!\u201d Her eyes were about to close and Left Ear suddenly felt that he could not let Xiao Yao sleep no matter what, otherwise she would never wake up again.Left Ear took some branches and shoved the G.o.dly wood inside, the entire thing lit up like a torch \u201cLook! So many flowers, so many many flowers!\u201dXiao Yao tried hard and opened her eyes and took in the flowers.Left Ear didn\u2019t care about exposing their location anymore, instead throwing more and more wood into the fire to burn brightly so XiaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the other side of the jewel curtain sat Zhuan Xu at the desk reading official doc.u.ments.Xiao Yao s.h.i.+fted slightly and Zhuan Xu tossed the doc.u.ment down and rushed over \u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhere is Left Ear?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cInjured but nothing critical.\u201d\u201cHow long have I been asleep?\u201d\u201cOne day and one night.\u201dXiao Yao noticed his exhausted demeanor and smiled sadly \u201cSorry for worrying you again.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019m fine, just need to sleep. I\u2019ve already ordered the Li Jie Consort to be locked up in her residence for now.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cDo you really think it\u2019s her?\u201d\u201cSince the Li Jie Consort entered the Palace, she only likes to wander Sheng Nong Mountain and is uninterested in anything else. She\u2019s also very aloof towards me. This matter doesn\u2019t seem like her doing. After Yin checked you out and confirmed there was no danger, I went to interrogate her personally. She admitted writing the invite, organizing the lantern release party, she picked the swallow herself, and her two maids have committed suicide to atone so all the signs point to her and she doesn\u2019t have any good explanation.\u201d\u201cWho do you think really did it?\u201dZhuan Xu furrowed his brows \u201cBecause it\u2019s the Li Jie Consort, that makes it even harder to pinpoint as she doesn\u2019t have many enemies or friends in the Palace. Anyone could have set her up, and daring to strike in Sheng Nong Mountain requires a lot of guts but many of the consorts come from powerful families. But.\u2026\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s expression grew dark \u201cThe likely suspects have been narrowed down now to a small group. Last time she hired a killer to off you so I considered whether it was due to Qi Yo, but now it appears unrelated. I want to see how long she can hide.\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand clenched into a fist, he was filled with blame and fury, with all the care he put into protecting Xiao Yao, it ended up being someone in Zhi Jin Palace that wanted her dead.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy do you think she wants to kill me?\u201dThis question, when Xiao Yao first encountered danger Zhuan Xu had already asked himself. If he figured out why someone wanted to kill Xiao Yao, he could easily discover the killer. But he was well aware that, from a certain perspective, every single woman on Zhi Jin Summit had reason to hate Xiao Yao. But that was his deepest secret, hidden away so deeply and for so long, by now he felt that it was simply part of his life. He would always carry it, and no one would ever know.Everyone knew the Black Emperor was very caring towards family, and everyone also knew the Black Emperor personally formed the marriage alliance between Xiao Yao and Feng Long, and later even saw the Black Emperor order the Xi Ling family to accept Jing\u2019s request to marry Xiao Yao\u2026..time and time again Zhuan Xu arranged for Xiao Yao to be married. Forgot other people, even Zhuan Xu himself saw absurd it was.Zhuan Xu coldly laughed \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe she discovered some secret.\u201dXiao Yao wearily closed her eyes \u2013 Xing Yue and Feng Long wanted to kill her! One was Zhuan Xu\u2019s Empress and the other his best buddy. Xiao Yoa didn\u2019t know what to do. Even if Zhuan Xu knew, he wouldn\u2019t order his top general and empress to be killed. Plus the empress was the daughter of Little Zhu Rong while the general was the head of the Chi Sui clan, the leader of the Four Great Clans.A month later, Xiao Yao could walk using a crutch so she had Miao Pu a.s.sist her off the pallet.She had Miao Pu take a list of herbs and go a.s.semble it, and also make a target. Once Xiao Yao was all better, she wanted to start making poisons and practicing her archery again.After Xiao Yao tired from walking, she sat underneath a tree to relax in the shade and also teach Left Ear to read and write. He easily memorized a character but had trouble understanding meaning in phrases. Like, he couldn\u2019t understand what it meant to be \u201cangry but unable to express.\u201d He thought \u201cangry then kill\u201d, leaving Xiao Yao explaining until her throat was parched. She thought about General Gong Gong having a headache dealing with Xiang Liu like this and felt it so funny.One was teaching with a headache and the other learning with a headache when a servant announced that the Empress, the Chi Sui Clan Leader, and Ji Jie Tribe Leader were all here to see Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao pondered before saying \u201cInvite them in.\u201dLeft Ear stared at Xiao Yao, unable to understand why she wanted to see the enemy.Xiao Yao patted Left Ear on the shoulder and said with a smile \u201cEarlier you asked me what it mean to 'smile and act like nothing is up.\u201d I\u2019m going to show you exactly that right now. You try to learn it, if you do it then I\u2019ll have a prize for you.\u201dXing Yue, Feng Long, and Li Jie Chang walked inside. Xiao Yao rested under the tree and made no move, saying with a smile \u201cI can\u2019t move easily to greet Your Highness, will Your Highness please forgive.\u201dXing Yue smiled pleasantly \u201cWe\u2019re here to check on your recovery, not here for curtsies. You just rest there!\u201dMiao Pu readied seating and invited the visitors to sit down.Feng Long kept his head low drinking his tea, saying nothing.Xing Yue and Chang were gregarious like usual, asking if Xiao Yao was recovering well, what she ate, giving her suggestions. Xiao Yao smiled and conversed with them pleasantly, sneaking glances at Left Ear from time to time. He stood there like a statue, which to Xiao Yao appeared to be Left Ear\u2019s attempt to act like nothing was up.Xing Yue laughed \u201cToday we came to see how you\u2019re doing, but also to ask a favor of you.\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cFavor is too strong a word, Your Highness please go ahead.\u201dChang\u2019s smile disappeared and he said \u201cI begged Her Highness to bring me to see you. I think you already know the reason. Since you were attacked my older sister has been locked up, with no information to be had. My family is worried sick and I know there is no proof to convince you that my sister didn\u2019t orchestrate it. But with her personality, she will likely silently accept it rather than risk involving the whole family. The truth is, I asked my older sister to invite you to the lantern release party so she can convey some words from me. I also asked her to accompany you out more often to ease your sadness. I don\u2019t know if my sister shared all that with you before the incident happened. Xiao Yao, I beg you on account of our friends.h.i.+p, can you please beg for mercy for my sister with His Majesty.\u201d Chang stood up and bowed low to Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao quickly said \u201cNo need for that, please sit and let\u2019s talk.\u201dChang refused to get up so Xing Yue said \u201cI may not be close with the Li Jie Consort but Chang and my Gege have known each other since they were kids so I believe Chang\u2019s explanation. I tried asking for mercy in front of His Majesty but he doesn\u2019t listen to me. Xiao Yao, likely only you can sway His Majesty now.\u201dChang bowed low to Xing Yue \u201cThank Your Highness.\u201dNormally Chang was the big boss of the underground casino, carefree and brash, but today he was worn down and solemn. Xiao Yao saw Xing Yue acting all sincere and also at the silent Feng Long and decided not to keep silent any longer. She said to Chang \u201cBefore the attack happened, Li Jie Consort already pa.s.sed your words to me. You don\u2019t have to worry, I believe you.\u201dChang\u2019s face lit up in joy \u201cReally?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cReally. His Majesty isn\u2019t easily manipulated, he just needs time to get to the bottom of things.\u201dChang finally relaxed a bit \u201cThank you.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI want to thank you and Li Jie Consort, you treat Jing as a good friend and that\u2019s why you both care about how I\u2019m doing.\u201dThe mention of Jing made Chang look sadder \u201cThe Li Jie tribe was once very down and out due to the connection with Qi Yo, and Jing helped me a lot so the truth is that he\u2019s more like a savior to my entire tribe. All I can do now is express a bit of concern.\u201dFeng Long suddenly stood up and stiffly said \u201cThe discussion is finished so let\u2019s go back now!\u201dChang thought Feng Long was awkward because of Xiao Yao running away from the wedding so quickly said goodbye \u201cWe won\u2019t interrupt your recovery more, next time let\u2019s find a chance to getogether.\u201dXiao Yao smiled at Xing Yue \u201cI want to chat with Your Majesty some more, how about have the guys leave first.\u201dXing Yue smiled back \u201cSure! We\u2019re not headed to the same place anymore, they are going back to Zhi Yi Castle while I\u2019m going to Zhi Jin Palace.\u201dAfter Feng Long and Chang left, Xiao Yao said to Miao Pu \u201cIt\u2019s enough with Left Ear here, you go prepare some cool drinks as summer afternoon refreshment.\u201dMiao Pu knew Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want her to listen to the conversation so nodded and left.Xiao Yao stared at Xing Yue, who initially was all smiles until gradually her smile grew frozen. Xing Yue awkwardly said \u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhy do you want to kill me?\u201dXing Yue forced a laughed and acted nonchalant \u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t understand.\u201dXiao Yao said each word slowly \u201cI asked why do you want to kill me?\u201dXing Yue frantically stood up and turned to leave.Xiao Yao yelled \u201cStop! Sheng Nong Xing Yue, if you\u2019re this much of a coward then why even attempt it? And not even once but twice!\u201dXing Yue stopped and turned back towards Xiao Yao, her demeanor calm and expression filled with disgust. She coldly said \u201cIf you already know, why haven\u2019t you told His Majesty?\u201dXiao Yao asked again \u201cI want to know why do you want to kill me?\u201dXing Yue shook her head while laughing out loud. Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know, she actually didn\u2019t know anything! Xing Yue suddenly felt Zhuan Xu was so pitiful and pathetic, an Emperor above all who ruled the entire world, and he couldn\u2019t even express his longing for one woman.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201dXing Yue replied \u201cI\u2019m laughing at myself, and laughing at Zhuan Xu! You ask me why I want to kill you, well I\u2019ve already told you before.\u201dXiao Yao thought back and was confused \u201cWhat did you tell me?\u201dXing Yue said \u201cWhen you were getting ready to marry Jing, I came to Xiao Yue Peak and told you that if anyone was going to take something I owned away from me, I would not let her off the hook!\u201dXiao Yao was even more confused \u201cWhat have I taken from you?\u201d\u201cWhat have you taken from me? Which woman of all the women on Zhi Jin Summit can see His Majesty every single day?\u201d\u201cSo many consorts, it\u2019s impossible for any one to see Zhuan Xu every day.\u201dXing Yue smirked \u201cSo even you know that no woman can see His Majesty every single day. But there is one woman, as long as His Majesty is on Sheng Nong Mountain, who can see him every day. Who is she, Xiao Yao?\u201dXiao Yao was stunned, there was a woman on Zhi Jin Summit who could see Zhuan Xu every single day? Did he find the woman that he truly loved?Xing Yue stalked towards Xiao Yao \u201cOn all of Sheng Nong Mountain, there is no woman who dares to go against His Majesty. We don\u2019t even dare say an extra word, but there is one woman who dares to strike His Majesty, cause him to sport a bruise when he meets with his officials. Xiao Yao, who is she?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart thundered and her face was wide with shock. She opened her mouth but could say nothing.Xing Yue continued to walk towards Xiao Yao and coldly said \u201cOf all of Zhi Jin Summit\u2019s consorts, who dares call His Majesty by his first name? Who dares walk alongside His Majesty? Who dares let His Majesty dry her hem and carry her shoe?\u201dXiao Yao anxiously tried to explain \u201cWhat of it if it\u2019s all me? You haven\u2019t just met Zhuan Xu and me, you knew we interacted like this with each other since you met us.\u201dXing Yue glared at Xiao Yao, her face exploding with hatred \u201cXiao Yao, how dare you say you didn\u2019t take anything from me? Everything I want, you have it! Now it\u2019s only this much, what will happen when the day arrives you want to be the Empress?\u201dXiao Yao angrily retorted \u201cYou\u2019re insane! I\u2026.I\u2026.how could I ever want to be the Empress?\u201dXing Yue laughed loudly \u201cI\u2019m crazy? I\u2019m the most sane person around! His Majesty sees you as important as his life, you are willing to risk your life for His Majesty! Now that Jing is dead, one day you\u2019ll realize that you and His Majesty\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up! Shut up!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dThe first two were Xiao Yao screaming out, but the final shut up came from Zhuan Xu. He was standing at the door coldly staring at Xing Yue before calmly walking inside.Xing Yue unconsciously s.h.i.+vered and immediately bowed low \u201cYour Majesty.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI figured it was you, who knew you would admit it yourself.\u201dXing Yue didn\u2019t prostrate herself to beg forgiveness, instead she straightened her back and stared unflinching at Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu said to Xiao Xiao \u201cEscort the Empress back to Zhi Jin Palace. Lately it\u2019s not as safe, send a few more guards to protect the Empress.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Xiao and two guards escorted, or more like insisted, Xing Yue into the cloud carriage and took off.Zhuan Xu said to Left Ear \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201dXiao Yao yelled \u201cNo!\u201d She was scared right now to be alone with Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t insist and instead sat on the pallet and silently stared at Xiao Yao. She looked left and right, like so many things around her was interesting, and did everything she could not to look at Zhuan Xu. He was the opposite, he just stared at Xiao Yao like she was the only thing left in the entire world.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t speak, like he could be this way until the end of time. Xiao Yao licked her lips and said awkwardly \u201cXing Yue is mistaken, I\u2026..you\u2026.it\u2019s impossible! She must have misunderstood!\u201d\u201cIf you think she\u2019s spouting nonsense then why fret over it?\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice was calm without a ripple.Xiao Yao felt a weight lifting and smiled towards Zhuan Xu, who continued to stare unblinking at her. In the darkness of his eyes there were two little hers, and an endless abyss of sadness like the darkest of night. Xiao Yao was scared, she wanted to run or hide, but she was caught up in that never ending darkness with no place to run or ride. She tried to smile and make things go back to the way it was.Xiao Yao frantically said \u201cXing Yue said I was the only woman on Sheng Nong Mountain who can see you every day. But she\u2019s wrong because you come to Xiao Yue Peak every day to pay your respects to Grandfather. She said I spent the most time with you but she\u2019s wrong, Xiao Xiao spends the most time with you! She says I can call you by your first name, but that\u2019s also wrong since Ah Nian also calls you Zhuan Xu gege. Xing Yue said I dared to hit you but that wasn\u2019t my fault! You attacked Gao Xing and I\u2019ve been a Gao Xing princess for hundreds of years, I can\u2019t be expected to not react. As for the hem drying and shoe carrying, it\u2019s really nothing since you did stuff like that for me when we were kids, but now you\u2019re the Emperor so everyone is watching is all! I\u2019ll be aware from now on and won\u2019t let you do stuff like that\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s voice started to quiver and her body was shaking, the smile on her face turning pitiful as if pleading with Zhuan Xu to agree with what she said, to agree that Xing Yue was mistaken.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t accede to Xiao Yao\u2019s plea, he looked down instead and stopped staring at Xiao Yao, so Xiao Yao grabbed her crutch and got up to run away.Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice rose to break the silence \u201cWhen I heard Xing Yue, Feng Long, and Chang came to see you, I hurried here and arrived just in time to hear you ask Xing Yue why she wanted to kill you. I knew the answer and could have stopped her from answering, but I did nothing and allowed her to say it.\u201dZhuan Xu sighed painfully \u201cXing Yue wanted to kill you which made me enraged, but as I listened to her talking I actually grew grateful towards her. The secret has been hidden inside for so long, and I\u2019ve done so many heartless things, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, the whole world wouldn\u2019t even it, and even I sometimes think about how absurd it all is. Yet there was one person who saw the truth! So in the eyes of one person out there, I am so so good to you. The Black Emperor Zhuan Xu isn\u2019t such a heartless person!\u201dZhuan Xu continued \u201cXiao Yao, I thought that I could wait, I could wait as long as it takes for you turn around and see me. But the more I wait the more I lose hope, I\u2019m so afraid you\u2019ll never look back, or when you look back you\u2019ll see someone else who isn\u2019t me! You can see Feng Long wanting to marry you, you can see Jing being good to you, you can see how charming and interesting Fang Feng Bei is, but in your eyes you see me arranging for you to date other men, agreeing for you to marry other men, and even doing so with a smile on my face. I did it not just once, but twice\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s legs buckled and she weakly sat back down on the pallet, the crutch falling from her land and landing with a resounding thud.Zhuan Xu kneeled down before Xiao Yao and placed the crutch to the side \u201cEvery time I take a new wife I forbade you from congratulating me. I am Xuan Yuan Zhuan Xu, from the moment my mom committed suicide this is the path I chose. I cannot say no to the marriage alliances, I can\u2019t tell people I don\u2019t want it, that I hate it! My only consolation is you not congratulating me, I decided that if I didn\u2019t get your congratulations then it means every wedding didn\u2019t have your consent and without your consent then it doesn\u2019t count!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled pitifully \u201cIsn\u2019t it laughable? The whole world sees it but I still don\u2019t think any of it counts, because none of the weddings got your consent!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes teared up as she remembered Zhuan Xu\u2019s reaction before each marriage.Zhuan Xu said \u201cIn Xuan Yuan Castle, you laughed about me being so different than my parents. They only had each other in their entire lives, while I was marrying woman after woman. Then I thought I was really different from them, not because I have a lot of women, but because I knew I only wanted you yet was willing to give up that love to succeed! I even saw you smiling with Jing and being okay with it since we were still alive, and that was all that mattered. As long as you didn\u2019t end up like Grandmother, Auntie or my mom, crying and in pain, then nothing else mattered! No matter if I had other women or you have other men, it didn\u2019t matter at all! But later I realized I was still their son and just like them, I didn\u2019t just want to stay alive, I wanted to stay alive with you! I want to welcome the dawn every morning with you, I want to have dinner every night after coming home from working hard, I want to build swings for you and push you on the swing, I want to plant phoenix trees for you, to watch the flowers bloom on it, to suck the honey out of the petals, to talk to you, to see you smile, to hear you sing\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anymore!\u201d Xiao Yao shut her eyes painfully as her tears continued to fall.Zhuan Xu remained kneeling before Xiao Yao and placed his arms on the pallet to look up at her \u201cYou once sincerely wished that I would find the woman I want to marry. I already found her. Xiao Yao, I know you haven\u2019t forgotten Jing but I can wait, I am willing to wait until your emotional wounds have healed, until you are willing to marry me. I won\u2019t ask that you forget Jing, I just want you to give a part of your heart to me. I just want a little bit, a tiny little portion, so that we can spend the remaining days of our lives together.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s position was very subservient and his words pleading and pitiful. In his entire life, he always courageously fought for what he wanted, never then did he beg with such a low demeanor.Xiao Yao continued to cry, not sure for what she was crying about \u2013 that she loved but could not have, or that Zhuan Xu\u2019s love all these years could not have.\u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t cry!\u201d Zhuan Xu wanted to comfort Xiao Yao but didn\u2019t know how to right now. He just tried to guess her feelings \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry\u2026\u2026.nothing has changed, only that you know I want to marry you. I\u2019m not asking you to accept me, I\u2019m willing to wait, even wait until we die, none of that matters to me\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao flopped on the pallet, crying even more loudly.Zhuan Xu grew silent, he knew things had changed, and it was because he wanted more from her. Zhuan Xu said painfully \u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t hate me! I love you, that\u2019s not wrong!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was smushed on the pallet so her expression wasn\u2019t visible but her crying decreased and she said \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, I just don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026don\u2019t know what to do\u2026..you go back now, I want to be alone.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s hand reach out instinctively to comfort Xiao Yao but he pulled back, silently getting up and walking out with heavy steps.Xiao Yao heard from his footsteps a never before heard weight, she knew that she wasn\u2019t the only person hurting right now. Zhuan Xu hurt more than she did, he was even more sad. Xiao Yao started to cry harder again, once they were each other\u2019s only support and comfort, who knew they would be hurting each other today.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to have to avoid Zhuan Xu, like he said it wasn\u2019t wrong for him to like her. But at the moment she didn\u2019t know how to face him, so she tried her hardest to avoid him. When he came to Xiao Yue Peak, Xiao Yao would plaster herself next to the Yellow Emperor.Zhuan Xu understood what she was doing so he didn\u2019t force her nor did he let it go. He was still the same, coming to Xiao Yue Peak every day, talking with the Yellow Emperor and taking tea.Gradually Xiao Yao became less nervous, and as long as neither brought it up, they easily fell back to the way they interacted.One night, Zhuan Xu chatted with the Yellow Emperor for a bit and was taking his leave when he noticed the moon was exceptionally bright. He turned to Xiao Yao \u201cHaven\u2019t been to the phoenix tree forest in some time, take a walk with me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m turning in.\u201d The sun had just set and even Xiao Yao felt this excuse was beyond lame.Zhuan Xu said nothing, silently looking at Xiao Yao for a moment before walking out of the courtyard headed to the phoenix tree forest alone. His figure seemed especially lonesome.Xiao Yao watched his figure disappear into the phoenix tree forest like it was gradually being swallowed by the night, just like she was also being swallowed by the night, with no hope and no comfort.Xiao Yao stood there in a daze for some time before bolting out of the residence and running towards the phoenix tree forest.Xiao Yao stood under the phoenix tree bent over breathing heavily while looking around is dismay \u201cZhuan Xu! Zhuan Xu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d There was no answer and no sign of anyone, Zhuan Xu had already left.Xiao Yao slowly sat down on the gra.s.s and wrapped her arms around her knees, burying her head in her lap. She felt sad, and confused, because the things Zhuan Xu wanted she couldn\u2019t give him.A gust of wind scattered the clouds over the moon and the silvery moonlight shone down like water on the forest. Xiao Yao felt the brightness around her and looked up.In the bright moonlight, thousands of white roses were blooming before her eyes, each one as beautiful as a precious jewel. Zhuan Xu stood inside the sea of blooming roses with a big smile, using his powers to make the roses bloom like a rippling wave until it reached Xiao Yao and surrounded her.Xiao Yao stared at Zhuan Xu before angrily grabbing a handful of roses and tossing it angrily at him \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer if you didn\u2019t leave?\u201dZhuan Xu caught the roses and walked over with a smile \u201cWith your low powers, getting physical is a habit you need to change.\u201d\u201cI asked why you didn\u2019t say anything?\u201dZhuan Xu sat down beside Xiao Yao \u201cI wanted to scare you, who knew the moonlight would come back just now. Was it pretty?\u201dSeeing Zhuan Xu like this, Xiao Yao relaxed and punched him on the arm and huffed \u201cWhy did you call me out then, not to see you do magic tricks?\u201d\u201cI wanted to know who else other than Xing Yue tried to hurt you?\u201d\u201cIf you want to know, ask Xing Yue.\u201d\u201cShe said she had no cohorts and did it all alone?\u201d Actually, Xing Yue mocked him when she said that she wished another person could see through Zhuan Xu\u2019s secret, except it was only her. Doesn\u2019t Zhuan Xu feel so pathetic?Xiao Yao thought and knew Xing Yue wasn\u2019t going to drag Feng Long down with her and was willing to shoulder the blame herself.Zhuan Xu asked \u201cXiao Yao, was Feng Long involved with this?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cNo! At least I think he\u2019s not. Feng Long and Xing Yue may be siblings but they grew up apart and are vastly different, they even have different last names. Feng Long wouldn\u2019t be so rash\u2026\u2026\u201dZhuan Xu let out a sigh of relief \u201cThat\u2019s good, if it\u2019s just Xing Yue then it\u2019s easier to take care of now.\u201dXiao Yao let out a silent sigh, even if Zhuan Xu could do it, punis.h.i.+ng the Sheng Nong Empress and the Chi Sui Great General would still be a hard problem to swallow.Zhuan Xu said \u201cThe first time Xing Yue tried to kill you, no one knows about it. It\u2019s not something that should be bandied about so I won\u2019t reveal it. The second time she tried to kill you, everyone saw it so I have to publicly deal with it. But Xing Yue is the daughter of Little Zhu Rong and the Empress, so I won\u2019t deal with it openly otherwise the Middle Plains folks will think I\u2019m targeting them.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t understand how Zhuan Xu could do this without contradicting himself.Zhuan Xu explained \u201cI spoke with the Li Jie Consort, she\u2019s going to take all the blame for trying to kill you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cDon\u2019t freak out just yet, let me explain. Li Jie Consort doesn\u2019t like living on Zhi Jin Summit and if she took the blame then she can move out and I can give her any of the hundreds of available mountain ranges on Sheng Nong Mountain for her to live freely. The world will think she\u2019s being isolated and punished, but in truth she\u2019s no longer going to deal with the schemes and in fighting with the other consorts. She also isn\u2019t bound by the rules and traditions anymore and can live her life as she pleases.\u201d\u201cLi Jie Consort agrees? And her family does as well?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s smart, she knows this is a big burden to carry but it will give her everything she wants. She\u2019ll also take care of her family, I know she didn\u2019t do it so I won\u2019t harm the Li Jie tribe and will instead secretly give them a lot of rewards. I think she\u2019s probably thanking the person who pinned the blame on her right now.\u201dXiao Yao scoffed \u201cI can\u2019t believe there is a woman out there who doesn\u2019t want to be with you. She would rather go be banished than live on Zhi Jin Summit!\u201dZhuan Xu laughed back \u201cWho cares if she doesn\u2019t like me, I would rather they all didn\u2019t like me and left\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao cut him off \u201cHow are you going to deal with Xing Yue if the blame is given to Li Jie Consort? She tried to kill me twice but I didn\u2019t die so don\u2019t make it too big and have the world notice.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know how to deal with it. It won\u2019t cause any ripples, and in fact I don\u2019t want to create any more waves lest it makes more people hate you.\u201dXiao Yao realized Zhuan Xu handled it so the Sheng Nong tribe wouldn\u2019t hate her because they don\u2019t even know, and Li Jie tribe got a lot of benefits so they won\u2019t be angry with her.Zhuan Xu said \u201cTonight I called you out to tell you that it\u2019s all over! You can rest easy as there will never be anyone trying to harm you again.\u201dXiao Yao plucked a rose and took a deep sniff \u201cZhuan Xu, no need to protect me this well like a tender bloom. We endured so much, and as long as the tough experiences doesn\u2019t destroy us then it is actually an invaluable a.s.set in life. Xing Yue\u2019s matter has prompted me to practice my archery and take up poison making again.\u201dUnder the moonlight, Xiao Yao\u2019s smile was like the dew dropped white rose, beautiful in its simplicity. Zhuan Xu thought that he would be willing to endure anything coming if the future he could sit like this side-by-side with Xiao Yao talking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So get your tissues ready and expect it to hurt and hurt really really bad right where the heart is. LYF has been a sadness train for many episodes now, ever since Jing fell into the river and Xiao Yao\u2019s so close happy ending went along with it. Her bouts with a.s.sa.s.sination kept the action high and the wallowing in sadness to a minimum, but at the core of it she\u2019s still a very unhappy girl who can\u2019t get a simple normal ever after with her simple normal man.With the remaining two men in her life, in one hand is her Emperor gege, and on the other is her demon secret heart connected not quite a friend but closer than just friends. It\u2019s complicated doesn\u2019t even begin to describe Xiao Yao and Xiang Liu, but for 45 chapters they\u2019ve managed to make their indescribable relations.h.i.+p work. Sadly that\u2019s coming to a close as the war between Xuan Yuan and the resistance army finally explodes right in front of Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes. Circ.u.mstances, and one very stubborn and self-sacrificing Xiang Liu, pushes Xiao Yao to make a final decision that she\u2019s been avoiding.Ch 46 \u2013 The Heart Doesn\u2019t Hurt When Bygones Aren\u2019t Pondered:Ever since the Gao Xing Princess married the Xuan Yuan Black Emperor, Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan merged into one kingdom with the Black Emperor as ruler. Nearly the entire vast wilderness was under the Black Emperor\u2019s authority, and other than the ocean kingdoms on scattered islands, there was only one place that was not under his power \u2013 the various mountains occupied by the Sheng Nong Resistance Army and Qing Shui Town bordering it.After Gao Xing and Xuan Yuan merged, there were scattered conflicts and even brief skirmishes, but after twenty years under the Black Emperor\u2019s rule, the vast wilderness was at peace with transportation, goods, and culture freely exchanged. There might be lone voices of dissent but had no impact on the steady governance of the Black Emperor.One Spring day, the Black Emperor sent Little Zhu Rong to pay a visit to Gong Gong and request his surrender and joining of the kingdom. Gong Gong refused, and within the span of three months the Black Emperor sent Little Zhu Rong three more times to see Gong Gong, each time with ever greater rewards and incentive. He even promised to make Gong Gong a regional King with his own armed forces, and allow him to govern the entire territory around Qing Shui Town. But Gong Gong turned it all down.In the dog days of Summer, the Black Emperor issued an official proclamation to exterminate the Sheng Nong Resistance Army led by Gong Gong, sending soldiers North to battle.Zhuan Xu took into consideration that Gong Gong was a member of the Sheng Nong royal family so he didn\u2019t want to send Ying Long and Li Yuan, those old time Xuan Yuan generals, and risk reanimating the bitter antagonism between Xuan Yuan and Sheng Nong. He also didn\u2019t want to send Feng Long and Xian, the Middle Plains new guards, and have them take on the big challenge at hand. He decided to send Ru So as the Great General with Yu Jiang and Ju Mang as the supporting generals. Even if Gong Gong and Xiang Liu were notoriously stubborn and fierce, with those three leading the charge and endless supplies and support behind them, Zhuan Xu was certain Gong Gong would lose in the end.Just as Zhuan Xu was about to issue the decree, Feng Long came to personally beg to be allowed to lead the army, or even go and report to Ru So.Zhuan Xu always treated Feng Long well so explained \u201cFeng Long, it\u2019s not that I think Ru So is better than you, I actually think sending you is even more certain of success. But your ident.i.ty is special, even with the Chi Sui last name but you also carry the bloodline of the Sheng Nong royal family. If I send you to attack Gong Gong, then it means even the Sheng Nong tribe doesn\u2019t agree with what he is doing. We\u2019re going to win this battle no matter what so there is no need for you to be saddled with the anger of the world. I\u2019m trying to protect you which is why I\u2019m not sending you into battle!\u201dFeng Long knew Zhuan Xu\u2019s words were sincere and it made him even more loyal to him. Not just because Zhuan Xu had the vast heart of a true ruler, but because as the ruler he still remained true to just being a man. He valued friends.h.i.+p and loyalty, even when he achieved his goal he never betrayed those who were good to him, especially when it was friends.h.i.+p.Feng Long said \u201cI know what Your Majesty is thinking, but years ago as we planned the goal was always the entire world! I knew this day would come and we are one final step away from our dream. How many men have dreams, and how many can make it come true? Not every man with a dream can lead an army of tens of thousands to help carve out a kingdom. I don\u2019t care about getting a bad name with the world, I know what I am doing and this is the right thing to do. I don\u2019t want to sit out the last battle, so will Your Majesty consent to let me go!\u201dThe scene from so long ago when Feng Long came to see him in Xuan Yuan Castle flashed before Zhuan Xu. People were split thinking of what the Black Emperor\u2019s greatest moment in his rise to power, the Yellow Emperor abdicating or the merging of Xuan Yuan and Gao Xing after the White Emperor named him as successor. In truth it was neither, the greatest moment happened in a simple room with no one around the catalogue it for the history books. It was his conversation with Feng Long, a meeting of the minds, an agreement without a blood oath even. Feng Long came and went in such a hurry, they didn\u2019t even drink wine and instead toasted with water. But in that moment the two men both made the same decision and to this day that decision never wavered.Zhuan Xu ordered \u201cA new proclamation \u2013 Chi Sui Feng Long will be the Great General, Yu Jiang and Xian as your second-in-commands.\u201dFeng Long smiled and bowed low \u201cThank Your Majesty!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cThis war will be very different than the war with Gao Xing years ago, Xiang Liu is not going to be easy to face, be careful!\u201dFeng Long got up with a smile \u201cIf it was an easy battle then I wouldn\u2019t even want to go!\u201dSince Zhuan Xu sent Little Zhu Rong to sway Gong Gong, he would report on every development to the Yellow Emperor, who never seemed interested or said anything. Usually when Zhuan Xu reported on political updates, the Yellow Emperor always said for him to do what he thought best and no need to report, but this time he didn\u2019t say that. Likely he saw this as something he never finished so he couldn\u2019t act like he didn\u2019t care.Xiao Yao was always hanging out with the Yellow Emperor so she heard what was happening clearly. When Zhuan Xu said that he named Feng Long as the Great General to lead the troops to attack Gong Gong\u2019s resistance army, Xiao Yao was brewing tea and at that moment her hand slipped and the scalding water poured on herself.Zhuan Xu rushed forward and put iced water on her burned wrist while asking Miao Pu to bring the burn ointment. Zhuan Xu grumbled \u201cWhy are you so careless? What\u2019s on your mind?\u201dXiao Yao forced a smile \u201cNothing\u201d and moved to continue to brew the tea but Zhuan Xu sent her back to the Yellow Emperor\u2019s side and finished pouring the tea for everyone.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWill Feng Long be setting off soon?\u201d\u201cYes, in the next few days.\u201dXiao Yao sat there silently, Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor\u2019s voices reaching her ears but her heart had flown out the window and beyond\u2026\u2026.The little Hui Chun Clinic, out the back courtyard was a plot of land growing medicinal herbs. Below the herb field was the West River, and following the West River it would lead into Qing Shui, and from Qing Shui it emptied into the East Sea. On the banks of the West River, she saved Jing. To catch the fei fei, she encountered the white condor Furball. She poisoned Furball and got whipped forty times by Xiang Liu as a potential spy. She wanted to poison Xiang Liu but instead poisoned Jing. She wanted to remove the bug from Zhuan Xu and made a deal with Xiang Liu, which turned out to be a Lover\u2019s Bug where the hearts were beating the same and the lives were entwined\u2026\u2026\u201cXiao Yao!\u201d Who knew when the Yellow Emperor left and Zhuan Xu was staring at her \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m remembering Qing Shui Town.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI lived there before, too. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already ordered officials to safely resettle Qing Shui townspeople.\u201dXiao Yao nodded.\u201cAre you thinking about Xiang Liu?\u201dXiao Yao looked down and said nothing.Zhuan Xu said \u201cI know you have some connection with him, and truthfully I\u2019m rather admiring of his ability and loyalty. I\u2019m even envious of Gong Gong\u2019s fierce and unbending connection with him, but the Sheng Nong Kingdom is a thing of the past\u2026\u2026\u2026.I have to eliminate them!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Xiao Yao was fully aware that Zhuan Xu did everything he could already to have them safely submit. The Xuan Yuan Kingdom had to fight this war, and for the Sheng Nong resistance army this would be a form of release. Zhuan Xu is doing nothing wrong, as the ruler of a kingdom he had to snuff out the final pocket of resistance, but Gong Gong and Xiang Liu were also not wrong in sticking with their loyalty and beliefs.Zhuan Xu sighed \u201cNo matter my admiration for Xiang Liu, we stand on opposite sides so I hope you don\u2019t have any further ties with him.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know!\u201d It was because it was so clear since the very beginning, that\u2019s why Xiang Liu kept reminding her, and she kept reminding herself, that she and Xiang Liu could never be friends.Feng Long came to see Xiao Yao at Xiao Yue Peak right before he set off to war.The last time they saw each other was four years ago when Feng Long came with Xing Yue and Chang, and since then Xiao Yao hadn\u2019t seen him or asked about what happened to Xing Yue. In Xiao Yao\u2019s mind, these people appeared to have vanished for the last few years.Xiao Yao took Feng Long for a walk in the forest so as to not disturb the Yellow Emperor\u2019s rest. Feng Long was silent on the walk and Xiao Yao thought about him leading an army to surround Gong Gong and Xiang Liu so she wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk either. The two wordlessly walked all the way to the top of the mountain.Xiao Yao saw the peaks of Zhi Jin Summit and the Palace ringed with clouds, which reminded her of standing at this spot with Xing Yue before she was marrying Jing. Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes misted over thinking of Jing.Feng Long pointed to Left Ear \u201cWas he the one who saved you?\u201d Left Ear followed them the entire walk and was now perched on a tree staring intently at Feng Long.\u201cYes, he saved me.\u201d\u201cThank heavens he was there, otherwise I would have made a grave and irreversible error.\u201dXiao Yao stared silently at Feng Long who said \u201cBack then I really did plan on helping my sister kill you. The tens of a.s.sa.s.sins that he killed were all my best guards sent to kill you.\u201dLeft Ear interjected \u201cI didn\u2019t kill them all, Xiao Yao killed them with me.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cNo wonder! I was wondering with their powers there would be no reason they would all lose just to one person.\u201dLeft Ear said nothing else so Feng Long turned to Xiao Yao \u201cYou knew that I was trying to kill you, right?\u201dSince Feng Long was so candid then Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to deny it \u201cI overheard your conversation with Xing Yue, you two were so agitated and not careful enough.\u201dFeng Long asked \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell His Majesty?\u201d\u201cBack then I greatly insulted you and the entire Chi Sui clan before a who\u2019s who of the vast wilderness. You let it go and that was you being forgiving, but I still owed you so today let\u2019s consider it truly even.\u201d\u201cAre you angry? Look down on me?\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cSince childhood you lived carefree, with the only frustration that people around you didn\u2019t understand or accept your grand dreams and ambitions. But Xing Yue grew up in a nightmare childhood, when a girl dreams about getting a new outfit she dreams about not getting killed. Some lines one can\u2019t cross, but once one does it then it must be seen through to the end! At that time you could only choose to help Xing Yue, if you cast her aside for yourself and Chi Sui clan then I would look down upon you.\u201dFeng Long glanced at Xiao Yao before laughing loudly \u201cI, Chi Sui Feng Long, only proposed to one woman in my entire life, who knew she would run off. But now I don\u2019t regret asking her to marry me, and I don\u2019t regret the Chi Sui clan using the most lavish wedding ceremony to marry her. She\u2019s worth it! It\u2019s only a regret that she was so close to being my wife and that didn\u2019t happen.\u201dXiao Yao smiled and shook her head \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so close, it was still missing an entire heart. One day when you see a woman as more important to you than winning a war, then you will know what I mean.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cI asked His Majesty to let me lead the army this time not for higher position or more riches, I\u2019m doing this only for Xing Yue. His Majesty didn\u2019t take away her Empress position or lock her up, but he has completely and utterly ignored her. A knife slowly cutting flesh is even more painful, and without His Majesty\u2019s respect then the women on Zhi Jin Summit all look down on Xing Yue. In three years she\u2019s aged hundreds of years. I want to win this big war and when His Majesty asks me what great reward I want, I will want nothing other than to ask that he forgives Xing Yue this once.\u201d Feng Long bowed low to Xiao Yao \u201cWhen the time comes, please speak up for Xing Yue. I promise to have someone watching over her all the time, she will never do this again. And after these past three years, she will never have the guts to do it again either!\u201dXiao Yao sighed loudly \u201cYou guys think His Majesty does whatever I ask but that\u2019s only because I know him too well and never ask for something he won\u2019t agree to. Like before when he attacked Gao Xing, and now when he\u2019s going to attack\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Yao stopped herself before continuing \u201cI\u2019m well aware that even if I ask him not to attack he will not agree.\u201d That\u2019s why this time, unlike when he attacked Gao Xing and she was angry at him, now she could only silently and despondently look on as Zhuan Xu sent an army to attack Gong Gong and Xiang Liu\u2019s resistance army.Feng Long dropped to his knees with a loud thud and Xiao Yao frantically tried to get him to rise since the head of the Four Great Clans did not need to kneel before an Emperor \u201cFeng Long, get up! Quickly get up!\u201dFeng Long had strong powers and intended to kneel so Xiao Yao could not pull him up, so she had no choice but to kneel down as well to face him because she could not accept such a prostrating gesture from him.Feng Long looked inconsolable and Xiao Yao had never seen the confident arrogant Feng Long show this side before. Feng Long said \u201cXing Yue and I are twins and sometimes I think that if she was born first and taken to Chi Sui, and I stayed at Xuan Yuan Castle, how would she turn out? Perhaps she wouldn\u2019t be as determined or she may not have married His Majesty. Maybe she would be very happy now. Xiao Yao, I beg of you! I beg you please!\u201d Feng Long kept bowing his head repeatedly on the ground to Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao said \u201cHis Majesty can be very stubborn as well and on this matter I don\u2019t know if he will change his mind. But I promise that I will plead for Xing Yue when the time comes.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cI pray my success in war and your pleading will help Xing Yue in the end.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cCan we stop kneeling now, if anyone saw us then I would be in big trouble!\u201dFeng Long took a deep breath and seemed to regain his usual demeanor, he stood up with a laugh \u201cHow come I feel like we\u2019re finis.h.i.+ng what we didn\u2019t finish at the wedding ceremony?\u201dXiao Yao slapped Feng Long hard on the shoulder like a buddy \u201cStop dreaming and go fight your battle!\u201dYears ago when Xiao Yao lived at Little Zhu Rong\u2019s residence, her behavior and gestures were very tomboyish and sometimes Feng Long thought she was a guy dressing like a girl. Later it was either she became more feminine or they drifted apart, but he didn\u2019t have that impression anymore. Now that mood came back and it felt like old times so he said with a laugh \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wish me luck as I head to war?\u201dIf she wished Feng Long luck, then where was she putting Xiang Liu? Xiao Yao grew silent and then shook her head \u201cThis is you men stuff and doesn\u2019t involve me. I can\u2019t stop you so I won\u2019t say anything about it.\u201dFeng Long chuckled before bidding farewell \u201cFine! Then I\u2019m off now! Let\u2019s have a drink when I return victorious!\u201dXiao Yao gestured farewell back and watched as Feng Long flew off towards the direction of the army encampment.Tomorrow Feng Long would depart with a great army and Xiao Yao kept reminding herself over and over again \u2013 It had nothing to do with her! But why did it still hurt so much!Zhuan Xu told Feng Long that this war was a must win for Xuan Yuan, but didn\u2019t need to be rushed. Start with small skirmishes to determine the tactics of the opponent, but no matter what don\u2019t get lured into the mountains by Gong Gong. The resistance army was based in the mountains and once lured inside they would have the full advantage. That\u2019s why the Yellow Emperor sent forces many times in the past and all were defeated.An army base needed supplies and provisions and the reason Gong Gong picked Qing Shui town was because it was aligned with Gao Xing and next to the East Sea for the water route. Even if the Yellow Emperor closed off all land routes for the provision of supplies, Gong Gong could still get supplied through Gao Xing channels or the water route. Back then Gao Xing was happy to have the resistance army be a thorn in the side of Xuan Yuan and secretly sent provisions, and even some powerful families secretly were helping Gong Gong. But now things were different, the entire vast wilderness was under the rule of Xuan Yuan and the kingdom army now had provisions and even the forces from all the major families with various powers.Zhuan Xu wanted Feng Long to surround the resistance army and slowly choke off all its supply routes until it starved to the point of being easy to take down.Feng Long set off to war and implemented Zhuan Xu\u2019s battle strategy perfectly, battling the resistance forces until it retreated into the deep mountains. After a year of being surrounded, Gong Gong\u2019s army didn\u2019t act cowed and instead would sneak attack Feng Long\u2019s army at night and never direct combat during the day. A little fire here, some poison there, soon Feng Long\u2019s army was so nervous every night and afraid to sleep soundly.During the war with Gao Xing, Feng Long was patient because he knew what he wanted. Even if he lost battles to Ru So he was certain that digging end then he\u2019ll win the eventual victory. But this time his goal wasn\u2019t personal valor or sense of achievement, it was to help his little sister. He could battle for ten to twenty years but Xing Yue couldn\u2019t wait that long!Before setting off Feng Long went to see Xing Yue to tell her to be patient no matter what. But Xing Yue\u2019s att.i.tude was cold and she even walked out on him, completely dismissing what Feng Long said. He was afraid that she would have a breakdown, or even worse throw all caution to the end and do something totally insane.Due to worry over Xing Yue, when Feng Long got a secret report that Gong Gong\u2019s army was spotted, he decided to attack and fell into Xiang Liu\u2019s trap and suffered a major defeat.Zhuan Xu was furious and perplexed, Feng Long may be brash but he wasn\u2019t rash and clueless, and he never would force a victory just for the reward. Even when he lost big to Ru So and was forced to retreat, Feng Long did so willingly to preserve the bigger picture.Because Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t figure out why Feng Long was acting out of sorts, it made him even angrier and he decided to switch the general.The Yellow Emperor calmly asked \u201cAre you sure you want to change the general in the middle of a war?\u201dZhuan Xu wasn\u2019t sure! Doing so was a very tense decision, especially with Feng Long\u2019s lofty background. Some will declare the Black Emperor never trusted having a Middle Plains general leading, others will think that Feng Long wasn\u2019t trustworthy which is why he was being switched out.Zhuan Xu calmed down and said \u201cI trust Feng Long so I won\u2019t switch him out. I\u2019ll go to Qing Shui Town myself to find out why he\u2019s acting this way.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor nodded his head when Xiao Yao suddenly said \u201cI want to go with you!\u201dZhuan Xu wanted to let her but was worried about the risk \u201cThis is different than the war with Gao Xing, it will be dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll always stay by your side. You don\u2019t have confidence in protecting yourself? In that case neither Grandfather or myself will let you go either.\u201dZhuan Xu chuckled \u201cSo sharp tongued, all you can do is argue. Fine, let\u2019s go together!\u201dThree days later the arrangements were complete and Zhuan Xu secretly set off for Qing Shui Town with Xiao Yao.The once bustling Qing Shui Town was a thing of the past, when they pa.s.sed Hui Chun Clinic Zhuan Xu explained \u201cAll the Qing Shui Town residents have been moved to nearby cities and towns and given land and fields. After the war if they wish they will be allowed to return.\u201dXiao Yao silently nodded her head.The entire Qing Shui Town was turned into an army base and Feng Long resided in the largest residence that was owned by the Tu Shan clan. Jing once lived there and now it was harried Feng Long who rushed out to greet them.Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t ask about the war so Feng Long instead joked \u201cThis is the best residence in town and if I don\u2019t live here no one else will dare use it. How did Your Majesty know to find me here?\u201dZhuan Xu explained \u201cI lived a few years in Qing Shui Town so am familiar with here.\u201dFeng Long was taken aback and realized that it must be before he knew Zhuan Xu \u201cWas Your Majesty still in Gao Xing at that time? Were you already preparing for this day even back then?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cHalf and half, back then I didn\u2019t have any faith in getting the throne and wanted to come check out the stubborn folks giving my grandfather a headache. But I also was thinking of what to do should the day arrive that I have to deal with these stubborn folks.\u201dFeng Long was chastened \u201cI let Your Majesty down.\u201dZhuan Xu patted Feng Long on the shoulder \u201cKnowing you for hundreds of years, this one defeat isn\u2019t letting me down, I\u2019m worried more that you\u2019ll be too hard on yourself.\u201dFeng Long said nothing and looked distressed.Feng Long walked them inside, and while Zhuan Xu knew Jing used to live here back then he never visited so had no reaction. Xiao Yao walked into the courtyard that she was very familiar with, the one Jing lived in.During the hottest days of summer an ice crystal wind chime would hang on the corridor, multicolored and in various floral shapes. As the wind pa.s.sed it could carry the cold air and turn the courtyard as cool as spring.Xiao Yao looked around and saw all the same blooming flowers just like it was before, bringing the sensation that a refined gentleman would walk through the door at any moment smiling at her.But\u2026.that wasn\u2019t to be!The sunlight was the same, the view was the same, but the person looking at her with affection was no longer there. Xiao Yao\u2019s heart hurt and her eyes saw black, she was about to collapse when Zhuan Xu grabbed her \u201cXiao Yao!\u201d\u201cNo worries, I almost tripped is all.\u201d Xiao Yao tried to control herself but her breathing was ragged and both Zhuan Xu and Feng Long heard it clearly.Zhuan Xu quietly asked \u201cDid Jing use to live here?\u201dFeng Long remembered now that Jing said he knew Xiao Yao from before. Clearly Xiao Yao also lived in Qing Shui Town so Feng Long quickly said \u201cI\u2019ll have another place prepared.\u201dZhuan Xu was about to say yes when Xiao Yao forced a smile \u201cHere is fine.\u201d At least there was the memory of him here.Feng Long glanced at Zhuan Xu and saw him nod so bowed to leave and let them wash up.After was.h.i.+ng and changing clothes, Zhuan Xu walked outside to see Xiao Yao sitting in a daze on the corridor staring at the flowers.He sat down beside her and asked \u201cIs it the same view still?\u201d\u201cThe flowers are the same but back then there were ice crystal wind chimes hanging on the corridor.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have it hung up now.\u201dXiao Yao glanced over and met Zhuan Xu\u2019s eyes before she darted away \u201cZhuan Xu, you\u2026\u2026you don\u2019t have to do this!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t have to do what?\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s voice was filled with sorrow \u201cI can\u2019t stop you from missing Jing so all I can do is make you as happy as I can. If missing Jing makes you happy then I\u2019ll help you there too.\u201d\u201cWill you be happy doing this?\u201d\u201cMy happiness or sadness doesn\u2019t matter to me, all that matters is that you are beside me.\u201d\u201cWhat if I never forget Jing, will you be like this forever?\u201dZhuan Xu was silent for a moment before saying \u201cXiao Yao, I never asked you to forget Jing! No one can wipe away a memory, and I even know that when I\u2019m old and white haired Jing will still be in your heart as if he just left. I just hope that you will allow me to be by your side going forward.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cZhuan Xu, why do you beggar yourself like this? Why are you so stubborn? You\u2019re the Emperor of the entire vast wilderness!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled at Xiao Yao \u201cBecause you are my Xiao Yao.\u201dHis tone was tender but his expression certain, so Xiao Yao could only once again avert meeting his eyes.Zhuan Xu smoothed her hair \u201cYou rest and I\u2019ll go meet with Feng Long and them. I\u2019m also going to tour the army base so if I\u2019m not back by dinner you eat first.\u201dXiao Yao kept her head lowered so Zhuan Xu stood up and glanced at the courtyard full of flowers, tamping down his sadness before walking out.Xiao Yao sat in the corridor staring at the flowers until it was near sunset.Suddenly the loud screams and roars split the air and Xiao Yao raised her head to see Xiang Liu wearing a white gold mask, wearing a white robe, standing on the back of a white condor in the multi colored dusk clouds. He was holding a silver bow in hand and clearly already shot off an arrow and was c.o.c.king his bow to shoot a second one.\u201cZhuan Xu! Noooooo!\u201d Xiao Yao shrieked and rushed outside, her mind turning blank when she saw Xiang Liu release the second arrow. Her only thought was that nothing could happen to Zhuan Xu!When she arrived at the front door, she saw Zhuan Xu sitting on the ground covered in blood, he was looking skyward as Xiang Liu already flown off.Zhuan Xu projected his voice powerfully \u201cXiang Liu, one day I will take your life!\u201dIn the cry of the departing condor, Xiang Liu was already far away but his arrogant c.o.c.ky laugh reverberated in the sky.Xiao Yao rushed to Zhuan Xu and tightly grabbed him, her body shaking \u201cYou\u2026..you\u2026..\u201d Her teeth was chattering and she couldn\u2019t get her words out.Zhuan Xu grabbed her hand \u201cI\u2019m fine, Feng Long blocked an arrow for me, and the second arrow hit my bodyguard. This blood is all from Feng Long.\u201dThe servants had already carried Feng Long inside and the army doctor was currently treating him.Even though Xiang Liu\u2019s arrow pierced Feng Long, it didn\u2019t hit a critical area so Zhuan Xu wasn\u2019t worried that Feng Long would be fine with the top doctors around.Zhuan Xu said \u201cHundreds of years we\u2019ve collected information on Xiang Liu, but no one knew that his archery skill was this top notch. Feng Long, thank you for taking an arrow for me, otherwise I would be dead today.\u201dFeng Long said \u201cXiang Liu must\u2019ve been waiting nearby for us to return from the army base. The moment of returning to the residence is when the guard is most down, and the best time for an a.s.sa.s.sination. I think Xiang Liu should stop being a general and go be a killer for hire, he would be world reknown doing that. But Your Majesty, you just arrived this afternoon, how could Xiang Liu know in mere hours that you are here. It\u2019s my lapse and I will investigate thoroughly\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Long\u2019s body suddenly stiffened and his skin started to turn black.Xiao Yao screamed \u201cControl his heartbeat!\u201d A powerful guard quickly injected power to stabilize Feng Long.The army doctor was frantic \u201cThe wound has been patched and is non-life threatening. With General\u2019s powers it shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201dXiao Yao fed Feng Long a pill \u201cThe arrow had poison on it.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cXiao Yao, quickly find an antidote.\u201dFeng Long stared at Xiao Yao, she might not be the best doctor in the world but she was undoubtedly the best poison master in the world.Xiao Yao\u2019s hands were cold and her voice shook \u201cXiang Liu came this time to kill, he used his own blood as the poison.\u201d\u201cHis blood?\u201d\u201cXiang Liu\u2019s powers come from ingesting all types of poisons to train. There is no poison in the world that can take him down, so his blood is now the world\u2019s most poisonous thing.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s heart sank and his face turned ashen.Feng Long forced a smile at Xiao Yao \u201cSo even you can\u2019t find an antidote for it?\u201dFor the past hundred years she tried every method to fell Xiang Liu with poison, giving him the hardest to find poisons to take him down. If she could counter his blood poison then Xiang Liu would have already been poisoned by her. Xiao Yao\u2019s face was stark white and her voice shook \u201cI\u2026..I\u2026.I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d She claimed to have top medical skills but who knew the day would come that she would have to watch a friend die.Xiao Yao was mixing an antidote when she saw Feng Long grasped with another wave of pain as his entire body lower half turned black.The poison was spreading so fast it didn\u2019t even give her time to try and concoct an antidote. Xiang Liu truly was stone cold and Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell \u201cI\u2019m useless! I\u2019m so useless!\u201dZhuan Xu had thought it was no big deal but now he was watching Feng Long use his life to exchange for Zhuan Xu\u2019s life. He didn\u2019t know what to say other than to keep apologizing \u201cI\u2019m sorry! Feng Long, I\u2019m sorry!\u201dFeng Long smiled \u201cDon\u2019t be like this, death is inevitable anyways, so I\u2019m merely going earlier than I thought. But I\u2019ve already accomplished everything I wanted to do in life so have no regrets. Other than\u2026..\u201d Feng Long struggled to sit up and kneel before Zhuan Xu.He was pushed back down and Zhuan Xu said \u201cWhatever you want, just say it!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I beg you to please forgive Xing Yue. I was also involved in the plan to kill Xiao Yao in Sheng Nong Mountain and truly have no face to even ask you this. But I truly cannot rest in peace worrying about Xing Yue. She\u2026\u2026she seems smart but is actually a very stupid girl, she is resentful of our father and won\u2019t listen to me now. I\u2026\u2026.\u201d Feng Long\u2019s face was rigid and his voice choppy but he kept staring intently at Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu said nothing, finally understanding why Feng Long wanted to lead this war.Xiao Yao cried \u201cGege, please agree to do what Feng Long is asking!\u201dZhuan Xu grabbed Feng Long\u2019s hand and said with certainty \u201cI promise that Xing Yue will be safe and want for nothing in her entire life, all the consorts in Zhi Jin Palace will honor her as the Empress!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Feng Long eyes reflected his relief as the blackness creeped up into his neck.Zhuan Xu said \u201cOnly two people stuck with me when I was at my lowest point, one was Xiao Yao and the other was you! Xiao Yao and I have our fates entwined but you chose to support me as merely an outsider. You also gave me a man\u2019s conviction and approval, and I\u2019ve never told you how much that meant to me\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu grabbed Feng Long\u2019s hand and his eyes were filled with tears \u201cNo matter how many years pa.s.s, I will always remember us standing in front of the map of the vast wilderness in Xuan Yuan Castle, using a cup of water as a pledge to meet up in Sheng Nong Mountain. I used to think that once you defeated Gong Gong, I would have a cup of water with you. I also thought we would grow old and be able to regale each other with memories of a conquering life to a toast of water. My emperor path is destined to be lonely with no friends, but in my heart I\u2019ve always seen you as a true friend. Even my most beloved Xiao Yao, I was only willing to hand to you!\u201dThe blackness entered Feng Long\u2019s face as he tried to smile but couldn\u2019t move his face anymore. He was trying to say something so Zhuan Xu leaned down to listen.\u201cYour Majesty, actually\u2026..actually it was Jing who came up with the plan to leave Xuan Yuan Mountain and claim Sheng Nong Mountain, it wasn\u2019t my idea. He was always smarter than me, and he saw before I did the talents of Your Majesty. He actually talked me into supporting you. It was also his idea that the Four Great Clans band together and get all the Middle Plains families to support Your Majesty. I\u2026\u2026.I took all the credit from him\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m sorry Your Majesty\u2026\u2026..sorry Jing\u2026\u2026\u201d The darkness reached above Feng Long\u2019s eyes and he stopped breathing with his eyes wide open. It wasn\u2019t clear if his apology was for Zhuan Xu or Jing.Feng Long\u2019s last words were so shocking that it swept away Zhuan Xu\u2019s sadness and he stood there in a daze. He always thought Jing had no choice but to choose him because of Xiao Yao and Feng Long, who knew it was the other way around, Feng Long chose him because of Jing.Xiao Yao closed Feng Long\u2019s eyes and her mind rolled back through all the memories as her tears fell. A hundred years, friends.h.i.+p and conflict, so much happened but it all came down to this moment of watching a friend die leaving only sorrow.The cruel reality of life left no time to mourn as Yu Jiang rushed inside to announce that Xiang Liu just launched a surprise attack on the army base. The attacking forces were broadcasting that Feng Long just died so the Xuan Yuan army was in disarray and shock.Zhuan Xu controlled all his roiling emotions, donned his battle armor and left for the army base.From the moment Xiang Liu\u2019s arrow struck Feng Long, he knew Feng Long was going to die. That\u2019s why he left so quickly to get his army for a timely attack.The Xuan Yuan army was a mess, having lost its leading general. Xian was so intent on getting revenge for Feng Long, she ignored Yu Jiang\u2019s orders and rushed into battle, losing badly to Xiang Liu.Zhuan Xu revealed himself at the critical moment and revived the flagging morale of the Xuan Yuan army, salvaging the defeat but at a great cost, with Xiang Liu taking half the provisions and burning the remaining.When Xiang Liu\u2019s forces withdrew, it was already late into the night.Zhuan Xu gathered the command and issued orders on how to get provisions quickly while sending message to Ru So and Ju Mang to come immediately to Qing Shui Town. Ru So would take over as general and Ju Mang relieve Xian\u2019s post, with Xian being sent to escort Feng Long\u2019s remains back to Chi Sui for burial. Zhuan Xu would personal command the army base until Ru So and Ju Mang arrived.Zhuan Xu finally slowed down to rest after two days and went to have dinner with Xiao Yao. After dinner he laid down still wearing armor since Xiang Liu could come back at any time and said \u201cXiao Yao\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe was cut off by the arrival of Yu Jiang who cut to the chase and immediately said \u201cI couldn\u2019t say this in front of others but yesterday Xiang Liu arrived too fast so there must be a spy beside Your Majesty or a problem with the commanding ranks. Either one is a major concern and needs to be fully investigated, but it will be hard to do with everyone unsettled right now.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019ll handle it, you needn\u2019t think more of it.\u201d\u201cNo wonder Your Majesty didn\u2019t mention it, you already have a plan to address it.\u201d Yu Jiang was relieved and excused himself.After Yu Jiang left Xiao Yao said \u201cI must have lured Xiang Liu here.\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cStill that bug?\u201d\u201cYes, when I arrived my heart hurt when I saw Jing\u2019s old residence. With his brilliance, he must have deduced that you also came.\u201dTears pooled in Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes but she controlled them from falling. Zhuan Xu patted Xiao Yao on the hand \u201cFeng Long\u2019s death is not your fault, don\u2019t blame yourself. I was too careless.\u201dXiao Yao bit her lip and said nothing.If Feng Long hadn\u2019t taken that arrow for Zhuan Xu, it would be Zhuan Xu who was dead now! Thinking of the person turning black being Zhuan Xu, Xiao Yao\u2019s body s.h.i.+vered in fear. She was always aware that Xiang Liu and her stood on opposing sides, but with Feng Long\u2019s death today before her eyes, she finally understood the stark reality \u2013 Xiang Liu is Zhuan Xu\u2019s enemy! He could kill Zhuan Xu!Zhuan Xu said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the bug, Yin said that when the host person dies then the other bug dies or goes back to the host body. When Xiang Liu is dead then your bug will be lifted.\u201dYin\u2019s understanding was true for all bugs, other than the Lover\u2019s Bug. Xiao Yao said \u201cYou get some rest!She closed the night pearl light. Zhuan Xu had a lot on his mind, especially Feng Long\u2019s last words before he died, but with so much going on he was exhausted and quickly fell asleep.In the middle of the night, Xiang Liu did indeed bring soldiers on another sneak attack. Zhuan Xu rushed out of the room and in the hubbub no one noticed Xiao Yao. She used the Face Forming Flower to change her looks to Xian and with Left Ear\u2019s help sneaked out of the residence.Left Ear had his own winged ride and took Xiao Yao through many mountain tops until landed beside a lake.Xiao Yao prodded the bug inside her as she called out in her heart \u2013 Xiang Liu, I want to see you!The lake surface was calm and the moon reflected perfectly on it, with Xiang Liu not appearing for the longest time. Xiao Yao finally couldn\u2019t control herself anymore and loudly screamed \u201cXiang Liu, I know you can feel it! Get the f.u.c.k here to see me!\u201dWhen Xiao Yao\u2019s screams left her throat raw was when the sound of a condor cry reached her. A white condor zoomed down and flew close to the lake surface towards Xiao Yao. Xiang Liu flew off his winged ride and walked on the waves towards Xiao Yao. He was the ephemeral traveler from a faraway land, white hair white robe pristine without being touched by the dirt of the common world, even if each step he took was walking over war and fire and brimstone, nothing could affect him.Xiao Yao raised her silver bow and pulled back an arrow aimed at Xiang Liu \u201cGong Gong lives for his fallen kingdom and stubbornly refuses to surrender, that\u2019s something admirable! But people cannot fight against the inevitable, now Xuan Yuan, Sheng Nong, and Gao Xing have all united, each of the tribes, clans, and families are coexisting peacefully. If you kill Zhuan Xu then the entire vast wilderness will be launched into disarray and war will begin again. Hundreds of thousands of people will be swept up in the devastation. Is this what Gong Gong wants in order to cling to his loyalty, be true to himself at the cost of the peace of the world?\u201dXiang Liu smiled a sardonic grin \u201cIf I kill Zhuan Xu, then it means the vast wilderness isn\u2019t yet united, how can you say we\u2019re going up against the inevitable?\u201d\u201cYou know in your heart whether what I\u2019m saying is right or not!\u201dXiang Liu stared at the silver bow in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and smiled \u201cYou want to use the archery skills I taught you to kill me?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s hands shook but she yelled \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dXiang Liu continued to walk towards Xiao Yao with a laugh \u201cCan\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to get revenge for Chi Sui Feng Long. If you\u2019re that into him then you should have married him. I mean, Jing\u2019s been dead for a few years now\u2026\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao was so furious at his words the silver arrow flew forward with a whoosh.Xiang Liu\u2019s personally taught archery skills along with the priceless one of a kind bow hand forged by the Jin Tian family, and the two were not far from each other, so in a split second the arrow embedded itself in Xiang Liu\u2019s chest. Xiang Liu\u2019s body visibly shook slightly but he continued to walk towards Xiao Yao \u201cDon\u2019t forget I\u2019m called Nine Lives Xiang Liu! If you want to kill me then you need to shoot a few more arrows! And you have to be more accurate! Right here!\u201d Xiang Liu pointed at his heart and then spread his arms wide.\u201cYou think I won\u2019t dare!\u201d Xiao Yao pulled back another arrow.But \u2014\u2014- blood was spreading like a plum blossom on his white robe and Xiao Yao\u2019s heart hurt so she closed her eyes and in that moment her arrow flew forward and missed, grazing his arm. Xiang Liu stopped in his tracks and he smiled at Xiao Yao, it appeared to be mocking but was in truth hiding his joy.Xiao Yao wanted to pull another arrow but her heart was jumbled and she couldn\u2019t do it anymore. She finally put her bow down, all the energy from Feng Long\u2019s death dissipated and Xiao Yao turned to Left Ear \u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201dXiang Liu said to Left Ear \u201cStand to the side. If I want to kill her, there\u2019s nothing even ten of you here can do!\u201dBy now Left Ear knew that Xiang Liu was Bei, and Left Ear couldn\u2019t understand what was happening before his eyes right now. He silently stepped aside.Xiao Yao stepped onto the waves and walked towards Xiang Liu \u201cWhat are you going to do now? Kill me and bet with the heavens whether the Lover\u2019s Bug legend is true or not?\u201dXiao Yao walked right up to Xiang Liu and looked up at him \u201cI\u2019m sad and angry, that\u2019s all true, but in the end I still can\u2019t kill you to avenge Feng Long. But you listen to me \u2013 if you try anything against Zhuan Xu, I will go a.s.sa.s.sinate Gong Gong! My archery skills were taught by you, you know what you taught me was all about killing. My poisons, you\u2019ve sampled it all and even if it\u2019s useless against you but it\u2019ll kill Gong Gong easily!\u201dIt appeared that she triggered Xiang Liu\u2019s real anger and a red demon haze appeared in his eyes as his hand reached out and encircled Xiao Yao\u2019s neck. She wasn\u2019t scared and instead coldly scoffed \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the guts to kill me then stop it with such useless c.r.a.p! The Nine-tailed fox demon was way more creative than you in devising tortures on me, I endured it for thirty years, no way I\u2019m scared of any little wee torture from you.\u201dThe red haze disappeared in Xiang Liu\u2019s eyes and he smiled while stroking the blood vessel on Xiao Yao\u2019s neck \u201cNice! You finally got some sliver of the fierce personality you had when I first met you. Good to see that Zhuan Xu hasn\u2019t turned you into a pampered pet.\u201dXiao Yao shook as a cold s.h.i.+ver went up her spine \u201cLet go!\u201dXiang Liu didn\u2019t let go, and instead pulled Xiao Yao closer to him by her neck \u201cDid you forget the arrow you just shot into me? A blood debt needs a blood payment!\u201d Xiang Liu lowered his head and bit down on Xiao Yao\u2019s neck and began sucking her blood.Xiao Yao tried to push him away but couldn\u2019t break free, while Xiang Liu didn\u2019t suck much and this appeared to be a symbolic punishment of sorts. He lifted his head and pressed it right next to her face and said softly \u201cIt\u2019s been six years since Jing died, right? You still haven\u2019t accepted his death, this trip to Qing Shui Town you didn\u2019t even pay a visit to the last place he was at before he died.\u201dXiao Yao glared in rage at Xiang Liu who acted nonchalant and continued to stroke her neck while smiling down at her and talking like it was a random chat between friends \u201cEven before I knew you, I was already doing business with Tu Shan Jing for hundreds of years. He\u2019s not a vindictive person, but he\u2019s also not a weak fool. In hundreds of years, I\u2019ve never once taken any advantage from him. He can time and again endure Tu Shan Hou only because he treats Tu Shan Hou as a relative. When he banished Tu Shan Hou to Gao Xing, he was well aware that the fracture between them would not end that easily. With Tu Shan Jing\u2019s smarts, he would have been keeping guard against Tu Shan Hou still. He would have a.s.signed someone to track Tu Shan Hou at all times in Gao Xing, and prevent him from growing his power again. That way if Tu Shan Hou still wants to kill Jing, he couldn\u2019t even attempt it.\u201dIn the dark silent night, Xiang Liu\u2019s voice was clear and low like that of a lover \u201cXiao Yao, do you agree with my a.n.a.lysis?\u201dXiao Yao gritted her teeth \u201cWhat are you trying to get at?\u201dXiang Liu laughed and gently said \u201cI just wanted to say that Tu Shan Jing may not be vindictive but he also won\u2019t take anything laying down either. Do you agree?\u201dXiao Yao spit out \u201cWhat if you\u2019re right?\u201dXiang Liu continued \u201cEven under Tu Shan Jing\u2019s a.s.signed surveillance, Tu Shan Hou managed to shake it and sneak to Qing Shui Town and secretly contact Fang Feng Yi Yang to set the trap. But at that time, there were many Tu Shan Jing\u2019s people in Qing Shui Town as well, the guards keeping an eye on Fang Feng Yi Yang and the guards protecting Tu Shan Zhen. You may not be aware but the Tu Shan clan trained guards are top rate, the clan does business so isn\u2019t into battling but in terms of protection the guards are exceptionally skilled. As a killer for hire, I once saw a Tu Shan clan guard in action and after that I made a decision that unless my adopted father\u2019s life was in danger, otherwise I would never attempt to kill any Tu Shan clan leader.\u201dXiao Yao appeared to finally be processing what Xiang Liu was saying and listened raptly, and Xiang Liu slowed down his words \u201cTu Shan Hou\u2019s men not only killed all the guards keeping an eye on Fang Feng Yi Yang, but also the thirty top guards Tu Shan Jing brought along to protect him. The remaining few who survived were rounded up by even more powerful foes so they couldn\u2019t go save Tu Shan Jing. To dispatch so many top notch Tu Shan clan guards, how many even more powerful fighters would that have required? Tu Shan Hou was banished to a life of no money or connections, and under tight surveillance, how could he have commanded so many people to pull this off. If Tu Shan Jing was stupid and careless enough to have let Hou pull this off, then all I can say is that for the past hundreds of years, I was dealing with a totally different Tu Shan Jing.\u201dXiao Yao raised her head to stare at Xiang Liu \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dXiang Liu laughed and said nonchalantly \u201cTu Shan Jing\u2019s death appears like a brotherly feud, but in truth someone else wanted Tu Shan Jing dead. Without this person\u2019s facilitation then Tu Shan Hou could have never ever gotten close to Tu Shan Jing.\u201dXiao Yao grabbed Xiang Liu\u2019s wrist but her grip was so tight her entire body shook. She stared unblinking at Xiang Liu, with thrumming intensity in her eyes so strong it appeared that she was on the verge of lunging forward to kill Xiang Liu.Xiang Liu continued to act like nothing was going on, his voice gentle but coldly firm \u201cEven if who that person is remains unknown, but a reason to kill Tu Shan Jing boils down to conflict over position or personal vendetta. But it\u2019s not easy to control so many top fighters to take down the Tu Shan clan trained guards. If you carefully a.n.a.lyze it, it\u2019s not hard to find the truth.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s body went slack and she almost toppled over. Xiang Liu reached out to grab her but she screeched \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d before collapsing on the lake surface.Xiang Liu sat down across from Xiao Yao staring intently at her. Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes reflect her desolation in processing all this \u201cIf you\u2019ve known this all along, why did you tell me just now?\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cThere was no war before, what benefit to me if I told you all this?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart shook \u201cIs it only Gong Gong, your great savior and benefactor, that matters to you? And everyone else is but a chess piece to you! Other than a.s.sessing what use that person has for you, nothing else matters? Before when people called you cold and calculating, I always thought\u2026\u2026. Now, I really agree!\u201dXiang Liu smiled and shook his head at Xiao Yao, like staring at a mentally slow child \u201cI\u2019ve always been a cold-blooded monster. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m heartless now, it\u2019s that you\u2019re an idiot for thinking otherwise!\u201dXiao Yao stood up and looked down at Xiang Liu \u201cGeneral Xiang Liu, if you want to use me to cause internal strife then you\u2019re sorely going to be disappointed.\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cNo matter my purpose, all I said was the truth.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t forgive anyone who harmed Jing, but I also won\u2019t do as you wish. Like you said, you never took any advantage of Jing, and now you won\u2019t do the same to his wife!\u201dXiao Yao turned to leave when Xiang Liu called out \u201cWait! I gave you useful info, aren\u2019t you going to pay a price?\u201dXiao Yao coldly said \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cYour blood! The war will only get more intense, making some healing pills to keep handy isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201dXiao Yao furiously scoffed \u201cHow much do you want?\u201dXiang Liu had a smile on his face but his words were stone cold \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not going to end up dead, then as much as you can give!\u201d He moved his hands and the water before him churned into the shape of an urn, so big it could fill all the blood coursing through Xiao Yao.\u201cYou can have it!\u201d Xiao Yao used her silver bow to slice her right wrist viciously, with the blood spilling forth. She said through tears \u201cThis isn\u2019t for the information you gave tonight, it\u2019s for everything you\u2019ve done for me that I owe you!\u201dXiao Yao stood next to the urn and watched the blood pouring from her wrists but all she saw was scenes from the past \u2013 him and her on the ocean watching the moon rise, when he took her strolling underwater, when he put his hand on hers to teach her archery, when he took her to eat and gamble, when he ate her poisons like the most delicious delicacies, how he spent thirty-seven years in cold dark water keeping her company\u2026\u2026..all of the warmth of those memories were now splashed with the cold of her blood. Xiao Yao felt cold, so cold she was s.h.i.+vering, so cold but she didn\u2019t know if it was from blood loss or the devastating sadness that was turning her heart cold.As the blood filled up the urn, Xiao Yao\u2019s face turned paler and paler, her body also began to sway, but Xiang Liu only coldly looked on with the same smile on his face, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to turn even Xiao Yao herself into a healing pill but for their lives being connected.Xiao Yao saw black before her eyes and toppled forward, nearly into the urn. Left Ear rushed forward to catch her and was about to staunch her blood flow when Xiao Yao pushed him away weakly \u201cDon\u2019t get involved\u2026\u2026.this\u2026\u2026\u2026this is between him and me!\u201dXiao Yao collapsed on the edge of the urn as her blood continued to flow into it. Left Ear said \u201cNo matter what she owes you, this blood is more than enough payment!\u201dXiang Liu coldly smiled back \u201cShe\u2019s not dead yet!\u201dXiao Yao forced a devastated smile and gritted her teeth before taking her bow to slice open her other wrist so the blood could flow faster. Both her hands were spilling blood into the urn and Xiao Yao had no strength to open her eyes anymore so all she could was hear the sound of blood flowing.After a moment Xiang Liu said quietly \u201cYou can take her back now.\u201dXiao Yao lifted her head to stare at Xiang Liu \u201cYou should take as much as you can tonight. After tonight, you and I are strangers \u2013 for this life and this lifetime, I never ever want to see you again!\u201dBecause of the blood loss, Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t even see anymore so she didn\u2019t get to see Xiang Liu\u2019s expression, all she heard was him say again \u201cTake her home now!\u201dXiao Yao fainted dead away, and the tears she was struggling to hold in finally fell from her eyes and splashed down her cheeks into the urn, causing a ripple.Xiang Liu silently stared at the blood in the urn as the ripples spread out.Left Ear kneeled down and bowed silently to Xiang Liu before taking Xiao Yao away.Xiang Liu didn\u2019t move or say a word, only staring at the urn with the same plastered smile on his face. He could see clearly the glistening blood inside, beautiful in its power. He stretched his palms forward and conjured up power, a blue green light glowed around him like stars and the urn gradually got smaller and smaller until it became a blood red jewel the size of a pigeon\u2019s egg. Xiang Liu held it in his hand, and turning the blood into a jewel appeared to have sapped Xiang Liu of his power and his face was pale and his hands shook. He closed his eyes and pursed his lips, and after some time he was able to make a call that only the water tribes could hear.After some time, a ripple appeared in the water\u2019s surface and a merman rode the waves up to Xiang Liu. He stopped before Xiang Liu and bowed respectfully.Xiang Liu handed the red blood jewel to the merman who carefully received it and placed it into a blue sh.e.l.l that was custom made by the Jin Tian family for this jewel. Xiang Liu spoke to the merman in the mer language, and the merman listened to Xiang Liu\u2019s instructions before nodding and bowing to Xiang Liu. He turned and rode the waves towards the direction of the ocean.Xiang Liu watched the merman until he disappeared from view. He then lowered his eyes and looked at the arrow protruding from his chest. He touched it lightly with his hands before taking a deep breath and pulling it out of his chest with one move. As the blood gushed out of the wound, Xiang Liu seemed exhausted and finally just collapsed on the lake surface. He looked up at the sky as the smile was slowly wiped away.The black clouds covered the bright moon so all that shone in Xiang Liu\u2019s eyes were \u2013 a darkness without light, a darkness without end, a darkness of eternal loneliness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Miao Pu fed her lots of elixirs and potions but Xiao Yao still slept through the entire night. Thankfully Zhuan Xu was preoccupied at the army base and didn\u2019t return until the evening of the next night. By then Xiao Yao was awake and after putting on makeup, and with Zhuan Xu rus.h.i.+ng to and fro, he didn\u2019t notice anything was off about Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao kept drinking the elixirs like water, but she was still so weakened that the healing couldn\u2019t happen overnight. She was tired and sleepy all day, and would often sit in the corridor leaning against the bannister staring in a daze at the flowers. Zhuan Xu thought she was missing Jing so didn\u2019t make much of it, only ordering Miao Pu and Left Ear to spend more time with her and help cheer her up.After a few days rest Xiao Yao was finally back to normal, and by then Ju Mang and Ru So arrived at the army base with the backup provisions. Zhuan Xu provided explicit instructions before taking Xiao Yao back to Sheng Nong Mountain.Feng Long was the Chi Sui clan leader, and also the son of Sheng Nong n.o.bility Little Zhu Rong. His death left a huge burden for Zhuan Xu to handle so he immediately met with the Yellow Emperor to discuss the matter.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cSome things are both a curse and a blessing, if you handle this well it can be both. Feng Long\u2019s unexpected death, aside from your personal sadness, may not be a bad thing for the future of the kingdom.\u201dZhuan Xu paused to think about it and understood what the Yellow Emperor meant. Gong Gong was the Sheng Nong kingdom general and still had strong ties with many Middle Plains families. If it was d\u00e9tente then no one would need to pick sides, but now that it was the final war then many Middle Plains families might feel torn on who to support. But with Feng Long\u2019s death at the hand of Gong Gong\u2019s subordinate, the Chi Sui clan and the Sheng Nong tribe would never ever forgive Gong Gong. Now all the Middle Plains families would stand behind them as well. So with Feng Long\u2019s death, it actually severed whatever the remaining ties between Gong Gong and the Middle Plains completely.Zhuan Xu bowed to the Yellow Emperor \u201cThank Grandfather for your wisdom, I know what to do now.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cIt\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t know what to do, it\u2019s just that Feng Long\u2019s death really affected you. It\u2019s clear you really saw him as a friend.\u201dZhuan Xu remembered Feng Long\u2019s last words and grew silent.The Yellow Emperor added \u201cIf Feng Long was alive then Xing Yue doesn\u2019t matter, you can do what you want with her and I wouldn\u2019t care. But now that Feng Long is dead, you have to treat her well. Later when you go back to Zhi Jin Palace, pay her a visit!\u201d\u201cFeng Long said before he died that he has nothing left behind he would miss, other than being worried about Xing Yue. I already promised him that I would give Xing Yue a lifetime of peace and have all the consorts in the Palace respect her as the Empress.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor was taken aback and sighed again \u201cFeng Long, that child really is so loyal and caring. No wonder he insisted on going to war because it was all for Xing Yue.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIt looks like Xiang Liu killed Feng Long but in truth he was killed by Xing Yue! If it wasn\u2019t for Feng Long I would\u2026\u2026\u2026Sheng Nong Xing Yue!\u201d All the bottled up rage from Feng Long\u2019s death came bubbling up and his hands clenched into fists before he smashed the cups on the table.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cAnd you weren\u2019t at fault? Why did Xing Yue want to kill Xiao Yao in the first place? If she didn\u2019t try to kill Xiao Yao, why would Feng Long be forced to put himself in harm\u2019s way? When you were small I gave you the choice and you chose to forsake love for the greater good of the world! This whole time you\u2019ve never disappointed me, but on this matter with Xiao Yao you have greatly disappointed me!\u201dSince the Yellow Emperor abdicated the throne to Zhuan Xu, he was always warm towards him so this was the first time the Yellow Emperor spoke harshly.Zhuan Xu stared at his grandfather and then said \u201cI know, I did behave irresponsibly for my own selfish reason. Since my dad died and my mom committed suicide, I\u2019ve strictly controlled myself, without a day or even a second of letting myself do as I want. In my entire life and lifetime, Xiao Yao is the only thing I have selfishly asked for. Grandfather \u2013 please agree to it!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor looked down, how could he not know how Zhuan Xu felt. His expression warmed \u201cIf Feng Long\u2019s death isn\u2019t properly handled it could be a huge mess. Hurry back to Zhi Jin Peak now to take care of it. Always remember that you are the ruler of the entire world, you need to put the interests of the entire world first always.\u201dZhuan Xu silently bowed to the Yellow Emperor and left.As Zhuan Xu pa.s.sed by the phoenix tree forest, he stared at the swing and wondered what Xiao Yao was thinking.Miao Pu ran over and bowed \u201cMiss asks Your Majesty to go see her before you leave, she has something to say to you.\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and hurried to Xiao Yao\u2019s room. She picked up a gla.s.s of wine and handed one to Zhuan Xu before pouring it on the ground as a toast for Feng Long.Xiao Yao then said \u201cBefore Feng Long went to war, he asked me a favor that I want to help with now, especially since I couldn\u2019t save him.\u201dZhuan Xu furrowed his brow and said impatiently \u201cIf this is about Xing Yue then I\u2019ve already promised Feng Long.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cIt\u2019s what I thought, you may have promised Feng Long but in your heart you cannot forgive Xing Yue. And with Feng Long\u2019s death, you\u2019ll only become more and more disgusted with her. Even if you keep your promise, women are very sensitive and Xing Yue especially so, she will be able to sense how you really feel about her.\u201dZhuan Xu said coldly \u201cI\u2019ll do what needs to be done with her.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cActually, Xing Yue and I are somewhat similar. We are both kids who had to carry the burden of our parents. I was left by my mom at Jade Mountain, she was left by her dad at Xuan Yuan Castle. The unhappiness of our childhood left our hearts cold and hard, and when necessary we can be heartless and deadly women. Xing Yue relies on her family but cannot trust them completely, the men around her from her dad, brother, grandfather\u2026..they all have even more important obligations, so she can only rely on herself. So she is nervous, suspicious, stubborn, heartless. I don\u2019t ask that you stop hating her but I hope that each time you see her you will pity her a bit, in the end she wasn\u2019t born this way.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cXiao Yao, she is nothing like you! Perhaps you both have cold hearts but you treasure every bit of happiness after the hards.h.i.+p you went through. Whether it\u2019s Master, Ah Nian, Lao Mu, Miao Pu, Left Ear, no matter what they give you, you treasure it and feel grateful. With Xing Yue, her childhood hards.h.i.+p made her greedy, she can\u2019t stop collecting more, no matter what people give her if one doesn\u2019t accede to her wishes then she will toss it all out and feel jilted. Little Zhu Rong and Feng Long did a lot for her. As for me, I gave her the position and power as Empress. She knows it\u2019s a deal with me yet she still wants me to treat her like I treat you. She\u2019s not the only one in this world she suffered!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2019m saying this to you today not only for Xing Yue, but also for yourself, to treat her well.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know what to do.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, you hurry back and I won\u2019t walk you out.\u201dAfter Zhuan Xu left, Xiao Yao sat there silently in a daze, and waved Miao Pu off from a.s.sisting her.Xiao Yao used the wine on her fingers to write names on the table of everyone who could have a grudge with the Tu Shan clan: The Fang Feng family, the Sheng Nong tribe, the Chi Sui clan, the Gui Fang clan, Yu Jiang\u2026..Xiao Yao even wrote Xiang Liu\u2019s name down.Xiao Yao pondered all the possibilities but most were wiped away as not having a good reason to kill Jing. Her hand paused over Xiang Liu\u2019s name.Xiang Liu \u2013 there was a chance that the thief was screaming thief to deflect attention. Killing Jing might not be useful to Xiang Liu directly, but could lead to countless trouble for Zhuan Xu which is good for Gong Gong. And telling Xiao Yao now, she could kill countless powerful people to avenge Jing, which would also be good in causing chaos for Zhuan Xu.Xiao Yao used her finger to write Xiang Liu\u2019s name over and over \u2013 is it you? Is it really you?Miao Pu glanced at the names and asked \u201cMiss, why are you writing all these names down?\u201dXiao Yao smiled and wiped all the names away. Miao Pu shuddered because Xiao Yao\u2019s expression was just like His Majesty\u2019s expression when he ordered Xiao Xiao to kill \u2013 a brief glance and death was to follow.\u201cLeft Ear\u201d Xiao Yao called. She sent him to attempt a.s.sa.s.sinations on her various suspects, not to kill them but to see how quickly they could gather top guards for protection.Miao Pu looked worried and ran after Left Ear \u201cHey, you wait up. Let me prepare things for you. Remember, Miss doesn\u2019t want you to kill anyone so don\u2019t get too close. Just make some noise and let them sense danger.\u201d After some time Miao Pu came back in looking hurt.Xiao Yao laughed \u201cDon\u2019t be worried, Left Ear is smarter and stronger than you think.\u201dMiao Pu said angrily \u201cI\u2019m not worried about him! Who would worry about that stupid brute of a guy with no manners!\u201dXiao Yao shook her head with a wry smile \u2013 woman, thy other name is not saying what you really feel.After half a year of investigating, all the names had been crossed off Xiao Yao\u2019s list, leaving only Xiang Liu. Xiao Yao thought day and night, and kept writing his name over and over on the table. Sometimes she would stare at his name in a daze, asking over and over \u201cdid you do it?\u201dMiao Pu was so worried about Xiao Yao. Sometimes she was like a child abandoned by parents, confused and devastated, other times she was like the sharpest sword without a sheath, coldly cutting anyone down. If it was usual times then His Majesty would sense something was off about Xiao Yao, but with Feng Long\u2019s death he was so busy that all his visits were either short or discussing matters with the Yellow Emperor.Xiao Xiao asked Miao Pu about Xiao Yao but Miao Pu didn\u2019t dare tell the truth \u2013 her master was only Xiao Yao so anything said was betrayal so she said everything was fine as usual.Xiao Yao laid on her pallet writing Xiang Liu over and over again. Miao Pu finally couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and asked \u201cMiss, why do you write this name every day over and over, asking is it you, or is it not you, all the time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking whether he did it or not. And if he did it, how do I confirm it?\u201dMiao Pu understood now and asked \u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t do it?\u201d\u201cIf he didn\u2019t do it, then another powerful person did it. But no one is left, I\u2019ve investigated all suspects, so did I miss someone?\u201d Xiao Yao rapped her own head in frustration.Miao Pu hurriedly stopped her \u201cMiss! Miss!\u201dXiao Yao flopped on the pallet and noticed Left Ear behind Miao Pu, his dark eyes were glinting like a predator and staring intently at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dLeft Ear angrily said \u201cIt\u2019s not Xiang Liu! There is one very powerful person you missed.\u201dXiao Yao blinked in shock, there was someone she couldn\u2019t think of that Left Ear knew \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty.\u201dXiao Yao bolted up and furiously scowled \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting!\u201dLeft Ear looked confused and asked \u201cDid I say anything wrong? His Majesty is not powerful? Then my understanding of power is wrong?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s anger lessened seeing Left Ear like this so she patiently explained \u201cHis Majesty is very powerful, yes, and he can be considered the most powerful person in the entire world. But you\u2019re not understanding what I\u2019m trying to find out, His Majesty has nothing to do\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao glanced at Miao Pu who ran out of the room with her hands over her ears \u201cHis Majesty has no conflict with Jing, and even less profit to gain from his death.\u201dLeft Ear coolly said \u201cThey have conflict with each other.\u201dXiao Yao was so frustrated by now \u201cDo you know them better than me? Do you know what conflict means?\u201d\u201cI do! Conflict is about fighting for the best home, the best land, the best prey.\u201d\u201cFine, so even if conflict is as explained by beasts is true, what is Jing and His Majesty fighting over?\u201d\u201cEvery Spring, aside from fighting over home, land, and prey, male beasts will fight over a female beast both want. The more powerful the beasts, the more violent the fight.\u201dXiao Yao finally understood what Left Ear was getting at and scowled \u201cYou, you\u2026\u2026.\u201dLeft Ear continued \u201cHis Majesty and Jing both want you, and if neither is willing to give up then they can only fight it out.\u201dXiao Yao slapped the pallet hard \u201cComplete nonsense! You get out!\u201dLeft Ear immediately left and Xiao Yao got off the pallet to gulp down some water \u201cNonsense! How can people be like beasts!\u201dXiao Yao tried to put Left Ear\u2019s words aside but gradually it started to eat away at her when she continued investigating Jing\u2019s death. Zhuan Xu would enter her thoughts and Xiao Yao would immediately try to force it away as impossible. But gradually little details she missed started to emerge and take on a whole new meaning.She remembered what Zhuan Xu said to Feng Long on his deathbed, that he only ever entrusted his beloved Xiao Yao to Feng Long.Xiao Yao knew Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t really like Jing, but she thought it was because Jing broke Xiao Yao\u2019s heart before, or Zhuan Xu thought Jing wasn\u2019t good enough for Xiao Yao. At least Zhuan Xu certainly thought Feng Long was much better than Jing, and was more willing for her to marry Feng Long. But know she knew how Zhuan Xu felt about her, many things in the past took on a different meaning, so Xiao Yao went back through her memories and spent the entire night thinking of the past.When her Dad issued a proclamation that Xiao Yao was no longer the Gao Xing Eldest Princess, her Grandfather wanted to give her the Xuan Yuan last name so she could be the Xuan Yuan Princess and had the most ill.u.s.trious last name in the entire world. But Zhuan Xu insisted on giving Xiao Yao the Xi Ling last name, and for this the two argued over it. Back then Xiao Yao picked the Xi Ling last name so she was matched to Jing\u2019s level, which is why she never thought about why Zhuan Xu wouldn\u2019t let her become the Xuan Yuan Princess.On the eve of his marriage to Ah Nian, Zhuan Xu angrily forbade her to go or to congratulate him.Xiao Yao remembered her conversation with Zhuan Xu that night in Qi Qing Garden.Around dusk, Zhuan Xu came by Xiao Yue Peak and saw Xiao Yao lazily sprawled on the pallet. He walked over and sat down \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Heard you\u2019ve been down lately, and not eating much.\u201dZhuan Xu gently asked \u201cMissing Jing again?\u201d\u201cAlso thinking about a lot of things with you. Remember when we went to sea with Feng Long, Yi Yang, Xing Yue, Hou\u2026\u2026and now everyone is gone or dead, and even Jing has left me.\u201dZhuan Xu ordered Miao Pu \u201cGet some wine\u201d, and then poured Xiao Yao a cup. Xiao Yao drank the wine and smiled \u201cI know that in your eyes, Feng Long is much better than Jing. You\u2019ve also looked down on Jing, thinking he doesn\u2019t have grander ambition and only thinks about making money for the Tu Shan clan, and he\u2019s weak and too kind when it comes to dealing with Hou and Yi Yang.\u201dZhuan Xu remembered what Feng Long said to him before death and felt this jolt in his heart, he gulped down the wine and didn\u2019t deny it \u201cI did think that way.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cYou all think that I saved Jing\u2019s life and he just glommed on to me, but in truth it was Jing who saved me.\u201dZhuan Xu stared in disbelief at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao continued \u201cWhen I left Jade Mountain, I was just a kid who knew nothing. Later I encountered all those horrible things, I only glanced over it when telling you and didn\u2019t share all the details. I didn\u2019t forget any of it, it\u2019s just those tens of years of agony and shame are horrible for me to stomach. When I was locked in a cage by the nine-tailed fox, he would beat me and torture me and make me eat all sorts of disgusting things. I lived even worse than an animal. I hated everyone I could possibly hate \u2013 I hated them for abandoning me, for making me live a nightmare. I may have survived in the end but my heart and soul was battered. When I met Jing, he was dirtier than then dirtiest beggar. I saved him in a split second\u2019s kindness and didn\u2019t actual care if he lived or died. But when I discovered all the wounds and bruises on his body, it reminded me of myself so many years ago. I suddenly had a strong desire for him to survive, to keep on living. It was like seeing myself get past it, if Jing could survive. I endured the same torture and shaming, so I know how it can turn a person extreme, cold, suspicious, and how hard it is to be someone who is warm, trusting, and kind. But Jing did it! He showed me, proved to me, that no matter how others have treated us, we can choose to still be kind and good and forgiving. Gege, you might see him as weak and indecisive but you tell me, if one day I betrayed you in the worst way, can you just kill me afterwards?\u201dZhuan Xu said with certainty \u201cYou would never betray me or hurt me!\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t that what Jing thought about Hou? He was Jing\u2019s most trusted beloved older brother. Until Hou did what he did, Jing was like you today, believing completely that Hou would never harm him. I thought Jing would turn cold and suspicious after what Hou did to him, and actions would be decisive and heartless, like both of us have become \u2013 but he didn\u2019t! Gege, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s another kind of strength and courage? It appears different than us, but Jing is using his own method to defeat and overcome his suffering.\u201dZhuan Xu was silent but he agreed, someone like Jing who was so brilliant and strategic on political matters, how could he not know how to get revenge on Hou.Xiao Yao said \u201cJing clearly saw what kind of person I am. He knows I won\u2019t give first, won\u2019t take a chance, so he told me that he will give first, he will take a chance. When he said that, he already did so much for me. But I was touched then yet not believing in him completely. I thought it was possible to do it for a time but impossible to do it forever. People\u2019s hearts change, today\u2019s real is not tomorrow\u2019s reality! But Gege, after what you went through, could you still say that you will give first, you will take a chance? Are you even willing to do that?\u201dZhuan Xu had no reply to that.Xiao Yao added \u201cYou and I are the same type of people \u2013 we cannot do that! Jing kept trying hard to get close to me, but I never fully trusted him, and in fact always was ready to fully retreat at any moment. I never said it but Jing must\u2019ve known it. Gege, maybe in your eyes I\u2019m perfect but in truth it\u2019s very tiring to be with a person like me!\u201dZhuan Xu coolly said \u201cPerhaps he did a lot for you, but all I saw was you spitting up blood because of him and Fang Feng Yi Yang.\u201dXiao Yao sighed \u201cYes, that was Jing\u2019s mistake, but I wasn\u2019t blameless either. I could have handled the matter with him but chose not to do anything, watching from the sidelines and forcing him to prove himself to me. Back then I didn\u2019t know that love can be about one siding giving, staying together requires both sides working at it. We both made mistakes, so we both endured the punishment. It was the first time we both liked someone, so making mistakes is normal. We were simply used by Hou and Yi Yang is all.\u201dZhuan Xu kept trying not to think about what Feng Long said before he died but his words gnawed at him. Right now his frustration burst forth and Zhuan Xu impatiently said \u201cEven if Jing is a million ways perfect, what\u2019s the point of telling me this? No matter what, Jing is dead!\u201dWith a bang the wine cup in Xiao Yao\u2019s hand shattered.Zhuan Xu quickly took her hand and cleaned the shards from her palm while apologizing \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what got into me! I wanted to cheer you up so keep on saying what you want to say, I\u2019ll just listen.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s head was lowered as he carefully bandaged her wound, and it was just a typical wound but Zhuan Xu was so gentle and careful as if Xiao Yao\u2019s palm was half falling off.Xiao Yao stared at Zhuan Xu as images flashed through her mind \u2013 Left Ear talking about male beasts fighting for the female, her telling Zhuan Xu to never let the girl go once he finds the one he loves, Xiang Liu saying with a laugh that Jing\u2019s death appears a brotherly fight on the surface but in truth a very powerful person wanted Jing dead.Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell, one after another like pearls, hitting Zhuan Xu\u2019s hand so he raised his head and worriedly asked \u201cWhat is it? Does it hurt that much?\u201dXiao Yao said nothing, only silently crying.Zhuan Xu frantically asked \u201cXiao Yao, Xiao Yao, where are you hurting? I\u2019ll summon Yin immediately!\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWas it you who sent people to Qing Shui Town to help Tu Shan Hou.\u201dZhuan Xu froze momentarily before returning to normal, but he was holding Xiao Yao\u2019s hand so she felt the jolt. Zhuan Xu asked \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\u201cI want to know the truth. Zhuan Xu, did you send people to help Tu Shan Hou?\u201dZhuan Xu wanted to deny it but his pride wouldn\u2019t allow him to so he said after a pause \u201cIt was me!\u201d\u201cIt was you!\u201d Xiao Yao thought she had experienced every type of pain in the world, but who knew the most painful thing in the world was the person you love taking a knife and carving out your heart. Every part of Xiao Yao hurt, her insides, her bones, her skin, her head, none of the pain she experienced in the past could hold a candle to this. She was in such pain she wanted to die. Xiao Yao closed her eyes, unable to look at Zhuan Xu \u201cGet out!\u201d\u201cXiao Yao\u201d Zhuan Xu tightly held onto her hand but her strength was shocking as she jerked her hand out of his and left a b.l.o.o.d.y gash where he just bandaged.\u201cXiao Yao!\u201d\u201cGet! Out!\u201d Xiao Yao howled and flipped the table, shattering everything on the ground. Her face was ashen and her body teetered, like a leaf about to be consumed by churning waves.\u201cXiao Yao, listen to me explain!\u201d\u201cI want you to get the f.u.c.k out!\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s hand appeared a silver bow and she pulled it back with her still closed. Her tightly bit down on her lips as blood appeared.Zhuan Xu took steps back until he was at the door but he refused to step out. Outside the door was a world without Xiao Yao, and he wasn\u2019t going to go.The Yellow Emperor heard the ruckus and rushed over, one look at the two kids and he knew Xiao Yao learned the truth of Jing\u2019s death. He pulled Zhuan Xu out of the room and used his power to guard against Xiao Yao. He yelled at Zhuan Xu \u201cLeave now! Don\u2019t force Xiao Yao to kill you and kill herself!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor pushed Zhuan Xu to the guards and ordered Xiao Xiao \u201cImmediately take His Majesty back to Zhi Jin Summit.\u201dXiao Xiao shoved Zhuan Xu onto a winged ride and was just taking off when a bloodcurdling scream came from the room. Zhuan Xu looked back and saw Xiao Yao open her eyes with blood dripping from her lips. Her hands were also stained red with blood, while her dark eyes were ice cold, as if everything was dead to her, including herself.No matter how hopeless things seemed, Xiao Yao was always by his side. Every time he looked back he saw her resolute and warm gaze on him. But now she was looking at him with the coldest most heartless expression and Zhuan Xu felt like his entire insides were being ripped to shreds. The pain was so stark he couldn\u2019t even keep his seat on the winged ride and he collapsed on the saddle \u201cGo back! I want to go back!\u201d He wanted to order his winged ride to turn back but Xiao Xiao la.s.soed the winged ride\u2019s neck and forcibly directed it to fly away.\u201cXiao Yao!\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s scream was willed with endless desolation and utter pleading, trying to convey that he would do anything to protect her and give her happiness, but Xiao Yao could hear none of it. Her grip released and a silver arrow landed in the winged ride killing it instantly. Xiao Xiao pulled Zhuan Xu onto her winged ride with her quick reflexes.Another arrow flew forward and landed in Zhuan Xu\u2019s hair top knot, freaking everyone out as screams pierced the air. Zhuan Xu\u2019s hair fanned around him as his stared in shock at Xiao Yao, his power was strong enough to avoid the hit but he had done nothing to evade her arrow. Zhuan Xu suddenly saw the image of his mother when she committed suicide, after she stabbed herself with the sword, her body was in grave pain and could barely stand, but she was smiling as she jumped into his father\u2019s grave. So when love was just that deep, one really would rather die than losing it, and now Zhuan Xu finally understood his mother\u2019s choice.Zhuan Xu tried to shake Xiao Xiao off and faced Xiao Yao\u2019s arrow straight on \u2013 if they couldn\u2019t live together then he would rather they died together!The guards saw Xiao Yao pulling back another arrow and rushed forward to kill her but Zhuan Xu howled \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her! No one dare hurt her! Anyone hurt her will be killed!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor blocked Xiao Yao\u2019s way and grabbed her arrow and said in sorrow \u201cXiao Yao, Zhuan Xu already made one mistake, you can\u2019t make another!\u201dXiao Yao stared at her grandfather as her body swayed \u201cYou knew! You\u2019ve all been lying to me!\u201d Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor were her only blood relatives left, and now both betrayed her!The pain clenched Xiao Yao\u2019s heart, and coupled with her shooting two arrows already, she was completely spent and the bow disappeared in her hand. Her body toppled forward like a log right into the Yellow Emperor\u2019s arms who turned to yell at Zhuan Xu in the sky \u201cYou\u2019re still not leaving? Do you really want to force everyone here to die today!\u201dZhuan Xu painfully closed his eyes as the wind whistled past his ears, as if carrying with it the moans of pain and agony. Everyone experiences gain and loss in a lifetime, and he had never regretted any choice he made until now, this was the first time he wondered \u201cWas I wrong?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor ordered Xiao Yao medicated with calming pills so by the time she woke it was noon the next day.She wanted to sit up but was too weak so fell back against her pillow, the result of her using so much power.Miao Pu a.s.sisted Xiao Yao to sit up and Xiao Yao rubbed her injured hand \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s look of abject pain flashed before her eyes, and it was a look Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t even have dreamed would show up on his face since Zhuan Xu had endured so much already and never broke down like that before. She started to remember yesterday \u201cDid I shoot arrows at Zhuan Xu?Xiao Yao didn\u2019t know if she wanted Miao Pu to tell her that it was all just a bad dream, but Miao Pu\u2019s face was ashen as she kept her head lowered and said nothing.It was Zhuan Xu who killed Jing! And the reason was because of her! Xiao Yao painfully closed her eyes, wanting to sleep and never wake up! Actually, she wished that the person she tried to kill yesterday was herself!Xiao Yao started to laugh loudly and the laughter was more painful to the ears than crying. Miao Pu didn\u2019t know what to do when the Yellow Emperor walked into the room so she quickly retreated outside.Within one night the Yellow Emperor aged another round. He silently stared at Xiao Yao and didn\u2019t know how to talk to her. He had endless plots and vast commanding power, but he didn\u2019t know right now how to comfort Xiao Yao. He finally said \u201cZhuan Xu already committed a grave mistake, but if you kill him now it won\u2019t bring Jing back.\u201dXiao Yao painfully asked \u201cYou both are my closest dearest family, but one killed my husband and the other helped conceal it! What did I do wrong to deserve this?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I tried my best \u2013 Zhuan Xu has always been a brilliant child who knows when to give and when to take, I thought he would understand but I underestimated the depths of his love for you. When Jing died, it was already too late so I prayed that you would never find out the truth.\u201d\u201cSince learning that someone was behind Jing\u2019s death, I kept thinking of how to deal with that person. Killing is too easy, I want to turn that person into my poison guinea pig, to use the most painful deadly methods to torture and torment.\u201d Xiao Yao laughed sorrowfully \u201cBut that person is Zhuan Xu, the person I want to device a million tortures on turned out to be Zhuan Xu!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor pleaded \u201cA dead person cannot be brought back to life, if you kill Zhuan Xu now you will send the world into chaos and what will it bring to you?\u201d\u201cRevenge for Jing!\u201d\u201cWill revenge make you happier?\u201dXiao Yao said decisively \u201cYes, revenge will make me happy!\u201d All she thought about yesterday was killing Zhuan Xu and then she would commit suicide and end it all!\u201cYou know the answer, whether it makes you happy or sad. I want you to think carefully about this, and about who you are? Your mother is Princess Xuan Yuan Ba, who died in battle for her kingdom. You father is Qi Yo, who never gave up on protecting Sheng Nong even to his last breath. Your adopted father is the White Emperor who gave up power for the wellbeing of his people. If for your own selfish reason you send the world into chaos and disarray, then you don\u2019t deserve to be their daughter!\u201dXiao Yao coldly scoffed \u201cThen I don\u2019t deserve to be their daughter and I don\u2019t care! You guys are all great heroes with legacies, willing to shoulder the responsibility of the world, but that is your choice! I just want to be a selfish normal person, find a little corner of the world to live with my own personal happiness and sorrows. Wise and sage Yellow Emperor, if you want to keep me from getting revenge on Zhuan Xu then you best kill me now! For the good of your world you need to be heartless once again!\u201dIt had been thousands of years since anyone had dared speak to him thusly, but the Yellow Emperor knew that nothing more could be said at this time. He shuffled to the door before abruptly turning back \u201cYou don\u2019t need to think of the good of the people but you should consider Jing. You know his personality the best, would he want you to do this!\u201dXiao Yao coldly retorted \u201cYou should say that to Zhuan Xu, what did Jing do wrong that he had to kill Jing!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor sighed and left the room all stooped over.The room fell into silence and Xiao Yao\u2019s tears finally fell on her pillow.Days later, Xiao Yao was all recovered which was when she discovered that all her medicines and pills were gone. All her equipment to make concoctions were also removed, as were the supplies, and even the herb gardens planted in the valley were plucked clean.The guards kept watch over her 24/7, never leaving Xiao Yao\u2019s side or even looking away from her for a second. Miao Pu and Left Ear were also placed under tight surveillance. Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t even leave Xiao Yue Peak, much less sneak into the even more highly fortified Zhi Jin Summit. All she was allowed to go was to the phoenix tree forest. Xiao Yao was effectively locked up by the Yellow Emperor, but she didn\u2019t try to leave or even have an argument with him. Every day she wandered around in a daze, sitting on the swing in the phoenix tree forest for hours on end.The Yellow Emperor tried talking to Xiao Yao every day but she no longer argued back with him, instead only listening silently with no response or reaction. The Yellow Emperor had no idea what Xiao Yao was thinking.When Miao Pu came to clear the table, she saw the meal remained untouched and pleaded \u201cMiss, please eat something!\u201d\u201cMiao Pu, sit down.\u201dMiao Pu nervously sat down when Xiao Yao asked \u201cMiao Pu, do you like Left Ear?\u201dMiao Pu was taken aback and stiffly responded \u201cWhy is Miss asking this?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cLeft Ear\u2019s life before us was very very tough, much worse than you can ever imagine. He only somewhat knows the matters of life so you have to be extra patient with him, and take good care of him. Don\u2019t let him get taken advantage of, he\u2019s really one-track minded so if he gets set on something he will see it through to the end no matter what. You have to look out for him so he doesn\u2019t go astray. Left Ear is actually very simply \u2013 he just wants a home, a spouse, and a simple free life.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s tone was sincere and warm so Miao Pu\u2019s shyness went away \u201cI\u2019m an orphan who was picked by His Majesty to train as a guard because I had the talent. But I\u2019m not like Xiao Xiao jiejie and them, as accomplished and capable. I don\u2019t dare wish for riches and power, all I want is a family. I will take good care of Left Ear, I won\u2019t let anyone take advantage of him!\u201dXiao Yao looked out the window \u201cLeft Ear!\u201dLeft Ear swung inside from the roof and sat down on the window sill as Miao Pu gasped and turned beet red \u201cYou were eavesdropping!\u201d\u201cNot eavesdropping.\u201d Left Ear\u2019s pale face was placid but his ears were pinkish red.Xiao Yao said \u201cYears ago I promised you food to eat, a place to live, and to help you find a wife. Do you like Miao Pu as a wife?\u201dLeft Ear glanced at Miao Pu before nodding his head, still placid but his ears were turning redder and redder.\u201cMiss! You\u2026.you\u2026.\u201d Miao Pu ran out of the room with her hands over her face.Xiao Yao said to Left Ear \u201cMiao Pu is often really bossy but she just doesn\u2019t know how to express her concern and affection for you. I know you don\u2019t explain yourself to others but if she\u2019s going to be your wife then you need to be good to her. Try to explain things to her, even a simple \u201cI\u2019ll be careful\u201d will make her feel better.\u201dLeft Ear mulled it over \u201cA wife is to be good to?\u201d He seemed to understand and nodded at Xiao Yao.Xiao Yao called out the door \u201cMiao Pu, I want some water!\u201dMiao Pu came in bearing bowls of water but kept her head down not looking at Left Ear. Xiao Yao handed a bamboo canister to Left Ear and said to both \u201cI can\u2019t leave Xiao Yue Peak right now so you two need to deliver a letter for me. At the end of an alley in Xuan Yuan Castle is a blacksmith shop with no sign. Inside is a white haired good looking old man blacksmith, you guys hand this letter to him and then do as he instructs, got it?\u201dMiao Pu asked \u201cWhy do we have to deliver the letter together?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s voice was stern \u201cThis is a very important matter, I\u2019m sending you both for my reason because Left Ear can\u2019t do it alone.\u201dMiao Pu hesitated \u201cBut Miss will be alone if we both leave.\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cThere are so many servants here, plus with my Grandfather around there won\u2019t be anyone who mistreats me.\u201dLeft Ear stared at Xiao Yao, clearly not going to do as told, so Xiao Yao said \u201cIf I don\u2019t leave Xiao Yue Peak then no one can do anything to me. Miao Pu, am I right?\u201dMiao Pu nodded to Left Ear \u201cThe Yellow Emperor has restricted the freedom of Miss not just to protect His Majesty but also to protect Miss. A lot of people saw her shoot arrows at His Majesty and some crazy loyal person might do something rash and try to take Miss out.\u201dLeft Ear took the canister and said to Miao Pu \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dMiao Pu asked Xiao Yao \u201cWill the guards let us off the mountain?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cJust tell the truth, you are delivering a letter to a blacksmith in Xuan Yuan Castle. Grandfather will let you go.\u201d Actually, Grandfather would love to send Left Ear far far away.Miao Pu said \u201cMiss, please take care of yourself. We\u2019ll be back as soon as we can.\u201dXiao Yao watched them leave and silently sighed. She had wanted to be their secret matchmaker and watch over them for longer so Miao Pu and Left Ear could take their time to develop, but things were beyond her control and she didn\u2019t have much time left now. Xiao Yao silently wished them well, for Left Ear and Miao Pu to support and take care of each other \u2013 Left Ear and Miao Pu, fare thee well! I wish you what Xiang Liu couldn\u2019t have, what Jing and I couldn\u2019t have, you guys have to be happy forever.The Yellow Emperor had removed all the medicines and herbs from Xiao Yao\u2019s presence but she was one who never made the same mistake twice. After the last a.s.sa.s.sination attempt, she found a way to store medicine that wouldn\u2019t be misplaced. In jewelry, in clothing, in accessories, she carefully prepared it so Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor wouldn\u2019t worry about her, who knew she would be using it now against them.Zhuan Xu had not appeared before Xiao Yao but she was certain he came by Xiao Yue Peak. The Yellow Emperor strictly kept them apart but he didn\u2019t know that children had their own secrets the adults never knew. Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu grew up together, eating and sleeping side by side, so they had their own way of communicating with each other.One a full moon night, Xiao Yao carried white lotus basket and hummed an ancient tune as she strolled to the phoenix tree garden. The guards didn\u2019t try to stop her, only silently following.When Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu arrived on Sheng Nong Mountain, there were no phoenix trees here and it was Zhuan Xu who hand planted each tree on Zhi Jin Summit and Xiao Yue Peak. After a hundred years, the trees had grown into forests and the flowers bloomed red all over the hillside like vibrant hues of morning glory.Xiao Yao strolled in the phoenix tree forest as flower petals fell around her. She would catch some in her hands and place it in the basket and soon the basket was full of red phoenix flowers.The red flowers were even more vivid under the bright moonlight \u2013 if the phoenix flower under the sun was of a brash energetic girl, then under the moonlight she was deep in thought. Xiao Yao stepped heavily like she did as a kid, the leaves crunching loudly under her feet.Xiao Yao stopped when she reached the swing.It hadn\u2019t been used in a while but Zhuan Xu\u2019s power kept the area clean. Xiao Yao sat down on the swing and admired the view while picking phoenix leaves from the basket to suck the honey out.The sweetness of the flower honey spread in her mouth and Xiao Yao remembered her childhood. Zhuan Xu didn\u2019t like eating flower honey and would spend his mornings practicing his powers, but he would always pick flower petals for her at the crack of dawn only because she once said that the flower honey at the moment of sunrise was the sweetest. When she was locked in a cage, every morning when she woke she felt a sweetness in her throat, dreaming that the phoenix flower was so close, that even if her mom and dad didn\u2019t want her anymore her Zhuan Xu gege still wanted her.Zhuan Xu walked under the moonlight and traversed the phoenix flowers towards her.His black robe with gold thread emphasized his refined features and elegant demeanor, like a gentle scholar out on a stroll, a world wanderer sampling the joys of the living. But meeting his eyes would see the power in its depth, the authority of deciding life and death with one word.Xiao Yao felt unsettled, like Zhuan Xu was suddenly unfamiliar to her, or maybe it was that she never looked at him carefully before. All this time Zhuan Xu was Zhuan Xu to her, they laughed when happy, he carried her when she tired, he teased her when she pouted, he was a shoulder for her to lean on when she was in need, he could handle everything when she was in peril.In Xiao Yao\u2019s heart, Zhuan Xu was the closest person to her, so much that she didn\u2019t differentiate between him and her. If he wanted something then she would give her life to help him achieve it. From Five G.o.ds Mountain to Xuan Yuan Mountain, from Xuan Yuan Mountain to Sheng Nong Mountain, whatever she had Zhuan Xu could have it, including her life. She always thought Zhuan Xu treated her the same way, that if she wanted something Zhuan Xu would get it for her, that if she treasured something Zhuan Xu would treasure it too.But it was just her wishful thinking! So was she simply wrong about Zhuan Xu, or had he changed?It was mere days since they last saw each other but it felt like a lifetime. Zhuan Xu tentatively called out \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dXiao Yao smiled \u201cYou know I want to kill you yet you still came alone?\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cIf you weren\u2019t certain I would come, then why wait here?\u201dXiao Yao coolly said \u201cI thought I knew you well, but clearly I don\u2019t anymore.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s eyes reflected his desolation and he asked \u201cWant to swing?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dZhuan Xu lightly pushed Xiao Yao and she raised her head to look at the phoenix flowers above falling.In the quiet forest, a silent young man pushed a silent young woman on a swing, and the same memory played in their minds\u2026\u2026Under the fire red phoenix tree.A swing was going higher and higher. The little girl on the swing called out \u201cGege! Gege! Look at me, you look at me!\u201dThe boy under the swing looked up with his eyes lit up in a smile.Under the fire red phoenix tree, the boy had grown up into a tall strapping young man. The little girl had grown up into a beautiful vivacious young woman. The man looked at the girl as she swung, she looked down at him, the two conversing naturally and casually without a thought to the life and death choice ahead.The hundreds of years had taken away the laughter of their childhood, but it gave them confidence and strength. No matter what they encounter or face, they would battle to the death for a way out.From childhood until now, they had countless different moments and memories, but never a moment like this.The swing of their childhood was like a rainbow, bright and untainted. The swing of adulthood was the sun surrounded by dark ominous clouds, they were each other\u2019s sunlight. And the swing right now was the darkness of the night before a storm, with no light and only unending darkness ahead.Zhuan Xu\u2019s hands got tired but he didn\u2019t want to stop. He knew this was the last time he would swing with Xiao Yao and he didn\u2019t want to stop. Even if it was unending darkness he still wanted to keeping pus.h.i.+ng her on the swing.Xiao Yao placed the basket before him \u201cI don\u2019t know if I hate you, or I hate myself. Likely I hate both! Because I\u2019ve always been certain that even if you make a mistake I would shoulder half the consequences with you.\u201dZhuan Xu took a flower petal and sucked out the honey.Xiao Yao asked \u201cIs it sweet?\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cVery sweet.\u201dXiao Yao ate a flower \u201cWhen Grandmother died, we vowed before my mom, your mom, Auntie Ju Li, we promised them that we would always take care of each other, together and never apart. I did it, but you didn\u2019t! Gege, you didn\u2019t do it!\u201dZhuan Xu ate a flower \u201cI know I didn\u2019t do it, but it\u2019s not because I helped kill Jing. It\u2019s because I was wrong from the very beginning! I should have never used you as a chess piece. I shouldn\u2019t have given you to Jing in order to get the help of the Tu Shan and Chi Sui clans.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cGrandfather keeps trying to lecture me these days about the greater good but I\u2019m not my mom, my heart is very small and can only fit the people I care about, it doesn\u2019t fit the entire world. I used to pretend I cared but that\u2019s only because you cared. But now I hate you, so none of that matters to me at all!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cNone of that needs to matter to you!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThat\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t matter what Grandfather says, I still have to kill you because you killed Jing. Do you understand?\u201dZhuan Xu smiled and patted Xiao Yao\u2019s head \u201cI understand!\u201dXiao Yao handed Zhuan Xu a phoenix flower \u201cAfter I kill you then I will die with you.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cThat\u2019s good, I won\u2019t rest easy leaving you behind. The people who hate Qi Yo, all the women on Zhi Jin Summit, Yu Jiang and those loyal subordinates\u2026\u2026..I don\u2019t feel safe leaving you to face them so I\u2019ll keep you by my side.\u201dXiao Yao ate a flower \u201cI had thought up all the cruelest ways to torture the person who killed Jing, but I won\u2019t use it on you. I thought up this way, it\u2019s sweet and won\u2019t hurt at all.\u201dZhuan Xu agreed \u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d He wanted to push her on the swing but had no strength anymore. He slowly sat down and patted the ground \u201cSit down, otherwise you\u2019ll fall off later and it\u2019ll hurt.\u201dXiao Yao stumbled off the swing and Zhuan Xu pulled her into his arms. She wanted to push him away but had no strength so nestled in his embrace.Xiao Yao\u2019s body had no strength so it was like when they were young, Zhuan Xu tightly held Xiao Yao in his arms. He asked \u201cYou deal with poison all the time, how come the effect is faster on you?\u201d\u201cI took the poison earlier than you, when I was sitting on the swing waiting for you I already poisoned myself. Actually, you shouldn\u2019t have come. You really shouldn\u2019t have come. When I left you the note I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t come\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell.Zhuan Xu wiped away her tears \u201cIf I didn\u2019t come then you planned to die alone under the swing? You want me to see with my own eyes the result of what I did? Xiao Yao, you are so cruel!\u201dXiao Yao laughed \u201cMy Grandfather is the Yellow Emperor, my father is Qi Yo, and my older brother is Zhuan Xu, each of you is one more vicious than the next. How could you expect me to be kind?\u201dZhuan Xu laughed \u201cYou\u2019re right! How could a rabbit come from a cave of wolves!\u201dXiao Yao smiled as her tears continued to fall.Zhuan Xu softly asked \u201cXiao Yao, if Jing killed me, would you punish Jing this way for me?\u201d\u201cJing would never hurt you! He knows how important you are to me. He would rather endure pain himself than to put me in such pain\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s voice got softer and softer.Zhuan Xu held Xiao Yao tightly and kissed her forehead \u201cXiao Yao, I\u2019m sorry! I was wrong! I was wrong!\u201d From childhood until now he did everything and never regretted anything until now.Zhuan Xu\u2019s tears fell and Xiao Yao saw it and smiled \u201cGege, Zhuan Xu\u2026\u2026.I\u2026\u2026..I forgive you! It\u2019s too hard to hate you\u2026\u2026.worse than cutting my own heart to pieces\u2026\u2026I forgive you\u2026\u2026.\u201dZhuan Xu cried \u201cXiao Yao, tell me! If we could do it all over again and I held you close after we reunited on Five G.o.ds Mountain, with no chance for Jing to get close to you, would you have picked me?\u201dXiao Yao was about to pa.s.s out but Zhuan Xu\u2019s words took her back to the very beginning and it was as clear as yesterday \u201cWhen I was locked up in the cage by the nine-tailed fox, all I could think of was you\u2026..all I missed was you\u2026.when you didn\u2019t recognize me, I still used my life to save you\u2026\u2026.back then\u2026\u2026.there was no Jing yet\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yao\u2019s voice trailed off.Zhuan Xu cried out \u201cXiao Yao! Xiao Yao!\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d but he could feel only silence as her breathing ceased.On Cao Yun Peak, they played during the day and slept in each other\u2019s arms at night. They buried and said farewell to their loved ones, they endured the pain together\u2026\u2026\u2026.Xiao Yao said her heart had turned cold into stone, but he remained the most precious treasure that Xiao Yao kept deep in her heart, in the softest most secure place. When Jing said he would give first and trust first to try and win Xiao Yao\u2019s heart, Xiao Yao had already done the same for Zhuan Xu. She didn\u2019t like politics and care about the greater good, but she accompanied him back to Xuan Yuan Mountain and always protected him\u2026..He always thought Jing wasn\u2019t good enough for Xiao Yao, couldn\u2019t treat her right, and only made her sad. But what about himself?Zhuan Xu kissed Xiao Yao as his tears splashed on her face, but she would never embrace him back or comfort him \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here with you.\u201dIf he could do it again, he would put Xiao Yao first, he would consider what she wanted and not what he wanted. But it was too late now.Zhuan Xu held Xiao Yao tightly in his arms with his forehead pressed against her forehead, and slowly closed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t remember where he was until he heard the falcon call and realized that he was in Cheng En Palace on Five G.o.ds Mountain.Before he knew it, he had seen the same view from the window for two hundred years, but every time he woke up he still felt that he ought to be seeing the fire red phoenix tree flower because he should be on Cao Yun Peak on Xuan Yuan Mountain.Zhuan Xu softly sighed, he had been away from his homeland for two hundred years, and the road home was still so long. He didn\u2019t know when he would be able to see the phoenix flower on Cao Yun Peak, and even more unknown was when he would be able to find the wandering girl who loved the same flowers as him. Xiao Yao \u2013 she must be all grown up now!Perhaps his wish to go back to Xuan Yuan Mountain was so great, or he simply missed Xiao Yao too much, but last night he had a very long dream. In his dream, he found Xiao Yao and she accompanied him from Five G.o.ds Mountain to Xuan Yuan Mountain, but he left it behind to go to Sheng Nong Mountain where Xiao Yao helped him win the throne. He even united all of the vast wilderness! But in the process, he seemed to have lost Xiao Yao somehow?????Was it just a nightmare? No wonder he was so tired, and couldn\u2019t remember it clearly.Xiao Xiao came in and bowed \u201cYour Majesty, the Empress has been waiting outside for three days and three nights. The maids finally coaxed her to rest.\u201dZhuan Xu bolted upright in shock \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dZhuan Xu furrowed his brows \u201cI\u2019m His Majesty? When did I become Emperor? And the Empress is?\u201d\u201cFormer Gao Xing Kingdom Princess Gao Xing Yi.\u201dLike a dam bursting, all his memories came flooding back in his mind.On the peach lake, Xiao Yao dressed in green and smiled shyly at him; On Five G.o.ds Mountain, Xiao Yao wore an exquisite robe and smiled at him; In Cao Yun Court, Xiao Yao sat on the swing and peeked at him; In Cui Liang\u2019s residence, Xiao Yao used her body to s.h.i.+eld and protect him; In Zhi Jin Palace, Xiao Yao took his hand and told him to stay alive no matter what; In Yi Province Castle, Xiao Yao pulled back her bow and the two of them were in sync and smiling at each other; On Xiao Yue Peak, Xiao Yao coldly shot the arrow at him; In the phoenix tree forest, Xiao Yao curled in his arms and gradually stopped breathing.Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t figure out whether his head or heart was hurting, he felt this immense uncontrollable pain that he screamed and grabbed his head before falling back on the pallet.Xiao Xiao rushed to a.s.sist Zhuan Xu and yelled out \u201cYin!\u201dYin rushed inside and quickly checked on Zhuan Xu\u2019s vitals. He shook his head and signed to Xiao Xiao who spoke it aloud for Zhuan Xu \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s health is fine, it\u2019s the after effects of the poison causing some memory confusion. After His Majesty is fully recovered the headache will disappear.\u201dZhuan Xu tried to sit up \u201cXiao Yao? Xiao Yao???????\u201dYin was about to sign but stopped at Xiao Xiao shooting him a look. She said \u201cThe Miss is not dead.\u201dZhuan Xu curled over as his body began to shake and noises came from his throat like he was crying and laughing. Yin and Xiao Xiao had never seen him like this before so both kneeled down beside the pallet and kept their head down.After some time Zhuan Xu asked in a hoa.r.s.e voice \u201cWhy am I still alive?\u201dYin signed \u201cThe poison dose was not enough to kill you. With Xiao Yao\u2019s poison skills she would not have made a mistake, so she clearly never intended to kill you. Her poison mixture was unparallel deadly but she once taught me the antidote, plus the amount she gave you was low so if you were found within six hours then you could be saved. First I used the antidote to stop the poison, then the holy water from the Yang valley to flush it out of your body.\u201dZhuan Xu murmured \u201cXiao Yao, you still didn\u2019t have the heart to kill me?\u201d He didn\u2019t know if he was sad or happy and then suddenly asked \u201cIf Xiao Yao didn\u2019t give me a kill dosage, then what about her?\u201d For every phoenix flower he ate, she ate one too, and she started eating when she arrived at the forest earlier than he did.Yin replied \u201cThe Miss dosed herself with poison enough to kill herself.\u201dZhuan Xu rushed out of bed but paused at Yin\u2019s frantic signing \u201cWhat do you mean \u2013 she\u2019s not dead but also not alive?\u201dZhuan Xu turned to Xiao Xiao \u201cWhere is Xiao Yao, I want to see her.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d\u201cI said I want to see her!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe inland sea of the Yang Valley nestled a crystal cave, and inside the cave an all white sea sh.e.l.l floated on the surface. Blood streaked magic chants were written all over the white sea sh.e.l.l and Xiao Yao silently laid within the magical spell. A strong water power was collected to envelope her like a misty blue fog, making her seem ethereal. Zhuan Xu reached out to try and touch her but was afraid of interfering with the magic so reached his hand back but continued to stare at her.Xiao Xiao said \u201cThe Miss gave herself a strong dosage so when we found you both, she was already dead and stopped breathing. But then Yin discovered there was a weak heartbeat in her so we brought both of you here to Yang Valley. Yin knew how to save Your Majesty but not how to revive the Miss, but then the Empress brought over this blood magic covered white sea sh.e.l.l and said to put the Miss inside and it will help. Yin tried it for a few days and discovered it really did help, it continues to maintain the Miss\u2019s weak heartbeat. Yin wanted to find out who created this magic sea sh.e.l.l but the Empress said she found the sea sh.e.l.l in the Gao Xing Royal Depository and it had been stored there for a long time, she just randomly came across it.\u201dZhuan Xu asked Yin \u201cCan Xiao Yao wake up?\u201dYin signed \u201cThe Miss poisoned herself with enough poison to kill herself. It\u2019s not clear whether her body has built up tolerance to the poison or some other unknown factor, but she is technically dead as she\u2019s stopped breathing. But for some weird reason her heart continues to beat. If this continues, she\u2019ll likely sleep forever like this. I don\u2019t have the skill to wake up her, but there is likely two people who can.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cOne is the Royal Mother, she supposedly knows all the magic in the world and can figure out the blood magic scribbled on the sea sh.e.l.l to wake Xiao Yao up. The other is the person who saved Xiao Yao the last time she was gravely injured, I determined Xiao Yao was dead that time but that person actually saved Xiao Yao\u2019s life.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cReady the cloud carriage, we\u2019re going to Jade Mountain.\u201dYin and Xiao Xiao looked at each other and knew it was pointless but still said it \u201cYour Majesty just woke up and your body is still weak. Now is not suitable for traveling. Please rest a day before departing.\u201dZhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao \u201cDepart in 30 minutes!\u201dXiao Xiao bowed \u201cYes!\u201dAfter traveling all night, Zhuan Xu\u2019s entourage arrived on Jade Mountain and he sent an envoy to ask to speak with the Royal Mother.Moments later, a man wearing black rushed over, his eyes a beautiful fox like allure and when he spoke his voice was so melodic and soothing that it eased away all the exhaustion. Sir Bi said \u201cI was just talking with Lie Yang about going to Sheng Nong Mountain to pick up Xiao Yao, who knew you would arrive now. Zhuan Xu, oh no, now you are His Majesty! Jade Mountain does not get involved with worldly affairs so I heard that you had united the vast wilderness but it doesn\u2019t seem real yet to me. Did Xiao Yao come with you?\u201dZhuan Xu wanted to smile but couldn\u2019t fake it in front of Ah Bi so he wearily said \u201cXiao Yao is here but she\u2019s\u2026\u2026.sick. I came to Jade Mountain to have the Royal Mother see her.\u201dSir Bi glanced at the servants carrying a white sea sh.e.l.l and his expression turned worried \u201cFollow me.\u201dHe spoke softly to Zhuan Xu as they walked \u201cLast time when you came with Xiao Yao, the Royal Mother already said her life was nearing the end. These years she\u2019s grown weak and her memory is failing. Sometimes she even forgets where she is living. Lie Yang and I do not leave her side one step. A few days ago, when the Royal Mother was lucid, she discussed succession plans with us so we knew her time is near. I discussed with Lie Yang about going to get Xiao Yao so she could say her final farewell.\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s face fell, he knew life and death was the normal course of life but seeing the people he was familiar with leaving one after another still left him bereft.Sir Bi added \u201cRight now the Royal Mother is lucid so she can check on Xiao Yao first.\u201dThe Royal Mother was gaunt but her energy was high, she listened to what Zhuan Xu had to say before ordering Lie Yang to open the sea sh.e.l.l.Xiao Yao rested inside the sea sh.e.l.l like a precious pearl. After the Royal Mother checked on her, she noted that the blood magic written on the sea sh.e.l.l was a magic to extend Xiao Yao\u2019s life. How did Zhuan Xu get a hold of such priceless treasure? The Royal Mother closed the sea sh.e.l.l and ordered \u201cHave the sea sh.e.l.l tossed in the lake!\u201dZhuan Xu was alarmed \u201cRoyal Mother!\u201dRoyal Mother smiled \u201cI may be losing my mind but I\u2019m not gone yet. I won\u2019t kill her in front of you, much less harm a child I raised for seventy years.\u201dZhuan Xu was relieved but worried \u201cA person living in the magical lake for long can\u2019t handle it, much less Xiao Yao in her current weak state\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what special things happened to Xiao Yao these years but her body now\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d The Royal Mother stopped herself, sensing that Zhuan Xu did not know. Whether Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to tell him, or she didn\u2019t know either, Royal Mother didn\u2019t want to say any more. \u201cI can\u2019t say for certain but I know that Xiao Yao\u2019s body is not afraid of water. Xiao Yao has stopped breathing, if it wasn\u2019t for this special sea sh.e.l.l then her heart would have also stopped. Putting her in the lake will only do her good.\u201dZhuan Xu picked up the sea sh.e.l.l himself and slowly walked into the lake carrying it in his arms. He did as the Royal Mother instructed and sank the sea sh.e.l.l deep into the lake.Royal Mother saw his worry and said \u201cLie Yang has a fish ruby, if you\u2019re worried then use it to go down and check.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Zhuan Xu took the fish ruby and dived into the lake. He came up a long while later and kneeled before the Royal Mother \u201cWill Royal Mother please save Xiao Yao and wake her up.\u201dRoyal Mother said \u201cI don\u2019t have the power to take her up. All I know is that right now Xiao Yao won\u2019t die, she might wake up in twenty or thirty years, or maybe two hundred or three hundred years.\u201dLie Yang and Ah Bi were initially very worried about Xiao Yao, but hearing that she would wake up eventually was a relief. They lived on Jade Mountain, year in year out it was the same, and a few hundred years felt like the blink of an eye. But to Zhuan Xu that wasn\u2019t the case, a few hundred years could be countless life changing moments, endless partings and gatherings, it could even be an entire lifetime. Zhuan Xu had been rus.h.i.+ng since he regained consciousness so hearing Xiao Yao might not waken for hundreds of years left him reeling and his body wobbled and Xiao Xiao rushed over to a.s.sist.The Royal Mother walked off without a word and Lie Yang transformed into a bird and few off after her.Sir Bi said to Zhuan Xu \u201cThe Royal Mother\u2019s memory is addled again, I\u2019ll take you to rest but the rule of Jade Mountain since the dawn of time is that no man can stay more than three nights. Three days later Your Majesty needs to leave.\u201dXiao Xiao countered \u201cWhat about you and Lie Yang?\u201dSir Bi blinked with humor at her \u201cWe\u2019re not men, I\u2019m a fox and Liu Yang is a bird.\u201dXiao Xiao blushed and quickly looked away.Zhuan Xu said to Sir Bi \u201cArrange rooms for my retainers, I want to rest by the lake.\u201dSir Bi paused then said \u201cJade Mountain is spring during all four seasons so you can sleep outside. There is a gazebo close to the lake, I\u2019ll have a pallet placed there with a net and you can rest.\u201dLate into the night, Zhuan Xu had dined but still couldn\u2019t sleep so he used the fish ruby and dived into the lake to see Xiao Yao.The all white sea sh.e.l.l was open with ridges along the edges like waves, under the pearl light it appeared Xiao Yao was sleeping on white waves, her expression peaceful with a small smile as if she was having a lovely dream.Zhuan Xu stared at her, unable to decide whether he should go find Xiang Liu who likely could wake her up. He could afford any price Xiang Liu asked for such as tens more years to let Gong Gong\u2019s army stay alive. But should he wake Xiao Yao up? Is that really best for her?The road here, Xiao Yao was by his side each step of the way. No matter what happened she steadfastly stood beside him. He wanted to wake her because he selfishly wanted her to continue to be by his side. But if Xiao Yao woke up, would she be willing to stay beside him?He killed Jing!Before Zhuan Xu thought he was dying, he apologized for the first and only time in his entire time. \u201cI was wrong!\u201d He said it not just because of Xiao Yao, but because he owed it to Jing. Xiao Yao said \u201cI forgive you!\u201d but her forgiveness was built on their dying. She couldn\u2019t get revenge for Jing so she chose death, using the most final method of leaving him.Zhuan Xu knew that if Xiao Yao woke up, she would never stay with him. Rather than have her live in pain, he would rather her sleep in peace.The long pa.s.sage of time would turn a young woman\u2019s beauty into an old woman\u2019s wrinkles, but it would also soften the heartache and turn the longing into memory.Zhuan Xu softly kissed Xiao Yao and vowed in his heart \u201cI hope when you wake up, you will have let everything go. No matter how long you sleep, I will wait for you. I will wait for when you agree to begin anew with me! One hundred years, one thousand years, I will always wait!\u201dThree days later Zhuan Xu bid farewell to the Royal Mother and said to Sir Bi and Lie Yang \u201cI leave Xiao Yao in your care. After I prepare a powerful magic lake in Sheng Nong Mountain, I will come pick Xiao Yao up.\u201dZhuan Xu immediately went to see the Yellow Emperor when he arrived on Sheng Nong Mountain.This was the first time the Yellow Emperor raged since Zhuan Xu took the throne \u201cDo you know how important you are to the entire world! If you don\u2019t care then why pick this path! I gave you a chance to pick years ago, you\u2019re the one who picked this path!\u201d He did everything in his power to prevent Xiao Yao from getting to Zhuan Xu for revenge, who knew Zhuan XU would willingly deliver himself to Xiao Yao.Zhuan Xu kneeled before the Yellow Emperor \u201cI know what I mean to the entire world.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor roared in rage \u201cIf you know, why go see Xiao Yao when you knew she wanted to kill you?\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s face reflected his sorrow \u201cBecause I believed in my heart that Xiao Yao would not kill me to avenge Jing. Because I know that I am more important to her than Jing!\u201dThe Yellow Emperor pointed his finger at Zhuan Xu, shaking from his rage \u201cYou\u2026\u2026.you\u2026..you bet on your own life! You used your own life to gamble on whether you or Jing is more important to Xiao Yao!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cAnd the truth confirmed that Xiao Yao won\u2019t kill me.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor added \u201cBut she also didn\u2019t pick you! She would rather kill herself then stay with you.\u201dZhuan Xu pursed his lips and said nothing to that.The Yellow Emperor took big breaths to calm himself \u201cThis is the last time! Remember well, this is the last and final time!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s lip curled up in a bitter smile as he said softly to the Yellow Emperor \u201cThere is only one Xiao Yao in this world, Grandfather, even if you wanted me to do it a second time I can\u2019t!\u201dPeople talk about love and the Yellow Emperor was finally seeing it before his eyes. All his rage dissipated seeing Zhuan Xu so despondent like this so he sighed \u201cYou get up!\u201dZhuan Xu bowed three times before sitting down on a chair.The Yellow Emperor said \u201cWrite a letter to the White Emperor. Xiao Yao sent Left Ear there with a request that the White Emperor teach him a trade so he can earn money and raise his family. The White Emperor worries that something happened to Xiao Yao and wrote to me. If it wasn\u2019t for risking chaos if he left Xuan Yuan Mountain, he would be here right now. You write to him and explain everything!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI will give him a satisfactory explanation.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor continued \u201cWith the a.s.sistance of Chi Sui Hai Tian, the new Chi Sui clan leader has been named so the immediate danger has pa.s.sed. But don\u2019t forget what he wants from you.\u201d\u201cChi Sui Hai Tian wants the lives of Gong Gong and Xiang Liu, to avenge the death of his grandson Feng Long. Originally I wanted to slowly attrition attack Gong Gong\u2019s forces, one to avoid conflict with the Middle Plains, and to limit the number of deaths. But with Feng Long\u2019s death, this strategy will upset the Chi Sui clan and Sheng Nong tribe, they will perceive it as I don\u2019t care about Feng Long\u2019s death. I\u2019ve already decided to use a kingdom\u2019s worth of force to quickly destroy Gong Gong\u2019s army and use their lives to avenge Feng Long.\u201dThe Yellow Emperor nodded his head, as long as it didn\u2019t involve Xiao Yao then Zhuan Xu\u2019s decisions were always carefully thought through.On Jade Mountain, the sun was setting and the peach blossoms blooming in exquisite glory in the sunset. In a sky, a white condor with golden fur crown was slowly descending through the clouds, with a white robed white hair Xiang Liu standing on its back, billowing in the wind like an ethereal being.Sir Bi wearing all black was waiting for him in the forest. When Xiang Liu saw him, he vaulted down and landed softly before him.Xiang Liu bowed respectfully \u201cI came to see the Royal Mother. My adopted father asked me to thank the Royal Mother for her gift of the Saturn peach wine. After drinking it, his old injuries feel much better.\u201dSir Bi said \u201cThe Royal Mother isn\u2019t lucid right now and won\u2019t recognize you. Why don\u2019t you rest for a night and see her tomorrow.\u201dXiang Liu clearly knew about the Royal Mother\u2019s illness and didn\u2019t look surprised. He respectfully said \u201cAs Sir Bi will arrange.\u201d\u201cYou want to stay in the same place?\u201d\u201cThe same.\u201dSir Bi gestured a welcome and Xiang Liu followed him until reaching a residence. Sir Bi didn\u2019t leave and instead took out a bottle of Saturn peach wine and the two men began to drink.The Royal Mother was sworn blood siblings with one of the former Flame Emperors, so she took extra care of Gong Gong. But Jade Mountain remained uninvolved in world affairs so she would just send medicines to Gong Gong without ever asking about his matters.Xiang Liu visited Jade Mountain many times and was casual acquaintances with Sir Bi, the two would always drink together when Xiang Liu visited. They would discuss good food and places visited, and would even play instruments and sing if the mood arouse. They never discussed world affairs either.Sir Bi\u2019s voice was magically powerful and could enchant and corrupt men\u2019s souls. Even Lie Yang didn\u2019t dare listen to Ah Bi sing. After gaining human form, Sir Bi only sang once by accident and it caused ma.s.s chaos on Jade Mountain so he never sang again. Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t afraid of Sir Bi\u2019s voice and asked him to sing.Sir Bi said \u201cI am a winged fox demon, my voice will enchant the soul.\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cI\u2019m a nine-headed demon, it\u2019ll be hard to enchant all nine of my heads! And if I am enchanted, it wouldn\u2019t matter because I\u2019ve done nothing worth fearing.\u201dBecause of this bold att.i.tude, that\u2019s why Sir Bi got along so well with him.After many cups of the wine, Sir Bi finally pa.s.sed out.Xiang Liu opened his eyes and looked around. His eyes were clear with no sign of being drunk. He vaulted out of the residence and rushed towards the lake as quiet as the wind.Under the full moon, the lake rippled silver waves as Xiang Liu silently entered the water and disappeared underneath.In seconds Xiang Liu reached the white seash.e.l.l and saw that outside the sh.e.l.l was a powerful maze constructed by Ah Bi and Lie Yang. He investigated the maze and sighed, no wonder Jade Mountain was so powerful and no one dared to go against it. He couldn\u2019t break such a powerful maze in a short period of time, so he would have to attack it directly to get close to Xiao Yao, but doing so would immediately alarm Ah Bi and Lie Yang. Xiang Liu thought about it and created a quick maze outside of the first one. It couldn\u2019t stop Ah Bi and Lie Yang but could at least delay them a bit.After creating the maze barrier, Xiang Liu directly barged into the protective maze around Xiao Yao, doing so forcefully to save time. After he opened the seash.e.l.l and pulled Xiao Yao into his arms, Si Bi and Lie Yang arrived on scene and were kept outside by Xiang Liu\u2019s maze.Sir Bi pleaded \u201cXiang Liu, please don\u2019t hurt her. If you do then Lie Yang and I will be forced to kill you.\u201dXiang Liu had no time to spare to explain, he summoned all the colorful fishes in the lake to lock tails and surround him and Xiao Yao like a rainbow colored ball. The noise was thundering outside as Lie Yang and Sir Bi attacked the maze, but inside was a silent little oasis of just him and Xiao Yao.Xiang Liu tightly embraced Xiao Yao in his arms and sat down cross legged on the seash.e.l.l. He bit down on his own tongue to draw blood and then kissed Xiao Yao, feeding her his essential blood. The Lover\u2019s Bug connected the heart of lovers, as long as one breath remained then life could be extended if essential blood is transfused.Xiang Liu\u2019s maze was broken and Lie Yang and Sir Bi rushed inside. Lie Yang was furious and his one attacked caused all the fishes to scatter, like a rainbow of light vanis.h.i.+ng around Xiao Yao and Xiang Liu.Lie Yang knew Xiao Yao\u2019s body composition was strange, and seeing Xiang Liu kissing her, he thought Xiang Liu was using some voodoo spell to suck the life force out of Xiao Yao. He furiously struck Xiang Liu with a resounding blow, and Xiang Liu was in the middle of reviving Xiao Yao so he couldn\u2019t move to protect himself and could only endure the harsh attack. Sir Bi sensed it was not what it looked like so interjected to stop Lie Yang.Sir Bi grabbed Lie Yang\u2019s hand from striking again \u201cHe doesn\u2019t appear to be harming Xiao Yao, her life force is getting stronger and stronger.\u201dLie Yang stopped to sense and just like Sir Bi said, Xiao Yao\u2019s life force was growing stronger. Lie Yang grumbled \u201cIt\u2019s not normal, what\u2019s going on here!\u201d But he didn\u2019t try to attack again and instead formed a protective s.h.i.+eld around Xiang Liu.After some time, Xiang Liu emerged from the water carrying Xiao Yao in his arms. He said \u201cThank you both for the a.s.sistance.\u201dLie Yang reached out his arms and barked \u201cGive Xiao Yao back to us!\u201dXiang Liu lowered his head to stare intently at Xiao Yao, saying nothing and allowing Lie Yang to take her from his arms.Even though he could sense Xiao Yao was fine now, Sir Bi still took her pulse and did a thorough check. Like he thought, she was all recovered, and actually ought to have woken up by now. But Xiang Liu appeared to want to keep her asleep so cast a spell on her that temporarily kept her slumbering.Sir Bi said to Lie Yang \u201cTake Xiao Yao back to the room to rest, she should wake up tomorrow morning.\u201dXiang Liu called out \u201cPlease wait!\u201dLie Yang glared at Xiang Liu \u201cYour fight with the Black Emperor doesn\u2019t involve Xiao Yao. If you dare get any ideas about her, Ah Bi and I will go kill Gong Gong first, and then kill you!\u201dXiang Liu knew Lie Yang\u2019s ornery temper so didn\u2019t get upset, instead he calmly looked at Ah Bi and quietly asked \u201cPlease keep Xiao Yao here, and I need to speak to you alone.\u201dAh Bi thought about it before taking Xiao Yao from Lie Yang, who huffed and transformed into a bird and flew away.Ah Bi snapped a peach blossom branch and turned it into a raft before placing Xiao Yao inside. Xiang Liu quietly watched, and under the moonlight with his white hair and white rode he appeared to be etched from snow and ice.Sir Bi finished placing Xiao Yao in the raft before turning back to Xiang Liu and warmly gesturing to the all white seash.e.l.l \u201cSeeing the seash.e.l.l, even the Royal Mother marveled at the careful thought that went into preparing it to keep Xiao Yao alive. I asked Zhuan Xu\u2019s servant and heard it was a treasure from the Gao Xing Palace repository. Tonight I realized that you made it, otherwise you could not have revived Xiao Yao this quickly. But\u2026\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t understand how the Empress on Five G.o.ds Mountain would have kept this a secret for you.\u201dXiang Liu explained \u201cMany years ago, Ah Nian promised that she would do one thing for me. I called the favor and asked her to use this seash.e.l.l to keep Xiao Yao alive, but not to let the Black Emperor or Xiao Yao know. She\u2019s a smart girl, she not only kept her promise, she also knows that there are some things in this world that she ought to forget right afterwards!\u201dSir Bi sighed \u201cThe White Emperor not only raised good disciples and students, he raised a good daughter.\u201dXiang Liu said \u201cXiao Yao told me that she lived on Jade Mountain for seventy years when she was small. It\u2019s clear how much you guys care about her, so taking care of her is not because the Black Emperor asked it of you.\u201dSir Bi ruefully said \u201cThe world is filled with happiness and sadness, and time washes away everything. Lie Yang and I have let all worldly connections go, but the only thing of the world we care about is Xiao Yao.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201dSi Bi said \u201cMy mom died when I was born, and Qi Yo came across and rescued me. He sent me to Jade Mountain to Xiao Yao\u2019s mom, who raised me since I was a baby. When Lie Yang was still a phoenix bird, he was captured by Qi Yo to use as the carrier bird to send messages back and forth to Xiao Yao\u2019s mom. She was a mother and family to both of us.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSir Bi stared at Xiang Liu \u201cI heard your reputation isn\u2019t so good out in the world?\u201dXiang Liu chuckled \u201cMy reputation is just a hairsbreadth better than Qi Yo.\u201dSir Bir grew silent before asking \u201cYou and Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u2026.you two really are just friends?\u201dXiang Liu smiled before turning to look at Xiao Yao \u201cThe person Xiao Yao is missing is Tu Shan Jing.\u201dSir Bi sighed in relief \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dXiang Liu said mockingly \u201cCan\u2019t believe my reputation is so bad even a demon raised by Qi Yo would disdain me.\u201dSir Bi shook his head \u201cNo, I don\u2019t disdain you at all. It\u2019s the opposite, I truly respect you! Your heart is as clear as crystal, even my voice cannot enchant you or lead you astray. Power, wealth, and glory hold no sway or temptation for you.\u201dSir Bi stared at Xiang Liu and looked truly conflicted, like he was looking at Xiang Liu but seeing another great man from long ago \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re not good\u2026\u2026..it\u2019s just that\u2026\u2026.for Xiao Yao\u2026\u2026\u201d Sir Bi sighed loudly \u201cEven if Tu Shan Jing is dead, I\u2019m still relieved that the guy Xiao Yao picked was him.\u201dXiang Liu smiled and appeared not to take offense to what Sir Bi said and asked \u201cI have one favor to ask of you.\u201dSir Bi said \u201cIf I can do it, I will.\u201d A gentleman\u2019s friends.h.i.+p may be light as water, but a gentleman\u2019s promise was a heavy as gold.\u201cI want to sever the remaining connections between me and Xiao Yao. In a bit, no matter what is happening, please do not interfere and just watch.\u201dSir Bi replied swiftly \u201cI will!\u201dXiang Liu waved his hand and Xiao Yao\u2019s precious gorilla beast mirror flew from her arms into his hand. He stared at it for a long time and didn\u2019t make any move.Sir Bi stood to the side and silently and patiently looked on.Xiang Liu smiled and explained to Sir Bi \u201cThis is a gorilla mirror that\u2019s saved some ancient stuff from the past. Not even sure if Xiao Yao already deleted it.\u201d He waved his hand and the mirror clouded before clearly showing Xiang Liu\u2019s face.In a dingy room in Qing Shui Town, Xiang Liu was injured and couldn\u2019t move. Xiao Yao s.n.a.t.c.hed the opportunity to get revenge on Xiang Liu for being mean to her for so long. She used coal briquettes and drew seven eyes on Xiang Liu\u2019s face, and together with his two eyes, it formed nine eyes so she could mock him for being a nine headed demon.At that time, Xiao Yao was holding the mirror with one hand so only her other hand was visible. Her voice was totally mocking as she said \u201cTake a good look, but don\u2019t get mad otherwise you\u2019ll interrupt the healing.\u201dXiang Liu opened his eyes looking like he was going to kill her, but Xiao Yao wasn\u2019t scared and instead rubbed the seven eyes while counting until she used her grubby charcoal hands to draw nine heads on Xiang Liu\u2019s face. She cackled \u201cI still can\u2019t imagine what nine heads look like, when are you going to show me your true form?\u201dXiang Liu glared at Xiao Yao and silently mouthed \u201cI. Am. Going. To. Eat. You.\u201dNine Lives Xiang Liu was reknowned for being deadly but with his face all blackened the scariness of his threat lessened immensely.Xiang Liu watched to this part and then started laughing. From the moment he was born he didn\u2019t have parents, and had to start surviving from that moment forward. He had no childhood or playmates or fun, and after he was an adult his reputation was so bad that no one dared to joke around with him. Xiao Yao was the first time person who dared to play tricks on him, but do so without any real ill will or harmful intention.Xiang Liu stared at his blackened face in the mirror for quite some time in a daze. Then he waved his hand and called forth the next memory \u2013 to remove the bug from Zhuan Xu, he struck a deal with Xiao Yao and took her to Five G.o.ds Mountain where he successfully planted the bug in himself. Afterwards the guards chased them so he took Xiao Yao deep into the ocean where they explored for a long time.Xiang Liu stared at the mirror recording of the colorful seash.e.l.ls, various fishes, the underwater fields\u2026\u2026Xiang Liu in all white walking while Xiao Yao was right next to him curiously taking all the sights in.Whether it was Xiao Yao being so amazed at being under the sea or there were too many things to take in, she secretly recorded the memory without Xiang Liu knowing. She likely did so from behind him so his profile was always in view. Only at the last scene when he turned around to look at her did the mirror record his face directly.Xiao Yao quickly put the mirror away so the memory ended on that ephemeral image of Xiang Liu turning to look at her.Xiang Liu still clearly remembered the moment he discovered these saved memories in the gorilla mirror. He was shocked and amazed, that Xiao Yao secretly recorded him, and that he wasn\u2019t even aware of it. That proved he was completely relaxed at that time, and Xiao Yao could have had the chance to kill him.Xiang Liu stared at the mirror for a long time before sighing, taking Xiao Yao to Five G.o.ds Mountain felt like yesterday to him, but was really so long ago! His hand lifted to erase the memories but Sir Bi stopped him looking alarmed \u201cThese are Xiao Yao\u2019s most precious memories, you can\u2019t!!!!\u201dXiang Liu silently looked at Sir Bi until he remembered the promise he just made and slowly released his hand.Xiang Liu used his power to rewind the saved memory in the mirror like turning back time. It was like things were going back to the way it was from the very beginning, but there was no way to do so with feelings and memories!After the memories were erased, Xiang Liu smiled and returned the mirror to Xiao Yao\u2019s arms like he never touched it before.Xiang Liu sat down next to the raft and stared at the sleeping Xiao Yao before softly saying \u201cThe tree grows old on land together, the mandarin ducks die together in the water \u2013 the Lover\u2019s Bug connects heart to heart and our lives, and it truly has no way to break the bug. Years ago I was only able to remove the bug from Zhuan Xu because he didn\u2019t know it was you so he didn\u2019t willingly accept the bug. So you never successfully planted the bug on him in the first place. But I\u2026.I was heart and soul willing, so the bug successfully planted in me. You asked me to remove the bug and I kept telling you I can\u2019t do it, but you didn\u2019t believe me. But I truly didn\u2019t lie to you, I cannot remove the bug.\u201dXiang Liu picked up Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and used his finger as a knife to slice into the flesh of her palm and his palm back and forth until he drew a blood spell \u201cI cannot remove the bug, but I can kill the bug!\u201dXiang Liu smiled before joining his b.l.o.o.d.y palm to Xiao Yao\u2019s b.l.o.o.d.y palm, so tightly that the blood flowing wasn\u2019t clear whether it was his or hers. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for not telling you this before, blame yourself for being useless!\u201dXiang Liu started to chant the spell and with it countless glowing blue dots appeared and flew around both of them. The blue dots lit up the night sky until it was an ethereal beauty of lights in the air and reflected in the lake surface.Xiang Liu\u2019s hand suddenly grabbed a real dagger made from ice and he stabbed it directly into his own heart. Sir Bi gasped out loud and had to force himself to not do anything.Xiang Liu pulled out the dagger and blood gushed from the wound in his chest. All the blue dots rushed into the wound on his chest until it all vanished inside.After all the blue dots were gone, Xiang Liu\u2019s face was stark while and he pressed down with one hand on his chest wound, and the other grabbed medicine but he didn\u2019t apply it to himself and instead applied it on Xiao Yao\u2019s hand. The cuts on her hand quickly healed until there was no sign it was ever injured.Xiang Liu smiled sadly and said to Xiao Yao \u201cI broke the bug between us! From now on, you and I will have no connection with each other!\u201dXiang Liu gently pushed the raft towards Sir Bi \u201cShe will wake up tomorrow morning.\u201dSir Bi understood what happened \u2013 the heart and life connected Lover\u2019s Bug was planted between Xiang Liu and Xiao Yao, which is why Xiang Liu could have saved Xiao Yao\u2019s life earlier. Xiang Liu managed to now break the bug by using his own life as the lure to kill the bugs. It was a suicidal method, but a method that only Nine Lives Xiang Liu could use by taking one of his lives.Sir Bi took out his precious medicine \u201cDo you want me to heal you?\u201dXiang Liu smiled \u201cSuch medicines are no use on me.\u201dSir Bi anxiously asked \u201cBut you\u2026..your injuries\u2026.what can I do for you?\u201dXiang Liu casually said \u201cDon\u2019t be like this, you know that facing down the Xuan Yuan army, one more or one less lives of mine doesn\u2019t make a difference!\u201dSir Bi\u2019s face fell and he grew silent.Xiang Liu added \u201cYou can do one thing for me.\u201dSir Bi immediately agreed.\u201cIf later people ask about the bug in Xiao Yao, just make up a believable lie!\u201d Xiang Liu smiled like it didn\u2019t bother him one whit \u201cXiao Yao once said that she never ever wanted to see me again in this life and this lifetime. After tonight, she and I truly have no further ties. I also never want to see her again!\u201dSir Bi stared forlornly at Xiang Liu before saying \u201cI will ask the Royal Mother to help lie that she removed the bug. Don\u2019t worry, what happened here tonight, only you and I know outside of the Heavens. I will never ever let Xiao Yao know the truth! I will not ruin all that you\u2019ve done for her and carefully arranged.\u201dXiang Liu\u2019s face was ashen and he continued to clutch his chest wound, but he smiled and tried to bow. Sir Bi had nothing he could say further so he bowed back low as a promise that he would forever keep this secret and not fail all that Xiang Liu had done.Xiang Liu looked at the horizon and saw a sliver of light coming as dawn was arriving. He stood up wobbily \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go.\u201dSir Bi thought he was past all the feelings of the ordinary world, but in this moment he actually felt a genuine deep sadness \u201cI heard the war is getting more and more intense, and yet you took time away to come all the way to Jade Mountain just for Xiao Yao?\u201d Even Sir Bi knew that the battle was raging and Gong Gong\u2019s army was on the verge of defeat.Xiang Liu smiled \u201cIt\u2019s not taking time away from official business, I came here for a stroll is all!\u201d He bid farewell and vaulted onto the back of his white condor. Just as he was about to leave, he seemed to remember something and rained snowflakes down from the sky. The snowflakes landed on the white seash.e.l.l and quickly melted it until it disappeared into the lake like it was never there.This time, everything having to do with him was well and truly erased, no sign left whatsoever. Just like the most beautiful of snow, after it falls it melts once the sun rises, vanis.h.i.+ng without a trace.Xiang Liu looked over at Xiao Yao one last time before flying East towards the rising sun.As the light rose over the horizon, he left like the wind with his white robe billowing, as magical as an otherworldly being. Sir Bi wanted to tell him farewell, but such a simple parting phrase felt as heavy as the weight of a mountain and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it. This parting, it was likely going to be blood spilled, bones buried, ashes scattered, a parting without a gathering to come.After a moment, Sir Bi suddenly remembered a very ancient ballad, and he glanced at Xiao Yao in the raft before looking up at Xiang Liu with tears in his eyes.Sir Bi started to sing in the most melodic sorrowful voice.Oh hey oh heyPlease cut my eyes outSo my blood splashes on your robeLike the blossoms of peachesJust so I am in your eyesOh hey oh heyPlease take my heart outSo my blood spills on the plainsLike the peach blossom on the mountainsJust so I am in your heartPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where is this place?\u201dFrom\u00a0the red blossoms a figure in white rushed over and Xiao Yao almost forgot to breathe until she saw his green eyes and released a disappointed breath \u201cLie Yang, why am I on Jade Mountain?\u201d\u201cYou were sick so Zhuan Xu brought you to the Royal Mother for healing.\u201dZhuan Xu explained that she was sick? Fine, might as well stick with the story\u2026..Xiao Yao asked \u201cWhere is Zhuan Xu?\u201d\u201cLeft.\u201dXiao Yao was relieved and asked \u201cDid the Royal Mother save me?\u201dLie Yang didn\u2019t answer her, transforming into a white bird and flying away.Ah Bi walked in with a smile \u201cYour body was fine, the Royal Mother saw that you could breathe underwater so sank you into the lake filled with Jade Mountain spiritual essence and that woke you up.\u201dXiao Yao smiled bitterly, such deadly poison couldn\u2019t even kill her. Having the bug connected with Xiang Liu was like giving herself nine lives. But what was the point of living like this?Sir Bi saw Xiao Yao\u2019s devastated expression and gently said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay on Jade Mountain for awhile! The Royal Mother doesn\u2019t have much time left, even if the Black Emperor didn\u2019t bring you we were going to bring you here.\u201dXiao Yao stared in shock at Sir Bi who replied calmly \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, death is a natural part of life.\u201dXiao Yao thought about it, if one could not love and live freely then death would be a form of release. She said \u201cI want to see the Royal Mother.\u201dSir Bi said \u201cThe Royal Mother is alert right now so I\u2019ll take you to see her.\u201dThe Royal Mother was admiring flowers in the corridor and when she saw Xiao Yao, she didn\u2019t look surprised and waved her over \u201cXiao Yao, did you dine yet? Come have breakfast with me!\u201dXiao Yao had never ever seen such a warm inviting Royal Mother, if it wasn\u2019t for Sir Bi and Lie Yang around, she would have thought someone was posing as her.Xiao Yao picked up a bowl of saturn peach essence\u00a0and took a few sips. The Royal Mother was drinking wine and flipping through discs of pictures with writing on it.The Royal Mother stared until she tossed it all aside in annoyance. A few servants quickly picked the pictures up as a simply dressed woman walked out from the peach blossom forest and said to the Royal Mother \u201cYou know your own health, one of these days you won\u2019t wake up. You need to decide now.\u201dXiao Yao remembered the woman was called Sui Hong and was in charge of guarding Jade Mountain\u2019s treasure repository. She was rarely ever seen, when Xiao Yao lived on Jade Mountain for seventy years she only saw her three or four times.The Royal Mother downed an entire bottle of wine and played with the empty bottle \u201cIf you know I\u2019m about to die then leave me alone for a few days!\u201dSui Hong handed the pictures back \u201cIf I leave you alone, then after you die I will have no peace!\u201dThe Royal Mother said \u201cAll the girls seem like good people, why do they want to be the Royal Mother?\u201d She was about to pick another picture up when she paused and looked over at Xiao Yao and asked \u201cXiao Yao, have you thought about the future?\u201dXiao Yao was startled \u201cWhat?\u201dThe Royal Mother leisurely said \u201cSometimes the world is so big that anywhere can be home, sometimes the world is so big but nowhere to go and death is a release. Jade Mountain isn\u2019t a good place, but it is cut off from the rest of the world. Xiao Yao, do you want to become the next Royal Mother and govern Jade Mountain?\u201dThe Royal Mother\u2019s expression was as if she already knew everything. Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes teared up, the entire world belonged to Zhuan Xu and there was nowhere she could go to hide from him. Only Jade Mountain cut off from the entire world gave her a place to rest.Xiao Yao replied \u201cI do!\u201dThe Royal Mother clapped her hands and turned to s.h.i.+u Hong \u201cThere, the matter is taken care of so you can disappear off now.\u201dShui Hong looked at Xiao Yao and sighed \u201cCan\u2019t believe the one person who didn\u2019t want to be on Jade Mountain the most now wants to stay here forever.\u201d s.h.i.+u Hong picked up the items and walked off.Lie Yang landed on a peach blossom branch \u201cXiao Yao, being the Royal Mother means you will never be able to leave Jade Mountain for the rest of your life and must be alone forever. Have you really thought it through?\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI thought it through, the world may be vast but there is nowhere I can go now. Being the Royal Mother is my only resting place.\u201d In the past she greedily sought out the sights and sounds of the outside world but now that she lost everything, nothing mattered to her anywhere. She was tired and wanted only a peaceful spot to putter around for the rest of her life.Lie Yang grew silent and Sir Bi wanted to object but couldn\u2019t find a reason to. Perhaps reaching this point, growing old on Jade Mountain really was Xiao Yao\u2019s only choice.The Royal Mother saw that no one objected and proclaimed \u201cIn three days an announcement will be made to the world that the new Royal Mother will take over Jade Mountain.\u201dSince coming back from Jade Mountain, Zhuan Xu had people looking around Sheng Nong Mountain and finally found a lake suitable for Xiao Yao to rest in. He summoned powerful beings to build a mystic maze to keep the power inside and maintain Xiao Yao\u2019s state. After it was readied, he went personally to Jade Mountain to pick up Xiao Yao.Last time he was there, the Royal Mother was ill so greeted him in her personal residence courtyard. Now he was led to the main hall of Jade Mountain and could see the puppet maids and servants bustling around decorating everywhere. He was confused and asked \u201cDid the Royal Mother\u2019s health improve?\u201dThe maid answered respectfully \u201cHer Highness is so ill she is no longer seeing guests. But she has chosen her successor and now all matters on Jade Mountain are being directed by the next Royal Mother.\u201dZhuan Xu mused \u201cSo the new Royal Mother has already taken over affairs on Jade Mountain. How come a proclamation wasn\u2019t made to the world?\u201dThe maid replied \u201cIt\u2019s been set for the 19th, the day of the announcement and her succession ceremony.\u201dZhuan Xu still sensed it was odd but the Royal Mother was inscrutable and difficult so her actions didn\u2019t always seem logical.When he arrived at the entrance to the hall, Sui Hong greeted him with a deep bow \u201cJade Mountain deputy general Sui Hong greets Your Majesty the Black Emperor.\u201dZhuan Xu replied courteously \u201cToday is the first time meeting the new Royal Mother, so great apologies for arriving empty handed without a congratulatory gift.\u201dSui Hong said \u201cIt\u2019s Jade Mountain at fault for not telling Your Majesty in advance. Tomorrow is the succession ceremony and if Your Majesty has the time, please stay to attend.\u201dZhuan Xu hesitated, Jade Mountain was unique in its power and position and the Royal Mother was giving him great honor to invite him to attend the ceremony, but right now Ru So and Gong Gong\u2019s battle was reaching its final crescendo and he barely found the time to come today.Sui Hong added \u201cNo need to decide now, Your Majesty, please welcome inside.\u201dZhuan Xu walked inside and saw all the windows open along both sides of the hall, showing the cliffs and blue skies of the vistas on one side and the peach blossom forest on the other.At the end of the hall was a woman in all white leaning against the window pane staring outside, as if she was admiring the view, but also playing with a peach blossom branch and plucking all the petals off as if she were impatiently waiting for someone.Zhuan Xu wondered to himself what kind of weird personality this new Royal Mother would have.A gust of wind blew past as the maid lifted the bead curtains and blew up the peach blossom petals on the ground, and in that swirling moment the woman in white turned around.Zhuan Xu had a polite smile ready which froze in that instant as he yelled \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dXiao Yao walked to the center of the hall and sat down on the Royal Mother throne, gesturing to Zhuan Xu \u201cYour Majesty, please sit.\u201dZhuan Xu knew the reality but still refused to believe it. He didn\u2019t even bother to ask Xiao Yao how she woke from the coma and rushed up to her to ask \u201cXiao Yao, why are you dressed like the Royal Mother?\u201d\u201cTomorrow, I will become the Royal Mother.\u201d\u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\u201cI lived on Jade Mountain for 70 years, I know exactly what that means.\u201dZhuan Xu was devastated and enraged as he continued \u201cThe Royal Mother cannot step one foot off the mountain, she must be alone for the rest of her life! You are drawing your own prison cell until you die! Even if Jing is dead, even if you don\u2019t love me, but your life is still very long and the world very vast. You can still find someone to spend your life with! Is there no one left in this world that is worth your staying for?\u201dXiao Yao calmly said \u201cYour Majesty, please sit. From now on please call me Royal Mother, there is only the Royal Mother of Jade Mountain before you, I have no worldly name.\u201dZhuan Xu shook his head and grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand to drag her out \u201cYou come with me to see the Royal Mother. I\u2019ll tell her that you can\u2019t be the Royal Mother and she needs to find another successor!\u201dThe Jade Mountain guards blocked the way \u201cWill the Black Emperor release Her Highness!\u201dZhuan Xu\u2019s guards behind him unsheathed their weapons.Shui Hong walked inside and calmly said \u201cYour Majesty, this is Jade Mountain which does not interfere with worldly affairs, and the world cannot interfere with Jade Mountain matters! The world has had countless strife and many rulers, but Jade Mountain has never violated the order set down in ancient times by the Great Emperor Pan Gu. Even Fu Yi and Nu Wa greatly respect Jade Mountain! The Yellow Emperor and the White Emperor also are very courteous to Jade Mountain. Will the Black Emperor please not forget the edicts of old.\u201dXiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu\u2019s guards \u201cJade Mountain has no weapons! All the weapons of the world, no matter how powerful, has no effect on Jade Mountain. If you want to fight then a tree branch is more effective here. You all sheath your weapons now!\u201dThe guards remembered this legend and took a look at Zhuan Xu before sheepishly holstering their weapons.Xiao Yao turned to the Jade Mountain servants \u201cYou\u2019re all dismissed!\u201dThe servants retreated and even Shui Hong left the chamber. Xiao Yao\u2019s Royal Mother aura was so on point that even Zhuan Xu shuddered like he was in the middle of an nightmare. His heart descended down an endless chasm with no end in sight.Xiao Yao said to Zhuan Xu \u201cI woke two days ago and the Royal Mother wanted to send a message to you but I stopped her. I decided that day to become the next Royal Mother and she was worried I was being rash so gave me three days to think about it before announcing it to the world so I can change my mind. Zhuan Xu, no one is forcing me, this is my own choice!\u201dZhuan Xu grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand tightly like he was never going to let go \u201cWhy?\u201dXiao Yao smiled so casually, like this had nothing to do with her \u201cZhuan Xu, how can you not know why? I could have lived like an ordinary girl, marrying and having kids, living a simple happy life. You took it all away from me! I can\u2019t kill you, I can\u2019t kill myself, I can\u2019t even leave! The whole world knows I am Qi Yo\u2019s daughter, the whole world is under your rule \u2013 if I can avoid people trying to kill me, I still can\u2019t avoid your forces to bring me back. Zhuan Xu, the world is so vast but you\u2019ve pushed me to the point of being with you or having nowhere else to go!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t become the Royal Mother, I can give up\u2026\u2026.\u201dXiao Yao shook her head \u201cZhuan Xu, I\u2019m tired, let me rest now!\u201dZhuan Xu tightly held onto Xiao Yao\u2019s hand pleading \u201cXiao Yao, if you don\u2019t become the Royal Mother I will give you any freedom you want, go anywhere you want!\u201dXiao Yao got on her knees and raise her head to look up at Zhuan Xu \u201cGege, please I beg you to remember all we shared and agree to let me be the Royal Mother, give me a place to rest.\u201dHer expression was placid and in her dark depths there was no love or hate anymore, just nothingness.He remembered when those eyes reflected intelligence and charm, beauty and wit. Those eyes showed happiness and sorrow, would get worried and mad\u2026..even those last days on Sheng Nong Mountain those eyes reflected hatred.But now there was nothing there! It was like a dried up well\u2026\u2026..Zhuan Xu was so shocked his body grew slack and he backed up a few steps.Xiao Yao pulled her hand back and continued to kneel, no evidence of any emotion from her as she calmly pleased \u201cPlease will Gege agree to let me be the Royal Mother.\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t dare look into those eyes because it was a reminder that the Xiao Yao who accompanied him the entire way and was never crushed by any obstacle was now dead to him. And it was he would pushed her to this point step by step!Xiao Yao got up and said to Shui Hong \u201cIf the Black Emperor wants to spend one night please tend to him well. If he wants to leave then send him off. Everything else will go according to plan.\u201dShui Hong bowed \u201cYes.\u201dThat night by the lake, Xiao Yao wearing all white sat on a beam with her legs dangling over the water as she stared in a daze at her reflection on the surface.Sir Bi walked through the forest and said \u201cThe Black Emperor didn\u2019t leave, but also didn\u2019t say he was staying. He just sits on the mountain peak staring at the direction of Xuan Yuan Mountain, not eating or drinking, and not saying a single word.\u201dXiao Yao coolly said \u201cLeave him be. At most he can stay three days anyways.\u201dSir Bi continued \u201cXiao Yao, are you truly certain? Once you are the Royal Mother you are destined to be alone for the rest of your life, and can never leave Jade Mountain! It\u2019s not too late to change your mind!\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re concerned for me but I am truly certain! You and Lie Yang live on Jade Mountain all these years and are doing just fine.\u201dSir Bi didn\u2019t know what else to say and could only watch Xiao Yao worriedly.Xiao Yao smiled \u201cIt\u2019s fine! Go rest now, starting tomorrow I will be the Royal Mother and then you and Lie Yang have to listen to me on everything!\u201dSir Bi had no choice but to leave her be, but he turned back from the forest as he walked away and saw Xiao Yao still sitting above the water in a daze, her figure all alone, and he sighed deeply thinking that this tableau would continue for hundreds and even thousands more years.Dawn arrived on Jade Mountain and illuminated the vistas.Xiao Yao changed with the help of the servants into the most elaborate court dress and put on the Royal Mothers\u2019 peach blossom crown. Once the ceremony was done and she took the Jade Seal from the Royal Mother and stamped it on the proclamation decree to the world then she would officially rule Jade Mountain.Xiao Yao walked towards the ceremonial stage with the a.s.sistance of the servants, and on both sides of the path were blooming peach blossoms.Xiao Yao stared at the peach blossom forest and remembered when Jing proposed to her. It was on Cao Ao Peak on Sheng Nong Mountain, which didn\u2019t have any peach blossom trees, but Jing knew her parents pledged their love under peach blossom trees so he used his power to conjure up thousands of miles of peach blossoms and as the petals rained down he nervously asked \u201cTu Shan Jing wishes for Xi Ling Jiu Yao\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201dXiao Yao reached out her hand and caught a few peach blossoms and smiled.The Royal Mother was dressed in ceremonial robes and waited for her on the altar. She lucidly watched Xiao Yao and the only spectator below the stage was Zhuan Xu, his face starkly white and exhausted as he kept his eyes on Xiao Yao without blinking.Xiao Yao walked directly to the altar without looking anywhere else and the Royal Mother asked \u201cAs custom, I shall ask one final time \u2013 once you are Royal Mother you cannot get married or ever leave Jade Mountain. Do you still agree?\u201dZhuan Xu yelled \u201cXiao Yao\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201c with tears in his eyes, pleading with every fiber of his being.Under the peace blossoms falling around her Xiao Yao seemed to spot Jing and she tightly clenched her hands around the petals in her palm as she smiled at him and said \u201cI agree.\u201dThe Royal Mother nodded \u201cFine!\u201dZhuan Xu painfully closed his eyes.Shui Hong led Xiao Yao on the stage and she knelt down as the Royal Mother took out the Jade Seal and started reciting the succession pledge.Xiao Yao reached out and was about to take the Jade Seal when the sound of a crane calling anxiously reached them. Everyone looked skyward as the Royal Mother scowled \u201cToday is an important day and Jade Mountain is not accepting visitors!\u201dFrom the sky came a white crane with a blue robed man standing on its back, refined and elegant.Zhuan Xu\u2019s expression darkened and he took a few steps back while Xiao Yao stood up with her eyes open wide in shock and her body shook in surprise.The man in blue vaulted off the crane\u2019s back and landed on the altar. He appeared to have just gotten over a grave illness, his complexion pale and wan and his figure thin. But his features were graceful and refined and his demeanor calm and composed. He politely bowed to the Royal Mother \u201cTu Shan Jing from Qing Qiu. I\u2019m here to pick up my fianc\u00e9e. I heard from the servants that the succession ceremony was going on and should have waited but I had no choice to barge in so my apologies for the intrusion.\u201dThe Royal Mother was dumbfounded and asked \u201cTu Shan Jing? You didn\u2019t die?\u201dJing glanced at the regally attired Xiao Yao with tears in his eyes \u201cXiao Yao, I\u2019m back. I hope you don\u2019t hold it against me for coming so late!\u201d Jing walked towards Xiao Yao and two servants blocked his way with peach blossom branch canes. Jing didn\u2019t want to anger the Royal Mother so stopped and said softly\u201cXiao Yao, don\u2019t become the Royal Mother, you promised to marry me!\u201dXiao Yao walked off the altar as if in a dream towards Jing and the servants didn\u2019t stop her after seeing the Royal Mother didn\u2019t object.Until she was standing before Jing, Xiao Yao still couldn\u2019t believe this was real. She reached out her hand to touch his face \u201cJing, is it really you?\u201dJing answered \u201cI am Wen Xiao Liu\u2019s Ye s.h.i.+ Qi. Because you counted seventeen leaves on the herbal branch, that is why I am called s.h.i.+ Qi.\u201dXiao Yao smiled through her tears \u201cYou\u2019re really back!\u201dJing grabbed her hands \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you wait so long!\u201dXiao Yao burrowed into Jing\u2019s arms as her tears fell \u201cJing, Jing, you\u2019re finally back!\u201dJing comforted her \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u2026..don\u2019t cry\u2026..\u201dXiao Yao started crying even louder and pummeled his chest \u201cI kept waiting for you, I kept waiting for you and didn\u2019t believe you died. Every full moon I think you\u2019ll come back but you never did! I waited so long and thought you wouldn\u2019t come back\u2026\u2026..I thought you really abandoned me\u2026..I hate you, hate you\u2026..\u201dJing let Xiao Yao hit and yell at him while repeating \u201cI know you suffered a lot and I didn\u2019t keep my promise. I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u201dXiao Yao nestled in Jing\u2019s arms and kept on crying.By the time Xiao Yao stopped crying and calmed down, half an hour had pa.s.sed and the altar was empty, neither Xiao Yao nor Jing knew when everyone left. Clearly the Royal Mother succession ceremony wasn\u2019t going to be completed.Jing looked over Xiao Yao\u2019s Royal Mother outfit and his heart ached \u201cThank G.o.d I was in time!\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhere have you been all these years?\u201dJing explained \u201cHou forced me to duel and I secretly ate the life preserving pill you gave me beforehand. I wanted to jump into the water to escape and Hou kicking me in the water helped my plan along. But his kick was much stronger than expected and I fainted in the water. When I woke up it was five days ago at dawn on a deserted island in the East Sea. A mercouple saved me but I couldn\u2019t communicate in their language. We communicated in gestures and I figured out that they found me unconscious in the ocean and didn\u2019t know who I was or how to wake me. They placed me on the deserted island and fed me herbs from time to time. Luckily there are tons of strange treasures in the ocean and they accidentally chanced upon the right sea herbs to wake me up. I rushed back worried about you and only then did I learn 7 years had pa.s.sed. The Yellow Emperor told me you were not on Sheng Nong Mountain and told me to rush to Jade Mountain.\u201dXiao Yao wiped her tears \u201cI want to go thank the mercouple that saved you.\u201dJing sighed \u201cMerpeople live in the vast ocean without a set residence. When I left and asked how I could find them again, they just pointed to the ocean so I don\u2019t even know how to find them again.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cWe can look for them in the future, take our time, but now we need to go beg forgiveness from the Royal Mother.\u201dThe wind was softly blowing as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. Xiao Yao walked hand in hand with Jing and stared at him, as if confirmed that he really was beside her.Sir Bi walked up and Xiao Yao said to Jing \u201cThis is the Ah Bi I\u2019ve told you so much about.\u201dJing tried to bow low but Ah Bi dodged the courtesy and Xiao Yao didn\u2019t object because she knew the demons were strict with hierarchy. She smiled \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re here, come see the Royal Mother with us!\u201d\u201cHold off on seeing the Royal Mother, Zhuan Xu is on the cliff\u2026..\u201d Ah Bi let out a loud sigh \u201cYou guys need to go see him!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s smiled disappeared and she grabbed Jing\u2019s hand tightly as if afraid he would disappear. Jing squeezed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and said to Sir Bi \u201cWe\u2019ll go.\u201dSir Bi bowed to Jing before heading off.Xiao Yao tried to act nonchalant and said to Jing \u201cWait for me here, I\u2019ll go and be back quickly.\u201dJing asked \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go see His Majesty the Black Emperor?\u201dXiao Yao opened her mouth but couldn\u2019t get the words out.Jing said \u201cBefore going to Qing Shui Town, I brought extra secret guards just to be extra safe. But Hou\u2019s people actually took out all of the Tu Shan clan guards, that\u2019s something the Chi Sui clan leader can\u2019t even pull off! Back then I knew only one person in the entire world commanded such power, and because I guessed it was the Black Emperor that was why I kept trying to inch closer to the river as I battle Hou so I could use the river to get away because there must be more people waiting in Qing Shui Town to take me out.\u201dSo Jing already knew, and didn\u2019t need her to explain, so Xiao Yao sighed and lowered her head \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201dJing sighed as well and pulled Xiao Yao into his arms \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..you\u2026..you know the reason why Zhuan Xu wanted to kill you?\u201d\u201cEven if I didn\u2019t know then, I know now.\u201dXiao Yao murmured \u201cIf you know then you need to be careful. I\u2019ll go see him and after he leaves it\u2019ll be fine.\u201dJing said \u201cWhen I went to Sheng Nong Mountain to look for you, I talked with the Yellow Emperor and realized I made a big mistake as well. Let\u2019s go see the Black Emperor and talk things out.\u201dXiao Yao hesitated, not because she didn\u2019t want to see Zhuan Xu but because she was afraid!Jing said \u201cThe Black Emperor is the person you trust the most, don\u2019t let one mistake make you lose faith in him! Have you thought about why he was willing to let you marry Feng Long but tried to stop you from marrying me? He was just as pained in both instances.\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026.he thinks you\u2019re not as good as Feng Long.\u201dJing shook his head \u201cThat\u2019s just the surface reason, the most important reason is that His Majesty believes I don\u2019t have the ability to protect you! He\u2019s lost so much already, he could not place you in the care of someone weak. Tell me the way to the cliff!\u201dXiao Yao docilely led the way.Zhuan Xu stood at the edge of the cliff as if staring at something. Xiao Yao looked out in the same direction and only saw clouds.Xiao Yao softly asked \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dZhuan Xu didn\u2019t turn around but said warmly \u201cI can\u2019t see Xuan Yuan Mountain. From Xuan Yuan Mountain to Sheng Nong Mountain, I thought I had it all but looking back I realize I can\u2019t see the phoenix flowers on Cao Yun Peak anymore. No matter how many\u00a0phoenix trees I plant on Sheng Nong Mountain, it\u2019s not the same as the ones on Cao Yun Peak.\u201dXiao Yao replied \u201cStanding here of course you can\u2019t see it. You rule the entire world, if you want to see it you can go to Cao Yun Peak!\u201dZhuan Xu turned around and the moment he saw Xiao Yao he also saw the young man beside her, standing straight and composed.Jing bowed respectfully \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d After he straightened he took Xiao Yao\u2019s hand again and one white, one blue, they were like the moon and the forest, always beside each other.Zhuan Xu stared at them before looking past into the clouds once more.Xiao Yao thought Zhuan Xu would say something or ask something, but he didn\u2019t ask how Jing survived or what they planned to do. He was expressionless, with no sadness or anger. Jing was just as weird, silently standing there without explaining anything or taking his leave.Zhuan Xu and Jing, one was as solid as the mountain, the other as true as the tree, and Xiao Yao was just about to get anxious when Jing squeezed her hand in a.s.surance as if telling her not to rush things.Zhuan Xu slowly walked up to them and stared at Jing to ask \u201cWhen Feng Long was dying he told me that the idea to give up Xuan Yuan Mountain for Sheng Nong Mountain was yours. And that you convinced him to back me.\u201dJing candidly responded \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy conceal it from me?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think too much back then, all I wanted was to see Xiao Yao as soon as possible, so I gave the chance to Feng Long so he could accomplish his dreams.\u201d\u201cWhy help me? Only because of Xiao Yao?\u201d\u201cNo! When I first went out to do business, the Yellow Emperor had just united the Middle Plains and I followed the merchant groups to many places and saw people displaced by the war. I believed sincerely that the world needed a strong compa.s.sionate ruler, one who cared about the lives of all citizens. For Xiao Yao I could break from clan rules and not support the other princes, but I couldn\u2019t truly go against my clan and openly support Your Majesty as ruler. I did what I did because I know Your Majesty\u2019s magnanimous hope for the world and I remain steadfast in believing that my choice is correct. Even today I do not regret my choice, and I know Feng Long didn\u2019t as well. Our choice and determination to support you is the right one.\u201dZhuan Xu stared hard at Jing one last time before silently walking past Xiao Yao and heading down the cliffs. His guards surrounded him but everyone kept their distance, making his lone figure seem even more isolated.Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes followed Zhuan Xu until his form disappeared from sight, as if watching the most important and precious part of her life vanish forever. Her body trembled and ached from the pain in her heart so she grabbed her chest with one hand as she leaned on Jing\u2019s body for support.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Yao said to Jing \u201cThis is Lie Yang.\u201dJing bowed respectfully to Lie Yang who took stock of Jing before saying \u201cThe Royal Mother is awake. Go inside!\u201dJing and Xiao Yao entered the residence and saw the Royal Mother laying on the pallet with Sir Bi and Shui Hong beside her. Jing walked forward to bow \u201cJing respectfully greets the Royal Mother.\u201dThe Royal Mother coldly stared at him while drinking her wine, acting nonchalant.Jing kneeled down \u201cXiao Yao\u2019s mother entrusted Xiao Yao to Your Highness before she went off to war. Your Highness raised Xiao Yao for seventy years, and afterwards continued to look after her. It\u2019s proper for Xiao Yao to do your bidding but Xiao Yao is my wife and I cannot allow her to take over Jade Mountain.\u201dThe Royal Mother coldly huffed \u201cYou think being the Royal Mother of Jade Mountain is a job to take one day and discard the next?\u201d\u201dXiao Yao said down beside the Royal Mother and grabbed her arm \u201cMy good surrogate mother, can you stop tormenting him for fun!\u201dThe Royal Mother sighed and barked at Jing \u201cGet up! When a girl is grown she flies the coop, there is nothing to keep her anyways!\u201d\u201cThank Your Highness!\u201d Jing bowed his head three times before getting up.Shui Hong asked \u201cIf Xiao Yao isn\u2019t going to take over Jade Mountain, who will be the next Royal Mother?\u201dThe Royal Mother glanced at Sir Bi who spoke \u201cI already sent a carrier bird to notify Bai Zhi, the ceremony can delay a few days with no problem.\u201d\u201cBai Zhi?\u201d Shui Hong thought and sighed \u201cShe is very suitable indeed.\u201dThe Royal Mother said \u201cSince you don\u2019t object, then so be it! Send the notice to the world during the succession ceremony that Bai Zhi will become the next Royal Mother, ruler of Jade Mountain.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Shui Hong bowed before leaving.The Royal Mother asked Xiao Yao and Jing \u201cWhat are your plans next?\u201dJing looked at Xiao Yao who smiled back \u201cYour Highness said that where one\u2019s heart is at ease then that is home. The world is so vast, we will find a place for us away from it all.\u201dThe Royal Mother nodded \u201cIf one\u2019s heart is at peace then anywhere can become a home. You guys pack up and leave then!\u201dXiao Yao spoke up \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave! I want\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know, you want to see me pa.s.s on.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, I\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Royal Mother raised her hand up \u201cYou all want to be with me when I die but I don\u2019t want you to see me die.\u201dXiao Yao and Sir Bi could not contain their sadness as Xiao Yao said \u201cI want to stay a few more days.\u201d\u201cWhatever you want! I\u2019m tired and you all\u2026\u2026.\u201d The Royal Mother was about to send them away when Sir Bi coughed slightly to remind her, so the Royal Mother suddenly changed topics \u201cYou guys know there is a voodoo bug in Xiao Yao\u2019s body?\u2019Xiao Yao\u2019s expression dimmed so Jing replied \u201cWe know.\u201dThe Royal Mother said \u201cWhen Xiao Yao was unconscious, I discovered the voodoo bug in her and broke the spell. You guys don\u2019t have a problem with that, right?\u201dJing was ecstatic and stuttered a bit \u201cYou mean, Your Highness got rid of the voodoo bug from Xiao Yao\u2019s body?\u201dThe Royal Mother coldly stared \u201cAre you doubting me?\u201dJing quickly said \u201cNo! No! I\u2019m just too happy is all!\u201d The Royal Mother was aloof and didn\u2019t say much but whatever she said was always true, so if she said she broke the voodoo spell then clearly it was now broken.Xiao Yao\u2019s heart was jumbled \u2013 when Xiang Liu tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate Zhuan Xu and killed Feng Long, she already repaid all her debt to Xiang Liu by giving her blood. She severed all ties with him then, but hearing now that the final last bit of connection between them was broken when she wasn\u2019t even aware of it, she couldn\u2019t figure out what this sense of loss meant. She mocked herself \u201cHe always saw you as just a chess piece, what\u2019s there to feel bereft about? Are you sad about his cold heartlessness?\u201dThe Royal Mother wearily closed her eyes and waved her hand so Jing and Xiao Yao took their leave and Sir Bi went out as well.Inside the peach blossom forest, Sir Bi asked \u201cThings happened so quickly to ask what happened, but who saved you, Jing, and why so long before coming back?\u201dJing explained about the mercouple in the East Sea and Sir Bi\u2019s mind roiled after hearing it. The Nine-headed demon is the supreme power in the ocean, totally able to command the merpeople to do his bidding. And finding merpeople who could not communicate in the human language, and who lived in the vast ocean, Xiang Liu was cruel and brilliant in saving Jing without ever leaving a way to be discovered.Xiao Yao asked \u201cAh Bi, what\u2019s wrong? Why is your expression so strange?\u201dSir Bi quickly covered up \u201cNothing!\u201dTwo days later, Bai Zhi arrived on Jade Mountain and the succession ceremony went off without a hitch. The proclamation went out to the world that a new Royal Mother had taken over Jade Mountain.The next morning Xiao Yao went to pay a visit to the Royal Mother but Shui Hong barred her outside.\u201cAh Mei has pa.s.sed.\u201dIt took Xiao Yao a moment to realize that Ah Mei was the Royal Mother\u2019s worldly name.Shui Hong said \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, she pa.s.sed peacefully in her sleep with a smile on her face. I think she saw the people she wanted to see in her dream.\u201dShui Hong said to Jing \u201cYou\u2019ve stayed three days on Jade Mountain, please depart before sundown today.\u201dJing pulled a wobbly Xiao Yao away as she wondered if letting go of all worries was what allowed the Royal\u00a0Mother to pa.s.s so quickly.Without the Royal Mother around, Xiao Yao and Jing had no reason to stay on Jade Mountain so made plans to depart.Lie Yang and Sir Bi came to send them off and she asked them \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201dLie Yang and Sir Bi glanced at each other before Sir Bi said \u201cWe are used to living on Jade Mountain and plan to stay. What about you two?\u201dXiao Yao glanced at Jing \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed it but will likely go to Qing Qiu first to handle matters.\u201dSir Bi said \u201cPlease let me know when a wedding date is set.\u201dJing replied \u201cOf course!\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cThen\u2026..we\u2019re off now.\u201dSir Bi said to Jing \u201cPlease take good care of Xiao Yao.\u201dJing bowed low as if to an elder \u201cI will take good care of Xiao Yao.\u201dLie Yang didn\u2019t give a fig so accepted the bow but Sir Bi dodged it, demon cla.s.s barriers were strict and the nine-tailed fox was the king of the fox tribe. When Sir Bi was around Jing, he used his strong powers to tamp down the instinctive to be subservient to Jing.Xiao Yao and Jing arrived in Qing Qiu late at night. Xiao Yao asked \u201cWant to rest before going to the Tu Shan residence?\u201d\u201cGo now so to not alert as many people.\u201dWhen Xiao Yao and Jing appeared before Hu Zhen and Jing Ye, both were so startled they couldn\u2019t speak. Jing smiled \u201cWhat? Not happy to see me?\u201dJing Ye collapsed on the ground in tears \u201cMaster! Master\u2026\u2026..\u201dHu Zhen composed himself and bowed \u201cClan leader, please sit!\u201dJing laughed \u201cCall my name, I\u2019m not the Clan leader anymore!\u201dXiao Yao helped Jing Ye up \u201cWhat\u2019s with the tears? Aren\u2019t you happy Jing is back?\u201dJing lightly coughed as he remembered someone wailing and sobbing for hours a few days ago and shot a glance at Xiao Yao.Jing asked Hu Zhen \u201cHow is Zhen Er?\u201d\u201cGood, very good!\u201d Hu Zhen recounted all that happened to make Tu Shan Zhen the new clan leader and finished \u201cThe new Clan leader may be the son of Tu Shan Hou and Fang Feng Yi Yang, but he was raised by you so has your bearing, I believe he will be a great clan leader.\u201dJing Ye added \u201cWe decided to tell him the truth because of all the rumors being circulated and he was bound to hear it. We handed him the letter from Fang Feng Yi Yang early and after learning his birth secret he was so devastated for some time. But he composed himself and accepted that his birth parents were in the wrong and still calls you dad and refers to Hou as his uncle.\u201dJing said \u201cDeath ends everything so when you guys have time tell him stories of my brother when we were young and how close we were. Let him understand that my brother had his own reason for doing what he did, and that it was his grandmother who was wrong in the first.\u201dJing Ye hated Hou so much but now that Jing was back she was able to start letting go \u201cI will do so.\u201dHu Zhen saw through the underlying request \u201cWhy not you tell him? Are you planning to leave Qing Qiu?\u201dJing smiled \u201cTonight I came to say my farewells.\u201dJing Ye started crying again as Hu Zhen asked \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dJing glanced at Xiao Yao \u201cI go wherever Xiao Yao goes.\u201dHu Zhen held back saying more, now the Tu Shan clan was stable and the road that Jing and Xiao Yao took was so long and arduous.Jing handed two jade cannisters to Hu Zhen \u201cOne is for Zhen Er and the other to the clan elders.\u201dHu Zhen took it carefully \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will protect and serve the clan leader until he is all grown up.\u201dJing held Xiao Yao\u2019s hand as they stood up together.Jing Ye cried \u201cMaster, you\u2026..you\u2026.\u201dJing laughed \u201cYou\u2019re married now, why so quick to cry still? Hu Zhen, come take care of your wife!\u201dJing turned around to leave but Jing Ye cried out \u201cMaster please wait!\u201d Jing Ye knew that she would never see Jing again after tonight \u201cMaster, your servant I will not be able to serve you anymore, please accept three bows from me.\u201dJing Ye kneeled down and cried as she bowed her head three times to the ground. The grat.i.tude of being taken in when she was child, the years of education and consideration\u2026\u2026.without Jing she would not be the person she was today.After accepting Jing Ye\u2019s three bows, Jing smiled at Hu Zhen with a nod and stepped out of the room with Xiao Yao in hand.Jing Ye rushed out in tears \u201cMaster\u2026\u2026.Master\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d All she saw was a bright moon in the dark sky and a white crane flying away with two figures on its back. It few higher and farther until it vanished in a gust of wind.The second day around noon, Xiao Yao and Jing arrived in Xuan Yuan Castle.The White Emperor was not at Xuan Yuan Mountain so Xiao Yao went directly to the blacksmith shop in the castle to look for him. Jing stopped her \u201cLet\u2019s find an inn to wash up first and rest a night, tomorrow go pay our respects to the White Emperor.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cWhy?\u201dJing hesitated before saying in a lower voice \u201cIt\u2019s better to tidy up before going to see my father-in-law.\u201dXiao Yao held back her laugh and nodded \u201cGood idea, rus.h.i.+ng this whole time my young master is undoubtedly not looking his best.\u201dJing grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s arm and rushed into the inn.After the two rested up, the next morning they put on their best and headed to the blacksmith shop at the end of a dingy alley.It was already bustling this early in the morning in the big streets but quiet and desolate headed into the alley. Jing knocked on the door and Miao Pu\u2019s voice called out \u201cWho is it? Wanting services this early in this morning, come back later!\u201dXiao Yao shushed Jing and kept pounding loudly on the door. She thought Miao Pu would rush out angrily but a figure descended from the roof flying towards Xiao Yao and Jing and startled them instead. Jing pulled Xiao Yao into his arms and readied to repeal the attack but Xiao Yao stopped him \u201cLeft Ear! Stop!\u201dThe figure halted and Jing pulled back his power. Before Xiao Yao could introduce the two, Miao Pu came rus.h.i.+ng out sobbing as she grabbed Xiao Yao who had to comfort her \u201cThere there, don\u2019t cry\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter some time Miao Pu stopped crying and looked up and noticed Jing. She yelped loudly in fear and rushed towards Left Ear while pulling Xiao Yao with her. Xiao Yao was pushed behind Left Eat along with Miao Pu who asked Jing \u201cWho\u2026..who are you?\u201dJing smiled \u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d\u201cMaster Jing? You\u2019re alive?\u201dXiao Yao rapped Miao Pu on the head \u201cHow could you have ever been a secret bodyguard, being such a goose like this!\u201dXiao Yao walked back to Jing and held his hand before saying to Left Ear \u201cThis is Jing.\u201dLeft Ear had already checked out Jing from head to toe \u201cYou\u2019re not dead. Good.\u201d He turned and walked inside with no intention of making small talk.Xiao Yao made a face at Jing \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make introductions to guess who that is.\u201dThey walked inside and saw the White Emperor sitting at his chair. He didn\u2019t raise an eyebrow to see Jing, much less freak out.Jing and Xiao Yao walked up to him and kneeled down to bow three times. Jing said \u201cI came back late and caused worry for Your Majesty.\u201dThe White Emperor nodded his head \u201cNo worry for me, it\u2019s all on Xiao Yao.\u201dJing nervously replied \u201cI understand.\u201dThe White Emperor said \u201cAs long as you understand, you can take your time making it up to her.\u201dJing\u2019s nervousness dissipated \u201cI will do so!\u201d\u201cBoth get up now!\u201dXiao Yao saw the White Emperor continuing to ignore her and giggled \u201cDad, what skills did you teach Left Ear?\u201dThe White Emperor coldly said \u201cYou bank on me not being able to leave Xuan Yuan Mountain and try to fool me. Explain now why you send those two to me, and beg me to keep them by my side for ten years. Why did Zhuan Xu suddenly go to Yang Valley? And why did Zhuan Xu say you\u2019re not feeling well? Within a month, Zhuan Xu went to Jade Mountain twice, what\u2019s with such unusual behavior?\u201dXiao Yao opened her mouth but couldn\u2019t say anything. She didn\u2019t want her dad to know what Zhuan Xu did, that was between her and Zhuan Xu and even her closest dad she didn\u2019t want him to know.Jing understood and stepped in to help \u201cXiao Yao, you go catch up with Left Ear and Miao Pu, let me talk privately with His Majesty.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Xiao Yao ran off with Left Ear and Miao Pu like a burden was lifted, heading to the kitchen to chat with Miao Pu as she prepared breakfast.When breakfast was ready, the talk was over and the White Emperor wasn\u2019t ignoring Xiao Yao anymore. Xiao Yao tugged on Jing\u2019s sleeve and whispered \u201cWhat did you talk about with my dad??Jing smiled and said nothing while ladling a bowl of soup for Xiao Yao.She held it in until after breakfast when the White Emperor went to greet a customer. Xiao Yao hurriedly asked Jing \u201cDid you tell my dad the truth?\u201d\u201cOf course not! You don\u2019t want people to know so I wouldn\u2019t have said it.\u201dXiao Yao sighed in relief \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d But then she mused \u201cIf you didn\u2019t tell him then why is he not pressing me about what happened.\u201d\u201cI told His Majesty that everything that has happened is in the past. Since you and I are both safe and sound today, then there is no need to dig into the past to find out everything. What\u2019s important is working towards securing a peaceful happy future.\u201d\u201cJust that and my dad stopped digging for the truth?\u201dJing said \u201cHis Majesty is now just a blacksmith, but in the past he ruled a nation and there is much he must have already figured out. He was pressing you back there not because he really wanted to get to the truth, but because he was so hurt that so much happened and you never thought to ask him for help.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I entrust Miao Pu and Left Ear to him?\u201dJing stared at Xiao Yao and said nothing.Xiao Yao lowered her head sheepishly \u201cI know Dad, Lie Yang, and Ah Bi are all so good to me, but this is between me and Zhuan Xu and I don\u2019t want anyone involved!\u201dJing leaned down to gently kiss Xiao Yao on the forehead \u201cWe\u2019re not blaming you, we\u2019re just so pained to see you this way.\u201dXiao Yao embraced Jing\u2019s waist \u201cI know.\u201dThe two quietly embraced for some time before Xiao Yao asked \u201cIf you got Dad to stop being mad at me with one sentence, what else were you two talking about for so long?\u201dJing smiled \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t ask. What do you think would lead us two guys talking for so long.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cSmart girl!\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her brows \u201cI\u2019m getting a bad vibe from this. Fess up and tell me what you talked about?\u201d\u201cWe talked about when I can start called His Majesty Dad.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face turned beet red but she kept a straight face and asked \u201cSo did you guys reach a conclusion?\u201dJing caressed Xiao Yao\u2019s cheek and said also in a straight face \u201cThis color is certainly pretty but isn\u2019t enough to be bridal makeup by itself.\u201dXiao Yao couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and burst out laughing, holding her face in one hand and smacking Jing with the other. \u201cTell me! If you don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m leaving, who cares to hear it anyway!\u201dJing grabbed Xiao Yao\u2019s hand \u201cI have no parents, no power or wealth, other than my body I have nothing else. You only have a few relatives left now, so after talking with your dad we set the wedding for four days hence. It\u2019s an auspicious time and the small ceremony will take place on Cao Yun Peak. Do you like that?\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes shone with tears as she nodded \u201cYes!\u201dFour days later, on Xuan Yuan Mountain.The wild flowers and overgrown gra.s.s blanketed the side of the mountain where six graves were placed neatly.Xiao Yao ambled along the curvy path up the side of the mountain, standing in the middle of the brilliantly hued wild flowers to stare at the graves in the distance before gathering up the courage to continuing walking there.Xiao Yao kneeled before Lei Zhu\u2019s grave \u201cGrandmother, I\u2019m here to see you.\u201dShe cleaned the grave while talking \u201cGrandmother, I\u2019m getting married. I wanted to bring him here but Dad says I can\u2019t see him before the ceremony so I\u2019ll bring him tomorrow to see you.\u201dXiao Yao grew silent as she plucked the weeds and slowly her tears began to fall. Since she was a child, every trip to the graves was with Zhuan Xu. With someone beside her to help share in the pain, even sorrow seemed less heavy. This was her first trip here solo and so many memories from the past came flooding back\u2026\u2026When her grandmother was dying, her mother and her eldest aunt sat beside the bed day and night. Auntie Ju Li had her sleep on the same pallet as Zhuan Xu so she could watch them more conveniently. Xiao Yao had a vague understanding of death but she had never experienced it in person before so didn\u2019t have any feelings about it. But Zhuan Xu had seen his mother commit suicide right in front of him, and he was raised beside his grandmother since he was born, so his sadness was far greater than hers. He was always afraid that grandmother would be dead when he was sleeping so he couldn\u2019t sleep soundly. Sometimes he woke up unconsciously, other times deliberately, and Xiao Yao would wake with him and got used to it. Every time he woke up, she would do as her mother did with her and comfort Zhuan Xu to go back to sleep. She would embrace him and softly pat his back, croon a lullaby to him even as her eyes were closed because she was so tired.That night Zhuan Xu woke up again and got dressed before waking Xiao Yao \u201cGrandmother is near death.\u201d He got her robe to dress her.Xiao Yao was so sleepy she curled into the blanket \u201cIt\u2019s just a nightmare, I\u2019ll sing to you.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cXiao Yao, be good! Stop sleeping and get dressed to go see Grandmother one last time so she doesn\u2019t worry. In the future\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhuan Xu started crying.Xiao Yao scrambled up and got dressed \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, I\u2019m up now.\u201d Xiao Yao brushed the tears from Zhuan Xu\u2019s face \u201cLook at you, such a crybaby, I never cry!\u201dZhuan Xu awkwardly turned his head and Xiao Yao quickly added \u201cOnly you know, I know, the sky knows, and the ground knows, I will never tell anyone else!\u201dJust as Xiao Yao got dressed Auntie Ju Li rushed into the room intending to wake the kids and was shocked to see them standing hand-in-hand by the door. She didn\u2019t think more of it and grabbed them both \u201cWe need to see Her Highness the Empress. Remember, whatever she says to you both, listen carefully and remember always.\u201dAs they entered the room, her mom and her big aunt each picked one child up and placed them beside their grandmother.Grandmother took the two kids hands and put them together \u201cYou both are such good kids, but also such tragic fated kids. No matter how the world treats you, you will forever be each other\u2019s closest and dearest person. No matter what happens, you will never leave or abandon each other. You must always take care of each other, as long as there is one person to rely on then no matter how hard the road ahead is you can get over it.\u201dAfter speaking their grandmother started to violently cough and her hand tightened around Zhuan Xu and Xiao Yao\u2019s hands. Xiao Yao thought that death was just going to sleep and never waking up, which meant her grandmother would not be able to read stories to her or help her when Zhuan Xu was being mean to her\u2026\u2026 Xiao Yao\u2019s tears fell and she murmured \u201cGrandmother, I don\u2019t want you to die, I don\u2019t want you to die\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu had no tears and was like an adult as he said \u201cI will remember what Grandmother said.\u201dHer grandmother stared at Xiao Yao waiting for her response but Xiao Yao didn\u2019t really even understand what her grandmother said and kept crying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to die, I don\u2019t want you to die\u2026\u2026..\u201dHer grandmother wanted to repeat it again but she couldn\u2019t talk with all the coughing. Zhuan Xu anxiously wrenched Xiao Yao\u2019s ear which hurt so bad she stopped crying. Zhuan Xu stared at Xiao Yao and repeated each word carefully \u201cGrandmother we both are such good kids, but also such tragic fated kids. No matter how the world treats us, we will forever be each other\u2019s closest and dearest person. No matter what happens, we will never leave or abandon each other. We must always take care of each other. Do you remember all of this?\u201dXiao Yao held her tears in and nodded her head.Zhuan Xu said \u201cRepeat it to Grandmother.\u201dXiao Yao repeated Zhuan Xu\u2019s words to her grandmother who continued to hold their hands tightly as if she had millions more things to say to them, but in the end she said through her coughs directly to Zhuan Xu \u201cZhuan Xu, in the future do not let anyone be mean to Xiao Yao, you have to protect her.\u201dZhuan Xu solemnly vowed \u201cI will remember and protect my little sister!\u201dXiao Yao huffed, Zhuan Xu couldn\u2019t even beat her in a fight, she would be the one who took care of Zhuan Xu and made sure no one was mean to him!Grandmother gestured to Auntie Ju Li to take the kids out and let her speak with Xiao Yao\u2019s mom and their big aunt.Xiao Yao and Zhuan Xu stood outside for a while until they heard their eldest aunt sobbing. Zhuan Xu held Xiao Yao\u2019s hand and ran back inside and they saw their grandmother with her eyes closed in peace.Zhuan Xu kneeled down silently with no tears as he big down hard on his lips.Xiao Yao called out for her grandmother but got no response and started wailing\u2026\u2026.A hand reached out to join Xiao Yao in cleaning the weeds and she raised her head to see Zhuan Xu through her hazy tears.He was calm and collected with his lips pursed, just like when he was a child. Xiao Yao felt all the sadness bubble up and she burst out sobbing.Zhuan Xu kept his head down and continued to clear the weeds until he was all done. He walked up to Xiao Yao and wrenched her ear \u201cOkay, stop crying! If you keep crying then Grandmother will think that I\u2019m forcing marrying you off!\u201dXiao Yao grabbed her stinging ear and stared at Zhuan Xu in a daze.Zhuan Xu turned his head and walked over to their Eldest Uncle\u2019s grave and bowed three times. He also bowed three times to Auntie Ju Li\u2019s grave beside it. He then cleared the weeds and Xiao Yao wiped her tears and walked over to join him. After bowing three times she started wiping down the tombs.Each did their tasks silently though Xiao Yao snuck a few peeks at Zhuan Xu but he never once glanced over at her.After finis.h.i.+ng the graves of their eldest uncle and eldest aunt, they went to clean their second uncle\u2019s grave. Xiao Yao followed and they did the same there.After she finished she sat down crossed legged watching Zhuan Xu plucking weeds with his head lowered.Xiao Yao bit her lip before asking \u201cThat night, how did you know Grandmother was about to die?\u201dZhuan Xu replied \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, I just woke up suddenly and felt uneasy and afraid. The first time I felt that way, the next morning I heard your mom saying that my dad died in battle. The second time it was right before my mom committed suicide.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAfter finis.h.i.+ng their second uncle\u2019s grave, Zhuan Xu walked over to the joint tomb of his parents and kneeled down.Xiao Yao went to the creek to fetch a pail of water and when she got back Zhuan Xu was still silently kneeling.Xiao Yao kneeled down and bowed three times \u201cFourth Uncle, Fourth Auntie, I\u2019m here with Zhuan Xu to see you.\u201d She grabbed a towel to wipe down the tomb but Zhuan Xu said \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dXiao Yao handed him the towel and sat down to watch him clean. She heard that when Fourth Aunt committed suicide her blood spilled all over the grave so this area had no weeds growing and instead was covered with bright red flowers.After Zhuan Xu finished wiping he kneeled down and bowed three times \u201cMom, I don\u2019t hate you anymore. You said that one day I would meet a girl who I want to give the ruo mu flower to, and then I would understand why you did it. I\u2019ve met her, Mom, and you told me that when I met her I need to bring her here so you and Dad can see her. I brought her here, Mom, and I know you and Dad will like her very much.\u201dZhuan Xu turned to Xiao Yao \u201cCome here!\u201dXiao Yao stood frozen \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dZhuan Xu opened his hand and in his palm was a bright red flower with a long stem and folded petals, brilliantly beautiful like it was just plucked. It was the Ruo Mu Clan\u2019s mystical Ruo Mu tree and the flower that grew on it. Since the dawn of time the flower was only worn by the clan leader or the clan leader\u2019s wife. Xiao Yao remembered that her Fourth Aunt always wore the flower in her hair pin. And on the day she committed suicide she handed the flower to Zhuan Xu.Zhuan Xu said \u201cXiao Yao, come here so my dad and mom can see you clearly.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t move and instead started to scoot back and Zhuan Xu coolly said \u201cIf you want the wedding to be cancelled then go ahead and leave.\u201dXiao Yao angrily made a fist but moved next to Zhuan Xu while glaring at him.Zhuan Xu looked her over and placed the ruo mu flower in her hair and smiled \u201cReally pretty! Mom, what do you think?\u201dXiao Yao was about to say something when Zhuan Xu put his hand on her head \u201cBow!\u201dIt was to her Fourth Uncle and Fourth Auntie so Xiao Yao didn\u2019t resist, she kneeled beside Zhuan Xu and the two respectfully bowed three times. After the third bow Xiao Yao suddenly felt weird, it was just like she and Zhuan Xu were a couple getting married and bowing three times to the parents during the wedding ceremony.Xiao Yao asked \u201cZhuan Xu, what do you want?\u201dZhuan Xu said nothing and got up, walking over to Xiao Yao\u2019s mom\u2019s grave and started cleaning it.Xiao Yao wanted to take out the ruo mu flower and toss it but it was her Fourth Auntie\u2019s precious item\u2026..Xiao Yao didn\u2019t dare and didn\u2019t have the heart to. She rushed over to Zhuan Xu and perhaps because this was her mom\u2019s grave she got up her courage and yelled \u201cZhuan Xu, I know you\u2019re not suddenly deaf! What do you want? Today tell me in front of my mom, your parents, grandmother, and our uncles!\u201dZhuan Xu coolly said \u201cAfter I clean up Auntie\u2019s grave.\u201dAll the air deflated from Xiao Yao and she sat down dutifully and stared at Zhuan Xu.After Zhuan Xu plucked all the weeds and cleaned the tomb, he dug a hole and buried a knife inside.Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but ask \u201cWhat are you burying?\u201d\u201cThis is your dad\u2019s military knife. It\u2019s called the Qi Yo Knife and many people who hated your dad spent time trying to acquire it. I had it found and brought to me to bury it now with Auntie\u2019s battle armor. Later when you come to pray at the grave it will finally feel like closure.\u201dXiao Yao was so touched and could say nothing.Zhuan Xu fixed the grave and then gestured for Xiao Yao to come over.Xiao Yao kneeled in front of the grave as did Zhuan Xu who said \u201cAuntie, Uncle, today Xiao Yao will marry Tu Shan Jing. You guys don\u2019t need to worry, he\u2019s not bad and will take good care of Xiao Yao.\u201dXiao Yao turned in shock to gape at Zhuan Xu who looked at her \u201cAren\u2019t you going to bow to your mom and dad?\u201dXiao Yao and Zhuan Xu kneeled side by side and bowed three times to her mom and dad.Xiao Yao stood up and was going to rush back and change. She touched the ruo mu flower on her head to take it off.Zhuan Xu said \u201cThis flower is now yours and keep it safe. It\u2019s not just a powerful mystical flower, it\u2019s also the token of the Ruo Mu Clan. No matter when or where this flower can command the entire clan\u2019s military might.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s heart softened \u201cGege, you\u2026\u2026.you\u2026..did you come to attend the wedding and give me your blessings\u2026\u2026.or\u2026\u2026\u2026or, you know Fourth Auntie wanted you to give this flower to your wife\u2026..\u201dZhuan Xu asked \u201cDo you want to successfully marry Tu Shan Jing today?\u201dXiao Yao turned to look across at all the graves \u201cI do!\u201d\u201cThen promise me one thing and from this day forward I am only your Gege.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI agree!\u201d But she asked \u201cTell me what first.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cWear this flower every day for the rest of your life.\u201dThis easy? Xiao Yao touched the flower and thought \u201cOkay, I promise you!\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cIn a short while during the wedding you can\u2019t take it off either!\u201dXiao Yao furrowed her brows \u201cDon\u2019t be so difficult!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the ruler of the entire world, and this is me taking the biggest step back already!\u201d Zhuan Xu\u2019s face was impa.s.sive and his voice steady.Xiao Yao stomped her foot \u201cFine fine! I\u2019ll wear it and I\u2019m going to view it as Fourth Auntie\u2019s present to me!\u201dZhuan Xu smiled \u201cWhatever you want, you just have to always wear it!\u201dXiao Yao glanced at the sun \u201cIt\u2019s almost the auspicious hour and I have to hurry!\u201d She ran off but then came running back until she stood before Zhuan Xu all out of breath \u201cFrom now on you\u2019re still my Gege, and it\u2019s the Gege that Grandmother asked you to be, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou mean it?\u201dZhuan Xu glanced over across the six graves \u201cDo I dare not mean it here?\u201dXiao Yao wanted to smile but instead started to cry. She reached out her pinky and Zhuan Xu did the same and the pinky swore. When they were kids and about to do something naughty they would first pinky swear.Xiao Yao wiped her tears and run off while yelling \u201cZhuan Xu, don\u2019t you dare be late!\u201dZhuan Xu watched until Xiao Yao was gone from sight before he looked away.He glanced at the six graves \u2013 everyone was his and Xiao Yao\u2019s dearest family members. In this moment Zhuan Xu at last completely believed what Feng Long said before he died, that the idea to abandon Xuan Yuan Mountain for Sheng Nong Mountain was an idea that Jing came up with. He knew that the only place in the entire world that Xiao Yao could successfully get married was Xuan Yuan Mountain.On this mountain were all the happy memories he shared with his little sister Xiao Yao. Here a happy carefree little Zhuan Xu lost his father and saw his mother commit suicide. He tearfully sent his grandmother off and painfully watched his aunt go to war. It was here that he had no choice but to allow Xiao Yao be sent away. Xuan Yuan Mountain was so big yet there was no place for Xiao Yao to live safely. He blamed no one, only himself for being so weak and small.When news of his aunt\u2019s battle death reached him, he kneeled the entire night in front of his grandmother and parents graves. He knew Xiao Yao would be so scared and devastated and he wanted so badly to go pick her up and spend day and night with her just like she did with him. But he saw in the eyes of his royal uncles flashes of death and he finally understood his auntie\u2019s words, that he had not the power yet to protect Xiao Yao.That night he vowed that he would never ever lose the final family member he had left! He would become powerful, more powerful than anyone else so that no one could harm his final family member. He would go to Jade Mountain to pick up Xiao Yao and protect her!But life is so ironic, he started the path to become Emperor to protect Xiao Yao, but when he overcame all obstacles and arrived at his goal he lost her along the way!Zhuan Xu softly spoke to all his relatives \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t keep my promise from that day anymore. I need to let another man take care of our Xiao Yao now! His name is Tu Shan Jing and he is kind and more clever than anyone. He is also completely devoted to Xiao Yao. Handing her to his care will disappoint you guys, so please be a.s.sured!\u201dThe wind rustled through the graves. Thousands of years, all the scheming, plotting, fighting\u2026\u2026.everyone was dead but in the end he and Xiao Yao survived, they not only survived they were living well!Zhuan Xu turned and walked off with a steady foot towards the sunlight path.Miao Pu finished dressing Xiao Yao in her wedding dress \u201cSo beautiful!\u201dXiao Yao glanced at herself in the water mirror and mocked \u201cMy third time putting on wedding attire!\u201dMiao Pu laughed \u201cThis time will be a success.\u201dXiao Yao asked \u201cDo you know who was invited?\u201dMiao Pu shook her head \u201cHis Majesty and Master are both very secretive but it can\u2019t be a big group because the kitchen is making food for no more than ten people.\u201dXiao Yao sighed in relief \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThe music reached them as the maids came to get the bride.Miao Pu placed the phoenix crown on Xiao Yao\u2019s head as the jewels draped over her face and she helped Xiao Yao walk out.As Xiao Yao neared the grand hall she sensed someone beside her but couldn\u2019t turn her head to look and started to get nervous until a hand reached over to take hers.It\u2019s Jing! Xiao Yao relaxed and couldn\u2019t help but smile.The two walked hand-in-hand into the grand hall of Cao Yun Court and through her beaded head curtains Xiao Yao glimpsed the Yellow Emperor sitting in the center, the White Emperor to his life a step below, and Zhuan Xu even further below to his right. Beside Zhuan Xu sat Ah Nian while Ah Bi and Lie Yang sat beside the White Emperor.Xiao Yao was stunned and forgot protocol, pulling aside her head cover and asked \u201cGrandfather, why are you here?\u201dThe Yellow Emperor acted insulted \u201cWhat do you mean why am I here? I\u2019m not welcome?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026.no, of course not! I just thought if Zhuan Xu was here then you couldn\u2019t come, and I was very sad about that\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Yellow Emperor laughed \u201cZhuan Xu and I traveled separately, and after your ceremony I\u2019ll leave immediately so it\u2019s not a problem.\u201dXiao Yao looked at the three Emperors sitting there and felt both strange and happy.The ceremony started and Xiao Yao and Jing performed the marriage rites.The first bow to the HeavensThe second bow to the Elders. Xiao Yao and Jing got on their knees and bowed, rising after the Yellow Emperor and White Emperor gestured.The third bow to each other and Xiao Yao looked at Jing for the first time but was so embarra.s.sed she kept her eyes lowered.The officiant declared them married and Xiao Yao was in such a daze. She and Jing were married? Like that? What\u2019s she supposed to after that?The servants brought out the meal and the White Emperor said \u201cThe Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu are leaving shortly so no need for protocol. Jing and Xiao Yao, come here.\u201dJing removed Xiao Yao\u2019s heavy headpiece and took her hand to walk over and sit down below the White Emperor.Jing poured them each a cup and the two newlyweds toasted the Yellow Emperor and the White Emperor.When it was time to toast Zhuan Xu, Xiao Yao was nervous but Jing and Zhuan Xu were perfectly composed.Jing bowed with a toast and Zhuan Xu picked up his cup and said \u201cI used your strategy and you took my most precious treasure, let\u2019s call it even.\u201dZhuan Xu gulped the wine down and Jing bowed low \u201cThank Your Majesty.\u201dXiao Yao toasted Zhuan Xu, looking like she had a lot to say but also didn\u2019t know where to start, so she just gulped down her wine and Zhuan Xu followed. He said \u201cHusband and wife with hearts as one, wis.h.i.+ng love and happiness until both hair all white.\u201dXiao Yao stared at Zhuan Xu and knew from his voice and the sincerely wished her and Jing well.Zhuan Xu warmly said \u201cOnly if you are well does my world have purpose.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s eyes reddened and she said \u201cyou\u2026\u2026you have to be well too!\u201dXiao Yao pulled Jing over to Lie Yang and Ah Bi, who wanted to leave when Jing bowed low but Xiao Yao stopped him as Jing said \u201cI am Xiao Yao\u2019s husband and respectfully greeting you both as her elders.\u201dAh Bi stood there stiffly and accepted the bow while Lie Yang remained sitting all confidently receiving the toast.Ah Bi drank the wine and said with a smile \u201cYour mom and dad is for sure very happy.\u201dXiao Yao and Jing walked over to AH Nian who quickly stood up. Xiao Yao joked \u201cEven though you are the Empress now, I\u2019m still the older sister at this family gathering so you toast us!\u201dAh Nian laughed \u201cBig sister and brother-in-law, I\u2019m not letting this toast go!\u201dXiao Yao and Jing poured a cup of wine and toasted Ah Nian who said \u201cI wish big sister and brother-in-law a lifetime of love and togetherness!\u201dAh Nian then poured a toast to Xiao Yao \u201cMany years ago you gave me a beat down with two paths to go, neither of us could have imagined we would walk a third path! You are a very good big sister, taking care of me, and I can say today that I was a good little sister back.\u201dXiao Yao didn\u2019t think too deep into what Ah Nian said as she gulped down her wine.After the toasts everyone finished the meal and the Emperors got ready to return to Sheng Nong Mountain.Walking them out, Xiao Yao suddenly called out \u201cGege, can I speak privately with you?\u201dEveryone continued walking leaving Xiao Yao standing there with Zhuan Xu as she said \u201cI heard that Ru So\u2019s relentless attack has backed Gong Gong\u2019s army into the corner.\u201dZhuan Xu said \u201cI was planning on a slow attrition to minimize casualties but Feng Long\u2019s death has left me no choice but to launch a full on a.s.sault.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cGege, can you\u2026\u2026can you\u2026\u2026spare Xiang Liu?\u201dZhuan Xu was shocked \u201cHe killed Feng Long, don\u2019t you want to avenge his death?\u201d\u201cKilling Xiang Liu won\u2019t bring Feng Long back.\u201dZhuan Xu stared long and hard at Xiao Yao as she continued \u201cI know you are in a tough spot, but I\u2019ve never asked you for a favor when it\u2019s difficult for you. This is my first, and last time, begging you for something.\u201d\u201cXiang Liu is Fang Feng Bei, right?\u201d Zhuan Xu appeared to be asking Xiao Yao but his expression was certain.Xiao Yao didn\u2019t want to hide it anymore and woefully nodded.\u201cSo that\u2019s it! No wonder I\u2019ve felt that certain things were so odd, but now it all makes sense. Are you two still seeing each other?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve severed all ties, I never want to see him again in this lifetime and he certainly will also never want to see me! But no matter how he\u2019s treated me\u2026\u2026..I\u2026..I still want him to stay alive.\u201dZhuan Xu took a deep breath \u201cXiang Liu killed Feng Long and I need to give a reckoning to the Chi Sui clan and Sheng Nong tribe otherwise it cannot appease the Middle Plains! But, as long as Xiang Liu is willing to stop, I can give him a chance to disappear.\u201dDisappear doesn\u2019t mean death so this meant Zhuan Xu agreed with her pleading. Xiao Yao smiled brightly \u201cThank you Gege!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Grandfather and I tried countless times to bring Xiang Liu to our side and I even gave him carte blanche to name his terms. But he would never abandon or betray Gong Gong. Actually all this time it\u2019s not I who wouldn\u2019t stop, it\u2019s him who wouldn\u2019t stop. If he vows to fight to the death then there is nothing I can do, I can\u2019t sacrifice Ru So and the soldiers. His life is a life but so are the lives of those fighting for me.\u201dXiao Yao bit her lip and lowered her said as she quietly said \u201cI know.\u201dZhuan Xu patted her on the shoulder \u201cHe chose his path and now you\u2019ve chosen yours and have done all you can do. I think you\u2019ve done enough for the friends.h.i.+p. No matter what happens you can forget him and forget it all!\u201dXiao Yao nodded her head.Zhuan Xu got on the cloud carriage and Xiao Yao said \u201cYou take care!\u201dZhuan Xu stared at the ruo mu flower in her hair and calmly said \u201cI will!\u201d Not just for myself, but for Xiao Yao also.He smiled at Jing \u201cI leave Xiao Yao in your care!\u201dJing bowed low \u201cYour Majesty can rest a.s.sured.\u201dZhuan Xu closed the door and ordered \u201cDepart!\u201dThe cloud carriage rose into the sky.Xiao Yao watched as the cloud carriages carrying the Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu flew back towards Sheng Nong Mountain. This was the fate of emperors, even if blood related there was never complete trust and each had to walk his own path. Only female birds flocked together, male birds were destined to always fly alone.Xiao Yao softly sighed, from now on Sheng Nong Mountain was no longer part of her life. She was no longer the granddaughter to the Yellow Emperor or the little sister to Zhuan Xu accompanying his path. Xiao Yao glanced at Jing and leaned her head on his shoulder, from now one she was his wife!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They attended Ah Heng\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding and reunited with a familiar person in the Grand Emperor. But so many more close people were no longer there and everyone had so many bittersweet feelings so drank wine like water.Xiao Yao drank a lot with them but even with her high tolerance she got drunk by the end. She recalled talking about her mom and hugging Lie Yang as the two bawled their eyes out. Finally it was Jing who picked her up and carried her to bed\u2026..Xiao Yao suddenly bolted upright \u201cWe got married?\u201dJing rubbed Xiao Yao\u2019s forehead and pretended to be perplexed \u201cI never heard that getting drunk led to memory loss.\u201dXiao Yao stuttered \u201cLast night\u2026..last night I\u2026..you\u2026\u2026we\u2026..\u201dJing laughed \u201cLast night you were passed out drunk so I let you sleep. Don\u2019t worry, our days together are long and I\u2019m not in a rush. What? Are you in a rush?\u201dXiao Yao glared at Jing and rushed off red faced to wash up.After getting dressed, Xiao Yao and Jing went to look for Lie Yang and Ah Bi. After breakfast the four of them went to pay their respects to Xiao Yao\u2019s family members.Even though Jing knew that Xiao Yao\u2019s family were all buried in this place, it was still a shock to see six tombs side by side.Ah Bi and Lie Yang went to clean and tidy each tomb while Xiao Yao introduced Jing to her grandmother and uncles.Xiao Yao saw that Jing, Lie Yang, and Ah Bi were all very solemn and laughed \u201cHey, don\u2019t be like this! Today is a good day for me! Smile more! Grandmother and my mom would have loved to see us smile.\u201dLie Yang nodded and said to Ah Bi \u201cAh Heng\u2019s daughter has truly grown up and become wise.\u201dXiao Yao pouted \u201cYou talk like you\u2019re so wise but that statement would sound more appropriate coming from Ah Bi.\u201dAh Bi hurriedly interjected \u201cYou two bickering please don\u2019t bring me in! I\u2019m neutral and won\u2019t take any side!\u201dXiao Yao grabbed Jing\u2019s arm and crowed \u201cWho cares? I have someone who takes my side now!\u201dLie Yang looked at Xiao Yao and Jing and smiled broadly. Xiao Yao leaned on Jing and laughed back and the sound of laughter swirled around the hillside and forests as the leaves and flowers around the tombs all swayed as if dancing to the sound of merriment.Lie Yang and Ah Bi stayed for a few more days before departing.Xiao Yao and Jing sent them off and went to Xuan Yuan Castle to look for the Grand Emperor and Ah Nian.Since there was nothing important to do on Five Gods Mountain, Ah Nian decided to stay for a period to keep her dad company. These days she would accompany the Grand Emperor to the blacksmith shop and help out, even learning to cook from the maids.When Xiao Yao and Jing arrived at the blacksmith shop, neither the Grand Emperor nor Ah Nian was there. Miao Pu said the Grand Emperor took Ah Nian to that thousand year old rundown bar to drink. Xiao Yao chuckled \u201cLooks like Dad is planning to tell Ah Nian all about his past exploits. Let\u2019s not go interrupt them.\u201dThe two strolled around the streets before Xiao Yao took Jing to a restaurant and ordered a few Xuan Yuan classic cuisine dishes.Xiao Yao was quietly eating when seven or eight soldiers walked in and the leader gleefully yelled out \u201cShopkeeper, bring the best dishes and wine! Today I\u2019m treating, anyone here is invited! Waiter, give every table wine to celebrate the Xuan Yuan Army\u2019s great victory today!\u201dEveryone in the restaurant got excited and started asking questions, learning that it was Great General Ru So who won the battle and a few diners laughed \u201cIsn\u2019t the Great General Ru So constantly winning battles recently already?\u201dThe lead soldier said \u201cThis is not like any regular great victory! Nine Lives Xiang Liu is dead! You business people likely don\u2019t know how powerful and vicious that Xiang Liu is\u2026..\u201dComing so out of the blue that she could not brace for it, Xiao Yao felt a piercing dagger stab her chest and her ears were ringing. The pain in her heart exploded and the wine cup in her hand dropped.Jing worried cried out \u201cXiao Yao!\u201dXiao Yao murmured \u201cIt can\u2019t be! It\u2019s impossible! He can\u2019t be dead just like this! I didn\u2019t feel anything, I can\u2019t feel anything anymore\u2026\u2026\u201d She suddenly remembered that the Lover\u2019s Bug was removed by the Royal Mother so she obviously can\u2019t feel the connection anymore. Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes rolled back into her head and she collapsed backward.Jing grabbed Xiao Yao \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Xuan Yuan Mountain first, let Miao Pu take the Grand Emperor\u2019s badge to gather information.\u201dXiao Yao was lightheaded and leadfooted, all she kept saying over and over was \u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201dJing ordered Miao Pu and appeared to say something to Xiao Yao but she couldn\u2019t hear anything clearly.Miao Pu rushed off, and it seemed like it was a short time, but perhaps also a very long time, when she returned.Xiao Yao immediately asked \u201cThat was fake news, right?\u201dMiao Pu replied \u201cGeneral Ying Long said that Xiang Liu died in battle.\u201dXiao Yao screamed wildly \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, I don\u2019t believe it!\u201dMiao Pu was so frightened she didn\u2019t dare say anything word.Jing brought in a bowl of the strongest alcohol and forced Xiao Yao to drink it all. He gently asked \u201cDo you still want to hear more? If you don\u2019t want to hear any more I can drink with you.\u201dXiao Yao held her head and said to Miao Pu \u201cKeep talking.\u201d\u201cAfter the death of the Chi Sui Clan Leader, His Majesty ordered that the Army was to completely exterminate Gong Gong\u2019s army at all costs. Great General Ru So commanded an army of 200,000 soldiers to surround and attack Gong Gong\u2019s army. Under the unrelenting attack of the Xuan Yuan army, Gong Gong\u2019s army retreated deep into the forest and refused to engage. General Ru So started to burn the entire mountain to force Gong Gong\u2019s army to come out and battle and found themselves facing General Ru So\u2019s army and also General Li Yuan\u2019s army of 20,000 soldiers. Gong Gong led his soldiers into the ocean but General Ru So already anticipated Gong Gong would escape towards the ocean. He stationed General Yu Jiang and his water trained soldiers to lay in wait. He was ready to cut down Gong Gong when Xiang Liu somehow energized his nearly dead soldiers to battle open a route for Gong Gong to escape. But General Ru So and Yu Jiang followed the entire way for days and nights until he caught up to Gong Gong on a remote ocean island. General Ru So had the island surrounded and used many ancient spells and weapons so that even if Gong Gong turned into a tiny fish he couldn\u2019t escape. Yu Jiang insisted on landing on the island with his soldiers to attack and started a fierce battle with Gong Gong\u2026.\u201dMiao Pu\u2019s voice got softer and softer \u201cOne thousand Sheng Nong soldiers against 100,000 thousand Xuan Yuan soldiers, not a single person surrendered and every Sheng Nong soldier died. Yu Jiang is a top fighter among the Gods but he could not defeated the heavily injured Gong Gong. Later General Ru So ordered every single soldier to shoot their arrow at Gong Gong and with over ten thousand arrows shot at him Gong Gong finally died. It was after his death that his true form appeared, it was the Nine Lives demon\u2026.General Ru So realized then that he was tricked.\u201dXiao Yao bent over and her arms wrapped around her head as her shoulders shook uncontrollably. Miao Pu didn\u2019t dare to say more but Jing gentled stroked Xiao Yao\u2019s back and said \u201cYou keep talking!\u201dMiao Pu glanced at Left Ear and saw his emotionless face so she continued \u201cGeneral Ru So, once he discovered he was tricked, did not fall into a rage. Instead he said happily \u201cWith Xiang Liu\u2019s death, the hardest part of the war is over.\u201d Because Xiang Liu really killed so many of our men, I heard a lot of soldiers wanted to harm and desecrate his body to assuage their anger. But General Ru So whipped the men who rushed forward and ordered everyone to step back. Once everyone left the island, Xiang Liu\u2019s body dissolved into black blood that destroyed every living thing on the island include blades of grass. Even the ground turned black. All the soldiers were frightened and even General Ru So was scared afterwards, if it wasn\u2019t for his respect for this enemy likely everyone would have died alongside on the island.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s body collapsed on the pallet, if she didn\u2019t believe it earlier now she believed it. Only Xiang Liu could do something like that.Jing gestured to Miao Pu and Left Ear and both left the room.Jing pulled Xiao Yao into his arms and tenderly said \u201cIf you\u2019re heart is hurting, just cry it out!\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s face was ashen white but she kept muttering the same lie over and over \u201cI\u2019m fine! I was already prepared\u2026..when I first met him I knew this day would come! I always knew!Jing picked up the wine jug \u201cThen let\u2019s drink!\u201dJing poured the wine for Xiao Yao and she picked it up and gulped it down, the strong wine giving her cheeks a red flush.The sky gradually darkened.Jing said \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to rest, I can accompany you for a stroll outside.\u201dXiao Yao staggered to the pallet \u201cI can fall asleep.\u201dJing could tell she was trying to battle herself so he didn\u2019t say more and released the curtains for her to rest.Xiao Yao breathed evenly in and didn\u2019t move, appearing to fall into a slumber.In the middle of the night, Xiao Yao\u2019s eyes opened wide and she stared at the beams on the ceiling.She quietly got up and looked at Jing sleeping calmly and felt relieved. She put on her outer robe and walked out of the room to sit on the jade steps.Outside of the palace walls was a crescent moon, cold and lonely.Xiao Yao remembered the moon in Qing Shui Town. When Xiang Liu died, was the moon in the sky shining down on him like this. Did he think about the moon they looked at together.Even though the East Sea and Xuan Yuan was separated by tens of thousands of miles, but if Xiang Liu wanted he could always let her know. But even in death he didn\u2019t care to say goodbye to her. In his eyes, she wasn\u2019t even someone to be deemed a friend. It was always a transaction between them, each and every time it was a deal that was calculated clearly and fairly.Xiao Yao suddenly remembered something and hurriedly searched herself before taking out the mystical Gorilla Mirror she always kept by her side. Inside the mirror were two memories she saved, and now it was the only thing she had left of him.One memory was in Qing Shui Town when he couldn\u2019t move because he was injured. Wen Xiao Liu captured him and used the chance to get revenge on all the times he was mean to her. Xiao Liu used the coal in the warmer to draw 7 eyes on his face, plus his 2 eyes, that gave him 9 eyes so she could make fun of him as nine headed demon.The other memory was from deep in the ocean. Wen Xiao Liu and Xiang Liu\u2019s reached a deal and Xiang Liu took her to Five Gods Mountain to remove the voodoo bug from Zhuan Xu. After removing the bug, they were chased by the Five Gods Mountain soldiers so they went deeper into the ocean to escape. That was the first time Xiao Yao experienced the beauty of the ocean depths and when Xiang Liu wasn\u2019t paying attention she secretly recorded Xiang Liu as he was carefree and with his guard down.Xiao Yao took a deep breath and used her power to turn on the mirror. But after swiping repeatedly nothing appeared.Xiao Yao grew frantic \u201cIt can\u2019t be! It can\u2019t be!\u2026..\u201d She anxiously used her power to look into the mirror. But no matter how many times she looked there were no memories of Xiang Liu.Even the only thing he left to her was gone!Xiao Yao could not believe it and she angrily kept trying the mirror \u201cHow could this be? How could this be?\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly she remembered, when she was unconscious Xiang Liu discovered the secret of the mirror and ordered her to erase it. When she woke up he never mentioned it again and she thought he forgot, but it turned out that when she wasn\u2019t aware he had completely erased it all!Xiao Yao stroked the mirrored and said through tears \u201cXiang Liu, in your eyes, am I really that meaningless? So you won\u2019t even leave me a small memory!\u201d\u201cNine Headed Demon, I hate you!\u201d Xiao Yao violently threw the mirror as her tears tumbled down her cheek.In Qing Shui Town, she was Wen Xiao Liu, he was Xiang Liu. They were always at odds, but when he got injured he would hide in her room to heal. She didn\u2019t know when she started telling him her painful past that she had never told anymore before.In Xuan Yuan Castle, he was the dissolute playboy Fang Feng Bei, he was gentle and considerate, fun loving yet diligently and patiently taught her ten plus years of archery.When she was asleep under the ocean for 37 years, they spent every night together. That was probably when Xiang Liu was the most tender and caring towards her. She was of no use to him to exploit and they have no reason to be on opposite sides of each other, so during that time it was just one person taking the other person through life together in the ocean. One person sometimes saying a few words here and there, the other laying forever in silence.At her wedding ceremony in Chi Sui, he came to steal the bride from the wedding and made her go with him as payment for the promise she made. He also asked for 37 years of army provisions from Jing. All he gave up was his alter ego identity, but her reputation was thoroughly destroyed.After that he was the General to Gong Gong\u2019s army and she was Zhuan Xu\u2019s little sister, every time saw each other even their words were like swords slashing at one another.The last time they saw each other, because of Feng Long\u2019s death, on the very Hu Lu Lake where they once played together she now wanted to kill him and he used Jing\u2019s death to rile her up to get revenge for Jing. That night he nearly drank all her blood all to make a pill for healing. She hated him for being so cold blooded and vowed never to see him again!If she knew that it would be the last time they would ever see each other again in this life time, she would have said something else. No matter how cold and harsh he was to her, she would never ever have wanted to say what she said to him.Xiao Yao\u2019s entire face was awash with tears and she lifted her head to stare at the sky.Xiang Liu, why? Why? Why do you treat me this way? Why won\u2019t you even let me keep one memory of you\u2026..so our hundreds of years together, it was always just a transaction to you?Xiang Liu died so boldly and left nothing behind, no parting words and even his body dissolved into poison. No one was there to answer Xiao Yao\u2019s plaintive question.When Jing embraced Xiao Yao from behind was when she realized it was gradually sunrise.Xiao Yao realized she was cold from being in the cold all night and Jing used his body to warm her \u201cWhen did you get up?\u201dXiao Yao hurriedly wiped her tears and said with a twinge \u201cNot long ago.\u201dJing softly kissed her on the curve of her neck.Xiao Yao weakly leaned into Jing\u2019s embrace and after some time she said in a low voice \u201cI just told you a lie, I\u2019ve actually been up for a long time. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201dJing replied \u201cDon\u2019t worry, even the most loving spouses need time to themselves. I know you are very sad and pained right now, so you need to be alone even more.\u201dXiao Yao said \u201cI\u2026..I\u2026..\u201dJing covered her lips \u201cDon\u2019t think your husband is a very jealous and small minded person. Xiang Liu saved your life many times, I am eternally grateful to him.\u201dXiao Yao\u2019s tears began to fall again and the drops landed on Jing\u2019s hand. Jing said nothing and continued to hold Xiao Yao in his arms.Xiao Yao murmured \u201cEven though I always reminded myself that he was Zhuan Xu\u2019s enemy, but I\u2026..I was not prepared for this! I really wish it was all a lie\u2026..he\u2019s so sneaky, he must\u2019ve found a way to stay alive!\u201dJing said nothing because he knew Xiao Yao didn\u2019t need his response.\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s so sneaky that he doesn\u2019t want to stay alive! One time he told me \u201cActually, to a General, the best ending is dying on the battlefield.\u201d So he chose for himself the best ending!\u201d\u201cBut what bullshit best ending! He\u2019s the stupidest idiot in this world! He stayed loyal and true to Gong Gong and all his soldier comrades but did he do himself right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the idiot actually! He never cared so why do I have to be so hurt. I don\u2019t want to be feeling so much hurt\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Yao kept talking and crying until gradually her words trailed off and she curled tightly in Jing\u2019s arms and stared at the tall Phoenix Flower Tree. Blooms of red fell to the ground carried by the wind as if frames of each memory passing by, no matter how beautiful it would all pass with the wind.Xiao Yao wearily closed her eyes \u201cJing, I want to leave!\u201d\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d\u201cTo the ocean! The millions of miles of ocean and unending horizon, Xiang Liu said there were endless uninhabited and uncharted islands, perhaps we can find a beautiful island to call home.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dXiao Yao wanted Miao Pu and Left Ear to follow the Grand Emperor to learn metal work so that he could earn a living one day. But Miao Pu cried and pleaded \u201cWhenever my lady goes, I go!\u201dLeft Ear said nothing and stared at Xiao Yao, actually even harder to shake than Miao Pu. Xiao Yao gave up \u201cAs long as you guys don\u2019t mind a hard life then follow Jing and me!\u201dXiao Yao packed her bags and it was mainly the wedding presents. Her grandfather gave her two boxes of jewelry, likely her grandmother\u2019s items. Her father\u2019s present was a small dagger he hand forged and a short sword. Zhaun Xu\u2019s present was very useful, an estate in Xuan Yuan Castle and hundreds of acres of land outside. Ah Nian\u2019s present was a bundle of Fu Xang God Wood. Lie Yang\u2019s present was magical elixir pills likely collected by him over hundreds of years that even Xiao Yao was impressed. And Ah Bi\u2019s present was a pair of jade pendants made using Jade Mountain\u2019s ancient jade vault and a big bellied laughing doll carved out of Fu Sang God Wood. Both he handmade.Xiao Yao pick three of her favorite jewels from her Grandfather, she kept both dagger and sword from her dad to use for protection and also to cut fruit, she thought a bit about Zhuan Xu\u2019s present and accepted it, she carefully packed Ah Nian\u2019s present, of course she was taking all of Lie Yang\u2019s present, and Ah Bi\u2019s jade pendants could be worn to protect and also ground down as magical healing medicine so she fashioned one for herself and put the other around Jing\u2019s waist.Lastly there was the big bellied laughing doll\u2026\u2026Xiao Yao was curious from the beginning. Why didn\u2019t Ah Bi use peach wood from Jade Mountain and instead used Fu Sang God Wood? Fu Sang God Wood can ignite without a flame and was not suitable to be used as carving wood. And it wasn\u2019t clear what Ah Bi did to this piece of God Wood so that it could be touched and not burn.Xiao Yao cradled the doll and said to Jing \u201cAh Bi is so funny, other such dolls have big heads but his doll has a big head and a big belly. Does it mean this fat doll got fat because it loves to eat?\u201dJing looked at the doll \u201cThis is Fu Sang God Wood over tens of thousands year old, it cannot be penetrated by water or flame, no weapon can mar it, it would be exceedingly difficult to use it to carve this so Ah Bi must\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it.\u201dThe big bellied doll wasn\u2019t of any practical use but Xiao Yao just thought it was so cute and holding it in her hands she liked it more and more. A big head, a big belly, it was wearing a round belly cover and had a pout on its lips, it\u2019s smile so impish that Xiao Yao couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing in joy at it.This was the first time Xiao Yao laughed in days and Jing let out a sigh of relief and said softly to Miao Pu \u201cPlease pack this smiling doll safely to bring.\u201dOn departure day the sun was bright and the winds mild, a very suitable day for travel.The Grand Emperor and Ah Nian accompanied them to the start of the highway where many people who bid travelers farewell. Often they would hear cries and sniffles from other groups.Left Ear and Miao Pu sat on the cart waiting for Xiao Yao to bid the Grand Emperor farewell.Xiao Yao said to Ah Nian \u201cWhen you\u2019re bored on Five Gods Mountain come to Xuan Yuan Mountain to see Dad. But remember, never ever step foot in the Middle Plains! Never ever ask anything involving Zhuan Xu!\u201dAh Nian replied \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I still love Zhuan Xu as much as I did back then but all the tears since I am no longer the same Ah Nian. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve even been on the battlefield. Even though Ju Mang was fighting the actual battles but the flood and death I experienced firsthand.\u201dXiao Yao was fully relieved.The Grand Emperor asked Xiao Yao and Jing \u201cDecided where you\u2019re going?\u201dJing replied \u201cNo, just wander for a bit and if we can find a place both of us like then perhaps we will settle there.\u201dThe Grand Emperor joked \u201cWhen you decide on where to settle, send word to us, don\u2019t go and disappear without a trace.\u201dJing smiled and said nothing while Xiao Yao kneeled down with him and both bowed three times to the Grand Emperor. Xiao Yao said \u201cDad, please take care of yourself, we are off now.\u201dThe Grand Emperor sighed in resignation and said with a smile \u201cOff you go!\u201dJing and Xiao Yao got on the card and with the clamor of horse hooves and wheels soon they disappeared into the people and carts on the road.The cart they were riding was ordinary and could not be distinguished from the other carts on the road.The Grand Emperor had sharp eyes but soon he couldn\u2019t not tell which was her cart. He saw countless carts on the road and everyone was the most ordinary human out there, and now Xiao Yao was one of them.The Grand Emperor\u2019s heart was sorrowful but also a sense of letting go.Xiao Yao had the most noble and royal lineage in the entire world. Her mom tried to break free from it with all her might but she didn\u2019t succeed. But now Xiao Yao succeeded.Xiao Yao had the Face Forming Flower inside her and Jing was the descendant of the Nine Tailed Fox. Once they departed, they could disappear forever.The Grand Emperor already could sense Jing and Xiao Yao\u2019s intentions but did not openly acknowledge it. He acted like it was as normal trip and would also let Zhuan Xu and the Yellow Emperor think that Xiao Yao was still living in Xuan Yuan Castle.A few hundred years ago when Xiao Yao escaped Jade Mountain and wandered the world, it likely set in motion today\u2019s ending. She returned briefly to the world of the Gods, from Five Gods Mountain to Xuan Yuan Mountain to Sheng Nong Mountain, she witnessed firsthand the unification of the entire Wilderness. Perhaps it was to complete her mother\u2019s final wish to let Zhuan Xu safely ascend the throne, and today Xiao Yao had fulfilled her mother\u2019s dying wish. Xiao Yao chose the path going forward of the water returning to the sea, the bird returning to the tree, one again returning to where she really belonged.The Grand Emperor walked with Ah Nian slowly back to the blacksmith shop.It was the busiest time in Xuan Yuan Castle, people walking on the streets and alleys, carts and horses jamming up the space. The sounds of vendors calling out mixed together, and Xiao Yao could be the lady selling wine in the shop, or the doctor napping in his clinic, or that lady chasing after her son with a fan\u2026\u2026.The Grand Emperor could not help but smile, when Zhuan Xu discovered and then could not find Xiao Yao, he would undoubtedly be furious. But he would soon realize that Xiao Yao was the world of people and the world of people was Xiao Yao. As long as the entire world was at peace, then their Xiao Yao would be living happily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
